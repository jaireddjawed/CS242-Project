Apart from the joy of seeing excellent films, performances and imagery, one of my favourite things is ignorance.\n\nWhen someone asks me, or I read about a director, film, or film movement (i.e. french new wave, Japanese Golden Age) that I've never heard of, the excitement of undiscovered cinema is almost as exciting as watching a fantastic film for the first time. Being able to delve in and explore the films to add to my watchlist, the similarities in styles and infleunces from some of my other favourites, or even a completely different stylistic approach. It's such a thrill!\n\nOnce such example, I was exploring one of those 'Top 100 Japanese animated films' kind of lists and came across a few films by a director Masaaki Yuasa. Reading about the films and the directors style I delved further into and found him to have been invovled in several TV shows I like. I am now thoroughly excited by the prospect of watching some of his films and TV shows.\n\nIs this a common feeling that you get? What films/directors/movements do you remember getting excited about?

Woman is raped, meek man loads up and kills rapists, etc. \n\nWhat I got was something different entirely. The rape scene was admittedly a really difficult one, but I think many critics are unfair in thinking that it should somehow be fair and without complexity. Rape is one of the worst acts man can commit, and it’s presented in all its horror here. But I definitely understand why people would consider it misogynistic, given that Amy seems to be enjoying it, and this is an aspect that I’m struggling with as well. I’m not sure why she’s depicted as doing this, and it makes the scene feel even more confusing and upsetting that she’s seemingly giving into what’s happening. \n\nThe other thing I’m wrestling with is what the general message is. Initially I thought it would be a rage revenge film, but David never finds out about the rape. Then I thought it was about how this meek liberal intellectual escapes the toughness of Vietnam era America, and then becomes a Big Man^tm because he acts violently and defends his home. But I don’t think it’s that either. David is kind of an asshole for the first half of the movie, lording over these common village folk with his superiority, and he’s an even bigger asshole as he defends his home. So it seems that reading it with a right wing “intellectuals are less manly” lens that was common in the time of Vietnam is inaccurate too. \n\nNow that I’ve explored a lot of the amazing Criterion supplements, it seems like Peckinpah was just a nihilistic person, obsessed with depicting raw emotions and the state of humanity on film, and this is the closest I can get to understanding what Straw Dogs is trying to say. \n\nAm I missing something?",

Instead of agitation and hatred it evokes curiosity and concern.\n\nAnd the way it does it is by taking the viewer through the personal lives of the parties involved – the judge, the prosecution, the defense, and the accused.\n\nAnd when it does that, you find it very hard to breed antagonism against anyone because these characters seem very relatable, very real.\n\nInstead you somehow understand them, and understand the reason why they are who they are and what effect it has on the system (because the system is nothing but a colective expression of all of us)\n\nThe movie had such a profound effect on me, that I decided to compile my thoughts in the video (link above).

In struggling to describe to myself what it actually is, I attempted to think of films that I'd seen that explored it. It then hit me that I couldn't think of any off the top of my head that featured it as a core concept, but rather it used as a motivation of one of the characters.\n\nI compare this to books, where for instance I can pinpoint Man's Search for Meaning as a book that actively discusses hope. \n\nIn doing some cursory googling, all the films I found suggested were quite mainstream Hollywood releases, and I had seen a majority of them but didn't quite feel like they explored hope, merely used it as a character motivation.\n\nSo this leads to my question: Do you think a film can explore hope as the central theme, or merely have a character trait and motivation? If so, what films do you think explore it?",

In this video, I can’t really overreach, because I don’t talk. We only quote what Tarantino and his peers have said (you can look at our script, with all of our references and notes [here](https://bit.ly/2mE6BSq)). Creating a video using only what other people have said forces you to research like crazy. And even harder still, we wanted to construct several narratives within it. It’s been a journey, to say the least.\n\nI guess I wanted to make this post to talk about the current state of film discussion on the Internet. I think at the end of the day, there’s a shortage of *really good* YouTube videos talking about film. Anyone with talent seems to do pretty well, pretty quickly. But for every great video, there are 100 not-so-good ones. Sometimes, I fear video essays are an echo chamber, especially with the fact that half of them are Marvel, Nolan, Fincher, Anderson, or Tarantino (whoops, I just did that!). \n\nBut I also think we have the potential to enter a film criticism Golden Age. Tarantino has mentioned his disdain for online film criticism, and a lot of it sucks. Where’s Pauline Kael? Where’s Roger Ebert? Granted, there are some [knockouts](https://filmcrithulk.blog/) writing right now, but again, it’s a shortage. The Internet could bridge the gap between academia and the masses, and that’s really what I want to be a part of.\n\nSo, what should be the future of film criticism on the Internet? And to put it bluntly, what kind of stuff do you guys want someone like me and other video essay people to do about it? I may or may not be in close contact with some popular video essay people.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/91gz0b/the_irishman_2019_will_the_deaging_cgi_affect_the/",
        "text": "Video version of this post:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OngLQL-jJD8\n\nI recently rewatched the opening scene of Ant Man were the revolutionary effects were applied to the elderly Michael Douglas to make him look younger. There is a sense of uncanny valley watching it, the sense that something is off, even though comparatively it’s one of the best examples of de-aging CGI around, though that isn’t saying too much. My mind also wandered to George Lucas’ Star Wars prequels, in particular the third film where he sometimes spliced multiple takes within the same shot together to get what he thought was the best performance from an actor. An example would be Anakin’s face when he’s being told the tragedy of Darth Plagues the Wise in the Opera House.  \n\nIt got me thinking about the de-aging CGI in The Irishman. \n\nNothing similar on such a scale has been attempted before, so the only real decent ballpark measurement we have is the ant man example and a few others like the de-aging of a certain character in Blade Runner 2049. These were only for a couple of seconds and The Irishman will have huge chunks of its runtime where the actors need to be de-aged, one of the reasons for the extraordinary costs of the film rising to $170m and counting. I covered the potential pros and cons of the de aging cgi in another post, but what I’m concerned with here is how it will affect the actor’s performances.\n\nLooking at the scene in ant man, when Douglas gets angry and threatening, and his face scrunches up and his eyebrows dart up and down. It got me thinking that when an actor is plastered in so much digital effects, how much of an actors performance can be attributed to the actor himself and not the cgi? Who’s to say the special effects whizzes didn’t touch up and edit parts of Douglas’ face to make it more inline with what the character was supposed to be expressing, because for whatever reason, maybe because Douglas is old and therefore less emotive than he used to be. Doesn’t that take away from the actors performance?\n\nGoing back to The Irishman, and some actors like Al Pacino might spend the majority of their screentime with their faces digitally de-aged. If this is the case, what do we attribute all the ticks and nuanced expressions the actor does to, the actor or the cgi? \nLet me give an example. Say there’s a scene with Pacino and the effects guys are having a hard time in post-production making Pacino look young in this particular scene. Who knows why, maybe because the speed of him talking or the sweat coming down his face, whatever. But it’s proving challenging. And to find a solution the tec whizz has to alter a part of Pacino’s face, maybe edit the texture, or remove a certain expression because it didn’t look right when de-aged. Or maybe even, like it was an animated movie, Scorsese himself is sitting in the editing room and finds himself unhappy with a certain expression or reaction from an actor and tells the de-aging guys to edit it to suit his wants. How then could we judge the actor’s acting is said scene? \n\nSimilar things have happened before. Marlon Brando refused to smile in his last scene in The Score when he’s watching the TV monitor, so they actually digitally inserted the smile. Now the CGI in The Irishman is utilizing a lot of money and time so we’re probably gonna witness the best the industry has offer currently and, since the best CGi is when you don’t notice it’s CGI, if its successfully applied we won’t realize where the special effects have taken place. Obviously we’ll know that effects have been used because we know what De Niro and Pacino looked like in their youth but we might not necessarily know how much effects have been used. That scene where he’s crying – did his eyes really swell up with tears or was that cgi? That part where he’s raging – did his face really go that red or was that cgi too? That’s the kind of stuff I’m talking about. \n\nIt’s akin to an actor being under heavy make up like say Pacino in Dick Tracy or more recently Gary Oldman in Darkest Hour. When you are under as much makeup and prostethics as Pacino in Tracy or Hugo Weaving in Captain America it limits the performance because the actor is covered under it all and, well, you can’t his face properly. It might not be much different with Pacino getting a digital face-lift where his mannerisms may be masked or even created by the special effects.\n\nAnyway, there are two answers to this question really. The first is wait for the film to come out so we can see for ourselves, and the second is who cares? I appreciate that it’s not going to be a big deal for most people watching the film as long as the cgi is good, but one of the charms of the film in the casting of these titanic actors, for me, is not just because of who they are and their reputations but, quite simply, that they are magnificent actors and I want to see them give magnificent performances not restricted by effects which could hamper their performance by masking their acting or artificially producing elements of their facial expressions. If they do end up altering performances using CGI that gets all a bit too weird for me. It’s almost like, what, is this a cartoon now? Changing backgrounds, sky colours and such is now normal, it was abundantly done in The Wolf of Wall Street for example, but editing the performance of actors with CGI, if it does happen, is too much really. \n\nOr is it? I mean, aren’t movies as a concept based on deception? Actors pretending to be different people, movies filmed in studios pretending to be in deserts and mountains, fake backgrounds, wigs and make up, squibs, motion capture, quickening frame rates, multiple rehearsed takes, green screen, stunt doubles etc etc CGI is just another tool I guess, and though I prefer the idea of real actors interacting with real actors, technology is moving forward and providing new opportunities, even if it’s going to take us a while to get used to it. Heck, we saw a character whose actor is dead play a significant role in Rogue One. Doesn’t get weirder than that. Maybe one day we’ll see actors long since dead appear in movies regularly, like how Aubrey Hepburn was creepily recreated for a galaxy advert. \n\nIf the effects in The Irishman are successful, it may have many film makers turn their heads and have lightbulbs flashing above them. That Sinatra biopic that Scorsese wanted to make? Instead of finding an actor to play him, maybe he’ll just digitally recreate him.\n\n The future for CGI looks interesting. \n\n\n",

        "text": "A film that is very dear to me, as it was my doorway to cinema, but this is one thing I never really understood. Granted it could be a case of the Italian film makers trying to come up with a snazzy name to attract audiences, but do the titles associated with each character have any significance?\n\nWith Clint, we see that he kills more people than anyone else in the film. He is greedy for the gold as much as anyone else, and when \"the good\" title card appears it's more of an ironic piece of humor than anything else, after just coming after Clint remarks \"Such ingratitude after all the times I've saved your life\" when clearly he and Tuco were in the faux-execution plots together. If anything, the card appears after he does something bad, wheras when \"the bad\" appears Van Cleef has killed someone who he was arguably given money to take out, and was seemingly not a very good person himself. Not saying it was a good action, but things aren't too black and white. \n\nPerhaps it's the small moments (giving the solider the cigarette) or that he clearly does have something of a moral compass - he took only his half of the gold, after all.\n\nAngel Eyes is again going after the gold, but aside from his menacing appearance what actually separates him so much from the other two that he can be called \"the bad\"? Perhaps it's the methods he implements, because his intentions seem the same as the other two. He slaps up the wife, sneers viciously in the intro against the guy in the house, has Tuco beaten up, and we can assume that he would've taken the gold for himself at the end.\n\nBut playing devil's advocate, you could say that he did what was necessary to reach his goals (which were the same as the other two). After all, he says to Clint that he won't torture him because he knows it won't work on him. Eyes has something of a moral compass too, doing a job mercilessly as long as he's paid the cash and, if I remember correctly, he killed 3 people - 2 were on a contract, and one was in self defense.\n\nTuco is a little easier. By far the most developed character, we can clearly see his appearance, actions, intentions and methods are in between the good and the bad. Sometimes he is viscous, other times he is charming. He remembers his faith even if it done hypocritically, and you get the sense that if his environment was a little different he could have been a good man. He kinda reminds me of the character in Scorsese's Silence who always chooses the easy way out, betraying his religion, and then comes running back to it asking for forgivness. There's a hint of goodnes in Tuco, but a whole lot of bad (let's not forget we're told he is a rapist, murderer, thief etc)\n\nMy real question lies with the other two. What do you suppose separates Clint and Van Cleef in the film, so much so that one can be called 'good' and the other 'bad'? ",

        "text": "I was enjoying this movie a lot, when something threw me off guard. Whilst discussing his sister's fate of which he is trying to avert, Channing Tatum's character Jody says that she is due to be \"hung\". This broke the immersion of the film entirely. I laughed, shrugged it off, but then felt kind of disappointed. Tarantino is usually so attentive to detail, in-fact he is renowned for it. Here's a quote from Bruce Dern who plays the veteran general talking about the project:\n\n\"The excitement for all of us was just to be asked by this man to be in his movie. He has the greatest attention to detail on a set as any director who ever lived.\"\n\nAnd from an article from 2016:\n\n\"A trademark of Tarantino’s unique style is attention to detail. He doesn’t waste a single second of screen time. Every object, person, sound, or dialogue that graces the final edits of his films are purposely featured— meant to reveal underlying details such as unique characters virtues and vices.\"\n\nI'm struggling to see how this could have been intentional. Given the era, hangings were a regular occurrence and everyone would have used the word \"hanged\" regularly, as they do in the movie itself. Similarly, they would have known the difference between \"hanged\" and \"hung\", given that many of their daily tasks were manual and required things to be \"hung\".. coats, signs, guns, hats, saddles, laundry and so on. He also would - I thought - have been careful not to trvialise the situation of his sister's potential death by using the wrong word to describe her fate.\n\nMy conclusion is that it was just sloppy on Tarantino's part to allow this in to the final cut. Regardless of his usual attention to detail, this is something that any director at this level would make sure doesn't happen, but for him, this is a huge blunder given how obvious the mistake was and presumably how possible it was to fix.\n\nAm I wrong on my interpretation? Would be interesting to hear what other people think.",

        "text": "[Stagecoach](https://i.redd.it/m2a6hk0rusb11.jpg)\n\nlink for pictures and gifs [https://thefilmera.com/2018/07/23/stagecoach/](https://thefilmera.com/2018/07/23/stagecoach/)\n\n**I**n 1939, director John Ford did for the western what Francis Ford Coppola would do for the gangster movie decades later; he saved it from B-movie obscurity.  *Stagecoach* not only revitalized the western from a commercial standpoint, but also an artistic one and its influence is still being felt seventy-nine years later.  There are traces of *Stagecoach* that can be found in the vast majority of the westerns that followed; be it from the landscapes of Monument Valley or the music, camera work, production elements, or other tropes that we associate with the genre. Any film that has been mimicked so much, however, risks feeling obsolete or dated.  This has happened to plenty of fine films and going in I wondered how *Stagecoach* was going to live up.  Was it a relic better left to the past, or instead a cinematic classic that stands the test of time? \n\n *Stagecoach* is an ensemble in every sense of the word and multiple characters are drawn straight from western tropes: the hooker with a heart of gold, the outlaw, the drunken doctor, the banker, the helpless lady, the gentleman with a checkered past, etc.  Though their reasons are different, they end up traveling together on a stagecoach to a new town. To get there, they have to go through the treacherous Monument Valley, where they are constantly under threat from an Apache attack.  This Apache threat establishes a feeling of dread that hangs over the heads of the cast throughout their journey together.  Here lies one of the film’s greatest strengths: instead of focusing on individual character development, it uses basic character archetypes and develops them through events happening in the plot.  The characters themselves are entertaining, with the exception of one or two that are just taking up space, but most of them get equal time to shine. \n\nGoing in, I have to admit I had a sort of preconceived notion of what to expect, despite John Ford’s reputation.  My only exposure to his works was seeing *The Searchers* at a very young age and it didn’t make much impact at that time.  With *Stagecoach,* I was expecting a light, fluffy, action-adventure with events that didn’t much weight or any deeper meaning. I’m happy to say that, at times, I can be an idiot.  There is not really much action for a good part of the runtime, but when it hits, it is fantastic because of the way it is built up.  Instead, this is about a group of people learning to support each other despite the differences they have or prejudices they hold.  The more controversial characters (the outlaw and the prostitute) are shown in a brighter light than the ones who are held up higher by society, like the banker, who is crooked and selfish.  This is a message that still holds up today, even though some of the film’s politics don’t stand up to scrutiny in the modern age.\n\nNow, in retrospect, I’m fairly certain that any prejudice I may have had before viewing *Stagecoach*was a result of the actor whose stardom was launched as a result.  I have never been a John Wayne guy.  He never impressed me in the few roles I had seen him in and his actions outside of acting caused me to harbor a bit of a grudge against him.  In my mind, he has always represented that part of the Hollywood “Old Guard” that rejects change and would let cinema become complacent just to stroke his own ego. Look how he labeled the magnificent *High Noon* as un-American and trashed it as a result.  Not to mention, many films over the years (like *Full Metal Jacket*) have used his legend in a way to criticize and subvert what he stands for. That being said, when John Wayne’s outlaw character, The Ringo Kid, made his entrance in *Stagecoach* in that wonderful dolly shot coming closer as he cocks his shotgun one handed, I screamed internally like a fanboy.  It is an incredible shot, and I’m certain that the character could have dropped out of the picture after this scene and Ford still would have made Wayne a star. It’s that good.  The role doesn’t call for much in terms of acting range, but the Duke makes the best of it.  The Ringo Kid is magnetic on screen and his romantic angle with the prostitute serves as the heart of the story.\n\n When it comes to pure filmmaking, *Stagecoach* is a marvel, especially for 1939.  Just a couple of years later, Orson Welles dropped *Citizen Kane* and pushed the art of filmmaking forward.  Welles’ masterpiece is lauded for its breakthroughs in composition, such as his from the floor ceiling shots, but it must be noted that Ford beat him to the punch two years earlier*.*  Welles even declared that he watched *Stagecoach* thirty-nine times while making *Citizen Kane* and claimed it was instrumental in influencing him.  It is easy to see why. Ford has a way with composition that makes it seem easy.  At the risk of sounding pretentious, it is as if the cinema gods created Monument Valley knowing that one day John Ford would be using them.  However, his instinct for great-looking shots isn’t necessarily limited to the Monument Valley landscape as his interiors, such as the hallway shot shown below, are equally as impressive. \n\n The greatest aspect of the script may not even be the banter between characters, but instead the structure.  On paper, *Stagecoach* is basically perfect action-adventure.  The characters set off with the doom and gloom of death hanging over their heads, and the deeper they go, the closer they get to it.  Interestingly enough, the climax isn’t a full-on battle with the Apaches, as that happens at the end of the second act.  Instead, the film scales down to put the focus on the Ringo Kid and his relationship with the prostitute while also having to avenge his family by dueling a few morally inept gunslingers.  It’s the perfect comedown from the thrills of the Apache chase as the film decides to speak to the viewers emotions.  However, despite the duel being captivating, this last third of the film just is not as compelling.  Many of the characters just simply disappear because they have nothing more to do and what is there is slightly anti-climactic.  It is as if the ride ends a bit too soon and the ending doesn’t pack the punch it needs to. \n\nGoing back to the politics, I would be remiss if I did not mention the portrayal of minorities in this picture.  They are either depicted as comedic relief, remorseless villains, or untrustworthy.  Despite the forward-thinking depiction of the outlaw and prostitute, there is still an ugly side to this film with its depiction of Native Americans.  However, Ford should be praised for ensuring that the Native American actors used for the Apache attack scenes were properly paid for their contributions.\n\nSome aspects of *Stagecoach* have not aged so well, but as a whole I was pleasantly surprised by how it holds up.  It is thrilling, funny, and whole-heartedly endearing. It set the stage for the decades to come, not only the western genre, but action-adventure films in general.  Even later releases like *Star Wars* and *Raiders of the Lost Ark* owe much to John Ford’s breakthrough.  Ford would go onto much greater heights with the western and would find critical and commercial acclaim with entries like *The Searchers* and *The Man who Shot Liberty Valence*.  However, despite the amount of success he achieved afterward, *Stagecoach* still stands high as an important piece of genre film history.  It contains a wonderful cast of characters and a theme of coexisting that is still relevant today.  It just goes to show that despite how films age and change, some things are timeless.",

        "title": "How Paul Schrader's 'Mishima: A Life In Four Chapters' (1985) transcends the biopic genre",
        "author": "Eagle4",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/91btcu/how_paul_schraders_mishima_a_life_in_four/",
        "text": "Before the recent glut of prestige biopics (see: *The Theory of Everything*, *The Mercy*, *The Imitation Game*), but after *Gandhi* and *Amadeus* initiated that concept, lies a beautiful and bonkers box-office flop titled *Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters.* It gloriously dismisses the genre’s foundations, paints a delirious portrait of a deeply nationalist, and in turn, controversial Japanese figure, and directly transmits his flamboyant and flamboyantly contradictory psyche into its viewers via lucid dream. It is as impossible to define in director Paul Schrader’s body of work as it is wholly defining. It also happens to be my favourite film of all time.\n\n\nA natural trapping of the biopic genre is its forced objectivity: the movie’s narrative is dictated by the life its subject led, while any attempts to cram in a more dramatic, commercially-friendly thrust varies from strained to damningly artificial. Here, Schrader – continuing his fascination of the tortured and self-torturing male anti-hero that began with *Taxi Driver* and evidently remains with this year’s *First Reformed* – finds it much more productive to do away with genre convention and all this silly linear storytelling.\n\n\nHe argues – quite rightly – that retelling a figure’s life allows the audience to learn about them. But to evoke that figure – to peel back their exterior while keeping it intact – allows the audience to understand them too. Neruda aside, this decade’s slew of biopics haven’t quite taken *Mishima*’s approach to heart, but prioritising the remarkable over the humdrum and viscerality over staunch truth-telling is what makes *Mishima* so damn special – and why it leaves the current crop of by-the-number biopics in its blood-splashed wake.\n\n\nAnd so we begin not with our protagonist at their deathbed and the promise of a decade-spanning flashback, a structure defined by *Citizen Kane* and rigidly adhered to since, but with the cryptic image of a black slate of sea and grass, and a red dot threatening to breach the skyline. Philip Glass’ accompanying score teases bouts of bells before the title card appears, and its symphony crescendos: *Mishima* opens with infectious euphoria, though we’re not sure what we’re supposed to feel euphoric about just yet.\n\n\nThe film returns to this setting in due course – right at its end, in fact – where the source of this ecstasy is revealed. For now, *Mishima* fades to black, and lays out its structural backbone: four chapters, each labelling one of the man’s ideals, and their subsequent destruction: ‘Beauty’, ‘Art’, ‘Action’ and ‘Harmony of Pen and Sword’, are forewarned with white text.\n\n\nThese chapters are split up further, in a kaleidoscopic razzmatazz of form and timelines and thematically-drenched dramatisations. *Mishima* is a biographical character study of a controversial Japanese figure, delving into his politics, writing and narcissism; to address them in turn, in linear fashion, would be to dismiss the collective force behind his beliefs. Instead, Schrader substantiates each facet of his ideology – his determination, upbringing, self-obsession et al – by conveying his life using three methods: the present, on the day he commits death by seppuku, his past, relayed to us in black and white in standard biographical fashion, and through surrealist visualisations of three of his plays that each mirror his life and portray the breaking down of the aforementioned ideals.  \n\n\nFrequently Schrader toes the line between evoking Yukio Mishima and commending him. Repeatedly, the question of how devoutly Mishima, and subsequently, the film believes in the ideology he purports – that modern Japan is losing its way, and must be met with the revival of imperialism – is brought to the forefront. One of his first few lines, for instance, belittles the political resonance he supposedly seeks to convey via seppuku by referring to it as ‘our little drama’.\n\n\nA conflict is established – is Yukio Mishima’s theatrical display truly a way to transmit ideology, or is it simply that: a theatrical display? The film frames his vanity and commitment to ideology as one and the same, and that this vanity wasn’t ambiguous but fundamental to Mishima’s character; *Mishima* needn’t convey the ambiguity of this ideology because its subject did that all himself.  Thus, Schrader can fully submit to the man’s beliefs without necessarily advocating them, and can transmit an ideology without feeling the need to dismiss it. It’s a sticky approach: presenting and wholly commiting to an argument that contradicts almost the entirety of its viewers’ beliefs is bound to be met with wild misinterpretations and accusations. But *Mishima* is clearly a creative endeavour rather than an economical one, and all the more fascinating for it.\n\n\nIn fact, *Mishima* is a creative endeavour that needed to be directed not just by a Westerner – Yukio Mishima is largely reviled in Japan, and possessed an infatuation with the West in spite of his dismissal of their ideals, which Mishima enables – but by Schrader himself. *Mishima* represents the birth of creativity, the fusion of idea and practice, where its components are not linked via chronology or narrative but by theme. Schrader, a self-doubting perfectionist enamoured with internal conflict translated into grandiose actions, is essentially Mishima’s Western-director-doppelganger, and here he can lay bare the machinations of his creative process through the controversial figure.  \n\n\nAnd so as the narrative flitters between the present, shot harshly with a hand-held, documentarian quality, the past, its static camera and low angle framing appropriately evoking Ozu, and the dramatisation of his plays, each emblazoned with lurid palettes and imagined in blatantly surreal, stage-like fashion, it’s difficult not to notice the the sheer conviction of Schrader’s direction, and how each choice – whether that be through symbolism, dialogue and cinematography – help to piece together an idea of Mishima and the language of creative synthesis that encapsulates him.\n\n\nThe chapter ‘Beauty’, for instance, envisions Mishima reckoning with the impermanence of beauty, and how its meaning can only be realised at the point of its destruction, and before its inevitable decay – at once both suggesting justification for his decision to commit seppuku at the age of 45, and tying into the second ideal, ‘Art’, where the body is seen as a blade’s canvas. In this chapter – its dramatisation of his novel, ‘Kyoko’s House’, swimming in purposefully tacky greys and pinks – narcissism is confronted as Mishima and his novelised counterpart obsess over their bodies, and give them up before their expiry date.\n\n\nIf ‘Beauty’ is Mishima realising that the destruction of that ideal is an act of art, and ‘Art’ is Mishima comprehending how that concept can apply to himself, ‘Action’ is exactly what it suggests: putting those core beliefs to work, and thus culminating in a demonstrative and symbolic act of self-inflicted violence, or, a ‘Harmony of Pen and Sword’. By the time Mishima haplessly preaches to a choir of disinterested Japanese youth, and plunges the blade into his abdomen, the viewer can understand his actions, if not necessarily reconcile with them.\n\n\nGlass’ stirring score is the thematic adhesive, the throughline that stages Mishima’s ideology as more than the mad ramblings of a defeated narcissist. Alternating in style dependent on timeframe, where the past is met with a string quartet, the present with percussion, and the dramatisations of Mishima’s plays – fittingly – with a full-blown symphonic orchestra, the score is the beating heart of Mishima and his beliefs, his conviction emphasised as each dramatisation switches instruments and keeps hold of the same, glorious, overbearing melody.\n\n\nThe euphoria experienced as the score rised to its first crescendo is finally given substantive weight as *Mishima* comes to a close: this is the setting of the final dramatisation, ‘Runaway Horses’, where Yukio Mishima’s literary parallel has just committed seppuku and is staring into the horizon. This setting may bookend the film but this is not a cyclical moment – not quite.  That red dot has appeared in full glory, a sanguine sun smacked into the middle of the frame, a sublime symbol of Japanese tradition. It’s a moment of triumph – the dark haze of uncertainty that opened up *Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters* is now lit in splendour by the very thing Yukio Mishima stood for, and sought to revive. The character, post-seppuku, collapses to the floor. But that fleeting moment – where ‘the bright disc of his sun soared up behind his eyelids and exploded’ – that moment is all that matters.",

        "text": "Note: There will be spoilers\n\nWhen I was a boy, my father sat us down in front of our little TV with the old VHS player and decided we were going to watch this old movie.  My brother and I complained at first but as the story progressed we became enthralled.  It was the story of seven warriors, samurai, who come together to protect a village from bandits.  This movie was of course the Seven Samurai, one of the greatest achievements in filmmaking.\nAkira Kurosawa, the director of the film, often achieves (deserved) accolades for his works, but I do not think the true greatness of Shinobu Hashimoto. Hashimoto will go down in history as one of the greatest film writers of all time.  Starting with his work on the film Rashomon, a story of people’s memories and popularizing the idea of the unreliable narrator in film; most famously used in the 1999 film Fight Club. His films in the jidaigeki (period films in japanese) genre are his most remember: Seven Samurai, Throne of Blood (a adaptation of Shakespeare’s Macbeth), Harakiri, The Hidden Fortress (the inspiration for George Lucas’s 1977 classic Star Wars), all of these films are rightfully put on many “Great Films List.”\n\nBut even more than his ability to craft a story, the earnestness of his deeply human philosophy pervades Hashimoto’s films.  Hashimoto has an obvious and deep disdain for the Bushido code.  Hashimoto would have been in his twenties during the height of the Japanese Empire and would have seen first hand the idea of Bushido used to convince pilots to commit suicide runs, Kamikaze, to attack enemy ships.  The use of Bushido to convince men to die for an uncaring, self serving ruling class headed by the Japanese Emperor.\n\nIn his film, Harakiri, the protagonist declares to the supposedly honorable samurai around him that, “After all, this thing we call samurai honor is ultimately nothing but a facade.” That in the time of wandering ronin (masterless samurai), that to force one to commit ritual sacrifice in order to dissuade others from coming to their home is unnecessarily cruel, especially coming from those who are still able to serve due to pure luck.  In Seven Samurai, the head of the group of samurai shaves his head (it is dishonorable to remove your top knot as a samurai) in order to rescue a child held hostage.  He recognizes the foolishness of putting this idea of “honor” before lives of people, no matter their caste.  Later in the film, Kikuchiyo reveals himself to have been the son of the farmer after accusing the samurai of being the other side of the coin of bandits.\n\n“But then who made them such beasts?” He demands of the samurai, “You did! You samurai did it! You burn their villages! Destroy their farms! Steal their food! Force them to labour! Take their women! And kill them if they resist! So what should farmers do?”  The samurai, who’s stories we’ve heard as honorable men, sacrificing for the greater good, are mostly thugs with swords.\n\nThis rejection of the Bushido code comes from the place of Hashimoto’s best quality: the belief in the inherent dignity of life.  His film Ikiru, about a civil servant who realizes he has cancer and decides to build a park for the local children (I wonder if anyone in the writers room of the TV show Parks and Rec thought of this film while writing the first couple seasons?), demands that we understand how precious and singular this gift is.  “Misfortune teaches us the truth. Your cancer has opened your eyes to your own life. People are fickle and shallow.” A character tells Kanji, the protagonist, “We only realize how beautiful life is when we face death. And even then, few of us realize it. The worst among us know nothing of life until they die.”\n\nIn the film Samurai Rebellion, a samurai decides to fight against his uncaring lord after he watches his son fall in love with a woman he was forced to marry. The film ends with him dying as he calls out to his granddaughter, “No one will ever know the story of your father and mother now.  Tomi, it can’t be helped. But let me say one word.  Just one word.  When you grow up, become a woman just like your mother.  And marry a man just like your father.  Be sure to do that. Marry a man just like your father.”\n\nEven evil men cannot escape the actions they take that counter this philosophy. The Sword of Doom follows a evil man who kills without thought and uncaring and cold to everyone.  The film ends with him becoming insane, haunted by all those he killed.\n\nThis inherent dignity, the need for love and compassion, are something Hashimoto demanded of us as we watch his films.  His distaste for authority and hierarchy run counter to a current social trend of bowing to strong men, giving into beasts,  declaring children and the dispossessed “enemies of the state.”\n\nAnd what do we do?  The same as the characters in these films.  We fight.  We fight to our last breath.  We strike down all those that thrive on hate and violence.  But we never revel in that violence.  We realize that each enemy is a person with that same dignity that we have.  The heroes of Hashimoto often commit terrific acts of violence, but it is never done with joy.\n\nKembai, the head samurai in Seven Samurai, demands of the villagers, “This is the nature of war: By protecting others, you save yourselves. If you only think of yourself, you’ll only destroy yourself.”  This sentiment is echoed by another character in 2017’s The Last Jedi, “We’re going to win this war not by fighting what we hate, but saving what we love.”\n\n\n\nThe novelist in Ikiru declared “How tragic that man can never realize how beautiful life is until he is face to face with death.”  I have to believe that Hashimoto lived his life knowing that beauty.",

        "author": "kidneybean34",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/9185gc/dallas_buyers_clubs_amazing_pacing/",
        "text": "So I just watched Dallas Buyer's Club and one thing that stuck out to me was how great the pacing was in it. I finished watching the movie at about 12:15 AM and when I started it, I wasn't sure if I could watch it the whole way through since I was extremely tired and it was a 2 hour movie. But, the movie ended up going by super fast. I didn't check the time of it once and when I realized it was nearing the end, I was sad because I was enjoying it so much. I mean seriously, I don't think I've seen a movie with better pacing than this one. Maybe it's just me, but I thought it was great. There wasn't one moment in the movie where I felt bored or uninterested. From the very start, I was invested in the story. The beginning held my interest because I wanted to see how Ron would react when he found out he had AIDS and afterwards, it was interesting to see how he dealt with his situation. Then, seeing him go through the process of accepting it, going to the hospital, trying treatment etc. The movie didn't stop being enjoyable or intriguing after that. He sought real treatment, he met Ray, he started up the business. The entire way through, I was invested in the story and there wasn't a single dull moment. By the time the credits rolled I was pretty sad because I didn't want it to be over. I just was astonished at how well the pacing was and I think a lot of movies can take something from it. \n\nOf course, everything else about the movie was really well done, too. The acting was spot on. I just watched Interstellar a few days ago and I decided to check out Dallas Buyers Club because I was impressed with Matthew Mcconaughey and wanted to see what else he had to offer. Boy, was I impressed. He really is a great actor and now I just want to watch everything he's been in. He just gets right into the character and delivers such a believable performance. He has the acting talent that is very subtle and you don't really notice until you actually think about it. He isn't doing anything insane or crazy but he really just makes you believe he is the character that he's playing. When watching Dallas Buyer's Club, it was hard to believe that Matthew Mcconaughey was anyone other than Ron Woodroof. And I can't forget about Jared Leto as Rayon. I feel like a lot of people sleep on his performance because Matthew Mcconaughey's is so good. But he shines just as brightly here. He does the same type of thing as Matthew Mcconaughey, where you can't believe he's anyone other than Rayon. He really just was a perfect fit for the role and he did everything right with it. \n\nOne last thing I wanted to mention is the significance of clowns in this movie. There's a few times where clowns are shown quite purposefully in this movie. Like when Ron is sitting in the stands, drunk and he sees the rodeo clown or the clown figurine in the motel room. They seem to be placed in the film on purpose of course and I just wondered if anyone has any theories as to why. Whats their significance and what are they supposed to symbolize here? My thoughts were that clowns are used to represent the AIDS virus. How once you have it, that's all anyone sees you as and how like Ron said, you're married to it forever. When people learn someone has AIDS, they only see them as having a disease and not as the real person they are. So maybe it symbolizes what Ron went through. His buddies only cared that he had a disease and treated him poorly because of it. Ron's whole world became dictated by this disease. So clowns represent this because clowns are putting on a fake face and have makeup and outfits to mask who they really are, similar to how AIDS masks who Ron really is to those around him. That's just my thoughts. Let me know what you guys think though! ",

        "text": "I finally got around to watching Deliverance. While I was thoroughly entertained by the movie, particularly for the ambition and dedication to the \"action\" sequences by the actors, I couldn't help but feel that it was an overall very shallow movie without any allegories/themes/agency. \n\nThis isn't to say that I think all movies should have strong, underlying themes, but the issue I have with Deliverance is how many avenues they seem to begin to explore...but just don't. Here's a list of examples, from the lens of the conflict type, of how the themes are never fully realized.\n\n**The conflict and theme:** Eco-gothic horror (man against nature)- Civilized society and how the arrogance of humanity is humbled by nature's ability to destroy.\n**Evidence:** A dam (civilized society) is about to destroy the Chatooga river which is the reason why the protagonists are there - to further exploit nature's beauty before it's gone. Furthermore, there's a bit of an undertone that Bobby and Drew are unseasoned city-slickers and naive to think they could tackle the harshness of the river's journey. Lewis foreshadows how society is going to collapse and the importance of survival skills to combat mother nature while Bobby counters by pointing out how civilized society provides the means to create comfort in the wilderness. All this seemingly sets up mother nature being an antagonist of the movie and how the men would be put to the test to fight it.\n**Where this theme falls apart:** Nature is not at all the antagonist of the movie. The conflict is completely in motion due the actions of the Mountain Men. In fact, it seems like the protagonists, not just Lewis, are uncannily good at navigating the waters and they would have had a fun, but uneventful trip had it not been for the Mountain Men. \n\n**The conflict and theme:** Masculinity and responsibility (Man against self) - What does it mean to be a \"man?\"\n**Evidence:** Lewis is ostensibly an epitome of masculinity. He's brash, decisive, and self-sufficient. Ed is the opposite. He seems more thoughtful and because of that, suffers from \"Buck Fever.\" But he eventually needs to take up Lewis' mantle.\n**Where this theme falls apart:** All over the place? I'm just have no idea what the movie is trying to say about this. Lewis is effective when he's able to be, even if he is also kind of a dick. So his version of masculinity is and stays ideal. Ed doesn't really get over his \"Buck Fever\", even in the face of his own death, so there's not really a reconciliation in the idea that he evolved to be a \"man.\" There's no real sense if thoughtfulness trumps decisiveness or vice versa. \n**The conflict and theme:** Class conflict (Man against man) - The cosmopolitan protagonists are humbled by hillbillies. \n**Evidence:** None of the protagonists are respectful of the backwoods locals. Bobby is particularly dismissive. Maybe we misjudge them or we should sympathize for them?\n**Where this theme falls apart:** Some locals are good, obviously some are bad. This essentially means that there's nothing to say about the group, only about individuals. The movie seems to even go out of its way to say, \"don't feel sorry for the locals. They even hate their own town.\"\n\nAnyways, this was hastily written out. Am I missing something about the movie? Do others also think the Deliverance has very weak themes?",

        "author": "mickey5525",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/916o1e/indepth_analysis_of_the_truman_show/",
        "text": "Hello, all. \nThis is from my personal website. I don't want to self-promote, but I do want to start a discussion and possibly get some feedback, so I'm not posting the link to my website, but copy and pasting the article here. It's quite long, bare in mind. \n\n_____________________________________________________\n\nBack in 1998, ‘The Truman Show’ shocked the public with how funny, heartfelt, and thought-provoking it is. The audience loved it, critics loved it, and it today it remains an endless classic.\n\nAnd that stands to reason. ‘The Truman Show’ is, by all accounts, a masterpiece. Built on a brilliant premise, with great direction, flawless editing and cinematography, and an amazing performance by Jim Carrey, ‘The Truman Show’ doesn’t really have many imperfections. It checks all boxes.\n\nIn an ideal world, a good film must do three things with its story: it must be accessible, understandable and interesting to the generic viewer, it must have a strong and developed character to stand in the middle of it, and it must be layered. Most good films fit one of these requirements, some fit two, but it’s really rare that a movie’s storytelling is so good that it fits all three. ‘The Truman Show’ does.\n\nAnd it’s that last point, the layering, that has people rewatching and talking about the movie to this day. ‘The Truman Show’ is filled with thought-provoking ideas, meanings, metaphors, Easter eggs, themes, and motifs. What follows is a guide to a better understanding of those things within ‘The Truman Show’. Keep in mind, this will be fairly compact and the points will overlap; there is so much to talk about this film and one could easily write a book about it; it’s impossible to fit everything in one article.\n\nAnd obviously: massive spoilers. \n\nGod and Religion\n\nChristianity and God are explored a lot throughout ‘The Truman Show’. Christof, the creator of the show, is, ultimately, the God of the world Truman lives in. He has created the world and manipulated it to serve his desires. He is also Truman’s personal God, standing as an all-mighty figure that (literally) watches from above. By the end of the film, Christof even talks from the sky to Truman, furthering the idea that he is both the God of the world and Truman’s personal deity.\n\nChristof’s act of trying to drown the boat goes back hundreds of years and has been explored through many olden myths and legends. Christof is the all powerful being, the one that can literally control the weather, trying to challenge the ordinary man and prevent them from achieving their goals.\n\nThe name is also significant here: Christof, an iteration of Christ, or even better, a play on words meaning Christ-Off. It can be argued that Christof is in fact a fake God (Christ-Off), doing things in the manner of a deity, but ultimately doing things no deity should ever do. He is everything a God can do to a world, everything a God will do, but nothing they should do.\n\nThere isn’t much support to this thesis, however. It’s evident throughout the film that, to some extent, Christof genuinely cares about Truman. The creator may be somewhat evil and wrong, but he is no hypocrite: he truly believes that what he is doing ‘gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions’ and that he is being kind to Truman by actually doing him a huge favor. Christof is, in many ways, not only a God to Truman, but also a father: the way he speaks to him in the final scene, the way he gently touches the screen when Truman is sleeping, and the fact that he has literally gotten rid of Truman’s ‘actual’ father. Christof says ‘I was watching when you were born. I was watching when you took your first step. I watched you on your first day of school.’ and in some strange, twisted way, Christof is the father figure Truman always wanted and never knew he had.\n\nAll this is ultimately a take on society and the way we perceive religion. The film is actually highly critical of Christianity. It states that IF there was a real God, then our reality is ultimately fake. Nothing is random, nothing is our choice, everything is controlled by something that we’re not even sure exists. Truman’s reality is completely controlled, as stated in the next point, and the film goes on about the fact that our reality may be the same. Every time we step outside, we are at God’s hands. Every time it rains, it’s not a coincidence. We are constantly being watched, listened, and, most importantly, controlled. ‘The Truman Show’ is expanding on the idea that God may be a puppeteer and we may simply be the puppets; we blindly trust the puppeteer, not even knowing he is there, and all reality is fake.\n\nTrue Reality vs. Fake Reality\n\nThis nicely blends into another theme deeply explored within ‘The Truman Show’, which is the actual reality of things vs. the fake life that we all lead. The film smartly underlines and explores the idea that all of us desperately need something real. The film states that, most simply put, we all lead fake lives, all controlled and manipulated by the media, the people around us, and possibly a higher power. Nothing and nobody we see is the complete and utter truth.\n\nWhich explains why people watch ‘The Truman Show’. It also explains why the world Truman is living in is so similar to the actual outside world. Many ask why there even was a travel agency is Truman’s world; since he’s been there forever and since his entire idea of the universe is 100% manipulated by Christof, why even mention the existence of planes? Why not tell Truman that nothing even exists beyond Seaheaven? Wouldn’t that guarantee him staying within the show forever?\n\nBut that wouldn’t work, would it? Because the people, the viewers, need something real. That is why the world Truman is living in is ultimately the same world all of us are living in. The audience wants to see exactly that, just more authentic and with someone genuine living in it. That is also why ‘The Truman Show’ was such a success: because Truman is the only genuinely real thing in the entire world. His environment is controlled, his life is manipulated, but Truman is 100% himself throughout all this. That’s why people want to watch him; they need an escape from their own lie and into someone else’s life: someone who is real. Even his name is a play on words: Truman = true man.\n\nTruman begins his quest as a lamp falls from outside his house. The lamp is named Sirius, representing the brightest star, the one travelers use for guidance, and symbolizes the beginning of Truman’s adventure within his own world. The film ends with Truman puncturing the walls of the world or, to put it in another way, quite literally puncturing through his own personal fourth wall. I find this entire quest, starting from the falling light and ending with the puncture of the wall, to be one of the best uses of irony in the history of cinema. Truman’s world is the only real thing to everyone on the entire planet, but Truman himself, the only real person, the only person to actually live in this world, eventually finds it to be fake. So ultimately, reality doesn’t exist. Everything is fake.\n\nThe Allegory of the Cave\n\nAfter Truman finds the boundaries of his reality, he has a talk with Christof. What the creator tells the man is something that wonderfully summarizes another idea explored throughout ‘The Truman Show’: the allegory of the cave.\n\nThe allegory of the cave is an extremely well-thought-out experiment and smarter people have done a way better job explaining it than the author of this article can. This video is a good in-depth explanation of what exactly it is. But here is the shorter version: the allegory theories a group of people who are stuck in a cave their entire life, seeing only shadows of real life projected on the wall in front of them. If those people were to get out of the cave and see the real world, see the people behind the shadows, it would be too overwhelming and they would want to go back to what they are used to.\n\nA great experiment trying to conclude that ‘ignorance is bliss’. ‘The Truman Show’ is ultimately the exact same experiment, just on a much larger scale. Seahaeven is the cave and the people in it are the shadows. There is much beyond that, there is a ‘real’ world, but Truman doesn’t know it.\n\nWhen the man finally does find out, he speaks to Christof and the creator tells him that ‘There is no more truth out there than there is for the world I created for you. The same lies, the same deceit. But in my world, you have nothing to fear.’\n\nChristof gives Truman a choice: stay in the world and stay ignorant or choose to face reality. The former is much simpler choice; this way, Truman would never have to face the reality he never knew existed. The latter, however, presents Truman with the opportunity to finally, for the first time in his life, see the truth; a truth he never even knew was out there.\n\nTruman, of course, chooses the latter. He chooses to leave the cave. Truman, like everyone else in the world, wants to live and experience what’s real. Ironically, to everyone else, him and the world he lives in are the only real things. To him however, everyone else and the world they live in are the only ultimate reality. No one really prefers the cave, even though it’s the simpler option. Everyone wants reality, but ironically, one person’s reality is another person’s cave.\n\nThe Entertainment Industry\n\nAnother idea vastly explored throughout ‘The Truman Show’ is toxic entertainment.  Stepping away from the fact that this film literally foreshadowed the upcoming epidemic of reality TV (Big Brother is just a fake version of ‘The Truman Show’) and stepping away from Truman himself for a bit, there is much to understand about toxic entertainment from the way the show functions and the fanbase around it.\n\nThe final line of the movie is ‘Let’s see what else is on’ by a generic viewer of ‘The Truman Show’. This digs into the idea that the show is just one of many; ultimately, it made no difference. It’s toxic, it’s just another method of escapism, it’s jealously, anger, lies, and truth all in one. Even after what was presumably the biggest television event ever (Truman’s escape), the world changes in no way. People change in no way. Entertainment continues and leaves no dent in society whatsoever.\n\nThe way the show itself functions is another brilliant critique at the entertainment industry. The best example of this would be the actress, Hannah Gill, playing the character of Meryl Burbank, Truman’s wife. She has voluntarily put herself in a position very similar to that of Truman. Hannah Gill is in the spotlight of ‘The Truman Show’ every single day and living a fake life every single day, all for the sake of money and fame. This is a critique of Hollywood: different creators giving their lives away for fame and money. To take this to an extremity, Hannah Gill can be considered a literal prostitute as she has sex with Truman on camera. There is even a clause in her contract stating that any time she engages in intimate activities with Truman, she gets a huge bonus. Hannah Gill has given up everything: her body, her mind, her personality, her whole life just to achieve her ‘dreams’. She is not different than Truman, expect that she is living the fake life voluntarily and getting something in return. And morally speaking, that is even worse.\n\nMedia Control\n\nFinally, ‘The Truman Show’ is also a commentary on the control that media puts on individuals and the society. This wonderfully foreshadows the world’s current political state, but that’s a completely different subject.\n\nTo begin with, the individual. We’ve concluded that Truman’s life and being is monitored and controlled, but what about his personality? Christof himself says that they needed to figure out a way to keep Truman on the island. They decided to alter his fears and dedications by killing off his father from the show by drowning in the ocean. This gives Truman a lifetime fear of water and an inability to leave Seaheaven. Even Truman’s beliefs and fears are controlled by a deity; this is a beautiful allegory on our world. Many of our ideals, fears, dedications, even our entire drive can sometimes be controlled and altered by the media. The things we see and experience can control our lives and change them forever. It’s surely not a drastic as with Truman, but the idea is the same: something seemingly random happens to us and we change because of it. That may, however, not be random, it may be controlled by the media, just as it wasn’t with Truman, and the whole point of it may be to change our views.\n\nJust remember the Facebook scandal from less than a year ago and you will get this point.\n\n(Some other great foreshadowing is the fact that Truman has no privacy whatsoever: his entire life is monitored and recorded without his knowing.)\n\nBut going into the society, media control is once again presented as a big problem throughout ‘The Truman Show’, starting with advertisement. As mentioned explicitly throughout the film, ‘The Truman Show’ actually runs 24/7 with no commercial break. They mention that the only way to make profit is through product placement. Some of the best moments in the movies are actually the ‘unnoticeable’ ads within Truman’s life: the cocoa powder, the shredder, the lawn mower. This is once again a clever commentary on our society: profit made by product placement leading to the constant control of what we buy through the media.\n\nFurthermore, one of the most brilliant (and overlooked) scenes in ‘The Truman Show’ is actually the first time we observe the control center. In Seaheaven, this is the moment when Truman meets his ‘father’. In this moment we see Christof directing the show: picking the cameras and the angles, choosing when to cut, cuing the music, etc. The scene in itself is actually amazing and, once again, foreshadows the future of reality TV. This moment illustrates how through smart camera placement, editing, music, etc., show-runners can make any real-life moment appear not the way it actually is, but the way they want it to appear; there is no raw truth in entertainment. The way Truman’s meeting with his ‘father’ was shown on TV was actually much more melodramatic than the actual encounter. Christof manipulates the audience’ feelings, gaining the emotional reaction he needs from them and getting higher ratings. Again, something all reality TV does nowadays.\n\nConclusion\n\nOne of the best trivia facts about ‘The Truman Show’ is that the creators of the movie wanted to install a hidden camera in every theater the film was showing. During one of the moments in the film where we watch the world watching the show, the theater would stop the film and suddenly start transmitting the hidden camera; this way, the viewers would see themselves within the movie. Shortly after, they would cut the fee and continue playing the actual film.\n\n‘The Truman Show’ isn’t a commentary on some fake society within the story. The film is about us. About how God controls our lives. How we don’t have any free will. How we all seek a reality because our lives are, ultimately, fake. We all watch meaningless entertainment to feel something real, but it ultimately leaves absolutely no impact on us. All of us want to leave the cave, we want to find some reality, but we are not even aware that we are in the cave. We are constantly being watched, listened, controlled, and manipulated. We sell ourselves to an industry that makes no difference. We make no difference. Free will and reality are illusions.\n\n‘The Truman Show’ is actually much more pessimistic and critical than people realize. The film has so much to it, so much to take from, so much to learn. We should cherish, save, study, and love ‘The Truman Show’. It’s worth it.",

They are working to restore and preserve 50 classic African films, and crucially bring them back to African audiences.\n\nI cannot admire Scorsese enough, as well as those other organizations involved in this. We really need more schemes like this for countries and regions that have been overlooked, and have films at risk of being lost forever.\n\nI would love to know people's thoughts on whether or not this is the best way to protect and promote African Cinema - it seems to cover a lot of ground, with a Hollywood name ad renowned cinephile letting an African organisation taking the reins, with the might of UNESCO supporting the next stage of the project once those involved have decided on the films, and have been able to locate surviving negatives.\n\nPeople need to be exposed to more African films, and this seems to be the most effective way of doing so. I would love to know people's thoughts, and hear about your exposure to African Cinema - if it was up to you, which films should be targeted by the AFHP?",

This technique became more explicit with films like Sky Captain and The World of Tomorrow, right through to Speed Racer itself.\n\nThinking about these films lead me to some kind of conclusion about style as nostalgia for imagined realities (perhaps opening a semiotic conversation), but the technique isn't used exclusively for adaptations. For example, Ridley Scott's Blade Runner seems to exemplify a stylistic approach which creates meaning through the narrative. Even further back thinking about impressionistic films like The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari set up an imagined reality through its stylistic techniques.\n\nThis obviously can lead down many rabbit holes of discussion, but I wondered how you all felt about this question?

Sure it’s got a dumb plot, but I think Woo’s style and direction actually complements the stupidity quite nicely in an odd way. It’s so over the top in its style that I don’t mind the plot holes.  The action is pretty good, it’s a lot of fun, and the soundtrack is also good. So why do this film get so much hate? Not saying it’s a great film or anything, just a very fun movie that gets treated like it’s terrible. ",

From the first shot of the office where  Cassius  is interviewing, where the lighting of the exterior cubicles are blue and the manager's office is yellow, it drew my eyes immediately. Another shot of Cassius working in the foreground while in the background room where papers are flying chaotically while he is quietly interacting with his coworkeres. Cassius's picture of his father is changing to reflect the character's conscious. The transition of  Cassius's life to an upperstyle where the old furniture and appliance's are fold and unfolding to reveal a new apartment and life. A  \"WorryFree\"  commercial with Wes Anderson like color composition then the scene cuts to real life Oakland where it's gritty and degrading. The mini movie played to Cassius is a Michael Gondry parody to show the villain's view on how he view's people while playing it casual to how serious/insane the subject is. \n\nWhether you agree or disagree on the story he chose to tell through a mixture of grit and surrealism on the subject of unions and rotting capitalism, while leading to bizarre unexpected places. I'm going to remember a lot the shots for some time and I'm excited to see his next movie. What did you think about Boot Riley's film making? Derivative?

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/90v9gi/amit_dutta_the_frontier_of_modern_indian/",
        "text": "( I recently found this article which introduces the  most important experimental artist from India. His works strangely gave  me the vibes of Sergei Parjonav's movies and Ozu's Transcendental  stillness. So I compelled to share this article with this wonderful sub.  So, I edited out some parts for the better textual introduction to  dutta's films.)\n\n  Cinema  can either be that of representation — of one’s thoughts and  understanding of the world or the self through characters, plots,  relationships, images, sounds and more. It might be exciting in the  first viewing but soon exhausts itself into well-formed ideas in the  minds of viewers and becomes tiring or repetitive in even a second  viewing. Audiences of such a cinema can either agree or disagree with  the ideas distilled from the work, and the presence of the work ends  there. Because, in the end, it gets replaced by the ideas it purports to  convey.\n\nThere is cinema  of another kind, which might use similar ingredients to come into being,  but where all the material is oriented not towards representing an idea  but exploring the nature of the human condition. This kind of cinema  never gets simplified into received ideas, but takes the viewers along  into a journey to explore love, compassion, violence, colour, darkness,  temporality, words, movement, stillness, etc.\n\nDutta’s  is cinema of the second kind, of exploration. Exploration of the  traditions of painting, sculpting, storytelling, interrelationship of  the arts, the sounds of nature, layered textures of human relationships,  and many such tender and essential phenomena. The exploration takes  place with an extremely refined cinematic technique, the imaginative  bringing together of sound textures with visual elements, the subtle use  of gradations of light, of tonalities of colours interspersed with the  brilliant use of a written script or subtitle as the nexus of sound and  image.\n\nDutta’s  explorations are basically in two directions. He explores the history of  cinema itself in his films (as in his diploma film ksh-tra-jna) and  second, he explores other artistic traditions and the lifestyles around  them. He thus succeeds in posing questions to both cinema and the art  form he explores, “Can we think of spaces like the school in Hermann  Hesse’s The Glass Bead Game, which elevates students from immediate  reality and helps them see nature and culture as a single interlocked  ecosystem? Can we reconnect with nature and our own roots in an organic  way? Can we imagine film schools that embrace the best of human  tradition in all fields of knowledge?”\n\nHis  comparatively recent film The Unknown Craftsman is a search to  understand how the episteme (shastra) of temple architecture was brought  into play by the techne (shilp kaushal) of the craftsmen of the Kangra  Valley in Himachal Pradesh when they designed and constructed the temple  of Masroor.\n\nThe  protagonist, a craftsman, is searching for ways to construct a temple  that reflects the totality of existence as an ideal temple should do. He  journeys into nature to find the wisdom to create. It is in this  loneliness that he is able to catch the delicate fibres of whispers not  only from nature but from his own understanding of architecture. The  film beautifully makes one realise that the nuances of traditional  knowledge unfold more clearly amidst nature. It is as if nature holds  the key to the vyanjana, the suggestions inherent in such knowledge. Or  the other way round. As viewers we feel we are between two times: a time  when the temple is yet to be constructed and a time when the temple is  already up. Dutta doesn’t propose any final answer to the question of  such an interplay, but invites us to visit the locus where such an  interplay is unfolding and involves us sensuously in the micro-dialogues  in the minds of not only craftsmen but also the users of temples,  churches and such spaces.\n\nHis  film on the 18th century Pahadi painter from Guler, the eponymous  Nainsukh, delves deep into not only the multilayered beauty of  Nainsukh’s miniatures but also into the process of a form such as  miniature painting with its many layers of beauty, history, music and  rasas — shringar (erotic) to hasya (amusement). In this film one sees a  dialogical relationship between two art forms: the miniature paintings  of Nainsukh and the cinema of Amit Dutta. Instead of illustrating the  paintings, the film undergoes a radical transformation and almost  becomes a metaphor for the paintings. His comparatively recent film The  Unknown Craftsman is a search to understand how the episteme (shastra)  of temple architecture was brought into play by the techne (shilp  kaushal) of the craftsmen of the Kangra Valley in Himachal Pradesh when  they designed and constructed the temple of Masroor. As Dutta says, “Now  that all the tools are close at hand, can the filmmaker produce and  distribute like a traditional craftsman?”\n\nThe  salient feature of the cinema of exploration is that it always tries to  find new ways of coming into being. The traditional term for this  endless inventiveness is marg and such arts called margi. The range of  experimentation in cinema such as Amit’s is wide. On one hand, he has  made films like Kramasha, based on a portion of his novel, Kaljayi  Kambakht, which he started writing when he was a student in Pune’s FTII.  The film’s narrative moved in jerks and yet a certain kind of lucidity  was achieved, so that the whole was experienced as a flowing tale of  music, sounds and images. His film with the well-known modern urban  painter Paramjeet Singh, Seventh Walk, is a meditative look into the  relationship between a walk in nature and the movement of brush on  canvas, the transformation of foliage into painted colours. The film has  the most wonderful long shots which sensitise the viewer to the sounds  and imagery of the dense flora and their subtle effect on the mind of  Paramjeet Singh. It’s a long film, which unfolds slowly like the alaap  of a Dhrupad.\n\nIt is no  coincidence that the film’s music is given by the extremely talented  veena player of the Dagar Gharana, Mohi Bahauddin Dagar. Says Dutta,  “The focus is on mental attention and how the actors have to maintain  their equilibrium to guide — or not guide — the attention of the viewer.  For wide-angle close-ups, the minute gestures of the face should  complement its distortion: how much should an eyebrow rise; what angle  should the head slant; how to control the angle of the gaze.”\n\nDutta’s  cinema has been received with tremendous curiosity and respect the  world over. He has had retrospectives in Centre de Pompidous, Paris;  Berkley Museum and Pacific Film Archive, University of California;  Oberhousen Film Festival, LAC Museum in Lugano, Switzerland; IFFK  Kerala; and elsewhere. He is a rare film-maker who has also written  several books besides his novel: a book on cinema, Many Questions to  Myself (published in Hindi as Khud se Kuchh Sawal), and a book on artist  Jangarh Singh Shyam, Invisible Web. He has also made a film on Jangarh  Singh Shyam, shot in the village where this Pardhan painter lived before  he came to Bhopal and later committed suicide in Japan.\n\nDutta’s  films seem to make palpable what French master filmmaker Robert Bresson  wrote in his book Notes on the Cinematographer: ‘The omnipotence of  rhythms. Nothing is durable but what is caught up in rhythms. Bend  content to form and sense to rhythms.’\n\nFor more films from Dutta: \n\nKramasha short film: [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hlyowrMY3qQ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hlyowrMY3qQ)\n\n[https://mubi.com/cast/amit-dutta](https://mubi.com/cast/amit-dutta)",

        "text": "I originally wrote this over on my blog, so if you want that more complete version with embedded videos and pictures, it can be found here: https://danieljh13.wixsite.com/website/single-post/2018/07/21/The-Beauty-and-Artistry-of-Call-Me-By-Your-Name\n\nCall Me By Your Name is, for me, THE most impactful and beautiful piece of naturalistic film-making I have seen in recent years, if not ever. Ever since I have seen it late 2017, this film has stuck with me. I have seen it 4 times at this point, and each viewing has enhanced my appreciation of the film. It has instantly become one of my all-time favorites. But what causes the impact that this film has? Well frankly, it is everything. This film is the perfect combination of artistic craft and personal emotion, of pathos and logos. The movie is such a masterpiece because it is the convergence of perfect technical construction, performance, theme, writing, and presentation. I may seem hyperbolic, but I am only being honest here. Let me break down (Rather long-windedly) a few of the things that I feel make the movie so brilliant. \n\nNATURALISM AND VISUAL STORYTELLING DETAIL\n\nIt seems that in the age of the internet, it seems that in terms of cinematography the only thing that gets praised is flashy camera techniques. Sure, there are plenty of cool scenes captured in one long take, with plenty of camera movement that makes the audience go \"ooohhh, that looks cool!\" But how many of those shots, how much of that camera movement, actually improves the film? Does it help tell the story? Does it communicate information about the feelings and thoughts of the characters? Often, no. But that is not the case here. Instead of focusing on style, director Luca Guadagnino and cinematographer Sayombhu Mukdeeprom create substance and embed meaning into even the simplest of scenes through simplicity. The majority of the film is composed of rather basic medium to long shots, with minimal close-ups. These shots are lengthy, but usually very simple. Often it will be as simple as a static shot that shifts slightly into another static shot. Often the shots are so minimalistic that you won't even realize that they have gone on for minutes at a time. Meanwhile, each camera movement within this lengthy shot, every character movement within the frame, the space between characters, all of these things are used to subtly communicate information to you or to add layers and depth to the information already being communicated by the characters. The naturalism here adds to the experience because it does not break your immersion in the intimacy of these moments, it feels private and believable, like you are a fly on the wall experiencing these stories. For example: \n\n \nThere is a moment about halfway through the movie where the main character Elio finally confesses his feelings for Oliver. He does this while they are standing and talking in a town square next to a monument. Their conversation plays out in one deliberately long take (video linked above), and the camera tells us all we need to know about the characters feelings. The camera is pretty stationary as they begin their conversation, parking their bikes and making small talk. At some point Oliver begins to walk away from Elio around to the other side of the monument and the camera begins to pan with him as he walks away, leaving part of the monument they are standing next to separating them. Then Elio hints at his feelings for Oliver with the line \"if you only only knew how little I know about the things that matter.\" Oliver stops in his tracks, as does the camera, with this barrier serving as a geographical visualization of the emotional barrier between the two of them at the moment. Then they both begin to walk, crossing opposite sides of the monument and the camera pans with them again again. At the scariest point in the conversation for Elio, where Oliver pauses before responding which leaves Elio repeating to himself \"because I wanted you to know...\" as if he wants to make both himself and Oliver believe it, Oliver is completely eclipsed by the statue, visualizing Elio's fear that he might have lost Oliver forever by telling him these things. But then Oliver emerges and they meet on the other side of the monument and the camera holds, lingering on them drawing close to each other on the other side of the moment as they are also  drawn together emotionally.\n \nCould discussing it in this level of detail be considered over-analysis? Perhaps. Of course I would never dream to proclaim that these are the objective concrete meanings of these particular cinematic choices, but this is simply a description of the information that was embedded within this scene by the choices in cinematography, shot composition, and use of space. This is purely visual storytelling, communicating the emotional distance between these two characters as well as their fears and anxieties without a word of dialogue and while feeling completely naturalistic. And yet, he does this while still keeping every shot looking lush, gorgeous and layered. For example, look at the aesthetic beauty of a shot like this: \n\n \nThis level of detail is present throughout the film, as Guadagnino expertly weaves subtle emotions and detail into every single shot to indicate characters thoughts, all while trusting his audience and avoiding flashy techniques that would reduce the subtlety. For example, at one point Elio comments on the fact that Oliver wears a necklace with the star of David, and that he owns one like it but does not wear it. Oliver then inquires why Elio does not do wear it. Elio casually remarks \"my mother says we are Jews of discretion.\" Oliver then replies \"well, I guess that works for your mother.\" At that point, the scene ends. A few minutes later, Elio is seen wearing his own Star of David. The film doesn't wink at the audience and draw attention to it, but Elio wears it until the end of the film, showing his willingness to be more open and accepting of his identity both as a Jew and as someone who is bisexual.\n \nAnd of course, I would be remiss to discuss the cinematography and detail of this film without discussing its final shot. To do this requires spoilers, so if you haven't seen the film then I advise you skip down to the next section. At the end of the film, Oliver has gone back to America after the summer and we flash forward to Christmas. Elio answers a phone call and it is Oliver, announcing his engagement with a girl who Oliver had been on a break from seeing during that summer. While of course happy for Oliver, Elio is left heartbroken that the one person he has had a true connection with has moved on, that this means they will never get to be together. He goes and sits by the fire, and the final shot of the film is a close-up of Elio's face as he sits there, processing his grief. The shot holds relentlessly as the credits roll and we see tears stream down his face. The shot holds in close on just Elio, causing the viewer to feel the same heightened emotion and loneliness as the character does in this moment. The shot holds for so long, refusing to pull away and forcing the audience to process their emotions about what they just witnessed in the same way that Elio does in that moment. For this, the final shot is one of the most effective I have ever seen, and deserves all the praise it has received. \n\nINCREDIBLE PERFORMANCES\n\nLook, this section is going to be pretty short just because every single performance in this movie is incredible and deserving of praise. If I was to go into too much detail, I would be writing a book here. But I do want to talk about the two leads for a second. God, Timothee Chalamet  and Armie Hammer have some of the most believable chemistry I have ever seen, and each delivers a career-best performance. Timothee in particular. Every moment of his depiction of Elio is animated, as he uses both the most minute facial expression and the movement of his body (the way he walks, dances, shifts his weight, glances around, even brushes his hand against Oliver) to add layers to his performance and further express the characters emotions when Elio finds himself unable to express them verbally. He was robbed from winning Best Actor at the Oscars, and sells every single moment of teenage infatuation, embarrassment, joy, and heartbreak. Armie Hammer is likewise brilliant, as he compliments Chalamet's youthful expressive energy with a more reserved, contemplative performance that nonetheless conveys the same emotions. He too owns the physicality of his role, as he dances about to express joy, massages Elio in times of pain, or curls up with him in a moment of intimacy. Every member of the supporting cast kills it as well, in particular I want to shout out Michael Stuhlbarg for his role as Elio's father, as he gets to shine in a monologue scene towards the end of the film.\n\nTHEME AND EMOTION\n\nCall Me By Your Name also provides one of the most beautiful thematic messages in recent history. It is an unflinching look at first love, both the joy and heartbreak of it. At the same time, it is more than that. It is also an unapologetic celebration of enthusiastic consensual love. Think about it, when was the last time you saw a movie where the main characters took the time to ask for consent before sex? But in CMBYN Oliver asks \"can I kiss you?\" before reaching over to Elio before they have sex for the first time. It celebrates the idea of safe youthful experimentation in a way that few films do. Normally, in a movie like this you get either a puritanical message that sex = bad (as comically put by Mean Girls, \"don't have sex or you will get pregnant and die\") or a morally murky message common in bro comedies that endorses sex in any and every circumstances, regardless of factors that can inhibit consent. Instead of either of those options, in CMBYN you see a celebration of youthful love, with two consenting parties and parental approval as well. There is no trickery or grey areas here, just two young people in love. Not to mention this film, though depicting a same-sex romance, avoids many tropes of the \"gay romance\" genre. There are no bigoted or disapproving parents, no hate crimes inflicted on the characters, no societal pressure pushing Elio and Oliver apart. Instead, their only enemy, the only antagonist of this film, is time. They only have so long together, and have to choose to make the best of it despite their circumstances.\n \nBut even more than that, this movie is about the importance of love. The importance of putting yourself out there, even though you can get your heart broken. This need to put yourself out there or \"live dangerously\" is in my opinion necessary to truly live, to unlock the greatest rewards of life that can be found in finding someone you connect with like no other. But I cannot  say this any better than the film itself does, so I will just let it do the talking for me. This comes from the second to last scene in the film, as Elio's father attempts to console Elio over Oliver having to leave:  \n \n\"Right now you may not want to feel anything. Maybe you never wanted to feel anything and maybe it’s not me you want to be speak about these things but feel something you obviously did. Look you had a beautiful friendship, maybe more than a friendship. And I envy you. In my place, most parents would hope the whole thing goes away, or pray that their sons land on their feet soon enough. But I am not such a parent. We rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster than we should that we go bankrupt by the age of 30 and have less to offer each time we start with someone new. But to feel nothing so as not to feel anything—what a waste! Have I spoken out of turn? Then I’ll say one more thing it'll clear the air. I may have come close but I never had what you two have. Something always held me back, her stood in the way. How you live your life is your business just remember our hearts and our bodies are given to us only once and before you know it your hearts worn out and as for your body there comes a point when no one looks at it much less wants to come near it. Right now there's sorrow, pain don't kill it and with it the joy you felt.\"\n \nNow that is a message that I feel everyone needs to hear. It is something universal that everyone has been through, and this theme enhances the emotion of the story so much. Truthfully I have wept at at least one point every time I have watched this film, and I am not ashamed to admit it. So much rings true to my own experience, as it does others. Not only does it reflect those experiences, but also makes those experiences easier to process and learn from. Is that not the point of art, to make it easier to understand and process the suffering of life. To put it simply, to make it easier to live?\n\nCONCLUSION\nSo, that is it. Those are just a few of the reasons that I find Call Me By Your Name to be my favorite movie of 2017, one of the best of all time even. It is a display of perfect and confident cinematic craft, from its framing, lighting, use of camera movement, use of space within the frame, and editing. Additionally, every performance is subtle, confident, and expressive. Every word of dialogue is authentic and imbued with emotion (both a credit to the author of the original novel Andre Aciman and the adapter of the screenplay James Ivory). Every emotional and thematic moment ring true due to all of these factors, and you are left with one of those rare cinematic experiences that works on every level. It is not flashy or melodramatic, just authentically all too human. And art like that is truly special, and in my mind is worthy of celebration.",

Almost every character was an unthoughtful portrayal of the whitest malest machismo humanly possible. But it was fun.\n\nThen, I watched as the characters of 55y/o Al Pacino and 14y/o Natalie Portman hooked up, and I almost threw up on the spot. I dont care how complicated her storyline or complex her character became in the movie, its creepy to cast someone underage for that part. This was the year after The Professional. There's no way the performance of this 10thish billed actress was so crucial they needed portman. \n\nHow did any of you that have seen it keep watching after that point?",

I don't much care for one dimensional sadistic henchmen and much more prefer films where the henchmen don't take any pleasure in what they have to do. So they are competent but they don't enjoy sadism and acts of violence.\n\nA few films stand out to be in this regard.\n\n1) Lethal Weapon 3. One gang leader Tyrone is noticeable repulsed by the way the main antagonist  Travis kills one of his own underlings. The underling in question is suffocated in cement. Tyrone shows disgust at this violent murder. \n\n2) Payback (1999) The protagonist (Mel Gibson) is being tortured as he has kidnapped the son of the main antagonist Bronson as is being interrogated for the whereabouts.  One of the  co criminal syndicate leaders Fairfax is brought back from holiday to assist in this torture. Fairfax is appalled by the whole experience, complaining that he wants to get back to swimming with dolphins and tries to persuade Gibson's character to give up the location of the kidnapped son and end the torture.\n\nWhile this might have one think this is a case of good cop bad cop as Bronson by contrast loves to torture, you get the sense that Fairfax although enjoying the luxuries of his criminal lifestyle does not enjoy inflicting pain and sadism and prefers not to think about this side. \n\n3) Reservoir Dogs.  I personally like the moment where Mr White defines himself as a sociopath as opposed to Mr Blonde's psychopathy. So while, Mr White accepts that murder and violence is part of his occupation, he takes no pleasure in it and he resents the fact that he has to work with people who do enjoy this such as the sadist Mr Blonde.\n\n4) In Bruges. There is quite a moving moment where one of the characters a hitman played by Brendan Gleeson reflects on his life of killing people and even though he says that many of those he killed where not very nice people, you can tell that he takes no pleasure in hurting others.\n\nAny-other good movies where there are henchmen who while not good people, don't actually like their role of work (although they are not incompetent) and take no pleasure in sadism and murder.",

The dream sequences from that movie were just so well done. And I was surprised by movies like The Hour of the Wolf and Cries and Whispers! Bergman's portraiture is just amazing. I was wondering what everyone's opinion on Bergman is? Does anyone have favorite films of his that I listed or did not? Why are these your favorites?

While Romeo's major source of conflict is about gaming the system to boost his daughter's grades, Mungui takes care to show the little, yet not readily apparent acts of corruption Romeo is complicit in unknowingly. Whether it is expediting his daughter's assault case or using the influence of his mistress to allow his daughter to write the examination, Romeo has certainly benefited from his reputation and connections, something which the less fortunate, including his mistress don't have access to. While emphasizing on the frailty of the existing system and the ludicrousness of certain laws, Mungui subtly believes that corruption is inevitable in a corrupt society, regardless of a person's supposed honesty.\n\n[https://contentiouscriticism.wordpress.com/2018/07/19/privileged-morality-graduation/](https://contentiouscriticism.wordpress.com/2018/07/19/privileged-morality-graduation/)",

        "text": "https://i.redd.it/t2t3s6is83b11.png\n\nStanley Kubrick is most famous for his epics, but before he was sending men into outer-space he was sending them to early graves in his 1954 noir hit *The Killing*. Clocking in at a brisk 84 minutes, *The Killing*‘s brevity is notable not just for its contrast against Kubrick’s later works, but for its ruthless efficiency in setting up and executing a clockwork heist scenario where each piece is precisely distributed among its ensemble cast. Kubrick manages to do more in under an hour and a half than most crime flicks can hope to convey in two, its pace measured and metered by the repetition of race track footage that marks the time in each of the film’s non-linear strands.\n\nKubrick doesn’t get all of the credit for the merits of the film’s pacing, as he was working from a sharp script from crime novel veteran Jim Thompson (adapting a screenplay from the novel *Clean Break* by Lionel White). From the moment the film opens, the horse track heist is already in progress. *The Killing* jumps back and forth in time, following each of the crooks as they carry out their part of the heist and imbuing each with a strong sense of personality. The ever-stalwart Sterling Hayden plays the unflappable leader of the crew, Johnny, and the characters only get more colorful from there.\n\n Most memorable of the cast is Elisha Cook Jr., ever diminutive as the cuckolded and impotent husband, George, and Marie Windsor as his serpentine wife Sherry. Windsor’s scenes get the lion’s share of Thompson’s most playful and hard-boiled dialogue. Hayden memorably snarls at her: “You’ve got a great big dollar sign where most women have a heart.” Besides being an excellent deliverer, and receiver, of Thompson’s lines, Sherry is the fulcrum the whole meticulous operation begins to tremble under; best-laid plans and all that.\n\nDespite not being as flashy or involved as some later heist films, there’s a great deal of satisfaction to be gleaned from the no-nonsense professionalism of (most of) the players in the heist, their colorful personalities disappearing once it comes time for the job they’ve been working towards. Similarly, there’s a restrained professionalism to the work behind the camera as well, as Kubrick and cinematographer Lucien Ballard lens the film with beautifully uncomplicated setups –the only ostentatious flourishes being a couple of long dolly shots tracking a character as household items flash by in the foreground– and the editing is precise and unsparing.\n\n Watching things inevitably fall apart is nearly as satisfying as watching a good plan coming together, as the pettiest of human malice and the cruelty of random chance threaten the foundations of even the most herculean and stolidly executed efforts. There is an undercurrent of nastiness to the film by the time it ends in an abrupt show of futility as if Kubrick is having a laugh at the expense of the ants under his microscope. Sherry said it best: “It isn’t fair… just a bad joke without a punchline.” \n\n[https://thefilmera.com/2018/07/20/the-killing/](https://thefilmera.com/2018/07/20/the-killing/)",

        "text": "I know a lot has been said about this film, and I am largely in agreement with everyone who has expressed that this is an admirable failure of an adaptation: a restless, messy, wonky and dumbed down echo of a masterpiece. The script is faithful to the novel's narrative structure yet time and again chooses to 'dumb down' a lot of Fitzgerald's imagery to make it more accessible. The anachronistic music is hit and miss, and the VFX are at times garish and distracting. The casting, though, is perfect - at least visually - and the cinematography is gorgeous, with bold colours and visually dense compositions.\n\nSo in static this film works well. Pause it anywhere and it looks like it does its source material full justice. In fact, I half-believe this film may have been more effective being delivered as a Powerpoint presentation rather than motion picture.\n\nIn motion, the film falls apart. This is for various reasons but the one I'd like to discuss is the editing. The film uses continuity editing techniques, but the editing frequently draws attention to itself in ways that I don't think were intended. The editor is utterly restless: average shot length must be very short, and shot reverse shot is used throughout in a similarly frenetic way. The first scene that I felt the editor actually allowed the actors the space to do their job was 1 and a half hours into the film - the Plaza Hotel scene. Before that point, I never felt like the editor trusted the actors to give a performance the audience could focus their attention on.\n\nThe obvious response to what I've just said is to point out that the energy of the editing clearly reflects the breathless hedonism of the Roaring Twenties. Well, yes, in theory that would make sense. And I think it's more successful in the scenes about that hedonism: Myrtle's party, Gatsby's party, etc. But the frenzied editing remains for the places which should be more reflective and (at times) awkward: Tom's dinner party at the start, the lunch with Wolfsheim, the reunion between Gatsby and Daisy. It shouldn't, in my view, be cranked up to 11 the entire time. Everything else is cranked up to 11 - costumes, music, etc. so the editing is the thing that needs to ease up a little to allow these other elements to take full effect.\n\nThe film is a colourful headache to watch, but an excellent screenshot generator as illustration of Fitzgerald's masterpiece. Do you agree?",

Despite a somewhat screwy ending, I thought the movie was really well done.  I appreciate a story that uses a horrifying situation that doesn't revolve around monsters, ghosts or psycho killers.  It's just a simple situation that puts someone in a unimaginable situation. \n\nWhat really got me though was when Jess realizes she's going to have to slice her hand in order to get out of the hand cuffs.  I was prepared for a bloody scene but holy hell I was not expecting to see her peel the flesh back on her hand.  The scene actually made me light headed and I needed to pause the movie for a minute to  compose myself. \n\nNormally I can watch gory movies with no problem.  Movies like Saw, Final Destination or the Friday the 13th series are all a breeze for me because of how over the top the kills are and how frequently the Gore is on display in those movies. \n\nThis movie, however, caught me off guard and I believe its because the gore was earned.  Throughout the film Jess is accompanied by a stray dog who is slowly eating her dead husband.  Aside from seeing the dog chewing on pieces of flesh, most of the dogs actions are done off screen.  The movie gives you a false sense of protection from anything truly horrific and gory.  Then, at about the 90 minute mark, Jess completely mutilates her hand.  The movie takes away the protection of objects obscuring your view and we are forced to watch a truly horrifying act. \n\nBy taking its time and limiting the gore for most of the film, the one truly bloody moment in the movie is made all the more violent and effective.",

Me being a high schooler going into his senior year and having a father made me expect that I would get emotional. And while I felt that they did a good job of the father daughter relationship (I could see much of my father in Nick Offermen) it didn't seem like they developed that aspect enough. I couldn't tell his fault it was the actors or the writers. The daughter (who's name escapes me) did a good job acting but with Offerman I could read his face when he was anything but happy, all his emotions look the same after that. And with the writer it seemed like maybe they tried to do too much giving both our main characters romantic relationships and then trying to tell other narratives at the same time. As while I have these critiques I can't think of a way to fix. So, if you've seen the movie I'd love to know if your felt the same or any other thoughts about the movie. ",

        "text": "Sorry  to Bother You is the debut film of writer/director Boots Riley, a  musician who is a veteran creative having put out hip-hop albums since  the early 90’s. This, I think, largely explains my reaction to the film,  as I appreciate the creativity and “out-there” aspects of the film, but  feel that it lacks any sort of grasp on even the most basic principles   of what makes for a compelling story or characters. For whatever it’s  worth, this has very little to do with the politics of the film, which I  largely agree with. The theme of people of color feeling they have to  adjust themselves to fit into larger white society to the point where  they risk losing their identity is what made me extremely excited for  this film in the first place, and the film’s suggestion that lower-class   workers need to have ownership and control over their workplace or  else  it becomes eerily similar to slavery was unexpected but still  something  I already wholeheartedly agree with it. I love everything  about what the film was trying to go for, from concept to the themes and  issues it tackles, but the execution is so far off base.\n\nThe  most glaring issue to me is the lack of a compelling main character.  The audience is never really given a reason to like him or to really  care when he continues to succeed effortlessly to an unspecified end.  This may largely be due to how fast the film’s plot starts and how  little  foundation it sets up beforehand. The first scene is of Cassius  Green  getting the job of a telemarketer. All we really learn about who  he is  before starting the job is that he needs money and validation,  and he  likes his girlfriend. That’s basically it. And it’s not even  presented in an interesting way. There’s a scene where his landlord  yells at him  for being months behind on rent, which is easily just the  most obvious  ‘I need money’ set-up one could imagine. I could have  forgiven a lazy  set-up like this if the film were simply using it as a  universally  understood cliche opening so it could springboard into the  more  interesting stuff as quickly as possible, but from beginning to  end Sorry to Bother You seems to choose the least interesting ways  possible to progress the actual story. Another egregious example of this  is right  after Cassius learns to use his “white voice” to make sales  over the  phone, a montage starts to show his consistent success at  making sales.  But instead of indulging in what makes the concept of  Sorry to Bother  You interesting and treating the audience to unique  situations the  concept allows for, it instead cues maybe about 90  seconds of Cassius high fiving the manager in the same exact static  shot.\n\nIn fact, the main concept of  Cassius using his white voice is barely in the film at all. There is not  one extended scene where he makes a sales pitch  that has a beginning  and an end. We don’t see any sort of progression or  get to experience  Cassius learning or solving anything. Off the bat, he just IS amazing at  it. We don’t get to see why, we just watch him  become more successful.  This becomes an even larger issue when about 45  minutes into the film  where Cassius has completed his extremely shallow  goal and isn’t  presented with any real obstacle or goal for quite some time. He is no  longer poor and still has his girlfriend. What about Cassius is supposed  to interest me here? Yes, eventually the film gets moving again when he  finds out the company he works for is more sinister  than he thought  initially, but there is a large chunk of the film where  it screeches to  a halt because the main character is completely satisfied and isn’t  driving the film whatsoever. In general, this film’s  story has a huge  issue with events happening one after another without  any clear cause  and effect.\n\nOn top of all of this is a  ton of  smaller issues. The humor rarely lands and is usually based on   characters simply saying outrageous or “random” things instead of   anything related to character or satire. There is one horrendous use of   the awful trope of cellphone footage perfectly capturing something that   could expose the antagonists that I audibly protested. The side plot,   which awkwardly ends up becoming the main plot, is about Cassius’s   coworkers and friends unionizing against the telemarketing company also   has an issue of poorly showing the audience its progression, which  leads  to the climax of the film conveniently working out only because  it  seemingly has to. The lead protestor is creepy and weird but is  never called out on it, Cassius’s girlfriend is extremely preachy and  tied to a  revolutionary faction for pretty much no reason. Absolutely  nothing  about the cinematography is interesting. The ‘satire’ of the  state of  media being a television show called “I Got the Shit Kicked  Out of Me”  is not only extremely shallow and not really explored, but  it’s not even  all that time with the peak of pain-porn television being  back in the  early 2000s with Jack-Ass and America’s Funniest Home  Videos.\n\nAll this being said, I do see  potential in Boots Riley as a director. Maybe  the glowing reviews of  his debut will make him think he’s got this  screenwriting thing down,  but I think if he put his next screenplay  through a more rigorous  rewriting process he could make a great film with a more refined story.  Sorry to Bother You has a very bold creative  voice and is filled to  brim with interesting ideas. It always kept me guessing and I admire it  for being truly original. However, the film  lacks an interesting  structure or character to hang all of these ideas  on, and aside from  some quirky moments doesn’t fully explore any one of these interesting  ideas. The concepts and ideas deserved a much better script.\n\n3/10\n\n[https://letterboxd.com/austinferreira/film/sorry-to-bother-you/](https://letterboxd.com/austinferreira/film/sorry-to-bother-you/)",

        "text": " My first post in TrueFilm was about my favorite movie: Kokuhaku (or Confessions) from 2010. In that post I talked about some of the reasons I find this movie so amazing and consider it my favorite ever. I talked just a little bit about topics like soundtrack, plot, character wor, acting, etc. But I rewatched the movie a couple of times since then and realized I should talk about an aspect  that I really think makes me like the film so much: its aesthetics.\n\n Not only its cinematography, but also locations, colors and much more; I find it so beautiful that I had to try to figure out why, and maybe I got the answer. \n\n To those who watched the film, you must confirm that most of its photography fluctuate through the cold colors spectre. Grey, blue, black and even some tones of white are used and it is something I personally love since it is my favorite spectre of colors.\n\n Not only that but the locations and even the \"wheaters\" appeal to my personal taste. I don't know if it is because I grew up in an overly sunny town, but I really loved rainy or cloudy days (maybe because they do not happen often here) so to see this type of scenario so beautifully represented on the screen made me love it on a personal level. Not only that, but it all also serves a pourpose to the story.\n\n Since the movie's plot is related to bitter feelings (revenge,loss,loneliness,pain...) all these aesthetic artifacts are there for storytelling pourpose as well. Without the overly bright colors or light, the depressing and nihilistic atmosphere that the movie's story pourposes gets much more real. The colors, the clouds, the rain, the lonely walk to the bridge meeting in the middle of the night only with the street posts' lights...none of that is for free or meaningless. I guess it is because of the unnintentional strong appeal these visuals have on my personal self and the amazing storytelling reasons behind them that I love this movie's aesthetics so much.",

        "text": "I watched Ingmar Bergman's \"Winter Light\" recently, and really loved it. I won't claim to have understood it, but to me, it was just a really bleak, raw, and painfully human film about people being let down by god, and in turn, letting down those around them. It felt like a very lonely film, with beautiful visuals that made me think of old oil paintings and Ansel Adams photographs. So anyway, cutting to the chase, I was trying to read some commentary on it today since I kinda assume that I miss a lot in films, and I found this weird article that calls \"Winter Light\" one of \"cinema's greatest comedies.\" I honestly thought he must've been talking about another movie, until I kept reading and saw him reference specific scenes, like Marta's incredibly raw and sad letter and Ericsson's cruel and apathetic rejection of her, as comic and hilarious.\n\nHere is the review:\n\n[https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/winter-light](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/winter-light)\n\nWhat do you guys think? I'm open to the fact that I might've misread the tone of the film, but it just seems so unlikely. I watched the Seventh Seal, and that one had definite funny moments in it, despite also being somewhat serious in its discussion of meaning and the human experience. This one just really seemed to be dark and sad and a little grim. It had a few moments that were funny, like the organist packing up his sheets and checking his watch because he's anxious to leave, but that seemed less a joke, and more just the qualities of a character that's presented as being down to earth and unconcerned with the lofty obsessions of the people around him.

        "text": "There’s no catharsis in shouting at an old person who’s dying. This seems to be the prevailing sentiment of “The Meyerowitz Stories: New and Selected.” A 2017 sleeper hit that flew directly under my radar - despite being objectively more emotionally affecting than best picture nominee Lady Bird, and Best Picture winner The Shape of Water - combined! \n\n\n---------\n\n\nAdum Sandler. Adum Sandler. Sandler. Sandler. SANDLER. Adam Sanler is officially serious, guys! He’s the best actor of our generation! I only watched this movie because it had 90 rotten tomatoes and so I could say Adam Sandler is great in this indie movie I watched. BUT to be honest, Adam Suddzler only makes poop and genitalia jokes for 12 year olds - on an unrelated note, has anyone seen the new Deadpool movie? What an underrated gem! My favorite part was when he said penis and there were boobs in it. /s\n\n.\n\n\nAnywho, Adam Sandler has crafted a deeply personal and moving performance. While surprising, it’s nothing out of this world. He’s an actor. This is what they do. Sandler’s chemistry with his daughter is particularly heartwarming, especially at the piano. It’s a relationship that relies on Hemingway's iceberg theory - only tell the audience a tenth, and let their mind create the rest. It leads to an intensely personal relationship that nearly every audience member can identify with. Sandler’s performances, as well as much of the film, relies on glossy naturalism - reality feels just the way you would want reality to feel. \n\n.\n\n\n\nThe subject matter is personal yet ideal, the performances are poignant yet imperfect, and the Super 16 camera work has an aftertaste of nostalgia. It’s a performance that relies on duality - feverishly expressive while intimately repressed, passionate yet lost, collapsing in on itself in desperation while driving toward the only person he loves. This duality is what makes acting. It’s not what makes good acting - it’s what makes acting. Whether it be contrasting opinions of a character, an emotional growth, a dilemma, or the central juxtaposition of actor and character. There’s a central decision to be made: how much of yourself do you let into the character? Some people on the internet may lead you to believe the correct answer is zero, that you should create this brand new person from the ground up and inhabit a body you’ve never been in. But often times that approach will lead to stale, sterile, and sedentary performances. There will be no humanity. You must bring yourself into your character. \n\n\n.\n\n\n\nWrite what you know gets preached a lot, but it is often misinterpreted - what it should say is this Raymond Carver quote: “Write what you know, and what do you know better than your own secrets?” Bring your deepest darkest desires to your role. Sympathize, empathize, and rationalize your character, because you are the last person who should judge your character. \n\n.\n\n\nIn the spring I had the opportunity to play a troubling character in Branden Jacobs-Jenkins’ play “Appropriate.” A character who is no doubt harboring a lot of racist underpinnings from his mother - a character who says many disgusting things and who will no doubt turn out to be just like his mother - a racist. But one thing my director kept hammering home is that I cannot judge this character. I cannot look at the audience with a wink wink nudge nudge while saying “This character is a racist!” You need to advocate for your character absolutely. A neat writing exercise I’ve found is to make your character make the case for why they should get into heaven. While I’m not a religious person, making your character look at themselves in the mirror and lay out everything that makes them redeemable is infinitely valuable. That’s what makes a performance legitimate. If you can look your character in the eyes and say “You deserve it.” Once you can see yourself in that character, you’ve done your job. \n\n\n.\n\n\nSandler, Hoffman, and Stiller have all created intensely personal performances, showcasing a yearning to be accepted and loved and how even the one person perceived to be most loved still wants something more - but one thing keeps them from transcending themselves: name recognition. I simply cannot ignore the fact that I’m seeing highly paid actors interacting on screen. But that brings up the question: Does that matter if the performance is emotionally affecting. \n\n\n---------\n\n\n\nThe Meyerowitz Stories was shot on Super 16mm film. So what is super 16mm film, and what makes it better than regular 16mm? Originally, all 16mm film stock had perforations on both sides of the film. In 1970, the realization that many 16mm camera only used one or sometimes never took advantage of both perforations led to the birth of the Super 16mm format. By widening the opening in the film gate to include the area of the negative that contained the unnecessary perfs and using single perf 16mm film stock, a larger image area was obtained on the same size 16mm film stock. Same cost for film, higher image quality! So why use the Super? Well regular 16mm has an aspect ratio of 4:3, - or 1.33:1 - so when blowing up to 35 for a theatrical release - and the 1.85:1 aspect ratio - , the 16mm had to be severely cropped, while super 16 has an aspect ratio of 1.66:1, which is much closer to the 1.78 of modern televisions and monitors as well as the 1.85:1 this film was projected at. \n\n.\n\n\nAnd boy oh boy is it a juicy projection. From the first frames of celluloid, the analogue is on full display. From the color temperature, the film grain, the subtle shake of the frame, the color gammate, and the beautiful impurities built into the very foundation, all collide to make one of the most surprisingly visually emotive films of the year. Films like Blade Runner, Dunkirk, and the Shape of Water all come at you and yell, “I’M CINEMATOGRAPHY! LOVE ME!” But films like The Florida Project, Call me by Your Name, and The Meyerowitz Stories all wrap the viewer in a nostalgic analogue blanket of celluloid, cooing them to an emotional slumber. While the super 16 looks marvelous in this film, the question remains: why film? For this piece, I would say that the central theme of family is communicated through not only the screenplay, but also the cinematography. The nostalgic memories and warm blanket color temperature strike a long forgotten yet unmistakably contemporary cinematic coard. \n\n\n.\n\n\nThe editing was also on a meaningful fleek, at first jarringly transitioning between scenes mid sentence, then later morphing into calm fade to blacks. This serious sense of momentum early in the film keeps the audience interested during what could potentially turn out to be a repetitive and boring first act. The camera isn’t there to give way to serious performances and a serious script with serious themes, the cinematography comments and contributes to the narrative - forging away, mining at emotions screenplays and performances could never touch. The grain grounds the story in reality while the warm analogue blanket transports the viewer into a fantasy. \n\n-------------------\n\n\nNoah Baumbach. \n\n.\n\n\nI didn’t like Frances Ha. I felt like it was Lena Dunham doing a Woody Allen film, but not as good as either of them. I can absolutely see how others could have connected with Frances, but I did not. When I started The Meyerowitz Stories, I didn’t know that Baumbach was behind it, and about half way through I found out via IMDB. I was nervous it would derrail my viewing and color my opinion and analysis of it - I was worried I would view it as Frances Ha 2.0. Luckily, The Meyerowitz Stories is far and away more poignant, pointed, and effective than Frances Ha. Where Frances Ha was grounded in concept and impractical in dialogue, Meyerowitz is realistic in the strangest way, with Terrabatino esque dialogue minus the postmodern punch. It’s dialogue that is implicit and suggestive - see the first scene when Sandler is discussing parking with his daughter. There’s layers of subtext here that flies by so fast and loose it’s tough to catch! When Frances Ha’s screenplay was meandering and lost, Meyerowitz has immediate tension. \n\n\n.\n\n\nI don’t know what it is, but even the simple inclusion of the expository title card sets the audience in motion. Maybe it’s the Fincher esque, “There’s never too much exposition” way of storytelling, but by god does it work! The audience leans forward and wonders where things will go from here. That’s when the fast, naturalistic dialogue kicks in and before you know it, BAM, the audience is hooked. \n\n\n.\n\n\nWhen screenwriting advice says that your screenplay needs a hook, they might not be talking about some hokey twist in the first act, they’re talking about audience engagement in any way possible. Here, it’s that title card and the dialogue - right off the bat there’s a goal, there’s immediacy, and there’s character. While Frances Ha had characters who knew the exact right way to phrase a thought, how precisely to respond, and the next four lines, Meyerowitz has characters that are anything but. This lack of understanding is used to almost a humorous degree in some scenes - people are never on the same page. \n\n\n.\n\n\nIn Lessons from the Screenplay’s video on The Social Network, he discussed Aaron Sorkin’s strategy for dialogue - that characters should never be on the same page. And while it may be the most r/movies thing ever to discuss Fincher, Sorkin, and Lessons from the Screenplay in the same essay, there’s merit! The fast flying, misunderstood, and self absorbed dialogue I had first mistaken as Terrabatino esque turns out to be Sorkin turned up to eleven! \n\n.\n\n\nBaumbach’s use of repetition is key in distinguishing this film from Frances Ha. In the latter, the series of events (as well as dialogue) seems strictly linear. I say this, you respond perfectly, then I also muse on being a millennial, while here the dialogue and structure as a whole loops back in on itself multiple times over. It’s pointed and direct yet layered and circular - keeping the audience invested, and on their toes. \n\n.\n\n\nWhile we’re on the topic of structure, I was initially confused about the title, specifically the inclusion of “New and Selected.” Sure it was quirky and searchable, but there’s gotta be something more. Well, it turns out that it refers to a specific experiment Baumbach made during the writing of this film, “I thought of it like a collection of stories that an author had published separately.” It’s a structure I’ve found myself more and more attracted to recently, this nonlinear fragmented collection of short stories that outlines a grander narrative. It’s a structure that’s unconventional yet endearing and approachable. Like I mentioned earlier, I was recently cast in a production of the play “Appropriate,” which centers around a family being forced to be in the same room for once in a long time. This is what a great script should do: force people to collide. Which is exactly what this film does, it forces a family to come together and ultimately collide with each other in an utterly relatable way. \n\n\n-----------\n\n\n\n\nFamily sucks. Family’s work. Family is tough. There's a weight to our loved ones that’s obtuse and obstinate - a love that that doesn’t burn or flicker so much as it lingers. That weight is often what makes holidays, festivals, social gatherings, and even a simple conversation so derisive. This film projects that inalienable weight onto the silver screen, pulls focus onto moments of being rather than lines of dialogue, and exposes people just trying to reason with the past their given. \n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/sQYore1sLdg\n\nhttps://napkinsunite.weebly.com\n",

The film takes place in a baroque hotel during a high society event. The guests are all socialites and take part in games of cards, shooting as sport and small plays. In the midst of all these bourgeoise activities a mysterious man approaches a woman – whose husband is busy winning at a card game each time – and he tells her how both of them had met a year before. The woman of course has no recollection of this. The man proceeds to tell his story multiple times, each time with some sort of variation that completely changes the event dramatically, and by the end one can never be sure of what actually happened.\n\nhttps://breakingthefourthwallsite.wordpress.com/2018/07/19/last-year-at-marienbad-the-epitome-of-modernist-cinema/",

        "text": "Pretentious is a word that often gets thrown around when it comes to more 'high concept' films that delve into the more experimental side of filmmaking. Although I try to avoid using it as much as possible, even if there are films that feel so full of themselves 'pretentious' seems to be the best way to describe it (looking at you \"Only God Forgives\").  Some of my favorite directors have made films that venture into the 'pretentious' sphere of criticism, such as David Lynch's 3 HOUR LONG \"Inland Empire\". However, I try to believe that maybe the movie just wasn't for me at that point in time. That is what I think happened with Jean-Luc Godard's 1967 film, \"Weekend\".\n\nLet me first say that, I really enjoyed (maybe admired is a better word) Weekend. Knowing the context behind this film is almost crucial to understanding what Godard is going for. At this point in Godard's career, he has already established himself as one of the leading voices in one of filmmaking's most important movements, the French New Wave. The 15th film he's directed, this is also the last semi-linear film he would make for an entire decade. As typical for Godard, he went into production with no script and wrote Weekend in the editing room. Fed up with society, this is Godard's epic satire calling for revolution and claiming famously during the credits, \"the end of cinema\" itself.\n\nI guess you could describe the plot of Weekend as, \"A surreal tale of a married couple going on a road trip to visit the wife's parents with the intention of killing them for the inheritance.\" (IMDb), but it's not really about that. Sure that might be the catalyst for Godard's true story of the collapse of society into hippie, cannibal guerrilla revolutionaries living in the woods, but the narrative takes a backseat to the overall message the movie delivers and exploration of filmmaking itself.\n\nSome of the scenes here aren't quite necessary for the narrative, but rather Godard simply going, \"let's do it because we can\". One scene includes two philosopher philosophizing about a pebble, but an insert card that says \"Lewis Carroll Style\" (Author of Alice in Wonderland and the Jabberwocky) changes the shot into an old black and white shot of a pebble in the style of 1800s photography. Why? Because they could and it was different. Much of the comedy here is absurdist and personally pretty hilarious, especially the comically long (and now famous) high scene that is one very long lateral tracking shot of the protagonist traveling down the highway through a immense traffic jam. \n\nThere might not be a single sympathetic character in the entirety of \"Weekend\" and that might be the point. Our two protagonists go from rich, selfish, arrogant assholes who run people off the road and care more about material goods more than human life (Corrine cries about her expensive bag after getting into a major car crash causing the other driver to die) to idealistic, cannibal revolutionaries living in the woods (or one of them at least as Corrine eats her husband in the final shot of the film). Much of the finer points of what Godard was going for seemed to be lost on me here though. Specifically a long, 360 shot of a pianist and the audience rotating around twice as the musician  explains his beliefs on music, claiming how all is inspired by Mozart without living up to his genius (even going as far to say that classical is 'music you listen to' while bands such as the Rolling Stones and the Beatles are 'music you don't listen to'). Or a scene where two men share their overly long speeches about oppression and violent revolution while eating sandwiches while the protagonists listen in complete boredom. Are the speeches supposed to be excessive and taken as a joke, or does Godard want us to take these seriously?\n\nMuch else of the subtlety felt lost on me as well such as many of the insert cards throughout the movie that display themes the following scene explores and at times what seems to be nonsense as well as the passage of time. Perhaps it's due to some of the subtitles not showing what they said, or maybe there's French wordplay I can't pick up on? Is it because I'm not well versed enough in my French New Wave cinema? (This is the third Godard film I've seen as well as Breathless and My Life to Live, both of which I very much enjoyed). Did some of the messages brush past me due to the fact that I'm looking back on this contemporary 1967 film in 2018? \n\nThis is definitely a film I will be returning to at some point. The technical aspects of this film are just too fun to watch, even if I don't seem to get all of the underlying meanings behind the imagery. 9/10 ",

I don't know if this has been discussed before, but from my superficial investigation I'm going to assume it hasn't.\n\nYou all probably know how jump cuts are so pervasive in YouTube. Not that I'm complaining though: I like them and think they're a very efficient way to condense videos and the process of video-making, as well as reducing the possible boredom arising from \"hums\" and useless seconds.\n\nAfter seeing a video on YouTube some time ago precisely about this topic, I wondered: can the widely used jump cuts in YouTube be traced back to the use of this type of editing in Breathless?",
