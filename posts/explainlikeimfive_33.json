My issue is that charges don't just flow through a wire in one direction. They have a net drift velocity, but most of their motion is sporadic. Wouldn't this varying direction cause a bunch of sporadic magnetic fields since the motion in the random directions is way faster than the drift velocity?",

Presumably, if there's a set length they need to be in jail (as indicated by \"send her to jail for 1 year\"), then they've already gone through sentencing. At which point, I didn't think you could just walk up to jail and say \"here's 10 grand, let my mom out\" right? Like, you can't just buy yourself out of jail (I guess if you have $50M you can do a lot, but it's not supposed to be that way, right?)",
