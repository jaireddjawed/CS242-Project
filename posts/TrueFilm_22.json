There was Tony from Every Frame A Painting who really seemed to know what he was talking about with his essays, but ever since he killed the project, it has all been just mediocre stuff building upon more mediocre stuff day by day imo (apart from some other channels like Lessons From The Screenplay &amp; Nerdwriter1 who still make good content).\nWhat do you think is the reason for this? What was Tony doing right that these new essayists are not? What do you think is missing from most film analysis videos essays today and how can they be fixed?",

        "text": "SPOLIERS\n\nThis isn't easy to say because Sergio Leone movies have so many great characters (Eastwood's The Man with No Name, Tuco, Noodles, Colonel Mortimer) but Henry Fonda as Frank gives such a spellbinding performance and truly creates an amazing character. First of all the obvious part which is the shocking casting decision to have Henry Fonda, the quintessential \"nice guy\" actor play one of the most evil, cold and sociopathic villains in movie history. Because of this plus the cinematography and music, Frank's intro scene (in which he orders the massacre of a family and shoots a 6 year old kid in the face) is mindblowing.\n\nBeyond that, it is rare that the villain is the most developed character in a movie but that is the case in OUATIW. One of the main themes of the movie is the end of the nostalgic era of the gunslinger and the rise of big business, corruption and \"money as power\" in the west. The characters are pretty clearly divided into two worlds. Harmonica and Cheyenne belong to the old world while Jill and Morton are part of the new world.\n\nFrank, however is caught between these two forces. He wants more than anything to rise above his past and succeed as a businessman in the new world but as we come to realize he just doesn't belong in this era and is truly a gunslinger like the others. In fact, this is hinted at in the beginning of the film as he can't resist murdering the McBain family after he is instructed by Morton just to scare them. A real business man understands that murder is \"not to his advantage\". However, as the movie continues, it seems like Frank learns this lesson: he keeps Harmonica alive and allows Jill to hand over the land during an auction rather than killing her as well. But in the end, after Harmonica has destroyed his chances of obtaining the land he just can't let it go and move on to something else like a business man would. He acknowledges that he is \"just a man\" and makes his only noble decision of the movie when he agrees to face Harmonica in a duel. Despite all of the evil things he has done (including the reason Harmonica is after him) he gained some respect as he shows a degree of honor in the ways of the old west. Sergio Leone and Henry Fonda provide this character with a really sinister presence but also add fascinating complexity.",

        "text": "I. AN INTRODUCTION\n\n\nThe film is refreshing in its depiction of zombies, at a time when the genre not only felt tired, but unlikely to be reanimated at all. They’re fast, they pile over each other in the cramped space and the film’s set-pieces, when the train does on occasion stop, are breathtakingly inventive and truly scary.\n\nThe real genius of Train To Busan, however, is in its setting. The train provides a joint space for a socially diverse group from South Korean society, placing them on generally equal footing but via the separate carriages, a handy mechanism to - by chance, and sometimes intentionally - prevent mobility. In the context of a zombie apocalypse, to quote Brad Pitt from World War Z, “movement is life.”\n\nSocial hierarchy in South Korea is particularly complex and ruthless. Conformity and social expectations, place of birth, job, place of residence, accent, and clothing all factor into the endless judgement of status in the country, which rises from a complex web of history and development that has culminated in an autocratic, work-driven society that pays the majority of its workforce (with large numbers of ‘migrant labourers’ that are distinguished from ‘expats’ in another example of hierarchy) a severely low wage. In such a consumerist society, social mobility becomes a primary motivation, and in South Korea, according to Seoul based economics professor Ju Biung-ghi, the best way to get rich currently is to be born that way. “Inequality of opportunity will make it increasingly difficult for poor children to move up, which is expected to lead to more conflict between different social classes.\" The country has industrialised so quickly precisely because there is little chance of social mobility. Much like the separate carriages in the train, when someone shuts the door in your face there’s little chance of becoming anything other than one more drone in the horde of ignored working class people behind you.\n\nThis is at the heart of Train To Busan. Sure, it’s primary conflict (on a wider scale) is between human and zombie, but presented with nothing else it is an over-worn, boring concept. The conflict between characters is where the true drama lies, and where we can find damning statements about South Korea as it is now. To go into each interpersonal conflict would be dry and serve little purpose other than nailing excessively into a coffin that doesn’t need it, so I will look at a few key instances from the film to illustrate.\n\nI. CORPORATE GREED AND POWER DYNAMICS\nYon-suk from Train To Busan. A representation of corporate greed\nYon-suk is perhaps the most obvious example, so we’ll begin there. Yon-suk represents the most odiously cruel aspects of the work-focused culture in South Korea. He is a man obsessed with saving himself, and despite the horrific situation never shies away from judging his fellow passengers based on their social status. He predictably acts in a selfish manner, causing the death of several people by sacrificing the wellbeing of those he deems ‘less’ than himself. In most films, we would perhaps see that Yon-suk represents corporate greed, and a selfishness that will be his downfall as we learn the lesson that looking after our fellow man is what is most important. Indeed, that lesson exists here too, alongside another, more sinister one. For it is in the reactions of the people around him that Yon-suk draws the bulk of his power.\n\nWhen some survivors attempt to reach the carriage that Yon-suk and some crew members are taking refuge in, he forbids it, stating that they could be infected and that it’s too dangerous. Important to note here is that he does not actually act himself, but rather commands the crew of the train to act for him. This parallels a growing problem in South Korea where the media kowtows to government demands, and corporations hold the true power. The quick adoption of capitalism in the country’s post-fascist era has placed value and trust in corporations and business over all else, where they must be respected and seen to be infallible. In 2014 when a ferry overturned and killed 300 people, the media (following the government’s wishes) initially stated that everyone survived. It was only later after an investigation that the truth was found out: that the captain and crew had abandoned ship on lifeboats without passengers, and that the owners had overloaded the ferry to save costs. It was seen as a national tragedy.\n\nWhen Yon-suk directs the train crew to lock the doors, he places his own value above all others, while the crew’s willingness to bend to his demands (as they do several times in the film) represents that complex, immoral connection government, media, and business have in South Korean society, one in which social status dictates the deference that must be shown towards those who ‘deserve’ it.\n​\nII. COMPLICIT GUILT AND CULPABILITY\nSeek-Woo covered in blood in Train to Busan. A more subtle representation of corporate greed, and complicit guilt\nSu-an’s father, Seok-woo, represents this too, in a different light. His character arc allows him to come to an understanding of himself, and his wrongdoings. He eventually realises that his daughter is the most important part of his life, after early-on in the film informing her to ‘only look after yourself’ in a statement that seemed ominously detached from her. He is not innocent, however. It is heavily implied in the film that he is indirectly responsible for the continued outbreak, through his greed when he is selling shares at the company that just had a chemical leak. Realising this, he breaks down and attempts to wash the blood off his hands that has come from zombies, who have become a manifestation of guilt and revenge for the deaths he is responsible for.\n\nLike Yon-suk it is his corporate greed and desire to conform to rigid social expectations that causes his downfall, hurts others and places his daughter at risk. His is more of a complicit moral failing, than the direct evil actions of Yon-suk but these both stem from the same branch of society and director Yeon Sang-ho achieves an incredible feat of careful character development to differentiate between the two. They are objectively very different, we can see that Seok-woo is a decent person, but that is not enough to absolve one from the guilt and responsibility of being complicit in behaviour that ignores all social responsibility to your fellow human. The distinction is an important one, on a narrative level and morally speaking.\n\nIII. THE WORKING CLASS AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY\nSeeing-kyeong and Sang-hwa, a working class pregnant couple in train To Busan, representing working class values and social responsibility\nWhile greed and disregard for others are prevalent in Train To Busan, the film is also full of people who understand their social responsibility and work to help others. The pregnant couple stand as moral compasses in the film, representing the height of guidance for Su-an, who witnesses developments with watchful eyes. The couple - Sang-hwa and Seong-kyeong- are tough and working class, who understand the dynamics at work and have an empathy for those around them that need it. Sang-hwa gives his life for the good of the group, and acts like this are consistently rewarded in the film with positive results. For Su-an, they initially act as surrogates until Seok-woo steps up to the plate. Seong-kyeong prevails in the end, a narrative reward for the selfless actions of her partner. The film supports their view of the world, and gives them a strong voice as they stand in direct opposition to impersonal, socially irresponsible greed.\n\n​Their actions throughout the film, as well as saving themselves, are also generally for the greater good of the group as a whole. Yeon Sang-ho places them in situations where their actions naturally benefit more people than themselves, and their ferocity (especially Sang-hwa) is presented as courageous and is wonderful to watch.\n\nIV. RAPID INDUSTRIALISATION AND THE ELDERLY\nThe elderly sisters in train To Busan. They represent the elderly, often alone and poor who have few companions\nLinked, though not explicitly, to this consumer culture is the treatment of the elderly sisters. They are often left to their own devices, never much of a concern to anyone as they also struggle to survive. Their dependency on each other, and their companionship is an endearing part of the film until the death of one of them. The surviving sister commits suicide, surrendering herself to the horde behind them.\n\nIt is at this point we realise they are companions because they have no one else. South Korea is on track to have the highest life expectancy in the world by 2030, with women expected to live, on average, to 90 years old. Their elderly workforce now exceeds their younger one, but contrary to all of this, almost half of all pensioners in South Korea live in poverty. 25% live alone. In 10 years the suicide rate amongst retirees has doubled. All of this according to surveys by the OECD. The rapid industrialisation of South Korea has exploded their population, in part because life expectancy has increased so dramatically and with such speed, but they have neither the infrastructure, nor the job availability to allow the elderly to live out-with poverty. \n\nThis problem has not gone unnoticed (especially in Train To Busan) however it has been pushed to the margins in South Korean society, which has become more and more polarised over time. Traditionally, observing Confucian ethics would suggest that the younger generations look after their elders as Japan currently does, but the changes in South Korea have happened so quickly that this is not the case, and the welfare state is simply unable to cope as it was formed at a time when these ethics were more prominent; the need for welfare was seen as low on the list of priorities. Part of this is because of the economic polarisation that has occurred, embodied by the working class Sang-hwa and Seong-kyeong and the rich Yon-suk.\n\nContrasted to the concern placed on the well-being of the young Su-an, and the tragedy of the deaths of the young baseball team members, the deaths of the sisters, while sad, are understood in the film as simply something that happened. It made sense for the elderly woman to follow her sister, since she was now alone and Yeon Sang-ho paints a sombre portrait of a society (represented by those in the carriage) that would rather this happened to the elderly ladies than having to focus on helping them. Key to the film’s masterful quality of it’s social commentary, Yeon does not pass judgement here, presenting us with myriad reasons that South Korean society does this.\n\nThis was just an extract from an article I wrote if you want to take a look.

Few directors work so elegantly with layers of fiction and \"reality\", but it's too easy to say that he simply blurries the lines like ordinary \"mindfuck\" movies do. Perfect Blue and Paprika are his most famous ones, but IMHO Millenium Actress is his best. It has the emotional power of Tokyo Godfathers (another great ones, but he only made great movies anyway) and the complexity of Paprika. Either way, I wrote an essay trying to analyze this great movie, in regard to the act of narration in the autobiography. When we talk about our own lives, we 'fictionalize' them and treat them like a complete and meaningful entity, becoming the protagonists of our own stories. At the same time, it is through the act of narration that we are able to 'free up' parts of our lives that have rigidified and reappropriate aspects that we've considered dead. That's the dynamic that I've observed in the film; I'd be happy to hear any feedback (but please read it through before).

        "text": "I just finished The Fly ('86) and wanted to do a little comparison and verdict. Spoilers are probably inbound.\n\nTo  start off, I want to say that both films were good, and I appreciated  that the remake attempted to make a new story and forge its own path a  little. I'm not keen on the idea of shot for shot remakes.\n\nThe  films were essentially different genres: the original being a suspense  thriller/horror and the remake being a romance and body horror.\n\nThe  original was structured non-chronologically, and was structured better  overall. The idea of showing the \"murder\" first and what lead up to it  after was a good way to hook in the audience for the murder mystery. The  end felt surreal confirming the wild story told by the murder suspect,  the wife. The remake was told chronologically and was more about  developing the romance (I'll get into this later) and seeing the  relationship getting strained due to miscommunication and the accident  with the fly. The original has the edge in structure, feeling more  deliberate and meaningful, while the remake is very meandering; part of  this is the editing.\n\nThe original is  edited like many of the great old movies were: every scene having a  purpose. Everything was tight and moved along nicely. The remake  could've been a little more refined. Things like the gymnastics and the  arm wrestling went on a little too long, while the romance and  interaction before the accident could've used more time.\n\nAs  far as pacing, the original is far better in this regard. It was never  too slow or too fast. The remake was all over the place, though. I was  shocked how early Brundle went into the teleporter because I knew that  the rest of the movie was about Veronica seeing Brundle, whom she loved,  deteriorate. Like I mentioned earlier, the romance needed more time to  develop. A few sex scenes happened, and now Brundle and Veronica were  supposed to be in love. Maybe, but the fact that Veronica just got out  of a relationship with her boss (he still had her apartment key) really  strains believability.\n\nEffects-wise, I  won't compare them directly because the technology had advanced a lot in  30 years. The original wasn't impressive, even for the 50s. Boris  Karloff and Lon Chaney, Sr. and Jr. had better effects decades earlier.  The effects weren't *bad*, just a little  unimpressive. The actor, Al Hedison, admittedly elevated them with his  performance (looked like there were two minds battling in one body), and  the script used them intelligently (hiding the head and arm to invoke  curiosity). The remake had great effects. The progression and leprosy of  them were very cool. But, as with many 80s movies, it sometimes went  over the top and focused more on gross-out rather than moving the story  forward (melting Stathis's leg).\n\nActing-wise,  they are both good. The original has the legend, Vincent Price, and  everyone else was good, Al Hedison, Patricia Owens. It's been a while,  but I remember that I quite liked Hedison as The Fly because he really  showed the fly vs. the man and was sympathetic. The remake had Goldblum  in an intense nerdy performance that was fascinating to watch even  before the makeup. I think Hedison and Owens had a better chemistry than  Goldblum and Davis.\n\nCinematography-wise,  I can't weigh in on either side. Both were effective. Who can forget  the Phantom of the Opera moment and then the Fly-eye view of the wife in  the original, and what about the wall-crawling in the remake?\n\nThe  original has the better characters. They were, as far as I remember,  all somewhat well-developed and consistent with themselves. In the  remake, there were much less main characters, only 3. Brundle was good,  though he was a little shredded for a nerd. Veronica wasn't very  realistic. She decides to go into a stranger's home, and then she falls  in love with that guy after a few nights together. I can excuse Brundle  falling for Veronica in a short time because he's supposed to be a  reclusive nerd (though a handsome and shredded one), but Veronica is  harder to believe, especially since she just got out of a relationship.  Stathis wasn't consistent. He goes from sleazy creep to sensitive  protector for no reason at all. He's just there to indirectly make  Brundle jealous early on and then bring a shotgun in the end of the  movie, and his inconsitency reflects that. Nothing else he does with  Veronica has a purpose, despite taking up a decent chunk of time.\n\nThe  original had the better ending, no question. I mentioned earlier that  it was surreal to see the wife's story confirmed, and it was very  memorable to see a fly turned more into a man after seeing the man turn  into a fly. The remake's ending was effective and an ode to classic  monster movies.\n\nMy vote goes to the  original. The original was more deliberate and punchy. I don't get why  people call it schlocky; even though the effects are dated, it gets very  tense, and death is not treated lightly. The remake was also good, but  it suffered from being more style than substance. It needed a better  foundation, but it was decided to spend more time showing the decay of  the relationship rather than the actual relationship.\n\nEdit: Same post in different sub [https://www.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/98rj4w/the\\_fly\\_1958\\_vs\\_the\\_fly\\_1986/](https://www.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/98rj4w/the_fly_1958_vs_the_fly_1986/)",

        "author": "PM_ME_GIFTCARDS_PLS",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/98ukng/threads_1984/",
        "text": "I know this is something of an unconventional choice for this subreddit, but I really truly find that *Threads* is an amazing movie, has impacted me deeply, and is easily overlooked due to its nature.\n\nReleased by the BBC in 1984, *Threads* primarily follows the two families of a young, unmarried couple, who have decided to get married after learning of the girlfriend's pregnancy. The first act of the movie follows these families through this ordeal, while bits and pieces of news reports, vaguely describing an escalating conflict in the middle east, are shown to us (more on this later on), but are largely unknowingly ignored by the two families due to their preoccupation with the situation at hand. Eventually, a nuclear attack devastates their city of Sheffield (and presumably much or all of the rest of the world), and follows members of these families through the cold, devastating reality of the consequences of nuclear holocaust. The movie begins by demonstrating the everyday life of these two families while communicating to us \"how\" an international conflict escalates to the point of international nuclear warfare, what happens when the bombs fall, and what life is like decades after the attacks.\n\n\nThe movie employs a sort an omnipresent outside-observer documentary style to explain exactly what is happening (i.e. measures being taken by government ahead of the attacks, which diseases begin to see outbreaks at certain points after nuclear attack, the effects of radiation poisoning, etc.). This information is communicated either through a narrator's voice, or, more prominently so, through a black screen upon which text quickly scrawls, accompanied by a retro \"typing/printing\" noise. That which is described by these screens is usually thereafter demonstrated through the continuous narrative of the characters of the story.\n\nI think that this documentary-like method of communicating information is very interesting. It informs us of what is happening, and makes the movie feel both like a fact-based account of what is happening (if one were exclusively to read these information screens), as well as a first-hand account of what it would be like to actually live through this type of conflict from a mundane everyday standpoint. This dual narrative also adds to the certain eerie vibe of the movie, as it feels like a nature documentary emotionlessly and disinvolvededly observing humanity in the dying moments of its self-inflicted death.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the way in which we become informed of the escalating conflict in the middle east is through bits and snippets of various news media. For example, we are shown headlines on newspapers as a daughter in one of the families works her after-school job. We hear radio news reports while one of the main characters feeds his pet birds. We see a news report on TV while the family sits at the table discussing the logistics of the impending marriage. Through these avenues, we are told a story of countries all around the world becoming entangled in a conflict mainly between two world superpowers (United States and Russia). \n\nI think that it's a very powerful and interesting method of storytelling, as it allows us to fill in the blanks, and provides a general context for the arisal of such a situation. It feels very much like the actual day-to-day reality of hearing things on the news, while showing how easily we can ignore the news we hear because \"it doesn't affect us\" and \"there's nothing we can do about this\". \n\nAt times, the narrative of the movie can feel disjointed, but after several rewatches, it all comes together quite well. \n\n*Threads* is a dark, twisted, cold, depressing, bleak, realistic depiction of nuclear conflict. It is hopeless and horrible. We see humans burning in nuclear firestorms, the effects of radiation poisoning, babies with birth defects, the absolute hopelessness of humanity in such a situation. \n\nWhile not a \"traditional\" movie, especially in the context of this sub, it is one of the most impacting movies I've ever watched. It absolutely fascinates me, to see just what humanity is capable of doing to itself, and the short-sightedness inherent in all of us. I would love to hear some thoughts from other people who have seen this one.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "It had been over 25 years since I had watched The Deer Hunter. I know the movie has already been discussed about thoroughly here, but this post is more about the personal experience of re-watching it.    \n\nWe only got a tv and VCR in 1990 (when I was 7) and back then I watched everything I could get my hands on.  \n\nI was recording movies almost every night and kept everything I liked, watching stuff over and over again.  \n\nMy mom was really cool about me watching harder things like Lynch, Copolla, Kubrick, etc.  \n\nI really liked Dennis Hopper, de Niro, Sean Penn (We’re no angels was one of my favourites), Kevin Costner, Ray Liotta and Arnold Schwarzenegger of course.  \n\nI don’t know how many times I watched The Deer Hunter, but it was a lot. Somehow, I only remembered the hunting scenes and the Russian Roulette scenes. (Crazy that my mom let me watch that, but I had seen Platoon and Casualities of War by then too, and my dad always gave a thorough explanation about the historical frames of movies)  \n\nSo I started to watch Deer Hunter this weekend for the first time in a while and I was shocked by a few aspects.  \n\n\\-\tThe length. Took me three sittings. Tha movie is looong.\n\n\\-\tThe acting: de Niro, Walken and Savage are so good. It was really refreshing to see how natural they are. Walken and De Niro have become caricatures by now, but back then they were so intense. I loved their game.\n\n\\-\tThe intensity of the slower parts of the movie. I only remembered the fast scenes, but it’s really the slower scenes in between that are actually telling the story. I wonder how the public opinion viewed topics like ptsd back in the 70s.\n\nI’m not a fan of pre-90s movies to be honest. I like to watch them for art’s sake, but I think most of them are really outdated, and my film-watching focus is on staying up to date with new, interesting stuff. I still enjoy Ozu, Kurosawa, Kubrick, Spielberg and other great ones, but never looking forward to so called classics.  \n\nThe Deer Hunter surprised me pleasantly however and I’m very glad I gave it a new try.",

        "text": "Know when you watch a film that everybody else loves but you just  don't get it? Kim Jee-Woon's A Bittersweet Life hits that note for me. I want to like it, in fact I was pretty hyped as a huge fan of his revenge horror, I Saw The Devil. I knew it was a stylish mobster film. When the film opened with a 'deep' buddhist quote, I thought, \"I hope this isn't representative of what's gonna follow\". Of course it totally was.\n\nAnyone else watched it, and if so, whatcha think? I feel like it was a Tarantino film that wanted to be both cool and lackadaisal with a gritty realistic touch (classic Tarantino), and a serious philosophical film, and for me it failed at both. The philosophy just really fell flat for me. The Tarantino stuff tiptoed just too far over \"cinematically stylish\" and into the realm of \"totally unrealistic\",  especially towards the end, and the one 'funny part' felt really like it was trying to copy a Tarantino film, but ineffectually. It got me to chuckle, but I think part of that was just how goofy it was (\"They literally just drove into a wall for no reason\"). I'll say that it was my favourite part of the film, because as out-of-place as it felt for the rest of the film, I actually enjoyed it.\n\nAlso: Hee-Soo. Can we talk about Hee-Soo? Because I need to know what these two men saw in her that was so great they'd throw away their lives for her. I know, I know, love isn't logical, but still. She was carefree (careless?) and maybe a teeny bit spoiled/entitled. And she was cheating on the mob boss (though it later came to light that maybe she'd been rejecting him and he was more or less forcing himself on her, this was much later and after the protagonist had already fallen head over heels). Maybe this is one of those \"to each their own\" things.\n\nIf I were to be forgiving on the film, I'd say that the POINT is that our protagonist turns from the perfectly professional killer into an almost childish figure (the mob boss even says this). But it just wasn't that compelling to me. By the end I felt entirely indifferent about his revenge motivation. I mean, he betrayed his boss and then killed EVERYBODY involved. That's gotta be some serious justification but ... it wasn't really justified at all. Compared to the motivation in I Saw The Devil, it just felt like a tantrum.\n\nAnd can we talk about the scene where it's him with a gun versus one mobster with a knife? And he gets stabbed repeatedly? Come on, man. Again, I might be trying too hard to give the film the benefit of the doubt, but I have to believe that he WANTED to die for that to happen. I actually figured \"he must be wearing some kind of stab proof vest with a blood pack\", because as implausible as that was, it made more sense than not expecting the other guy to try and pull a weapon.\n\nI will say to the film's benefit that the cinematography was excellent and so were the actors. In fact as much as I've ranted about this film, I wouldn't say it's a TERRIBLE film, just not terribly good. ",

        "text": "Let me start by saying I like Primer. Hell, I watched it three times in the span of two days. It's a great fucking movie, almost unbelievably great considering the budget. **However, everyone thinks Primer is deeper than it actually is**. Due the film's reputation as this super complex time travel movie, people go into it with the mentality of \"Everything that's confusing is just a failure to understand on my part\". There's no consideration that a $7,000 budget movie likely had many production oversights, especially one with a plot as ambitious as Primer's (ambitious is an understatement). In my opinion, it's overly difficult to wrap your mind around largely because the movie does a poor job telling critical parts of the story. For example the Thomas Granger arc is simply not fleshed out at all, yet everyone leaves the movie thinking it's some kind of ignorance on their part. \"Something time travel-related happened which I didn't understand. Therefore, I must not be understanding it correctly\". No. The movie just doesn't give you the necessary pieces to put the puzzle together. It could've been an oversight in writing, filming, editing, whatever. Regardless, Granger's timeline is not adequately explained in the final cut of the film. \n\nThere are so many other oversights/plot holes too. What is Aaron's motivation for using the fail-safe box in the first place, full well knowing he'll have to drug his clone and dash him in the attic? He should have a pretty strong motivation for going through with such a crazy plan. Well it's implied he travels back to record all the important conversations, and execute the perfect plan to stop Rachel's ex at the party. But it's already known the ex didn't actually kill anyone - he was posturing. Why would Aaron screw up his whole family life, double-cross his best friend, and generally put himself in great peril by time travelling when no one got hurt anyway. Rachel isn't even his crush! It's Abe's crush! For that arc to make any sense whatsoever, it should be Abe going back in time to try and get the crazy ex locked up for good. It's subtly suggested at a few points that Abe is envious of Aaron's family, but never the other way around. Oops!\n\nI guess the takeaway from all this is how we tend to give films credit for being smarter than they probably are. And the more ambitious a movie's plot is, the more we want to believe it's a perfectly woven masterpiece. Fans of movies like Primer, Inception, Interstellar etc. assume every unanswered question has a perfectly logical answer buried within. The truth is producers don't have every aspect of their fictional universe mapped out. In pre-production or production stages, they don't know exactly what movie they're going to end up with. There are always going to be oversights..\n\n\n",

I have watched both of them recently, expecting something terrible considering the way the films are criticized by critics and fans of the series, and I was surprised by how much I ended up enjoying them.\n\nAlien³ I though was a great, meaningful deconstruction of the second movie and the return to a more horrific and mysterious version of the Alien; while I liked Aliens a lot, I disliked how it dismystified the xenomorphs in my eyes, because the ideas presented by Scott in the first film made them much more mysterious with the \"Eggmorphing\". Fiorina 161 was an interesting setting, the design for it looked great, the prisoners being horrible people tied to a theme of them sacrificing themselves for a greater good, and I quite liked the new xenomorph (the Runner, or the Dragon). Plus I think it had great performances by Sigourney Weaver, Charles S. Dutton, Charles Dance (he died too soon, but I get why), and Paul McGann. The Assembly Cut is more superior, of course, but I actually preferred the dog as a host (because I think it makes more sense and makes the situation more tragic). I know the film is hardly from David Fincher himself with all the interference and rewrites, but I think he leaves his mark on the universe.\n\nResurrection I quite enjoyed, I liked how the image was darker and the film presented an almost farce-like outlook of the series. I think it brought the best from Alien and Aliens, with both the setting being cosmic, claustrophobic and eerie, complemented by the score, as well as the action sequences. I think the pirate crew of the Betty were well realized characters, and imo, better than the prisoners from 3. While it's widely seen as worse than 3, I think it's better simply by the fact it accomplished what Jean-Pierre Jeunet sought to accomplish, including the fact he had more freedom with the movie. The cast does a good job, mainly Sigourney Weaver, Ron Perlman, Winona Ryder and Michael Wincott (who also died too soon). The ideas presented with cloning I though were also well done, and complemented the four movies by having Ripley being literally a part of what she always fought against, giving new perspective.\n\nThese are my opinions, what do you think? What did you think about them?",

        "text": "“November” is a 2017 very atmospheric estonian film set in a medieval world full of strange creatures and unusual occurrences. Shot in gorgeous black and white cinematography and playing out like some sort of twisted fairy tale, director Rainer Sarnet shows his visual mastery and capacity to make such an unusual world come to life. A film that went on quiet last year, picking a few awards at festivals and with the local academy, but in spite of being selected as Estonia’s entry for the Best Foreign Language Picture Oscar, it went unnoticed by academy members. Nevertheless, for its aesthetic prowess and its fantastical inventiveness “November” is one movie that is very well seeking out. It seems to be influenced by the likes of Bergman, Tarr, Haneke and Vláčil, and if you’re familiar with the works of such directors you know you’re in for a crazy and existential ride.\n\nThe setting is a small rural village in which all sorts of fantastical elements come into play: the spirits of the dead come back to the world to pay visit to their loved ones, the black plague comes in various guises to exact its judgement (and yet, it can surprisingly be reasoned with), a girl seems to have a unusual symbiotic relationship with a wolf (is she herself the wolf? does she command the wolf? can she feel and experience everything the wolf does?), and the devil rumages around the woods making deals with the villagers to bring their “kratts” to life, which are basically inanimate objects fashioned in some practical sense and given life to serve as helpers of their masters. While all of this is going on, the main story concerns Liina (Rea Lest), who is in love with Hans (Jörgen Liik), who in turn is smithen as soon as he sees the daughter of the Baron (Jette Loona Hermanis) for the first time. In order to turn their unrequitted love into what they desire, both of them recur to magical means to make their loved ones fall for them, but the consequences are not what they expected.\n\nhttps://breakingthefourthwallsite.wordpress.com/2018/08/18/november-estonian-dark-fantasy/",

        "text": "[Video](https://youtu.be/OUo8I_ek1HY)\n\nFor me, in films, a lot happens in the silences that precede or follow the action. They give you the space to absorb the essence of what is being shown on the screen. If done correctly the silences can have that ‘a-ha!’ moment, and something transformative happens inside you. Believe it or not, it’s during these beats that the most communication happens (at least for me). They have the power to make an instant connection with the human consuming the content. And if not done properly it feels off and noisy.  \n\nThese beats can come from writing, or from an actor (who has a good sense of timing), or from the editing (you can see it quite often in Coen brothers films.) \n\nMidnight in Paris is one film that’s a good example of getting the beat right. And especially because it’s a comedy. As you all know, timing is one of the most important aspects of comedy, I think the film does a pretty good job at getting it right. I have tried to demonstrate that in the video above. Let me know what you guys feel about it.",

That said he appears in both movies for what? Less than a quarter of running time. This has gotten to the point where Pacino was even considered supporting role at the oscars. \n\nI'm saying this after rewatching The Godfather for the 6th time (I'm Italian so it's obligatory viewing for understanding how Americans picture us thanks to Italoamericans) and \"getting it\" just now. I always admire it as a beautiful and iconic movie but I never understood why it was so universally loved beyond the cultish status it has. Now for the first time I was able to see it as a movie about succession with Pacino, the innocent-looking-but-not-so-innocent son, as a protagonist and it actually deserve the hype it gets as one of the greatest American movies ever (yet to rewatch part 2 and see if that one deserves the hype, I don't have fond memories of that one)\n\nSame goes for Apocalypse Now. Only around the 4th time I was able to watch it as a movie with protagonist Willard.\n\nDoes anyone feel the same? Who's \"fault\" is this? Marketing? The Fans? Or it's Brando's \"fault\" for being too good and overshadowing the other actors? ",

        "author": "Carlislegendary",

        "text": "[Dr. No 1962](https://i.redd.it/l8kbp11lijg11.jpg)\n\n[https://thefilmera.com/2018/08/16/james-bond-retrospective-dr-no/](https://thefilmera.com/2018/08/16/james-bond-retrospective-dr-no/) Trust me when I say it reads better on our site format. along with pictures.\n\n**I** love *James Bond* movies. I didn’t like sports or hunting with my dad, so we bonded (no pun intended) over spy flicks. I thought I’d revisit every single *Bond* film for the site, dissecting it in a juicy way for everyone to enjoy. If you’ve never seen a *Bond* film before, you’re in for a treat. The best thing about the *Bond* franchise is it wonderfully builds its iconic imagery and rewards the experienced viewer. The more *Bond* films you see, the more you like them.\n\n***So let’s go over how I’m approaching these:***\n\n1. Mainstream, EON films only. No *Never Say Never Again*. No Peter Sellers/Woody Allen *Casino Royale*. You get the picture.  \n2. I’m doing these in release order. I’ll reference future films, but I won’t judge them by future film standards.  \n3. **There will be spoilers.**  \nAnd after that, everything else is going to be self-explanatory. It will remain consistent throughout every film, so if you’re wondering why I talk about the theme song in every review, it’s because it’s important. Essential even. All right not really, but I like them, okay?\n\n# Dr. No (1962)\n\nThe best thing I can say about *Dr. No* as the first film of a franchise is how graceful it is. There are definitely some problems with it that raise an eyebrow, but for how old it is and for everything that occurred in its footsteps, it actually plays wonderfully. A lot of the *Bond*staples start here for good reason, and where it diverts from the future *Bond* norm actually makes it fresh to a modern audience. Just be ready for some racist, sexist stuff.\n\nThe film starts in Jamaica where an MI6 chief named John Strangways is murdered, and back home in London, Bond is summoned to investigate the mysterious disappearance. Bond goes to Jamaica, gets followed, meets USA CIA agent Felix Leiter and discovers there’s a mysterious island called Crab Key, which Strangways was investigating. The island is run by a mysterious foreign character named Dr. No. Bond convinces Leiter and their captain friend to drop him off and investigate Crab Key. There Bond meets a woman named Honey Ryder, and they are eventually caught by Dr. No’s forces. Imprisoned, there’s a dinner scene where Dr. No lays out his evil plan to disrupt a space launch and decides to kill Ryder, leaving Bond for later. Bond escapes and foils the plan saves Ryder, and escapes the destructing island with her. Leiter and American forces find the two kissing and having a good time.\n\nThe film starts in an interesting fashion; the song of the film is actually just the actual John Barry *Bond Theme*. It’s a good start, and the theme is amazing because it’s actually played to completion. I was worried the theme was going to play too much as a motif throughout the film, but it starts to taper down once Bond is in Jamaica. The intro animation is a tasteful design transitioning from colored dots to dancing silhouettes, probably a hint towards what seems like a film that will start as an intriguing contemporary spy mystery but will turn into a fun romp. The film doesn’t feature Bond at the start and actually starts with the assassination of Strangways. The first time you see the legendary Connery portrayal of Bond is him playing cards head-to-head with a beautiful woman. You’re told so much about the character from this scene: he’s dangerous, smooth, charming, and knows when to leave the table. Bond in this film has a good bit of humanity to him, something that gets lost pretty quickly in the following films. He is scolded by his superior for carrying an inferior handgun and his office flirting, and he also shows signs of fear. Not many times in the series does he confide to the Bond girl that, “I’m scared too.”\n\nThe film’s plot structure also feels fresh as a spy film because it only really feels like a standard spy film in the last act. The first two acts really function as a detective story. It starts with the crime, Bond gets the case, he goes around the location and asks the standard cop questions about the victim. Some betrayal happens, and there’s this looming idea that Bond is in over his head. According to my memory, we’ll see if I’m proven right in future installments, Bond’s most impressive and useful skill as an agent is his bluffing. Often his bluff saves him from certain death, and I think him lying to Dr. No about British Intelligence knowing about the island and No’s past is pretty smart. Leiter knew about the island, but Bond’s lie was based on undercutting No’s immense pride. No loses faith in keeping Bond around, but the bluff makes him cautious on killing him. At least until the plan succeeds.\n\nA lot. This film looks and feels gorgeous. Vibrant color, you practically feel the heat. There are some good location shots to allow you to enjoy Jamaica. The plot is basic enough to follow even if it feels like Bond just kinda stumbles into the final act. That’ll happen a lot in these films. The Bond girls are beautiful, and the action is nice. It’s not very technically impressive. Most you’ll see is a car chase, a spooky spider, and a nice evil fortress escape. That’s all made up for it by never taking too long. A major problem with a lot of Bond movies is they’ll have a pacing problem and start to lose steam. This one—running at an hour and a half—never wears out its welcome.\n\nThis is probably the best time to talk about Connery’s portrayal of Bond. I’ll probably talk about him again, but it’s really important to say how much he sells this role. A generic handsome Bond wouldn’t be able to pull off this kind of fantasy. That’s not to say he’s perfect, but what’s special about Connery is he has both competent (and distinct) acting skill and a very special screen charisma. Most people will only mention the charisma, but we can see what an actor with little talent but good presence looks like only a few movies away when we get to George Lazenby. Connery knows how to put on a face when Bond needs to appear sad or solemn or weak or mean. Charm isn’t the only thing Connery offers. What’s also nice about Connery is the distinct presence has a roughness to him. Bond in the books (this is probably one of the few times I’ll mention the books) is way rougher than in the films, and the screenplay tried to get rid of that edge to the character, but Connery can still seize that energy. That’s remarkable, and that’s what you won’t see in someone like Roger Moore.\n\nWhat doesn’t work here will be an ongoing problem with the Bond films. This mainly goes down to the outdated cultural archetypes and storytelling clichés. Bond’s a disgusting brute and monster. He treats women as disposable, and you get so much hope when you see Ryder for the first time, and Bond doesn’t sleep with her for the bulk of their time together. That’s what you want, but when Ryder reveals her backstory, it’s depressingly pathetic in a patronizing sense. A missing father, no education, just collecting seashells on a dangerous island waiting for a dashing hero to save her? Then when Bond saves the day and gets her out of her trap, he decides that’s the time to make whoopee and the credits roll almost as fast as my eyes.\n\nThen we get to Jamaica and Dr. No. This problem lessens in future films (save for some…*notable*… exceptions), but that’s mainly because they start to target the Soviets as their straw-man. This film is pretty racist. The strongest black character in a location with primarily black people is a superstitious and subservient boat captain who is scared by a supposed dragon. It doesn’t help that Bond is such a white fantasy, trying to be the epitome of culture and taste and acting so superior for it. It’s disgusting. Dr. No is a mysterious Asian *Fu Manchu* character without the beard. Played by a white man. Awful.\n\n Looking forward, we have an entire catalog to run through. It’s a little too early to say what we’re going to get into on this adventure, but after this film, we’re going to start to see some interesting developments. First, Connery is going to lose interest in the Bond character. It doesn’t happen immediately, but we’re going to see lesser performances and an almost eagerness to escape the screen. Second, the studio isn’t going to know what to do with the stories. The next one is one of my personal favorites, *From Russia With Love*. That’s a very tasteful thriller with relatively little sensationalism in it. It actually intellectually explores the Cold War culture, has a wonderful romance developing throughout the film, and has an emotionally engaging climax. Then after that film? *Goldfinger*. Where once there was taste, there is now a cartoon. Only, *Goldfinger* might be the most influential Bond film to the series behind *Dr. No*. The franchise walks a fine line between both styles of a story and we’ll see which one wins out. \n\n***What did I drink?:***\n\nI drank a gin martini during this one. 2/3 gin, 1/3 vermouth, added a lemon in tribute to Bond, shook it and drank it when Bond asked if his drink from Dr. No was made from vodka, “Yes, of course.” Kill me.\n\nsee the rating at [https://thefilmera.com/2018/08/16/james-bond-retrospective-dr-no/](https://thefilmera.com/2018/08/16/james-bond-retrospective-dr-no/)",

Reading up on it, it seems \"Lady on the lake\"(1946) was the first to do it all the way through, although personally, I'll give a lot of credit to Dark Passage for pulling it off so well and how good it fits the story as well, even if it \"only\" lasted for 37 minutes. \n\nWhat do you guys think of the first-person perspective? Is it a technique that is undervalued that should be used more? Or is it just a gimmick? \n\nPersonally, before this movie, I might just have sold off the technique as “gimmicky” even if I had never really seen it, but this movie convinced me otherwise. \n\nObviously, share any good examples of a movie that has first person POV for a portion or the whole film and uses it to its advantage!",

        "text": "*Note: I want to preface this post by stating that I am a black man, who has lived in both the USA and Africa, so none of my points are being made from the POV of an individual who doesn't understand what the movie means to sections of the population.*\n\nI felt insulted by the insistence that I had to absolutely embrace Black Panther or I was committing some form of racial betrayal. It's a competent movie, and yes, it makes pertinent points, but none of what it says has not been said by other, better movies. Unfortunately, the primary subject matter is popular right now, and the confluence of political and social trends means we were never going to get objective reviews of that movie from any large swathe of critics. \n\nThe movie essentially functions in the exact way you might describe horror and romance movies or other similar genres--many of its inherent faults are overlooked because the majority of the audience (or at least the most vocal minority) came into the movie looking first and foremost for certain elements from the narrative; in the case of BP, it was the message of peacable black empowerment. Once those statements were delivered, they resulted in a sort of halo effect on the rest of the movie, and the audience was largely, passively and willingly, blind to the movie's faults. The upshot of that was that the movie was not judged for its merits as a cinematic experience or even a piece of art, but as a vehicle for delivering appropriate, sanitised, approved political statements. \n\nBlack Panther's utility is both immediately stark and more than a little opaque. For one, I'm pleased we got an adaptation of a major black superhero to the widest audience that any such movie has ever reached. Certainly, for those who champion the cause of representation in cinema, this can only be viewed as a net positive.  My gripe stems from the fact that BP, unwittingly or otherwise, played into an aspect of the political and social narrative that I find absolutely grating: the black man / hero must be a black man / hero before he is anything else. T'Challa is conflicted with the recognition of his father's mistakes and the need to reconcile Wakanda's tradition with the modern day global village as it were, and this is certainly a respectable arc. However, our antagonist is where the muddied waters reach their deepest. Killmonger is  a villain that I feel would have worked better if he were delivering a singular message: either a radical solution to the mistreatment of black people or an indictment of the sins of the fathers. His connection of T'Chaka's killing of his father to Wakanda's overall isolationism is tenuous at best, and the movie hand waves away what seems to an omission. Certainly, there is argument that N'Jobu dying at his own brother's hand because he had become a revolutionary spurred Killmonger's resentment, but it never comes across as more than simple padding for the character's backstory. The character we're presented with makes sense as an avatar of either the vengeance he wants to enact on the rest of the world or the reckoning for Wakanda's past. Centering him as the representation of both weakens the narrative and provides little fuel for understanding who he is and what actually drives him. As it is, it looks like window dressing for a character that they didn't really want to flesh out.\n\nWhich brings me back around to the intersection of political narratives and corporate-backed movies. In my estimation, all of the messages in Black Panther regarding black empowerment are nothing more than Disney's shrewd manipulation and timely capitalisation of current social trends. The movie makes constant reference to black people's plight, both present and past, yet it examines this beyond the merest surface level. Disney, in their eternal cleverness, robed the movie with messages of social justice and reform in a sleight of hand that guaranteed them two things: the first was, of course, massive global appeal; the second was it allowed them to carefully sneak past critics. They accomplished the second feat by lacing their tentpole blockbuster with seemingly smart overtures relating to race relations and legacies of injustice, and combining it with their tried-and-known-to-be-true crowdpleaser format for the MCU. The end-product is a movie that uses its racial messaging as camouflage to sneak past critics who might otherwise be much harsher and still deliver a movie that, ultimately, says nothing. Of course, ultimately saying nothing has been a cornerstone of the MCU template, and my frustrations with the lack of growth in some of these characters could make up its own post. It is especially egregious though, because of they hype and sheer media frenzy surrounding Black Panther.\n\nIn the end, BP as a movie ended up coasting the best of both worlds: social commentary that evades the stern criticism that a movie of that nature warrants, and an easily relatable blockbuster that guarantees returns (You can argue on whether or not Disney knew how much global appeal the movie would have, but that's neither here nor there. They absolutely knew it would be immensely profitable, one way or another.) By riding the wave that Disney knew would be generated by the prospect of a major black superhero in a time when representation is at the forefront of discussion, Disney essentially skirted away from delivering an actually genuine movie. Worse, BP never had a chance to stand alone based on its own merits as a movie and not as two hour corporate soliloquy designed to tickle the masses. Through the union of corporate machinations and overly-enthusiastic proponents of representation, Black Panther was vaulted to the top of a pantheon of movies whose best products it doesn't even come close to touching. Its message, content and power aside, was used as a shield against any potential earnest assessment of the movie.\n\nEssentially, the truth of BP is akin to a Terminator: a machine churned out on the most efficient cinematic conveyor belt of all time, whose fleshy exterior belies a thoroughly disenchanting movie. And if there's anything that the numbers and discourse show, it's this: social justice is another product to be marketed and sold for profit, and [boy does it sell](https://www.google.com/search?client=opera&amp;q=black+panther+box+office&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8).",

        "text": "PREFACE\n\n**i. 10 Years of Films**\n\nA decade-long journey of programming, starting 2007 through 2017, gave this filmmaker a special lens to witness the coming-of-age of Korean American cinema. KAFFNY (Korean American Film Festival New York) was not originally from an impetus of my own, but out of a request by others, to do something “for the community.” When a lofty vision of a huge festival in Flushing to commemorate the 100 years of Korean-American immigration was heavily watered down, relocating our film screening to the basement of Dae Dong Palace, a friend and I quickly maneuvered to secure a venue at Anthology Film Archives to save our reputations. The turnout that year and fresh possibilities in subsequent years, has kept me volunteering until today – now passing it on to newer visionaries.\n\nUnfairly, but understandably, I always have to explain that Korean American cinema is not Korean cinema, nor a subset of Asian American cinema. As a student educated in critical race theory, it is obvious to me that the term “Asian American” is a political term, branded after the “African American” civil rights movement. Without that understanding, most people assume these are objective categories which neatly capture the infinite range of culture. However, even “America” as it is semantically defined in today’s culture, hardly captures the breadth of cultural interchange that takes place here, beyond a liberal and conservative estimation by those in the perceived majority who control our mainstream communications, both directly and indirectly. When is the last time we had a president that speaks more than English, which by the way, is the language of our colonial masters: England? When is the last time anyone considered that the term “America,” actually captures all of this entire hemisphere, i.e., the “New World”? And why do we celebrate Columbus Day, when this nation is named after Amerigo Vespucci? It should be obvious, “America” is a concept much bigger than solely the “United States of” America.\n\nMerely by finally perceiving the cultural prisons in which we find ourselves, doesn’t automatically and suddenly extricate you. In fact, it begins a long, inescapable nightmare, the oppressed and the oppressors alike becoming unwitting zombie actors: one oppressing out of fear, one in fear of more oppression, not unlike the Stanford Prison Experiment. The final step is a process of understanding the prison’s weaknesses balanced against your own learned abilities, in order to implement a practical means of near-death escape – for yourself and perhaps others, like a Shawshank Redemption, which most of us shall never taste anyway. While cinema has been used to oppress and brainwash, like any tool, it can easily be used for good, to express the virtues of humanity, to powerfully smash walls.\n\nI find it is more meaningful and accurate to depict ourselves as a means for understanding the interaction between cultures, outside of the colonial lens, which is not often demonstrated at even the most prestigious international festivals. Expending any precious volunteer energy to form some reactionary identity against an arbitrary, fickle enemy is a enervating distraction with the symptoms, when one could rather proactively highlight the cultural physics of the natural world. Such vision of Korean American cinema represents horizontally-networked cultural relationship cinema, not vertically-segregated cultural identity politics…\n\n**I. KOREAN AMERICAN FRONTIER**\n\nPhillip Ahn (1905–1978) is the first Korean American born in the US… and the first and most successful Korean American actor in Hollywood history. With hundreds of credits on many American classics, working with stars like Bing Crosby in ANYTHING GOES (1936), Shirley Temple in STOWAWAY (1936), Elvis Presley in PARADISE, HAWAIIAN STYLE (1966), as well as John Wayne, Gary Cooper, Humphrey Bogart, Burt Lancaster, Frank Sinatra, Key Luke, Richard Loo, Ethel Merman, Julie Andrews, and Mae West. Phillip would be given his star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame in 1984, the first for an Asian American film actor. Ahn also starred in the independent film DAUGHTER OF SHANGHAI (1937) opposite Chinese American trailblazer and childhood friend Anna May Wong.\n\nAhn is also the first son of Dosan Ahn Chang-ho, a famous Korean patriot who devoted his life to winning Korean independence from Japanese colonial rule. Ahn’s parents were the first couple to immigrate from Korea to America and his mother Helen was the second Korean woman to arrive – these pre-1924 immigrants self-termed as the Korean American “Pioneer” generation. Ahn too, was also civic-minded, one of his major achievements bringing the massive bronze Korean Friendship Bell to San Pedro, establishing Busan as a sister city to Los Angeles.\n\nAhn's mother first refused to accept his interest in acting, even after famed director Douglas Fairbanks offered him a job during high school from an impromptu screen test. When his father later visited from Korea, he saw the value in the art of acting and gave his blessing, as long as Ahn made it his goal to be the best. \n\nAhn also drew some controversy for playing evil Japanese characters for World War II propaganda, but he saw it as his contribution to the Korean cause. His last role would be playing Master Kan in the TV series KUNG FU (1972). After Ahn, there were no new faces in Korean American cinema until long after 1965 when the racial quotas set in the Asian Exclusion Act of 1924 were lifted. \n\nThe Asian Exclusion Act of 1924 is a major feature of Korean American cinema, placing an artificial 40-year time divide between immigrants coming before 1924 and those coming after the 1965 repeal during the Civil Rights era in the US. The law stopped in its tracks, the process of assimilation for the Korean American community, and is perhaps the worst single act against the its cinema. In fact, if there was no Asian Exclusion Act, one might never have expected the Los Angeles Riots in 1992 to rock the Korean American community so hard, where Korean American immigrants were portrayed in popular media as foreign invaders, economically preying on low-income African Americans in the area of South Central LA, now called South LA.\n\nPioneer Korean Americans who came to Los Angeles in the early 1900s, were segregated into the same areas with African Americans who were refugees arriving from the Midwest Dust Bowl agricultural tragedy. The early Koreans only remembered a unified Korea, while today’s immigrants know a Korea divided into North and South. The Korean United Presbyterian Church was built by the Pioneer generation on West Jefferson Boulevard in South LA in 1905. On August 15th every year, they continue to celebrate the day Korea won independence from Japan in 1945. In contrast, Post-1965 immigrants remember and observe April 29th, as the date of the Riots in 1992, illustrating the artificial divide between these communities. \n\nThe Asian Exclusion Act of 1924 was only lifted over forty years later in 1965, spanning about two generations, making it so that new immigrants would have to start to assimilate from square one. In fact, the Pioneer Korean Americans could barely speak any Korean anymore to help the new Koreans assimilate anyway. Residing within the same city, they shared ancestry, but experienced a time separation.\n\nMeanwhile, Sessue Hayakawa (1886 – 1973) became the first male sex symbol of Hollywood long before and the precursor to Rudolph Valentino, his fame rivaling that of Douglas Fairbanks and Charlie Chaplin. Starting in the silent era, with THE CHEAT (1915), directed by Cecil B. DeMille, Hayakawa became a top leading man for romantic dramas in the 1910s and early 1920s. He transitioned into sound films, ‘talkies,’ including DAUGHTER OF THE DRAGON (1931) opposite Anna May Wong. He also diversified his body of work with Westerns and action films, but was mostly typecast as a villain and exotic Asian lover that white women could not have. In response, Hayakawa independently produced 23 films and earned $2 million a year. Most recently, he appeared in THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI (1957) for which he was nominated for both an Academy Award and Golden Globe Award. In acting, Hayakawa sought to bring muga, or the \"absence of doing\", to his performances.\n\nAnna May Wong (1905–1961) was an American actress, considered to be the first Chinese American Hollywood movie star and with international recognition. While often playing a stereotypical \"Dragon Lady\" role, as in the silent Douglas Fairbanks picture THE THIEF OF BAGDAD (1924), and the Josef von Sternberg talkie DAUGHTER OF THE DRAGON (1931), playing opposite Hayakawa, Wong caught the attention of audiences and critics alike. American anti-miscegenation laws prevented her from sharing an on-screen kiss with any person of another race, even if the character was Asian, but being portrayed by a white actor. Her roles limited in Hollywood, Wong traveled to Europe and became a sensation there, starring in films like SHANGHAI EXPRESS (1932) where many critics say she upstaged her friend Marlene Dietrich. Eventually returning to America, she became more vocal about Chinese roles and acted in some smaller, but more lasting films like the DAUGHTER OF SHANGHAI (1937). Later, she turned her efforts to the Chinese cause against Japan, including the Second Sino-Japanese War.\n\nGiven the incredible success of these Asian Americans in the early days of Hollywood cinema, in both silent and sound pictures, it gives pause to consider if this contributed to the race-based Asian Exclusion Act of 1924.\n\n**II. HONG KONG &amp; TAIWANESE AMERICAN INDEPENDENTS**\n\nFast forward to when the Asians were no longer excluded by law in America... 1965.\n\nPost-1965 Hong Kong and Taiwanese Americans provided early role models for Korean American filmmakers. Long after the artificial talent drought created by the Asian Exclusion Act of 1924, Hong Kong American Bruce Lee would create the basis for a globally popular film genre. Lee’s father was a famous Cantonese opera actor in Hong Kong. From infancy to age 18, Lee had already appeared in twenty films. He attended an international school, where he would excel at cha-cha dancing and boxing, but as his streetfighting caught up with him, Lee would make his way across the Pacific to Seattle, where he studied drama and philosophy; to San Francisco and Oakland, where opened his first schools; then expanding to Los Angeles, teaching to all races Chinese martial arts, which at the time in America was generally considered inferior to Japanese Karate. Teaching non-Chinese people was against Chinese tradition and Lee would have to prevail in a challenge fight for this right. He would later devise his own martial art called Jeet Kun Do, blending the strengths of all major fighting styles, even boxing and fencing, doing away with inherent nationalism of styles, to promote the individual martial artist above all.\n\nOverwhelmed by the expansion of his schools, Lee eventually decided that movies would be the best way to broadly spread his martial arts philosophy. He would make a name for himself playing Kato in THE GREEN HORNET (1966), which also earned him fame back in Hong Kong. However, after Warner Bros. reworked his “The Warrior” concept and renamed it KUNG FU (1972) casting a different lead, Lee returned to Hong Kong where he would go on to to his record-breaking star debut in THE BIG BOSS (1971), even more box office success with FIST OF FURY (1972), then full creative control with WAY OF THE DRAGON (1972). Hollywood came calling with the co-production ENTER THE DRAGON (1973), which would cement his name, while the post-humous GAME OF DEATH (1978), containing only scenes shot before his untimely death, augmented his legend. \n\nHis fame rising mostly after his passing, Lee single-handedly hatched a global phenomenon, creating a film industry in Hong Kong, while inspiring countless people across the world to learn Chinese martial arts. Without Lee, there would be no Jackie Chan, no Jet Li. Bruce Lee would pass before enjoying his fame, but many would exploit his persona to create a new genre of films called “Bruceploitation.” Productions would give diverse actors spoof Bruce Lee names with different spellings to promote their own movies. In fact, the most popular actors included a Chinese “Bruce Le,” a Taiwanese going by “Bruce Li,” and a Korean “Dragon Lee.” Lee’s legend would continue to receive homage treatment in American cult classics like THE LAST DRAGON (1985), with the African American character “Bruce Leroy.” However, while non-Asian and Asian leads have proliferated in the martial arts genre, another Asian American lead has yet to arise since Lee.\n\nHong-Kong American director Wayne Wang is a pioneer for having breakout hits in both the independent and mainstream cinemas. His gritty black-and-white 16mm mystery comedy CHAN IS MISSING (1982) is a simple and ingenious expression of the depth and complexities of the Chinese American enclave in San Francisco, while following protagonists trying to locate a vague character who has disappeared with their money. The story of ambiguous identity is smartly employed to relate the experience of being an Asian American, while keeping the story fresh. Truly it is a triumph and the cornerstone of modern Asian American cinema. \n\nIn his Hollywood followup THE JOY LUCK CLUB (1989), portraying the struggles and stories of Chinese American women in San Francisco, based on the novel by Amy Tan, Wang repeats critical and box-office success in the mainstream, then an unprecedented achievement for an Asian American director. However, within the community Wang received some criticism for the stereotypical depictions of Asian American males, very differently drawn than in his low-budget breakout. \n\nAng Lee is a Taiwanese filmmaker who studied in the US, but with his debut films, he demonstrated a passion for exploring the stories of the Chinese American experience. In PUSHING HANDS (1992), a grandfather who teaches Tai Chi, leaves Beijing for New York to live with his grandson and white daughter-in-law, and must learn to navigate his Confucian traditions within American individuality. In THE WEDDING BANQUET (1993), a gay son marries a mainland Chinese in NY to placate his parents abroad and cover up his same-sex relationship, but when they visit him to witness the marriage, drama ensues. Both films deeply mine the intensity of cultural conflicts coming out of the Chinese American experience.\n\nThen came Justin Lin with his Sundance breakout and crime-drama BETTER LUCK TOMORROW (2002), a.k.a. “BLT,” the first film to portray a darker side to Asian American characters, outside the stereotypical colonial lens. Loosely based on a true story of Korean American students in Fullerton, CA, the film follows a group of over-achieving high schoolers, who use their good grades as a cover to engage in drugs, alcohol, sex, thievery. Ultimately, they succumb to their envy of an older college guy who has it all too easy, and murder him. At the movie’s Sundance premiere Q&amp;A, following the screening, when a white audience member condemned the negative portrayals of Asian Americans, Roger Ebert himself defended the film, saying \"What I find very offensive and condescending about your statement is nobody would say to a bunch of white filmmakers, 'How could you do this to your people? \"This film has the right to be about this people, and Asian-Americans have the right to be whatever the hell they want to be. They do not have to 'represent' their people.\" \n\nBLT became the first film bought by MTV and opened the illustrious career of Justin Lin and new opportunities for his colleagues, as well as other Asian American filmmakers to follow. Lin would go on to insert Asian American narrative into Hollywood hits like THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS: TOKYO DRIFT (2006).\n\nUP NEXT IN VOL. 2: \n\nIII. THE MONUMENTAL FINE ARTISTS\n\nIV.

        "text": "**There** was a time when deciding what movie to watch was an event. I'm talking about when you'd pack yourselves into the family van and drive to the nearest Blockbuster. I'm talking about the ritual of picking up empty VHS boxes, one after another, looking for any signs that a movie could be the perfect antidote to everything you wanted. When a \"Two Big Thumbs Up!\" plastered across the cover was the only review you ever needed to make a decision.\n\nI remember the time I insisted on watching that movie no one heard about just because Jim Carrey was on the cover. We popped in the VHS only to realize halfway through that all we'd be getting was a pre-Ace Ventura Jim Carrey playing a bit role in a low-budget black comedy. Everyone knows the feeling of sitting in the dark as the credits roll, feeling everyone's collective regret and failure. And for 8 year-old me who chose the movie, it might be one of the most unexpected lessons of personal accountability that I can remember. But there was something so pure about committing yourself to something that you knew little about beyond what was on its cover.\n\nIn today's age of on-demand entertainment and crowd-sourcing of everything imaginable, looking up a movie's Rotten Tomatoes score is ubiquitous. I'm a follower. I avoid any movie or TV show that less than 40% of critics liked; anything above 90% is a must-watch. Everything in between needs to be googled and vetted, making sure that it's something worth my time. There are always exceptions; but in general, the higher the score, the more likely I am to watch it. If 90% of critics liked it, why wouldn't *I* like it?\n\nBut after nearly 20 years of using Rotten Tomatoes as an oracle for my movie choices, I've started to wonder if it's had any impact on not only how I consume media, but also how I make all my decisions.\n\nWhen I choose to watch a movie that has a 90% Rotten Tomatoes score over one that's at 40%, I'm making a *purely logical* decision. I'm saying to myself: \"Since 90% of people liked this movie, there's a better chance that I'll like it\". I'm choosing to watch the one that's less likely to suck.\n\n*But what does a Rotten Tomatoes score of 90% really mean?*\n\nIt means that at the very minimum, 90% of critics gave the movie a positive review. A positive review might call it a masterpiece that speaks to the times we live in. Another might say that it was \"fun for the whole family\". Others might say the movie was formulaic, but did just enough to entertain.  If a movie checks off enough boxes for as big an audience as possible, you've probably got a \"Certified Fresh\" movie on your hands. The movie probably won't disappoint, but it also might not impact you in any meaningful way or challenge your status quo.\n\nI'm not saying that all movies with high Rotten Tomatoes ratings are general catch-alls made to please as many people as possible. That's an gross simplification. What I'm getting at is that I've realized I need to think about whether I'm losing anything by making my decisions this way.\n\nLet's imagine there's a movie with a 5% rating. 95% of people disliked it (or did 95% of people think it fell just short of being good?). So what happened with the 5% that did like it? Are they clinically insane? Were they high?  Were they paid off by the movie company? What if this 5% didn't just enjoy the movie, but felt a deep connection to it? What if I could be part of that 5%? I'd never find out because I probably wouldn't watch it.\n\nRisk-mitigation is an inextricable part of our daily life. Need to drive somewhere? Better check the traffic on Google Maps. Want to go to a Mexican restaurant? Search for all the Mexican restaurants in a 25km radius and sort by rating. Want to find a date? Swipe left until you see a profile you like. We all want to save time, money and effort.  We want to avoid all unpleasant experiences and go straight to the good stuff. Who could blame anyone?\n\n*But are we losing something here?*\n\nLet me overreach for a moment to make a point: in our Western world, individual rights and freedom are arguably the pillars of a happy society. Children are told they are unique from the time they are born and perhaps carry this belief into adulthood. I certainly have. If I'm so unique, why couldn't I perhaps be a part of that 5% that liked that one movie? And why am I *only* consuming things that majority likes? Maybe because we're naturally social beings and want to understand and be part of what everyone else is talking about.  Or maybe because I want to save my time/money/pain and experience something that I'll *probably* like. Is there something wrong with that? Maybe, especially when you still end up being let down that you liked something but didn't *love* it.\n\nNonetheless, we can't change the fact that we live in fast-paced yet efficient times; we have algorithms directing us through traffic, successfully predicting our taste in music, and (albeit suspiciously) curating our news feeds. Regardless of how you may feel about these things, I'd like to think that if you look at the big picture, we're still better off now than we were before.\n\nBut I still get nostalgic. I remember when making a choice felt like sitting in the backseat with nothing but an earnest hope to see something great. I remember when I had an unflinching commitment to see it through till the end, even if it was just *another shitty movie*.\n\n",

        "text": "I just finished watching The Graduate and I'm kind of struggling with it. It's an incredibly well made film, beautifully scored. I was enjoying most of it. It was fun and playful, Hoffman nailed his role, it was giving me Lolita vibes (a film I love), but then the third act gets really disturbing.\n\nThe main character stalks this girl and hunts her down. This would've been fine with me if he was rejected and the film ended with him being a creepy loser, but I was disturbed by Elaine going along with it. I recall having a similar experience with Badlands. Was this behaviour common in the 60's? I find it really off-putting now. Maybe that's the point of the film...but it's Elaine that's really bothering me. Why was she not grossed out by him? We even find out that from her perspective, Ben raped Mrs. Robinson. And she's just okay with this? She wants to marry and ride off into the sunset with this predator?\n\nI don't mind having a villain as the protagonist (I love Taxi Driver) but I don't like how it feels like they were glorifying his actions. I know there is a realisation at the end that kicks in for both of them, but his actions still feel rewarded.\n\nThis really felt to me like it was going to be a perfect film because the rest of it truly is. But I can't seem to get over the film's values by the end of it. I'm sure this subject has been approached before in relation to this film, but I'm just curious if anyone else has thoughts to share on the matter.",

        "text": "Video version:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpgcfE7LhQU&amp;t=133s\n\nThis post does contain major spoilers, I pretty much give away the ending of the movie. With 10 Cloverfield Lane, I feel my enjoyment of the film was massively hampered by the fact that the ending was spoiled for me before going in, so all the way through I knew what the big reveal was. I mean it’s like watching The Usual Suspects or Shutter Island knowing what happens in the end, and it’s really irritating. I feel as though I was robbed of my first viewing of the movie and jumped straight to the second, which is where you usually pick up the clues that the film makers sprinkle throughout the film to enhance repeat viewings.\n\nThis movie was originally called The Cellar and revolved around a young woman who wakes up in an underground bunker after a car accident with an odd man claiming some kind of attack had occurred on the surface, and it is not safe to go up. The entire film is centred on the question as to whether he is telling the truth and is a hero for having saved her, or is lying and is some kind of sick psycho kidnapper. Does our heroine take the risk and try to escape to the surface, or does she remain in the claustrophobic bunker where cabin fever is eerily settling in? \n\nWhat happened then was, either during filming I guess or after it was completed, the project was bought by JJ Abrams production company who decided to turn the film into a cloverfield sequel of sorts, or at least have it set in the same universe. I really like the idea of different kinds of movies, different genres of films being released in the same franchise. It’s a major blunder I think that the likes of Disney’s Star Wars movies all have the same feel and tone, when they could easily make a comedy Star Wars one off, a small-scaled horror one etc. I like the idea of the cloverfield universe despite not being a fan of the original movie, but I’m not sure about its execution, starting with the end of 10 cloverfield lane. Our feeble, scared-stiffless protagonist eventually escapes the bunker, leaving the old man played by John Goodman in a puddle of acid and intensifying fire. After spending almost the entire runtime in the bunker she is finally free, now the film can end and leave her fate up to the viewer. But no.\n\nShe’s wearing a custom made gas mask with her body protected and then sees a flock of birds fly overhead, suggesting the air is breathable and not contaminated. Again, a good opportunity to close the picture either before or after she removes the gas mask. But no, because then the bunker then explodes which catches the attention of a massive alien spaceship, which comes hurtleing towards her, pooping out an worm-like alien and farting out some green, presumably infectious gas. You can spot the exact moment that Abrams hijacked the film with his overdone, CGI heavy, one-liner loving style kicks into place from the moment that the protagonist bizarrely nonchalantly says something along the lines of “You gotta be kidding me” after she witnesses proof of extra-terrestrial life right before her very eyes. \n\nFrom there it’s like the character was a completely different person, perhaps high on the drugs that the spaceship was puffing out because all of a sudden she turns into an action man, singlehandedly destroying the spaceship and then driving off the fight for a human resistance she just heard on the radio about mere seconds ago. Where has all this come from? Am I still watching the same film, the intense, engrossing chamber piece set in the bunker? \n\nI know a lot of people really dislike the ending, and I do too. But my beef isn’t the fact that they revealed that Goodman was right all along and there was an apocalypse, I like the fact that he was right all along, it was just the execution of how the reveal was handled that I was miffed with. There were so many different ways it could have been handled, from simply having her climb out of the bunker and then stare in shock at a crumbling world around her as the film fades to black, but all the jumping around throwing fire bombs at aliens and CGI giant worms was just came off as really poor and really undid the tension of the bulk of the film, especially since the movie chose to go down a route that you don’t see too much of in mainstream movies in that it’s entire foundation is atmosphere as opposed to spectacle, and yet we end up in the middle of a marvel movie at the end. \n\nStill, I suppose to enjoy the movie more we should focus on the journey and not the destination, and the time in the bunker is a fantastic exercise in suspense and tension. The protagonist has a complete distrust of Goodman’s character, who feeds her information that she has desire to believe. It’s a fantastically terrifying situation to be it, and Goodman was really good in the role. He plays it in such a way that you’re unable to decide whether he’s crazy or truthful.  I found myself intensely engrossed during the film’s highs and quite interested during the films lows – it doesn’t drag, doesn’t outstay its welcome. At precise moments where I thought that maybe this would have been better as a short movie because the premise is starting to get stale, a new plot development would emerge keeping me intrigued. \n\nIt was quite funny too. Some of it comes the characters trying to make most of the depraved situation they find themselves in, and at other times it completely ended any tension that had been built up by a scene. Whether you see this as a good thing or a bad thing is up to you, but it does seem the movie doesn’t just want to be grim and depressing and isn’t afraid to give you a laugh or two. And I have to say, after having my hands over my mouth in shock over a particular tense scene, the movie did very well to have me laughing my head off to Goodman shaking his big ass up and down to The Exciter’s Tell Him only seconds later. \n\nI think overall the film was very suspenseful, very engrossing. It’s telling that I only intended to watch the first few scenes when it was on the telly and leave the rest for a later date but ended up watching the whole thing in one go. But the ending really does drag it down, it really is exceptionally sloppy and disappointing after the wild rollercoaster ride that was the meat of the film. It’s a solid 7/10 had the ending been touched up. I’ll settle at a 6. \n",

        "text": "Okay, so...\n\nI'm a huge animation nut, and yet, I personally don't look forward to every feature animated film that comes out in the USA. There are only 2 films I genuinely want to see this year (2018). \n\nIt bothers me how the medium is so stagnant in this country as I have a love of the medium's craft, while also being capable of telling different stories.\n\nWhen looking at different countries, Japan will still have their Studio Ghibli accolades and all of Europe have their own extravagant animation scene, the latter only because they have a differnet economic model than the United States:\n\nhttps://www.cartoonbrew.com/feature-film/3-ways-europes-feature-animation-scene-differs-u-s-150081.html\n\nAll of them may not be great, but at least their unique, while also being quite accesible. \n\nFor example, I saw this film called _The Big Bad Fox and Other Tales_ a while ago, and I'm 100% sure that if this film was released in multiple theaters in the US, the general public would have liked it just fine. But I assume that distributors thought because it was an animated movie from France, it was some arthouse film that wouldn't appeal to may people (for those wondering what the film was like, just imagine those compilation films Warner Bros. used to make out of their Looney Tunes shorts).\n\nAnyway, I want to be able to create my own animation studio (or at the very least, distribution company for animation) in the future, and hopefully, help discourage the American people away from animation's terrible reputation.\n\nSo, in order to get some ideas, I wanted to ask:\n\n*__What do you want to see from animated films?__*\n\nor conversely,\n\n*__What will make you want to see a feature animated film that isn't from Disney or Pixar?__*\n\nCan be anything you think of: subjects, environments, ANYTHING!!",

        "text": "Every few months my attention span takes a holiday and I KNOW I'm not the only one that this happens to. It happens to a lot of us and for a variety of reasons. Could be anxiety. ADHD. Even stress. Mine is related to seasonal depression and it makes it nearly impossible for me to sit and enjoy a 40 minute television show, let alone a movie. Sometimes it lasts a week. Sometimes a month. Sometimes even longer. And I ALWAYS let it get in the way of watching and studying movies. I tried to engage in other hobbies during these times and it helped to some extent, but film was and is such a passion for me that I was having trouble turning my back on it for extended periods of time. This may sound silly to someone who has never struggled with it before, but I assure you that it's very real and not at all enjoyable.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nI knew deep down that if I put in a real effort and made some concessions to my expectations, I could over-come these lengthy movie-less voids that intermittently pop into my life. I made a guide for myself with some suggestions for when my attention span has waned into near non-existence and I'd like to share some of it with those of you who need it. Some of these suggestions are obvious, but I think having it written out has been constructive for me. I'd love to encourage anyone to propose additional content and/or tips for those struggling with a bout of poor focus.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nHere we go:\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n**Alternate Media**: Full length films can be difficult when you lack focus. Try some of these alternatives.\n\n  \n\n\n1.  Anime/Animation: There's a certain stigma against anime in some circles, but if you can stomach it then it's a great place to start. There's a lot of trash in the animation world, but among the garbage you'll find some truly incredible work. Not only that, but a lot of the shows have a brisk pace and a 20 minute length; perfect for a short attention span. Recommendations: Cowboy Bebop, Avatar: The Last Airbender, Batman: The Animated Series, Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood.\n2.  Short Films: An obvious suggestion, but I tend to forget that they exist a lot of the time. There is a tremendous pool of talent in short films and thousands upon thousands of them to watch. With run times every where from 30 seconds to lengthier shorts that pass the 20 minute mark, the arena of short film has a ton of flexibility that's suited perfectly for someone looking for a viewing tailored to their current focus level. Suggestions: Don Hertzfeldt's body of work, Vimeo, Pixar Shorts, Buster Keaton.\n3.  Music Videos: Music videos used to make me roll my eyes when I was younger. I thought they were all trashy marketing tools for sell-out bands. I mean, a lot of them still are trashy marketing tools, but there really are some truly talented film-makers in this field. They're short, sweet, and incredibly diverse. Give them a shot. Suggestions: Spike Jonze, Kendrick Lamar videos.\n4.  Interactive Story Type Video Games: These get a bad reputation in some circles and I don't necessarily disagree. Most of them are clunky and messy, with too many or too little mechanics. But quite honestly, there have been weeks where interactive story games have been the closest thing to a movie that I've been able to enjoy, and that's enough for me. Suggestions: What Remains of Edith Finch, The Wolf Among Us, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter.\n5.  Video Essays and Film Study Videos: Another obvious one. I don't watch a lot of video essays myself, but they're a fantastic medium if you can find someone you really connect with. Find someone you enjoy watching and take everything they say with a grain of salt. I won't recommend any essayists because I'm far from an expert on the topic, but you can find tons of suggestions on this subreddit. As for technical film study, YouTube is pretty rich with these videos. Do some research and find a channel you trust before dedicating time to learning their opinions on the intricacies of film.\n6.  Rewatching Old Films and TV Shows: Some people's attention spans can be so sensitive that lending their full attention to a television is almost impossible. And while I recommend giving your undivided focus to a film whenever you can, sometimes you just can't. This is a great oppurtunity to rewatch some of your favorites, dust off some of those movies you watched as a kid, and give those movies you weren't sure about another shot. You've already seen them, so there's not as much of a pressure to stay glued to the screen the whole time. It's a concession to be sure (we all want to pay as much attention to every frame as we can,) but it's better than neglecting one of your biggest passions entirely.\n7.  Analyze Specific Scenes: No one said that you always have to watch the full movie. Consider going back and studying particular scenes you find interesting. Rewatch them. Learn them inside and out. Dense movies are particularly fun for this.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n**This next section will outline some suggestions for watching a feature length film while struggling with an aggressively short attention span:**\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n1.  Plug your phone in across the room. I have a strict no phone rule whenever I'm watching a new film, but I tend to break it when I'm having a particularly rough time concentrating. It's childish, but it's really only a temptation during those few hellish focus-less weeks of the year. To combat this, I plug my phone into my game console on the other side of the room. Threat neutralized.\n2.  Turn the lights off and cover other flashing lights on your house. These lights can kill immersion and make it even harder to pay attention.\n3.  Get something to fidget with. If you're like me, your hands are busy. I always need something to touch. Holding a stress ball or something as simple as a pen while watching a film can go a long way for someone with restless hands.\n4.  Turn up the volume. Again, immersion. Get lost in your film.\n5.  Wear headphones. This isn't a suggestion for everyone, but Sometimes I find that it helps me dedicate myself to a film if I wear headphones to watch it.\n\n  \n\n\nI hope this helps at least one person. I know it has helped me immensely to have a physical record of recommendations to check when my brain isn't playing ball. Sometimes we forget alternatives exist all together.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nTake care, fellow movie-lovers.\n\n  \n",

It has its roots in your identity, satisfying the  nature of your being that is curiosity. But you exercise it at the  expense of going against the values you hold dear—hence the accumulation  of guilt in your psyche, the burden of which is too strong to get rid  of. Is pursuing curiosity worth sacrificing your values?\n\nThat is the primary conflict of our protagonist Harry Caul (Gene Hackman) in Francis Coppola’s *The Conversation*.  He works in the surveillance business and only cares about a “nice fat  recording.” The opening sequence slowly indulges us in his craft. With  the help of his crew, he tries to record the conversation of a pair who  appear to be having an affair. The movie withholds the details of this  successful mission and only gives us enough information to be engaged.\n\n He lives alone in an apartment and finds solace in playing the  saxophone. Being secretive about his life and work methods, he doesn’t  like to be asked personal and professional questions. This leads to  conflicts with his girlfriend, Amy (Teri Garr), and his assistant, Stan  (John Cazale). When he visits Amy, we see how little she knows about him  and her attempts to glean information are confronted by elusive  behavior. To top it off, she reveals how paranoid he is. For instance,  once she saw him lurking outside for an hour to see if she’s cheating or  his predatory way of opening the door.  “Where do you work Harry?” she  asks. He responds, “Different places, different jobs. You see I’m kind  of a musician.” Why does he say “musician”? He could have mentioned any  other job, which makes me think it’s not merely a lie. It might tell us  his dream was to be a musician and be identified as one. He is a  Christian, and in a church scene we see him regretful of his past.  Again, the film only gives us enough information to tickle our  curiosity. \n\n Harry goes to the corporation to deliver the tapes and pictures  contained in a blue folder to the director. It turns out the director is  not there, and Harry refuses to give it to his assistant, ending up  with a threat that nudges his curiosity. So he tries to explore the  findings to see if he can decipher what is it all about. He starts with  the tape, listening to the conversation of the pair. He keeps playing  and rewinding the tape, the camera keeps cutting to the conversation,  recording device and a mid-close-up of Harry’s face. His facial  expression is akin to mine as I am also trying to find a clue from this,  apparently, ordinary conversation. Nothing seems to indicate to  anything worthwhile until the record reaches an unrecognizable beat.  This is where we get frustrated as it looks like a vital piece of the  conversation. Finally, he manages to hear what they say by pulling off a  trick. “He’d kill us if he got the chance.” The camera captures a  close-up of Harry’s face to show the importance of this revelation. As  we get closer to the revelation, shots are cut faster to convey the  urgency. And finally, once it hits, we get a shot of Harry’s face that  lingers for a few seconds, inducing the emotional state;  impeccable  performance and editing. \n\n Harry is a pre-eminent figure in his field, and we see this emphasized  in the surveillance convention scene, where everyone wants to interact  with him. Among his admirers, there is an ambitious and insecure guy  named Bernie Moran (Allen Garfield) who pesters him in an attempt to  prove his capability. Harry invites Stan, Moran and a crowd to his  office located in a warehouse. Moran happens to know about Harry’s past  and reveals how his genius in bugging a bug-proof boat led to a  horrifying incident involving the death of a family. So now we know why  he is tormented by his past. Harry tries to justify the whole story by  saying he is not responsible for the repercussions of a mission. But the  subtext says otherwise; looking shameful and gnawed, we could clearly  see how he was running away from the daunting truth by distancing  himself from Moran. Now Moran has the upper hand. \n\n This perfectly composed and edited sequence continues as Stan responds  to Moran’s longing to prove himself. Stan fills him in on Harry’s latest  mission, asking him to figure out the method. Anxious and tenacious,  Moran keeps throwing ideas only to be rejected by facts, until Harry,  who was dismayed by the earlier revelation, interjects proudly to  explain it all. Now he is at the helm and what is more satisfying than  witnessing the defeat of an arrogant moron? Excellent! But not so fast,  this brief moment of joy turns into a lasting humiliation when Moran  plays a tape of an intimate conversation between Harry and a hooker in  an earlier scene. Turns out the pen he gave to Harry in the convention  had a recording device built in. Not so moron, right? This sequence is  not only a manifestation of exposition done well—it answers our  questions about the mission and Harry’s past through a few dramatized  scenes—but also a classic example of how to create tension by power  dynamics. \n\n Embarrassed and chagrined, Harry couldn’t handle the pressure and made  them leave. Now he is alone with the hooker, who was trying to seduce  him all night, and it worked. Him laying on the bed is juxtaposed with  the conversation playing in the background, which might imply Harry’s  own past. \n\nHarry wakes up to another predicament; the tapes are stolen by the  hooker. He immediately calls the corporation and turns out they had  orchestrated the robbery because they were afraid of him destroying the  tapes. Having delivered the rest of the documents, he’s faced with  another conflict: to let go or keep pursuing the story. He goes with the  latter by locating the hotel and renting a room adjacent to room 773;  where the supposed murder is going to happen.\n\nHe manages to find a spot in the room for eavesdropping. His  equipment is in a blue suitcase, from which he picks up a driller and  makes a hole. He listens to the conversation, and then the tape is  played. As the tape keeps playing the camera zooms in on Harry, tension  accumulates as guilt assails his mind. Murder is about to occur. Too  weak to interfere, Harry is overwrought and does nothing but crawling  into a blanket, trying to hide away from another devastating guilt. The  dust has settled; he sneaks into the room to see what happened.   Searching for traces of blood leads to nowhere. Scene stretches and  curiosity lingers, finally, he opens up the toilet. Blood soars and  overflows as loud terrifying music crescendos and blasts our ears,  maximizing the effect of the scene. Throughout the movie,  soundtracks—composed by David Shire—are mostly comprised of soft  melodies with mysterious undertones that we get accustomed to. So the  economic use of different tracks in specific scenes like this magnifies  the effect.\n\n Now we, just like Harry, are under the impression the director has  caught the cheating pair and murdered them. So Harry, traumatized and  angry, goes to the corporation to confront the director, but the guards  stop him. Outside, he sees the wife alive in a blue car. This doesn’t  align with our perception of the story. Then Harry reads in the  newspaper that the director has been killed in a car accident. So it was  the other way around, the pair plotting the murder of the director with  his assistant on board. Surrounded by reporters, the pair and the  assistant rush out of the corporation. Harry catches their attention,  their eyes glitter with surprise and apprehension. Nothing is being  spoken and the eyes tell us all we have to know. \n\n The main plot is wrapped up. Harry is sitting there in peace playing his  saxophone. Then the assistant calls to threaten him. Concerned about  being bugged, he diligently embarks on a destructive journey to find the  bug. He tears down his place but to no avail. While doing so, he—a guy  who gets irritated by “Jesus Christ” being said in vain—is confronted  with a dilemma. He can either break the Virgin Mary statue or remain  faithful to his values. He goes with the former, showing that he still  prefers to go against his principles and is only driven by curiosity.  The film ends with Harry sitting in the ruins playing saxophone; his  only peaceful moment. \n\n Watching *The Conversation* reminded me of Alfred Hitchcock’s endearing *Rear Window*.  Throughout both movies, I was in the mind of our protagonist beat by  beat, scene by scene, scrutinizing every move to solve the current  conflict and predict the next. *The Conversation* is not as well-known as Francis Ford Coppola’s *The Godfather* trilogy or *Apocalypse Now*, but it rivals them in allure.

But there is still something about it's plot that I don't quite understand and that is, who hired Ida Sessions to impersonate Mrs. Mulwray? \n\nI suppose most viewers (myself included) assume it must’ve been Noah Cross and/or his associates in land scheme. But what's his angle there? Why would Cross want to get an investigator involved in this, especially if he already knew that Mulwray had to be killed because he was standing in way of their land scheme? Or did Cross kill him not because of land scheme but because of dispute about Kathrine? But even so, what was he trying to achieve by hiring Gittes through Ida Sessions? Or was it someone else who hired Ida Sessions to impersonate Mrs. Mulwray? \n\nI suppose one could also just say that maybe it's one of those noir mysteries like in Big Sleep where everyone is lost in the complex plot, but given that this is inciting incident of the film and how meticulously constructed Chinatown is, I just feel that there probably is logical answer to this question.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/97ajbl/bo_burnhams_metamodern_magnum_opus_eighth_grade/",
        "text": "Eighth Grade\n\nEighth Grade 2: Ninth Grade\n\nEighth Grad3: Civil War\n\nEighth Four\n\nEighth Grade 5: Ninth Grade 2\n\nEighth 6rade: Return to Sixth Grade\n\nSeventh Grade\n\nF8 of the Grade\n\n\nThis is a coming of age haven. From Edge of Seventeen, to Call me by your Name, to Perks of being a Wallflower, and now Eighth Grade, we are now post-post John Hughes; we have moved beyond copycats and mere imitations into a land of pure imagination. Written and directed by stand up superstar Bo Burnham, Eighth Grade’s screenplay focuses on dynamics and relationships in a way unlike many other coming of age stories, while avoiding possible pitfalls of perspective differences - a 30 year old man writing a teenage girl? - through engaging realistic and legitimate dialogue.\n\n.\n\nThe first dynamic I’d like to examine is the relationship between Kayla and her fellow students. No matter what, Kayla is just trying to make friends. She’s legitimate and wholesome, and quirky in a way that would make Little Miss Sunshine smile.There’s something special about someone constantly trying to form connections with people. It would have been easy for this film to have relied too heavily on the “cringe” moments of Kayla’s socializing situations, to have the audience point and laugh at her floundering, to have her anxieties be nothing more than a punchline, but it doesn’t. The film uses cringe to its advantage - to create empathy. The awkwardness and cringe of these kids is wholly endearing and never condescending. It reminds me of the section in Infinite Jest where Barry Loach dresses up as a homeless person and doesn’t ask for money, but rather for a touch. Human connection. Days, weeks, and months go by without a single person willing to touch him. Eventually the mentally disabled Mario Incandenza gives him a hug. It’s pure wholesome humanity coming from the most unlikely source. That’s Kayla, she’s surrounded by social media, she has no friends, she’s bullied, and she’s almost sexually assaulted - but all the while she expresses nothing less than legitimacy and a wanting to connect. \n\n.\n\nThe second dynamic is between Kayla and her dad. This is a tender dynamic, wrought with angst and isolation, but overflowing with a mutual longing for compassion. It has the possibility to be a cliche and melodramatic relationship that is nothing more than the writer venting about their childhood, but fortunately Eighth Grade presents us with a relationship that has its ups and downs. Throughout most of the film, Kayla’s annoyance with her dad is clearly shown, and while relatable, it brought nothing new to the emotional table. But when Kayla reaches her Dark Night of the Soul, and finally breaks down in front of her father, there is an emotional vulnerability that so many film relationships lack. But it’s not just the mere fact that Kayla cries with her dad that makes this relationship so special - it’s the palpable chemistry between them, the oftentimes justified agitation in their conversations, and the perfect release of tension when she finally opens up to him. These are two people trying to reach out to each other, but they just can’t connect. It’s tragic. \n\n.\n\n\nThe last relationship is the relationship between Burnham and Kayla. Burnham is a 30 year old straight white male writing a character who is a teenage girl growing up in a noticeably different environment than he. This sounds like a familiar disaster… [Danish girl] But it’s not. Burnham’s distance from his subject matter works in his favor magnificently - [the film] [we’re] [isn’t] [not] just [imitating] [experiencing] someone else’s nostalgia. I think that was a massive barrier to my enjoyment of Lady Bird - a film about a girl going to an all girls catholic school in early 2000’s Sacramento, written by a girl who went to an all girls catholic school in early 2000’s Sacramento. That film drowns in nostalgia. The problem with nostalgia is this - my nostalgia is not your nostalgia. You ooing and awing over the specific brand and design of cereal you ate when you were eight isn’t engaging in the least. Eighth Grade escapes this conundrum by examining specific situations to the contemporary world, while drawing upon characters and emotions that are perennial. The distance between writer and subject forces Burnham to actually create a character, instead of vomiting up an author insert. He’s not just empathizing with a version of himself - he’s forging this fresh ball of empathizable humanity. \n\n.\n\n\nI’d also like to address the possible generational abstraction that people I’ve talked to are weary about. The friend I saw the film with said that she was relieved that she’s not apart of that generation, but the truth is that it really doesn’t matter. It’s still the same people, the same emotions, and the same shit year after year. It doesn’t matter if it’s over myspace, facebook, snapchat, or face to face, no matter what what happened in eighth grade has been and forever will be. These conflicts and struggles transcend social media and technology itself - they’re purely human. \nThe dialogue of this film has been widely praised as having some of the most true to life teenage dialogue ever put to screen. The kids in the film has a limited vocabulary, say um and ah, they repeat themselves, they don’t speak in neat little clever quips, and a lot of the time they just sound really dumb. [GUCCI] Which brings up the question: is realistic dialogue always more authentic? And more simply: Is it always better? The answer to the latter should be obvious: NO. The answer to the former is a bit more complicated. I think this should go without saying, but the point of dialogue isn’t to imitate reality, it’s purpose isn’t to be real - it’s to tell a story. It wouldn’t be completed, as an audience member, to record 90 minutes of you hanging out with your friends. Yes, this film has characters who speak like their real life counterparts, but it’s all in service to delivering a story and empathy in a way that’s convincing. The entire point of realistic dialogue is to trick you into thinking that you’re watching real people and real emotions. It’s a ruse! Some writers, such as Noah Baumbach, are much better at disguising this ruse as realism, but others, Sorkin comes to mind, revel in the metaphorical middle finger they give to quote unquote “real dialogue.” And they both work! People merely pointing out that “HEY DEEZ KIDS TALK LIKE REAL KIDZ!!!!! GOOD MOVIE!” is reductionist and idiotic. It’s the same with performances, pointing out the fact that Kayla’s a young person with acne doesn't automatically make her performance emotionally impactful. This thread of conversation eventually boils down to one question: is there a difference between authenticity and realism? Yes. \n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n\nIn doing research for an upcoming analysis, I came upon the term “remodernism.” Based on my lengthy discussion of metamodernism in my La La Land video, I was intrigued to say the least. Unfortunately, I didn’t feel the topic of remodernism was appropriate for that video - the film itself wasn’t remodern, postmodern, metamodern, or any other collection of erns and isms. So here we are. Remodernism was launched in 2000 by the Stuckism art group as a substitute for Postmodernism. It is the self described antidote to the spiritual bankruptcy of postmodernism, the rebirth of emotionally legitimate art, and says that the soul of art is integrity. So what exactly is remodernism? What differentiates it from similar movements such as metamodernism and New Sincerity? And what does Bo Burnham have to do with any of it?\n\n.\n\n\n\nI’ve already discussed modernism, postmodernism, and metamodernism at great length in my La La Land analysis, so if you’d like a deeper understanding, please go watch that video after watching this one. Works such as Kurt Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse Five and Samuel Beckett’s Waiting for Godot focus all of their attention on dismantling authority and accepted truths through deconstruction, irony, intertextuality, pastiche, metafiction, the rejection of metanarratives, and other postmodern rhetorical strategies. Waiting for Godot was intent on ironically mocking the nothingness of everyday life as well as other “serious plays” while never transcending the very thing it’s trying to make fun of. The only thing separating the nothingness and lack of meaning in Waiting for Godot and any number of other “serious plays” its attempting to lampoon is that Waiting for Godot tells the audience it’s not being serious - that it doesn’t have meaning. Vonnegut is a postmodern writer in the sense that he uses an ironic combination of genres and styles, it’s playful irreverence toward the fourth wall, experimentation with structure - specifically the nonlinearity of Slaughterhouse Five - as well as the novel’s skepticism toward grand narratives such as morality and time. Waiting for Godot is the embodiment of a postmodern play with its self-deprecating ironic attitude in order to make the viewer feel smarter than the naive public, and its use of infinitely receding irony in order to subvert utopian ideals. Estrogen and Vladmir’s never ending exploints go on without feeling or sincerity. These works are neat to read with all their crazy antics, but they all ultimately end in nihilism. Nothing learned. Nothing sincere. \nI don’t hate postmodernism, I’m not on a personal crusade against existentialist philosophy - rather I’m interested in asking the question, “Where do we go from here?”  Identifying the hypocrisy in authority, exploring the division between language and experience is fascinating, but where does it leave us? What do we do with this information (or lack thereof)? The core problem with postmodern thought is that there isn’t much rebuilding after tearing down structure, authority, and legitimacy. The reader is left jaded and cynical. Every single person consuming literature experiences the ramifications of Postmodernism’s isolation - it’s not specific to people working dead end jobs or in an emotional rut. Postmodernism’s effects manifest themselves as a societal lens - people view everything around them in an ironic, skeptical, and relativist sense. \n\n.\n\n\nPostmodern irony deconstructs, but offers no answers. The reality is that irony keeps reality at a distance. It has become our primary tool for dealing with our frustrations and desires. This societal and cultural reliance on irony to deal with our issues leads to lazy cynicism replacing conviction, as well as a sense of severe loneliness and isolation. On a literature level, fiction soon becomes nothing more than books mocking plays that mock life - everything pointing out the hypocricacies and lack of true meaning in everything else. Much of postmodern and existentialist literature sets out to reveal that because of the failures of language - because of the disconnect between thoughts and language - a text - or even life itself - has no meaning. Postmodern literature’s deconstruction of meaning, its emphasis on relativism, and its ironic sneering at sentimentality leads the reader down a road of cynicism and detachment. Postmodern thought convicts every single person for the ultimate postmodern crime: being naive in the face of irony. \n\n.\n\n\nRemodernism is a movement born from British painters Billy Childish and Charles Thomson. They wrote the “Remodern Manifesto,” which says - pretty much - that Remodernism takes the original principles of Modernism and reapplies them. Remodernism not only rejects postmodernism, but discards it entirely; remodernism doesn’t believe that modernism reached its full potential, therefore postmodernism is pointless because how could you be post-something-that-hasn’t-even-”been.” It seeks a new spirituality in art. Spiritual film doesn't mean films about Jesus or Buddha - spiritual film is not about religion. It is cinema concerned with humanity and an understanding of simple truths, and moments of legitimacy with a focus on intuition. Remodernist film is for the young, and for those who are older but still have the courage to look at the world through eyes as if they are children…. Which sounds nice. But where is remodernism? When I pressed Charles Thomson, a co-creator of the movement, for bona fide examples of remodernism, I got this. [imgur.com/gallery/sZ9jOJa] Maybe I just don’t get art - art as in painting - maybe I just don’t get it, but I don’t think you’re supposed to have to get art. It should be somewhat instinctual. There should be an innate reaction. I don’t need to write an essay about a film to enjoy it, I don’t need to scour academic papers for primary sources in order to quote unquote “GET” a film. It’s emotional effect has little to do with my knowledge of how the film was made. It can be explained why something had the effect that it did, or why it was emotionally impactful, but that necessitates it be emotionally effective in the first place. Merely saying that this piece of art is remodern doesn’t make it any more or less engaging. Anywho, with similar movements, such as metamodernism, we have concrete examples - Infinite Jest, Little Miss Sunshine, Moonrise Kingdom, and even La La Land - its manifesto is coherent and more than a rambling list, and it’s a movement that’s well known. Nobody’s going to be making remodernist films because nobody knows about remodernism. This may be a bit turgid, and my mere use of the word turgid may be turgid in and of itself, but a google search for metamodernism yields roughly 67,000 results, while a search for remodernism yields 14,200 results. Right now, we’re seeing the birth of dozens of post-postmodern movements - trans-postmodernism, post-millennialism, the ever more pertinent digimodernism, remodernism, and of course metamodernism - we’re seeing all of these movements in their infancy, and only the most popular survive, and right now, metamodernism is the alpha. Should we reject the postmodern entirely? Should we abandon what we’ve learned about the separation of meaning and language through deconstruction? Should we simply not be skeptical of organized religion or any other overreaching ideology? Should we ignore the writings of Vonnegut, Beckett, and Heller? Should we discard the last 60 years of philosophical thinking? Should we simply forget postmodernism? And more importantly, can we? \n\n.\n\n\nTo respond to Postmodernism, we don’t need to revert back to the grand narratives of modernism - rather, to feel less lonely we just need to get along. We need to start valuing other people and their perspectives, and we need to place worth on community. We need to start enjoying the things we love without fear of embarrassment or ironic ridicule. As David Foster Wallace said, we need to make it okay to be “unavoidably sentimental and naive and goo prone and generally pathetic.” Postmodernism asks, “Does anyone have the answers?” The answer is no. Metamodernism responds, “How do we handle that information?” The “meta” in Metamodernism comes from Plato’s metaxy. Metaxy was first used in Symposium to describe an inbetween or oscillation - something simultaneously between and beyond opposed poles. Meta also had a different connotation which meant across, with, and beyond (which I feel may be more appropriate.) Because the effects of postmodernism cannot be undone, Metamodernism calls for a return to legitimacy while retaining our postmodern intellect. We can be skeptical while being legitimate. Metamodernism knows we can never truly return to legitimacy, so it oscillates between modernism and postmodernism, it operates in a space between naivety and skepticism. Metamodernism sets out to rediscover the human connection that was severed by postmodernism - establishing a relationship by recognising that the reader exists while still fulfilling the emotional needs of the audience. It’s an era where faith, trust, dialogue, performance, and sincerity can work to transcend jadded irony and rekindle legitimacy. Metamodern art can depict a world as dark and twisted as it wants, but it finds a way to illuminate the magic of being alive and human in it. Metamodern cinema is comfortable discussing humanity without resorting to cynicism, relativism, or irony - and it does everything in its power to not end in isolation. David Foster Wallace once called for art that redeems rather than ridicules - metamodernism fulfills his wish. Metamodernism strives for the genuine, embraces the sentimental, and shelters the hopeful from the reign of postmodern cynicism and irony.\n\n.\n\n\nBo Burnham - finally we’re tying everything together - Bo Burnham’s comedy can be seen as mirroring the philosophical and artistic shift from the postmodern to metamodern. His first special, “Words Words Words,” is pinnacle postmodern - it’s soaked in verbal irony while playfully intertextual and reflexive. It reverses the audience’s expectations of what a stand up special should be. I mean for god’s sake what’s more postmodern than a song literally entitled “Art is Dead” which chronicles late stage capitalism’s stranglehold on creativity. \n\n.\n\n\nHis next special, “what,” is the awkward middle child, and probably my favorite. Songs like “Repeat Stuff” shine a cold, unflinching, and just plain mean light on the vices of the music industry. And “sad” just lists a bunch of sad stuff and everyone laughs! The whole point of the song is lampooning the melodramatic and sentimental. While these are no doubt hilarious songs, they’re prime examples of postmodern irony run amuck. But on the other side of the proverbial coin, is his poem, “I Fuck Sluts,” which chronicles some most unwholesome sexual exploits, while documenting a troubled, misanthropic, emotionally apathetic man attempt to form actual human relationships, but failing miserably. It’s a strange tale, told in an artistically idiosyncratic way. When he turns that page, and utters the next line, the audience turns to stone. There’s palpable tension - this isn’t just a funny thing where he says the word “slut” a lot, it’s a poem with heart. The more I hear this poem, the less I laugh and the more I hear the voice of a poor poor man who needs help, a man who is lashing out with sexist language because he’s utterly alone. And “We Think We Know You.” Christ alive, this song gives me chills every time I hear it. He sets it up as almost a pity party for himself, all these selfish people only wanting to connect to Bo for their own person gain. Then the reveal, when the voices sync up and spell the title of the song. The audience goes quiet. Then the most divine moment in the special - that piano kicks in. Instantly reversing the melodramatic pity party into a ravishing piece of music. He’s not afraid to fail, he’s being unapologetically legitimate and vulnerable and sincere; he’s pouring his soul into a song that’s brimming with heart. THAT’S metamodernism! Taking these powerfully destructive means, and transforming them into sincere art, culminating in the most potent moment of pure jaw-dropping awesomeness ever put to the stage. \n\n.\n\n\nHis last special, “Make Happy,” is the continuation of “We think we know You” from “what.” When I rewatched this special for this essay, I got a bit nervous - the first half is, as usual, full of ironic detachment and cynicism without a heart. Had I been mistaken? Is Burnham just as postmodern as the rest, is this merely a return to the postmodern form? Abandoning what he’d learned from “we think we know you?” But then came the song, “If you want Love.” It starts out with the habitual satirization of the contemporary world, in this case it’s people’s expectations of the perfect lover. But then something special happens -  [We want perfect children, a perfect life A perfect husband or a perfect wife But deep down we know, we don't deserve it]. There’s an inkling of heart, a crack in the ironic armor. The song continues and rips the chink into a crack and eventually that sincerity becomes the song. It’s legitimate and vulnerable and beautiful. The song ends on an ironic button, a joke about naivete. It’s this oscillation that is central to metamodernism - the oscillation between the postmodern and the modern, the ironic and the legitimate, the cynical and the sincere. Much like his other songs, the finale starts out parodying a trend in popular culture, this time it’s Kyane West. But there’s a special twist. Even at the start of the song, it’s more than just ironic pastiche. In Think Big Animation’s video on Burnham, he posits that the oft-repeated line [I wouldn’t have gotten half of this shit if I knew it wasn’t going to fit in the burrito], that that line is a metaphor for his comedy career. He says that right now, Burnham has it all - three comedy specials, sold out theatres, and a feature film - but right when his life seems to be coming together, everything starts spilling out of the metaphorical burrito. Burnham says that someone should have warned him - he wouldn’t have gotten into this if he knew it was going to turn out like this. The connections to Burnham’s mental health become crystal clear when you know that while touring “what” he began to have panic attacks before shows. Then the ironic detachment melts away into unflinching honesty once he “breaks it down.” [Like, \"come and watch the Skinny kid with a steadily declining mental health And laugh as he attempts To give you what he cannot give himself] It’s this sincere candor that’s presented in an ironic wrapping which makes Burnham’s comedy so special. It’s heartbreakingly hilarious. Just like “If you want Love,” this song ends with an unconventional button, but where “Love”’s button was a reversal from legitimacy to irony, the finale’s button is simply a continuation of sincerity. [I hope you’re happy.] The line could be taken at face value, Burnham simply wishing the audience that they got what they came for and that they’re happy. On the other hand, it could be taken as “I hope you’re happy, because I’m not.” [I hope you’re happy] \n\n.\n\n\nThe genuine sincerity carries over from Burnham’s stand up to his feature film debut, depicting eighth graders who are immersed in an atmosphere of social media, while never coming off as judgmental or condemnatory. \n\n.\n\n\nIt’s textbook metamodernism! The film is concerned with humanity first and foremost - while there is an emphasis on social media, the brunt of the effect of this film comes from the humanity and sincerity of these characters. It values these kids as human beings. Sinority is bull shit - the mere fact that someone’s in 8th grade does not reflect positively or negatively on their character in the lest. That’s what I love about this film, even though it is a coming of age story, even though it does focus on adolescence, it is more so than anything concerned with the humanity of these characters in a wholly legitimate light. It says to the audience, “You can laugh, you can cry, you can cringe all you want, and that’s okay.” But with that legitimacy and naivete comes irony and cynicism. Most, if not all, of Kayla’s classmates are despicable, her teachers are the manifestation of the “fellow kids” meme, she lives in a broken home, she probably has anxiety, and she’s alone. It’s this balance, this oscillation, is the meta in metamodern. The film operates in a space between naivety and skepticism. It depicts a social media dystopia with a spark of sincerity. It’s comfortable discussing issues of social media, the tribulations of adolescence, a lack of friendship, and a broken family without resorting to cynicism, relativism, or irony - and it does everything in its power to not end in isolation. This film speaks in the language of postmodernism - irony, pastiche, intertextuality, and metafiction - but what is being said is sincere and rich in affect. Eighth Grade embraces the cringe that is more or less inevitable, while still striving for something genuine and meaningful. Hope and naivete are not something to distrust, love is not something to be ridiculed, and legitimacy is not something to be feared.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\nIt retains genuine wholesomeness while tackling topics that could easily have turned into a collective “Hey aren’t kids horrible these days?” This film shows that they’re not - they’re just kids, they’re human, and anxious, and scared. It examines social media’s effect on culture, the struggles of social anxiety, and the precipice of adolescence through a lens of personal introspection. The oscillation that’s paramount to metamodernism is present between his stand up shows themselves, between individual songs within the specials, and even inside the songs themselves - effortlessly fluctuating between the ironic cynicism and detachment that audiences have come to expect, and pure, sincere honesty. \n\n\n\n------------\n\n\nedit: fixed formatting errors\n",

        "text": "*tl;dr at the end*\n\n First of all I want to clarify it, I didn't mean movies that was made in USA by \"american\". What I mean by it is movies that show american geography, architecture and culture. There are famous directors and waves for different cultures; If I want to watch something \"French\" there is whole french new wave, someting \"eastern european\" there is Kieslowski, something \"indian\" there is Apu trilogy, something \"japanese\" ... well shall I start to count all of them? \n\nWhen it comes to american directors they are overshadowed by Holywood most of the time. Ofcourse there are Lynch, Tarantino and some other well known directors but as you can guess I'm not looking for something like their works. It could be because of my ignorance but when I try to think about \"american\" movies I can't name much.\n\nWhat I search for is something like \"Paris,Texas\" , I know its director is german but the movie is the most \"american\" movie I have ever seen. I love the scene where boy and the father have a long car ride on night, it is a wonderful scene with endless roads, vast spaces and some neon lit restaurants. Also the movie is full of wonderful desert shots which fits what I call \"american\" well.\n\n*tl;dr* I search something like \"Paris,Texas\" or Cohen Brothers' movies(Fargo, No Country for Old Men, Inside Lywn Davis etc.) or similar directors.
