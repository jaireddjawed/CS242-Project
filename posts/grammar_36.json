As examples, I see emails from Brits using semicolons before a long quotation, or * before * a list of things.\n\n We've all seen people using semicolons instead of commas etc, and other random abuse of punctuation/grammar, but this specific type of misuse appears to be regional. I believe I've seen semicolons used similarly in Chaucer, etc. Does anyone know of an historical change in the use of semicolons/punctuation that could account for this?\n \nCan anyone think of more recent examples in literature? I feel like I've seen it in translations of Jules Verne, for instance, although I don't have a copy to hand.",

Whereas in the second sentence, it can be understood that everyone knows that they themselves (plural) have duties.  It can also mean that everyone knows that \"he\" has duties (by using the singular they).  That example shows the ambiguity of the meaning that results from using the singular they.  \n\nFor my assignment, I am tasked with using the singular they in lieu of gender pronouns.  With this issue in mind (assuming the sentence structure remains the same) how can I avoid having ambiguity in the meaning?",

But, that just sounds incorrect.\n\nI have debated this with friends, but would like a definitive answer.  \n\n**Possible choices:**\n\n1. Fruit by the Foots\n2. Fruit by the Feet\n3. Fruits by the Foot\n4. Fruit by the Foot (no plural form)\n\nThank you.",

Identify the verb category: be, linking, intransitive, or transitive. \n\n\nExample: \nThe Lincoln penny / first / appeared / in 1909. \nVerb: intransitive \n\n\nHere are my notes on Pattern 4 – The Intransative Verb Pattern \nIn the intransitive pattern, the predicate has only one requirement: the verb alone. \nAs you know, such skeletal sentences are fairly rare in actual writing. The point here is that they are grammatical: No complements are required. Adding a modifier does not change the basic pattern. The following variations of our samples remain Pattern 4 sentences: \n\n Cameras flashed in his face. \n\n Accidents happen quickly.  \n\nOther common intransitive verbs are change, laugh, live, meet, occur, smile, wait—and literally thousands more.

Then, just moments ago, I encountered this sentence in Pride and Prejudice (a 18th century British novel).\n\n&gt; He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while. \n\nhttps://www.shmoop.com/pride-and-prejudice/chapter-16-full-text-6.html\n\nApparently, it is \"he(subject) + thinks + it (object) + worth (adjective)\". So, I did some Google search. I do not know how to search for sentences by part of speech (i.e., \"adjective\"), so I just searched for the exact phrase \"thinks it worth\". There were quite a lot of matches in Google Books but most of them were from 1800's or early 1900's. There were one or two results from 2000's, but when I clicked them, they seemed to be quoting old books.\n\nSo, if I got it right, that form of usage of \"think\" was correct in the past and now is incorrect? Or is it sort of \"not exactly grammatically wrong but no one says like that anymore\", like \"Is it she?\"\n",
