I see in the example for instance that q1 has been reduced to ae*d but why this in particular? Why  couldn't it be ae*bcd? I don't see any reason for getting ae*d apart from going to the middle state and returning to the state or is that what you are meant to do? I guess I am struggling to understand how people go about converting these things. I do not see any set process for doing it. \n\nAlso, how is the regular expression itself constructed? I get that ae*d is a closure and can be done multiple times, I get that ae*b \nis a concatenation however the part after is where it gets hazy for me. \n\n",

The example is as follows:\n\nThere are two networks– the institutional network and the rest of the public Internet. The origin servers are attached to the Internet but are located all over the globe. Suppose that the average object size is 1Mbits and that the average request rate from the institution's browsers to the origin servers is 15 requests per second. Suppose that the HTTP request messages are negligibly small and thus create no traffic in the networks or in the access link (from institutional router to Internet router). Also suppose that the amount of time it takes from when the router on the internet side of the access link forwards an HTTP request until it receives the response is two seconds on average. \n\nA Web Cache is installed in the institutional network. The cache provides a hit rate of .4 for this installation. The textbook then says that the traffic intensity on the access link is .6 (which I understand). However, it then says that \"average delay therefore is (.4 * .01 seconds) + (.6 * 2.01 seconds) = 1.2 seconds\"\n\nAnybody understand where the .01 seconds and the 2.01 seconds come from???\n\nHere's pictures of the textbook if my blurb wasn't detailed enough:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/2Y8uO\nhttps://imgur.com/a/8MXCd\n\n \n\n\n",

        "text": "Hi, I'm a Junior so maybe this is still a bit farsighted. However, knowing the only reason I may not attend my dream school is due to lack of preparedness and knowing just how important those two years were (9th and 10th) I have been very curious and interested in making sure as I go to college I will know what I need to do and be able to prepare to make college as great as an experience for me as possible and be able to set myself up with a decent, well-paying job when I get out.\n\n(Disclaimer: I love computer science and programming I'm not just going in for the money, but I do respect the amount people in this field can make)\n\nSo let's get the obvious typical statement out of the way: I want to work at a big-time company within 5-10 years of graduating from college, I'm pretty sure like everyone does lol. Intel, NVIDIA, Google, NASA, Boeing; you get the gist!(No social media, this may be an unpopular opinion but I don't see how investing your career into something like social media is a very smart idea doesn't seem like that'd be a great place for job security) In college what are the best practices and habits I can make to get into industry out of college and into this big business as quickly as I can?\n\nNow I know a few already and they're already being thought about, but if you'd like to add more information about these particular subjects I'd love that just as much as any new tips. Here's what I know so far:\n\n- Network Network Network, get to know people attend tech conferences and presentation\n\n- Somewhat the same but; Get internships in relevant work experience, thankfully one of my top 3 school preferences is within 15 miles of Y12 in Oak Ridge Tennessee and they frequently pick up interns from the school out of major like computer science. So maybe I can get one of those pretty easily!\n\n- Get good grades but don't make it such a burden that you don't get to do anything else to prepare yourself for a career\n\n- Create things!\n\nHere's my plan (you'll all probably laugh at how optimistic this is):\nI know for sure I'm either doing Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, or Computer Science. But even if I do electrical I'll pick up a CS minor so no matter what I'm for sure gonna get some sort of CS education because I just love this field and want to expand my knowledge. There's a bunch of places I'd be interested in internships at that I'm going to try and prepare myself to possibly get an internship at. The obvious: Google, NASA, SpaceX etc that almost everyone probably applies to and the not so obvious like Y12 that I spoke about before. I'm sure I'll learn a lot more about internships as I get closer to college and actually in college. I know I want to try something, take some sort of risk with a business; sure this sounds stupid but I love trying things if an idea comes to me or my friends at the right time in college and we have the resources available to try to start something new I'm going to do it. I want to attend hackathons starting this summer, obviously not so many that it'll take away from my schooling but enough to get out there and know people and maybe create a thing or two. \n\nOverall I want to work closer to the hardware. I'm not really a front end kind of guy design isn't as interesting to me as the theory and logic behind everything. I'm a huge computer guy that's why tech companies like Intel, NVIDIA, AMD, etc appeals to me. I know the reality is probably more than 70-90% of the people who get a computer science degree won't get to go into a company like this but I still want to do everything I can to try. I'm coming to the end of high school and the only thing I regret thus far in life is not trying hard enough at the things I love.\n\nEdit: I've already (somewhat) started building a little portfolio. I'm currently working on website development for a local and small nonprofit. It's not entirely programming related but I hope to eventually over this summer once I get a break overhaul the website with my own custom CSS and javascript instead of  running off WordPress and a little CSS customization. I'm also in contact with a local politician who is interested in me helping out with the social media/website of his campaign.\n\nThanks for any help!\n\n",

For accepting an empty string, you can simply ignore an input x (erase tape) and write w on the tape, then run M on w but how could I sure that L(M) is finite?",

        "text": "I'll attempt to prove why I believe the answer to this question is yes. \n\n\nThis proof rests on two assumptions, the set of solutions for any algorithm is unordered, like a bag you pull marbles out of, and |C|=k (explained later).\n\n\n\nThe state space of any problem solvable by a Turing machine M can be represented by a tree diagram T. \n\nEach node in T represents each state M could be in while solving the problem. \n\nEach node has a set of children C.\n\nThe algorithm’s solutions lie in the set L of leaves s.\n\nM has a “transition” function to get to these solutions, F, which pops an s from L.\n\n\n\nFor any M, how long would it take to decide if any given s was in L?\n\n\n\nThis depends on two factors, the depth of the tree d, and a branching factor k such that for all C, |C|&lt;=k. We will for this proof assume for all C, |C|=k.\n\n\n\nUsing these two constants, we can calculate |L|=k^d. When k = 1, no matter the size of d, it would only take 1 computation of F to decide if s was in L. However, when k&gt;1, or whenever a node of T has more than 1 child, the time to solve the problem begins to increase. No matter what M you create, it would always take more time to decide the answer than when k=1.\n\n\n\nIf we wanted to write this as a computer program, we’d write F in a loop until s was found. \n\n\n\tfor i = 0 to k^d\n\t\tx = F\n\t\tif x = s\n\t\t\tprint YES\n\t\tif i = k^d\n\t\t\tprint NO\n\n\n\nYou might ask, “is there a way to reduce the for loop?” With our underlying assumption that the set of solutions are like a bag of marbles and F is like reaching in and grabbing one, you’d have to solve a problem equivalent to solving the halting problem. The halting problem exists because we can’t look into the future to determine whether you will halt. It is the same case in this instance, we can’t look into the future to determine if we can find a marble in any n steps. Put another way, if we don’t explore the entire bag, we might miss the correct marble.\n\n\nEnd of proof\n\n\nInteresting thoughts:\n\n\n\tx = F\n\twhile x != s\n\t\tx = F\n\t\tif x == s\n\t\t\tprint YES\n\n\n\nThe while loop equivalent makes me wonder about the nature of loops. I conjecture if the answer to a solution is the condition you are searching for in the while loop, rather than some other property about the system, then the for loop equivalent will have a k^d count.\n\n\n\nAdditional Conjecture\n\nWhen |C|&lt;=k\n\nFor any T, b is the average cardinality of all sets C\n\n|L|=b^d",

        "text": "Sorry if this question doesn't really make much sense, but it's as best as I could express it. [It refers to this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CB1mYS5wBc&amp;t=35m18s), in which the person declares a char (1 byte), a short (2 bytes) and then an int (4 bytes) in C, but they all get allocated in 4-bytes intervals from each other.\n\nI kind of get the explanation of why this happens, but I'm wondering if this is a limitation of the **compiler** or the **cpu**. Because, when I tried it here, it allocated each type in 2-byte intervals, instead of 4. My processor is different, but so is my version of VC++ (I imagine), given that this is a 5-year old video, hence my confusion. I also wonder if this behaviour can be modified in the compiler.\n\nOn a different, but related, question: I've often heard that digital images have bit depths in powers of 2, the normal being 8-bits per channel. This means that if I have a 10-bit signal, it'll be allocated in a 16-bits/channel image, which I always imagined referred to this behaviour (padding for IO performance). However, since my environment and the person in the video's have different padding, does that mean a digital image would be read more or less efficiently depending on the machine architecture?",

So, I'd appreciate any high-level perhaps survey-type courses or videos which can help me get up to speed in some of those areas so that I can selectively do in-depth on ones of interest.\n\nAny suggestions?",
