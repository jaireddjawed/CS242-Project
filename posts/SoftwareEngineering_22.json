        "text": "So here's what's going on. The CSSI website says \"Google's Computer Science Summer Institute (CSSI) is a three-week introduction to computer science for graduating high school seniors with a passion for technology — especially students from historically underrepresented groups in the field.\"\n\nI'm a woman, so I guess you could say that I'm from an \"underrepresented\" group, so I had that going for me, and I've taken an introductory class to computer programming last year and I'm finishing up my AP Computer Science class this year. My dream is to one day be able to do something in the gaming industry, even though it's a toyugh field to get into and everyone and their brother wants to work for Blizzard, Twitch, Nintendo, etc. I answered all the questions to the best of my ability and I genuinely tried my hardest and I was really hoping to get in.\n\nBut I didn't. \n\nIf I lived somewhere like California, where there are lots of opportunities, I wouldn't be as upset / dissapointed.  But I live in Michigan, and in Michigan there is literally nothing but the auto industry. At least that's how I see it anyways. I genuinely feel like I'm trapped and there's literally nothing I can do. I feel like my one big chance is gone. I don't know what to do and I feel so lost and discoraged. I want to learn how to actually do meaningful things and I want to have a job that I enjoy,  I want to learn to make games or do something to do with gaming so I can make people happy, but it feels as if there aren't any opportunities for me. \nWhat should I do?\n\nIf you actually read all this, thank you so so much, I highly appreciate it. If you have any ideas or suggestions for me at all, even if you might think they're dumb, please comment because I'm desperate for advice. Once again, thanks for reading. \n\nTL;DR: I was rejected from CSSI and I feel like my one big chance has left me and I feel like there are no other opportunities for me because I live in Michigan and the industry here is automotive industry and I would rather not work in automotive.",

In college it was super easy to set goals because we had metrics for achievement (quizzes, tests, projects) which meant making a goal Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time Specific (SMART).  \n\nHowever, now that I’m in industry I’m not sure how to apply goal setting to my job. Sure, I could set short time goals for the week “finish X ticket/task before Y deadline with Z acceptance criteria”. But how can you set goals for medium and long term that are measurable and specific enough to measure achievement. I want to be “better at x” isn’t measurable and the specific tasks or tickets that I could be working on in 6+ months are unknown. \n\n\nThoughts? ",

        "text": "Hi, \n\nI'll preface this with I've only been programming for about 3 years now and I've less than a year working with C. I had a project with a loop that would run forever. However in the event of a cntrl\\-c signal we wanted to intercept the signal in order to free data and gracefully shut\\-down. \n\nIn order to do this we essentially followed this stack overflow: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4217037/catch\\-ctrl\\-c\\-in\\-c](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4217037/catch-ctrl-c-in-c) \n\nOur code looked remarkably similar to the example given, with a while loop that would run infinitely instead of conditionally. Adding that code is where the weirdness started. After successfully intercepting the cntrl\\-C command a few times our project just stopped working. The process would never get to the while loop. We deleted the added code and added print statements to track what was going on but even after deleting all the added signal intercept code and making again, the code didn't get any further. \n\nWhat's weirder is that when we went back a few commits to before we added the system code it worked again. I know this is rather vague but any ideas? I figure it might have been a linux thing since we were messing around with system calls.\n\nAlso, I was wondering if there was a better subreddit for the, like something specific for bugs that anyone is aware of.

        "text": "Hey everyone. I just wanted your opinion on matters I'm dealing with at the moment at my company. So the company I work for (who shall remain anonymous for obvious reasons, so let's call it Acme Co.) has an IT department and there's two developers, myself and my colleague. The IT department is in charge of all the servers (makes sense) and what we (the developers) want to do is to integrate Continuous Integration into our workflow. So far so good, we are using Bamboo from Atlassian for this purpose in conjunction with Jira and BitBucket. Our software is written in Java and to automate the build we use ANT scripts. Now, the problem arises when I need to test the ANT scripts on Bamboo. Bamboo is on a Linux server, while we're working on Windows machines, so I need to modify and test few things such as Ant-Contrib calls and code I added to introduce cross-platform compilation ability so we can build the whole product either on Windows or Linux with the same script file. To do this at the moment I need to change things in the script, and upload it to BitBucket and then test it in Bamboo as opposed to being able to go straight to the servers relevant folders through terminal and an SSH tunnel. That would remove all the spam commits, but the IT department doesn't want to give us read/write access to these folders or ANY location on the server. Is this a reasonable thing to do? Doing DevOpse without access to a server seems to me like cutting a log with your finger, it can probably be done but x1000 slower. Would you consider this a healthy work environment? What would you suggest? I probably could use a VM with Linux on it, but I feel treated like a kid.\n",
