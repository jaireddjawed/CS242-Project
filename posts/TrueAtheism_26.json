        "text": "Did not expect this to get as long as it did. Just in case, I will say ahead of time, I am not looking for advice, just simply sharing my experiences. Hoping that this maybe opens up some of you to share your own, or even a discussion about it.\n\n-----\n\nI am currently in my second year of college. I became agnostic during the 6th grade due to my brother exposing me to quaila soup videos, and later on after much thought fully became an atheist during my first year of high school.\n\nWhich was somewhat timed with the English class now taking some time to talk about the different religions of the world. (As a medium for teaching English. Making reports on things such as this helps as well as informs.)\n\nThe teacher asked us to raise our hands according to our beliefs. Being in the (northern part of the) Philippines, it did not surprise me one bit that the class was predominantly catholic or christian, with over 90% raising their hands then. I was the only atheist. And the teacher even asked me if I was sure that I was. I wasn't alone in being alone though, we also had a singular Muslim and Sikhist.\n\nAll throughout highschool, It was rarely even mentioned, even though everyone knew it. There was a part of me that wanted to share my beliefs to others, mostly because I was kind of alone in that fact, and had a lot on my mind. And another part of me that thought it could just cause trouble, and kept to myself unless someone asked me about it.\n\nI remember only being asked once, something along the lines of \"So, how do you know that there isn't a god?\" in which I explained the analogy of Russel's Teapot. I remember it being asked as a genuinely inquisitive question, far from being argument-provoking.\n\nAside from that, it was used for jokes every now and then, I recall our Filipino teacher giving us a quiz on archetypes. And when we kept insisting on a clue, she said \"If you read the bible, you'd know of one archetype of that story.\". I exclaimed by saying \"That's not fair!\" receiving a good chuckle from everyone.\n\nThe School I went to was very liberal. Even if the school wasn't liberal, Race was not much of an issue in the Philippines (as far as I know, where I studied at). \n\nReligion of all types was accepted, no, correction, welcomed. A lot of my classmates were genuinely interested in some of the practices that my Sikhist friend had, she did not ever cut her hair, and kept it braided. When un-braided, it would touch the floor. I remember forgetting about Ramadan when I offered my Muslim classmate some chips, thus sparking a conversation which cleared some of my misconceptions about Ramadan (I honestly thought they really didn't eat for the entirety of Ramadan, including night.)\n\nSexuality was a bit of an iffy subject, but mostly because of hormones, experiments and because it was highschool. There was never really any fuss put up about it. Except maybe from some of the guys, due to their disappointment when one of the prettiest girls in our school came out as gay. (In the form of \"Damn, now I'll never get a chance with her.\"). And some questions to our Muslim Classmate about how his sexuality could fit in to his beliefs (He was bisexual.)\n\nAnd today, I am studying at an even more liberal college, which I didn't even think was possible. A whole plethora of different people. They have one of the most active LGBT orgs I've ever heard about, I could expect at least 1/10th of them to be atheist, though my enthusiasm for deep conversation about religion has mostly faded away. Students from different countries as well, from Saudi, Iran, South Korea, the US. And a handful of special needs students that we take pleasure in making feel accepted.\n\nSo thank you, my peers and classmates, colleagues, mentors and professors for being as accepting as you are. For never having me feel an outcast just for my beliefs. Never having to constantly be argued or preached to. Nobody worried about me, praying for my soul, as my soul was satisfied already from the warm welcome you've all provided me and even others.\n\nAs for my family, my parents didn't know throughout most of highschool, My grandparents on my mother's side don't know until know, they were quite pious, I remember going to their house every sunday as a kid to recite the rosary with them.\n\nMy brother was the first member of my family whom I've told, My parents knew he was an atheist and so did I. He simply told me to not tell my grandparents about it, but telling our parents was my choice. I remember borrowing his Darwin books but never got to finishing them because the words were too complicated for me at that time.\n\nI told my dad in senior year, on ash wednesday. I told him that I passed by the nearby church and saw all this traffic of people who were having crosses smeared on their foreheads. My dad asked why I didn't have it done myself. I could have easily said that I was just impatient to go home, but I just thought, what the hell? why not? Told him because I was an atheist.\n\nI don't know what I was expecting, a lecture, a scolding, a beating? But it was certainly not this almost non-concerned reaction. \"Really now? since when?\" \"Since freshman year.\" \"Okay then, just don't get involved in any activist groups or anything.\"\n\nAnd life went on as if nothing happened. I remember reading online some stories from people who were kicked out of their house by their family members for such confessions, being scolded at, resented for years even. He did tell me later on not to tell my grandparents about it. I never did, and don't plan to. I don't think there is much reason to tell them anyway at this point.\n\nI know my dad came from a very strict, disciplined family back in the province. I guess he didn't want us siblings to go through what he went through. His family though, was (if I'm not mistaken) mostly catholic, with some being Muslim, so I guess religious disputes weren't a thing for his side of the family.\n\nMy dad told my mom of course, but I never even knew when. I just know he did and my mom didn't make any fuss about it. I guess whatever could have happened already happened with my older brother, not sure how that turned out. But I don't imagine it being too harsh.\n\nSo, thank you, brother, for being my early support through this, helping me figure things out whenever I got stuck in thought. And thank you, mom and dad, for being as open as you are. Thinking about it now, I could have come out as a bisexual buddhist transvestite goth kid and you still would have accepted me as your son. Thank you, for everything.\n\nAnd thank you, people of /r/Trueatheism, for hearing me out and being such a polite, thought-provoking bunch. I know there are a lot of people here and everywhere who have yet to come out about their beliefs, sexuality or radical views and lifestyles, and some of them for good reason. And I hope that one day, you might come out about it, and those people will say to you \"Wow, that's cool.\" and have no other thoughts about it other than genuine interest and curiosity, and still take you in with open arms.\n\n\n\n\n",

Like when a waiter brings you food and says \"enjoy your dinner\" and \"you too\" escapes your lips.\n\nBut why did I say that?  I didn't want to tell her the truth.  Rather than asking her that if there was a god, why was she homeless?  If there was a god would there be wars or sickness?   \n\nHolding onto religion was very toxic for me.  When I decided I was an atheist, I felt as if everyone but me knew there wasn't a god.  I literally was the last human on earth to know.  The feeling compares to coming home and finding something stuck in your teeth and know that it had been there since lunch.  Everyone was too uncomfortable to say thing.\n\nAre atheist responsible for validating and perpetuating someone's belief in god by not denouncing god?  Perhaps I am doing someone a great disservice by  simply not telling them there isn't a god.  \n",

Prior to becoming Christians, they were Roman Catholics their entire lives, so there seemed to be a bit more resentment towards the Catholic church. During the conversation, they brought up a few, but important points:\n\n* Catholics are not Christians (_they weren't invoking The No True Scotsman fallacy, they were saying they're not Christians in any way_)\n* Christianity is not a religion (_specifically, their church is not associated with any religions, no answer when I asked if they were non-denominational_)\n* I had used the words _cult_ and _ritual_ and immediately, I saw a panic and they were quick to deny that they were a cult\n\nConsidering that many of the members of the church were once Roman-Catholics, it makes sense as to why they were emphasizing on the differences between their church and the Catholic church. At some point, it became a bit apparent that they were really trying to distinguish themselves from Catholic church. Otherwise, those who are Roman-Catholic, but on the fence in converting, will realize that they're being sold essentially the same thing (the Bible).\n\n*What is everyone's take on the 3 points above?*",

        "text": "I’m just over one week into my M1 year of med school at a southern public university.  In a first few weeks we’ve had patient and physician discussion panels going over life in a hospital from both perspectives.  The role and importance of God in their healthcare (even at a secular state run academic hospital) couldn’t be understated in the eyes of the five women that made up our patient panel.  All five talked about how awesome it was that their doctor shared their faith and even joined with them in prayer.  Some even saying that all the doctor’s and nurses, even with their talents, were just facilitators in God’s plan.  All of the doctors spoke (much more briefly and professionally) about how important their faith was as a coping mechanism for losing a patient and finding purpose. \n\nI’ve found the same level of religiousness in my classmates.  Here we have interest groups that are mostly based around professional specialities with the only exceptions being groups like Christian Medical Students of America and Training for Trainers (a medical missionary group).  \n\nI’m starting to think it may be hard for me to relate to or build confidence in my relationship with patients and colleagues if they find faith so important in this bond.  I hoped to find societies online that already existed to provide strategies and discussion for patient interaction such as handling situations like: “are you a christian?”, “I feel very strongly that my doctor should share my faith, do you?”, or “Would you please pray with me before we do [...]”.  My search has turned up nothing but luckily I do have a small handful of classmates that are similarly areligious that are interested in forming or making a chapter of an existing secular physician society.  Also, we are hoping to avoid the ire of our peers by keeping the group as non-confrontational as possible since we will have to work with many of them for decades.  One friend suggested inter-religious healthcare communication for the name, which is good because many non-christians will be included in an issue they also face but I feel it will again leave atheists by the wayside. \n\nGetting to the point, my question is: do you know of any existing societies or organizations that cover such issues or can you suggest materials to help us in the formation of our own group to avoid the animosity of peers and have constructive, meaningful conversations?  \n",

I'm not too familiar with him besides his Fox News gig and his physical ailments, so I don't have a ton of context to put this clip in. She's obviously championing him for some reason, even though he's a self-proclaimed \"agnostic\" in the video.\n\nIn the video below (skip to the 1 hour 36 minute mark / about the last 7 or 8 minutes) he bemoans the \"village atheist\" while seeming to be a \"faitheist\" as Jerry Coyne would call it. He also says that most of the world's greatest thinkers throughout history have been theist. However, he's agnostic (but seems to edge towards deist in my opinion).\n\nMaybe the subtle message I'm supposed to get from the clip is that I should respect her faith (which I've tried to do)? I feel like there's a lot more that's wrong with what Krauthammer is saying, though. Anyone care to take a gander at the 6 minute clip and leave some feedback?

They knew that I wasn't religious but I don't talk about religion much with my real life friends so I figured it was understandable if they didn't know my position. I said yes, that I was an Agnostic Atheist and I got a confused \"What?\" from both. They told me to pick whether I was Agnostic or Atheist and I tried to clarify that you can be both, but neither seemed to understand. They claimed that the distinction was \"unnecessary\" and \"didn't make sense.\" One even said how it seemed like a cop-out. \"You just sound like you're giving yourself the chance to say 'oh, nevermind' in case a god shows up,\" to which I responded that, yes, if a god happened to present itself with enough evidence in front of me I'd find myself convinced. They scoffed.\n\nWe continued to talk and one friend remarked how weird he thought it was that Atheism was considered a religion. When I said that it in fact wasn't a religion they both sounded unconvinced. After giving them the simple definition that an Atheist doesn't believe in a god they then decided that it wasn't a religion at all but a philosophy, and therefore it, and Atheists themselves, don't fit in with religious debate. \n\nI felt miffed and more than a little condescended, but when I tried to defend my position, noting that Atheism was still a religious stance if not a religion itself, they both ignored me and changed the topic. I was frustrated, and left several minutes later.\n\nThis all comes after one of those friends previously insisted -- rather vehemently -- that Atheists can't \"be in the closet\" like some members of the LGBT community are because they don't face \"nearly the same\" oppression or consequences of revealing their real identity. He knows darn well that my parents are both devout Christians and that if I were to reveal my Atheism to them I'd be in for a long *long* period of screaming, insulting, and perhaps worse. I've had to hide my Atheism for years from them, nodding along or arguing only slightly whenever the topic is brought up at home. Most of my friends grew up in religiously vague households that didn't require them to go to church every Sunday or go to Catholic school until college, so most of the Atheism they say they see or talk about are the petty assholes who go around trying to vandalize churches or loudly claiming that God doesn't exist. I love learning about religion and the logic and debates involved in all religious stances, but any time debate is brought up between my friends and I try to generally question assertions or claims they make I feel like I'm just looked at as \"that Atheist friend\" that can't stand religion. When conversations like this happen I feel like my position is surrounded in misunderstanding and bias, even to those who don't have a religion, and I'm not given a fair chance to speak. \n\nI don't really regret not trying to be more insistent on defending or clarifying my stance, as I don't think it would have changed their minds or led to anything other than arguing, but it was a discouraging reminder that theists aren't the only group that can be rude, mistrustful, or innately biased against Atheists. I'm proud of all the research, reading, and soul-searching I've done on the topic, and I don't want to call myself anything else simply because I'd be given more respect. I understand the stigma it carries and I'm okay with that. I'd rather be true to myself -- when safe -- then try to live several lies.\n\nI just wish I could defend myself or my position without sounding like \"the angry Atheist.\" I wish other people were more learned on the subject of Atheism and the definition behind it -- or were at least willing to learn. I wish I could assert that I'm an Agnostic Atheist without being told I'm confused or therefore unable to participate in religious debate. I wish I had other strongly Atheist friends to talk casually to about religious debates or the logical reasoning behind certain arguments either for or against religion.\n\nThanks for allowing me to speak my mind and get this off my back. Just saying something about this has helped me to understand why this has bothered me since yesterday. Has anyone else had a similar experience? What did you say or do in response?",

        "text": "People mean so many different things when they say  \"God\". But what do the religious right mean?\nThey mean, briefly, the principle of patriarchal authority.\n\nAny hierarchy, any power institution, can be challenged. This is a weakness. What are the principles by which some claim to rule others? You can claim to want to protect others, you can claim superior wisdom, or, these days, you can claim to be acting in their best interests, to be serving them.\n\nBut a secular authority, a secular power institution, needs to make some justification, some excuse for holding and wielding power, for encroaching on the autonomy of other people, for making their decisions for them, for influencing them, utilising their capacities and dispositions in certain ways, and for certain ends.\n\nThe person who happens not to be in a position of power, and who happens to not want to hold sway over his fellow men, is thus acted on and influenced. He usually feels such undue influence as an imposition. He usually chafes at it. He usually tries to increase the sphere of his own autonomy, however he may.\n\nThus the individual, and the autonomous group, whose interests conflict with the interests of the power institution, are troublesome to the authorities. Power must be continually justified, and monitored, and the people continually mollified and reassured, which is certainly irksome to the authorities.\n\nHow then to justify rule definitively, and suffer no challenges, or at least, a decrease in challenges? Simple. Claim that your right to rule was given you by a deity. Claim that this guarantees your right. Claim that thus he who challenges you is challenging the deity himself, and also, the entire natural order of the universe.\n\nDisguise your use of power, your wielding of power, by speaking, as it were, through the mouth of an idol. Call your ends the ends of the deity, and make it known that the ends of the deity are ipso facto good and also, unchallengeable. If challenges are still made, resort to threats, and identify these, too, with the power and might of the deity. Disguise your own violence, your own base instincts, by imputing them to the deity.\n\nEvery day, this becomes clearer. Those who are mystics, metaphysicians, philosophers, idealists, or followers of Eastern religions may indulge in hierarchies, in institutions, in strict social forms. But they may just be individualistic seekers after truth.\n\nThe test is this: Is the form of hierarchy freely agreed to? Is it entered into honestly? Is the unequal social relationship that results voluntary? Above all, is there a mechanism to dissolve it, to make it last just so long as the individual wishes it to last? Given these conditions, the power structure cannot fail to be based on the individual, and the power cannot fail to flow from the bottom up.\n\nThe Abrahamic religions completely fail this test, and in this, as in many other ways, they are revealed to be only the embodiment of top-down, hierarchical, patriarchal authority, an authority which needs divine sanction in order to legitimise itself. A challenge to superstition is a challenge to illegitimate authority.\n",

Once the rapture occurs, earth will be subject to the judgments laid out in Revalation. This means that the world won't just be devoid of Christians. It will be having God's wrath poured out upon it by that benevolent sumbitch-and you'll be there for all of it.\n\nIf I Met God, I Would Curse Him For What He Has Done Wrong.\n\nThis point somewhat ties in with the previous one. For the purposes of this argument, assume God is real. If you were standing before him at the great white judgment throne, you might not have the ability to shit in non corporeal form, but your metaphysical pants would be full of it upon sight of his divine grace.\n\nIf you were somehow able to overcome the pants-filling fear, your criticisms would be meaningless. As illogical and paradoxical as Jehovah-God is, you epuld be unable to make him feel guilt or sorrow. Your petty opinions would be nothing against his omniscience and omnipotence. Your words would be disregarded as you were cast into the fiery depths of the lake of fire.\n\nAt Least Hell Will Be Full of Good People That Rejected God and It Won't Be So Bad. \n\n*See the \"Total and Complete Pain amd Agony Section of the Welcome to Hell Brochure, Page 11\".\n\nBe realistic. If Hell is real, you wont be galivanting amongst the fields of pretty flowers, sharing company with Niel Degrasse Tyson and Richard Dawkins.\n\nYou will be aflame.\n\n\nI fully understand that most of these points are brought up in a joking fashion. However, if they are presented to Christians, it makes us look like petuant 12 year olds. Thank you to anyone who has read this, and again I apologize for any typos.",

About halfway through filling out the paperwork, I noticed that the radio was playing easy listening Christian music. Then, on the way out, his teacher asked me what church we went to, to which I simply replied that we don't go to church. She then explained that her and her husband were ordained ministers in the Church of God and invited us to attend the church where he was the minister. She started to ask what I thought might be something about why we don't attend and I politely interrupted her stating that this was a conversation for another time, where she quickly got the point.\n\nI'm really not sure how to handle this. It's a public school. She seems like a really good teacher. But that was very inappropriate and borderline illegal. I'm worried that if I say anything it might affect how she will treat my son, but now that she knows we don't attend church I'm not sure if she will keep that separate from his education.\n\nI knew it would happen one day. I'm just glad I didn't say anything then so I could think about what I should do first. Trust me, it was difficult not to say anything just from noticing the music!",

When you're wrapped up in religion you're told to spread the word, constantly be on the look out for those to share with and to practice your skills in evangelism. But when you Deconvert suddenly all that goes away. \n\n\nWhen I believed in God I was almost constantly rewarded for talking to others about what I believe, but after Deconverting there's suddenly a stigma to talking to strangers about my personal views, and not just from the religious. Christians say I should keep quiet, atheists say I shouldn't bother, and the general public has developed a stereotype of \"how do you know someone is an atheist, don't worry they'll let you know\" which seems to say \"can you please stop talking about it\". \n\n\nIn church I was told that truth matters more than anything. After all Jesus is the way, The Truth, and the life. Later on in life I read a line (I think by Sagan) \"Anything that can be destroyed by the truth should be\". These two ideas, both that truth is important and that truth should be valued above other things, sort of stuck with me throughout my life and I think steered me in the direction I find myself now. \n\n\n\nTo get to my point, the other day I saw a [Street Epistemology video](https://youtu.be/AMfBXymExsk) where a man spoke to random people and attempted to get them to criticality analyze their own beliefs. \n\n\nWhat are you thoughts on this? Is this a good thing or is it too close to apologetics? \n\n\nPersonally I find the idea of its existence confusing, like my old world and new world colliding. Is it something beneficial that would help relieve some negative stigma on atheism, or is it simply evangelism in disguise? I don't know. ",

I didn't realize how important of a support that was for me until recently I've found myself, to my regret, lashing out at my family for not being emotionally supportive, when in fact their behavior hasn't changed; it's just my ability to depend on God instead that's missing. \n\nObviously as time goes on I'll become more self reliant and acquire new coping mechanisms, but in the mean time can you suggest any meaningful strategies to help with this feeling? Meditation and therapy don't really play the same role and though I have some very wonderful close friends and an incredible SO who help immensely, it's more of the parental figure that now feels missing. \n\nThank you!",

        "text": "I fell into a Christian preach-hole on another widely used social-networking site. They are all up in arms about abortion because FUX News has them riled up over Planned Parenthood this week. It occurred to me that we can derive some facts about Heaven based on our knowledge of reproduction and their Bible.\n\nHeaven is *packed* with 8 cell blastocysts.\n\nIn fact, 8 cell blastocysts would seem to me to be the most common inhabitant of Heaven by an order of magnitude. But someone should help me out with the math on this. Given that the soul is injected at conception (apparently it sneaks in through the hole the sperm made?), and the fact that around 50% of pregnancies spontaneously abort, it therefore follows that *no matter how you do the math or what you believe about young earth creationism* Heaven is mostly spontaneously aborted fetuses. Depending on the details about what a Christian believes regarding Creationism and what percentage of people get into Heaven, I would ballpark it at 10 to 1,000 unborn humans for every live-born human.\n\nThis is assuming that all spontaneously aborted, miscarried, and stillborn fetuses get the automatic pass. I haven't met any Christians that go the other way on this one. I think Catholics put miscarriages in Limbo before Francis eliminated it with a wave of his golden sceptre. No one seems willing to condemn the unborn to Hell.\n\nGiven that there is about one spontaneous abortion/miscarriage/stillbirth for every live birth, this has implications, calculable implications, for Heaven. Using Hitchens' generous, low-ball estimate of 100,000 years as the age of humanity, this means that for 95% of human existence *the only \"people\" getting into Heaven were the unborn.* Everyone else... ZIP! Straight to Hell. Sorry, bad timing.\n\nNevertheless, this is a huge number. The liberal Christian interpretation of the mechanics of Heaven *must* acknowledge this: That for 13.7 billion years, God was utterly alone. Then 100,000 years ago, he created humanity by popping \"souls\" into apish early humans. Then for 95,000 years he sat in Heaven, collecting zygotes, blastocysts, and fetuses. If the thing pops out and takes a single breath... straight to Hell, of course. But still, this is *billions upon billions* of unborn children packing heaven full before a single human being who was born ever gets into the club.\n\nThen after God opened the house of bliss up to one little tribe on one corner of the Mediterranean we've had 5,000 years were *some* adults *might* get into Heaven. But even during this 5,000 year period, there is on average one automatic unborn entrant to Heaven for every live birth. \n\nConsider the absurdity of this condition. What form would a single cell zygote that was only \"alive\" for a few hours even take in Heaven? What would a pack of 32 cells *do* for *all eternity?* What kind of conversation would one have with a fetus the size of a peanut that still has a tail the length of the rest of its body? Would God do some sort of age progression on them? Would he run them through some kind of Earth simulator to give them pseudo-experiences to bring them up to speed? Why? Would he give them some strange simulated adult spirit body? Again, why?\n\nIf you believe that the soul is \"injected\" at conception or at some other fetal stage, then *you have to believe something along these lines.* It follows inevitably. What if, as it does happen, you are a woman who is trying to get pregnant, but you have *many* miscarriages or spontaneous abortions? This happens. Women try to get pregnant for years sometimes and can have *dozens* of spontaneous abortions. When you get to Heaven, what is there waiting for you? Dozens of bizarre spirit babies? Adults? What? Something has to happen, and whatever it is, it's WEIRD.",

Many of his arguments were similar to points that William Lane Craig likes, which obviously don't hold water. Fortunately, everyone was amiable and friendly and we talked until late in the night. No new ground was tread, but I'd be glad to review any particular facet of the discussion if anyone would like to know.\n\nI did something that I consider a little unusual that I would like to know what everyone thinks about it. I try to approach these conversations from a perspective of epistemology in an attempt to show that faith is an unreliable path to truth and that reason is reliable but necessarily demands a rejection of beliefs in the supernatural. I generally just ask a lot of questions to try to help people think better.\n\nHowever, a couple of hours into the discussion I felt as though my former preacher was not making any progress in learning to reason better. He was unable to see, even when it was directly shown, when he was begging the question or arguing from ignorance. So, I chose to do something a little different from my normal fare. Instead of attempting to help him reason better, I decided to put the true character of faith on display. I started to ask the more aggressive questions about God commanding the slaughter of children (except pre-teen girls for \"reasons\") and things of that nature. I did this for the benefit of my friend to attempt to show how dangerous and terrible faith-based beliefs can be. Ultimately resulting in this exchange:\n\nMe: \"But if everything that God commands is moral, then you must accept not only that there is a context where slaughtering children and raping pre-teen girls is not only acceptable, but is, in fact, the highest moral action one can take.\"\n\nPreacher (sheepishly): \"Well, I don't know if I would characterize it like that.\"\n\nWhich I felt demonstrated fairly clearly what I was trying to show.\n\nMy question is this: Do you think that moving strategies like this was a good idea? Was it helpful, or do you think that I should have continued to try to stick to epistemology and undermining faith and a path to truth?",

My brother is deist because the philosophical stance appeals to him, but, likewise, he finds the Christian god rationally unsustainable.\n\nMy parents know about our atheism (towards the Christian god, in any case), but they've pleaded with us to keep it a secret from our grandparents. On my dad's side, my grandfather is a pastor of a church, and they've been involved in mission work their whole lives. On my mom's side, it's just a deep part of their lives, giving god the credit for all good things, and Satan the credit for all bad things.\n\nLikewise, with my extremely-catholic inlaws, while they know I'm an atheist (and despise me for it, even going so far as to tell my husband I was the worst mistake he'd ever make), my husband wants me to curtail anything I say online, or anywhere they might hear of it, so as not to offend them.\n\nI've grudgingly gone along with this. But the other day, I saw my grandparent's post on facebook, talking about how evil atheists are, and how they're glad they don't know any.\n\nGuys, I wanted to tell them *so badly.* I wanted to say, \"Actually, you know a lot of atheists. Believe it or not, a lot of atheists keep silent about it all the time, for fear of being judged, like you've just done with this post. You even have relatives that are atheist - I happen to know, having been atheist my entire adult life.\"\n\nOf course, I'd probably just get disowned, and cause a massive amount of drama.\n\nOn one hand, it's not worth it to cause terror and stress in a bunch of old people who will be dying soon. For their sakes, it's kinder to shut up for a while.\n\nOn the other, it'd be good for people to realize that we're not some bizarre \"other\" that they've never met. It's good to be out, for the sake of society - one tiny opinion at a time.\n\nRegardless, I've never been good at shutting up, and it really grates on me. I wish there were a perfect solution, but I know there never will me. My grandparents will all die without understanding who I am and what I stand for. Atheism itself is only one part of that - but humanism, anti-theism, a dedicated to morality outside the confines of religion, dedication to equality for all, being fervently opposed to bible-based sex beliefs... all of the banners I fly, all of the battles I try to fight... they can't know about any of them. They must believe a lie.\n\nJust so that they can die in peace.\n\nCan't help but wonder... is it really worth it?",

        "text": "I was reading Leo Tolstoy's book \"A Confession\", always a fascinating read, when I came across this interesting passage when he's discussing his youthful loss of faith:\n\n\"A certain intelligent and honest man named S. once told me\nthe story of how he ceased to be a believer. At the age of twenty-six, while taking shelter for the night during a hunting trip, he\nknelt to pray in the evening, as had been his custom since childhood.\nHis older brother, who had accompanied him on the trip,\nwas lying down on some straw and watching him. When S. had\nfinished and was getting ready to lie down, his brother said to him,\n\"So you still do that.\" And they said nothing more to each other.\nFrom that day S. gave up praying and going to church. And for thirty years he has not prayed, he has not taken holy communion,\nand he has not gone to church. Not because he shared his brother's\nconvictions and went along with them; nor was it because he had\ndecided on something or other in his own soul. It was simply-that\nthe remark his brother had made was like the nudge of a finger\nagainst a wall that was about to fall over from its own weight. His\nbrother's remark showed him that the place where he thought\nfaith to be had long since been empty; subsequently the words he\nspoke, the signs of the cross he made, and the bowing of his head\nin prayer were in essence completely meaningless actions. Once\nhaving admitted the meaninglessness of these gestures, he could\nno longer continue them\". \n\nSo, my question is, does this sound familiar to anyone? Was anyone else's loss of faith triggered suddenly by a seemingly trivial incident or comment? \n\nFor me it does sound familiar, not so much in that there was a specific incident, but in that I simply abandoned the religious habit one day and never resumed it. There was no great epiphany, nor did I particularly reason it out. It seemed to come quite naturally, as a progression, at about the age of 15. I still remember the last time I felt religious, and then, shortly afterwards, I simply didn't anymore, rather in the same way you get tired of an old coat and suddenly decide not to wear it anymore, or you visit a girlfriend and suddenly realize that you don't like her anymore. It might be rather melancholy but is not usually experienced as a crisis. \n\n",

Most of the author's arguments are easy to refute, but I need your help with writing a clear response to some of them. I am writing a paper on this book as a summer project and as a part of a long discussion I'm having with a friend.\n\nFirstly, Wurmbrand often claims that God as the ultimate and perfect being is above logic, science and reason and that these cannot be used to disprove his existence. How do you even argue with this?\n\nAlso, he uses several versions of the argument from design. He says that something as complicated as our circulatory system is so complicated that it would be ridiculous to think it came about by chance. He claims that the Universe is running smoothly and is in order and that implies someone is keeping it in order. Does Newton's first law refute this?\n\nFurthermore, I need some help with using evolution as a counter-idea. He writes that music and art would never evolve and thus is evidence for God's existence. He also says conscience is evidence for God's moral code and that faith in God itself would not originate by evolution. Then he even writes that just by being moral atheists confirm God's existence. I sense that these statements are silly, but  I lack enough knowledge from biology to succinctly refute his claims.\n\nAt one point, he uses an analogy to show that life after death should exist. He imagines how silly it would be for an unborn baby to think that his mother's womb is the only thing that is and then says that it is ridiculous that we think we can determine anything about the afterlife only from experiences we have from this life. \n\nHe also compares faith to an X-ray machine, because it allows believers to see something that is usually hidden from us.\n\nPersonally, I like the Multiverse theory, but I heard it is the same as faith in a deity because it is a belief without evidence.\n\nI know I have presented many points in this post, any help would be much appreciated.",

Truly. \n\nHey there,\n\nI figured this would be a good place to get some advice or just extra opinions to help me through this hard time.\n\nShort and sweet version of things:\n\n* Grew up Christian\n\n* Met woman who was Christian \n\n* Dated for 5+ years\n\n* Engaged\n\n* Began losing faith eventually culminating in me not being able to call myself a Christian. Looking back on my journals at this time I identified myself as just a plain old agnostic. Big talk with fiancee about what this means and came to a compromise. I was very apathetic towards religion/Christianity/faith in general and had zero issues letting her do her thing especially when it came to raising the children. I had no issue still attending church and such I just didn't believe in it anymore.\n\n* Went on a summer long trip to the middle east where I came out on the other side an atheist without any shadow of doubt. All the research I did prior to the  trip/talk with my fiancee just made complete sense with the world around me and what I saw, heard, and experienced over in the middle east. \n\n* Got married in the fall\n\n* Finally was able to process my time this summer and what it meant to me and how it changed me after a super fucking busy year of last year of school (yay student teaching!) and being a newly wed! Once I graduated and had time to myself...it all hit me like a semi-truck. It wasn't something I realized until nearly 8 months after I got back.\n\nI am quite frankly an anti-theist and a strong atheist. I do not hate religion/Christianity/faith but I really just can't stand it for countless reasons. After months of attending church with my wife I simply couldn't do it any longer because it was becoming a negative thing to me even though I tried so hard to just be there to support my wife in her faith. I respect/love my wife, I respect her holding her beliefs, but the beliefs themselves I do not respect. That is an issue. I can compartmentalize things quite well in that regard but honestly I am scared of how it will manifest years down the road. We've been having tons of talks for the past 4-5 months since I came to terms where I stand and how that changes the dynamic of our marriage and especially our future. We're going to marriage counseling as it stands to see if things can be worked out as well. We have great communication and stuff but we would really benefit from a third party facilitating our discussions we think. We have talked about divorce but we're still going to give counseling and having divorce on the table (to let the reality of that set in) for a couple more months before we decide anything and just continue to love each other while handling these very deep issues.\n\nI'm just stuck. I am not frothing at the mouth or an emotional mess when it comes to my anti-theism/atheism. This is a position I have come to through rationality and logic these past almost two years since I started going down the rabbit hole. I just simply don't want my children raised in the faith. My wife does. We keep on trying to find a compromise but when we're both at such ends on the \"spectrum\" (she is a strong and faithful Christian) there really doesn't seem to be a solid middle ground without one of us heavily compromising our personal feelings/convictions. That is not a healthy dynamic to have nor do I see that being a good thing for us as individuals. Even going beyond kids...my wife not having someone she can discuss her faith with saddens me as well as her.

I just can't turn a switch and suddenly feel ambivalent or apathetic towards religion. \n\n",

I would also infer that I'm not the only person who gets more rustled by seeing this than they should after so much time spent on the internet.\n\nMy question to all of you is how true have you found atheist stereotypes to be? Have the atheists you've met been overwhelmingly different to what theists think of us, and is so, what's with this disconnect between how atheists really are? And lastly, are \"internet atheists\" really as bad as people say we are?\n\nI'd like to hear what kind of experience you all have had with the issue. I've certainly found the other atheists around me to be exceptionally intelligent and personable, and haven't found any good reason to believe that this is an exception and not the rule.",

        "text": "Let’s talk about morality.\n\nI am in the deep south of the USA and I frequently hear the “no morality without God” argument. Obviously this argument is incredibly flawed for numerous reasons and we, as atheists, usually bring about all the classic arguments to dispel this nonsense. However, I would like to, instead of simply rebutting it like we always do, explore a moral system that I believe everyone should be able to relate to in some way. I think we all have common ground, if we can only get others to see it. This approach is my attempt at swaying the conversation away from debating the source of morality (I find this debate normally ends in huffs and puffs, rather than any form of understanding), and instead focus on the real issues.\n \nMy system for morality comes down to the answers to two questions. Your answers may be different from mine and thus your morals may be different from mine but I think we all base our morals on the answers to these two questions in some way or another. (This system is not a system of determining what **is** moral, rather just what **is not** moral.)\n\nMorality breaks down into the answers to two questions:\n\n1. What is the goal of humanity?\n\n2. What is the goal of the individual human?\n\n**Everything you do must not objectively, and actively work against the answers to either of those two questions.** Note that I am not saying that all actions must work toward these goals to be moral, simply that any actions that work against them, are immoral. All other actions are permissible within this system.\n\nNow, this does not mean I have the absolute correct answers to these two questions, Everyone’s answers will probably be different but at least, I think, most can agree on the foundation of this system. My personal answers are below.\n\n1. To proliferate and advance, spreading as far as is possible in order to observe as much of the universe as is possible.\n\n2. To enjoy life as a free individual and, in some way, contribute to the greater goal of humanity.\n\nAn example of how my personal answers to these questions drive my morality on a few large moral topics:\n\n \n\n· **Abortion:** Abortion clinics decrease crime in urban areas and do not objectively, work against either goal\n\n· **Murder:** Murder makes it objectively impossible for the victim to “enjoy life as a free individual and, in some way contribute to the greater goal of humanity” and thus is immoral.\n\n· **Stealing:** Depending on the circumstance this can actively work against the first and second goals. However, there are circumstances in which stealing would not be immoral. (An impoverished person stealing from a large corporation with large amounts of excess money, for example).\n\n· **Religion:** Depending on the religion, this could actively work against both goals. If the religion, in any way, promotes ideals that hinder the progression and advancement of humanity, it is immoral.\n\n \n\nAgain, this is merely a base foundation for determining what is immoral- there are additions that could be made, for example: I also include the “golden rule” in my view of morality, but regardless of the additions, this should be, in my opinion, at the core of everyone’s morality- even if you are religious. A Christian, for example, may answer the questions like this:\n\n \n\n1. To glorify god and fulfill his plans\n\n2. To follow god’s law and in doing so, contribute to the glorification of god\n\nIf a religious person can accept this argument, we can then debate the answers to these two questions instead of debating the source of morality. What do you think about this approach?",

My wife is still religious, and her religion has been a major source of tension since my deconversion. We were both christians in a christian college when we married, been married for almost 5 years, no kids. \n\n\nIt has been very difficult for me to feel like she isn't lying when she says she loves me because of her understanding of her faith. According to her, because I don't believe I will both A) have a bad life without the blessing of God and am likely to live in despair and anxiety, and B) not be with her, her family, or any kids we might have in the afterlife. She believes this is just, and that I deserve this, I have asked directly. \n\n\nImmediately after saying this, she will tell me that she loves me. How can you love someone and think they deserve hell, or at least separation from her after death? What does it mean to love someone you think deserves a shitty life? I have a similar problem with my parents who outright tell me I am going to hell because I don't think like them. What kind of \"love\" is this? \n\n\nI apologize that this is a personal problem and I don't expect anyone to have all the answers. How do you guys reconcile love from religious family members? Am I just having trouble compartmentalizing their religion from their love? \n\n\nI do recognize that, from their perspective, trying to save me from Hell is very loving and maybe the most loving thing you could do, but now that I see it from the outside, it just feels like they are saying they love me but they love their beliefs more than me. They love their ideology more than me. If I am right, is this a path even worth going down with them? Is this a subject I should just drop? \n\nThanks. ",

        "text": "On this day, a new religion was born. Although it was only new in name: Christianity. It took all of the self-loathing and shame of Judaism and pinned it onto a Galilean God-man. It seeks to glorify this man's suffering. But Jesus did not simply suffer. No, he *submitted*. He gave himself up to authority and neglected his own well-being. In fact, this \"Christ\" is the epitome of weakness and pity. All you need to do is read the \"Good News\" to learn that. Therefore, it is no surprise to see what Christianity condemns as sin: all things that are natural to man. Pride, lust, idolatry, etc. These are all the things that allow man to persist. What is pride? Pride is what allowed our ancestors to bear the cold winds of ancient times. What is lust? Lust is what allowed them to thrive and reproduce. What is idolatry? Idolatry allowed them freely choose their values. \n\nContrast the Golden Age of Greece with Christian society. The Greeks were pagans who held their passions and strengths to the utmost regard. They reveled in life, viewed nature honestly, and invented skepticism. They would laugh at Christianity! Christianity, on the other hand, upholds a sickening disgust of life and weakness. The frail and sick have only to hope for heaven! This is the death cry of the Christian. Here is a dichotomy between Christian values and humanistic values:\n\n* Sin vs. Egoism\n\n* Guilt vs. Love\n\n* Weakness vs. Strength\n\n* Dissatisfaction with life vs. Love of life\n\n* Faith vs. Evidence\n\nLet's look at some representative Bible verses that demonstrate these lovely Christian values, shall we?\n\n* 2 Corinthians 12:10: For the sake of Christ, then, I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities; for when I am weak, then I am strong.\n\n* 2 Timothy 2:3: Share in suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. \n\n* 2 Timothy 3:12: Indeed all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted, \n\nSo, Christianity embodies suffering, persecution, and weakness. How wonderful! The good book saves indeed! If only one needed saved in the first place...\n\n\"Christianity as antiquity.-- When we hear the ancient bells growling on a Sunday morning we ask ourselves: Is it really possible! This, for a jew, crucified two thousand years ago, who said he was God's son? The proof of such a claim is lacking. Certainly the Christian religion is an antiquity projected into our times from remote prehistory; and the fact that the claim is believed - whereas one is otherwise so strict in examining pretensions - is perhaps the most ancient piece of this heritage. A god who begets children with a mortal woman; a sage who bids men work no more, have no more courts, but look for the signs of the impending end of the world; a justice that accepts the innocent as a vicarious sacrifice; someone who orders his disciples to drink his blood; prayers for miraculous interventions; sins perpetrated against a god, atoned for by a god; fear of a beyond to which death is the portal; the form of the cross as a symbol in a time that no longer knows the function and ignominy of the cross -- how ghoulishly all this touches us, as if from the tomb of a primeval past! Can one believe that such things are still believed?\"\n\n-Nietzsche *Human, All Too Human*\n\nSo, are you a Christian? Or do you instead love life? I know which one I choose...",
