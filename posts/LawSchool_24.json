It made for a hectic week, as I pursued charges, obtained a PPO, had multiple police contacts, medical appointments, and all around was a mental health train wreck. I missed three days of class (and the readings), and generally kept my professors informed without sharing too much. They were accommodating and understanding.\n\nI needed an extension on a legal writing assignment, and emailed my professor in that class with a few more details than the others. He was amazing, told me to basically take as long as I needed, and encouraged me to reach out to the Office of Student Affairs to make them aware, as they have resources and could facilitate telling my other professors.\n\nI have already made an appointment was the school's counseling resources, and I was a bit hesitant to even do that because of my friends' experiences with school counseling resources in undergrad (perhaps unfair beings that it was a different school).\n\nI'm feeling better than I was immediately afterwards, but still not great. I live alone now for the first time in a long time, and it's weird... And the task of catching up is daunting, even though it's just been a few days.\n\nWhat are the pros and cons of telling Student Affairs? I don't want this to become something that is following me for the rest of my time in Law School and/or in Character and Fitness if I'm able to overcome it now. Maybe that's a silly take... I'm just very distrustful of organizational power. Thoughts and personal experiences welcome, just looking for insight.",

I'd take this position hands down if it wasn't so far away. Unfortunately, moving closer for the summer isn't an option.\n\n2. DA's office in the next county over. About half the commute time (45min drive or an hour on the train). Also sounds like a great job and really connected with the interviewer. Unpaid, but my school offers summer funding that amounts to about 80% of the small firm's salary. \n\nObviously, #1 sounds like an instant No because of the commute, but I'm told that a 1L paid firm position is so rare that I'm almost tempted to convince myself I could do it for a summer.\n\nOr should I keep looking altogether for a job in my city? I live in a big city and a semi-major market, I'm surprised that I'm going to have to commute at all this summer :(",

        "text": "Hi. I am in the second semester of my 1L year. I'll save you the I have always done well in school speech I'm sure we all know it by heart. Here's the issue: I have been in treatment for an anxiety disorder for over three years, and I cannot get used to or survive cold calls and it's making me want to quit altogether. I am in good standing, have a decent scholarship, and already have summer opportunities appearing. However, the calls are destroying me mentally and I do not know what to do. I am one of the quietest people in the class, have a few sprinkles of friends here and there, and a boyfriend who goes to school with me, but otherwise, I don't talk to many people. I have a STEM background and have always done well in school by listening and putting in good-faith work. Obviously, this method is not working. The reasons why I am in law school are not relevant here, I am in it now. I try everything to prep and ready myself. But I am ripping my fingers bloody, cannot breathe deeply during school hours, not sleeping nights before (esp. Sundays like today), sick all day at school to the point where its hard to even talk to others (people often assume I am a bitch now), I almost always skip lunch so that I don't throw up out of fear. Last week I was called, I had prepped a lot but it did not matter, when I have to public speak my brain is a literal nonfunctioning black abyss. I got ripped apart by the prof and left for the bathroom after bc it was just too much. As soon as I got into the stall I just started balling uncontrollably. I intended to return to class---really. But I cried for the full hour and just never made it back in. Someone brought me my backpack and I just sat in my car until the next class (which was very awkward to walk into but I was just proud of myself for not driving away). I don't know how to control this issue or make it stop. I thought it would get better as I got used to law school but it has only gotten worse. I obviously do not want to litigate and there are niches for that. I like the content, the work, and the things ahead. I cannot get used to this part of school no matter what I try. After Covid calmed down I got a physical illness that forced me to isolate for even longer. So I am really not used to interacting with people.  I have been on multiple medications, tried different therapies, and a year ago, I could barely leave my house and only go to the coffee shop and back home once a day; grocery stores at peak hours were too much for me. I have come far really, my Drs and family are so proud. But not far enough for cold calling. Please Please help me.",

Because I was not mentally stable enough to be able to hit the minimum gpa to keep going. Basically I was extremely suicidal. I have five severe mental disorders that I had under control before law school but moving across the country, losing my therapist, not being able to get meds &amp; other variables caused me to majorly struggle. I emailed professors, the director of student services, &amp; the person in charge of accommodations. Everyone who needed to know I made sure to inform. At the end of the semester I ended up having to reschedule my last two finals because I had to check myself into the ER for being a danger to myself. I also had other health issues that impacted my ability to perform my best. After grades were all posted I was notified I was dismissed for missing the minimum gpa by 0.06, yes you read that correctly, 0.06. I can’t appeal due to the student handbook regulations. Like I was very near to unaliving myself yet I still managed to miss the minimum by only 0.06. Am I crazy or is this completely unfair? Thoughts on what to do next?",

        "text": "So, we all know the legal profession has a bimodal salary distribution. You either start out making around 150-215k or 50-70k. For the folks who start out on the lower end of that curve, I've found very little information on what salary growth is like AFTER this crucial first year. Yes, I know most attorneys won't make it to BigLaw and won't be making 200k at their first job but even if you start out making 60k as a tax or real estate lawyer working at a small firm, surely that salary most grow to the point, where in 5-10 years, you'd be making 100k? This is a very difficult question because there is very little information online about this subject. The only information I'm going off of is the BLS's average salary of a lawyer which is around 120k and the salary numbers that law schools provide and the obvious problem with those numbers is that they only apply to first year lawyers. \n\nI'll be applying to law school next year, and I'm carefully weighing and researching the financial risks of attending. Lawyers (online like on Reddit) tend to be very negative and discourage people from going to law school, but for my situation, it's what I want to do. There aren't a lot of alternatives. If anyone has any information on what salaries for lawyers are like after the first year, please let me know.",

In undergrad, they were caught cheating on a test during their freshman year and accepted an F in lieu of proceeding down any path re academic discipline. The course was later retaken and a passing grade was obtained, but the F remains on their transcript. There’s no other documentation of the incident or anything in their file evidencing it. They didn’t disclose this incident to their law school when they applied.\n\nThere’s a question on the bar application that’s pretty on point to this situation. Essentially asking whether a reduced or failing grade was ever accepted in lieu of facing academic discipline. I told my friend to consult with a C&amp;F attorney, but they don’t seem to think this is necessary and believe that the risk of this being uncovered is extremely low. \n\nWhat’s the worst that could happen here? Is the worst case scenario that they simply wouldn’t be admitted? They are mostly looking at JD Advantage jobs and aren’t extremely concerned about being admitted to the bar to begin with.",

I am waiting to hear back from two firms that i had call backs at, as well as, one firm I am waiting to see if I got to the call back stage.. is it possible to ask the recruiting team if I got the internship or not since i have an exploding offer? or is that not appropriate and will ruin my chances for next summer",
