Fair enough, as I saw they were all over the place so it was hard to match them to the correct labels. \n\nI scan each mat so I\u2019m able to match it up and tell them the price of each mat. (I also organised them back to how they should be so the labels matched) We only had two different brands in, the stores own brand and a separate brand where all designs were \u00a35. The stores own brand was \u00a312. I explained that this one stack of mats was \u00a312 and that the rest on the shelves were \u00a35. They obviously wanted the cheaper ones so I made sure that it was clear they knew what ones were what. \n\nHappy with that, I left them and carried on with my other work. About 20 minutes later. I hear my name called over the tannoy to come to the front desk. \n\nTurns out, these customers that wanted the \u00a35 mat decided they wanted to only pay \u00a35 but they wanted the \u00a312 mat. So they picked that up and we\u2019re shocked when it came to, guess what! \u00a312. So much so that they took it to customer services to get to the bottom of this mystery. \n\nThey basically said i had lied to them about the price of the mat, when I hadn\u2019t. Why on earth would I lie about that. There literally were doormats there that cost \u00a35 right there if they wanted to only pay \u00a35. \n\nI\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s a thing customers do to try and get money off when they see something similar and cheaper, but still want the more expensive item.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1678142831.0},{"title":"Policies are Written by People","author":"arceuspatronus","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromRetail\/comments\/11kmkbx\/policies_are_written_by_people\/","text":"Obligatory non-native not US but I've been speaking English since I was 8 and on my laptop so any error is my own doing. Conversation translated to English plus my hazy memory means these were definitely not verbatim.\n\nI used to work as an online sales rep\/customer support for a national electronics chain store. Half of the job involved dealing with tech-illiterate customers and those who didn't know the difference between a debit card and a credit card. There were quite a few funny stories (and a few death threats) but this one kinda stood out for some reason.\n\nAs per policy, our returned\/displayed products were (and to my knowledge still are) sold in-store, since the online listing only showed them as \"scratched\" or something similar, and because there was no return policy for those products, customers might want to know the exact conditions of the things they're paying for. Plus, it significantly hindered (but not completely stopped) those who claimed the products they bought were already broken before those got to them. \n\nOne day I was assigned a chat window that happened as followed (M - Me, C - Customer or another C-word).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nM: Thank you for choosing \\[store name\\]! I am arceuspatronus. How can I help you today?\n\nC: Why is there no delivery policy?\n\nAlright, straight to the point. That certainly saved me some time. After getting the customer's area and confirming that the product they were interested in was a used product (because we got paid by chat window and if we didn't reach a certain amount of back-and-forth, we wouldn't get paid for it even if we spent half an hour there), I proceeded to explain to the customer the policy I mentioned above. You can probably guess where I got my title from.\n\nC (after I explained everything): But why can't you guys deliver to me?\n\nM (thinking I somehow didn't explain everything clearly): I apologize, sir, but as I explained above\u2026 \\[wrote a (self-proclaimed) great ELI5 paragraph\\]\n\nC: But why can't you deliver?\n\nM (slightly irritated now but being behind a keyboard tremendously helped masking it): I'm sorry, sir, but it's the company's policy.\n\nC: Policies are written by people.\n\nNow at this point I was beyond annoyed. What did this guy want me to do? Rewrite the policies for him? We literally couldn't even place an online order for second-hand products to get picked up in-store. I took a deep breath and reminded myself that being rude or even closing the chat would get me in trouble (since even with death threats, we still needed to make the required amount of back-and-forth \\*before\\* saying things like \"If you don't need further assistance, I will be closing the chat now. Have a nice day!\").\n\nM: I'm sorry, sir. Is there anything else I can help you with?\n\nC: Yes. Deliver this product to my house.\n\nOh, is that how you wanna play, Kenny?\n\nM: I'm sorry, sir, but I don't have the ability to connect you to those in charge of making policies.\n\nC: Are you mocking me?\n\nI definitely was, and I was phrasing it in a way that was quite clear to anyone who read the conversation, but if you really wanted to, you could argue that it was a genuine apology and I was just bad at social interactions. I wanted to ask how he managed to mistake someone at the bottom of the hierarchy making minimum wage \\*after\\* bonus for the CEO, but like I said, being outright rude to customers would lead to my immediate termination. I, however, didn't like to lie, so I just ignored the question and tried to give myself an out in case I got in trouble.\n\nM: I'm sorry, sir, but I can only connect you to tech support.

She was wearing a coat three sizes too big, bright red, and it was not even that cold outside. I turn around and she\u2019s crouched down behind the back room door looking at the vape clearance rack. The backroom door is one of those swing doors and not a real one so I just watched her as she did this, oblivious to my presence. When she walks away from the rack I go to the counter. \n\nI see her take a value pack of vapes we had left over for Christmas and walks to the other side of the store with it. We never saw that again. \n\nThen she walks back to the register, presses her body against a end cap and is very loudly opening one of the vapes. It came in this plastic wrap around it so it was extremely loud and she\u2019s less than a foot from my face and I\u2019m making eye contact basically with her as she does this.\n\nShe walks back and forth a bit, and while she\u2019s walking around all of the vapes are in full view in her giant coat pockets.

However because of the nature of the product we have a very strict policy. Absolutely no returns on paint. Unless the employee mixing your paint royally messed up or you have a really, REALLY good reason a store manager will sometimes just return it for them.\n\nQue me in, working the night shift 30 minutes before closing. A lady comes in. I greet them. 10 minutes go by and I just see her wandering the paint section, she looks at the miss tinted section, which is discounted as they've already been mixed and cannot be changed. She's spending a lot of time looking but anytime she walks to a different section she is pacing very quickly, she seemed in a rush or waiting for something. She keeps repeating the process wandering, looking, wandering. At this point I'm wandering is she is just waiting for someone to help, so I call over to here.\n\n\" Do you need someone to mix some paint for you?\"\n\nShe responds \" I'm good, I'm just looking for something real quick I don't care what shade.\"\n\nI don't really know how to respond to that. Knowing the specifics is very important. She didn't say anything else so I guess she wanted to look herself.  I went \" sounds good, if you need help just let me know\"\n\nAfter a bit she comes up with a discounted gallon some paint brushers the whole shebang. I asked if she found the right paint. She beamed \"Yes I did thank you\"\n\nQue next evening, a few hours into my shift she comes back in. I recognized her and she recognized me. Came back in looking to return the paint she got. She says it's an exterior and she wanted interior. I'm silent screaming in my head, I know how this is going to go.\n\n\" Sorry but we cannot return paint once it's been purchased\"\n\nShe gives me that look, I'm sure every cashier knows it, then proceeds to go down the list of excuses.\n\n\" I did not even use it, I just bought yesterday, It's brand new, I just got the wrong one\"\n\nNow personally for discounted paint, since it's already been mixed I believe the return policy should be lighter but I don't make the rules. \" Sorry but we still can not return it\"\n\nShe wants to get a manger, so I call one. All they're going to do is repeat what I just said but with authoritative power. Every retail workers knows this situation. During this process the lady was not shouting or anything she was being very calm but it was on those confident \"You're going to make it happen\" type confident. I've really come to dislike those type of customers, the rules are not going to change for you.\n\nAfter the manager comes and goes through a similar process we reach a dead end. We're not going to return it but she won't leave and just holds up the line. Out of options she goes\n\n\" They saw me purchase it yesterday\"\n\nManger confirms with me. We both know full well that does not matter but at this point we're just trying to make any conversation other then dead silence. \" We still can't return it \"\n\nShe just scoffs \" EVEN though you saw me buy it? \"\n\nAs a final attempt she goes \" I was just in a hurry and got the wrong one I can't exchange it for a different one\"\n\nBoth of us just want this to be over so we can help the other customers stuck in line.

I\u2019m pretty sure that day we also didn\u2019t have many loaders because some people called out or we were just short staffed in general. I was in our garden section and this woman came up and bought a lot of stuff. If I\u2019m remembering correctly, she got some bricks. \n\nShe asked for help loading and I called for that. But the person I talked to over the phone said we had a lot of customers who needed load assistance and it was going to take a few minutes for them to send a loader to my register. I told the customer(with a lot of \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry\u201d)that it would take a few minutes before someone could come to help her. And she said \u201cWell, you need to get someone that can help me sooner\u201d. \n\nIn between me checking out and heading other people, she complained to me, probably thinking I could get someone to show up sooner. She said she couldn\u2019t stay there too long because she had other things to do that day. She had been there for less than five minutes and I said it\u2019d take a few minutes, not a few hours. And then she says \u201cIf I go to customer service, can they get me loading assistance?\u201d. I just didn\u2019t know what to say.

She also complained about how in the past she came to our store and she was always able to get help quickly, ignoring the fact that that day we were really busy. \n\nThankfully, a loader did arrive soon after she said that. If there\u2019s one thing I wish customers would get through their heads, it\u2019s if something is going to take a while, it\u2019s going to take a while and usually there\u2019s nothing we can do about it.

I have a few good stories from my two years there, but this is the biggest one I love to share. \n\nI was a cashier, and most often was supervising the self check. My town isn't huge, so most of the customers would at least recognize me. \n\nIf you worked a certain amount of time, you were required to take an hour lunch break. When we had our lunch break, we fully clocked out, and had no access to anything in the system. We were also told that we were expressly not allowed to do any work tasks or help any customers while on our break. If we did the store could get in huge trouble, and we ourselves could even get fired. \n\nI did different things on my break, but this particular day I had decided to buy a few things for lunch in the store, and then head home to hang out with my mom while I ate, since I lived really close. \n\nI happily procured my miscellaneous goodies, including a treat for my mom, and happily stood in the line at the self check, waiting for a register. I had my work vest with me, but it was off and slung over my shoulder.\n\nWhen I was next in line and a register opened, this lady shoved past me, litteraly knocking a precious pack of beef jerky out of my hands, and beelined over to the open register. I was annoyed, but I didn't want to waste my lunch break and she wasn't worth a confrontation. So I just quietly picked up my jerky, and made my way over to another register, which had opened up litteraly about ten seconds later. \n\nI was just happily and quietly scanning my goodies, when I hear snapping and a loud \"Hey!\" I turn around and find the same woman glaring at me. I blink at her bewildered, before she says \"Hey, I need help over here. I scanned this twice, I need you to take it off.\" I looked over and saw that my coworker, who was actually over the self check, was helping someone else. I look back at Karen and smile and politely say \"Oh, sorry. I'm on lunch break right now, so I can't help you. But coworker should be free to help in just a second.\"\n\nKaren did not like that. She glared at me, before asking. \"Why can't you help me? Your right here?\" I blinked at her and explained that I wasn't clocked in, because I was on my lunch break. I could get in trouble for helping her, and I couldn't really even if I wanted to, because my ID wouldn't work in the system while I was clocked out. \n\nKaren stomps her foot and insists \"That's f'ing stupid!

But she's not having it. This adult woman throws the stuff she was buying on the ground, leaving her cart and everything there, and marches over to the customer service desk when my manager was standing.\n\nKaren then brings my manager over to the self check and loudly exclaims \"Your employee was refusing to help me and being extremely rude!\" As this point I'd finish checking out and was standing by the self check exit. My manager just looks at me and says \"Goblin, are you on the clock?\" I tell her nope, and that I'm just trying to get my lunch and go home. So the third person sternly explains to this woman that I'm not on the clock and I'm not allowed to or able to help her. Instead of going back and getting help from my coworker, she storms out screaming about she's never going to shop there again. Lol okay cool lady. I won't miss you.\n\nIt didn't even stop there. As I was talking to my manager and a few coworkers and explaining what happened, Karen's husband comes in. He goes to Karen's register, finishes checking out and pays, then comes over to us. He then tells me that his wife is in the car sobbing and in severe emotional distress because of how I treated her and embarrassed her, and that \"I hope your real proud of yourself.\"\n\nI just grinned at him and gave him a thumbs up. As he's walking out, my managed tells me I should feel free to take an extra thirty if I wanted. I then happily skipped home, to enjoy my jerky in peace.

Here are some things that made me feel... very puzzled.\n\n1. She came with an enormous bag on herself, that severely limited her movements. When she tried to reach for a document she had on herself, she spent something like two minutes trying to retrieve it, and I honestly have no idea where she pulled it from.\n2. She had to send this document, a birth certificate. She was extremely protective of it, and basically was wary of everything I did regarding this document. She had an envelope with her, for instance, and she wanted to protect it at any cost... despite the envelope being put in our own DHL envelope. She wanted to write the address on the envelope, even though that was useless, since the envelope was inside ours. Also, the envelope has one of those weird sides that you have to wet to make sticky, and she asked us if we had any sponge to do that, as if we were in a 60s post office. When I denied that, she licked her finger, smeared her spit on the side of the envelope and sealed it. She then asked us to seal the envelope even further with scotch tape. When I pulled out the normal tape, she insisted that I use the wide one, the one we use for cardboard. Again, this was all useless.\n3. She was puzzled when I told her that the shipment would take 3 workdays. She claims that it was possible to send documents in 1 day twenty years ago. I suggested that maybe 9\/11 had changed the protocols, so she grudgingly agreed.\n4. She became alarmed when she saw that I had labeled the contents of the shipment 'Documents - general business'. She said: \"No! No one must know that these are business documents!\". Despite the fact that it simply means that the documents are generic, even birthday cards would be labelled this way.\n5. At the end of the shipment, we usually sent the recipt with the tracking number to the e-mail address and the phone number provided by the shipper. I did this, and told her. She grew pale, and muttered: \"I wish you had not done yet. My phone has been stolen, and whoever has stolen it will be able to look at my data. I shall have to go to the Carabinieri (Italian army) and have the phone card locked\". I replied: \"Don't worry, there is just a notice of the shipment, the receipt proper is via e-mail. The phone message only has a tracking number\". She: \"A TRACKING NUMBER!? Are you FUCKING STUPID!? Now that criminal will be able to STEAL MY SHIPMENT!\". Now, that makes no sense. A tracking number only tells you what happened to a shipment. You cannot modify the shipment, nor even know what is being shipped. Still, she said: \"How could you be so FUCKING STUPID!? Now I have thrown away all the money I spent to get this birth certificate. I wish I had never come here\". I replied: \"Next time, I advice you to exert some politeness\". She said: \"It's okay. It is not your fault\". I replied: \"I guess it's my bad genes\".","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1677613995.0},{"title":"That one time the customer was wrong...","author":"blacknwhitedog","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromRetail\/comments\/11dc07d\/that_one_time_the_customer_was_wrong\/","text":"Have just had my memory jogged about this from another post somewhere and it made me smile all over again.  \n\n\nThis was in the early 90's, UK.

TL;DR at the bottom of this gets too long. \n\nFirst, a little background. I work at a furniture retailer (not going to name the store for privacy reasons). Because of some fraud issues we've had recently there has been a policy enacted that we can only accept partial payments for customers over the phone. The average order in our particular store is over $1500 and since it's tax season we always see an influx of fraud cases. It doesn't always sit well with people but it's a corporate thing so we find a way to deal. \n\nAnyways, we had a call from this customer that wanted to buy a bed frame for a guest she was having next week. No big deal. The order was placed, her info was taken, and she agreed to come in person to finish the transaction.\n\nWhen she came in she was very obviously pregnant. She was so far along that we all thought she might actually pop while she was here. Her belly was sitting low and she was ready to go. We had no idea how right we were. \n\nAs the salesperson was flying through the transaction and breakneck speed i figured something was up. Turns out the lady's water broke, she says, on Tuesday (it's now Friday) and she had gone to the hospital today to have the kid. She had called in to get her stuff purchased so it could be ready after her delivery. She said the hospital had even admitted her and before they could get her fully prepped she told them she had to go \"pay for parking\" and left to come in to pay for her furniture. I could see the look on her face that she was rushing to get back there. The transaction finished and she joked that she might even have to have the baby here in the store. Hopefully she got back to the hospital instead of having a backseat birth. \n\nMy mind was blown; still is blown.\n\nTL;DR Pregnant lady came in to buy a bed after leaving the hospital she was admitted to to give birth.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1676684783.0},{"title":"The fastest florist on the freeway!","author":"loCAtek","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromRetail\/comments\/114fi7w\/the_fastest_florist_on_the_freeway\/","text":"This happened on Valentine's Day of course, when everybody and their brother forgot to pick up flowers for their bf\/gf, spouse or mom, on their way home.\n\nFreddy the flower vendor had a five gallon bucket of fancy bouquets on the median island; at the light; next to my fuel station.

This happened a couple of years ago when I worked in retail as a cashier. I was reminded of this because I cried for the first time at my office job today (hopefully my last time too). \n\nThere was a lady who came to my line and she was already in a bad mood. She started complaining about how the people on the floor were no help to her at all in finding what she needed. The whole time I was calm and I just wanted to get her checked out as smoothly as possible. But of course, something went wrong. I wasn't able to scan one of her items up because there was no barcode. Usually what happens is I get a manager, they bring up the barcode on a sheet or they go get the sticker from the display. I'm not allowed to leave the register. I tell the lady reluctantly that I would have to get the manager to ring it up. Thats when she just explodes and says to just forget it. She slams her items down on the counter and says to cancel the transaction. Then she said that shes going to call the store and have me get in trouble for not doing my job, she then leaves. \n\nThere was this huge line, it was around Christmas time. I just start ringing people up like normal. I was in shock for like a good five minutes, like no reaction.  Then suddenly it hit me, and all of a sudden I was struggling to hold back tears. I had never tried so hard in my life to hold back tears because I was surrounded by all these people. But eventually I just couldn't hold it and started crying. Like tears on the counter, can't say a word back because I'll just cry more, full on crying.\n\nAlso what was weird was all these people had seen what happened, and they had seen me crying now. Not one person even mentioned it. I know I shouldn't expect anyone to say anything really, but I've seen other people talking about how they dealt with rude customers and other people might at least throw a sympathetic glance their way. No one in this line cared. It was so weird to have all these people just check out like nothing was happening. I really wanted to just leave and go cry alone, but I had this huge line. Also, one of my managers was standing close by the whole time. I'm still confused if he actually saw what happened or not. I remember once as I was crying we made eye contact and he had this blank look on his face, it was strange. I was trying to call him over without making a scene to ask if I could go in the back, but he didn't get my signals clearly. I guess too much was going on with so many people in the store, and maybe I was being too discrete. I had my break soon and cried during then, and after I was able to come back and work without crying.\n\nAnyways, thats the end of it. It feels kind of bad looking back on it that either no one had any sympathy for me or no one seemed to notice. This mainly applies to my managers, I feel like they should have at least been more aware of what was going on since one was pretty close by to me and there was another fairly close as well.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1676488071.0},{"title":"Ma\u2019am it is not my fault that you lost your receipt","author":"Accomplished_View533","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromRetail\/comments\/1115p2g\/maam_it_is_not_my_fault_that_you_lost_your_receipt\/","text":"It has been eating at me for days, AND I HOPE this lady I delt with reads this post. \n\nFor context: I work at a video-game store, and there are moments where we can\u2019t do returns on certain items, like if a game system gets \u201caccidentally\u201d damaged, or if you opened a new game copy and did not like the game, sorry we can not do the return for the said items\u2026 In short: we the employees are just doing what our bosses are telling us to do. \n\nBut this right here\u2026 took the absolute CAKE for me\n\nA couple of weeks back I was working my usual opening shift, about 2 to 3 hours in everything was running smoothly and calmly.

I was 15 minutes late opening the store this morning.\n\nI was on the phone with help desk 9 times between 10 am and 4:30. Because not only did my main till keep going offline, but my second till kept randomly restarting. I would call tech support and basically be like,\"hey, it's me. It's happened again.\" And they would restart my tills for me. We restated the tills 10 times in an 8 hour period. We essentially ran the shift on one till.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1675661820.0},{"title":"Girl acts inappropriate and has her dad complain","author":"ucdgn","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromRetail\/comments\/10ucb56\/girl_acts_inappropriate_and_has_her_dad_complain\/","text":"This story is from about December 2019. I had quit retail a few years before but I got another retail job just from 2019-2020.\n\nA girl came in. She only looked about 18, she had hot pink hair, was wearing a short dress, and was walking through the store filming herself on her phone. I personally hate when people do that, but it doesn\u2019t break any policies so I can\u2019t stop her.\n\nShe then stopped at an empty register and climbed onto it and started writhing while filming herself, probably for TikTok or something. I got up from my register to tell her \u201cMa\u2019am, that is not appropriate and it\u2019s a hazard on top of that.\u201d and she screamed \u201cGTFO of my way!\u201d. I told her that if she didn\u2019t get off by the time I counted to 3, I\u2019d get the manager, and she remained there. Same stuff with the manager.  She didn\u2019t move until the manager threatened to have security remove her, and then she *literally* ran off. \n\nI thought this was the last of her but in March 2020 right before lockdowns, a man came in to buy dining room chairs. He hadn\u2019t measured the table and got mad at me because I was unable to help him pick chairs that were he right size. His comeback was \u201cyou hate me because you hate my daughter! You\u2019re the same cashier that ***BULLIED*** my daughter!\u201d. He ranted to me about how I was \u201cbullying his daughter\u201d back in December. I explained what actually happened, and that I didn\u2019t know he was her father. He said \u201cshe\u2019s in the pillow aisle!\u201d, he had her with him, but I didn\u2019t see her this time around. \n\nHe then demanded to speak to \u201cthe manager, but not the manager that was bullying my daughter\u201d and told the manager that I should be fired for my repeated \u201cattitude towards customers\u201d that apparently \u201cnobody had back in my day.\u201d\n\nThe manager explained to him and he didn\u2019t like the reply, so he took his phone out and called corporate about the \u201csheer audacity\u201d these employees had and the \u201cabuse he received\u201d, and then walked away saying \u201cI hope you enjoyed your power trip because it just cost all of you your jobs!\u201d. \n\nHe didn\u2019t end up buying anything, but a woman came in just hours later to buy chairs and he was there in the truck (definitely him, he was still wearing the same outfit) as they were being loaded, so she must have been his wife or other daughter. She was nice though, she\u2019d actually measured the table.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1675603237.0},{"title":"I've heard of crying over spilled milk, but...","author":"PrankyButSaintly","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromRetail\/comments\/10tzfnb\/ive_heard_of_crying_over_spilled_milk_but\/","text":"A couple mornings ago I was working the self checkout area at my local retail chain store, when a woman who frankly even LOOKED like a textbook Karen (white, middle aged, haircut in a messy bob, you get the picture) waved me over and held up a bottle of milk that was allegedly \"leaking\". \n\nI say allegedly and I put leaking in quotes because when I took the bottle from her and examined it, I did not see or feel any leaks, nor did I see any spilled milk in the area. Thinking back now, I honestly think it's very likely she felt the condensation on the outside of the bottle and mistook it for leakage. \n\nNevertheless, I took her at her word and offered to void the milk from the transaction for her. She said she still wanted to get it but wanted a non-leaking bottle. I suggested that she finish the transaction and then go into the store to get a different bottle, and then show her receipt and explain the situation if any other employees happen to question it.\n\nShe then tried to insist that *I* go get the replacement milk and bring it to the self checkout for her right that second. Now, we self checkout workers do occasionally go into the store and retrieve items for customers. But, we are only allowed to do this IF:\n\n1. We have enough workers to cover the area while we're away.\n2. We are not too busy.\n\nNeither was the case at that time. We were considerably busy, AND there was only one person other than me covering the area. I told her \"I'm sorry ma'am, I'm not able to leave the area at the moment.\" She replied \"Well find SOMEONE who will! I'm paying for my milk and I'm going to get it!\"\n\nI told her I would see what I could do. I went to my coworker who was also covering the area to double check if she was indeed the only other person over there. She was. I then went to the nearest manager and asked him what I should do. He confirmed that I could not leave the self checkout while I was only one of two people there and that I was correct in my initial suggestion to the woman. \n\nI started walking back over to tell her this, and as soon as she saw me, she piped up \"Well, did you get my milk?! I PAID for it!\" while waving her receipt in my face. I reiterated what my manager told me, and she just gave a disgusted groan, turned around, and started stomping her way back to the dairy section.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1675566705.0},{"title":"Self Check Issues, Apparently I\u2019m Losing My Job","author":"Immediate_Area9178","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromRetail\/comments\/10tkri3\/self_check_issues_apparently_im_losing_my_job\/","text":"I work the self check a lot in the early mornings and I\u2019ll admit, I get these responses fairly often.

They\u2019re actually seasonal fireworks tents, but not like any fireworks tents you've seen before. They\u2019re 4000 square feet of fun, friends, and fireworks, with a touch of crazy thrown in to keep it exciting.\n\n**STORY:** I\u2019ve always had a bit of a twisted sense of humor, and it\u2019s served me well with my business. I\u2019m 100% positive that if I could open up a chain of stores that sold Guns, Liquor, and Fireworks I would have more money than Elon Musk. No idea what my logo would be, but I would have a hell of a good time designing it.\n\nSome friends of mine have a popular podcast that I\u2019ve listened to and advertised on since its inception many years ago. We always have a ball with our promotions for their listeners, and a few years ago we came up with a logo and design for a \u201cBye Bye Fingers\u201d promotion. I had shirts and cups printed up with the logo and it\u2019s still one of our most popular designs. The shirts are long gone, except for the ones owned by the staff, but we reprinted the cups and still give them away to this day.\n\nAs you can imagine, not everyone is thrilled by the joke. I\u2019ve had a few people comment unhappily to me about the logo, but they\u2019re by far in the minority. I once had a lady storm up to me to complain loudly about one of our staff wearing the shirt. I explained that it was a fireworks joke made specifically for a small group of our customers, but she wasn\u2019t having it. I thought maybe she had a friend or relative that had lost a finger through an accident, but she made it clear she was just offended on behalf of anyone anywhere who was missing a finger! I\u2019m a patient man, but I think she complained for 10 minutes about how insensitive and offensive it was. Finally, she asked me how I would feel if I had lost a finger in a fireworks accident.\n\nWithout skipping a beat, I told her that missing a finger was a badge of honor for a fireworks salesman, and that I would immediately rename my company \u201cFred\u2019s Four Fingers Fireworks\u201d. I also held down a finger and demonstrated how my commercials would have me waving hello to my customers and that my sales would probably go up at least 30%.\n\nShe didn\u2019t buy any fireworks.\n\nI\u2019ll include a link to the logo in the comments for those interested.\n\nIt's been a while since I've posted, but If you\u2019re interested I've got more stories from my fireworks tent\u00a0[here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromRetail\/search?q=tales+from+a+fireworks+tent&restrict_sr=on).","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1675087783.0},{"title":"Fire extinguisher","author":"teriij","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromRetail\/comments\/10nz0qj\/fire_extinguisher\/","text":"It always amazes me how many people are completely unaware of the environment they are in. \nYears ago I worked at a gas station as a supervisor.

For short background, I had been there for a few years, and even though I was technically just a Sales Associate, I basically had done everything in the building at one point or another, short of being an assistant manager. \n\nBecause of this, I was often depended on to keep the department going all by myself for hours at a time, which is NOT how the garden center is supposed to run. The garden center has its own cash registers, an indoor part within the larger store, a large greenhouse-type room (think the size of a basketball court) which housed those registers, large outdoor furniture sets, grills, lawnmower displays, you get the idea. There's a door by the registers with those theft beepers (I never bothered to learn what they are actually called), which leads to a large fenced in patio outside which housed our flowers. At the fenceline was a gate which led in to the garden center from the parking lot, with another set of the theft beepers. \n\nPer company policy, that fence was the last point I was allowed to try intervening in a possible theft. Once they passed that fence and stepped into the parking lot, my hands were tied. Multiple employees were needed at all times to run smoothly, between running the register, watering flowers, watching the gate, and stocking\/making sales on the floor. When we were shorthanded (which was often), thieves took this opportunity to use my department to be, well, thieves. \n\nThat leads to this story. I was left to cover the department on my own for a short time one day. It was a long time ago, but I believe I actually had help with me, but they were on their break, which meant I had about 20 minutes on my own. This meant being the sales associate for the entire area, as well as being the lone cashier. We had to take customers that had merch from the entire store, so often, there would be consistent customers ringing out, even if the garden section itself had a slow sales day, which basically locked an associate on\/near the register. \n\nI had a couple customers in line I was ringing out, and as I was finishing with one nice lady, I noticed a man walking toward the registers with a large TV in a cart. I knew this was obviously not paid for, because he was not accompanied by an associate to the parking lot, which was our store policy. I asked the man if he had his receipt, and he ignored me and continued walking as if I hadn't said anything. As I was handing the receipt to the nice lady, I said much louder, almost shouting \n\n_\"Sir, do you have a receipt for that??\"_ He didn't turn around, but yelled \"It's in my car, I'm going to get it!\" and said that without even slowing his walk. I darted from behind the register out the door to the patio behind him (the theft beepers went off, of course). I got next to him just before he reached the fence and, still playing dumb, asked him for his receipt a third time. He now added to his story \"I was coming to return the TV but I left the receipt in my car.\" \n\nI knew that was bullcrap, because there would be no reason for him to walk in the front door, go to customer service, realize he didn't have his receipt, _then_ walk around the building to go out the garden door, when he would've already been at customer service, right next to the front door. Additionally, he also would've been asked to leave the TV at customer service while going to the get the receipt, to avoid this entire interaction we were having already. \n\nI placed my hand on the cart and kindly suggested that I could hold the TV in garden for him, so he could get the receipt, but he pulled the cart away and said \"no thanks, I got it\" and quickly rolled into the parking lot, out of my jurisdiction. This was the first time I had tried to confront a thief myself, and I had done it completely by the book, but I still had anxiety and blood pressure through the roof because of how terrible I am at confrontations. I just stared at him riding the cart into the parking lot for a few seconds, my mind and body shaking both in a haze, in anger, frustration, disbelief etc. \n\nThe nice lady I had just finished ringing out, whom I had completely forgotten about even though it had only been about 15 seconds tops, came up next to me, and praised me for doing a good job in noticing the man, assured me I did everything I could, and then proceeded into the parking lot behind the man to get his license plate. The man who was behind her in line, who I hadn't taken care of yet, came up as well, said he was an off duty fireman (not sure how that was relevant, but he was nice anyway), and said if he needed to stay behind as a witness he would. I thanked him, and we proceeded back to the registers in the greenhouse to get him rung out, and so I could call a manager to inform them of the theft. \n\nSuper conveniently, one of the CSM's (customer service manager) came strolling into the greenhouse (slight sarcasm, because it actually _was_ convenient he was there, but I would've preferred he was in there 60 seconds earlier). I and the fireman informed him of what had literally just happened before he walked through the door, when we all stopped, because we heard screeching tires, followed by a police siren. Unbeknownst to me, a police officer was in the parking lot, and witnessed my entire interaction with the man at the gate, and the nice lady going to get his plate. \n\nWe looked back towards the front, and saw a bright red Mercedes CLS peeling out from the parking lot, driving back toward us, then along the side driveway of the garden center toward the automotive center at the back of the building, parallel with the sidestreet. Most of the stores from my company have a parking lot that is completely paved over surrounding the entire building, so a car could circle the building if they got lost, or whatever. Ours wasn't like that, however. Beyond that automotive center was a tall grass bank dead end. The police officer, knowing the Mercedes had just trapped himself, smartly just blocked the entrance at the front a few feet from us, right at the front corner of the garden center fence. \n\nOr so we thought. \n\nWhile looking at the cop car, we all heard a loud crash, and turning our heads back toward automotive, saw the taillights of the Mercedes disappearing over the other side of that bank (probably ~10 foot tall hill) onto the main road, a bona fide Dukes of Hazzard flight, with part of his front bumper still crushed against the curb he just hopped in the parking lot. The officer took off (through the actual exit, not the fictional one the Mercedes just made up) down the road after him, and that was the end of that. For now. \n\nI was very glad we (manager included) all saw that, because that was probably the coolest thing I've ever seen, and I don't know how many people would've believed it if I was stuck in my department alone. Just then my co-worker came back from his break, and I broke out laughing because of how he had just barely missed that entire thing. \n\nThe nice lady came back in, absolutely furious, because the guy had almost ran her over while she was trying to get the license plate. The manager took her and the fireman in for a statement, and I went to my (now much needed) break. The manager called for a door greeter to be added for the rest of the shift (what should've been normal practice all day anyway), so he wasn't left alone while I was on break. \n\nI finished my shift, did a little shopping, and while leaving the store, noticed the front end assistant manager talking with a couple police officers. Between them, was a shopping cart with that exact TV in it. I felt satisfied they caught the guy (my assumption) and left work with an amazing story. \n\nBut that wasn't all. \n\nThat assistant manager caught me about a week later and pulled me aside, and praised me for how I handled the entire situation. He and the police had gone through every camera and saw everything, from his grabbing the TV in electronics, wandering different places through the store to look casual, to the interaction in the garden center. He told me I did everything right and by the book. He then informed me of what happened after I saw the Dukes of Hazzard in front of my eyes. \n\nHe led police on a chase through two cities, and eventually ditched the car (TV still inside) at a car dealership. He ran into the dealership and tried to steal a car from them, but was unsuccessful. Eventually, he fled on foot, and disappeared, leaving the car and TV. The point I had seen him talking with the police, was after they recovered the TV from that car and returned it, but the man hadn't been caught. \n\nPolice decided to leave the car where the man had left it, in the parking lot at that dealership, and set up a sting. That night after he left it, he tried to sneak back into the dealership to get the car back out, and as soon as he tried to get in, was surrounded by police and arrested. \n\n_Shockingly,_ it wasn't his car in the first place \/s. It belonged to an acquaintance of his, who was in jail at the time of the TV incident. \n\nSo, I don't know how many charges the guy got, between grand theft auto, theft from the store, damaging property, trying to steal ANOTHER car, sending police on a high speed chase across the county, etc. \n\nBut, I'd like to think that me doing the right thing and trying to stop him, was the catalyst that led to him getting caught, because he would've otherwise left the building quietly and consequence free. \n\nBut DAMN. All that just for a TV.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1673939874.0},{"title":"\"sir, i'm gonna say this in the nicest way possible but...WHAT?\"","author":"herequeerandgreat","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromRetail\/comments\/10du8c5\/sir_im_gonna_say_this_in_the_nicest_way_possible\/","text":" a couple days ago, i was working my retail job, facing the groceries in the aisle. i was on the ground, doing my thing and minding my own business, when a relatively old gentleman with a cart came up to me and asked \"do you know where i can find the wafer cookies?\"\n\nnow, for reference, most of our sweets are located in the frozen aisle. i have informed many customers of this fact and, more often then not, they managed to find what they were looking for. and what luck for this gentleman! the frozen aisle was right next to the aisle i was currently working. so, i said \"in the frozen aisle sir\".\n\nnow, i expected him to say thank you and go to the frozen aisle to collect his sugary treats. however, he didn't say thank you. instead, what he said next left me dumbfounded for one of the very few times in my life.\n\n\"that's too far. can you please tell me somewhere else?\"\n\nuh...WHAT?\n\ni don't know what he was expecting me to say. we have certain products in certain aisles and we have most of our sweets in the frozen aisle. not to mention, i knew what i was talking about since I've seen the wafer cookies in the frozen aisle on numerous occasions.\n\nand don't even get me started on his whole \"that's too far\" thing. it's the next aisle over. it only takes a few seconds to walk to the next aisle over(granted, probably slightly longer if you're disabled which this gentleman was not).\n\nhowever, i decided to give the gentleman the benefit of the doubt and assume he thought i was talking about the era where we keep the meats and cheeses, which is slightly cooled but not frozen. so, i said \"the next aisle over\". he then said \"you're not getting it\" and walked away. under my breath, i said \"well fuck you to\" and just went back to work.\n\ni'm still wondering what the hell that was about.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1673907381.0},{"title":"Call 911","author":"jel_13","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromRetail\/comments\/10df5xr\/call_911\/","text":"I worked in a pharmacy\/retail store.

Inexpensive! Fun For The Whole Family.\" The Knight of the realm, our Retail Worker we shall call NanerMelon (because tis I), already knew of this contraption because one of the lazy dukes in his area of protection wouldn't shut up about it.  \n\n\nKnight NanerMelon was prepared for war, he had experience with the vile \\*BLACK FRIDAY\\*, the harvest from whence demons unleash their unending rage upon innocent protectors of the land. Unfortunately, what the Knight and the rest of kingdom did not know is that the powers that be, the Gods of Nintendo, only gave all the kingdoms of the West very little Wiis, something about false scarcity making these demons unleash their rage even more upon Knight NanerMelon's fellow knights.  \n\n\nTwas such a day of selling the Wiis when the only ten that were given to his kingdom, ran dry as he sold the last one for the day, protecting his realm using logic, reasoning, and his excellent customer service skills; he was content...until **THE DUCHESS** came into his store.  \n\n\nThe reason I say Duchess? The woman in the tale was reasonably dressed, twas obvious the clothing that adorned her was from another kingdom known only as JC Penney (reason the knight knew was because he went shopping with his mother at the mall and saw the same blouse upon the bazaar shelves); this may sound like an irrelevant but it will make sense later.  \n\n\nThe Duchess had a youngling in tow, one with tears upon the poor little girl's cheeks; it was obvious the little one had been crying. The Duchess, looking desperate, asked Knight NanerMelon: \"Forsooth good knight, please give me positive correspondence that you have the Wii! I have been to many a bazaar and they too have been sold out!\"  \n\n\nThe Knight was saddened, he knew the poor little girl was most likely begging for such a thing, he hated what he had to say next.  \n\n\n\"I shan't, dear lady, for you can look upon the farmland set up for the Wii; it is barren for which we sold our last one to someone earlier; I apologize madam\" Knight NanerMelon bowed, showing respect and tact.  \n\n\nThe Duchess stood **FURIOUS**, the veins in her neck popped out of her neck, and the anger was like a miasma emanating from her.  \n\n\n\"Well, can't you go to the back and make one!?\" She shrieked angrily.  \n\n\nThe Knight, ill-prepared for such a strike to his logic, was taken aback: \"I-I'm sorry madam, but we don't make them here?\"  \nThe duchess snarled: \"Then you just ruined Yule for my daughter!\" She yanks the hand of her poor youngling, and like a fart in the wind, floated off into nothingness.  \n\n\nNanerMelon was confused, did this woman believe that the Knight could fabricate such a complicated item in the back? Does she believe seamstresses live below the JC Penney, sewing her blouse?  \n\n\nThis was merely one of the many stories of the Handsome Knight and the many tribulations he had to encounter.","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1673873848.0},{"title":"I Can't use Brand X, and glass eyes","author":"CobaltBlue4","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromRetail\/comments\/10dbs18\/i_cant_use_brand_x_and_glass_eyes\/","text":"I work at the grocery store known for blue vests and pajama wearing customers, as one of the people who unload trucks then stock the items so luckily for me I spend half my day in a loud, dirty, slightly dangerous back room.

Either way, he was giving the gas station patrons and I, an unobstructed view of his hairy ass, since his pants were sagging down below his butt.     Lovely.\n\nInside, the gal who's shift I was relieving said, he'd been there for hours; he'd try to come in the  convenience store a few times, but she'd tell him to leave because he wasn't buying anything  ...plus he smelled.       However, he wouldn't leave the premises, I think maybe because it was raining.

They\u2019re actually seasonal fireworks tents, but not like any fireworks tents you've seen before. They\u2019re 4000 square feet of fun, friends, and fireworks, with a touch of crazy thrown in to keep it exciting.\n\n**STORY:** Every year, I get a couple of credit card chargebacks after the 4th of July and New Year\u2019s Eve. I research the chargebacks and accept or dispute as necessary. Sometimes I find an obvious error on our part, like where a transaction was submitted twice in a row so the customer was double charged. If it was our fault, I\u2019ll accept the chargeback and move on. Every now and then, I\u2019ll come across one that I just can\u2019t figure out.\n\nLast year after the 4th of July, I had a chargeback for more than $800 where \u201cRobert\u201d claimed fraud. He claimed that the purchase should have been just over $80, but that we had mischarged him. Unfortunately for him, I switched to integrated POS systems years ago, and was able to pull up his receipt with all of the items in his purchase. I responded to the credit card company with a copy of the detailed receipt. This went back and forth, with the credit card holder eventually claiming that he had paid for the large purchase in cash, and had just gotten a few more items with his credit card. Sadly, but not shockingly, the CC company found in his favor and the charge was reversed.\n\nI was pissed off, but it\u2019s not the first time it\u2019s happened to me. As I was filing the information and reviewing my dispute files, I noticed that I had a dispute from someone with the same name from the year before. Sure enough, it was the same card number used as well. Now I was REALLY pissed off. I understand that we occasionally make mistakes, but this guy was straight up scamming me for free fireworks. I made a note of the name and credit card number and made copies of all of my documentation.\n\nWhen New Year\u2019s Eve rolled around this year, I made sure that all of my cashiers were double checking ID\u2019s and on the lookout for the jerk. Sure enough, guess who tried to buy a cart full of fireworks on New Year\u2019s Eve! My cashier had caught it just after he had inserted his card for payment, so she quickly cancelled the transaction and acted like she was having an issue with the terminal.\n\nI walked over with my best smile and apologized for the issue. I asked to see his credit card and his ID so that I could verify it was him. I then let him know that due to prior fraud with that card, we were firing him as a customer, and that he was no longer welcome at any of my locations. He blew a gasket! He immediately started yelling and cursing at me and my cashier. Bad move dude. I waved over the off-duty police officer I hire for security and explained the situation to him. He happily removed the still yelling former customer as my cashiers and I took turns high fiving just to rub it in.\n\nIt's been a while since I've posted, but If you\u2019re interested I've got more stories from my fireworks tent [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromRetail\/search?q=tales+from+a+fireworks+tent&restrict_sr=on).","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1673792870.0},{"title":"Money lost in translation","author":"loCAtek","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromRetail\/comments\/10ap3o3\/money_lost_in_translation\/","text":"Yesterday was pretty busy at the gas station food mart; lots of cigarettes to be sold; snacks, scratchers and of course, gas.

It was actually the reason I quit, and if I knew it was gonna make me quit, I would\u2019ve responded very differently. Anyways, where I worked, we have maybe 20 employees total, and the closing shift was given about 4 employees.  I was main cashier, taking on the line full force. There were three other employees, a manager and two stockers. One of the stockers was my backup. We were getting really close to the end of the night, we closed in about an hour from the time this happened. My backup was extremely busy. During the day, very little was done, so he was trying to get out anything and everything to make sure the shelves were properly stocked. I was in the flow and finally looked up to see my line was about 15 people long. I\u2019m supposed to call for backup after 3 people. So I call, and tell some people to head over to another register. This is when time slows down for me. My backup took about 5 minutes to get to the register, it felt like 15. Probably because my customer had just handed me a handful of change, around $7 worth. I started counting it, she helped a bit, and I was totally ignoring everyone except for this lady when I hear \u201cIs someone coming over or what?\u201d It was an older lady. I responded with \u201cYes, someone is coming. He\u2019s busy, please give him a moment.\u201d I called for backup again, and continued counting. A few seconds later, a man goes, \u201cWell? She\u2019s waiting for you to answer her.\u201d I responded with, \u201cWell, sir, I already responded to her. Someone\u2019s coming.\u201d\nI finished counting the change, and my backup and I cleared the line pretty fast. But when it got to the man who told me the lady was waiting, he decided to be not-so-kind. \nI begin ringing him out, and the first thing he said to me was, \u201cSo, what\u2019s wrong with you people?\u201d Immediately, I\u2019m annoyed. Most customers don\u2019t talk to me as I\u2019m really fast and finish their order before we can really talk. So, I say, \u201cWhat do you mean, sir?\u201d To which he replies, \u201cWell, clearly you all suck at your jobs, and you don\u2019t have nearly enough employees. What\u2019s wrong with this place? When are you going to get your act together?\u201d I replied with, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re trying to say. It\u2019s late, and we\u2019re extremely busy. My backup was clearly very busy and couldn\u2019t get up here immediately. Here\u2019s your receipt, have a wonderful evening.\u201d And I smiled at him.

checkout?","author":"D_bunny_V","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromRetail\/comments\/107qs6s\/cant_use_self_checkout\/","text":"I was working today as the cashier in a well known popular store, since the big seasonal Christmas holiday is over a lot of stuff has cooled down including work hours.\n\nI was the only one on cash because having so many people working on the cash registers on a slow day makes no sense, me being the main worker on front its my job to make sure things stay cleaned and fully stocked while helping customers.\n\nLuckily our location has a few self checkout stations which allow the cashier to work around the front and make sure everything's fine and tidy, this comes in handy when it's a particularly slow day like today.\n\nI do understand the inconvenience and not wanting to use a self checkout, some people have more troubles than others and some aren't able to use them cause they want to pay cash only, our self checkouts have a cash option which isn't usually an option at most stores.\n\nThis happened early in the morning, keep in mind this is also a Monday, I was working the front and had just finished dealing with a small lineup of people which my manager had noticed and helped out a little, afterwards  I was told to try and not get caught behind the counter so I can work the whole front of the store.\n\nWith that, I start directing customers to try and use the self checkout as much as possible, occasionally I'll get people who pay with gift cards or even wish to purchase gift cards so I help them at the counter.\n\nAfter a while of helping people out the checkouts were completely empty so I start working around and stocking shelving, it took maybe 5 or so minutes when I see a blonde lady standing at the front and looking around.\n\nI asked if everything was okay and if she needed help looking for anything. \"I'm just waiting to check out\" I smiled and gestured to the self checkouts repeating the line I was told to tell the customers when the front was empty with no other customers.\n\n\"If you could use the self checkouts that would be great, they do take cash as well as credit and debit, if your paying with a gift card then I'll be with you soon\" I waited for a second but she just shook her head.\n\n\"No thank you I want to checkout at the front please\" she said it in one of those passive aggressive tones while pointing to one of the cash registers, I just smiled and asked if she was paying with a gift card, she sighed and shook her head again.\n\n\"No I'm paying with debit card\" I then gestured again to the self checkouts, mentioning that if she could it would be appreciated, she just started walking to nearest counter saying I should be wanting to help her.\n\nAs I started walking up another girl approached, I asked how she would be paying and she said debit, I asked if she could use the self checkout and how it would be greatly appreciated, she said she could but she was gonna buy a gift card, so I nodded and said I could help her at the front.\n\nThe blonde lady that was still standing there said I shouldn't treat them as an inconvenience and tell them to use the self checkouts and that I should be wanting to help them at the counters, obviously I was a little offended at her words but grinned and barred it.\n\nI of course said that she was not an inconvenience, it was just more convenient and helpful if customers could use the self checkouts so that workers could focus on other duties as well that had to be done if there was no one in line.\n\n\"No you're treating us as an inconvenience and being rude by telling us to use the self checkouts, you should be thankful, I'm giving you work so you have a job, you should hate those things because they take away your job\"\n\nI just stopped talking and continued my work, she asked for an eco bag for her few items and by the time I was done ringing up her order she was still overly passive aggressive, by the time she was done I was just trying not to snap at her and just be overly sweet to make her feel bad for being rude. \n\n\"Have a lovely day\" she just grabbed her bag and scoffed \"have a lovely day, yeah, Karmas gonna give you what you deserve\"\n\nI just smiled and wished her a good day again, when she left the girl behind her just said she couldn't believe the nerve of her and that she was such a Karen, I couldn't help but agree.\n\nTo those that think using self checkout takes away our jobs, it actually helps us by allowing to do more of our job, it also helps us greatly during the busy holidays, it allows people to checkout faster without the need of waiting for us and waiting in line forever for people with big carts.\n\nAt the end of the day, just please use self checkout when you can, it makes everything easier for everyone.\n\n\nEdit: it's not specifically a employee thing, it's an everyone thing, my manager specifically tells us to use certain phrases, direct the customer to self checkouts as much as possible and to not get stuck behind the counter.\n\nas much as I love to help people behind the counter and converse and other things, I get yelled at or reprimanded for staying behind it when there no one there or it's slow, since it was just her I asked the one time then went to the front since she walked over and insisted, afterwards she went on her rant so I just complied as much as possible.","upvote_ratio":0.76,"created_utc":1673300065.0},{"title":"Customer completely ignored my existence, and made my job more

years.  For some unknown reason we got SLAMMED, pretty much equivalent to before Thanksgiving.  Endless lines, customers needing help on the floor constantly, etc.  \n\nI was cashiering,  which I hate doing as it is but this rush was just stressing me out. One hour felt like 5. I couldn't even take a drink of water.\n\nI'm not one of those people that gets ticked off if someone is on their phone, or not being chatty, I don't care. All I ask is if you're checking out then be checking out. Don't have me start and then realize you have other shopping to do and be gone forever.  And don't be so wrapped up in your phone call that you're not paying attention and I have to interrupt you.  \n\nSo I  had a customer she ran into someone she knew the next line over. I could hear them talking when I was ringing the customers ahead of her. I finally get to her, she doesn't move, she's so wrapped up in her conversation she doesn't even acknowledge it's her turn.  Other customers are looking back and forth at them.\n\nIt wasn't like I could just take the customer behind her because our lanes are narrow.  So I walk out and grab her cart (we unload the carts). A minute or 2 later she takes the 2 steps forward.  I say hello to be polite.  Her and her friend are still lost in conversation she either didn't hear me or ignored me, whatever.  Other people are still looking back and fourth between them. With a look like \"seriously?\".\n\nNow while I was  emptying her cart I noticed she had reusable bags.  I already started bagging her stuff in paper and thought \"well it wasn't important enough for her to pause her conversation for 2 seconds and tell me.  Too bad she gets our bags now.\"\n\nI finally finish and tell her her total.  She looks at me confused and says \"what?\" So I repeat it.  She puts her card in and returns to talking.  She's so oblivious that she doesn't hear the card reader going off telling her to remove her card. I tell her and she says \"oh\". \n\nFinally put her bagged groceries in her cart give her her receipt and assume she'll move. \n\nNOPE. She stands there and keeps talking to her friend getting in other customers way. Then her friend finishes and they stand in the walkway talking, getting in everyone's way. \n\nSomeone later told me two people were blocking the door. I assumed it was her. \n\nUsually stuff like this doesn't get to me but it's like how self absorbed can you be?

Every Wednesday, a little old German couple would stop at the Desk and ask me \"Do you want to work?\"  (heavy emphasis placed on the word *work*) - meaning would I cash them out?  Despite it looking like I didn't do much, I had to pull and sort all accordians from 14 registers (containing all coupons, credit and debit slips, et c.) process all the WIC vouchers, take in tills and count them and set them up for the next morning, count the change drawer, and re-set it to the opening configuration.  All this in addition to:  answering a multi-line phone, making all PA announcements, processing returns, selling lottery, doing bill payments and sending money via Moneygram, giving people directions to where things in the store were located, listening to and attempting to resolve customer complaints, summoning managers, and answering hundreds of questions each night.  And after the desk closes, there is still more work to do!  Counting lottery tickets, cash sweeping registers one last time before we close the store, balancing the cash sweep, cash drops, balancing the safe, and waiting for the closing manager to check everything before clocking out.  We were also the only real grocery store for a 50 to 60 mile radius, so we were always hella busy.\n\nSo, I resent the implication that I stand around all night and do nothing.\n\nWednesday night again, the old couple strolls up and the wife asks, \"So, do you want to *work*?\"\n\nIt's been a bad day.

So, yes, I *do* want to work, and in fact, I *am* working.  Now, would you like me to cash you out?\"\n\nIt took her a few seconds to remember how to close her mouth, and then she managed a weak \"Yes.\"\n\nTen minutes later, manager moseys on by and asks what I had said to them.

Once you earn 200 points, you get a $5 off coupon to use on a future purchase. At 300, if you save your points, it increases to $10 off. At 1000 points, you get $50 off. You get the picture. When someone is checking out, we ask them if they are part of the rewards program. If they have a coupon they can use, we are able to see this coupon and ask if they want to use it or keep saving points. This is one of two discounts we can apply based on what we see on the account.\n\n2. The second kind of discount we can apply- we have 10-15% off for people who meet certain criteria - first responders get 15%, dog walkers get 10%, and - this is the relevant one - people who live in certain buildings that surround the store get 10% off certain items. We don\u2019t verify any of this; anyone could come in and, for example, tell us they live in a nearby condo building and we\u2019d be like \u201cok cool!\u201d and make a note on their account that they get this specific discount. The notes we make are very obvious and impossible to miss. I especially tend to be pretty generous with discounts because it\u2019s not MY money, lol. \n\n3. Our rewards program sends out text messages periodically. They\u2019ll say something like \u201c$10% off (specific product), today only, in-store and online!\u201d or \u201cEarn double points this weekend, in-store only!\u201d They discount ones ALWAYS have a promo code attached that you have to provide. The messages NEVER say, like, \u201chere\u2019s a code for 10% off your whole order, whenever you want!\u201d They\u2019re always for specific days. The retail associates\/anyone working in the stores have no control over\/input on these texts. We just enter promo codes and apply discounts accordingly.\n\n4. Not super relevant, but to live in this area, you have to be wealthy. Like extremely well-off. It\u2019s in the downtown area of a busy American city. All the residential development has occurred in the last 5-10 years; it used to be very industrial. Cost of living and gentrification are through the roof. All the buildings around us are brand new luxury high-rises. I will never in my life be able to afford living here. None of these people actually NEED a discount.\n\nOk, the story. It\u2019s super busy, the Sunday before Christmas, and I\u2019m at the register checking out a lady who is with what I assume is her mother. The Lady was young, in her mid-20s probably, and as you read this please give the least charitable reading possible; she was very annoyed and condescending. I get her account brought up and I ring everything up. She has 146 points, so no discount yet. It comes to about $89. \n\nLady: \u201cAre their any discount on my account?\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cNot yet! You don\u2019t have enough points right now, but next time you come in you\u2019ll have $5 off.\u201d\n\nLady: \u201cWhat? I\u2019m positive I have a coupon on my account. You guys send me text messages all the time.\u201d\n\nMe (ignoring the text message comment because I can tell she doesn\u2019t have any idea what she\u2019s asking for): \u201cSo, you need 200 points to get the first coupon. Right now, you have 146 points.\u201d (I turn the screen around so she can see exactly what I\u2019m referring to) \u201cYou need 54 more points to get a discount, so next time you\u2019ll have one.\u201d\n\nLady (again): \u201cBut isn\u2019t there a discount? You guys send me text messages ALL the time.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cThere will usually be a code for a discount- do you have the text messages with you?\u201d (knowing very well there are no specific discounts for today or this weekend)\n\nLady: (halfheartedly thumbs her phone screen) \u201cI don\u2019t know, I probably deleted them.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cSo the text messages will usually be for a specific kind of item on a specific day, and will have a promo code attached. I don\u2019t know of any promos going on today, and I can\u2019t give a discount without a promo code.\u201d (Technically I can, but\u2026.I\u2019m not rewarding this kind of behavior for no reason)\n\nLady: (to her mother but loudly) \u201cThis sucks. It\u2019s almost $100 and I don\u2019t have a discount. I thought I had a discount.\u201d \n\nMe: \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that. If you\u2019d still like to buy this, the total is $89.\u201d\n\nLady: \u201cI can\u2019t believe this. This sucks. I don\u2019t have ANY discounts\u201d\n\nPause; I can only assume she\u2019s waiting for me to just give her a fucking discount to make her happy. I\u2019ve been in retail\/food service my whole life, and a younger me would have absolutely panicked. I didn\u2019t budge, I just gave her an apologetic smile and a shrug. She eventually pulls out her card and pays. The transaction is complete and I ask if she wants a receipt.\n\nLady: \u201cBut I\u2019m a resident in (specific building). Don\u2019t I get a discount?! Isn\u2019t it on my account?!\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cI\u2026.I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t see that anywhere on your account. I can add it right now so you get the discount next time, but the only way I can apply it to this transaction is if I void it and then ring everything up all over again.\u201d\n\nLady: (You can tell she\u2019s furious because now she can actually blame something on US) \u201cIt wasn\u2019t on my account?! Fine. No. That\u2019s ok.\u201d\n\nAs she\u2019s leaving she\u2019s still saying, LOUDLY, \u201cThis sucks. I can\u2019t believe it. I spent all that money and didn\u2019t even get a discount.

Of course when we do that we would need to close two aisles (one being where the product is, the other being the adjacent one; where in the event of something being pushed or pulled by accident when grabbing a overhead product, no one gets hurt or injured from something falling.) Obviously we don\u2019t want customers passing or opening the gates because we want customers to be safe. Unfortunately some dinguses didn\u2019t think that rule applies to them and thought to be untouchable.\n\nA co-worker in a forklift and I were in the tile isle helping an older couple (sweet people) get some tile and it turned out the remaining tile they needed was on the overhead. So as my cw got the lift in position I went to close the other aisle to the right (our carpeting) and see a group of six people looking at rollaway carpet. Naturally we can\u2019t close an aisle when there are people still shopping so I ask if they needed help and let them know we were going to be closing the aisle soon. \n\nThey proceed to stay in that aisle for 10 minutes\u2026just looking at the rolled carpet (which mind you we only had 5 different kinds with varying colors and cuts on display so there wasn\u2019t much to choose from) and talking about God knows what. The older lady needing the tile realized they were holding up the aisle and was waiting at the other end of the aisle looking at them with her arms crossed. Even though she was wearing shades I could tell she was staring daggers at them. \n\nFinally what seemed like an eternity the group leaves and I rush to get both gates closed and latched to the shelfs. My cw was bringing the pallet of tile down as I was watching the gates on the carpeting side. As I was looking at other aisles to see if anyone was looking into our flooring aisle and if I had to tell customers we will be opening it shortly, I turned to see two guys (early 20s) from the group before on the other side UNLATCH THE GATE OPPOSITE OF ME\u2026OPEN IT\u2026AND PROCEED TO WALK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE AISLE.\n\nI quickly called for the forklift to stop and I called out to the guys:\n\u201cHey! This aisle is blocked off right now! We are getting a pallet down that could push something over here!\u201d \n\nOne of the Einsteins looked at me and said:\n\u201cWe are just getting some tape.\u201d\n\nTape\u2026You guys risked having a heavy pallet avalanche turn you guys to human pancakes\u2026for FREAKING TAPE?! You couldn\u2019t just wait two minutes max?!\n\nI stood there dumbfounded at how impatient and stupid they were. By the time I got out of it they had left and closed the gate back. I told my cw and my floor manager what happened and they were just less than amused as I was.   \n\nMoral of the story: Don\u2019t open closed, do not pass or hazardous gates or signs.

Our store manager was a small middle age lady who overall wasn\u2019t a bad manager, but she had one big problem. She was terrible at dealing with shoplifters. I don\u2019t know what the laws are in other countries and states, but where this took place, workers were not allowed to touch shoplifters or else they could sue our company. According to store policy, for safety reasons, we were not allowed to block or stand in the way of shoplifters. Our store manager regularly yelled at, confronted, harassed, and blocked shoplifters. She had gotten in trouble for it before but she was good at her job and we had no replacements. \n\nNow to the story. \n\nOne morning, it was me, my girlfriend, and the store manager all working in the store. My girlfriend was working the front register, managers are supposed to stay at the front, and I was in the back helping people if they needed something from our back room. At some point, I come out of the back room and find my manager arguing with some woman. They were carrying a large bag which appeared to be empty. This person was a regular shoplifter in the plaza my store was located. So my manager followed her all the way to the back of the store. The shoplifter was telling my manager to stop following her and my manager was saying I'm just here in case you need anything. My manager was constantly about 5-10 feet away from her just cleaning up shelves. This was nothing new so I didn't think much of it. The shoplifter asked for some items from the back which I brought out to her because she hasn't done anything wrong yet and I didn't know she was a regular shoplifter. I was still being nice and cordial with her because that's just how I work. \n\nAfterwards, I convinced her to let me bring the items she asked for to the front for her. We do this to prevent shoplifting by placing the items behind the counter of the register and not bringing it back up until they pay for it. when I get to the front, I begin helping my girlfriend cut the line down and get on the other register. As my manager and the shoplifter approach the front, they are getting more and more aggressive with each other. The shoplifter had began grabbing items off of the shelves and stuffing them into her bag, saying \"now I'll give you a reason to follow me\". My manager is now berating her and slapping items out of her hands on to the floor. The shoplifter is now trying to leave out the front door and my manager is blocking the door 2 feet in front of the shoplifter. My manager tells me to call the cops and so I do. This whole time, I am trying to ignore what is happening and help other people at checkout and my girlfriend is doing the same. At the same time as I am trying to ring people up for their items, I am on the phone with the cops telling them the situation and the description of the shoplifter. \n\nAt some point I look over and the shoplifter had pulled a gun out of her bag and was now pointing it as my managers head. As I relayed this new more terrifying situation to the operator, my manager continued to stand her ground and MOCKED HER GUN saying the gun wasn't real and that she was doing a poor job of threatening her. The operator was asking about descriptions of the gun, it was a small pistol with a sight accessory on the top. The shoplifter then pointed the gun to the floor behind her and shot it, causing everyone to suddenly crouch down. I continued relaying this information to the operator. It was pretty loud, but not as loud as normal firearms and there was little to no flash. So when she brought the gun back to point at my managers head, she STILL didn't believe it was real and was still berating her and blocker her from leaving the store. \n\nA few seconds later, the shoplifter pushed passed my manager and began running down the sidewalk. My manager FOLLOWED HER OUTSIDE and continued to yell at her as she ran away. I explained to the operator the direction she ran and they said they would be there soon. \n\nAt this point I would like to mention that my manager owns many firearms and regularly takes them to a firing ranges.\n\n My manager walked back inside complaining about how the cops were still not here yet. She then said \"people who do that are so funny, like don't you think I can tell it's not real\". To which I pointed at the bullet casing lying on the ground. She picked it up and said \"huh\" and set it on the counter and walked to the office to pull up security camera of all this being caught on tape. \n\nNot too long after, the cops arrived and said that they found someone hiding behind the building behind a dumpster. The cops gave my manager shit for not closing the store immediately as people were still walking in and out. The cops took our statements and information and I was taken in the police car around the back to verify that they got the right person. They also found her bag and gun in nearby bushes. \n\nFor some reason I was calm throughout the whole thing and still was afterwards, but my girlfriend was freaking out and shaking, which is fair. I was glad I was there to help calm her down and hold her. My manager was asking when we could open back up the store and she was told minimum 2 hours. She wanted to open back up immediately. The cops explained to all of us to never block them or confront them, and to always assume it's real just in case. \n\nAnd just like that, we reopened two hours later and my girlfriend and I worked the rest of our shifts like nothing happened. Except for the entire front of the store being covered in and smelling like gunpowder dust.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1671488684.0},{"title":"\u201cThe way you handled the sweatshirt was so rude\u201d","author":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromRetail\/comments\/zpvg6j\/the_way_you_handled_the_sweatshirt_was_so_rude\/","text":"So, apparently, the way I handle clothes is \u201crude.\u201d \n\nA lady and her daughter come in looking for a shirt with skiing.

I've been reading a lot of stories on here of people copping abuse and just taking it, so I figured I'd share a story that has a happy ending for the store.\n\nWorking at a store that has a large online presence, we deal with a lot of customers asking us where parcels are in transit.\n\nWe aren't the courier, so we aren't the people to reach out to if a parcel gets delayed, but customers do it anyway. Customers are more than capable of talking to the couriers themselves, but we still help because it's good customer service.\n\nThis one customer though, he is a huge pain. He watches tracking like a hawk and will call\/email us the instant there's a delay, and he buys a lot of stuff. There's also a problem with every item he purchases, but that's another story.\n\nLast Saturday, he sent us two emails. We are closed weekends, so I didn't see them until Monday morning. The first email was a complaint about a non-issue regarding a previous purchase, so I politely told him it was a non-issue. His second email said his latest parcel is marked as delivered, but he didn't receive it, so he wants us to investigate.\n\nLast time this happened to him, his parcel was at the post office. I had no reason to believe it wasn't at the post office again, plus it was the middle of the Christmas rush and I had two no-shows for staff, so I politely encouraged him to reach out to the courier himself because I didn't have the time to do it for him. He did not like that.\n\nHe replied to my email with \"being busy is not an excuse, you've helped me before you can help me again\".\n\nAll I could think was \"being busy is NOT an excuse? What the fuck?\". I couldn't believe what I read. Before I had a chance to reply though, he called. This is a brief transcript:\n\n\"I don't appreciate being brushed off like that. You guys have helped in the past, there's no reason you can't do it again. Last time, your colleague managed to find my missing parcel-\"\n\n\"Actually, that was me, I remember-\"\n\n\"DON'T interrupt me, it's very rude. As I was saying, refusing to help me is terrible customer service. Also, you never replied to my first email-\"\n\n\"Actually, I di-\"\n\n\"DON'T FUCKING interrupt me, did no one teach you manners?! How da-\"\n\n\"I WILL interrupt you if you make up lies about me, I will not just roll over and let you speak to me this wa-\"\n\n\"You are extremely rude, let me speak to your boss\"\n\n\"Sure\", then I hung up instantly. Then he called back. I knew it was him as we have caller ID, so without even giving him a chance to talk, I pick up the phone, immediately say \"he's busy\", then instantly hung up again.\n\nAfter that, I replied to his email. I told him that being busy IS an excuse, that he has no idea how stressful Christmas is for a retail store, especially when employees don't turn up, and that if he ever spoke to me or anyone like that again, we wouldn't hesitate to terminate the phone call and block his credit cards, which meant he wouldn't be able to shop with us again.\n\nA Christmas miracle happened after that; he apologised. Not only that, he admitted he was wrong about me not replying to his first email, he accepted that it was indeed a non-issue that he shouldn't complain about, then he contacted the courier himself and they resolved his issue for him, without us holding his hand. Turns out a neighbour had his parcel.\n\nI understand being in a confrontation with an angry customer can be scary, and standing up for yourself is hard because it's your job to be polite. The reality of these situations is its usually a middle-aged person yelling at a young person, which is very intimidating, but I hope that people that read this get a little catharsis knowing that sometimes, these people realise their mistakes and have the power to apologise.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1671454404.0},{"title":"Standing up for Newbies","author":"deroberts21","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromRetail\/comments\/zpuakc\/standing_up_for_newbies\/","text":"Work in a regional big box store that has had a great deal of trouble keeping cashiers.

Don't get me wrong, I was cynical but I still tried to be pleasant and helpful to people. \n\nOne coworker, let's call him Greg, was one bad interaction away from going postal.  We usually worked weekends together and overall he was a hard worker, but he would vent non-stop about how much he hated the town, the people, the store, the boss, and anything else.  He would get finished dealing with a customer, they'd no more than leave the store, and he'd loudly yell something like \"yeah, leave, don't come back!  Slip fall and break your spine on the ice you putrid b*tch!\"  He was always coming up with colorful curses for everyone.\n\nOne particularly crummy day we were getting inundated with customers looking for snow shovels.  We'd show them that they walked right by them, as they were on display outside and along the entire 30' wall they walked by to ask us the question.

He screamed out \"you're all ****'n animals!  All of you!  Rahhh!!!\"  He lifted up a bag of dog food over his head, bit it and split it in half, launching dog kibbles all over.  He threw both halves at the nearby end display, knocked over a few shelves, and ran screaming down the center aisle, burst through the doors, and across the parking lot.  Our boss walked over all nonchalant, holding his clipboard, and said \"yeah he's not coming back...\"\n\nExcept, he did come back that night and rearranged the letters on the big display out front near the road to say \"Greg Rules, **** [town]\"  We didn't know until the next day.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1671463302.0},{"title":"I\u2019m young, not a goldfish","author":"caileysops","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromRetail\/comments\/zpj1z0\/im_young_not_a_goldfish\/","text":"So I (19F) was 17 when this all happened.

This was before big box stores began moving into urban areas, so the stores were quite busy. The stores all had different names, and very few people knew they were under the same ownership.\n\nI was the assistant manager of one store. We did not display merchandise on the sidewalk, save for one push reel lawnmower in season. It was placed flat against the wall in the vestibule. It *was* possible that someone could catch their foot on it and fall, but no one ever had. It had been done that way for decades, and no one thought to change it.\n\nUntil one Saturday. There was a crash and a woman cried out. Everyone turned to see a woman in her early sixties sitting on the ground, legs spread out in front of her. Her thirty-year old son, who was standing behind her, started to shout about the idiots who put that there and that we were going to be sorry and he was going to call his lawyer. She refused an ambulance. She swore that she was okay. Her son picked her up and they went on their way.\n\nI don\u2019t remember the details of the following week. Of course, the mower was moved and never placed there again.  The police may have come in to make a report, and I think a letter from a lawyer may have been received.\n\nMy full time position was salaried, but I was allowed to pick up hourly shifts to fill in at other stores on my days off. Therefore on Sunday of the following week I was filling in for the manager of a store across town.\n\nShortly after we opened, a clerk came running to get me, saying that a woman had fallen in an aisle. Again! I thought. This never happens. Now twice in just over a week! I turn the corner, and who do I find sitting on the floor but our friend from the other store. Minus her son. She didn\u2019t recognize me at first. There was nothing on the floor in the aisle to be tripped over.\n\n\u201cHow unfortunate for you, to have fallen twice in one week. Are you okay?\u201d Then she recognized me. Oh no, she said, she was fine and moved to get up. \u201cOh no,\u201d I was right on top of her, \u201cyou need to stay there. Two falls in a week. You need an ambulance to take you to the Emergency Room.\u201d\n\nWhen the clerk had come to get me, two policemen were also in the store having keys copied for their cruiser. They had followed but entered the aisle from the other side. With mock concern, I explained to them how she had fallen in our store across town just over a week ago, but she had refused medical evaluation. This time I had to insist that she gets an ambulance to the ER. Falling twice in one week, there\u2019s no telling what could be wrong. And with mock concern they agreed and called for an ambulance.\n\nFunny, I don\u2019t think we ever heard from her, her son or their layer again.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1671147694.0},{"title":"The Grinch that Stole the Snowblowers","author":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromRetail\/comments\/zmm9tr\/the_grinch_that_stole_the_snowblowers\/","text":"18 years ago, I worked at a small brick and mortar hardware store in the greater Boston area.

I've asked him why and he tells me that it's because there's often so much product. that's true but, more often then not, there are co workers who do it with him so things go smoother and faster then they would if he was just doing it alone. plus, sometimes in work, you gotta do things you don't want to do. the thing is, although he bellyaches about it and makes a point of looking potty while doing it, he's actually not horrible at it. it sometimes takes a bit of help to show him where certain products are placed but, when he is actually there and starts getting into the groove, he's not a bad shelver.\n\non occasions, one of the managers will check in the make sure we're doing ok and offer pointers or help if needed. however, if all is going well, they will compliment us and thank us. one time, after a manager had thanked my co worker for shelving, he told me that he hates when managers compliment him for shelving. i was taken aback because this is the first i've seen of someone being upset at getting a compliment so i asked why. \n\nhe told me this \"if they are taking the time to compliment me on shelving, that means I'm doing a good job. and that means they're going to have me do it again\". first of all, YEAH! of course they'll have you do it again. it's part of your job homiee. secondly, you should try to do well because, if you aren't doing your job well, they'll replace you with someone who can do it right. thirdly, this manager is taking time out of their busy schedule to compliment you. that's gotta feel good. i take that as one of two ways. it could mean that the manager just genuinely appreciates the good work that is being done or they acknowledge that the co worker doesn't like shelving and is letting him know that him soldiering through and doing good regardless of whether or not he like it is not going unnoticed.\n\nhe actually told me that every time he is complimented by a manager on his shelving, \"it takes everything in me not to tell them oh shut up\". that part really took me aback. \n\ni have no intention of telling the managers about this because, as ridiculous as what he said was, he told me in confidence and I'm worried that he would get in trouble if what he said came to light. at best, he'd get a stern talking to. at worst, he'd probably get fired. all i can do is that his fantasy of going off on the manager for complimenting him STAYS a fantasy.","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1670853300.0},{"title":"A tale of The Video Game Karen.","author":"LemonFlavoredMelon","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromRetail\/comments\/zj05q4\/a_tale_of_the_video_game_karen\/","text":"Our tale begins with a devilishly handsome retail worker in a MicroCenter; they had a video games section. Now this handsome retail worker was pretty well versed in games and pop-culture so he was a shoe-in for the job.\n\nIn comes the Anti-Christ of our story. A blue whale-sized hell demon with a bob haircut and the sound of straining high heels clicking on the floor making the sounds of distant thunder. This walking Jupiter looks among the games and she grabs two of them; in a shocking bout of wisdom, she approaches the retail worker and holds up both games asking:\n\n\"Which is best for a ten-year-old boy?\"\n\nThe games in question? GTA 4 (which was new at the time) and Sonic's Sega Collection (Both on PS3) Now what did this retail worker do? Well obviously be a very responsible salesman and tell the eldritch abomination that the Sega Collection was best, waxing poetic about how the retail worker grew up on those games and enjoyed them when he was ten-years-old.\n\nSo the unending maw holds both games and deliberates for roughly 10 minutes. This time deciding to go against the retail worker's best judgement and bought GTA4. The worker thought nothing of it, just the usual when it comes to monsters like this.\n\nBut this is not where the tale ends, oh no no. This honorable knight wasn't prepared for this dragon's fiery breath.\n\nThe next day, our still handsome rogue of a retail worker had a weird feeling, that which felt like Spider-Man's 'Spidey Sense'. There she was when the store opened, the look on her face, the contours of anger upon the make-up caked face upon the Satan spawn; he knew this day would come and was prepared. Oh but he wasn't prepared for what was coming.\n\n\"You sold me a game that had violence, sex, and curse words in it!\" The banshee let out of her facial abyss. The roguish knight was taken aback! He mustered up his courage, looked this dragon in the eye, and said with the most customer-friendly voice:\n\n\"Ma'am, if I recall, I did suggest a better game for your ten-year-old, the Sega Collection?\"\n\nThis was his fatal mistake, using logic against a chaotic being would be his undoing and leave him mentally scared for eternity. The monster reared its ugly head an spewed these words upon the air in which they breathed:\n\n\"Well, maybe you should've been a more assertive salesman and smacked the game out of my hands!\"\n\nThe words pierced the worker's heart; the amount of Stupidity-elemental damage got passed his armor and it was a critical hit to his logic stat; with her screaming for aid from the manager, he told her to leave the store.\n\nTo this day, our handsome retail worker has been wondering of this monster's past, has she had someone smack something out of her hands at a store? Had she read it upon the chiseled stones of Google?\n\nI bring you this story my young one's, as a warning to those in the future; using logic against a Karen will only be your downfall.  \n\n\nEdit: Meant to say PS3, fixed","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1670778877.0},{"title":"...so are they on sale now?","author":"throughalfanoir","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromRetail\/comments\/zi44yq\/so_are_they_on_sale_now\/","text":"I swear Christmas shopping brings people into the store who haven't set foot in a clothing store for months.

I have university-level (but only really just-passing level) of French language knowledge, and sometimes I wonder if people like me with a 2nd language dream if there will ever come a time when we can help out in just the right moment by translating between two strangers.\n\nHowever, my moment to shine was actually a time when I got to translate from my native English.. to English! I listen to a lot of BBC Radio 4 shows, and really enjoy the variety of accents from different celebs in comedy shows there, so I've gotten used to a bunch of the really thick accents, and enjoy picking apart the patterns in each. \n\nBy some stroke of magic, while doing my rounds as a DSD vendor at Small-Shart one day, I came across two ladies who had super thick accents speaking in English to each other, trying to talk to each other, and each becoming increasingly frustrated. One had a really deep accent (from I'm guessing loosely the India region), and another with a very heavy Spanish accent; it seemed like as they got more and more frustrated, the more they defaulted to less enunciation and thus their heavier native accents. The conversation isn't verbatim, just conceptually accurate.\n\nThe broader context is that they are friends and are shopping as an experiment in participating in a mutual errand together, to get to know each other and their preferences better. Their argument is in the sense of a friendly one, not a heated stranger tirade. \n\nSpanish Accent: I just can't understand you! \n\nIndia Accent: I'm not sure what you are saying to me, but I only am trying to tell you which aisle we should go to next! It's nothing to yell about. Why are you yelling?\n\nSpanish: Your accent is SO thick I can only just barely make out one or two words! Speak slower! \n\nIndia: Maybe if we stop yelling, we could sound it out. You speak too fast when you are yelling!\n\nMe: What's the issue here? \n\nSpanish: Can you understand her? She is talking too fast for me to understand.\n\nMe: Sure. It's like a really heavy India accent, but I like it, it's very nice. \n\nIndia: She is yelling so it is tough for me to understand her.\n\nMe: Oh! Well I can understand you both fine. What is it you want to say? (duh, they just told me)\n\nIndia: Will you tell her she is yelling for no reason; I was only trying to say which aisle we should go to next. But she is yelling for some reason and I can't understand her when she is yelling.\n\nSpanish: I need her to speak slower! When she speaks so quickly I can't understand her.\n\nMe (to India): She is confused because you are speaking too fast, and can understand you better when you speak slower. \n\nMe (to Spanish): She is confused about why you are yelling, and can't understand you when you're yelling. She only wanted to say which aisle the both of you should visit next, which isn't something to yell about. \n\nSpanish (yelling): Well why didn't you just say so! \n\nMe: She did, and you're still yelling. (India grins)\n\nSpanish: Oh! Sorry. I have a short temper sometimes I guess (smiling).\n\nIndia (to me, smiling): Thank you!\n\nMe: I'll tell you what. I am trying to learn sign language in order to speak in passing with a deaf guy who works in the back, just to learn a few things to say hello and small chit-chat. One of the words I learned recently is \"slowly\" (and I made the sign for slow, running my right hand over the back of my left hand from knuckles to past my wrist, as if petting it gently). Maybe that could help you two. \n\nSpanish (in a calmer tone): That's not a bad idea. (Spanish grabs India's arm and pets it slowly) \n\nMe: That's not what I meant..\n\nIndia shushes me and waves me off with her other arm, and looks into Spanish's eyes dreamily.\n\nI make my escape to do my rounds. They would later track me down again to ask me what phrase was saying, and explained the broader context.

It's a good way to mess with customers while remaining perfectly professional. I'm there for 8-10 hours walking the same 12 isles doing the same thing day in and day out: I gotta have some amusement.\n\n\"Where are your cables at? I need a cable.\"\n\nAh!

We don't carry the product in question so they wouldn't be in the back.\"\n\n\"Can you just check and see if you have one?\"\n\n\"There is no need for me to.\" I reply.\n\n\"Yes there is because I need one.\"\n\n\"I meant that I know everything we carry and we don't have them. I wish we did. Your best bet to find one is on Amazon as the neither the local best buy nor staples have them either.\" I was trying to save her the trips looking and the mental fortitude of my adjacent colleagues.\n\n\"Well. I still think you should check in the back. Maybe there's one still back there.

I don't believe that's what I said at all. I did say that your best bet was Amazon as none of the locale stores around here carry the product. I'm sorry but that's the best I can do for you.\"\n\nMuch to my surprise she says, \"Well. Thanks anyway.\" and scoots on her way.\n\nI thought I was done.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nAbout 5 minutes later, a coworker who new bugger all about electronics who covered the DVDs comes up to me with the lady in tow.

I already asked him.\"\n\nThe coworker starts in but I hold up my hand, look at the lady, and tell him: \"I have already told her that we don't carry a VGA to HDMI adaptor cable.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" he replied, \"I checked in the back too but if anyone here knows ...\" He let the end of his sentence hang on the air and turned to the lady and informed her once more that we don't have it. He also advised her that she might try staples down the road. \"Or Amazon.\" I chimed in.\n\n\"Yeah,\" he replied, \"Or amazon. That's a good place.\"\n\n\"Okay. Whatever.\" was the ladies reply. And she finally left. Yep. She's finally gone. Hallelujah.\n\nI put my hand on his shoulder and said simply, \"I'm going on my fifteen.\"\n\nThe man grinned and said, \"One of those, then?\"\n\n\"Yeah. You're the third person she asked and you're the second worker to come ask me about.\"\n\n\"Well.\" He replied. \"She's just as thick in the head, huh.\"\n\n\"Yep.\" deep breath, \"Be back in a bit.\"\n\n\"See ya later.\"\n\nI come back out on the floor and as I reach my department, I see a wild co-manager who has just spotted me. \"Ah! good timing!\" he starts to the yet unknown customer, \"If anyone knows where it might be, he will!\" As he walks towards me, the lady scoots around the corner. My previous male coworker is work watching this play out in the background grinning.\n\nMy oblivious co-manager continues, \"This lady is looking for an HDM1 cable. Could you help her?\" he asks.\n\n\"No sir.\" his smile vanishes, \"She's already asked three of us here for a VGA to HDMI converter cable which, as has been told to her three times now, we don't carry. Nor have we in the three years I have worked here. I have put in a request for them back when you asked for that input but we still haven't gotten it.\"\n\nThe lady, to her credit, was now ready to accept my initial answer.\n\n\"Could you,\" my manager asked, \"show me where they would be if we had them?\"\n\nI admit, that flummoxed me a bit. \"Either computer cables, there, or TV entertainment (where they would eventually be stocked a couple years after) on the opposite isle.\" I was forced to walk with my manager at both locations and to the shock of literally no one we couldn't locate the item.\n\nMy manager started telling the lady who now actually wanted to leave by this time that she might have better luck at one of our competitors. I looked her dead i the eye and added the suggestion of buying it off Amazon.\n\n\"Yeah. that's a great idea.\" beamed my manager.\n\nAs she scooted away she told her son (I'm guess based on looks alone) \"Even the manager just took his word!\"\n\nYes, lady, because I'm the guy you ask!\n\nThat was a day I can never forget.

However, some stores (including my job), have their own hours and can open an hour or two later.

I walked away before he could say anything and started packing orders in the back.\n\nHours later, the supervisor that opened with me asked if a man was giving me a problem. I mentioned the guy with three girls and she confirmed it was the same man.

Decent job, whatever. I was in front-end, so I was near customer service, and got a *lot* of customer service questions if I was working near the doors, which I usually was. So one day, probably mid june, this one dude walks in. I'm 6 foot 5 and this guy is taller than me. WAY taller. Probably 7 foot. He's in a 3-piece suit straight out of Mad Men, and has got his hair slicked the hell back with some kind of old school hair grease. He looks like some kind of office exec. He also REEKED of weed. Like he would walk in and the entire store would smell of weed for 5 minutes until it dissipated. \n\nEvery night, 9:30 PM on the dot, he'd come in. He'd audibly go \"Hey, you guys do bank transfers here, right?\" We'd go \"Yeah, but customer service closed at 6, so you can't do any right now, sorry.\" He'd go \"That's cool, man, see ya!\" and then leave. Every. Single. Night. he did this. Without fail. I'd miss a day for whatever reason and I'd come back, and my cashier friends would go \"bank transfer guy was here last night.\" \n\nOne night, probably late August I'm working, and to my surprise he comes in and says the same phrase again. I look at the clock and to my surprise it was 5:55 PM. 5 minutes left for him to do a bank transfer. I'm super weirded out, and I obviously haven't \"rehearsed\" this part, so I just go \"uhh yeah, customer service is open, you can do it there.\" He goes \"hell yeah!\" and then strolls over there and does his bank transfer. 5 minutes goes by, his transfer is done, he silently walks out the door. \n\nWe never saw him again. He spent 2 months of his life walking into a grocery store EVERY night, and then just like that he was gone. That's how he became a *legend* at that store. We couldn't stop talking about him for weeks after he left. Since it was grocery we had a high turnover rate, which meant we ended up telling like 5 new-hires about him, and the word spread. We had managers from other *departments* chatting about him. I left in September of 2021 so I don't know if the legend still keeps up, but I'm assuming some of the older folks working late shift are still chatting about him to this day. \n\nWhat really got me is still his outfit. I'm not lying when I'm saying he looked *good.* Like, pimp good. He was the most formally dressed person I'd seen in 3 months of working there. This was a grocery store in a *bad* part of town, too. We had methheads OD'ing in the parking lot on a weekly basis. Our floor was the only tile floor of this grocery chain in the entire city because of how often we had \"blood spills.\" And here's this guy who's dressed like he should have a butler doing his bank transfers for him. \n\nWe speculated about why he so desperately needed a bank transfer, and why he didn't come earlier. Was it some drug operation? Was he a criminal and was trying to do it on the DL? If so why did he try every night at the same time? We had so many questions that we unfortunately never got the answers to.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1668762444.0},{"title":"I'm not made of money","author":"Gorguf62","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromRetail\/comments\/ytah8g\/im_not_made_of_money\/","text":"At the grocery store I work at, we offer Western Union services.

My place it is was Deliveries, aka get things together for a customer to come up and get at a later date, as well as taking calls for large orders and organizing a truck that would show up every morning and night to take bulk items to delivery sites. The job wasn't great but I went for 3 months without major issue before leaving for a better place.\n\nThe one instance that stands out amongst the three months is not later on but is from the VERY FIRST DAY that I worked there.\n\nA bit of backstory to my first shift: \nAt this company they had an interesting way of training you. Namely they didn't. Oh sure they had us watch a series of videos on safety and general ways to interact with a customer, but there was nothing specific to what I personally would actually be doing. The only training I had was from the guy I was replacing telling me how to use the pda \"phone\" to check what orders needed and how to use the information shown to locate items, that way I didn't have to know off the top of my head where things were. This meant that while my job took me to every aisle and outside to lumber and brick, I didn't ever have to memorize locations, and I certainly was never trained on item locations for customers.\n\nThis leads to my first shift on the floor, where I was way out of my depth but trying my hardest. I was able to get most of my work done without being disrupted, and the few times that customers asked where items were, thinking that since I had a uniform I would surely know, they accepted that I was new and appreciated me directing them to someone who could help them properly.\n\nNot this guy though, not this one guy who had an air of him like all the workers were beneath him.\n\nIt is almost the end of my first shift, and I am happy to be going home. I am up on a ladder getting some items from the overhead storage in an aisle when this man comes up and asks where some specific pool item was (I do not recall which it was now). Of course I did not know, but I did know that earlier in the day I had picked up some pool supplies in the outer yard, not far away from where we were. So of course I tell him \"Sorry I am not sure since I am new, but I believe they are [location], you should check there.\" He proceeds to just stare at me. I ask him if he needs any other assistance, to which he replies that he does not, and asks my name, which I give him, not thinking much of it.

I was incredulous, and all I could stammer out was that it was my first day on the job. He then proceeded to say that that was no excuse and that I was [insert various insults to my intelligence that I won't repeat] and that I should be fired for incompetence. This was my first time in retail, and I was absolutely dumbfounded that people would act like this in public.\n\nIn the end my manager got him to leave, and told me that I shouldn't let it get to me. Clearly it did as I still remember it years later. Don't be that guy, and always treat employees well at retail jobs please.\n\n(Btw the best part was that he already had the item he was looking for when he was yelling, and it turns out the area I indicated was the right spot so I don't know what the problem was in the first place.)\n\nTLDR Customer isn't happy I don't know for sure where an item is despite it not being my job to know, and despite my guesstimate being correct he yells at me in front of a bunch of people that I am an idiot and should be fired, all on the first day of my job.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1668238396.0},{"title":"Refund me because I didn\u2019t win!","author":"scream-queen-32","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromRetail\/comments\/yrnn8c\/refund_me_because_i_didnt_win\/","text":"I work the customer service desk at a grocery store.

I remember it was a Sunday afternoon, our busiest day\/time, and for once my department wasn\u2019t understaffed so I was going around tidying the department.\n\nA woman comes up from behind me and starts talking 300mph taking me by surprise. She gets about 15 seconds in then goes \u201coh forget it I\u2019ll ask someone else!\u201d And storms off to the tills. She hadn\u2019t even given me enough time to comprehend anything but I figured I was probably better off with her going elsewhere!\n\nI continued to tidy but stayed near the tills, I couldn\u2019t make out everything being said but I got bits and a member of security came out to talk to her and he seemed annoyed by the conversation. Eventually the woman stormed off. I went over to my colleagues at the till and got the details:\n\nThe lady claimed that the moment she walked into the store someone grabbed her purse off of her and ran off with it. She said she wasn\u2019t so worried about her money, but she had train tickets that cost a lot for a trip the next day that she couldn\u2019t miss. She wanted us to look at the security cameras and find the thief. My colleagues contacted security who said they couldn\u2019t do that. They said that in order to check back the footage they\u2019d have to stop recording and they can\u2019t do that incase there was an emergency and they missed it. No idea if this was true or not, but that\u2019s what security said.\n\nThe woman wasn\u2019t happy so security came out to explain, but she got more irate. Security said they would review the footage after the store shut and if they saw anything would pass it on to the police. The woman was not happy and said she\u2019d report us to the police for not helping. She was asked for her details incase anything showed up, but she refused saying if we weren\u2019t going to help her what\u2019s the point. \n\nI went back to tidying. About 10 minutes later I was tidying around the sale purse stand and one was on the floor. It looked a bit rough, but some of the sale purses had been there years so maybe it was an old one. I picked it up and felt something inside it move. I opened it up to see it was clearly someone\u2019s purse.\n\nI take it to the till and show my colleagues, it had a few notes in it, coins, and cards. They check the ID and confirm it\u2019s the lady\u2019s, complete with train tickets.\n\nAs there was still notes in it it looked more like it was dropped, rather than stolen. Though weirdly where I found it on the floor was further from the entrance, where she had claimed it was stolen, than our till so her story didn\u2019t fully add up but anyway.\n\nOne of my colleagues took it and walked around all 3 floors of the store looking for the woman but couldn\u2019t find her. It was taken to security to add to the lost and found.\n\nI assume this woman never got her purse back and missed her trip, or had to pay a lot to replace the tickets. But if she\u2019d have calmed down and given us a phone number she\u2019d have had her purse back within half an hour!\n\nEdit: a lot of you were confused by me saying something moved, I was referring to picking up the purse and loose coins moving inside.\n\nAlso when I say purse I\u2019m referring to the British use  in that it just holds money, not a whole bag. So she still had her phone etc \n\nAlso I\u2019m now convinced she was trying to steal.

Usually alone, doing all the jobs, including pumping gas. (No self service, in Oregon). The town's primary \"industry\", was recreational tourism... since the failure of the lumber industry. \n\nEarly one morning, a Suburban towing a travel trailer pulled in. This was very common, as was every other type of RV. An elderly couple got out. The nice older gentleman (NOG) asked me to please fill up the Suburban and said he also had a couple of gas cans that he needed filled. Cool, nice enough, but seemed a bit frustrated. Hooboy! Was I about to find out why! Enter: Mean Old Woman (MOW).\n\nMOW: *hands on hips* \"Why is the gas so expensive?\" (Super nasaly & loud)\nMe: \"Everything here is expensive, we're miles from anywhere\". \nMOW: \"Well, I heard YOU PEOPLE take advantage of tourists! Do you take advantage of tourists?!\" \nMe: \"Ma'am, I make minimum wage. I'm not taking advantage of anyone.\"\nMOW: \"The price per gallon is MUCH more than we pay at home!\"\nMe: \"The supplier sets the price, not me, not even the owner of this station.\"\nMOW: \"Can't you DO something?!\"\nMe: \"Um... something?\" (Honestly I was baffled)\nMOW: \"LIKE, GIVE US A DISCOUNT, YOU STUPID HICK! DO I HAVE TO SPELL IT OUT FOR YOU? YOU IDIOT!\"\n\nRight at that moment, before I could recover and muster any sort of response, her husband came around the back of the trailer (gas cans in hand) wondering why his wife was shouting. \n\nNOG: (to MOW) \"What on earth are you yelling about?\"\nMOW: \"The gas is so EXPENSIVE here! And this idiot won't give us a discount!\"\nNOG: (Calmly) \"Calm down, we knew it would be and I'm absolutely certain this nice young man has nothing to do with it.\"\nMOW: (Shrieking) \"He NEEDS to give us a discount!\"\nNOG: (Firmly) \"No, he doesn't. There probably isn't a way to do it, anyway. Now get back in the truck and leave this nice young man alone.\"\n\nShe exaggerated her frustration as she stomped off, still angrily talking about \"expensive\" this and \"discount\" that. But she did go away. Phew!\n\nNOG: (Wryly) \"Don't mind her, she gets mad about any price higher than it was in the 60's. I'm so sorry about the way she spoke to you.\"\nMe: \"I appreciate that, but you don't need to apologize. You've been really nice. Plus, she's not as bad as my mom.\"\nNOG: (Chuckling) \"I appreciate you being understanding.\"\n\nI finished filling up his gas cans and we each carried one back to the trailer, where I helped him strap them down, securely. He handed me cash for payment and I headed inside to get his change. As I was coming back out, he had pulled away from the pumps and was carefully making the turn to the exit. I waved with his change in my hand and he stopped. I was now on the passenger (MOW) side of the Suburban. They rolled the window down and out came the claw-like hand of MOW. \n\nMOW: \"Hurry up, FATSO!\"\nMe: \"Do NOT speak to me like that!\" (I'm a big dude and have a loud, deep, booming voice, when I choose to).\nMOW: *mouth agape in stunned silence*\nNOG: (to MOW)  \"I just can't believe you, sometimes! Just shut up!\"\nNOG: (to me) \"Once again, I am so sorry she spoke to you like that. Please, keep the change.\"\nMOW: *unintelligible shrieking as they pull away*\n\nThe change was right around $20 USD. We weren't technically allowed to take tips, but after I told my boss the whole story when he came in later, he was very empathetic and said it was okay to keep it.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1667801533.0},{"title":"\u201cCan I Park My Bike in Here?\u201d","author":"pink_grapeFruity","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromRetail\/comments\/yng3w1\/can_i_park_my_bike_in_here\/","text":"I work in an athletic wear store in a strip mall.

He said it was false advertising and that he NEEDED his bar for that price. I was a young sapling at the point (still am but yk) and very shy and he was yelling so loud every other cashier on the front end could hear. \n\nThe woman working the register in front of me was Bunny, an older, grandma-style lady. She and I had a good relationship and it was her very last day. Kevin had begun to swear at me, and Bunny turned right around and told him to f off. Then she made a move towards him (literally just pointing at him). He started saying she had assaulted him (not so, later when my manager came out to threaten to check the footage, he got real quiet). Once I called a Code 2 (aka, help needed at my register) he started telling me to process the transaction and that he would take the bar for $3. \n\nI didnt let his card go through, and instead let the manager come out to have a word with him. She told him that just because someone misplaced something back in the candy aisle, we couldn't comp the price for him.

It only took three days for my first incident to happen. The day startled like any other but midway though the shift Karen came to my till asking to buy $1500 in green dot cards+ activation fees.\n\nFor those who don't know green dot cards are special for two reasons: reason one unlike ordinary gift cards our system at least at the time put a small amount of money on the card as soon as it was scanned and reason two they are payable by cash only because they have all the functionality of a debit\/checking card. So far nothing out of the ordinary aside from the high transaction balance.\n\nRed flag number one despite it clearly informing her on the packaging of the card itself that it can only be paid with cash she tries to pay with a credit card. When I relay this to her she insists that I run it though anyway ERROR Payment Type Not Allowed. Que debate of her insisting there is cash on the card and me trying to explain that the card didn't decline it was rejected because the system won't allow it because it is cash payment only. At this point she demands a manager because i am being unhelpful and clear don't know how to do my job. (at this point I still had a temporary name badge with new hire printed on it)\n\nRed flag number two while we were waiting on the supervisor she kept tying to convince me to let her have custody of the green dot cards and me repeatedly stating due to the type of cards you are attempting to purchases company policy prohibits me from handing them to you until the transaction is completed. This is because there was already money on them and if she took them and ran she could transfer that money off the card before we could void it. The supervisor came and promptly told her not only was there no way to override it but even if she could she wouldn't because it is clearly against the terms of the product she wanted to buy.\n\nRed flag number three she pulls out a wad of hundred dollar bills and starts to count out the amount need but when it picked them up they looked off to say the least. In detail they were printed on ordinary printer paper, apparently on the black and white ink setting, they were the wrong size, and they weren't even cut straight. At that rather than say anything to her just reached for the intercom and requested a supervisor. She asked why I did that and I told a half truth informing her that large cash transaction required supervisor approval which provided the bills don't look more fake than Disney bucks they do but the real reason is I wanted a witness when I told her the was no way I was going to accept these bills.\n\nThe supervisor returns and I ask her for a second option on the validity of these bills. She glanced at them for all of two seconds before telling Karen to return these bills to where ever she got them from because the are fake and illegal to possess and asks if she has any other legal tender cash to pay with. Karen says no and the supervisor collects the cards and voids the transaction taking both the card and void receipt for evidence but returns the fake bills to Karen.\n\nShe later left after some more complaining but nothing ever came of it.\n\nLater one of my co workers approached me and said to me they recognized her from their other job and she supposedly has been banned from every other store in the area not just our company for trying this same song and dance there.\n\nA few notes: 1. Due to policy we couldn't confiscate the fake cash on the in this case incredibly slim chance it was real. 2. We for what ever reason do not have security or loss prevention at this store and associates are expected to deal with there own problems and safety. 3. Because of the no security situation we couldn't detain her till the police arrived. 4. We did however call the police to report it and let every other store in the state know of her. 5.

We verbally state our return policy to each customer and circle the return policy on the receipt as a visual cue that we did verbally tell them too. I even confirmed with the staff member who rang them through that she verbally told her our policy, and she said she remembers because she had helped her earlier in the week for 2 hours. For context, I manage a retail store so often our interactions are pretty involved. Anyways, we don\u2019t give full refunds back, only store credit, which is why we are very clear about the policy. I told her I didn\u2019t appreciate her threatening me or my staff with a lawsuit. We are often very flexible with the policy and had she politely asked for an exception, I would have happily given her a full refund. I did in this case anyways because I wanted this nut job out of my store but I could tell from the look on her face and how she approached the conversation, that this is something she does often, and probably for her own enjoyment.

I have worked in retail for quite a while now. This is the first time I\u2019ve ever experienced this. I was called to court to testify against a customer. \n\nLet\u2019s call the customer A. Now A was under the impression that they could return merchandise that they had for longer than our return policy (they also broke it). We decided to make an exception and return it however, A would have to pay the restocking fee. This is where things got wild. A started pacing around the store and yelling profanities. My manager was already involved in the situation and told A if they didn\u2019t stop they were going to be kicked out. A went absolutely insane and said some completely vulgar\/profane things to my manager. Meanwhile, other customers were just watching and listening (this includes a child around 8) so my manager told A to leave or we would call the police. Upon hearing this, A started to break our displays and merchandise on the shelves and when the police were called, A left. \n\nFast forward several months and I have to go to court to testify against A for the damage done in the store. Turns out the damages came out to several thousand dollars. Luckily, court was adjourned before I ever had to say anything and eventually led to a guilty plea later on.\n\nEdit: Recently found out that A is serving 5 years in a state prison.

The weather turned to trash and suddenly people are clamoring for new inside furniture because that 15 year old couch isn\u2019t as comfortable as before when you\u2019ve spent all summer and most of this month out bbq-ing and enjoying the outdoors on the new outdoor stuff you bought last year. \n\nDue to excess inventory we have a lot of small bedside tables marked down. But it\u2019s only one color. Like kind of a natural pine color. Beautiful, warm tones. They\u2019re $100. Clearly labeled clearance. To help move inventory, we\u2019re taking extra discounts on these items. The tags that you bring to the counter are different colors and the items themselves are also emblazoned with huge yellow \u201cCLEARANCE (price as marked)\u201d signs. No way to mistake that one is clearance over the other. \n\nLady brings up a tag to my cashier. We\u2019ve hired some seasonals and the kid working the counter is super cool, super respectful. Great kid. She brings up the tag for a non-clearance table from one of our arrangements in the back. It\u2019s original tag price is listed as $400, but it\u2019s on sale for $200. Pretty killer deal if you ask me. She asks for a price check, insists it\u2019s a clearance tag. Like aggressively insists she plucked the tag for this cherry bedside table off a clearance item and it should be $75.00. \n\nHe scans the tag, politely informs the customer that the tag isn\u2019t ringing clearance and that it\u2019s $200. She immediately screams that that\u2019s wrong. He apologizes and says that they\u2019re the pine tables and clearly marked with red tags and yellow clearance signs, and that the table she plucked is for a cherry table. Not clearance but, still a great deal. She demanded a manager. Stating that nowhere on anything did it say it was strictly for the pine tables. \n\nI walk over and check it out. She\u2019s got the tag for a cherry table sitting there and demands that it was tagged clearance. I ask her what section she got the tag from, she answers the big section of end tables in the back of the store. \n\nMe: \u201cYeah, So that\u2019s typically extras section, pushed against the back of the wall. We have some smaller sets and tables back there since we have a lot of clearance ones. Unfortunately, the cherry ones aren\u2019t part of the clearance. Just the pine.\u201d\n\nCustomer: \u201cThat\u2019s not right. You have all these tables marked as clearance. The signs aren\u2019t specific for the pine ones. This one is clearance. I want this one for the $100. Your signs are misleading. Nowhere does it say anywhere on the signs that it\u2019s specific to the pine. I saw this cherry one and it\u2019s clearance!\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I have all the clearance tables marked clearance. They have yellow signs and red tags. Again, I\u2019d be happy to get you a clearance table but they\u2019re pine not cherry.\u201d\n\nCustomer: \u201cWell. I\u2019m a marketing manager and this is wrong. The signs don\u2019t indicate the pine ones. This is false advertising. I\u2019m going to post all over your corporate website. I\u2019m going to post it all over the internet about your unfair business practices.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cand you are welcome to do so. Again, I\u2019m so sorry but the item you picked is not clearance. Clearance is clearly marked with giant yellow signs and red tags. I\u2019m happy to sell it to you if you\u2019d still like it but I cannot mark a $400 table on sale to $200 down to $75. It\u2019s $200. If you\u2019d like to swap it for a pine one for $75. We can do that. Your choice.\u201d\n\nI had to walk away at that point. I\u2019ve been doing this a long time and I know that this particular customer would continue to argue with me and (SEEING AS I SET THE DAMN DISPLAY MYSELF) we would get nowhere, I literally left the choice in the customers hands. I wasn\u2019t rude and I wasn\u2019t aggressive. I was pretty polite and understanding.\n\nBut when you threaten me with corporate or complaints, that\u2019s fine\u2014 that\u2019s your prerogative\u2014 but essentially the negotiation ends. I don\u2019t reward aggressive and unkind behavior especially when you come guns a-blazing at my team. I always have their backs. My leaders running the store know this and they back me up. They know I\u2019m never unkind and always offer a fair solution to a customer and leave it in the customers hands. \n\nUltimately the customer left the cherry table but purchased her replica Tiffany lamp and left. I happened to be fixing something up front and her receipt printed with the survey on the bottom. I encouraged her to fill out the survey with her dissatisfaction about the signage. Corporate absolutely wants to know if the way they want the signage isn\u2019t clear. They ultimately make those calls, not me. \n\nI ended up emailing my contacts including my boss and and their boss with the situation. I let the young cashier read it before I sent it to make sure I had everything above board and the situation wasn\u2019t misrepresented. \n\nThough a couple cashiers pointed out after I walked away (and after I\u2019d sent that email) that she called me a bitch and told my cashier to never end up like their boss. \n\nIronically enough, my team also had my back and thought I was being fair by offering to swap for the pine ones and they couldn\u2019t understand how someone could be so obtuse as to assume that every side table was clearance being that clearance is always heavily marked down and clearly, sometimes annoyingly excessively, labeled.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1666588851.0},{"title":"Guilty as Charged","author":"ofthedappersort","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromRetail\/comments\/yb5w94\/guilty_as_charged\/","text":"I used to work at a liquor store.

None of us could see each other and none of us except my boss had walkie-talkies (that was a mistake!) \n\nI finished what I was doing on the sales floor and came up to the front desk to talk to my shift lead. He ends up grabbing me by the arm and saying in a low voice \"go find the manager...NOW.\" It was out of the ordinary and super creepy. \"I was like wtf, is she okay? What's going on\" My shift lead again told me to go find the manager and to be quiet about it. he said that there was a very sketchy looking customer standing near the double doors with a cart full of merchandise and my lead said he was afraid the guy was going to run out with it. \n\nI went to find my manager and had to pass the guy on the way. I put on my fake-ass customer service voice and asked him how his night was going, was he finding everything ok, etc. He said \"yeah I'm fine thanks\" all the while staring at me. Once I was out of eyesight I ran to the backroom and found my boss. I told her what was going on and we walked together to the foyer. When we got there the shift lead told us that the guy had run out the door, leaving his cart. I started to go out the first set of automatic doors with my phone in hand to see if I could get a picture of the guy\/his car\/his license plates. My manager said \"Hey, don't chase him.\" I responded with \"Yeah yeah, I know, I'll be careful.\" \n\nMy dumbass started walking out the second set of automatic doors to the parking lot when my boss YELLED at me \"DO NOT GO OUTSIDE!!!\" She never ever yells, so it scared me. I turned around and came back inside, my manager escorted me back into the store and away from the windows. She then told me that the guy was sitting in his car with the lights off staring at me and that he had a second person in the passenger seat also staring at me. I had seen the car in the lot but didn't think anyone was in it. I don't know how she saw the guy in there but I'm glad she did. She ended up locking the doors (even though it was still 30 minutes to close). She then rang up the guy's cart and it was over $850 worth of booze. We went to her office and filled out a report. Once everyone's shifts had ended we walked together to our cars, nobody really wanted to be alone in the parking lot that night.\n\nI've seen shoplifters and I've seen sketchy customers come in near closing but this guy was really weird.

It would be appreciated if, pending removal, if it has to happen, I could be directed to a more appropriate subreddit??\n\nAnywho.\n\nSecond point, the night lead was new, fresh off the training grill, and was unused to this Aggravating Coworker's antics.\n\nLoaf was in the grocery store she works at, helping in the frozen section, unloading boxes of frozen foods like vegetables, chicken, fish, the like. She is working, when her co-worker \u2014let's call her AC, for aggravating co-worker\u2014 comes over, asking to help because, as she claimed, she had worked the frozen section before. Loaf, with no reason not to believe her, said she would be glad for the help. Now, Loaf did know that AC was susceptible to cold, so when she arrived at the frozen section without a jacket or anything, Loaf asked why AC wasn't wearing anything to keep warm. Here's how the conversation went: \n\nL: puts down the box she was stacking. \"Hey, AC, don't you get cold easily?\"\n\nAC: \"Yes?\"\n\nL: \"So, where is your jacket?\"\n\nAC: \"Oh, I left it in the break room.\"\n\nL: \"But you want to help me.....in the frozen section.....why didn't you grab your jacket?\"\n\nAC: \"Oh, I just didn't feel like it.\"\n\nL: She looks at AC \"You \"didn't feel like it\"? But this is the frozen section....and you're susceptible to cold.....yeah, that makes no sense. Go get your jacket.\"\n\nAC: She huffs angrily. \"Fine, whatever.\" She saunters off to get her jacket.\n\nAfter she leaves, Loaf continues working, stacking things where they go. A few minutes later, AC returns, thankfully wearing a jacket. AC walks to the first box she sees and opens it, revealing a very specific, very obvious brand of fish, labeled the same yellow as a section of the fish wall, which is where all fish are supposed to go. AC looks at the package, then looks at the section next to her\u2014frozen meals. Definitely *not* where raw fish is supposed to go. And then she continues looking for where to put the fish in that section, ignoring the fish wall completely. At first, Loaf let it slide, assuming she would realize that was not where fish go.\n\nLoaf looks over a few minutes later, and AC is still looking for the fish among the frozen meals. Loaf walks up to her and says, \"AC, the fish goes over there, on the fish wall,\" pointing to the very easily spotted wall of fish, at the end of the wall behind her, next to the Deli. AC nods, and proceeds to walk over to the fish wall, but takes about twenty to thirty minutes to find where the exact brand of fish goes withing the fish wall. She finally manages to put the fish away, coming back to get another box. This time, it's a box of premade, frozen meals. AC proceeds to take them all the way to the *fish wall*, despite taking a long time to look for *fish* in the *frozen meals section* which was right beside her. Loaf looks at AC strangely, before once again helping her find the right section, because as I'm sure you readers have noticed, everything is divided by sections.\n\nSo, she finishes putting up that box, and picks up another one. Still frozen meals, but a different brand of frozen meals. And she once more goes to the fish section, despite having just been shown where the frozen meals go. Loaf once again gets up and directs her to the frozen meals section, only for AC to pick up another box, *still of frozen meals* and head directly for the fish wall. This happened not once, not twice, but several times. The naive creature that is Loaf blew off AC's lack of awareness of the frozen section, because it has been a while since AC worked the frozen section. Loaf assumed that with enough help, AC would finally remember her way around. She did not.\n\nWith each time Loaf had to help AC find the right section, she became more and more frustrated, until she huffed a little bit louder than she should have. She walked away to prevent herself from doing anything drastic (such as braining AC with a bag of shrimp), finishing up her own section and going to the restroom for a bit. When Loaf returned, AC was on the floor, sobbing her heart out and complaining to the night lead that Loaf had been bullying her and screaming at her. Now there were several co-workers who were around and had seen everything that had happened. When questioned by the lead, the co-workers all corroborated that everything AC was saying was not true, and that she had thrown similar fits in the past.\n\nAC was promptly taken off the frozen section, and another co-worker was called to help Loaf. It wasn't until later that everyone finally learned why AC, having worked in the frozen section before, was unable to find where anything went within their sections: she had left her magnifying glass at home, which she needs to be able to see clearly, despite already wearing glasses with inch-thick lenses.

The biggest issue we see are customers trying to upsize tires, but their rims are not wide enough for the tires to properly fit. Conversation goes somewhat as follows.  \n\n\nMe: \"These tires are wider than stock size. Sometimes they can be too wide for factory rims. Do you have larger aftermarket rims?\" \n\nCustomer, annoyed: \"How should I know? Thats the tire size I have on there right now.

We had long since fallen from grace and carried very little of the types of products people knew us for, such as PCB components, adapters, cables, and general equipment for the enthusiast. While working there, there was one customer who would come in every couple of weeks to get his kicks at the expense of some poorly paid retail employees.\n\n\nHe liked to come in and head over to our drawers full of little parts and pick around for a while. During this calm before the annoyance I would brace myself and prepare my best retail demeanor. After spending 20 to 30 minutes looking through store, he would come up to the register with a few small items worth a pittance. What came next was the part he really came in for.\n\n\nWhile ringing him up he would complain how we no longer carried the items he had once depended on us for back in our heyday. We had *such* a poor selection and the prices were *far* too high. He would state the exact same thing as everyone who walked through our doors, \"I can get it for much cheaper online.\" I know. I'm painfully aware. Why do you think we're on the verge of bankruptcy? I am fully aware that the cost of a single motor or transitor here could buy a dozen online. I get it.\n\n\nThis wasn't the end though. He would then proceed to brag about his high paying tech job, though I don't remember if he ever said where. He would brag about all these different projects he was working on at home, all these custom made electronics he built. How smart he was and, oh, did he mention all self-taught? Because that's how knowledgeable he was. Then we move on to the third act of his gloating play. \n\n\nHe would then proceed to ask us the most obscure, technical questions about our products and electronics in general. Questions we, part-time employees with no actual training on electronics, could never possibly respond to. Luckily I often spent the *very* dead middays actually reading the various books about electronics we had and learning a thing or two, so I would catch him off guard every once in a while with a competent response. However, any time we didn't have an exact answer for him he would give us this wonderfully condescending smirk and proceed to ask another question, feigning that he was bouncing ideas off us to improve one of his many glorious projects. A few times he made quiet remarks about how he thought the company should have hired employees who knew about what they sold.\n\n\nThis would go on for about ten immensely uncomfortable minutes before he seemed satisfied with his superiority over some part time retail employees. He would grab his stuff, graciously thank us for chatting with him, and leave for a couple weeks. He pissed me off like no other customer ever did.

One of these responsibilities is to receive what we call \"rush orders\". (idk if they go by a different name, or if every place does them since I don't know grocery stores out of my area). In case this isn't a common thing, a rush order is an extra order that we get from a 3rd party supplier that will come on the same day rather than coming in advance.\n\nWe have 2 companies that we get rush orders from. Company A has some issues sometimes, but nothing unusual about the attitude of their truck drivers, but Company B often comes with truck drivers that are really impatient and have intelligence so questionable, that I don't know how they passed any type of interview. This is just usual grocery store stuff though, some truck drivers are good, some are bad, and one company is worse, oh well.\n\nThat was until today when I had a truck driver that screwed up at so many turns, that it made my night watching him get screwed over by his own stupidity.  It was a usual day, I came in, my direct manager told me that 2 rush orders were to come in, about the same size and with similar items as yesterday's rush orders. I was a little annoyed because my direct manager overuses rush orders, and gets way too much stuff on them, which is thrown on me as I have to work it, but once again, oh well.\n\nCompany A comes by around the same time as the day before and goes by completely fine with no issues. Company B comes by a little later than the day before and I don't really care since that is how trucks tend to operate. however, there was a slight issue because another department was currently unloading one of their trucks. Trucks coming in at the same time happen often, and I ask the manager of that department (also was the only manager in at the time, so I will be referring to him as \"my manager\" for simplicity) how long he will be unloading his truck, because I still have a 15-minute break, that I want to take before I unload my truck. My manager tells me that he estimates it will be 20 minutes, and that if he finishes early, he will just unload my truck for me, and I can get to it when I'm done.\n\nSo, I take my break. However, I should mention that before I took my break, the driver of Company B asked if he could borrow our pump jack (I've also heard it called a hand jack in case that helps) \\[edit: a couple comments have pointed out it's also called a pallet jack\\] because his truck door is broken and isn't opening. In hindsight, I shouldn't have let him use it, or I should have gone with him to use it, but at the time I didn't care, and didn't think anything of it. About 5 minutes into my break, the driver comes back with our pump jack, but there is an issue. His door is still broken, and now our pump jack is too. One side of the pump jack is permanently lifted to barely fit inside of a skid, making the pump jack pretty much useless.\n\nAfter seeing this, I realize it's one of \"those\" drivers, and pause the timer I have for my break to go get the story on what's going on. I go out with the driver to look at his truck and how the door won't work, and I don't know why he thought a pump jack would work, but it didn't. The driver asked me about nearby mechanics, and I gave him a time he would need to be back by for me to have time to manage it. The driver leaves, and I go give the update to my manager. My manager is pissed at the driver, and tells me that if he comes back, to get his name.\n\nI finish my break, and work along as normal till an hour and a bit later, when the driver comes back. As I hear the beeping of the truck backing up, I know that this is going to be good.\n\nWhile I wouldn't mind getting a name myself, I thought it may be better for me to make sure everything is done right, so I let my manager know that he is back, and we go to receive the truck. My manager starts questioning the driver and is trying to get him to write down his name and company, which the driver is playing dumb about breaking our jack, until my manager says to write it down or he will call their companies dispatch, and that he's only asking since it makes both of their lives easier, and the driver writes it down.\n\nSo, we start prepping to receive, and luckily, for some random reason, the driver has a pump jack in his truck, and since my manager has his own job to do, he leaves me to do the unloading. Of course, our single skid of supplies was at the back of the truck, blocked off by several other skids. normally, I would be annoyed, but at this point, I'm not in any rush to get things done, and this is really funny to watch, so I'm actually kind of glad that I get to see more.\n\nQue a montage of me trying to unload the truck, and the truck driver constantly getting in the way and wasting time. multiple times I would explain that I have to do things a little differently than he wants, and he would give me a look like I didn't know what I was doing, he would try to do it himself, and proceed to try it, only to realize that I was right. Even with my little experience and slight struggle with driving a jack, I probably could have unloaded that truck in half the time, but if he wants to treat me like I don't know what I'm doing, then I'll absolutely take the free show and watch the truck unloading equivalent of fitting a square peg into a circle hole.\n\nAfter a decently long process, I'm finally able to get the truck properly unloaded. I start cleaning up the area and go through my mental checklist of everything I need to do before a driver leaves. As I'm doing this, the driver gets back in his truck and is about to leave. I realize that I never signed or got a store copy of the invoice for our order. I turn my manager just beside me and ask,\n\n\"did you sign the invoice?\"\n\nHe had not. this means that the proof of purchase, does not exist, meaning we could just say \"we didn't receive your order,\" and they have no way of forcing our company to pay. I highly doubt we would do this though, since it would cause more work on our end, and burn a bridge that we don't need to burn, but the idea of the driver realizing that he forgot what is one of the most important parts of his job makes me laugh inside, and I do hope that whoever calls them about our jack, gives them a little scare about it, but once again, I don't think that will come about.\n\nThe final little icing on top, however, is when my manager is annoyed at the attitude he showed, so before the driver left, he fully closed the back door of the truck. hope that driver liked his trip to the mechanic to open his door, because he will likely need another one. After the driver left, it was pretty uneventful. I made a custom invoice so we could have a record of what came in, I worked through the rush order, and made sure to let in the fun to story (heavily summarized) to my coworkers, including a less summarized version to my direct manager to keep him in the know how.\n\nI think this is all from my entertaining tale, but if i hear anything more from it, I will be sure to update, thx for reading my first retail encounter that was good enough to share.","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1664677287.0},{"title":"Monthly TFR Express Lane - Post your short retail anecdotes and pandemic-related experiences here!","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromRetail\/comments\/xsti5z\/monthly_tfr_express_lane_post_your_short_retail\/","text":"Welcome to \/r\/TalesFromRetail's Express Lane - your quick stop for short tales, pithy observations and general retail chat about how things are going with your store, your customers and yourselves.\n\nAny experiences with pandemic-related topics (mask issues, anti-vaxxer encounters, etc.) should also be posted here and not as a stand-alone tale.\n\nPlease [follow the rules](\/r\/TalesFromRetail\/wiki\/) regarding anonymity and derogatory speech.

The full-service pumps were separated from the self-service pumps, off at an angle from the store area.  When we saw someone pull up to a full-service pump we would jog over and take care of pumping their gas, cleaning their windshield, checking their tire pressures and oil... etc.  Sometimes people would park *near* the full-service pumps just because they're out of the way and we didn't have a lot of parking spaces near the store.\n\nThat is what *appeared* to be the case on this day, a Jeep Cherokee pulled up in the vicinity of the full-service pumps, but their gas door was on the wrong side and they weren't close enough to the pumps to look like they wanted gas.  After a few moments of sitting there we heard squealing tires.\n\nUh oh.\n\nThe Cherokee was *racing* up to the self-service pumps and then slammed on the brakes, skidding a bit.  A young-lady (early twenties) jumped out and slammed the door.\n\nJeep lady: \"If nobody is going to HELP me then I'll just DO IT myself!!!\"\n\nMe: \"I'm sorry ma'am, I didn't...\"\n\nJeep lady: \"It's FINE!\"\n\n*<proceeds to look at a self-service gas pump for what appears to be the first time in her life>*\n\nMe: \"I'd be happy to help...\"\n\nJeep lady: \"I just want to put $20 in, where do I put the $20?!?!\" *<waving a $20 bill around>*\n\nMe: \"If you want to pay cash, you have to pay inside, I'd be happy to take it inside to the cashier for you\"\n\n*<if you were paying cash, it was a \"pump first\" situation, our pumps didn't let us set them for a specific amount>*\n\nJeep lady: <*proceeds to pump a little over $20>*\n\nI asked the cashier if they wanted to go get the rest from her, we laughed and decided that the $20 she had already given us was close enough... and she was already aggravated enough.\n\nIn all honesty, I should have ran over to see if she needed help when she first pulled up, but based on my experience up until then it *really* didn't look like she was \"at\" the pump.  The self-service pumps were substantially less expensive, but I was 100% willing to give her \"full-service\" at them just to make up for \"neglecting\" her at the other pumps.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1664568599.0},{"title":"White Smoke","author":"gyresirfer","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromRetail\/comments\/xr9rse\/white_smoke\/","text":"One day, the entire parking lot was covered in a cloud of heavy white smoke.

Automatically asks for a jewelers loupe to inspect her diamond. Graciously hand her one and said no problem!

I ask her if she would like me to show her how to use the loupe. She snaps at me and says clearly she knows how to use one.. she absolutely did not. Distance from the eye to loupe is about one inch, distance from the loupe to piece is another inch, give or take your depth perception. \n\n\u201cYou switched my diamond\u201d she proclaimed. I continued to say \u201cexcuse me?\u201d She claimed I switched out her diamond to which I\u2019m baffled at this point. Demanding to speak to authority, I said you\u2019re speaking to one.

Tried reasoning with her until I had to get VERY blunt. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m assuming you don\u2019t know how this works, for me to switch out a diamond, and a marquise shape at that. I would have had to know your exact dimensions of the diamond before you came in here. Your diamond isn\u2019t from here but I said I would clean it for free for you. Now your accusing me of switching out your diamond within 2-3 minutes when it would have taken me at least 10 minutes to even try and find a stone that had your same exact dimensions. Because if it didn\u2019t I would have had to change the head of your diamond to hold a different sized stone, which requires a jewelers torch, putting on a new one, and then cleaning your ring to perfection to dip into the rhodium. All of that alone would have taken me a solid 45 minutes. Rhodium is $20,000+ per oz right now and if you think I\u2019m going to contaminate a batch of rhodium on your ring to maybe profit $1,000 on switching out your stone is absurd. Kindly take your ring back to where you bought it from to have them confirm with you that INDEED it\u2019s still your diamond, and do not ask for me to service your ring ever again\u201d she huffed and puffed and walked out. \n\nGot a call later from her husband apologizing saying that he heard the story and it was her diamond\u2026 \n\nEducate yourself before you accuse a professional of theft bitch.\n\nEdit: thank you for correcting my spelling.

I've come back because in all the stories I ever told you, there's one I held back on because it's just... baffling. Even now I don't know what to make of it.\n\nThis is the story of Mister SmarterThanEveryone. Poor guy. The *weirdest* things kept happening... and just to him! Nobody else!\n\nSo here's the thing about Mister SmarterThanEveryone: he was genuinely charming as hell. When you first met him you'd immediately be smitten by his hobbit-like presence. I'm not saying he was especially short but he had that whole folksy \"Samwise\" thing that made ya just wanna kiss 'im. Platonically.\n\nAnyway. He was a charming cherub that instantly put a smile on your face.\n\nUntil it was time to actually talk business. Then, quite suddenly, he was a soul-sucking Nazg\u00fbl.\n\nNow, this was at \"Popular Truck Renthaul\", and the main reason he'd come in was to rent a truck. By the time I'd encountered him he was an old customer. He knew the routine.\n\nExcept, somehow, he always acted like this was all going completely wrong and we were making wildly unreasonable demands that he'd never, *never* dealt with before! I mean why are we grilling him for all of this personal information! \n\nLike his phone number. \n\n\"What do you need that for?\" \"Well I'm not sure what my phone number is, I never call myself.\" \"Okay hang on, let me call my wife... ya honey? What's my phone number? Ya, Popular Truck Renthaul wants it. I know, weird right?? What do you need that for again?\"\n\nEvery time. And every time he acted like maybe, just maybe, this time he wouldn't have to share that information. \n\nAfter about ten minutes, you'd extract his phone number from him. And then you'd have to negotiate with him to get his driver's license, which inevitably he left in his car. \n\nAnd then he didn't want to leave a credit card or a deposit, and so you'd have long back-and-forth conversations about how...\n\nNo, that wasn't optional... no, last time he definitely did leave his credit card... no, the manager didn't make an exception... no, the manager wouldn't make one now... no, the manager isn't available... \n\n... and then he'd go back to the car to get that too because he couldn't be bothered to bring in his whole wallet.\n\nEvery. Single. Time.\n\nKids, if you think that sound bad, I hate to inform you that we're just getting warmed up. That's all preamble. This is calm-before-the-storm stuff here.\n\nAs you're probably aware, you pay per-mile for most truck rentals - especially if it's just a short trip. And he'd argue about the mileage.\n\nOccasionally? Hahahah no every single time. \n\n\"No **way** it was that far! Impossible! I went like 5 max!\" And then he'd describe a trip several cities over. And then insist that that's just 5 miles.\n\nWe tried showing him on Google Maps, but then he'd want us to play with the route between the cities to show the shortest distance possible and claim **that's** how far he really went and how the system must have just gone crazy or something!\n\nSo we'd dig out the photos we always, **always** took of his odometer... because he made us have to... \"Oh that's an old picture.\" \"No. That's the picture I took when you got in the truck. You saw me take it.\" \"Well... \" \n\nThat's Easy mode for Mister SmarterThanEveryone. Let's bump it up to Intermediate, shall we?\n\nMister SmarterThanEveryone is late returning his truck. \n\nActually, I should clarify: I'm not entirely certain he'd ever returned a truck on time. \n\nWhenever this happens, he argues about what \"he was told\" about when it was supposed to be returned, argue that he shouldn't have to pay for an extra day because \"it's included, right?\", etc...\n\nSo the millisecond he's late, we call him.\n\nFirst few times: \"Oh, ya, I'm on my way. I'm like 10 minutes away.\" And he wouldn't show up until morning.\n\nNext few times he just didn't answer. So we left a message telling him the MASSIVE fee we were about to dump onto his credit card if he didn't call us IMMEDIATELY.\n\nWhich was a bluff. But he bought it.\n\n\"Sorry for the misunderstanding. I'm on the road right now...\" *kid screams in the background, a waitress asks him to clarify his order...*\n\nOkay. So what does Hard Mode look like?\n\n\"Hey, I can't bring the truck in because it stalled on the side of the road. I also want a discount.\"\n\n\"Dang Mister SmarterThanEveryone, that's rough and I totally believe you as well.\"\n\n\"And this happened last time too! And I want a refund for that!\"\n\n\"Gee you'd think that would be something you'd have mentioned. But meanwhile, if you're having trouble, you need to call Roadside Assistance.\"\n\n\"I don't want to call Roadside Assistance.\"\n\n\"Well, if there's a problem with the truck, you have to. It isn't optional.\"\n\n\"Can you... Can you call them for me?\"\n\n\"Nope. The number's on your paperwork. Front page. Huge numbers. The ONLY phone number on there. Can't miss it.\"\n\n\"I uh... I lost... it?\"\n\n\"No problem, write this down...\"\n\n\"I don't have anything to write with.\"\n\n\"You have to call them.\"\n\n\"Can... please just call them for me! PLEEEZZZZ\"\n\n\"So you want me to call and send a tow truck for you?\"\n\n\"Um...... yyyess?\"\n\n\"And it's on the side of the road?\"\n\n\"Yes... well no, I managed to get it home...\"\n\nThe roadside assistance guys pull up, check the truck - and miracle of miracles, it starts right up.\n\nSibwe charge Mister SmarterThanEveryone an extra $75 for calling a tow truck for no reason. \n\nSo the next time...\n\n\"Hey I can't bring the truck in because it stalled on the side of the road. I also want a discount.\"\n\n\"I can't do anything. Call roadside assistance.\"\n\n\"But last time you guys charged me $75 for that!\"\n\n\"That's only if there's nothing actually wrong and they come out for no reason.\"\n\n\"Well I don't wanna call!\"\n\n\"Then you'd better be here by 5.\"\n\n\"But I'm far awaaayyy...\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"See you at 5?\"\n\n\"Okay...\"\n\nAlright, alright, last gasp time: Nightmare Mode. How did Mister SmarterThanEveryone manage to finally get himself banned from ... what name did I come up with for U... \"Popular Truck Renthaul\"?\n\n\"My truck isn't safe to drive! All the lights on the dash came on!\"\n\n\"... what do you mean 'all the lights'?\"\n\n\"I mean all the warning lights! This truck is a death trap and I need to be refunded because...\"\n\n\"You're going to need to send me a picture of that.\"\n\n\"I thought you'd never ask!\"\n\nHe had this one ready. It was his little ace up his sleeve. And boy was it... something. \n\nYou know how when you first put the key in the ignition and turn on the car\/truck, and all the lights come on momentarily to make sure they still work?\n\nYa. That's the picture he sent.\n\nThat was the final straw. Our manager was tired not just of the hassle, but of Mister SmarterThanEveryone treating us like complete idiots. Permabanned.\n\nA month later he was banned from every other branch of the company, which is really saying something because the place down the street was full of some deeply ambivalent folk who would be just as happy to watch the company burn.\n\nNot that I was ever a big company man but... I digress...\n\nWe heard some rumblings that he was using another company's trucks, but then he was fired from his job for trying to con his employer by claiming expenses that didn't exist.\n\nWho could have seen that coming?","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1664414452.0},{"title":"No Ma'am, You Can't Have It For Free","author":"Immediate_Area9178","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromRetail\/comments\/xpxmey\/no_maam_you_cant_have_it_for_free\/","text":"I was working the register in the garden area and one of the 90+ degree days a few weeks ago.

I\u2019ll include some context as well because it\u2019s an annoying story. \n\nA few years ago, I worked for a game retailer and my district manager took leave in November, right before the busiest time of the year. My old manager, who trained me, was being placed in that role temporarily. At the time, he was in the process of training a woman who was going to be a store manager. Once his entire store found out he was going to be a temp and the new woman was to run the store, they all gave their notice. Me being the person I am, half joked that I could run his store (it was the busiest in his district next to a mall store). Come to find out, they suggested this to the regional manager and\u2026 that\u2019s what happened. My assistant became a temp store manager and I got transferred temporarily as well. \n\nSince I was now running this store, the entire staff rescinded their notice. I had visited my old manager a lot, dropped off supplies, picked up supplies, etc. Everyone pretty much knew me already so it wasn\u2019t so much an issue taking over. I assured everyone I\u2019d do my best to accommodate time off, requests, availability and that I was way less strict than their manager who was now a temporary district manager. \n\nSo onto that customer. I will say, my store and this store were about an hour and 20 minutes apart. So the culture difference\u2026 is immense, to say the least. When my old manager was training the woman who was going to take over, she broke a cardinal rule\u2026 never run a credit card manually. Well, she refunded this guest manually, and the money didn\u2019t go back on their card like it should have.\n\nThis customer calls me and tells me what happened and I already knew about it because I was shown the receipt and asked (jokingly) what was wrong with it. Cool, now I get to deal with it. I told him I would look into it and get back to him, took his name and number, etc. then I called our customer service to try and get answers. That company I worked for has a terrible service line and even worse he\u2019ll line. \n\nAnyway, I was on the phone for about an hour try to figure this out. I forget the outcome but I told the guy to wait 10 more days and let me know if it doesn\u2019t go back. He gets all pissy but days ok. 10 days later, no money back. Cool. I spend another 90 mins on hold. I finally call the guy and said I was told he needs to contact his bank and ask specific questions. He fought with me again. This time, he got rude and personal\u2026 but then he hung up and called our customer service himself. He calls back maybe 45 minutes later and tells me that customer service told him I lied and never did anything I said I did. He called me a lazy bitch and I had had enough. I started to get snarky because fuck this guy. \n\nAs I\u2019m being yelled at, the district manager calls and I have them both on speaker. He asked me what it was and I said, \u201cremember those guests I was telling you about? That\u2019s them.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat the fuck? Just hang up\u201d\n\nSo I did. \n\nI had maybe a 15 minute conversation with that manager and while we were talking, the asshole guest calls me back and I tell my employee to leave them on hold until I\u2019m ready. And I did just that. For another 10 minutes because I didn\u2019t need or want to be yelled at or talked down to again. \n\nOnce I finally pick up, I get a rude \u201cHELLO?\u201d \n\n\u201cYes, sorry about that, the call must have dropped. What were you saying again?\u201d\n\nI hear a woman start talking and she grabs the phone. She goes off on me about the whole thing and I literally laughed at her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you feel that way, but I did what I could. I\u2019m being told to wait, that\u2019s all I can do.\u201d That\u2019s when she tells me that this guy used his child support card to buy a game for himself and they couldn\u2019t call about the money and that\u2019s why. They called another store and gave them no troubles but called me to get their money back. I finally had enough and told him to come and get it. I told them they had whatever amount of time was left in the hours and then I\u2019d be done with them. The woman spouted off some bullshit about how she was coming to see me. \u201cOk, good luck, I\u2019ll see ya soon.\u201d\n\nAt the time, I had an assistant who was a few months pregnant. I\u2019m a very defensive person when it comes to my people (my old store called me mom) so I told my assistant that if she saw the woman (I had found her picture) showed up to call 911 and stay behind the counter because if she came in swinging, I\u2019d get physical to protect her. \n\nBy the end of the night, no one had shown up for their refund and I left it at that. I had called the other store the next day and they told me they refunded them in cash and they were also jerks to them too. The manager there even asked me, \u201cwhat the fuck is wrong with them?\u201d \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been so pissed off that I would have gotten into a physical altercation, but here we are. I have his name and number somewhere with his address. He may or may not have gotten a random potato saying \u201cyou\u2019re a dick,\u201d but no one will ever know the truth about that. \n\n\n\nTldr: got blamed for something I didn\u2019t do, tried to resolve it, got called a lazy bitch and a liar and the guy never got his money back on his child support card that he used to buy himself a game with. He went to another store closer to his house and got a refund there after he, in not so many words, threatened to get physical. I was ready to throw down but they never showed.\n\n\nEdit to add: I guess it wasn\u2019t clear that the customer in question was extremely rude and blamed me for everything that was happening with the situation from A to Z. When you\u2019re a store manager in a corporate company, there is only so much you can do at the store level. One must rely on their customer service to solve the issue and I went above and beyond to find the answer. I did offer a cash refund at one point but he didn\u2019t want to drive to my store and demanded it be put back on the card. Literally not something I can do without the person in the store. \n\nI was not the reason that this happened so when this customer said it was my fault and then started calling me a lazy lying bitch, I\u2019m not going to stand by and be disrespected. No one who works service should have to deal with that.","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1664139937.0},{"title":"Lady with coupons in self checkout","author":"soccereler","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromRetail\/comments\/xnd0ld\/lady_with_coupons_in_self_checkout\/","text":"I was working self checkout and this lady comes with a kind of full basket.

First thing that came to my mind was to ask her if she had scanned them because sometimes customers don't scan them and ask for help. \n\nShe replied with a sarcastic \"no, I'm stupid\" because having an attitude is always a great way to start a conversation with someone who you want to help you.\n\nIt caught me off guard as I had not even really interacted with her at that point. I then looked at the coupon and the box of tampons. It appeared to be the right thing but as we all know coupons can be super specific sometimes. \n\nSo I go ask someone up front to go check. Front end manager goes check then the lady ends up following her down the isle. The coupon is next to another kind of tampon of the same brand. \n\nFront end manager told the woman that she really did not know why it wasn't taking off so the woman got all huffy and started with the attitude again. Manager just walked away so the situation wouldn't escalate further.\n\nThe woman ended up getting the the tampons that the coupons were right next to. She then walked back up to the self checkout and asked if the front end manager was the highest manager there. I of course said no. Then she asked for the store manager, who wasn't there , only an assistant. Then she started with the \"I'm gonna call the store and complain\" stuff. Then I shut up and walked away.\n\nShe actually started calling the store while still in self checkout I'm pretty sure. Assistant manager took the call and basically she was like \"that girl in self checkout (me) was on her phone (not my phone) , ignoring me , not giving me enough attention, etc. Then the front end manager had an attitude with me.\" \n\nIn the end though neither of us got in trouble and had the customer not gave us an attitude, one of us could have just put the coupon in manually.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1664078844.0},{"title":"I learned I'm unhelpful!","author":"MaeBuddy","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromRetail\/comments\/xn9zx7\/i_learned_im_unhelpful\/","text":"A couple weeks ago I had a fun customer at the jewelry counter.

Being a Friday night the store music was up a little bit and people were shopping and having a good time.

It didn't happen  so I walked past them and gave then a friendly hello, just to gauge what kind of a-hole I was dealing with. They looked the other way and pretended I didn't exist.

I have so many extreme stories but here\u2019s one that happened more recently. But before I vent into it, here\u2019s some background information: \n\nI\u2019m a very friendly, extroverted person so I thought working in customer service would be perfect for me! Boy was I ever so wrong. I forgot that I sometimes get an attitude when people are \u201cKaren\u2019s\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m a cashier\/advisor for a skincare company. I love my company and my coworkers! However, our costumers tend to be 3 things : older than 35, wealthy and white. \n\nI\u2019m a short, 24 year old multiethnic girl and one day it was my opening shift. Our store is so small that there only needs to be 1 person as an opener. Esp during the weekdays when it\u2019s slow.\n\n It\u2019s a slow Monday and at around 11 a family comes in. Beaming, beautiful and friendly. They spoke Spanish so I assumed they were Latino\/latina and I was at ease to see people that looked like me and were so kind and were purchasing a lot of products too! \n\nAt my job, we do \u201cfree gifts with purchases\u201d worth $35+ in 2 tiers: low tier is a small gift with purchase when you spend $65 and the high tier is a large gift when you spend $95. A lot of people will try and cheat the system to eat multiple gifts so we have kinda strict rules. We can not combine free gifts and we can only do 1 per customer. However, on rare occasion we may make an exception. We only get so many for about 1 month, so in fine print on all our signs it says \u201cFree gifts per 1 customer only\u201d so other customers can get their free gift.\n\nThis family gives me their customer \u201cVIP\u201d information and says they shopped with us  often. I was confused because their customer history was blank and I have never seen them. But thought that maybe it was a computer error and that maybe they just haven\u2019t shopped while i was at work. \n\nThe family later asks that since they\u2019re spending so much money if they could get 8 free gifts. Their total was about $800. I told them that our policy says we can only give 1 gift per customer but that I would be willing to make an exception and give them 2 low tier gifts and 2 high tier gifts because HOLY FUCK an $800 sale. \n\nThe Husband looks furious. Eyes Wide! Lies and says \u201cWe come here often and we always get multiple gift with purchases.\u201d I explained that if that was true that it wasn\u2019t going to happen with me as the best exception I could do was 4. I also said \u201ci don\u2019t have to give you any at all but I\u2019m trying to work with you on our policy.\u201d I also explained we had limited quantity and we need other customers to have access to these gifts. \n\nHe looks at me disgusted and says \u201cWhy would I care about the other customers? What are they to me?\u201d I got annoyed because I love my job and the regulars that come in and said, \u201cYou may not care about the other customers but this company does\u201d he storms out and the women (sister and mother) left except the wife. She continues to ask for more gifts and lies about our policy. She gets her bags and leaves, and the husband returns back YELLING at me. \n\n\nOur exact conversation:\n\n[him yelling]: \u201cI am complaining to customer service! You are supposed to listen to customers and not speak. You are not supposed to explain anything.\u201d  \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s no true.\u201d Shaking my head saying this repeatedly.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything. You are new here, I have never seen you before!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here for almost 3 years and I have never seen YOU before.\u201d\n\n\u201c3 years is nothing! There\u2019s a difference between smart people making more money than you and why you\u2019re working here.

Now, I can't give him too much hate, since he was shot in the head a long time ago, and still has the scar to show it. Now, this lead to him having, uhm...  special privileges. Lets just say that he can get more then a military discount from the local bakery, and I will let you all figure out what I mean. Because no matter what you think, the answer is \"Yes, he can get that too.\" But don't mistake this as me hating him for his condition. I respect him for his service, and he usually is kind. Just, well, he has his moments. Today is one of those moments.\n\nAnyways, he comes into our small store, and starts sweeping thru, grabbing about $300 worth of stuff and hauls it up to our only till. Now, when I say $300, i mean $300+ after the military discount and state taxes, it was honestly closer to $330. So I tell him the total, and he nods his head, mumbles something and pulls out a thick wallet, full to the brim with credit cards. I mean, thicker then two thumbs of cards, and nothing but. And he doesn't even look down and pulls out the front most card.\n\nFew seconds later, my screen flashes; DECLINED. No problem, we can do the next card. What can possibly go wrong?\n\nDECLINED\n\nDECLINED\n\nDECLINED\n\nDECLINED\n\nA this point, I suggest that we can do cash or check. He shakes his head, and motions that he doesn't have either.

When the freak did you So he pays the rest off, all of the bills passed the UV and marker test. I give him his change, his bags of stuff, and am about to turn to the next customer when he says \"Auugh Uuu Ggoo Krrr Hsss?\". This thru me off, and I asked him to repeat himself, pretty please?\n\n\"Auugh Uuu Ggoo Krrr Hsss?\" \n\nYep, I didn't mishear him. He wants me to carry his bags out to his car. With me as the only retail worker in the store, and five-six people behind him.\nThankfully, a nice guy wearing a red shirt from the line realized what V wanted, and volunteered as tribute. He carried out V's stuff as I rung up everyone else's purchases. And bless you, Red Shirt, for he told me after coming back to buy his things, that V's car was 3 blocks away. Red Shirt, do know that if i could of make your purchases any more cheaper, i would of. But I do hope that you accept the secret military discount I snuck into your purchase.\n\nNow, I want to re-elaborate, I do not hate V for who he is, I just wanted to vent out about this matter. V is a chill dude, but dang, somedays I just want to just... slap him with a fish. \n\nAnyways, hope you lot enjoy, and may none of your cards decline.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1663450948.0},{"title":"Had to call the police on a customer \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f","author":"PlasticSprinkles4","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromRetail\/comments\/xh77ci\/had_to_call_the_police_on_a_customer\/","text":"I am the night manager of a grocery store and I got called to the front to deal with a wic customer. \nFor some reason she was still having a balance even though it looked like everything was coming off.

You can see how on a busy day, miss-placed shoes can cause a big fiasco if the customer receives a box of shoes to try on and its the completely wrong brand.\n\nThe family, however, had about 7 Nike boxes in their vicinity and when approached by staff to hand back any boxes they weren't interested in, their father insisted that they need to keep all of them near by. Sure, it is in the customers right to have all of the boxes to try on, but in a packed store where there are probably 30-50 people in the shoe section alone, it can cause a big crowd control problem.  \nWithin a span of 15-20 minutes or so I've been told, all the boxes that were requested by the family were gone and the father came to the supervisor with a concerning observation. \"My son's slippers are missing!\"\n\nThis isn't usually a rare occurrence at this store, as it's easily solved by having the person who took the family's boxes retrace their steps back in the warehouse. However, when questioned, none of the employees in the department admitted to having taken the boxes of shoes that the family had tried on (which meant, the family themselves returned the shoes to a box return area).\n\nTo add on to that, if a customer had replaced the store shoes with their own shoes in a box, it would be as simple as looking up where the store shoes belong in the warehouse. But apparently, the kid had placed both his slippers and the store shoes into the box.\n\nThe glaring issue was the store was filled to the brim with customers and they couldn't afford to dedicate staff that were working the department floor to the problem.\n\nThe supervisor (whose known for never leaving their desk-space) himself had to spend 20 minutes going through the aisles of the warehouse to find the box with the miss-placed slippers.\n\nTo cap it all off, he grilled every staff member before closing about a problem that wasn't in their control.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1661980798.0},{"title":"Monthly TFR Express Lane - Post your short retail anecdotes and pandemic-related experiences here!","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromRetail\/comments\/x35s8j\/monthly_tfr_express_lane_post_your_short_retail\/","text":"Welcome to \/r\/TalesFromRetail's Express Lane - your quick stop for short tales, pithy observations and general retail chat about how things are going with your store, your customers and yourselves.\n\nAny experiences with pandemic-related topics (mask issues, anti-vaxxer encounters, etc.) should also be posted here and not as a stand-alone tale.\n\nPlease [follow the rules](\/r\/TalesFromRetail\/wiki\/) regarding anonymity and derogatory speech.

At 11pm I\u2019d locked up everything except the one pump that was pay at the pump (you can choose to use your card there or to pay at the kiosk), and I went in the back to do the last paperwork and lock the safe up. I came out of the back at about 11:10pm and saw a middle aged man getting irate at the one pump that didn\u2019t have a padlock hanging from the handle, I still don\u2019t know how he didn\u2019t notice. \n\nSo, I unlocked the shop door and went out and very politely informed him that we closed at 11pm and I couldn\u2019t serve him and now needed to lock the pump.

This story just recently happened. \n\nJust for reference:\nMe - Me\nKaren - Customer\nCW - Co-Worker\n\nSo, I'm preparing to close down the self checkout where I'm stationed at bc the store is closing. While I am doing so, Karen comes and starts her order. This is fine, as there's still time left. Anyways, she calls me over to do an ID check for alcohol that she's buying. At our store, for alcohol and tobacco purchases, we have to check everyone's ID per company policy and it has to be a legal form of a government issued ID.\nI ask to see her ID. She pulls out her phone and shows me a picture of her ID. Of course, this is not acceptable as we have to have the physical ID to check. So I tell Karen that I cannot accept her ID photo. Karen begins to get upset with me asking why if it's her ID. I attempted to explain to her that it is illegal for me to accept her ID if it's not her physical ID. Of course, she still proceeds to argue with me about it, stating that it's her ID and that I'm just making things more difficult than it is. I once again explained that I'm simply following state law and company policy and that I could risk losing my job if I violated them by proceeding with the alcohol purchase. \nI then take her alcohol as she's talking on the phone with someone else. As she does, she walked over to CW and attempted to explain to her the situation to try to get CW to side with her. I once again explained to Karen in front of CW that it is illegal for us to use her ID on her phone for alcohol purchases, and CW backed me up on it. She walks back to her SCO register in a huff. \nMoments later, Karen calls me back over and asks me to bring the alcohol I took from her. I oblige, but only to see what she was trying to pull. I noticed another customer standing next to her and I thought, \"Please tell me she's not trying to use another person's ID to get alcohol\". Sure enough, that's exactly what Karen was trying to do, and I had to shut that down as well because it is also illegal and against policy to use someone else's ID to purchase your alcohol or tobacco. This of course upsets Karen even further, and she tells me that I'm not going to lose my job because it's not illegal if she's over the age of 21. I explain to her that it doesn't matter how old you are, I still need a valid ID. \nShe finally accepts defeat, although she was talking crap about me behind my back on the phone, I'm sure, and leaves the store with the rest of her purchase. I feel bad for her, but I cannot and will not risk my job just so a customer can get their $30 bottle of alcohol.\n\nTL;DR: Karen tries to show her ID on phone for alcohol. I decline the sale. She then tries to argue with me and circumvent the rules. I shut her down.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention that I'm on mobile, so if format looks weird, I apologize.\n\n2nd edit: I just woke up and saw this got some attention. Cool. Thanks everyone for the support. Also, to answer some ppl's questions about virtual apps for IDs, I live in Ohio, and that hasn't rolled out yet here, but if it did, it might affect policy at my company.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1661400809.0},{"title":"Customer goes from 0-100 because we tried to explain how we could solve his problem","author":"Squishy_Newspaper","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromRetail\/comments\/wwpne1\/customer_goes_from_0100_because_we_tried_to\/","text":"Obligatory this didn\u2019t happen to me, but I overheard the whole thing.\n\nA customer walked up to the counter yesterday and said that his travel cup that he bought had a small leak on the rim when he drank from it and he wanted to exchange it.

If he wanted to exchange it for the same model we could not guarantee that the next one would not leak either, however he would be happy to test it for him to see for sure.\n\nThe customer then got aggressive and started almost yelling at my manager that his friend has the same cup, his doesn\u2019t leak, and his friend said that the cup leaking is a defect so he either wants an exchange for a cup that doesn\u2019t leak or his money back.\n\nMy manger again calmly explains that the leak is not a defect, since the cup is not leakproof, but he would still be happy to exchange or refund the cup. He just wants the customer to be aware that if he gets the same one it may leak on him again. \n\nThey have this back and forth for about 5 minutes with my manager calmly explaining that the cup isn\u2019t leakproof and all the solutions he can provide, and the customer yelling that the leak is a defect because his friend said so. \n\nMy manager eventually gets the customer to calm down and he shows him the other travel cups we have that are made to be leakproof, but the customer doesn\u2019t want any of them because they don\u2019t have a handle.\n\nEventually the customer just exchanges his cup for the same model, hoping that this next one doesn\u2019t leak  (we did end up testing the new one for him and it did the same thing his current one does because the cup is not made to be leak proof, we explained this to him and he took it anyway) all the while still saying that the leak is a defect because his friend told him so.\n\nMy manager ended the conversation by giving the customer tips on how to take the cup apart when cleaning it to hopefully get out the excess liquid getting trapped in the lid, which might be contributing to the leak. The customer said that he wasn\u2019t going to put that much effort into cleaning his cup every time he used it and that he was just going to hope it didn\u2019t leak because his friend said the leak was a defect.\n\nThis may seem tame compared to some of the stories on here, but the way the customer went from understanding to blind rage was astounding. Plus his refusal to understand that we were trying our best to solve his problem, just that the best solution wasn\u2019t what he originally wanted, was just astounding to listen to.\n\nUPDATE: the customer came back in yesterday while I was off and started complaining that he couldn\u2019t get the cup back together when he took it apart to clean it because he wasn\u2019t paying attention when my manager explained it to him. \n\nWhen my coworker tried to show him how to put it together he just complained more that my coworker was doing it wrong and that his way way different than how the instructions said to do it.

We also sold the curtain material on its own. \n\nMost customers were affluent and spent a lot on curtains, and we offered a measuring service before finalising the order. Occasionally, we would offer free making on a range of discontinued and discounted fabrics we wanted to get rid of, and that brought a more thrifty kind of customer. \n\nOne woman came in with her window measurements, not interested in the free measure. She had measured her windows top edge to the floor, and side edge to side edge. She chose her fabric, and I worked out her quote. \n\nIt was substantially more than she expected, and she accused me of basically selling her more than she needed to make up for the free making. \n\nI tried to explain that: \n\nA) For her width of window she really needed two and a half widths in each curtain (so five widths) so that the curtains would cover the whole window once the top gathering tape (known then as \u201cpinch pleat\u201d) was gathered. Otherwise they wouldn\u2019t cover the window. I also explained that other gathering tape styles would need fewer widths (with the bare minimum 1.5 widths) but obviously the curtains wouldn\u2019t be as full. \n\nB) she had picked a fabric with a large pattern repeat that needed matching (like you would with wallpaper).\n\nC) she needed to include an allowance for hemming\/joining and\n\nD) most curtain rails extend at least a little bit past the window edges. \n\nShe picked up the quote and the explanatory doodles I\u2019d made, ripped it in two and almost screeched \u201cdo you think I\u2019m stupid?\u201d.

That way, the sales staff wouldn\u2019t have to order a new one, they can replace it with something different, and that way the customer would get their piece of furniture rather quickly. We didn\u2019t have storage, so it\u2019s one of those things where if it\u2019s on the floor, it would be our only one. \n\nSo this one day, a customer bought a couch off the floor, asking it to be delivered. \n\nMe and a coworker later in the day prep the couch, groaning amongst ourselves because it was a sofa bed. And those things are heavy and awkward, especially when you have to get into houses. \n\nWe load up, wrap the couch up, and deliver it. It takes us about 15 minutes to get through the narrow doors, and setting it in the customers living room. \n\nAs we unwrap the couch, checking over everything to make sure everything worked correctly, including the pull out bed, suddenly the customer says \u201cThat\u2019s not the couch I ordered.\u201d\n\nWe ask her what she means, and she replied \u201cI did not order a sofa bed.\u201d I told her this was the couch that was on our show floor that she picked out. She argued back that it\u2019s the same style, but the one she wanted didn\u2019t have a sofa bed. \n\nWe again told her that this is the very one she looked at on the floor, because we carried it out of the show room after she bought it, and that there is a tag on there very clearly saying it\u2019s a sofa bed. \n\nShe said she didn\u2019t want it if it was a sofa bed, so me and my coworker told her she\u2019s gonna have to call the associate she bought the unit from. \n\nShe calls, and I can hear her asking the associate why she got a sofa bed. The associate informed her that, that was the very couch she picked. And that she didn\u2019t mention she did not want a sofa bed. That she only saw the couch, sat on it, and said she wanted to buy it. \n\nShe told the associate it\u2019s no good to her because it has a sofa bed. So my associate told us over the phone to bring it back, and informed the customer she\u2019ll be refunded the money back for the couch, but not the delivery fee. \n\nThe customer was a little annoyed by that, apparently since she thought she was returning the couch, she should get the delivery fee refunded. \n\nMe and my coworker just loaded the couch back up, and brought it back to the store.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1661020118.0},{"title":"there were signs everywhere.","author":"Sea_Standard_4695","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromRetail\/comments\/wsav0k\/there_were_signs_everywhere\/","text":"Hey there, first post here. \n\nSo i work at a grocery store and a while ago the network for paying with your card broke down.

Pokemon trading cards have just been released and the store stocks them because we sell the Gameboy Pokemon games. We, the floor staff, wish we didn\u2019t.  \n\nYou see, the Australian importer\/distributor grossly underestimated how popular the cards would be. Nationally, there is a shortage of cards. One delivery, we ordered 25 boxes of 12 packets and received just 2 boxes. We refer customers to other stores and they are referring customers to us, fruitlessly. At the store, because supply was so unreliable, we had to put in policies of: no customer orders, no pre-payment, no holds, not even waiting lists. To avoid the constant questions, we have A3 signs explaining this all, set up at the front of the store, on the entertainment department counter and the Pokemon shelves. We even left the empty boxes on the shelf (a merchandising no-no) to show the customers we just don\u2019t have any cards for sale. There is disappointment, anger and tears, and that\u2019s just the parents.\nAnd then she walks in.  \n$SS: our eponymous hero  \n$MM: shrieking demoness mother, who is yelling from the outset.

We never saw her again while I was working there as she would catch additional charges if she ever came near me again.\n\nI went shopping at my old store about a month ago however, and was chatting with another long time employee, apparently that same woman cornered her in the parking lot after work like a week before to beg her to get me to drop the assault charges so that's pretty wack. The employee is fine, she actually thought it was funny when she was telling me, considering in Canada it's the police that press charges, not the victims.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1660021665.0},{"title":"Dude is NOT asleep","author":"Smooth_Youth_5516","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromRetail\/comments\/wjj6y5\/dude_is_not_asleep\/","text":"Happened a couple years ago when I was working retail, it was maybe 15 minutes before closing and there was only a couple customers in the store and just me and the manager at the time.

Which was stupid, and pissed off everyone, particularly the old folks that came in. But anywho, not the point here. Most people told me that they could not figure out how to use the self-checkout and asked for help. Which on it\u2019s own, was bizarre to me. Like it pretty much yells directions at you, and you can\u2019t figure out how to use it? It tells you to scan your items, it tell you to insert your cash or card. Not sure where the confusion is. But whatever, my job was to do the self-checkout for them. Super awkward doing very basic tasks for another adult. This particular individual was being very rude. They were FUMING that \u201cthey\u201d had to use the self-check out. They asked if we were going out of business since there were no registers open. I explained that management had directed staff to stay out in the green zone with the customers. But they were losing it. I was doing it for them, but they were so mad that they had to \u201cdo it themselves.\u201d So im super petty in return. I scanned all their items and pressed all the prompts to set it up for them to pay. And then i walked away and told them they could pay now. Mind you, i knew they wouldn\u2019t be able to figure out how to put their cash in the machine. I could just tell. But i walked away, cuz the machine shows you where to put your bills and there is green flashing arrows. So i was mentally like c\u2019mon, you can figure this out right? Just use your eyeballs. It\u2019s not hard. So i walked away and busied myself with my normal tasks, like planograms. This customer stood there clueless and fuming for 5 minutes because they didn\u2019t know where to put their dollar bills in. They started yelling at the machine and yelling in general at no one in particular, so i eventually came back at point at the green flashing slot. And said that is where the cash goes. They yelled that the machines are stupid and way too hard to use. So like yea, i was petty, but they were rude to me and not using their brain. If you can\u2019t tell, retail was not for me.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1658437480.0},{"title":"Late night karma.","author":"Due-Equivalent-1489","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromRetail\/comments\/w4645p\/late_night_karma\/","text":"So I work the closing shift at my store as a cashier.

Which ends at 11pm. \n\nOn my last shift I had I got approached by the third shift maintenance worker; maintenance is the ones who sweep, mop, change garbages and the like. Well she is a nice person who unfortunately has declining health so things are getting harder for her to do. What she approached me about though was that a group of three teenage boys were going around and leaving a mess throughout the store. So when she saw them trying to ditch a product she asked them to put it back where they got it from. They ignored her and left it while going deeper in the store. I picked up the item and put it in our shop back section. She said it more as a venting thing how she\u2019d not ring them up and went about her job. \n\nWhen the teens returned they go to the self scan registers and begin to ring up. One has a slingshot and ammo in his order, his buddy at the other register has ammo, the third is just on his phone chatting. As the registers do their alert for me to come over and do an age check I come up and inform them as they are a group I need all three of them to present IDs. The one with the slingshot asks if they have to be 18 but doesn\u2019t give me a chance to answer or even check if it is 16,17 or 18. He says just take them off. Which I do. \n\nHe then asks why -insert competitor store- a town away doesn\u2019t require them to be 18 but we do. I just say \u201cBecause they are not us.\u201d They try and ask me a bunch of things to try and convince me to sell to them. All in front of my direct supervisor who is watching in silence as it is that slow half an hour to close. I say I\u2019m not losing my job for them to have it. If they pick up a rock which would do more damage than some \u2018little glass beads\u2019 like they say they could do it isn\u2019t me selling them a product. And that the one who claims to be 18 is not old enough to be their parent so I still need all IDs to approve the sales.\n\nThey leave and make some snarky comments. Then to make the third shift worker\u2019s night a little better I tell her all this and she laughed and said I probably saved some squirrels from being killed by the teens. \n\nSo I got to be the \u2018bearded man in a kilt\u2019 who ruined the night of some cocky teens\u2019 night.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1658374221.0},{"title":"\u201cThen I guess it won\u2019t stay soft\u201d","author":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromRetail\/comments\/w3oa0p\/then_i_guess_it_wont_stay_soft\/","text":"Okay so the company I work for sells woman\u2019s clothing, and there\u2019s a section that\u2019s specifically made for loungewear, and it\u2019s known for being super soft.\n\nHere\u2019s the issue, which is not new for clothes in general, it doesn\u2019t stay as soft as when you first buy it.

I was working a closing shift at my current department store job. For the most part it was a normal shift. I work on the floor folding clothes, emptying fitting rooms etc. Now for context the store recently had a sale where clearance items were an additional 50% off. Meaning all those clothes were very cheap. Also for context my mom works part time there as well and was closing with me.\n\nSo about half an hour before we close I notice a group of two women and some kids. They're in the woman's clearance section and I immediately notice they have a full cart of clothes. I think nothing of it except feeling sorry for the cashier on duty because that looks like a pain. We have had a few people through the day fill up their carts with clearance to take advantage of the deal.\n\nCut to closing I finish my tasks and start heading to the back. Everything is normal I see my mom and sit down to wait as my mom likes to wait until the closing manager locks up the store to leave. About fifteen minutes pass closing the closing manager walks in and dismisses everyone waiting out back.\n\nThe reason, turns out the same group as before walked up about five minutes before closing. Turns out they had two more carts full of clothes that. And normally what most closing managers do is people with larger orders come up close to clothing is tell them the registers is closed and they can buy their clothes the next day. However, today the main manager of the store happened to be closing this night and he doesn't want to risk losing any money. Even though corporate has been on the store about payroll (due to a lot of people working unapproved overtime and our store having low sales).\n\nMy mom and I look at each other in disbelief when we see it. We quickly leave and start our way home. Both of us ranting about how the manager shouldn't have done that. Luckily for the story my mom is good friends with one of the cashiers working that night. He wasn't the one ringing out but stayed to closed the register when the transaction was complete. Almost a whole hour later my mom gets a message from him saying the women are finally leaving. Meaning everyone who had to stay behind were stuck for over an hour after close. We're supposed to leave half an hour at most.\n\nHonestly all I can say is for same on the manager.

First a little background\nI worked in a very small, family owned store that sold live seafood, primarily lobsters. The store was in the northwest US so we sometimes had some local seafood also. One time, we had just gotten in a fresh shipment of Dungeness Crab. Dungeness Crab is  delicious but it does not last very long so buying the crab alive is the best way to preserve freshness. \nThe store had enormous salt water tanks to keep the crab in, but to take them home, we would wrap them in newspapers (did I mention that this was a long time ago?). Crab are pretty easy to handle if you know how but if you are careless, they have claws that can feel like a pair of big vice grips. Crab are helpless if you lay them on their back.  To wrap them up , you simply lay them on their back next to the corner of the piece of newspaper and wrap the corner of the paper over the crab.  The crab will fold its legs in because its vital organs are on the bottom. Once it has its legs folded in, you just wrap the sides of the newspaper over it from both sides and roll it up in the paper.  To cook it, you just grab the outermost corner of the newspaper and hold it over the pot of boiling water and the crab just unrolls and ends up in the pot.\n\nOne day, this dad comes into the store with two sons who were both pre-teen, and the dad wanted to order some crabs.   Occasionally, people who bought crab made an issue of whether the crabs had all of their legs. It is not uncommon to find a crab who is missing a leg or two.  Since they were sold by the pound, most people didn\u2019t care that much.  But this dad wanted to inspect the crabs I was giving him so he came around behind the counter where I had laid them down on their backs on the table so I could weigh them.   He evidently wanted to impress the boys that were with him because he picked one up to show it to the boys. I didn\u2019t know what his experience with crabs was and plus I was just a kid myself so I just let him handle the crab .  The crab was almost able to get its pincher claw on the guy\u2019s hand and he must have known how strong those little suckers are because he quickly put the crab back down. Unfortunately this genius put the crab down on its legs. Crabs spend some of their time out of the water and so they can run pretty fast to keep away from gulls and other birds who love to eat them.  So once this crab was on its legs, it took off running. It fell off the counter and landed on the floor. Still on its legs it began running toward the darkest place it could see which was under the big cooking pot we had for cooking the crabs.   If it got under there, it would be very difficult to get back so I literally had to jump on it to grab it.  I ended up getting my hand under the crab but I had it too far under the crab and the crab was able to reach the end my fingers with its claws.  As soon as it got a grip on my finger, it felt like someone was gripping my finger with vice grips and it hurt worse than anything I had previously experienced in my brief 17 years of life. I also knew that crabs have two of these pinchers and the crab was trying to grab me with its other claw, so I had to act fast.  I was able to flop the crab back on the table on its back but when I looked at my finger, I started to feel dizzy and I knew I was about to pass out from the trauma. I know it was just my finger but the pain was intense.  I somehow managed to keep the crab from grabbing me with its other claw and also to grab a knife out of the knife rack.  I stabbed the crab right in the middle where I had learned it\u2019s heart is. As soon as the crab was stabbed, the pressure on my finger subsided so I was able get loose from the crab before I passed out.  \n\nI wasn\u2019t actually conscious for the next part but evidently the dad backed away and one of my coworkers wrapped up his crabs and he quickly exited the shop.  When I came to, I was laying down on the floor of the office with my hand in a pan of cold water.  Somehow the owner of the store didn\u2019t think to include a First Aid kit as part of the essentials of running the business. Fortunately one of my female coworkers had bandages in her purse so I was able to at least stem the bleeding. The swelling was still pretty bad and my fingertip was shredded. \nThat bozo left with two live crabs and one dead one.  I only hope he tried to pick up one of the live one\u2019s himself   Sorry that the idiot wasn\u2019t the one who suffered in this story but I only worked in retail for a few short years   This experience was enough to convince me to choose a non-retail career.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1656916133.0},{"title":"\u201cWe Are Disability Friendly\u201d","author":"TheShining02","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromRetail\/comments\/vqkzjm\/we_are_disability_friendly\/","text":"I wanted to post something good on this subreddit that might bring a little happiness to your life. \n\nI (19F) work at a dollar store as a sales associate in rural United States.

Please excuse my spelling and grammar errors. I know they are there, im just not going to edit it right now. Sorry, kind of sorry. \n\nThe past 3 days we've been dealing with a nice enough couple, id say in their late 30s who just started a family and are renovating their home. They are only planning on living there for a few years, so the resell value was a factor for them. \n\nContext: I work as a designer at a tile and flooring company helping people select materials. \n\nThis couple booked an appointment with my coworker we will call C. She's been in the industry for year's and through a series of unfortunately timed buy-outs, her high-end showroom closed, so she ended up here. I'm lucky to work with someone with so much experience, knowledge, and taste. So she is who you really want if you don't have any idea what youre doing. \n\nThe first day they came in, C worked with them for nearly 4 hours (our appointments are usually around an hour), and the woman just couldn't make up her mind. She didn't pay attention when they were walking the showroom and had to go back and look again, and C was getting so frusturated, but pulled through and by the time they left the couple had bought the materials they needed and they seemed confident and happy with the design. The overnight team pulls their order to store in the warehouse to pick up in a few days. \n\nWell, the next day I see that they made another appointment with C, and I offer to help her with the couple since she was so frusturated the day before, I figured I could offer a second opinion and support C and grab samples and whatnot.  Instead of picking out their flooring and fireplace ledger, this woman wanted to focus on the bathrooms because she changed her mind from the day before. This takes nearly two hours. Fine. They make their changes to their order, pay the difference and seemed confident and happy with their selection.\n\nThe next day she calls the store and said there's an issue  with theiout oourchase and she was over charged. C puts her on hold and reviews the first order, the changes and additions they made the day before and confirms the amount with the cashier who rang them up. The cadhier, we will call CC, audited all of their transactions and meticulously combed through everything confirming the charges were accurate. Well, while C, and CC we're doing this, she hung up and called back. Another employee, not in the design department answered and she made even more changes to this fricking order! \n\nCC decided that she would refund the previous transactions and ring in the latest updated order to simplify evetything. The MOD literally said no. She will not be making changes or purchases over the phone and she needed to come in and deal with our ops manager because this can not continue. This woman literally cannot make up her mind and will get sat down and told that we will not be able to keep making changes to her order and if shes uncertain she can just take samples home and come back when she is. \n\nThe thing is though, she spent 6 hours with a designer, only to disregard Cs advice and my input as well. Why work with a designer if youre not going to listen anyway?!? 6 hours of one on one attention when it takes most people an hour or less to choose, and you still change your order 3 tucking times! \n\nShe's a sweet woman, but goddamn! There not even planning on living there for more than 3 years! I've never met someone so indecisive in my entire life! I can't wait to see how works out when she comes ito today.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1656347474.0},{"title":"Treat People Better, Ma\u2019am","author":"Immediate_Area9178","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromRetail\/comments\/vlwn1n\/treat_people_better_maam\/","text":"Happened a few days ago.

Chris continues to stand there, still confused, while the two keep screeching at him. They scream for a few minutes about using the self checkouts, wanting to talk to a manager, and then again about a register being opened. Finally one them decides they can head to customer service to be rung up by a \u201creal person\u201d. \n\nLady 1: -loud enough for everyone to hear- He\u2019s a little b*tch.\n\nChris: -speechless over what just happened-\n\nAt this point I finally got over being stunned and realized I had an advantage: I didn\u2019t have a uniform on. I was also off the clock.\n\nI walked over to the two wild Karens who were craning their necks looking for someone at the customer service desk. Completely ignoring the long line of people only a few feet away. \n\nMe: Excuse me, ma\u2019am? That was my coworker you were yelling at. \n\nLady 1: What?!\n\nMe: That young man you were yelling at is my coworker. \n\nLady 2: What\u2019s it matter?!\n\nMe: Please don\u2019t yell at him, he was covering for me so I could go home. \n\nAt this point both ladies focused their rage on me and started squabbling. Demanding answers and explanations for a register being opened. And then they both turned around and walked a few paces away, talking with each other, and then came back to me. \n\nLady 1: -very loudly- What it matter? You should hire more people!\n\nMe: -hands are shaking now as I raise my voice- Because you need to treat people better.\n\nI was kind of expecting them to keep screaming or to walk away and ignore me. I didn\u2019t expect both of them to freeze and their expressions of anger to melt away to be replaced with a dumbfounded expressions. Lady 1\u2019s mouth was open as if she was trying to put something together while Lady 2 just gave me the blankest stare I\u2019ve ever seen. \n\nI fixed them with the dirtiest look I could, went to Chris to apologize for not acting sooner, and then left. Apparently after I left one of them put down the bottle of bug killer she was buying and they both left without a word or speaking to a manager. And no calls have come in about the incident either.

And I won't pretend it isn't. I own a particular customer who comes in and gets a couple of smaller items. Usually when its like this I don't default to asking if they need a bag. This customer stands there and waits until I ask them if I need a bag and they shrug and say, \"Sure.\" dismissively. Like they weren't waiting for one and for me to ask. I started recognizing the behavior from the customer and a couple of times if they came in, I'd just go and grab the bag without asking and they'd say, \"Nah I don't need it.\" and leave.

It was closing, and I was ringing up the last customers, and this couple (a man and a woman) comes up with a pair of jeans and four items on clearance. The jeans are currently half off, and clearance is buy one get one free right now.\n\nI rung them up for the jeans first, and they paid using store credit. After the receipt printed, I saw they had a balance of $41.33 left and let them know. Then I rang them up for two of the clearance items, and the man put his credit card in the chip reader and let me know they had two more items and was asking the cost regarding the promotion. I told them that they could\u2019ve added it to this transaction as doing a separate transaction doesn\u2019t make much of a difference as the amounts still add up the same. So the man decided not to do a third transaction and just add the other two clearance items to the second transaction. I had them cancel the card payment so I could add the last two items, and proceeded to finish their transaction which amounted to about $16.\n\nI was mainly confused by their thought process as to how breaking up the transaction makes a difference. I personally thought they should\u2019ve put everything in one transaction as they had enough store credit to cover all of it, but I understand they probably wanted to save the $41.33 for another time which is why they used a credit card for the clearance stuff. I do think it was a bit inconsiderate of them as we were closing, but at least I was able to show them that a third separate transaction would be unnecessary.\n\nEdit: buy one get one free isn\u2019t one per transaction where I work, it applies for every two items part of the promo.","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1656330189.0},{"title":"customer insists I'm new at this store despite not only having seen me before","author":"pokehokage","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromRetail\/comments\/vl1xal\/customer_insists_im_new_at_this_store_despite_not\/","text":"So this happened a few minutes ago.

And she said she still couldn't hear me, and actually started making fun of me for having a quiet voice. (It's worth noting that I have a lung condition that makes it physically difficult and painful to raise my voice.) So I tried one last time to raise my voice a bit more so that she could hear me, and it makes my voice come out sounding strained since it's physically painful for me to do so.\n\nAnd then she just kinda stops and stares at me for a second and then goes \"...

I didn't like that. That was hostile.\"\n\nAnd I'm legitimately super confused and startled, because I genuinely didn't mean for it to come out that way, and didn't even think it came out that way at all? I didn't yell or act snippy or anything, I just spoke up a bit louder in a genuine attempt to get her to hear me. And I tried to explain myself and apologize, basically, \"I'm really sorry if that came across as rude, ma'am, I promise I didn't mean it that way. I have a problem with my lungs that makes raising my voice painful, and I really apologize if my tone sounded curt. I really didn't mean it.\" \n\nAnd she just looks at me and goes, \"Oh, gee, well, *I'm* sorry for being *ALIVE!* I mean, wow, sorry I bothered you, right?!\" super sarcastically and rolls her eyes at me, and the lady behind her backs her up, glaring daggers at me, going \"Yeah, no, that wasn't okay.

I worked in gaming retail on and off for about 8 years and I have *so many stories.* My customer service was always ranked in the top 10 in whichever position\/district I happened to be working in and I only say that because I also do not take any nonsense from customers, so my performance was often the only reason why I kept my job after all was said and done. Confirmed by all of the managers and district leaders that I've worked with. There's countless \"yes I am smiling at you but I am only being nice because I am paid to\" stories, even more \"akshually, female, ur wrong\" (when I was, akshually, correct) stories, but I've got a few good gems that I love to share. I worked in over a dozen gaming retail locations across a \\~50 mile radius and, to be clear, I absolutely love all of the friends I've made during this experience. Even with all of the threats, s\\*xual harassment, stalking, and (of course) Karens, I'd do it all again.\n\nOnto my earliest story. I first worked in a mall and y'all know that mall security will do absolutely nothing for you unless you hysterically sob\/are legitimately threatened with a weapon the person has in their hands. Or maybe it was just that one place and they sucked, idk. I was often working alone in a very small store and it was slow. Sometimes other mall workers that I befriended would come hang out on their breaks but otherwise the only people in the store were me and customers. All of the stores in the area got alerted to a rash of thefts that involved someone distracting one co-worker with questions while the other worker was too busy ringing up the line of customers. Apparently, these fiends did not scope out my store beforehand because there was no other worker and there was no line for my entire shift.\n\nIt was within an hour of closing so I pull out a box from the back room to prepare for a new game launch the next day (my store had a locked drawer in the front for them). We did NOT have the hours to stay more than 30mins after closing so I almost kinda didn't have a choice but to do this while the store was still open. I was used to this and took every precaution; keeping everything hidden away if a customer came in, not letting the box leave my sight, etc. This box must've looked like the holy grail to this group of thieves because right after I sliced it open, the first one walked in. He was very charismatic, smiling while he spoke, asked me a bunch of questions and my opinion on things. Another guy walked in a few minutes later and immediately went to an area behind me, where he'd have a straight line to the area behind the counter (where my box was). I greeted him as he entered and I'd like to believe that this is when they both started to hesitate and think \"oh god, she noticed me\/him\". Who knows but I'm the main character in this story and I'm going to say that's what happened but they were apparently desperate.\n\nFirst guy suddenly said that he was looking for a specific item for his girlfriend and, surely by pure coincidence, that item was up high in an area that was not near my box. I walk to the backroom and keep the door open (100% line of sight on my box behind the counter, still) while I grab the ladder to grab this mans item from up above. He's on my heels the entire time trying to chat me up and I'm being polite as I climb the ladder. The moment I turn my head away to look at what I'm reaching for, I hear these hard and heavy footsteps behind me and, honestly, my first thought was that someone was about to attack me. But no. It was Guy #2 and I whipped my head around at the sound and saw him with a handful of copies of this (hitherto unreleased!) game in his filthy, stealing hands. I immediately start screaming \"ARE YOU F&$%ING KIDDING ME? ARE YOU SERIOUS? PUT THAT SH%$ BACK RIGHT NOW. RIGHT NOW.\" pointing at the box, and he does. I'm screeching from atop my high ground on top of the ladder so I continue with \"NOW GET THE F(\\*# OUT OF MY STORE.\" now pointing at the door; exit Guy #2. All the while, charismatic first guy is politely smiling up at me seemingly unfazed by this interaction and as demon horns sprout from my forehead and I yell \"YOU TOO.\" to which he tries to sputter that he doesn't know him, he just wants to buy the thing, and in my increasingly feral voice I tell him, \"I DONT GIVE A SH&7. I'M NOT STUPID. GET OUT.\" And he proceeds to leave without a word. \n\nI alert the local stores that they tried to hit my store, I double-check to make sure all of the copies are there (they are), alert my manager of what just happened, and go along with closing everything up. My favorite part of this story is that, unbeknownst to me, the security camera caught ***absolutely everything***. Including the audio. I came back a few days later for my next shift and was commended by my team for how I reacted and was told that the entire district had received the video of my very threatening (as a 5'4'' teenager) actions. I was concerned at first because I was a new promotion, but absolutely everyone up top was laughing hysterically.\n\nNeedless to say, I believe that was my retail origin story. I had become known amongst colleagues as the chick who screamed and cursed two thieves out of my store with zero merchandise, alone.

She breezes past the line, interrupts the exchange I am having with a customer, and, reading from a slip of paper, spouts off \u201cDo you have a (insert series of random letters and numbers)\u201d\n\nI pause, think about what it might be, and say \u201cI am sorry, but I don\u2019t know offhand what that might be.  As you can see (pointing to the line) there are a lot of people waiting.  I will get to you just as soon as I can\u201d\n\nCue huffing, eye rolling and, to my surprise, stomping to the end of the line.  She actually did wait for her turn, which also surprised me.\n\nSo, 30 minutes later, it\u2019s her turn, and she reads aloud the seemingly random series of letters and numbers again.  I\u2019m a pretty visual person, so hearing the code didn\u2019t make any sense to me.  I asked \u201cCould I please see your piece of paper?\u201d  \n\nShe hands over the paper and, once I saw the part number, I immediately recognized it as being a part that we did not stock.  Oops.\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry ma\u2019am, but we don\u2019t stock that part.\u201d\n\nPart of me was quite pleased to be able answer her question.  She didn\u2019t share my happy vibe \u2026\n\nI don\u2019t remember exactly what she said to me, but it seemed to take a long time for her to say.  I do seem to remember several references to my lack of usefulness, aspersions being cast upon the store, several laudatory comments as to the value of her time and how I had callously disregarded her overall importance by wasting said time.  I do believe that she felt that making her speech at full volume would increase the impact and my overall understanding of her position.\n\nInsert stomping off in a rage, never to be seen again.\n\nNow, in all fairness to her, I can see that it would have been a frustrating situation.  If I had looked at the slip of paper to start with, she could\u2019ve been on her way.  That being said (typed?) I didn\u2019t want to get involved with a queue-jumper and piss off all of the other customers who were patiently waiting.\n\nOn the plus side, all the other folks waiting to see me who witnessed the tirade were super nice to me afterwards!\n\nNot overly dramatic.

For those not familiar with them, it\u2019s a large flat bed truck with a crane on it to unload material. \n\nThis customer had ordered a bunch of heavy decking material for a family member, so it was being delivered on my truck. \n\nWhen I arrive, the house was one of those units where 4 other houses were directly connected to each other, so the only way to the back yard was through the house. \n\nThe customer thought I could get the material over the roof into the back yard, but my boom doesn\u2019t have that kind of reach. So the only way was to take each material one at a time and go through the house. \n\nThe customer pointed that just behind their back yard fence, was a cul-de-sac, and behind the fence was a little picket ball court. He told me I could enter the cul-de-sac, park on the court, then I could reach my boom into the back yard. \n\nI verified with him if there would be no problems, and that the court and everything wasn\u2019t private property. He assured me it would be fine, and anything that goes wrong, he would bear the responsibility.\n\nSo I enter the cul-de-sac, inspect the court to make sure it could handle the weight of my truck, then pull forward, and unload my order into their back yard. \n\nDuring that time, a few people in the cul-de-sac came out of their house, watching the show as I boomed the order into the back yard. One guy came up to me, talking about how amazing it was to be able to deliver something like that while not have to do it by hand. \n\nEverything goes without a hitch, and i fold my boom back up to its driving position, as the customers write me a check. \n\nThere was a little discrepancy with the total amount, so I phone down to the store to find out the correct total. As I\u2019m talking to a store worker, this guy drives up in this big pick up truck, and yells at me \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d \n\nI respond that was was making a delivery to the house behind the fence. He\u2019s yelling \u201cYou can\u2019t park your truck on that. That\u2019s a brand new court, you\u2019re gonna f\u2026..in wreck it. That\u2019s private property.\u201d \n\nI replied that I was following the instructions of the customer, and they were the ones who told me to park here.\n\nHe still yelling \u201cWell, you\u2019re gonna pay for that if there is any damage.\u201d \n\nAt this point, the customer is poking his head over the fence, telling the guy to calm down, that they would be the ones to fix any damage. But the guy keeps yelling about how he doesn\u2019t care, that I shouldn\u2019t be there etc.\n\nThe next little bit was a blur because I was both on the phone, and everything went 0 to a 100. I remember the customer yelling \u201cTalk to me like that, I\u2019m gonna hop over this fence and kick your ass.\u201d The two just throwing obscenities at each other, threatening to kick each others asses, with the customers family yelling him to stop. \n\nAnd that random guy I mentioned from earlier who was talking to me about how amazing the truck was, he was standing in front of this irate guy, holding his arm out, in front of this irate man, trying to keep thing from turning into a fight. \n\nFinally, the guy gets back into his truck and drives off. And the guy who standing in the irate man\u2019s way came over, as him and the customer talked, trying to get the customer to calm down. \n\nHe was saying \u201cPay no attention to that idiot. He lives several houses down. He shouldn\u2019t have gotten involved. He\u2019s one of those people who are more brawn then brains.\u201d \n\nHe then identified himself as the head of the cul-de-sac community, and he had no problem with what we were doing, the court was fine, it was a interesting show, etc. He pointed out to the customer if anything else ever needed to be boomed in like that again, to come to him because he can give official permission. \n\nThe customer thanked him, apologizing for how things escalated, and for not knowing he was the one to go to for permission. \n\nBoth him and the customer then apologized to me for what happened. I just laughed, saying \u201cHey, keeps my day interesting.\u201d And we all wished each other a good day. \n\nSo as I\u2019m leaving the cul-de-sac, I pass where the irate man lives, as he was standing on his porch.

Well the conversation we had had to backpedal a mile and turn down a different route in order to get things accomplished.     \n\n  That or the very least having to take baby steps through this having to explain things that normally most people would be able to piece together themselves.  \n\nIn this situation I was taking phone calls and helping people go over their bills that they have with us and other general questions.    \n\nThe customer initially called in to inquire about why she wasn\u2019t receiving any of her bills.   Simple enough request at start.  The conversation went more like this.    \n\nC = customer    \nM = me    \n\n(After verifying the account details)   \n\nM:  how can I help you today?    \n\nC:   Yes, I called because I\u2019ve been frustrated over these last couple of months.   I\u2019m tired of having to check online to just have to see what I owe.  Why haven\u2019t I been receiving my bills?    \n\n[I check on her account and see that we have been sending them to her.  Additionally she\u2019s been signed up for getting them sent to her email.  So I\u2019ve seen this call 100 times, people forget they signed themselves up for e-billing and call to complain about it]    \n\nM:   I\u2019d be glad to check up on that.   And to inquire, you mean why haven\u2019t you been receiving them in your mail?   \n\nC:   Yes of course, *what else would I mean*?   \n\nM:  as it stands now your account is signed up for paperless billing.  Meaning that it\u2019s been opted to have the bills emailed to you.   \n\nC:  I know what that means.  I remember signing up for it.  Why do you keep bringing it up?   \n\n*already over this conversation. However I know it\u2019s possibly far from over*\n\nM:  well the reason why is because when it\u2019s set up this way that means that you no longer will be sent bills through the mail.   It\u2019s sent to you strictly to your email.   \n\nC:   that\u2019s just outrageous.  Why can\u2019t you send it to me both ways?!  \n\nM:  unfortunately it\u2019s more of an either\/or situation in regards to this matter.  Now if you wish\u2014 \n\nC:  [cutting me off] well I don\u2019t want to have it that way then.    \n\nM:   Ah yes that\u2019s what I was about to suggest.  I\u2019ll go ahead and take care of that for you.    \n\nC:  alright good you best do that.  I just want them to come to my house.  Now on to my other issue I called you for.   I sent in a payment to you recently.   I want to make sure that you got it.    \n\nM:  certainly.   [glad that\u2019s over I look into her account in regards to her payments]  \nSo on the account there\u2019s nothing past due however there is still a bill that\u2019s currently owed of $xxx.  Is the payment youre talking about that you sent to us meant to cover this?   Because as of now we haven\u2019t received it yet to cover the current bill.  \n\nC:\u2026 wait what there\u2019s still something that I owe?!  Why?  How is that?   \n\nM:   Well the deadline for this bill isn\u2019t for another couple weeks however it is the bill for this month.  The payment you\u2019re talking about was meant to cover this??  If so we haven\u2019t received one for this bill yet.   When did you recall making a payment last?     \n\n[trying to see if she made a payment we just haven\u2019t received yet or if something went wrong with the process of it applying to the account]    \n\nC:  I just made a payment.  why are you saying I still owe something?   \n\nM:  The last payment was received on April 20th, and that covered April\u2019s bill.  However since then another bill came out and that\u2019s what\u2019s owed.  Is there a payment you\u2019ve made since then?    \n\nC:  of course I\u2019d be talking about the payment I sent in for April.  I only pay my bills at the end of the month.  Why in the hell would I be talking about the bill for may?  It\u2019s not due yet.   [she getting increasingly angry and having a harsh tone]    \n\nM:  [wishing I could just hang up at this point] Ah, I\u2019m sorry for the confusion.  With you wondering why you still owed anything plus you saying you\u2019ve been checking your account online made me think you meant you were talking about this bill.  Now\u2014\n\nC:  [interrupting me again] why would you assume I meant this bill?  I was talking about last month\u2019s bill *obviously*\n\nM:  [deciding to not repeat the explication I just told her and move on to avoid more arguments]  my apologies, and in that case we did receive that payment to cover last month\u2019s bill.  Is there anything else I can help you with?  \n\nC:  I just don\u2019t know why you\u2019d think that.  Anyway\u2026. I guess that\u2019s all for now.  \n\nShe promptly hangs up on me and I sit there for a few seconds to calm down my frustrations before moving on.   \n\n\nI don\u2019t know why people are just so complicated.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1653489471.0},{"title":"A Tale From the Self-Checkouts","author":"WhitePineBurning","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromRetail\/comments\/uwboud\/a_tale_from_the_selfcheckouts\/","text":"I posted this in another unrelated thread yesterday. I got his okay to share it here. I've worked in retail for 30 years off and on, and this one... You'll see.\n\nI apologize for the wall of text:\n\nMy fiance works (or worked, I should say) as an assistant at the self-checkouts for a market downtown. Yesterday (Sunday) it was busy and there were lines at the registers. \n\nSo, it was two young women's turn at the front of the line to check out. They had a full cart and began scanning their items. Slowly. They scanned a few things, changed their minds, asked my fianc\u00e9 to take an item off the order. Then they changed their minds again and put it back on. Scanned a few more items and then needed another item taken off. Then they took a break to text. This went on for 20 minutes. He asked them if they needed help. Nope, they were fine, they said.\n\nFinally, after all the items were scanned, one went to use Apple Pay and found out that her account was low on funds. So the other went to use her Apple Pay and also found out that her account was low. They stood there, frozen. My fiance approached them again and asked if he could assist them. One of the women told him that they were working on transferring funds to pay for their items. He asked them if they wanted him to suspend the order until they got their accounts straightened out. They told him that it would just be a minute and they'd have it figured out.\n\nThe lines were still long and getting longer.\n\nTen minutes later one of them disappeared from the checkout area. The other stood at the register texting someone. My fiance AGAIN approached the remaining woman. She said her friend would be right back. Ten minutes later, he looked up. They were both gone. Nowhere in the area, it appeared they'd just up and left. Unsurprisingly, this does happen. They had left the cart and all their items at the register. So, my guy gathers up their stuff, puts it back in the cart and wheels it out of the way to the liquor counter, cancels the transaction and lets another customer take their place to keep things moving.\n\nOver ten minutes later: They both CAME BACK into the store and demanded to know where their cart went. He told them that it was over by the liquor counter and that he canceled their order, because it was now ONE HOUR since they walked up to the register to check out. One of the women was furious -- she said she only went to her car TO CHARGE HER PHONE for 20 minutes and he should've known she'd be back. She started yelling and threw a tantrum. \n\nThen... my fianc\u00e9 went off on them.\n\nHe made it clear to them that they were being incredibly self-centered and had been holding up other customers for a full hour, that they should have figured out their payment method, they and should have charged their phones ahead of time. He told them that if they knew they would hold people up, they should have just suspended their order, got themselves together, and come back to complete the transaction after they'd resolved the situation. \n\nHe then sent them to the back of the line to start over. And they did. No fucks given, that's how he is sometimes. \n\nNot joking -- three people waiting in line clapped. One high-fived him. \n\nThis was the tipping point. He's done there, not going back. He already had other work lined up, anyway.\n\nTL;DR: My guy finally had enough of stupid, rude people and called them out on it.","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1653343571.0},{"title":"Customer destroys driveway with rented equipment, proceeds to blame us.","author":"BigE1263","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromRetail\/comments\/uvzf4q\/customer_destroys_driveway_with_rented_equipment\/","text":"Sort of a short and to the point story I overheard at the end of the day.\n\nPart of our job is to tell customers that rent motor equipment is how to use it.

I'm not completely sure why but at this time the person working the checkout was only accepting cash. This greatly angered two customers though. After a bit of back and forth they walked over to the self checkout right besides my family yelling about how they will just do the employees job for them and crap like that. I dont know why it mattered though because the self checkout accepted cash and card. I was standing by my mom and sister(6) about two feet away from them. The manager politely asked them to calm down or leave the store. These people must have had some serious issues because they just kept getting louder and screaming worse and worse things at my manager. The guy walked over to the exit and the windows at the front of the store and started kicking and punching them and threatening the other workers .

People rarely would return for their items and it was starting to cause a mess and more work for cleanup at the end of the day.

A lady's card was declining and she asked to put the items on hold until the end of the night. My coworker told her no, apologized saying we no longer do holds. The customer started getting agitated and said \"you are clothing store, you should take holds!!!\" And then asked why we won't take her items.  Co worker states its a new policy in place because people don't come back for them. Well the customer still didn't like that answer, kept pushing that she put it on hold and she would be back etc. There was a huge line up behind this lady so my Co worker took her items and told her \"I can hold it for half an hour and that's it\" and the customer sort of scoffed at her and replied \"that's plenty of time, thank you.\" And went on her way.\n\nTime goes by as we get the little rush down, and this is when i noticed the bag of items and i asked my coworker about it and thats when she filled me in.

Before that I worked in manfacturing and prior that I spent some years in the military.       Since I know my way around tools, I like to work in the hardware department...    regardless that I'm old lady now.       \n\nI like to think my age gives me some respectability for doing a 'man's job' ...but no, they hired a young turk last year who aspires to be the manager, while not knowing much about tools and construction.\n\nThe boss loves him cuz he's strong as an Ox, so they're also encouraging his leadership skills... which sometimes amounts to Ox trying to throw his weight around me.       For instance: our biggest seller is keys- we cut every kind of key; especially house keys.      No, we're not locksmiths- we have a machine that does most of the work; but I'll do one thing noone else does when I make keys; I file down the sharp, cut edges, once the machine is done.      As a metal-worker, I know that mechanical parts wear each other down, and putting a sharp, new key into an old lock is going to stick; plus if there are any burrs left on the key, they may come off in the lock and jam it.      So, I keep a big metal file and wire brush by the key machine to smooth the keys out.\n\nSuddenly, Ox decided that he disagreed with that and started removing my file from beside the machine.       Okay, however he failed to notice that the hardware department was full of files for sale, and I'd just go get another one.       Until one day, he catches me file  in hand, in the middle of cleaning the burrs off of a key ...and YOINK!     Ox grabbed the file and insisted, \"You're gonna *break* the keys  doing that!!!\n\nOh, Hell No!       I demanded he give me my file back and told him that he didn't know what he was talking about!       Here endith the floor altercation cuz we couldn't have shouting matches in front of the paying customers.              At least, Ox stopped taking my file, and I let him screw up key cutting in his own way.\n\nThat is, until a couple days ago when the gods of metal work sent me a blessing.       Ox nearly had me doubting my methods, but I didn't want to turn out a shoddy product; thankfully my perseverance paid off.       As I was making and cleaning some keys for an elderly gentleman; he noticed my attention to detail and commented approvingly, \"Ah, turning a new key into an old one.\"         Eh?      Naturally, I started explaining what I was doing, and he whole-heartedly agreed, because that's how he used to do it *when HE was a locksmith*.\n\nI could have cried from the validation: it's so nice when someone appreciates your work!","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1653299889.0},{"title":"Working at an arcade and closing","author":"Lamodite","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromRetail\/comments\/uvunv4\/working_at_an_arcade_and_closing\/","text":"Gotta rant cause today was the worst of it. I work at an arcade in the mall and for the most part it\u2019s pretty fun. But I close and those last 10 min are always the worst. Since I\u2019m the closing manager I try to make sure everything is ready for the opening guy. Refill tickets, clean machines, garbage all that. The problem is there\u2019s always a few chuckle fucks that try to put 20$ in the change machine and play games. Usually I let them but announce our closing time and say I can\u2019t ring up any tickets 5 min before closing. I also try to start my clean up hoping they take the hint and leave. \n\nUsually this works. People play, I can clean around them, and by closing they\u2019re out and can come redeem their tickets later if they want. Today however was one of the worst. \n\nSo a hand full of people showed up 10 min before closing. I did the usual and told them our hours and everything.

By the time it hit 6 I gave them the receipt and told them we are closed and they can redeem them tomorrow. I thought I got everyone out but there was still 2 full grown ass adults still playing our Jurassic park rail gun game. I quickly went over and told them were closed. They just said ok and kept playing lol. I still had some things to do so I turned off the lights, took out trash and counted down the money hoping they\u2019d leave by then. When I got back it was close to 15 min past closing and they were still there. I got pissed and flipped the breaker to all the games. Felt good and bonus points for watching them wander the mall only to realize there\u2019s only one exit open and they\u2019d have to walk all the way around the parking lot to get to their car. \n\nClosing time isn\u2019t a suggestion especially at a mall.

I was working in the self-checkout area, and was going about business as usual, walking around and smiling at the customers while watching for anyone who needed assistance. Suddenly, I was stopped in my tracks by the brash voice of a cantankerous middle aged woman.\n\nShe held up a bag of shredded cheese and went on a tangent about how she allegedly found it in a section that was marked for about 3 dollars less than the price it rang up for on the register. She was extremely adamant and demanding. I offered to do a price check on it for her, and sure enough, the price check turned out the same price that it rang up for on the register. She then began ranting about how she WOULD get it for the price that she believed was the correct one and that she was \"very angry\" and that \"nobody around here knows anything and doesn't do their job\". I replied \"Yes ma'am, I understand, I'm sorry.\" You know, standard retail worker politeness. Apparently she took this as \"patronizing\" and got even MORE offended and proceeded to ask for the manager. So I just replied \"Alright\" and dashed off to fetch one of my supervisors.\n\nI couldn't find one in the immediate area, so I asked one of my coworkers with a pager to summon one for me, and he did so. After this, I went back over to Cheesy Karen to assure her that a manager was on their way, and she took this as an opportunity to rant at me even further. She reiterated how angry she was, claimed that everyone who worked there was stupid, and asked me how I got a job there. She also called me \"sweetheart\" very sarcastically and condescendingly multiple times during her rants.\n\nFinally, the supervisor arrived, and Cheesy Karen redirected her rage to her. I ended up having to go off and help another customer during most of Cheesy Karen's interactions with my supervisor, but a few minutes later, I ended up helping some people at the register next to Cheesy Karen's while she was still there. She turned to the other customers I was helping and made remarks about \"jacked up prices\" and \"people not knowing what they're doing\". They mostly just ignored her and were polite to me.\n\nI also found out a few minutes later that my supervisor did not in fact lower the price of the cheese for her, so she ended up not buying it at all. I'm honestly pretty impressed that I didn't get my Karen cherry popped until about a month and a half on the job.

I could go on and on about the many stories of wicked customers that entered that store over the 4 years I worked there, but I'll share the most satisfying one.  \n\nI was young, still in high school, working as a sales associate in an upper middleclass suburban midwest music store. The store catered mostly to kids in school band, selling cheap orchestra instruments on 0% interest 0 down payment plans that you could cancel at anytime. It was their bread and butter. During peak season (end of summer) we would have lines out the door each person filling out one of these contracts.  \n\nThis brings me to Rude Customer\u2122. It was a day like any other when a huge pickup pulled into the front spot and what today would be described as a MAGA dad and his son hop out and into the store.  \n\nHe places a piano lesson book onto the counter and asks to return it. I look at the receipt and see that it is not within our return policy time of 30 days. Now, normally I would just accept the return, but I had just had a talking to by the manager about accepting returns past 30 days, so I politely told him that the book was unable to be returned.  \n\nNow this book was no more than $8, and it was clear that the kid had finished the book and moved on to the next book, but still Rude Dad\u2122 started to get angry. I politely reminded him of our return policy that was laminated to the counter and that I would get in trouble if I returned it.  \n\n>\"Well maybe I should just return the $800 clarinet I bought the other day too!\"  \n\nYoung, and shaken from being yelled at, I just took the book and began the return process. At that moment my older coworker, who had heard the whole thing, turned around looked this guy in the eye and said something along the lines of:\n\n>\"You're returning your kid's clarinet because you're upset that we wont return an $8 book you've clearly used?? What do you think purpose of having a return policy is, SIR?! If you would like to return your kid's clarinet go ahead.\"  \n\nI froze, he froze. I looked at his embarrassed young kid just wanting to hide. Rude Dad\u2122 snatched his book off the counter and stormed out. He stood out in front of our store for another 15-20 minutes walking up to cars pulling in clearly talking to them about what happened, gesturing towards us in the store and then drove off never to return.  \n\nThankfully my coworker was one of the best employees with the highest sales numbers so he was safe from upper management. He immediately called our manager to tell him what happened to get ahead of it and neither of us received any repercussions. I was really glad he stepped up and yelled at that guy. It was satisfying seeing him storm out like a child and try and get people to not shop here.  \n\nHopefully that kid is doing alright.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1652730332.0},{"title":"PSA: Read the Customer's Mind and Intentions (.......I Should Have Known Better)","author":"im-you-not-me","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromRetail\/comments\/ur1rik\/psa_read_the_customers_mind_and_intentions_i\/","text":"Sorry for the long background, but bear with me. This also took place a year or more ago.\n\nLike with all things retail, the customers make things either interesting or boring. But we all know how out of touch with reality some can be. Like all other stores, we also have a rewards program across our family brands. At the time this incident happened, we were only limited to viewing if a customer did have rewards to use or not, only after they had accumulated them in $5 increments. This was done by entering their number. We couldn't see their points, or how far they were away from the next reward. That could only be viewed by them online, and over the phone through the brand's customer service. As with all things coupons go, they may also receive it on email as a scannable code and sometimes depending on the sales, they can get another discount code they could use. But sometimes the scannable one wasn't always up to date, especially if they had just used it in the last day or two.\n\n This couple come to my register and I started ringing them up. The lady was on her phone, while the guy set out their stuff. I had him enter their number, and saw that he didn't have a coupon. It was at this point the lady interjected that she saw a code on her email. I kept scanning and folding the rest of their purchase as she looked on her phone. I was down to the last items when the lady picked up a phone call. Considering that she hadn't shown me anything within the time it took me to scan, fold and bag everything, I assumed she couldn't find any. It happens, but I still like to ask once more if there are any coupons that they want to add. Now I didn't want to interrupt her facetime but just confirm what I thought.\n\n>**Me:** *Your total is $XX.XX Would you like to apply any other coupons that you may have?*\n\n>**Guy:** *No I don't think so.* \n\nHe turned to look at his partner, who didn't respond, or add anything to this conversation.\n\n>**Me:** *Okay, the total is $XX.XX Will it be on cash or card?*\n\nHe paid by card, and  started handing him his bags of clothes and lastly the one with the receipt. This was what caught her attention.\n\n>**Lady:** *Hey, you didn't give me a chance to look up for my coupon.*\n\nW..T..F \n\nHonestly, this transaction was long, and at the start of the transaction, you said you'd check for the coupon, and I asked once more right before you paid. But one thing I learnt was never say sorry, but see how you can make things better.\n\n>**Me:** *If you have any coupons to use, I can redo the purchase for you.\n\nShe ignored me once again and told whomever she was on the phone with that we are so impatient and that they shouldn't shop at our store location. As they left with that comment, it was only nice of me to wish them a good weekend ahead. The guy was decent enough to say thanks, and was pretty chill. I had a long line to get through.\n\n---\n\nTL;DR: Couple comes to my register to get rang out. I can't see any valid coupon to use, but the lady says she saw one in her email recently. She then proceeds to search for it, (at least that's what I think)  and ends up on a call halfway through the transaction. After I check once more if they want to add any coupon, The guy says no, she doesn't say anything, guy pays, only then for the lady to say I didn't give her a chance to look for her coupons after a long transaction, and me checking twice.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1652723478.0},{"title":"What is with people trying to barter items with retail employees, our business is not a garage sale lol.

So for context I work in a small grocery store that has a small warehouse where produce is looked after along with the other normal stock. \n\nIt was a Normal Saturday shift and it was getting close to the end of the day. the Person who works produce left half hour before the store closed as they usually do on Saturdays. (Meat,deli, produce and bakery all start earlier than the retail workers)when their shift is done we have someone maintain the flow of produce going out onto the floor. As usual my co worker (we\u2019ll call them X) was on this duty as he was the only one working that knew how to put out the produce properly. \n\nThis is when our supervisor tells them that they have to mop and do the dishes as the produce worker left in a hurry that day. \n\nNow this sounds like a bad thing but in this case it was exciting to them because it was a sign that the produce worker entrusted a worker who only works to put the produce out, to clean an area they helped maintain.\n\nI could tell how excited they were just by how hard they worked to get the floor looking presentable for the workers on Monday. \n\nUnfortunately the only mop left was the deli\/bakery mop as the janitor was mopping the bathrooms as it was ten minutes to closing. \n\nNow this mop was tall, like touched the roof of the produce area tall. (Break rooms are above) and I was talking and joking around with co workers about something else, x lifted their mop to put it in the  water completely distracted by the conversation at hand and the top of the mop must have gotten in between the fluorescent lights and one just popped off the socket and shattered all over the ground. (At this point the supervisor went to do something I forget what it was but they were not  in the warehouse) \n\nNow the produce area is tucked away near the door to the floor and thankfully the light was just an LED in a glass tube otherwise things would have  ended differently. \n\nWith the help of the janitor the people in the warehouse we cleaned it up and informed the supervisor of the incident as good workers do. \n\nWe disposed of the light in the dumpster and to this day X refuses to clean the produce area in fear of taking out the other light.

I wanted to post it the day of but wasn't feeling well.\n\nAnyway, quick preface. The box store I work has a new process of applying veteran discounts. For those of you who haven't heard, all veterans with smart phones who want their discounts must register their status either on the company website or app. It requires their names, branch they served, if they're active\/retired, discharge date, and birthday. When it's done, they get a QR code that get scanned to apply the discount. The code can't be screenshot as it refreshes randomly every hour so it can't be shared.\n\nSome of us take the time to help the less tech savvy folks get situated. Trust me, we don't like it either, but we need our jobs more than we need to appease everyone. Thankfully, I've had many appreciative people express their thanks to me for being patient enough to guide them and make it simple. I get the occasional anal orifices here and there, but I tell them the polite version of \"If you don't want to do it, either pay full price or buy it elsewhere. There is no third option.\"\n\nWe used to just visually check the I.D.s for validity, but let's just say too many bad people ruined it for everyone. Namely certain folks using their veteran discount for their own companies or companies they worked for, which is not allowed as the discount is ONLY for the veterans' personal purchases.\n\nSome even got hostile when they were told they can't combine their veteran discount with their rewards account discounts as they're not combinable. It's against policy. In the two years I've been at this job, I've seen two men get arrested because they got violent with my staff. One almost punched a manager until our secret security guy, who was trying to get him to leave, grabbed him from behind. I never thought hearing a grown man scream from his arm getting twisted could be so glorious.\n\nMoving on, our competitor other box store, gives veteran discounts when the customers show their I.D.s and give their phone numbers. That's going to change soon as that company will also be going by the new method to keep everyone honest. We get plenty of people who scoff at our new veteran discount policy and \"threaten\" us by saying they're going to other box store instead. My coworkers and I lowkey laugh, because that's like telling us there's free food in the break room. One less rude person to deal with, we say.\n\nAll caught up? Cool.\n\nSo, I was watching self-checkout and went to help an elderly woman buying spray paint (age-restricted item). She was very nice, and chatted a bit while I scanned her items for her. I didn't have to, but just wanted to be polite. Then a heavyset guy waves me over for help. I excuse myself and bid her a great day.\n\nI asked the guy how I can help him, and he says he wanted to apply his veteran discount but was having trouble. So, I asked what I ask everyone: \"Have you registered your veteran status on our site?\"\n\nBig Guy: \"What? I have my I.D. right here.\" He shows it to me. \"My phone number is \\[blah blah\\].\"\n\nI explained how the policy changed and what he had to do, but he interrupted me.\n\nBig Guy: \"No, no, I don't have to do that. Just type in my number like last time.\"\n\nMe: \"We don't go by phone number, sir. Other box store does. I can help you register--\"\n\nBig Guy: \"I didn't have to do that last time. Just do your thing, put my phone number in, and give me my discount. I do it all the time when I come here, so why won't you do it?\"\n\nI swapped my friendly tone for the lukewarm neutral. \"You're mistaken, sir. We've never gone by phone number. We used to check I.D.s, but then--\"\n\nBig Guy: \"The fuh? You callin me a liar?! WTF is your problem?\"\n\nMe: \\*unfazed since I'm not the problem here\\* \"I didn't say you were lying, sir. I said you were mistaken. As I said, Other box store goes by number. We go by the QR code you get when you register your veteran status online.\"\n\nAt this point Big Guy is raising a stink, using every cuss word imaginable, insulting me, whatever. I already shut off my humanity at this point and just stood there watching this angry ape of a man turn an interested beet red color.\n\nWhen he was done banging his vocal chords, I said in a slightly kinder voice, \"I'll get a manager for you.\"\n\nBig Guy: \"You suck at your job. I bet you don't even know who your manager is.\"\n\nSide note, I've worked a good while at this company, and I love to make goodies for my coworkers once in a while to show my appreciation for them. Because of those two things, not only do I know who my manager, EVERYONE who works in the store knows me. Hard to forget that one nice coworker who brings everyone homemade treats just because.\n\nIt took no time for a manager to show up since one of the cashiers already called. Manager shows up and asks what's up. Big Guy goes ape mode again, calling me all sorts of rather discolored things, including a liar when I tried explaining the veteran discount thing.\n\nManager tells him what I said was correct, and that we have never giving veteran discounts through phone numbers, and that the other store did. Big Guy wasn't having it and dug his heels in so deep, I was surprised he didn't fall over. Three male customers at the other checkout defended me saying I wasn't rude at all, and the shorter one said he was amazed I stood there and, in his words, \"took it like a boss while this Hulk of witch roared\" at me. Not gonna lie, that made me laugh.\n\nBig Guy kept saying I called him a liar. Again, shorter male customer told him, \"Hombre, she said you were MISTAKEN. That doesn't mean lying. YOU'RE the one lying making up all that B.S. just now. We all heard you.\"\n\nThe elderly woman I helped blew my mind when she said, \"You're an a\\*\\*hole for bullying retail workers!

Kinda warmed my heart to see strangers sticking up for me.\n\nThe manager told the customer he didn't appreciate Big Guy harassing his employee and told him to leave. The cherry on top of this whole thing? Big Guy said he could prove I was lying about the phone number bit. This guy actually pulled out a receipt dated the day before from the last time he shopped \"here\" and lo and behold, the receipt was from other box store.\n\nBig Guy went silent. The manager turned to see the receipt and then to the guy. All the manager said was, \"So, are you leaving voluntarily so should I have the police give you a ride somewhere?\"\n\nWith that, Big Guy hurried out empty-handed without a word or glance at anyone. The manager asked if I was okay. I was, just annoyed. He said he appreciated me keeping my cool with him and gave me a fist bump. He also said thanks for the cupcakes I made on mother's day since he gave one to his pregnant wife, and said she loved it.\n\nI thanked the three customers who came to my defense. The shorter one gave me a fist bump and said how he knew what it was like to be bullied on the job, and how he had a young daughter who dealt with it at her job.\n\nGoes to show you not all heroes wear capes.

But for a quick summary. A customer accused me of stealing 50 dollars from him because he was short that amount for a order of 3000 dollars, and threatened to call my boss to get me fired. \n\nSo not quiet the juicy update maybe everyone is hoping for, because I have heard little to nothing about this customer since, other than a few extra details. \n\nSo, one thing I forgot to mention in the previous post, while trying to verify the count of money he was giving me, before I moved the money to the cooler, the surface I was using to count was unstable, and the money fell to the floor, which I picked up. \n\nApparently, this is when the customer claimed I stole the money. In their words \u201cI had my back turned for two seconds, and that\u2019s when he dropped the money on the floor and must have somehow Houdini\u2019d it, and pocketed it in that time.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, I was seeing one of my bosses who I had notified of the incident, catching up since we hadn\u2019t seen each other in a while. He laughed saying \u201cIf you could somehow swindle money like that that fast, and that well, I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t be working for us, you\u2019d be down in Vegas.\u201d \n\nAlso when my coworker went back to deliver his material and get the money, the customer claimed to store staff all the money was originally correct, because he only had 20 dollars in his wallet. But my coworker who delivered it said when he went into his wallet to get the missing amount, he had way more then 20 dollars in his wallet. \n\nBut so far, he hasn\u2019t called my bosses, which they agree the customer was just trying to bully me. Stating the louder the customer, the more they are trying to hide. \n\nBut in the mean time, we have the customers name marked so they know not to send me to do deliveries to him again. As he never wants to see me again as he claimed, and neither do I. \n\nAny questions, feel free to ask in the comments.
