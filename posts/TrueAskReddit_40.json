        "text": "A philosophical conundrum that's been on my mind in reflecting the rapid growth of machine learning (and distributed computing power) has led to an overwhelming question personally, and I do wonder if anyone else has had similar considerations from a moral, philosophical, and/or existential perspective. \n\nIf artificial general intelligence (AGI) were to spring forth one day, it's very well likely that human beings would become intellectually inferior by all standards, due of course to our biological limitations preventing unrestrained development in knowledge, as well as the capacity to gain further knowledge and awareness.\n\nMachines may then be better apt to take on roles as not only the knowledge workers, but also decision makers in practically all matters of life. Such a situation, I feel, is at odds with concerns commonly raised regarding humanity's need to curtail AI, so much as to protect itself from being overrun. Since the extent to which life is valued rests largely on intelligence, which side would have the moral high ground in making technological/political leadership decisions, objectively speaking? Could such a moral/philosophical battle arise between us and AI, or would they still be missing some other capacity to truly become a life form worth debating with?\n\nAgain, all of this is assuming AGI is possible, and you are welcome to argue for or against this as well (my stance here is entirely ambivalent).\n",

That *they* are just using us to live comfortably by taking away from our comfort, they don't care about our lives, or social issues like healthcare and the environment. \n\nThe above is hyperbole (and not my real opinion, don't worry), but it certainly isn't all nonsense, there's a ring of truth in there, because the idea of a a large populace doing the menial work with little reward, who support a smaller populace who do more skilled work with more reward, who support a smaller populace etc. etc... isn't just a fact, it is a founding pillar of our society, and has been for thousands of years. \n\nFor me, as a lower-middle-class westerner who works a boring job so my boss can go home in his new Porsche, so his boss can fly to Malta for a vacation in his private plane, so his boss can invest in half the property in the state... it certainly rings true. That is just the system we have, though it's important to note that greedy people will always exploit it.\n\nThere's nothing *wrong* with my life though, I quite like it, my point is just that it is held where it is by two opposing forces. \n\nI am held back by my superiors, those would rather keep me where I am so they can be greedy. My boss doesn't want me to get a raise, he's worried it will come out of his salary.\n\nI am also pushed forward, though, by my inferiors in society (and, like it or not, that is what they are). I know (though I don't like to think) that many of my possessions were only affordable because they were made by children in illegal factories for virtually nothing. I know that many of my bills are affordable because the companies ignores the cost to the environment, and let others suffer from the damage they cause. \n\nI don't feel like I've done any of the above justice, but I can at least finish with what this question boils down to.\n\nImagine a world where people aren't greedy, where we aren't driven by competition, where we aren't all trying to tread on each other.\nIn this world, I would have to pay my electricity company an extra commission because they used renewable energy. My laptop would be manufactured by qualified, trained professionals who had to be paid a living wage, which would drive its price up hugely. The same would go for my food, because everyone on Earth would get enough food, starvation just wouldn't be a thing, and food-providers would be strained to the limit.\nPoliticians would be committed to the greater good and the welfare of their people. But this would cause them to spend a lot more on their countries and that, plus the increased cost of... almost everything, would lead to an increase in taxes, just to support the government.\n\nWith all this in mind, what would it be like for *us*, in this world? would our lives actually be better or worse than they are now? Would we gain more than we sacrifice, or sacrifice more than we gain?\n\nI'm not trying to deny that there are some major problems with our society, but I want to know if people think it really can all be rectified by choosing to support *all* 7 billion people on this planet, or would that just make things worse?\n\nDiscuss.",

        "text": "When discussing crime and punishment we often make the separation between violent crime and non violent crime. In this comparison non violent crime is generally treaded as less bad in that people that commit them are not \"menaces to society.\" People that are committing violent crimes are breaking the social contract in a more egregious way, and should face harsher penalties because of it.\n\nModern, especially liberal, perspectives on crime and criminality generally take the environment of the criminal into account. Generally this is used for empathy and to try and encourage rehabilitation over over punishment. \"If you were in a similar situation you would have done the same.\"\n\nIn particular, forgiveness is often encouraged/motivated by the failing on society to give them the opportunities to live in a way that is not criminal. \"It's not 'black culture' that's the problem, it's that the American people/government at large systematically oppressed oppressed people of color such that they were driven to criminality. And in more modern times has not provided a sufficient safety net and has continued with practices that encourage stratification, albeit in a less egregious way.\" Society broke the contract first, so future punishments should be less severe.\n\n(Note, I'm not saying the above are absolutely true. Just that they are common memes within discussions on law and crime.)\n\nComing back to the title. It seems to me that continuing the above we should have a further breakdown of crime (in particular, I'll be discussing non violent crime, but this also seems to apply to violent crime).\n\nTheft due to poverty ~~is~~ _EDIT: can be viewed as_ a reaction to the breaking of the social contract by society, and should be punished less. Large scale financial fraud (tantamount to theft in a slightly different way) should be treated as categorically differently because of the different way it violates the social contract. Generally those doing so aren't doing so because they're unable to survive without doing so. They just want money and don't feel bad about acquiring it in an amoral way.\n\nMuch like violent crime is treated categorically different, non poverty driven crime should be treated differently. While I don't want to get into specific details too much to avoid bogging down the discussion, you could imagine some repercussions of this being increased sentencing times, more stringent post incarceration restrictions and other heavier handed ways of preventing recidivism.\n\nEDIT: Oh also, I'll note that I'm not convinced I believe this myself. It's just a thought that occurred to me as I was reading some articles this morning. There's a reason I put this in TrueAskReddit and not CMV or the like.",

Only 9% of Americans showed up to the Primaries, possibly not too many more for the actual Presidential election. Factor in how much research each of those voters do (or don't do) for even the Presidential candidate, let alone all the other offices they'll vote for, and you have to wonder if government will ever be effective.

        "text": "I got curious about this topic after seeing the [NPR article] (http://www.npr.org/sections/thetorch/2016/08/14/489980911/ryan-lochte-and-three-other-u-s-swimmers-robbed-at-gunpoint-in-rio?utm_source=facebook.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=npr&amp;utm_term=nprnews&amp;utm_content=20160814) about U.S. swimmers being robbed at gunpoint in Rio. Someone in the comments mentioned the argument for a permanent venue, which I found intriguing. \n\nTranscription of the comments exchange that sparked this question: \n\n&gt;**Deminimis**: \"I read the suggestion in other places, maybe it is time to create permanent locations for the Olympic games. A location for the summer games, and a location for the winter games. Build the required structures, make them a training location in between the games, and no more of this bidding the games out to different countries. Not only could it make for safer locations, and better facilities, but it would help to eliminate the corruption and kick backs in the [International Olympics Committee]. Oh, wait... I get it.\"\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;**Unpartisan** (in response to Deminimis) : \"A lot of us believe that they should be permanently held in Greece. They recently had an Olympics there so the infrastructure is primarily built. We could let all the nations bid to be the ceremonial host, with that and TV contracts we should be able to fund it fully without needing to put a strain on Greece. Greece would get the tourism which is good, and the Summer Olympics belong in Greece anyways.\"\n\nThoughts?\n\nEDIT: added bold to commenters' names for formatting clarity",

        "text": "I've been thinking a lot about how our society seems to give some objectively surface level traits more importance than others. With all the complaining about \"whitewashing\" in Hollywood right now, I began to wonder how important the race of a character is, compared to other visual factors, like their hair color, and also inner qualities, such as personality and values.\n\nPublic out roar tends to ensue when an Asian character is portrayed by a Caucasian actor. It is obvious that this is based entirely on surface level qualities, as I am yet to see any anger at, for exampled, a white American playing a white Russian. \n\nLets talk about changing an actor's sound and appearance so that they better fit the character. No one would make a fuss if you died that American actor's red hair blonde and made him speak with a Russian accent so that his performance is more believable. However, if you put him in a \"yellowface\" make up and had him talk with a Chinese accent there would be a change.org petition calling for the entire movie staff to be sent to the gallows. Putting the tackiness of the second scenario aside, are both just \"movie magic\" to improve the portrayal?\n\nOne argument against whitewashing is that it is unfair to minority actors. Is this a reasonable claim? If so, how can (and should we) go about trying to fix that issue?\n\nI see the point of view of both sides, but  I'm curious to see what you guys think and if there are any arguments or data that I haven't taken into consideration.",

        "text": "I mean \"demographics\" if a very loose sense.  It could be any physical description that matches you that also correlates with whatever beliefs you happen to have.\n\nTake politics for example.  Should you place more doubt/skepticism on your political beliefs if they align with the state/city you are from and grew up in?  Say a conservative in the south or a liberal in California or NYC?  It's possible that they came to their beliefs because they evaluated the evidence, but it's also possible they just followed the algorithm of \"do what others around me are doing\" (DWOAMAD) and ended up where they are.  Since they could have just as well have been born somewhere else and followed the DWOAMAD process and ended up with completely different beliefs.  If you have similar beliefs to those around you and similar to you then you are more likely to have gotten there by DWOAMAD than if you have different beliefs from people who are similar to you.  Perhaps then, you should place a little extra doubt on your beliefs if they align too closely with what's to be expected from people who are similar to you.\n\nOr take religion.  Should you be more skeptical of your religious beliefs if they just so happen to be the same as your parents'?\n\nAre women more likely to over-estimate or under-estimate the bias against women in the workforce?  What about men?  Are they more likely to over-estimate or under-estimate the bias against women?\n\nThere's basically a never ending list of examples...\n\nDoubt and skepticism don't mean that you have to give up your beliefs entirely and conform to whatever demographics or social groups you *don't* belong to, but in these cases should we adjust in the direction of moderation?\n\nI'm strongly tempted to say 'of course.'  But I see a couple of possible issues.  1) the genetic fallacy and 2) how deep does this rabbit hole go?  Should I adjust in the direction of moderation my view against racism because I happened to be born in a culture where racism is seen as low status?  On that, I want to say 'no' but I'm sure everyone wants to say 'no' when it comes to *their* beliefs.  And 3) it's not always clear what the relevant \"demographic\" group is.  Is my demographic group people from the south or young people or people that went to college?  People who read the blogs I do?  These all have different statistical belief implications.\n\nAnyways, what are your thoughts?",
