        "text": "This story takes place shortly after the events of [Supercops](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3dyd6v/the_glorious_chucklefucks_supercops/), about two sessions prior to [the finale](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3h9dh9/the_glorious_chucklefucking_finale_the_height_of/) of the campaign.\n\nShortly after the conclusion of their professional and entirely lawful investigation in the dwarven city of Praeaurum, the [Glorious Chucklefucks](https://i.imgur.com/DGeXclH.jpg) were rejoined by Noel Kiff, who had been absent from the Supercops investigation while attempting to have her legal status as heir to the kingdom of Mareacor validated. That is a story suitable for a tale on its own, but for now suffice it to say that Noel had been named the official heir to the throne, and as such had been appointed a royal bodyguard for the duration of her travels: a half-orc mercenary named John Anec, Spencer's character.\n\nReunited with Noel, the Chucklefucks do what they always do between adventures: wait for another adventure to fall into their laps. This soon comes to pass, as Patrick is called back to one of the Planine Monks' monasteries (as he is, technically, still a monk) to deal with an emergency. Not long after, Trick sends his friends a letter explaining the situation: to prepare for the seemingly imminent war with Praeaurum, the Monks had recalled all their assets from around the world back to their central monastery. When that situation had been defused, the Monks' forces had disbanded and returned to their various tasks abroad. One group, which had been studying a recently-discovered uncharted island (which the PCs had visited [once before](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/36hl8z/dd_5e_the_dangers_of_ogres_and_shrooms/)), returned to the island to find that it had been overrun by assholes who matched the descriptions of the shadowy organization which had been antagonizing the Chucklefucks during this plot arc. The Monks had called Patrick and other skilled fighters back to guard the Astral Gate leading to the island in order to prevent any of the invaders from leaving, hoping to starve them out. Patrick, thinking that this was bullshit, advised the PCs to find their way to the island themselves and stop whatever the people who had taken the island were planning.\n\nThe PCs agree, and set out at once. Undeterred by the fact that none of them knew where the island was, having washed up there at random after a shipwreck last time, they decide to board a ship and just figure it out. This works as well as one might expect, and while drifting in the middle of the ocean accomplishing fuck all, Wade rolls for Something to Happen. He rolls well, and somehow out of fucking nowhere a massive rogue wave appears (the result of a stirring Leviathan, unbeknownst to them at the time) and the party once again finds their ship rekt. The dice gods smile upon them, and they wash up on the shores of the same remote island that they seek.\n\nThe island's native inhabitants have all been slaughtered, and mutant goons patrol the beach. One such patrol spots the Chucklefucks, but he is quickly dispatched by a reanimated Shamus Cooper. This would be a bigger reveal if I hadn't already mentioned it in the finale. Shamus recounts how the islanders had used spooky tribal magic n' shit to bring him back to life, gaining 2spooky4me undead powers in exchange for the loss of his free will; he was bound to obey the islanders' orders. This ceased to be much of a drawback with all of them dead, but it meant that their standing orders that he not leave the island or approach the obelisk at its center still bound him. This same obelisk, unfortunately, was where the majority of the mutants had set up shop. Although he could provide a diversion, Shamus could not aid the Chucklefucks in battle against the mutants' main camp.\n\nWith this in mind, the Chucklefucks devise a plan to stealthily infiltrate the mutants' camp set up around the obelisk, which proceeds swimmingly until the tar lake surrounding the obelisk gets set on fire and a shit ton of motherfuckers teleport in and start attacking the mutants. Battle ensues, and the Chucklefucks bum-rush through the chaos to the obelisk. On the way, they encounter one of the attackers, a giant woman with golden eyes and a huge fuckoff axe, who asks the Chucklefucks if they oppose the people she's fighting. Receiving a positive response, the woman declares that they are, for the time being, on the same side, and joins the Chucklefucks in their charge to the obelisk. Her wizard parts and creates bridge over the inferno surrounding the monument, and the group rushes up to find a sinister-looking fuck and several goons attempting to do some spooky shit to the obelisk. Since talking is a free action, the giant woman and the sinister man proceed to spell out the situation to the Chucklefucks:\n\nThe old gods, the deities worshiped before The Year of the Dead Moon, that whole apocalypse two thousand years ago which the Chucklefucks averted, had awoken from a long slumber and were pissed off that the mortal races now worshiped new, false gods. So pissed, in fact, that they had decided to destroy the world. Without worshipers, though, they were powerless to do it themselves, and had contacted Adam, the sinister man, and his organization to help them do it. The giant woman, Sarah, was the head of a group trying to save the world and kill the gods, even though their death might very well lead to the end of the whole universe within a few centuries (which isn't what happens, but they didn't know that at the time). Having learned this, the Chucklefucks have to decide whom to side with.\n\nNormally, faced with such a decision, the players would spend a great deal of time debating the issue out of character, sometimes as long as the entire session, before reaching a consensus and taking action. This time, however, they took a different approach: they decided to have their characters act simultaneously, siding with whichever group they preferred, without consulting each other. Those actions would then play out, and let the dice fall where they may. I was intrigued by this approach, and let it proceed.\n\nThe result was that Noel, Mendax, and Friedrich wound up supporting Sarah, while John Anec and Nathaniel killed several of Sarah's soldiers and fled across the battlefield to join Adam. Battle commences, with PCs on either side. Shit is intense for a bit, but Noel quickly blows her sorcerous load taking out Anec, and Nathaniel gives up in the face of three PCs, one of whom being Friedrich Eisenberg; he betrays Adam and throws him into the tar fire, to his presumed death, and the battle is quickly won. John Anec, however, has one last surprise up his sleeve. He gets back up after rolling a 20 on a death save, and takes his action to smash the magic crystal which had been suppressing the aura of batshit insanity which the obelisk gives off. Only Friedrich and Sarah, both immune to mind magic, remain standing, while everyone else collapses in madness and Nathaniel and Mendax fall comatose. Well fuck, you might say. Sarah and the Chucklefucks, minus Anec, teleport out to regroup, having disabled the means by which Adam had planned to awaken the horrorterror inside the obelisk. John Anec, meanwhile, departs, his plans unknown.\n\nOne more tale between this and the finale, after which I'll post some other old stories from the Chucklefuck campaign and then...who knows?",

        "text": "Previous session here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3lh7mg/beyond_the_wall_session_7_of_merriment_and_drama/\n***\nLast session the party enjoyed the merriment of the Solstice Festival, a nice break from the rather hard time they had been having, between the goblins and the bandits. Each member shared their own separate tales of a good time, but as the night winded down they headed their own ways. That was before the black sky was pierced by an angry red fireball descending from above…\n\nThe Cast of Characters includes:  \nLindsey as *Perdenzia, the Fae Foundling*  \nDJ as *Arrow, the Would-be Knight*  \nCaitlin as *Freya Pendragon Kirkwall, the Forgotten Noble Child*  \nRiley as *Caligeth ‘Cal’ Darwinus, the Apprentice Court Sorcerer*  \n\nThe boulder, wreathed in oil and flames, struck down in the northern section of Lundenfeld. It landed in the streets, creating a wide crater and tossing bits of stone and other loose material into the nearby houses. Arrow feels the impact of the attack, knocking over the discarded mugs of beer as he rushes upstairs, shaking his betrothed awake. He warns her that the village is under attack of some sort, and bids her to get home as quickly as possible. He dashes outside as another fireball hits a house, sending it reeling apart with flaming splinters. Without thinking too much, he rushes over and helps a grieving female and male escape. They inform him one of their children is still inside, and the hopeful knight dashes inside to save them.\n\nPerry had been walking the streets, and rushes to the royal summer home to warn Freya. The guards are already alert, the two stationed at the gate unbudging and unwilling to let Perry inside the compound. But the princess hears her friend’s shouts through the window, and leaves Leo in the guest bed while she heads outside to investigate, pushing her way through the hired help that is now fully aware of the attack, hurriedly moving about to help clear the royal family. All the while more of the fireballs are descending upon the village (I had an hourglass that was set to three minutes). Arrow pulls the injured child free of the burning ruins, and a thankful family cast upon him many blessings. Another house is struck, and he again finds himself in harm’s way, holding the door frame in place as the family ran free. He warns them of the attack, and asks for their help in evacuating the north-eastern section of the village, where the majority of the attacks seem to be currently. Meanwhile, Freya has grouped up with Perry, and managed to induce some complicated mathematics to find the arc of the fireballs. They seem to be coming from deep within the forest, and the two set off to the stables to get Cal and some horses, skirting the path cast with craters.\n\nBut when they get there, it is abandoned. In the center of the riding area is a dead horse, hide filled with arrows. Many footprints, both human and goblin, lead away into the woods. It would appear that Cal and Sun were nabbed. They move to the stables and calm down the horses that had not yet escaped, taking them and riding off into the woods. In the village, Arrow had gathered the worried citizens into the Sage and Tankard, Perry’s parent’s tavern. He bid them to stay calm, and remain inside until the attack was over. What worried them all though, is that the number of fireballs was increasing. It had started with one, but was steadily rising, and becoming more co-ordinated. Arrow ran to Charlotte’s house, urging her and her family to seek refuge in the tavern as well.\n\nAs Perry and Freya rode through the wood, the former spotted a lone goblin archer waiting in the woods. Both stopped their horses, and Perry drew her bow as Freya started to ascend the tree. Perry’s arrow flew true, striking it in the chest and almost knocking it off the branch. It tried to shoot back, but its arm was injured and could not shoot straight. Freya reached the branch and swung true with her axe, gouging the goblin’s chest and sending it tumbling to the ground. Freya descended the tree and the group moved on.\n\nThey reach a large clearing filled with many goblins of all castes, and seven large catapults as well. It is from these that they’re launching the fireballs at the city, which are falling by a higher count even now. The two teenage adventurers were unsure how to proceed, but were fortunate in a visit from Ashby the Crow, who wanted to warn them of the attack, as well as a goblin war party heading towards Lundenfeld. They asked for his help, and in a rare case of crow sympathy, he agreed. He flew off and gathered eight of his crow brothers and sisters, ready for war. They all decide to attack the catapults in hopes of stopping the artillery barrage, and that Arrow and the other villagers can hold off the war party.\n\nThe crows lead the attack, swooping low in the dim light and striking true at three goblins, striking one with vicious pecking and clawing, and wounding two others. One of the goblins abandons the catapult and tries to strike Freya, who dodges out of the way, swinging her axe around to kill her attacker. As the crows peck and caw, one is slashed out of the air by a goblin, the limp bird body hitting the ground. Both Perry and Freya have back-to-back nat 20s, and display an impressive mastery of combat as they complement each-other’s long range and short range skills, felling two more goblins in the blink of an eye. Unfortunately, the crows do not share the luck, and are quickly plucked out of the sky, falling dead until only Ashby remains. He promptly flees the scene. Perry kills another with her arrow, and Freya deliver a coup de grace on the last goblin. One catapult down. But they look on in horror, as six are still very much operational, tossing destructive hellfire upon the small village, which has taken severe damage by this point. And the war party gets ever closer…\n\nThe two friends grit their teeth and charge towards the next catapult, swinging blade and notching arrow. Before the goblins can ready themselves, two are dead and two more are wounded. But will it be enough?",

        "author": "duno666",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3mcjkv/vtmshort_the_new_adventures_of_jalees_kamal_part/",
        "text": "[&lt;&lt; Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3k4yjw/vtmmedlongthe_new_adventures_of_jalees_kamal_part/)\n\nAt this turn of events, I gave Friend ST a glance. He was serious. A Dark Thaumaturgy Toreador and a freakin’ Mage.\n\nWell, allll-righty then.\n\nThe PCs were in a pretty dangerous spot. Less so as they had surprised the two occupants, but more so when the two occupants started throwing fire and brimstone about. There is a well known issue with fire, in that once it has left the control of the caster, it behaves like regular fire. While a concentrated blast of icky green fire is highly effective against whatever the target is, it is also highly effective against any flammable materials in the area around and behind said target.\n\nApparently, they didn’t mind if the building burnt down around them, as long as the PCs were dead before it happened.\n\nThere is another well documented issue with fire, especially for Licks - fire can lead people to go crazy. Vamps call this ‘Rötschreck’, German for ‘Red Fear’. Fire can make Licks go right out of their mind in fear, and attempt to bug out in the most direct way possible, with no amount of vocal chastising or encouragement affecting any change. Fortunately, only one fell under this during the opening salvo of fire from the two heretics. Unfortunately, it was Sense.Gangrel, the most deadly in a straight up fight, and the pack’s heavy bruiser and tank.\n\nWhich would usually have spelled ‘certain doom’ for the pack, had Sweeps Squad not be there to help. Secondary problem, however, was that Sweeps Squad was following behind the PCs at some distance, and had yet to enter the haven yet. They got a good look at Sense.Gangrel as he ran, frenzied, and quickened their pace towards the defensive retreat that the rest of Pack Common Sense was performing.\n\nThe next person that Sense.Gangrel ran into surprised him and gave him pause: Jalees. Which was good, because it caused Sense.Gangrel to not activate his Celerity that round, allowing Jalees to reach out and lock the Beast of Sense.Gangrel away for a time, bringing him back to rational thought. Sense.Gangrel thanked Jalees, who merely spun him around and pushed him back towards the fight.\n\nBack in the fight, things were not going well. Sweeps Squad had made it into the room, and had been carefully maneuvering to get behind the two targets, and were almost in position when everything started going right:\n\nSense.Assamite made a perfect roll for Scorpion’s Touch against the Mage, hitting him from afar with the Stamina draining poison not once, but twice, completely tanking his Stamina and causing him to lose consciousness. Sense.Gangrel leapt into the fray, in his shiny black-coated dire wolf form, landing right on the Toreador and knocking him to the ground. Toreador did not last long under the fangs of Sense.Gangrel, who was pulled off in time to not ash Toreador flat out. Sweeps Squad carefully held their Obfuscated locations, in case of further issues.\n\nJalees appeared in the doorway, and with a few hand waves the fires went out, and only the rosy, healthy glow of his own hand-flame lit the room in a warm, hearth-like light. He congratulated the PCs on their excellent work, and told them to come outside with him while Sweeps Squad cleared everything up. They did, and they did. The mortal was quickly bound, gagged and blinded, and the Toreador was carefully staked. Both were carried outside into the waiting van, and carted off to Esbat.\n\nThe Archbishop oscillated between ecstatic and furious at least eight times in a five minute period as the PCs relayed the story to the gathered Cainites. The tale had been punched up a little by Jalees during their transit back to Esbat in his private car, and he - in clear and concise terms - told them to not mention his involvement until the very end, where they called his contact number and he arrived to pick them and the troublemakers up. He confirmed the story, indicating that he and Sweeps Squad had already found the treatment plant on a routine sweep of things and disabled all of the traps, but found no evidence to make them suspect it has any specific Lick’s hideout, and so left it alone. They were chasing other leads when he got the call, and immediately called everyone in to help.\n\nThe PCs got a bit of status, Jalees had no (reported) direct involvement in things and managed to one-up the Inquisition at the same time, and Sweeps Squad had a new hideout to use, pre-furnished with traps and multiple escape paths. Things were going well in the Domain.\n",

        "text": "So having [collapsed a building](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3hvkk8/starcraft_rpg/) on the ultralisk pursuing them, the party made its way to the Chau Sara spaceport, hoping to beg, borrow, or steal a transport off-world. No such luck for them- not only were the skies thick with mutalisks and scourge, another ultralisk rampaged across the tarmac, killing people, and shattering parked ships.\nRealizing they had nowhere else to go, they went to the capital square, joining a line of siege tanks abandoning the spaceport. There, the governor was rallying the remains of the local defense forces, welding up bunkers, erecting missile towers, etc. The party was welcomed- offered a decent meal and a quick rest in exchange for joining the defenders.\n\nAs they ate, a thin, somewhat weasely-looking gentleman approached them, introducing himself as the vice-governor. He offered the players a deal- help him recover some documents the governor was concealing from the confederacy, and he would bring them with him off-world.  The party was all too eager to agree, as was another new player and his marine.\n\nEven in the midst of crisis, the governor's office was under guard- a pair of armored marines guarded the door. Edna opted to distract them by faking a heart attack, which they were certainly dumb enough to believe. As one guard ran for a medic, the other attempted to stabilize the 'poor random civilian', allowing the group to walk right in, while their marine offered to stand guard.  Once inside, they checked every nook and cranny, eventually finding a rather hefty briefcase hidden in a cabinet.\nIt was at this point the governor arrived, and he was *furious*. He and his bodyguards stormed right into the office and began threatening to shoot all of them unless someone told him what they were doing (in which case he implied he would only shoot the vice-governor). The party hemmed and hawed for a couple moments, until the party marine (guarding the door for the governor like a good little soldier!) whipped it open and shot all three of them. With a crit.\n\nWith the governor dead, the vice-governor told them all they had to do was bring him and the briefcase to the gov's private shuttle bay- They could drop him off at Tarsonis, and they could keep it or sell it or whatever. \n\nAs they rushed across the capitol grounds to the hangar, the zerg began another assault. The vice-governor punched in the code, and the doors rumbled open, revealing a pristine Dropship! As the party rushed to enter it and fire up the engines, hydralisks and zerglings burrowed into the hangar. Al (Now officially nicknamed 'Twitchy' after the Ultralisk incident) and edna fired up the engines, while the rest of the party held the creatures at bay. As the dropship chugged its way out, a single hydralisk leapt for the door, pinning it open...until the Marine kicked it in the face. Repeatedly. \nAs the doors closed and the ship broke orbit, they got to see enormous flashes as giant golden ships entered the system. They immediately began scouring the planet with massive plasma beams, turning everything into molten glass. The party briefly feared for their life, but that feeling passed, as Confederate battlecruisers arrived as well!\n\nExcept they seemed to hang back, not engaging the mysterious alien craft, instead demanding the dropship prepare for boarding?!\nTO BE CONTINUED!",

Homebrew, low magic world. Lots of military action and politics. The players:\n\nHholacar (me): human ranger. TWF/Archer as needed. Tries to keep the group alive, repair damage when able, and make decisions when allowed (see below). Pelorite \n\nOrthund: half elf paladin. Melee machine, homebrew PrC makes him really great v. Undead, takes a hit really well. Also our only healer, quiet type, rival-become-friend of Hholacar. Heironean\n\nUlmardrac, human monk. Very zealous, terrible rolls in combat (relevant to this story) but gets very into RP, also buddy of Hholacar. Also very suspicious of NPCs. Cuthbertian\n\nDrorlost, haggling rogue. Lovable scoundrel, also like to do damage control in RP. Combat effectiveness varies, only character better a t stealth than Hholacar. Religion unknown. \n\nConacar, human fighter: boisterous, glory seeking fighter. Often takes charge and speaks over Hholacar, with whom he frequently butts heads. \n\nOur party became heavily involved in a revolution led by a former government licensed border bandit, Hehherod. We found out that Hehherod had lied about Orthund's sister being killed, and went to talk to him, and tell him we were going to rescue her from a forced marriage. Arriving at he throne room, Conacar attempted to shoulder past Orthund and enter first. Orthund and Hholacar were unable to hold him back, but Ulmardrac successfully tripped him. When he tried to stand and draw his sword, Ulmardrac used his AOO unarmed. \n\nNow, even entering double digits in a fight is miraculous for ulmardrac: entire sessions pass without him rolling above a natural 9. So, in his AOO, he rolls a Nat 20.\n\nOf ciurse, we freaked out with excitement as he rolled to confirm. \n\nAnother Nat 20.\n\nDM home rule is that this means a double crit, so ×4 damage. \n\n6+2=8, ×4=32... MAX damage. \n\nWith a cry of \"Orthund goes first!\" Ulmardrac knocked Conacar out cold. Everyone but Conacar's player lost their shit laughing. \n\nShould be noted there are no OOC conflicts, everyone is friends,RP just gets zealous sometimes. \n\nTl;dr monk one shots fighter on double crit\n\nLet me know if you guys want more.

Then again, where is the honor in that?\n\nI move along the belts, whizzing in and out while avoiding the fire of Guristas flocking in the belts themselves. I kept searching. and lo and behold, I find a Corax, a destroyer fitted with missiles. I knew this ship was a destroyer, I knew I was outgunned. But I had dual reps, so I felt invincible.\n\nI tear into the Corax's shield with my Ion Cannons, tech II. I notice I was doing rather poor damage. But this ship was not doing too well itself. It was using many Republic modules, so I figured I may have been outgunned. But that was not the case.\n\nThe corax was repairing its own shields, so I knew this would be a grind. With each volley I sent out into the vessel i slowly wore down its shields past what it could repair. I hit the armor of the ship, my guns melting the plates, its last defense. Then I hit the hull, and I shredded the structure with my rounds. I had destroyed a ship. On my own! Without any help!\n\nBut then went his escape pod.\n\nI was not going to let this moment slip. I was going to kill this man. There is no mercy, only trophies now. I locked him, and I killed him. It took only 2 shots.\n\nFinally, I had killed someone! Someone in this cruel New Eden. The rush, it has never been felt since then. It saddens me, being stuck to a trivial life of exploration and instant death in my ships. However, that was the best moment I have ever experienced in my gaming life. Good lord it was a rush.\n\n____\n\nby /u/maxd\n\nThis was about 7 years ago, playing WoW before one of my many hiatuses.\n\nMy girlfriend was away for the weekend and I had no plans. I logged into WoW early on Saturday and saw in trade chat \"LFM AV premade\". AV is Alterac Valley, a huge PvP battleground with 40v40 gameplay. You can traditionally only join as a group of 1-5 people, meaning you get matchmade with 35+ randoms to fill out your team.\n\nA \"premade\" basically circumvents this restriction using a mod, which (amazingly) just clicks the \"join\" button on all users in the raid group simultaneously, causing them to (most likely) enter the same game. The premade I joined had 35+ people, a Ventrilo channel, everything. I was there for the first game of the day, and with our added coordination of the Vent channel, we won the battleground pretty cleanly in 20-30 mins.\n\nAnd then we stuck together, replacing people who dropped out, keeping our ranks above 35 at all times. We had roles assigned in the game, attack squads got to know each other, we had people providing food and potions and enchants. When we entered a game, the 2-5 randoms who got matched with us were welcomed to \"The Medivh weekend AV premade\", promised a win, and told they could help, or just sit back and watch.\n\nWe played all day long. From 9am til midnight. I ordered in pizza, cleaned out the fridge, forgot to walk my dog. It was camaraderie at its finest. We got quicker and quicker at beating the battleground, down from 30 mins to a slim 6-7 mins, and I think some were even quicker than that. I lost track of how many times we did it. People fell asleep on Vent, only to wake up a couple of hours later to discover they were still being dragged through the premades with us, thanks to the mod. I added all the group as friends.\n\nWe weren't a group of randoms, we were an army to be feared. Soon the random pickups we saw started noticing us. \"Oh, it's Medivh. Can we join?\" It was clear the opposition had heard of us too.\n\nFinally, around midnight, the group disbanded. We were exhausted, full with honor points and reputation gains. We bid good night, and slept well, dreaming of towers and snow.\n\nThe next morning I logged back into WoW and immediately saw the fateful words. \"LFM AV premade.\" And yes, I did it all over again. 25-30 hours of AV, no losses. I had enough of the reputation currency (I forget what it was now...) to buy all the rewards twice over, and I've revelled in my damn Frostwolf Howler (a wolf you can ride on) since.\n\nTo put in context how fine a reward the Frostwolf Howler is, people would spend months grinding AV rep to get it, just because it was cheaper than the normal mounts. But, you needed to be Exalted with the Frostwolf clan, which at this point, I most certainly was.\n\n____\n\n/u/inflated_waffles\n\nI play a ton of SWTOR and focused mainly on PvP for most of my time spent playing.\n\nThere was one match on Novaire Coast that I will never forget.\n\nFor reference there are 3 station that you can capture. One off each teams spawn and 1 in the middle to be contested at the beginning of the match. At the time I was playing a sniper.\n\nI should also point out that I spent many hours on a training dummy mastering my cycles and at the time had about 1500 hours of time in the game playing PvP.\n\nThe game starts and I immediately make a break for their spawn side capture point. I pick up every power up on the way there. I get there and see one Assassin (stealth class) capturing the node. I get in range with my sniper and go for the interrupt, but I am stopped by another Assassin which was in stealth. He used a CC on me, which allowed his teammate to capture the node. Being a two on one fight now, I knew my CC break would be a waste this early into it, so I waited it out. By the time my CC was over both of them were back in stealth leaving me with the only option of starting to capture their node. But I knew that as soon as I did this one of them would break stealth to interrupt me. So I planted under cover and used a CD to keep me from being interrupted. They didn't know, but I wasn't wanting to capture, I was wanting to draw them out of stealth.\n\nAnd it worked. Both of them attempted to interrupt my capture which took them out of stealth. Now I can see both of them. I break the capture on my own and CC one of the Assassins and kite the other out of his LOS, attacking him and keeping my distance at the same time (I was ranged and they were melee).\n\nI start burning the first of my attackers with everything I have while his friend is unable to help. When the CC on the first one ends, the one I'm fighting uses combat stealth, leaving me with the full health Assassin. I use a root to keep him in one place and start the process over, throwing everything I have at him.\n\nAt this point the first Assassin comes out of stealth and starts attacking me. I throw out another CC on the second attacker and return my focus to the first, which finished him off. Now it's 1v1 and I still have 85% of my health.\n\nThe second attacker comes rushing in, which I deflect with a knock back which leaves him needing to rush at me all over again. This whole time I'm burning him down as fast as I can. I think to myself if I can kill both of them then I can solo capture and my team can have all three points.\n\nRight when I'm about to finish off the second Assassin the first one comes back from his respawn. I'm still at 85% health and my CC's are off cool down by this time so I root the returning attacker and I finish off his friend.\n\nThe returning attacker and I go at it again. Him struggling to get close enough to do damage and me kiting him and being on top of CC's and knock backs to keep him off of me. At about half his health left, the second Assassin returns, making the fight 2v1 for the second time. Rinse and repeat with CC's and knock backs leaves me with 4 kills from the same 2 attackers.\n\nAt this point I'm sitting at about 60% health and everything I have CD's, knock backs, heavy DPS abilitys, health packs, it's all on cool down. I'm locked out of everything. And guess who shows up again? The first Assassin, for the third time now. Don't these people know when to quit? Don't they know by now that I've got them beat?\n\nSo we go at it a third time (which would potentially be my 5th solo kill on one life). My lack of usable abilities due to CD's bring my health down to 35%, but he started at full health and is now at 50%, I'm burning him down faster than he can kill me. And even better, by the time I kill him and his friend gets back, I'll have all my abilities back and be able to survive.\n\nAnd then a healer from their team shows up and starts reversing all the damage I've been doing. Shit. Then 3 more of their team shows up. Double shit. All these people for me? Am I really that much of a bother? I guess I was.\n\nI died shortly after the group of their team showed up, but they had to sacrifice over half their team to get rid of me. What they didn't realize is that by sending so many resources my way, my team had enough time to capture our second point and keep it defended the rest of the match.\n\nI may have lost in the end of it all, but I put on a good show and probably made them bang their heads on their desks a few time. That game made me feel like I could win any duel. No one person could stop me, it took a team, and it felt great. All the practice and parsing and grinding came together in a beautiful match that allowed me to show all my talent.\n\nWell that's my 2 cents.\n\n____\n\nby /u/Deckard_Bane\n\nI was fairly new to Dota 2 a game known for its toxic community. I was the carry safe lane as gyro, minding my own business farming as usual. Suddenly every lane started to go terribly I died to a gank from mid, who quickly got out of hand, the offline was solo killed by their carry and I was getting no more farm. Everyone started to flame each other. About 15 min later the yelling wasn't stopping and the enemy was beginning their high ground push. I had been mostly silent for most of the game, but at this point, salt was at maximum and I was annoyed at myself. I typed in all caps SHUT YOUR MOUTHS AND PLAY THE GAME LIKE A TEAM! They stopped flaming just time to defend. The cocky enemies ran high ground, and were destroyed by a call down + echo slam, we then cleaned the rest of them up, Losing ES in the process. They pushed again, another fissure into call down, another base defense. I get enough money to buy a couple of items, my attacks aren't negligee able anymore. My team doesn't say a word in the entirety of the rest of the game. You could feel everyone's tension from the way they moved, the way the stayed locked up in base. The game stalled for a good 5 min, until they realized that they could do roshan, because we were all in base. Thanks to a well placed ward though we knew it was happening. We destroyed them in the pit and got the aegis. We pushed, now cocky from our short term victory. A beautiful play as they wiped our team and killed me twice. The game went back and forth for another 40 min of heart-pounding tension. All of this culminated in me buying a divine rapier, and our team wiping theirs. We pushed, with two racks down on both sides, and went straight for the throne. We won, and finally the chat burst out again, as everyone breathed a huge sigh of relief, and ended with a very apt gg wp.\n\n____\n\nby /u/3DJelly\n\nThis was in the late 90s. I was playing Yahoo Pool against this jerk who was taunting me the whole game. Unfortunately, he was pretty good, even though he had a poor Internet connection, as evidenced by the short, jerky movements of his cue stick throughout the game. Normally, I'm a good sport about losing fair and square, but despite the 15-second limit on each shot, he somehow found the time to tell me how much I suck and spam the chatbox with details of what he did with my mother the night before. It made me pretty mad, and the madder I got, the worse I played.\n\nRight before the end of the match, I got a lucky break when he somehow screwed up his final shot on the 8-ball and it stopped short of the quarter pocket. I was three balls behind, but the table was almost empty and I had clear shots. I sunk 2 of them on my turn, but got a scratch on my third shot, just one ball shy of my attempt on the 8-ball. He responded with even more trashtalk in the chatbox. He had a clear shot at the 8-ball just outside the quarter pocket and was absolutely going to win.\n\nIt's times like this, when I'm fuming, that I get really brilliant ideas. Yahoo Pool had a \"ping\" function that allowed you to see how badly the game might lag. With nothing to lose, I pulled up his profile and spam-clicked the \"ping\" button for all it's worth. Sure enough, his ping came back consistently above 700ms. His cue stick swung around even more wildly as he tried to aim straight. The slightest bump on the 8-ball would win him the game, so he finally took his shot with just 1 second left on the clock.\n\nHe MISSED.\n\nI had never felt so much evil joy within me as when I watched that cue ball bounce quietly off the rails on either side of the 8-ball and come to a stop a short distance away. I'd seen people rage-quit hundreds of times in over a dozen different video games, but none compared to watching that guy get up from that Yahoo Pool table and leave the room without a word. Most people on Yahoo Pool were pretty polite and I would never have bothered to be so petty. For this particular asshole, on the other hand, it was totally worth it.\n\n____\n\nby /u/Sonmii\n\nHalo 3 - on stage at an iSeries tournament. My team was seeded 8th and we drew the bracket to play 2nd seed team LowLandLions. We were down 2 maps I think, and on Narrows Team Slayer we're down again about 10 kills. Now, I wasn't known as the main slayer on my team, far from it. I was the objective guy, I would put down the most shots, run the flag, hold the ball, etc. But with my team all having an uncharacteristically bad game I thought, 'fuck this', and decided I wasn't going out of the tournament this early. It's nothing to some esports events now, but for me listening to the commentators getting hyped by my plays as I tore through that team, with an audience of a hundred or so people... that was fucking awesome. I went nuts in game and out as I ended the game 50-49 with a sticky to the face just as I was about to die. It seemed like I broke my team out of whatever state of mind they were in, we all got pumped for the next game and we brought the series back to advance. We ended up beating 1st seed so it was also very satisfying to completely outperform our initial expectations.\n\nHalo 2 - Just a stupid moment, but me and a friend still relive it to this day and somehow it becomes funnier every time. Beaver Creek, MLG Flag and as soon as the game begins we boost each other out of the roof of the base, port through to the back of their base and jump in the roof. So it's only about 20 seconds in and the announcer exclaims to the enemy team \"FLAG TAKEN\", and we just hear this yank, who sounds thoroughly at the end of his tether, whine \"Oh my God, they're in our baaaaaase\". My friend has the most contagious laughter, we both just lost it.\n\nWoW - Doing Rated Battlegrounds at very high rating (like 2700 rating or so) and we are the ultimate PvE heroes. What this means is basically we had special gear from killing dragons and such, that we could use on players who merely had the run-of-the-mill PvP gear. I'm talking items that sometimes shoots out extra Shadowbolts from your spells, another with a chance to duplicate spells, proc a massive burst heal on your teammate, and so on. So we'd match these super-serious PvP players and just take massive steaming dumps on them, because we were already decent at PvP in the first place, battlegrounds in many ways were about maximising damage and we were very good at that from our Dragon-slaying ways, and we had the gear advantage. So anyway, there was a video uploaded by some semi-famous Warrior facing against our wee team where they are just completely outraged, and end up just raging at our ridiculous damage as they died, over and over again, spawning on their graveyard. Also whenever we matched anyone streaming on twitch, we'd hop on after the game and have a good laugh on vent as they inevitably exlcaimed their outrage at losing. It might not be fair, but damn it was fun.\n\nLoL - camping Fnatic player Rekless' Riven over and over wtih Shyvana jungle. Just diving him repeatedly, zoning him from CS, and generally making his life hell. Tasty. Also any time I play a team fight perfectly as a support. Once you have several active items there is a tonne you can do and you know that your team probably don't even notice half of it, but it's very satisfying to lack the 'power' of other roles with higher stats yet still be able to control a fight purely through timing of spells and items, basically being forced to outplay opponents rather than just overpowering them.\n\n____\n\nby /u/disgustipate\n\nUltima Online, this was a very long time ago. My dad was one of the few glorious lords on the server back when it was a very difficult thing to do. He also had a kryss of vanquishing and his damn house key on him.\n\nHe's attacked by two reds and he's like a deer in headlights. I happened to be watching him at the time. These pks were surgical and his health bar was dropping fast. He literally starts shaking so bad that he can't hold onto his mouse. I yell at him to get up quick and am able to run his character around for a couple minutes with them close on my tail.\n\nI'm barely able to Kal Ort Por out of there with sliver of health and both of them on screen screaming Corp Por. That feeling when the screen changed and we were safe back in town... so awesome.\n\n",

        "text": "Our party, consisting of a fighter, a rogue (who thinks he is a wizard), a paladin, and myself, a ~~warlock~~ private investigator with no magical abilities whatsoever, recently found themselves in a swamp after a clusterfuck culminating in a diplomatic mission to retrieve a landlocked magic shell for vengeful merpeople. Although I know the area well enough to remember a cave system where the shell may be found, the sun has gone down and we set up camp. The \"wizard\" sets his familiar on guard and we go to sleep. \n\nOf course, we get woken up and ambushed by bullywugs. Although the rogue and the paladin manage to pop two of the bastards, they do a fair amount of damage to me. One Nature check crit-failed later, and I know these bastards are like ants- their numbers are near infinite, and our only chance is to run away. Unfortunately, we are surrounded, so I gamble and manage to charm one of the bastards, speak to the frog telepathically, and claim I am the bullywug king. \n\nThis stops their attack, and they begin to bow down to me and lead me away. I tell the rest of my party to follow me, since I'm not suicidal, and we all head to a clearing with a rather large bullywug sitting near the center of it. The bullywug addresses me, in broken common, and the following exchange commences:\n\n\"Hello?\"\n\n\"Hello, who are you? Are you the bullywug king?\"\n\n\"Yes...\"\n\n\"Wrong. I'm the bullywug king. These guys here support it. You must be a usurper!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"That's right, motherfucker, I'm challenging you to a duel!\"\n\nThe King agrees and we set the ground rules. Weapons are prohibited, whoever dies or runs away loses. What the King didn't know was that I had an interesting spell known as \"Dissonant Whispers\" that caused damage AND potentially causes the target to run away from the scene. The bullywug king charges me and faceplants hard into the ground, allowing me to cast the spell and...\n\n...nothing. He passed the goddamn Wisdom check and only took 5 damage. At this point he gets up and tongue punches me so hard I drop to 1 HP and ruin my previously flawless face. At this point, both mortified and terrified, I yell that I forgot one of the rules- we're allowed to bring associates with us. Sadly, I can't convince the King that only I am allowed to do this and both the rest of my party and three more bullywug are now in the chaotic brawl. The rest of my party gang up on the poor bullywug king while I am the only one to take any more damage and end up lying in the mud with a broken nose and shattered pride. At this point, the fighter, regrettably, grabs the bullywug... most precious possessions and yanks, causing the king to jump and take two separate attacks of opportunity from the paladin and the rogue who manage to deal a ton of unarmed damage to him. At this point the paladin rushes up and asks the king if he wants to quit, to which the king asks if that is okay with the \"rule man\". The paladin looks over to my unconscious body and says it is okay. Then everybody (including myself) fail to roll anything useful for a medicine check until the fighter gets his friendly neighborhood bullywug doctor to heal the new king. \n\nWhen I come to, I make an offer- if the former bullywug king can give me the location of the shell, I would let him live. He agrees and tells me, and I make another offer- since I didn't want to live in the swamp for the rest of my life and recreate Heart of Darkness I made another offer to him- if he gave me all of his medical supplies I would cede the kingship to him.\n\nAt this point, the former bullywug king agrees, but adds that, due to my fair treatment, I would forever be considered their high King and they would never attack myself or my party ever again. In addition, whenever I am in the swamp from now on I can call on them for aid. I essentially became a king without having to deal with any of the responsibilities.\n\nI wonder how much diplomatic clout \"King of the Swamp\" has. Probably a whole lot.",

        "text": "So a few months ago I decided to take the leap and buy the 5e starter set. My friends and I had talked about doing some D&amp;D for a while and now was the time.\n\nThis story is about a specific friend, let's call him Nate. Nate picked the pre-made warrior class for this campaign, while I DM'd. We had two other characters, a rouge and a cleric. I know Nate pretty well, so once he got finished reading through his sheet I assumed what he was thinking. \"You want to be a werewolf right?\"\n\n\"Hell yes.\"\n\nSo we made up a rule that he turns if he feels a certain amount of intense emotion. I don't know how werewolves work in D&amp;D, but this is my game so I get to make the rules. Anyway the group starts going through the game (Lost Mines of Phandelver) and we're figuring out how the combat and everything works as we go.\n\nEventually we reach a cave. It was decided that, because Nate is part wolf, he has some kind of communion with animals. It's a good thing too because the first encounter in this cave is a pair of chained up guard wolves. He says that he wants to try and become friends with them. Alright go for it, this is fun. He rolls high enough so I say he has no problem getting past and the thief kobold rolls stealth to hide behind Nate's legs. \n\nThe Cleric gets left behind, for now, but this isn't about him. At the other end of the room there is a chute that leads straight up to the boss room. The boss is a huge troll dude with a big mace. The thief is being stealthy and taking shots with her shot bow, until finally she fails a stealth roll and is noticed. Big guy comes over and Nate jumps out from where he was hiding to attack. Misses. Big guy swings his mace.\n\nNatural 20. Shit.\n\nNate is smacked right up side the head, smacks into the wall behind him, and drops well below 0 hitpoints. Oh hey look, his natural instincts kick in and he's now a werewolf. The tun cycle goes and by this point the cleric has made it up to the room. When it gets back to Nate I ask him what he wants to do, expecting something like \"Maul his face,\" or \"Gouge his eyes out\". This is not what Nate says. Nate says, \"I want to shoot him with my bow.\"\n\nReally Nate? Your bow? You do realize you have paws right? You'll barely be able to hold it let alone shoot it! Dude's cracking up at this point, and since I'm a fan of shenanigans I let him go for it.\n\nNatural. Fucking. 20.\n\nSo this werewolf, injured and blinded with rage, stands up, takes out his bow, hooks his claws around the string and pulls it ***all*** the way back. And fires it straight through the guy's brain. The thief proceeds to slice his neck and finish him off. There was also later stuff involving a wrestling match with his wolf pet, and later some friendly ogers and a broken glass staff, but this fight in particular took the cake and lead me straight into my new-found love of tabletop roleplaying games. Since then I've DM'd 3 sessions (using a homebrew system called uRealms) and played in one GURPS session.",

        "text": "A continuation of the tale started in: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3jwqv0/werewolf_the_apocalypse_how_my_first_session/\n\nSo, second session of Werewolf happened today and we had kind of figured that this session would focus on being accepted by a spirit for our pack totem.\n\nWe also had out deed names, which for 3 out of 4 of us was perfectly okay.  Tells-the-Tale for my Galliard, since my Ecuador adventure couldn't exactly be talked about much.  Finds-the-Path for our Philodox who had been a park ranger in training before he had his first transformation.  Walks-the-Web for our Glasswalker Ragabash(whose first name is Wade...and thus he is WWW).  And then finally for our Theurge, who some may remember ended up with a face full of knives...Catches-the-Knife.  She was less than pleased with this.\n\nNow, out of character we'd all looked through the lists and kind of agreed on who we wanted as a Pack Totem.  We'd chosen Raven because it sounded like it would work out well for us.  However, first we had to decide on it in character, and so we were all asked to think of a totem or two to suggest IC and we'd then have a discussion.\n\nOne conversation later we ended up with Coyote as our planned totem spirit.  I have to say this was one of my favorite role playing moments because we knew what we wanted OOC, but by playing our characters as they really would act we picked another one entirely.\n\nThe conversation went something like this:\n-Everyone suggests one.\n-No one agrees.\n-Galliard(me) puts foot in mouth multiple times due to snark.\n-Agree to disagree.\n-End up picking a spirit of Cunning, and from there Coyote because it fits out pack.\n\nNot only that, but the conversation took a good 30-45 minutes and it was absolutely wonderfully fun.\n\nNot to mention, my car had finally arrived from where it was left in Ecuador.  [The alleged car.](http://drivenautos.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/beater.jpg)\n\nThus from there we had to find a Coyote, and luckily there was a Coyote exhibit at the local zoo.  So off we go!  Upon arrival we check out the exhibit, then decide our theurge would go into the Umbra to check for an actual coyote spirit there.\n\nSo the theurge hops over by going to the bathroom and sidestepping from the stall and starts talking to the coyote spirit that was there.  This...did not go as planned.  Our theurge had the coyote basically trip her up over her words and talk circles around her.\n\nUpon realizing how much time she was taking the rest of us decided to go over as well.  So we all go to the bathroom.  Two of us sidestep just fine...our Ragabash failed, and had someone ask from the next stall over if they were okay due to the noises coming from the stall.\n\nWith the philodox and I present we managed to get our point and desire across and were given a task to be accepted.  There was a pregnant coyote and her mate in enclosure, we had to take them home.\n\nAnd thus we had to break into the zoo at night to release them, and upon some further investigation realized that we would have to take them back to Arizona.\n\nSurprisingly the break in and rescue went flawlessly, partly because our Ragabash had some absolutely prodigious roles to hack the zoo cameras.  And with little trouble we ended up on our road trip to Arizona.  The only issues being a random cat spirit deciding to scratch up my Galliard, and the coyotes using the Theurge as a chew toy along the way.\n\nUpon arrival in Arizona we drop the Coyotes off with a small reservation that our former park ranger philodox was able to find out about and had our Ragabash sign off on it using one of his many fake identities.  This being because he was the only non-minor US citizen present.  The other three of us were a minor, a german uni student, and a traveling hobo.\n\nCoyote shows up again, tells us good job, and then gives us one minor task to complete his acceptance of us.\n\nWe have to prank an Elder.\n\nWell this oughta be interesting.  Most of the trip back to our Cairn is spent discussing this, with various ideas of various quality.  Finally we settle on something somewhat appropriate, we'll do a prank that teaches a lesson as well knowing that sure it may irritate some of the elders but it -is- for our pack totem so maybe it won't be too bad.\n\nWe decide to send out some messages to each of the 4 elders that all lead to a puzzle which they have to work together to solve and which will lead them to a conference room in which we were waiting.  In which we were waiting with a small party for them including cake and ice cream.  We just rolled for it because none of us were creative enough to actually come up with one.\n\nOnce they arrive my galliard gives a speech(the content of which was provided by the philodox).  To put it simply the idea was, “Working together good.  Not every little puzzle is super important.  Sometimes things get taken a bit seriously that don't need to be.”\n\nThe Warder is furious letting loose a wave of rage at it and demands -why- we would do such a thing.\n\nWith a perfectly straight face I reply, “Because Coyote.”\n\nThis sends him storming out of the room, another elder is almost as angry and demands we meet her later to...discuss this.\n\nThe last two, including the Master of Rites don't mind it quite as much, the Master of Rites accepts it as a Coyote thing and takes advantage of the cake.  And then Coyote shows up to congratulate us on a job well done and to have some cake himself.\n\nAnd that's where the session ended, with us having a party, a new pack totem spirit, and two elders pissed at us with one likely demanding tasks of us as reperations.",

        "text": "After last week's session, we gather again in the cells of forced gladiatorial games. Caroline, Kut'keshi, and Bearington all get new cellmates; Grippy the Goblin with two hook hands for Caroline (they become friends), Edgar Mercator the Nethys worshiper (and mapmaker!) for Kut'keshi, and Neviel the purple-haired Witch (and PC) for Bearington. Also, I pass out notes written on toilet paper to the players. \"It's the only way to conceal notes in prison\" I say, stealing ideas from V for Vendetta.\n\nThe week they have to live is coming to a close, and the notes inform them that there's gonna be a jailbreak soon. The six prisoners are pulled in to the arena in a 3-way fight between them and the top 2 teams of the arena. Maximus Decimus Meridius Decimus Maximus Meridius Decimus returns from previous encounters, along with his sole teammate Arlan the Chained, looking to get revenge on Caroline for shearing his twin sister in to 4 pieces. The other team is a HOrc bard (arena grand champion), a Hellknight-in-training, a cannibal woman (pretending to be a man pretending to be a woman), and a cultist using the crossbowslinger's masterwork repeating light crossbow.\n\nCombat starts, and Edgar Mercator reveals that he is a complete and total wuss, hiding away in a corner doing full defense. Combat for everyone else is pretty normal for the first round, but Kut'keshi (crossbowslinger) yells out to Grippy to help, and the hook-handed little bastard says \"No, I'm gonna SURVIVE!\"\n\nBefore his first turn, the cultist gets a double crit on him and blows his head clean off. Oops? And the party thought he was going to be important.\n\nAs the second full round of combat starts (12 people! Plus Grippy, but... you know...) Edgar runs into the middle of the stadium, pulls out a Scroll of Plot Advancement, and starts chanting something while a glowing light appears above him. The cultist shoots him in the leg, Hannibal the woman-man-woman Cannibal gets killed pretty easily, and all in all things are going to hell. Then, at the start of the third round, poof! Bright light, shining everything, and then... Everyone in the battleground of the arena is in the middle of the forest!\n\nAaaand they keep fighting. Not everyone is a slave, after all- though one of the combatants (Arlan) runs the hell away after realizing he isn't going to win this easily. How does he come to this conclusion? Well, Neviel the Witch casts Slumber on the arena champion, and then a bear coup de graces him, ripping him to shreds. This act is later repeated after the Druid stabilizes a dying gladiator, only to have his bear Coup de Grace him right afterwards.\n\nAfter finishing off all of the remaining opponents, they set up camp and do all that good stuff. At this point, Caroline leaves IRL (which was expected) and the party's Oracle shows up (also expected), does nothing, and then leaves (which wasn't expected).\n\nThen Edgar Mercator asks where the hell they are, because it isn't where the scroll was supposed to take them. \"Well,\" the party says after a few rolls, \"that way is North.\" And Edgar replies with a hearty \"Well that's not good at all.\" You see, the big-ass mountain to the north is the SOUTHERN border of the country they were in a minute ago, and there are 1) no easy ways back in, and 2) Edgar and their benefactor kind of want to topple said country (and the party kind of does, too). So they're stranded with no contact with \"Lord Geraldine Magnam\", they lack anyone with real social skills, and they have 16 gold between them (as Arena money was paid in copper that was treated as gold for the Arena). Oh, and that money is Romanese money, not Garatian (the loose collection of city-states they're in).\n\nSo Edgar lets them know their options for moving: North, to the mountains with angry Dwarves and possibly dragons, west to a desert and gigantic Romanese military outpost, south to the main/capital city of Garan, or east to forest, bandits, and pirates. Half the party wants to go east, the other half south, so they go east and resolve to hit up the city at a later date.\n\nAfter a day of travelling, they meet two drunken huntsman in the woods, who help them find a nearby village. A tiny village. They buy some local booze called Bear Piss for Caroline after selling an old crossbow for some actual Garatian gold, and end up staying the night there. Then they level up (except the Oracle and Rogue).\n\nAll in all, it's looking like the major players fulfill the \"Standard party\" setup. A frontliner (Barbarian 2/Fighter 1 HOrc), a ranged user (Undine Gunslinger 2/Ranger 1), an Arcane caster (Witch 3), and a Divine caster (Druid 3).\n\nBut damnit the bear still has the highest Charisma mod.",

        "text": "Previous session here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3klic9/beyond_the_wall_session_6_of_stolen_trees_and/\n***\nThe party, minus the recuperating Arrow, had been traipsing about in the woods with a posse of male villagers, hunting for strange sightings of goblins in the woods. They really stirred up the hornet’s nest, uncovering the goblins in league with some strange abomination and stealing trees. They headed back to the village, eager to forget their troubles with the solstice festival. I think this became our ‘Beach Episode’.\n\nThe Cast of Characters includes:  \nLindsey as *Perdenzia, the Fae Foundling*  \nDJ as *Arrow, the Would-be Knight*  \nCaitlin as *Freya Pendragon Kirkwall, the Forgotten Noble Child*  \nRiley as *Caligeth ‘Cal’ Darwinus, the Apprentice Court Sorcerer*  \n\nPerry, Freya, and Cal exit the woods with the posse, heading back down the road toward the village. Meanwhile, Arrow is resting in his home, being tended to by his fiancee. Outside, the whole village is bustling with activity, hanging lights set up, the band testing their instruments, and all sorts of food being carted out by the vendors. Perry’s parents are opening up all of their kegs for tonight at the Sage and Tankard, because it’s a time to celebrate the beginning of the summer.\n\nArrow is woken by Charlotte and asked if they can go dancing, the sound of the band fiddling away below. While still sore from the combat two days ago, he agrees to attend his soon-to-be wife outside into the cobblestone square. There are already many dancers here enjoying the upbeat music and atmosphere. Arrow unfortunately trips, whether it’s due to the cobblestone or his injuries, and falls flat on his face. Charlotte is amused, and he quickly storms over to a test-of-strength game to save face, and wins it by a huge margin.\n\nThe party is back in town, and ready to party. Perry and Freya hurry back to the royal summer home, dipping into the finest of gowns and make-up. Both meet their dates inside the estate, Freya has Leo the servant boy (very scandalous) and perry’s beauty had recently won over Freya’s older brother Prince Dmitri (currently 3rd in line for the throne). After dolling themselves up, they link arms for their double-date on the town. Cal had quickly made his way to the dance floor, and the devastatingly handsome mage had already got a following of six fair maidens wishing to spend some time with him. In order to bring the dance to the next level, he casts his mage light spell into the air, creating a magnificent aurora spectacle that gets the crowd’s approval.\n\nHaving stepped away with Charlotte, Arrow finds himself in the tavern and buys them each a drink. After drying their cups he heads outside to peruse all the merchants that had come out to sell their wares at a ‘discounted’ price for the festivities. Despite Charlotte’s protests, he slapped his silver onto the table and purchased himself a trained falcon, and the best room at the tavern. Meanwhile, Freya and Perry had gotten their dates on the dance floor. Freya soon found herself floundering, perhaps due to the cobblestone or the length of her dress, and (with a crit fail) flung herself into the punch. The festivities had stopped to see what the princess had gotten up to. Leo quickly picked her up, leading her to the side and grabbing something to help dry her off.\nMeanwhile, Cal takes the party over to the tavern, filling the dining area of Perry’s parent’s establishment. Everyone is chanting for him, the ‘Magic Man’ from out of town, and the free drinks start to flow. To keep his fanclub around, Cal casts an illusion on the room, making a large phoenix bristling with flames appear in the air, pinwheeling around the ceiling. Everyone claps and buy him more drinks. Perry and Prince Dmitri, having left the dance after Freya’s stumble, enter the tavern and bum some drinks off of Cal. Cal, slowly slipping into total inebriation but also relishing the attention, goes to follow up with his ‘best trick yet’. Standing in the air, he waves his hands and reads the ancient chants taught to him by the darkstone, and the whole tavern is set into magical darkness. Panic sets in, tables and chairs being pushes aside as everyone tries to flee outside. At least one person goes through a window. Cal and Perry take some damage during the almost riotous scuffle. After a full minute the spell fades away, and the remnants remain, cursing ‘Magic Man’ and his evil ways. Three of the girls that had been swooning and doting on Cal have left, and he quickly offers to buy everyone a round to help ease the situation. This gets everyone’s approval, but poor Cal finds his limit, throwing up on the floor. The last girl to stay, a girl with wheat-blonde hair named Sun, stays to help Cal, getting him a chair and some water.\n\nArrow brings Charlotte and his new falcon, which he named Takachsin (“Leader” in the ancient Nayam language he is familiar with) into the tavern. He tries to move in for the kiss, but the falcon starts to freak out, slapping them all with their drinks. She demands that he gets rid of it, but having spent good silver on it, tells her it has to stay. He instead buys many a drink before Perry’s adopted father Winthrop cuts him off. Perry and Dmitri exit the tavern, and find themselves under attack by Freya, who claims that Perry tripped her. Freya was waiting with a bucket of water, which she doused onto her fae friend, and pushed Perry into the fountain so they could ‘all be wet’. Cal has also wandered outside with Sun, bending over and drinking from the fountain to quench his thirst, until Sun points out the full glass of water in his hand. He dejectedly sits down.\n\nPerry pulls herself from the fountain and marches over to Leo, giving him a large kiss. Everyone is stunned and surprised, and Perry pulls him away and down the street. Freya is utterly furious (both she and her player I should mention) and stalks the two from the shadows. Meanwhile, Arrow had taken Charlotte up to the rented room in the tavern, hoping that perhaps he might get a bit lucky tonight. But she rebuked him, telling him to just hold off until their wedding night three weeks from now. Arrow was forced to settle on the chair in the side of the room, but headed down and drank himself into a blackout. Cal had wandered away with Sun, heading towards the stables.\n\nFreya stays within earshot, hoping to catch the cheating Leo and her ex-best friend off guard. She’s not sure what she wanted to do, but knew things could get violent. All this anger started to flare up inside of her, a strange effect that actually scared her. She developed tunnel vision, and her blood felt like fire shooting through her veins. But it passed quickly, and just in time for her to witness Perry pulling a dagger from beneath her dress and slashing Leo across the chest!\n\nBut where there should’ve been blood and gore, instead a strange crackling energy erupted from his chest, and a beam of red light shot from his mouth into the sky. Perry could’ve swore that she witnessed some strange being of pure chaotic energy sneering menacingly in the red void. Freya ran over to the two of them, slugging Perry across the face and kneeling to help Leo. Letting the attack slide, Perry explained that she felt a strange disturbance in Leo tonight, and wanted to figure out what it was. Freya was still angry, and refused to speak to her, rushing back to the summer home so that the royal physician could look over Leo. Perry shrugged and started back down the street. Cal and Sun were enjoying the quiet moon-lit stables together, making small talk. Cal told her that this was her first solstice festival, and he’d sure stick around for more if Sun was at them. She giggled and gave him a kiss on the cheek, telling him she had a good night. Arrow was passed out at the bar.\n\nThe physician checked Leo, and told the princess that it appeared he was malnourished and dehydrated, as if he had fallen into a coma. Leo came too a bit better, explaining to Freya that he had heard her voice in the woods while taking the kitchen slops out to the pigs, and rushed to help. Darkness had then fallen upon him and everything went blank until waking up on the street. But he had felt something evil, something that wanted to harm Lundenfeld.\n\nCal, leaning up close with Sun, looked up into the sky.  \nPerry, whistling and strolling down the road, looked up into the sky.  \nArrow, hearing the commotion of the other barflies, looked up into the sky.  \nFreya, feeding Leo some food, did not look up into the sky.  \n\nA fireball was descending upon the village.",

        "text": "So I'm a new GM with a new group. Always fun, right? This weekend was our second session, and it involved some imprisonment, followed by gladiatorial combat, followed by a good cop/bad cop routine, except I \"forgot\" to make a good cop.\n\nSo Regalia Megara, Inquisitor of the Throne, arrives and brings the party in to an interrogation room, stripped of all weapons and armor (and bears). The party (that could make the session) included a Gnome Rogue, HOrc Barbarian, Undine Crossbowslinger, and Oread Druid. \n\nMegara reveals that, despite their fantastic performance in the arena, they'll be put to death in a week for harboring a (Half) Orc, cult activities, and generally exhibiting murderhobo behavior throughout the first session despite nominally working with the government.\n\n\"THOSE ARE SOME TRUMPED UP BULLSHIT CHARGES!\" yells the HOrc, rolling intimidate. He rolls the first 3 of many, and Megara reacts by shooting him with a hand crossbow. \"THAT ALL YOU GOT, YOU DUMB BITCH?\" He rolls another 2 on intimidate, and then fails a will save to sleep from the enchanted arrow.\n\n\"Okay wait\" says the only person really familiar with tabletop. \"We're not cultists!\" Megara reveals the Barbarian's bag of hearts. \"But I work for [important backstory NPC]!\" Considering the state of things, I have him roll diplomacy. 4, before the negative modifier. Feeling a little bad for him (he IS telling the truth), I have Megara give him a chance to prove it by showing off his sniping skills.\n\n\"Okay\" I say, \"you need to roll a 15 after modifiers to hit the target 150 feet away.\" He rolls a 2, giving him a total of 9.\n\n\"WAIT\" he continues as the rogue and Druid chip in. \"This isn't MY crossbow! I need it!\" He rolls an 18 to convince her, and so I bring in his masterwork crossbow. He rolls a 5, giving him 14 after mods this time, barely missing.\n\n\"Of course you couldn't be the legendary sniper,\" taunts Megara, revealing her own crazy awesome crossbow and firing it at the target to show off.\n\n14 after mods.\n\n\"There's a GHOST here!\" says the Druid. \"Yeah,\" the Undine agrees, rolling a knowledge check to see if he had encountered anything like this before. I tell him he remembers fighting an invisible legion, as well as a poltergeist, and it could be either. He explains this.\n\nMegara goes around the range for a bit, casting spells to do something. Then she comes back and shoots again.\n\nNat 20, perfect bullseye (I didn't bother rolling for a crit, I decided it wouldn't affect the shot). I mentally do some calculations on her stats versus the Undine's and have her hand him her personal crossbow. On pure stats, he has her Dex beat by +1, plus a +1 circumstance bonus I was giving him for taking careful aim and planning his shot without hurrying. He has to roll at least a 15 after mods to hit the target, but to really convince her, he has to roll a nat 18 or higher to Robin Hood her arrow.\n\nI didn't let anyone know that.\n\nThe Undine's player begins tossing his dice, ready to roll, before stopping and grabbing a different set. He rolls.\n\nIt's an 18. The table explodes as the bolt splits the previous shot in half. If he'd used any Grit that day, I'd have given him some back for that.\n\nMegara is shocked as she takes her crossbow back and mumbles something about how he might just be-\n\n\"Wait,\" I say, stopping everyone for a second. \"What do you want your legendary sniper title to be?\"\n\nThe player grins and leans back in his chair as he thinks. \"I want to be... The Axiom. I prove myself true.\"\n\nAnd that's how our second (kind of) session ended.",

        "text": "(I decided to write out our group's adventure as it's a lot of fun so far. Here’s just the first little blurb. I hope you enjoy.)\n\nOur story technically starts at 10:00 AM on a rainy Sunday morning, the weather being wonderfully coincidental for reasons I’ll go into in a bit. We all arrive, backpacks and small bags in tow, prepared for this new adventure that lies ahead. I enter the house later than the rest, unfortunate considering this whole thing was in fact my idea. Walking through the front door, I notice our three newest members filling out the necessary paperwork with our guide’s assistance. I take a seat at the table, removing the contents from my bag and preparing myself for what awaits us all. The game is Dungeons and Dragons, and our exciting story has just begun.\n\nThunder roars through the sky as the rain pours upon a small simple town. Freeport is, as one would assume, a port town, existing mostly to take in shipments from other kingdoms and countries for transport elsewhere. Gallons of water rattle upon the roofs of the two dozens homes, the blacksmith, general store, as well as the Inn where our heroes reside. Inside the inn, at a large rectangular table set in the center of the empty ground floor, sit eight individuals coming to consciousness and one beautiful elven woman who waits with an excited curiosity. She stands to her feet, and with the faintest of grins lets out an echoing “Awaken fools!”\n\nThe table springs to attention. The dwarven man slams his heavy spiked gauntlets onto the table. The small halfling female and a half-elf woman, both clad in leather armor, reach for the daggers at their side. The other half-elf woman grabs hold her staff, at which point, the fully armored half-elf man at her side turns to her attention, asking if she is alright, to which she appeases him with a smiling nod. As everyone takes stock of where they are and who they are surrounded by, the beautiful woman gives two claps, demanding everyone’s attention.\n\nThe elven woman stands at almost six feet tall and is clad in a sexy and revealing plated armor with a long black cloak thrown back behind her shoulders. Our DM Stephanie informs us all that she is a follower of Eilistraee, the goddess of beauty and strength and femininity, being granted immortality and perfection in exchange for devotion. With all eyes on her, she begins, “You may address me as Serenity and it would seem that I have the pleasure of being the barer of bad news.” Everyone’s faces turn, she definitely has their attention now. Outside the storm is raging, only adding to the tension inside this building. “Outside this town awaits an army of four-hundred orcs. They intend to burn this city to the ground in the name of chaos. It would seem, however, that someone else has different plans, thus, here you sit my friends.” A few faces grumble in anticipation of what words follow.\n\nA human male with long pale blonde hair speaks up, “Go on.”\n\nSerenity continues, “You have been drafted into the Queen’s militia. How lucky you are? Your mission is to defend this town. You maybe choose to leave, however, with tonight’s torrential down pore, I don’t suppose you’ll get far. Not to mention, those orcs seem driven only by their bloodlust. If I had to guess, they mean to burn this town to the ground, so hiding would do you stealthy types no good at all.”\n\nThe heavily armored half-elf man, seeming to notice Serenity’s holy devotion, bows his head slightly, “What would you ask that we do then m'lady?”\n\n“I would ask that you stand brave,” she obliges him, “Prove your worth. Stand and defend this town. I trust you, it will not go unnoticed.” She gestures towards the overwhelming feast laid out on the table before them. “Eat up, drink, be merry. They shall arrive in the morning. Should any of your fall, know that your place in the heavens awaits you with open arms as a champion.” and with that, she covers herself in her cloak and vanishes.\n\nThe eight fall silent, wishing not to socialize, nor really become acquainted with those that may soon perish beside them. A human at the far end of the table with unruly hair and a bushy beard gives a slight chuckle, “Well, wait until I tell the wife and kids. Who’s hungry?” He steals a small lump of meat from the table and brings it to his waist, on his belt a small pouch containing a hyena cub. He feeds it. The dwarf female gives a hesitant giggle and quickly chugs the largest mug of ale she can find. After an hour of silently filling their bellies with what could very much be their last meal; a dwarven man, a halfling woman, two half-elf women, a half-elf man, and two human men, head up the stairs to their rooms in an attempt to sleep. The dwarven woman, it would seem, has passed out drunk atop the table.\n\nThe sun peaks over the trees as morning arrives, last night’s storm seemingly gone. The eight all awaken and prepare for the oncoming battle; dawning their armor, sharpening their blades, and readying their spells. They exit the inn and begin scouting around the city, surveying the area and getting an idea of useful defenses, before reconvening at an empty blacksmith. The bearded human clears his throat. He’s dressed in a very flashy purple high collared jacket. Several pouches adorn his belt, including the one containing a small hyena pup. “Uhm, I feel like if we’re all about to buy the farm then you should all at least be aware of who stood beside you. My name is Mr. Pockets, I’m a bard, and I will do my best to help you all with my ocarina and song.”\n\nThe others hesitate. The sturdy dwarven male with a huge blonde goatee and bald head stands forward. He slams his two spiked gauntlets together and adjusts his long and open robe. “You’ve probably been wondering, and I’m hear to say it’s true. Yes, I’m the famous boxer Gorimm so worry not. This will all be over really soon.”\n\nA thin half-elf woman tosses a few stolen bolts into her hip holster and loads one into her crossbow, “The name’s Lycia, I’m a ranger if you must know.” She is dressed in thick leather armor, with a short jacket and knee high boots. Her ensemble is polished suggesting that she holds herself in very high regards. Her blueish black hair is pulled into a waist length french braid. She seems to be rather excited for the battle ahead as she walks for the front door.\n\nAs Lycia leaves she passes a dwarven woman with wild red hair walking in. She is adorned in heavy battle armor with, yes, a dress thrown awkwardly over top and carries a large battle axe over her shoulder with a proud grin on her face. “The general store had the prettiest of dresses,” she says expecting the others to share in her excitement. Instead they only look on with confusion. “You can call me Shanya. I consider myself quite the fighter.”\n\nThe other half-elf woman whispers quietly with the half-elf man who has not left her side since morning. He nods and bows, “Greetings I am the cleric gaurd Tor Vorell, and this is Lady Emerythia, a druid princess.” Emerythia is draped in a long beautiful light blue dress with a tall collar and holding what appears to be a crooked stick as tall as herself. Her long white hair flows loosely behind her. Tor is a stern looking man with a shaved head. He is dressed in shiny silver heavy plated armor, a white cape on his back, and two long kriss swords sheathed at his side.\n\nThe human with shoulder length blonde hair inspects a bow he lifted from a hook on the wall only to put it back, clearly favoring the bastard sword slung on his back. He is dressed in a long coat, shirt, trousers, and riding boots, all of which look dirty and worn from travel. “Antioth. Ranger.”\n\nOutside in the empty town square, the halfling, a thief named Persephone, takes notice of something glimmering in a pile of debris. She’s dressed in simple black leather armor and fingerless gloves, her short curly hair is pulled into pigtails. She carries a dagger on her hip and a rapier on her back. Persephone’s bare feet step towards the rubbish, her eyes wide with curiosity over what could be hiding within. Standing inches away, she sees it, a beautiful blade begging to be picked up.\n\nThree orcs march through the city, past the blacksmith. Everyone inside takes notice of them and runs outside to greet them except for Lady Emerythia and Tor Vorell who wait inside. Antioth and Gorimm run ahead excited for battle. “You filthy cur!” Antioth yells forth before drawing his blade.\n\n“Get your asses back here!” Gorimm taunts.\n\nScreeching from between their heads flies a bolt that strikes one of the orcs between the eyes. Dropping him instantly. The other two panic and run off. Antioth and Gorimm turn to see Lycia, cross bow drawn and grinning wickedly. “Go get em boys.” she commands. Gorimm, Lycia, Shanya and Mr Pockets run off chasing after the orcs only to find an army of two-hundred more coming over the hill, cannon in tow. Antioth however notices little Persephone running off in the opposite direction and proceeds to follow her. As they come around to the center of town they come to a halt as they notice the other half of the orc army being lead by their eight foot tall captain. The captain locks eyes with Antioth, snarls, and raises his sword to the sky, commanding his army to attack.",

        "text": "There were four of them, 3 men and a woman, standing before the double doors of a high school cafeteria; each is out of place with their worn blood stained clothes and guns. The men give a quick prayer and a subtle light envelopes them, so imperceptible it could just be a trick of the afternoon sun coming in through the school's windows. They brim with energy and stand straighter, even if they don't notice, a sense of righteousness permeating their frames. The woman, however, is silent - though none of the others notice - subconsciously stepping back as she checks her two pistols. Her hands rest easy - but firm - in the grips. Showtime.\n\nThey stepped into the cafeteria, wary as they spotted their target: a small boy, only maybe 12 or 14, with pale skin and a mop of dark brown hair. Normal, save the eyes of course. The eyes were always a dead give away, smoldering and black as night even as they came to rest on the new prey that had just walked into its domain. The boy opens his mouth to speak but the hunters act first. They storm in, guns spitting steel and holy fury, and desperate anger on their faces. But a predator does not fall to its prey. \n\nThe light-filled bullets slam against the boy's body, melting away like mercury as he laughs with hellish glee. With a sneer and a glare, a wave of heat and malice spills out from the hell-spawn - sending the hunters flying; bodies slamming into walls as if thrown with the force of a car crash. Bones crunch as they tear through soft skin. Groans and cries of pain fill the room, but the hunters slowly push themselves to their feet - the righteous resolve gone now from their bodies and spirits. The putrid smell of brimstone began filling the room as a ring of cold flame burst to life around the boy. Flashing a wicked grin, he gestures and the air trembles, folding in on itself to reveal a hole: cold and black like the void of space, sordid forms writhing within, longing to break into the mortal plane. \"You come to your death, mortals, and on your corpses shall my brothers and sisters dance in dark bliss before we take this world of yours under our heel,\" the boy spat, steaming bile oozing from between his teeth as his demonic host took full control. The hunters grew pale; there was nothing they could do to stop him as all their power hadn't so much as left a scratch.\n\nThe woman, Eris, steps forward, dropping her guns at her side as the tattoo on her left arm - a blood drenched sword - pulse deeply with an eager glow. Her spiked, short, ashen blonde hair swaying without wind and glistening faintly as if transforming into a smoky gray flames on her head. The taut, pale skin of her twenty-something body cracks and splits as blood red fissures spill open across her body, glowing like greedy embers. Bones snap back into place and sinew stitches itself together even as her limbs and torso contort and lengthen. The men stare, wide eyed, as she steps unharmed through the circle of flames and three barbed tails slice cleanly through the tailbone of her pants. The boy steps forward, fury plain on his face and growls angrily at Eris' now black eyes, burning in defiance. \"You dare-\" he starts - barking out the words in the demon tongue - before Eris' boot connects with his chest and neck, sending him howling into the portal which wraps itself around his soft flesh and squeezes, biting into his skin and sawing through bone before devouring him bloody but whole. \n\nPanting, Eris begins to change back, knuckles white with vindication, \"See you in Hell, bitch.\"",

        "text": "No.\n\nMy ambition is far from possessing 'Rogue Trader' as my title.  I do not want it.  A man like myself could never thrive.  No merchant would take someone of new blood seriously, even with my noble lineage.  I know all about the rights of birth.  No matter how foolish, people will always chose their tradition over pure logic.  Compared to other Seneschals, there are none quite like myself.  This is the role where I excel; ruling from the shadows.  A captain must lead in the open to inspire trust and loyalty.  How long could I possibly last?\n\nI say none of this, of course.\n\n\"Thank you sir.  It is truly a huge honour.\"\n\nI'm reminded of the simple ways Klaus' mind works.  Although a noble, Rogue Traders are untouchable.  He was born to be a leader.  Meanwhile I am the third son of a wealthy family who own two successful empires.  One goes to my oldest brother, the other to the second, and I - being last - get to serve them.  I was born to follow.  That is what separates the pair of us.\n\n\"I can't see you dying anytime soon sir.  As I said, I wouldn't allow it.\"\n\nKlaus gives a nod.  \"Let's hope.\"  Indeed.\n\nThen again, who else is there to take his place?  None of the other officers could handle the position, with the possible exception of Court.  I dread to think what would happen if that zealot came into possession of a warrant of trade.  I suppose, looking at it that way, there is no other choice until a rightful heir is produced.\n\nA thought to definitely keep in mind.\n\nFor now, there are more present matters.  Considering the health of my colleges, Klaus and Zez more notably, I decide to call back to the ship and summon first aid.  We can afford to wait.  After a brief discussion to arrange a suitable meeting spot, we sit tight and prepare for the medical team.  Time goes on; I begin to worry.  The Barron sounded distracted when I contacted him, which could only mean bad news.  Perhaps time is more precious than I first thought?\n\nFinally there is a knock on the airlock hatch.  We safely allow the crew to enter as we see Clemens, the head physician, surrounded by ten of my Lord's Oathsworn guard, various void farers, and other doctors.  I keep close to Klaus, waiting until Clemens has a moment to speak.\n\n\"Ah, Bones!\"  my Lord greets Clemens.  Klaus has a hard time remembering our doctor's name, so has adopted this nickname.  Clemens acknowledges the greeting, a sour expression telling of how he appreciates it.\n\n\"My Lord.  You seem to have gotten yourself injured like usual.\"  The Oathsworn cover the perimeter while the medical staff see to Zez.  Odette watches as Clemens works his magic with Klaus, as Court continues to look over the fallen men.\n\nFinishing up with the task at hand Clemens looks up, his expression deadly serious.  \"I need a word with you *Commander*.  All of you *Commanders*.\"\n\n'Commander'.  Oh no.\n\nThat word is not used on our ship, expect by a few privilege crew.  It so happens to be apart of a code that I set up with the senior staff and spies, so we could deliver messages without suspicion.  'Commander' is the opener, to let the recipients know that the next sentence will be structured with keywords.  This prevents perfectly harmless drivel from being interpreted as a secret message.\n\nWe all gather round near the blown apart Navigator's chair, away from the other staff.\n\nClemens continues.  \"It seems that Brother Quinlen has gathered a rabble of *drunkards* and is running around the underdeck collecting *hares*.\"  'Drunkard' is one of the words for Inquisition.  'Hares' - witches.\n\nThe Inquisition and the witch cult are rioting in the underdecks of our ship?  I can see that true for the witches, but the Inquisition have nothing to do with Brother Quinlen and his ilk.  He leads a group of pilgrims travelling with us, until they find whatever it is that holy men look for on such a journey.  My guess is that this word is being used in place of a suitable substitute for 'pilgrims', unless a lot more has happened while we have been here on the Righteous Path.  \n\nUnfortunately all the other seniors take a little longer to remember the code, Zez and Odette looking the most confused.  When it hits them, their faces fall.\n\n\"What is the Barron doing?\"  I ask before anyone else can drill Clemens for answers.\n\n\"The Oathsworn are being sent to the underdecks.  They're taking care of the situation.\" he answers promptly.  \"But our numbers are much smaller.\"\n\n\"Who is winning?\"  Court leans over, speaking up.\n\n\"Well, currently we are.\"  Court immediately looks disinterested in Clemens' answer.  From his face I can tell what he is thinking; there isn't much of an issue.  I feel inclined to disagree with that point of view.\n\nMy Lord, tidying himself up, joins the conversation.  \"When we go back, we'll remind them all of who's ship they're on.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" Clemens takes off his bag, rummaging through, \"in light of the dangers here, and considering you lack any competent field medics, I'm trusting you with this.\"  He pulls out a clear, clean bag with five injectors inside, each unmistakably labelled 'STIM'.  As well as our best doctor, Clemens also doubles as one of the Barron's spies, having access to a myriad of drugs.\n\n\"What about me?\"  Odette points to herself.  \"Have anything that would make me less sleepy?  That game of I spy took it out of me.\"\n\nClemens sighs and looks through his supply.  After a moment he produces another syringe with a very fine needle and administers care to Odette.\n\n\"That should wake you up for a while.\"\n\nHaving done their duty, the staff get ready to head back to the ship.  As they do, I turn to my Lord to seek his advice.\n\n\"Sir, do you think that one of us should return to the Barron's aid while you are away?\"\n\n\"Who did you have in mind?\" he asks, already knowing my answer.\n\n\"Me sir.\"  He laughs.  \"I think I would be more useful there than here sir.  Controlling situations behind the screen as it were is what I do best.\"\n\n\"You *are* my second.\"  Klaus agrees.  \"Take care of everything.\"\n\n\"Only if you promise not to die in my absence.\"  As long as Court remains, I imagine that won't be too hard to accomplish.\n\nHe gives me a smirk.  \"Bah!  I won't die, we have drugs now!\"  I do my best not to scowl, unsure whether or not I succeed.  He turns back to the crew as I inform Clemens of what we have decided.\n\nIt is for the best.  They certainly do not need me to find their way down here, and they will still be able to contact me via my micro bead if there are any real concerns.  Although, I think I'm the one who is in danger of being overwhelmed.\n\nEnough of this pessimistic train of thought!  I'll quell this uproar before the others return back with the treasures.  If I am the only senior on board, I can handle this is any way I see fit.  It is almost exciting.\n\nThe majority of the Oathsworn Clemens brought along stay with my Lord and the other seniors, replacing the men who met their end in the Navigator's tower.  I along with the void farers, medics and Clemens make my way home.  We keep a hurried pace, discussing in more detail the events that have transpired since our absence.\n\nIt turns out Court's 'reliable' team to gather up suspicious individuals have transformed the lower decks into a literal witch hunt, pursuing members of the Sons of Tarm.  Meanwhile, the witches we did put behind bars have been released, as both sides rally the dredge to rise up and fight each other.\n\nThis is exactly why you should never trust a pious man.\n\nWhen the shuttle reaches the ship, I will call upon the Barron for an update of the situation.  Until then, I have concerns for the others' safety.  Perhaps I am letting my weakness get the better of me, but I have no doubt that there are similar creatures of chaos lurking all over the Righteous Path, protecting the wealth of legend.  I know I have exercised my 'talents' enough today, but to put my mind at ease I will need to call upon them one more time.\n\nAs I sit on the shuttle, I close my eyes and think hard on my comrades.  Whatever fate has in store for myself I can handle without the warning of the warp.  I want to know the fate of my Lord; I want to know what they will find.  I pour all my concentration into this thought, as images play out once again inside my head.\n\n\n[Start](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3dfr45/tales_from_a_seneschal_rogue_trader/) | [Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3jw78s/rogue_trader_tales_from_a_seneschal_part_8/) | [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3objbr/rogue_trader_tales_from_a_seneschal_part_10/) | [Last](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3xlc9d/rogue_trader_tales_from_a_seneschal_part_16/)\n",

        "text": "*Hello again everyone! Pratena ( [The multi-classing teenaged cyclops with a compulsive punching habit who's also rockin' a new Orc style haircut](http://sta.sh/01mfi5qsklqj) ) is at it again! My DM [Mister Numbers/ 113420](http://www.reddit.com/user/113420) has set me on another solo mission! Mainly because we have a 3 year time skip now between any major plot points and Mister Numbers didn't want to say the crew kicked dirt around waiting for shit to happen; and in order for all solo split party missions we had to do a write up on the session so the others knew what happened while they were missing all the fun. So! Pratena got to deal with a band of Orcs this session, lets see what she has to say about that in her diary!* \n\nDear diary,\n\nThis is a bit of an odd but frustrating and fun adventure. Valera set me off on a mission with one of the other cyclops, Hurtle, to a band of orcs that have been causing a LOT more chaos than they should. Like, did no one pass them the memo that Orcs are supposed to chill the heck out and be a lot more like drunken brawlers and less raging vikings? So! I was sent to handle it! I guess it was a good idea since I was raised by Orcs. Who knows. \n\nI set off with Hurtle who kept running circles around me. literally. He was literally running around me. He can’t stop moving. The guy did something to himself that makes it physically impossible to stand still. \n\nOne thing people keep forgetting to tell me is just how I’m supposed to go about this. I’m only 13. I know my birthday is soon but come on! I am not that bright. I think it’s obvious from the way I write my own diary entries. \n\nAnyways.\n\nWe reached this camp with a tent and there were a bunch of orcs there trying to train. They acted a lot like the ones we gave a tank to a while back. I was about to say something when I noticed something odd. It was me, staring at me through a tent. I was about to guess it was more of those shadow things till one of the others walked up to me asking how I could be in two places at once. \n\nThis is where I spent 20 minutes explaining the one in the tent was not the real me. I also learn of the term honor stealing (to pretend to be someone and steal their honor and image to garner fake respect and admiration for yourself), and I was not happy to hear that’s what was going on. I managed to use him to get the attention of the orcs in the tent with the fake me. \n\nTurns out the head of the team was an old warlord! I say old because apparently he was dishonored. Using arrows and being ranged is not very Orcy. Though, I knew him from legend, so I decided to treat him like one. Skullventilator was his name, and he had a second in command named Stabbystab. He REALLY liked to stab things. Turns out they thought towns were getting weak and they wanted to make them stronger. For the glory of Junaug they were raiding towns to try and teach them to defend themselves (but instead they were leaving them in complete ruin with nowhere for the townsfolk to go), and what apparently was called a Doppelganger taking on my image was there to stand silently and raise morale for the troops. I understood the plan and what they were doing was cool, but they were going about it the wrong way. This took a long time to explain. I even had to try and think of simple metaphors. \n\nI ended up having to explain it like killing goats. If you destroy all but one goat you can’t make a better herd. you gotta leave enough to rebuild. These guys were doing the former. They understood it! much to my disbelief (I seriously didn’t even think it was going to work it was a last ditch effort before I started throwing punches). With the new grounds of understanding we managed to come to an agreement that what they were doing was in fact too much, but the times are far too ahead of the old warlord for him to really change his ways. So, a bit of a bittersweet solution was made. The Doppelganger was to take his place leading the band of Orcs in their raids, just to what we need them to tone it down to, and I fight Skullventilator and Stabby with the help of Hurtle (who had been making laps around the camp the whole time in case I needed back up). It’s a bit of an Orc thing. They don’t want to die of old age, they want to die in battle, which is much more honorable.\n\nWe moved away from the camp so no one would see. I decided to tone it down so they had a good final fight rather than something quick. Skullventilator was pretty decent in the fight and I think he was happy to actually go out in battle like 98% of all Orcs are. Stabby...He was a lot tougher, but it let me try out a new trick I learned! I literally turned into a hurricane! With that I just caught him and Hurtle decided to jump into too and help out, it was like a throwing something into a meat grinder, and Hurtle was the blades. Stabby didn’t last too much longer after Hurtle jumped in (by the way I managed to finally get a good look at this guy and let me tell you something, [NEVER SKIP TORSO DAY. YOU NEED LEG AND TORSO DAY TRUST ME](http://media.veryfunnypics.eu/2013/02/funny-picture-never-let-your-friends-skip-torso-day-540x730.jpg) ).\n\nWith all said and done we made our plan with Doppelganger and we went home after a day of drinking and having fun hanging out with them, I got the worst kind of hangover let me tell you (for an Orc, if you can pick up a cup, you are of drinking age). Then things really quieted down after I went home for a few months and so I decided to check in on them. The group was smaller and things seemed to be pretty good for them. So I think it was a job well done! Valera was pretty impressed I managed to get the results I got. I mean, I agree, I am not the diplomatic type. \n\nTill next time diary. Maybe I’ll have something a little more fighty.\n\nPratena  \n",

        "text": "Previous session here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3k0fkl/beyond_the_wall_session_5_of_bandits_and_giant/\n***\nHaving struck out and found the forest spirit Marc ANTony, among other events such as a bear fight and bandit ambush, the party slinks back to the village for some much-needed rest. The words of the forest spirit lie heavy in their hearts, and they wonder what it might all mean.\n\nThe Cast of Characters includes:  \nLindsey as *Perdenzia, the Fae Foundling*  \nDJ as *Arrow, the Would-be Knight*  \nCaitlin as *Freya Pendragon Kirkwall, the Forgotten Noble Child*  \nRiley as *Caligeth ‘Cal’ Darwinus, the Apprentice Court Sorcerer*  \n\nHaving stayed the night in the woods and talked with the forest spirit, the group walk back to the village, some more worse for wear than others. As they walk, Cal speaks up about a strange dream he had been having. As Freya witnessed one fateful night years ago, his master was devoured by a demonic entity in a ball of fire and brimstone. It had haunted him since, but he was beginning to dream that his master wasn’t dead, and was either hiding or enslaved by the demon.\n\nThe group wondered about this prospect as they came back to the village around midday. They tried to figure out what to do with the bear pelt they had secured the day before. Much of the discussion was relegated to fashion interests, as each of the group seemed to want some sort of bear-hide clothing.\n\nLundenfeld was abuzz with activity, as tonight was the first of the month as well as the summer solstice. Hanging lanterns were being hung, and barrels of ale were being rolled out for the celebrations to follow tonight. Bands were testing their instruments and children watched in wonder. But there was a gaggle of men, talking in hushed tones and faces etched with worry. Perry knew two of them, hunters that used to entertain her with tales as a child. She wandered over to see what was troubling them. They told her that a wagon of grain was inbound to the village, and never appeared. If the party had taken care of the Turner Road Gang two days ago, then what had attacked the wagon? They were forming a posse to head out around dusk to investigate. The party agreed to help.\n\nThe time came and torches were handed out. Six men and the three young adventurers (Arrow was at home sleeping off his injuries) readied themselves and headed down the road. After an hour they came across a strange patch of the road, where many trees were missing from the side of the road. Cal noticed this first, and found large sets of footprints leading deeper into the woods. The posse wanted to keep heading down the road to find the wagon, but Cal and the others decided to follow the tracks. The posse followed.\n\nAfter twenty minutes they discovered a small logging camp, with the stolen trees stacked up in apparent ease. The tracks kept moving on, but two kobold guards lay sleeping. The posse left two men behind to watch them, just in case they tried anything funny. The tracks finally led to a cave entrance, where haggard snoring was heard within. Unfortunately the party was spotted by two kobolds sitting atop the cave, shouting out an alarm. Freya tried to throw her axe to silence the watchmen, but missed by a large margin. An arrow from Perry also falls short as Cal turns and heads back down the path towards the kobolds and guards. The ground shakes and the air seems to fall still as a horrible abomination pulls itself from the cave. Covered in taut leathery skin and milky white eyes, the creature pulled back its head and roared towards the moon, a long barbed tail flicking about the ground. Perry and the men from the posse fled before it, falling back down the path. Freya stands her ground, but decides to ‘tactically withdraw’ after noticing she was all alone.\n\nCal had been walking back at first, but turned around to find everyone barreling down towards him, the lumbermonster in tow with kobolds on each shoulder cheering him on. Thinking quickly, Freya pulled ahead and stole some rope of Perry, tying it around a tree trunk and holding it in place. Not seeing it in the faded sunlight, the large thing’s foot caught the rope and sent it tumbling down onto its face, both kobolds flying of of it. Making the most of the time they had, Freya buried her shortsword into its eyes, blinding it. Perry keeps falling back, unleashing an arrow into its hide. Cal turns towards one of the kobolds, striking it down with his sword., and earning his first kill. In a rage, the other kobold threw itself at him, clawing for his throat, but Freya cut it down with her blade.\n\nThe monstrosity pulled itself up, blood streaming down its face as it roared in pain. But without eyes or a kobold guide, it was effectively useless, running into trees and thundering around. The group kept a careful distance, rushing in to strike its legs, or to place an arrow into its back. They keep moving down the trail, the posse men long gone, and wait for it by the tree pile. Once it gets close, Cal orders the others to help him push the top tree, sending it rattling down into the blinded beast’s path. Without sight it finds itself tripping again, and the group surround it. They hear shouts coming from the woods though, an orc and two goblins rushing to see what the commotion is about. Freya sees the approaching threat and decides to ‘tactically withdraw’ again.\n\nPerry tries to strike the orc but hits a tree, Cal readies his blade to face them, the adrenaline of the combat giving him false hope. The two goblins run to the monster’s side, taking it by the hand and trying to lead it away. The orc points towards Cal and threatens to “Tear you apart boy!” and rushes for the attack. Unfortunately, the orc rolled a nat 1, and the monster thunders out of the goblin’s control, trampling the orc like a freight train as he tries to attack the young mage. Appearing from the bushes and rolling a nat 20, Freya twirls around, the hem of her dress floating off the ground as her blade flashes through the air, felling both goblins. Cal rushes to the orc and repeats the threat back to him, finishing him off.\n\nIn a blind fury, the tail of the monster catches Freya across the chest, drawing blood from its wicked barbs. But it is outnumbered and at an extreme disadvantage, and the group slowly whittles it away from a safe distance with arrows as Freya climbs its back, stabbing deep into its neck. It starts to stumble and fall, and Perry rolls the last nat 20 of the evening as her arrow buries itself up through its jaw, cutting off all life as it falls limply to the ground. The party rush back to the cave to retrieve Freya’s thrown axe, and they poke around the lair, finding an overflowing sack full of more silver than they can imagine. They meet the posse back on the road, and head back to Lundenfeld for the Solstice Festival as the sun finally slips over the horizon...",

        "text": "So my character finally achieved his goal, but first I must tell you his backstory. It's the story of Jacob Schmidt the 5th. He was a lawyer Brujah (muscle, brute force vampire) that was supposed to keep the Masquerade safe for everyone in town by saying it was \"swamp gas\" or whatever. His twin brother John Schmidt the 5th was his ghoul (think of a step between vampire and human) and was running the business during the day. They came from a whole line of vampire lawyers where only the strong become the vampire, and the loser becomes their bitch (aka ghouled) and also the firstborn is named Jacob and the secondborn is John. Only their father, John Schmidt the fourth managed to overcome his brother (mainly because Jacob 4 hated his family and did not want to continue the family tradition) and become the head of the family. However, as I played the character, I kept fucking up over and over. So I decided to change some of the backstory. \n\nInstead of playing as Jacob, I was John Schmidt 5. His older twin brother loved his little fuck-up brother and would do anything for him. He would always clean-up after his messes, and generally take care of him. However, he knew that the fuck-up would be pressured to do most of the work during the day and that would hurt the family business. Probably enough for the rest of the family to \"get rid of him\". So he wanted him to become the vampire. But the other heads of the family wanted the true heir, Jacob, to become head like most of them (Jacob 1 &amp; 2, Jacob 3 died under \"mysterious circumstances\"). So he switched identities with his brother and would always keep and eye out on him, seeing if there is anything he could do to help out his brother.\n\nOne day during my adventures, 4 Hunters (regular people who get powers to destroy the unnatural) came into town and attacked us. They took my son Jacob Schmidt the 6th (happened before I turned and also a vampire) and forced me to tell them where Elysium (place where vampires talk and is the only forced peaceful area in towns) was so they can send their suicidal member there. My hand was forced because I was raised to always think of family first so I told them, and thought the prince (head of vampire politics) of the town would put a headhunt on me so I asked my brother to stand in for me for a bit while I hid for a while.\n\nFor a session or 2 I played as my brother \"John\" Schmidt the 5th playing as Jacob Schmidt who is really Jacob. Eventually we fought a cyber vampire and as a result, he died. My character found out and was pissed. And he formed a plan, a plan that would be the bane of most of his future fuck-ups: Bring back his dead brother.\n\nSo I did some research and I found out that most of the stuff to bring him back needed a fresh body so I asked someone for a ritual to keep him in the same state. All it needed was some fresh blood, so everyday I would spend 2 blood instead of 1. Annoying but needed. Eventually we talked to a fey librarian and I asked her if she knew anything about bringing back the dead. She said there were 2 books that could help, Mummies and Demons. I went the obvious route and chose Demons.\n\nI read the book front to cover, back and forth. I found out I needed 4 things, a truly holy symbol (very bad for vampires to be near), a blood circle, some herbs or whatever, and finally the still-beating heart of a youngling child related to me. I'm like, \"Hey, my son should have Jacob and John Schmidt the 7th (we turn when there are 2 heirs available)\". So during a snowstorm in July done by a Fey Queen, I accidentally chopped off a person's hand to gather blood (everyone in town had gained Fortitude 5 which helps soak damage and I went too far to cut him) and summoned my grandson for the ritual. My son came along and said \"Listen, if you do this there will be one less Jacob Schmidt in the world\". Due to my upbringing, I had to agree and let them go.\n\nEventually after like 5 princes coming and going, the newest in power was a man named Nocturo. He managed to outwit me and find out about my eventual plans to bring a demon into town and was pissed. We fought, I lost, all of my stuff was taken (everything but apparently my holy item, a cross) and I was told to bury my brother in front of everyone. However, this is when the prince comes to me and says \"Hey, this one vampire Alan is getting on my nerves and is sorta planning against me. If you help me kill him, we are just going to say we're burying him and you can keep the body\". I was raised to think of the family so I said \"Sure\". The attack plan didn't work, I was bloodbound (if you are bloodbound to someone, the higher it is the more you are devoted to them. I've been bloodbound over a dozen times, 6 I think to Alan himself) to both people so all I did was just hold a car up while it tried to drive away and both people told me to drop it so I did. A fuck up, but I got my brother back. However, my grandsons were out but there was a black sheep in our family: Jacob Schmidt the 4th, my uncle. So I looked up if he had any surviving children I can use for the ritual, and lucky me he did. And he lived in Florida. And I'm living in Maine. Fuck.\n\nQue tonight.\n\nSo the monster of the week attacking our town was Mummies. They really can't be killed, just basically stalled for each \"kill\". But a vampire in Florida knows of a ritual that can keep them dead. I'm like, \"Score\" so now I'm planning on how to bring a child along with 2 ghouls and 4 vampires in a car. So I get some xanax and some duct tape and mostly everyone leaves the car alone except the other ghoul that isn't mine that's just sleeping in it cause the ghouls are driving the car in the day and also I'm still kinda stuck with the other vampires. So I text my ghoul to call me to pick him up with the truck because I'm both bad at lying and one of the other vampires auto-detects lies so I have to be telling the truth about what's going on, but yet as vague as possible. I leave the group, give the other ghoul a hotel room, and knock-out and steal a 10 year old kid and stuff him in a cupboard that everyone sorta ignored in the car we took (it was a recent stolen science-lab car, so big cupboards weren't a problem) and got him ready for the 24 hour drive back to our town in Maine.\n\nAs soon as we are back in town, I drop everyone off, set up and commit the ritual. Child dead, the demon asks what my wish was and I said \"I want my brother Jacob Schmidt the 5th alive\". So my wish was granted...by the demon possessing him. Fuck. And he's my twin brother who I also loved. Double fuck. So my goal was achieved so I'm just stunned while he just walks out and I go to meet with my friends, hoping to keep this a secret. \"Brother\" calls Alan pretending to be me and says \"Hey, I just summoned a demon into my brother and he's headed towards you to kill you. Bye\". So I arrive at my friends swords drawn at me wondering \"How did they know?\". They knew it was me since I'm a vampire, not a demon-possessed dead body but they knew of what I did. So they made me tell the new prince of the town and boy was he pissed. I had to call in my only favor from him to not die in sight (and I literally mean sight. He has eye-lasers). So I'm to have a court set on what's to happen to me in a week's time in game. But before that I am to destroy the demon in my brother.\n\nThis is when I open up my whole character's backstory to everyone in character and I guess this is when the GM's wheels are turning. I summon my brother and he's trying to call everyone saying \"Hey, I know what you're planning and I really want to live but just let me talk before I arrive so I can explain myself\" and they were all like \"Nope, you're a demon. Fuck you.\". Finally he arrives, the true Jacob Schmidt the 5th. I tell him that he took the only thing that made myself happy and he's just like \"I know, and I'm sorry for that. I know what I did was wrong and somehow I feel bad for that. A demon, a literal Slayer, is saying this\". I'm like \"What's a Slayer?\" and I'm told it's someone that has to take human souls and kill them, a sorta grim reaper if you will. So I'm just like \"Fuck\" and that's when I punch my brother in the face out of pure hatred for what this demon has done to me. For what's he done to destroy my plans to just be happy with my brother.\n\nHe explodes into a angelic form and everyone's just confused as to what exactly just happened. I ask him \"Wait, didn't I summon a demon.\" and he responds \"Yes. Yes you did, and that's what I was before I possessed this man. But when I did, something happened. I felt pure emotion when I entered. It was pure love for you John. Even after death this is all that Jacob wanted, to make sure that everything would turn out okay for you.\"\n\nI sat there stunned, wondering what left to do. It wasn't my brother, but yet I could see some of what's left in him. And I brought all of my friends ready to kill this man and I ask everyone \"Do we have to kill him?\" with almost literal tears in my own eyes. Everyone agreed to let him go since even though he is a Slayer, he would only go after the sickly to let them go peacefully into that good night. And that's how we ended the night.\n\nSo now I've got to prepare the trial of my life and also help out with a little problem of a shitload of Mummies still attacking the town. Best game session of my life.",

The Seers throw down with a hail of fire and bullets, riddling into a ban the red haired mage throws up, there before anyone has time to blink.\n\nThe tall man steps forward from the group, summoning a glowing shield and sword into his hands. Phantasms. He charges forward into the Seer cabal, sword swinging as he hews his way through their ranks, his aura seemingly seeping the potency of the Seer’s shields by its proximity. He draws the attention of everyone in the fight, a whirling beacon of blood and death - perfect for the mousy woman who slips behind the Seers, face blurring in a myriad of possibilities each as forgettable as the last. Flanking them, she weaves complex eldritch signs before snapping her fingers - the ground ripples beneath the Seer’s feet as jaws of earth roar and writhe, threatening to eat them alive while leaving the reaper untouched. Not to be outdone, the redhead flicks her wrist, sending the bullets flying back towards the throng of now bloodied and beaten Seers, finishing them with their own weapons.\n\nThe mousy mage turns at this point, already thinking of the work to be done on the Seer database and running a dozen hacking algorithms through her head at a time. As she sets to her work, however, she curses under her breath; the Seers had managed to magically shatter their hard drives. She could do something with fragments of code and nigh unbeatable firewalls, but not with the hard drives in their current state.\n\nAll eyes turn to the door as a somewhat gaunt looking man stumbles in, adjusting his glasses and nodding grimly as he makes his way to the computers. Surveying the damage, he reaches into his oversized coat and brandishes a clear crystal. He begins working the crystal over the computer and hard drives, humming to himself as he works his magic, expounding - to no one in particular - about the benefits of such natural healing magics. The fragmented hard drives stitch themselves back together. The party collectively sighs, unable to accept that such a ludicrous philosophy could possibly allow him to work magic, but unable to deny that he was the best they had and he always got the job done. But God help him if he dared to mention memory water one more time…",

        "text": "* [&lt;&lt; previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3gfieg/vtmlong_the_new_adventures_of_jalees_kamal_part_4/)\n\nThird game with my group was interesting. Apparently, some green fire had been seen around town. Specifically, some jets of green fire had been sighted by the PCs during feeding, usually small wisps coming out of sewer grates or manholes.\n\nEveryone in the Sabbat knows what green fire means. Dark Thaumaturgy. Heretics. Some idiot signed on with the down-below in exchange for powerful and corrupting magic. So far, the local Inquisition hasn’t even heard hints of anything, which has not endeared them to the Archbishop. This is one of the original reasons that he had called the Stacked Deck Column in to help his archdiocese. \n\nJalees thoroughly enjoys being of service in these cases, and knows that he must be careful in dealing with Super.InquisitorTzimisce. Not wanting to put the pissing contest in front of the mission, Jalees has already sent out scouts and gathered some information. He and Sweeps Squad have just arrived to Esbat and were waiting for a chance to talk to the Archbishop when a crazed Toreador burst into the meeting.\n\nA crazed, non-Sabbat Toreador.\n\nA crazed, non-Sabbat, suicide bomber Toreador.\n\nAfter Licks had picked themselves up off of the floor again, Sweeps Squad went around checking in with everyone and lending aid where needed. Jalees had managed to take the brunt of the blast and contain it in a relatively small area directly in front of him, but the initial wave had knocked most everyone off of their feet.\n\nJalees, badly burned and missing an arm, sat calmly and quietly. He instructed Sweeps Squad in a calm, clear tone, and waited until they had checked on everyone else before allowing them to fuss over him. At that point, he wasn’t focused on them anyways, but instead replaying the event, looking for details before the memory faded. He was able to pinpoint a few inconsistencies in the Toreador’s dress sense, but without more careful review he wasn’t going to find anything specific.\n\nJalees stood himself up and gave some quiet instruction to Sweeps Squad to hang around and be discreet about things, but that Sweeps.Andrew, .Connor and .Dah-veed should tail the PCs when they leave, and Sweeps.Brittany and .Erasmus should look for clues and follow up on them. Jalees took a small walk outside to find a patch of soil large enough to take a nap on, and used the very nice Koldun Way of Earth power Root of Vitality to heal up in under a minute.\n\nMeanwhile, the PCs had a fierce conference about what to do. They had recognized the Toreador where no one else had, and were pondering when said Lick had been turned. He had been the ghoul of a member of the Sabbat who had been quietly removed from the local scene, and was supposed to be on his way in an urn. Clearly this was not the case.\n\nSweeps.Brittany and .Erasmus were not having much luck finding anything definitive, though they both had plenty of things to send to their police contacts for analysis that day. Although they had gone over the explosion area with highly magnified senses, and found everything they were going to find, no leads were yet apparent. They left to take their findings down to the local lab.\n\nThe rest of Sweeps Squad was busy watching and listening to the PCs’ conversation without making it obvious that they were doing so. They discussed the various disparate pieces of information that they had about the guy, and came to the conclusion that he was the one who could have turned the ghoul and strapped him up to send into Esbat. They felt that they didn’t have enough information to do anything useful, and made a plan to go out and see what else they could dig up.\n\nSweeps.Andrew conferred with Jalees, freshly out of his dirt nap, and then gathered Sweeps.Connor and .Dah-veed before setting off to tail the PCs as they went about their plan. Jalees finished cleaning up the scene of the incident, and helped the Archbishop turn the police away. He then tailed along after Sweeps.Brittany and .Erasmus to the local lab.\n\nThe PCs, however, had a grand time tracking down the Toreador that had gone to ground - the assumed progenitor of the one that had splattered all over Esbat. After returning to his last known Haven, they spent almost an hour combing the place, inexpertly, with many failed rolls, in order to turn up any clues related to where he may have gone. Their one and only lead had been a matchbook from a local cigar shop, which they left to investigate.\n\nSweeps Squad came in behind them, and being much more tailored to the job, was able to pinpoint several important clues and make a few deductions that pointed them in the right direction. A call to Jalees netted them some more information on the attack - the composition of the explosive device, mainly - and allowed them to determine where his hideout was. On Jalees’ instruction, they carefully laid out certain pieces of evidence in somewhat obvious, but initially missable locations, so that the PCs could discover the clues on their own.\n\nWhen the PCs returned from their lead to the cigar shop, empty handed, and rolled far better this time around, they turned up all of the clues that Sweeps had set out for them, and were able to follow the logic. They immediately set off for the next location: a decommissioned water purification plant on the west side of town. By the time they had arrived, Sweeps Squad - back to strength - as well as Jalees had already been there several minutes, and had scouted the location thoroughly. Still not wanting to call attention to his participation, he held Sweeps Squad back for a while, while the PCs probed the plant and gathered their own intel.\n\nBeing close enough to hear their plan, Jalees was pleasantly, if slightly, surprised at how competent and tactical the PCs were. Though they had only limited information about the situation and the defenses, they had managed to come up with a solid plan that was adaptive enough to handle a wide range of things they might encounter. It wasn’t perfect, but it was good. Jalees decided to help them out a bit.\n\nJalees sent in Sweeps Squad to either handle or call attention to any obstacle that the PCs might encounter on their way in - tripwires, pressure plates, trapped handles - this place was like a DnD mapmaker’s masterpiece. Each path was carefully layered with various types of traps that could be activated, at varying difficulties to spot. Even the escape passage was littered with surprises to those going in the wrong direction.\n\nWhile the PCs appreciated the resulting easy stroll they had into the plant, it put them on edge that they had spotted every trap in time to deactivate or circumvent them. By the time they got to the actual haven portion of the area, their paranoia and caution had gone well past 11. What Sweeps Squad could do nothing about, however, was the fight against the Toreador and his guest.\n\nThat’s right. It wasn’t just the Toreador at the end of the hallway, he had a friend.\n\nAnd that friend was a Mage.\n\n\\&gt;\\&gt;[Final](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3mcjkv/vtmshort_the_new_adventures_of_jalees_kamal_part/)",

        "text": "Original post by /u/froggolfigor with a [link](http://imgur.com/ineUeeZ) to the cards in question. Someone complained that they'd rather read about these two than magic's planewalkers so... Here we are.\n\n\"In troubled times, we all need someone to watch our back.\"\n\n---\n\n“But it’s my day off…” moaned Latana. The precinct captain’s scowl would have been more intimidating had the homunculus at his side ceased hopping up and down. It whimpered and pointed out the Magister’s Garden gates and towards the city proper. The pathetic squeaks and chirps of the tiny cyclops only served to distract Latana from captain Barg Berath’s glare.\n\n“You don’t have to help me, private” said the captain, “but it’s either that or you keep an eye on this little guy while I follow this lead. I’m willing to bet this has to do with the missing locals. This little guy seems to be worried about one of the other garden keepers.”\n\n The homunculus seemed to wither under Latana’s gaze. She sighed and drew her sword. “Lead on then. Sir.”\n\nShe followed captain Berath out of the garden at a steady trot, grumbling between breaths. The streets surrounding the Magister’s garden were labyrinthian, dizzying in their narrowness and further complicated by winding staircases and cryptic road signs. The captain picked up speed. Latana worried he was running nearer and nearer to the center of Ravnica. Old “Bubbles” Berath had always struck her as brave, but never suicidal. Brave enough to single-handedly stop a rogue Izzet Bullaetron anyway. Latana sniggered.\n\n“There,” grunted the precinct captain before shouting “STOP WHERE YOU ARE!”\n\nLatana rounded a corner and saw four gaudy goblin jesters, each in black, red, and gold. Two of the clowns pushed along a twisted monstrosity of a wagon. It was covered in carvings of screaming faces, laughing demons, and razor sharp spines that seemed to be covered in rust. Two of the goblins turned to face Latana and her captain, their painted faces leering beneath the coming dusk. They cartwheeled and capered closer and closer while their companions made a break for it. Captain Berath’s sabre flashed out beneath the reddening sun, and one of the goblin’s arms sailed through the air before exploding. The goblin arsonist collapsed, blood gushing from its new stump.\n\nBriefly blinded by the explosion, Latana lost sight of the spiked jester. She rolled, dodging unseen claws. A streak of hot pain ran along her thigh, and she knew she was doomed. She’d always known life within the League of Wojek would be the death of her, but to fall on her day off just didn’t seem fair. A trickle of cold energy flashed down Latana’s spine and for an instant her hands seemed to burn with unknown energy. She flailed, desperate to cut the goblin before it could slash her again. Its horrendous laughter drove her panic to new heights.\n\nAt least until she realized the laughter sounded slightly familiar. It had a hint of captain Berath’s gruff voice. She glanced about and noticed the limp body of the goblin that had cut her. A dagger protruded from its back. It glistened a moment before melting away, like quicksilver. Latana realized then what must have happened. While she was blinded by the first goblin’s explosion, captain Berath must have thrown the dagger to save her life. She touched the cut along her thigh and realized it was barely a scratch. What of that flash of heat though? Surely it was just shock.\n\n“A present from those Izzet bastards” said captain Berath, between chuckles. “They gave that dagger to me as thanks for stopping that bubble contraption a few months ago. That and as an apology.”\nThe image of captain Berath belching bubbles with every word leapt unbidden to Latana’s mind. She smiled. “Thank you…” she said.\n\n“Don’t thank me yet,” said the captain, “we’re not done. I suspect those gobs have someone in that cart thing they were pushing. Can you run?”\n\nLatana lurched to her feet. Together they ran further towards Ravnica’s center until the shrieking laughter of goblins became audible. In the distance, the twisted forms forced the monstrous cart along, screeching and screaming with maddened glee. Captain Berath began to sprint, before Latana hissed “Wait!”\n\n“We can follow them,” she said, “you said there were more folks missing, right?”\n\nThe goblins never spared a glance for the two soldiers tailing them. Latana suspected they did not have a care in the world. Finally they came to a great stone stairwell, that spiraled deeper and deeper beneath the city proper. Latana could hear the cart thump-thump-thumping awkwardly down the great stone steps ahead of them. “Is it getting warmer?” she whispered. Captain Berath held a single finger to his lips and motioned her onwards.\t\n\nThey rounded a bend in the stairwell and saw a bone thin woman ordering the goblins to “take the recruit to his majesty.”\n\nCaptain Berath whispered a quick spell and the two goblins found themselves detained. Their sharpened claws and jester’s garb flailed about under the effects of Barg’s spell.\n\n“Neruxal help us!” they screeched, “Murder time mother, kill kill kill!”\n\nThe blood witch turned to face captain Berath and Latana. She smiled at their petty swords and pettier spells. These upstart guards would serve Rakdos’s horde well enough, once they were trained of course. With two steps and a sweep of her arm one of the goblins lay choking on its own blood at the witch’s feet, before Latana or the captain could blink. She cackled and licked blood from her knife, her eyes wide with psychotic glee. It’s two guards against one blood witch, thought Latana, we can handle this. That’s when the demon burst in.\n\nIt must have smelled the blood sacrifice. Two bat-like wings protruded above the demon’s beady eyes, and thousands of tiny teeth lined the biggest maw Latana had ever seen. It reached towards the last remaining goblin.  The goblin gibbered and screamed for Neruxal’s help, but the blood witch only laughed and backed away from the doomed creature.\n\nThe guards could only stare in horror as the demon opened its jaws and seemed to inhale what last semblance of sanity the goblin might have had. “Here is a lord of madness,” shrieked the witch, “kneel before the sire of insanity!”\n\n“Run, Latana! Tell others!” With a snarl captain Berath charged the demon.\n\nStrange words came to Latana’s lips. She had no idea from whence they came or what language they were in, but in that instant captain Berath glowed as Latana thought a hero should. He would protect and serve until his final breath. Yet all Latana could do was watch.\n\nThen something wholly unexpected happened. The demon cowered beneath the captain’s assault. Captain Barg “Bubbles” Berath leapt towards the demon’s maw, screaming havoc. His blade flashed crimson with torch-fire’s light. The demon fell.\n\nBoth Latana and her superior officer stared in amazement as the abomination collapsed beneath its own weight. A lopsided hunk of flesh rolled down the demon’s body and across the floor, before Latana realized it was the monster’s head. For a moment, she registered surprise within her captain’s eyes, then exaltation. Then pain.\n\nA tear in reality, like damnation’s black lightning streaked through captain Berath’s chest. The blade of necrotic magic slew him at the height of victory. Beneath the thunder’s peal, Latana thought she could hear the blood witch’s laughter.\n\nSomething within her broke then. She felt words of power come unbidden to her lips. Latana pointed her sword towards Neruxal, hands shaking as the words escaped her body. Neruxal’s eyes flashed pale gray in time with Latana’s litany and for a moment, the young guard felt the witch’s mind. The sensation lasted for less than a second, but in that time Latana could see the greater demon, one she assumed was Rakdos himself, descending upon carousing cultists, only too willing to spill blood in his name. “So eager to serve a higher cause, so eager to kill and be killed for power,” said Latana, “fine then. You shall serve and serve well.”\n\nThe blood witch lifted captain Berath’s blade and set the tip against her heart. Demon’s blood dripped down her chest. “You will serve.” Latana’s mind was full of light, her eyes shone pale blue within the gloom. They were the last thing Neruxal saw. The witch impaled herself on the captain’s blade. Past the point of no return, Latana felt her grasp over the witch’s mind, a control she barely knew she had, falter and evaporate.\n\nNeruxal’s body seemed to crumple and condense around the captain’s blade then. Latana watched in horror as the witch’s spirit stained the sword black. The tainted presence permeated the air, and Latana began to fear she had bound the evil spirit to her own.\n\nThen a familiar presence tickled the back of her mind. A pale spirit, the soul of a warrior, coiled around the hovering blade. The sword floated on spectral winds until it came to rest in private Latana Angilique’s grasp. She saw a white flash, a planeswalker’s spark, and found herself entranced. Latana fell into the light.\n\nSomewhere on distant Shandalar a lone guard searches for a way back to her native plane. A spirit’s bonds enchant her blade, half in light, half in shadow, and although she finds herself unsure which soul is more intimately bound with her own, she finds comfort in the duality of the sword she calls Retribution. She may walk alone, but she is never lonely. In troubled times, we all need someone to watch our back.\n\nE: and i screwed up tag. Blargh.",

        "text": "Recently I've been playing on a WoW Private RP. One of the big deviations from standard WoW is that a big guild has started up out of Menethil which seeks to conquer all of the Northern Eastern Kingdoms. Now, I joined a Forsaken (undead, essentially) guild called The Awakened. They're basically the undead's version of special ops. The server is also very much permadeath, so it's not recommended to get overly attached to a character. Many human players do, though.\n\nThey also really, really hate humans. The forces of Menethil had managed to conquer Andorhal (important city, basically controls the middle of the Western Plaguelands) and the Awakened had conquered it back for the Forsaken. Menethil decided to instead encamp themselves at Camp Chillwind and built it into something that could more accurately be described as a fort. Tensions are running high but we're technically not at war.\n\nIn this guild, I'm playing Spike who is affectionately termed \"Madman\" by his guild mates. The description fits, pretty much his sole desire is to stab things until they stop moving.\n\nA few days earlier, I'd been in an event where we infiltrated Stratholme (big city, filled with undead) disguised as ghouls. I had to log off and, for whatever reason, the ghoul disguise stuck to me.\n\nFor the next few days, I harassed the forces of Menethil at Chillwind. I'd taunt them by saying ghoul stuff \"MARGLE BARGLE GARGLE!\" and then attack one of them low and run away when the rest came. They could see I was doing it as a loner so they didn't have much fear of chasing me.\n\nThen, I saw quite a few people in the Awakened (and allied Horde forces) and the Menethil guild were online and a plan started to hatch. I didn't think the likelihood of it working was pretty high, but still...\n\nOnce again, I started to harass the forces at Fort Chillwind. Coming out of stealth and shouting at them was pretty effective and I started to run at full force away from them. They followed. Three of them. A paladin, a hunter and a warrior. A pretty deadly combo for the likes of a rogue like myself.\n\nThere's a small pass on the way to Andorhal. I vanished from in front of their eyes and suddenly people were coming out of the hills.\n\nI'd arranged an ambush. I'd run back with anyone who was following me, four of the people I was with would wait while I did so and we'd kill anyone who followed us.\n\nUnfortunately, it didn't quite work out like that.\n\nInstead of four people, there were only two. The other two were still in Andorhal for some unknown reason. Three versus three is fair odds, right? None of the three of us who were there were particularly good PvPers.\n\nBut our guild had the reputation of being elite assassins. I know of at least one case where a pair of my team mates went against eight and wiped them out.\n\nSo, immediately, the humans stop. They start talking. They got split up in the confusion and a pair of them are blocked off by a single undead mage. The one left is the warrior (major threat) so I beat him up until he's stunned and observing.\n\nAnother pair of humans are running down the road, obviously looking for a fight. I run to them, trying to at least slow them done when the cavalry arrives. My two extra team mates have showed up. One of the humans is a female warrior and she gets taken down almost immediately (and then tries to cheat to avoid her death, but that drama is for another time). The other is a female mage and I chase her a bit closer to the Fort itself but eventually take her down.\n\nWe drag the mage and the warrior back and I execute the warrior I'd managed to stun earlier. The hunter and the paladin see that there's no chance of them escaping unscathed and start to fight themselves. The hunter quickly dies and I'm not certain of the paladin's fate.\n\nPeople are quickly logging on on both sides and we start to retreat. The forces of Menethil are told to removed themselves completely from the Plaguelands or all their prisoners will be executed. Here and there isolated pockets of fighting are starting up as those who log on see each other and fight.\n\nI'm told that what we did was almost certainly a declaration of war but considering we managed to ambush and capture a significant amount of their players I don't think they'll be overly interested in battling it out.\n\n[mrw](http://i.imgur.com/emKaUcp.gif)\n\nP.S.

        "text": "[Previously (also has exposition/setting information)](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3cb6ss/l5r_young_herons/]\n\n***\n\n**The Party:**\n\n*Player Characters*\n\n* **Kakita Masumi**, of the Crane Clan, an excellent duelist and utterly fastidious to the point of compulsion. (Read: Took the negative trait 'Compulsion: Tidyness'.)\n\n* **Moto Anahita**, of the Unicorn Clan, who has a prized posession, an Utaku steed (Imagine a Western Warhorse put next to a pony, which is what a normal Rokugan Horse is.)\n\n* **Bayushi Masaru**, of the Scorpion Clan, somewhat estranged from his family.\n\n*Non Player Characters*\n\n* **Matsu Ryumko** of the Lion Clan. Likes a scrap, good in a scrap. Very much has a rivalry with Masumi.\n\n* **Kikata Misato** of the Crane Clan, and a relation of Masumi. Far more intelligent and cunning then her airheaded, serene appearence lets on.\n\nPreviously, with the Young Herons!\n\n* Our Magistrate master is kind of a lying, convinning dick.\n* He recently culled his 'Young Herons' (his 18-20Somethings that he blackmails the great clans into giving up so he can order them around for a few years,) by something like a half. This is *very* odd.\n* He then ordered everyone that was left, asides from the party, off on tasks, after interogating every one of us on... Odd, philosophical, often rather personal topics.\n* He then orders us off on a weeks long trip to an 'abandoned' fortress up in the mountains, in Dragon Clan lands, 'because there was movement' there. Oh, and because he had lots of good Sake arriving soon and he wanted to besot himself in peace. Also, it'll be cold, so wrap up warm! Also, have the symbol of his authority, which he only has one of, so don't lose it! (We give it to **Masumi**)\n* We head off, lightly smelling of bullshit.\n* We arrive at the base of the mountains, leave our Horses (with the exeption of Anahita's Horsezilla/sone to be snowplough) in the care of the local Henian (peasents,) secure a guide, and head into the mountains. Into a forming blizzard.\n* Arrive at (occupied) Fortress during said Blizzard. Refused Entry. Gig red flag. Apparently, they have orders to refuse entry to anyone not pre-approved. Bigger Red Flag. Over the course of an hour/two browbeat the voice on the other side of the Postern Gate into letting us in. (Didn't freeze to death! Success!) Henian Guide legs it. (Smart.)\n* Told we can cuddle against the Curtain wall. By twenty or so armed, not quite drawing Samurai and the Garrison Commander, one **Tamori Satsumen.**\n* However, the power of the Magistrate Symbol compels him, once it is uttered that this Fortress is the subject of our present inquiry, to give us guest rooms and freedom of the Castle.\n* Investigation Commences! Let's split up gang!\n* As it turns out, the Fortress is something of a school, with only one student: A Charming young lady by the name of **Hinata**, whom, despite the  lack of Clan name (making her either a bastard or a Peasent) is dressed in the very finest clothes.\n* There is a discussion with one of her tutors, an **Arit Sugu** who bemoans the decadent state of the Empire (this is a very Dragon thing to do: They're known for their asceticism and piety. Some of the other Clans... *Aren't*.) He also bemoans that **Hinata** hasn't accepted his obviously correct positions.\n* **Anahita** offers **Hinata** a ride on **Anahita**'s simply massive (seriously: This is a Western Warhorse to a bunch of Rice-Eating, mostly meat abstaining medieval Japanese people. It's *huge*) Horse. **Hinata** eagerly accepts, and everyone who normally lives here because very worried. *Very* worried. *Stupid* worried.\n* It's only then that the entire party lays eyes on **Hinata** at once.\n* GM calls for Void checks. **Masaru** alone passes.\n* Hurridly gathers the party in their rooms (closest thing to private we'd found.)\n* ...**Hinata** bears an uncanny resemblence to the Hantei family. The wiped out, dead to root and branch, original Imperial Family.\n* Discussion! Argument! Worry! People's naive visions of the world crumbling around their ears! (it hasn't been a good day for poor **Ryumko**.)\n* Finally, we confront **Tamori Satsumen** (the Garrison Commander) about it, posting **Misato** to keep an eye on **Hinata**. He commits Seppuku rather than answer.\n* Oh.\n* Ok.\n* Alright then.\n* Guess that settles that.\n* The Second in Command knows nothing. **Arit Sugu** does, though, and spills everything, mostly because he isn't aware that **Misato** 'innocently' led **Hinata** into earshot.\n* To wit: The Dragon Clan (or at least this sect of it) kidnapped a Hantei, and has, for 250 years or so, been trying to indoctrinate a child of Hantei blood into the Dragon view of the world. Once this was done, they would then get the Dragon-View Hantei onto the Imperial Throne, who would then reform the Empire to follow the Dragon Clan ways, and it would be *betterforeveryone* ^^(tm)\n* Trying, and failing. **Arit Sugu** theorised that it was something inherent in the Imperial Blood. Every time they failed, they would, crudely, drug and rape the Imperial they had to produce the next one. Presumably, they would then kill the old one.\n* It soon becomes clear to us that our Magistrate master knew... Something about this. We decide that our course of action is to remove **Hinata** from here, and bring her to our Magistrate Master.\n* Recall that we are up a mountain range, during a Blizzard. There are two exits: South, back the way we came. **Sugu** told us that it was death to go that way. (As it happened, a runner had been sent that way as soon as we arrived, practically.)\n* Or, we go North.  This fortress was built to guard a passage through the Mountains, out of the Empire, into the Burning Sands. Gaijn Lands.\n\nThat's where we left off.\n\nWe promptly spend 20 in-game minutes arguing over which way to go (North, or South.) Consequently, we do nothing to stop **Sugu** effecting a Coup. No, really. We even noticed that he was up to something. We just accepted it was going to happen and wondered weather to leave faster or hole up and fight everyone. We chose South. (Well, we chose to delegate it to **Misumi** who chose to go South.a\n\nWe chose to leave faster, armoured up. (L5R may well be the only setting where you're not meant to spend most of it in armour.) We raided the barracks for winter clothing for Hinata (who has been raised with knowledge on every topic, asides from those valuable to escape attempts. And music, theatre etc because those were decadent and wrong. *Obviously*.) Saddled up Horsezilla, and made to leave.\n\nWe were attacked, because of course we were. The three Samurai guarding the main and Postern Gates (unarmoured) and an officier type (Armoured) made to stop us. They died. Another one joined the fight, have just killed someone (blood on the blade.) He died two. Four Samurai appeared at the far end of the Courtyard. We saw where this was going.\n\nWe made to leave, and were accosted by the Horsemaster, wielding Torch and Katana. He, thankfully, wasn't part of the Coup, and, once it was assertained that **Hinata** wished to leave in our Company, he covered our escape at great personal cost to himself.\n\nNot only did he physically impose himself in the Postern gate, blocking the way, and fight our pursuers until his death, he set the stables aflame, his beloved horses with it. Those Horses, no doubt, were his life's pride and joy. And he damned them to death in flames, all for us.\n\nWe never did learn his name.\n\nWe set off, as fast as we could manage, during a (thankfully lessening) blizzard, with Horsezilla as a snowplough. We managed. *Just*, **Anahita's Void (Edge, Fate/Hero/Luck points) infused rolls *just* enough to keep us ahead. The Horsemaster had bought us time, but not much and pursuit was never far behind, in the form of 8 Samurai, bearing lanterns.\n\nThe distances involved would have put them terrifyingly close if not for the blizzard conditions. 1/4 of a mile is not much on level ground.\n\nThankfully, they needed rest as well as we did, and we could get some fitful, freezing, huddling sleep at night, having dug into the snow to form windbreaks.\n\nThe Blizzard lessened over the course of the next day, to the point where we had sufficient rope to lower someone down to the valley these mountains loomed over. We were unwilling to split the party. But they did not know that. We lowered **Masaru** and **Anahita** down, and they set a hearty fire, that would burn all night.\n\nDawn rose, and they lowered men down to check, whilst the rest of them awaited their return. We put the time to good use, moving, towards the village where the rest of our ponies were.\n\nBy midday, the Blizzard was finished, and the going was easier that **Anahita** volunteered to ride down to the village, and get our horses secure. Every minute counted.\n\nAnd so she rode down to teh village, to find it interdicted, by a portly Metsuke (sort of an Under-Magistrate who's authority only extends within  a particular Clan's Lands.)\n\nHe had orders to apprehend anyone who entered the village, and hold them until the Magistrate he served arrived.\n\nHowever, the Metsuke was... Suspicious of his orders, done on such a hurried and irregular basis. As such, he chose to interpret *the Village* as *the area of land emcompassed by this low stone wall that surrounds it.* And just that. When **Anahita** spied our Henian Guide and told him to make our Horses ready to ride, and bring them outside the Village, he made no move to stop it from happening.\n\nAs it happened, his Magistrate master was one **Mirumoto Sensihei** of the Dragon Clan. He had a reputation for rigidity and harshness, but was known to be even-handed and fair. And for quarreling famously with **Isawa Mensobara**, *our* Magistrate Master.\n\nInvolved? Dupe? Who knew. Do not meet.\n\nThe rest of the Party finally arrives at the Village's outskirts. He recieve our Horses, exchange pleasantries with the Portly Metsuke (he asks what the bloody hell is going on we don't tell him, just that the 'abandoned' Fortress up thataway isn't, and oh, detain the guys coming us please?) And our Henian guide (who is afraid that he did something wrong and that we'lre going to kill him.)\n\nFor his part, the Portly Metsuke warns that his Magistrate Master will arrive soon, and that he will ordered to track us, and that he will be able to.\n\nWe then go around the village, managing our Horses over some hilly terrain, and hit the road to Pheonix lands, within which our Magistrate Master lies, and to which he belongs. Our destination is obvious. Speed is our protection.\n\nLate afternoon, and a snag. A sudden cold snap is about to set in, and we're in terrible shape. We've spent three days in our armour, freezing, doing hard labour, without proper rest. Our clothes and armour are sodden, our skin swamped with sweat. We haven't eaten enough, we haven't slept enough.\n\nThis may well kill us, and we can't find good shelter.\n\nWe collapse into what shelter we can. We can't light a fire. One or more of use may well die, or one of the horses, or possibly **Hinata** and this will have-\n\nA monkey pops it's head up to watch us (a Snow Ape, to be precise.) then a few more. Then one in face paint appears and starts talking. To us. In words we understand. It'ls even (mostly) gramtically correct!\n\nNo, really.\n\n\"My Lady,\" the painted one intones, after a bout of screeching at another one of the Snow Apes. \"We are honoured by your presence.\"\n\nAs if there was doubt, this dispells it. The Hantei line were descended by an Exiled Queen of the Kami (spirits) and as such, the Kami were duty and honour bound to obey those of the Hantei blood. He is, it seems, King of the Snow Apes. Well, most of them. Well, some of them...\n\nTherefore, he was referring to **Hinata**. Who is practically shell-shocked by the entire experience. And the past few days. Finding out you're a walking Civil War can do that.\n\nHe graciously offers us hospitality and we hurriedly accept.\n\n\"Follow, Follow!\" He cries, and bounds off (he's still a monkey, talking or no.)\n\nWe follow him to a pair of hot springs (the horses, which he does *not* like, and shoved off to the 'Lower Pool'. We, of two legged stature, are hosued in the Higher pool. With him and 25 of so other Apes.\n\nAfter some mild umming and arring, (**Masaru** being the only male member in a party of six) we strip down and get it, **Masaru** announcing that he will face the wall.\n\nThe Cold Snap passes mostly without incident. There is an incident where the Moneky King objects to one of **Misato**'s Katana's (the one which, for undisclosed reasons, she has sworn to not draw,) being in the water. For... Some reason. **Misato** graciously removes it from the water.\n\nThe Cold Snap passes at Nightfall. Directly, immediately, and absolutely. (It's a Kami thing). The Monkey King feeds us from his *Magic Rock! And Hole! ... Magic RockHole!** From which he proffers Fresh fruits and berries, and a singledead squirrel. (We pass on the Squirrel.)\n\nThe Monkey King also asks for a token of (**Hinata's**) appreciation. A Lock of hair, it seems, will do, and he transforms it into a Golden Band he wears around a wrist. After which, he picks up a Kimono which most certainly was not there before with it's very own Monkey Paw Mon (sigil).\n\nHe's also inordinately pleased with himself, talking loudly) to himself about how he'll be able to unite all the Snow Apes now, under his... Banner? Paw?\n\nOops. Didn't think that through did we?\n\nAs a final service (for now) he leads us on a shortcut, Horses and all. (He really doesn't like the horses. Belittles them in fact, declaring that Monkeys were far superior. On occasion jabbing his thumbs out in front of the horses and screeching 'Master Race! Master Race!')\n\nAs it turns out, a Supernaturally effective shortcut. A great River divides Dragon and Pheonix Lands, and the Bridge is almost in sight.\n\n**Anahita** tells him that we will have pursuit, and that we would rather that we didn't.\n\nIt's only when Monkeys grin that you realise just how many teeth they have.\n\nThis kills the Portly Metsuke, who's name, again, we never asked.\n\nWe did ask the name of the Monkey King.\n\nRakuman. I suspect it won't be the last we see of him (at the very least because the GM loved playing him.)\n\nWe thank him and ride on, cresting a low hill. The Bridge is in sight.\n\n\"But the Bridge will be another matter entirely.\" Annouced the GM, and closed the session.",

        "text": "So some quick backstory here. Previous to this night I was just playing with two other guys and the DM. The DM's a good guy and has put up with a lot of our crap and I ended up ruining his plans last night by acting on instinct, which had served me well until our last session. However last night we added two new players, who ended up becoming a cleric and mage, respectively. I am a monk and the two other guys were a cleric and fighter. \n\nSeveral sessions ago we encountered two half-giants in the woods while trying to kill an ogre. I played it safe by approaching them alone, but having my companions in the shadows ready to jump out if anything went wrong. My instincts said these were okay people and I was right. They were just trying to join the Erathic Order of Knights, dedicating to killing always chaotic beings like ogres. Long story short our party killed the ogre and gave a tusk to them, allowing them and eventually ourselves to join the Order.\n\nFlash forward to last night. Introductions were made for the new members as we set out to find a missing Eladrin paladin, who'd last been seen south of the city we were in several years ago. She was wielding a very powerful greatsword that would be easy to identify. So we came into the town, asking the sheriff if he'd seen her. He knew nothing, but nonchalantly mentioned that someone named Garg had the sword, but wouldn't go into detail about who Garg was, but that he was last seen at the quarry near the town, having wanted to eliminate some evil snake people. (Can't recall the name of the race. It was only mentioned after the fiasco I caused.)\n\nSetting out this way, we discovered an ogre sitting in the middle of quarry and debated on what to do. I, knowing that ogres are always chaotic evil, decided it would be best to sneak attack him. The ogre we'd fought before had been a chump, so I figured this would take four rounds of fighting at worst. I failed my attempt to hit the ogre with a dart (I have yet to hit anything with a dart) and the fighter critically failed his attempt to shoot his crossbow. However our mage managed to hit it with a firebolt, alerting it to our presence. \n\nIt didn't take long for the ogre to reach us, wielding the greatsword of the presumably dead paladin, thus making me think it had killed her some time ago and was now fighting using her old weapon. The fighter got in front on one side of a narrow passage and I was on the other side. But our best efforts sucked. This ogre was packed to the teeth with amazing abilities and reactions that we barely had anything to counter it with. The female cleric wanted to see if healing it would make it stop attacking us, sensing something was wrong, but I shot it down, given that the only good ogre was a dead ogre. The mage was doing remarkably well from afar, taking potshots at it. Both clerics were desperately trying to keep us alive. The fighter was knocked off the cliff side and took a little damage, leaving me alone to face it. I managed to hit it once, but my second attack missed, leaving me vulnerable to its reaction, which ended up with me losing all of my hit points. The female cleric was able to heal me back, but I lost my health again, as did she and the other cleric. The female cleric and I both got natural 20s on our saving throws, allowing us to come back to life. However, the ogre was getting tired of my resurrection hax and made me lose my health for the third time and used a second attack that did damage that was over half my health, killing me instantly. \n\nI was in shock. I'd misunderstood the rules. The DM had to remind me of how death works in 5e. So I sat there in shock while the rest of the party tried to avenge me, while also mocking me IRL. The female cleric got the last blow on the ogre, finally killing him. The sword fell over the edge and the mage went to retrieve it and got some psychic damage for her trouble. The fighter wrapped it up in some cloth and left the quarry (and my corpse) behind. \n\nBack at the town they tried to talk to the sword, who was mad at them for some reason, having actually gained sapience in some way. Come to find out its name was Moonslicer and it was pissed that we had killed the ogre that it had been working very hard to make into a good being. The ogre also happened to be named Garg, i.e. the town's defender. \n\nThis was when accusations were thrown around the room about whose fault it was. Some blamed me for being so gung-ho and not thinking through the situation. Others blamed the DM for not letting the sheriff tell us that Garg was an ogre or for the fact that he had earlier stated that all ogres were always chaotic evil. This went on for a bit until it calmed down and the DM told us the story of Garg: (https://www.reddit.com/comments/2mjhz9/) and how he was once an ordinary evil ogre, but Moonslicer (possessed by the spirit of the Eladrin paladin who we'd been looking for) had managed to get him to help other people and eventually he'd turned good. He was only at the quarry to kill the evil snake people who were still very much alive thanks to our interference and was only sitting down, because he was upset that he couldn't fit into the cave that they were hiding in. \n\nOf course the feels set in and we realized just how terrible we all were as human beings. And that was how the session ended. \n\n(Oh, and those jerks were still debating whether or not I deserved a burial.) ",

His research also allowed him to reconstruct the spell it was meant to amplify, cast darkness. During her absence in dealing with family drama, Freya travelled into town and convinced the local blacksmith to construct her a battle axe ‘on the sly’. Her family didn’t need to know. Perry converses with Cal about his finds, as Arrow enters the tower and moves to Tekex’s side. Before anyone can react, the young teen plunges a blade into the goblin sorcerer, claiming final revenge for the act of kidnapping his fiancee. The body convulsed and fell limp in the chair.\n\nThe party exploded in confrontation, and tempers arose. Perry and Freya demanded that they could’ve gotten more information out of the captured goblin, whereas Arrow only shrugged. The confrontation almost turned physical with threats from each side (It should be mentioned that Perry and Arrow’s players are brother and sister and enjoy bickering), but Cal broke up the flaring emotions with a new find. The party had never really thought to search Tekex too closely after his capture, and he found a strange rod of a few feet in length. He could feel the magic inside of it, and carried it to the middle of Lundenfeld, feeling the desire to be in an open space while holding it. Thrusting it high in one hand, roiling stormclouds suddenly appeared on what had been a calm summer afternoon. Lightning and rain struck at the village for almost a full minute before he tucked it away, and the clouds abated. Amazed at the find, he rushed back to the group.\n\nMeanwhile, the group decided what to do about the Tekex situation. They carried the body to another goblin pit marked on their map, setting it up on a post as a sort of grim scarecrow. They quickly scribbled a note onto a stone and tossed it down to the goblins waiting around a fire. The goblins looked up and saw the corpse, but the warning letter was written in English and they could not understand. Perry quickly tossed down another letter that said ‘You have been warned’, and the group set the goblin sorcerers’ body ablaze. Arrow tossed down another stone, no message this time, for good measure. They four teens headed back to the village, where a town meeting had been called. It seemed there was a bandit problem on Turner Road, which connected the small community to the rest of the kingdom.\n\nFeeling high in adventurous spirit, the group decided to try and solve this themselves. Cal dressed himself in normal clothes, carefully remembering the correct incantations for his magical shield spell, as the others hid in the back of the wagon. They would surprise the bandits and destroy them, in theory. After riding down the road for a few hours, they are suddenly set upon by bandits popping up from the bushes, brandishing facemasks and short-swords.\n\nThe plan had been for Cal to talk with them and slip in a secret code word, allowing the party to spring into action. Freya stayed her hand, ready to use her new battle axe. But Arrow, ever eager to be a the knight he desired to be, leaped from his hiding place, roaring and tossing a rock far above the heads of the bandits. Element of surprise completely lost for him, two of the bandits grabbed him out of the back. Now suspicious, another bandit plunged his blade into the back, striking and cutting Perry, who remained tight-lipped despite the burning pain. Freya remained still as well, cursing Arrow for his lack of control. Meanwhile, Arrow finds himself on the wrong end of the bandit’s blade as he remains grappled by the bandit who dragged him free of the wagon.\n\nSeeing as the entire plan had dissolved around him, Cal utters the codeword, alerting the rest of the group. He also casts his spell, and a wave of magical energy suddenly appears about him like a rippling wave. Just in time, as two bandits close around him at sword-point. With the codeword uttered, Freya leaps free of her blanketed hiding space, swinging her axe down upon the closest bandit. With utter, and surprising ease, she cleaved the edged side of the weapon deep into the man’s head, causing him to gurgle and collapse to the ground.\n\nArrow headbutts the bandit holding him, smashing his nose and finally freeing himself. Still in hiding, Perry slips a blade into the neck of the bandit that had stabbed her, the man suddenly falling like a sack of potatoes. She tosses the blanket away, ready to fight. At the front of the wagon Cal prepared to hop off, into a better fighting position, but tripped over his own shoes, collapsing face-first onto the floor. The bandit he almost collided with slashes hard with his sword, but sparks fly as the steel blade clashes with the supernatural energy protecting the young mage.\n\nWith his arms now free, Arrow brings about his greatsword and cuts an awesome gash into the bandit that had the gall to cut his skin with the cold blade. Freya, still standing on the wagon, held another bandit at bay, slicing a nice gash in his face. The last bandit not engaged starts to flee into the woods, huffing and puffing as his life surely flashes before his eyes. Perry tried to fell him with an arrow but missed, and Cal tosses a dagger that also misses. Seeing how ranged isn’t working, Freya hops off and darts after the fleeing bandit. Perry turns the grip of her dagger onto the last bandit, knocking him out. Freya caught up with her escapee, hopping onto his back and downing him. A quick slice ends his life as well.\n\nWith the fight over, the group reconvened and wonders what to do. They loot the bodies and find little besides the personal weapons and clothing of the bandits, though they pick up a wanted poster for the ‘Turner Road Gang’ that proves useful. They gather up the bodies, dead and unconscious, and toss them in the wagon. They bring it back to town and produce the evidence of their deeds to the town marshall, who pays them each fifty coins each for the bounty. The group heads home for the night, wondering what to do about the darkstone and encroaching evil. Cal offers up Marc ANTony, the rumored forest spirit living deep in the woods around Lundenfeld that serves as a sort of protector. He had been studying the rumors in Corpol. Readying their gear the four headed off into the woods to find the ancient spirit.\n\nAs the day wore on, Arrow felt something was amiss as he lead the group. Before he could act though, a large bear came rushing out of the underbrush, roaring and spitting. Death was clear in its eyes, and the group panicked. Freya started for a tree, trying to climb up to freedom. Both Cal and Arrow found themselves at the razor-sharp claws of the bear, ripping apart their clothing. The bear lunged with its jaws, snapping shut just shy of Perry’s face. But as it lunged, it got its head stuck between two branches, firmly entrenched. Arrow brought his sword about, blade cleaving through and diving into the ursine flesh. It shuttered and died where it was stuck. The group decided to spent a few hours skinning the bear, not wanting to let it all go to waste. Cal wondered aloud why it might’ve attacked at all, but these thoughts were drowned out as they readied the meat and gathered the hide. They decided to camp and spend the night.\n\nThe next morning they set out again to find Marc ANTony. The search ended at a large tunnel built into the side of a hill, and a rumbling appeared. They set some bear meat at the entrance, and Perry sang a song about the spirit’s mighty deeds. Before they knew what had happened, the large bulbous head of an ant appeared, antennas flicking and mandibles clicking lightly. The massive ant spoke to them all,telepathically, granting them a question each. In turn he answered them, making their worst fears known.\n\nIt seems that the goblins have indeed been rallied by some power far greater than their own drive, a demon of pure and utter Chaos that has wanted to rip the throat of mankind since Freya’s father’s father. The very same demon that consume Cal’s master in a apocalyptic fireball during a botched conjuring, one who is indeed even older than the forest spirit himself. The only way to save Lundenfeld, and the entire kingdom, is to unite the powers of men against the demon’s reach, but it might already be too late…\n\nWith that the spirit departed, and the group was forced to head back home, stewing with this new knowledge.",

        "author": "Lineli",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3jwqv0/werewolf_the_apocalypse_how_my_first_session/",
        "text": "Well, this afternoon my first game of Werewolf the Apocalypse began, and my first session was...eventful.  So listen well to the tale of Tilvan the Galliard! Who started getting in large amounts of trouble from the moment he became a Werewolf...\n\nTilvan triggered later in life, at the ripe old age of 21!  He'd spend most of his life traveling around the Americas and I decided to pick a random location in the Americas by closing my eyes and pointing at google maps.\n\nMy finger landed next to Ecuador, now its worth noting that 3 of the 5 people involved are very new to Werewolf and White Wolf games in general.  Our Storyteller and the other PC know a ton about it.  Thus I was both confused and concerned when the two of them paused, and started to laugh about the location.  If you have any idea about Werewolf you may know what the problem is...\n\nSo given that Tilvan is quite curious and loves collecting stories, he was in some random Ecuadorian town deciding to look into some rumors about a local cop that was corrupt.  He figured there might be something worth re-telling there.  So he ends up at a local Newspaper who direct him upstairs to one of the reporters who might know something.  Turns out he wasn't in that day, but I went in anyway to poke around for some clues.\n\nA few minutes later I hear sirens, I look out the door and then panic.  Police nearby,  in the building.  Why I don't know, but it didn't really matter.  So out the window I go.  In theory, unfortunately I roll a botch and dive head first into the wall.\n\nCops bust in, I wig out and black out as per usual for a trigger from what I understand.  I then wake up later in a large truck with a bag over my head covered in blood.  I am of course baffled at this, and everything.\n\nI'm thrown out and the bag is pulled off, surrounded by were-cats who are -very- unhappy given that a werewolf has just flipped out and murdered several people, including a few were-cats(not that I knew this in character).\n\nI sit there confused as they threaten me and tell me to get over the border which is a few feet away and never come back or they'll kill me.  So, still having no idea whats happening I panic and scramble over the border...into a group of werewolves who I later find out are there to get me before I cause an incident.  They were too late...and beat me unconscious out of fury.\n\nAnd that's how within 15 minutes of the session started I caused a major diplomatic incident and ended up banned from Ecuador.  All without having any idea what so ever why this was all happening.\n\nFast forwards a bit and when I wake up in the Cairn that my group is starting at, the werewolves that beat me unconscious curse me out while sarcastically explaining almost nothing(helped along by being pissed at how confused and stupid I was acting due to fear and possible concussion).\n\nThankfully I had things explained soon, and before long two other werewolves and I were sent on our Rite of Passage...to go rescue a soon to trigger human(our fourth party member) because he has vampires after him.\n\nWe eventually track down the soon to be werewolf in a restraunt where he is meeting up with some people...which is actually a trap by the vampires to kill him.  We open the door to see him get shot and transform the first time.\n\nAnd so combat begins...with a frenzied werewolf wanting to kill everything, and a bunch of vampires and ghouls.  It doesn't go too bad to start...then our Theruge rolls a triple botch to punch a ghoul.  The ghoul ends up slipping in blood and emptying several bullets from its Uzi into her, she falls back into a shelf...which falls on her and causes several knives to end up slicing through her face including one that gets -lodged- into her face.  That's Battle Scar #1 for the group.\n\nI execute the ghoul that shot her and made her fall into the shelf and then try to shoot another one...and botch the roll causing me to shoot the frenzied werewolf.  It doesn't hurt him, but he turns and smacks me one.  Very very hard.  Hard enough to flay my entire arm open and knock me unconscious.  Battle Scar #2.\n\nThings were finished soon after as between the frenzied werewolf and the Philodox in Crinos form the vamps either die or run.  Our first session ended with reporting in the results and forming a pack between the four of us.\n\nOf course, Tilvan being who he is, he ends up thinking of some ways to brag about the battle scars which we acquired in not very impressive ways.  So when someone decides to ask us about them here are how he plans to explain things.\n\n“Sofia's facial scar? Got that at the same time as I got the one on my arm.  A true battle that was! We had to rescue a cub beset by vampires and ghouls, so many of them that we barely made it out alive!  Sofia got those scars while tackling away a ghoul about to stab the poor cub in the back...and I avenged them for her, executing the wretched thing.  As for my arm? Well, that was done while trying to save the cub from himself, keeping him from doing something that he'd regret when he woke.  Honorable scars all of them...after all, protecting the young is always a worthy cause to throw yourselves into!”",

        "text": "\"Sir!  Fall back!\"  I shout into the micro bead.  I climb the stairs as swiftly as I can without losing my cover, passing the battered Zez on my way up.  She is fine for now.  My first and foremost concern is for Klaus' safety.\n\nI cannot succeed in my plans if we lose our Rogue Trader.\n\nFor the first time I reach the very top of the stairs, ducking and weaving through the bodies of our fallen guards.  Odette is now silent, apparently fully concentrating, arms outstretched and shaking.  The strain on her mind is taking its toll.\n\nI look around as Court meticulously carries on his duty, eradicating the skeletons one after another with surgically placed shots.  This time I watch as he blasts another to pieces, whittling their numbers down to just two.\n\nHowever, those that remain have gathered enough energy for their next assault.  For a third time light cascades from their eyes and combines into one bolt, crashing into my Lord atop the beastly Navigator.  Again despite my warning, I was not able to prevent the attack I foresaw from connecting.\n\nI do not hear my Lord scream.  Instead, his laughter pierces the air, ignoring the hit as if it were just a light show.  With their numbers finally diminished, the strikes from the undead seem to do nothing more than tickle, as my Lord shakes it off effortlessly.\n\nWas my vision wrong?\n\n\"I can't do this while those things keep him alive!\" Odette staggers back, hands covering her face, pulling out of the psychic duel.  She violently shakes her head, grabbing the hell pistol as her side and hoisting it up, aiming behind the hulk, before shooting wildly towards the skeletal terrors.  By some miracle, her manic firing pierces both the skulls of the remaining corpses, their fowl breath disappearing as their lights finally die out.\n\nMy Lord looms over the Navigator hulk, the last of the abominations to fall, ready to strike it with a final blow.  He raises his power sword - and stops.\n\nEdging in closer, I see why.  The Navigator, now freed from its duel with Odette, has its bulbous eye focused on Klaus paralyzing him in place.  I dare not imagine the torture inflicting his mind right now.  The blood curdling cries from my Lord echo all the more louder the second time around, only now I'm unable to open my eyes and switch them off.\n\nI line up the shot with my inferno pistol, attempting to aim whilst trying not to be drawn in by the hypnotic flare emitting from the transmogrified eye.  I can't afford to miss at a time like this.\n\nIf I miss...\n\nMy hesitation grants Court time to take the initiative.  Releasing his gun's trigger, Court whips out his blade.  He sprints over, taking a page from our Lord's book, moving between Klaus and the hulk, attempting to imitate the powerful strike Klaus performed minutes ago.  With a mighty cry Court drives his sword through the open gash in the stomach and up into the creature's ribcage, reaching its beating heart.  The steel skewers right through, rending the monster as its eye rolls about wildly - then halts - still and glassy.\n\nJust when we think the ordeal is done, the monster's heart starts to pump frantically, blood gushing everywhere.  Faster and faster, as if it's going to -\n\n...explode.\n\nI dive backwards towards the stairs, shielding myself from the blast with the bodies of the fallen crewmen.  Flesh, bone and guts catapult all over the room, coating the speckled green walls with a brand new shade.  The force of the blast emits a wave of energy pushing everything around, before letting cold, rancid blood rain down and shower everything in sight.\n\nSeconds go by.  When I'm certain the fight is finally over I push away the corpses, finding my feet.  I look around the team, noticing them crawling out of their respected cover, dodging the blast.  All expect Odette, who is slowly trying to wipe the gore away, only succeeding to rub the mess into the sleeve of her void suit.\n\n\"Zez, we need you up here.\"  Court calls over the comms, immediately back to business.\n\n\"What about the monsters?\"  She asks breathlessly.\n\n\"It's been taken care of.\"  I respond.  Carefully Zez joins us in the room amidst the old and new cadavers.\n\n\"Goodness, Odette you look terrible!\"  My Lord approaches Odette, seemingly recovered from the hypnosis, pulling a towel out from his pack.  Despite sounding like his usual self, his face is still ghostly pale from the trauma he suffered.  \"You smell like Ork's undergarments.\"  I bite my tongue, refusing to point out that in his void suit he cannot smell anything, a fact I am overjoyed about given the dire state of the area.\n\nZez and Odette move towards the Navis Primer and begin the data extraction.  Court, noticing that all the men he took into the tower have either abandoned their post or been subject to a violent death, moves around the room dealing with the aftermath.\n\n\"Kaleb,\" my Lord approaches, \"do you have a minute?\"\n\nIf this is another quip about why *I* was not the one to charge into melee, I think my patience may wear a little too thin.  \"Yes sir.\"  We move to the side out of the others' way.\n\n\"It's rather important.  The Barron is already witness to this.\"  An interesting time to bring up something of consequence.  Nevertheless I let him continue.  \"We need to be prepared.  Emperor knows I could fall in battle.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't allow that sir.\"  What is he saying?\n\nHe smiles kindly.  \"Yes.  Call it a back up plan then.\"  Klaus pats me on the shoulder.  \"I've decided to name you my heir.  You will be Rogue Trader in my place, if I die.\"\n\n[Start](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3dfr45/tales_from_a_seneschal_rogue_trader/) | [Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3itvev/rogue_trader_tales_from_a_seneschal_part_7/) | [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3kpswp/rogue_trader_tales_from_a_seneschal_part_9/) | [Last](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3xlc9d/rogue_trader_tales_from_a_seneschal_part_16/)\n",

        "text": "This is the follow up of: \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2tx4pv/dark_heresy_flight_marshal_manfred_herald_of_gork/\n\nFast forward 7 months (being a play by forum, the rythm is not as fast as a live roleplay). \n\nOur heroes, after trying to defend the remaining offshore platforms from an ork kommando attack, and after a quick sortie wearing atmospheric diving suits at the base of the pylons to protect them from the assault of a submersible, have been captured by the orks. \nSeeing they put on a good fight, Warlord Genghis Grimtoof decide to keep them alive for the show of the day after. \nThey are given food and brought in front of the huge warboss, sat on his Throne of Shootas (a monstruosity built with all the guns of his fallen enemies), to which are chained several prisoners: a kroot shaper, a dark eldar succubus and an Imperial Guard Colonel. Grimtoof decides to have fun with them, and starts a Zafari: he disappears in a big warehouse, reemerging on top of a looted great knarloc. \nThe beast has been armoured and heavily modified: his eyes are now twin zzap guns, and inside his beak there is a flamethrower.\nThe survivor are chained together in couples and set free inside the ork kamp, chased by the warboss riding the armored beast. The interrogator manages to snatch a rokkit launcha from a cheering tankbusta, before shooting Grimtoof itself in the face and making it fall down the beast, that proceed to stomp it, breaking its spine. \nAfter a quick escape on board of the knarloc (during which they save the Magos, a.k.a the target of the whole mission), the interrogator frees the prisoners, and everybody runs toward a big parking lot they saw earlier, where they find several trucks. \n\nNow, remember good 'ol Manfred? He split up from the main group before, during the safari, and headed to the parking lot to steal a truck with the help of a biomancer that was sent by the rival inquisitor to save them (never said they were real enemy, just rivals... more so, the information in possess of the magos are precious to her, too). \nAnyway, Manfred is presented a choice: which truck should he steal? \nAfter a quick thought, our Herald of Gork and Mork chooses wisely: a Deathstrike Missile transport truck, with said missile still on board. \nNow, for whose who aren't familiar with the fluff, a Deathstrike Missile is basically an ICBM: if you are lucky it mounts a plasma warhead, capable of vetrify a city block; from there, it can hold bacteriological/chemical weapons, all the way up to Vortex warheads, weapons that rip the reality apart, swallowing everything nearby and dragging it to hell. No, it is not an euphemism: they literally send it in the warp).\nAnyway, the whole group jumps on board while a whole Kult of Speed starts chasing them across the desert. \n\nA couple of buggy and warbikes reach them, and one of the cars buttrams the truck with such force to become stuck in the bumper. \nA player, Stormtrooper Captain Iakton Lazareus, in an attack of acute Manfredite, goes full Hulkmania: he holsters his hellpistol and charges the ork that is crawling out of the broken windshield. Bare handed. \n\nWhile the rest of the group looks at them, puzzled, the magos takes a closer look to the warhead, discovering that it is, in fact, an ork made nuclear bomb. It is operative, but thanks to the Emperor and the Omnissiah it is not live... but, speaking of ork technology, it is better to be really careful with it. \n\n'You Are So Fucked Index\" (YASFI) so long: 90. They are on a truck in the middle of the desert, chased by a whole Kult of Speed, and Manfred is at the wheel.\n \nA few turns later, another wave of chaser reaches them: two trucks, one of which was once a firetruck... and now is a literal firetruck: the orks filled it with prometheum, turning it from a fire extinguishing hose into a giant flamethrower. More so, it still has the telescopic ladder, which they use as a boarding plank. \nThe other truck (a haule vehicle whose rear mineral bay has been turned in a bunker) follows closely, but one of the soldiers manage to burst one of its tires and it is left behind for a while. \nTwo deffkoptas suddenly appears from behind the dune the truck is climbing, and one of them (armed with a huge buzzsaw) almost rips the arm away from the biomancer, that falls on the floor of the cabin screaming loud and bleeding profusely. \nThe biomancer casts dull pain: 9 on the roll. \n\"What does it mean?\" the less familiar with the system may ask.\n\"It means problems.\" will answer whoever has played dark heresy. \n\"Usually big problems\" would add anybody who has ever seen a psychic phenomena almost single handedly destroy a party. \nRoll on the psychic phenomena: 80. Perils of the warp. \nNow it gets interesting, I say to myself, rolling on the table: Ethereal Storm. Everybody and everything on board takes 1D10 damages that ignore armor. \nA few zapping later, I roll on the truck, slightly damaging it... but I'm not done. \nRoll on the NUKE: 10 damages. \n\"Uh oh.\" says the Magos with the aplomb typical of the Mechanicus members. \"Looks like the bomb timer is running.\"\n\nYASFI at this point: 200. They are running through the desert, climbing and sliding down dunes while almost literally riding a live nuke that is going to explode soon. And yeah, a whole kult of speed is still at their toes (and Manfred is still driving). \n\nThe Interrogator, banging his head against the hardest thing he can find with the rythm of a jackhammer, orders the magos to defuse that shit, and do it quickly. Meanwhile, the top of the dune approaches quickly, so I ask Manfred how does he want to manage it: maybe slowing down and try to go down the other side smoothly, or maybe to run parallel to the edge to take a look down the other sid-\n\"I speed up and go for the jump!!\" he typescreams on the forum. \nSo be it. The truck flies in the air, the Dixie Horn blowing loud in my mind will I roll for the driving test required to General Lee a missile transport truck on a dune during a battle. It doesn't perform well. \nNow, according to rule book and common sense I should have made them crash hard on their tracks... but that would have been unsatisfying. I mean, come on, what a shitty way to end a chase.\nSo I come up with something as bad as a crash, but more entertaining: the landing busts the suspensions (making all the test required to drive up or down the hills harder), and the missile cracks, starting sprinkling pressurized highly flammable rocket fuel like a geyser. If you have ever seen a missile launch mishap on youtube, you'd know that given the situation it is no less dangerous than the live nuke. \n\nYASFI now: 400. Driving through a desert with Manfred in full Dukes of Hazard mood on a live nuclear missile that is going to explode in not one, but two different ways, and it is going to do it soon while a whole army of adrenaline addicted alien hooligans is chasing you and home made gyrocopters are actively trying to decapitate you. \n\nThe orks start boarding the truck, and the passengers get ready for the fight while the biomancer tries to heal herself with seal wounds. \nThe good news is that she succeeds; the awesome news is that she rolls another 9, that quickly turns in the long waited peril of the warp. \nI roll Dark Summoning: a demon appears out of thin air 10 meters away, hellbent to kill the psyker that disturbed him. Now, being the whole group on a speeding truck, the options are two: either a very confused plaguebearer find itself stranded in the middle of the desert, lookin in frustration at the rapidly moving away vehicle, or I spawn something capable of flight.\n\nYASFI at the moment: 666. Zooming through the desert on a live double bomb truck driven by Manfred Von Richtofen, Herald of Gork and Mork that is PARALYZED BY FEAR at the sight of the demon, riding a soon to be exploding nuclear missile bomb (cit.) that is enthusiastically leaking rocket fuel while being boarded by a dozen of orks that (given half the defenders failed the willpower test and are literally running and screaming around the missile) are getting the upper hand on an order yelling, on verge of tears-ing Interrogator that is wondering what did he do to deserve all of this. Meanwhile, the green hooligans are still on the chase, with deffkopta buzzing around now accompained by a screamer of Tzeentch (A.k.a. giant tusked flying manta, armed with fangs hard enough to dig through a starship hull) that is currently busy at diving head first in the windshield to kill the psyker, who of course is to be found very close to the driver. \n\nI don't know how it is going to end, but it is going to be fucking epic. \n",

        "text": "So, for the last couple of months before my departure to college, I was involved in a game of Demon with one of the [Glorious Chucklefucks](https://i.imgur.com/DGeXclH.jpg) and some of my other friends. As [mentioned previously,](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3bsudp/demon_the_fallen_in_which_fallen_angels_kill_nazis/) this campaign was set in the midst of World War II and involved us, a bunch of fallen angels, killing Nazis. The climax of this campaign featured an assault on the castle of Heinrich Himmler and his demonic allies. Our GM planned for us to do some kind of stealthy infiltration type deal, but I had other ideas:\n\nMy character, in his angelic form, was about the size of a house, made of steel, and had wings. He was also immune to fall damage. When I told my fellow players the plan, they were so fucking on board. What could go wrong?\n\nWe approached the castle at night and were initially dismayed to find it protected by several AA guns and zeppelins floating overhead. Anduriel's giant metal ass would be shot down before it could reach enough altitude to do any damage. With a little planning and a wee bit of magical tampering with the physiology of an already heavily modified giant snake, we devised a backup plan: Zvaid, winged but not massive in his angelic form and the color of the night sky, would fly Anduriel in his human form up above the castle, aided by a massive, highly intelligent snake named Bear, which had just been given wings. Even if someone did manage to see them, the fuck were they going to say? \"Uh, sir? I think I just saw an angel of death and a flying snake carrying a guy out there.\" The plan was fucking foolproof.\n\nThe ascent went smoothly, and Anduriel was lifted over the castle at a height from which he could reach terminal velocity before impact. A wrinkle formed in the plan when some kind of fucking bird-thing burst out of a nearby zeppelin and moved to engage, but by that point all Zvaid and Bear had to do was let go. Bombs away motherfucker. There was some concern around the table, however, when my first roll to shift into angelic form failed. You ever see that Hulk movie where Banner jumps out of the helicopter, hoping to transform into the Hulk, and he can't do it? The \"oh shit\" look on his face? Yeah, that was Anduriel right then. GM let me make one more roll, at the cost of a permanent reduction in willpower, before splattering across the roof of the castle.\n\nPrayers were said to the dice gods. I rolled. Aleaiactaest.jpg. \n\nI fucking did it.\n\nA ten foot tall steel titan crashed through the ceiling of Himmler's castle and royally fucked that shit up. Chaos and pandemonium, compounded by Zvaid and Bear fighting the demon bird overhead and the rest of our crew moving in to attack at the same time. Things were going pretty alright, but then the Balrog showed up. Not exactly a Tolkien Balrog, but a pissed off fiery demon that looked a hell of a lot like one and had designs on my insides. The battle ended inconclusively, as after Jeff met up with the Big Bad and he gave his \"come over to the dark side\" speech, we actually ended up joining the enemies' side. \n\nDespite that, the metal as fuck image of a ten foot tall steel angel with claws fighting a Balrog in the burning ruins of a castle is one of my favorite moments as an RPG player. That and the time I leveled a city to kill a giant death cube in my first ever D&amp;D campaign, but that is another story entirely...",

        "text": "[Continuing an eclectic tale](https://redd.it/3cvrih) of some wasteland warriors trying to find a place for themselves in the post-apocalyptic ~~modern Utah~~ gulf of mexico, where water is so scarce that people brush their teeth with piss, just like the Romans! Our warriors have gotten onto the good side of the local constabulary and self-appointed billionaire Big J, who kept everyone that he didn't like in perpetual slavery so that he could live fat and happy (so yeah, modern Utah).\n\nOur \"heroes\" are these:  \n\n* Fracture the battle babe, decked out in spikes and general hurty things, who will break your fingers given any provocation.  \n* Boris the juggernaut, walking wall of meat and armor. Demeanor of a teddy bear, but with an LMG.  \n* Honest Ed, savvyhead, repair guy and the one who pays attention, but sleazy as fuck. (My character)  \n* Cherry the skinner, AKA supergimpette.\n\nOur guys were settling down after a big old hoo-hah about some bounty they had just collected from one Iron Wang and his personal fan club. But, as it turned out, that weren't the end of it! The man's... erm, chutzpah, had inspired quite a following of people who were fed up with being forced into slavery. Said fan club had promptly broken Iron Wang out of the slammer. The party was dispatched to a nearby encampment where some sympathizers were holed up, and we were to get some information on just where the fuck our bounty was, and also if we could get paid for bringing the idiot in twice.\n\nCherry, who had been absent until she had physically mailed herself into our little hold, decided that this was her area of expertise. Namely, the guy we were going to interrogate was asleep inside, and there were two guards covering him. Two MALE guards. So she and Fracture made some good rolls and took the guys away for a little... ahem, closer inspection. This left Boris and Ed free to do stuff. Ed quickly told Boris that he would be the walking Plan B, and set off himself to do sneaky shit.\n\nEd rolled. And then rolled some more. And then a few more rolls. What he ended up managing to do, before the dice gods decided to stop favoring him, was sneak into the tent undetected, scout everything, steal everything of value, make several return trips with the loot, sneak back in, and then wire up the sleeping target's jollies to a car battery without waking him up. Our prisoner, once *pressure* was applied, decided to cooperate and spill all of the beans. Boris couldn't decide if he was disappointed because he wasn't useful, or glad because nobody was (permanently) hurt.\n\nThus, the party discovered that Iron Wang and his cronies would be mounting a massive assault on the little hold, with the idea of freeing all the slaves and murdering our \"beloved\" \"leader\" Big J. The party came down on Big J's side, because they had nice things and didn't want a bunch of hooligans setting fire to it all in the name of class equality. Thus, we were roped into meeting the charging horde head-on!\n\nAnd speaking of roped, Cherry the supergimpette quickly dissolved that whole Mad Max style mess with the tactical removal of a few key... coverings. Both forces had to stop shooting the hell out of each other to pay attention to the spectacle. This allowed for us to come to a more reasonable understanding! Iron Wang himself agreed to a trial by combat, wherein him and one buddy would take on our toughest bastards. Which just happened to be Fracture and Boris. This led to a harrowing bout of hand-to-hand combat, where Boris and Fracture decided to cheese things, gang up on one opponent, and curb-stomp the other afterwards. It was just about the only reason they were winning, as the dice were coming down much in favor of Boris getting beat to shit and Fracture getting nearly disemboweled with a chainsaw. The situation devolved even further when Big J got bored and opened fire on the enemy forces while the duel was going on. This pissed off pretty much everyone, but Iron Wang couldn't keep that indignation going long because, after he downed Fracture with a nasty chainsaw swing, Boris drew a gun and shot him in the face.\n\nEd, who was watching all of this with dawning horror (\"He broke the deal! Big J made me a liar!\"), decided to lend a medical hand by way of strapping Fracture to a motorcylce and racing off towards his shop, which, incidentally, was far away from the shooting. He barely made it in time, and patched Fracture right up, averting what may have been a fatal injury by way of arc-welding some metal to her skull. Oh, and the other two were fine, they just sat on the sidelines of the battle and ate popcorn while our forces slaughtered the renegades.\n\nThus, peace came once more to our little hold, and our party was very firmly put on the up-and-up with Big J and his gang of yes-men. Good for us, right? Big J even showed us his little secret, the watering hole filled to the brim with nasty, undrinkable water. So how could it support the town? By pumping all that horseshit through a water filter, of course! For which there was no backup, and Big J held exclusive access. Honest Ed nearly choked on suppressed Tech Guy rage, and immediately offered to construct a new filter NOW oh god, what if something happens?\n\nAll that paranoia turned out to be completely justified when Big J turned up dead about a week later. NEVER DOUBT THE TECH. The new water filter was nearly half-done, but the Hold now had bigger problems. Big J's yes-men had dissolved into infighting and leadership squabbles, and everyone had neglected an important problem: That of pissed-off slaves who still had a few friends waiting to spring them. An incredibly bloody People's Revolution was started, burning damn near everything that Big J once held dear. And spoiler alert, the party fell into that category.\n\nEveryone started furiously trying to un-fuck the situation, with very few people (other than Boris) worrying about civilian casualties rather than opportunities for takeover. Honest Ed pointed out that, hey, we have a water filter, and everyone else doesn't. We don't have to do shit, we just need to sit on that filter until the fighting stops and make a deal with the survivors. But, unfortunately, there was an entire town filled with rioting between the party and that damn filter. Oh, and unsatisfied customers with pitchforks. Well, when it rains, it pours, eh? But thankfully, Honest Ed was incredibly adept at dodging angry customers, so that only left the occasional rioter and dying civilian. Man, it would have gone so much faster if everyone else hadn't immediately stopped to help the dying people.\n\nBut, Ed wasn't about to argue morals with three well-armed people, so he put up with their insistence to perform major brain surgery on people they sorta didn't want to die. Anything to get people moving towards the damn filter. Ed appropriated Boris to actually secure the shop while Fracture and Cherry tended the wounded and got them ready to transport. But, problem, Ed's shop was now under rioter control. A couple of SPESS MAHREENS were stationed outside of it, and when Ed asked them why they were there, they shot him. Some people can be so rude. But thankfully, the shot was a critical misfire, and the gun fucking exploded in the asshole's hands, knocking both him and Ed into unconsciousness. That left Boris trying to take down the other one.\n\nThe rolls were not with Boris that day. He took wound after wound, while only managing to hamper and inconvenience his opponent, who was armed with another goddamned grenade launcher. Boris was blasted into some little tent-home, and when the SPESS MAHREEN moved in for the kill, Boris lashed out with the first object that came to hand- an entire goddamned oven. *LOOKS LIKE HIS GOOSE WAS COOKED!* **WHAM**\n\nThus, the party regrouped in Ed's shop, with the wounded stabilized and stuff. When one of the ungrateful patients decided to stir things up with a hostile takeover, he ended up looking down the barrels of two guns and one LMG. He wisely decided that being useful and helping out was the better part of not being turned into a fine mist. Ed, having had nearly all of his attention arrested by all the medical stuff going on (as well as a concussion for himself), decided to prioritize this shit and get the filter working and ready to be evacuated at a moment's notice. Yeah, remember that filter? Pretty fucking important, guys, help me slap some armor around it in case something goes wro-\n\nAND THEN THINGS WENT WRONG. The rampaging former-slaves had somehow found themselves in possession of A FUCKING M1-ABRAMS TANK that liked to shoot first and ask questions **never**. This was discouraging for our little clinic (as well as the freshly-armored filter), and Ed promptly decided that this was high on his list of NOPES and he would be LEAVING NOW good DAY sir. By the way, if any of you live, I've also got the water filter so try not to die but we've pretty much won already and they don't know it yet.\n\nBoris was just facing down his shrapnel-filled fate with the ever-present Fracture when Cherry decided this was her area of expertise once more. Thus, she pulled out a sequel to her previous work- Boobs of Surrender 2: The Boobening. The tank gunner promptly misfired a shell straight into the air, and hesitant negotiations began. Oddly, Boris was the one doing the talking, and his earnest insistence that all of this murdering and stuff was pointless was actually well-received by the bloodthirsty former slaves. Especially when it was pointed out that, hey, we have access to water and you don't.\n\nThus, Boris was able to talk out some form of deal while Cherry and Fracture bitched about getting sunburn and Ed was waiting to see if any bullets would be sent in his general direction. But Boris was doing quite well with negotiations, and the party was regarded as champions of common sense in a world of rampant testosterone-fueled idiocy. The former slaves were amenable to a new deal, where things would be a bit more democratic, but with Boris as the figurehead leader to smack people around when they started being stupid. The rest of the party was awarded largely worthless honorary titles, which were appreciated anyway, because it meant that everyone could go back to doing useful things instead of dealing with the threat of imminent death.\n\nFade out as Ed gets into a heated argument about whether his customer's hot rod really NEEDED that gold filigree, Fracture drags some scumbag in for a bounty, Cherry plays \"jailer\", and Boris plays with a puppy.",

        "text": "Batten down the hatches, make peace with your gods, and prepare for an epic tale of incompetence and badassery.\n\nWhen playing dwarf fortress, I make a habit of periodically retiring my fortress to spawn an adventurer from there, have an adventure and come back to settle down. Not only do they make for great carvings, but I get the benefit of unstoppable demigods mining out everything in sight. This is usually worth the several weeks of lost fortress-time, however, it has come back to bite me a few times. For instance, in my newest fort, I realized that I was incredibly close to a necromancer's tower, so of course when it came time to (temporarily) retire my fort and create an adventurer, I went straight to the tower and stole not only the slab (which weighed a truly ridiculous amount), and all of the books, figuring that they'd be useful SOMEHOW. \n\nI brought all this loot back (but not before reading the slab and learning the secrets of life and death), dropped in in the middle of my fortress, and promptly retired. Retaking control of my fortress, I find that my new semi-divine citizen was doing quite well, and installed as captain of the guard. Things seemed to be going well. \n\nThat alone should have tipped me off.\n\nWhen I next made an adventurer (planning on having them be a kickass diplomat), the other shoe dropped. My (up until now) 'harmless' necromancer captain had gotten into the butchers shop and reanimated EVERYTHING.\n\nThe bastard.\n\nI actually managed to kill three of the various body parts gone bad, but after sustaining serious wounds from the fourth, turned to the only thing I could think of. \n\nIf Necromancy was what got me into this problem, by god it's was going to get me out of it. (becoming a Necromancer automatically doubles all stats). \n\nAfter the (epic) battle was done, I retired the adventurer without even leaving the fort, not willing to try my luck farther,and decided two things. One, that my dwarves were going to live a vegan lifestyle from here on out, and that B: I was done with making adventurers.\n\nOf course, that didn't help in the slightest.\n\nWhen the next wave of (filthy, useless, etc.) migrants arrived, I noticed something... off. People were being found dead, drained of blood. After a quick wikiwalk, I knew exactly what was going on. \n\nVampires.\n\nAfter a bit of detective work, I figured out who the vampire was, and (sensing opportunity), created a special unit, consisting of the vampire and the necromantic wonder-twins. After infecting the twins with vampirism (via a tainted watersupply and patience) I dug out a new section of the fort just for the three, giving each of the three gracious accommodations, with golden trinkets, gems, and beautifully carved statues. \n\nThen sealed it off, both from the outside world and the rest of the fort, never to open again.\n\nThese three, unaging dwarves, not needing to eat, drink, or even breathe, would theoretically live forever, insuring my fortress's immortality (as the fort only ends when the ~~fat lady sings~~ last dwarf dies).\n\n_________\n\nSpoilers to from here on out\n\n_________\n\nI left the three to their business, and got back to (mis)managing my fort. As it turns out, I didn't have long left before \n\n In the end, the general populace met their abrupt end when I accidentally pierced a hollow vein of adamantine, releasing untold hordes of bloodthirsty demons who went through my fortress like a chainsaw through a toddler. I managed to collapse the section of the fort that held the demons, but at the cost of my last mortal dwarf.\n\nI figured that while this may be a temporary setback, at least I have the three backup dwarves, all immortal, all needing a drink.\n\nSadly, they were in absolutely no condition to work. Their clothes had long since rotted away (slowly degrading their mental stability), the screams of ghosts kept them from sleeping, as well as sending them into depressive cycles, and then, to make matters worse, one of them (The vampire, if I remember correctly) was caught by a fey mood. \n\n[A fey mood is when a dwarf is taken over by an unceasing compulsion to create an artifact; if this desire is not sated, they will go mad.]\n\n\nThis didn't end well.\n\nDriven mad by the combination of undead screams, bodies littering the floor, and the inability to find silk,  the three dwarves went insane, one by one.\n\nNow I'm left with a smoking ruin of a fort, sealed from the world, filled with the screams of the dead, the miasma-choked halls patrolled endlessly by three immortal dwarves, all long gone insane.\n\n\n\nNeedless to say, I consider this fort a resounding success.\n\n",

He took a throwing dagger, aimed, and rolled a natural 1.  I ruled that he had to roll to hit the innkeepers daughter.  Natural 20.

[Try sleeping in a dungeon](https://redd.it/3iflv2) filled with shades, those godawful creatures that lurk in your shadow and reach up to eat your soul when you're not looking. And not only that, but dozens of undead abominations running around trying to find ways to kill you. Oh, and if THAT'S not bad enough, how about the cabal of undead wizards in the other room that won't stop chanting magic rituals? Go on, knock on the door and tell them to shut up, they'll just hit you with a silence spell and get straight back to it. Seriously, if there's a worse place to spend the night, it'd probably have to be in the more fiery portions of hell.\n\n[The Buster Squad](http://imgur.com/a/uBYvL) was not well-rested. They were not chipper morning people, either. They were adventurers. Big, pissed-off adventurers. Pratena the punchy cyclops was itching to turn some abominations into a fine mist, like she'd done when she opened up the broom closet to find an evil shapeshifting broom that turned into a perfect double of Pratena herself. So the real Pratena punched its face off. Rose the dullahan ranger had a deathly fear of the undead, so this whole place was her personal hell. Barrel the halfling rogue was having his paranoia driven up way past 11, and only fell asleep when his subconscious decided enough was enough and smashed his brain into unconsciousness with a metaphorical ACME anvil. Thoth the shabti magus, meanwhile, was experimenting with teleportation and plane-shifting and had found himself once again careening through dimensions like an extraplanar superball. TokenHuman the druidic healbot was somehow WORSE, with his enthusiasm making everyone else that much eager to get the everloving fuck out of here.\n\nThe first few routes they tried led to horrible spidery abominations, and others led to the pissy ghost-wizard cabal. This exploration was costing them, as Pratena was playing front-woman and kept getting bitten and slapped with nasty statuses. But that was nuthin' compared to the party stumbling upon ANOTHER goddamned duplicate of Rose! Seriously, that shit was getting old. Why was it always the shadowy evil clones?\n\nThis particular AlterRose was standing through a doorway, mocking the party and generally giving off an air of villainous COME AT ME BRO. Nobody was particularly eager to charge, as Rose (and by extension her doppelganger) both had an armor class of \"Hahaha NO\". But the mockery didn't stop, and started taking a personal turn, with AlterRose making specific death-threats about the party's family and friends. Seems like the evil shade-clones were all running on the \"kill and replace\" strategy of hero disposal, hoping to subsume the memories and physical forms of the party for their own nefarious bullshit agenda. To nail this home, AlterRose popped open her evil shadowy breastplate onto something particularly traumatizing: the horrible, desecrated corpse of [Rose's former self, before the whole dullahan thing happened](https://redd.it/314rwc). This was NOT okay. This was SO NOT OKAY. On a scale of 1 to NOPE, this was HOLY FUCK NOPE NOPE NOPE. TokenHuman came to the rescue, calming Rose by sharing the age-old wisdom of Druids everywhere: \"KILL IT WITH FIRE.\" And with that, TokenHuman turned their horrible verbal assailant into a pillar of holy immolation, courtesy of one Wall Of Flames spell. It's good to be the druid.\n\nWith the obvious ambush utterly fucking ruined, the party set about figuring out just what the hell they were going to do next. They still had no idea where the hell they were supposed to be heading, or what exactly they should be murdering. Like, specifically. Practically everything in the place needed murdering, but there was probably like one guy that needed it more than anyone else. And the party didn't really feel like trudging through more horrible spiders, doppelganger assholes and other such tomfoolery. So, they decided to change the game! They sat around and did nothing, on the logic that the if they couldn't go to the plot, they'd make the plot come to them!\n\n&gt; DM: Hey! No metagaming!\n\nBut anyway, Pratena was banged up and needed like an hour of rest so they found a nice little hallway and started fortifying it. And by fortifying it, they meant stationing Rose at one end and Barrel at the other, with the orders to murderize the fuck out of anything that popped up. And, true to form, stuff DID pop up! More shadowy assholes, this time in the flavor of highly-specialized fighters! A couple of armor dudes that moved and acted like complete fucking tanks, and some really hard-hitting punchy bastards hiding behind them. It was a siege!\n\nThe party, quickly discovering that the armored tanks were nigh-impossible to kill but not good damage-dealers, decided to go the obvious route and blast the punchy assholes before they could smack the party around. TokenHuman called lightning on their asses, Rose stalled the advance of the armored dudes, and Barrel nipped behind them and attacked the vulnerable punchy dudes before bad stuff could happen. This just left the nearly-invincible armored guys, who were CHARGING STRAIGHT TOWARDS THE CASTERS OH SHIT! TokenHuman was promptly grabbed and put in a full nelson by Captain Indestructopants the shadowy armor dude. But, key detail that Indestructopants didn't take into account, he was now smack in the middle of the irate party with no backup and, this is important, NO MEANS OF ACTUALLY DAMAGING HIS PRISONER. It was awkward.\n\nAround this time, Pratena woke up from her little nap to ask what the hell was going on and why TokenHuman was furiously trying to tap out of a badass wrestling move performed by some shadowy monster dude that looked a lot like Rose. Not having any other really appealing options, the party just sat and listened while Pratena and Captain Indestructopants had an awkward conversation punctuated by complaints from TokenHuman. Turns out that a whole bunch of shades had taken incomplete forms of the party, each with different specialties. Like the punchy guys that hit like Pratena but died in a single hit. And the armor dudes that were nearly invincible but couldn't deal damage worth a damn, just like Rose.\n\n&gt; Rose: I TAKE OFFENSE!\n\nBut anyway, Captain Indestructopants was just following horrible shadow monster orders and couldn't return without either getting destroyed in the process of capturing the party, or actually capturing the party. Pratena asked about the whole business, and found out that not all of these Shades were utter assholes. Captain Indestructopants was actually a bro. A Shadebro, who might've eaten souls of living creatures but he wouldn't eat yours 'cause he's your bro. And he was just being pushed around by less bro-ish shades, including a horrible mass of shades that was obsessed with stealing the identities of living creatures and generally fucking things up for everything alive. Which, as it happened, sounded like the exact thing that the party needed to murder, and that Shadebro was ordered to take them to. Thus, a BRILLIANT SCHEME was hatched- follow Captain Indestructobro to the horrible shadowy abomination, then murder it. As an added bonues, being escorted meant not having to fight any more doppelgangers, horrible spider monsters, or even other shadebros!\n\nBut now, the party had to ask itself: What do a bunch of evil black blobs with gleaming red eyes make when they get into a big old group and try to kill you? Well, probably some sort of [miraculous](https://youtu.be/ssj1OS-tbXI) [mass](http://kirby.wikia.com/wiki/Miracle_Matter)! Specifically, a pale white creature resembling a 20-sided die, with each face having a gleaming red eye of pure malevolence! Oh, and it would probably transform into nasty things! But thankfully it was probably something completely different hahaha no they were totally fighting a ripoff of the Kirby 64 boss.\n\nFirst round went rather poorly, with Barrel jumping the gun and throwing a powerful alchemical bomb at the Mass, which rebounded and struck TokenHuman instead (whoops). Then, the party was taken by complete surprise when the thing turned into a huge mass of spikes, impaling pretty much everyone in the room, but ESPECIALLY Pratena who had wandered in for a closer look. When they mustered up enough brain cells to mount a counterattack that actually worked, the thing had changed back into its d20 form. Fucker!\n\nThis devolved into a slapfest, with the horrible mass changing into all sorts of lovely forms, smashing the party with rocks and slicing up Rose's defenses like they were paper, until the party rallied and got into the rhythm of taking down each form as it appeared- naturally, with the exact sort of attacks it was employing against the party. It was a long battle, though, with everyone getting roughed up, but ESPECIALLY TokenHuman and Pratena (who both failed some rather important saves). And all this was on top of several flunkies that burst in to make things more interesting during the down-time. Thankfully, TokenHuman WAS the healer, and he managed to keep everyone on their feet long enough to smash the last form right in its face. Oh, and then to keep everyone alive during its Shapeshifting Swan Song of more fucking spikes and lightning bolts. Cripes, that thing just would not go DOWN! But Barrel eventually got pissed and lashed out with an amazing dagger barrage, slicing the bastard neatly in half. Battle won!\n\nAnd then it exploded into a black hole. EVERYONE ROLL REFLEX!\n\nTo the DM's surprise, the entire party managed to keep their footing while the hole widened beneath them, drawing in every single shade and horrible shadow monster (which were also shades, by the way) into some sort of horrible amalgamation deep beneath the yawning pit at the party's feet. The battle clearly wasn't over just yet, and the party would have to take care of-\n\n&gt; Barrel: I make a bomb out of ALL of my alchemist's fire.\n\n&gt; DM: Uhh... how many do you have?\n\n&gt; Barrel: About 70. Oh, and all of my pellet grenades, fuse grenades, and acid bottles.\n\n&gt; Rose: And mine! I've got a couple of grenades and some sunrods! These creatures are weak against light, right?\n\n&gt; Pratena: I've got sunrods!\n\n&gt; TokenHuman: I'll contribute my sunrods.\n\n&gt; DM: Roll a craft check...\n\nAnd with that, the party decided that going into the horrible murderhole was stupid compared to the prospect of blowing it the fuck up. With everyone's help, they built the MOTHER of all bombs, wrapped it up in a nice pink bow, slapped a cheery note on it, lit the fuse, pushed it in and got the fuck into cover. The resulting explosion was more or less on the scale of intercontinental ballistic missiles, and whatever was in that pit was probably not having a good day. Neither was the dungeon that the party was currently occupying. Cave-in time! Unfortunately, the blast had incapacitated Thoth, who was the only one with teleportation magic, so the whole thing devolved into a frantic scramble not to be crushed or sucked into the murderhole while Thoth regained his senses. Several players nearly slipped (except for Barrel whose godlike reflex save meant that he could have done a dance routine on the lip of the hole without much trouble), but after a tense five rounds, Thoth was back in business and teleported the party out to the entrance!\n\nThe dungeon collapsed in front of them, as though a giant-sized Pratena had swung her mighty fist into the unsuspecting mountainside and thoroughly wrecked its shit. Welp, the shades were all probably dead or in another plane of existence or SOMETHING, so yeah! Victory for us guys! High fives all around and *why is the ground trembling*. OH FUCK THE RUBBLE'S SHIFTING, [A GIANT FUCKING SHARK](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/nightshade/nightwave) IS COMING OUT! RUN FOR YOUR FUCKING LIIIIIIIVES! Wait, there are tons of adventurers shooting the hell out of it, and aren't sharks supposed to have their organs on the *inside*? Aaaaand it's toppling over stRAIGHT ONTO US OH FOR FUCK'S SAKE\n\nPratena and TokenHuman reeled after one last humiliating pounding, courtesy of a mangled shark-monster made out of horrible shadow creatures, but they celebrated their victory nonetheless. This was the biggest shit the Buster Squad had ever done, and the organization that they worked for probably couldn't have handled it without their help. They were badasses. Maybe that wasn't, you know, saving the world, but it was damn close, and shit like that would be talked about for years. Speaking of, the party had several rather grievous broken bones and stuff, and they needed some down-time. And not the screw-around-doing-whatever downtime, but the downtime that you spend in traction for three months. Whatever, it's still a win, and everyone got paid to boot! Yeah, adventuring!\n\nNEXT TIME ON \"Shady shadow and the dusky darkness\", HERE THERE BE ASSHOLES AND YOU MEAN THERE REALLY WERE HEART-STARS?",

        "text": "So one of my players had a rather interesting idea for a vampire backstory. He wanted to be Pontius Pilate. I agreed, on the condition that he is no longer able to remember his Embrace, has spent a long time in torpor previous to the events on the game, and has never Embraced another person. He agreed.\n\nSo the party starts off the campaign trying to find a vampire who had recently arrived in the city but hadn't presented himself to the Prince. The Prince had some inside knowledge that this particular vampire just came out of torpor halfway across the world, and wasn't keen on calling a blood-hunt on a guy who may just be a bit out of it and didn't know the rules. So the party (a mage, a dark hero, a vampire and a changeling) head off to find this guy before the Prince has to call a blood-hunt on him.\n\nOur vampire, Pilate (under a different name, obviously), tries to Embrace another person. It doesn't work. It really should have - he did all the right things, but for some reason, he can't Embrace. No one is entirely sure why.\n\nIt takes them longer than expected to find their target - this vampire is *insanely* powerful and ridiculously good at keeping himself hidden. They figure he's Mekhet, and it looks like he has a mage helping him. So they wonder what he has to hide. Then they discover an entire ancient order of humans dedicated to protecting him and his coterie, and they have to wonder just what the fuck is going on here.\n\nSo eventually they find him. They realize, much to their great shock, that this particular vampire is somehow *also a mage*. \n\nAnd he greets Pilate as \"brother.\"\n\nThe party kind of freaks out at this, but Pilate doesn't have any idea what this guy's talking about *either* and insists he's never met this guy in his life (which is true).\n\nTheir target eventually explains that he is the progenitor of the Mekhet clan, a Mastigos from Atlantis who attempted to live through the Fall by gaining a twisted form of immortality developed by their cabal's Moros (who herself ended up becoming the progenitor Nosferatu). The entire clan is like this. And Pilate is the real, living Longinus, recognized by a fellow progenitor as the new father of a nameless clan.\n\nSuffice to say, the party didn't know how to react to that :)",

We dun goofed.\n\nSo the party is:\n\nOur leader, a Night Lord Chosen, (me) The Biologis Heretek, a fallen Salamander, a sex obsessed former Inquisitor and a World Eater Berzerker from the heresy.\n\nIf you want our other sitcom esque hijinks, check /u/telltalebot\n\nSo, after we invade a loyalist space station looking for things to run off with, we come into contact with a squad of Marines Malevolent. \n\n This goes well for us, mostly due to the inquisitor getting a perfect agility check and then beating the squad to death with the helmeted head and spine of their sergeant.\n\nNot long after we encounter a pair of Grey Knight terminators.\n\nFuck me running.\n\nSo two rounds in, i'm busy patching the Night Lord up after he eats a storm bolter burst. The salamander is returning fire, and the inquisitor is pinned down. \n\nBut our oh-so-loveable berzerker decides he has a better idea.\n\nHe has a special ability, being devoted to Khorne, that once per session he can boost his strength, and get one free perfect hit.( No roll required)\n\nOn top of this he can overload his armor, giving him more speed and toughness, at the expense of it shutting off after 5 rounds. \n\nSo what does he do? \n\nHe decides to activate both, and FUCKING KOOL-AID MAN RIGHT THROUGH THE GODDAMN WALL. \n\nObviously this catches the termies by surprise. One is stunned, and the other, well.....\n\nThe berzerker put, Strength of Khorne, Armor overload, Ancient power fist plus perfect hit(Five degrees of success) together for one uppercut on this Grey Knight.  \n\nThe grey knight gets hit so hard he punches through the ceiling like a giant dart. \n\nThe dm rolls a few dice. Looks at us. Looks back down. Looks at us again.

        "text": "Some background information-\n\nMe: 20-something warehouse employee, work 10 hours a day. I play the Slavic illegal-immigrant foreigner who became a bounty hunter clan captain and right-hand man to the local judge.\nMy brother: A few years younger, NEET. Plays a character who is also a Slavic illegal-immigrant foreigner who had a brief stint on the town guard and gained a reputation as being lazy and useless in and out of character.\nThe game: Located in the south, full-immersion, limb-based combat. Good times, but RIP. It was at the time located out of state and it was a 4 hour drive each way.\n\nIt's summer, I work in a warehouse that has no ventilation and requires standing next to machines that run up to 300 degrees for hours on end. It's a friday, and I just got done running a 10 hour shift. I come home and already have my things planned for the weekend, but I'm so tired from the heat and long work week, I'm ready to die. I just want to take the 4-hour nap on the way so I can fight some monsters and politic some plots.\n\nBrother refuses to drive. He has his learner's permit but refuses to drive. I try to make a deal where he only has to drive the first two hours (we literally get on the interstate and drive north for 4 hours) and then pull over to let me do the rest of the way. Refused. Refused any deal I offer until I refused to drive. He throws a fit, but finally agrees.\n\nIt's five minutes in the car, and we're about to pull onto the interstate, he's driving 10 minutes under the speed limit, every other lane is driving 10 over. Five minutes into the trip, he looks at the mirror, sees a car coming 20 mph faster than he is driving, swerves into oncoming traffic. We almost get rear-ended and I lose my shit and demand he pull over. I tell him I'm driving the rest of the way. Stone-faced, he shrugs and moves to the passenger seat and falls asleep. FUCK.\n\nWe arrive a few hours late into game and as I'm walking into play with my bag, another character runs up to me. \"Leopold!\" he shouts. \"Baron Dickhole is trying to kick out all of [my character's race]! He says because they're all illegal citizens they have to leave!\" FUCK. I'm not ready for this bullshit yet. I find Baron Dickhole and tell him that if he wants me to leave, he's going to have to get permission from my Judgebro. He gets nervous and starts babbling, saying that *I* don't have to leave, but the others do.\n\nAgainst my better judgement, I approach the others (My brother's character and another character who I'm friends with). I offer them a position within my mercenary company, knowing it's the only thing that will save them. They agree, but I make it very clear that they have to pull their weight or they're gone. They only get one chance. They agree, I offer them armbands with my company's insignia, and everything looks to be solved. \n\nBaron Dickhole approaches me to let me know that none of the town guard players have arrived to this magistrate session and says that he'll pay my company on behalf of the town to serve as the town guard. I agree and put my two new recruits on watch and appoint myself interim guard captain. That first night was when the bandits came.\n\nThe bandits came to the town twice that night. The first time they came to us as a group of completely unskilled and hopeless entertainers. They had a few instruments that none of them could play, they had no songs prepared, and one of them was a ludicrous mockery of a drag queen. I'm of course skeptical, but they look harmless and have done nothing wrong. After not a single player is willing to tip them (except for our priest, bless his heart), I escort them back to the edge of town and wish them luck in their future endeavors.\n\nThey sneak back in an hour later separately and hide in the shadows of night to try and steal from the PC's cabins and anything of value they had left around the fire and the tables. A few PCs noticed, alerted the guards, and the guards proved themselves to be useless once more as the PCs handled the bandits themselves, save for one.\n\nThe final bandit was a fat, short, hispanic guy with curly hair and no weapon. As one of the guards brought him to me, he had his hands up and gave me his defense, which amounted to (paraphrasing here) \"Please don't hurt me I'm a giant wiener and I didn't hurt anybody they made me go along with it\". The others verified that he didn't hurt anybody and I decided to vouch for him.\n\nThe Healer's Guild had their own cabin and the guild leader, a young woman I was close to in and out of character, said that she'd be willing to let him spend the night in the spare bunk in their cabin but required a town guard. I'm exhausted, so I delegate authority to my brother and tell him to watch the prisoner until court the next morning. He agrees and I head off to bed. \n\nCouldn't have been more than 30 minutes later, I'm awoken by my brother. \"L-Leopold, I can't do it I'm so tired I'm going to fall asleep.\" I look at him in equal parts rage and shock. I tell him he has one job if he wants to stay in this town, and then I break character to tell him I've been working and driving for the last 14 hours while he was home playing Minecraft with 12 year old boys. He insists he's going to fall asleep so I grumble and say I'm giong to deal with him in the morning.\n\nThe cabin is dark and there's a single lit candle, it puts me to sleep within 20 minutes. I jerk awake, exhausted, angry, bitter, and try to focus that into staying awake. I know there's no way this can last for the next 8 hours until daylight. I get up, leave the cabin and begin marching to awaken my brother once more to tell him to get over it and do his job or face exile. While I march, a couple of guys who are awake by the campfire call me over and offer to watch the cabin for me. I can't see their faces, I'm not sure who they are, but I'm so tired I don't care. I go back to sleep.\n\nMorning comes, and I awake to the Healer's Guildmistress standing over my bunk with crossed arms. \"Leopold, there were no guards in my cabin last night. We all had our weapons in the cabin with us, he could have murdered us all in our sleep and escaped.\" I curse and apologize to the woman and shake my had. \"I had told [my brother] to watch him last night. Useless as a town guard, useless as a mercenary.\"\n\nIt was a lie, but it was a lie nobody could possibly doubt. I'm a beloved figure in this town, a rugged, dashing Slavic lancer who's laid his life on the line for this town for two years. It was my word vs the word of a guard who's been known to run while the town was in danger. It was easy, and I didn't feel bad at all. I actually felt great. I threw my brother under the bus. The guildmistress warned me that it was our great friendship and history that she would not press charges against me, and only my brother. I thanked her for her mercy and resumed watch of the town.\n\nThe Judge shows up and we begin court. The first case up was of the bandit. I vouched for him as did others, the judge nodded and freed him, telling him to be more careful with the friends he selected. The second case was my brother's case. The charges were read by the judge, and my brother looks at me with this look of betrayal and shock. \"B-But he said that he would watch the bandit for me! It's not my fault!\" The judge turns to me. \n\n\"Leopold, is that true?\"\n\n\"Of course it's not true. This man's going to blame anybody he can for his failures.\"\n\nThe judge levies a fine against him for him to pay the guild dues for the healer's guild for the next twelve months. My brother looks pissed, glaring at me, and all I can do is smile and shake my head. *All you had to do was drive the fucking car* I think to myself.\n\nMuch to my surprise, another man stands up. \"Magistrate, I would like to press charges against this man as well.\" The man standing is the town's tax collector, he's holding a chest full of town taxes and the expenditure leger. \"Your honor, this man attempted to mug me this morning.\"\n\nWhere the hell did that come from? We all know that my brother was lazy, not violent. Even the judge questioned him. The tax collector went on to explain that apparently, my brother had attacked him earlier that morning on the road. Or rather, he had tried to, and was so inept that he was easily fought back with a simple hunter's knife and ran like a coward when he realized he could not win.\n\nWe all knew that this didn't happen. Nobody stepped up. He looked at me for help. I shook my head and widened my grin. *All you had to do was drive, asshole.* The judge sentences him to twelve years of indentured servitude and cited an old religious law that stated he needed to have his right ear removed for attempting to attack a government official.\n\nI escort him to the healer's guild where the procedure was done. As I bind his arms with rope and grab his arm to lead him to the guild, I lean into his ear and whisper. *\"All you had to do was drive the fucking car.\"*\n\nCall me a terrible brother, call me petty, call me whatever. I love my brother, it's just a game, and he didn't have to actually see any real punishment for his actions because he retired his character the next month and just ate the character point penalty for retiring a character. \n\nIt felt so good. Fuck your shit, just drive the fucking car.",

In the middle of the room the Navigator's chair is in tact, but not empty.\n\nFar from it.\n\nA creature so large, it's hard to imagine it once looked remotely human.  Its body swollen many times larger than a normal man's, its limbs plump and skin grey.  Where its face should be; only an eye, possibly having consumed all other features.  All except its terrible mouth, stretching low across the jaw line, slobbering profusely.  This horrific monstrosity would be enough, but it is not the only creature with us in the room.\n\nAs my eyes adjust to the light I make out many hanging skeletal corpses, dressed in rags, swinging from chains connected to the structural pillars.  These bodies, devoid of natural life, somehow still move on their own accord, their skulls turning as their jaws waggle, silently screaming.  From their mouths spew noxious gas, staining the air like oil on tarmac, surrounding the beastly Navigator as if empowering its undead form.\n\n\"You're not a cake!\"  Odette shouts angrily.  \"A challenge is it?!\"  She faces the monster head on, standing a few feet away.  \"How about a game of I Spy?!\"  Seeing her small, teenage frame stand up against the giant mass of flesh makes me thankful she did not drift off the asteroid.\n\nI spot my Lord firing at the beast as Odette engages it in psychic combat.  From in front of them, the skeletons start to shake violently, light glowing from their eye sockets.  Could this be some kind of attack?\n\nUnlucky for us, it seems so.  With barely enough time to react, the lights from the howling skeletons shoot into the air, combining into one bolt of lightning.  Quickly, I throw myself down the stairs out of harms way as several of the men are struck, the pure warp energy exploding their inners and spraying their blood along the germ ridden walls.  Zez is also caught, but thanks to her armour and tenacity survives to tell the tale.  More than that, in response I see her raise the bolt gun at her side, position the barrel over the edge of the stairs and unload rapidly at the bound horde.\n\nOver the comms I hear Odette yell more and more insults at the beast, despite its inability to hear her.  The unmistakeable ring of Court's hand cannon pierces the air along with the rattle of the other weapons, assuring me he is playing his part valiantly.\n\nAs for myself I stay in the shadows, pulling my Inferno pistol to my side.  Unlike my teammates I am not versed in deadly combat, so as a result I am much less willing to run into a room full of unspeakable horrors.  From my position it would be difficult to get a good shot at anything, and that would be the worst of it if I was confident in my ballistic capabilities.  Perhaps more time is needed in the firing range with Court, and less in the library for a change.\n\nPulling me back into reality, my Lord's voice calls through the micro bead.  \"Once more into the breach Kaleb!\"  Carefully I sneak up the stairs towards Zez, this time in cover, to catch a glimpse of what is happening.\n\nMy Lord is no longer wielding his lasgun but instead draws his power sword, charging the hulk of a Navigator into melee.  Blade pointed forwards, he thrusts his weapon straight into the stomach of the beast, clutching the hilt with both hands, twisting to slice the hulk open horizontally.  I marvel at my Lord's strength, as well as his idiotic disregard for his own safety.  The beast does not seem to react, locked in place by Odette, who is still standing her ground.  Court has positioned himself nearby taking out the skeletons one by one, while Zez from behind provides covering fire.  Truly, they are all a force to be reckoned with.  Sometimes I forget how powerful each of them are.\n\n\"Keep him steady Odette!\" My Lord calls, \"I'm going to make Sashimi out of this guy!\"\n\n\"I thought you said cake!?\" Odette argues, somehow able to speak in the midst of her own battle.\n\nMy teammates fight on as I contribute nothing.  I curse my own weakness.  Scanning the area I look for somewhere I could shoot from nearer, but no obvious place presents itself.  With my Lord so close to the monsters it would be risky to fire such a dangerous weapon.\n\nThere is only one other way I could try to help.  Ducking down once more I close my eyes, trying to picture the scene that lays above me.  I want to know - who is their next target?\n\nThe image springs to life in my mind, as if I was starring straight at it.  I notice the crew, the hulk and the crying skeletons, their eyes burning like before.  I see the same arch of energy, crashing down upon where Zez and I stand.\n\n\"Zez, move!\"  I slide out from my hiding spot and flee back down the stairs, further out of range.  Unfortunately, my vague and panicked instructions do very little to help our Explorator.  The hallway flashes for a second before the attack rains down, drawn to Zez as if she were a lightning rod.  I turn back watching her stagger on the stairs, the blast zapping her strength, but she refuses to give up.  Still, if this happens again, I doubt that even she could shake it off a third time.\n\nIt would be easier to warn them all if they knew about my 'abilities'.  Despite this, I must find a way to assist without giving myself away.  If I mention a warning too descript they might be suspicious of how I came to predict it.  As much as I want them to survive, I can't let it be at a risk to my own identity.\n\nThe last of Court's men hanging about seem to have lost their nerve, as they make their way past me running for the exit.  Cowards.  I would shoot them for their desertion if time wasn't of the essence.\n\nHolding onto the wall, I close my eyes and try again.  This time - this time I can help.  I just need to calm down and focus.  This is nothing.\n\nOnce again I call upon my visions for guidance.  The troubling sight of Odette reeling backward plays out before me, as the deadly beam from the remaining skeletons fires choosing a new target, this time striking my Lord.  I hear him shriek in agony, the cries reverberating around my head as I open my eyes and return to the present.\n\nThis is not good.\n\n\n[Start](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3dfr45/tales_from_a_seneschal_rogue_trader/) | [Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3i4hxx/rogue_trader_tales_from_a_seneschal_part_6/) | [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3jw78s/rogue_trader_tales_from_a_seneschal_part_8/) | [Last](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3kpswp/rogue_trader_tales_from_a_seneschal_part_9/)",

I'll still list them, because I love 'em.\n\n* Tar-Hal, the half-orc barbarian. Scary, as always.\n* Avi, the bard. Sweet, seductive, and a liar to boot. Don't play instruments, kids.\n* Krom, the half-elf rogue. About as subtle as an explosion.\n* Karl Tanner, the human cleric. He's a fookin' legend, that one.\n\n\nOur story begins on a dark and stormy nigh-\n\nNah, not really. It's much better than that. See, we had just pulled off a daring heist. The greatest theft in the history of the world as we knew it. Thanks to our intrepid bard's seductive abilities, some well placed magic conjured up by yours truly, and a heavy double-shovel carried by the scary half-orc, we had plundered and cleaned out the vault in the royal castle of Waystone. Right under the noses of the King and the two Princes!\n\nYou may ask why we undertook such a dangerous task. Well, we had some encouragement from one of the Princes, but that wasn't why. We didn't do it for the money!\n\nWe did it for a **SHIT-TON** of money!\n\nAnd we got a good haul too, besides coins. We tucked away magic items, some tapestries and paintings and cups looted from the royal guestrooms. And the hero of our story found a ring. Now, if it was a wedding ring or something I'm sure she would've chucked it in the gutter right then and there, but this was a special ring. A Ring of Wizardry.\n\nNow, once she realized what this was she slipped it right on. This is probably when I should've mentioned that we found it in a locked box in a locked cage, but I held my tongue. I know how she gets.\n\nAnyway, the ring goes onto her finger and we get out of the castle with our loot and hides intact, leaving nothing behind but dust and some dead guards we stuffed under a bed with another living one strapped naked on top of it.\n\nExeunt all, the curtain drops and rises on the next morning, where things really get interesting.\n\nThe next day, as is typical for the life of an adventurer, Lyria went to cast a spell. She said the words, built up the magic, put on her wizard hat and robe, made the gestures, and **POOF!** A pile of papers appeared!\n\nThe forms demanded that she fill out the following forms in order to cast the desired spell. In triplicate.\n\nShe furrowed her brow, and tried again, with a different spell. More paperwork. This was no ordinary ring. Something was wrong with it. And now we had a dilemma – what good's a spellcaster who has to wait in line every time she goes to fry some goblin brains?  So we hit on a plan to get the ring investigated at the Arcanum, where Lyria had been a student not too long ago. The rest of the party was off securing our transport out of town, and I graciously volunteered to accompany her on her errands and shopping until she could remedy the source of her magical incompetence. \n\nIt's a good thing looks can't kill!\n\nWe made our way to the magical academy. Now, I'd never been before. I learned my magic and my spells the good old-fashioned way: painfully. Trial and error. Here Lyria left me in the entrance hall and went off to find an old instructor, looking for guidance. It didn't take me long to develop a bit of a following among the student body, as I regaled them with tales of my heroic adventures while Lyria sat in some dusty room and figured out her problem before coming to find me. \n\nWhen I finally noticed her reappearance, looking rather impatient and upset that I had apparently been ignoring her for some time, she informed me that she had positively identified the ring as cursed! It was a Ring of Bureaucratic Wizardry, designed to control unruly spellcasters. Obviously, we needed this item uncursed, and the best person to do that was a local cleric. Any would do, of course.\n\nUnfortunately, this is the capital of the goody-two-shoes. And the only religion in Goody-Two-Shoe Town was the religion of Heironyus, as represented by a suitably ornate cathedral. Now, we hang out a lot in the city of Tedrille, ruled by the Prince who helped us rob the castle. They worship a less noble god named Hextor. Who happens to be Heironyus' brother. They hate each other. I don't know the full story, you'd have to ask one of them, but I gathered that the mutual hate extended to their worshipers as well. \n\nNow, nobody wants to be seen going into a temple of their god's most hated enemy, and although we didn't worship Hextor we knew that the Prince we worked for did. So Lyria, taking the time to diligently fill out the paperwork, cast a disguising spell, and told me to wait down the street while she got her little problem taken care of. She heads into the Temple of Heironyus as an elven woman, with long blonde hair.\n\nSo, she goes into the cathedral. Seeing this place from the outside, I can only imagine how pompous it must've been on the inside. Peaceful worshipers, quiet prayer circles, white marble and white robes as far as the eye can see. It's enough to make you sick, isn't it?\n\nAnyway, she goes and talks to the Priest. And right off the bat, she starts dropping lies. Lying about her name, her purpose, her hometown. Trying to cover it all up, you know? She doesn't want any trouble, she just wants this ring uncursed and no she won't tell you where she got it she just found it thank you very much just please cast the da- cast the spell, would you kindly?\n\nNow this old priest isn't buying it. He's getting pretty suspicious of this strange elven woman. So he asks her,\n\n&gt;“Have you heard anything about Heironyus?”\n\nAnd Lyria responds.\n\n&gt;“Of course, I know all about Hextor.”\n\nNow, the priest's eyes go wide as dinner plates. You can basically read what's going through his mind. Something like Oh holy shit I'm talking to a demon! Or Oh my god is she about to eat my soul? Well, you can't blame him after a gaffe like that.\n\nBut this brave old man invites her to pray with him. Lyria, fighting back the urge to roll her eyes, I'm sure, kneels and closes her eyes to pray.\n\nAnd when she opens them, the priest dumps a bucket of holy water into her face and loudly proclaims, \n\n&gt;**“BEGONE DEMONESS! BEGONE SUCCUBUS!”** \n\nas he chats and waves about a holy symbol. People scream, or stare, and clergy stop in their tracks to watch the exorcism unfold.\n\nNow, Lyria is of course no demon. And the water she just had poured on her face was less acidic death, and more stunned humiliation. Realizing the error he just made, the priest apologizes, casts some dispel magic, and after a short discussion in which the perils of lying – and lying badly at that – are mentioned, removes the curse from the ring. Lyria takes it off her finger, and pockets it. Then she leaves, as quickly as she possibly can. When she meets up with me, she's still dripping wet and shocked and humiliated. \n\nNow, I may be a colossal asshole sometimes, but I'd be lying if I didn't want to go and show that priest what for. He didn't even offer to dry her clothes. It was just rude. I helped her clean up, waved my fingers and dried her clothes, and we met up with the party and agreed to never speak of it again. Now, you said something about another round if I told you anyways, right?",

        "text": "So I used to play Wargame ALB with one of my friends all the time, technically I still do but we've moved onto Wargame: Red Dragon which is pretty different. Anyways we were doing a 2v4 against bots as we do, he found himself a nice defensible position for his infantry and my tanks got what was left. He holed himself up in a decent sized town in a valley, with the mountains effectively leaving the enemy only two routes of attack and my friend with only one avenue of retreat, the terrain didn't deter them though, 4 Soviet regiments descended upon his position in full force. Now in addition to my tanks I also had a lot of aircraft on standby, EF-111 Ravens, A-10 Warthogs, F-15 Strike Eagles, and F-111 Aardvarks, but I wasn't keen on sending any of them in because of enemy AA, we didn't know where it was and what it was, and sending in planes without that info was dangerous, so I gradually stopped paying attention to the game at all, browsing reddit on my phone instead. This continued for a few minutes with my friend growing increasingly panicked about his line's gradual collapse under all the communist armor until he finally yelled at me over comms \"Broken Arrow.\"\n\nThis was my moment, I knew exactly what I had to do, and every plane I had lying around was given a target within 30 seconds, AA be damned. It was a sight to see, for nearly 10 minutes straight the USAF bombed anything that looked even moderately marxist with utter impunity, the lulls in the bombing serving only to allow fresh targets to advance forward. I don't recall what he and his infantry did while the skies expressed their displeasure with the very concept of communism, I was in the zone, all I paid attention to was coordinating those air strikes, even when we ran out of targets the bombs never stopped, planes dropped them into the graveyard of tanks we'd created if we couldn't find anything moving, we kept up a constant screen of bombing runs around the town for the entire remaining duration of the battle.\n\nWith all that firepower coming down on anything and everything outside the town, it didn't take long for the battle to reach an end along with all of the Soviet vehicles and soldiers. Me and him still talk about the time he called in a broken arrow sometimes.",

        "text": "This tale will be a long one, so strap in.\n\nEver since I first played it shortly after release, I've loved Skyrim. It is one of the definitive RPGs of our time. From the combat to the story and breathtaking lands, I've loved Skyrim. But the lands aren't always breathtaking in a good way.\n\nNow, this happened about a year ago, roughly two years after Skyrim's release and about the time all the add-ons came to PS3 (finally). I decided to start a new character and play through the DLC, starting with Dawnguard. By the time I got started, I was roughly level 30 and pretty confident as a character. \n\nThere's a few things that are important about my character. 1) I rely heavily on magic to initiate combat as well as kite tougher enemies. This means that I steal every goddamned Magicka potion I come across. 2) I'm a Mage but I'm tanky. I wear heavy armor and I need it if I'm going to have a sword in one hand and flinging spells in the other. So, just like Magicka potions I steal every Health potion I can. 3) I steal cabbages. Every last one. No reason. Just do.\n\nOn to the story, I had just been sent as an envoy to Castle Volkihar and this meant a LONG trip for me.\n\nWith this character I hadn't really spent much time in western Skyrim, messing around mostly in Riften and Winterhold for their Guild lines. What few places the took me in west Skyrim were still a ways away from the castle and I wasn't taking a carriage to Markarth because fuck that place. My only option was to walk all the way to the frozen wastes.\n\nMy mind made up, my potions stocked and a metric shit ton of cabbages in my pack, I set off in a vague westerly direction.\n\nThose of you familiar with Skyrim's geography know what lay before me. Between me and my destination rose the Throat of The Worlds.\n\nKnowing what a pain in the ass it would be to go around I decided to just scale the steps, Become Ethereal and jump down the other side. \n\nHowever, as I said before I set off in a VAGUE westerly direction and found myself a fair ways south of Ivarstead. I was before a watchtower, with a few stray bandits and a mid-level Dragon. Carving my way up the tower I toppled the dragon and touched the Word Wall there for a new Shout. My new power found, I looked around.\n\nStrangely enough, before me lay a frozen pass through the mountains. \n\nThis was new to me, as I had never known a pass to be here, and I'd been playing for a few years. \n\nPulling up my map, the pass seemed to run through to a place close to Helgen and seemed to be rather shallow, with no real climbing readily apparent.\n\nForging my way through the rock and snow, I came upon a crumbling Draugr ruin. I brought up my map. \n\nArcwind Point.\n\nIf you've ever had the misfortune to traverse the mountains this way, you know what lies in store for me. If you've been so lucky as to never find this place, praise be to Talos.\n\nStowing my map I walked down towards the broken archway in the center of the ruin.\n\nAs I did, my map lit up with red markers. At least ten. Glancing upwards at the ledges around me I noticed several high-level Draugr (Scourges and Wights) and no less than three Deathlords and a Death Overlord. \n\nOh fuck, this was going to suck. \n\nI drew my sword and equipped Incinerate. This was going to be shitty, but at least I had heavy Fire damage going for me. \n\nAnd then I heard the roars. \n\nYou have to be fucking kidding me!\n\nSpinning about quickly, the encroaching Draugr behind me, I cast my screen skyward. \n\nNot one but two markers were there, and I could see the source of one of them. \n\nBefore me rose an Elder Dragon. At my level, this was very rough but doable. I had potions and a decent skill in Restoration. The Draugr would definitely complicate things, but I was confident. \n\nI hit the dragon hard with Dragonrend and spun around, dashing up some broken stairs and meeting the Draugr head on. \n\nI switched my sword for dual casting Incinerate and managed to kill two Wights before the rest caught up to me. At this point I switched to my shield and sword, taking every opportunity I could to do heavy damage to a Deathlord, mixing in a Fire Breath shout as I could.\n\nNow, I knew the dragon was back in the air after I killed the first Deathlord. I know this because I got hit hard by a blast of frosty rage. \n\nI panicked as my health dropped FAST. This dragon wasn't fucking around.\n\nBashing the Deathlord currently attacking me I sprinted for a small building set into the mountain, quaffing Health potions like crazy. \n\nInside my respite, I managed to weaken the remaining Deathlords severely, and got the Death Overlord to half health before I ran back outside to ground the Dragon again, because I needed to fight in a more open area if I wanted to live. \n\nThere wasn't a dragon waiting for me. \n\nThere were two. \n\nTwo. Fucking. Elder. Dragons.\n\nFor your sake, this is where I will leave this part off. I'll continue later on with just how fucked up this pass is.",

        "text": "Tales of the Demon Boy\n\nHistory of the World:\n\nIn my world, approximately 200 years before the tale below, there was a Great War in which the Arcane Mages of the land exchanged blows in a battle for power. After many years of battle and skirmish, one wizard did the unthinkable. Early in the war he had begun casting a powerful spell. This spell had never been completed before. He locked himself in a dungeon to keep other from interrupting his spell. His plan had worked, unfortunately, the power was too great for the wizard to control. The wizard had accidentally separated the mortals of the land from the Weave (the magic that makes up the universe) making it impossible for Arcane Magic to be use again (or so they thought). In this world, Paladins and Clerics have complete dominion over power and government because they access there magic through channeling divines etc.\n\nMy Childhood: \n\nI was the Tiefling son of an Elven woman and a man who shared my Tiefling bloodline. Many paternal generations back, before the Great War, an Elven ancestorof mine made a pact with the Demon Lord known as the Queen of Chaos. In this pact, my ancestor and every first born male would be cursed with Abyssal blood. In return, each child would be granted immortality. All of this was granted at the cost of being a Tiefling, who were looked down upon by the rest of society. In fact, most Tieflings were known to be bound to devils, creatures of Infernal Heritage. So these few Tieflings of Abyssal blood were even frowned upon by other Tieflings. \n\nWhen the ancestor was \"slain\", his soul was sent to the Steaming Fen (the 14^th layer of the Abyss) where the Queen of Chaos began to reform him as promised; however, when he was reformed, he was no longer a Tiefling, but a dreaded demon known as Tanar'ri. He had been tricked by the Queen of Chaos. He gained his immortality but at what cost. He was now eternally bound to the Queen's bidding, along with all of the sons bearing the Abyssal blood. \n\nIn my youth, I lived well. My parents were well known in his society; my father had broken the barriers of distrust, married an Elven woman, and had become a prominent member of society. Although, hesitancy swelled when there first child was another Tiefling. My name was Arcanage (Ar-cun-aaj). I was quiet; a brilliant sort of quiet, I was told.. Even by the age of 3 those around me began to notice my deep lines of thought as I starred into the distance, motionless; it seemed I was pondering the very fabric of reality, I was told jokingly.  By the age of 7, I could speak 3 different languages, and by 12, I was working on a fourth.  My father taught me our tongue, Abyssal, at a young age which came very quickly. I picked up Common from my everyday surroundings as most, and eventually Elven from my mother.\n\nA mischievous lad I was, though, it was unknown if this was by nature or by nurture. My charismatic vocabulary got me out of most of trouble I ever could have possibly come across, and my brawn and brain helped me through the rest.  I began to dabble in acts of petty thievery. My best friend, Leodon, an Elf, was the son of the Court Cleric for my hometown. Periodically, I would steal texts from the Cleric's library, usually regarding lore or forgotten stories. I really meant no harm; I just enjoyed the reading. This is how I learned Draconic, my fourth language.\n\nLate one evening, I began reciting some of the Ancient Draconic writing aloud. As I finished my sentence, sparks flew from my tongue, though only for a moment. Being well studied, I realized it was magic. As a boy, I was taught that magic was treacherous, but I had fallen in love with it at that very moment. I stole and read every scroll and parchment I could find, trying to learn new tricks for my magical repertoire. I wanted to show all of my friends my magic once I prepared it, but I never found anymore spells. One night, whilst I was at Leodon's house, I stole Leodon's father's key to his forbidden library. I sneaked in stealthily and began reading. I stayed in the library all night and read almost every text on the small bookshelf, but found no magics. As I picked up the last book, I heard the rising of my hosts. I stuffed the text in my satchel and scurried off to bed, saving my last story until the following night.\n\nI began to read the book alone in the woods outside my home. It was entitled \"Gods, Demons, and Magics\". My interest had never been more peaked; for this was the only text I had thus far read in my first tongue, Abyssal. I noticed, sourly, the entire book was blank except for what seemed to be the verse of a song or rhyme in the very middle of the book. I read it aloud:\n\n\"As fires burn on Earth below, so do they burn in heaven's above. Accept this gift of keys I bring, unlocked your mind and let fire free.\"\n\nThe book falls to the ground. All was black. Then a small flame. I awaken, distraught at what has occurred. I knew it was some time later, for the sun had been set. I opened the book and finds it to be full of texts from a mixture of languages. Abyssal, Elven, and one I did not even recognize. Confused, I jumped from my place in a tree and started to return home; however, when I fell, I never touched the ground. I was levitating. With a gasp I fell back down to the earth. I ran home as fast as I could, afraid of what was happening to me. \n\nWhen I arrived, my home was in shambles; the door seemed to have been singed from its hinges; my mother laid slain across the floor. I screamed for my father, but there was no answer. \n\nI began to run to town for help. I found Leodon who was surprised to see me, so surprised, he was also in tears. \"I'm so sorry,\" he said, \"It was my father, I begged him not to.\" I ran hastily to the Cleric's Court where I saw my father being tortured by the powerful cleric. \"Where is the book!?\" exclaim the clergyman. I rushed in, raised the book from my bag and tossed it at the cleric, begging for his mercy toward my father. \"Mercy?\" He asked coldly, \"It is too late for mercy, neither of you may leave.\" At that moment, the court cleric bashed the head of my father with his great maul before my very eyes. I exploded into a rage of anger, guilt, and magic. Wildly, uncontrollably I ripped apart buildings and homes and people. It was all such a blur in my mind. Then everything was again black.\n\nWhen I awakened, I was alone. Rubble, ash, and fire were my only company. I fell down in tears of fear and sorrow. Then I heard a whisper, \"I am still here, you are not alone.\" The voice was kind, and gentle like that of my mother, yet it seemed darker. I followed the whispers until I reached there source. I sifted through the charred piles of my past only to find the book, unscathed. \"Gods, Demons, and Magics\". I picked up the book and there in the smut lay a silvery shaft of around eleven inches; embedded on the end was a blackish-red gemstone with green hues; the gem at first seem to change color as it refracted the light of the sun, but, as I examined it, I noticed the colors moved chaotically, randomly. Hesitantly, I grasped the wand. When my grip was fully set, I felt a power flow over me. \n\nI have since has begun to live in the streets of Oceanmar. My thirsts for knowledge are that of a vampire for blood. In my travels and readings I have seen and heard tales of demons, gods, devils, dragons, angels, and magic. I work on the streets as an entertainer and thief for money. No more than necessary, assured, the treasure I seek are those not of this world. I tell people that he is a magician and performs on the streets. On many occasions, I have been confronted by the Paladins, but I assures them that magic is fake, a myth, and that he is only trying to use tricks to make money. I do all I can to play them for a fool. Thus far, I have kept my secret safe, biding my time until he can gather the strength and knowledge to over-throw the oppression of this world. My long term goal is to understand his gifts and curses from the Queen of Chaos and use this understanding to break the curse that has marked his bloodline and escape the Queen's grasp.\n\nMy closest friend is my pet mouse, [Obox](http://i.imgur.com/G58Tgce.png). He is named after another Demon Lord. [Obox-Ob](http://i.imgur.com/NVn5DGv.jpg) is the name of the Prince of Vermin (because he's a mouse), Former Prince of Demons (the most esteemed title a Demon can hold), and demon rival to the Queen of Chaos (the demon who corrupted my families blood). I named my mouse this as a jestful shot against the Queen.",

        "text": "Well, it sure has been awhile since I posted one of these. I'd like to apologize to the few people that were actually following this series for my negligence in keeping it updated. I was busy with continuing the actual campaign, and also incredibly lazy. I'll try to get this log up to date within a couple months. To new readers, you can find the previous few entries in the comments. Here's a quick summary of the cast involved and their reasons for joining the caravan that framed the first arc of the campaign, more detailed descriptions are in the first entry:\n\nVebur Skullhammer, Dwarf Troll Slayer\n\nSwearing the slayer oath to die in battle after breaking the dwarven code of honor, Vebur is with the caravan following the path of his ancestor, who traveled to Araby centuries ago. And he might find some terrible monster to slay him along the way - unfortunately for him, dwarves are psychologically incapable of fighting to lose.\n\nAxel Muffins, Halfling Fieldwarden\n\nAxel was formerly part of a tight-knit group of scouts in the halfling homeland. His group was nearly destroyed by an encounter with the necromancer Dramesh. Axel, the only survivor, joined the caravan in search of new beginnings.\n\nRigg D'Elvagar, Human Tradesman\n\nRigg is a middle-aged man who grew up in a small village in the northern human Empire. Realizing he had reached his life's halfway point with nothing to show for it, Rigg apprenticed to an engineer by the name of Gregor Friemann, the caravan's resident technical expert.\n\nHelden Rommstagg, Human Apprentice Wizard\n\nHelden is a wizard who channels one of the eight winds of magic. His wind of choice is Shyish, the wind of death. As the senior apprentice of the Amethyst College, he was sent to investigate the disappearance of another Amethyst Magister by the name of Ludevicus, who vanished hunting down Dramesh. Helden recently found Ludevicus, and is poised to become a Journeyman Wizard soon.\n\nNikkel Roklept, Human Grave Robber\n\nBorn a peasant in the Empire, Nikkel's life was changed forever when his father abandoned the Roklept family, leaving behind a chest containing a stack of encrypted maps and a decoding tool, encoded in an unknown language. Nikkel was able to figure out that his father had headed in the direction of Araby, and joined the caravan to pursue the mystery.\n\nAnd here's the adventure. As always, feel free to ask and questions about the setting, the plot, or the rules, I'm happy to answer.\n\n &amp;nbsp;-----\n\n**Adventure 4: The Battle for Barak Varr**\n\n&gt;*“Of the battle with the foul greenskins that occurred on the thirtieth day of Kulkelzet, year 2522, many stories have been written by greater scribes than I of the heroic deeds of Barak Varr’s dwarven defenders. However, I seek to call attention to the tale of five travelers, who, under the capable command of one Koirin Stonesplitter, a ranger long of beard, far exceeded the demands of honor and proved instrumental in preventing great loss of dwarven life. Their story begins a month before the battle, when they became the first to relate news of the incoming green horde to Barak Varr…”*\n\n&gt;*-Excerpt from “Remnants of the Storm: The Holds After the War” by Virin Crackhorn, dwarf lore-keeper*\n\nWith the black magic in the Bloodmire quelled for the time being, the party hurried back to Barak Varr to inform the dwarven seaport of the Orc horde grinding across the Badlands towards it. Vebur was the foremost in urging the party to make haste, not because he was worried for the fate of his fellow dwarves-he was certain that Barak Varr could fend off an Orc Waaagh!, even if it suddenly materialized at their gates- but because he didn’t want to miss the chance for a great doom. Making haste back to the dwarfhold, the party relayed their sighting of Orcs in the Bloodmire and their belief that it was merely a tendril of the Waaagh! that had besieged Pentus a month prior. Barak Varr sent out rangers, and after a week had passed they returned with news of a swarm of greenskins looting, burning, and brawling their way across the Badlands, making slow but inexorable progress towards Barak Varr. They would arrive within the month, giving the defenders a fortnight to prepare.\n\n*The party wasn’t actually obligated to defend the hold, except Vebur on account on of the whole slayer oath thing. Nonetheless, heroic instincts prevailed. Also, they wanted to avoid getting on the dwarves’ bad side, which is apparently much scarier than a few orcs.*\n\nLudevicus, after recovering from his affliction, set to teaching Helden the more advanced ways of Amethyst magic. Helden proposed that they take the time before the arrival of the greenskins to prepare a ritual to assist the dwarves in the battle, and proposed calling up the spirits of the land to intimidate the orcs.\n\n*Importantly, this wasn’t necromancy, which the Brethren of Shyish tend to frown upon in a lethal way. They weren’t binding the spirits, just riling them up and pointing them in a general direction. Still a little sketchy, but for a good cause, and if Ludevicus was a staunch adherent to the principles of Shyish he wouldn’t have been so far from the Empire in the first place.*\n\nRigg continued his tutelage under Gregor, beginning the actual assembly of his rifle with the aid of the components of the hold’s Engineer’s Guild. Knowing he planned to participate in the battle, Gregor also furnished Rigg with a device of his own invention, a gunpowder bomb. Nikkel practiced the thieves’ arts. Axel collected his mail, and visited the library to research about necromancy, and more particularly vampires, with the encounter with the black coach still on his mind. Vebur spent most of the month recuperating from his head wound, and the rest of the time drinking himself into a stupor, as is the slayer way.\n\nAll too soon, the day of the orc’s arrival came, and the party went to battle. While Barak Varr’s army was impressed that the humans chose to help in the fight, their commitment to military discipline meant they couldn’t just let the party loose. Recognizing that their talents would be wasted in the front line, they assigned the party to a veteran ranger named Koirin Stonesplitter, who would lead them in missions that a small group of skirmishers could accomplish much better than a block of infantrymen.\n\nThe bulk of the fighting would occur in a valley leading to the largest land entrance to Barak Varr, surrounded by steep hills and thickets of trees that provided plenty of cover for greenskins to attack the vulnerable flanks and entrenched artillery of the dwarven army. The party waited inside a concealed exit from the hold, as Koirin looked for the ideal moment for them to make their exit after battle was joined. They held back for agonizing minutes as the sounds of dwarf and greenskin war cries and the thunder of cannon washed over the hills, until Koirin spotted an opportunity and gave the command to move out.\n\n*Leading up to it, this session was referred to as the “combat session.” I wanted to make the battle interesting, and not one four-hour grind of beating down an endless tide of orcs, so I created four mini-encounters, linked by the common theme of being important missions that occurred on the outskirts of the battle.*\n\nFrom their vantage point above the battle, the ranger had spotted a small band of orcs and goblins dragging a crude ballista into place. From its vantage point, it could rain bolts down on the dwarven cannon emplacements for vital minutes before the guns could be wheeled around to face it. Wasting no time, the party charged down, cresting the hill moments after the first spear was fired and before the orcs could finish erecting a crude barricade of sharpened wooden stakes. The goblins frantically finished loading a second spear, and the orcs waited for the party to come through the gaps in their spike-wall. Before the melee combatants could reach the greenskins, the goblins fired their bolt thrower, chucking a spear towards Axel, who barely managed to step aside and suffer only a light gash to the arm. The rest of the battle was short and brutal, as Koirin and Vebur hewed and crushed green flesh with greataxe and warhammer and the remainder of the party laid down ranged support. The greenskins were slain, and Koirin led the party onward-after they took the chance to fire a couple opportunistic bolts at the greenskins’ own army.\n\n*The highlight of this encounter was me rolling the lowest possible damage for a bolt thrower against Axel, only managing to inflict a light wound. His player still brings that one up all the time.*\n\nThe next task for the party was to lie in ambush for a flanking swarm of goblins sneaking through one of the concealed depressions between hills towards a squad of crossbow-dwarfs set up overlooking the battle. Through the combined stealth expertise of Nikkel, Axel, and Koirin, the party found a good hiding place overlooking the gobbos’ route and waited for them to get close. Once they did, the party realized that this mission was more urgent than it first appeared – the goblins in the middle of the pack were babbling, twitching, and clutching crude flails as large as themselves-Night Goblin fanatics. If they got to the dwarven line, they could wreak even more devastation than the bolt thrower could have. Seeing his chance, Rigg hurled Gregor’s bomb towards the goblin mob. It landed dead center and burst, rending through the goblins and felling all but one of the scrawny greenskins. The last goblin, acting on goblin survival instincts, turned as ran as fast as its scrawny legs could carry it.\n\n*I confess to being a little bit disappointed by the outcome of this one, as I do love goblin fanatics and would have liked to use one, but the dice continued to align with the PCs.*\n\nBefore they could pause to celebrate, the party spotted another band of greenskins, heading directly towards the same concealed exit they had begun the battle in. Cursing his negligence, Koirin led the party in a frantic sprint to intercept the greenskins, coming upon them in a small copse of trees. The greenskin skirmishing party was composed of half a dozen goblins and three massive orcs covered in crude plate – black orcs. Wasting no time, the party charged into battle. Most of the goblins died quickly, but the black orcs proved much harder to take down-what blows made it through their armor seemed to do little more than irritate the hardy greenskins. Vebur, locked in combat with one of the huge orcs, was flanked by a goblin, who laid open the slayer’s scalp with his spear and sent the dwarf staggering stunned into a tree. The party rushed to save the dwarf, managing to eke out a win over the orcs, who suffered several seemingly-fatal wounds before finally going down.\n\n*The second time in as many sessions that Vebur was nearly killed by a goblin hitting him in the head with a spear. This encounter cemented the dreaded spear-gobbo as an eternal enemy of Vebur Skullhamer. Also, black orcs are incredibly difficult to take down. These ones managed to soak most of the party’s damage with their armor and extreme resilience while dishing it out in equal measure before finally going down.*\n\nPausing to catch their breath, the party took advantage of their return to their vantage point to survey the state of the battle. While it seemed many greenskins had been slain, they still refused to rout, rallying around one of the most terrifying creatures the party had ever laid eyes upon – a giant. The creature easily stood ten times the height of a man, crushing swathes of dwarves with every swing of its fists, threatening to break through the dwarven line. Seeing opportunity in disaster, Helden sent a flare of Amethyst magic skyward, signaling Ludevicus to unleash their prepared ritual. The vengeful spirits of the land rose up through the earth in the middle of the orc mob, managing to strike fear into the greenskins. With the momentum of their charge stalled, the orcs were swiftly broken, and the remainder of the Waaagh! was finally sent running for the hills. The fact that it had lost the battle eventually penetrated the giant’s thick skull, and it turned tail and lumbered after the fleeing greenskins – directly towards the party’s position. With no time to flee, the party resolved to fight or die valiantly, Vebur exulting in the prospect of a glorious death. What followed would be spoken of in the taverns of Barak Varr for years to come. Axel let loose a perfectly aimed sling bullet, which cracked against the giant’s eye socket and sent it reeling for a moment. Vebur capitalized on its delay, darting forward past its flailing limbs and delivering a mighty blow to its leg, causing the clumsy beast to lose its footing and come crashing to the ground. The slayer, heedless of the tremors it caused hitting the ground, ran forward across its back, raised his hammer once again, and sent it crashing down into the giants’ skull. Then again, and again, and again, until the monster lay still. Spattered in giant blood and brain matter, he paused only to congratulate the halfling on his excellent aim before going off to lament the death that still evaded him.\n\n*Axel and Vebur crit the everloving shit out of the giant, killing it before it even got its turn in the initiative. The dice gods truly smiled upon them that day. Also, Vebur qualified to move into the Giant Slayer career.*\n\nWith the battle for Barak Varr won, thanks in no small part to the party’s actions, they returned to the hold to rest, recuperate, and drink to victory with the dwarves. That night, the party learned that while being treated in the usual gruff fashion of dwarves was intimidating enough, being lauded by them as heroes carried the even more fearsome prospect of death by alcohol poisoning.\n\n&amp;nbsp;---\n\nAnd that's it for part 5. Overall a fairly successful session, although how much of that was me and how much was the players being jazzed about outstanding dice rolls is still a mystery. Part 6 coming soon, covering the party advancing into new careers and Badlands funtime, which isn't actually fun at all. ",

Things did not go well, as they were soon bogged down in combat and forced to flee with their lives hanging by a thread. Everyone retired for a whole week to recuperate from their wounds, giving the goblins vital time. Physically back in action, the young heroes regroup to plan their next move...and search out a new friend…\n\nThe Cast of Characters includes:  \nLindsey as *Perdenzia, the Fae Foundling*  \nDJ as *Arrow, the Would-be Knight*  \nCaitlin as *Freya Pendragon Kirkwall, the Forgotten Noble Child*  \n\nAnd introducing…   \nRiley as *Caligeth ‘Cal’ Darwinus, the Apprentice Court Sorcerer*\n\n\nFreya knew Cal through living in close proximity back at Castle Kirkwall. She had actually been present when his master was devoured by a horrible demon, clearly some sort of terrible fallout from a magic ritual. He stopped by Lundenfeld after spending several weeks in the village of Corpol, studying the legends of the strange forest spirit that may or may not reside in the woods in the Lundenfeld region. Dashingly handsome and a good cook to boot, the party approached him for help, explaining the situation. He agreed to tag along to the pit, with his condition being that he got to keep the darkstone and study its strange effects. Everyone agreed and waited until the next day. Freya needed to stay at home to attend to family business, as they were quite put off by her running away for an adventure as she had done.\n\nThe group headed off, with Arrow leading on point. His keen senses picked up the sounds of goblin chatter, and the group rushed forward to find the pit. Inside were six goblins roasting up some dinner around a fire, and talking. The party needed to get into the pit to dig up the darkstone, so a plan was set. Perry, perched on the lip of the pit, cast her fae magics about, creating the illusion of the three of them running into the tunnel entrance of the pit. Five of the six goblins, being simple creatures, fell for the trick and rushed off. The sixth looked up and saw the party standing there. Before he could call out an alarm, Arrow picked up a sizable stone and chucked it, hoping to knock out the alerted goblin. But the gods were smiling down on them on this day, and the die rolled a natural 20. The rock sailed through the air, beaming the goblin right in the face and killing him almost instantly. Arrow and Cal rushed down the scaffolding to the floor while Perry stayed put, concentrating on her illusion.\n\nCal started digging as Arrow went and placed a small fire at the tunnel entrance, hoping that it’d keep anyone curious at bay. Cal found the darkstone, an obsidian sphere about the size of a watermelon, buried about a foot deep. Picking it up, he quickly hustled up the scaffolding with Arrow in tow. Shouts of distress came from the pit as they ran back off towards the village, happy that this expedition went a lot better than last time...",

[Another tale of mayhem and failure is starting!](https://redd.it/3hxhf7) Now, have you wonderful ~~suckers~~ folks gotten familiar with our four-man band? That's too bad, because stuff happened and now there's five! Strange, why does the DM look like he's having a stroke? Anyway, meet our [valiant heroes, Tokenhuman the human druid, Barrel the halfling rogue, Thoth the shabti magus, Rose the dullahan ranger, and Pratena the punchy cyclops](http://imgur.com/a/uBYvL). They work as mercenaries for truth and justice! Or money and killing assholes, anyway...\n\nSo, at about this time, the party was experiencing some down-time. Again. Being possibly the best fighters on the planet can do that to you. But there was good news, too- Thoth had eventually remembered that he was part of this little song-and-dance, and thus decided to get off his dusty faux-egyptian ass and actually contribute. And just in time, too! A new mission came in from the Asshole Patrol headquarters, straight from Partyboss. They were going to a wonderful labyrinth of mysterious origin, that looked different to every passerby, and could only ever be entered once. Oh, and large amounts of restless soul-eating monsters were congregating there. We've already sent like, three teams, and none of them came out again, but you'll do better, right?\n\nOn the way in, the party decided to gather some info and stock up on minor things. Mainly fire, silver, and some actual equipment for Tokenhuman because he never remembered to actually spend his money on anything. But finally they arrived the mouth of the wonderful cave. Hm, mouth... funny word, that. It seemed to be belching out clouds of mysterious mist...\n\nMist that contained [asshole spiders](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/nightshade/nightskitter), hiding and throwing negative-level nets at the party. Nearly everyone was caught at some point, but a combination of sheer stubbornness, quick-slicing weapons, fire magic and a handy dimension door remedied the situation easily. Until Pratena got bit by one of the dickish spiders in an ambush. Pratena countered with a punch.\n\nOkay, \"punch\" doesn't convey the gravity of it. This was not a \"punch\". A \"punch\" does not leave little smoking pieces of your opponent on the walls, ceiling, and stuck in nearby trees. [This was a nuclear warhead that came in a fist-sized package. This was a flaming meteor that had found itself on the end of a 13-year-old's arm. This was a \"punch\" in the same way that a supernova is an \"expelling of heat\".](http://i.imgur.com/NhZEnLz.jpg) See the spider? Now you don't.\n\nThe rest of the battle went about like that, with the spiders only managing to make themselves a nuisance with no real chance of victory. The last one fled before horrible things could happen to it, too. As this wrapped up, they thanked all of the gods that they had a convenient healer on their side now. Thanks, doctor Tokenhuman!\n\n&gt; Tokenhuman: \"Isn't anyone going to ask why I can do that?\"\n\n&gt; Party: \"No.\"\n\n&gt; Tokenhuman: \"But... isn't that weird?\"\n\n&gt; Party: \"Your allies are a pyromaniac nudist in a barrel, an undead king from ages past who keeps hearing voices in his head, a suit of armor that has a cat palace inside its breastplate, and a thirteen-year-old that bends i-beams into loops for fun. Get over yourself.\"\n\n&gt; Tokenhuman: \"...Fair enough.\"\n\nThe party ventured onwards into the mouth of the sinister dungeon... which slammed shut behind them. Welp, no getting out now, onward we go! The party then proceeded to dick around in some hallways that contained a few traps powered by monsters lying in ambush. Barrel turned them into sushi platters, and nobody took even a single point of damage. Moving on...\n\nAfter dicking around with a few locked doors, the party eventually decided not to press their luck by bursting in on some undead wizard's business and instead took a convenient shortcut to a different part of the dungeon. A few steps in, they spotted a tell-tale sign of a trap: A corner of the hallways that ended abruptly in total darkness. Clearly there was a monster inside. So the party did the only sensible thing and... walked past it. It was probably sleeping, it couldn't possibly OH SNAP AMBUSH! The horrible [Nightcrawler](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/nightshade/nightcrawler) tunneled beneath the party's feet, and erupted to bite at- aaand it crit failed. Pratena wheeled around and let loose some (strangely disappointing) punches, while Barrel worked as backup and Thoth supported with spells. The thing managed to tunnel underground, but attacked once more during its retreat AAAAAAND IT CRIT FAILED. The CR 18 monster of solid nightmares was nailed to the ceiling by its tail and carved into teeny tiny pieces.\n\n&gt; DM: \"Why, dice? Just... why?\"\n\nThe stalwart heroes (save Rose, who was fighting down panic attacks at every turn) emerged into a new room, with a swirling mass of hostile souls in the center of it. Gleaming red eyes peered out of its writhing depths, as something... TWO somethings broke off to engage the party! It looked strangely like... A MIRROR MATCH! Yes, the evil creatures of darkness coalesced into the forms of the heroes themselves, exploiting their incredible power for their own benefit! Thankfully for the heroes, though, the only ones they were fighting at present were Alter-Rose and Evil-Tokenhuman. But the swirling mass of evil spirits seemed to be working on those...\n\nThinking quickly, Rose charged in with a silver fauchard, scoring a good hit on Evilhuman and bashing him with a shield, to boot. Tokenhuman followed up by shapeshifting into an ENORMOUS FUCKING BEAR and getting ready to wreck shit. Pratena and Barrel, though, had to face down Alter-Rose and her god-like armor class. 1d20+29 ain't got shit on an AC of 50. Pratena decided to use her go-to spell and pelt the horrible abberation with ki arrows duct taped to Barrel's alchemical bombs. Thoth, meanwhile, was getting ready for one hell of a showdown. See, while everyone else only had single-use spells and class gimmicks to throw at Alter-Rose, Thoth had a secret weapon.\n\nA balloon sword.\n\nWhile this sword did no damage on its own, it hit with touch attacks, and could be used as a focus for Thoth's spells and enchantments. Like, for example, Bane. Thoth popped under a Greater Invisibility, moved in, and struck hard with the Rosebane Balloon. Meanwhile, Evilhuman was abusing the same shapeshifting power as Tokenhuman, leading to an epic smackdown of [Huge Dire Bear](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/bear/dire-bear/bear-giant-advanced-dire) vs [Giant Octopus](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/octopus/giant-lake-octopus), with Rose riding on TokenHuman's back for [a battle of the century](http://i.imgur.com/6vfKrNy.gifv).\n\nOn the Barrel front, things were going reasonably well. Instead of wasting more attacks and bombs on the AlterRose, Barrel opted to strike at the source of the issue- the horrible soulmass that was gearing up to produce another player-clone. He hucked alchemist's fire into the screaming pit, and was gratified when the heat and light disrupted the formation of the next opponent- but it didn't stop it entirely. MirrorPratena was ejected from the pit, as the soulmass started to recede. Meanwhile, the real Pratena moved into position to attack her double, and AlterRose (who still couldn't see Thoth) decided to put a named bullet into Barrel's head.\n\nHe lived, but it was a grievous injury. Thoth took down AlterRose soon after, with a flourish of his squeaky weapon, and TokenHuman finished off his kaiju battle with a solid hit and a final swipe of his bear claws to claim a trophy. A tentacle from EvilHuman was cleft off, and flew straight into Pratena's face, disrupting her ambush of MirrorTena. MirrorTena seized the opportunity to deliver a couple of nasty haymakers to the real Pratena, showing her just how devastating her own damage output was. Thankfully, with all of the other threats neutralized, the party was free to gang up and curb-stomp the doppleganger out of existence, with Pratena and Barrel having a competition to see who could output the most damage in a standard action. Barrel won by virtue of his deadly Sneak Attack, dealing over a hundred damage in a single strike, as opposed to Pratena's measly sixty. Well, good to know your strengths.\n\nWith that, the room had been secured, and as escape wasn't an option and the party was pretty banged up, they decided to fort up the room and rest for a while. In a dungeon filled with hostile soul-eating creatures that could occasionally phase through walls. It was lucky Rose didn't need to sleep, because she sure as hell wasn't getting ANY rest on this op.\n\n[NEXT TIME ON \"Darker than deepest dimness\", CAN I DATE YOUR DOPPLEGANGER AND THE DICE STRIKE BACK!](https://redd.it/3j482q)",

        "text": "&gt; A secondhand story told to me by a friend about one hell of a... playa.\n\nSo there's this guy in my group, Casanova, who's got this really weird fixation on romancing NPCs. At the time of this story, I'm playing a big dumb ogre named Mart, and he's playing some... I forget. A fighter class, probably. But the basis of the campaign was that we were heroes on hold, popped into cryosicles and thawed out whenever a new Very Bad Thing happened so that we could murder its face.\n\nNow Mart and Casanova were really hitting it off, teaming up to do damage and keep Mart in line when combat stuff wasn't happening. That was good, you know? Mart's the kind of guy who needs direction. But the thing is, Casanova just haaaaaas to get the girl, so he goes off and romances some woman and does the deed before being herosicle'd again. Good for him, right? Well, except that he wasn't going for a one-night stand, he wanted the whole nine yards. This was the kind of campaign where decades passed without us getting out of our little freezer packs, so even Mart could see that this was a goddamned stupid idea.\n\nCasanova then proceeds to dick himself over by getting wrapped up in a whirlwind sex party with a succubus. But ohhh, his heart belongs to another, so he can't keep boning the immortal demon woman. This rejection pisses the succubus right the hell off. And, since succubi get freaky sex powers, she starts working mojo on him. The situation devolves to the point where Mart needs to step in to lend assistance, leading to some hilarity with demons of temptation trying to find the hidden vices of man the size of a building with a brain of a three-year-old.\n\nWell anyway, Casanova then barters a deal with the succubus. He gets to go off and rejoin his beloved for three hours, and then goes back to being miss infernal's sex toy forevermore. Casanova's beloved, by the way, was completely convinced that her lost love was dead, or screwed off to the ethereal plane or some bullshit. She'd had years to come to terms, and now Casanova was gonna pop back in and say \"Hey, I got frozen for like twenty years and accidentally cheated on you with a literal incarnation of evil, but I'm back now, can we screw? Oh and I can never see you again after this.\" Mart, appalled at this horrible breach of common sense, tried everything to get Casanova to stop thinking with his +4 rapier of penetration and actually consider the consequences of his actions. Yeah, Mart, the ogre who was a functional retard, giving relationship advice to this dipshit.\n\nWell Casanova, rapier in hand, fenced his way out of that one and knocked Mart unconscious to go carry off his dumbass plan. Somehow, it went EVEN WORSE than Mart had imagined... Casanova spent the entire three hours talking to the shaken woman about what was really going on, and never got to unleash his throbbing... sincerity upon her. Because apparently having your worldview rattled around like a gerbil in a tumble dryer is not exactly something that enhances the bedroom experience. So Casanova wasted the entire three hours, and had to go back to being the succubus's bitch. But that's not the kicker. The crowning jewel in this basket of fuckups wasn't his dumbass plan of getting laid, nor his outright betrayal of Mart, his closest friend. It wasn't even getting consigned to be a demon's sex bitch. No, the real hot stuff was in the unintended consequences.\n\nSee, the DM rolled for Lady Love's reaction to this whole story. A d100, with low rolls reserved for telling Casanova to take a hike with his Wand of Lordly Might, and high numbers meaning she gets pulled into the idiotic star-crossed-lovers bullshit. So what'd she get? A natural 1.\n\nNoose.\n\nSo, let's recap. Casanova has just proven himself a complete goddamned psychopath, betraying his best friend and driving his lady love to suicide in the name of a good fuck that he didn't even get. Now he's friendless, loveless, and the sex-slave of a pissed-off succubus.\n\nMaybe we should get him one of those Japanese body pillows.",

        "text": "It's on our private Facebook group. We post in case people can't make a session and so we have something to reference in the future. It's also useful because we have a somewhat unique multi-gm system wherein we rotate gm's almost every session. Next gm builds off the previous in a collaborative storytelling style.\n\nAnyways, we had a couple interesting sessions I thought I'd share.\n\nThis post is long as hell. You've been warned lol. But if you like to read how some of your fellow r/rpg[1] redditors play, this is for you. Shit got WEIRD.\n\nThe game system was dungeon world. Names have been changed to protect the innocent. Little is lost without context.\n\nAdventure summary: 8/8/15\n\nThe party was reunited back in Fellstone after a few of them took a harrowing trip to the Ricequeen Mountains to meet Rarngardt, the wizard. Now that they had the location of the Librum Luxorum, they endeavored to find it. They set out to the distant Northwest of Amaranth, the tip of the Ricequeen Mountain range, at the shore of the ocean.\n\nOn the way, Aestus had unsettling dreams of an orc ceremony. In one dream, he was chased to a clearing where he witnessed a large woman dressed in the Amaranthine style hanged from a black iron gallows. In another dream, he saw that same woman, now the features of an orc, leading the other orcs.\n\nWhen the party drew close to their destination, he recognized the area as that from his dream.\n\nThey set down their airship in a clearing and walked to the Librum. It was floating over a ravine but under the thick cover of the immense jungle trees. The party stepped into the main tower and observed many signs that orcs had settled inside: weapons, beds, and rotten food. But they saw no orcs moving around.\n\nThey decided to split up.\n\nAleerendeel went alone and found a locked door. He teleported himself inside to a pitch black room where he heard the scraping of metal. He lit a torch and saw two animated skeletons sitting at a table counting coins and precious gems. Behind them, he saw a thick circular door etched with runes. Next to the door was a weapon rack with a single sword on it. Aleerendeel moved to the sword and grabbed it. As soon as he did, the skeletons lunged at him. After a brief struggle, involving fumbled attempt after fumble attempt, Aleerendeel failed to escape. One of the skeletons placed an icey hand over Alereendeel's heart and stopped it.\n\nArthur and Swoo went to find the deceased head librarian's chambers. Inside they fought a letter detailing conclusive proof of the librarian's involvement in the betrayal of the Librum.\n\nAestus and Ibelin went to the top of the tower where they imagined they might find instruments of evocation they could carry back. To their dismay, they found a vast apparatus used for spying on the heavens, a telescope and accompanying equipment. They turned back and went another way, only to find the corpse of a dead wizard at another door. Before they could investigate further, they heard Aleerendeel's distant, dying scream.\n\nThe four remaining adventurer's, Aestus, Ibelin, Arthur, and Swoo, assembled themselves in front of the locked door that Aleerendeel had teleported past. They smashed down the door and dispatched the skeleton guards. Swoo's lifesense immediately identified an emerald containing a soul. Hoping that it was Aleerendeel's, Swoo began attempting to put that soul into Aleerendeel's body.\n\nWhile that was happening, Ibelin and Arthur were examining the hieroglyphic runes on the circular door. They deciphered that at least one represented Wahatep, the ancient God of secrets said to have ruled the moon. They pried the door open and inside saw a field of overgrown emeralds covering a sandy room. On a mound in the center of the room was a skull bursting with emeralds.\n\nJust then Swoo's magic took a strange turn. He felt control of it slipping away from him, as though seized by an incredible power.\n\nAleerendeel's body rose, floating several inches off of the ground and he began to speak in an unnerving chorus of voices. Immediately it was clear that Aleerendeel's soul was not in the body.\n\nAestus was unhelpful and the lich summoned a small, perfectly smooth ball of cold, black iron. The ball began floating towards Aestus as he backed his way out of the room.\n\nIbelin ran his mouth, as per Liam's contract to attempt suicide by dumb once per adventure, and the character was promptly teleported to the surface of the moon. To Ibelin relief, the moon was a barren, yet habitable location.\n\nSwoo channeled what power he could muster, straining himself to reach dangerous heights of unexplored magic, and forcing the lich from Aleerendeel's body and back into the skull in the next room.\n\nThe iron ball morphed into a new shape, a spike like what might be used in a metal construction. Swoo recognized it as a spike from the Black Gates of Death. Aleerendeel returned to his body, conscious but touched by Spirit Madness. Swoo was unhinged, spasming and gibbering in unknown tongues.\n\nThe exciting conclusion this Saturday!\n\nPart 2:\n\nWelp, here goes nothing.\n\nAdventure summary 8/22/15:\n\nThe party was still in the Librum Luxorum when we ended the last session. Everyone swiftly left the room where the lich had just been. After resolving to stick together in the future, the party moved to investigate the headmaster's chambers once more. There, they discovered a letter which read,\n\n\"Headmaster,\n\nThe orc experiment has gone too far. It must be ended. You know the plan.\n\n/signed/ Rarngardt\"\n\nAlso in the room was a cup of mostly drank tea, leaves still sitting at the bottom. Pitar read the tea leaves, through use of his Skull of Dark Fortune. The leaves revealed to him a vision of Rarngardt, the sorceress, giving a woman a dark iron spike. The woman went to the orcs and was hanged by them on a great black iron gallows. She then rose again as a giant orc queen. She lead the orcs and razed Fellstone. Pitar lost all of his remaining hair, and became dazed and angered by his exposure to the toxic leaves. Aleerendeel found some unused tea leaves, dried lasher vine, and pocketed them.\n\nThen the party went back to a door from last session. The door had a symbol of a black iron gallows. A corpse was slumped next to it. The party shoved the door open, revealing a chamber full of instruments, chemicals, lab equipment, and corpses. Before long, the party discovered they were not alone. A laughing and an orc voice came out of the darkness and the room began to fill with red smoke.\n\nPitar and Arthur were struck with poison darts filled with lasher vine extract. Pitar, already weakened by his previous exposure became more orc than Hecti. He flew into a rage against the party, ripping a hole in the fabric of the physical world and exposing the room to the cold void of space. Beyond the schism, something terrible began to stir.\n\nIn a desperate act, Aleerendeel hurled his sword at the Skull of Dark Fortune. When the two objects collided, both vanished in a plume of dark smoke. After a pitched melee involving Aestus forging himself to the stone floor and Pitar turning the floor to a living tongue, everyone except Arthur was tossed into space. Outer space, like the surface of the moon, was a habitable but desolate place. Unlike the moon, the void of space is home to timeless entities who drift between the stars, mere shadows of existence, until being disturbed by living beings. The more the party affected the void, the more the void became aware of them. Or, perhaps, the void became aware of itself.\n\nIn the long distance of space, a bright light with a dark center was moving slowly towards the drifting party.\n\nPitar was now at the very source of his power and became overwhelmed by it, diminishing the effects of the lasher vine. Without need of the skull artifact, Pitar began to weave a spell, his magnum opus, to end imminent battle between men and orcs in Fellstone. But the twisted influence of the void had already began to seep into his mind, fracturing his mortal psyche. To fight, Pitar reasoned, the men in Fellstone must have arms. The answer was as obvious as it was ambitious, simultaneously self-evident and brilliant.\n\nAll of the people of Fellstone must be transformed into gigantic slugs with human heads.\n\nThe bright light approached, closing the incomprehensible distances of space in what might have been an hour or ten hours. It began to take shape, first a shadowy blob lit by a vast fire behind it. Then silver edges in the darkness, followed by forms of wings. It was a glider, massive and industrial, but similar to those seen in the battles with Cogkettle. Across the bow of the voidship was writing, \"C.A.N.T.R.O.S. Academy\". There was one seat in the open cockpit. Sitting in the seat was none other than the master of entertainment, a man of grand showmanship, Ibelin.\n\nHaving completed his greatest work to date, Pitar was struck with a moment of clarity. The vast, alien nature of the void was revealed to him. In that moment, he was forced to admit that he could never make the people of his home world understand what he had come to know. They would forever view his work with suspicion and jealousy, owing particularly to their trivial sense of morality. He let loose of the CANTROS voidship and took his place amongst the stars.\n\nMeanwhile, back on the planet, Arthur was nearly sucked into the void with the rest of the party. Before he could join them, however, he was seized by a grip not only on his physical self, but also on a shadow he only now became dimly aware he had been casting his entire life. The void elemental stepped through the tear in reality and stood at once in the physical world and also loomed incomprehensibly immense before Arthur's myopic sense of existence. With a careless upturned palm, the being summoned the demi-lich's skull into the room. The lich wailed with ecstasy at its liberation.\n\nStill helpless in the clutches of a being both with and without form, which assailed him in ways he could barely perceive and could not comprehend, Arthur summoned his strength for one last assault. He spewed forth zombie vomit on the lich. Then reality closed in around Arthur and he no longer existed.\n\nThe rest of the party hurtled towards the planet. They saw strange continents, dotted with foreign cities, populated by unknown people. As they passed over an ocean, Amaranth came into view. They saw Fellstone, a column of green light shooting out into space. At its base was a dome covering a small part of the city. Then everything was a blinding white light, as though the sun had touched the world. When they had regained their sight, the party saw a black cloud in the shape of a mushroom rising over the city.\n\nThey continued to fly, unable to pilot the craft. They soared over the plains and rivers, saw the old Librum grounds, the Till, and nearly clipped the peaks of the Ricequeen mountains. Eventually they crashed into the Connacht Sea, several miles from the shore.\n\nThey swam back to shore, trudged to back to the Librum, and recovered the now conscious Swoo. Together they retrieved the ball of perpetual steam as well as the plans for a rocket engine recovered from the minotaurs.\n\nThe party then traveled to the pre-established (ret-conned) meeting point, the town of Veromme, the site of the fighting with Cogkettle those many months ago. The town was under siege by Cogkettle forces once more, and this time the fighting was much fiercer. Firebombs blanketed the city and the miasma of the Till wafted over the town like a chemical bath.\n\nThe entire party is now in Veromme (see map). There is a rumor that many soldiers from both sides of the conflict have laid down their arms, deserting their causes. Those soldiers have taken to living a simple life in the high reaches of the mountain. On one of the cliffs, it is said that a strange meteorite has crashed and now emits powers and grants visions. The ex-soldiers have taken to worshiping the stone. Many believe it is cast down to the world from the void. Some say the stone has a consciousness. A few have heard a name whispered in the edges of their mind, where perception begins to fail...\n\n\"Arthur\"",

        "text": "Last week, I began running a new Hunter: the Vigil game named Project: VESPER, after a new project in the the international paranormal defense squad Task Force: VALKYRIE. Their job is to investigate and deal with paranormal threats of all kinds. This is their story.\n___________________________\nIn the first exciting episode of Project: VESPER we met the newest members of the team:\nTyson Byrd, a former decorated US soldier brought into the government's service once again.\n\nDet. James Rojas, a homicide detective drawn inexplicably into the world of the supernatural.\n\nDr. Jacob Stein, a brilliant surgeon and computer scientist with a mysterious and shady past.\n\nMeeting up on the hipstery streets of Buffalo, NY, the team reviewed their case notes. Multiple instances of local homeless people were \"snapping\" and violently assaulting innocent bystanders, all within the downtown area. Police had been forced to kill the homeless on the spot when the frenzied assaults turned on them. Task Force: VALKYRIE had suspicions of supernatural activity, so the group was deployed to the wonderland of western New York.\n\nWith no weapons issued and a point of contact jotted down to visit later, East Seneca chief of police Reyes, the team headed straight downtown. Upon arriving in the area, they started looking for the local homeless population to begin questioning. Finding one who couldn't escape in time, they began questioning him. Though he offered up information regarding local young socialites involved in providing drugs to the homeless, he had nothing specific to give up. With this, they moved to the scene of the crime where they found a rather conspicuous dumpster with a head-shaped dent. Intent on investigating, they dived in.\n\nAt this point, a crowd assembled on the nearby street corner, gathering around a shabby homeless man in a white coat. \"I am the human iPod!\" he proclaimed. \"I will sing any #1 hit song for $1.\" As his first request, and dollar, came in, he broke out into the world's worst rendition of \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" by Tears for Fears. Though the audience was very excited, Tyson, who had come over to see what was happening, was not.\n\nJust as James and Jacob discovered a small baggie of white powder at the bottom of the dumpster, havoc broke loose at the Human iPod's one man show. Suddenly enraged, the homeless street performer leapt forward, grabbing a young woman in the assembled crowd and biting into the side of her neck. The crowd scattered and the team leapt into action.\n\nThen, as if straight out of a fairy tale, in rode a literal knight in shining armor. Fresh from a LARPing session, a man identified only as \"Saulden\", a man with a possibly serious mental illness and very rich parents, approached on horseback. Seeing the blackguard's vicious assault on the helpless peasant woman, he dismounted and charged in to her defense.\n\nWhat ensued next could be best described as a WWE wrestling match. Without weapons to stop the Human iPod, the raging vagrant unleashed hell on the party, tossing them aside like children. Dr. Stein, though obviously very confused, went straight into surgery mode, dragging the injured victim aside and stabilizing the heavily bleeding wound in her neck, possibly saving her life.\n\nAs the party battled the performer for 2-3 minutes, the police responded, gunning down the Human iPod immediately on arrival. Good night, sweet prince. After being questioned for a while and giving their versions of what happened, the party was released.\n\nInspired by the party's crusade for justice, Saulden joined up, having his irritated uncle pick up his unnamed horse and take it to the stables. Climbing into their mid-size sedan, the party now made their way to the East Seneca police station to speak with Chief Reyes.\n\nGetting Reyes's side of the matter, they discover a possible linked drug dealer is a man named \"Durty Ricky.\" The chief has a secretary pull up records for Ricky and begrudgingly gives the party access to some police weapons and armor.\n\nGetting permission to use the police station's drug lab to investigate the white powder, Jacob traces the chemical composition of the substance. Unsurprisingly, it contains cocaine, but the real surprise is the other chemicals lacing the powder. Dr. Stein is able to identify different chemicals within, but they are all rarely seen or used chemicals; nothing used in common household cleaners or anything you might normally see.\n\nAs an officer brings them their requested information, a whole rap sheet on Durty Ricky with his real name (Richard Harris), address, phone numbers and prior arrests, the party arms up and rolls out to Ricky's house.\n\nArriving in the middle of the night to an apartment in the ghetto, the team pounds on the door. A young crackhead opens up and tells the team to leave, stating Ricky is currently at Club Inferno. Still eager to investigate, the team makes their way inside, playing the role of dirty cops happily. As the young head protests and begins to call Ricky, Rojas gets in his face and intimidates the shit out of him, cuffing him and warning that Ricky may very well disappear and never come back and implying that he could be next.\n\nGetting the point, the young crackhead, a man who stays at Ricky's house and presumably keeps cops like these out, begins to spill what beans he has. Ricky does a lot of dealing with the socialites at Club Inferno, all young-looking stylish men who come around the apartment occasionally. The new drug is somehow related to the club.\n\nAs the party investigates the apartment, fuck a search warrant, the phone begins to ring. Ricky is calling back. With Ricky's roommate issuing the threat that Ricky's boys are on the way, the party expedites their search. Finding very little in the allotted two minutes, they head to Club Inferno.\n\nThe club is packed and the bouncer is a huge bearded hipster who attempts to deny the party access, especially with the giant man dressed as a knight in their midst. After crafting a story about this knight being a Youtube sensation, a man who goes into clubs dressed like a knight and dances at nightclubs in viral videos, the bouncer lets them in.\n\nAs they enter, the club is packed and trance music booms throughout the building. It looks for all intents and purposes like your standard rave. Until the sprinkler system begins to rain blood over the crowd and they begin to bite each other passionately. As the club breaks out into a blood-soaked orgy of writhing cold bodies, the VESPERs realize they walked right into the middle of Buffalo's hottest vampire club.",

Before embarking on our first mission, to find the leader of a mining world which had recently been attacked by xenos, I rolled for my chemical, and failed pretty well. Holding on to it, my fellow PC's come across and make quick work of some bandits who were taking advantage of the chaos after the xenos attack. I decided to convince Garm, our meatshield to taste the chemical, and after convincing him it was a new variety of stim, he drank some. \n\nUnknown to me, the GM had a table of the ill effects that could come about from a failed roll, and I'd managed to get just about the worst. Anyone who had some would instantly gain 3d10 corruption, and their mind would be opened to the daemons of the Void. So, now Garm had dozens of Daemons screaming at him, half wanting to make a deal, the other half urging him to kill me. Thankfully, he failed at doing so, but he was still in the grips of one particularly strong deamon. We called the sister of battle to chant her chant to drive it away, and the PC was saved. After much consternation and anger from the group, I am now no longer trusted by the group, and have an explosive collar around my PC's neck and testicles.",

        "text": "I follow my Lord Rogue Trader, because his success is mine.  It is my job to watch over the budget, to ensure business is running smoothly, and to know our competitors while simultaneously preventing them from discovering our secrets.  I manage the hundreds of men in the lower decks; I make sure they work hard but are satisfied, preventing revolts or discord amongst the ranks.  I know our allies, our enemies; I cater to the whims of my Lord and expand our enterprise according to his will.  In this respect, I run the ship.  I have overheard the whispers of the doubters and the ignorant in the shadows, as I silence those who's words prove harmful.  Some have wondered why I trust my Lord so completely, while the reverse is also true.  Many have been wary of me of course, the 'Master of Secrets' must be as draped in darkness as the assailants that hunt him if he wishes to survive.  I do not blame those who are suspicious of my intentions.  I only prevent their ideas from spreading.\n\nAs for my Lord, I have my reasons for my loyalty.  He may seem lazy, and often times foolish, but beneath that there are qualities a man like me could never possess.\n\nThey are the gifts that make him a Rogue Trader.\n\nBarely a second out of the comfort of the ship and my nerves already rise.  Court has organised two shuttles, one for us along with his pick of thirty men, and the other for cargo.  My Lord has equipped himself with more ammunition than usual, while everyone else seems at ease.  Odette in truth looks excited, unable to sit still.\n\nLanding on the asteroid we carefully file out of the shuttle and gaze up in awe at the sheer magnitude of the Righteous Path.  Speaking up, Odette points out our best point of entry; a crack in the hull which is positioned around the middle.   As everyone gets ready to climb, I engage my grapple hawk to make up for my lack of physical ability, and prepare to propel upwards towards the surface.\n\nOut of no where Odette, deciding she would prefer a ride, jumps onto my back before I have time to react.  Knowing the technology is not strong enough for the both of us, I start to twist in attempts to shake the petulant Navigator off.  Although my resistance isn't very strong it's enough to send her flying as she fumbles, unable to regain her footing.  I watch her begin to slowly drift off the asteroid into open space, contemplating letting her go as punishment for the embarrassment she's caused me.  But alas, we need her.  Instead, I send my hawk over to grab her, pulling her back to safety.\n\nOnce that overly dramatic episode is over, we along with Court's men ascend into the Righteous Path.  As we enter, Zez comes to an abrupt halt, holding the side of her helmet, sounding distressed.\n\n\"The machines are suffering!\"  Sure enough, there is still power aboard as lights flicker, refusing to die even in the ship's state for hundreds of years.  Zez's reaction makes it seem like a very painful existence.  The crew comforts her as we all file behind my Lord, leading the way.  After all, our plan is to destroy this wreck of a ship when we're done.  Perhaps then the machine spirits will find their peace.\n\nSome time passes, then we come across a block in our path; a laser grid preventing us access onto the main decks.  Carefully our Voidmaster and Explorator examine the gate, while I stay back to give them room.  Somehow, I get the feeling that the machine spirits aren't the only thing still alive on this ship.  That should be impossible with the hull torn open, but even so the dark paranoid feeling that we are not alone surges through my mind.  Nothing is ever this easy.  I close my eyes and focus on the thought of safety, imagining the air wrapping around us, keeping us safe and hiding us from evil intent.\n\nOver the comms unit I hear Court.  \"It seems as if we will have to -\" his message cuts off as my micro bead malfunctions.  All the lights of the ship snap off, the laser grid in our way following suit and powering down.  I look around at my crewmates, who seem to be trying to communicate, testing out the broken comms link.  Zez looks panicked, her attachments also falling victim to the black out, now nothing more than dead weight.  I check over my belongings - my data slate and grapple hawk - as expected they have also crashed.  I carefully pull my Infernio pistol from its holster and study it in the low primitive light of our void suits, the one thing that appears to be still functioning.  I try to examine it, noticing only now how my hands are trembling, making a full inspection of the weapon impossible.  I roughly stuff the gun back in its place, none the wiser of its condition.  This is not the time for shot nerves.\n\nWhatever the case, we are now free to pass.  Odette frantically waves her arms about mouthing words barely visible through her helmet, while my Lord looks as if he's engaged in a rather intense argument that unfortunately none of us can overhear.  Despite having set up code words with the senior staff, all communication we have discussed in the past has been verbal (something I clearly need to rectify once back aboard our own vessel).  Until our comms unit comes back online, it will be practically impossible to relay messages to one another.\n\nAfter some frantic miming, my Lord leads us all inside the main halls.  For a ship supposed to be full to the brim, it is disappointingly empty so far.  I look around the darkness, trying to gleam what I can inside the dusty old relic, but am unable to find anything of note.  I wonder if I should be here at all.  With all of us gone I think it more likely for the cult members and Inquisition to send their messages laced with our false information; at least that is my excuse.  I would be lying if I said I wasn't curious, albeit out of my depth.  I just need to keep close to the others and remember everything I see for my duties once we return.\n\nOne of the crew notices from behind the moss and rubble a sign reading 'Navigator', along a curved wall.  Odette jostles around what is safe to assume the old Navigator tower, looking for the entrance as the rest of us stick together.  We eventually find a hatch sealed shut.  Court steps forward, pulling out his lascutter to open the way.  After a few minutes he stands up, barely beginning the process, and starts signing and pointing down.\n\nIt takes a moment but I finally see what he is referring to.  From the cut in the bottom of the heavy door a small jet of air is pushing through, blowing about the debris.  There still seems to be possible life support conditions inside.  Court reseals the gash in the hatch with the heat of the lascutter, then looks over all of us, shrugging.\n\nWith the comms still out, everyone stares from one to another, confused.  My Lord starts speaking, then quickly remembers the state of communications and stops, his shoulders slumping in annoyance.  The game of charades begins anew, the entire display incomprehensible and frankly uncomfortable.  The best way to get my point across in these conditions would be through clear action.\n\nI stride over to the door, passing between my colleges and firmly grip the wheel controlling the hatch.  Realizing full well I lack the strength to do this myself I put only a moderate amount of effort into the action, so to not needlessly waste my energy.  Against my labours, the lock does not budge.\n\nFollowing what I feel is a reasonable amount of time, I stop my feeble attempt and look directly at my Lord and Court.  I point to them both, then to the door behind me, stepping aside.  The pair exchange a glance, my Lord peeking sideways for a moment towards Zez who usually would have the technology to break open the door.  Sadly, her strong metallic arm, like the comms, has ceased to function correctly as she awkwardly drags her attachments around, unable to fully support them with her natural strength.  Establishing that Zez is in no condition to help this time, my Lord steps in front of the wheel with Court at his side, ready to aid him.\n\nThe rest of us watch as the two of them manage to turn the old rusted wheel, untouched for Emperor knows how long.  The hatch opens, the air inside escaping in torrents, revealing a dark spiral staircase peppered with terrible mould and fungi.  Even with my helmet, I can't help but imagine the rank smell that must be bursting out of the room along with the old, stale air.  All of us step inside, Court remaining at the back commanding the men, leaving about half of them outside the door on guard.  \n\nWith the air lock closed behind us, I start to scan the room inside.  The walls, stairs - everything coated thickly in a sickening green layer of bacteria, allowed to grow in the presence of the synthetic atmosphere.  It is hard to tell one thing from another in the poorly lit conditions, as our group inside looks about, uncertain if they should move.\n\nNot a moment too soon, I hear a faint static tingle in my ear, steadily growing louder, coming from my micro bead.\n\n\"Hello?  Confound it - is this thing on?!\"  I hear my Lord's voice as everything starts sparking to life, lights from the ceiling illuminating through the cobwebs making the putrid mess staining the hall harder to ignore.  Zez straightens up and celebrates the return of all her functions.\n\n\"I think we're back online sir.\" I respond.\n\n\"There must have been some strange interference.\"  Court speculates, looking about at his men.\n\n\"This entire ship is filled with horrible things!\"  Odette exclaims.  \"There's psychic signatures everywhere, I can't pinpoint anything.\"  She points up the staircase.  \"Some *really* nasty things up there though.\"\n\nCourt turns back to Odette.  \"What would we find in the old Navigator tower of worth?  Is there any point going up there?\"\n\nShe thinks for a second.  \"The Navis Primer?  The legend said this ship went all over uncharted space.  It could have co-ordinates to many treasures that no one else knows about.\"\n\n\"If they haven't already been plundered.\"  Court adds, unconvinced.\n\n\"Those charts could give us a much needed edge on their own.\"  I remark.  Treasures or no, having an expansive map of unknown sectors could prove useful.  We have come this far.  \"Let's retrieve them.\"\n\nCourt sends two of his men to scout ahead, while he and my Lord follow side by side up the stairway.  The rest of the troops divide between myself, trailing in the middle of our group, and behind Zez and Odette taking up the rear.  Our footsteps vibrate against the metal, shaking lose the mould as it squishes beneath our feet.  We approach the top of the stairs carefully.  The void suit muffles most sound, the air trapped inside the tower making it possible to identify only noise that is particularly loud.  The slow pace and eerie silence as a result while we travel puts me on edge.\n\nThe scouts are about to move into the top of the tower, when my Lord calls them to stop.  Taking the lasgun from his back he pushes in front, boldly running into the room and away from view.\n\nSir, why do you always put yourself in unnecessary danger?\n\n\"Erm...\" I hear Klaus' voice uncharacteristically meek over the comms.  \"Odette?  Could you get up here please?\"\n\nOdette leans forward, looking for a way up the stairs past Court's grunts.  \"What's up there Captain?\"\n\n\"Cake!\" My Lord exclaims, followed by sound of lasgun fire.\n\nOdette gasps, shoving the soldiers aside, knocking Court out of second place as she hurries off to join Klaus.  Court orders his men to go as Zez and I follow, staying in our chosen positions.  I barely move before I can catch a peek over the top of the ledge, understanding in an instant why my Lord's command lacked his usual lustre.\n\n[Start](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3dfr45/tales_from_a_seneschal_rogue_trader/) | [Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3h4fab/tales_from_a_seneschal_awakening_rogue_trader/) | Next | Last",

        "text": "Had a blast at our weekly DnD Session and just felt I had to write this up!\n\n\nSo, for background - a group of old friends and flatmates get together to kick back and catch up for a few hours: generally just an excuse to spend time together and consume beer, smokes and various candies: it's all very healthy.\n\n\nWe're currently in a homebrew take on Rise of Tiamat, I believe: the campaign with whole lot of meandering sidequests and hilarious diversion thrown in.\n\n\nThe reprobates involved are Thump, a Dwarven tempest cleric who's wise, gruff and dumb as two bricks (INT dumpstat) whose sole goal in life is owning a boat, an Elven paladin who can't resist a bet and prancing around in pretty mithril plate, two rogues, respectively a kelptomaniac arcane trickster Tiefling with dodgy connections to various devils // a poison obsessed Halfling Assassin who enjoys poisoning 'repressive' leaders and a Human Fae/Tome Pact Warlock who's our utility caster and creator of (generally rejected) evil schemes.\n\n\nThe group is fairly experienced by now: having played through the Mines of Phandelver and extracted a 20% ownership stake in their operation, been to a green dragon's black tie birthday party, defeated a small army by inciting a race riot, traveled to the City of Brass, and hijacked an Ice Giant's floating iceberg/keep and crashed it into an invading Orcish horde.\n\n\nSo, they're all level 7 by now.\n\n\nAfter their latest exploit in saving the City of Waterdeep, they've been named 'official adventurers to the city' and been given a nice cottage: and also, by the way, been asked to investigate a huge, failed high magic ritual at the Well of Dragons.\n\n\nGiven this, the party was prompted to investigate the Library of a certain Hallistar Blackstaff, located in the dim, dangerous confines of the undermountain: preparations take place, including prestidigitation to make field medicine go down and our Warlock putting the frightners on one of Blackstaff's descendants.\n\n\nAfter entering the undermountain and many 'checking for traps' later, his library is discovered, complete with ghostly gnome curator and puzzle to prove worthy of it's contents: \"What is Knowledge?\"\n\n\nBrainstorming ensues - 'Power' and 'Understanding' being the obvious two, followed by 'Justified True Belief' and a tangent on the [Gettier Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettier_problem) and how our Warlock *knew* that first year Philosophy paper would come in handy one day.\n\n\nEventually, we settle on ignorance, reasoning that if 'the more you learn, the less you know', **Ignorance Is Knowledge** and many 1984 jokes ensue.\n\n\nThe Plinth stutters and fails, however - leading to a small search for the magical macguffin crystal: which is guarded by a horrid Demon of filth and fury (something beginning with 'N', I forget. Edit: Nalfeshnee) ~ the Warlock's attempt at Banishment fails miserably, and everyone rolls Initiative.\n\n\nSpells are slung, fear checks are passed and then it's our Paladin's turn:\na mighty leap, Misty Step and natural 20 on his Acrobatics check land the elf slap bang atop a towering demon. Success means time to roll attacks: natural 20. Channel divinity, lucky, radiant damage, falling damage and many dice rolls later - 86 Damage.\n\n\nOur cleric goes to cower in the corner, gibbering from horrifying visions and the now flying demon attacks our oh-so-squishy back lines - Hellish Rebuke &amp; a panic 'Misty Escape' and advantage Eldritch Blast finish the job.\n\n\nMacguffin is returned with much backslapping and plot hooks are dangled: deciding for a little more exploration before calling it a night.\n\n\nPitch Dark, oh shit: dark vision and Devil's Sight do their job, though ~ Umber Hulk ambush is responded to! Our Tiefling and main damage dealer (she has a big, scary bow) promptly fail their checks and wander, dazed, towards the two hulks.\n\n\nThinking quick the Warlock successfully casts Polymorph, turning the terrifying hulk into an itty bitty snail: quick check of the rules saying that we can't just *squish* it and be done. Inspiration striking, the snail is thrown into a convenient bag of holding, and shaken loose from their stupor the remaining one is wailed on, hard (it rolled rather low on Initiative).\n\n\nFive minutes of laughing later, and we call it a night.\n\n\nGiven the limited air supply in the bag, and its holding capacity, the group plans to open the bag in a month or so and have the intact hulk preserved. \n\n\nAs a coat rack for their cottage.\n",

        "text": "So, short bit of backstory for context here: Myself and six other fellows had been playing Deathwatch for about five months, and had been having a great time. Killin xenos, purging heretics, the usual stuff for Empy's chosen few. \n\n\nThen in comes a new guy, who we shall call Brad. Brad was a chill guy, never played much 40k before, but was a quick learner and fit in pretty well with the group. Funny thing was that he looked at the array of badass before him and apparently decided that he wanted a more backseat role to ease himself into the group, so he decided to play a techpriest. Not a Techmarine, a techPRIEST. Now, we had a techie before, but he had died after being blown up when his demolitions roll on a Necron reactor hit a 100, and we hadn't had one since. \n\nAfter talking it out our DM decided to allow it, even gave him some freebie points to make himself more utility, and we got on with the game. Long story short, about a month later we all finally hit level 4 (Our DM was a frugal ass on the XP), and because of sheannigins, we were stuck planetside on a dead world, facing down God-Emperor damned ANGRON. \n\nHe took us apart like nobodies business, (In a human(Ish) shape no less), and then, apparently only because we rolled really lucky on a attack that made him bleed for 0.00001 seconds, he decided that he liked the cut of our jibs, and made us an offer to join Chaos. This being rather out of character, as players we were a bit dumbstruck. \n\nHowever, Brad? Brad had been hiding behind a large rock formation the whole fight, as frankly everyone at the table knew his lasgun was going to tickle ANGRON. So while we're all trying to think of a way out of this shit, Brad decides its time to step up. \n\nSo he stealth's out and actually succeeds on the roll to do so, long robes brushing the dirt as he gets right up behind Angron, aaaaaaaaand politely taps on the ten foot tall demon god's hip to get his attention, along with a polite 'Excuse me sir'.\n\nThis apparently is so out of left field that Angron does NOT insatgib Brad, and instead just glares at him, snarling out 'What do you want little machine?'\n\nBrad's response to the DM was 'Okay, Im rolling to attack, called shot.\"\n\nDM: \"Okay, roll initiative.\"\n\nBy the grace of the dice gods, Brad goes first.\n\nDM: \"Alright, where are you hitting him, remember its at a penalty.\"\n\nBrad: \"I want to uppercut him right in the dick.\"\n\nComplete. And utter. Silence.\n\nFollowed soon after by groans and several calls of 'Dude, dont do it, you literally cannot hurt him.\"\n\nBrad asks us to quiet down, this giant shit eating grin all over his face. \"No worries, I have a secret weapon.\"\n\nCue lots of raised eyebrows at this statement. Remember, in-game, Brad is a 5'5, 190 pound guy standing next to the closest mortal incarnation of RAGE in the universe. \n\nWe all think hes as dead as the dodo.\n\nBrad rolls his attack: Natural 1. \n\nAngron rolls his dodge: 94.\n\nThen Brad unveils the cheesiest shit I've ever fucking seen in the game. \n\nTechpriest, lvl 4. Base STR 57\n\nMachinator array +10 STR.\n\n(DM approved) Customized manipulator mechadentrides +40 STR\n\nBase Damage 10.\n\nSynthetic muscle grafts (best quality): Unnatural STR x2\n\nBase damage: 20.\n\nPower Fist (Best Quality) 2d10 SBx2.\n\nBase damage: FUCKING FORTY.\n\nSo yeah, Brad then proceeds to roll 2d10. 10. 10. 8. 4. \n\n72 damage. Jesus fucking christ. Angron ignores 20 of it because of his armor and toughness, but still takes 52 damage to the balls. \n\nSo yeah, six Deathwatch marines, wounded and near death, just watched this little techie dickpunch a demon demigod and shove his whole arm up into the things hips in a shower of blood and bone. \n\nNeedless to say, we all loved the hell out of him afterwards, even if Angron left because the DM was impressed as all hell and didn't want to ruin the moment by having Angron murderize us all. \n\nSo yeah, thats how our newest player managed to fist Angron. \n",

        "text": "This is the story of a run gone wrong. I'm a GM, and a player of mine once commented that their runs always go perfectly, so it encouraged me to write up the time one of my own runs went to complete shit.\n\n___\n\nThe team.\n\nC0D3 M0NK33: My character. An egotistical, impulsive, rude decker. A half Chinese man in his early 20s from Australia, he's undeniably a savant with a cyberdeck, if you can put up with his attitude. He wears a trenchcoat a couple sizes too big for him, and fights with a katana and an [Ares Predator V](http://orig09.deviantart.net/40d5/f/2011/103/8/7/__ares_predator_iv___by_br0uhaha-de0qm2.png). Slung over his back is his cyberdeck, the internal components of the powerful SONY-CIY720 packed into a sleek custom case.\n\nI/O: A second decker brought on in case C0D3 M0NK33 gets distracted by (in the Fixer's words) “a shiny object.” A former corpman, he's considerably calmer and more collected than C0D3 M0NK33 is, but less experienced in the Shadows. His cyberdeck is an implanted Hermes Chariot, pretty standard for corporate IT, and he's armed with a Streetline Special.\n\nShinigami: A young Japanese woman raised from childhood to serve as a Renraku assassin. She is efficient and deadly, but extremely cold, and not above sacrificing her team to accomplish a mission. She wears her long black hair down, and wields a monofilament whip, and is highly skilled in magic.\n\nShiv: A former ork ganger from the Elizabeth barrens in Adelaide. Handy in a fight, but violent and reckless. He fights using a pair of knives, and an assortment of small arms.\n\n___\n\nThe team is contracted by an unknown party to infiltrate the local headquarters of Renraku Computer Systems in Adelaide, and steal some research they've been doing into restructuring AI personalities. The job should be simple. Adelaide is a backwater city in a backwater country, after all, and between C0D3 M0NK33 and Shinigami, the infiltration should be easy. Shiv is only here in case drek hits the fan, and I/O is here because the Fixer forced him on the team, much to their dismay. 30,000 between 4 is a lot less than 30,000 between 3.\n\nStill, everything has been going to plan so far, they're inside, on the 9th floor, they've only killed one guard, and C0D3 M0NK33 had only vandalised half the hallways they'd been through. All in all, this was turning out to be a milk run. Until they had to hack their way through a security door, and C0D3 M0NK33 was busy vandalising some poor sod's computer with some choice images from his... private... folder, so they had I/O do it.\n\nI/O sits down next to the door, plugs himself in, and in a few seconds, shudders, bleeds out through the nose, and faints. Alarms start blaring, and the team draws their weapons, ready for a  fight. Shiv moves I/O out of the potential line of fire, and draws his guns, while C0D3 M0NK33 starts scanning for incoming weapon icons. But, to their horror, none of this arrives. Instead, a team of five men in red armour stride towards them confidently, spouting Japanese.\n\nShinigami immediately erects a barrier, and explains to the overly confident C0D3 M0NK33 and Shiv. Somehow, for some reason, I/O had managed to get the Renraku Red Samurai onto them, and Shinigami was in no mood to fight the best soldiers in the world. So she did the only thing that made sense, turned invisible and legged it away. The mission was failed, now that the Samurai were here.\n\nOf course, C0D3 M0NK33 had to get paid. So he opened fire on the Samurai, not aware of their full capabilities. From what Shinigami had told him, they were Samurai, with swords. C0D3 M0NK33 carries a sword, he'll just duel them.\n\nThe leading samurai draws a grenade, and throws it down the hall. M0NK33 and Shiv dive for cover, forgetting the vulnerable I/O. In a horrific display of gore, I/O's legs are blown off. This is the point when M0NK33 and Shiv realise that they've made a horrible, horrible mistake. Picking up the now considerably lighter I/O, they start to make a run for it, throwing grenades and firing blindly behind them as they flee.\n\nThey make it back to their car, and manage to take I/O to Hakase Katsuro, a friend of C0D3 M0NK33s, and, according to C0D3 M0NK33, a very talented doctor. Katsuro managed to stop the bleeding, but was unable to do anything about the legs, and refused to “just give away” cybernetics to the now crippled decker. He did however administer some primitive prosthetics, allowing him to at least hobble around slowly. This effectively ended his Shadowrunning career.\n\nWith this drastic failure, the team fell apart and drifted their seperate ways.\n\nC0D3 M0NK33 moved to Brisbane, where what started as an illegal cyber chop-shop inadvertantly became the biggest triad in Australia, despite him not actually knowing what a triad was.\n\nI/O became Mike, a fixer, and set up shop in Adelaide. He would occasionally work as an information broker, which brought him into infrequent contact with the others. He remains on good terms with C0D3 M0NK33 and Shiv, but still hates Shinigami, and is apparently working on a plan to assassinate her.\n\nShinigami's skills were highly sought after around Australia. She became a roaming assassin and cleaner, working for anyone with the nuyen.\n\nShiv went back to the barrens, and died shortly after from an infected gunshot wound. He was delivered to Katsuro for treatment, who just harvested his organs and left him to die.\n\n___\n\nSo basically, I/O somehow managed to trigger an alarm and get shot full of biofeedback by a decker. The Renraku always knew they were there, thanks to C0D3 M0NK33 putting his mark on everything he could. They called in a roaming Red Samurai team in an attempt to capture Shinigami. And also Shiv was there. I/O (now Mike) is permanently an NPC, Shiv just retired the character, I still play C0D3 M0NK33 every so often, but now he's \"Mr. Waters\", head of the Jade Dragon Triad, and Shinigami does her own thing mostly nowadays. I use her as an NPC with the player's permission, and she still plays her in her own campaigns.",

        "text": "So the response to my first story, *Life is Too Short for a Bad DM: A Cleric's Beginning or End?*, was better than I expected, so I decided to introduce a series of short stories called *Critical Hits and Shits* which will feature the DM's most memorable moments as well as some adventures after his banishment as they were experienced by 3 adventurers. \n\nThe cast:\n\nRegulator as the paladin who could never fail\n\nWazilla as the *full* drow rogue who could never succeed\n\nDr. Crucible as the cleric who could never even try\n\nDM as the DM\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe scene opens in a small fort on the plains where combat was just about to begin. Something about bad guys killing people or other. Just before initiative is rolled the DM stops everything to introduce to new mechanics that will change D&amp;D as the world knows it. Lootable corpses and feigning death or fake surrendering. \n\nUp until this point any attempt to loot corpses of fallen enemies would result in the item \"turning to poop.\" I'm not even kidding. But hey, at least it's done now, and maybe combat could be freshened up by enemies throwing in some tricks, even if we're expecting them now.\n\nThe paladin and rogue move in to attack from 2 fronts, while the cleric was off somewhere else for some reason. I'm pretty sure I spent more time separated from the party than I did with them, which I found out later was because I was underleveled and the DM wanted to be able to torment me with out the others being able to help. But at least I was on my way now because I somehow knew combat was going down. Most of his explanations were about that vaguely established. \n\nBeginning their flank, the paladin quickly moves into the center of the fort's inner grounds to confront the leader and tell him his life is forfeit for the killing and terrorizing of its innocent inhabitants. Standard paladin routine. On our paladin's turn the leader drops his axe and drops to his knee. He surrenders in a snarky old English accent, 1 of about 3 accents the DM could do. The paladin is glad that he's willing accepted his fate and uses his turn to execute the kneeling foe.\n\nThe DM clearly was caught off guard. After stammering for about a minute while processing this somehow unpredicted course of action, he exclaims very loudly that the leader throws sand at the paladin. Regulator argued that it was his turn and that he was using his turn to make this man's torso more aerodynamic and that the leader kneeling was just co signing his own death warrant. The DM ignores him and rolls anyway, but as 25 didn't beat the paladin's reflex, he dodges. The leader stands up and picks up his axe...still on the paladin's turn. Finally getting a chance to do something on his own turn, the paladin strikes and kills the leader in one hit. So much for anything resembling a boss fight.\n\nMoving on to the rogue. He comes around more sneaky beaky, jumping between the shadows of the building's balconies that surrounded the square, rather than charge the center. Pretty standard rogue things. He whips a dagger at an archer above, dealing 3 damage and the DM describes the archer as falling off the roof dead. Having killed enough people to know that dagger alone wouldn't kill someone, he moves in to slit the archer's throat while he's prone.\n\n\"You walk away.\" the DM declares. Not even you move on to the next enemy. Just walking away. Wazilla naturally argued, insisting that even if it wasn't clear the DM was faking, his rogue would still know through experience that hit wasn't lethal. To which the DM just replied \"No, you walk away.\" over and over. After insisting until Wazilla gave up arguing, a process taking 5 actual minutes, he takes it as agreement. \n\n\"Once you walk away he shoots you in the back, you take 6 damage!\" he nearly brags and acts smug about \"tricking\" the player. The rogue turns back to the enemy who then \"bleeds out.\" Attempting to say he goes to slit his throat *now* is only met by the familiar \"No, you walk away.\" We then came to a realization. This wasn't a mechanic. This was our life now.\n\nEnter the cleric. While those 2 struggled through a group that was flopping at a slightly higher rate than the average soccer team, the cleric used to the cover of night to shoot from the cover of darkness. With a nat 20, his movements were one with the shadows of night. You know, standard cleric...wait, nevermind. Undetected and with a clear shot of a man with a spear on the roof, he lined up his 2 hand crossbows (which he didn't actually have any feats for, but never took penalties on) and pulled both triggers. Two nat 1s. Both of them jam up. Deciding that wasn't enough suffering, the DM makes me roll a bluff check to yell at the man that I got him.\n\nUsing the spear that was now acquainted with his chest cavity, he became the first and only player character to perform and succeed feigning death. With his cover intact again, the cleric spent the rest of the fight fixing his crossbows.\n\nAfter we finished fighting the mechanics and the occasional enemy, we looked over the now lootable bodies. Somehow, taking a few shitty short swords that didn't immediately turn to poop felt good, even if they were much worse than most of what we had. Although even those would have been better than the cleric's Chaos Mace... but that's a story all it's own.\n\nAs for the mechanics, the looting stayed in place while the feigning and faking were fortunately never seen again.",

        "text": "[WELCOME AND HELLO YES THIS IS MORE SILLY STORIES! Where we last left off STUFF HAPPENED](https://redd.it/3eka4y) let's get to the story. Our characters today are Pratena the punchy cyclops, Rose the dullahan ranger, and Barrel the halfling rogue.\n\nWe begin in a large, grassy area straight from the pages of every goddamn fantasy book ever, or maybe ireland. This was way the hell off the grid, far from anywhere that most people consider \"civilized\". The sheep probably outnumbered the sentient creatures in the area. And speaking of sheep, the party's mission was to go investigate some xenophobic town of humans that had managed to survive by murdering the fuck out of everything that wasn't one of them. But no, the xenophobia wasn't the problem, the problem was that the town was acting rather strange. This was not clarified in the mission briefing.\n\nSo there they were, a dullahan, a cyclops, and a halfling, marching towards south bumblefuck to see why the rednecks weren't lynching people properly. They were down a member since their rather inane magus decided to screw off and mess with a coliseum for the foreseeable future. And, at about that time, they stumble into a random human dude that just happened to be in the area, happened to be a good character class, and happened to be around their level. [WHAT ARE THE ODDS](http://imgur.com/a/NAcjS). Mister Token Human the druid was in the area investigating somesuch and gathering macguffin leaves to cure the insidious offscreen disease that had taken his friend, Simon Sicklypants. But long story short this nature-loving idiot and the merry band of murderhobos were both there for the same reason- to find out what in the fargblasting flibbertygibbet was going on in that town of wonders.\n\nAs they discovered upon entering, quite a lot. The place was stuck in a perpetual state of mardi gras, complete with the violent mood swings and daylight suicides. The party didn't even have to try very hard to disguise themselves, despite the fact that only one of them was human- something had grabbed the delicate machinery of these people's brains and stuck its nefarious dick in it. Shit was not okay. It became even less okay when Looney, the town mayor, held a public announcement where he decreed that the horrible monsters confining them in the city's (half-finished) walls would be exterminated by a group of horrible monster mercenaries, who were trustworthy because cash buys anything and on a totally unrelated note the treasury is now totally empty whoops. BUT GOOD NEWS NOW THAT THEY'RE HERE THEY'RE GOING TO SWEEP THE CITY AND PURGE ALL THE NON-HUMANS!\n\nOkay, so maybe this doesn't sound like a huge deal. Maaaybe this sounds like just another day dealing with sellswords who turn out to be cowardly self-interested asshats, which is practically a job requirement of being a sellsword. But nope. Mayor Looney had gotten the best. And I don't mean the best of the common rabble, I mean the best of the continent. Quite possibly, the best on the entire goddamned WORLD. The kind of asskicking adventurers who kill CR 25 monsters for fun. A group of four of them had just shown up in an airship made of solid gold (YES, REALLY) and proceeded to show that they meant fucking business. Three mercs spread out to go searching for nonhumans, leaving the ringleader, an Efreeti, advancing right up to the party and taking a close look at all those paper masks labeled \"hooman plz ignor\". Maybe they shouldn't have had Pratena, surname orc, doing the writing.\n\nAnyway, the party correctly surmised that just running would be a bad idea, and decided to play it smooth... except Pratena who rabbited while nobody was looking. Barrel was being a Barrel, TokenHuman (the new druid, remember him?) was sweating buckets, and Rose had collapsed into scattered bits of armor (I AM NOT ALIVE GO AWAY). Seeing as the only one present was, well, a druid, the Efreeti very reasonably asked why the hell he was claiming ownership of metal armor. TokenHuman was NOT good at smooth-talking, and Mister Efreeti kindly informed him that he would be confiscating the armor.\n\nSo Barrel panicked and stabbed him in the ankle. Nobody fucks with Barrel's friends. But this pissed the Efreeti right the fuck off- who'da thought? Pratena was a distance away, Rose was disassembled, TokenHuman was waffling about trying to murder guys who were just doing their job, and Barrel was going full rogue on Efreeti's ass. Efreeti turned invisible, Barrel nailed him with a smog pellet. Efreeti shot fire, Barrel returned with alchemist's ice. TokenHuman then decided to be useful, and blasted the Efreeti with a bunch of Druid Water^^TM that created a huge steam cloud. Frustrated and outnumbered now, Efreeti decided to light everything on fire and fuck off by turning to smoke. Barrel declared victory while Rose and Pratena helped put out the flaming TokenHuman.\n\nThe party decided that subtlety was the thing to do, so of course Pratena and Rose decided that the next step of their master plan was to start a prank war. With the guy that they had just crippled. Using RANGER TRACKING, they followed mister Efreeti back to his bolthole, an abandoned house, and found out that he was receiving medical attention from a teammate, another halfling rogue. So they barricaded the door and dropped a beehive down the chimney. The hilarity was only slightly dampened by their target being CONSTANTLY ON FIRE and thus IMMUNE TO BEES, but it ratcheted up to the normal level when they replaced the angry insects with a tiny zappy thundercloud that chased them around the room. Good times.\n\nExcept now they had one INCREDIBLY irate merc on their hands, who could probably slit their throats without much difficulty. They had to beat a discrete retreat, and Rose had chosen urban habitats as a favored terrain. Thus, the hilariously unstealthy dullahan was the one who could dodge capture easily, and the tireless cyclops powerhouse was the one who had to worry about being tracked down. This led to a scooby doo style chase scene, culminating in the two diving under a bridge while the merc rogue called in backup, in the form of a scary-powerful alchemist. The alchemist dropped a couple of well-placed bombs, or rather, depth charges. The USS Rose was blasted out of her hiding spot, and they were forced to leave town or fight against two opponents that could easily double their damage output. They wisely chose the former option.\n\nMEANWHILE, team Int &gt; 10 decided to do ACTUAL investigation. They quickly discovered the cause of everyone in town going fucking batshit crazy- a sort of psychic mist hanging over everything, driving everyone insane. Its effects weren't limited to humans, and there appeared to be no saving throw, so leaving a bunch of powerful mercenaries to stew in it for a while was high on the list of Very Bad Things. And, while Team Punchy was not the most subtle, they provided a SPECTACULAR distraction so that investigation could go on relatively unmolested.\n\nThus, Barrel and TokenHuman played the world's stupidest game of Hot and Cold, following the general trail of spooky magic shit right into the hangout of the fourth and final mercenary- a Banshee. But Barrel was on his A-game today, and she was spotted before she could close in on them. Barrel went one way, and TokenHuman bolted another... straight into the lap of Looney the mayor. Did I mention he was a high-level wizard? He totally was. And he had just met someone who he'd NEVER SEEN in the ONLY HUMAN HABITAT FOR HUNDREDS OF MILES, FUNNY THAT. TokenHuman then decided to employ his MASTERFUL SMOOTH TALK once more, thus degrading the situation from \"Imminently Deadly\" to \"Kill Me Now\", because one of the defining features of Loons is that they LOVE to talk. TokenHuman had to make several will saves vs sonic sleep effect. However, he was able to extract a bit of information from the vociferous imbecile, discovering that whatever the source of the spooky shit was, it was over in *that* general direction. Immediately after he passed this information along to Barrel, he failed a save vs terminal boredom and lost consciousness.\n\nBarrel received this info and immediately sprang into action, searching the indicated \"over there\" and discovering that yep, the plot-o-meter was beeping wildly. Given a choice of three targets, he decided to break into the fancy-looking townhouse. LOONEY'S fancy-looking townhouse. Well, whatever, the idiot was still talking to TokenHuman so he'd be away for a while. Barrel then proceeded to bullshit past the guards by pretending to be a chimneysweep (\"What chimneys?\") and then using some skulduggery and a swift boot to the ass to get them all on the nice, non-inside part of the giant and totally unnecessary drawbridge. Then he leapt into Mayor Loonie's bedroom, to discover that the old bastard was somehow STILL HOME.\n\n\"Hullo, I'm Rooney, Looney's identical twin brother! Are you a burglar?\"\n\nBarrel responded in the obvious manner, winning initiative and tackling the old git, then holding his knife to the wizard's mustache. Rooney was obviously quite distressed, as his barber's appointment wasn't until next century, and he was easily persuaded to ramble some information about how a mysterious but apparently benign magical energy had been hanging around ever since they dug that old well- \"WELP NICE MEETING YOU TAKING YOUR MUSTACHE BUHBYE\" and Barrel was out the front door, glorious wizardly facial hair in hand.\n\nAaaand straight into the waiting Banshee merc and her cheery sunlight-blocking parasol, who had noticed the drawbridge commotion and came to see what was up. Smooth talk had no effect, as she was not the brains of the operation and was savvy enough to know it, so battle quickly commenced with Madame Banshee completely humiliating Barrel in terms of initiative. She blinded Barrel, then reached out with a spectral hand and CRIT FAILED THE ATTACK. Barrel, thanking every god ever that he'd invested in a ring of Blindsense, smelled a losing battle on his hands. He promptly stabbed up the banshee's parasol and followed up with some nifty alchemical bombs... right as Looney and Rooney both entered the scene from different sides. Looney was holding the unconscious TokenHuman, and Rooney was screaming something about mustache thieves. Barrel tackled TokenHuman, slapped him into consciousness, and convinced him that \"away\" was a good direction to go, courtesy of one Air Walk spell.\n\nMeanwhile, Pratena and Rose were coming back from their brief exodus. Then, in a truly unfair roll of the dice, managed to spot the sneaky merc rogue that had been harassing them out in the open, not noticing them, and carrying a sack full of explosives (that she was distributing in the form of land mines). Rose and Pratena thought quickly- Rose took out a bolt, casted named bullet on it, and handed it to Pratena... Pratena lit it on fire and sent it streaking straight towards the merc rogue, charged with one Ki Arrow.\n\nShe rolled a 2.\n\nThe bag of explosives was whipped out of the merc's hands, landing with incredible force in the wall of some cozy-looking building, whereupon the entire bag detonated in a cloud of fire, shrapnel, and deadly poison (the bombs were all made by the poisonous merc alchemist). The merc rogue rushed into the building to lend assistance... Rose and Pratena put on innocent expressions and quietly left. The party met up, exchanged info, and tracked the source of the insanity mist (which DOES NOT EXCUSE YOUR ACTIONS BY THE WAY, YOU GUYS ARE FUCKING SOCIOPATHS) to a nearby ~~plot~~ hole. The town was using the damn thing as a garbage dump. Oh, and the irate Banshee merc was blocking their entry. Whoops. The banshee accused the party of being fucking assholes who crippled one friend, blew up another, and humiliated her. [Pratena, who got the blunt of the accusation, acted like the giant thirteen-year-old she was and devolved into an argument with Barrel, who grounded her and berated her while the infuriated banshee demanded to be paid proper attention](http://i.imgur.com/cL36WgM.jpg). Eventually she gave up and attacked.\n\nNow, the party was hilariously outclassed here. Like, supremely. The first thing that happened was the banshee successfully hitting everyone with slow, and then following up with nasty fear spells. But, with all of their combined single actions, they ~~formed captain planet~~ came up with a clever ruse to stall while TokenHuman saved the day with Flaming Orb. Druids can make sunlight if they prepare the right spells (TokenHuman had not), and the banshee, for all her badassitude, was fairly gullible. Thus, with some help from a Named Bullet, spark cantrips and some handy alchemist's fire, they managed to convince the banshee that they had their own miniature sun that they could call up whenever they liked, disrupting all of her attacks. She fled, and the party piled into the pit.\n\nThere, the party found the source of their troubles... at the bottom of this pit was a captive Shoggoth! The damn thing had fallen in there forever ago, and was hibernating until some human dipshits stumbled upon the entrance to its pit and started hucking garbage down onto it. The thing was half-staved and COMPLETELY raving, insisting in several Languages That Should Not Be that it be released. The situation was NOT helped by the arrival of mayors Looney and Rooney via teleport, who both started going glassy-eyed and bleeding from the ears. Culprit found and confirmed, now what the hell to DO about it? TokenHuman calmed the thing down with some food spells, and everyone sort of ignored the fussy mayors (still searching for that vile Mustache-stealing fiend, who was currently disguised as a booze barrel on Pratena's hip). Eventually it was decided that it was a creature of... well, if not nature then at least it was alive and somewhat intelligent. And if the party had to go back and kill it later, whatever, that was their job and stuff.\n\nThus, through a bit of verbal misdirection, the party convinced the L'rooney mayors to teleport the damn thing somewhere into the ocean, and bam, problem solved! The mayors congratulated themselves on getting rid of that \"pile of unsightly but strangely verbose garbage\" and insisted everyone be invited over for tea. Apparently the fact that their \"guests\" were all nonhumans did not occur to their thoroughly pureed brains. Oh, and at about that moment, a furious (and rather singed) merc rogue dropped into the hole. Did I mention there was no way out? Kinda important.\n\nAn argument ensued, with TokenHuman once more trying to smooth things over with his impressive diplomacy of 7. When this *somehow* didn't work and things devolved, the Mayors decided they were done being ignored and casted Feeblemind on both parties. Both TokenHuman and the merc rogue failed the save. Thus, the day was once more saved by making the belligerent guy shit his pants and scream \"DURR\". Except that now it was a chorus. With that, mayors L'rooney teleported everyone back to their lovely townhouse for some spiffing tea. Incidentally, it also made an excellent neutral ground for the pissed-off mercs to come discuss their grievances with the party. Thus, heated words were exchanged, sinister plots were explained, TokenHuman tried to bite a teacup, and Rose spoon-fed crumpets to the drooling merc rogue. Crumpets is crunk.\n\nEventually it was decided that the mercs, who were goddamned PROFESSIONALS, would not deviate from their binding contract (Efreetis take that shit seriously). The contract to keep the pithy human town \"safe and secure\" for the duration. Well, seeing as the average man was still acting like a manic-depressive soccer rioter and the mayors L'rooney were staring at a wall and repeating the word \"spiffing\" over and over, there was only one way that was going to happen. So, the banshee made a wish on the Efreeti, and the whole town (including the party) fell asleep for a month- a nice, safe month that let the gods-damned insanity aura dissipate properly and neatly exceeded the timeline of the mercs' contract. After that, it was a simple matter of trading the not-particularly-hostage rogue back to the mercs in exchange for a ride on their freakin' sweet airship. As a bonus, TokenHuman (in all of his retard glory) tripped across the table and slapped a hand onto the Efreeti's leg, healing it by magic.\n\nThis was a big deal. But it was also something they couldn't exactly ask TokenHuman about, seeing as he was still trying to lick his nose. Instead, they beat a hasty retreat before the mayors L'rooney woke up and remembered that they really liked being xenophobic jackasses, taking the mercs up on their part of the bargain- riding home on one freakin' sweet airship, with built-in minifridge and jaccuzi.\n\nNEXT TIME ON \"What the fuck is a flibbertygibbet\", I COME FROM A LAND DOWN UNDER AND WHY DO I HAVE ANTLERS?",
