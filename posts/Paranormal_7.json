        "text": "The reason why I'm posting this is because recently there was an incident after which I started to get flashbacks. \n\nThe incident is at it follows: I was in the bathroom doing my nighttime routine (washing my face, brushing my teeth, all that) and I heard a sort of animalistic and agressive growl right next to my ear. This was like a week or more ago, and all I could do was pretend I didn't hear it, I didn't even mention it to my mother, as I usually would, for some reason I was (and am) just a little scared that something will happen if whatever it was knows that I actually heard it. Even typing this, I'm scared it's reading over my shoulder. \n\nWhich brings me to the next point: we're in a spanish speaking country, even if it were reading over my shoulder (assuming the other side works like ours?) it wouldn't be able to understand, sure, but that thought also reminded me of a time years ago when learning korean became my fixation (languages are sort of my thing, and I tend to hyperfixate on them and learn them quickly), and not long after, when I could read and write and understand the utmost basics, I found something like \"가름다\" written on my bathroom's wall. It looked like someone had just ran their wet finger through the tile, you could only see it if you stood a certain way and the light hit it just right, but it was absolutely, undeniably there. I didn't clean the tile for days, just to make sure.\n\nKeep in mind I was just learning, I had no idea what that meant, still don't. I remember I googled it back then and it came to something like \"it's okay\", but we all know that google translate can't be trusted. This incident particularly bothers me, if anyone here knows korean can you tell me if that's even a real word?\n\nFor the most part, in the great majority of the incidents, I always try to act calm, like I'm not scared or anything, but it's been a while since something like that happened. Recently it's more like I remember that I forgot to turn off the lights downstairs and when I go to do just that they're already off, so I can't deny I'm a little... fidgety about it. \n\nSince I was a child I was generally a scaredy-cat, sure, but nothing compared to that ugly sensation when nighttime came and I was home. It wasn't even about being alone or accompanied, though being alone obviously made it worse, but it was nothing like when I spent time in my grandpa's house and I was alone, it was just different and scary. \n\nThere have been a few other incidents of course, but that'd make the post too long.\n\nI've tried things like praying and even cleaning my room with holy water, but I don't know, this has gone of my whole life, I'm not as scared as I used to be when I was a child, but still, I don't know what else I could do.",

To keep this short, I kept feeling this sensation of being stalked. By the windows, the door, and particularly with a vivid sniffing sound at the bottom of the garage door which was propped open by an inch. When I left, something picked up and dropped a bunch of boards behind the shed.\n \n Now for the part that bothers me, I had a strange dream last night. Dreams after incidents like this aren't uncommon and usually somewhat clear. But last night, I fell asleep. I opened my eyes looking up and saw the sun shining through murky, green water. I looked down and saw myself on my knees before an alter in a church with no roof, walls, or pews. I felt that my head, which is full of hair past my shoulders, was shaved. I tried to look up and see what stood before me at the alter and before I could see anything I woke up. I don't know what it means and it's left me with this uneasy feeling I can't shake. Anyone have any advice?",

        "text": "When I was growing up I was very close with my maternal grandparents. I called them Mama and Tata (mother and father... that's what I heard my mom call them and assumed it was their names when I was about a year old). When speaking of them I still refer to them this way till today.\n\nTata passed away from a stroke when I was 9 years old, and I never got to say goodbye. My mom didn't think such small children should see their grandparent in such a state in the hospital.   \nAbout 15 years ago Mama's health was failing. She was in a coma for a couple of weeks, then she recovered and there was even talk of sending her home with a nurse.   \nKnowing Mama, since I was very close with her, I knew she would hate that. She was very independent and she wouldn't like to have someone help her with anything. I felt dread. A few days later she went back into a coma. The doctors said there was very little chance she would recover.\n\nMy parents and I were living in a different country from Mama at that time. My mom decided she would go and visit her (and her sister who was taking care of Mama) and asked me if I wanted to go as well.  \nAlthough I really wanted to go and see Mama one last time, I decided not to go for two reasons. One reason being it was summer vacation and I had just gotten a job at a summer camp (rent needs to be paid). But the main reason being that Mama always told me not to waste my money on travelling for sad occasions, only for happy ones (there was an incident years before, I don't remember what it was, but the lesson stuck with me). So I knew she wouldn't like me to waste so much money on a plane ticket to come and see her as she's dying. \n\nAbout a week goes by, and one night I'm lying in bed, trying desperately (and failing) to fall asleep. It was one of those night where you keep looking at the clock, repeatedly thinking \"if I fall asleep riiiight now, I will have this much time to sleep before I have to go to work\".   \nIt just wasn't happening so I gave up, just laid in my bed, on my back and stared at the ceiling. \n\nI blink. \n\nI'm standing on the beach, near Mama's house. I can feel the breeze, I can smell and hear the ocean and the seagulls, I can feel the sun on my face. I turn around slowly and about 20 feet in front of me stands Mama, smiling at me. Then, she turns around to face away from me and we both see my grandfather (Tata) standing just behind her. They walk towards each other, smiling, they hug and kiss and have the most heartfelt reunion I have ever seen. Tata passed away when I was just 9 years old, nearly 20 years prior to that day. I stare in awe.   \nAfter what seemed like a few minutes my grandparents both turn to look at me. They are holding hands, smiling, tears of joy streaming down their faces, they are just glowing. They wave to me goodbye with air kisses and smiles still on their faces, turn around and start walking away from me and slowly fade.\n\nI open my eyes and I'm in my room, lying in my bed, on my back, staring at the ceiling. Tears running down my face. I knew at that moment two things. One, Mama passed. Two, I will not be falling asleep that night. The clock on my phone, on my bedside table, read 4:00 am. \n\nThe next few hours are a bit of a blur since I had been inconsolable, couldn't stop crying.   \nMy phone rang at 8:00 am. It was my dad telling me that Mama had passed.   \nI asked him if he knew what time it was when she passed. He told me in their country it was 11:00 am. \n\nThe time difference between our time zones is exactly 7 hours (they are ahead).\n\nI must stress this wasn't a dream. I never actually fell asleep. I didn't feel tired at all that night, not before and definitely not after the vision. I wasn't even sure which flair to add to this post. \n\nEither way, I'm so grateful to Mama and Tata for this wonderful memory. For the love that I felt from them that day. They went out of their way to come see me to say goodbye before moving on.   \nI will remember that for as long as I live.",

        "text": "When I was 12 I decided to follow God myself as a lifestyle instead of being religious and going to church just because my parents do. So I been studying the Bible and I started have weird paranormal happen, one is my sister woke me up once and we both saw a huge green orb, and I read stories of small ones years later but this one was a guess around 1 feet in height and width and was just glowing from inside the orb. Inside the orb was like something was fluttering or something was moving inside it but I never saw it again so I never was able to go and take a closer look. Unfortunately I’m most time the type to go investigate what is that noise and such when I’m not supposed to. I realized I’m the typical girl from movies that is likely to be murdered. Also another time I finally got over my fear of the dark at 12 too and I went to get water and when I was heading to my room, I saw a huge dark figure in front of my door. I thought it was my dad and I called out a few time saying “Dad?” but it wasn’t replying. My dad wasn’t 7 feet tall and so I walked and it wasn’t my shadow, my shadow was separated from it and when I got closer it was 3d and had no face and it’s arm was to the side as if it flexing or something to make it look wider.  I was about 3 inches right in front of it and my hand slowly moved to the left to turn on the lights and I felt no fear and then I turned on the lights and it disappeared and that’s when fear struck me and I fell down and started praying and crying. Now I’m 22 and scared of dark still. Also at 12, I used to be really fit and was very determined to wake up at 5am and run one mile in my backyard and I did that every 5am until one time I was running and right by the fence on my neighborhood side I heard a sound that was not human or an animal, it’s was like a snake, cat, dog all chocking on each other but wasn’t separate but like combined together and I unfortunately have a thing where I get scared I freeze and can’t move and I found that out when I clicked a link and a scary lady face popped out ans I was twitching and unable to move probably for 10 mins( yes I was very disappointed when I learned of my survival skills) but this time I ran and I ran inside and I fell into the couch and I couldn’t look at glass door and all I can do is cry and stutter when my parents woke up to ask what’s wrong with me for hours. Now I’m deadly afraid to be in my backyard or at night. I’m sure it’s likely just demons were attacking me because they didn’t want me to have a relationship with God because when I screamed all the evil things in the house to leave when nobody was home and stopped reading the Bible, it all stopped but I started reading Bible years ago again but was very little and now I’m going to read way more and been doing so and afraid but imma be strong. But when I was 12 to like 16 I was able to see like dark shadow around a person or a light around a person which I assumed darker the light around a person meant they were lost like they were more problems in their life because most of those dark shadows were on people I knew that did drugs and didn’t have their life in order. I also used to be believe I had a guardian around me because I heard a voice as if someone next to me say run and I looked around to see who said it and it literally was nobody around me. Also felt sometimes like someone was pushing me from my back. But all of these stuff stopped when I was almost 17 and didn’t listen to the voice and then I couldn’t see anything like that again. But I did years later endure ton of trauma from people like narcissistic and etc. I do not want to go into to it because my brain physically hurts and my memory seems to dwindle some reason and it feels like a fog whenever I try remembering. I’m in happy place rn, I feel like I got my life a bit back into order and the right people around to keep me from going to somewhere or talking to people that might damage me. But also in the past when I was 12 me and my sister went to a place that my church was renting for a office for a short term, ( years later found out used to be for delusional people, not mental hospital but people that were actually crazy and not suicidal or drugges and they were there until they died )but at 12 I never felt comfortable there, I always felt eerie and so did my sister and my sister and dad saw a 7 feet bird with wings open outside the office window because it’s literally next to the forest jungle looking thing in California. And the window was facing the forest. Awhile my dad did his paperwork , me and my sister snuck down the halls and were creeped out and we didn’t know why and so we went down the stairs with a heavy door and there was a bug and we were grossed out and we hopped over it and when we opened the door we were on the side of the building and my sister ran into the thick bushes of the forest, and I ran after her cause why not and then we heard my dad calling and my sister that was ahead of me ran back and I ran forward abit more and I stopped because there was a big drop with a river below and I looked to the left where the building should be because it literally was only like 6 feet away but for like I could see was just a forest jungle so thick and literally no building but I could see through all leaves on my left was probably for like over 20 feet of river going for miles or whatever and right in front of me across the river was a sandbank which lights from 10 or more different direction was hitting through the leaves from above and hitting the sand and the sand with lights or no light looked like they were diamonds and they were sparking and like glistening and a bird that looked like a flamingo but was brown and had a very short fat beak. Then I felt my arm get pulled and it was my sister saying our dad is calling for us and so we ran back and I asked my sister about it many times throughout years and she claimed she never saw it and maybe she didn’t go that far but when I ran after her she was only like 2 feet ahead of me so I’m confused. But I always felt compelled to go look for it and I did once but what I found wasn’t a thick bush and there was no river and it was hideous and I felt disappointed and I don’t understand and maybe I went to the wrong bush. I wish I ran inside and went abit futhur but now I feel like it’s too late and yes I used to have moments where things moved and I once had a huge speaker on the wall fall on my head when I went down the stairs and felt like a light pat, I did get used to the stuff being moved and got annoyed by it because I went to garage and I saw a toolbox perfectly away from edge and when I was across the room the toolbox was shoved and spilled everywhere and my parent thought I did it but I told them it was the ghost and they think I scared them by saying so. My brain staring to hurt again so bye bye and I like to know if people had situation similar or if they know what anything of these was.",

        "text": "I experience some really weird shit when I sleep. I'm not sure how much of it is paranormal, and how much is broken brain. Have any of you had both and been able to tell the difference? If so, what are your tells?\n\nScience wise, the TLDR of my disorder is that I'm missing a neurotransmitter that regulates the circadian rhythm. Functionally I get little to no slow-wave restorative sleep because REM sleep interrupts it (and sometimes even while I'm awake.) My sleep study showed more than 30 awakenings in 7 hours, and I thought I slept relatively well that night. \n\nLess science, more experience: as long as I can remember, I've had wildly vivid dreams. (Mind, this is upwards of 30 years now.) Most are lucid. Many nightmares, some very graphic beyond any movie I've seen. I'm almost never in my own body. I can tell you firsthand, that old tale about dying in your dreams = dying irl isn't true. I often wake with phantom pain from where I was hurt in a dream, but no redness/ scratches/ bruising to show for it, and the pain fades in a minute or two. \n\nVery few of my dreams are precognitive, but I've had a handful (even a stopped clock is right twice a day, though.) I've had dreams of watching the world end. I've dreamt of not-human things I can't describe. I repeatedly dream of the same scenery, places I've never been IRL. I also think I might have accidentally astral projected a couple of times (unsure as I didn't perceive a cord.) \n\nThe sleep paralysis is a thing unto itself. My brain doesn't \"switch gears\" well, so I get a lot of experiences rolled into one. Hallucinations, pareidolias and Exploding Head Syndrome are all near daily for me. Some are actually pretty cool, some are terrifying enough to throw off my whole day. I can recount a few if there's interest. \n\nSpiritually speaking I lean skeptic but curious. I'm living proof that lack of sleep screws with perception in really insidious ways. However I'm the only one in my family with this disorder, while Mom's entire side has similarly vivid, lucid dreams. I had a brother who died as an infant years before I was born, and there's talk that it's related to that, like I'm picking up on a far away frequency. \n\nFor those of you patient enough to read that whole wall of text, what's your take? How much potentially paranormal : garden variety chemical imbalance? Anyone else have a similarly tenuous relationship with sleep/ dream state?",

        "text": "before going into more details i would like to apologize for any errors or mispelling since english isn't my first language\n\nso i've been experiencing sleep paralysis for a few years now, ever since my junior year of high school. it did scare me a lot in the beginning, but aside from the physical feeling of not being able to move for a while, i never had any type of hallucination. at some point, i got so used to having sleep paralysis that it didnt scare me as much as it did before, it mostly happens when i sleep on my back, so i would just wait for a moment and then turn over and sleep on my side, although it feels like i need to use every ounce of power in my body. i dont really know how to explain it\n\nbut then i started to hear odd things whenever i had sleep paralysis, and it started to feel weird. i have too many experiences to tell but i'll just share the most memorable ones:\n\n\\-i was traveling with my sister and my dad back in 2021, along with his best friend and his two daughters. we rented a summer house and i dont think i've had as much sleep paralysis experiences in my life than i had in that house. i couldn't sleep almost every single night for some reason, or everytime i would start to doze off, i would either have a nightmare that would wake me up right away or start hearing noises near my ear that would wake me up. one night, while (barely) sleeping i heard the distinct sound of girls giggling and laughing loudly. when i opened my eyes, i couldnt move for a while, before getting up to check if maybe it was the daughters of my dad's friend. but when i checked their room, they were asleep. the next night, i heard plates shattering, like someone was wreaking havoc in the kitchen and breaking stuff. i woke up terrified, and went to check again, but everyone was asleep. there was another time in that house when i felt like someone was playing with my hair while i was asleep. i was half-conscious but felt like something was wrong, but when i opened my eyes, i couldn't move. now the last night was the one that scared me the most, i was very much asleep this time when i heard knocking in the window behind me. i opened my eyes, and couldn't move once again, when i heard a deep voice say something like \"bonsoir\" (good evening). i was petrified and couldn't even scream, i could barely make any sound, i was trying so hard to wake my sister or my dad up. when i could finally move, i started panicking and hyperventilating to the point where i had to sleep next to my dad because i was so terrified, at the grown age of 20.\n\n\\-one time i was sleeping in my bed, when i opened my eyes i couldn't move (again) and saw something that looked like my mom's thigh in front of me. i thought that maybe she came to sleep next to me sometime in the night, so i tried to pinch her thigh to let her know that i cant move, as i was trying to scream but couldnt make any sound. then there was like a growing shadow on the wall that was taking the form of a person and i was absolutely convinced that it was death coming after me, so i tried to pinch her thigh harder as i was completely and utterly terrified. but then, i actually opened my eyes, and realized that my mom wasn't next to me, i was alone in my bed, there was no shadow whatsoever, but i had a LOT of scratches on my legs and calves. im assuming that i scratched myself in my sleep as i was very anxious.\n\n\\-one night, i was simply asleep, on the side, facing the wall. i was half-conscious and heard someone say \"goodnight\" dinstinctively. i thought that was my mom since she checks up on me almost every night when im asleep. but then i heard it a second time, and thought that i should turn around to tell her the same thing, but when i did, no one was there. i was so sleepy that i didn't think much of it and went back to sleep. the same night, while i was sleeping, i got woken up by the sound of my window opening. i turned on the light and saw that it was slightly opened, and i never keep my window open. once again i thought that maybe i forgot to close it so i was getting ready to fall back asleep when i felt like someone sat right next to me and i could almost feel breathing in front of my face. that's when i actually got petrified and couldn't move. i think this was the scariest one so far, since i wasnt paralyzed in my sleep.\n\ndo you think all of these are simply auditory/visual hallucinations or something else? does anyone have similar experiences? pls tell me",

        "text": "I recently started college and moved into one of the dorm halls on campus. The room I'm in has space for two people where the beds are divided by a wall, and there's also two fairly big sliding closet mirrors facing each other right in the entryway of the door. That alone gives me the creeps. \n\nIn the first term of school, everything went by fairly smooth besides the random feeling that I was being watched or that something was about to touch the back of my neck. My desk is right across from the entrance so my back is towards the door most nights while I study, and at night I have to have a light facing it because something about it being in the dark between those mirrors seems wrong. \nI would see the occasional glimpse of something small out of the corner of my eye but usually just brushed it off as my imagination.\n\nWinter break came around and I went home for the holiday, and the week after I came back for winter term, I went out to dinner with some of my friends. My roommate had also left not long before me to go and get her ears pierced so no one was in the dorm room. When I came back, everything on my desk was turned upside down, water bottles, medication, perfume bottles, my laptop, and even a wooden ancher I painted and put on my wall was hanging upsidedown. I felt absolutely violated because someone had touched my things and due to a tramatic event in my past this particular thing made me spiral emotionally. My roommate was back before me and I asked her if she or one of her friends did it and she seemed just as confused as I was. I still don't know who did it to this day, and it really could have been one of them, but I really don't know.\n\nShe recently moved out because we just didn't quite click as roommates and she found a new roommate with common interests as her. Since she's been gone more things have been happening but in milder reactions.\n\nFor example, I'll feel like somethings standing in a specific part of the room watching me and it'll feel different at times, sometimes it's like a child stare other times its just something unsettling. I'll be lying in bed and I'll hear what seems like someone sliding off of the other bed (this happened to me last night, I had to get up and check just in case). I'll hear deep breaths as if someones slightly snoring, and my lamp has turned on by itself a few times.I'll even see random shadows out of the corner of my eye. One of the creepiest things that's happened to me so far is when I was folding my laundry and putting them into piles on my bed, I had a really loud thought that said \"behind you\". I cannot stress enough how unsettled I felt after that. \n\nIt sounds stupid but I have like a system that I follow when it gets dark out. The mirror closet doors that face each other have to be completely closed at night, a light has to be shining towards the door. (Mind you I've never been afraid if the dark before), if I open the door connected to the bathroom, I have to shine a light inside untile I can turn on the overhead, ect. \n\nI feel absolutely stupid for talking about this, but I've never been this creeped out about something. That's most of what happens in my room.\n\nAm I just overthinking or is there something wrong with my room?",

As he was approaching the room he felt really cold (though I'm assuming it was because he was scared). \n \nHe went in and there was nothing.

He does but unfortunately it's like just a one second clip and you can't tell as much but you can hear it. It just sounds like a woman freaking crying! \n \nHe went upstairs to the room and said \"HELLO?!\" and heard a  BANG then it stopped... \nHe went in and nothing... we just have no idea what it could be. We literally looked everywhere under everything to see if it's an animal or something but it isn't. We got his cat to smell around and he doesn't seem suspicious of anything. \n \nAny idea what it could be?",

Since I'm young I've learned what crystals do, how they can help you and how working with them is benefitial for your health. To this day I still occasionally buy some crystals when I feel in need of protection, guidence and strength.\n\nLately I've been quite interested in spirits, because I feel there is a chance an entity has followed me home from somewhere. I don't think it's necessarily evil, and I also don't know if it's because I was personally followed or if I bought something somewhere and took that home.\n\nJust to be safe, I bought a set of crystals to protect myself. But also to connect to the spiritual world better, so if there really is something, I can find the best way to tell them I don't want to be followed. Now I carry a small pouch with me with a labradorite, selenite, clear quartz and black onyx.\n\nJust a while a thought popped up in my head. Can crystals get haunted? I always feel a strong connection with certain stones I own. Like I'm not alone. It's a good feeling, but still. I feel like almost everything can be latched onto, so why not crystals?\n\nNext question is, how do I know if my crystal is haunted? Is there methods for me to check this?",

        "text": "Back in 2006, in my mid twenties, I was in a touring band. Anyone that has lived this life, much like truckers and the like, there are a lot of long drives that you learn shortcuts for.\nI grew up in a city right beside a Native reservation, and my girlfriend at the time was from there, she being First Nations herself. One of my bandmates lived in the city on the *other* side of the Reservation, and I had just dropped him off after a gig.\nWhen going between these two cities, you can drive up to a highway and go around the reserve, or take a shortcut and go through, which I did.\n\nThis reservation had very few streetlights save for the main road, and the road I was going down was completely dark, except for wooden ballasts on the left side that had reflective tape on them.\n\nI had *just* entered the reservation when my headlights reflected off of something yellow. I assumed it was the aforementioned ballasts, until the yellow thing moved.\n\nThey were eyes.\n\nI slowed down and waited for what I assumed to be a dog, coyote, or (least likely) a wolf to cross the street, but it didn't.\n\nThis creature had pitch black, bristly hair and was about the size of a dog\nIt walked quite slowly to the road, stared at me in the van with the reflective yellow eyes, bared its teeth, and then turned around and then quickly spina round and went back into the trees on the left side of the road.\n\nIt took me a moment to realize that was *not* your usual canine. I immediately called my girlfriend (it was the early 2000s, cell phones + driving was commonplace lol) and described it.\n\nTo my surprise, she answered almost immediately and said \"oh, probably a skin-walker.\"\n\n\"A what now?\"\n\nShe explained the legend of skin-walkers: shapeshifters that usually take the form of a coyote or wolf. Traditionally they are medicine men/women who took, according to my ex, \"bad medicine.\" In some legends they are also just straight up witches who want to trick people (look up common indigenous tricksters, if you're curious about that.)\n\nNow, I will point out that there is a Mohawk word for skin walkers, but I could not find it for the life of me. There is a Navajo version, but this happened nowhere near their reservation.\n\nThis has stuck with me forever: the eyes, the teeth, the sense of being completely frozen.",

        "text": "I've been a geocasher for over 10 years and it used to be pretty popular in the Czech Republic. Lots of people hid cashes to spread awareness or to pay respects to old buildings or those who have passed. About 8 years ago, I came across a cash on my map. It was the cash of Panna Bilá.\n\nSome background information:\nBilá Paní, or White Lady, is believed to haunt Český Krumlov, which is a town in the Czech Republic. The legend says that the White Lady appears in and around the castle tower of Krumlov Castle, which is located in the town. The White Lady is the ghost of Perchta of Rožmberk, a noblewoman who lived in the castle during the 16th century. She appears as a white figure walking in the area, and her presence is a sign of impending disaster or death.\n\nEvery geocash has instructions on where, how and when to find them, as some can only be seen at specific times. This cash, however, came with the instruction go absolutely not go at night. It was believed that Panna Bilá roamed the area and demands silence on her property. Being there at night would disturb her rest and that is not something you want to be responsible for.\n\nBeing the skeptic thrillseeker that I was, I wanted to go at night anyway. Because who was gonna be there to stop me? A dead woman in a nightgown? Well, not exactly, but I did witness something.\n\nI was in the woods surrounding the castle. I always took my dog with me when I went into the woods. I take him for the night walk that he loves and he scares boars away. Win-win!\n\nI was using the GPS device that I always take with me during cash hunting. It was more accurate than the app back then. It was working fine until at one moment, it just went a little crazy. I'm not talking about it being a little off. The game was to find the coordinates and then you still had about a 30 meter range to actually look for the cash. So that would've been normal. I'm talking about the device sending me hundreds of meters in a direction after it just told me I'm 20 meters away from the given coordinates. I reset it because I thought it was just an error, but it kept doing the same thing. Just every time I reset it, it was a different number.\n\nSince I was just a few meters away from the location I decided to just count my meters since I knew it was like 20 meters. Until I suddenly felt chilly. Note that it was mid Summer and even at night it would be around 25 degrees. There was no wind and I wasn't tired or anything. And even if it was the wind, it would've been warm.\n\nI eventually turned my ass around after my dog started squeaking. And I'm telling you, that dog was a beast (may his kind fluffy soul rest in peace). He wasn't scared of anything and if there was a person or animal near at night, he would bark and growl, not squeak and keep his tail between his hind legs.\n\nI decided to leave because I thought maybe my dog wasn't well, but I wanted to take a picture at least, because I just thought it was cool to be there at night, planning to go back during the day. I remember thinking \"haha my battery is at 69%.\" I know I'm a douchebag. \n\nAnyway. When I got out of the woods and found my car parked to the side, my dog was completely fine. He wasn't tired, hungry or unwell at all. Not only that, I checked my GPS again in fear of having to throw it away because it broke or something, and it worked perfectly. Lastly, my phone battery was at 20%. It's safe to say that I started to question my beliefs a little at this point. Especially when I wanted to take a look at the pictures I took, to see that they were corrupted.\n\nI'm posting this now, because every once in a while I can't stop thinking about it. There is so much that I cannot explain and I was wondering if anyone else may have experienced this.",

        "text": "I'll clarify the situation and explain that I used to play piano, I won some prizes but I admit that I actually disliked it because my mom would push me.  I quit recently in like fall of 2022, although I have done it for a long time I genuinely wish I had quit earlier in 2019 since after that I barely won anything more than an honorable mention but I was still pushed a lot.\n\nFor any context, I am not exaggerating at all when I say that I actually hated having to practice and I think I really should have just quit earlier.  And the lessons were 2 hours long, which honestly I don't think any normal person could handle and the teacher was so prying with me and expected a lot because I won prizes in the past like in ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.  I was constantly forced to attend recitals and rehearsals and contests that I hated. \n\nThe lessons (for months in fact) leading up to before I quit were just so wrong.  I think there's something more going on than just me hating these lessons.  I felt physically sick and dizzy like I was going to throw up when I came into her house and the air was just so constricting I couldn't handle it.  I broke down more than once in tears after it and it just completely ruined my mood no matter how good of a day I had before.  Also, sometimes the temperature would just either be very cold or very warm, just extremes but no balance and it made me super uncomfortable.  It sometimes was so bad that I would also get headaches. Finally, I quit because I just can't handle it anymore.  If you want to know why I endured this for so long, it was because I was afraid my GPA would be too low, I could never find a job, and piano was my only route ever because I was at least good enough at it.  Obviously, that's not true and I definitely don't think I could handle learning it for like 6 more years and as a job without losing my mind.\n\nThe day before a trip in Cancun, I kind of had to go to a recital in her house and I just wanted to avoid it so badly.  The temperature inside was just so cold and nobody else even had that problem, also to travel I decided to get a COVID test to be safe and it came out negative.  I just felt really sick once again.  The day after I felt completely fine and had the best time of my life in Mexico.  The only reason I'm writing about this now is because I forgot about it for a while because obviously I was on the best vacation I had ever had.  Still, everything I mentioned seriously just felt extremely wrong.\n\nI doubt this is a gas leak or mold or anything like that.  My former piano teacher is old, and she lives with her physically sick husband in that house and they would obviously both be dead by now if it was.  Also none of her other students had no problems and when I tried to tell my mom she just thought I was making excuses up.  Like just going inside the house felt so oppressive.  And in case you're wondering, all of these symptoms and issues just disappeared as soon as I actually left the house. \n\nWhich leads me to my conclusion:  There is a demon in her house.  I'm even suspecting something like a korean one specifically, maybe one of those evil foxes.  Why those?  Did I forget to say that after her dog died (What a good boi RIP and I appreciate your protection from this), I started hating her house instinctively, even years before all of those actual issues?  Oh, and she has a lot of Korean students too, some of which moved over from Korea not too long ago.  \n\nAgain, with these foxes, from what I know I can't just assume they are inherently evil or good.  But this one is definitely evil.  Alright and I'm seriously lucky that I was never SA'd either.",

I had just graduated from university and I landed my first full-time job as an HR Assistant. \n \nOffice layout: my office was a large room, with 3 smaller rooms, each with a single door that faces the main area of the office. The doors to two of these rooms faced 2 cubicles, mine and my supervisor’s. And the other room was to my left. One of the two rooms in front of me was a huge filing room, with folders all over the place. I was the only person that used and had the key to this room. \n \nIncident 1: I always stayed back after work because I was trying to finish a project.\n   One afternoon, after everyone in my department had left, I started playing some BGM while I was working. \n  Suddenly, I heard a loud thud coming from the filing room. I figured one of the heavy folders must have fallen off the table, so I got up went to open the door. As I’m approaching the room, I get this intense feeling to run. I ignored it and continued. \n  When I opened the door and looked, there was nothing on the floor and everything was exactly how I had left it. I shrugged, closed the door with the key and went back to my desk.\n  As I sat at my desk, before I could hit play, I heard knocking coming from inside the room. I knew it was coming from that room, because the door would shake with each knock. I sat at my desk, frozen with fear and then the knocks got louder and I grabbed my shit and ran.\n \nIncident 2: I didn’t tell anyone what had happened that day because I didn’t wanna be labeled as crazy or mentally unfit and risk losing my job. So, I told myself I was just really tired and continued staying back after work.\n   A few weeks after the 1st incident, I was at my desk again and I watched everyone from my department leave.\n  I started working, and I heard what sounded like the door knob of the filing room rattling. I shot up from my desk and I went to the door, and I as soon I was standing directly infant of the door it stopped. \n   And this intense feeling of dread and fear came over me. And the door handle started rattling again, I ran back to my desk and I felt like someone was watching me. I grabbed my shit and started heading for the door.\n \nArea outside of my office layout: \n There is “glass” office directly to the left of my department’s door. As the name suggests, it’s completely see-through. \n \nIncident 2 cont.: I slowly closed the door behind me because, again, I didn’t want anyone see me running through the halls acting crazy. \n  I locked the door and walking past the glass office, I heard what sounded like someone banging on the walls. I froze, and the banging continued. I booked it and the banging got louder and followed me until I had left the department completely.\n\nFinal words: I quit shortly after that incident. I just thought this was a weird and interesting experience and wanted to share.",

My aunt says it was an old hotel, my mom says an apartment building, my cousin says a mental hospital and my grandmother- the most credible person said it was someone's mansion. \n\nAnyways my last paranormal experience was when I was in college. I was 18. This might very been the last time I visited before my grandmother's death and my aunt and cousin moved down here to us. \n\nIt was a long drive up there. It was the summer and I was going to visit my aunt, grandma and cousin. My mom was already there. She went a few days before and we were planning on spending time with my grandmother. \n\nI remember horrible traffic going up, what should've taken me 8-9 hrs took me almost 13 hrs. I left relatively early too. I was driving and got on the dirt road heading to my aunts house a bit past mid night. \n\nThere's a hill I had to get through before seeing the old building. I pass the hill and I see the building lit up. All the lights were on, no broken windows, it no longer looked rundown. I swear I could even see people inside walking around. I even see the silhouette of people standing outside the house\n\nIt kinda looked like when Kevin McAllister was trying to fool the robbers when nobody was home. I was very faraway so it was hard to make out details. \n\nI get to my aunts house and and get welcomed inside and hit the hay as soon as I hit the bed. I woke up relatively early and greeted my aunt and asked her who's the ballsy person that finally fixed up the ol spooky place. \n\nShe looked at me like I was crazy and asked what I was talking about. It was probably a year since I last visited and I said the building is now fixed up and it looked really nice. \n\nShe looked out the kitchen window and told me to come here. I was shocked to see the building looked like shit again. I thought I was crazy so I took my cousin with me on his 4 wheeler and it was run down. Looked like before but worse. \n\nI told my cousin what I saw and he blamed it on exhaustion but there's no way I hallucinate that. No fucking way",

        "text": "I never thought I would end up working at a funeral home. However, I found that job opportunities were limited and when I came across the listing in the local paper, the money was too good to pass up. They even had an attached residence that I could live in rent-free, to ensure I was always on hand since I was their only security guard.\n\nSometimes, the job can be somewhat unnerving. Being surrounded by death on a daily basis takes its toll on a person. But I remind myself that I am here to keep the place secure and to make sure that everything runs smoothly.\n\nEvery night before turning in, I take a walk through the building to ensure that all the doors are locked, and the lights are off. I check on the mourners attending evening services if one is scheduled, making sure that they aren’t causing any trouble or breaking any rules. I get up periodically through the night to make my rounds and ensure all is well. If I hear anything out of the ordinary, I investigate it.\n\nAt first, I thought that the job here would be a piece of cake. All I had to do was patrol the building at night, keep an eye on the cameras, and ensure that no one tries to break in. Beyond the morbid appeal, this place provides for young thrill seekers, there are also chemicals stored here that an enterprising criminal could use in the manufacture of narcotics, so intruders were a concern worth noting.\n\nHowever, as I settled into my new role, I began to realize that the job was more than I had anticipated. The funeral home itself was pretty creepy, with dimly lit hallways and creaky old doors. Every time I walked down one of these dark corridors, I could not help but feel like someone—or something—was watching me.\n\nSometimes, I hear strange noises coming from the other side of the walls. Sometimes, I see a shadow flash past in the corners of my vision. Sometimes, I swear that I can feel a cold breath on the back of my neck.\n\nDespite my unease, I try to remain professional. After all, I am here to keep the place secure, not to be spooked by every little sound. However, as the nights wear on, I find it harder and harder to shake the feeling that something is not quite right.\n\nIt wasn't until a few weeks into the job that things began to get strange. I was doing my usual rounds when I heard a noise coming from one of the rooms we use to store the prepped bodies in their caskets for upcoming funerals. It sounded like something was shuffling around in there. I tried to tell myself that there was a reasonable explanation, but I could not shake the feeling that something was not right.\n\nAs I approached the door to the room, my heart started to race. I wondered if I was just acting paranoid, but the noise was unmistakable. It sounded like footsteps, slow and deliberate. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up as I reached for the doorknob. I hesitated for a moment, trying to gather my courage.\n\nFinally, I turned the knob and pushed the door open, just a crack, trying to peek inside without making too much noise. The room was dark, but I could make out the shape of a casket in the center of the room. I tried to remember if there was a funeral scheduled for the morning, but I couldn't recall seeing the schedule that day.\n\nI listened for a moment, but the shuffling noise had stopped. I pushed the door open a little further, and that's when I saw movement out of the corner of my eye. I spun around, my hand reaching for the flashlight on my belt, but there was nothing there. My heart was pounding now, and I could feel the sweat starting to form on my forehead.\n\nI took a deep breath and stepped into the room, shining my flashlight around. The casket was still in the center of the room, and there didn’t seem to be anything else out of place. But I could not shake the feeling that someone was watching me. I finished my patrol of the room quickly and made my way back to my apartment, trying to calm my nerves. It was going to be a long night.\n\nThe next night, I heard the noise again. My heart sank as I realized that the sound was not just in my head, but was coming from the same room as before. Once again, I decided to investigate this issue. I slowly made my way down the hallway, the hairs on the back of my neck standing on end. As I approached the door, my palms began to sweat and my breath became shallow. My personal experiences have taught me to remain calm under pressure; however, this was a different kind of fear.\n\nI pushed the door open slowly and peered inside, my eyes scanning the room for any sign of movement. To my surprise, there was nothing there. No people, no animals, no signs of any disturbance. The room was empty, and the only thing that greeted me was an eerie silence.\n\nI stood there for a few moments, trying to make sense of what I heard. Was it just my imagination, playing tricks on me? Had I been up too late? I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off, but I also couldn't find any logical explanation for the noise.\n\nAs I made my way back to my room, my mind was racing with thoughts and questions. Was there something in the funeral home that I didn't know about? I did not want to jump to any conclusions, but I knew that I had to keep my guard up and stay alert.\n\nAs the nights go on, the strange noises persist, and I begin to feel like I am being watched. It's as if someone, or something, is following me through the halls. Every time I turn around, I expect to see a figure looming in the shadows, but there's never anything there.\n\nI start to become increasingly paranoid. I double-check the locks on the doors and windows every hour, just to make sure they're secure. I even start carrying a side-arm with me on my rounds, just in case.\n\nThings just continue to become even stranger. One night, as I was sitting in my apartment, I heard a series of strange noises coming from outside. At first, I thought it was just the wind, but the sounds grew louder and more persistent until they sounded like someone knocking at the door.\n\nI tried to ignore it, thinking that it was probably just some kids playing a prank. But the knocking continued, growing more insistent by the minute. It was as if someone was desperately trying to get my attention.\n\nFeeling a sense of unease, I cautiously approached the door and peered through the peephole. To my surprise, there was no one there. The hallway was completely empty, and there was no sign of anyone lurking in the shadows.\n\nI couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't right. As I returned to my apartment, I felt a chill blow past me into the apartment. Once inside I couldn’t help but notice that the atmosphere had changed. The air felt thick and heavy, and there was an unexplained chill that seemed to permeate through every corner of the room. Uncomfortable I retreated to my bedroom. Hoping to get my mind off of the night’s events.\n\nHowever, the knocking continued sporadically throughout the night, each time causing my heart to race with fear. I tried to convince myself that it was just my imagination, but the persistent tapping at the door made it clear that it was not. That's the moment when I realize I can't take it anymore. I need to find out what's causing these noises and put an end to it.\n\nThe next day, I decide to talk to the funeral home director about my concerns. I half expect him to laugh it off and tell me I'm crazy, but to my surprise, he takes me seriously. He tells me that the funeral home has been rumored to be haunted for years and that some of the staff have reported strange occurrences in the past.\n\nAs time goes on, my interactions with the spirits are becoming more frequent and intense. I often hear whispers in my ear or feel a cold breath on my neck. Some nights, the spirits become angry and throw objects around the room. I've taken to talking to them as I make my rounds. As it makes me more comfortable and I believe helps to calm the spirits.\n\nI've begun to realize that not all spirits behave the same. Some are friendly and curious, whereas others are vengeful and aggressive. It's as if they each have their own stories to tell, and I am the only one who can hear them.\n\nDespite my growing attachment to the spirits, I've still had moments of fear and doubt. There are nights when I hear something so terrifying that I just freeze in place, too afraid to move. But then, a warm feeling comes over me, reminding me that I was not alone and that everything is going to be okay.\n\nI started to document my experiences in a journal, detailing the encounters I had with the spirits and the strange occurrences that happen each night. I've even begun to research the history of the funeral home, hoping to uncover clues about the spirits' identities and motives. I haven't had much luck yet, but I'm optimistic.\n\nAlthough my job is unusual, I find a sense of purpose in my interactions with the dead. I know what I'm doing is something important, something that no one else could do as well. And who knows, maybe one day I'll even be able to solve the mystery of this place and help the spirits find peace.",

        "text": "So I used to work as a high school teacher in the UK, which was like hell on earth tbh that's another story, but whilst I was working in a school in Merseyside I had a teaching assistant in one of my classes. She was in her mid-thirties, very down to earth lady with a daughter at the school.\n\n\nIt was end of term and on the last day the kids mostly didn't work so we put on games or PowerPoints with stories etc to try to keep them settled before the break. I can't remember how it got brought up, it might have been me talking about ghosts with the class but afterwards the assistant mentioned she had possibly seen a ghost quite recently and even had a picture of it.\n\n\nI was intrigued so she explained what had happened. She had recently been on a night out with her daughter and her friends at the Empire Theatre in Liverpool. It's a large, old theatre and if you Google it you'll see its very active still and you can see pictures of it inside.\n\n\nNow she showed me 2 pictures on her mobile and she said she couldn't explain it, no-one noticed anything at the time and it was only the next day when she saw it looking over her pictures from that night before. \n\n\nShe had been taking a selfie which she thought may have been blurred so a second later she took a second and in that second image she was surprised to see what looks like the ghost of a woman in Victorian dress or gown floating above and to the side of them.\n\n\nShe never made a big deal out of it and wasn't going out of her way to brag. Her daughter said it was strange when I spoke to her later in school.\n\n\nInterestingly the older seats in the Theatre would have been higher than the current ones, I think they were fire damaged or something years ago and it was rebuilt in places.\n\n\n[Here's the first picture](https://ibb.co/6Nt2HD9)\n\n\n[Here's the second picture](https://ibb.co/m0F2vHZ)\n\n\n\nFascinating stuff. The image was emailed to me directly from her mobile when I asked for it. In my honest opinion I believed her story and could see no reason why she would try and fool anyone, she just wasn't interested in sharing the story from what I could see. Fun times 🙏",

Sometimes she said it was important or she had to show me something. Once she tried to exagerate my life was bad and my parents hated me.  I always got a fear\\distrust vibe when she asked and i asked over and over for explanation of where or why to go and she never would say. Eventually she would give up and fly through the wall and disappear.\n\nFinally the last few times she got very upset, desperate, and angry.  She begged and said it was her birthday i HAD to come just for a little while.  I yelled no and go away and in a rage it flew through ME leaving a pure cold feeling and out the wall and never came back.  Years later i realized she looked just like my very old and oddly healthy and strong neighbor lady does NOW that she is grayer and thinner.

A few minutes into our walk, we stop to chat, but get interrupted by a sound in a bush, and never in my entire life, have I heard an animal make this sort of sound, yknow those videos of cats kinda sounding like humans? Imagine that, but more \"ethereal\" or \"angelic\" and very much sounding like a human. But not at the same time??? hard to explain, a \"you had to be there\" kinda thing  Me thinking our buddies are pulling a prank,, I come up to the bush, an start \"chatting\" with it, whilst looking for whoever it is...but there is nothing? and the bush is so small that no human could fit there, Thats where i get creeped out,  i saw no one....i keep \"chatting\" with it, I ask a question, and it makes a sound almost as if it is replying and understanding me, and the more i talk, the more human it sounds..the last straw is when I slowly ask \"Are you answering me?\" and we hear a clear, almost angelic sounding \"Yes\"  WE BOOT THE FUCK OUT OF THERE, find our friends all in the car high out of their minds after the DMT.....we take them to the spot, literally go into the bush and find nothing. To this day, they don't believe us.\n\nThis was btw in the middle of nowhere, In iceland. if that has any relevance",

        "text": "I want to share my only paranormal experience I've ever had because it's haunted me psychologically for 2 years now and I want to get it off my chest and hear if anyone has ever had a similar experience. \n\nI'm an overnight truck driver. My night consists of going into work at midnight to a distribution center, loading a straight truck with side doors full of pallets and pipe and driving it 3 hours north to a store and unloading it. I'm the only person at this store while I'm there. One night I had 3 experiences in the 1 hour I was there unloading. First as I was walking into the back of the truck with the pallet jack I heard right behind my left ear a little girls voice clearly say \"hello?\". I spun around heart racing and there was nothing there. \n\nAbout 10 minutes later as I'm pulling off a large generator with the pallet jack I'm walking backwards out of the truck pulling and literally collide with somebody. It's a wide open dock nothing to run into but I felt myself walk straight back into someone hard enough to knock them down. I spun around my first thoughts being obviously somebody came into the building for some reason and I knocked them down on accident but again nothing was there but this was real physical contact. I was stunned. \n\nNow I was seriously freaked out. I calmed down saying that was wierd but obviously I imagined it, took several long breaths and got back to work. Finally the last thing I had to unload was some bundles of pipe from the side doors of the truck. To do this you have to drive the forklift outside and unload from the side of the truck and drive the pipe back inside. For context, in this building theres a warehouse in the back with a small sales counter and display shelves in the front corner but where I was coming back inside with the forklift is a long wide aisle with storage shelving on each side with rows between. Behind several of these rows theres a staircase that goes up to a single door that leads to an upstairs storage room. So as I'm driving down the aisle in the forklift after coming in with the pipe I pass between a row of shelving and see through to the stairs and at the top standing in front of the open doorway to the dark empty storage room is a pale skinned faceless man. He's wearing a business suit with a red tie and has no face or hair. Like a mannequin but real. He was just standing there at the top of the stairs facing me. I hit the brakes and stopped just past the row, quickly backed up and stared and it was gone. \n\nBy this point I was done unloading and scared shitless so I got the fuck out of there and my heart was pounding in my chest for half the drive back as I tried to process what the hell I had seen. Nothing strange happened before or since the only thing I can really recall is that it was a full moon that night. Did I just go crazy for an hour and hallucinate that stuff? Do those things ring a bell for anyone who has experienced similar? Thanks for sticking around long enough to read this long rambling mess. This is a 100% true story.",

We did this because he talked about him seing ghosts when he was a toddler.. So there is the backstory..\n\n Now for what happened today.. So i talked with my friend and brought up ghosts and whe thought it was a good idea to do it again. Fastforward to the encounter, it started with slight movement on the pointer (or what you would call it?) We wanted to know what it was, so we went right in for the question ''are you a Demon?'' And answered YES. and not only that but there where two Demons.. Now the reason i went here is because most websites doesn't show the real answer but here i can ask everything.. But back to ZOZO.. As we play more and more the pointer will go faster and faster, not real fast, but more progressively faster, and me and my friends found out this.\n\n(Say if ZOZO does something to trick people into thinking he is good because he did that but did admitt that his name is ZOZO after he said his name started with B and said his name was ZN. so just comment if he tricks people or is known for something?)\n\nAnd he also said he doesn't hurt others but punishes them for being bad more than for fun..\n\nEvidence:\n\n\\-500+ years, internet says more, but who knows.\n\n\\- Ventelation opening in his wall closed\n\n\\- He talked about a portal opened for him by me.. (and this could be linked to the last time i was with my friend in his room when we put on demonic/satanic music that could have been the reasoning for some kind of portal and that i was really important to ZOZO he said?)\n\n\\-He started going criss cross from line 1 to line 2 on the alfhabet on the oujia board, it's hard to explain but basically A to O to C to R, if you look at a oujia board you will get it.\n\n\\-Counting from 4 to 1 slowly and saying random things like he struggles to make out words (Because we are Norwegian) So he used YES and NO more than the alphabet to talk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo yeah. I am great friend with him and made sure he is not lying and he swears but other than that please give me info and say whtat i have to do.. I will go in the comment section if i have more info.. :)",

        "text": "I listen to paranormal stories to sleep everynight. Though it is scary, but it's fun scary you know. \n\nLast night, I was listening to the story of the Whistler (the classic reddit story one), and after that, I had a hard time falling asleep. I was having one of those nights where you wake up every one hour or two. \n\nI woke up around 4am, then I fell asleep right after I woke up, I didn't even know I fell asleep, because I had a dream right after. In the dream, I was in my bedroom, sleeping. And because I listen to ghost stories at night, I had my phone with me in this dream. I have a habit of scrolling through social media too, so in this dream, I was trying to put my phone away, so I could fall asleep. Then my dad came in my room (still in the dream), but I couldn't hear the sound of the door open, but I knew it was him. (The thing is, my dad isn't even here atm, he is out of town). He came in, and \"caught\" in still being on my phone (sounds silly because I am already 22 lol). He didn't caught me per se, but he saw me on the phone. He then searched me for the phone, touching my blanket, VERY HARDLY, like pressing me, trying to hurt me. Then I screamed in my dream, because it felt so real. I screamed, then woke up, without actually screaming irl. But my eyes opened so wide when I woke up, it felt so real.\n\nThen I stayed awake til the morning. \n\nI know it's silly lol, it's probably just a nightmare, but I wanted to share it. But it felt so real at the same time, maybe it was something else?",

        "text": "Or at least, (something in) her room. I have never talked to anyone about this because my mother-in-law is a strong believer in the supernatural, and I don't want to come off as insensitive or offensive. \n\nA little background information: my mother-in-law has worked with people in their end-of-life cycle for decades and has seen dozens of people die. She says it's not scary, but I feel like it has traumatized her in some way, and of course, it would be. Death is something we are always instinctively scared of.\nAnyway, I think this might have something to do with what I feel, that, or passed loved ones. Whenever I'm at her house, it's fine. Her house is clean, smells nice, and gets a lot of light during the day. The only thing that seems off is her room. It doesn't matter if it's day or night; every time I enter or walk past her room, something just feels off, like there is this lingering energy. \n\nWhenever I'm there, I find it hard not to focus on my breath. It always smells different than the rest of the house, but it doesn't smell like her at all. It's not vivid or disturbing at all; it's just different. On top of that, it often gets cold there, even when the rest of the house is heated. She will sometimes even complain that it's so cold when we are drowning in heat. And to make it even more stereotypical, the cat refuses to go in. Under no circumstances will the cat enter that room. Lastly, sometimes when she isn't home for a while, I hear sounds coming from the room, not just taps or something falling because of the wind, but the bed and the floor creaking, as if someone is walking or sitting on the bed. It has gotten to the point where I once couldn't help but take a look. But of course, I couldn't see anything, but it just felt weird. \n\nNow, there are a few options, of course. The option of previous owners is ruled out, as I know the history of this home. No one ever died here, and no one who's lived here died.\nMy second idea is that one of the people she once took care of who died might have attached themselves to her. But I'm not sure if that is possible because why would it stay in her room?\nLastly, she owns some belongings of passed loved ones and keeps them there, some letters from her parents, and I believe a rosary, but why would her parents leave such a tense energy? \n\nI have so many questions. All I know is what I wrote, and to me personally, it feels off. I'm posting here to not only \"talk\" about it for the first time. But also to see if someone can clear some things up for me. If you know anything, please tell me.",

        "text": "I’m taking into account that this could very well just be standard, run of the mill anxiety. I do have some anxiety that I work on but it doesn’t make me feel the way I’m describing, and even when I feel great I still have this sense that there’s someone lurking, and I still have nightmares almost every single night.\n\nThe nightmares are usually the same, too. It’s either that I’m dying or I’m watching other people getting killed. Oftentimes it’s both, like I’ll be third in line to be hanged and I’ll have to watch it happen to 2 others before it’s my turn, and as soon as they start to count down for the floor to get released under me, I wake up in a panic.\n\nI’ve talked to therapists, I’ve taken medicine, I’ve done all the things and I know that I could eventually totally clear all of this with enough work. However, I do want to know if this also sounds like a pattern associated with any specific type of paranormal entity. It feels like I’m being haunted, and it doesn’t matter where I go. It isn’t just my house.\n\nThank you in advance.",

        "text": "Hello! \n\nFair warning: Long read. \n\nI've been reading story after story here for the last few days, and was inspired to share some of my own. Because some of them are a bit long, I'll separate them. \n\nBackground: \nNot from an English speaking country, so I'm sorry for any low quality wording and writing. \n\nI've lived in two houses I consider haunted, one of them more than the other. \n\nI've been told by mediums that I have warm hands, but don't know how to use them, and the ability to leave my body through meditation, but that I don't trust the process and thus are not able to yet. \n\nI now live in an apartment for myself, and have only had two things occur here. Let\"s just say, something manifests in one of the bedroom closets. \n\nIn this post I\"ll tell about four small events I can't explain, that happened in one of the houses. \n\nThis is a large house I lived in by myself many years ago. It was the middle one of three in a row, on the countryside, near a forest. \n\nI only ever spoke with one of the neighbouring families. The other one kept to themselves. \n\nI became very good friends with the first family, and they started telling me about weird stuff happening in their house. Like water dripping from the ceiling right down into their glasses when they ate dinner, but no leakages, their cats hissing into empty rooms, balloons from a birthday party that came floating mid-air, stopped before them, and suddenly shot back. Also they could wake at night of something sitting down on their bed, and the daughter said she was visited by a lady at night. At only 10, she was convinced the house was built on a burial ground. \n\nThey had several mediums there, and it would be calmer for a while, until it started again. \n\nI knew there was something in my house just shortly after I moved in. Nothing happened, but I guess many of you know the feeling of being watched. \nThe basement was the worst. I felt I had to look over my shoulder the entire time, and had a strong feeling that something wanted to shut the door behind me, trapping me there. Never happened though. \n\nThe second worst was two rooms on the second floor. I could feel a presence, so I avoided using them. \nThe third was on top of the stairs to the second floor while standing on the first. Every time, I had to look up to see if someone was looking down at me. \n\nIronically, all four things happened on the first floor. \n\nCase 1. \nOne evening I was watching a series, and there was a sound I couldn't identify. I couldn't tell what it was, other than it was just displaced. After a little while I had to pause what I was watching, and just sat there listening. \n\nSuddenly a distinct, clear as day, deep, choking breath was taken behind me. It sounded like someone struggled to get air. I just froze. Then two more breaths just like it. And that was it. \n\nI remember telling myself that I knew that I had heard it, and to never doubt myself whenever I would think back on it. \n\nCase 2. \nOne morning just after I woke up I went into the kitchen to get some water, and it was so freaking hot in there. Like a radiating warmth in the air. I checked all the ovens, but they were off. I was really puzzled and couldn't understand where it came from, until I saw the stove was on full blast. Turned to the max. \n\nThe only reasonable explanation is that I'd done it myself in my sleep. But I've never been sleepwalking. As far as I know. \nIt scared me so much that I pulled the cord from it whenever I left the house, for months after. \n\nCase 3. \nOne evening I was making dinner someone started knocking really fast and hard on my front door. I tought. \nI looked out the window, but there was no one there. The knocking continued. And it was so loud, hard and fast. I thought someone was knocking on my living room wall, so I went in there to look from one of the windows. \n\nAt that time I had a fairly large dog, so he obviously had to have large chewing bones. I can't remember putting his bone on the windowframe, but there it was,  frantically shaking from side to side, all by itself. \n\nIt moved so fast, and banged into the frame with force. \nMy dog was right beneath it and looked at me with big eyes, looking like a question mark. \nI was so taken off guard, and I didn't understand what I was seeing, so I wasn't afraid. \nI just walked slowly towards it, and then it lost momentum until it lay still. \n\nI tried to get it moving again by like giving it som hard pushes, but to absolutely no use. I also tried holding on to it and move it just as fast, but there was no way. \nIt really moved faster than what I could reproduce. \n\nAnd for anyone wondering, I had many nights I didn't sleep well, or couldn't sleep at all because I felt the presence so close. Many nights I would just get my dog and leave for hours. \n\nCase 4. \nThe most innocent and undramatic, but still weird. \nWas sitting in the sofa one evening when I suddenly saw an orb or something floating right under the ceiling. Just a ball of white light. In the second I turned to look at it it shot into the wall in a flash, like on a camera. \n\n\nSo, that's my four weird cases from that house. \nIn coming posts I'll post a video of my dog reacting to unexplained footsteps in a dark forest, write about a time I saw two dead people, a time a kitchen cabinet flew up and things being thrown out, and some other creepy stuff. \n\n\nThanks for reading!",

        "text": "TW: talks of violence\n\nSo, this story did not happen to me, rather to my sister. When i was 17 turning 18 we got a new double wide home (trailer). At this point im going into my senior year of High School. Well one night my sister went to go walk the trail we had on our property. It was around midnight and she just had a heated argument with my mother. Well at this point in her walk she notices a lady who seemed to be in a white nightgown. The lady was not facing my sister at this point so my sister called out to her and she did not respond. Weird. So my sister kept walking and made her way to the beginning of the driveway. As she reaches the top she hears what she describes as a banshee wail. My sister starts to book it to our house and im sitting outside smoking and i didnt hear a thing. What i do hear is the front door slamming shut so i get up, put my gb down (grav. bong fyi) and head inside. As i do i ask my sister what was wrong. She told me that when she walked by the old well she saw a lady in a nightgown. Odd. Then she proceeds to tell me that at the top of the driveway she heard a shriek. Odd again. Then, she tells me that as she is coming back down to our house it looks like the lady had chains around her, and someone had slit her throat and drowned her while the lady screamed at her. Come to find our property used to be apart of some old mines about 100 years ago. Im not sure if that is the right way i told it but thats what i remember.\n\nTLDR; Sister encounters lady in a nightgown who had been murdered, then dumped in a well, while the lady shrieked like a abanshee",

        "text": "Basically I’ve been working here for about half year now. When i first got here, everything was normal. I’ve had a lot of paranormal experiences before and i do believe in them but i always try to be realistic. Few weeks after i started working here, i was seeing black shadows from the corner of my eye. Not just once, and they didn’t just stand. They were moving, like running, walking away. I’ve never felt terrified because i know those are just shadows and there’s a chance i was just really tired so i didn’t think much of it. Some weeks ago tho, i started finding broken glasses and plates around the dining area (i work in a restaurant). I can see the cameras, and i always asked others if they broke something during their shift because it was getting annoying. I mentioned it to my boss and she said nothing. There were days i was working the whole day from opening to closing and even then, i could find these glass pieces. \nYesterday i was the one to close, and as i was shutting down all the machines, one of the chairs moved. I didnt see it, but i heard the sound of it. We were already closed, no guests inside, most of the lights were turned off as well, except for one for me at the bar area so i could see. The chef was in the kitchen, so really no one could’ve moved it.\nSmaller things has happened too: me hearing my female bosses talk to me, when she wasn’t even in that day, or have the frontdoor randomly opening. \nI really dont know if im being paranoid or if something is really here. \nAlso sorry if i made any grammar or spelling mistakes, english isnt my first language but i hope you all can still understand my story",

        "text": "A little backstory, my husband and I bought the house I grew up in.  We moved in about 3 years ago.  Growing up, there was definitely a presence in the home, but it wasn't a negative feeling.  We all experienced things but they weren't necessarily scary, more shocking.  We just accepted it and everyone existed together until we moved after I graduated high school. \n\nFor the first year or two I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary.  However within the last year I have been having something odd happen somewhat frequently at night.  My toddler sleeps in bed with us, and he and I go to bed early.  My husband usually comes to bed an hour or two later.  A few times a month, I wake up, and there will be something floating in the air above me.  I know this sounds crazy or like sleep paralysis, but I am awake and able to move.  The first time it was floating towards me, I sat up and swatted and hit it.  I was shocked, and thought it was maybe an odd bug, but it was big-roughly the size of a baseball.  When it flew/floated, it moved like a butterfly, in a swooping motion.  This was in the winter, so no bugs were around at that time.  I got up and looked and couldn't find anything on the floor, but I definitely made contact with something!  \n\nNow I wake and see something above me, but when I sit up it's gone.  This has happened roughly five times.  They are always moving towards me, or hovering about three feet above me. \n\nMy husband is currently out of town working, so both of my young sons are sleeping in bed with me, along with one of our dogs.  Our new dog (she is about 6 months old), doesn't usually sleep in our room, but she was on the floor by the bed.  Again I woke up and saw something floating a few feet above me, this time it looked almost blue, and moved off to the right when I looked at it.  I didn't move, but our dog started barking and growling.  She did this for a few minutes, then went under the bed and continued doing it.  I laid still trying to figure out if she heard something (because of course with me being home alone with the kids I'm already on edge) and didn't hear or see anything.  Our other dog didn't make any indication that he noticed anything and just laid at the foot of the bed.\n\nI'm looking for some suggestions, or if anyone has dealt with something similar.  This isn't the type of thing we experienced in this house previously.  It also doesn't have a negative feeling, but it does wake me up at night, and I don't want anything to get worse and scare my kids.  So far I'm the only one to notice anything.",

One day after school I was talking my shortcut through the cemetery as usual and I tripped and fell. As I went to get up I saw bare feet in front of me and I immediately felt very uneasy. I stood up and when I did I saw what looked like a woman standing in front of my wearing a white sort of night gown sort of thing that went down to her knees. She was bare foot and she had long black hair and she was looking down at her feet. I felt very unsettled by her kinda like this I could be in danger feeling. I don’t know if that’s the best way to describe the feeling I got it wasn’t like a feeling of immediate danger more of a be very careful sorta feeling if that makes sense. I said hello and she looked up at me and that was when I noticed her eyes were blood red and looked very reptilian with vertical pupils. When she looked at me it was sorta like she was looking through me. She then spoke and said that I needed to be more careful and that I needed to get home then she disappeared. I never saw her again after that and I have no idea what she was but I somehow inherently knew that she could have easily hurt or killed me if she wanted to but she didn’t.

Plus I would hear footsteps on the landing and up the stairs, and it was a very distinctive noise, wasn't normal creeking, and my mum would say, \"don't worry, it's just the next door neighbours, the floorboards are all connected\" me being young and dumb believed that.\n\nIt never got any worse than that for years, just foot steps moving around and the door and the constant fear, couldn't shake it. \n\nThen my sister was born and we needed a 3rd bedroom, so my parents turned the attic in too a bedroom which became mine, but whilst they were renovating it, the stairs going up to the attic needed to be built, and it went the otherside of the creepy wardrobe, and the partition wall was left open and covered with a  plastic sheet and was I playing in the hallway with my two friends next to it and I then got that sudden fear decend worse than ever and the sheet of plastic shot out, like a figure had run into it, we all ran screaming, and my mum came to check and I said what happened, i'll never forget how her face dropped and she went white, she just said \" dont worry, The workmen must be putting in the new windows in your new room, and it made a draft\". \n\nFast forward to the attic becoming my bedroom, I was even more terrifed than in my old room, the noises of footsteps coming up my stairs, the constant fear, I thought I saw a figure a few times out the corner of my eye, never head on, and I could never sleep, it got so bad, I had to sleep on the floor in my sisters room for 2 years. \n\nNow this is the kicker, my mum is very spiritual, and what was in that wardrobe I hated, a Ouija board, that she had a horrible exerpience with once and she said she can't get rid of it, is that true? I am a believer, more creepy goings on have happened to me throughout the years, this was the worst and most consistent. \n\nWe lived in the house from when I was 4 to 12, and once we moved, nothing creepy happened in the new house or any of the other houses ever again. I still feel that weird feeling in places but never more than that. \n\nSo when I was 16, I questioned my mum on it all, and she felt it all too, she heard and saw things more than me, but didn't want me or my sister to be scared. She still wouldn't say what the board said or did, but it was when she was young when it happened. \n\nWas wondering if any of you guys would know what was happening? My mum is very hesitant to talk about it in detail.",

I don’t know Latin, but I felt that it was Latin, when I looked up the meaning it was indeed Latin or old Norse. It was in a black cloak with a slightly pointed hood, he had hollowed eyes and a pointed nose. It had a familiar or something of that sort in the corner of my ceiling, it had king stretched ribs and a goblin face with thin skin and talons at the end of the wings. \n\nIt was frightening but when I woke and started processing it and looked up the meaning, I feel as if it where trying to protect me, as the worlds meant protection (i don’t like repeating specifics to the public, magic is very sensitive and I don’t want to make any mistakes) \n\nHas anyone had an experience with this entity before?",

She has gorgeous blue eyes and over all is a very pretty antique doll. Ive never been very interested in dolls, however I was drawn to her.\n\nEver since that day, some odd things to say the least have been happening.\n\nThe first day I got her, I felt very off and paranoid. Then, my typically very quiet and polite bird began screaming very often. He has never been very loud around me, and only screams when other people (my mom/siblings/friends) are in the room (hes a very jealous bird lol). But now he has started screaming randomly and consistently. Ive tried giving him more food, water, Ive tried playing with him, letting him fly around, everything. He wont stop.\n\nThen, this morning I woke up to what looks to be about 5 small scratches all in a row on my kneecap. Now I have 3 cats, however they are not allowed In my room at night (as they eat my plants) so I know for a fact it was not a cat.\n\nLastly, Im currently laying on my bed with one of my cats. he was being normal, rubbing around on me and Im petting him. Out of nowhere, he jumped and turned around, almost as if something touched him suddenly. I reached out and tried to pet him and he jumped again, before realizing it was me and calming down. \n\nIdk, but something just feels a bit off.",

        "text": "I was walking home from work because my car had broken down. As I was walking I felt this uneasy feeling, as if someone was watching me. When I arrived I saw that my wife and child were bleeding all over the floor. The blood was spreading fast, but I also noticed that the marks did not look like any animal I have ever seen. There were scratches too big for a bear or coyote, and there are no signs of stab wounds. My wife was torn apart limb from limb and was spread across the room. My mind was racing and then I fell on my knees with tears in my eyes thinking every moment I spent with them. They were gone, but then my son I heard him coughing he said \"d-dad help-p me\" \"son SON answer me\" I cried, but no response. \n\n\nI called an ambulance as fast as I could, and they tried to save him, but It was too late. He was dead. As the ambulance left with the bodies I noticed something peeking through the window as I went to check I saw a dark and tall beast like figure frantically running into the night. The figure was too tall to be a coyote and too skinny to be a bear. The eyes looked like the whitest white i have ever seen. The next morning I went to work still scared that thing would come back and I wouldn't be so lucky. My co-workers comforted me and my boss even gave me the day off. As I was walking back I felt the same uneasy feeling. I looked around and I saw something rattling around in the bush. I ran to check but I only found a opossum eating an apple with a few bites taken out of it. I was getting paranoid that thing could attack me at any time. I arrived at my new home to find it destroyed. That only meant one thing he was back. \n\n\nI told the police that someone had broken in because if I told them a monster came and ripped up my house they would call me crazy. I had to rent a house for the time being. I hardly slept that night scared that the monster would show up. I went back to work the next morning. My friend told me that someone broke into his house and destroyed it. My face went pale and then he asked if he could stay with me for the night because it was supposed to be below 30 degrees. I hesitated before I said yes. That night I finally slept. I woke up in the middle of the night. I couldn't find my friend but then I heard screaming ¨WHAT WHAT¨ I yelled but the noise stopped followed by chewing and ripping noises and I knew it was too late. He heard me yell. I knew I  was next.",

        "text": "Second round of odd incidents post here, this time involving my wife too. I also have an earlier post of different incidents....not allowed to link to it, I think.\n\nIncident 1. City condo 2020: We moved into a condominium unit and it was pretty regular except for weird cigarette smells that come every few weeks from our toilet. Neither my wife or I smoke, and I don't think it's something from the previous tenants either. The toilet is away and closed from the front door and has no windows. 6 months in, we suddenly noticed something that vaguely resembled handprints on the ceiling. Later that year, we moved back into my parents' house to take care of my mother who went berserk crazy for a few months (It was sudden and no one knew how to deal with it)\n\n2021 was generally quite a peaceful year for us with no supernatural stuff or crazy behaviour from my mother. We continued to stay in my parents house (also my childhood home) until now.\n\n2022: My wife underwent a major operation for cancer and after this is when more weird things start to happen.\n\nIncident 2. Tourist Mountain: About 3 weeks post-op, I drove my wife up to a local tourist mountain for a weekend vacation. It was the sort of vacation with minimal walking and nice cold weather (we are from the tropics so the cold is our idea of nice holiday weather). The first night I heard loud banging sounds on the wall, and my wife woke up in the middle of the night to someone standing over her breathing down her back. She thought it was me and turned around but there was no one there. On the second night she dreamt of two people standing in the kitchen staring at her.\n\nIncident 3. Wife's dreams after tourist mountain: Dream 1. My wife dreamt of having an out of body experience, where she left her body and saw 4 figures looking at her body Dream 2. She dreamt of a famous Asian comic author dying. The next day the Queen of England died. Dream 3. She dreamt of a coffin on my home office desk. The next day my aunt died.\n\nIncident 4. Flagstaff: After my wife fully recovered from her surgery, I quit my job and we went on a long planned 2 month backpacking trip to US/Mexico. After a 2 day roadtrip through Arizona, we arrived in Flagstaff in the evening. After dinner downtown, we decided to check out the infamous haunted Montevista hotel as I wanted to \"test\" if my wife could see \"anything\" there given her weird dreams over the past few months. However, as soon as we stepped into the lobby, she started getting headaches, so we decided to drive back to our Airbnb. About 10 minutes into the drive, we smelled weed in the car. Neither of us smoke weed, nor was this smell there the entire 2 days we had the car prior. When we arrived and parked next to our Airbnb, another vehicle stopped by us and insisted we were driving recklessly and he had followed us to make sure we were safe. We had no idea what we did. Neither of us drank that day, and I was driving slowly with very few other cars on the road at that time. Weird.\n\nIncident 5. Cinema: My wife had a lot of weird dreams while we were moving around in Mexico. One of these became so frightening, she demanded to change bed sides with me. After we came back home from our big trip, we watched Black Panther 2 in the cinema. I booked the twin seats second row from the back. The back row was completely empty. Around the scene where the underwater Mayans come in, we started getting our seat backs kicked. This went on a few times....at one point I got up to go to the toilet. When I came back, I took a long peek at the seat behind us and saw no one. Minutes after I sat down, I got another kick.",

There are two very clear hand prints on the mirror, both of which are smeared down, and the water is still dripping from them. No one was in the bathroom when I walked in, and no one came in while I was there. The urinal is directly next to the mirror and I am tall enough to see over the wooden panel. This is a fine dining establishment, so no one would just do that. And the hands were much too large and too high up to be a child. Not sure what to think of this but I’m straight up not having having a good time.",

For context, she was following me throughout the dream and looked exactly like she was described, but there was no \"po\" noise.  Now I'm 16 and live in the united states and she only goes after ages 9-11 and lives in Japan. Either way I always feel like something is watching me and keep mistaking footsteps or my fan running as her \"po\" noise and its seriously riling me up to the point where im too scared to walk home from school alone and wake up in the middle of the night staring to make sure she doesnt enter.

        "text": "This is another one of my experiences with the paranormal. It happened in the same location as the last encounter I shared. Dustin's house. This time, we were hanging out in his garage. It was myself, Dustin, and two of our other closest friends. Brandon and Drew. \n\nThe four of us were all gathered in Dustin's garage, simply hanging out and talking about all matter of high school problems. During the talk, Dustin had made his way to the opposite side of the garage, next to the garage door. The three of us hadn't noticed that this was strategic on Dustin's part. See, there was another light switch in the garage, right next to the garage door. \n\nDustin had hatched a scheme to scare us by suddenly turning the lights out in the middle of our conversation. It was near midnight, and we were already wound up. It was guaranteed to leave us in complete darkness. However, this didn't go his way or our way either. None of us knew what was going to happen that night.\n\nSo, Dustin turned out the lights. It startled us at first, but we quickly realized it was Dustin trying to scare us. We asked multiple times for him to turn the lights back on. He responded with poorly acted confusion. He eventually turned them back on for us. The lights in his garage were very bright. We were blinded for a second and had to let our eyes adjust to the light. That's when we saw it.\n\nFor some strange reason, when the lights came back on, the three of us on the opposite side from Dustin were all facing the same way. We all faced the wall opposite the garage door. It was painted wait, so it made this very noticeable to us. We saw a black handprint that was slightly faded. Just this lone handprint. Now, that may seem like it's easily explainable. Which it definitely could be. However, what happened next, can't be. \n\nThe three of us mumbled to each other for a second. All asking if we remembered seeing that handprint before the lights went out. We all agreed that we hadn't. Dustin asked what was going on, and we told him we saw a black handprint. He must have thought we were joking because he didn't take us seriously at all. He turned the lights out on us again. This time, we reacted with a little more anger, telling him to turn the lights back on. \n\nHe tried to joke around with us, but we weren't in a joking mood. He caught the hint and turned the lights back on. When our eyes adjusted to the light again, we saw them. Multiple black handprints. All overlapping each other in a horizontal straight line. Leading from one wall to the next. Every wall in the garage now had a line of overlapped black handprints. They were surrounding us. It looked as though something or someone had been running on all fours, horizontally around us. Circling us. \n\nDustin saw them as well. The feeling of terror and panic set in for all of us. We trampled over one another, trying to escape the garage. Drew pushed his hands and his head into my back, ramming me through the door into the house. The three of us spilled onto Dustin's living room floor. We couldn't catch our breath and kept shouting nonsense to each other, trying to make sense of what had just happened. We all had a hard time calming down. We tried to convince ourselves that it didn't even happen and that we only thought that we had seen the handprints. \n\nHowever, when we mustered the courage to check. We were greeted with the handprints still being there. The garage then became a restricted area for us when we all hung out. The only time we would go back in was to try and do our own investigating. We never cleaned the handprints off. I'm not sure if it was out of fear of angering whatever had left them or if it was a reminder that it did happen. Either way, it is still one of the craziest experiences I've ever had, and it will always stick with me.",
