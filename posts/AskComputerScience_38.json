I have the pseudo code.\n\nImplement Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm satisfying the following assumptions and requirements:\n\n(a) The entire graph is not availabe in advance. The graph is implicity represented by the start vertex and a problem specfic \"success(v)\" function that gives for vertex v the set of \"successor\" nodes reachable by one edge from v. Some vertices represent a goal state.\n\n(b) Maintain the expanded set E and the frontier set F in a suitable data structure that allows an efficient membership test (v ∈ E? v ∈ F?). In addition, F needs to support efficient priority queue operations.\n\n(c) Edge costs may be negative, and hence a vertex in E may have to be moved to F.\n\n(d) State representation, adjacency, and edge cost calculation must be easily modifiable to handle various problems such as:\n\n\"River-crossing\" problems, such as The Missionaries and Cannibals: n missionaries and n cannibals are on one side of the river. How can they all cross the river, using a boat that can hold m people at a time, without every leaving more cannibals than missionaries on either side of the river at any time?\n\n(e) Your program must output a path from the start vertex to the first goal vertex found (possibly backwards) and its cost. It should also output relevant statistics such as the number of vertices generated and the total CPU time.\n\nTest your implementation on the following two sample problems:\n\n(a) The weighted graph:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/xRV05j2\n\nAssume BWI is the start vertex, and SFU and LAX are the goals. Your program must output a shortest cost path to SFO or LAX, whichever is closer to BWI.\n\n(b) The Missionaries and Cannibals problem for the case n = 3 and m = 2, and for the case n = 4 and me = 3. Assume all edge costs are 1.\n\n\n\nPlease create:\n\nA concise report describing the following:\n\n1.) Implementation details of the data structures and methods for E and F.\n\n2.) Details of the state and edge cost representations for the two sample problems.\n\n3.) Test results (including the actual output) and a convincing argument of the correctness of the implementation.\n\n4.) The source code\n\n\n\nPlease implement this in Java and include all source code.

        "text": "Hi all - I have 0 experience with algorithms, but an interesting question came up in my biostatistics class about tournament seeding. I do not need to know how to code it, just how to explain how it would work!\n\nThe question is - Find a simple algorithm to determine when two seeds will meet in a SINGLE ELIMINATION TOURNAMENT\n\nHere is what we were given to work from: What is a simple algorithm to determine which round two seeds will play (assuming they win their matches before they meet)?\n\nHe stated in class that the answer is actually very simple (though it may seem complex).\n\nIn the first round of the tournament, teams are matched by seed so that the sum of their seed value = n + 1. Simply, if there are 16 teams, seed 1 will play seed 16, because 1 + 16 = 17 (n+1). Similarly, seed 14 will play seed 3, seed 12 will play seed 5 etc...\n\nHere is a hit he gave us: http://imgur.com/a/ZlAFW\n\nThe first image is a simple description of a tourn. bracket. The second image is the hint. First, he reordered the seed numbers so that seed 1 was actually seed 0. He then renumbered the rest of the seed so that the final seed was 15, and n+1 still equals 17. Then he exchanged the seed number (0, 1, 2... 15) with the binary complement. So now, seed 0 = 0000, seed 1= 0001 seed 15 = 1111. This is key, because having the final seed being 15 gives us a binary of 1111.\nI am still unsure as to how to proceed, can anyone help me. \n\nI am completely free and open to questions!\n\nThanks",

I've researched about the degree online, but the information is overwhelming, and I just can't seem to find a starting point.\n\nIt would really be helpful if someone assisted me on where to start, and what I should learn about so that it can get easy for me later. Also, is there anything you wish you'd done in this gap that could help with the degree?\n\nAlso, I'm not *that* good at Maths, so some advice on the Mathematical concepts used in the CS degree shall be helpful as well.\n\nI'd really love to hear your insights and advice.

My questions is more of what pay I should offer the student. \n\nA bit about what I'm asking them to do: Over their time here, each student needs to work on 4 different productions. It can be in any capacity: Set, Lighting, Costume, Sound, Stage or Production Management. They can also be designers (set, costume, etc.) or Crew Heads (set, costume, etc.). These tasks may all be done in a year to over 5 years. I also need to be able to fill out an evaluation rubric, that is slightly different for each task.\n\nIn the end, I need to be able to take the average of the top 4 grades to submit as the final grade. \n\n What is a reasonable offer? I put the question to the Computer Science department today and have already received over a dozed replies. They're all Master's students, so I don't want to short-change them. But I'm also paying out of pocket and I want it to be not too expensive. So what is a reasonable amount to offer these students? I appreciate your help.",

If you verify I shouldn't post this here, it won't happen in the future. \n\nAnyway, this is a segment of code that I'm working on where merge takes two sorted lists and merges them into a single sorted list. mergePass is supposed to take a list of a list of integers such as [[1], [3], [2], [4]] and merge the list into a list sorted pairs using merge (e.g. [[1,3], [2,4]]). Merge is functioning but mergePass is throwing an error:\n\n    Error: operator and operand don't agree [tycon mismatch]\n      operator domain: int list * int list list\n      operand:         int list * int list\n      in expression:\n        merge (hd1,hd2) :: mergePass tl\n    val it = () : unit\n\nI understand the meaning of the error but my professor and I are both having trouble with why I am receiving it.

Now I really liked graphtheory and graphalgorithms, but I was not very good at it. When I wrote to my prof, asking if she knew any good subjects, she replied she mostly has theoretical topics to offer. I am kind of intrigued because this maybe a good challenge. On the other hand, I've never done **any** theoretical paper and don't feel like I am sufficiently prepared. So I am very divided on the issue. It feels like I could be either hyped or sensible and back off.\n\nSo my question:\n\nHas anyone of you been in a similar situation? If so, what did you decide to do and how did it turn out?\n",

        "text": "Hey r/askcomputerscience! \n\nSo, I was reading about Ethereum and ended up on their LinkedIn page and saw on their employee list someone whose title was 'Resident Philosopher' and that got me thinking... \n\nI was a philosophy major in college and really loved it but had no interest in continuing into academia or going to law school. I had left school for a year, though, to co-found a startup that got seed funding and I handled all creative direction and learned a lot about marketing, PR and some UX/product development/proj management. So that landed me a job at another startup in the connected car tech space after graduating last year and do pretty much the same stuff for them, but they're established and VC backed. But I don't really want to stay in the marketing/PR realm...I really want to be in management or work for a non-profit or some foundation advising or consulting.\n\nMy question boils down to this: I'm super passionate about having conversations surrounding the ethics of tech developments and implementations, but I don't have a technical background/CS degree and I admittedly don't understand a LOT about the things I'm most interested in, like blockchain, security, programming in general... I do have startup experience, though, and maybe that could be step towards being involved with the development and direction of a blockchain startup or something. But I know I need a graduate degree, both to learn about CS but also just to get into management. I know there are Masters in Computer Science programs for non-majors, and that there are Applied Ethics programs around in philosophy departments, but I don't even know if those would be the right step either. I'd love to hear from anyone who works in tech who came from a liberal arts/phil background, to learn more in general what a career trajectory might look like, or how difficult this would be.

I can't seem to manage my time, or stay on top of assignments. I usually just feel disoriented and i've been messing up left and right. \n\nHoping to get it out of the way, I took an accelerated humanities class. But, it made things more difficult, as exams and assignments were like obscure trivia, requiring some hardcore studying. I fell behind in my algorithms class, read the wrong chapters, then spent hours catching up just to not make the deadline. All while neglecting other courses.\n\nCurrently, I'm spending hours on assignments, but making little progress. I fixate on whether or not I am doing what the teacher wants me to, often times I just start over. I've tried to just work through that feeling, but I get distracted a lot, or go back and change minor things that aren't broken.\n\nI've also been reluctant to ask for any help from school resources. I almost feel scared to; I've never had to ask for help, really, and I sort of don't know what to ask for help with. I find it hard to put what I am confused about into words. I do make a lot of excuses, like that 'I don't think anyone can help *me*', or I think that 'I can do it on my own', or that 'its too late to fix the past' but then continue doing the same stuff, so it's obvious I need help. I feel embarrassed, and sort of ashamed. I feel like I don't belong at times, like I got here by luck. But, I've been trying really hard, and I transferred in with a 3.8 GPA, which I worked hard for.\n\nIf anyone else has any advice, or has experienced this and knows what it is, I appreciate any advice.\nThanks in advance!",

        "text": "CS undergrad here, please point me in the right direction if this isn’t the place to ask for advice. \n\nI’m having trouble with my CS exams, specifically my Data Structures and Algorithms ones, and it’s become rather frustrating lately. I put in a lot of time and effort into studying for exams, and feel confident going into the test, but for some reason everything seems to fall apart during the exam. A lot of the exam questions ask me to find the runtime of some code, or to fill in skeleton code to mutate an ADT, or to write some code that fulfills the requirements given some interface, or to traverse a tree in some way given certain conditions, etc. When I practice such problems before the exam, I usually have a notion of where to start and manage to solve the problem within a reasonable amount of time. However, on the exam, I find myself not flustered or panicking, but blanking out when I see problems that ask me to write code for things I have never done before. For example, I knew how to rotate a 2D array and flip a 2D array, but a question on the exam asked me to shift a column down by x elements, and I completely blanked. Despite being solid on concepts, I find myself not being able to “connect the dots” in time before time is up; my solution only popped up in my head as I was turning the exam in, and by this time it was too late for me to even write anything down for partial credit. \n\nSomething very similar happened last semester in my midterm exam, and I took it as bad luck. The same thing happened during the final exam last semester, and I noticed that I needed to make some changes because bad luck doesn’t cause you to realize the solution only after you turn in the exam twice in a semester. I’m a firm believer in the idea that I’m not inherently smart, and that I can improve if I put in enough work. And so for my midterm exam this semester, I made sure to practice more and put my pride aside and went to office hours to ask for help whenever I didn’t understand anything. Lo and behold, the same thing happened in this semester’s midterm exam. I admit this frustrated me a lot because I felt like no matter how much work I put in, some external force (or even myself) was holding me back from doing well on the exams. I scored well on practice exams (past exams of previous offerings of the course), but for some reason the actual test would mess me up. After some reflection, I realized that the quantity of my efforts was not proportional to my performance on the exam, and because “quality is better than quantity,” I needed to change something up for another exam coming up soon.\n\nI’m not sure if this is occurring because of my study habits, my environment/daily routine, or test conditions/nerves. I’m convinced that the test conditions/nerves are not the main issue here, but I am not ruling them out as factors. During the exam, I become so engrossed in my work that I am not perturbed by any external forces (like people coughing or a tiny desk or whatnot). As for nerves, I am not anxious coming into a test, but I do have a sense of purpose in that I know that I have two hours to do a test that I want to do well on, and I have to not waste time in those two hours. \n\nHere are my study habits:\n\nI go to every lecture and take notes the following day to recap what I learned (taking notes during lecture distracts me). I also attend every discussion and lab section, and sometimes go to the extra practice sections held on weekends. When I can’t make it to the extra sections, I do those worksheets on my own time since they are posted online along with their solutions. I do my best to attempt every problem myself without looking at the solutions, even if it takes me up to two days to figure out. At that point, I have to ask for help and go to office hours with either the professor or TAs to get a hint, and usually end up being able to solve the problem. Very rarely have I had to ask a TA for the full solution to a problem. \n\nI make it a point to start studying for an exam about 1.5-2 weeks before the test date. When I study, I go through my notes and rewatch lectures for any topics I am shaky on. If I still don’t understand a concept, I seek help from a TA for clarification at office hours. If needed, I review homeworks and projects, though they aren’t pertinent to the types of problems that will be on the exam. Conceptually, I feel like I have everything down at this point. From then on, I do all available practice worksheets on the course page (including ones from past offerings of the course), all practice problems from TA websites, and all available past exams of the course that are relevant. Same drill here; no looking at solutions until I am done, go to office hours to seek hints when I’m stuck, compare my solution to the official solution to see what I could have done better. When doing past exams, I go to the library and time myself to simulate exam conditions. My professor allows us to bring a sheet of handwritten notes to the exam, so I usually fill this sheet up with a summary of every concept with examples (in case I blank out) and all of the things that I learned from my mistakes from the practice problems/exams. If I have extra space, which I usually do, I include some of the trickier problems from past exams in hopes that something similar shows up in the exam I’m about to take.\n\nMy daily routine:\n\nI usually get ~7 hours of sleep (~2AM - 9AM), skip breakfast, go to class for 1-2 hours, go for lunch between 11AM-1PM, more class until 3PM-5PM, study until 7-8PM, get dinner, study more or go to the gym to play pickup if I have time. I try to go to the gym every day, but leading up to the exam, I only go play maybe twice a week. I don’t take naps since it messes up my sleep schedule and I usually start my work the day it’s assigned and turn it in before the deadline to avoid procrastination.\n\nLeading up to an exam I also log off all social media (only message people when needed) to prevent distractions. I don’t watch much TV either so that isn’t a problem for me. On the day of the exam, I make it a point to get 8-10 hours of sleep, though this doesn’t always happen in my favor. I try to have a lax day in that I take my time for everything, whether it’s getting to class or my morning routine or whatnot, as to not increase my stress for that day. I eat before the exam and try to get there 15 minutes early to get settled.\n\nSome things I believe may be part of my problem:\n\n- Sleep. On the weekends I feel well-rested when I get at least 10 hours of sleep. On weekdays I can typically function on ~7 hours, but sincerely wish I got more because I feel much better with at least 8 or 9 hours of sleep. I usually finish my work around midnight or 1AM, but end up staying awake trying to sleep due to noisy roommates/bright lights. This is an issue I’m working on since it may be a long-term factor in the days leading up to my exam and my ability to “connect the dots.”\n\n- Exercise. Although I try to go to the gym every day, I often don’t in the two weeks before an exam because I’m busy devoting every waking moment to practicing for the test. This may be causing me to burn out (even though I don’t really feel burned out), but I read somewhere that exercising helps with memory retention. Not entirely sure about this.\n\n- Not attempting all ideas? When attempting to solve a problem on an exam, I find myself trying to walk through an idea for an approach I have in my head. If I deem it unsafe or unreasonable, I drop the idea and move onto another approach I can think of in my head. I believe this is because my mind is more afraid of putting down an incorrect answer that goes in the completely wrong direction, as opposed to having nothing down for a solution. I might have to work on this, maybe writing down all possible approaches I can think of, then walk through each one on paper instead of in my head?\n\n- Not writing everything out. During the tests I usually draw things out in a before/after manner, like “I have linked list A like this, and I want it to look like linked list B.” Although I feel this approach is good, I might have to start breaking things down into smaller steps between A and B on paper too, instead of just having the starting and ending steps laid out.\n\n- Problem weighting. The skeleton coding questions that I keep blanking on are often the problems worth the most points on the exam, which only frustrates me even more. If I blank on such a question, I find myself going to other problems I did solve and proofreading them to make sure I can get the most points possible on them instead of spending more time staring at the page of my blank solution space. Although I usually do the exam from front to back, an article recommended looking at all the problems before starting to work on any of them just so your brain can subconsciously work on them for you. This seems like a good idea, but I’m not sure how accurate it is. Instead I end up staring at a problem for a good 15 minutes before accepting defeat and moving on. It’s only after I turn in the problem, or a few minutes after the exam that the solution hits me. A TA recommended only trying to work on a problem if I can think of a good approach within 15-30 seconds of reading the problem, but I doubt that helps me if the problems I have left are only the ones that I can’t think of an approach for.\n\nAny other ideas on what I can try to improve for the upcoming exam? Anyone experience something similar? I’m really sick of the same trend happening in every exam, but I want to make a change since I refuse to just accept this “bad luck” to continue hindering me. Any help is appreciated, thank you for reading and have a blessed day!\n\nTLDR; No matter how much I study, I seem to blank on CS exams. Looking for advice on how I can fix this problem.",
