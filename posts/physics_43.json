Why? \n\nLet's say for example he had a telescope that could look all the way down to the planet and he could see them. Would they be moving in super slow motion for 23 years? Or would they be moving normal speed and hed just age 23 years cause like why not?\n\nHow does that work? Time dilation is messing with my brain.  \n\nWhy does time move slower closer to he speed of light? For example I move the speed of light around the earth for 1 week. People on earth age what? Around 2 years? And I age a week?  What? Let's say it's a full light year. Do I only age 1 year? And everyone I knew on earth is old as hell or dead? Why?",

When I used it to reverse a billiards break, the simulation surprised me. I expected it to re-form a stationary triangle of balls and spit out the cue ball. It did not.\n\nThis means that classical physics is non-deterministic and not practically reversible.\n\nAside: The simulator is perfect in that it keeps times, positions, and velocities as expressions--3\\*sqrt(7)/7--rather than using numeric approximations. Its worlds are 2D with circles, infinite walls, and elastic collisions.\n\nWhen trying to understand the results, I found useful threads in Physics Stack Overflow and sci.physics.research from almost 20 years ago. I eventually also found a few references in the philosophy of science.\n\nIf you're interested in classical physics, determinism, or reversibility, see the details, short videos, and open-source code here (free):  [https://towardsdatascience.com/perfect-infinite-precision-game-physics-in-python-part-2-360cc445a197](https://towardsdatascience.com/perfect-infinite-precision-game-physics-in-python-part-2-360cc445a197)\n\n\\- Carl",

But how do you receive all depth information at once with SD-OCT if the reference mirror is fixed as shown in the image? For two photons to interfere, they need to arrive at the same time, so wouldn't only the backscattered broadband light at the same depth as the reference arm be only detected with SD-OCT?

I don't want to change fields, I just want a deep understanding of Physics, and I need structured learning to stick with it.\n\nWhat is the best approach?",

Thing is this  Q factor is on the order of 500,000-1,000,000 and the resonator is fairly big (100 um diameter) so doing long simulations and waiting for field to decay completely is not a great strategy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy current approach is to do shorter simulation with 2-3 cycles to get rough idea where resonances are, then zoom in on them. Guess where exactly center is and run again for 5-6 cycles with extremely narrow wv source. From the decay between cycle to cycle I would then get slope of decay and from that Q factor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy question: Isnt there a better way to do this?",

This effect is unexplored, but it may explain a long-standing paradox. The BCS theory of superconductivity predicts that the superfluid density smoothly decreases at warming. Hence, an established eternal supercurrent must also **smoothly** decrease at temperature increase. However, all observations indicate that the running supercurrent is stable despite temperature variations and **abruptly** disapears at a critical temperature. The theoretical paradox is open, I cannot find any studies about the problem.",
