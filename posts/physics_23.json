        "text": "While reading about wave-particle duality it made me wonder about the mechanics of what happens to the radiation when it is blocked or absorbed. For instance when a high energy wave interacts with a dense enough material is it a case where the properties of the matter cancel out the radiations waveform and negate its effects, as in destructive interference? Or is it that the matter is so densely packed that the radiation hits it like a wall and is stopped/deflected?",

Well use a steel ball for example. To do this id have to have a structure built that can withstand more pressure than the ball can handle, so it remains intact....hard to do when you lack welding skill let alone that much steel.\n\nSo my alternative idea is to build a contraption that allows the bottle jack to apply force upwards, which allows the contraption to use that force, ( or a portion of the force) downawards. That way the earth would be used as the force that surrounds the object....\n\nI may have over explained. Or may jot have veen clear. So heres a super simple picture of what i want to happen.",

        "text": "Hello,\n\nAs a group of first year physics students we are doing a project where we need to cool down 200ml of water by using 2 steel bicycle pumps (hence STUPID; STUdent Powered Ice Device) and a copper connecting tube as far as possible in 30 mins. The gas being compressed and decompressed is only allowed to be air.\n\nWe were given a simulation (FEM) tool which outputs pressure and wall temperatures of 25 elements dividing the two pumps and tube. \n\nFrom thermodynamic principles we know we need to compress gas, remove heat and decompress it. When we use a 2.5 sec cycle with one pump compressing air, and the other pump decompressing it, the decompression pump walls cool down by 8 degrees Celsius (without water) and the compression pump gets quite warm according to Fem. \n\nProblem is: we build the exact same thing in practice and used the same cycle timings for compression and decompression speed. We know that Fem omits one big factor: friction (of course, why not as physicists). This friction even causes the expansion pump to warm up, wich shouldnt happen according to the Fem simulations. Interesting was, when we measured wall temperatures on various places around the expansion pump and connecting tube with thermocouples, we observed that the connection tube at the expansion pump side cools down by about 5 degrees Celsius. According to Fem, this shouldn't happen. We tried to place the water around this part of the connection tube, but the surface of this tube (only 6mm in diameter vs 30mm of the pump) is not sufficient to get significant cooling. \n\nSlower cycles result in less heat around the expansion pump (it stays constant)  we observed, but it causes less cooling with water around the tube. We know a group of last year achieved a cooling of 4 degrees Celsius after 30 mins, but we are at 0.5 degrees max right now. \n\nWe investigated how to get the hot sides cool down more (placing water reservoirs around them ) but didn't look into good cycle timings unfortunately. According to Fem, the faster a cycle is completed, the better the cooling is, but we know there is also an advantage of slow expansion: the gas will perform more work by pushing our Body weight up compared to rapid, non quasistatic expansion. \n\n\nAt this point we don't really know where to make real improvements, especially regarding the cycle timings of compression and decompression, so all of your input is welcome! \n\nWhen you need any additional information, please ask.",

In order to spectate the universe behind the sun which would have not been possible since the sun shines too bright?\n\nb)  if a) is true the following question might not be able to answer, but: If we imagine the acutal location fo the star moving in the directio of the apprant location of the star. And Earth rotating clockwise around the sun. Shouldnt in these cirumstances the apparant location of the start seem to \"stand still in space\" or at least \"move unnaturally slow\" until apprant location and actual location finally aligne?\n\nc) Was there never such case observed before? Or is a) the problem again?",

My ultimate goal is to do a PhD, and while I would be happy to go straight into a PhD this year, a lot of the applications list a masters degree as a requirement, and those that don't didn't appeal to me. I also want to do a masters simply because I find physics really interesting and want to take some higher level courses.  \nSo far, I've narrowed the choice down to 4 options (but I am open to others):  \ni) University of Edinburgh Theoretical Physics MSc  \nii) Oxford MSc in Mathematical and Theoretical Physics  \niii) Cambridge MAst or MPhil in physics  \niv) Perimeter Institute PSI Masters program  \nI will likely apply to all of these, but hypothetically which would you recommend?  \nI would like to be able to do a dissertation (or at least have the option), and this is where the Cambridge program loses value for me, since I can either do a taught degree with no dissertation or a research degree but not both. I'm not big into the usual student social life so that isn't a huge issue for me in choosing where to study. Some manner of funding would also be nice but not strictly necessary.  \nAny help here would be hugely appreciated.",

This is not speculation, but sound observation.\"***\n\nIt seems to come from a credible source, but the author doesn't elaborate the rationale, physics or math behind it.  Naturally, I'm aware that matter and energy bend affect space-time as I thought space-time was like an independent fabric that is warped by matter/energy.  However, the statement in bold states that space-time needs matter and energy to exist and that space-time is dependent on the gravitational field that the matter creates.  If you know of any websites that elaborate on this, I would greatly appreciate it.",

        "text": "Hello people of Reddit\n\nI am a physics student who is in his first year of master degree (3 + 2 system). I'm writing in order to receive some advice or maybe to hear from someone who was in my current situation and managed to get over it. \n\nIn order to pursuemy studies I've transferred to another country upon the completion of my bachelor degree. My problem is that ,although many sacrifices and my hard work, my bachelor degree didn't fully prepare me for the road ahead, what I mean by that is that even though in my previous university the programs were aligned with the admission's requirement for my new university, almost every course I had was very poor on the applicative side of things. To be more explicit: I've studied things like Fourier transform and complex analysis, in the second semester of my second year, but after that course we never had to apply those concepts on our own again, leaving them as a merely theoric notion (admittedly my course in higher mathematics was also very poorly taught, and what welearned was sufficient at best). Moreover in my home country we do not have weekly homeworks, and many of our courses were only based on an oral exam without any exercise whatsover.\n\nMoreover I often find that during classes many details and minutiae completely fly over my head, or that many pointsput forward by my peers to the lecturer are completely unintelligible for me, and that I've to spend extra time after class in order to understand what problem they were actually referring to.  Now in my current university homeworks play an important role for every exam. Although I manage to meet the minimumscore requirement (this is also thanks to the help my collegues who are far more kwnoledgable and smarter than me) I am notas proficient as I would like to be. I have to spend every single moment of my time studying in order to feel at least'adequate', and I've realized that I'm a lot slower than my peers in doing and understanding things, and also thatmany times the solution I propose for the exercises are completly wrong or inelegant. \n\nNow in my next semester I should already looking for a thesis topic to purse, but I don't feel to be ready for sucha task in the slightest. I'm trying to spend extra time and effort each day in order to get rid of my deficencies,but it's extremely hard with all the work I already have to do to be on top of the material.I also don't hang outor engage in any type of recreational activity outside the university (I only exercise at home in order to keepmyself fit) and I'm always trying to optimize my daily routine in order to study even more. \n\nI really don't know what to do at this point, I would like to pause and take care of my deficiencies,learn the local language and do something else outside studying (as a side note since the it is since the bachelor degreethat I've made many sacrifices in order to be able to get high grades, graduate on time, learn English for my master, and be able to purse my studies abroad, so in a certain sense this situation is starting to weight on me) but at the same timeI don't want to ask my parent to mantain me in a foreign country for more time than is strictly needed, and I wouldfeel guilty for that.Moreover I am afraid that If I won't be able to graduate on time I would be looked at badly.So I would like to ask you if you had similar experience, and how did you get through it. Thanks everybody for reading, I relly appreciate that.\n\nI wish you a good day, and better physics!",

The idea ofcourse was not be accepted and black holes had to be rediscovered in the 20th Century.\nNow I wonder, how these two men were able to predict black holes' existence with merely Newton's law of Gravitation? Newton's law works only for masses but light does not have mass (atleast not in Classical Physics) then how did Mitchell and Laplace perform such a spot on prediction?",

It seems to me that physicists have over invested in the theory. And are providing erroneous or just outright junk information and conclusions. \n\nThe theory has not produced any relative substance maybe some conceptual ideas in transistors like quantum tunneling. Or we can predict or explain some effects of electromagnetism. \n\nBut that‚Äôs it. \n\nThis theory seems to be a hindrance on scientific progress. \n\nMostly due to the incorporation as quantum physics as fundamental reality. \n\nSchrodengers thought experiment, with a cat proves the absurd inconsistencies in the output of the equations, however I believe this has more to do with hilberts decidability problem in mathematics. \n\nThe real fun has come with the supposed higs boson particle that governments spent 10 billion dollars to find. Which is very questionable. But that aside they have still found no use for the machine. Expensive junk\n\nQuantum gravity sounds absurd and like patchwork to make the theory work with other theories. We don‚Äôt even understand real gravity but we have quantum gravity? \n\nQuantum computers are also supposed to use superposition? To defy the computation of regular computers by supernatural means?   How do you prove superposition even exist? The literature used to prove this doesn‚Äôt make sense. And the language to describe superposition is misleading.  Billions of dollars of funding to quantum computers to make a expensive paper weight with excuses.\n\nNuclear fusion is no better. As we hear promises of fusion reactions that seem defy intuition or has some supernatural elements  creating enormous energy with a small amount of an element? Doesn‚Äôt this violate the law of conservation of mass and energy We are always a couple years away from a fusion reactor but never materialized with excuses. \n\nBillions down the drain. \n\nWhy are we investing so much into a theory that is giving us nothing. \n\nEveryday I see multiverse theory listed as fact\nStating there are many universes. With no proof? \n\n\nOr how about Hawking radiation predicts black hole evaporations? Again how can I test this? Trust me bro is the new scientific method?\n\nSomebody has got to be playing a joke on us. Maybe I‚Äôm the only one not in on it. Are these people this incompetent? Something isn‚Äôt adding up here. Is it state sponsored meddling to waste our time? Why do we keep investing in this theory expecting breakthroughs when all we get is hype.\n\nWhoever is doing this is definitely a dirty little trickster.",
