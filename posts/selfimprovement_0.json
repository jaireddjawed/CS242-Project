        "text": "I'm 20M and last year I had a alright amount of success with girls (losing my virginity, hooking up twice (once off tinder and off cold approach) and also going on a few dates that didn't really get me anywhere long term. My last lay was last June and I've been focussing on self improvement since than but now since it's been almost 10 months since any date or lay I can't stop thinking about girls and hooking up with them, I also crave being in a relationship which I've never been in. I've been doing online dating, cold approaching, going out to bars but most numbers I get are flakes/they say their busy/ don't respond and it doesn't go anywhere or the girls say they have boyfriends, the only thing on my mind is sex 24/7 and sleeping with new hot girls every single day while also hating being single at the same time. Like it's gotten to the point where despite being happy in my self improvement journey (got a car, my Physique is looking really good and people call me Buff, my social circle and friends are more than I've ever had growing up shy and socially anxious and things are going great), I' m upset with myself for only having a low body count of 2 and never being in relationship, it does make me a bit depressed and feel unworthy especially when your value as a guy is based on how much sex you're having/if you've got a gf. Feels like I'm behind for my age and it's starting to fuck up my mental health.",

It could be a meaningful task to accomplish, goal to pursue, or the use of our strengths in service to others.\n\n•Experience - Looking at an opportunity for a meaningful experience. A meaningful experience with another person, nature, or culture.\n\n•Attitude - When in a difficult situation, there is a meaning to fulfill in choosing the attitude we wish to take.

The things I own  makes my life convenient but they don't make me happy, obviously.

I've always looked at happiness  as having something to look forward to. I don't know how much sense it  makes but that is exactly the thing is what i feel i am missing. I don't  put a lot of weight into all the self improvement &amp; productive  mindset trope because I feel if you really want something, truly, you  will work towards it irrespective of the obstacles.\n\nIdk if this is a rant or a monologue but I would love to hear your  thoughts about it, specially if you find it relatable &amp; have it  worked out.",

        "text": "***TLDR AT THE END***\n\nFound self improvement a little over a year ago, watched guys like Hamza, Cole Hastings, The Art of Improvement, etc, bought several of the common books, had already been going to the gym for several months. The main one was for hamza for me, I could sit and listen to him for hours while I worked. \n\nI did all the stuff, mediation, journaling, reading, quitting gaming, social media, junk food, etc… but it doesn’t last long. After no more than a month I find myself going back to my old habits reinstalling those games, pulling up my McDonald’s app for deals, 30 rack of natural light, delta 8 edibles, and porn to end the night. but pretty much the only good habit I ever retain is the gym. \n\nSo many times I set other goals too of upping my hours at work, trying to minimize my spending to really save up for once (I currently have $100 to my name and end up having to do doordash etc for bills) and trying to get all A’s in college, or I look more to my entrepreneurship side with YouTube or small investments, but it never ever lasts. \n\nI’m not one of the worst cases of self improvement, I’ve always been successful dating, I’ve made solid muscle gains (currently have a more husky build due to poor eating habits) and I’m making my way through college with mediocre grades for a degree that will land me a good job, but I don’t have any guy friends or financial capital. \n\nI’ve flip flopped so many times over the last year, I fall back into my own ways either to cope with my poor mental health or just with a genuine lack of interest in self improvement, wanting to do the bare minimum to get my college degree and move on just living the normie postmodern life.\n\nMy girlfriend has said I’m very self aware for recognizing all of these things and wanting to do better, and she doesn’t know the full extent of my bad habits. We have lots of deep discussions about philosophical/psychological discussions and I’d like to say I do have a nuanced view of the world and my relationship to it. \n\nTo me, it feels like I am constantly trying to search for the lifestyle which will bring me the most happiness and contentment. Now, the self improvement alternative would ideally not include all of the bad habits previously mentioned, ideally just video games, with the occasional drink or high and fast food. But I don’t think I am capable of self moderating these things. \n\nI feel as if I am most susceptible to these bad habits for number of reasons. They all sooth my anxiety and just make me feel comfortable like a kid again, with no worries. I don’t have any friends to support me, or just to make me less lonely. I also have a predisposition to alcoholism. \n\nThis whole self improvement thing in general is nothing like I have lived the last almost 22 years of my life. I have never been aspirational in any way, except for maybe video games. Not in the multitude of sports I tried, and I always did the bare minimum to get by in school, usually making A’s, B’s, and one C. \n\nMaybe I’m just not that kind of person? I’m starting to get tired of the constant sudden shifts back and forth and it’s really beginning to wear on me, far more than I would imagine a life of only bad habits would be, and perhaps my swings back into bad habits wouldn’t be so bad if I tried to make these extreme changes. But I literally have no other idea of how to do it.\n\nTLDR: My mental fortitude is being eroded by my constant shifts back and forth from degeneracy/normalcy to the hardcore self improvement lifestyle. I can’t seem to even be able to commit my mind to wanting one way or the other, it’s not like I want to improve 100% but only lose to my will. Should I just accept my normie fate, get my college degree, work my 9-5 salary job, and enjoy my hedonistic lifestyle? It’s all I’ve ever known, and I just don’t think I have the drive and mental rigidity to commit to such an undertaking.",

I can’t compliment people without cringing. It takes a lot for me to say I love you, even to my parents, I can’t even hug them. It hurts me to compliment people, even my closest friends. I do however feel totally fine being mean in front of people. I just feel so cold. I want to be a nicer person and this is my biggest obstacle.",

It's hard for me to fall asleep but at the same time, once I'm asleep, it's hard for me to wake up. Sometimes I wouldn't even wake up to really loud alarm noises. Now I'm also feeling some sort of tension around my neck and back of my head. The tension is always there but it's more noticable when I'm trying to sleep. I tried fixing my head position while sleeping but nothing helps. I also have some kind of random addictions. For example, I would watch YouTube videos on things that I have no interest in. For example, i would sometimes watch YouTube videos on basketball all night although I have never played or watched basketball my whole life. I may have adhd but I don't know. This is seriously ruining my life bcoz I'm sleeping at random hours and waking up at inconvenient times. T T",

        "text": "My(24M) sister is 26F. When she was around 12 years old, she got diagnosed with a condition that hampers her ability to learn, something to do with light sensitivity, and she got special glasses to counter that.\n\nMy parents felt that allowing her to learn at her own pace might be a better path for her, and put her in a “school” with a homeschooling curriculum. She finished the coursework later than her peers, and graduated with a high school diploma at 21. Afterwards, she did a course in early childhood education, and got a diploma for that. It seems now that she doesn’t want to pursue that line of work. She’s a hard worker and a perfectionist. I know this because when she was working for a year at a childcare, she worked really long hours and didn’t miss a single day.\n\nUnfortunately, she also has poor self esteem(though it’s better than it was previously), and lacks self-assuredness and confidence that she’ll be successful at something if she does her best. She has a high fear of failure, and is very unwilling to step out of her comfort zone. She doesn’t hang out with friends often and maybe catches up with them 4-5 times a year, and she doesn’t have the best social skills. I suggested to my parents that she get therapy, but my mom said that my sister went for therapy for a period of time when she was in her late teens, and seems to think that once she finds a job that she finds fulfilling, she’ll be fine.\n\nThe thing is, she doesn’t seem to have any idea about what she wants to do, and spends everyday watching reruns of shows that she’s seen many times before, or slouched on the couch watching tiktok. I’ve tried to offer help where I can (I helped her with her resume), but I’m deeply frustrated by what I perceive to be a lack of resilience and determination to succeed on her part. She spends maybe 1 hour a day browsing for jobs, but never really gets a reply. It just seems like a halfhearted effort. She’s not physically active at all. I sat her down the other day and explained that she needs to be a bit more serious, that our parents are getting older and we’ll need to take care of their needs soon (implying that they won’t always be around to take care of her), not to mention their siblings who don’t have kids. When my dad got home she broke down and cried, and told him that it was like I said they (my parents) were going to die (I mean they will at some point). It's like she's still teenager.\n\nThat irritated me and I said that she can’t be so mentally fragile, but I apologized later and said I didn’t mean to upset her. I even shared my own previous depression diagnosis (which till then my family was unaware about) and the concrete steps I took to overcome it. But it doesn’t seem to have moved her into changing her routine. Frankly, she is not headed in a good direction, and I am very worried. What concrete steps can we help her take?",

The anticipation of something bad happening is causing greater anxiety, fear, and sleeplessness for people. While uncertainty is truly difficult, at this time it's best to focus on what you can control versus what you can't control.\n\nYou can't control how your company performs, or if your companies decides to have layoffs.\n\nWhat you can control is how you respond at this time. You can control how much effort you put in at work, if you're continuing to build your skill sets, if you're networking and growing your relationships. These are the things you can focus on right now to prepare you no matter what happens in the market that might be out of your control. A good mindfulness practice also helps.\n\nMake sure to keep staying present, aware, and continue your meditation/mindfulness practice.",

I’ve been bullied and harassed out of jobs, schools, friend groups etc. and it’s so odd to me because my friendships and relationships always start off great! We have fun, we laugh, we talk and then all of a sudden one day it’s just BOOM. They think I’m weird, they want to avoid me or have some sort of conflict with me and then it’s over, other people get word of my “weird actions” or “weird behavior” and it’s just hard. It’s made it hard for me to have successful interpersonal relationships and it’s hard for me to believe in myself and who I am because I’m tired of hearing, “oh their just jealous” or “oh they just are weird themselves” when I know it’s deeper than that. \n\nEven now I’ve moved in with my beloved partner who’s been here for me throughout all of this and I started a new job as a barista at a boba shop. Everyone else at the shop is great but there’s this ONE person who gives me off vibes and seems to want to ignore me and interrupt me every chance they get. I try to be nice and not to overly open about anything even how I am feeling in that moment but they just seem to dislike me for no reason when I’ve only been working there for a little while. And even in this situation it seemed to be going great they seemed to enjoy talking to me and then I started showing them my art and talking about my hobbies and then BOOM no more nice coworker. Just weirded out distant and awkward interactions. I want to find what it is about myself weather it be something toxic I need to change or maybe something I just need to have better control over. It’s just hard when your already introverted and scared to make friends or have good positive interactions with people and they shut you down SO fast. \n\nI don’t know what to do and I just need to hear some advice!

I’ve never been in a serious relationship that lasted longer than 4 months. In my early teens until now I’ve been battling mental health and addiction and kind of still do on the mental health part so I tell myself I just wasn’t ready for a relationship until now. Right now I’m paving the way to a meaningful career by doing an apprenticeship that I finally like (tried loooots of things before). \n\nI’m not „unsuccessful“ with guys, I’ve had a few hook-ups but somehow I never dated anybody that was ready for something serious. I’m a more romantic kinda girl and I desire a meaningful and lasting relationship. The thought of me being in my mid-twenties and never having had that in my life makes me think there’s something wrong with me. Technically I know that that’s not true and that I just didn’t meet the right person yet but I can’t shake that subliminal feeling. I find dating extremely exhausting, especially with the job I have (sales, lot of work trips and long work days). I don’t have the time and energy to get to know a random person I never met right now. \n\nStill I’d like to have a partner on my side but somehow I feel I’m just unlucky. I have a big friend group and lots of chances to meet new people but I never met someone who I’d date and who wants to date me too. Every guy I had a crush on didn’t like me back. \n\nI feel hopeless I’ll ever find someone. \n\nHow to cope with that?\n\nThanks for your advice!",

And sometimes i'd get some stating im a really good friend to them or would have no problem turning towards me for comfort. \nBut seriously tho, I truly never think that I am a good friend in particular to anyone.  I am like so neutral to them tbh, as if being nice is just on autopilot. Borderline selfish if I were to judge myself.\n\n\nWhich also explains why everytime I make good memories with any group of friends, I'd feel so unworthy of the happiness I get from them. I'd feel so remorseful for not being a good friend. \n\n\nWith that said, of course if suddenly a friend was to get into an unfortunate event, of course i'd feel genuine concern or care. I just dont know why i feel the way ive described.\n\n\nTo note, I'm also an extreme overthinker. My brain has huge capacity for chaining thoughts. I dont even know why. For everything that i feel, i do have a possible explanation for it, but to type them all out specifically would take too long. \n(Also not sure should this be on this subreddit or the mental health one)",

I was desperate for a way out of my anxiety, and these videos promised to give me the confidence and superiority I needed to overcome my fears.\n\n The very next day, I had a French presentation about polygamy. I didn't practice at all, but I kept that egoistic mindset in my head. And guess what? The presentation went flawlessly. I didn't stutter once,   I got an 18/20 even though I wasn't even prepared!,\n\nThe teacher and all my friends were surprised that my whole personality changed, and I got lots of compliments that day. It was the first time in a long time that I felt good about myself.\n\nThat event got the ball rolling for me to become a more social person in the previous months. That event was a turning point for me. I started becoming more social and confident. I was able to talk to girls without sweating bullets. I started standing up to insults instead of just ignoring them. because I had no choice.\n\nAnd best of all, people started calling and texting me.

Caps because I find it ridiculous I've been so motivated all my life to find a career and live my life but now, quite frankly, I could care less.\n\nIt's scary and I want to change but every time I start I inevitably fall into the never ended \"destroy myself\" circle because of the escape or just plain laziness. Or I blame society for my problems which just justifies how immature I am being. Just the process of applying for jobs and getting denied because of lack of experience or because my resume needed to be tweaked 40 times wears me down. Or the fact that I sleep in, eat poorly, and work out at 50% but, hey at least I got in the gym. This mindset is so bad and I know it but I don't change it. WHY IS THAT?\n\nIn high school, I had grand plans of joining society and making a difference or joining the coast guard to help people (on the swim team, basketball, and volunteering plenty). But college turned me into a cynical, raging, lazy, alcoholic degenerate and I wish I made better choices. Last night I foolishly got pulled over cause my taillight was out and I was not sober. I got away with it but broke down crying thinking of the awful mess I became.\n\nAll advice is welcome. I just don't know where to look at this point.",

It's been a long road and I'm very proud of myself. \n\nMy uni won't hold a ceremony for it, I'll just digitally sign a document and that's it. I'm preparing myself for my first international travel, which was my biggest dream ever, and the document signing will be one day after my flight back home.\n\nI'm thinking of doing something simple and symbolic to celebrate it. I just want to give a special attention to this specific achievement, because I feel like a busy routine keeps me from celebrating things and just choosing what is more practical.\n\nWhat would you do to celebrate an achievement?",

If done everything right, it works, don't get me wrong. But then I may become lazy or think I've got it all figured out, or I don't do it the same way like I used to (this is most often the cas) and the shit comes slowly crashing down again.\nThen after those setbacks, identity crisis kicks in, since I feel and act so differently, and I'm very confused about who I am. Sometimes when I act and feel confident, it feels artifical and inflated and I'm not sure if it's my brain that's addicted to feeling worthless, or if it's not my authentic self. I don't know if anyone gets what I'm saying, I just spat out very thought I had, unfiltered.\nNow being in the same hole after digging myself out the 100th time, it's really starting to feel pointless. In the beginning, when those techniques were new and working, I felt hope and thought I'm gonna make it no matter what.\nSorry for the rant, maybe someone made till the end. \nCheers",

        "text": "Hey guys, looking for some insight I guess.\n\nI'm a early 20's female and it feels like a hard truth that I will never find someone to date. Like, a feel it in your bones kind of thing. \n\nWhen people say \"I'm going to die alone\" they're typically met with reassurance from family and friends, but here's my thought process:\n\nI'm relatively good looking and I do alright with guys; I'm really extroverted and have a lot of friends that I care about. Not to be narcissistic, I'm just trying to paint a picture for everyone. I really love people and one of my biggest efforts is treating people with kindness. \n\nSo it's not that I'm a hermit who stays inside all day or anything. I rarely rarely meet people I want to date but it happened a few months ago after 3 years of unfortunate hookups. Yesterday I found out one of my close friends likes him too so he's definitely off limits now (I'll talk to her about it today). I wasn't really getting anywhere with him anyway so it's for the better. But to be honest it kind of crushed me when I found out.\n\nSo here's my thing: I'm not saying that I'm wildly unattractive and will never be desired. There ARE guys that like me and want to date but I'm not interested in them. Not for stupid shallow reasons either, compatibility and maturity ones. \n\nThere are people who die alone, lots of them. I've never had a boyfriend and there's not much else I can do. I gained confidence, joined sports teams, picked up hobbies, tried COUNTLESS new things to meet new people. And I want to date none of them. There is a real possibility I just never ever meet someone who I want to date and wants to date me, it's just simple math. \n\nIf I never end up with a boyfriend, that might just be a reality I have to face. But I have no way of knowing. I'm finding it harder and harder to pick myself up after these losses. I'm doing everything I can and it's not working. People say to go with the flow but that's not how life works. Everything is math. Everything is a formula, but I'm playing the numbers and somehow losing. \n\nI'm typically high achieving in all other aspects of life and I really don't know what to do right now. This isn't a problem I'm used to having (one I can't understand how to solve). I fuck things up but I know how and why it happened. Not this though.\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nTLDR: well-liked but can't find boyfriend. Feel like I never will and not sure how to grapple with this fact.",

My stomach hurts so much of being hungry. I need to drink a large coffee in the morning (with milk) and eat a small banana. Otherwise I get really pissed because the stomach hurts so much.\n\nAlso: If intermittent fasting is for burning fat and losing weight, how can one do it constantly? I mean, you can not lose weight forever, otherwise you would \"disappear\". So if people claim that intermittent fasting is better for the body, if anything it can only work if you eat your food just some time else but eat the same overall amount.\n\nAlso maybe I have just stupid work hours but 16:8 intermittent fasting seems kinda impossible. It basically requires you to eat before 8 pm and then again after 12 pm. That just works with typical 9-5 jobs.\n\nSorry if I sound kinda pissed but I am hungry and annoyed like hell, even though I ate my first lunch meal.\n\nI look for serious advice here.

Everyone expect me to be confident and secure enough to make my own decision and stand up for myself as a fully grown adult. I have been on and off self-love and self-improvement since I was fresh out off college, I always thought 'I'm finally confident enough' and yet at very same old situations (as minute as people being mean to me) dragged me down again. I'm so tired and fed up with this cycle. I have so many things to take care of, sometimes I got depressed because of this.\n\nI wonder, \"Am I the only one who couldn’t get confident and strong enough to enjoy my 20s?\"\n\nThis's just a vent post but, I welcome and appreciate any advice you might have, I hope that I'll get through this dark night of the soul as soon as possible.\n\nI wish everyone who struggled with the same thing, you'd conquer it soon.",

        "text": "YO HEAR ME OUT \n\nAll these self help addicts want to “overcome the ego” like it’s a problem. They consider any striving for greatness or reaching one’s potential as “ego” and somehow a path to suffering when they sit behind their computer screens and criticize others\n\nThere’s 1. human potential and 2. That which stands in its way. The ego is that which stands in its way\n\nEgo is all the fears, insecurities, shame, anger, ALL THAT HOLDS PEOPLE BACK \n\nIt’s the wondering what others will think of me \n\nIt’s the self doubt and self hatred that drives people mad\n\nHERES THE MIX UP \n\nPeople truly believe that the striving for greatness is ego and the appropriate response to life is to sit on the couch (probably someone else’s) and live within their comfort zones \n\nIt’s SO easy to feel enlightened when you’re inside your comfort zone. You’re the MASTER of your own comfort zone.  Nothing or no one understands just how at peace you feel when left alone and you think this is the highest good BUT what this is describing is the biggest cope\n\nThe point of a belief system is to create real world results, this world is here for YOU to create. \n\nThat creative force comes from deep within you, from your SOUL itself. It’s so innately human to do so - look at how kids play before the adults tell them not to. They build out of sand, blocks, sticks, anything they can get their hands on but it’s innately human to create. \n\nTHEY call this desire EGO and they believe it’s wrong \n\nYou decide 👇👇",

        "text": "Hey guys, new to this sub so sorry if it violates some rules. \n\nSo I've recently acquired a job that has me working intensely for 2 weeks, after which I get 3 weeks off, rinse and repeat. \n\nAs one can imagine there's a lot of freedom that comes with such a schedule. So far, 1.5 weeks into my first free period, I've exercised, nurtured my hobbies (played my first ever rl chess tournament after 15 years of online playing and studying!), gone for walks, met friends and family etc. \n\nBut it's quite easy to get all of those things done in a few hours, which leaves the rest of the 16 hours to just do...whatever. I'm not proud to say I've spent a ridiculous amount of time on social media and youtube, just waiting for time to pass. \n\nHonestly, I'd love to solve this problem by just exercising 6 hours everyday. However with my body/genetics, previous injuries, low apetite and no longer being in my 20's - that's just not feasible. I have a history of overreaching and underrecovering (strength training is what I do most), and training too much unfortunately leaves me with negative consequences lasting for days or weeks. \n\nAnyway, I watched Lex Fridman's \"A day in the life\" video, and felt quite inspired. Among other things he dedicates bouts of time to specifically focus on one single task (e.g. coding or guitar), and only does that one thing (in addition to peeing and drinking water) until the 4 hours or whatever is up.\n\nSo I'm thinking I should perhaps plan my days in advance, and try to decide what to dedicate e.g. 4 hours on doing, while using some kind of app to limit my ability to use social media.\n\nFor some time now I've wanted to learn proper swimming technique (crawl at first), join a Jiu Jitsu gym and learn that, as well as hone my chess skills, meditate more, improve posture by stretching and strenghtening muscles, and just do general reading to become smarter and more knowledgeable about what's going on in this world (so history/social, technology/science, and self-improvement books mainly). And that's probably enough to keep me busy for the rest of my life.\n\nSo a rough idea I've got now is that I'll dedicate the first half of the day on doing those things, as well as consuming the neccessary amount of food for survival and a healthy gut microbiome (so low-processed high-fiber foods). For context I am already quite sugar-addicted (although normal BMI), and fixing my diet is a big thing I know I need to work on. These will be my \"discipline myself to do what I should do\" bout while everyone else is at work. Then from afternoon and forwards I'll either spend the time with my gf, make dinner for her and enjoy each other's company or do whatever she likes - OR - if something specific is happening that afternoon/evening (chess tournament, BJJ beginner class etc) do that.\n\nAnyway, I guess I ended up just rambling here. What I was curious to hear was if you guys'd be interested in brainstorming how you would specifically structure YOUR days and weeks in order to optimize for your own sake. Appreciate all responses, thanks guys.",

        "text": "I realized recently I may be self-centered, but I sincerely don’t know why or even notice it, it just feels so natural. I’m reading about it now (after going down the rabbit hole of a failed date) and I’m realizing that I may be self-absorbed. Most of the classic signs are there, especially making conversations about me. Let me explain my reasoning for this and then let me know where my misunderstanding is:\n\nIf you make a statement (“my day has been terrible.”) and mine has as well, my *natural* inclination is to say “my day has been terrible too” and then explain why, so that you don’t feel alone about having a terrible day, and to potentially show you “it could’ve been a lot worse, cheer up you’ll be ok”. Also because, since I tend to volunteer information/overshare, I just assume everyone else will as well. In the above scenario, I was attempting to be empathetic by volunteering my terrible day and attempting to “relate”, and in my mind, I expect people to do the same; to volunteer information. I assume that if they see me do it, they will take a cue from me and do the same. Is that wrong? I genuinely want to know what the flaw is. \n\nI KNOW there’s a flaw somewhere because it is hard for me to maintain friends. I notice I’m not super curious about others the way I should be and it bothers me. Why? Because of this, I find it hard to make/maintain friends. Like I know somewhere within me I’m selfish but I can’t trace why or figure out how to change. I know I’ve been a terrible friend in the past but I’m not able to make the connection and understand exactly what I’m doing wrong or why it’s wrong. \n\nThey say that when you’re selfish you can’t empathize. I can and do empathize quite often. I donate monthly to multiple charities for causes I truly care about, volunteer my time and try to help others where I can (sometimes TOO much), I can empathize (or at the least sympathize) with other people’s situations, but you know what I’m noticing as I type this? I tend to keep my thoughts to myself a lot of the time. I’m a bit more introverted, and I don’t readily share my full thoughts and feelings because I’ve gotten used to feel like people won’t care/my feelings don’t matter to others (from childhood). I feel like I’m opening Pandora’s box here; a lot is coming to me as I type this. \n\nBut I’ve struggled with this for YEARS. I know I haven’t been a great friend to people, I know I focus way too much on myself, and I’m realizing it causes another issue, with my patience. So many times I’ll get annoyed by a slow driver or something, only for me to drive up along the side and see the driver is someone elderly, or a teen with their parent in the other seat learning to drive and I INSTANTLY feel like shit. Like all before then my thoughts are totally self centered, but when I see the driver I realize their slow driving is not some attack or slight against me, like everything isn’t about me…am I making sense?\n\nAnyway, I really need help. Please, no disrespect or sarcasm, this is truly a plea for help. I’ve taken therapy before but we’ve never delved into the self-centeredness because I didn’t even know I was self-centered so it never came up. I want to improve my communication and connection with others while not sacrificing myself/putting myself last (which was also a problem for me). How do I walk that line between caring about others while still caring about myself/surrounding myself with people who will reciprocate?",
