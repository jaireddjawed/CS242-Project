I would like to keep the price under $1000. Not sure if this matters, but I am also going to Europe (from US) in a few months to Spain, France, and Italy.

I love seeing all the enthusiasm and posts, and thought I'd share my own collection:\n\nThe Casio in bottom center of the first picture was where it all started (digital timex and casio before that). I bought that watch on eBay in high school during the 2006 World Cup. As my interest grew, I looked to Stauer for affordable yet beautiful watches and movements (2nd image). My father encouraged my passion and gifted me a few of the Stauers as well. \n\nAfter college I began to take a liking to Citizen for their style and their ECO drive. Few things more annoying than a watch battery dying on deployment, but I couldn't yet afford a nice automatic. These have been my daily wearers for the last several years. \n\nMy **most recent** purchases are the Hamilton Khaki Officer (daily wear - love the history), Zodiac Grandrally (ZO9606), and the Snoopy Timex (huge space nerd - love it!). \n\n**Dream/Grail** watches: Speedy Moonphase &amp; Grand Seiko White Birch (SLGH005)",

        "text": " \n\nHey everyone,\n\nFirst post on Reddit for me. I recently purchased the Grand Seiko SLGH011 (green birch) from the online boutique. I received the watch on 2/22 and on 2/27 informed them that the watch was running out of spec. It has consistently run between 9 and 13 seconds fast per day. I was told by them that in order to have the brand new watch serviced so that it runs within the advertised specs that I would need to send the watch to them on my dime and insure it ($300+ in my experience). After looking online, I have seen several others that have experienced a similar issue with the new (highly touted) 9SA5 mechanical movement. I've also seen examples now that even after servicing it has come back still out of spec. I just wanted to put this out there for anyone that is considering a purchase with this movement. I have been a fan of the brand for quite some time now and unfortunately am completely done with them. Granted, it was my responsibility to do this research ahead of purchasing the watch rather than after receiving it. Prior to this, I owned a watch with the previous hi-beat mechanical movement (SBGH269) and it consistently ran at +1 sec/day. It just amazes me that they would treat a customer in this fashion who just spent over $9k with them.",

        "text": "I'm coming up for a big promotion at work and want to get myself something nice to celebrate. I'm interested in a watch with nice finishing, a bracelet, and an interesting dial. I'm looking at HAQ because of their lower maintenance, ease of use, and accuracy. The two watches below are the ones I'm currently considering within my budget of $4,000.\n\nCitizen  AQ4091-56M - I'm interested in this watch for its Washi dial, perpetual calendar, and the use of titanium in its case and bracelet.\n\nGrand Seiko SBGP017 - I've loved the dials of many of the upper line Grand Seikos and this would be a chance to have something similar in a HAQ. The display case back is also nice.\n\nBoth watches have jumping hour hands and ae +/- 5 seconds a year.\n\nI'm kind of torn on which to pick as I have several Citizens already and very much like them (Citizen Signature NB0040-58A and NB4003-01H), but would like to branch out to other brands. However the price difference is giving me some pause, the Citizen can be had for $2,600 and the Grand Seiko used is $3,500. \n\nI would love to hear any input from people who have been able to handle either watch in person or who have compared these before as I'll have to order my watch online and won't be able to try it in person first.",
