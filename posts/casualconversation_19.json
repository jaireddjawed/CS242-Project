Older gens I can understand because it's newer to them. But the new gens that are growing up with this stuff. Are we/parents/teachers not teaching kids how to look things up? Is that a thing? \n\nI just can't understand what's going on rn. I had stopped using Reddit because the questions became just mind numbingly stupid I was always angry looking at subs I used to enjoy. And I get back into it and it's just gotten worse. \n\nReddit just seems like anonymous Facebook now. \nBut what are your thoughts? I'd love to hear what others are into and how the subs have changed, or even stayed the same for a long time",

Being vulnerable and sharing thoughts and feelings is extremely tough for me so, I decided a Reddit post would be the best way to get out of my comfort zone. I‚Äôd like to say that I am safe, not depressed or anything. I‚Äôve just had a sad revelation about myself and others. \n\nI just wanted to say that I am lonely. While I do have a few friends and my family that I am blessed to have and care for deeply, I am longing for my special someone. I am starting to think that they either do not exist or I will never find them. Mostly because I notice that many people are also lonely and have no interest in organically creating relationships (romantic or platonic) anymore. When I go out, it seems as though everyone is looking down at their devices. They seem extremely drained, closed off, and robotic. \n\nI‚Äôm not judging, I can understand why people are this way nowadays, we‚Äôre going through a lot as a collective but, It‚Äôs driving us all deeper into loneliness which isn‚Äôt good. \n\nI refuse to try online dating bc of how shallow it is, the many horror stories I‚Äôve heard, and how they are essentially hookup sites. They are dehumanizing.\n\nI have no idea what to do or how to connect to new people anymore. It was once so easy for me but, times and people have changed. If anyone has some online groups you‚Äôd like to invite me to or any advice on how to make friends as an adult in 2023, I am all ears.  If you‚Äôd just like to say ‚ÄúHello!‚Äù And that you relate, I‚Äôd like that. It would make me feel better to know I‚Äôm not alone in my feelings. \n\nI am only in my mid 30‚Äôs but, I feel so out of touch with how to make new friends in today‚Äôs time.esp with men Lol!

My regional Netflix doesn't have all of them; just Arrow. I am up to Season 5 and the Earth-X episode is so confusing and annoying because I skipped so much plot because Arrow is the only Arrowverse show on Netflix. There have been mild and successful events when the Oliver Queen (Arrow) meets Barry Allen (Flash) but a few seasons later there have been cross-over episodes with people I barely recognise because Supergirl and LoT aren't on Netflix. There are some characters that died or went missing in Arrow and magically appeared in the cross-overs because of other series like nothing happened.\n\nRiverdale is oddly more understandable but I can see how people were confused about how a second universe was created by an explosion and how it broke the line. But at least Riverdale didn't have confusing cross-overs like Arrow; Sabrina is threaded finely with Riverdale but the Arrowverse feels broken and confusing. Arrow doesn't mention how John Diggle lost his daughter and gained a son and was fine with that, but Flash does mention how; which I can't look into because Netflix's regional thingy.",

How to be a human. Aside from this, just learn how to speak, read, write, type, very basic math, and maybe how to fix certain things with tools.\n\nI was thinking school would be super basic and short time, like a daycare, which would teach them simply how to read, write, speak, and similar simple thing. Then, after that time is over, kids can go to a local arts and crafts, cooking, singing and dancing, or whatever, in their area. Or, if the day care school offers stuff like that too, then great!\n\nI was thinking this would be until the age of about 10. Then, the normal subjects of schools can be taught from ages of 11-18.",

I always had a passion for writing, but I never pursued it seriously because I was too scared to take the risk of leaving a stable job.\n\nOne day, I just couldn't take it anymore. I was miserable going to work every day, and I knew deep down that I was meant to do something else with my life. So I took the leap and quit my job to pursue my dream of becoming a full-time writer.\n\nIt wasn't easy at first. I had to hustle hard to make ends meet, taking on freelance gigs and odd jobs to pay the bills. But I never lost sight of my goal, and I kept working on my writing every day.\n\nSlowly but surely, things started to pick up. I landed a few big writing gigs that helped me pay the bills and build my portfolio. I started to get more clients and more recognition for my work. And most importantly, I started to feel truly fulfilled for the first time in my life.\n\nNow, I'm proud to say that I'm a successful writer with a thriving career doing what I love. It's not always easy, but it's worth it.\n\nSo to anyone out there who's feeling stuck or unfulfilled in their career, I encourage you to take the risk and pursue your passion. It might not be easy, but it will be worth it in the end.\n\nThanks for reading, and I hope this post inspires you to take the leap!",

I don't really feel that motivational feeling when thinking about dedicating my life to say - help people or make the world a better place for humans. I don't get that push or idea of satisfaction of how great it would be.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, I'm not evil. I would never do anything bad to another person and would 100% help them if I could, and I often do, but just that idea of dedicating a big portion of my life and going out of my way to specially help and make the world a better place just doesn't kick me anymore.\n\nWhen I was younger I wanted to be a programmer - help solve the worlds problems with technologies, help people, I was coding for 5 years. Then I though maybe a philosopher - solve more concious problems of existence.\n\nNow all I have in mind is becoming an architect - seeing beauty in my fullest through creation, get the possible fame and money, die a story.\n\nI don't want to help people I want to help myself and I don't know what to be motivated by anymore. I can't control it eitherway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: motivation is mainly fame and power, though I don't want it to be that way.

I feel like they started this because some people don't tip anything.  I hate being cheap, but I also like saving money where I can. What is the norm in these situations? I never know how much to tip on grocery orders in general, and now this... obviously a % could get crazy with how much a order of groceries can add up to. Lets say my Amazon fresh order is 100.00, and the delivery fee is around 3.00. What would an average tip be you think?",
