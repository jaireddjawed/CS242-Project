        "text": "I acknowledge the terrible danger I risk in [crossposting](https://np.reddit.com/r/ShitWehraboosSay/comments/3ivxjp/straight_of_a_comic_book_cracked_covers_the_me262/) this from our Übermensch comrades at /r/ShitWehraboosSay, but I found it to be much more plain badhistory than something as slanted as wehrabooism, so I shall brave the potential fires here.\n\n\nNow I rather like Cracked, they got some good writers and some of their articles are pretty damn funny, and some of them are even pretty damn funny *and* relatively informative for two paragraphs of pop media, and in my opinion they're history articles are *generally* alright. Broad over-generalizations usually, but over-generalizating in the right direction. That being said there are still some that strut too far out of the coop of acceptability and offer themselves up to tired and mildly inebriated foxes. [Case in point.](http://www.cracked.com/article_22398_6-famous-weapons-from-history-with-baffling-flaws_p2.html)\n\n\n\nSo it's a rundown of six iconic pieces of military hardware from WW2 (except for one) and giving us the skinny on why they apparently 'secretly sucked.' I'll run over these ones except for the F-14 which I don't know jackshit about.\n\n\n\n**#1: The silly corsair couldn't land on carriers.**  It takes some sort of gumption to throw one of the most effective zero-murderers of the war into an article about why these things 'secretly sucked', and apparently in this context 'sucked' means 'it couldn't land on an aircraft carrier.' Which is sort of true, the first variants of the F4U were very tough to land on carriers and much more suited to airstrips which is ironic for a plane meant to be the new carrier fighter. Of course the article doesn't mention that later versions were touched up and it did become more widely used on carriers where it had a very eventful career playing kick-the-can with the remainders of the IJAF. \n\n\n\n**#2: The first P-51 was a 'carbon copy' of Axis fighters.**\n\n\nThis one is just fucking dumb. The writer takes a picture of an [early Mustang](http://i.crackedcdn.com/phpimages/article/3/5/0/442350_v2.jpg) and holds it up to a picture of a [109](http://i.crackedcdn.com/phpimages/article/3/5/0/442350_v2.jpg) and a Japanese [Ki-61](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Kawasaki_Ki-61_Hien_with_drop_tank.jpeg/1280px-Kawasaki_Ki-61_Hien_with_drop_tank.jpeg) and claims that the P-51 was constantly on the recieving end of friendly fire, with [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX8-73sWFJg) youtube clip to support this. \n\n\nAnd given the Mustangs consideraby superior performance (and given that it doesn't look much like the 109 or 61 ANYWAY) I'd say calling it a 'carbon copy' is a *tad* misleading.\n\n\n\n**#3: The 262 would've won the air war too if it wasn't for that meddling Fuhrer!**\n\n\nDancing on the edge of Wehrabooism here so I'll dance lightly. But it makes the usual claim that if only that silly Adolf didn't insist on using the Me262 as a bomber that the Luftwaffe could have cleared the skies of Allied airpower. Forgetting that -impressive as the 262 was as an air supremacy fighter- that bombing severely hampered the numbers of 262's that could be made and Germany had a limited number of competent pilots it could use to man these new planes. And while the 262 was pretty dominant as a dogfighter, allied pilots [turned to destroying them on take off and landings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messerschmitt_Me_262#Counter-jet_tactics) to compensate.\n\n\n**#4: The Sherman was a a fire-hazard.**\n\n\nI'm getting tired more so I'll short answer and let the R5 handle the rest. Initially yes when it first rolled out, but it was patched up and then blown out of proportion by people who couldn't accept that anything could defeat their beautiful Krupp steel. \n\n\n&gt; [Next up is the legendary \"Ronson\" moniker. People often point to the fact the Sherman uses an aircraft engine as evidence of how the Sherman would light up \"first time, every time\", as per the tag line of the source lighter. Now the engine may have been an aircraft engine, but that does not mean it must run on high octane fuel as this famous Youtube personality erroneously explains. [1] Instead of high octane gasoline the Sherman used more often than not around 80 octane fuel, that's a lower octane rating than the lowest octane rated gasoline available at a gas station today, not to mention the ratings for octane differ on the type of vehicle being used. The standard 110 aircraft octane rating fuel is actually more around 130 octane fuel for ground vehicles. Now the Ronson myth does however have a bit of truth to it. Early Shermans had very vulnerable ammo racks which were stored in the \"humps\" near the front of the hull. [2] The placement of these ammo racks made it easy for German gunners to know where to hit for catastrophic kills on the Sherman tanks. The army knew of this problem and moved immediately to fix it. The army developed \"wet\" ammo racks which involved putting the ammo racks inside of water filled jackets to douse any embers or fires immediately, and they also moved the ammo racks to the bottom of the tank to reduce the chances of them being hit by AT weapons. Wet stowage reduced the chances of an ammo rack fire or detonation in Sherman tanks to only 15% compared to 60-80% of dry stowage Shermans. The conclusion on the Ronson myth is that while there is truth behind it, the myth has been so overblown as to rival the invulnerability myth of the Tiger.](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/38gqva/m4_sherman_common_myths/)\n\n\n\n\n**#5: The B-29 was a real 'firebomber' if you get my drift.**\n\n\n\nRemember the most powerful and effective long-range bomber of the war? Apparently it really 'bombed' because Hap Arnold cut production costs by using magnesium alloys in the engines which apparently made the damn thing light up easier than Shermans because by golly successful designs just aren't sexy without some tragic flaw! He doesn't even provide sources for this claim at all, which is low standards even for Cracked. And do I really need to defend the effectiveness of one of the world's most groundbreaking planes that paved the way for new strategic bombers that effectively performed the most devastating bombing campaign in history? \n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "[This video](https://youtu.be/Mimt44cg1fs?t=4m24s) is bad history. It's bad history on many levels, but really, as soon as you'll click it, you'll understand. Now, you could click it, or I could just say five words:\n\nAncient Aliens on Piri Reis\n\nWhich, to some of you, are magic words that make you burst out laughing, hang your head, or some combination of the two. Others of you may not have heard this phrase before, and for those, let me offer a brief explanation. \n\nThe [Piri Reis map](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Piri_reis_world_map_01.jpg) is a map from 1513 by Turkish cartographer Piri Reis. It clearly shows the coasts of South America and Africa, but from there, it's been claimed to show everything from Atlantis to Antarctica. In the particular video I linked, the History Channel show \"Ancient Aliens\" is arguing that it not only shows the Antarctic coast in explicit detail, it also couldn't possibly have been made without going into space, thus demonstrating its alien origin. The trouble with this interpretation - beyond the fact that it's highly unlikely - is that it misunderstands 16th century map technique.\n\nTo start with, the claim that Ancient Aliens makes that it's a 16th century azimuthal map is incorrect. While azimuthal maps were fairly common at the time, the Piri Reis map uses a different method of projection. Azimuthal maps would centre the map on a particular location - it's commonly claimed that this one is centred on Egypt, but it's not, and wouldn't have been as the style of Islamic maps at the time was to centre the world on Mecca - and then curve the world around that location, resulting in curved lines of latitude and a curved equator. However, the Piri Reis map doesn't do that. Instead, the fact that it has a straight equator means it's probably a cylindrical projection, a much less common technique, but one that gives straight lines of latitude, including a straight equator. Equally, the fact that it's a cylindrical projection betrays a basic fact that the Ancient Aliens people missed - the fact that something can be viewed from the air doesn't preclude modeling it on a globe. People had globes in the 16th century, and could easily use those to help make maps. \n\nBut that's just pedantry about map types. What about the heart of it? Does the map show Antarctica? Is it possible for it to do so? Is the map even accurate? Well, no. \n\nFor starters, even its Old World geography is off. There are too many rivers in the wrong place in the Iberian peninsula, for instance, and the Niger headwaters make no sense. If it had been drawn by aliens, they were aliens that needed glasses or a better way to distinguish \"water\" from \"not water.\" The same holds true with the random islands scattered throughout the Atlantic. I would expect better of my aliens, and hope they'd be able to recognise the difference between islands and ocean. North America, too, is completely garbled, descending into a large collection of islands rather than what North America actually looks like. The map is great for showing early 16th century ideas of these land masses, and is great at getting into the heads of early cartographers, but accurate is not a word I would use to describe the map.\n\nBut it's that chunk at the end of South America that's interesting. The explanation that Piri Reis gives for it in the margin notes is that it was a place that Portuguese explorers were blown to where it was very hot and the day was 22 hours long. It certainly implies a southern place, but given that the map is fairly accurate about latitude, it seems unlikely that there was actual thought that this was Antarctica. There are two more likely explanations. The first is that the sailors were blown further south, but didn't realise where they were in terms of where they ought to have been, and so misrecorded their route. This was then recorded wrong on the map as being a continent that stretched out east rather than south. Another possibility is one that better follows 16th century map-making technique. Ptolemaic cartography involved a principle of \"balancing the world,\" one that led to a tradition of cartographers inserting landmasses where they thought there ought to be one, even if there wasn't. While this practice was largely dying by the time actual landmasses were discovered west of Europe, it's still entirely possible that the Piri Reis map is a holdover from that tradition of inserting *terra nullius australis*es. \n\nWhat Ancient Aliens is doing here, beyond making up geography, is thoroughly misunderstanding 16th century cartography. It was not uncommon for cartographers to claim they were using older sources to give their maps credibility, but that doesn't automatically mean they're relying on ancient sources. Equally, the Piri Reis map as we have it is half a map - even when Piri Reis does claim to be relying on knowledge from Alexander, that knowledge is more likely to be from the east than the newly explored west, from which he explicitly states he's gathering knowledge from the Portuguese and their maps. Ancient Aliens also misunderstands that globes were a thing, and just because they couldn't make this map doesn't mean the map had to come from aliens. \n\nAlso, aliens. That's bad history in and of itself.\n\nSources!\n\n[This](http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/pseudosc/piriries.htm) is a great article examining the Piri Reis map.\n\n[More about maps than you ever wanted to know](http://www.bsu.edu/libraries/collections/gcmc/tutorials/pdfs/mapscartographymapprojections.pdf)\n\nAlso \"Cartography in the traditional Islamic and south Asian societies\" by J.B.

Both are essentially the same film; shot at the same time with a slight change in the cast. Siva was released in 1989 where as Shiva was released a year later. \n\nThe documentary referring to Shiva as belonging to Mumbai Noir is extremely dubious since it was shot in Hyderabad and was the product of Telugu movie industry. For the uninitiated, Bollywood is not equal to Indian movie industry. Bollywood is a part of a movie industry that deals with movie in Hindi language. There are a lot of *woods in India depending on the language, but many of us Indians bemoan the lack of interest in western media in trying to be factual(I dread for the day where people start referring to Apu trilogy as Bollywood movies). \n\n[This is what the documentary showed.](https://gfycat.com/UniformTanArieltoucan)     \n\n[The exact same scene in Siva which was released a year before Shiva.](https://gfycat.com/RapidBlankCirriped)  \n\nBoth Siva and Shiva aren't Mumbai noir, as they were shot in Hyderabad(everyone who has interest in movies knew that the director was a Telugu guy and so is most of the cast). The city isn't a prominent character in the movie, but it is the college which provides the setting for much of the movie. \n\nIt wasn't until 1998, that RGV makes *Satya.* Writing the review of *WORLD FILM LOCATIONS: MUMBAI*, Usah Iyer writes:\n\n\" Mazumdar’s\nessay  on \n“\nMumbai  Noir\n” \n–\na\nterm \nthat \ngained  currency  in  the  1990s \nand  is \nsynonymous  with “urban  decay,  crime,  claustrophobia”  (68)\n–\ndiscusses  films  suc\nh  as \nParinda\n(Vidhu  Vinod \nChopra,  1989), \nIs Raat ki Subah Nahin\n(Sudhir  Mishra,  1996), \nand \nSatya\n(Ram  Gopal  Varma, \n1998)\n, the last\nbeing \nthe defining film of this genre. Mumbai Noir is characterized by tropes of \nfilm  noir,  including  moral  ambiguity\nof  characters\n,  nocturnal  journeys  through  the  city\n,  and  in \nMazumdar’s\nformulation, the \n“aesthetics of garbage” \n(a term she has expanded on in her book), \nreferring  specifically  to \nSatya’s\ndepiction  of  urban  waste\n,  reflected \nin \nBombay’s \nspaces \nand  its \ncharacters. \"\n \n\nSatya is universally considered to be the epitome of Mumbai Noir and unlike the documentary's claim..

        "text": "The topic of today's post is [this quote](https://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/39331l/archaeologists_in_france_open_coffin_and_discover/cs0l2vi) which argues that the reason Lenin's body was preserved in state indefinitely was because of fears that his body not decomposing in the dead of winter would be seen as a miracle. The truth is actually quite the opposite.\n\nWhen Lenin died in 1924, there was a flurry of activity to try and decide whether or not to preserve him. Lenin had expressed the desire to be buried next to his mother, but for the Soviet leadership, this came with a host of potential problems. With Lenin's death, the question of the survival of the Soviet Union itself came into play, with some believing that Lenin's death would lead to its collapse. Others feared that if Lenin had a state funeral, no one would come because Moscow in January is bloody cold. However, even as these debates raged on, thousands of people queued up outside where Lenin's body was being stored to pay their respects, leaving Soviet leaders to extend how long he could be viewed to forty days, and moving him to more and more complex refrigerated coffins.\n\nThe forty day decision was made partly due to the logistics of wanting as many people as possible to be able to view Lenin and participate in the mourning process, but also tapped into Orthodox tradition to try and bolster the legitimacy of the Soviet government. Forty days, for instance, is the traditional mourning period in Eastern Orthodoxy, and there is an orthodox belief that the body of a saint doesn't decay, something which could be exploited to once again further the idea that the Soviet government was the legitimate one. \n\nHowever, as spring approached and temperatures began to rise, the refrigerated coffins the Soviets had been using became less and less capable of actually preventing Lenin's decay, which led to more drastic measures. A special super refrigerator was ordered from Germany, but there were fears that it would arrive too late to be able to preserve Lenin. Instead, Vladimir Vorobiev and Boris Zbarsky, two leading experts in embalming in Russia, were brought in to preserve Lenin's body. While the technique of embalming an entire body was experimental at best - both men thought it could *theoretically* be done even if they had no practical experience with it - they soaked Lenin in a solution of glycerine and acetate, and polished off mould spots with acetic acid. It worked, more or less, and the Soviet government built an ornate mausoleum to display Lenin in in perpetuity. \n\nUltimately, the reason behind Lenin's preservation did partly reflect religious fears, but also thoroughly exploited them. Lenin represented the beginning of the Soviet Union, and so was preserved as its \"saint.\" As time went on, being able to see his body made him a more real presence in Soviet politics and for the citizens of the Soviet Union. While part of his original preservation was due to luck and accident, the decision to preserve him, once it had been made, was a stroke of genius.\n\nSources!\n\n[This](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/08/health/research/lenins-death-remains-a-mystery-for-doctors.html) is a good article about Lenin's death and the mystery surrounding it.\n\n[Here's](http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/08/world/americas/venezuela-chavez-embalming/) another article talking about the tradition of leaders getting embalmed, and how Lenin's embalming was not without controversy.\n\nAnd [another](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-16283257) good article about embalming",

        "text": "So I was reading a rather interesting article on the history of the sewing machine [(Link)](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/how-singer-won-sewing-machine-war-180955919/?no-ist) when I came across this claim:\n\n&gt;But why did Singer's (sewing machine) prove to be the one with staying power? It was not due to Isaac Singer himself, who Liebhold describes as more of a “scalawag” than a businessman. Rather, it was the smart businessmen who took charge of the company, particularly lawyer Edward Clark, who co-founded I.M. Singer &amp; Co. He created the company’s early advertising campaigns and devised the “hire-purchase plan” for customers who could not afford the machine’s high price—the first installment-payment plan in the United States.\n\nWas Isaac Singer a \"scalawag\"? I have no reason to doubt it, although it doesn't sound like a very nice thing to say about a notable inventor. Was it smart businessmen rather than tech innovation that led to the company's success? I imagine it's more of a combination of the two. Was Edward Clark really the creator of the advertising campaigns? Again, I have no reason to doubt that, although the article gives me the impression that Clark was the \"scalawag\":\n\n&gt; Clark also had the wisdom to squeeze the volatile Singer out of active management of the company, dissolving their partnership in 1863 and forming the Singer Manufacturing Company.\n\nAnyway, the problem is the last claim - that the Singer \"hire-purchase plan\" was the first installment payment plan in the United States.\n\nM'ladies and gentlesirs of badhistory, there were installment payment plans in the United States before the Singer company came up with theirs. I will present a counterexample, Eli Terry's clockmaking works. I have no idea if *this* was the first installment payment plan in the US (I rather suspect the practice goes back to the origins of the monetized economy), but it's definitely earlier than Singer.\n\nEli Terry (1772-1852) was another American 19th C inventor, although he worked on clocks rather than sewing machines. His innovations were mostly in the area of serial production, radically reducing the amount of skilled labor required to produce clocks. He was also one of the pioneers in in the design of the shelf clock, a (comparably) compact design that largely superseded the tall clock.\n\nIn short, Eli Terry focused his efforts on making good-enough, cheap-enough clocks for the mass market rather than *objets d'art* like the tall clock or marvels of horological precision like the naval chronometer. And how did he crack that mass market?\n\nYep, the installment plan. Source: [*Reflections in Bullough's Pond: Economy and Ecosystem in New England* by Diana Muir, page 121](https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=D3Y6pIh4fQgC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=installment+plan+eli+terry+clock&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dG4nRmiTlr&amp;sig=F7q0iMf0OUQEm-U2zhpp-m25p9c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAWoVChMIt9yQiJfLxwIVCVk-Ch0mVwxt#v=onepage&amp;q=installment%20plan%20eli%20terry%20clock&amp;f=false)\n\n(I really lucked out on that page being online, my first two choices were in books and I thought I was going to have to use a reference to one of them in some shitty blog or something).\n\nWhile neither source gives us a precise year in which the installment plan was introduced, Eli Terry died in February 1852 [(wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Terry), was wealthy by 1833 and spent his later years getting back to his roots as a clockmaker, for example making church clocks and other one-off projects. Certainly the installment plan for his clocks was introduced before 1852 and very probably well before 1833. The Singer Corporation wasn't even established until 1851, and our scalawag Ed Clark didn't kick out Isaac Singer until 1863.\n\nThis is what you get for calling people scalawags, Smithsonian. I will see you after class.",

        "text": "I know pulling stuff off my Facebook wall is low-hanging fruit, but I couldn't let [this](http://i.imgur.com/4jnRVoD.png) go by without comment, even if it is an old Scottish woman ^talking ^^about ^^^a ^^^^flute. \n\nBasically, I have no shame.\n\nWhat Sybil's talking about here, though, is part of a greater perception of Native Americans, namely that they can all be encompassed either under the label \"peace-loving forest folk\" or \"horrible war-mongering barbarians.\" History seems to have fluctuated between these two opinions with not much space between. While I think we are currently gaining a more nuanced view of Native American history - especially pre-Columbian history - that doesn't mean the popular view is any less influenced by things like Pocahontas or that Sybil's comment here misrepresents that popular view. There is a view that Native Americans were peace-loving, one-with-nature people, and it's one that I think is fairly prevalent outside academia or subs like this one. I'd like to talk about it.\n\nI'll focus on plains Indians, since I'm pretty sure that's where these particular people are from. With Plains Indians, as with all groups, there is a long and illustrious history of warfare. As one example, between 1300 and 1500 CE, we find compelling evidence of Coalescent and Middle Missouri groups - precursor groups to later groups like the Hidatsa, Mandan, and Arikara - bickering over the Missouri River Trench. After a dramatic climate shift, both groups wanted the fertile land around the Missouri River, and each tried to establish settlements there. However, several settlements have been found that are half-finished. The later the settlement, the more thorough its fortifications, and the fewer artefacts that were found, once again implying that people were driven out before they could establish a long-term home.\n\nOne particular problem with sites like these, however, is the concern with distinguishing between people leaving a place voluntarily, violence within a community, and warfare. An abandoned community, for instance, isn't always indicative of raiding, and bones that show signs of violence aren't always showing war. However, in the case of these communities, the existence and build-up of fortifications implies an external enemy rather than an internal one. In many of the settlements, the fact that the fortifications went up before the permanent housing also suggests a legitimate fear of outside invaders, one that was completely justified, if the number of abandoned settlements is any indication. \n\nOther indications of warfare can be found in a place like Crow Creek, South Dakota. Here, archaeologists found a trench filled with the bones of more than 486 people, all deliberately buried, and most suffering some massive head trauma from a weapon. What's more, the fact that the bodies had been fed on (with teeth marks from carnivores on the bones) suggests that they were lying outside, unburied for a prolonged period of time. The lack of young women, too, suggests that this wasn't a ritual or a friendly game of bonk'ums gone wrong. It had all the hallmarks of a village getting wiped out, and then other people coming later and burying the dead. War is the sort of thing that tends to do that. \n\nWhat I find most interesting, though, is the discussion over *why* there was warfare in pre-contact America, especially given the historical idea that it was something that started after Columbus. Part of that, no doubt, stems from an infantilisation of Native Americans (which is part of what I see the original post doing, however unconsciously), but part of it also stems from a bigger consideration of what causes war in the first place. What the example of the Missouri River Trench suggests is that warfare was caused by climatic shifts that rendered some areas unusable for farmland. People would then move into areas that were more suitable, sometimes encountering other people with similar ideas, and getting annoyed at them. By around 1200, for instance, conditions in the Great Plains that had previously been great for growing corn instead became hotter and drier, leading more and more groups to compete over the best agricultural areas. Hence, warfare. Equally, expansion from eastern groups drove more and more people west, creating further tensions between groups already straining for limited resources. Conflict was inevitable.\n\nMy point, essentially, is that Native Americans were like all other people - prone to conflict in the right conditions. Their reasons for going to war were the same as other groups', both in the Americas and around the world. Their methods weren't too terribly different. Native Americans, like everyone else, were perfectly human. \n\nSources!\n\nI mostly relied on \"Indigenous people, indigenous violence: precontact warfare on the North American Great Plains\" by Douglas Bamforth published in Man because it is such a great article and because it does such a great job looking at the history of evaluating warfare in pre-contact America. It's great, and I highly recommend it.",

        "text": "Living in the West has a few unfortunate realities of life. It's hot, dry, and the only things anyone knows about your state come from westerns and news blurbs on the drug war. That's okay though, because it gives me an excuse to talk about cowboys. Today's excuse comes courtesy of [/u/DrColdReality](https://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/3ifafp/after_watching_tombstone_i_am_curious_to_know_how/cughkov).\n\n&gt; And the incidence of shooting of any type was WAY rarer than the movies make it out to be. The big cities of the east had much higher murder rates than any frontier town. Indeed, in just about any town where there was a rule of law at all, carrying guns inside town limits was illegal. It was in Tombstone, and that's one of the things that led to the OK Corral shooting.\n\n\nIt's quite easy to imagine that people in the frontier west were generally decent folk. After all, no one in their right mind would want to live in a world nearly as violent as the West portrayed by Hollywood. It's comfortable to think that historic people were just like modern humans in another time, with the same motivations and standards. The reality is that Hollywood was much closer than our commenter would have you believe. \n\nRule of law was at best a weak concept in the incorporated territories. Centralized civil authority was virtually non-existent outside the major towns and violence was endemic to the region. The largest town in what would become Arizona was Tucson, a staggeringly large city of almost 15,000 people in 1880. Its homicide rate was similarly high, at a population adjusted 125 homicides per 100,000. If Tucson had maintained this rate into the present day, it would be the [second  most violent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_by_murder_rate) city in the world. The current winner has a staggering 171 homicides per 100,000. \n\nIt's important to discuss what the homicide rate means in a historical context in order to compare these numbers. For the wild west, the major sources of intentional deaths were murder, suicide, and fighting with Apache and Mexican warriors. The latter accounted for as almost as many deaths as murder did, but is not included in historical statistics due to a lack of data, nor are unreported murders. Our best historical estimates are far under the actual rate and include only a portion of the activities encompassed by modern statistics. By comparison, the contemporaneous rates for Philadelphia and New York City are 2.5 and 3 per 100,000 people respectively. That's almost 40x less than Tucson, the political capital of Southern Arizona territory. The 'wild west' was quite wild indeed.\n\n&gt; In 1881, the year of the OK Corral incident, the town of Tombstone had its most violent year EVER--before or since: a grand total of six murders. And three of those were from the OK Corral. People were shocked at the level of bloodshed.\n\nI hadn't heard this particular tidbit before, but it's apparently a [right-wing myth](http://www.treygarrison.com/2010/04/more-guns-less-crime/). It interested me enough that I actually went through the Tombstone graveyard records for 1881. Even discounting the three deaths at the OK Corral (Billy Clanton, Frank McLaury, Tom McLaury) and a teamster killed by Apache, there were 9 graves marked as murders. The *Tombstone Epitaph* records several more murders that year from train robberies and drunken saloon wagers, which works out to a murder rate of *at least* 110 per 100,000. More unfortunately for our OP, 1881 was a relatively tame year for Tombstone. The following year saw the addition of 16 new murder victims to the graveyard and the newspaper recorded even more. By the mid-1880s, Tombstone would be overwhelmed with racial violence and raiding as Apache raids were forcibly suppressed by soldiers and immigrant merchants moved into the burgeoning region. \n\nThe Southwest has never been a very peaceful place, but the years of the frontier period were among the bloodiest in American history. Range wars, Indian raids, and conflicts with settlers led to thousands of deaths as America expanded into the harsh terrain of the West. The showdown at high noon may have been a myth, but the violence and brutality of the period are difficult to exaggerate. ",

However, with three classes about the history of furniture under my belt, I am taking it upon myself to bring a particularly heinous bit of bad historyfrom that film to light: [this chair.](http://imgur.com/X5ufdDa) \n\nThat chair is  meant to be the throne of Ramses II in the film. There’s a number of things wrong with it: its size/shape, its lack of decoration, and the material it's made out of. \n\nFor the most part, chairs in ancient Egypt, even thrones, weren’t that huge. Most of the chairs I’ve been able to find were fairly average sized, but highly decorated. They also weren’t that shape. [Here is a good example of what an actual ancient Egyptian throne from around that time period looked like.] (http://www.veniceclayartists.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/17-Ecclesiastical-chair.jpg) That throne belonged to Tutankhamen. It’s made of wood, and highly decorated with gold, silver, and inlaid with many precious stones. [Here is a another one of King Tut’s Thrones](http://www.comeseeegypt.com/images/tutthrone.jpg). Like the previous throne, it is made of wood and covered in gold, silver and precious gyms. This one also has legs shaped like animal legs, which was typical for chairs during this time period. It also has images of the [king’s wife serving him while he sits on an ancient Egyptian chair.](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7169/6511403009_59824b57b2_b.jpg)\n\nNow, this was a pretty egregious example of bad history, but don’t let it deter you from watching the film. While it may play fast and loose with chair history, it’s still an excellent film. ",

        "text": "I've been watching a documentary called Ancient Warriors: The Macedonians (Found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OESi-nFvED8). It contains bad history. A lot of it. So as part of this step-by-step viewing, I shall take an imaginary shot of whiskey (Canadian Club, the gentleman-scholars drink) for each error that appears. I shall also be using BC rather than BCE because SCREW those heathen, non-Christian barbarians who do not recognize a proper dating system.\n\n0.59: A Macedonian soldier wears maille. Maille was not used by the Greeks in the 4th century BC . It was supposedly invented by the Celts before being adopted by the Romans and other Mediterranean cultures in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC. DRINK!\n\n2.02: An armoured Macedonian soldier is using a bow. If the soldier was using a bow, he would likely be a skirmisher, and would not be armoured. Additionally, only officers, heavy cavalry and the front ranks of the sarissa phalanx wore armour in the Macedonian army during the reign of Philip, not bowmen. DRINK!\n\n3.01: A soldier is polishing what appears to be a Pompeii-style gladius, a weapon that was utilized only by the Romans, and not until around 400 years after Philip and Alexander. Imagine a film about Cortez fighting the Aztecs, and one of the conquistadors has a Heckler and Koch G36. That is how out of place it is. DRINK!\n\n3.15. A soldier is lacing up a sandal. It is actually a Roman caligae, which, funnily enough, was used by the Romans in the Republican period not the Macedonians in the 4th century BC. DRINK! \n\n3.19: Soldiers are using a generic dory spear instead of a sarissa pike. This is obvious by the fact that it is about twice as short as a sarissa, it has a sauroter at the end rather than a counter-balance and it is being HELD COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY WRONG! A sarissa is held more towards the middle as in this image: http://s1060.photobucket.com/user/Lauty10/media/AAB-5.jpg.html. DRINK! \n\n4.15: The narrator says that, like the Greeks, Philip armed his soldier with pikes. The only reference to longer spears is a passing mention of Iphikrates issuing new weapons to his troops, according to Diodoris Siculus. This reform does not appear to have caught on, and Greek states still used conventionally armed hoplites. Philip's adoption of the sarissa appears to be a radical innovation based on available evidence. DRINK!\n\n5.10: Anatolia is labelled as Persia on the map. The Greeks recognized that Anatolia was a separate region to Persia, although still part of the Achaemenid Empire and still in Asia. Herodotus made a distinction between Lydia in Anatolia, ruled by Croesus, the Ionian Greeks of coastal Anatolia and Median/Persian Empire. They were not all lumped together. DRINK!\n\n6.19: Armoured troops using slings. DRINK!\n\n6.34: Armoured troops are throwing the dory. If they were hoplites, they would not be throwing the dory as it was their primary hand-to-hand weapon. DRINK!\n\n7.34: Narrator states use of heavy cavalry was a revolution in warfare. Heavy cavalry had been in use amongst the Scythians and Persians at this time. There was nothing new about it. DRINK!\n\n8.04: Narrator called dory 'short spears'. At more than two meters in length (or more), there was nothing short about them. DRINK!  \n\n8.10: \"Thrust at Philip's men\". Hehehehehehehe. \n\n8.22: Narrator states that Philips troops had an advantage: the sarissa, which could be up to 20 feet long. Meanwhile, the Macedonians are still holding dory. DRINK!\n\n9.23: \"Could not be penetrated\". Hehehehehehehe.\n\n9.29: Scabbards used by troops are obviously Roman in nature, given the circular ornamentation at the end. DRINK!\n\n9.33: Narrator says it was the job of the Phalanx to punch a hole in the enemy line. Although the exact role of the Macedonian phalanx is still debated (Stephen English believes it was used offensively and to create disorder), most academics believe it was the anvil to the hammer. The phalanx would tie down the front-line and Alexander and Philip would manoeuvre with cavalry until a gap in the line was exposed. This was how Alexander won at a Gaugamela, he managed to draw the Persian flank away so he could double back and charge at Darius. DRINK!\n\n10.00: Graphics suck, I can see the pixels.\n\n11.15. Macedonian phalangite is using a spear one handed in the over-arm position while holding his shield as a hoplite would, not strapped to his arm and using the spear with a double grip like a pike. DRINK!\n\n11.23 \"Thrusting at the Greeks with their sarissai, Coenus and his comrades pushed and heaved in a great shoving match\". The writers are doing this on purpose now.\n\n13.09: Still a better fight scene than that episode of Game of Thrones set in Dorne.\n\n13.55: Glossed over the nature of the Theban Band and how they were composed of men in a romantic relationship with their male partners. Surprising given the innuendo so far. Not an error, but I thought it was some good trivia to mention.\n\n20.35: Yet another gladius polishing. DRINK!\n\n23.21: Narrator says of Coenus \"He, like Alexander, died\". It makes it sound as though Coenus departed not long after Alexander. In actuality he died six years before. DRINK!\n\nWell, that was it. Entertaining but highly flawed. And let us just say I was grateful not to be actually consuming any alcohol.\n\nSources:\n\nThe Army of Alexander the Great, by Stephen English.\n\nBy the Spear: Philip II, Alexander the Great, and the Rise and Fall of the Macedonian Empire, by Ian Worthington.\n\nShadows in the Desert: Ancient Persia at War, by Kaveh Farrokh\n\nRome and the Sword: How Warriors and Weapons Shaped Roman History, by Simon James.\n\nThe Complete Roman Army, by Adrian Goldsworthy.\n",

        "text": "I've already brought up this comment thread, but there was another comment in there [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/3gdfti/the_man_who_saved_kyoto_from_the_atomic_bomb_just/ctypisb) which echoes a sentiment I've found in a lot of places. To put in OP's words:\n\n&gt; Gandhi was racist, was a bigot, and was a paedo.\n\nIt's essentially saying that Gandhi shouldn't be taken seriously - or at least re-evaluated - because of his beliefs and religious practices. It's presentism and character assassination of the highest magnitude. It's not even all that intelligent, honestly.\n\nBut let's look at it, one claim at a time (though I'll skip the claim about bigotry because I see it as being part and parcel with the claim about racism - feel free to disagree, but looking at how the argument is framed in other places, that basically seems to be how it works). Was Gandhi racist? Can we dismiss Ganhi as a racist? After all, he said some pretty damning things like: \n\n&gt; Ours is one continual struggle against a degradation sought to be inflicted upon us by the Europeans, who desire to degrade us to the level of the raw Kaffir whose occupation is hunting, and whose sole ambition is to collect a certain number of cattle to buy a wife with and, then, pass his life in indolence and nakedness.\n\nClearly, Gandhi is no different than those fellows in the white hoods or the perpetrators of Apartheid and we should dismiss his achievements because of it. \n\nThe trouble is, though, that Gandhi was writing that in 1896, a time when much of the world was writing the same exact thing. We can't possibly expect Gandhi to be beholden to today's social norms regarding race, much as we don't hold other people accountable for their racist or sexist views. We recognise that these views are despicable if held by someone in modern society, but we also realise that societies and societal norms are changing, evolving things that don't hold the same beliefs. Gandhi can't be held accountable to today's standards for believing in the beliefs that the society he lived in held. Now, if he were decidedly more racist than your average early 20th century fellow fighting to make sure his people had basic civil rights, then we could talk, but he wasn't. \n\nThe interesting thing about Gandhi, though, was that his views did evolve and change. What he saw and experienced in South Africa changed his views on racial supremacy, particularly in Africa. By 1906, he wrote about the Bambatha Rebellion, saying:\n\n&gt; The Zulu 'rebellion' was full of new experiences and gave me much food for thought. The Boer War had not brought home to me the horrors of war with anything like the vividness that the 'rebellion' did. This was no war but a man-hunt. To hear every morning reports of the soldiers' rifles exploding like crackers in innocent Hamlets, and to live in the midst of them was a trial. But I swallowed the bitter draught, especially as the work of my Corps consisted only in nursing the wounded Zulus. I could see that but for us the Zulus would have been uncared for. This work, therefore, eased my conscience. \n\nWorking in and among Africans humanised them for him, and made it so that his ideas of them changed. Much like any other human being, Gandhi grew and learned from his experiences. Would it have been great from the outset if he'd known that Africans were equal people? Sure, but in the early 20th century, I'm not going to fault him for being racist and then changing.\n\nIt's the accusations of paedophilia that I find more interesting, though, because they're not necessarily grounded in presentism (at least not to the same degree), but rather judging an action based strictly on how it looks. The accusations are centred around a practice Gandhi began sometime after 1944 of sleeping naked with naked young women. The practice was called *brahmacharya*, and while it was controversial even at the time, it was a far cry from paedophilia. \n\n*Brahmacharya* more generally doesn't always have the interpretation that Gandhi gave it in his later years. Broadly speaking, it's the search for truth and inner strength as well as self-control, and can be done in a number of ways. Gandhi, however, chose to practice celibacy starting in 1906, and chose to test that celibacy with more and more difficult tests, ultimately culminating in sleeping nude with women after the death of his wife in 1944. What's important, though, is that even beyond the lack of sex, the act itself was not a sexual one. His physician, Sushila Nayyar, for instance, described the experience as not unlike sleeping with her mother, and Gandhi's grandniece, Manu (who was 18 when she began participating in this practice), stated repeatedly that there were no sexual advances, and that most times, she popped right off to sleep. Most importantly, though, was the fact that there was no intent for there to be anything sexual - the entire practice was part of Gandhi's own religious experience and development of faith.\n\nAs I said earlier, though, Gandhi's practices were not without detractors. His stenographer, for instance, made it abundantly clear that he thought Gandhi should uphold higher moral standards, and left Gandhi. Throughout 1947, he writes about friends and relatives questioning him and whispering about his activities. Even at the time, his actions were seen as sketchy and not quite ordinary. More specifically, they seemed fundamentally at odds with his political persona and his teaching of ahimsa and practice of celibacy. It was seen as a blemish on his character that he did this. \n\nWhat I think matters, though, is that the documentation shows that this was never a sexual affair, at least no more so than celibacy itself is a sexual affair. Equally, even if it was sexual, the fact that the women involved were all legal adults absolves Gandhi of any accusations of paedophilia. Ultimately, though, I think it does need to be said that even if every word were true, that still doesn't change the good Gandhi did and the effect he had on the world. It also doesn't change the power of his ideas.\n\nSources!\n\n\"Nakedness, Nonviolence, and Brahmacharya: Gandhi's Experiments in Celibate Sexuality\" by Vinay Lal published in Journal of the History of Sexuality, which also talks about people grappled with this issue in discussing Gandhi's legacy.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3igu17/on_the_concept_of_soviet_barrier_troops_as/",
        "text": "Barrier Troops, or Blocking Detachments (*Otryadi Zagrazhdeniye*/*отряды заграждения*) were certainly a *thing* during the Second World War, but while watching a film like “*Enemy at the Gates*” might make you think that most Soviet formations needed a literal gun in the back in order to do battle, the famous opening scene is, despite drawing bits and pieces of truth from various occurrences, neither showing what actually happened, not representative of the average engagement, insofar as we can say that there is an “average”. \n\nSo, in addressing the issue of barrier troops, I feel that there are three levels to the question, each of which I will try to answer:\n\n* Did they exist? (Yes)\n\n* What did they do, and did that actually include machine-gunning anyone trying to retreat? (Stop desertion, but exceptionally rarely)\n\n* Is “*Enemy at the Gates”*, specifically, an accurate portrayal of them, and the supply situation of the Red Army? (No)\n\nOK, so for starters, yes, barrier troops were very much a thing, and existed in some capacity or another for the duration of the war, and have their roots in the decades earlier with Tsarist and Civil War era fighting^1 .\n\nDuring World War II, the NKVD (Security Service) operated barrier troops from very early on, and while the Red Army also made use beforehand on a localized and ad hoc basis ^2 , their establishment is most associated with [Order 227](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Order_No._227_by_the_People%27s_Commissar_of_Defence_of_the_USSR), issued on July 28th, which aside from establishing a large system of penal units where a disgraced soldier could atone for desertion or cowardice, also directed for the formation of “3 to 5 well-armed defensive squads” within each Army (previously they had existed no higher than the Division level) who were directed to “shoot in place panic-mongers and cowards” in the case of panic or withdrawal^3 .\n\nWhich brings us to the second part of this question. Did they actually machine gun men for attempting to simply fall back? Yes, their directive certainly gave them that option in no uncertain terms, but actually resorting to it was not the norm. We have accounts of troops being sent into battle in just that manner, but rather than being regular Red Army units, they generally make reference to either the penal battalions set up under Order 227, or the \"Peoples' Volunteer Corps\"/*\"Narodnoe Opolcheniye\"* (civilian levies), barely trained non-soldiers pressed into service for last ditch delaying efforts, who in some cases lacked even enough rifles to go around and instead were armed with only grenades or Molotov cocktails^4 . Sabres, daggers, or pikes were all that armed some of the workers battalions further in the city that would have seen action had the Germans broken through^5 . Army units also had shortages, but not nearly as dire^6 .\n\nAll in all, some 135,000 Leningraders from the factories and universities who volunteered (a very loose use of the word for many of them) were sent into battle in just that sort of situation, where they suffered heavy losses, with little reason^7 , and many threw down what rifles had been available to them^8 . Similarly, in Stalingrad almost exactly a year later, civilians ‘volunteered’ by the NKVD, drawn mostly from the Barrikady Ordnance Factory, the Red October Steel Works and the Dzerzhinsky Tractor Factory workers, were thrown against the Germans in delaying actions as well, underarmed and even with *Komsomol* members armed with machine guns emplaced behind them^9 . But this was by far the exception.\n\nIn many cases, the barrier troops were barely functional in any capacity, as they were often the bottom of the barrel, since, to quote from Catherine Merridale’s “*Ivan’s War”*:\n\n&gt;Few officers were keen to spare their best men for service in the blocking units. They had been in the field too long; they knew the value of a man who handled weapons well. So the new formations were stuffed with individuals who could not fight, including invalids, the simple-minded and – of course – officers’ special friends. Instead of aiming rifles at men’s backs, these people’s duties soon included valeting staff uniforms or cleaning the latrines^10 .\n\nEspecially if a commander was not going to resort to the exceptionally harsh measure - even by Soviet standards - of taking Order 227 to the extreme, it made little sense to waste the best troops in the role. Contrary to the popular image, commanders knew that their manpower was not endless, and by mid-1942, were unwilling to resort to use such lethal methods^11 . In cases where commanders did stock the barrier force with his best troops, their positioning to the rear was often utilized in the form of a mobile reserve^12 .\n\nAll in all, the most likely way that a soldier or officer would interact with a barrier troop was not through being cut down by a Maxim, but through arrest and drumhead court martial. Especially in the case of the NKVD detachments, they wouldn’t be set up right at the line of battle, but some ways to the rear^13 , where they would apprehend retreaters, run a quick show “trial”, execute a few to make an example, and sentence considerably more to serve time in a penal unit. One representative example, of an encounter in mid-1942, recalls:\n\n&gt;I came to know about it [Order 227] at the village of Vesely outside of Rostov.\n\n&gt;Our retreat was barred by a special purpose detachment [of the NKVD]. A few hundred officers of retreating units were driven to a large farm. They were escorted one at a time, into a house. Three men sat at a table. They asked us about our rank and where our personnel were. The answers were generally stereotyped:\n\n&gt;“What’s the use of asking it if everybody is fleeing. The Germans have broken through the front. What could have possibly a platoon leader or a company commander done in that situation?”\n\n&gt;The trial was short. The sentence was passed then and there. The accused were led behind a pigsty and shot.\n\n&gt;When my turn came, Marshal of the Soviet Union Semion Budenny suddenly appeared in the village. The execution was suspended. We were lined up. Budenny asked us “Who wants to fight?” Everybody made a step forward^14 .\n\nIn one 24-hour period during the fighting in Stalingrad, the barrier troops behind 62nd and 64th Armies made 659 detentions, but of those only 8 were shot, and 24 arrests^15 , which while certainly unfortunate for those being punished, is not indicative of the callous slaughter of any soldier foolish enough to make a tactical withdrawal. In August and September, the period of perhaps the most precarious fighting for the Soviets, of the 45,465 detentions, 41,472 were simply returned to their units, and only 664 were shot for their cowardice, with the rest arrested for imprisonment or penal combat (In comparison to the period from October to January, which saw only 203 arrests, and 163 shot), generally in view of their division to drive home the point^16 . Mostly, those who suffered were not from the lowest ranks. The simple fact is that Order 227, and the use of barrier troops in general, simply was not primarily intended for that at all. While leaving the door open for use when needed, the main target was within the officer and commissar cadres, to encourage them to prevent, let alone to not allow, unauthorized retreats by their men^17 . To quote Stalin upon his issuance of Order 227, establishing the penal units and blocking detachments, as regards his desire to quell retreat:\n\n&gt;[W]e can no longer tolerate commanders, commissars, and political workers whose units and formations willfully abandon their positions [...]. [C]ompany, battalion, regimental, and division commanders and associated commissars and political workers who retreat from their combat positions without orders from higher commands are enemies of the Homeland^18 .\n\nThat isn’t to say that “mass prevention” wasn’t needed at times, but, in the instances where, to stem wholesale flight and prevent its spread machine guns were employed, blocking units were as likely to shoot over the heads of the troops as they were to shoot at them^19 . And when it came to executions, they were rather rare, with, overall, less than one percent of detainees during Stalingrad, facing execution^20 .\n\nWithin only a few months of the expansion of the blocking detachments under Order 227, the Red Army realized that such a scale of implementation was not worth the cost, and Oct. 29, 1942, saw their role significantly curtailed - they would not be actually abolished until late 1944^21 , but this had no effect on the NVKD units which continued in their role as backstops^22 , nor did some Red Army commanders cease using the formations on an ad hoc basis. Whether or not the blocking units had played a part in it, inspectors did see a considerable improvement in the morale and resolve of the forces by that August ‘42^23 , as also demonstrated by the declining numbers picked up by the NKVD as mentioned earlier. \n\nAll of this isn’t to say that it didn’t happen *at all*, but only that those limited instances paled in comparison not only to overall casualties, but also when compared to the fate of the vast majority of soldiery who ended up on the wrong end of Soviet discipline, and thus that the extent of blatant machine-gunning imagined by many ought to be considered essentially mythic^24 . Even excluding the reduction in role of the Red Army’s blocking units after 1942, by far, the most likely outcome of punishment under Order 227 would be placement within the previously mentioned penal unit, or the gulags, as opposed to execution, let alone a Maxim to the back. Although numbers are incredibly hard to be certain of, Overy cites 442,000 men sentenced to penal units, and 436,000 imprisoned. Through the entire war, 158,000 were sentenced to execution as according to Krivosheev^25 , some 13,000 or so alone during Stalingrad^26 .\n\nThe penal units - *shtrafbats* battalions made up of disgraced officers and commissars and commanded at the *front* level, and *shtrafroty* companies made up of NCOs and common soldiers and commanded at the army level - were used for the most suicidal of missions, and while in practice could mean a virtual death sentence for a soldier placed within one, they nevertheless offered the chance at redemption, ‘purging their crimes with blood’^27 . While such penal units had existed prior to the war, and were used from the start, there was little top level direction or organization to the formation of these units, and it was not until Order 227 that they were systematized within the Red Army^28 , in part inspired by their use by the Germans^29 .\n\nAs per Order 227, the penal units were supposed to be placed at the most active and dangerous sectors, and *always* to operate with blocking detachments to their rear to ensure that they did not falter, as well as with blanket permission for a commander to execute one of his men to prevent desertion^30 , but these proximate threats wasn’t always needed. While the chances of being killed were quite great - one lucky survivor recalled 6 men from his company of 198 making it^31 - it was nevertheless a preferable fate to many who otherwise would have faced certain execution. Assuming survival, someone thus sentenced could be restored to good standing, and even if killed, dying at the front instead of in the gulag or against a wall at least cleared a soldier’s record, allowing their family to collect their pension as due any other fallen soldier^32 . This was an improvement, however slight, on the situation under Order 270 from 1941, which not only offered little alternative to a death sentence but also punished the families of the “traitors”^33 .\n\nThus, there was an amount of incentive for soldiers serving to do well, and in the case of the *shtrafbat*, made up of officers, some even took a ‘perverse pride’ in their role, since they were under direction of the *front* level command, and generally used for missions with the greatest risk-reward^34 . Especially later in the war, this became more true, as the strength of the penal units increased with augmentation to include better anti-tank capabilities and reconnaissance platoons^35 . While their casualties remained appallingly high - in 1944, for instance, averaging 52 percent losses per month, 3x to 6x higher than the Red Army overall in the same period^36 - and their roles still the most dangerous - including the clearing of minefields under fire, or taking the vanguard of the assault - it did at least see improvement in their ability to perform.\n\nSo, to recap at this point, barrier troops were an integral part of the Red Army, used throughout the war to maintain discipline and, when warranted, mete out punishment. However, this should not be taken to imply that the popular image of the Red Army soldier driven to fight with a gun to his back is representative of what actually happened. While it certainly happened, this was the most extreme of situations. The most common utilization was as a backstop for the aforementioned penal units, where the need for such heavy handed management was seen as warranted. Additionally, they proved to be relatively common with the citizen levies raised early in the war, and thrown against the Germans as a separate delaying measure. Untrained, ill-armed, and often volunteers in only the most bureaucratic of senses, the cruel prodding of machine gun to their rear was often seen as necessary to ensure they went forward. Outside of this though, while the Red Army - and NKVD - placed the blocking detachments to the rear regularly, shooting retreaters was a last resort, and its use saw only a brief heyday in the middle of 1942. The standard operating procedure was to corral the panicking units, arrest officers and some troops, and execute or sentence to a penal unit where warranted. \n\nSo now to the last point. If [*Enemy at*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yOBCGwMpeo) [*the Gates*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgRyLz47liM) is the quintessential portrayal of the blocking detachments, well, how is that scene specifically? Simply put… not very good, and it bears little resemblance to any scene mentioned in the book that could vaguely be considered the source material^37 , although it is not much less accurate than [the “rebuttal” scene from the Russian *Stalingrad*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0KttKFrhqE), which at least gets points for putting the scene at night^38 .\n\nAs previously noted, for starters, the extreme situation portrayed was generally applied to penal units and civilian levies. While shortages of rifles did occur, this again was a problem that plagued the levies the worst, as they were raised so quickly on an ad hoc basis. Instances of regular Red Army soldiers finding themselves without enough arms to go around are documented, but most commonly in the earliest days of the war when confusion reigned and logistics had broken down. The defenders of the Brest Fortress for example, where some of the sections had less than half the necessary rifles to arm the men present^39 , and the problem was a common one throughout the front in June-July, 1941^40 . In “*Enemy at the Gates*”, the closest reference to such a shortage is a *Guards* division short 2,000 rifles, which Chuikov “arranged to fill this need from army reserves.”^41\n\nAll in all, the most likely source of inspiration for the charge that opens the film is from the experience of the *Narodnoe Opolcheniye* as previously mentioned, and their actions in late August through early September, which is one of the few documented instances that bear a marked resemblance, including the lack of enough rifles, the armed blocking detachments to the immediate rear, and the total lack of combat experience for most of the participants. It certainly has little in common with the actual experience of the 284th Division, which included the sniper Hero of the Soviet Union Vassili Zaitsev. Daylight crossings, as shown in film, were considered to be quite suicidal, and as such, they were conducted at night, and while still often subjected to grueling German artillery, it at least offered slight improvement^42 .\n\nAccording to Zaitsev - a long time soldier who had been in the Soviet Navy since 1937, who had risen to Chief Petty Officer, before he was transferred to the 284th Rifle Division^43 - he and his fellow soldiers spent several days training on the far side of the Volga to prepare for the vicious close-quarters fighting of the Stalingrad battlefield^44 . When it came time to cross over on the night of Sept. 22nd, their crossing was uncontested, and although not the norm, no shells were fired on them and it was made without casualties^45 . The first attack by his unit, conducted with artillery support, was a success that pushed back the Germans from their positions^46 .\n\nSo, what are we to make of this all then? In simplest terms, at best \"*Enemy at the Gates*\" can be said to be portraying some sort of 'ur-charge', taking bits and pieces of truth and synthesizing it into one apocalyptic scene that shows just about every sin of the Red Army in one fell swoop. It makes for entertaining cinema, but rather poor history, especially when people take it to be representative of the norm as opposed to the exceptional. If we aren't being charitable though, well, it is quite wrong, spreading that image into the popular mindset, and while the discipline of the Red Army was undeniably harsh and the experience of the common *Ivan* one wracked by hardship, it is nevertheless a disservice to their memories and motivations^47 . \n\n[**Notes and Works Cited**](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3igu17/on_the_concept_of_soviet_barrier_troops_as/cug8v1u)",

        "text": "Alright, so as background here, I'm sure we've all seen Curt Schilling's latest Tweet, but in case not, here ya go: http://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2015/8/25/9206495/curt-schilling-tweets-deletes-awful-meme-comparing-muslims-to-nazis\n\nThat's not what this post is about, however. Well not directly. It's more about an ensuing conversation I had on Facebook in which someone defended Schilling's infographic by pointing out that it couldn't possibly be racist because it was a \"legitimate statistic.\" This gentleman went on to point out that 8 million out of 80 million Germans were Nazis, so the infographic's point holds up.\n\nThis isn't bad history because the statistic is wrong per se, since yeah, only 10-ish percent of Germans at the time had party membership. It's bad history because it implies that statistic *means* anything. For instance, in 1940s Germany, children weren't members in *any* political party, so their inclusion in Germany's population for this statistic isn't very helpful. Including them in this statistic dilutes the percentage you get through simple division, making it seem like fewer people supported the Nazis than actually may have. Additionally, less than 20% of the Nazi Party was comprised of women, so what about women outside the party who supported the Nazis via more \"traditional\" roles such as the formation of grassroots organizations and instilling of Nazi values in children (see Claudia Koonz' *Mothers in the Fatherland*)?\n\nThat problem brings us to our next problem. Even if \"only 10%\" of Germans held party membership, does that automatically mean that the remainder didn't support Nazi policies? Clearly many Germans supported Nazism outside of the party, a problem this statistic doesn't really address at all.\n\nGiven how useless this statistic is, we have to rely on historical sources. Given that I'm duty bound to supply them in this sub, I'm going to throw out the name Klaus Fischer who has written an entire tome on how Hitler came to power (*Nazi Germany: a New History*) which makes it pretty clear that there were more people involved here than the mere 10% of German citizens who were in the party by addressing Nazi women's groups, the HJ, and party rallies populated by many working class citizens who didn't necessarily have party membership. This book pretty much addresses every facet of Nazism you can think of and, by doing so, makes it pretty clear that a LOT of ordinary Germans were involved in getting Hitler into power whether they were actual party members or not.\n\nI brought all this up because of course I did, and the response was something like \"well that's not measurable so it's not meaningful.\" It's hard to argue with this sort of thing because there's not much you can do when someone fails to recognize that not everything meaningful is also 100% measurable but it's a great example of how bad history can come out of statistics without the proper historical training. They're a useful tool for any historian, but they only have meaning if you use them properly, and not to, you know, defend a pro baseball player who is also a racist.\n\n\n**EDIT:** I've been informed by those more well versed than I in this particular subject, that women were, in fact, involved in the Nazi Party as members. I have altered my line of argumentation accordingly to be more in line with the facts as they have been presented to me.\n\n**EDIT:** Removed sarcastic references to STEM because a lot of people found them offensive. I address this in the comments below; no offense was intended.",

Beyond that, though, there are two claims that are just wrong, namely that Augustus abolished slavery, and that Augustus invented Jesus. The question of Jesus' existence has been done to death, and frankly, I have no interest whatsoever in doing it again (though that the fact that [this](http://i.imgur.com/PMvoIlL.png) is the user's reaction to being told the evidence of Jesus' existence amuses me) but I don't think anyone's touched on Augustus' abolition of slavery before, so I'll have a go.\n\nIt didn't happen. \n\n...Cool! That was easy!\n\nIn all seriousness, it didn't happen. Slavery as an institution persisted throughout the Roman Empire, even as sources of slaves dried up. Within Italy itself during the first century CE, slaves made up almost half the population, and were made up of people from within Europe (mostly Greeks), people from outside Europe, and people from within the Empire who had becomes victims of debt slavery. Death rates were extremely high, but equally, being freed was fairly commonplace, with it becoming such a problem that Augustus restricted them, both by saying that no more than a hundred slaves could be freed in a will, and by saying that slaves had to be at least 30 before they could be freed. \n\nAnd speaking of Augustus, rather than freeing slaves, as the above implies, slavery increased under his rule, with slaves being increasingly imported from across a growing empire. He also instituted a sales tax on the sale of slaves, growing the empire's wealth considerably. I suppose that might be considered \"abolishing the slave trade\" if by \"slave trade\" you mean \"people's untaxed investment in the slave trade\" and by \"abolished,\" you mean \"put a slight dent in.\" So not at all. \n\nSources!\n\nI read a book once. Or maybe it was an article. Could have also been the back of a cereal box. Whatever it was, I learned enough to know that *Augustus didn't abolish slavery.* \n\nAlso, Josephus as one of Augustus' goons makes me laugh. My laughter is a source of knowledge.",

        "text": "Ah, the Battle of Little Bighorn. Who can forget the gallant charge of the 7th Cavalry, the mighty Native American warriors, Custer's last stand? Well, [this person, apparently](https://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/3b29ge/139_years_ago_today_general_custer_was_defeated/csibqmv) whose telling of the story is a bit...different from actual history. What's the difference, you might ask? Well, let's have a look.\n\nLet's start by looking at the context in which the Battle of Little Bighorn took place. In 1876, a large number of Native American groups were being forced on to reservations, something which they by and large did not want to do. Throughout the mid-19th century, the US military clashed with Native American groups throughout the west, including getting embroiled in the Sioux Wars. While some efforts met with success and some groups were herded into reservations, many were not. \n\nBy the spring of 1876, tensions were understandably high. For many Americans, the arrival of the centennial meant looking at what had been accomplished thusfar, and where the country stood. What stood out, though, was that the \"Indian problem\" had not been solved, placing greater pressure on authorities to have the remaining Native Americans put into reservations. They became perhaps a bit rasher than they might have otherwise been, fueled on by the necessity of putting Native Americans on reservations, as well as by nationalistic sentiments.\n\nFor Native Americans, however, there were different problems. Food on the reservations had been scarce the previous winter, meaning that when chiefs such as Sitting Bull collected people to attend the year's Sun Dance, more people than anticipated flooded out of the reservation and on to Rosebud Creek, Montana for the festival. The US military, understandably spooked by the large numbers of Native Americans gathering outside reservations, tried to drive the Native Americans back to the reservation. However, the Battle of the Rosebud was a resounding failure for American troops as they were driven back by a Native American force much larger than what they anticipated. The initial attackers fell back to wait for reinforcements. \n\nThe 1876 Sun Dance took place on sacred land, yes, but it must be emphasised that it was supposed to. There was no intention to settle there permanently. While I don't know whether or not Sitting Bull intended to return to the reservation, certainly many of his compatriots did not, having decided that living on a reservation was miserable. Equally, reservation Native Americans were not the only ones to attend the Sun Dance. Groups from around the area attended, which is partly why the numbers swelled.\n\nWhat's interesting as well is what propelled the Native American groups to stand and fight. During the Sun Dance, Sitting Bull claimed to have a vision in which he saw American troops falling out of the sky like grasshoppers on grass. Interpreting this as a clear sign of victory, warriors were more motivated to fight and die for what they perceived as an entirely noble cause. Indeed, when put in the context of previous massacres and the loss of their land and way of life, the decision to stand and fight is completely understandable. Certainly they would have interpreted it as such. \n\nSo what about the claim that other Native American groups fought alongside Custer? There's a little bit of truth to it, but as always, that little bit of truth is being blown out of proportion. Several Native American scouts worked with Custer's troops, leading him to the village and telling him it would be stupid to attack it. Custer's plan for the battle also involved him using the women and children in the village as human shields, which I suppose could be interpreted as \"Native allies\" if you're feeling particularly mercenary, but I'm not. The forces involved on the attack on Little Bighorn were American.\n\nBut what must be emphasised is the motivation. The motivation - and perhaps the reason for the attack's failure, though I freely admit I'm not an expert on Little Bighorn - was to round up the Native Americans and send them back to reservations. This meant that Custer's primary concern had to be with the Native Americans scattering, and how to prevent that. He wasn't interested in whose sacred land it was, but simply that it was American land that they weren't supposed to be on.\n\nThere are times and places in which we should talk about the contributions of Native Americans to famous battles. However, adding them where they weren't, or changing motivations isn't the way to go about it. Little Bighorn was about Americans trying to put Native Americans on reservations, and the Native Americans fighting back.\n\nSources!\n\n\"Cultural Politics or Critical Public History?: Battling on the Little Bighorn\" by Debra Bucholtz in Journal of Tourism and Cultural Change\n\n\"Public Choice at the Little Bighorn\" by James E.

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3i6bm2/in_which_monogamy_was_invented_by_victorian_bible/",
        "text": "In [This thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskScienceDiscussion/comments/3i4k4l/sociologist_assume_there_was_no_religion_ever/) we have the following claims being made:\n\n&gt;Christianity is based on Polygamy. It was revised to monogamy in the Victorian age translations of the bible, so monogamy is an after-market modification. Look up \"biblical marriage\" but scroll past the US fundimentalist version to what the actual source materials say.\n\nNow I'll freely admit that a great many passages in the Bible indicate that polygamy was present among Jews, as it was throughout much of the surrounding region.  Issac and Jacob both had multiple wives, and Solomon is recorded as having 300 wives (and 700 porcupines, if I remember Bible school right).  But the only verse regarding polygamy among _Christians_ that I have heard of are 1 Timothy 3:2 (KJV)\n&gt;A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;\n\nand 3:12\n\n&gt;Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.\n\nNow you could argue that this means ordinary run-of-the-mill Christians could be polygamous, and you'd probably have a point.  But that's clearly not how it was seen throughout most of Christian history, at least in Europe (I'm not familiar with the other offshoots).  Running with these verses plus the \"**two** shall become one flesh\" bits in Genesis, and I'm sure plenty more esoteric theology which  I am not aware of, polygamy has been verboten throughout much of Christian history long predating the Victorians.  Most famously, Henry 8 not only couldn't marry another wife, he couldn't even get a divorce without breaking from the Catholic Church! The Byzantine Emperors were all monogamous, with the possible exception of Valentinian 1.  Granted they had plenty of mistresses, but they _were_ mistresses because the rules didn't allow multiple wives.  I won't say there were never exceptions, but to claim that monogamy was a late addition to Christianity was clearly false.\n\nBut wait, there's more!   What are these so called \"Victorian-age translations\" of the Bible?  My personal impression is that churches seem to have skipped the Victorian age entirely, and were using the venerable old KJV until newer versions gained popularity in the latter half of the 20th century.  If we look at the top 5 bible translations from [a list](http://thomrainer.com/2014/12/top-ten-bible-translations-2014/) we have 1) NIV -1970's  2) The Voice - 2012 3) King James Version - 1611  4) English Standard Version - 1970's 5) New King James version - 1980's.  This confirms my impression.  There was a Revised Version of the KJV that came out in the 1880's, but it's not even on the list today, though it's descendant the American Standard Version is.\n\nAnyway, the point is that no Victorian translation of the Bible is particularly prevalent today, and our ideas about monogamy certainly weren't inserted then.  You can blame a lot on the Victorians, but not this.\n\nEDIT: Oh, there's also\n\n&gt;Polygamy is the traditional form. Monogamy is very recent in human history, like less than eight hundred years old.\n\nLegal monogamy goes back at least to Republican Rome, though the existence of concubines does show that monogamy wasn't strictly enforced.  But the _idea_ of monogamous arraignment is clearly more than 800 years old.  If he means the perfect _practice_ of it, I doubt that's been widespread in any society.\n\n",

        "text": "[Today's Skype conversation.](http://imgur.com/zqFWNIk)\n\nI am several months younger than /u/Quouar, which is of course an endless source of teasing, but today that changes. Today, I check the dates relevant to the longest-running joke about my age, the claim that I am a sweet summer child of the post-Soviet era, and I find this claim to be a pernicious lie. Observe, my quickly-thrown-together-and-probably-wrong-about-many-things-but-right-enough-to-make-my-point timeline of the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nPre-1991: Lots of exciting things that are absolutely relevant and would greatly improve the post if I had the knowledge and time to organize them into a coherent narrative.\n\nJanuary 1991: Amidst rioting in the Baltic republics (all of which have already declared their independence from the USSR, although the Soviet troops there are still disagreeing), Nikolai Ryzhkov resigns from his post as Chairman of the Council of Ministers, and is replaced by the first Prime Minister of the Soviet Union, Valentin Pavlov.\n\nFebruary 1991: /u/Quouar is born.\n\nMarch 1991: In a \"USSR-wide\" referendum, 76.4% of voters say that they support the continuation of the USSR, after reforms take place. The air quotes are there because the Baltic republics and several other Soviet republics boycott the referendum - the 76.4% figure is from the nine republics willing to participate.\n\nApril 1991: Georgia joins the Baltic republics (and Armenia, Abkhazia, and Transnistria) in unilaterally declaring its independence from the USSR.\n\nJune 1991: Boris Yeltsin is elected as the first President of Russia in a landslide victory over Ryshkov, the preferred candidate of Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, who has previously clashed with Yeltsin over the pace of reform.\n\nJuly 1991: Gorbachev publicly releases a draft of the New Union Treaty, his plan to prevent the complete collapse of the Soviet Union by restructuring it into a federation of mostly-autonomous republics. The treaty has already been approved by the nine not-rebelling republics by this point, and is scheduled to be signed in August.\n\nAugust 1991: Hardliners in the Communist Party launch a coup to prevent the signing of the New Union Treaty, placing Gorbachev under house arrest and attempting to arrest Yeltsin, rather unsuccessfully. The popular support the coup organizers were expecting to materialize behind them does so - behind Yeltsin. After two days, the coup collapses. Gorbachev returns to power, and dissolves the Communist Party, resigning his position as General Secretary in the process (but remaining Soviet President), and functionally shutting down Soviet government. In response, Ukraine declares its independence, followed in the next several weeks by most of the other republics.\n\nOctober 1991 - /u/Mirior is born. At this point, please note, Russia has yet to declare independence from the USSR; neither has Kazakhstan, South Ossetia, or the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria.\n\nDecember 1991 - Russia declares independence from the USSR. Gorbachev begins to consider resignation. Kazakhstan declares independence, the last republic to do so. The Alma-Ata Protocols are signed by all of the former republics except for Georgia; these protocols declare the dissolution of the USSR, and the formal acceptance of Gorbachev's resignation (which he has yet to submit). Gorbachev then resigns. The Soviet Council of Republics issues a formal declaration that the USSR has ceased to exist, then votes itself out of existence. Yeltsin sends a letter to the UN stating that Russia will be taking the USSR's seat on the Security Council; no-one objects.\n\nI think this totally-well-researched timeline makes it very clear that, while the fate of the Soviet Union was pretty clear by October 1991, the USSR did still exist at that point; as I said in today's Skype chat, I was almost two months old when it finally dissolved, and I have as much claim to living through the Cold War as /u/Quouar does. The defense rests.",

        "author": "Quouar",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3i50xz/resistance_to_the_atomic_bomb_and_how_it_existed/",
        "text": "Let's look at [this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/3gdfti/the_man_who_saved_kyoto_from_the_atomic_bomb_just/ctylryk) from /r/history. It's part of a long argument about whether there was any dissent to the use of atomic bombs prior to the 1960s, with the linked user claiming there was not. However, this is not the case. While dissent prior to the Cuban Missile Crisis may not have been widespread, its existence and how people who participated in it viewed the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were not just made up by later academics wanting to put a better face on the atomic bombings. The truth is a bit more nuanced than that.\n\nTo understand resistance to the atomic bomb, let's go back to 1945 and Truman's [announcement of the bombing of Hiroshima](http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/bomb/large/documents/index.php?documentdate=1945-08-06&amp;documentid=59&amp;pagenumber=1). The initial announcement, contrary to common belief, was not couched in justifications of military necessity, but rather in arguments about desert. Statements like \"obliterate more rapidly and completely every productive enterprise the\nJapanese have above ground\" made it clear that, for Truman, the objective of the atomic bomb was not necessarily to save lives, but to utterly decimate the Japanese and force them to surrender. However, by [his address to Congress](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=12327) on 3 October, 1945, the justification has shifted, with Truman saying \"We know that it saved the lives of untold thousands of American and Allied soldiers who would otherwise have been killed in battle.\" Within those months, it had become clear to Truman that there was a necessity in shifting the language surrounding the atomic bomb from one of desert to one of necessity. While this by no means constitutes a moral objection to the bomb, it does demonstrate that there was enough of an objection to reframe what had been done in a light that made the bombings more morally acceptable. \n\nWhat's interesting is how this shift came about. Immediately after the bomb was dropped, 85% of Americans [approved of it](http://www.gallup.com/poll/3427/most-important-events-century-from-viewpoint-people.aspx) and saw it just another weapon rather than something decisive and brutal. Congress reflected this approval, with most senators agreeing with the weapons' use. However, as more and more reports of radiation sickness and the effects it was having came to light, the public began to associate atomic weaponry with banned weapons like poison gas, which Roosevelt had soundly denounced as \"terrible and inhumane\" in 1943. Indeed, the Truman administration was so concerned about this shift in perception that by 1946, entire branches of the Pentagon were dedicated to improving the public image of the bomb. \n\nHowever, what ought to be noted here is that while there was not necessarily widespread protest against the bomb as there would be in later decades, there was a disapproval once people were actually aware of what it did. Likening something to poison gas is generally not a good thing, and the fact that this became such a massive concern demonstrates that this belief - and disapproval - were spreading, even as early as 1945. Indeed, if we want to see real moral resistance to the bomb, we need look no further than Truman himself. After he bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Truman put a stop to any further atomic bombings because [he couldn't deal with being responsible for another 100 000 people](http://www.doug-long.com/hst.htm). The idea of dropping more bombs utterly repulsed him specifically because of the effects of radiation sickness and the damage to innocent civilians. \n\nThe fact that one of the first acts of the newly formed United Nations, too, was to try and eliminate nuclear weapons is significant in that it demonstrates an international and governmental resistance to the bomb rather than just a resistance characterised by individuals. More importantly, while there were pragmatic concerns, the UN's pursuit of nuclear weaponry was also based in moral concerns, and came out of seeing the effects of radiation sickness and recognising what these weapons were capable of. Even by 1946, there was widespread, high-level resistance to atomic weaponry and its use. \n\nHowever, it wasn't until 1949 and the early 1950s that there were more substantial grassroots movements to end nuclear weapons. In October 1949, citizens in Hiroshima staged a large protest against atomic weaponry. In 1950, a petition started in Stockholm to ban nuclear weapons quickly gained large numbers of signatures from around the world. Following the first hydrogen bomb test in 1954, protests grew in number and strength as the potential power of the bomb became more and more known. These protests would involve trespassing on weapons development sites, sailing into testing zones, or sometimes civil disobedience. The true change, however, was in the polls, with Americans, by the mid-1950s, believing that the US should not strike first with nuclear weapons, a shift from previous years, and a reflection of the growing moral resistance to nuclear weapons. \n\nWhile it doesn't really address the bad history, I want to go on a little tangent about how this shift actually happened because I find it interesting, especially given that public opinion shifted before governmental opinion did. Figures like Albert Schweitzer played a key role in helping fuel that shift by providing information that made it clear that nuclear bombs weren't just bombs in the traditional sense, but rather that it was the \"nuclear\" aspect that mattered. He provided information on how the physics of it worked, but more importantly, what radiation sickness was and how insidious and harmful it could be. This, coupled with fears of a nuclear war with the USSR, emphasised to the public how dangerous nuclear weapons were. It wasn't a war that could be won in the draft - these, organisations like the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament emphasised, were weapons that could and would destroy the world if allowed to do so. There was a moral imperative to disarmament. As these arguments gained ground and publicity, the public's sentiments shifted. Equally, though, anti-nuclear groups encouraged their members to put pressure on their governments to justify their possession of nuclear weaponry. This had the dual effect of making governments aware of their citizens' thoughts, but also created an atmosphere where citizens of these countries felt like they were more a part of their government than ever. They were part of a global government, and were ultimately involved in their own fates. This, too, stirred on protest movements, especially going into the 1960s and after the Cuban Missile Crisis. \n\nWhat's also interesting is the government's response. Eisenhower's immediate response to the growing protests against nuclear weapons was not to say \"okie dokie, I guess I don't get bombs anymore,\" but rather to try and normalise the bomb, much as Truman's administration had tried to do previously. Through promotion of things like tactical nukes and demonstrations of Soviet weapon capabilities, the Eisenhower administration tried to demonstrate not only that there was rational control behind American atomic weaponry, but also that there was a necessity to having it in the first place. However, as you might have guessed, the moral argument against atomic weapons and the fear of nuclear war prevailed in people's minds, and the attempts to normalise nuclear weapons failed. \n\nWe can also see evidence of the resistance to atomic weaponry in the shift in science fiction films in the 1950s. While moral arguments were all well and good, popular films focused on the horrors of mutated creatures and people, and the desolation that nuclear weapons could cause. Films like \"It Came From Beneath The Sea\" and \"Them,\" while kind of laughable today, reflected a very real fear that people had about atomic energy and the effects of nuclear weaponry. Once again, it's not necessarily blatant resistance, but the films help demonstrate what the public sentiment was - nuclear weapons were dangerous, and not something that could be normalised.\n\nBut what I think also matters is the reaction of the scientists themselves. In 1946, the Federation of Atomic Scientists - which included scientists that had worked to develop the bomb, like Oppenheimer - published [\"One World or None\"](http://fas.org/oneworld/front.pdf), a pamphlet that basically laid out that atomic weaponry was dangerous and needed to be controlled. Rather than take the government's line that nuclear weapons could become a normal part of war, they instead made it clear that nuclear weaponry was dangerous and should not be normalised. It was a provocative, explosive piece, and one that illustrates that resistance to the atomic bomb existed at all levels.\n\nIn essence, then, there were strong voices against nuclear weapons before the 1960s, and much of how later protest movements viewed nuclear weaponry was shaped by the outcry that had arisen in the 1940s and 50s. Even the revising of the rationale behind the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was being reshaped within the context of this protest and resistance, and even as early as 1945. While it's easy enough to forget these protests amid the prevailing language of the necessity of the bomb for deterrence and images of tourists in Las Vegas watching mushroom clouds, it's important to remember that there was moral resistance to the bomb, and had been from the start.\n\nSources!\n\n\"Stigmatizing the Bomb: Origins of the Nuclear Taboo\" by Nina Tannenwald published in International Security is an absolutely fantastic piece that goes into how we got to where we are with regards to our relationship with the atomic bomb. I was only looking at pre-1960s, but she goes well into it, and I highly recommend the piece.\n\n\"The prisoners and the bomb\" by Laurens van der Post published in American Enterprise is more of a memoir, but still gives a good look at the perception of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki even a year later. It's also a fascinating read.\n\n\"Atomic warfare and the nuclear family: domestic resistance in Hollywood films about the A-bomb\" by Michael Pressler published in Film Criticism looks at the portrayal of bombs in film\n\nAnd while I didn't talk about it \"L. Ron Hubbard's alternative to the bomb shelter: scientology's emergence as a pseudo-science during the 1950s\" by Terra Manca is an excellent piece on how Scientology was able to capitalise on atomic fears to grow into what it is today. I highly recommend it.",

Historical records of it are superficial, since historians tend to display scant interest in stateless societies. Nonetheless, Murray Rothbard and other historians have identified instances of it\n\nTake a second to stop cringing.\n\nOkay, the article claims that \"anarchistic\" groups have appeared at least three times in American history:\n\n1. In Early Colonial Rhode Island\n\n2. Pennsylvania\n\n3. The American Western Frontier\n\nI'll focus on Rhode Island because I know little to nothing about Pennsylvania and the \"Western Frontier\" part is too low of fruit. \n\n&gt;The state of Rhode Island was founded on anarchic ideals by Roger Williams and a group endeavoring to flee from the oppression by the Puritans of Massachusetts Bay.\n\nHere we run into the first problem, I don't really know if he's speaking about Anarchism as an ideology or just anti-statism.\n\nThe former can't be true because Roger Williams settled Providence in 1636, more than one hundred years before Proudhon (the first person to define Anarchism as an ideology) was even born. Saying he or his settlement were inspired by anarchic ideals is like saying Vlad the Impaler was inspired by Nazi ideals. Something that shouldn't be said in the presence of your history professors, or out loud in general, but would make for a sick alt-history story.\n\nThe latter isn't really true because William's most radical statements fall in line with the sort of Republicanism that America would soon be founded on. So he wasn't exactly making Bismarck tremble. \n\n\n&gt;Subsequent political struggles in the area now known as Portsmouth led to more explicit anarchism in the person of Anne Hutchinson, who settled in Rhode Island in 1638 and **who would become the first explicit anarchist in North America.**\n\nOh, I guess I should have set my expectations lower. The author is actually claiming that the ideology of Anarchism existed in 17th century colonists.\n\nAs I sidenote, I found this on her wiki page:\n\n&gt;According to *historian* Murray Rothbard, she had been led by her conscience and by meditation on the Scripture and logic to the conclusion of individualist anarchism.\n\nSo euphoric. \n\n&gt;The struggles firmed Hutchinson's opposition to any kind of magistry government, and she passed her philosophies on to her sister, Catherine Scott, who in turn influenced the Baptist anarchists.\n\n~~\"Catherine\" links to a retired Jamaican athlete because I guess the author didn't know her name was spelled with a \"K\".~~ This might be wrong.\n\nAlso, I've never ever seen the name come up in works about Christian Anarchism. ~~Heck, her name doesn't even come up with a google search.~~\n\n&gt;Also in Rhode Island, Shawomet (later Warwick) was anarchistic for more than five years before becoming part of Providence Plantation.\n\nThough I may be wrong about this, I'm pretty sure that Colonial Governments were legally an extension of the Monarchy, making it hard to do define them as \"anarchistic\".\n\nAnd do you wanna guess who's the only citation on the entire article?\n\nMurray \"I fight the weirdest intellectual battles\" Rothbard.

For many people, the historic violence of the Aztecs is made manifest in the modern Mexican state. The violence and corruption of the government or cartels are not merely similar to the historic aztecs, but a literal continuation. Octavio Paz, recipient of the 1990 Nobel Prize in literature, has argued exactly this in his essay *The Labyrinth of Solitude*.^1 Indeed, similar \nideas continue to inform understandings of every latino country.^2 \n\nEven where misunderstandings don't come from current political narratives, they're often informed by a misunderstanding of historical contexts. The most highly upvoted post in the thread is this quote from Bernal Diaz's *Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España*.\n\n&gt;&gt; One certain spot in this township I never shall forget, situated near the temple.

They were the product of a set of social and political environments vastly different than today's. Even our best primary sources are far from comprehensive or accurate. Diaz is neither. There have been many different attempts^3 to convey the context of Diaz's writings to the modern reader, but none that can be understood by taking quotes out of context. It's this difficulty with interpreting primary sources of the conquest that schools often teach guided interpretive readings of primary sources to help students navigate their biases. As [/u/Ahhuatl](https://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/3hxcz8/ancient_aztec_skull_rack_discovered_in_temple/cublahl) and [/u/Mictlantecuhtli](https://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/3hxcz8/ancient_aztec_skull_rack_discovered_in_temple/cubrdpw) (both flaired users on [/r/Askhistorians](https://np.reddit.com/r/Askhistorians)) correctly note, Diaz's claims are not archaeologically substantiated. I will defer to [/u/Ahhuatl's](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2xacnu/why_did_mesoamericans_sacrifice_people_and_why/cozu528) previous post to explain the issues with the scale of sacrifice and death in precolumbian Mexico. \n\nPerhaps the most frustrating set of historical misunderstandings about the Aztecs are that many people don't understand that they didn't think like modern people do. Our thoughts, philosophies, and morals would be anachronistic to apply to people living in the 15th century.\n\n&gt; ...I understand the impulse to 'defend' the Aztecs, but the evidence is pretty much airtight that they were shockingly murderous people. --[/u/moxy801](https://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/3hxcz8/ancient_aztec_skull_rack_discovered_in_temple/cubm7f5)\n\n...\n\n&gt; Their sports were religious too, so its all very fuzzy. But i think killing for religion would be worse than for sport. The sanctimonious bullshit makes it worse in my opinion. --[/u/break_main](https://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/3hxcz8/ancient_aztec_skull_rack_discovered_in_temple/cubozkx)\n\n...\n\n&gt; Uh, the sacrifice was based on fetishizing blood (i.e, 'bloodlust') and part of the ritual involved eating the victims (among other things). --[/u/moxy801](https://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/3hxcz8/ancient_aztec_skull_rack_discovered_in_temple/cuc1jdj)\n\nAs always, there is an enormous number of excellent refutations of these ideas easily available online. Although the comments herein are showing their age slightly, [this](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/zhu71/what_were_aztec_sacrifices_actually_like/) thread contains an excellent basic description of Aztec ritual sacrifice and its religious role.\n\n&gt; For example, virginity was also unimportant whereas in other parts even to this day it is a life or death issue. --[/u/Kate_Uptons_Horse](https://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/3hxcz8/ancient_aztec_skull_rack_discovered_in_temple/cuby770)\n\nI can't personally ccomment on the situation in South/Central America, but the situation in parts of North America was decidedly different. Virginity was absolutely an important issue in North Mexico. Although it didn't have the same connotations it took in Western Europe, the inheritance of political power and land made issues of sex very socially important. Even our scarce corpus of remaining myths has many condemning early sex or unfaithfulness.\n\n&gt; Further there is s profound difference between the wars and genocide of Europe you are referring to with the slaughterfests of the Aztec. And just because Europe was/is also brutal in general, not every European was/is whereas almost every Aztec enjoyed the human sacrifice events with a passion. --[/u/Kate_Uptons_Horse](https://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/3hxcz8/ancient_aztec_skull_rack_discovered_in_temple/cuc5kcq)\n\nAttempting to justify European civility this way is disgusting. *Almost every* Aztec would have been rural farmers and had limited access to the grand sacrifices of Tenochtitlan and Texcoco. Regardless, public executions were common in Europe until the 20th century. We have [actual pictures](http://www.lidenkatten.se/bilder3/gil_we11.jpg) of public executions in France and the [US](http://www.executedtoday.com/images/Rainey_Bethea_hanging_big.jpg).  Even if one were to take this gross tack, it fails miserably. This is nothing more than a post-colonial justification of the conquest.\n\nThe conquest is a complicated thing to understand. The collision of two isolated civilizations in 1519 and the events that followed have led to centuries of fallout. But even though Mexico today was constructed in the ashes of precolumbian America, events can't be understood solely as a continuation of prior history. People today aren't merely acting out their ancestral roles in a modern world, but active participants in shaping it. Conversely, people today are not the same people as yesterday. Humans are a product of their environments and modern environments have only limited use in understanding the realities of historic peoples. \n\n^1 Paz, Octavio.

        "text": "I'm going to preface this straight-out by admitting my biases. I have a master's degree in human rights and international politics. I want to be a diplomat. I have written and published research about East Timor and the genocide there in the past. Suffice to say, I do have some personal opinions about Kissinger and his impact on international relations and the current state of international human rights law. I'm going to do my best to stay neutral, but you may see my biases shining through like a flashlight through Swiss cheese. Feel free to call me out on that - as usual, I love arguing. I'm also still not a lawyer.\n\nLet's talk about [this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/35pan9/serious_what_factors_really_led_to_historys/cr6s1zm?context=2) from /r/history discussing Kissinger and his actions as National Security Advisor and Secretary of State under Nixon and Ford. The commenter states that, rather than being thought of as a diplomat, Kissinger ought to be remembered as a war criminal. This isn't an uncommon view; indeed, Christopher Hitchens wrote [a large, influential essay and book] (http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Kissinger/CaseAgainst1_Hitchens.html) about it, though he was far from the first to do so. The case is essentially that Kissinger's actions, while working as a top advisor in the US government, broke the law on several occasions, most notably in Cambodia, Timor-Leste, and Chile, and that Kissinger is a war criminal because of this. However, labeling Kissinger as a \"war criminal\" isn't accurate. The things he did - however much people may disagree with them - were not war crimes. \n\nThere are three main instances that people point to when they talk about Kissinger as a war criminal - the Vietnam War (including both the peace process and the decision to bomb Cambodia), the genocide in Timor-Leste, and the coup against Allende in Chile. I personally know the most about Timor-Leste, so that's what I feel most comfortable talking about, but I'm going to go into all three. Before I do that, though, let's review the definition the  ICRC uses for war crimes which can be found [here](https://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_rul_rule156). There's a lot there - more than I'm going to list in this post - and a lot of it is based in customary law rather than actual written law, making it extra complicated. However, the ICRC does make a few nice little lists, which include:\n\n&gt; • wilful killing;\n• torture or inhuman treatment, including biological experiments; \n• wilfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health;\n• extensive destruction or appropriation of property, not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly;\n• compelling a prisoner of war or other protected person to serve in the forces of a hostile Power;\n• wilfully depriving a prisoner of war or other protected person of the rights of a fair and regular trial;\n• unlawful deportation or transfer; \n• unlawful confinement;\n• taking of hostages.\n• committing outrages upon personal dignity, in particular, humiliating or degrading treatment and desecration of the dead; \n• enforced sterilization;\n• compelling the nationals of the adverse party to take part in military operations against their own party;\n• killing or wounding a combatant who has surrendered or is otherwise hors de combat;\n• declaring that no quarter will be given;\n• making improper use of distinctive emblems indicating protected status, resulting in death or serious personal injury; \n• making improper use of the flag, the military insignia or uniform of the enemy resulting in death or serious personal injury; \n• killing or wounding an adversary by resort to perfidy;\n• making medical or religious personnel, medical units or medical transports the object of attack;\n• pillage or other taking of property contrary to international humanitarian law;\n• destroying property not required by military necessity.\n• making the civilian population or individual civilians, not taking a direct part in hostilities, the object of attack;\n• launching an attack in the knowledge that such attack will cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians or damage to civilian objects which would be clearly excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated;\n• making non-defended localities and demilitarized zones the object of attack;\n• subjecting persons who are in the power of an adverse party to physical mutilation or to medical or scientific experiments of any kind which are neither justified by the medical, dental or hospital treatment of the person concerned nor carried out in his or her interest, and which cause death to or seriously endanger the health of such person or persons;\n• the transfer by the occupying power of parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies or the deportation or transfer of all or parts of the population of the occupied territory within or outside this territory; \n• making buildings dedicated to religion, education, art, science or charitable purposes or historic monuments the object of attack, provided they are not military objectives.\n\nThere are a couple in particular that I feel are going to be relevant, including:\n\n&gt; destroying property not required by military necessity\n\n&gt; launching an attack in the knowledge that such attack will cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians or damage to civilian objects which would be clearly excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated;\n\n&gt; making the civilian population or individual civilians, not taking a direct part in hostilities, the object of attack;\n\nThese are the aspects that are most often brought up when looking at Kissinger, and the ones that I feel are the most compelling, so let's keep them in mind as we talk about Kissinger's involvement in the Vietnam War and its eventual expansion into Cambodia. \n\nIn 1969, while Nixon was ostensibly scaling down the conflict in Vietnam, the US Air Force began a series of secret bombings in Cambodia. Documentation has shown that this was on the suggestion of Kissinger, who recognised that, while the war in Vietnam was lost, losing the war in Vietnam completely and absolutely meant a blow to American prestige on the world stage. Kissinger - as completely a realist as it's possible to get - equally recognised that to maintain a balance of power on the world stage, the US needed to be seen as dominating its rivals, even in instances where it clearly could not. To that end, there could not simply be peace with North Vietnam - it needed to be peace in a way that allowed the US to maintain its position and maintain its interests in southeast Asia. And so, Cambodia, and an attempt to flush out the North Vietnamese from their Cambodian bases. Indeed, Nixon listed the objectives as threefold - to eliminate the North Vietnamese forces, to show that Nixon was serious about foreign policy, and to demonstrate continued American military might. \n\nNow, once again, while I talk about Nixon's motivations, at this point, Kissinger wielded a great deal of influence over US foreign policy. Nixon did, at times, turn to Kissinger to make things happen, as will be particularly well demonstrated later. How much of the blame can be placed on Kissinger and how much on Nixon for Cambodia, however, is a matter for debate. Let's assume for the sake of argument, though, that Cambodia was entirely Kissinger's idea, and that he was responsible for every aspect of it, from the initial \"hey, isn't this a nifty idea\" to the \"whap pow zocko\" as the bombs fell on Cambodia. Could we then say that Kissinger was guilty of war crimes? Well, not quite.\n\nTo be very clear, the bombing of Cambodia was illegal, regardless of who or what was bombed there. Cambodia was a sovereign, neutral nation, and while Nixon may have later justified the bombing by saying they sacrificed their neutrality by harbouring North Vietnamese militants, that's simply not how international law works. Cambodia was neutral, and bombing it was illegal. However, the fact that bombing Cambodia was illegal does not make Kissinger a war criminal. Considering Cambodia was a case of interstate violence, the United States as a nation would be held responsible rather than Kissinger in particular. \n\nHowever, let's set the question of the legality of bombing Cambodia aside. There is the problem with a guerrilla war that the bombing of Cambodia highlights. Guerrilla war, by it's very nature, is imprecise, especially when being waged from the air by Vietnam-era technology. Hell, the problems with guerrilla warfare *still* haven't been solved in the 21st century. If you'll recall the ICRC's list, the conditions make clear that the death of civilians alone does not constitute a war crime. It may sound callous, but civilian deaths are a natural part of war, and while governments should seek to avoid them, it's pretty much impossible to do so. The simple fact that civilians died isn't enough to say that Kissinger committed war crimes. What we would need instead would be the motivation for the bombings and whether the goals were military ones or instead \"let's blow people up for funsies\" ones. While I don't have exact quotes, things like [Nixon's speech](https://inspirationalspeakers.wordpress.com/2007/12/07/richard-m-nixon-cambodian-incursion-address/) about Cambodia do give a clue. How the Air Force treated these initial secret bombings, too, helps shed light on how Nixon and Kissinger viewed their actions in Cambodia, and whether they were targeting unnecessarily, or with solely military targets in mind. The objective of Operation Menu was a military one - to end the North Vietnamese hold on parts of Cambodia, and to eliminate North Vietnamese bases. The problem is that these bases didn't generally hold up giant flashy signs saying \"bomb me, please!\" In reality, bombing the strongholds and staging grounds necessitated hitting civilians as well. International customary law makes it clear that for an attack to be a war crime, civilians must be the target. As a policy, civilians were not the target. Does that mean civilians didn't die? Of course not. Does that mean there weren't horrendous consequences for US action in Cambodia? Once again, of course not. What happened in Cambodia was an abomination, and it was highly illegal, but it was not a war crime. \n\nCambodia, however, is not the only instance of Kissinger behaving questionably. If we skip ahead a bit to his tenure as Secretary of State under Ford, we run into the interesting problem of the genocide in Timor-Leste and the US relationship with Suharto. It's in this case that we see what Kissinger's realist worldview actually entailed. Timor-Leste was a tiny country on half of one of Indonesia's islands which had been ruled by Portugal, but in 1975 was trying to gain its independence. Suharto, the pro-American leader of Indonesia, disagreed with this, and forcibly put down the independence movement, killing nearly 200 000 people of Timor-Leste's population over the next two decades. \n\nOn the eve of Indonesia's invasion of Timor-Leste, Suharto met with Ford and Kissinger, asking them if they objected if he invaded Timor-Leste, citing his concerns about communist influences in the country. Kissinger, recognising the difficulty that would arise for American shipping lanes if there was a communist country there, said the US would not interfere, but that would Indonesia please do its best to keep its use of American weapons on the down-low? Suharto agreed, and Indonesia invaded the next day. \n\nThe [report ](http://www.cavr-timorleste.org/en/chegaReport.htm) of the Timor-Leste truth commission makes it abundantly clear that they feel the complicity of the US in not only allowing the Indonesian government to invade Timor-Leste, but also continue to provide arms to the Indonesian military had a dramatic and damaging impact on the genocide. The US could have intervened, but didn't, and could have stopped selling arms to Indonesia, but didn't, instead choosing to maintain its relationship with a pro-American leader. \n\nThat the US shares some blame for the genocide in Timor-Leste is undeniable, and that Kissinger's realist worldview and politics that he saw as having no place for human rights resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people is also clear. Had Suharto not gotten the permission of the US government, it's possible he still would have invaded, but perhaps not as brutally or as blatantly, and perhaps there might have been more of a reaction from the world at large. Hypotheticals, though, are not my business. Heinous though the genocide in Timor-Leste was, it still doesn't constitute a war crime on Kissinger's part. Suharto, absolutely, but Kissinger, if nothing else, wasn't involved in a war with Timor-Leste. His policies helped fuel it, but that's a far cry from actually ordering civilians massacred. \n\nWhich brings me to Chile, the last example people cite when talking about Kissinger as a war criminal. Once again, Chile can't be an example of Kissinger being a war criminal specifically because there wasn't a war, but I'll review the charges against him anyway. In 1970, Chileans were dreadfully excited about a fellow named Salvador Allende, a pro-Cuban, pro-socialist fellow who essentially embodied everything Kissinger and Nixon really, really did not want in South American. American businesses, too, were concerned about Allende and nationalisation of the copper industry, fearing that this would hurt their profits. Nixon and Kissinger planned a coup attempt to be enacted prior to Allende taking office, but it ultimately failed. Despite sanctions, Allende continued his dastardly socialist ways, and more drastic measures were planned. Throughout 1972 and 1973, the CIA fueled labour strikes and fomented rebellion in the military. However, it wasn't until 11 September, 1973 that the military - led by a fellow named Augusto Pinochet - successfully overthrew Allende in a coup, killing him and installing a military junta.  That the US was involved in supporting Pinochet before and after the coup is, once again, [undeniable](https://www.cia.gov/library/reports/general-reports-1/chile/). The US action violated Chilean national sovereignty is also undeniable. However, the simple fact that an action is distasteful and criminal does not automatically make it a war crime. While Kissinger played a key role in the planning and implementation of Allende's overthrow, that is not in and of itself a war crime. It's a crime, yes, but not a war crime. \n\nUltimately, it seems Kissinger is not a war criminal, nor did he commit war crimes. He committed distasteful and illegal actions, actions that violated national sovereignty and violated international law, but which were not in and of themselves war crimes. It's not inaccurate to blame genocides on Kissinger - certainly both the genocides in Cambodia and Timor-Leste would not have happened if there had been a more human rights-friendly Secretary of State in office - but that doesn't inherently make him guilty. What it means is that we can make examinations of what he did and his legacy, but throwing accusations of war crimes at him misunderstands both war crimes and what he actually did. \n\nSources!\n\nI did some digging to find a more thorough view of the case against Kissinger, which involved watching the documentary based on Hitchens' book (I didn't have time to read the book). I recommend it if you're interested in the case, even though as I think I've made clear, there are some gaps in it.\n\nRelated, [this](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/30/opinion/nixon-and-kissingers-forgotten-shame.html) is a good editorial that details the arguments people make against Kissinger and Nixon and their foreign policy decisions.\n\nWe have the [ICRC](https://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_rul_rule156) guide to how not to be a war criminal.\n\n\"Congress, Kissinger, and the Origins of Human Rights Diplomacy\" by Barbara Keys published in Diplomatic History gives a good insight into human rights during Kissinger's tenure\n\n\"Acknowledging our international criminals: Henry Kissinger and East Timor\" by Brandon Mark published in the Denver Journal of International Law and Policy is highly recommended if you're interested in the role the Ford administration played in the Timor-Leste genocide.\n\n\"Our Own Private Pinochet: Prosecuting Henry Kissinger\" by John Paul Ferguson in the SAIS Review also looks at this claim of Kissinger as a war criminal, though it takes a different route. I recommend it as well.\n\nThis list isn't complete without [two](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1tqldy/why_do_people_hate_henry_kissinger_is_there/) [AskHistorians](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1pcutg/when_people_say_henry_kissinger_was_guilty_of_war/) references, of which the first is much better, and also gives a much better idea of what happened in Chile.\n\n[Here's](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/honor/peopleevents/e_paris.html) a basic source on the Paris Peace Talks.\n\n[And another](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-21768668) on how Nixon...meddled in said peace talks.\n\nThe [Timor-Leste truth commission report](http://www.cavr-timorleste.org/en/chegaReport.htm), of course.\n\nAnd [CIA documents](https://www.cia.gov/library/reports/general-reports-1/chile/) about Chile",

        "text": "You may have seen banner ads for a series of \"narrative nonfiction\" books called *Never Subdued.* I saw one of their ads and clicked through and saw the mother of all bad history (Pinoy, Middle Eastern, and Spanish). The current installment discusses the Barbary Pirates of 1700s-1800s North Africa. I am transcribing the ads verbatim with R5s below.\n\n&gt;In Never Subdued II, Franklin Hook's narrative nonfiction studies the spread of radical Islam throughout the Mediterranean, Middle East, Southwest Asia and the rest of the world.\n\nCalling /r/badgeography. Although none of these terms are unambiguously defined, they all overlap. What is commonly defined as the \"Middle East\" is Southwest Asia plus Egypt and arguably the Arab countries of North Africa, which includes all of the southern and eastern Mediterranean.\n\n&gt;My curiosity was first piqued when I was doing research for my first historical narrative, Never Subdued, which involved Muslims of the southern Philippines, some of whom were pirates. I discovered that these characters were labeled Moros by the Spanish invaders because they were Muslims.\n\nFirst, the conflict that involved \"Muslims of the southern Philippines, some of whom were pirates\" was the Philippine-American War. Catholic and Muslim Filipinos alike fought against American troops, although the Muslims were somewhat better organized and took longer to put down.\n\n&gt;Of course, I learned quite a bit about the Moros during my original research, but many questions remained. Why, for example, did some of these practitioners of the Muslim religion turn to piracy?\n\nWhy did some Christians and even some [Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_pirates) turn to piracy? Piracy largely has more to do with being a seafaring culture than it does with being a Muslim one.\n\n&gt;Why was there such hostility to the Spanish and, currently, also to the Jews?\n\nEasy to explain: the Spanish kicked them out of their homes, along with the Sephardic Jews. The real hostility was felt by Catholic fanatics in Spain towards Muslims, not vice versa.\n\n&gt;Why where they such fanatics in following certain passages in the Koran, (also spelled Qur'an') especially those suggesting that murder and violence is an acceptable part of the culture? \n\nBarbary piracy and slavery were not all that different from European piracy and slavery; a number of the leading Barbary pirates were European pirates who converted to Islam for economic or other reasons. Also, the [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbary_pirates) for Barbary pirates shows exactly zero mentions of the Quran/Qur'an/Koran. The Qur'an does not explicitly endorse wanton violence and murder; the cases where violence is endorsed are a matter for debate at best (although this is more /r/bad_religion).\n\n&gt;I don't claim to be any expert of the Koran or the Muslim religion, but perhaps there are some significant parallels with the Christian Bible and the Torah (the Torah and the first five books of the old testament of the Christian Bible are the same) of the Hebrews that would explain fundamentalist thinking. \n\nWut? Is this dog-whistle anti-Semitism?\n\n&gt;This narrative nonfiction presents the consequences of religious intolerance from Christian, Jewish, and Muslim fundamentalists, and Hook masterfully relates this story to Isis and present day extremist states. Presenting a solid review of historical acts of terror from fanatics belonging to three of the major religions, Franklin Hook presents the reader with suggestions on how we can handle current situation with Isis and gives hope for the future.\n\nSkipping this paragraph (R2) aside from a brief mention that the current military and geopolitical context is very different from early 19th century Europe and North Africa.\n\nBONUS ROUND BAD PINOY HISTORY:\n\nLet's see how he handles the Philippine-American wars, which pitted both Muslim and Catholic Filipinos against the US Army (IANAF: I am not a Filipino so correct any errors)\n\n&gt;A peace proclamation in 1902 officially ended the insurgency, but the U.S. still faced the problem of controlling the southern islands, which were predominantly Muslim. Combat with Moro fundamentalists featured brutalities similar to those seen in today’s asymmetrical conflicts—hit-and-run attacks, personal jihad and heavy collateral damage on the civilian population.\n\nAs far as I know, religious fundamentalism was no more a motive of the Moros than it was of the Catholics of the northern islands, yet the author doesn't call them Catholic fundamentalists.\n\nhttp://www.neversubdued.com/ns1-reviews.php",

        "text": "Everyone knows [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzb747XkVeg). It's the one that's going to be stuck in your head for at least the next ten minutes. It's also one particular view of the Borden murders. [Here's](https://np.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/3hgsus/what_unresolved_mystery_has_in_your_opinion_an/cu86rmu) another, full of intrigue and suspicion. It's actually kind of amusing how, more than a century later, there's still so much debate about this particular murder and whether or not Lizzie Borden did it. There is no concrete answer, but I will say this - I'm pretty sure both the song and the post on /r/UnresolvedMysteries mysteries are wrong.\n\nI'll start with the song because that's easy. The song claims that Lizzie Borden gave, between her two parents, 81 whacks. This is, however, untrue. Regardless of what you believe about the origin of the whacks, there were, in fact, only 29 whacks distributed between the two parents. This was, however, enough for her father to be mutilated beyond recognition and her stepmother to be thoroughly dead. The ferocity of the whacking also suggests that it wasn't a matter of spontaneously deciding to kill the father after the mother - there's fairly solid evidence that both murders were pre-meditated. \n\nBut that's just pedantic stuff. The real question is, of course, whether Lizzie Borden did actually kill her father and step-mother.\n\nWhile Lizzie Borden was acquitted of the murder of her father and stepmother, most people assume - justifiably so - that she was still responsible. You have the standard legend of her burning a dress and hating everyone, and at face value, those seem like perfectly respectable reasons to suspect that she offed her parents. However, there is, as always, more to it than that. \n\nSo what is the truth? Lizzie lived with her father, stepmother, maid, and sister. While she wasn't known as a particularly hostile person, she very much did not like her stepmother, seeing her as a bit of a bitch. Her relationship with her father, on the other hand, is a bit more complex. As her lawyers journals reveal, she did legitimately mourn her father after his death, becoming emotional and filling her letters with grief. However, her sister would talk about how strict he was, and a few weeks prior to his death, Andrew Borden killed Lizzie's pet pigeons, something which rather offended her. Their relationship was, at times, fraught. \n\nOn the day of the murder, Lizzie supposedly found her father's body downstairs in their family home while her stepmother was found on the second floor. The father's body was still warm, implying he'd only been dead for a few minutes. After determining that there had been no forced entry, and after hearing Lizzie give contradictory and problematic answers to their question, police decided to investigate further, and on 11 August, 1892, she was arrested for the murder of her parents. \n\nThe evidence against her was compelling. Lizzie was the only one home at the time who could have committed both murders, and with no sign of forced entry, it was unlikely that someone broke in, hacked people apart, and scurried away. Lizzie was upstairs shortly after her mother was murdered, and yet didn't feel compelled to say anything. On 7 August, she was indeed burning a blue dress, though why is unclear. Basically, there's lots of reasons to think that she did it. However, on 20 June 1893, she was acquitted and sent on her merry way.\n\nLizzie Borden murdered her parents. While the evidence has been debated, it seems to me that there is no non-crazy theory that explains what happened any better. However, both the song and the post still misrepresent what happened. Lizzie Borden's journals and her lawyer's journals show a woman who was deeply upset by the murder of her father - not so much the stepmother - rather than the monster that the song depicts. Lizzie Borden has this reputation as a grand monster, but her own words and others' impressions of her paint a radically different picture of someone who, while she probably did brutally murder two people, was fairly decent most of the time. \n\nOf course, brutally murdering people usually gets someone off the \"decent\" list and into the \"monster,\" but circumstances and context make a difference. Some theories have suggested she was abused by her father, and looking at her as someone who snapped, it makes sense. Borden did a bad thing, absolutely, but she wasn't an all-out psychopath, as the song suggests. Rather, she was a woman who just killed a few people she didn't like. And really, what's so wrong with that?\n\n^^Disclaimer: ^^Quouar ^^would ^^like ^^to ^^emphasise ^^that ^^killing ^^people ^^is ^^wrong. ^^Please ^^don't ^^misunderstand ^^or ^^report ^^her.\n\nSources!\n\n[Here's](http://abcnews.go.com/US/lizzie-borden-murder-case-discovery-lawyers-journals/story?id=15910141) a good summary of the contents of Borden's letters and her lawyer's journals.\n\nAnd [this](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/LizzieBorden/bordenhome.html) is a surprisingly thorough account of the entire Borden affair",

        "text": "So over at /r/Pics someone [submitted]( https://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/3hul3p/nearly_a_thousand_years_ago_inca_masons_fit_this/) a lovely picture of a masonry block in a wall has 12, yes 12, sides. Amazing, I know. But what really is the most amazing thing about it, are the comments in the comment section. I will give people the benefit of the doubt when it comes to understanding how stonemasons did what they did before power tools and heavy machinery. Rocks are a hard substance. They are hard to break, hard to shape, and when they break you can’t fix them easily. So seeing a rather large block of stone shaped to have many different sides can be mind boggling to some. Some users thought it would take days to do to make, others thought weeks. One user even thought it would take *[lifetimes](https://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/3hul3p/nearly_a_thousand_years_ago_inca_masons_fit_this/cub08mh)* to do. What bothers me about all of this are the claims that [giants]( https://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/3hul3p/nearly_a_thousand_years_ago_inca_masons_fit_this/cuavga3) made those blocks or that a [geopolymer was used to soften the stone in order to shape it and parabolic gold mirrors were used to direct sunlight to “melt” the stone]( https://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/3hul3p/nearly_a_thousand_years_ago_inca_masons_fit_this/cuazrc2). I mean, really? What’s wrong with thinking that the Inca, or any other Native American people, used stone tools and hard work to make such wondrous buildings? Is it because they’re brown?  Is it because they lacked Guns, Germs, and Steel™? Or does it go back to people fundamentally not understanding how stonemasons do what they do? I believe it is the latter and would like to summarize how the Inca, and quite possibly previous cultures in the region, actually worked stone. This is going to be quite long, quite detailed, and probably boring for some. But construction is my thing. My thesis is literally on construction as well as architectural energetics (the quantification of labor) and labor organization. So this blatant disregard for the abilities of people in the past really gets under my skin so much so that this is going to be my first /r/badhistory submission. [So sit back and I hope you enjoy it.](http://i.imgur.com/cKBrN8s.gifv)\n\n---\n\nBack in the early-to-mid-80s, Jean-Pierre Protzen published two articles, both titled *Inca Quarrying and Stonecutting*, in 1983 and 1985. In the articles Protzen wanted to answer several questions. How did the Inca construct their buildings without mortar with precision shaped blocks? Why were the blocks irregularly shaped? How did the Inca stonemasons cut and fit the stones and erect these walls? He even made a passing comment about the mystical “herbal juice” that supposedly softened the rocks as well as “cosmic energies” used. He knew there had to be a better answer so he went out to find it.\n\nProtzen started by examining numerous Inca walls in and around Cuzco as well as visiting several quarry sites attributed to Inca activity. The two quarries he spent the most time examining were Kachiqhata which supplied the red and gray granite used in part of the construction of Ollantaytambo, and Rumiqolqa which supplied much of the andesite used in Cuzco. The Kachiqhata quarry is about 4km from Ollantaytambo across the Urubamba River and 700 to 900m above the valley floor. The quarry itself consists of two giant rockfalls below the cliffs of a gigantic outcrop that has penetrated through an environment of metamorphosed sedimentary rock (Protzen 1983: 183-184). The North and South Quarries at Kachiqhata are the ones that provide most the course-grained red granite found at Ollantaytambo. The grayish and much finer-grained granite found at the site was extracted from the West Quarry (Protzen 1983: 185). \n\nBetween Ollantaytambo and Kachiqhata is a ramp that [goes down from Ollantaytambo to the river and then up the mountain to the rockfall]( http://i.imgur.com/UaTuRc1.jpg). Along this ramp route are about 80 abandoned blocks of stone that never made it to the site to be used. The ramp incline varies between 8° and 12° with a width between 4 and 8m. In some instances the ramps are replaced with slides used to transport the blocks more quickly. The largest slide has a 40°  incline and runs 250m down a slope. At the bottom were four abandoned blocks. There is also a ramp to the east of this slide for those that don’t enjoy fun. [Rumiqolqa had a similar network of slides, ramps, and roads around the quarry to move blocks]( http://i.imgur.com/8XlPDPc.jpg), but Protzen doesn’t discuss that quarry nearly as much (Protzen 1983: 184).\n\n Rumiqolqa is 35 km southeast of Cuzco, considerably further than Kachiqhata is to Ollantaytambo, but near the highway connecting Cuzco to Qollasuyu. This quarry is situated around a volcanic outcrop of andesite which intruded upon the surrounding sandstone of the area (Protzen 1983:183-184). The High Quarry at Rumiqolqa provides flowbanded andesite in thin slabs. Many of these slabs are turned into tiles which are used to pave the streets of Cuzco. The East Quarry has columnar andesite and the Central Quarry has boulderlike andesite (Protzen 1983: 185).\n\nBack at Kachiqhata, the Inca did not quarry the granite in the proper sense. They did not cut the stone from a rock face or detach it from bedrock. Instead they went through the rockfall and carefully selected blocks to be used for construction. The quarry workers minimally dressed the stone and then the stone was sent on its way to the construction site for further adjustments and a final fitting. Several blocks at the site are in a state of final dressing as they made their way to the ramps for transport. One of them has [similar marks to an unfinished obelisk at Aswan]( http://i.imgur.com/qnFwXth.jpg) in which a hammerstone was used to pound away at a piece until the desired shape was reached. Protzen found in the West Quarry at Kachiqhata a several long “needles” of gray granite. These “needles” were about 7m long with a cross section of 40cm by 40cm. He guesses that these “needles” could have been broken into smaller blocks, but there doesn’t seem to be any traces of wedges or other tool marks (Protzen 1983: 186). Locals believed the “needless” were used to construct a bride over the Urubamba, but Protzen finds this unlikely since the river is about 20m to 30m wide. The only blocks that sound remotely like the “needles” are the lintel blocks used over the doorways at Manyaraqai (Protzen 1985: 167). *Ooooh, mysterious*.\n\nAt Rumiqolqa you find the opposite with the andesite. The rock is broken off the face of outcrops and dug out of pits. Unfortunately this quarry has still been worked into modern times. Protzen did find an isolated section of the quarry that appeared not to have any modern work in order to do his analysis. He named it the Llama Pit after two petroglyphs found on a nearby rockface, how cute. The pit is about 100m long by 60m wide and between 15m to 20m deep. Within the pit are about 250 stones in various stages of dressing that were ready to their duty and support the Empire, but for whatever reason were never finished and used (Protzen 1983: 186). The pit contains three types of stone. The first stratum is of porous and loose material near the surface that is used commonly in regular bond masonry in Cuzco. The second stratum contains fractured and denser rocks. The bottom stratum contains the dense and large pieces of andesite. The bottom layer is still fractured, but with large pieces that pose no problems in extracting from the ground with wooden sticks (Protzen 1983: 187).\n\nProtzen scoured the Rumiqolqa quarry for evidence of what tools were used to do all this quarrying and dressing and found it to be [simple river cobbles](http://i.imgur.com/jy8xa7M.jpg) used as hammer stones. Most of them are quartzo-feldspathic sandstones which have metamorphosed to various degrees in case you geologists were wondering. Some of them are pure quartize, granite, and olivine basalt. All of these hammers have a hardness of 5.5 on the Moh’s scale which is comparable to the andesite, but unlike the andesite, do not easily shatter and break. These hammerstones were then used to essentially flake off the block from the rock face (Protzen 1983: 188).\n \nBeing a man of science and probably having a nice grant in which to do something like this, Protzen set about [testing his hypothesis](http://i.imgur.com/10inmjh.jpg) using his own gathered hammerstone and a section of rockface that didn’t appear to have any previous work on it. Using a hammerstone made from metamorphosed sandstone Protzen was able to knock off a protrusion of andesite in just six blows. Using a second hammer [Protzen began to pound away](http://i.imgur.com/OR18A5H.jpg) at a face of the block to shape it. Direct blows just crushed the surface. Small angled blows created small flakes. Blows almost 45° to the surface produced the best result with the largest flakes. Protzen also found that despite his hammer weighing 4kg, the work was not that tiring if he let gravity do a large portion of the work. If you drop the hammer and keep your hands on it to guide it, the hammer will actually bounce back from the surface of the andesite.  To dress just one face it took Protzen, an unskilled mason, 20 minutes. In order to protect the finished face of a block, one must draft the edges to prevent chipping. This drafting accounts for the sunken joins commonly seen in Inca stone masonry. Most of the blocks had [dihedral angles greater than 90°](http://i.imgur.com/SNyo9Rq.jpg). Protzen was curious as to how the Inca made concave edges on some of their blocks. The answer came in the form of a long quartzite tool found at the quarry that could have been used as either a hammer or a chisel which shows wear on both the pointed and blunt ends. Evidence that Protzen is on the right track in understanding Inca masonry techniques comes from pit scars found on Inca walls. On limestone these pit scars show a whitish discoloration of the stone which is the result of a partial metamorphosis of the limestone produced by the hammer (Protzen 1983: 188-190).\n\nWhat Protzen discovered about these construction blocks is that there are two kinds of joints in construction: bedding joints, the joints which most of the weight is transmitted to the course below, and the lateral or rising joints, basically the sides of the block. The “[hookstones]( http://i.imgur.com/AIk3ViZ.jpg)” that Bingham describes at Machu Picchu are not so much ways to keep the blocks from moving, but where two walls met from two different groups building the same wall. If Bingham was correct in saying that “*such a house, whose attic was entirely above the level of the Beautiful Wall, would tend to lean away from the wall*” than the “hookstones” would have done nothing to keep the wall from falling apart (Prtozen 1983: 191-192).\n\nAfter examining wall constructions Protzen discovered that [many of the blocks contained cuts made into the stone to receive the next block above it]( http://i.imgur.com/xZp8HZq.jpg). This refutes the idea that the blocks were ground against each other to obtain a perfect fit.  To understand how this was done Protzen did an experiment on two andesite blocks; the smaller one was used to understand the dressing process and the other larger one to understand the bedding joint process. Protzen placed the smaller block on the larger and outlined the face using the sap from a bush called *llawilli* which the local quarrymen use for their own work. After outlining the block Protzen pounded out the shape and used the dust produced from the process to check his work by placing the smaller block back in position and seeing where the dust was compressed. This may or may not have been a part of the Inca process, there is really no way to tell. This is ultimately a technique of trial and error and took a while for Protzen, he didn't specify how long, and he is an unskilled stone tool using stonemason. In the hands of a skilled stonemason familiar with using stone tools the time would obviously be less. This technique allows for the close joints observed in many of the walls and takes into account the sometimes curved seams between blocks (Protzen 1983:192-193).\n\nRising joints are deceptive to the observer. Unlike bedding joints which are fairly even throughout the seam, rising joints are not always so consistent. [Sometimes they only look like they fit together for the first few centimeters. The interior of the joint is often filled with rubble]( http://i.imgur.com/HGfkqKO.jpg) (I should note, those are two different blocks in two different walls). Harth-terré (1965) dubbed this method “wedge-stone” construction. The lateral joints were shaped in a similar way to bedding joints in that the new block was fitted into the already laid blocks with joints taken out to make it fit (Prtozen 1983: 193). Thus the 12 sided block that this has all been about may not even be truly 12 sided if you pulled it out, just the face is 12 sided. Very upsetting for a lot of readers I’m sure.\n\nWhat about build order? Protzen drew a [wall section]( http://i.imgur.com/GOHtfoK.jpg) with a corner from the First Rampart at Saqsawaman. What Protzen did was look at the blocks, look at how they were fitted together, and tried to determine in which order they were most likely placed. Knowing how the blocks were shaped and how the sides of the faces can be deceptive, one can piece together the building order based on the bedding joints (Protzen 1983: 193-195).\n\nUnfortunately Protzen doesn’t discuss how the blocks were transported or lifted into place. I think I’ve read something about it or something similar for cultures that lacked draft animals, but I’m going to save that for another day. I welcome any feedback and criticism. Like I said at the beginning of this whole thing, I just wanted to summarize these articles in light of all the ignorant comments in /r/Pics.\n\n I’ve uploaded the articles to Dropbox if anyone wants to read them.\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/ry56j3tus7chmp8/1983%20Inca%20Quarrying%20and%20Stonecutting%20by%20Jean-Pierre%20Protzen.pdf?dl=0\n\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/hmxt4bi4lp1d0mk/1985%20Inca%20Quarrying%20and%20Stonecutting%20by%20Jean-Pierre%20Protzen.pdf?dl=0",

        "text": "One of my favourite composers is [Franz Liszt](http://ellispiano.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Franz_Liszt.jpg), and I freely admit it's not necessarily because of his music - though I do enjoy his music - but just because of how awesome his life was. This is a [man](http://piano4life.com/composers_files/imageLISZT3.jpg) who sexed his way across Europe, was so [handsome](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Ary_Scheffer_-_Franz_Liszt.jpg) that women would go insane at the sight of him (a condition known as \"[Lisztomania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisztomania),\" and I highly recommend reading the article about it), and who eventually up and decided to become a monk, all while remaining [sexy](http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/976x549/p01bqfjg.jpg) into old age. Also, he wrote good music. My perfectly healthy and normal fondness for Liszt means that when I ran across [this piece](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6827635/1/The-Muse) about Liszt and his life, I was intrigued, but also alarmed as there are some inaccuracies in it. Some gross inaccuracies, actually, particularly with regards to his relationship with Chopin, his contemporary, frenemy, and sometimes rival. \n\nThe relationship between [Liszt](http://direct-ns.rhap.com/imageserver/v2/artists/Art.2724/images/356x237.jpg) and Chopin is an interesting one, and one scholars have been discussing ad nauseum. I read a few articles, so I'm clearly equipped to enter the fray and comment on Pearlescent-Night's depiction of their relationship, and whether there was ever a sexual element to it.\n\nSpoiler alert: probably not.\n\n[Liszt](http://36.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_llyzihikxN1qeu6ilo1_1280.jpg) and Chopin had, as I said, a complex relationship that was characterised by mutual respect, and sometimes actual friendship. Their careers started around the same time, with both receiving rave reviews of their performances in Vienna and Warsaw respectively in 1823. However, it wasn't until 1832 when both men were in Paris that they first met, with [Liszt](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Liszt_in_1843.jpg/486px-Liszt_in_1843.jpg) attending one of Chopin's concerts. After that, they often performed together in salons, for princes, for charity events, and basically anywhere someone really wanted a pair of virtuosos. Both were highly acclaimed, greatly beloved, and generally considered to be pretty awesome. This didn't mean the two were friends, however. Chopin wrote at one point that \"the themes of [Liszt's] compositions will repose with the newspapers,\" not a terribly nice thing to say. By 1833, they were rather fond of each other, with Chopin writing things like:\n\n&gt; I hardly even know what my pen is scribbling, since at the moment [Liszt](http://www.stephenhicks.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/franz-liszt.jpg) is playing one of my etudes and distracting my attention from my respectable thoughts. I would love myself to acquire from him the manner in which he plays my [etudes].\n\nTitillating indeed, and perhaps part of what Pearlescent-Night is referencing in her piece about the two men. Indeed, the etudes in the quote were specifically dedicated to [Liszt](http://www.nndb.com/people/928/000026850/liszt.jpg), implying they had some degree of friendship. However, [Liszt](http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/ED-AN854A_ravin_DV_20110706173104.jpg) didn't always share the sentiment. Throughout his relationship with Chopin, he remained somewhat jealous of the other composer, particularly because Chopin was seen as a more serious composer while [Liszt](http://www.byersmusic.com/resources/Liszt%20photo.jpg) was mostly seen as a showman. While this wasn't the key to their eventual falling out, it most certainly contributed to tension between the two of them. \n\nA combination of factors broke up the lovely couple. In 1835, for instance, [Liszt](http://www.interlude.hk/front/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/in-love-liszt-2.jpeg) had sex with one of Chopin's best friend's daughters in Chopin's apartment, something which Chopin was understandably upset about. Later, a schism would develop between Chopin's lover, George Sand, and [Liszt's](http://www.violinstudent.com/images/liszt.jpg) lover, Marie d'Agoult, further driving the composers apart. In 1841, [Liszt](http://img11.deviantart.net/14a3/i/2014/308/5/5/l_abbe_liszt_by_rhapsody_in_white-d859rc1.jpg) wrote a long and, in the words of Chopin biographer Derek Melville, \"singularly unpleasant and vindictive\" review of one of Chopin's rare public concerts, something which Chopin also took personally. By the time Chopin died in 1849, the two were no longer close, though a letter from 1848 still referred to [Liszt](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Franz_Liszt_1839_Litho.JPG/800px-Franz_Liszt_1839_Litho.JPG) as \"my friend.\" \n\nTo further complicate things, while [Liszt](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Franz_Liszt_by_Herman_Biow-_1843.png) wasn't close to Chopin when he died, by November 1849, he had erected a monument to Chopin, and was writing his biography, a work that is full of flowery praise. In a letter in 1876, [Liszt](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Barabas-liszt.jpg) would write about Chopin that \"no one compares to him: he shines lonely, peerless in the firmament of art,\" once again high praise. \n\nWhat I think best describes their relationship is a friendship that was tense, but built on mutual respect and admiration. The two men were professional rivals, and that did eventually get in the way of their personal relationship, but I suspect neither ever lost respect or affection for the other. They were similar guys, and they recognised that in each other, and it brought them together.\n\nThey weren't gay lovers, though. They...no. No, that didn't happen. \n\nSources!\n\n\"Liszt on Chopin, Chopin on Liszt\" by Alex Szilasi published in the Hungarian Review is a good overview of their relationship, even if it goes a little soft. \n\n[This podcast](http://www.radiochopin.org/episodes/item/526-radio-chopin-episode-67-etudes-op-10-nos-4-6-10) episode gives a quick overview of their relationship, and takes a harsher perspective.\n\n\"Chopin\" by Derek Melville is a good biography of Chopin.\n\nAlan Walker's series of biographies of Liszt also give a pretty good look at his life.\n\nYou should also read [Liszt's biography of Chopin](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4386). While it's debated whether or not he actually wrote it (majority opinion is that he let one of his lovers do it), it's still interesting.",

Cruising around for some links when I wrote [this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskAnthropology/comments/3hda0j/what_are_the_origins_of_contemporary_money/cu6ndfi) for askanthro, I found [this](https://mises.org/library/money-banking-and-federal-reserve-complete-transcript) article/video on money and banking. (Yeah, von Mises institute, low-hanging fruit for bad econ.) The part on the origin of money is addressed in my askanthro post. However, I want to pick one specific thing out of this article:\n\n&gt;Wampum shells were money to North American Indians...\n\nI would say this is not completely false, but misleading. Wampum shells *became* currency through contact with European traders. I'll quote from Albert Cave's *The Pequot War* (pp. 52-53), which contains a chapter on wampum that spells it out very succinctly:\n\n&gt;...[T]he equation of the beads to European jewels or money did not accurately convey its true nature.\n\n&gt;...\n\n&gt;Under European influence, wampum was soon transformed into a form of currency, used by both English and Indians to pay for trade goods. But in pre-contact Native American societies it was essentially a means of effecting vital social transactions. It served as the insignia of chiefs and commanded the service of shamans. Wampum consoled the bereaved and celebrated marriages. It was offered as compensation for crimes and could be used to end blood feuds.\n\nCave continues listing various uses of wampum in a long paragraph.\n\nNext, he notes the effects of imported metal tools on eastern woodlands peoples:\n\n&gt;In the precontact period, wampum was scarce, its manufacture with stone implements being slow and laborious. The acquisition from Europeans of metal tools, however, made possible large-scale production. ... As wampum became more plentiful, its function within Indian society changed. European technology and trade transformed the beads \"from one among many items of exchange to a 'currency' that flowed into the hands of prestigious and ordinary Indians alike.\"\n\ntl;dr: Wampum was not originally used as currency.",

        "text": "Hello, comrades!\n\nSo as some of you may recall, I took a class last semester on the topic of Russian history. Fun stuff. Well, as it turns out, one of my books committed some bad history, and as a loyal badhistorian I believe that it is my *duty* to point it out (also, I want to contribute to the pedantry which /u/Quouar seems to have a monopoly on). Why didn't I post earlier? Because I'm a lazy ass and forgot about it so I'm writing this out of boredom. \n\nAnyway, I like Ronald Suny as a historian. His work is pretty comprehensive, which was very useful for someone kind of new to modern Russian history--or, even, Russian history in general. But, I will not stand for this sort of bad history. \n\n\nThe following passage is from page 344 of the soft cover copy of his \"The Soviet Experiment: Russia, the USSR, and the Successor States\": \n\n&gt; Meanwhile Leningrad was besieged from the north by the Finns and Germans from the south. The Finns regained much of the territory they had lostin the Russo-Finnish War and came within twenty miles of Leningrad...[...]...For the next three years, Leningrad endured the longest siege of any city since biblical times.  \n\nFirst off, this is more bad math, but 900 days is closer to 2 years and 4 months (or, if you want to be like Data: (2 years, 4 months, 2 weeks and 5 days. Although, Data would probably insist on measuring the siege to the exact *minute* that it ended...or our at least, but back on topic!).\n\nSecond, saying that the Siege of Leningrad was the \"longest siege of any city since biblical times,\" is really stupid because it can be easily debunked. \n\nTo list a few examples:\n\n* The [Siege of Candia (1 May 1648 – 27 September 1669)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Candia) lasted 21 years\n* The [Siege of Tripoli (1102 to 1109)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Tripoli) lasted 7 years\n* The [Siege of Thessalonica (1422 - 1430)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Thessalonica_\\(1422%E2%80%9330\\)) lasted 8 years\n\nFurthermore, The [Siege of Ceuta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Ceuta_\\(1694-1727\\)) is allegedly the longest siege in history, having lasted 33 years.  \n\nAnd, on one final but unrelated note: I am *shocked* to see that there's no sortable list of sieges on Wikipedia. How could you fail me, Wikipedia? How? \n\nGood day, comrades. \n",

        "author": "TheZizekiest",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3hncq3/the_repetition_of_meaningless_ideologies_is_no/",
        "text": "Beware all ye communists who enter here.  Bourgeois conceptions of balance, bias, and knowledge reside beyond this point.\n\nThis is a review of the [*“Debunking Anti-Communism” Masterpost*]( https://np.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/2pwxm5/the_debunking_anticommunism_masterpost/) from /r/communism.  The goal in writing this is to ascertain whether or not his ‘masterpost’ actually gives us enough reason to reject the alleged myths.  I am not going to try and solve historiography which is hotly debated in academia.  Instead, I am going to try and show why the way this masterpost presents its sources is problematic, and that biggest strength is that it establishes the need to read widely in order to develop a fair and balanced account of history.\n\nAt this point I am not sure if I am going to do the whole source, or just a few points.  This post will only be about the first myth, which relates to Holodomor.  I will only use the sources presented in the masterpost.  The reason for this is because if this was the only resource you had ever seen on Soviet history you wouldn’t know about any other sources.  My goal is to discern, if these were the only sources I had access to, would it be reasonable to accept that Holodomor was a natural famine?\n\nThe first point I would like to raise is that this ‘masterpost’ presents a large number of sources without explicitly extracting what claims they are making, just as the [HBDR did](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadSocialScience/comments/3cdz2z/rcoontowns_human_biodiversity_resource/).  This resource, however, does better than the HBDR in this regard.  First of all, its headers are less ambiguous than the HBDR which had names like ‘Human Biodiversity General’ while this one has large headers such as ‘The Soviet Union and Eastern Europe’ which, while still vague, are supplemented by sub-headings which detail alleged myths, such as ‘The Soviet Union Manufactured a Famine in Ukraine.’  Moreover, rather than present a deductive argument based on a series of tangentially related claims as the HBDR did (Ethnic background is the most significant determinant of differences in bone marrow, Differences in bone marrow are hereditary, Differences in intelligence are hereditary, therefore, Ethnic background is the most significant determinant of differences in intelligence) a cursory glance seems to indicate the masterpost presents sources which directly make the claims specifically made in the section (ie. It will present four sources which directly claim that the famine in the Ukraine was not manufactured by Soviets).\n\nThe lack of an evaluation of the sources presented makes this resource very difficult to analyse from a lay-perspective.  In fact, these sources being presented as they are is extremely problematic, as it does not offer any opposing arguments.  This is fine for academics, but this is not itself an academic resource, and given that it is sourced back to Facebook it is reasonable to assume many of its readers are not academics.  As such, I would use the tools I would use to evaluate these sources, as if I was evaluating them for an academic essay.  This means I will read introductions, look for citations, reviews, and reputation.  It also means that if a source doesn’t meet my criteria I will not read the source.\n\nWhether or not a source *should* stand on its own is a different debate, here, I am contending with the reality that I am not dedicating my life to Soviet study, and so will probably never have time to treat every source on its own.  Even if I read them all it is unlikely I will follow up their sources, investigate dubious claims and generally gain as good an evaluation as an academic reviewer would.\n\n&gt;**SECTION 1: THE SOVIET UNION AND EASTERN EUROPE**\n\n#\n\n&gt; ANTI-COMMUNIST MYTH NUMBER 1: THE SOVIET UNION MANUFACTURED A FAMINE IN UKRAINE\n\nFull disclosure: I am of the position that the Holodomor famine occurred, and that it was exacerbated through Soviet incompetence, and probably apathy, however, it was by no means intentional.  I do not consider the Soviet’s blameless for the famine, however, I do not consider the Soviet impact on the Holodomor Famine to be an argument against communism in and of itself.  I do not consider myself an expert on this issue, and my view is probably influenced by over-exposure to left-wing sources.\n\nFour sources are presented for this claim:\n\nRESOURCE 1: Fraud, Famine, and Fascism by Douglas Tottle http://rationalrevolution.net/special/library/tottlefraud.pdf\n\nRESOURCE 2: \"The 1932 Harvest and the Famine of 1933\" by Mark Tauger http://www.as.wvu.edu/history/Faculty/Tauger/Tauger,%20%27The%201932%20Harvest%20and%20the%20Famine%20of%201933,%20SR%2091.pdf\n\nRESOURCE 3: Natural Disaster and Human Actions in the Soviet Famine of 1931–1933 by Mark Tauger http://www.as.wvu.edu/history/Faculty/Tauger/Tauger,%20Natural%20Disaster%20and%20Human%20Actions.pdf\n\nRESOURCE 4: The Years of Hunger: Soviet Agriculture, 1931–1933 by Davies and Wheatcroft  http://libgen.in/get.php?md5=32DAA2871728468189A57E0233492A3A\n\nThe first thing I would like to talk about is the nature of the sources themselves.  A cursory examination makes it seem as though these are reasonable resources.  The first, *Fraud, Famine, and Fascism*, does not come from an academic source, however, it is well sourced, and contains an extensive bibliography.  The notes contain both primary and (often academic) secondary sources.  *The 1932 Harvest and the Famine of 1933* is from a peer-reviewed journal, and the historian is employed at a reputable, if not elite, [school]( https://history.wvu.edu/faculty/current-faculty/mark-b-tauger).  *Natural Disaster and Human Actions in the Soviet Famine* comes from the same author, and is also academic, published by [these guys](http://www.ucis.pitt.edu/crees/publications/cbpapers).  The final source, * The Years of Hunger: Soviet Agriculture* is also written by historians at reputable universities.  Davies is professor emeritus of Soviet Economic Studies at the University of Birmingham, while Wheatcroft is a professor of history at the University of Melbourne, and a fellow of the Australian Academy of Social Sciences.\n\nOne problem, particularly with the first source, might be bias.  The fact that two of the four writers across the sources are employed by universities in Soviet specialty positions, and one other is employed in a History department, would indicate that this is not too much of an issue.  Tottle, on the other hand, has written about little else, and evidence seems to suggest his book,  *Fraud, Famine, and Fascism* is mostly promoted by socialist/communist institutions.^1  I could not find any academic reviews of this book, and I do not have the time, nor the expertise, to write a review now.  I would be inclined to suggest that this book is biased, and should not be used as a source on its own.  Given this issue on bias I would like to stress that for somebody who has not read any texts on the Holodomor this does not present the best introductory text and it is problematic that it is first on the list.\n\nNow, I don’t claim to be able to solve the disputes surrounding the historiography of Holodomor in a Reddit post; that would be absurd.  If I could do that I would be writing it for a journal or more likely a book.  What I do claim to be able to say, however, is whether or not we should consider the claims contained by this resource as reasonable.  Given that there is such significant dispute, which ranges from whether a famine occurred, to whether or not it was man-made, to whether or not it constituted a genocide, it is probably worth taking these sources seriously.  By no means am I claiming them to be correct, however, if you have not read these sources it would be reasonable to describe your position on the Holodomor as biased.  Maybe not ‘mythical’, but certainly biased.\n\nAs such, I would suggest reading these texts, and analysing them yourself if you want to actually have a developed opinion on the topic.  If you have read nothing about the Holodomor, you should read these, but also read books and articles offering opposing perspectives, and perhaps read some of them first.  If you already know about the Holodomor, or have read enough to form what you see as a justified view, you should probably supplement what you already know with these texts.  Even if you read them and disagree with them it is important to consider these perspectives in order to form a fair, balanced view of the subject.\n\nSo, that’s everything to be said about the nature of the sources, but what about their contents?\n\nI would like to look at four arguments presented in these texts:\n\n# 1. Evidence used to show the Holodomor is often times doctored, either by fascists or by the U.S.S.R\nTottle: chapters 1 and 2\n\nTauger, 1991: “This interpretation...overlooks inconsistencies between official grain harvest statistics...and the evidence of the famine, as well as indications from other sources that these records may be unreliable” p. 70\n\n\n# 2.  The argument that the Holodomor was Soviet-caused, or a genocide, is the result of Ukrainian nationalist, fascist, and anti-communist cold war views.\n\nTottle: The entire book, except for part 2 really.  This claim is interwoven throughout the text, looking at how specific groups attempted to do this.\n\n# 3.  The main argument that high grain procurements under collectivization caused the famine is not supported by the evidence\n\nTauger, 2001: The table showing grain procurements is on page 1. \n\n# 4.  The Holodomor was not a genocide, and was likely not motivated by Soviet hostility, due to the variety of people affected.\n\nTauger, 2001: First makes this claim on page 1\n\nThis is not the entirety of what is included within these texts.  They also seek to establish other factors which caused Holodomor.  I am only interested in whether or not this source gives us reason to debunk anti-communist myths, and while the ability to offer up an alternate interpretation certainly adds to the argument it is not something upon which the argument requires.  One must first show that the original interpretation is flawed before you can argue for a new interpretation.\n\nThe first of these four points is argued by Tollet, who argues that many of the photographs used as evidence for the Holodomor were fascist hoaxes.  We must be careful to note, however, that just because some evidence is fabricated does not mean that all evidence is fabricated.  While this does establish that certain views about the Holodomor may be ‘mythical’ it does not show that all views about it were.  In short; this does not show that there was no famine, just that claims about the famine are often exaggerated.  It should as a reminder that, particularly when looking at issues as polarising as this, we should always be careful to note potential bias of our sources, and should investigate every claim thoroughly. \n\nTauger argues that the numbers used to justify the high grain production of 1832 were fabricated by the Soviets.  Again, this should serve us as a reminder to analyse our sources.  I do find this claim slightly problematic, as Tauger accepts the Soviet reports for grain procurements and uses these to justify his argument that grain procurements were actually lower in 1832 than in other years.  Further investigation of Tauger’s work, and the sources he used, would be necessary to understand how he arrived at his numbers, and why he uses them.  Such an investigation is, unfortunately, beyond the scope of this write up.\n\nThe second of these points is central to Tollet’s book.  MY biggest criticism of this is that, while the most ardent detractors of the Holodomor may be Ukrainian nationalists, and fascists this view is also supported by several academic historians.  Given this, should we also reject those denying that Holodomor was man-made because they are communist?  It seems there is probably more correlation in the second instance than in the first.  While I personally agree that fascist and Ukrainian nationalist, not to mention Cold War, propaganda has exaggerated the extent of Holodomor I would not use this as one of my central arguments because that opens me up to the exact same criticism.\n\nI have already responded to the third point in my discussion of Tauger in relation to the first point.\n\nThe fourth point is established by Tauger.  Tauger argues that the famine affected a variety of groups, including military personal, and that the government distributed most of its food in order to alleviate this problem.  This seems problematic, however, as, if the famine was affecting everyone is it not possible that Ukrainians were somehow last on the list for food, and thus disproportionally affected by it?\n\nIn short, my biggest criticism of this view is that it still leaves us with questions.  By not presenting academic sources in favour of the view that Holodomor was caused by the Soviet government it makes itself seem more biased.  Given that the arguments against the prevailing view on the Holodomor are not themselves watertight making a coherent argument either way requires intense investigation of evidence from both sides. Because this source does not present evidence from both sides I would not recommend forming your view on the Holodomor from it alone.  Supplementing these sources with other sources will allow you to have a deeper understanding of the evidence, and the circumstances surrounding Holodomor.\n\nMy biggest problem with this source is its lack of contesting sources.  This is why I think presenting sources in a list form as this (and the HBDR) does it problematic.  If the compiler of this resource actually spent the time to write a short introductory essay on the topic they could have also included references to contesting sources.  It would make for a much more balanced account, and someone looking to learn would actually have a fair chance to make up their mind on the issue.  As it stands, by presenting no contesting sources, by not contextualising the sources it does present within the wider historiography, it makes it seem as though the compiler thinks you wouldn’t be convinced if you saw contesting evidence.\n\nUnfortunately, the link for book number four is dead.  Luckily, because it is academic, reviews exist, so I will give a summary of this book based on four reviews:\n\nReview by: Andrea Graziosi, Slavic Review, Vol. 67, No. 3 (Fall, 2008), pp. 774-775\n\nReview by: Paul Gregory. The Journal of Modern History,  Vol. 78, No. 2, June 2006 \n\nReview by: Carol Scott Leonard. Europe-Asia Studies Vol. 57, No. 1 (Jan., 2005), pp. 155-156\n\nReview by: David Moon. The English Historical Review, Vol. 120, No. 487 (Jun., 2005), pp. 798-800\n\nThese reviews are largely positive, however, they do problematize the book.  \n\n&gt;“Definitive work on Soviet agriculture in the key period 1931-1933” - Gregory\n\n&gt;“This is an important, solid, useful, yet flawed book” - Graziosi, p.773\n\nOne criticism that is raised is that it is ‘history from  above,’ or focuses too much on the state’s view, than on the view of the peasants affected.\n\n&gt;”Its protagonists are the regime's upper cadres, and the story...is almost always reconstructed through their eyes.” Graziosi p.773\n\nOne thing I would like to note is that it seems from the reviews that the book does blame Holodomor on the Soviet government, however, it ascertains that the intent was not to cause a famine, but to aid Soviet industrialization:\n\n&gt;“Davies and Wheatcroft find abundant eviidence of rigid ideological decision making and tragic mistakes but no record of the use of famine as a deliberate policy” Leonard - p.155\n\n&gt;“Taken in its entirety, Years of Hunger is an indictment of Soviet agricultural policy, although the authors appear to subscribe to the view that an ambitious industrialization program would not have been possible had agriculture not first been brought under firm administrative control” - Gregory\n\n&gt;“They prove the majority of victims could have been saved” - Graziosi, p.773\n\n&gt;”the authors note occasions when the Party leadership took decisions that, at least partly and in the short term, may have benefited the rural population” Moon, p.799\n\nFrom the reviews this source seems like the best presented in the ‘masterpost.’  In fact, this source actually counteracts many of my earlier claims about the masterpost.  It is clearly not written from a place of bias or ideology.  Unlike the first book, which focuses too much on other people’s construction of the Holodomor it investigates the event itself.  Its use of Soviet archives which other books on the topic didn’t have access to also mean it provides a convincing case. \n\nThat being said, it does still claim that the famine was man-made.  It just claims that there was no intent to cause a famine.  From this book we might accept that the famine occurred, was not a genocide, and was not motivated by malicious intent, however, it was still man-made.\n\nThat being said, this book is fourth in the list, and the link is dead.  I have found it on Amazon, but whether a Facebook communists would spend money to justify their beliefs remains to be seen.  When I was 19 people in my local ISO thought I was weird because I actually bought pamphlets, and I don’t know if I would have gone so far as to buy a book.  I get that this is hardly a definitive argument against the ‘masterpost’ however I think “Your best source is your least accessible” is a fair criticism.  This also brings us back to the problem of the ‘list’ masterpost.  If you wrote a short, introductory essay you could have explained the claims made by this book and sourced it, so that people who can’t access it could still know what its claims are.\n\nGiven the inclusion of this source, I would actually say that the resource does give us reason to accept that Holodomor was not **intentionally**man-made, provided you read sources not presented in the masterpost as well.  It does not give us reason to accept that Holodomor was natural, or inevitable, or even necessary.  The biggest issue with the masterpost is its presentation, which does not allow for claims to be easily extracted.  It also does not allow for the presentation of counter claims, which indicates a substantial amount of bias.  Because of these two issues, if one only has access to the first three sources then they would not have enough justification that the Holodomor was not man made, however, with the fourth source this changes, provided you read sources from outside the masterpost too.\n\nOverall, I think these problems are big enough to refer to this source as ‘bad history.’  This is mostly just an issue with presentation, however, and not an issue with the actual content of the source.\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n1.  Even though this book is only endorsed by socialist/communist institutions it is still an important book, and recognised by non-communists.  The Wikipedia page on ‘Denial of the Holodomor’ references it, and Tottle was invited to speak at a non-judicial [International Commission of Inquiry Into the 1932–33 Famine in Ukraine,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Commission_of_Inquiry_Into_the_1932%E2%80%9333_Famine_in_Ukraine) , however, this event was put on by Ukranian Nationalists, so unsurprisingly Tottle did not attend.  This does show, however, that Tottle’s book is one of the more important books on Holodomor denial.\n",

        "text": "I admit, this was originally going to be a post about Hammurabi's code specifically, but as I rewatched this video, I just couldn't let it slide. I know new atheist history is something that's been done before, but I like talking about history of religion. I like learning about religions and their origins. I like talking to other people about these things, and so I just can't help myself. Yes, it's been done, but let me have my fun.\n\n[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khSo-bgjDT8&amp;feature=share) the video. As usual, you'll never guess where I found it (hint: Facebook feed), but it's fairly typical of a new atheist video. You have your host person rattling off something about how Christianity can't be true because other religions have similar stories and other ancient legal codes were more complete, all while missing rather large aspects of context and cultural differences. It's the sort of thing that is incredibly shallow and makes atheism look...well...stupid. \n\nBut let's have a look at this. The host kindly divides up her argument for us, so well take her divisions. At :32, she says:\n\n&gt; Ancient Sumerians thrived around 5000 BC. They are the inventors of writing. \n\nI'll pause here for a second. There's two different aspects of this statement that need to be looked at. First off, \"thrived\" is an interesting word. I'm not entirely clear on what it means in this context, but I'm pretty sure it's a more specific word than just \"they existed here at this time.\" Archaeological evidence suggests that the Sumerians were a settled people around 5000 BCE, but that's something rather distinct from \"thriving,\" unless we define \"thrive\" as \"were there.\" It's not until nearly a millennium later during the Uruk period that Sumerians started having a major influence on the other Mesopotamian people around them. It's at that point that they start having intricate trade routes that carry Sumerian pottery and goods around the Near East, and that had influence over the development of surrounding cultures. It's not until after even this that the Sumerians developed a system of writing. To be honest, I'm not sure at what point they started \"thriving,\" but it was after 5000 BCE.\n\nAnd speaking of writing, the lady in the video makes it sound like the Sumerians were the sole inventors of writing. It's something I run into a lot, this misconception that writing was invented once and only once and that it was Mesopotamians that did it. It's a rather Eurocentric viewpoint, and while I'm aware I tend to fixate on that, I like doing so and you can't stop me. We know writing was invented at least two independent times, and likely more, once in Sumer around 3200 BCE, and again in Mesoamerica 2600 years later around 600 BCE. Really, if we want to get broader, the invention of a writing system for numbers is even earlier than that, with people marking numbers well before 4000 BCE. However, for simplicity's sake, let's look at written language rather than numbers. As I said, Sumerians had writing around 3200 BCE, but there were a few other systems of writing that were invented probably independently. There is no evidence, for instance, that the Chinese had contact with Mesopotamia, so Chinese writing was likely invented independently. Egypt, while it did have trade contact with Sumer also has a qualitatively different writing script, meaning that it's possible it was invented independently, or that it's just the idea of writing that arrived from Sumer rather than writing itself. However, the idea that Sumer itself was the only place to invent writing is completely inaccurate - writing wasn't unique to Mesopotamia.\n\nBut let's continue with the video. After listing common ancient Near Eastern story tropes which are meant to demonstrate the derivativeness of Bible stories, she goes on to say:\n\n&gt; Hammurabi's Code from ancient Babylonia came hundreds of years before the Ten Commandments and were more complete and evolved. Of the Ten Commandments, only four of them are really relevant or have any significance, and Hammurabi covered them all, plus more. An interesting thing to know is that Hammurabi's Code actually had women's rights written into the law. \n\nRemember when I was harping on about context? This is what I was thinking of. Hammurabi's Code does indeed contain ancient rights for women, like the right to divorce (sort of) and the right to recompense if they are beaten and have a miscarriage. They're not hugely progressive rights from our modern perspective, but I'm not going to fault Hammurabi for not including voting rights or equal pay. Saying there are circumstances under which a woman could leave her husband is good enough. \n\nHowever, what's relevant for our purposes is not only whether or not there were women's rights, but what else was in Hammurabi's Code. The Code contains 282 laws, some of which are applicable to modern society - like 196:  If a man put out the eye of another man, his eye shall be put out - and others which are not - like 25: If fire break out in a house, and some one who comes to put it out cast his eye upon the property of the owner of the house, and take the property of the master of the house, he shall be thrown into that self-same fire. It's full of esoteric laws which are probably very relevant if you are an ancient Babylonian, but not terribly relevant if you're not.\n\nWhich brings me back to her statement about \"relevance\" and \"significance.\" From a modern perspective, sure, \"thou shalt have no other gods before me\" isn't really a terribly useful law. However, setting aside any question of religious truth, from a historical perspective, we living in 2015 are not the target audience of ancient Jewish law, no more so than we're expected to abide by Hammurabi's Code. Hell, if we really wanted to look at it, as someone who lives in America, I'm not obligated to live by the laws of Djibouti unless I go there. It would be ridiculous to come up to me and say that American law is somehow lesser because I'm not from Djibouti, or vice versa. Babylonian law worked great for ancient Babylonian society, just like ancient Israelite law worked great for them. Neither is any more or less awesome than the other, and neither is any more or less relevant to today's society.\n\nBut there's something else to consider. The video implies that the Ten Commandments are the be-all, end-all of Jewish law, and that it's because of this that she can say it's less developed than Hammurabi's Code. Jewish law is a bit, shall we say, notorious for its meticulousness and recording of laws on every subject imaginable. There are entire books of the Torah - specifically Leviticus and Deuteronomy - that are largely devoted to laying down the law. There is an entire tradition of legal interpretation in Judaism. Saying that there is no \"developed\" Biblical law is a bit baffling, to be honest. While it did come substantially after Hammurabi's Code, that doesn't diminish the fact that it exists, and exists rather thoroughly.\n\nShe goes on:\n\n&gt; And what about monotheism? It actually comes from Egypt, centuries before Judaism. \n\nAgain, there's a lot to unpack in here. How are we defining \"before Judaism?\" Are we drawing a distinction between monotheism and monolatry? The lady in the video says that Akhenaten is the originator of monotheism, but that's not quite true for multiple reasons. First off, there's the obvious problem of Zoroastrianism. While we don't know exactly when Zoroaster lived, some of the dates proposed for his life are well before Akhenaten, meaning that the credit for earliest monotheism would have to go to him. More importantly, however, Zoroaster's teachings about Ahura Mazda are actually monotheistic (as long as you except the interpretation of Ahura Mazda as an entity rather than a collective consciousness) as opposed to Akhenaten's interactions with Aten and later Jewish interactions with Yahweh. Ahura Mazda, according to Zoroastrianism, is the only god, something which is similar to but still separate from Akhenaten's belief that Aten was supreme among the gods and the only god worth worshiping. Ancient Jewish beliefs, too, were monolatrous, with Yahweh being one of several Canaanite gods (hence the \"thou shalt have no other gods before me\" commandment). It's a fine distinction, but an important one. Monotheism didn't originate in Egypt. \n\nEven beyond that question, the question of where Judaism acquired monotheism is an interesting one. Being caught in the middle of great powers in the Near East, there are several routes by which monotheism could have been introduced to Judaism; however, we do get a clue about the evolution of Jewish religious belief by analysing the way God is named in the various books of the Old Testament. Throughout the Torah, for instance, God is a many-named entity, and is seen with other, similar entities, suggesting that Yahweh is not an only fella. Indeed, as I think I've pointed out before on this sub, early Israelite art depicts Yahweh with consorts like Ba'al, indicative of old polytheism and the way in which Canaanite religious groups interacted with each other. However, as we analyse the later writings of the prophets, particularly during and after the Babylonian Exile, the interaction with the nature of God changes. God becomes more singular, and focus shifts from \"no other gods\" to \"there are no other gods,\" much like Zoroastrian belief. Indeed, the most likely influence for Jewish monotheism is not, in fact, Egypt, but Zoroastrian beliefs acquired during the Babylonian Exile. Essentially, when the Babylonians exiled the social elite after conquering Jerusalem, these elites ingratiated themselves in Babylon. A result of this was them being influenced by the various beliefs they encountered, including Zoroastrian monotheism. Their ideas of Yahweh were shaped by the ideas of Ahura Mazda. What I always find interesting is the conflict that takes place in ancient Israel when the exiles return. Each group was left to form their own interpretation of the religion over the course of the exile with those remaining in ancient Israel sticking with monolatry. Within a few centuries of the exiles' return, that monolatry and any reference to other gods is gone, replaced by monotheism. It's an interesting development, and one with obvious consequences.\n\nReally, though, the idea of one god being more important than others isn't something that's unique to the ancient Near East, nor should Judaism be considered derivative for having it after some of its neighbours. We can find examples of some gods being considered better gods throughout the world and its history, and in many societies, monolatry was just a short step behind that. If saying that because monotheism is not unique to Judaism makes Judaism less legitimate is valid, then we might as well say that no religion is valid because all of it has some element that it found from its neighbour or that was influenced by someone else.\n\nWait. Shit.\n\n&gt; Easter and Christmas actually have pagan origins.\n\nPhew, I'm glad she moved on. Anyway, this is another bit where she's telling the sort of truth. How these holidays are celebrated has been greatly influenced by the culture they're in, absolutely. There's still nothing wrong with that, and nothing less legitimate about the holiday simply because of how it's celebrated. However, to take Easter as an example, what the holiday actually *is* is substantially more than how it's celebrated. Easter is heavily influenced by Passover and the Jewish calendar, and largely reflects the fact that these holidays were deeply significant for Jesus and in Jesus' life. Easter is completely rooted in the resurrection and the time leading up to it, the single most important part of Christianity. Some of the most interesting parts of the development of the modern Christian calendar were enacted specifically because of needing to make Easter work on a theological level, and needing the dates to line up with the lunar calendar. Does Easter derive some aspects of how it's celebrated from other cultures? Sure, but once again, the ability of something to be culturally flexible doesn't make it any less legitimate.\n\n&gt; There is no historical or archaeological evidence to prove the exodus from Egypt or the ten plagues.\n\nShe can have the exodus. I'm not contesting that. It's the Plagues that I'm interested in. See, the problem here is that there is evidence that bad stuff happened in Egypt. Bad stuff *always* happens in places. Some of the bad stuff resembles what's listed in Exodus as being part of the plagues, like darkness and fire and too many frogs, can also be found in Egyptian records, albeit long before the exodus supposedly took place. \n\nAs an example, we know there was a massive volcanic eruption around 1500 BCE on the island of Thera, north of Crete. Cultures throughout the Mediterranean wrote about its devastation, and archaeological evidence found on places like Santorini attests to the ferocity and devastation of the eruption. It was, by all accounts, the sort of thing that would leave an impact on the collective memory of the area, and almost certainly did. It's also the sort of thing that would produce flaming hail and darkness as well as crop failures and all sorts of other nasty things that people usually attribute to someone ticking off the wrong god. The same holds true with the plagues having to do with the Nile - there is lots of evidence that the Nile suffered from algal blooms that would deoxygenate the river, causing die-offs and an abundance of things people didn't want in their yards, like frogs and biting flies. \n\nNow, is there proof that these things happened in the way described in Exodus? Nope. Does that mean the whole thing is bunk? Also nope. The plagues described in Exodus could have happened, and events that inspired them almost certainly happened. This is partly how we look at texts like the Bible in a historical way - we don't take them at face value, but when they're corroborated by other texts that present an interesting story that's similar, it suggests there may be some truth to it. We have no evidence that the exodus took place like Exodus says, but there are almost certainly truthful elements to it, like volcanoes and frog plagues.\n\n&gt; The stories of the Bible began as an oral tradition.\n\nI skipped about a minute of the video to go to this bit, so my apologies. This bit and the entire section about the development of the Bible matters because it gets to the heart of a bit of a superiority complex, namely, that oral tradition can't tell history. It's something that I see being as Eurocentric as saying that the Sumerians were the sole inventors of writing - it's basically looking at other cultures and how they communicate their history and saying it's inferior. The lady in the video compares oral traditions to a game of telephone, but the reality is much more complex. \n\nTake the Iliad, for instance. The Iliad is loaded with repetition of the same phrase after a character does something, says something, dies, or just shows up and has their name mentioned. There's a couple of reasons behind this - it fits better in a verse, for one - but for our purposes, the most important reason is the fact that this repetition makes the poem easier to memorise. Unlike a game of Telephone, the point of being an oral storyteller is not to half-ass the story and give it your best shot, but rather to tell it as accurately and completely as possible. In the ancient world, especially, memorisation was serious business, and telling something accurately was essential. One example of this is the tradition of Vedic chant memorisation. While I can't find the exact video I want, some groups have a tradition of making it a great honour to be able to memorise chants, something which boys are required to do. Thousands and thousands of words of the chants are memorised exactly, and then passed down from generation to generation. This is not unique to Hinduism, either. Islam, for example, sees Quranic memorisation as something to be honoured. Storytellers in the ancient world memorised the stories they wanted to tell, and while there would be more variation than with religious memorisation, the stories would remain essentially the same. \n\nI'm not going to pretend that these chants have gone on entirely unchanged. Of course they haven't. However, oral traditions are a far cry from a game of Telephone because of their importance to the people that participate in them. \n\n&gt; And don't even get me started on the King James version of the Bible, the one that everyone considers to be the authorised version. When they did the translation, they didn't even bother to go back to the oldest known copies of the manuscripts. They just translated from other modern versions at the time.\n\nActually, one of the big problems with the King James version is that they didn't rely on contemporary translations. The King James translators relied on the Septuagint as their translation for the Old Testament. The Septuagint was the Greek translation of the Torah translated by people who didn't actually know how to speak Hebrew all that well, but really wanted Hellenised Jews to be able to read the Torah. The King James Bible relies on this version, and as a result, leaves some parts of the Torah out completely. Other contemporary versions don't do this.\n\nThe video is only half done, but at this point, she mostly stops with history (or, more specifically, I'm not sure critiquing her arguments about the development of the Trinity is worth it), so I'll stop too. What I see the point of the video being, though, is that her arguments are essentially rooted in misunderstandings of how to view a text in a historical context, and how development and change doesn't delegitimise that text. To be clear, it's not my intention to take a stand about her beliefs, nor do I have any interest in doing so. However, there are ways to critique that are more aware of history and how historical context works. This is not one of those ways.\n\nSources!\n\n[The full text of Hammurabi's Code](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/ancient/hamframe.asp). I recommend giving it a read.

        "text": "[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ztOV2wrrkY). Just... just watch it. I don't know where to start with it. When I told my husband I was writing a post about it, [this](http://i.imgur.com/I3aFESa.png) is the conversation we had. I don't understand this video. I don't understand why it exists, what it's point is, or even what it's trying to say. I think it's supposed to be a joke, but if that's the case, it's so awful that I can't even tell it's meant to be funny. Digging around, the video's creator is German, so maybe it's German humour? It's my experience that German humour is pretty weird if you're not German, so I think this is going to have to be the explanation. But still, I'm looking at the video and I just...what to say? So I'll do what I always do. I'll latch tenaciously on to one particular aspect of the video while sticking my fingers in my ears and going \"LA LA LA\" at everything else. It's also the only way to actually watch a video like this.\n\nLet's look at [this bit](https://youtu.be/4ztOV2wrrkY) in which Otto of the bright yellow font is having a chat with Martin Luther about whether or not he (Otto) is like unto a god with him (Martin Luther) saying that the two of them have wildly differing views about what God is. While there are distinct differences between Catholic and Protestant theology, their actual view of what God is and God's nature isn't drastically different. Also, Otto and Martin Luther could never have had a conversation about God - Otto died in 973, and Martin Luther wasn't born until 1483, but to be honest, I'm not sure anyone actually cares about that aspect of it.\n\nTo be fair to the video's creator, of two people who could possibly be at odds with each other over their mutual interpretations of the Church and its role in life, these are two very good ones to go with. To start with, let's look at Martin Luther's theology of the Two Kingdoms, one of the bases of his idea of what the Church should be. In Lutheran thought, God's reign over Earth is total, that is to say that God has control over Earth. However, he rules it in two ways, and with respect to two aspects. The first is the spiritual aspect and what people choose to voluntarily do, such as committing to the church and taking communion and all that. God rules this through spiritual methods. The second aspect is the physical world, which God rules through secular government and through the laws spelled out in the Bible. However, God is still ultimately in control of the secular world, and is the final decider and arbiter of it. Secular authorities have no real authority to grant or limit access to religious texts because that's God's domain, not theirs. Equally, secular authorities are not free to use the Church to their own ends because, once again, that power belongs to God. \n\nCompare this to Otto I, who, as he consolidated power, moved towards presenting himself as a grand protector of the Church, and someone who ruled with divine authority. In a way, yes, he saw himself as more holy than other people, or at least more favoured by God, though it's a far stretch to say that he then also thought of himself as a god. However, Otto did blend together Church and secular authority, making clergy his vassals, and granting secular titles to clergymen who did what he said and supported him against hostile nobility. It meant that for the clergy who had been currying favour with Otto, being a priest came second to being nobility, exactly the sort of thing Martin Luther would rail against 500 years later. In essence, if the two of them did meet and start discussing theology, they would likely disagree about how God ruled the world, and what the human relationship to the spiritual would be. \n\nHowever, there's a distinct difference between talking about a *method* of God and a *definition* of God, and it's here that the video is spectacularly wrong (well, not just here, but remember - LA LA LA). While Catholics and Protestants disagree about a great many things, they are still both Christians, and they agree on what God is. They agree that there is a Holy Trinity, and Jesus, and that Jesus is super-special-awesome. These are the basic tenets of Christianity. Even within the more nitty-gritty aspects, Catholics and Protestants tend to agree on what God *is* - inasmuch as that's something that either of them claim - while disagreeing on how best to approach this being. Martin Luther, for all his disagreement with Otto about putting secular authority in with the clergy, would agree with Otto on what God is and how much Otto is not one. \n\n...LA LA LA.",

In followup comments he expands upon his position with well...more bad politics and history.\n\n&gt;There seems to be no question that [Mussolini] is really interested in what we are doing and I am much interested and deeply impressed by what he has accomplished and by his evidenced honest purpose of restoring Italy.\"\nComment in early 1933 about Benito Mussolini to US Ambassador to Italy Breckinridge Long, as quoted in Three New Deals : Reflections on Roosevelt's America, Mussolini's Italy, and Hitler's Germany, 1933-1939 (2006) by Wolfgang Schivelbusch, p. 31.\n\nHe starts with this rather famous comment that often gets thrown around when discussing FDR and fascism (a very popular idea in the internet anarchist community from what I have seen). The problem with this quote isn't that its false, but rather it lacks any sort of context. The date of this quote is 1933, really close to FDR's inauguration. FDR and Mussolini had an interesting relationship, they had established contact before FDR's election victory. They both saw each other as being important to future schemes. Mussolini saw America's economy and economic investment as being important for Europe (and thus Italy's) future economic recovery. For FDR's part he saw Mussolini as being an important guaranteer of peace in Europe. When FDR started his new deal program, Mussolini proudly trumpeted that it was a copying of Mussolini's own economic policies (something FDR's conservative opponents jumped on to use as ammo against the new president, but more on this later) but historians have since concluded that the New Deal was not really similar to Mussolini's economic system. As historian of fascism Stanley Payne says in his book *A history of fascism: 1914-1945*:\n\n&gt;What Fascist corporatism and the New Deal had in common was a certain amount of state\nintervention in the economy. Beyond that, the only figure who seemed to look on Fascist corporatism\nas a kind of model was Hugh Johnson, head of the National Recovery Administration. F.Perkins,\n\nThis sentiment is echoed by further historians and economists like Mises, who argued that FDR's New Deal had more in common with Bismarck's social programs, and historian William Leuchtenburg who compared the New Deal to Scandinavian programs. \n\n&gt;e. And I'm sure here come the downvotes. This thread is already so heavily brigaded and maniuplated, it's no surprise.\n\nOf course the comment is upvoted, but we will just ignore that. \n\nNow the user in question is asked to provide examples of FDR's fascist tendencies, and the badhistory continues.\n\n&gt;limiting free speech?\n\n&gt;&gt;Interning citizens was a great example of his disregard of US citizens' life and property.\nAdditionally, he set up the flagrantly named Office of Censorship.[1]\n\nSo while this is true and examples of FDR limiting freedoms. They both came about during a war, and not just any war, but the biggest and arguably one of the most important wars in human history. The goal was not necessarily to crack down on freedom of expression and dissidents so much as it was to ensure the war effort and the safety of the country. Robert Paxton in his book *The Anatomy of Fascism* discusses this phenomenon:\n\n&gt;Fascist radicalization was not simply war government, moreover.\nMaking war radicalizes all regimes, fascist or not, of course. All states\ndemand more of their citizens in wartime, and citizens become more\nwilling, if they believe the war is a legitimate one, to make exceptional\nsacrifices for the community, and even to set aside some of their liberties.\nIncreased state authority seems legitimate when the enemy is at the gate.\nDuring World War II, citizens of the democracies accepted not only\nmaterial sacrifices, like rationing and the draft, but also major limitations\non freedom, such as censorship. In the United States during the cold war\nan insistent current of opinion wanted to limit liberties again, in the interest\nof defeating the communist enemy\n\nHitler and Mussolini both moved very early on to establish varying levels of censorship on cultural and political mediums. Mussolini first established censorship in late 1925, and severely turned it up in 1926 after attempts on his life. Hitler's seizure of power was marked by an almost immediate attack on \"anti-German\" cultural works like music, art, etc. Not to mention Goebbels strict control over the press and what sort of articles could be written. \n\nFurthermore, looking closely at the actual censorship undertaken by the Office of Censorship, shows it was quite radically different from what one could expect from a fascist system of censorship. Most of it relates to sensitive war information, and it was quickly proven why that type of censorship was needed because during the famous \"May incident\" a US congressmen accidentally revealed that Japanese depth charges weren't able to properly attack US subs, the Japanese picked this up and altered their depth charges to be much more deadly. \n\nFinally, there is an inherent issue with using government politics during a crisis to try and label any regime. Under this person's definition, one could label Lincoln a fascist for his attacks on wartime dissenters, Churchill during WWII could also get the same treatment. And really just about any WWI politician. \n\n&gt;To me FDR was a socialist, which does not guarantee he was a fascist.\n\n&gt;&gt;FDR gets labeled a socialist, and certainly he had lots of leftist sentiments. Socialists, for their many many flaws, at least allegedly want the common person enfranchised and empowered. FDR was all about \"the rule of the enlightened.\"\n\nIts kind of hard to rebuke this with such a well general statement. What exactly does \"rule of the enlightened\" mean? FDR was no commoner for sure, he came from and old family that had already produced one president and several other politicians/businessman. But how that relates to FDR and fascism, I have no idea.\n\n&gt;It's [fascism] authoritarian first and foremost in all of the policies it outlines. Sure, there's talk about private ownership and profit motives, but it has the state literally own these means of production. It's this disgusting hybrid of \"sure, work hard, but only if it's for the greater good.\" \n\nYes fascism was initially conceived as a \"third way\" between Capitalism and Socialism. And thus this leads to what is called \"corporatism.\" Now Corporatism isn't rule by corporation, rather it was an attempt by the Fascists to find a third way between Capitalism and Socialism. Part of Fascism's appeal is that put itself forward as a third way. So those who were violently opposed to Socialism/Communism but also distrustful/angry at capitalism could find a home in fascism. \n\nSo the idea with corporatism was to solve the issues created by capitalism, but without driving into Socialism/Communism. For example Fascists were utterly opposed to trade unions and Socialism, but they also realized that modern capitalism, with its excesses and flaws created a perfect breeding ground for those movements to pop up. Mussolini outlines this in his doctrine of fascism; which is relatively short and worth a read:\n\n&gt;When brought within the orbit of the State, Fascism recognizes the real needs which gave rise to socialism and trade unionism, giving them due weight in the guild or corporative system in which divergent interests are coordinated and harmonized in the unity of the State\n\nBut that doesn't mean capitalism and fascism couldn't work together, and in fact they did. To quote Robert Paxton:\n\n&gt;Even at its most radical, however, fascists’\nanticapitalist rhetoric was selective. While they denounced speculative\ninternational finance (along with all other forms of internationalism,\ncosmopolitanism, or globalization—capitalist as well as socialist), they\nrespected the property of national producers, who were to form the social\nbase of the reinvigorated nation.40 When they denounced the bourgeoisie,\nit was for being too flabby and individualistic to make a nation\nstrong, not for robbing workers of the value they added. What they criticized\nin capitalism was not its exploitation but its materialism, its indifference\nto the nation, its inability to stir souls.41 More deeply, fascists\nrejected the notion that economic forces are the prime movers of history.\nFor fascists, the dysfunctional capitalism of the interwar period did not\nneed fundamental reordering; its ills could be cured simply by applying\nsufficient political will to the creation of full employment and productivity.\nOnce in power, fascist regimes confiscated property only from political\nopponents, foreigners, or Jews. None altered the social hierarchy,\n\nNow this only applies to Italy, Nazi Germany was a different case. The Nazi party always had its fair share of radicals who wanted to take the revolution further and can be characterized as anti-capitalist. Led by Gottfried Feder and Otto Wagener this faction launched attacks on German department stores and other businesses. But they were brought under control by the Nazis and the Nazis moved to smooth relations and work with German industry. Nazi economics minister Hjalmar Schacht sought to work with private enterprises and big businesses to facilitate German rearmament. But after Schacht fell out of favour (for speaking against Nazi dreams of autarky and cautioning against rapid rearmament) the Nazis did begin to subvert the independence of German industry (especially under the 4 year plan of Herman Goering), but they didn't necessarily harm private industries either. IG Farben saw a 70% increase in profits under the new Nazi system, and other companies like Daimler Benz also saw massive profit increases. Likewise private insurance companies controlled upwards of 85% of all the insurance business in Nazi Germany. \n\nSo while Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy weren't pure capitalists, to dismiss the capitalist parts of their regimes by saying they only \"payed lip service\" is an absurd statement. \n\n&gt; The user then throws up some \"tenants of fascism\" by first linking to[ this article](http://www.rense.com/general37/fascism.htm) from rense. And then thinking better of it and linking to [this section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definitions_of_fascism#John_T._Flynn) of wikipedia.\n \nNeither are good definitions, nor are they good attempts at linking FDR to fascism. \n\nThe first one I won't event justify with a rebutall because its from rense (loony/psuedo-conspiracy site). But the issue with the John T. Flynn is that it was written as a political work. As I said before opponents had been accusing Roosevelt of fascism since he took office; from both right and left. And Flynn certainly falls into that category being a conservative opponent of FDR. Even using Flynn's definition, it doesn't apply to FDR, or really anybody but Mussolini and to some extent Hitler.\n\nAnyways here are the first 6 bullet points that \"define fascism\" according to the rense article (I know I said I wouldn't deal with it, but the poster in question based the rest of his argument off of it so I feel I need to deal with it)\n\n&gt;*  Powerful and Continuing Nationalism\n\n&gt;* Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights \n\n&gt;* Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause\n\n&gt;*  Supremacy of the Military \n\n&gt;* Rampant Sexism\n\n&gt;*  Controlled Mass Media\n\nAs you can probably already tell, these are absolutely awful characteristics to define fascism by.\n\nNow here is the poster's attempts to show that FDR was in fact a fascist via these 6 characteristics:\n\n&gt;1) War propaganda is well recognized.\n\n&gt;2) Internment of Japanese citizens.\n\n&gt;3) Combat against both the rich, the Germans, and the Japanese.\n\n&gt;4) Military funding, conscription, and so forth.\n\n&gt;5) FDR was no friend to gay people. He cheated on his marriage and was estranged from his powerful, intelligent wife.\n\n&gt;6) His usage of radio and grassroots activism was revolutionary. \n\nOkay, lets take this point by point.\n\n&gt;1) War propaganda is well recognized.\n\nRight off the bat this relates to the earlier points I brought up about wartime policies. While the Western democracies made heavy use of propaganda in WWII, it was wartime propaganda intended to stimulate the war effort. Compared with the two fascist regimes of Italy/Germany we see that they made constant use of propaganda in peace time to target subversives, minorities, political dissidents, or just to stimulate populist support for a new measure. Pretty much every nation has made use of propaganda in wartime in the modern era, its hardly a helpful indicator of fascism.\n\n&gt;2) Internment of Japanese citizens.\n\nAgain this brings back the problem of wartime policies. The interment of the Japanese was a wartime measure based off a perceived threat, same with the wartime interment of Italians. Comparing FDR's interment with the interment practised by Nazi Germany, you see that Nazi Germany made heavy use of internment to attack political dissidents, Jews, etc. Likewise with Italy when they took a more radical approach to Jews/dissidents/etc. after 1943. Although attacks and imprisonment of dissidents was certainly present beforehand. \n\nFurthermore, using FDR's internment of Japanese as proof of his \"disdain for human rights\" is ludicrous.  It ignores the positive aspects that FDR implemented to help further human rights in the USA to help people (new deal), as well as his attempt to implement a Second Bill of Rights. In the international sphere FDR pioneered the Atlantic Charter, which worked towards self determination and international cooperation, hardly fascist sentiments.\n\n&gt;3) Combat against both the rich, the Germans, and the Japanese.\n\nFDR hardly targeted the rich as \"enemies\"; hardly comparable to the fascist attacks on their enemies. The other two have been covered under the previous discussions on wartime politics vs peacetime policies.\n\n&gt;4) Military funding, conscription, and so forth.\n\nAgain the United States undertook these mass military funding measures in the run up to a war. The American military on the onset of WWII was pitiful, the Navy obviously was more powerful due to American security needs in the Pacific/Atlantic. \n\nComparing American military buildup with Fascist military buildup shows the stark differences. The Nazis bankrupted themselves trying to rearm and establish an army that could dominate Europe. Mussolini built a huge fleet/modern airforce/and increasingly expanded the army and actively sough conquests such as Ethiopia. \n\n&gt;5) FDR was no friend to gay people. He cheated on his marriage and was estranged from his powerful, intelligent wife.\n\nThis point makes no sense, FDR cheating on his wife is hardly a sign of rampant government sexism which is in of itself hardly a sign of fascism. Now obviously fascist states did try and encourage a stay at home mother image for their women, especially Nazi Germany. But just using the blanket term \"sexism\" isn't helpful in this regard. \n\n&gt;6) His usage of radio and grassroots activism was revolutionary\n\nTrue, but I don't see how this is evident of FDR's \"control of the mass media.\" Even during wartime American intervention in the media never approached the standards set by Mussolini or Gobbles' propaganda ministry. \n\nIf you're interested in sources on fascism, I recommend:  \n\n*The Anatomy of Fascism* by Robert Paxton\n\n*A History of Fascism: 1914-1945* by Stanley Payne\n\n*Italian Fascism 1915-1945 and Fascism in Europe 1919-1945* by Philip Morgan\n\n*Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany: The Fascist Style of Rule* by Alexander DeGrand",

        "text": "This is the actual title of a thread in /r/TiAdiscussion: https://np.reddit.com/r/TiADiscussion/comments/3hcpqc/are_sjws_a_factor_in_the_rise_of_nazism_in_europe/\n\nOP claims that because the radical left was the only viable alternative to Nazism in 1930's Germany then people who were spooked by SJWs were forced to choose Hitler. It's upvoted and most posters seem to agree with him. I think there's a reason why OP decided to submit this question to a historically illiterate circlejerk like TiA rather than to an actual history-related subreddit.\n\nFirst of all, you need to define SJW. How do you define a Social Justice Warrior? No idea. I've seen people who happen to be part of a minority being referred to as SJW just because they won't support bigotry against their own minority. But whatever definition you choose, comparing 1930's Communists and Social-Democrats to tumblr activists of today? Really? I don't mean to try and denigrate either group, it's just that they're so different. They work on completely different fields, first of all, the former in parliament and trade unions, and the latter is disparate activists operating on their own on the internet, and second their ideologies and the issues at hand are too different to compare the two. I mean, OP gives an example of so-called 'SJWs' calling people who are against refugees racists to show how the radical left is supposedly alienating people and pushing them to the right. The comments agree on that, and to give further proof that SJWs were a factor in the rise of Nazism they mention the popularity of Donald Trump in the GOP, or Marine Le Pen's successful attempts to appeal to gay people, or how silly it is for leftists today to defend Islam etc. but none of those were issues in 1930's Germany. You can't use those as examples of the left pushing people to the right in 1930's Germany because they are **modern examples**. It's like they aren't even trying to answer OP's question, they're just trying to create complicity between SJWs and Nazis by conflating SJWs today with radical leftists of the past, and right-wingers today with Nazis, and then come to the conclusion that the developments of today must also be relevant to 1930's Germany.\n\nAlso, even if you can actually compare modern so-called 'SJWs' with Communists and Social-Democrats in the 1930's, it's hardly that the left being too radical was what pushed Germans right anyway. There were other social and cultural developments, the general weakening of the nation-state; perceptions of a growingly 'decadent' culture; a loss of national moral and pride; etc. which pushed people to the right. But unless you subscribe to Nazi ideology and think these were all actually a Judeo-Bolshevik conspiracy, then you can't really blame the left in those developments, therefore the left didn't 'push' anyone to the right using objectionable ideals.

        "text": "\nI subscribe to r/catholicism, sometimes to read neat discussions from my co-religionists and sometimes^mostly to read awful ones. The basis of the original discussion is debating\nexactly how Satanic Islam actually is, so guess which kind this is. But that's probably more badreligion  and I'm just looking at history, so let's start off with a [bit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/3h7fju/northern_ireland_pastor_to_be_prosecuted_for/cu5cvtu) about European Catholics:\n\n&gt; Except for when they conquer natives, burn heretics etc, right?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the response:\n\n&gt; Oh please, not this whiny shit. The Aztec Empire deserved everything it got, and their neighbors fought with the Spanish for a reason. \nIf it weren't for \"colonialism\", 20,000 hearts a year would still be ripped out on the altar at Tenochtitlan. Furthermore, unlike their \n\"enlightened\" WASP neighbors, \nthe French and Spanish were much less racist and abolished slavery, complete with a papal excommunication of all involved with the slave trade.\nThe execution of heretics was not the desperate flailing of an institution with something to hide, it was the suppression of social revolutionary movements that tore societies apart. The Albigensians and Hussites weren't innocent victims being crusaded for no other reason than unorthodoxy. Learn some history.\n\n\nMaybe I just have terrible reading comprehension, but I interpreted the juxtaposition of the first statements to mean that other native city-states fought alongside the Spanish against Moctezuma due to the \"reason\" of being horrified with human sacrifice. \nI was always under the impression that the main motivating factor for the city-states was their own particular political goals and quarrels with other\ncities. For example, in two fantastic posts [both](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2qjnyo/should_it_mexico_accept_the_historical_record/)\nu/Ahuatl and u/anthropology_nerd [explain](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2r3svv/myths_of_conquest_part_two_invisible_allies/) how\nthe city of Tlaxcala used the Spanish to help in their conflicts with Cholula and eventually Tenochtitlan, and [apparently](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ixtlilxochitl_II)\nTexcoco turned against its ally Tenochtitlan due to Moctezuma's interference in a succession crisis (this is also mentioned in Richard Townsend's *The Aztecs*).\nThe original argument seems especially strange because the Nahua were far from the only group in the area to use human sacrifice. Kevin Terracino mentions Mixtec\n[human sacrifice](https://books.google.com/books?id=fmm1wDA5_JwC&amp;pg=PA272&amp;lpg=PA272&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yZjPmg_biH&amp;sig=aqPrdnc80EgOAcqNtLC8VKf-L4M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAmoVChMIi7KwmrewxwIVUKKICh0IegH5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)\nin *The Mixtecs of Colonial Oaxaca*, Bernardino Verástique [describes](https://books.google.com/books?id=8Q3UAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hgWAfw3q-H&amp;sig=H7cYG_xSbyiO-VkXuw6zu5Bh4gw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBmoVChMI_NyPqbiwxwIVTTOICh2k4Qzh#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)\nPurhepecha human sacrifice in *Michoacán and Eden*, and [here](http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/maya/maya-zapotec.pdf) is a paper that talks about \nsacrifice of captives in Zapotec cultures. Like I said I might just be missing something, but I don't really see what human sacrifice has to do with various indigenous polities fighting Tenochtitlan, or what \nany of that has to do with the judgment that the \"Aztec Empire deserved everything it got\". \n\nFor the \"20,000 hearts a year\", u/Ahuatl also made a [wonderful](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2xacnu/why_did_mesoamericans_sacrifice_people_and_why/cozu528)\nseries of comments a few months ago going through the math of Aztec human sacrifice and the discrepancy between the archaeological evidence and the written\naccounts, where among other things it's mentioned that even 20,000 a year might be rather high. To be really pedantic, I could also mention that the 20,000 a \nyear estimate was for the entire empire, and that Tenochtitlan had multiple temples with multiple altars, so even the singular \"20,000 hearts a year on the altar at Tenochtitlan\" isn't\nquite accurate.\n\nFor the \"much less racist\" bit, I don't know how you'd go about comparing the racism of European empires, but I'm not really sure that the Spain that created the [casta system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casta)\nto judge people based on their color and ancestry and the France that [kicked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Guadeloupe#Pre-Columbian_and_Colonial_Settlement) the [Caribs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carib_Expulsion)\noff their own islands really deserve that much credit. In addition, while Spain at least did abolish slavery for native Americans in the 16th century, there was still a lot [draft labor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repartimiento), so again, meh?\nAlso, I like that we're just not even mentioning Portugal and the [bandeirantes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandeirantes) who openly captured Native Americans \nas slaves. Or that apparently Aztec human sacrifice is justification for all colonialism ever. And that we're ignoring the imperialism of Catholic powers in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in Africa, Asia, and Oceania. Or that apparently Africans don't count as real people,\nor else I have no idea how anyone could talk about France and Spain ending slavery and the slave trade. \n\nUnfortunately I know basically nothing about Albigensians, Hussites, and the treatment of heretics, so I'm not going to pretend to offer any historical critique. \n\nMoving on, further down thread we have [this map](http://www.bookwormroom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Muslim-conquest-v-Crusade-battles.jpg) which baffles me. \nWhat is the \"Muslim Conquest\"? Are they talking about the [Rashidun and Umayyad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_conquests) conquests of the 7th and 8th centuries?\nBecause then why are there so many dots around Hungary and Austria and the Balkans - those seem more Ottoman-y. How is the map-maker defining battles such \nthat there are there so many dots around Europe and Palestine,\nbut virtually nothing in North Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia? According to this map they literally just walked into Afghanistan and faced no \nresistance whatsoever ([they didn't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_conquest_of_Afghanistan)). Are we just deciding that any skirmish by any king or bandit who happened to be Muslim now counts as part of a  \"Muslim Conquest\"? Why are we \ncollapsing history and motives all together for Muslims, but then restricting the Christian side to Crusades? And why are we leaving out so much of the Crusades - \nlike the First Crusade battles when King Colman of Hungary fought the armies of Emich and Gottschalk because he didn't want them to enter his country and massacre Jewish people, or\nthe Second Crusade and the Conquest of Lisbon, or the Third Crusade and the [Conquest of Cyprus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_I_of_England#Conquest_of_Cyprus), or the [Fourth Crusade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Crusade) and everything about it, \nor the Crusades against Egypt getting collapsed into one dot even though they were fought in different places, or the Crusades against Tunis, or the Northern Crusades, or the Reconquista, or that one random crusade against [Aragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aragonese_Crusade).\nI mean, yeah, it's true, there won't be a lot of battles if you just choose to ignore like 90% of them. \n\nHere are some other relevant sources that I didn't mention above:\n\n*Imagining Identity in New Spain* by Magali Carrera about the casta paintings and race in Spanish America\n\n*City Indians in Spain's American Empire* by Velasco Murillo et al. talks about the repartimiento draft labor system in various places \n\n*The First Crusade* by Steven Runciman for the bit about King Colman of Hungary\n\n*The Northern Crusades* by Eric Christiansen about the Northern Crusades and various other vaguely-religious expeditions in North-East Europe\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a historian, so if I misinterpreted the original comments or wrote some bad history of my own, then please be brutal!\n\nEDIT: I see there's been a lot of discussion about the source video for the map, and to be honest I had no idea\nthe map originally came from a video (in my defense there wasn't a whole lot of context in the original comment). I wanted to thank /u/shlin28 for [linking](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3hd34x/crusades_and_colonies_in_rcatholicism/cu6e3gz) to the original source video and for also [showing me](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2v7alt/given_the_recent_uptick_in_jihad_versus_crusade/) a fantastic discussion about the video on AskHistorians - so thank you very much, I really appreciate it!

        "text": "Welcome to my first /r/badhistory post. It's been a pretty rough week so I'm blowing off some steam by venting white-hot history-pedantry at John Green's treatment of [The Odyssey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MS4jk5kavy4). We will all have to keep in mind that this is a literature review rather than a historical one, so he will be getting a wee bit of extra slack, but as it is a historical text of great historical significance to both the history of Ancient Greece and to the West at large, any slack I'm going to grant for it being a literature review is going to be few and far between.\n\nBefore I begin in earnest, I'm writing this at 1:30 in the morning, so please forgive any missteps in grammar/spelling until I can edit this with a brain that's had more sleep.\n\nOur first bit of bad history comes in at [2:05](https://youtu.be/MS4jk5kavy4?t=2m5s) in the video. Green claims that there were a lot of other Greek texts writing about the Trojan War, with Homer's being the most popular. This is true, however, he commits a grievous error by claiming that Homer's was the only one to survive the burning of the Library of Alexandria. Classic bad history here already, and it has to follow with my pedantry. The statement is unverifiable, but for it to be true, there would have to be only one copy of each Trojan War poem in the library. Nowhere else in the world. This has been touched on a *lot* here, in pretty much every Classical /r/badhistory thread (to the point where it's a home grown dank meme here) so I'll go light on it, but suffice to say, the idea that Alexandria contained every single book in the ancient world is beyond laughable, and to attribute the burning of the library to the loss of every single poem is stupid. The lost Trojan War poems were lost the way other things were lost. Through time and neglect accumulated over the centuries. You'd only need to look at Sappho and what happened to her works to grasp how literature is lost to time. You could write miles of ink on how texts become lost, but we'll leave this segment here for now and move onto the next.\n\nNext Green mentions at [4:21](https://youtu.be/MS4jk5kavy4?t=4m21s) that the themes of The Odyssey are double standards for women, and if you can break a cycle of violence - *the former is a doozy.* \n\nWe'll ignore the interpretation that the Iliad and The Odyssey is a cycle of violence, because though I disagree with it, it's a literature review and it's valid enough - even though I'd argue that to the *Greek* mind hearing it, it's hardly a cycle, but Fates and the literal wills of the gods.\n\nHowever Green does not get a pass for what comes next: Assigning 21st century thoughts on gender and sexuality onto an 8thC BC poem. The whole video is passably ok, as you can expect from a 12 minute video on the internet about a topic people have been discussing for literally thousands of years. But at [6:50](https://youtu.be/MS4jk5kavy4?t=6m50s) he goes off on this bizarre semi-rant about how unfair Homer's treatment of women within his works is and how the patriarchy keeps them down. It's ridiculous. Of course the patriarchy keeps them down, it's almost like this text was written 2,800 years ago or something in a society run by men! Who woulda thought it doesn't share modern thoughts on gender equality! Wow! Can we get a Nobel prize here?\n\nSexual double standards are to be expected for this period and this culture. It's not acceptable to us now because of our own historical context, but it is for the ancient Greeks.\n\nThe issue is that Green's thesis is committing the deadliest sin of historiography. ***Ignoring historical context*** and judging other cultures and societies based on modern ethical/cultural values. Be they of any stripe. Progressive, conservative, centrist, Tory, Whig, whatever. He's using this text as a soapbox because it's convenient for him. The fact he's pushing an agenda isn't the problem - it's ignoring the fact that these things - slut shaming, sexual double standards, the desire and clash of virginity and virility - were widely accepted in Greek culture, but forging ahead and judging them in a masterclass of 'how not to build a society'.\n\nThe crux of everything wrong here is that it's not so much that he's spouting torrents of bad history that we've seen in many other posts here, he's leaving voids that attract bad history to fill it like the fillings of shitty gritty coffee-cream chocolate things you get in gift boxes on Valentines Day for a disappointed SO. The fact he's not asking questions about it is his other cardinal sin. He's not asking questions like \"what kind of society favours this narrative and by extent, this characterisation of women? What does that tell us about the structure of that culture?\" Instead, it's attracting the neckbeards in the Youtube comments asking *entirely* different questions. (For the love of your liver please don't read them.) People are filling in blanks he's left as an open void. Those questions above are all really interesting ones to ask. Especially when we consider that the works of Homer are as indispensable to the ancient Greeks as the Bible is to modern Europe. I cannot imagine a Europe without Christianity, and for those of you not in Classics, imagining the Greek world without Homer is just as impossible. It's just that much of an indelible part of the Greco ancient world. The thing that pisses me off, on a personal and professional level, is that he's ignored the questions, the historical context, the cultural importance to the West, pushed past it all like a footballer running headlong into a goal where he can score a touchdown for his own agenda. He's not the first nor the last, but you can't do it to Homer when I'm around because I get grumpy and write long reddit posts about it. It's a subtle, insidious bit of bad history because it lets other bad history about these works grow. The misogynistic Youtube comment cesspit I asked you not to read is a perfect example of this.\n\nIt's easy to write the whole video off as a literature review, and handwave and go 'well, that's like, your opinion man,' and it's been difficult to pick where to fight battles with the points made. But it's just so shameless I can't give it a pass.",

Between writing reviews, debating their merits, and occasionally writing bad history posts, you'd think I'd have had enough. \n\nBut then I see a scene like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zg63b2m2_lE) that so thoroughly misrepresents London's history and architecture that I have to do something before I implode. It's wrong, and yet an entire generation could be deluded by it. \n\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince lies about history.\n\nI know - it shocked me too. But as this intro clearly shows, the Harry Potter series plays fast and loose with history and its depiction. It's a chronic problem, and this scene highlights that better than any other.\n\n...I've been told that it's not obvious what I'm on about, so let me clarify. Perhaps you noticed [this shot](http://i.imgur.com/sXdlMT3.png). It's a nice shot with a good view across the Millennium Bridge and towards St. Paul's. There's just one problem. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince takes place in 1996. The Millennium Bridge didn't open until 2000, as might be indicated by its name. \n\nActually, what's kind of amusing about the scene is that, while the bridge did open in 2000, it wobbled alarmingly, causing it to be closed again for further construction for another two years. It seems almost ironic, given how the bridge is destroyed in the scene. Certainly the earliest there would have been that many people on the bridge would have been 2002.\n\nI can see your skepticism, though. How, after all, can I know the date of a children's fantasy film? Well, beyond the fact that it's mentioned in the books (please don't make me cite which one) what year this story takes place, we can also reference other films to find out. [This](http://i.imgur.com/n7MJAUR.jpg) image, for instance, is taken from the next film in the series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. It has a clear date for when Harry's parents died - 1981. This means that Harry Potter was born in 1980 according to the films' chronology, and therefore that the bridge - which is destroyed when Harry is 16 - is being claimed to have been in London in 1996. The bridge wasn't there to be destroyed in 1996, meaning this is bad history. \n\nNow, once again, you could claim that Harry Potter takes place in an alternate universe, but as a girl who grew up with the generation of die-hard Harry Potter fans (but who definitely didn't go to midnight releases, trivia nights, or costume contests, that would just be ridiculous), I can definitively say that Hogwarts is definitely a real place to which I will receive a letter of invitation at some point in my life. \n\nAlso, I don't understand why the London business people are so alarmed to see cloudy skies. Do they not realise they live in *London?*\n\nSources!\n\n...you know those people who will whisper frantically to their friends about how something is wrong while they're watching a movie, much to the annoyance of everyone around them? That was me in the theatre when this came out. ",

They produced the highest peaks of the human being.\n\nProbably speaks for itself but um that's some really bad history. For every aristocrat that was this benevolent, educated ideal (that OP seems to think they themselves are) there were lazy, elitist people that produced little of value and oppressed hundreds/thousands. To call the time where only aristocrats were educated the “highest peak” of human existence seems totally at odds with basically every measure of human achievement ranging from economic production, health outcomes, or volume and range of cultural output.",

        "text": "...oh dear. I looked at the URL of the article I'm critiquing, and now I feel kind of bad. Not bad enough to stop, but bad enough to look at my life and wonder what I've become. But not enough to stop. Never that.\n\n[This article](http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005179), then. It's from the US Holocaust Museum, and it's about Eichmann's trial. The article itself is a good summary of Eichmann's trial, but it's the last sentence that I want to look at, the sentence that says:\n\n&gt; The execution of Adolf Eichmann remains the only time that Israel has enacted a death sentence.\n\nThis is wrong, but what's interesting is that it's not as wrong as you might suspect. Israel has had a grand total of two executions as part of a death sentence, with Eichmann being the only one charged in a civil court. What I find really interesting, though, is the theology and the morality behind these death sentences, and just what those two executions represent.\n\nBut first, the debunking. As I said, Eichmann's execution is not the only execution to take place in Israel. In 1948, the Israeli military tried Meir Tobianski for espionage, suspecting that he'd provided the locations of arms factories in Israel to the Jordanian military. Tobianski denied the charges, but was found guilty and executed by firing squad. A year later, however, he was acquitted. His thoughts on the subject are not known. \n\nWhile that was the Israeli military executing Tobianski rather than a civil court, it was still the state of Israel that was ultimately responsible for killing Tobianski, much as it would later be responsible for killing Eichmann. The penalty was enacted as part of Israeli military law, which was absolutely part of the laws of the state of Israel. His execution counts as an execution conducted by Israel. \n\nWhat I find interesting, though, is that these are the only two executions in Israeli (in terms of the modern nation) history. Contrary to what Jewish religious law might suggest, executions have traditionally been fairly rare in Judaism, and rare in Israel as a consequence. The reasons behind this are fascinating, and reveal a lot about Jewish history and how religious law interacts with a lack of real power.\n\nMuch of the Jewish law about the death penalty and how it should be applied comes from the Mishnah, a work which was completed during the Roman occupation of Judea, meaning that its actual ability to be implemented was severely limited. There's some debate about whether it was used at all, with some scholars pointing out that it was probably completed after the destruction of the Temple, a time during which the Jews couldn't be said to be in any position to execute their own laws. Equally, though, the Mishnah is ostensibly a collection of oral traditions and laws, written down so they could be preserved. How true this is is also debated, but it's also completely possible - indeed, likely - that people were executed under Jewish law prior to the destruction of the Temple. After the destruction of the Temple, however, the Sanhedrin laws (laws specifically dealing with capital punishment) could not be enacted until the rebuilding of the Temple in the Messianic age.\n\nWhat's really interesting about the laws in the Mishnah, though, is how difficult it becomes to execute somebody, even if you want to. Take [this passage](http://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Sanhedrin.1.4?lang=en&amp;layout=lines&amp;sidebarLang=all) from Sanhedren 1:4, for instance:\n\n&gt; Capital cases, by twenty-three. Bestiality, by twenty-three, as it says (Leviticus 20:16) \"and you shall kill the woman and the beast,\" and it says, (Leviticus 20:15) \"and you shall kill the beast.\" An ox to be stoned, by twenty-three, as it is written (Exodus 21:29) \"the ox shall be stoned and its owner shall also be put to death,\" as is the death of the owner, so is the death of the ox. The wolf and the lion, the bear and the tiger, the leopard and the snake, are put to death by twenty-three. Rabbi Eli'ezer says: Whoever is the first to kill [the animal] has performed a meritorious deed. Rabbi Akiva says: they are put to death by twenty-three.\n\nIn non-difficult terms, it's basically saying that to execute someone, they need to be found guilty by a collection of 23 judges. In addition, there need to be two witnesses, and circumstantial evidence isn't permitted. Essentially, the burden of proof required before a person can be executed is stupidly high, meaning that despite a large number of Jewish laws in Leviticus and other books requiring execution as a punishment for a crime, in actuality, rabbinic interpretations of these laws result in very few actual executions. It's an interesting compromise between wanting to maintain the Law as stated in the Torah and the realities of not really being in a position to enact laws in any meaningful way. \n\nThe difference also comes in with which aspects of the Torah rabbinical commentators in the Talmud and Mishnah chose to focus on when compiling law. While there are a lot of debates outside Judaism around the translation of \"thou shalt not kill,\" for many commenting in the Mishnah, the commandment was taken to mean \"don't kill people, yo,\" even in the case of execution. The shift in interpretation and focus meant, once again, that executions were rare, and the death penalty wasn't as favoured as might be expected. \n\nIndeed, even when the Jews did have some degree of autonomy, they still didn't favour the death penalty. Islamic Spain in the 14th century, for instance, did grant some degree of autonomy to Jewish courts to uphold Jewish law. In this case, even when the punishment called for in the Torah was death, the courts still didn't sentence people to death, instead choosing mutilation as their punishment. The sole exception to this was when there was a perception that the crime that someone had committed endangered the survival of the community. \n\nWhich brings me back to modern Israel and Tobianski. Given that execution isn't generally favoured in Jewish law, it does seem interesting that the reaction to Tobianski's crime would have been execution, especially given that he was later acquitted, implying that he wasn't tried by the standards I listed earlier. Indeed, when the idea of Israel as an actual state was being batted around, one concern that was raised was the idea that it would be isolated from the rest of the world because of the proclivity of the Torah to throw capital punishment around willy nilly. However, as Rabbi Isaac Herzog pointed out, it was mainly the laws of the British Mandate that were dictating capital punishment as a response to offenses - Jewish law hadn't actually acted on those punishments in millennia.  In 1954, after a long debate in the Knesset, Israel [abolished](http://www.jta.org/1954/02/17/archive/israel-parliament-votes-to-abolish-capital-punishment) capital punishment with the exception of treason in war time and crimes against humanity. The only time capital punishment has been used since that ban has been with Eichmann. \n\nIn essence, then, while Israel has executed more people than just Adolf Eichmann, it's also, by it's very nature, not going to be gung-ho about execution, and never was. While the debate at the Knesset was heavy, the fact that there were so few executions prior to it means that capital punishment really was an absolute last resort as a punishment. It simply wasn't a real option in Israel.\n\nSources!\n\nThe [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/judaism/jewishethics/capital.shtml) has a nice overview of Jewish religious ethics surrounding capital punishment.\n\n[This](http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/the-death-penalty-in-jewish-tradition/) is a good article as well, though it's heavy in religious terminology, so if you're not terribly familiar with Judaism, I don't recommend it.",

Such a thing disintegrates spectacularly when examined closely.\n\nOh, before we start, have a quick gander at this [impressive family tree](http://www.britroyals.com/royaltree.htm).\n\nIn this charming article, [Queen poised for record after rallying troubled monarchy](http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/08/16/uk-britain-royals-queen-idUKKCN0QL06520150816), Reuters drops a particular historical fact on us:\n\n&gt; She became the 40th monarch in a royal line that goes back to William the Conqueror, who took the throne in 1066 after winning the Battle of Hastings.\n\nUnfortunately, this is simply not true. If we take the most open interpretation of royal succession, we find that the royal line established by William I ends with Elizabeth I, the daughter of Henry VIII. This is the entire point of the 1603 Stuart succession - England ran out of royals to put on the throne (or at least people who weren't [Lady Anne Stanley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Stanley,_Countess_of_Castlehaven)) so power players chose James VI of Scotland to combine England and Scotland in [personal union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_the_Crowns) as James I; indeed, Sir Robert Cecil had been grooming James for months to ensure a swift and painless succession.\n\nReuters' goal with their overly dramatic article was to shore up any doubt that Elizabeth II is the true and just ruler of the United Kingdom. This single paragraph is an attempt to prove her sea-worthiness by comparing her royal blood to old leather boots. So good news! The lineage of James I can be traced all the way back to the venerable [Edmund II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Ironside) who predates William I by a whole 50 years!\n\nY'know? *Edmund II*? He reigned for 6 months in 1016 between two much more famous kings?\n\nAnyway, Elizabeth is the granddaughter of a guy stabbed whilst taking a poo in Oxford*.\n\nThere's another little bump in the road between James I and Elizabeth II - [the Glorious Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glorious_Revolution). Parliament chased (this is after the monarchy was re-established) James II out of the country in 1688, called him nasty names and declared that, by running away like a pansy, the throne was theirs to hand out to whoever they wanted. So they made some really complicated legal declarations that finally straightened everything out by the time George I made it to the throne in 1714. The royal blood line is maintained throughout (though you have to accept matrilineal legitimacy for it to be totally kosher).\n\nI can see why Reuters didn't try to explain all this. Still, they're not technically correct and as we all know [technically correct is the best kind of correct](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_81Lx8f0s2k). Take your pick anyway - Elizabeth's royal blood ends at George I, James I or Edmund II. Just not William I.\n\nEdit: Added some links and dates, did some reworking etc.\n\n^(*Probably false.)\n\n",

In this review I'm going to ignore the elephant in the room and talk about all the other stuff going on, because there's still plenty of bad history to talk about even if we ignore the whole Templars bringing over shiploads of gold to America plotline. \n\n*National Treasure* opens up with young Benjamin Franklin Gates rummaging around his attic and discovering some papers, whereupon his grandfather tells him a tale of a treasure and a map. \n\n**01:44** \"It was 1832, on a night much like this\" (I just realized that the writers of *National Treasure* managed to start the movie off with the equivalent of \"It was a dark and stormy night\")\n\n**2:00**--Carroll *was* the last surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence. However, he actually wasn't a delegate to the Continental Congress while the discussion about Independence was going on, and in fact wasn't named a delegate until *after* independence had been voted on and approved. He took his place in the sessions starting August 2, but was allowed to sign the document, as were the other new delegates (there were several men who weren't delegates when the vote was cast who's names are on the Declaration). \n\n**2:05**--However there's absolutely no indication at all that he was a mason, though his son was (and he was also named Charles). Also the Freemasons aren't exactly a \"secret society\". Plus he was a devoted Catholic and thus highly unlikely to have been a Mason. \n\n**2:55**--Despite the numerous times I've watched this movie I never realized until now that they were [blinding us](http://i.imgur.com/4eNoV4H.jpg) with propaganda. \n\n**3:20**--It didn't reappear until more than a thousand years later. This was the time of the first Crusades. \n\n**3:02**--[These guys](http://i.imgur.com/25qODgQ.jpg) make an appearance, which would put this event sometime between 100 B.C.E. and 100 A.D.? They have the stereotypical \"Roman\" look which makes it's appearance about this time, which is also about the time that Rome was busy conquering Judea. For reference [here's](http://i.imgur.com/28MmViS.jpg) what a Roman from that time period might have looked like. They've at least got the right shape to the armor. \n\n**3:23**--The [Templars](http://i.imgur.com/Ah57Eaj.jpg) show up!\n\n* Wearing uniforms of the Knights Templar before they were even organized. Apparently they had access to Edward's time machine. I am happy to see that they're wearing mail and not plate armor--that much is correct. \n\n* White mantle was assigned as a uniform in 1129, the red cross at the beginning of the Second Crusade 1147, or almost 50 years after the First ended.\n\n**3:38**--\"They brought the treasure back to Europe and took the name Knights Templar\". It sure did take them an awful long time to organize. The First Crusade was called in 1096. Jerusalem fell in 1099. The Knights Templar weren't organized until 1120.\n\n\n**3:41**--I think the set designers for National Treasure must have robbed the fantasy store of swords. What in the everlasting fuck is the point of [those crossguards](http://i.imgur.com/ZyrVEwn.jpg)? Also those helmets seem to have come from the fantasy prop department. Again they're wearing mail, which is good, but you can totally tell that it's just an outfit with a mail design on it--basically a grown up version of kid's costume. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/d1eFx7G.jpg) we see the gear that a Templar would have used in 1165. Note the astonishing lack of fantasy swords and helmets. \n\n**3:59**--Not enough going on in [this scene](http://i.imgur.com/NLdBCEk.jpg) to let me really critique though I'd be shocked if they have the uniforms right for either side. However note the wide angle shot. See the stoopid British marching in line formation? See how the Americans aren't in a line, because they didn't fight that way, right? Even in a 5 second clip this myth gets reenforced--never mind that these are Continental Army soldiers who were absolutely trained to do this and fought this way as a matter of course. Oh and never mind that militia were trained to do this as well, and generally did so except in unusual circumstances or where the terrain prevented it. \n\n**4:01**--Freemasons included Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, &amp; Paul Revere. Washington joined the Freemasons as a young man but by the time he was President he hadn't been involved in the organization for decades. Paul Revere *was* an active Freemason as were many of the most influential Whigs in Boston. In fact the planning for the Boston Tea Party took place in the meeting place of the home of the Scottish Rite Masons which met in the Green Dragon Tavern. In 1798 George Washington wrote a letter in which he said this \"The fact is, I preside over none, nor have I been in one more than once or twice, within the last thirty years.\" The letter was in response to claims that Washington ran the lodges in America and that the Freemason lodges were associated with the Iluminati. [This](http://boston1775.blogspot.com/2014/06/george-washington-encounters-illuminati.html) excellent article by J.L. Bell is definitely worth reading.\n\n**4:08**--Since when did the British issue [sawed off shotguns](http://i.imgur.com/BXKzJDc.jpg) to the infantry? At least that's what this weapon appears to be. \n\n**12:25**--[Meershaum Pipe.](http://i.imgur.com/xSrm7Zt.jpg) Looks ivory to me and not handled at all. (Meershaum is actually a type of mineral, not just a decorating style). Used meershaum will become discolored with age, acquiring a reddish or even brown tint, such as [this pipe](http://i.imgur.com/jQAZ5Wr.jpg) from 1791. The cleanness of it might be explained by it being a new pipe, but there are two issues with that. First is that new meershaum pipes tend to be much whiter as in [this example](http://i.imgur.com/Y9f65ai.jpg). The second is that we know that the pipe had to have been handled on a regular basis before it was stashed on the *Charlotte*, because it was used as part of the key to the Templar treasure. \n\n\n**15:25**--[Mr. Matlack](http://i.imgur.com/cZphMCX.jpg) not the official scribe of the Congress. He'd acted as scribe on a handful of documents, but there was no official scribe. We don't know who actually copied the Declaration. It may have been Matlack (he was the one who took the copies down to the printer to have printed and sent out to be read), but we're not 100% sure it was him. Matlack was a powerful figure in Pennsylvania politics--he was certainly too powerful to be the official scribe of the Continental Congress. He did engross George Washington's commission as Commander-in-Chief as well as the First Continental Congress' reply to King George III, but that's not much work for an \"official\" scribe.\n\n**15:42**--It was actually signed by 56 men, not 55 One of the signatures was added much later than the others, which might be what was referred to here, but the Declaration wasn't signed by the other 55 in one sitting, despite what John Trunbull would have us believe. There's some debate about when the signatures were added, though it wasn't all done in one sitting. \n\n**15:59**--\"A document of that importance would ensure the map's survival\". Except that the document *wasn't* regarded as that important when it was written. The act of declaration was more important than the document, which didn't start to become \"American Scripture\" until the 19th century with the rivalry of Adams and Jefferson. (See *American Scripture* by Pauline Maier for more information)\n\nArguing happens. Then guns and flares get pulled and a ship blown up. Then a trip to the office of Dr. Abigail Chase who proceeds to laugh at them. \n\n**23:01**--\"Nice collection of George Washington campaign buttons\". I see you're missing one. \nThere were no such thing as George Washington campaign buttons. There were commerative buttons issued for his inaugration, but there were dozens of different designs issued. [This websight](http://georgewashingtoninauguralbuttons.com/) has many examples of the varying designs, shapes, materials and types of inaugral and commorative George Washington buttons, along with some other military buttons. (Warning--individual pages have background music that you can't disable--it's incredibly annoying). \n\n**23:07**--Also what's up with the [fake writing quills](http://i.imgur.com/jFy9Arv.jpg) and ink stands? Presumably that's what they're supposed to be and not just a random feather stuck in a jar. A standard 18th century quill pen might look more like [these](http://i.imgur.com/1amsR7K.jpg) surviving examples from the late 18th century. Some quills did have longer feathers, but the quills always would have been stiff and feathers stripped on one side, not just a long feather stuck in a random jar.\n\nThey leave and visit the Library of Congress. Then there's a montage of various preparations to steal the Declaration. \n\n**32:23**--Amazingly enough the button that Nic Cage ends up giving away *is* an actual reproduction of a 1789 inaugral button which is known as the \"Pater Patriae\" button. \n\nLots of heist stuff happens.\n\n**56:44**\n\nThrough the POVs of the FBI, Sean Bean, and Nic Cage we learn about the Silence Dogood letters and that they were first published in 1722\n\n**57:12**\n\nAn FBI agent reads from a screen telling us that when Benjamin Franklin was only 15 years old he wrote a series of letters to his brother's newspaper pretending to be a middle-aged widow named Silence DoGood. Benjamin Franklin was born January 17, 1706, the first letter was published April 2, 1722 which would have made him 16. \n\n**1:01:15**\n\nNic Cage is seen pulling on some white gloves in preparation for handling the Declaration. There's actually no need for this. When dealing with leather/vellum artifacts clean hands are perfectly reasonable precautions to take. The danger with oils is more noticeable with paper, but even then a pair of rubber gloves (depending on the type) will work just fine. \n\n**1:04:13**\n\nAfter going through a bowlful of lemons they discover that they have an \"Ottendorf cypher\", only there's really no such thing as an Ottendorf cypher. The writers of National Treasure made up the term to describe what's really just a simple [book cypher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_cipher), of the type that Benedict Arnold used (his key text was Blackstone's \"Commentaries on the Laws of England\")\n\n(As a side note I'm not sure why they needed the handwritten texts for these, as what's important in a book cypher is the placement of the words on the page and line, and those could be gotten easily from a scan of which many were available.) Also the Silence Dogood letters wouldn't make a good book cypher text because for a good cypher text you want something long enough to be able to mine for all sorts of words if need be, and there were only 14 letters and some of them were quite short and most of them were talking about every day life. \n\n**1:11:34**\n\nJohn Pass and John Stow cast the Liberty Bell. Except they didn't. The bell was cast in 1752 in London by the firm Lester and Pack and was sent to Philadelphia and cracked shortly after arriving. Pass and Snow recast it (twice!) after it's arrival in Philadelphia, and their names appear on the bell, but they didn't cast it. They simply fixed it after it arrived in America. \n\n**1:12:34**\n\nNic Cage launches into a long history about the Independence Hall painting on the back of the hundred dollar bill, about how it was based on a painting done in the 1780s by an artist who was a friend of Benjamin Franklin. Problem is that the steeple with the clocktower in it wasn't added to Independence Hall until **1828**. As originally built Independence Hall would've looked like [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Independence_Hall_Detail_1752.jpg/800px-Independence_Hall_Detail_1752.jpg)\n\nThe original steeple was demolished in 1781 due to structural problems. A simpler one was built ([here's](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Birch%27s_Views_Plate_23.jpg/720px-Birch%27s_Views_Plate_23.jpg) a sideview of Independece Hall in 1799, for example), and in 1828 the cupola was rebuilt and the clock added. The painting of Independence Hall that adorns the $100 bill was actually done by a man named Joachim Benzing for the 1928 $100 bill. \n\n**1:12:55**\n\nAfter using a water bottle as a magnifying glass, neat trick, Nic declares the time on the tower to be 2:22. Only he's wrong, as the time on the tower is 4:10. [$100 bill](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:US-$100-FRN-1928-Fr.2150-G.jpg). [Here's](http://i.imgur.com/4uwwbJL.png) the image cropped. Pretty clear shows as 4:10. Also why do they need the sun for this trick? I mean the trick is blown anyway because the cupola there isn't the one that was there when Ben Franklin was around, but wouldn't some trig and some math have gotten them close enough to have allowed them to start wiggling bricks loose? I mean what if it's a cloudy day? Or if it's the wrong season?\n\n**1:13:30**\n\nRiley says Daylight Savings Time wasn't adopted until WWI, which is only sort of right. Many countries passed laws starting DST plans at that time. The US was one of them, passing the Standard Time Act of March 19, 1918, which was supposed to go into effect on March 31, 1918. It was wildly unpopular though, and with the conclusion of the war the plan was widely ignored and soon repealed. It became a local option, observed in some states, until WWII. FDR instituted laws starting it in 1942, and again it was repealed in 1945. After 1945 many local states and municipalities instituted daylight savings, but there was no federal daylight savings time, but by the early 60s the transportation industry found the lack of cohesion confusing enough to push for a standard and in 1966 the Uniform Time Act of 1966 was born which cleaned up time zones as well as clarified Daylight Savings rules. \n\n**1:13:45**\n\nNo, Benjamin Franklin was **not** the first person to suggest daylight savings. That honor actually goes to New Zealander George Hudson. The closest that Ben Franklin came to the idea of daylight savings was publishing an anonymous letter while in Paris suggesting that the French rise earlier in the summer to take advantage of the sunlight to conserve on candles. However, the piece was satire, also suggesting taxing shutters and waking up the populace by firing cannons in the morning. DST in a pre-modern society is simply not a feasible concept.\n\n\n\n**1:17:03**\n\n\"Some kind of ocular device\"\"\n\nReally Nic? You can't just say glasses? It's pretty impressive that Ben Franklin was inventing these glasses in the early 1770s (soon after the writing of the Declaration anyway), since in 1784 he was writing to George Whatley about the invention of bifocals that he was \"happy in the invention of double spectacles, which serving for distant objects as well as near ones, make my eyes as useful to me as ever they were.\" Multicolored glasses that aren't just windowglass seem an order of magnitude harder than bifocals.\n\nAction stuff happens\n\n**1:35:02**\n\nSome badlinguistics at the least here. Nic tells Sean that they're meeting here because the map said to meet at the corner of Walle st and then proceeds to talk about how the Dutch build a wall to protect against the British (which is certainly wrong--the disputed history is whether it was to keep the *Indians* out) and the original street ran along that wall. While there's some debate about whether or not there was a palisade or wall along Wall Street, what's not in debate is how it was spelled. The Dutch would've spelled it as \"de Waal Straat\", or perhaps \"Waal Straat\", and any map/instructions written in the late 18th century would not have spelled wall with an e at the end of it no matter what.\n\nHe talks about Broadway once being named after the de Heere family and then being renamed Broadway by the English (which is true enough), but then goes on to say that one of the gates of the Wall (after which Wall Street was named) was located there, which is why Trinity church was built there.\n\n**1:35:03**\n\nCan we talk for a bit about the problem with Trinity church being the location for a vast secret treasure hidden by a secret cabal of America's Founding Father's? There are numerous problems with this theory.\n\n* Trinity Church was a Loyalist Church. It was in the heart of a Loyalist city and it had a mostly Loyalist congregation\n\n* It's rector was required to be a Loyalist. No way was he going to allow anything to be going on in his church\n\n* It was in the middle of an occupied warzone. The might of the British army was centered around New York for several years. How was this treasure going to be kept safe?\n\n* And most damningly of all the church burnt down in 1776 when large parts of the city burnt down shortly after Nathan Hale's disastrously incompetent spy mission. \n\nIndiana Jones stuff happens\n\n**1:49:05**\n\nI know that the two of them were just making up shit at this point to send Sean Bean on a wild goose chase, but they could've at least gotten the name of the guy right when they talked about the person hanging up the lantern. It was Robert Newman (a sexton) who hung up the lantern, not Thomas Newton. Along with Newman was a man named Captain Pulling (a vestryman), and another man named Thomas Bernard who helped.         \n\nIf you've read through all of that, here's Cinema Sins taking on National Treasure\n\n[Everything Wrong With National Treasure in 13 Minutes or Less](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ul-_ZWvXTs)                                                                                           \n",

        "text": "I honestly only bothered to watch a few minutes of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IO-CooA4_Y). While not quite BAD history, it is far too oversimplified history, to the point of being not-very-good. \"Sieges were how war was fought\" at 0:38, for instance, is very true in particular times and places, and not very true in others. Depending on the goal of war (taking over land, obliterating the populace, spreading your culture), the number of sieges as opposed to simple raids, minor skirmishes, or very small pitched battles would vary drastically. \n\nIt is also a bit silly to separate sieges from battles, as the two VERY often went hand in hand. He mentions the siege of Athens (not much of a siege if you ask me) during the Persian Wars, and just moments before mentions Marathon, but for some reason separates the two. Athens being taken was a direct consequence of how Marathon was fought. He may be referring to Athens being taken after Thermopylae, but that was also a direct response to Thermopylae delaying the Persians an the Athenians booking it to gather up the allied Greek forces for a (somewhat) unified assault.  \n\nThis also becomes an issue when ignoring how often the pitched battles were important in turning a war. Tours/Poitier (the Martel one), Sekigahara, Pharsalus, and the recently-discussed here on /r/badhistory Gettysburg (though not ancient or medieval, which the video is specifically talking about) come to mind as ENORMOUS turning points in campaigns (or ending points, really). The three battles of Hannibal in Italy lead to battles no longer being fought against Hannibal, and instead focusing on his reinforcements and Carthage itself (and surrounding areas). Caesar's battles in Alexandria kind of straddle the line of siege and battle, as does Alesia. The guerrilla-ish warfare of Scotland after Falkirk allowed the Scots to continue their war for a couple decades, on and off, but it was Bannockburn which turned the war in their favor and gained their freedom (for all of what, 20 years?). Or Hastings, which destroyed the unity of the Saxon forces, allowing William to march further into England. While, true, he did continue on to besiege a few places, his circumvallation of the cities, combined with the shattered unity and dead royal family of the Saxons allowed him to take many cities with little-to-no fighting and very short sieges. Bouddica also comes to mind, and the Cimbri/Teutons under Boiorix and Teutobod.\n\nIf I recall correctly, the Battle of Chi Bi ended Tsao Tsao's offensive into Wu, and while it was a pitched battled, it was a small force of fire ships which turned the battle, nearly equivalent to a raid. Wu Zhang plains was turned by a raid on supply depots, which turned that campaign back. Oda Nobunaga's entire career was ended with an intra-city \"siege\" of sorts at Honnoji, but straddled that same line of battle/siege. \n\nSo, overall, not \"bad\" history, as I said, just very over-simplified history ignoring how often picthed battled did turn a war, and how often things other than siege allowed the war to continue on effectively. What I got from the video was a claim that siege warfare= the main component of pre-modern warfare, rather than just another important component.\n\nJust a little extra, at about 2:05 he is talking about William of Normandy, and claims he wasn't French...that he was a Norman. True, but the Normans had been in Normandy for about 150 years by the time of William...I would call that French. He was a part of the French realm, spoke French, worshiped like a Frenchman, warred in a mix of French and Norman styles, and created an empire which remained in France for a couple centuries. He goes on to claim that until 1880 the French people didn't speak French...they did. They just didn't speak Parisian French, and there was still some Occitan, probably still a fair deal of the Goidelic languages of Brittany, but by-and-large, the French people spoke different dialects which were very close to French...as close to French as Montreal or Cajun French are, maybe closer. \n\nEdit: Feel I should also point out his claim of \"a few times at Crecy, Poitiers, Agincourt, those were the battles\" is kind of his main point, yes? That pitched battles were relatively rare. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Hundred_Years'_War_battles nearly 50 battles. I would not count a battle more than once every 3 years on average relatively rare at all. There are a number of sieges on that list, and MANY sieges of smaller castles and towns not on the list. This only highlights my point that battles absolutely WERE pivotal to war. And while I would agree that, compared to sieges, large pitched battles were rare, smaller battles and skirmishes were a huge part of warfare too, and should not be deemed as less important than sieges. Claiming so is bad history.",

        "text": "I wrote a previous post about some of the bad history I found in \"The Office,\" and while it's easy to poke fun at a character who brings out bad history as part of his character, [this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B-c3XlieZg&amp;feature=youtu.be) is a bit more interesting in its depiction of bad history. With this particular clip, I'm not sure the writers themselves recognised their mistake.\n\nThis clip - and the whole episode, really - revolves around Dwight (the dumb one) and Oscar (the smart one) having a debate about whether or not Gettysburg was the northernmost battle of the Civil War. Oscar argues that it was, while Dwight argues that it was not, saying that the Battle of Schrute Farms was further north. There was, of course, no Battle of Schrute Farms, but Dwight's not wrong - Gettysburg was not the northernmost battle of the Civil War. That honour belongs to the Battle of Salineville, which took place around 50 miles further north than Gettysburg.\n\nThe Battle of Salineville took place on 26 July, 1863 as part of Confederate Brigadier General John Hunt Morgan's raid (known as \"Morgan's Raid,\" conveniently enough) on the Union Army of the Ohio. Despite being told not to, Morgan crossed the Ohio River from Kentucky into Indiana to harass and harangue the Union troops under General Ambrose Burnside (this week's winner of the \"cool historical name contest\"). This went rather badly, with the Confederates being pushed deeper and deeper into Ohio, cut off from their supplies and any avenue of retreat. After an hour and a half long firefight in which Morgan lost 364 of his men, Morgan surrendered to Union forces.\n\nHowever, the Battle of Salineville, while the northernmost battle, is not the northernmost military action of the war. If we were looking at that (which, technically, I guess we're not, but I want to anyway, since I'm here), we'd be looking at St. Alban's Raid, which took place in St. Alban's, Vermont, just south of the Canadian border. To be honest, I love the story of this raid, and that's mostly why I'm writing about it. Bennett Young, a Confederate soldier who had been captured at the Battle of Salineville escaped the prison he'd been sent to and fled to Canada. Once in Canada, he got in contact with Confederate secret agents operating in Canada (one of whom was presumably named Jimmy Bond) and proposed a series of raids on Union towns to force the Union to divert troops to protect their Canadian border. He was returned to the Confederacy, made a lieutenant, and put in charge of making it so. He recruited other escaped Confederates, and quietly prepared a raid on St. Albans. On 10 October, 1864, Young checked into a St. Alban's hotel with two fellow soldiers, claiming the three of them were there on vacation. Over the next week, more soldiers would arrive for \"vacations,\" likely confusing a poor Vermont hotel owner and the entire population of St. Albans as their town became increasingly filled with \"vacationers\" with thick, Kentucky accents. After having to delay a day because of concerns about \"butter day\" in St. Alban's, on the 19th, Young and his 20 compatriots staged simultaneous raids on the city's three banks, loudly announcing that they were part of the Confederacy and acting on its behalf (I like to imagine that the townsfolk of St. Alban's were not terribly surprised to hear this). The Confederate agents stole   $208 000, then tried to set the town on fire, but failed, managing to burn just a single, solitary shed. They then fled to Canada, where they were promptly arrested because Canada wanted no part in any of this nonsense. Canada returned the money that was recovered to St. Alban's, released the Confederates, and gave the Confederacy a stern talking-to, telling them there would be no more of this raid nonsense coming from their country. The Confederacy agreed, and no more raids were conducted. \n\nIn any case, whether the writers of the show realised it or not, Dwight is right - Gettysburg was not the northernmost battle of the Civil War. That honour belongs to the Battle of Salineville.\n\nAlso, there was no Battle of Schrute Farms. Just for the record.\n\nSources!\n\n[Please just read about St. Alban's Raid.

The visigoths demanded stipends every month, simply for crossing a border. The parallels between the gothic migration and the Middle Eastern migration of today are astoundingly similar.\n&gt; As for a source, I'd say read the The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.\n&gt; As for what I can do right now, I'd suggest a simple google search but I'll leave you with this.\n&gt; http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/romans/fallofrome_article_01.shtml\"\n\nThis post is chock full of /r/awesomehistory and the good part is that /u/Tiako already wrote a pretty good takedown of the \"OMG IMMIGRATION KILLED ROMA!\" in his seminal post, [\"Horse is lead to water, refuses to drink, proclaims immigration caused the fall of the Roman Empire\"](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3dzi9i/horse_is_lead_to_water_refuses_to_drink_proclaims/?) which I will steal some answers from.\n\nThis is kind of bad for me because he did a totally R. Rousey style takedown of the subject.  There's really no need for me to expound on this but I'm irritated that he got more internet points for this crap than I did and my back hurts.  Fortunately, the badhistory poster in /r/pics gave me a pretty good extra 50m target to aim at.  So for the purpose of this post I will be focusing on:\n\n&gt;The visigoths demanded stipends every month, simply for crossing a border.\n\nNow, saying that the Visigoths demanded stipends every month just for crossing a border is a bit of an understatement.  Yes, Rome did give them money.  Yes, they did cross a border.  Sort of.  The question of when the border was crossed and who owned it at that point is the confusing part.\n\nLatin has this word called \"foedus\" that means \"treaty\" in English.  Barbarians who entered into an alliance treaty with Rome which led to them being called \"foederati.\"  Why would Rome enter into a treaty with  barbarians, though?  \n\nRoman Problem #1:  Rome had more land than soldiers to control it and migrating tribes showing up wanting a bit of land.\n\nRoman Solution #1:  Swindle the barbarians into providing troops for Roman wars while also farming and protecting land as a buffer zone against other barbarians.\n\nWhich led to Roman Problem #2.  Barbarians eventually realizing they were conned when still MORE barbarians show up to attack Rome and Rome only wins because of said barbarian ally troops.\n\nBarbarian Plan A: Attack Rome for profit and profit.  (See 476 AD, Odoacer) \n\nRoman Solution #2: Screw it, who needed the Western Roman Empire anyway let the savages have it, all my toys are in Constantinople, and here we've just got those pesky Persians.\n\nTLDR; So who's land was it?  Technically, Rome's land.  In theory Rome couldn't control it effectively and then \"gave\" it to the people who were somewhat in control of it, while also giving them some trade stuffs and the monies.  \n\nedit: Both of which were cheaper than throwing more good Roman troops into the mix.  It's not like the barbarians showed up to take care of Rome's excellent single payer healthcare system.",

Short and sweet.\n\nI'd like to take a moment to discuss [this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wi20D6x2sfo) from \"The Office,\" a show that's not about history in the slightest, but I don't recall that ever stopping me before. In this particular clip, Dwight says that the song \"Greensleeves\" is about the the beheading of Anne Boleyn. This is incorrect. The song is not, in fact, about Anne Boleyn, contrary to popular opinion.\n\nThere is a legend that the song is about Anne Boleyn, though not about her beheading. A common idea is that it's a song that Henry VIII wrote for her as part of his wooing. This is somewhat consistent with the timeline we know for \"Greensleeves\" - the first reference to it is in 1580, which means it's possible he wrote it. Equally, Henry VIII was renowned as a composer and musician, even having a book of songs written by him compiled in 1518 (and which you can see [here](http://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item101064.html)). The idea that Henry VIII wrote \"Greensleeves\" is not an inherently ludicrous one.\n\nHowever, Henry was known for writing in a French style, which \"Greensleeves\" is not. \"Greensleeves\" is much more reflective of Italian styles that weren't introduced into England until the Elizabethan era. Once again, while it's possible that \"Greensleeves\" is an older introduction, the difference in style between it and Henry's other works makes it highly, highly unlikely that he actually wrote it. \n\nA more likely theory is that it's a ditty about a prostitute that caught on because of the tune and because of the subject of the song. However, it's not about Anne Boleyn's beheading.

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3gw8cs/the_mysterious_case_of_the_abundance_of_canadian/",
        "text": "I was a bit torn on writing this post. I want to talk about [this comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/3ed58q/absolutely_sikhening/cte1sm4?context=2) from /r/funny which, while not *technically* wrong, is wrong in its implications. See, the incident the comment is linking to is Air India Flight 182, the deadliest terrorist attack in Canadian history, and one which was definitely carried out by Sikh extremists. It's also, to my knowledge, the only aviation terrorist attack carried out under Canadian jurisdiction (if we want to get technical, Air India 182 actually happened near Ireland, not Canada). The trouble with the comment, though, is its implication, first, that's it's only Sikhs causing problems on Canadian airplanes, and second, that aviation terror attacks are common enough that it's a meaningful thing that the only aviation terror attack in Canadian history was committed by Sikh extremists. They're not, and it's wrong for asserting - however implicitly - that they are.\n\nAs I said, it's not *technically* wrong, but it's still wrong. \n\nOn the first point, I present to you the case of one [Albert Guay](http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/edu/ViewLoitDa.do;jsessionid=05704D0BEA971E0588F4DFBD1E4C69C0?method=preview&amp;lang=EN&amp;id=4484), the closest incident I could find to a second Canadian aviation terrorist attack. Albert Guay was a Canadian watch and jewelry salesman who fell in love and began an affair with a woman who was not his wife. From a modern perspective, this is a problem, but one that can be solved by divorce. From a strict-Catholic-in-Quebec-in-1949 perspective, however, this was more of a problem. Rather than attempt to get a divorce, which would have been nigh-on impossible, Guay settled for the much more reasonable approach of just murdering his wife by putting dynamite in her suitcase while sending her on an airplane trip to pick up jewels for him. The bomb went off mid-flight, killing everyone on board, and leaving Guay free to marry the girl of his dreams. Of course, he was arrested two weeks later when investigators grew suspicious of the insurance claim he'd taken out on his wife, but that definitely wasn't part of his plan.\n\nEqually, the idea of bombing a Canadian airplane was not new to the Babbar Khalsa. After Guay, airplane bombings and hijackings became more and more frequent, though most ended with the plane and its passengers surviving rather than being blown to bits. Airplane bombs were used as terrorist weapons for the first time in 1956 during the EOKA bombing attacks during the fight for Cypriot independence. As aviation became a larger and larger industry, the number of bombings - and particularly political bombings - increased, though proportionally, they decreased. However, as [this chart](http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/planes/terrorism/totals.gif) (compiled from [this list](http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/planes/q0283.shtml) of every airplane bombing) shows, bombings still weren't a common thing, nor were politics the prevailing motivation at any point. \n\nThis brings me to my second point about this comment. The comment is implying that airplane bombings and aviation terrorism is common enough that it's noteworthy that Sikhs have been the only ones responsible for it in Canada. In the entire history of commercial aviation, there have been a grand total of eighty-eight bombings, most of which were suicides or murders committed by individuals against individuals for private motives. Even in the context of lists like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_aircraft_hijackings) of aircraft hijackings, terrorist attacks are a rarity, and even those that are terrorism take place in a very small sliver of the world, much like the rest of terrorism. If we look at the majority of developed nations, we will find no aviation terrorist attacks whatsoever. If we look at the world as a whole, we will find no attacks. If we look at terrorism *in Canada itself*, it's relatively terrorist free.\n\nI suppose this is an issue of semantics. If I were to say \"Sikhs are responsible for half of aviation bombings in Canada,\" you might think that meant something. If I went further and said \"I mean, there have only ever been two, and Canada wasn't even the target in either of them,\" you might re-evaluate my original statement. This is the danger of looking at history out of context - things that are true (that the deadliest air attack prior to 9/11 was caused by Sikh extremists...) suddenly take on meanings that they simply don't have (...and therefore profiling Sikhs at the airport is justified). Air bombings - and aviation terrorism in general - are rare. Pointing to one as an example of how Sikhs aren't to be trusted is silly and rather wrong, and an abuse of history. ",

        "text": "I am a frequent reader of /r/rupaulsdragrace. On both the TV show and the sub (and the internet at large), there is this mythos perpetuated that the Stonewall Riots were started by drag queens or otherwise largely influenced by them. While drag queens were certainly a component, the balance of the evidence suggests that it was middle class white men who were the main actors.\n\nAlthough I'd seen several incidences in the show where people suggested that Stonewall was started by drag queens, my response was a direct response to the responses from drag queens to the upcoming (and not yet released) [Stonewall movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3018070/), and in particular these responses from a past winner suggesting that the movie ignored the drag queens. [One](https://i.imgur.com/iDPFtrT.jpg) and [two.](https://i.imgur.com/iUzX6qF.png)\n\nI'm going to copy/paste my post from that subreddit. RPDR means \"RuPaul's Drag Race.\" If you want me to directly link the information to the source, let me know.\n\n\"TL;DR: Drag queens had next to nothing to do with the Stonewall Riots.\n\nFirst things first, I will admit all my biases. I am a straight, cis, female from the western US born in the '80s. I also do not have a degree in this, although I have a degree in Classics and am currently in law school.\n\nFirst things first, I don't believe any of the RPDR queens or the vast majority of drag queens are intentionally spreading misinformation. They are just repeating what they've been told. Secondly, **NONE** of the queens in RPDR experienced Stonewall. According to my calculations (which may be incorrect), none of them were even alive at that time. Even if I'm wrong (or one of them lied about her age), none of them would be more than toddlers.\n\nFirst, I want to say that Stonewall Inn and the Stonewall Riots were very important in the LBGTQ community. I don't want to suggest that what follows is supposed to mean that it was irrelevant or had no impact. I also don't want anyone to conclude that I mean is that there were no drag queens. I only mean to say that they were the minority in the movement.\n\nFor all you young'uns (myself included!) or otherwise unaware, the Stonewall Inn was a bar in Greenwich Village which opened in 1967. It, like many other places, was run by the Mafia. It claimed it was a \"social club\" not a bar, which allowed it to skirt many regulations, such as liquor licenses and control its clientele. It essentially functioned as an exclusive gay bar. Anyone who entered had to be known to the proprietors. Most of the clientele were middle class, white, gay men. Very few drag queens or transvestites were let in as they would have drawn attention to the bar.\n\nAs both homosexuality and unlicensed bars were illegal at that time, the Stonewall was frequently raided. The Mafiosos who controlled the bar paid off most of the local policemen to give them tip offs when raids were coming. They were usually able to get most people out in time. \n\nOn June 28, 1969, eight undercover cops raided the Stonewall. Unlike past raids, the Mafia had not been warned, the patrons had not been able to leave, and, for some reason, this was the straw that broke the camel's back. Some reports say that that night, the men dressed as women refused to give their IDs, the likely source of the drag queen chestnut.  According to most contemporary accounts, the inciting action was [Storme DeLarverie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm%C3%A9_DeLarverie), a black lesbian who asked the crowd \"Why don't you guys do something?\" This caused the crowd to start throwing things. Importantly, no independent media source was there at that time.\n\nWhile there was pro-Drag graffiti during the riots, pretty much no scholar believes they were the driving force or a primary motivation. Most historians believe it was a combination of the FBI coming down on the Mafia, the people not being tipped off, and homosexuality not being accepted. There were, according to most accounts, almost no drag queens at the Stonewall.\n\nSources:\nhttps://www.datalounge.com/thread/12623378-so-drag-queens-starting-stonewall-was-a-myth-all-along\n\nAmerican Gay\n By Stephen O.

IFTTT Email's questions with certain keywords and I got the full text there! Copied to pastebin for convenience:\n\nhttp://pastebin.com/YXfWSfmm\n\nThere is seriously so much wrong with this post I don't even know where to begin. So let's start from the beginning.\n\n&gt; Before I start I am going to make the following point: This post is not interested in how the notion makes people feel, it is only about reality and making sense of it. If you want to say how something makes you feel, the price is an actual contribution to the discussion first, which is something factual before you give your opinion.  This is not advocacy for slavery or violence, but a look into cultural evolution and how it differs among civilizations and the effects of intermingling cultures and interests. I have no qualms with being wrong, but I want to be proven wrong, not told I am an idiot for not blindly following your beliefs, so let us begin.\n\nI love it when a post starts out with a good ol' *\"UHHHH IM ONLY INTERESTED IN THE REALS NOT FEELS!\"* Because clearly their position is wholly fact based and not at all in faulty logic.\n\n&gt; I am confused by the notion that slavery held back Africans at a social level.\n\nWell...slavery and the military governments and the genocides and all that other nonsense. This is always a fascinating argument; people look at a multifaceted issue, find one that they have issue with, and pretend it's the *only* issue people think is a cause for something. I guess it's technically a strawman but it's a special kind of one. \n\n&gt; At the time of slavery they were tribal, similar to the Aztecs\n\nThe Aztecs were tribal? That's news to me. That sophisticated system of centralized government must have fooled me.\n\n&gt; while the main players of Europe were in a Victorian age, including the developing USA\n\nYou'll see him jump between time periods regularly. Apparently we're talking about the Scramble for Africa right now in the 1880's but we'll without warning jump to like 1600 and just pretend it's the exact same level of technological disparity.\n\n&gt;  Before the Europeans even arrived, they were already behind in their evolution of civilization. While nations don’t necessarily progress the same, certain notions of aggression and mutuality of interest did evolve in similar manners. Essentially tribal cultures would give way to towns and cities of increased numbers and reduced actions of hostility between neighbors, but instead over a common enemy that was more distinctly different in their appearance and/or culture. Or in Europe’s case, Protestantism versus Catholicism as the primary point of contention or at least as the excuse to raid and conquer.\n\nDude, take off that Whig. \n\nI like the implicit claim that Protestantism vs Catholicism is what brought Europe out of tribalism. I don't feel the motivation to refute Whig bullshit anymore than I do to refute flat earthers so I'll move on from here. I'll let you nerds duke it out in the comments.\n\n\n&gt; Now I am focusing on sub-Saharan Africa, where Europe had not been making contact like Spain with Morocco and Rome with Egypt.\n\n*\"Now you can't use these examples which refute my argument because, uhm, reasons.\"*\n\n&gt; The culture was still many different small tribes with many different gods and very little cooperation, which was a major factor in the eventual enslavement. These tribes would war with each other for sport and religion similar to the Aztecs, and then those captured would be sacrificed to their deities. As most know, numerous slaves later down the line were intended for sacrifice but what the Portuguese offered was always more than enough to bring out the greed in the tribal leadership.\n\nYeah, Europe never had any issues with continent fracturing, cataclysmic religious wars. Ever.\n\n&gt; I would argue that right prior to the incursion of Europe into sub-Sahara Africa, the equivalency was that of the Etruscans at best, and that this area never held a formalized Empire which would have a mutual sense of security through cooperation.\n\nNubians, Aksumite Empire, Sahelian Empire, Benin, Guinea Coast peoples, Mali Kingdom, Zimbabwe, and the Swahili-City States (just for starters) don't real. Timbuktu don't real. \n\n&gt; With this being said, I argue that the sub-Saharan Africans were already very far behind nearly all other cultures in the world, and had Dark Ages level progression at the time.\n\nThe Swahili City-States in the Early Medieval Era could map the entire Indian Ocean wind patterns down to the day and sail from Swahili to freaking China and trade over there. They traded in China, Indochina, Polynesia, the Indian sub-continent, the Middle East, and with other African kingdoms and tribes. Egyptians, Nubians, and Aksumites developed new cross-fertilization processes. The Sahelian empires advanced metallurgy during the \"middle ages.\" Benin was known for sophisticated bronze work in the 16th c. Areas of West Africa had early advanced agronomy (Rice-growing in the American south was also almost entirely an import from the Guinea Coast of Africa. The methods and knowledge were carried with skilled growers into slavery). \n\nThe King of Mali in the early 14th century went on his pilgrimage to Mecca. On his journey with his 60,000 man party he gave away so much gold that it crashed the Mediterranean economy because of the massive inflation. Timbuktu, Gao, and Ife were huge trade hubs that became wealthier than many European cities could even dream of. Great Zimbabwe, in South Africa, domesticated large amounts of animal and traded iron, ivory, and gold acquired from their own territories with its own workers and traded again with other African kingdoms and traded as far as India, China, and Persia. We have archeological evidence that the Africans were trading with East Indian Ocean peoples as early as 300AD!\n\nThis is the core issue of his argument: African kingdoms mostly elected to not traverse that massive desert for expansion when they had a ripe continent right at their fingertips loaded to the brim with gold, iron, diamonds, ivory and etc. When they had huge local, continental, and trans-oceanic trade routes that brought them immense wealth they had no reason to go North. But in that respect they also had no capacity to develop militarily along with the Europeans who, while being \"so advanced\", were really the best at just killing each other a lot and refined that idea more than really anyone else.\n\nIt's the same kind of shit that Native Americans have to deal with. Oh you didn't have WHEELS? How can you be a civilized nation without WHEELS?!?! Well the Native American's had wheels -- they were used regularly on things like toys but on a practical level they had no need for them. Many Central and South American kingdoms, notably the Aztecs and Inca's, lived in heavily mountainous areas and things like donkeys and manpower were far more consistent and efficient than wheels which would have to traverse rocky cliffs and hills. Yeah they didn't have compass' but no one else on Earth could use work a mountain cliff for agriculture like Native American's could with terrace farming.\n\n&gt; Now going into slavery, where the initial push by the Portuguese had issues with navigating the land and dealing with the unknown flora and fauna that brought the natural push for alliances with the locals by using their technologically enhanced wealth to attain their loyalty. They would then use the locals raiding parties to get their stock that they would then ship on to Cuba or the West Indies to be processed. So in this transition the slaves would change from primitive clothing to smocks and pants, some were taught to read and write to bolster their ability to serve their master’s, and they became exposed to the various fundamental elements of a more advanced civilization. Like an intern working inside Google, getting the general idea of the complexity of the business and its processes from a low position while working for those that were experienced and knowledgeable.\n\n&gt; These Africans were pulled kicking and screaming from their homes, and then forced to accelerate past several phases of cultural evolution, like if we were to bring a Roman citizen to the 21st century and they had to completely change their way of thinking. They were given bits and pieces over time that accumulated into Frederick Douglass’s that were leaps ahead intellectually then if they had stayed in Africa, oblivious to the enlightenment on the other side of the equator. So the argument that African-Americans are behind socially due to slavery is incorrect, they are actually ahead of the curve compared to if Europe never went into Africa. This by no means justifies slavery, just like Hitler pulling together a broken nation does not justify the Holocaust, but I believe the argument of forced social delinquency due to slavery is not beneficial to society going forward as it is a false claim, and decisions are better made when the actual facts are understood.\n\n\nYou know I tried to go this entire post dealing with his points factually but this is where I throw my hat in. I can't. This is just literally the most sheltered, lack of perspective bullshit I've ever read in my life. I bet $200 this kid is under 15 years old. It's the only way I accept someone would type this. You know if there's one thing Europeans were there for it wasn't to build them up and show them the light light of the West. It was to brutally extort them and strip them of their resources. They kept them down with brutally oppressive military governments enacted full sale genocide without second thought with the slightest resistance. Thats not building them up you fucking shiteater.\n\nIt wasn't Europe \"bringing civilization to the savages\", it was the slaves being freed and then immediately fucking them over with legal racism. By literally making it illegal for them to buy homes outside of ghettos. They were herded to the inner cities, then the wealthy fled to the suburbs, and they were forced by literal law to be confined to the inner cities. Then they were denied educations, especially post High School. They were denied economic equality. They were denied the ability to even vote in local representatives due to horrible 'voting tests' that were intentionally crafted to be as open ended as possible so that white people would pass and black people would fail. This is literal documented fact, this isn't conspiracy or \"social justice nonsense\" or whatever and this 100+ years of forcing African-Americans down while the rest of America went up in the 20th century American boom has far more to do with \"their situation\" than any of this Whig bullshit.",

I seriously had to check to see if I was still living in the same universe.

It was a strategic victory for the Union, despite numerous mistakes by the ever-timid McLellan that could have made it a much more one-sided affair.  Lincoln had been waiting for some type of Union victory to issue the Proclamation after and he decided that Antietam would do.\n\nIt was issued on January 1, 1863.

I have no objection to the statements that slavery and segregation were legal - they absolutely were, no question - but it's the Holocaust that seems to exist in a grey area of decades of legal debate. It's also a debate that gets at the very heart of what law is and what grants it legitimacy, something that's important not only for questions of the legality of genocide, but as a question of the legitimacy of law more generally. It is, basically, really interesting, and something that no one necessarily has the answer to. I'll go ahead and give you a bit of a spoiler alert for this post - I don't have the answer as to the legality of the Holocaust, but I still want to write about it. At the very least, it shouldn't be classified with slavery and segregation which were blatantly codified into states' laws. The Holocaust wasn't, but that's only part of the problem in determining its legality. \n\nTo illustrate some of the problem with saying whether or not the Holocaust was legal, I'd like to look at the example of Lothar Kreyssig, a judge in charge of mentally handicapped wards of the state living in mental hospitals. After noticing that some of his wards had died after being transferred, he protested their transfer. When that got nowhere, he filed a murder complaint against the head of the Nazi euthanasia program, Philip Bouhler, and ordered that the wards under his care not be transferred. This got him fired, though he suffered no other punishment. What's interesting about his example, though, is that he couched his protests in legal language, arguing that it was illegal to kill his wards because there was no legal precedent or basis for killing wards of the court, and because there was no possibility for appeal. The response to this was that it was legal because this was the Fuhrer's will. Kreyssig's response, in turn, was that simply because the Fuhrer wanted it did not make it legal. \n\nThis is the crux of the issue with the legality of the Holocaust. It's a question of what makes law law, and what constitutes a violation of law. At the beginning of the Holocaust, genocide was not a crime, so it's not a question of it being a violation of international law. The Geneva Conventions applied to prisoners of war, not civilians, and so couldn't be held to be in violation. Genocide was also not banned according to German law, once again showing that that's not an avenue by which one could claim the Holocaust was illegal. As Kreyssig pointed out during the Holocaust, however, on a procedural and substantive level, was \"because I said so\" really a good way to establish law? Was it a valid way to render killings legal?\n\nPart of the problem as well lies with the Nuremberg Trials. These trials were not without controversy, either at the time or now. The crimes people were accused and convicted of were not crimes at the time they were committed, and so the question is clearly raised of the legitimacy of trying them retroactively. However, the fact that the Nuremberg Trials occurred at all suggests that there was something illegal about the Holocaust which could be prosecuted. When reading [the charter of the tribunal](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/imtconst.asp), the most important bit of it for establishing the legality of the Holocaust is in article 6, section C, which states that the court has jurisdiction over crimes against humanity committed \"before or during the war...whether or not in violation of the domestic law of the country where perpetrated.\" What this implies is really interesting. First, it implies that laws about crimes against humanity can be applied retroactively (as in \"we didn't think we needed a rule against this, but you proved us wrong\" and \"you're so awful that we can't just let this slide\"), and second - and more importantly for our purposes - that domestic law didn't necessarily say this was illegal. It's that \"despite domestic law\" bit that's really interesting, and it's that bit that's the most problematic. \n\nThis is the problem. Nazi Germany had the Nuremberg Laws, laws which stripped Jews of their citizenship, their free movement, and their property completely legally. This is in the same category as slavery and Jim Crow - laws which we currently view as barbaric, but which completely legalised these practices. What's not explicitly codified is genocide or mass murder, and as the example of Kreyssig demonstrates, genocide doesn't fit with the Reich's legal system. Equally, speeches like [this one](http://holocaust-history.org/himmler-poznan/speech-text.shtml) by Heinrich Himmler, the Holocaust is \"a great secret\" that can't be spoken of, which implies that they knew full well there was something wrong about it, even while also saying \"We have carried out this most difficult task for the love of our people. And we have taken on no defect within us, in our soul, or in our character.\" The Nuremberg Laws didn't legalise genocide, but neither were there laws rendering it illegal. The basis for extermination, as Kreyssig found out, was simply \"Because Hitler said so,\" which sounds suspiciously like something that really, really shouldn't be the basis of a legal system. However, technically, that rendered the Holocaust legal under Nazi law.\n\nYou would think that would settle the matter, but once again, we look at Nuremberg. American judges at Nuremberg rejected \"I said so\" as a legal basis, instead stating that Nazi Germany was a criminal state, and so its laws were all invalid, including the ones that Hitler said were totes real laws. Therefore, the Holocaust could be prosecuted. \n\nStep back a moment, though. Beyond the question of Nuremberg's legitimacy and whether calling a state a \"criminal state\" means courts can apply law retroactively, saying that Hitler's \"because I said so\" laws couldn't be laws because they were criminal raises the really awkward question of how one determines what law is. What Germany did was very bad, yes, but does that legitimate throwing out its laws and calling them not-law? What does that say for other countries which might also have relied on \"because I said so\" or passed immoral laws, like slavery or Jim Crow? Essentially, the choice legal theorists face when asked the question \"was the Holocaust legal\" is this: if the Holocaust was legal, then Nuremberg was illegitimate, but law has its basis in legislation, and leaders have the ability to have laws within their countries. If the Holocaust was illegal, then law is inherently subjective and based on something other than legislation, raising the question of what law is legitimate, or indeed, whether any law could really be considered legitimate.\n\nI did warn you that I didn't have an answer here. \n\nMy point, though, is that this is a brutally complex question, and one which the meme represents. The Holocaust was not legal in the same sense that slavery and Jim Crow were legal. It was not codified into laws explicitly, even though Jews could be sentenced to death for the slightest crimes. It was also something that was a bit of a national secret rather than being blatant, once again separating it from segregation and slavery. The Nuremberg Tribunal also suggests that it was illegal (and, indeed, it would have to be if the Tribunal was to have any legitimacy at all). But, as I said, there is the problem that Hitler was the ultimate source of law in the Third Reich, and that he said this was okay. The Holocaust was legal iff \"because Hitler said so\" is a legitimate source of law, and if that's not, there's a whole beehive of questions to answer. \n\nSources!\n\n[\"Contemporary Legal Lessons from the Holocaust\"](http://jcpa.org/article/contemporary-legal-lessons-from-the-holocaust/) by Michael Bazyler is a good introduction to the debate around the legality of the Holocaust and some of the theoretical positions and implications of legality/illegality.\n\n[\"Legal Aspects of Child Persecution During the Holocaust\"](http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0002-7138(09)60553-7/pdf) by Milton Kestenberg also provides a great insight into the legal aspects of the Holocausts and particularly deportations.\n\n[\"The Law as an Accelerator of Genocide\"](http://www.un.org/en/holocaustremembrance/docs/paper13.shtml) by David Matas talks about the role lawyers, judges, and the higher ups in Germany played in helping or hindering genocide.\n\n[\"The Nuremberg Trial and International Law\"](http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/itsold/papers/public/miscellaneous/printingproblems/nurem.pdf) by George A.

        "text": "[This post](https://np.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/3gczdy/john_bodkin_adams_what_the_heck_happened_with_his/) from /r/UnresolvedMysteries is an interesting one, both in the story it tells about John Bodkin Adams and his trial (which actually isn't as mysterious as the post implies, but that's neither here nor there), and in the question it doesn't mean to raise about who the most successful serial killer of all time was. This post is pretty clear in its assertion that Adams was the most successful serial killer, but ultimately, the answer is going to come down to how one defines \"successful serial killer.\" The OP in the post is kind enough to provide a definition that they'd like to use - most number of victims without getting caught - and I'm happy to use that, but I think it also lacks nuance and understanding of why serial killers do what they do. So, to be fair, I'm going to look at the claim first using the OP's definition, and then a definition that I like more. \n\nSetting aside the question of whether or not Adams was guilty of the murders he's been accused of - something which I think is also a more debatable case than the post implies - is John Bodkin Adams the most prolific serial killer who was never convicted? One immediate problem is that we don't necessarily know. Modern crime recording may be able to tell us about some modern serial killers, but before these sorts of records existed, a person could theoretically travel around killing people and not be recognised as being a serial killer. Medieval stories of werewolves or vampires could theoretically refer to serial killers or maniacal axe murderers. Others may have been protected by social station or an ability to disappear. Quite simply, deciding who is the most successful serial killer of all time is an exercise in futility.\n\nHowever, even with recorded, known serial killers, Adams is not the most successful by the definition the OP used. While Adams is suspected of having killed more than 160 people with his wily, medical ways, he's not even the most successful homicidal doctor. If we want the most prolific *known* serial killer who was not convicted of being a serial killer, one of our best options is [John \"Liver-eating\" Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver-Eating_Johnson), winner of both the \"Most likely to be a serial killer based on name alone\" award as well as the \"most passive-aggressive Wikipedia page\" award. Active starting around 1843, Mr. Liver-eating doesn't fit our usual understanding or image of a serial killer, but he does fit the [FBI's definition](https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/serial-murder/serial-murder-1#two), seeing as he killed more than two people (the upper estimates of his body count level out around 300, though that's unlikely to actually be true) and did so with periods of normalcy in between. More importantly, and perhaps uniquely in a collection of prolific serial killers, Mr. Johnson was seen as a folk hero as the target of his killings was not white settlers going west, but rather the Native Americans that said settlers didn't like in the first place. This prevented him from ever facing prosecution, and indeed, led to him having statues made of him. Now, it could be argued that Johnson wasn't a serial killer because of the tensions with Native Americans at the time. However, Johnson was not a soldier. While he had served in the Mexican-American War, he was a deserter, and killed Native Americans for his own purposes, not under the orders of anyone else. He may not be typical, true, but he matches the definition of a serial killer. \n\nEven beyond his own body count, what Johnson demonstrates is the difficulty in discerning the truth about serial killers who were never convicted of their crimes. Both Johnson and Adams have a great deal of speculation about their numbers, with Adams' body count being determined based on \"suspicious deaths,\" which, considering he was a doctor working with dying old people, could also be inflated. The fact that both were active before there was decent record-keeping or technology to determine a cause of death, too, distorts how successful they actually were. It's partly that uncertainty that makes me look askance at defining \"success\" based on \"not getting caught.\"\n\nThere's another element to it as well, though. While serial killers have widely varying motivations, for some, the publicity was part of the thrill. Certainly a killer like the Zodiac Killer who specifically sent letters to the media to keep attention on him and his killings wouldn't necessarily see the publicity from a trial as a bad thing. Ted Bundy, too, thrived on publicity and attention, and while he probably would have preferred not to get caught, didn't seem to mind it too terribly much either. It gave him an audience and attention. The list of serial killers that sought attention as one of their goals as a killer is long enough that, once again, I hesitate to say that \"getting caught\" means someone is less successful as a serial killer. Indeed, for someone like Charles Manson, I'd say it adds to the successfulness specifically because it gave that killer a platform from which to spread their particular brand of crazy. \n\nSo how then would I define success? Ultimately, I think that comes down to individual motivations. A killer is most successful when they fulfil their personal goals, whatever those might be. Liver-eating Johnson's goals, for instance, involved murdering Native Americans until he felt better about himself, which he accomplished, so he'd likely be on the upper end of successful serial killers. [Giulia Tofana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giulia_Tofana) who became a folk hero for women in bad relationships to the point where even when it became clear that she was poisoning people was still adamantly defended by the people of Rome probably met her goals for her life. To give a modern example, [Pedro Lopez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_L%C3%B3pez_(serial_killer)), despite getting caught and convicted likely considers himself a success because of his obscenely high body count (over 300) and the fact that he was released from prison. And yes, John Bodkin Adams who profited immensely from his patients' deaths probably met his own goals as well, and could probably be considered hugely successful.\n\nEssentially, when evaluating historical figures and their \"success,\" there's a lot to consider. When looking at serial killers and evaluating their \"success,\" that complexity just explodes. Body counts and not getting caught alone don't reflect human motivation, nor do they reflect motivations throughout history. Instead, we have to look at people on their own terms and realise that one size doesn't fit all.\n\nOr just not call serial killers \"successful.\" That's cool too.\n\nSources!\n\nI admit that I mostly skimmed Wikipedia for interesting stories and used their body count list, but [here's](http://www.doctorsreview.com/history/john-bodkin-adams/) a good article about Adams specifically. The FBI website is also a great resource for learning about serial killer motivations, which I then extended into my discussion about evaluating serial killers.",

Certainly getting the largest amount of seats can be called a win, but what does it get you without a majority? Not very much. In the U.S., winning the legislature means you have control, in the Weimar, you won't unless you have a majority, which the nazis were very far from having.\n\n&gt;So then if you win a plurality, but not a majority, you can make a coalition government, and because your party has the most seats in that coalition, you have more influence and leverage. You could change definitions and say this is what it means to win. Except that the nazis still couldn't do this because the right wing parties that tried to form a coalition couldn't do it\n\n&gt;So now you can redefine winning again to mean having a plurality regardless of ability to form a coalition government. And you can do this, but that's not remotely close to what most people think of when they say \"the republicans won that election!\"\n",

        "text": "Spike apparently has a show all about the \"rebel\" king, Tutankhamen, called \"Tut.\" I haven't seen it. It's not really my cup of tea. I've seen the [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsO2KCje6l4), though, and it's delightful in that whole you-wanted-to-make-Game-of-Thrones-didn't-you kind of way. It's also historically inaccurate.\n\nFor example, at the 13 second mark, we see a man's execution and Ben Kingsley - playing Grand Vizier Ay - commenting that \"this is what it means to be pharoah\" (as I said, the riffing of Game of Thrones is merciless). The execution is conducted by [this dude](http://i.imgur.com/KcdUAv1.png) with a sword in armour disemboweling a hapless prisoner. The trouble is, though, that this wasn't how ancient Egyptian executions were conducted. If you'll recall, the Egyptians put a great deal of stock in the afterlife and about the importance of the body in the afterlife. It's why they put so much effort into tombs and mummification and preservation - they needed these things in the afterlife, and indeed, going to the good afterlife was a lot of the point of living in Egypt. A proper punishment reflected this belief in the sanctity of the body and that disrupting the transition to a happy afterlife was the worst thing that could happen. What was the solution to that?\n\nImpalement. Yay impalement.\n\nThere are numerous writings from across hundreds of years detailing how pharaohs (including Tutankhamen's father, Akhenaten) impaled prisoners of war and people that they believed to be traitorous for one reason or another. The impalements involved driving long bits of pointy wood into the stomach and then waiting for the person to die a long, painful death. In addition to the havoc wreaked by having internal organs mashed up by a spike, ancient Egyptians saw the spike itself as pinning the person's *ka* to earth, preventing them from journeying to the afterlife at all, a fate worse than death. Disembowelment would not have accomplished that, and was not the preferred execution method of the discerning pharaoh. \n\nWe also have [baby Tut's hairstyle](http://i.imgur.com/GKRWjbb.png), once again an example of how dreadfully out of touch with his inner Egyptian this incarnation of Tutankhamen seems to be. On the one hand, it does look like the show got Tutankhamen's age of ascension right. Tut took the throne around eight or nine years old, and I'll accept that this kid is around that age. However, his hair is wrong. Ancient Egyptian children's hair looked something like [this](http://factsanddetails.com/media/2/20120215-347px-Khaemwaset_in_QV44.jpg), with a lock that was braided or tied, and the rest of the head shaved. Once a child hit puberty, that lock was shaved or the rest of the hair allowed to grow, depending on the sex of the child. However, there certainly would have been none of this luscious locks nonsense before puberty. \n\nAnd speaking of hair, there's also [this image](http://i.imgur.com/eN76s5I.png) of Tutankhamen all grown up where he once again has the whole sink-into-my-hair look going on. While hair styles absolutely changed over the course of Egyptian history, by the time of Ramesses II roughly seventy years after Tutankhamen's death, short hair or no hair was the style for men. Indeed, [busts](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/T%C3%AAte_de_Tout%C3%A2nkhamon_enfant_%28mus%C3%A9e_du_Caire_Egypte%29.jpg) of Tutankhamen show him as having this short hair, not long hair. Men would wear wigs, but I'm fairly certain that that actor is not wearing a wig.\n\nOoo! And on the subject of physical appearance, [this](http://i.imgur.com/i9Uohq7.png) is not generally something that a person with multiple sclerosis who is forced to walk with a cane does. Or someone suffering from severe malaria. Or...just really, Tutankhamen was one of the posterboys for why incest was a bad idea, and his physical handicaps would have made it impossible for him to go into battle like the trailer for the show suggests. Even more than that, while there were battles depicted inside his tomb, it's unlikely external invasion was his biggest concern as pharaoh. His father was a tad notorious for completely upending the religious system in Egypt, and Tutankhamen would have been dealing with the domestic and economic fallout of this. His chief concerns would have been the crumbling economy and threat of civil war. That's what he likely would have been yelling to his advisers about, not just invading Nubians. \n\nThere's an overarching problem as well, and that's the question of political intrigue and Tutankhamen's death. As I said, the show seems to be more interested in reproducing Game of Thrones than historical accuracy, and its focus on political games seems no different. I don't mean to say that there wasn't political intrigue in ancient Egyptian courts - there absolutely was - but rather that focusing on this intrigue doesn't accurately tell the story of Tutankhamen's death. While initial theories were that he had been assassinated, and were based on the fact that there was a giant hole in his head, the current consensus is that he wasn't killed, but likely died of some sort of illness, though what illness, no one is sure. What is known is that he had a badly broken leg and a severe form of malaria, neither of which is fatal on its own, but which together could have been enough to kill him. None of this, of course, seems to be discussed in the trailer, which prefers to present a manly-man image of Tutankhamen that is in no way accurate. \n\nAlso, is it just me, or did Tut get whiter over the course of the trailer? Weird.",

The \"ecological\" theory described here was proposed by Michael Harner and is not universally accepted.\n\n\"Not universally accepted\" is putting it lightly, but I'll let de Salcedo write about it in her own words.\n\n&gt; &gt; If there was ever an argument against eating an all-vegetarian diet it's the Aztec civilization (AD 1427 - 1519). By the Paleolithic era, all large native herbivores in the Mesoamerican basin had been hunted into extinction, so when agriculture began there it was not accompanied by the simultaneous domestication of livestock found in other cradles of civilization. Undaunted, the early Mexicans cobbled together a barely adequate diet of nixtamalized maize... beans, and chilies enriched with an occasional zap of protein from iguanas, lake scum, and insects. The only two kinds of livestock were reserved for nobles: turkeys and Chihuahuas... It was thus perhaps inevitable that the protein-hungry Aztecs' gaze alighted on the one large mammal that continued to grace the Valley of Mexico: man.\n\nLet's start with the claim that the Aztecs/Mesoamericans (she uses the two terms interchangeably) had no potential domesticable animals. Eugene Hunn, in [*Did the Aztecs Lack Potential Animal Domesticates?*](http://www.jstor.org/stable/644004) (JSTOR) writes,\n\n&gt; The alleged absence of domesticable mammalian herbivores finds no support in the relevant zoogeographic references (Grzimek 1975; Leopold 1972; Walker 1968). Although it is impossible to prove that a given species could have been domesticated when in fact it was not, we nevertheless may identify animals as potential domesticates that share salient characteristics with species domesticated under comparable conditions elsewhere. \n\nHe goes on to conclude that \"I suspect there was no \"failure\" [to domesticate animals] at all; rather, a choice of more efficient means of nutrient provision through intensive agriculture. The underutilization of animal protein resources in Mesoamerica strongly suggests that the Aztec need for animal foods has been greatly exaggerated. Thus, Harner's deus ex machina for Aztec cannibalism is called into question.\" \n\nAs for the characterization of the Aztec diet as \"barely adequate\", a cursory glance of the Wikipedia page on [Aztec cuisine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_cuisine) demonstrates a richness of foods and cooking methods that doesn't sound cobbled together in the slightest. It also mentions the presence of fish and wild game in their diet, though not as a major part. Amusingly, it also mentions Harner's theory at the end, as well as how it's since been shown to be based on unfounded assumptions.\n\n&gt; &gt; What ensued was one of the most bizarre and bloodthirsty warrior cultures on the planet... which kept the elites (nobles, priests, and soldiers) well nourished and the masses (peasants) weak and docile... unlike other military imperialists, the Mesoamericans had little interest in the traditional spoils of war - property, goods, power - and except for collecting regular tributes, most of them edible, allowed their conquests to return to business as usual, with ruling structures intact. This was because they had already obtained the natural resource they most wanted: a fresh harvest of enemy soldiers.\n\nI want to point out here that de Salcedo says the Aztecs recieved tributes of **food**, and yet they were so starved they still wanted to eat enemy soldiers? Okay.\n\nBernard Ortiz de Montellano provides a very thorough refutation of Harner's theory. [In summary](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1746929),\n\n&gt; It has been proposed that Aztec human sacrifice and cannibalism can best be explained as a response to population pressure and famine. The greatest amount of cannibalism, however, coincided with times of harvest, not with periods of scarcity, and is better explained as a thanksgiving. Tenochtitlan received large quantities of food tribute and engaged in intensive (chinampa) agriculture. These two sources alone would have provided enough to feed practically the entire population of the city. The Aztecs also consumed various animals and insects that were good protein sources. The amount of protein available from human sacrifice would not have made a significant contribution to the diet. Cannibalism was not motivated by starvation but by a belief that this was a way to commune with the gods.  \n\nde Montellano also points out that Harner's fixation on animal protein as *the* source of dietary protein is very ethnocentric and discounts the large variety of foods available to the Aztecs, not only in terms of agricultural products but also varieties of wild game and the nutritious nature of insect protein. Additionally, a quick listen to the [AskHistorians podcast](http://hwcdn.libsyn.com/p/5/c/3/5c30f0d0e9baea1d/AHP_003_Mesoamerican_Sacrifice.mp3?c_id=6766628&amp;expiration=1439212615&amp;hwt=80f2f3d119dadbeb93b8afa700e200b9) (around 07:20) emphasizes the important religious nature of human sacrifices. This is also the *only* mention of cannibalism in the whole podcast. \n\n&gt; &gt; If the everyday Aztec warrior diet lacked the soul-satisfying experience of masticating a hunk of thermally processed mammal muscle, feast days more than made up for it... It's estimated that, over its century reign, the Cannibal Empire devoured more than one million men, women, and children.\n\nAgain, the insistence on the \"soul-satisfying\" nature of large hunks of meat is ethnocentric and assumes that this craving has some sort of universal, possibly biological, basis. de Montellano again points out that most of the festivals involving human sacrifice clustered around the corn harvest, with the biggest consumption of human flesh taking place in the middle of the corn harvest (month 15, Panquetzaliztli). He includes a table [comparing the agricultural cycle to Aztec ritual ceremonies](http://i.imgur.com/XR7gt0B.png) (imgur), and also talks about the ceremonies in Quecholli (month 14), dedicated to the god of the hunt Mixcoatl. During that month, human sacrifices were indeed conducted with its victims consumed afterward, but only at the conclusion of a large hunt for wild game.\n\nAs for the 'one million' figure, [Harner's own paper](http://www.jstor.org/stable/643526) claims that prior estimates of the numbers of victims were scaled down, saying,\n\n&gt; Woodrow Borah, who is now possibly the leading authority on the demography of Central Mexico around the time of the Conquest, has given me permission to cite his new unpublished estimate of the number of persons sacrificed in Central\nMexico in the fifteenth century; 250,000 per year, or equivalent to one percent of the total population (Borah, personal communication). This quarter of a million annual figure, according to Borah (personal communication), is consistent with the existence of thousands of temples throughout the Triple Alliance alone and with the sacrifice of an estimated one thousand to three thousand persons at each temple per year.\n\nI'll point to a [previous comment in BadHistory](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2xacnu/why_did_mesoamericans_sacrifice_people_and_why/cozu528) regarding Aztec human sacrifice. In particular I find /u/Ahhuatl's breakdown of how fast sacrifices would have to be carried out in order to hit the \"conservative\" estimate of 20,000 people killed in four days (1.15 minutes for each captive, start-to-finish, 24 hours a day, for four days) very compelling as a counterargument. \n\nAs for other fun tidbits from scholars commenting on Harner's work, here's [George Pierre Castille](http://www.jstor.org/stable/675886):\n\n&gt; I think that a height (literally) of explanatory excess is reached when Harner says, \"Even such little touches as the steepness of the pyramid's steps becomes understandable if one keeps in mind the need for efficiency in rolling the bodies\ndown from the sacrificial altars to the multitudes below\" (Harner 1977:132). One rolled down the Pyramid of the Jaguar (Temple 1) at Tikal would probably impact with enough force to do away with anyone in the \"multitude\" who got in its path. If we use the \"how steep was my pyramid\" approach, we are left with the conclusion that the Maya were the truly voracious people eaters since it was they who built most appropriately for chuting the bodies along. While we have evidence of sacrifice and probable cannibalism (ritual or otherwise) from Teotihuacan perhaps we can safely conclude that it was not significant since those pyramids were not well designed for chuting?\n\nde Montellano, again, [regarding Harner's use of skull racks to provide estimates for numbers](http://www.jstor.org/stable/676325):\n\n&gt; Harner states (1977:122) that there were 136,000 skulls on this tzompantli based on the following description by Andres de Tapia (1971:538), a Spanish conqueror: \"Sixty or seventy very tall beams spaced a little less than a 'vara de medir' (.84 m) with rods from top to bottom. Each rod was drilled through five skulls\" (author's translation). Tapia and a companion multiplied the number of rods by five to reach the total number... The assumption of 70 poles arranged in seven rows of ten poles would result in 63 rods with five skulls each. Each plane would contain 315 skulls. Tapia does not describe the vertical spacing between the planes, but another description (Duran 1967:23) gives the spacing as .42 m. To accommodate 1.36 x 10^5 skulls with this spacing would require the vertical poles to be 181 m high, beyond the height of any known tree.\n\nIn conclusion, de Salcedo really ought to have known better than to pick a thoroughly discredited theory for the reasons behind ritualistic cannibalism in the Aztec Empire. Alas, stories of voracious cannibals probably make for better sales than good history.",

This one quip sets the tone for the entire comment chain.\n\n&gt; I'd rather have a WWI game from the German perspective. Germany had arguably the best infantry in the war but was really hamstrung by its other allies in the Central Powers.\n\nSwing and a miss right off the bat. I don't know what \"best infantry in the war\" *even fucking means*. Like how do you even begin to quantify that. We can say that there were certainly less organized and less motivated 'infantry' (as if it's total war and we're selecting infantry units), like the Austro-Hungarian K.u.K. for instance which infamously had 3 branches with 3 separate main languages and 3 separate logistic and command structures. However when we're talking about countries that actually had functioning military's this is very tough to say. \n\nWhat about the Russian soldier who single handedly took out the Austro-Hungarians *while simultaneously being attacked with the full force of 3 other great powers*? Or the British who had the most professional army at the start of the war and the best rifle drill in the world? Or the French who in 1915, **before literally anyone else on Earth for at least a year**, not only developed squad level infiltration tactics they implemented said doctrine. It would take the British until 1917 and the Germans until 1918.\n\n&gt; But as you were saying with WW1, the beginning was definitely an attempt by the Germans to repeat the Franco-Prussian war of maneuver, which is why they covered to much initial ground so quickly, but defensive technology had caught up. \n\nThis idea that trench warfare was somehow inevitable because \"defense &gt; offense\" is horseshit. It needs to stop. Seriously I have zero clue where this originated from but I'm going to guess a 30-something year old man with a tight polo and too much grease in his hair who coaches the baseball team and teaches the history course on the side had something to do with it. Literally every high school I've ever seen has this guy by the way, what's up with that?\n\nAnyways trench warfare was a *strategic* decision, not a tactical nor an operational one. \"Defense\" did not \"overtake offense\" or any sort of interpretation. The Germans had one goal in mind -- hold off the West and crush the East, that was their 1915 strategy. So they retreated to the most defensible positions possible in France (which they could due to their depth in enemy territory) and simply dug in on the highest, most dry ground. Unfortunately for the French, however, the Germans were occupying the Briey-Longwy region. That means roughly 80% of their iron, 60% of their coal, and nearly 50% of their steel production was instantly cut off. They had no more industry and no more economy. Even worse the Meuse river was threatened and only held off by the Verdun forts. If that is broken through there is no more natural barrier stopping the Germans from flooding into the plains of Southern France. This means, tragically, that the French were forced to constantly maintain offensive posture. They could not simply allow their most wealthy regions to be occupied like that, both politically and economically. So they had to fight uphill, literally, against the most defensible positions in their country...held by the enemy.\n\n&gt; That's interesting, why would you say they had the best infantry, I would be sure there was only marginal difference in quality of bolt action riflemen in trenches rather than numerical supremacy?\n\nDealt with this above. I just love the video gamey bullshit seeping through every word. \"marginal difference in . . .bolt action riflemen.\" I feel like I'm reading a Total War description.\n\n&gt; They didnt surrender often, had the least mutinies, and there overall organization was much better. They got something like 20 miles outside of paris before they stopped gaining ground. They also responded quicker. The Austro-Hun army could not even take Serbia which was the first country to have war declared on and was only defeated when the German military took over the invasion. Also infantry were almost the only measure of army, besides having the best generals, The armies had artillery, very small air forces, and a huge amount of rifleman.\n\nNo. Just no.\n\nThey got outside Paris because the French strategy was to withdraw and attrit them. \n\n\"They responded faster\" literally means nothing, the French mobilization was faster in general and at worst on par with the Germans. \n\n\"Less mutinies\" is horseshit. The French had one mutiny which merely protested a shitty General not the war itself. The German mutiny came in the form of the entire surface navy revolting along with almost every home base and the occupation of Berlin by revolutionary mutiny forces. Mutiny literally brought a faltering, crumbling Germany to her knees.\n\n&gt; I love he idea of a ww1 game and if you were to play as he Germans hat opens up possibilities to play as the storm troopers.\n\nM-M-MUH STROSSTRUPPEN!11!1!!\n\nOh boy I'd love to play as a soldier with absolutely no artillery support because my commanders are too busy deciding between the capsule or suck-starting their Luger. Like I'm not even kidding this actually would be fun but not for what he describes. Stormtroopers had initial success mostly because they outnumbered their enemies about 5:1 or 6:1 and were targeting the least defended areas of the line. Well it turns out that:\n\n1. They were undefended for a reason\n\n2. When you bypass the strong points **you should probably go back and hit the strong points now that you encircle them instead of driving on**\n\nSo what this game would entail is starting out strong and thinking you got dis as you massively outnumber the enemy. Then you get deep behind enemy lines, you have zero artillery support and you are fighting right in their wheelhouse with reserves, artillery, and tanks hitting you. And you're in the open with no defenses. No artillery, did I mention? No airplanes. Very few tanks. And you're starving. You've been starving for weeks it feels like and they're eating *steak* and *drinking rum.* Eventually you just gorge yourself on the food as your unit breaks down and eventually captured.\n\n&gt; What I would like to see is an accurate representation of how close and face to face battle was when one side made it to the others trench. Many of the guns were used as melee weapons along with bayonets and trench spikes and he trenches were often flooded, muddy , or falling apart If a game developer could recreate the claustrophobic feeling of fighting in a trench I would buy his game in a heart beat.\n\nThis part is actually true. Andy Simpson's *Life in the Trenches in the First World War* describes these situations so vividly. Whatever I found enough things to be pedantic about anyways here's a bunch of books. \n\n *Through German Eyes: The Battle of the Somme* by Christopher Duffy, *The First World War: Germany and Austria-Hungary. 1914-1918* by Holger Herwig, *The Marne: The Opening of the First World War* by Herwig again, *Pyrrhic Victory: French Strategy and Operations in the Great War* by Robert Doughty, and Martin Middlebrooks legendary work *The Kaisers Battle*. Hew Strachans *The First World War: To Arms* is also great as a source on non Western Front things. *Tommy: The British Soldier on the Western Front* by Richard Holmes as well.\n",

        "text": "Anastacia Marx de Salcedo's book, *Combat-Ready Kitchen*, is all about how the drive to develop military rations has, in turn, strongly influenced the production of processed foods in the US. It's certainly an interesting read, but I had to stop reading at Chapter 4, which attempts to provide a brief history of combat rations. Unfortunately, said history is riddled with stereotypes, myths, and straight made-up fantasies.\n\nBefore we start: this is my first BadHistory post, and I am no historian, so any further elaboration or corrections are very welcome. If people want me to give more detail on the rest of this chapter, I'll be happy to. Quotes from de Salcedo will be formatted as \"double quotes\", \n\n&gt; &gt; like so.\n\nI'm not going to touch her section on prehistory, where she claims that the \"herders\" (her word for nomadic peoples) were not \"ready to give up their inner wildmen\". She also has a bizarre, gendered, biotruth-ey theory in which she imagines a supposed \"nagging campaign\" wherein the \"wives\" of hunter-gatherers \"wanted real estate\" because the hunter-gatherer lifestyle was always a hard-scrabble life, characterized by barely succumbing to starvation, always. The only reason I do so is that she has the decency to label it a crackpot theory (and maybe because it might be equally at home in BadSocialScience).\n\nThe single paragraph I want to point out is where she starts talking about the Mongols (page 43 of my copy), because that's the most obviously bullshit part. She writes:\n\n&gt; &gt; After the Mongol Empire's peak... the nomadic lifestyle, with its tents and ruminants, went out of style, absorbed into the great teeming cities with their grain-based economies. \n\nShe doesn't define \"went out of style\", though she implies that the nomadic lifestyle has since faded away into obscurity, which doesn't quite jive with the existence of contemporary nomadic peoples. True, the nomadic lifestyle is not the lifestyle for the majority of people on the planet, but then again this was not the case even during the Mongol Empire, so I have no idea what she means. She then goes on to speak as if there are no longer any nomadic groups in existence, so I guess she doesn't know that they're still around?\n\n&gt; &gt; Echoes [of the nomadic lifestyle] remain in ancient antipathies expressed as food prejudices: the Chinese distaste for milk and dairy products, staples of the Mongols who conquered them;\n\nFrom the *Cambridge World History of Food*, \n\n&gt; Equally early on in human history, however, a fundamental split occurred in the history and culture of dairy consumption because, as already noted, drinking more than very small quantities of milk causes the majority of the world's adult population to suffer digestive problems. It has been estimated that although more than 96 percent of northern European peoples are able to digest milk, some 50 to 75 percent of Africans, Indians, Near Eastern Asians, eastern Europeans, and virtually all Asian and Native American peoples cannot digest it... Such a starkly biological account, however, does not explain the powerful rejection of milk among many Asian peoples and needs to be supplemented with cultural factors. One suggestion is that Chinese agricultural practices worked to exclude milk from the culture; because planting took place year-round, primarily with human labor in areas of high population density, there were few draft animals that could have provided milk... An alternative hypothesis, and one, apparently, traditionally held by Chinese people, is that the aversion to milk arose from the desire to distinguish themselves from the nomads on the northern borders of China, who drank fermented mare's milk (Chang 1977). It does seem that milk products had become a feature of the diet of the northern Chinese aristocracy between the Han and Sung periods, but it appears that, after the ensuing period of Mongolian rule, milk definitely acquired a barbarian reputation (Chang 1977).\n\nSo I can excuse her partially, but the problem here is that de Salcedo paints the Chinese aversion towards dairy as a *direct* consequence of the Mongolian invasion, while there are more factors at play than simple association with the \"barbarians\".\n\n&gt; &gt; the Muslim and Jewish - the Semites were the original wanderers - prohibition against swine (animals unable to digest grass, resistant to herding, and not built for trekking), which was an instinctive sneer at the livestock of the enemy; \n\nI should note here that de Salcedo used the term \"herders\" to refer to nomadic peoples previously in the chapter, and I can only assume she is doing the same with the word \"wanderers\" here. While describing the Roman Republic and Empire, she claims that the meat of choice was pork, and so here the pig is \"the livestock of the enemy\", despite the Roman Empire no longer existing in the form she describes by the time Islam appeared. She handily defines the Roman Republic and Empire as \"509 BC - AD 476\" (no mention of where these dates came from), and considering the Prophet Muhammad was born some time around 570 CE, it doesn't make sense for her to claim that swine was the livestock of the only people she describes as having kept pigs. Unless all swineherding societies were their enemies? I digress.\n\nThough she is correct in that nomadic or semi-nomadic pastorialism has a long history in the Middle East, the idea that the prohibition against pork is supposed to be a \"sneer\" at agricultural societies is fantasy. None of the theories that I have encountered regarding prohibitions against consuming pork suggest even a fraction of the motivation as coming from a desire to slight agriculturalists. Richard Lobban, in an article titled [*Pigs and Their Prohibition*](http://www.jstor.org/stable/164052) (JSTOR link) writes\n\n&gt;  One school of thought [regarding the prohibition] is provided by the religious explanations themselves, which state simply that the taboo was revealed by God/Allah/Yahweh to his several prophets and no further discussion is required or encouraged. More reflective interpretations can be found in the important work on this subject by Douglas (1966:41-57). She raises and criticizes three hypotheses. One is that the taboo is simply arbitrary, and it seeks to instill discipline and unity among the religious followers. Douglas also proposes an allegorical explanation that projects opposing forces of good/evil and right/wrong, so that mere mortals will have a degree of divine guidance in their lives. Her third explanation states that the taboo emerged in an effort to determine in-group/out-group identities for religio-ethnic reinforcement. (pg. 57-8)\n\nLobban goes on to point out that both Islam and Judaism are hardly the first in the region to have prohibitions against eating pork, and theorizes that \n\n&gt; By the time of the Egyptian New Kingdom (16th century B.C.), there may already have been a formal taboo, at least for the nobility... The historical reconstruction of the Jewish prophet Moses places him in the role of a high-ranking civil servant during the reign of Pharaoh Ramses II, thus exposing him to the upper-class food preferences and prohibitions. In the context of conflict within the Egyptian ruling class, Moses fled with his followers into the wilderness of the Sinai but saw no reason to abandon this already established taboo. (pg. 59)\n\nSetting aside the plausability of his theory, at the very least it points out that the Egyptians, which de Salcedo classifies as an agricultural society, had a partial prohibition against the eating of pork before either of these groups, which makes her theory that taboos against swine flesh are a \"dig\" at agricultural societies laughable.\n\n&gt; &gt; and even our own fetishization of the juicy steak, a hidden reference to our barbarian past (the Angles, from whom the Anglo-Saxons descended, were cattle herders). \n\nSurely a more direct explanation is that meat used to be very expensive and a meal for the rich, and that the mass availability of meat is a relatively modern phenomenon, therefore the association of meat with luxury still stands. \n\n&gt; &gt; The Mongol legacy also persists in the powdered milk and jerky that still stock soldiers' rucksacks today.\n\nMostly I want to point out that earlier, on page 38, de Salcedo says that the Egyptians supplied their soldiers with preserved fish, which she calls \"a rations revolution\". Clearly she's aware that the issuing of preserved meats is not a purely nomadic tradition, so I don't really understand how she can turn around and call it a part of the Mongol legacy four pages later.\n\nThat was one paragraph. It gets far worse when she talks about the Aztecs for the next two pages! (Hint: she calls it the \"Cannibal Empire\", and suggests that the reason for its supposed prevalence of cannibalism is because of its otherwise vegetarian diet used to keep the lower classes malnourished. No joke.)\n\neta: [it's up!](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3ggpqh/combatready_kitchen_pt_2_the_aztec_civilization/)",

Let's look at some Indian Jewish history:\n\n&gt;After WWII, the rise of Indian nationalism made Jews feel less comfortable because they were identified with the English by the Indians. India's Jewish population declined dramatically starting in the 1940s with heavy immigration to Israel, England and the United States. This is where most Indian Jews live today. \n\nhttp://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/India.html\n\nThis is not religiously-motivated persecution, but it still sounds an awful lot like persecution to me. Note however that Jews were not the only group that faced this sort of persecution; many [economically powerful ethnic minorities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleman_minority) have faced resentment, especially when they were privileged by an occupying power.\n\n&gt;When India became independent of Britain in 1947 and Israel established itself as a nation in 1948 and with the heightened nationalism and emphasis in the Partition of India of Hindu and Muslim identities, most of Cochin's Jews emigrated from India.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochin_Jews#1660_to_Independence\n\nSame deal here. \n\n&gt;Given their success under the British colonial government, many Bene Israel prepared to leave India at independence in 1947, as it appeared that nationalism and the emphasis on indigenous religions would mean fewer opportunities for them. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bene_Israel\n\nDitto, and actually treading on European anti-Semitism (their religion made them \"alien\" and meant that they could not be True Indians (TM)).\n\nAlthough this quote specifically mentions *Hindu* identity, it asserts that all of India is free from anti-Semitism, which is false. [Goa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sephardic_Jews_in_India) was extremely anti-Semitic under Portuguese rule, for instance, and relations between India's tiny Jewish minority and large Muslim minority deteriorated sharply after the establishment of Israel in 1948. Also, just because religious anti-Semitism was rare among Hindus doesn't mean that they didn't experience persecution for economic, cultural, and nationalistic reasons; in Europe, Roma Gypsies follow the religion of their neighbors but still faced a ton of suspicion for being \"foreign.\"\n\nA good example of anti-Semitic bad history from India can be seen here: https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3g9mvj/khazars_ii_brahmin_vindaloo/\n\n*This is a followup to my prior post.*",

The comment thread goes on to discuss the various ways in which women couldn't understand the world they lived in, culminating in [this absolute marvel of a comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/38ufwh/have_there_ever_been_any_major_violent_uprisings/cry7lxk) that decides that woman can't have violent uprisings because they have periods. Glorious.\n\nLet's have a look at the original claim, though, namely that women couldn't have rebelled because they didn't know they were oppressed. To be clear, I'm not going to claim that every woman throughout history would describe herself as oppressed, and that women who don't somehow don't count. Far from it. Each woman's experience as a woman is unique, and I'm not going to put words in someone's mouth. However, when a woman says something like:\n\n&gt; The man or the woman in whom resides greater virtue is the higher; neither the loftiness nor the lowliness of a person lies in the body according to the sex but in the perfection of conduct and virtues.\n\nin the 15th century, I'm going to have to take umbrage with the idea that women weren't contemplating their own positions in societies. \n\nOnce again, to be clear, I'm not going to call Christine de Pizan (author of the quote up there) a feminist - she wouldn't recognise the term, nor would she apply to herself. However, I can look at her works, especially *The Book of the City of Ladies*, and the various forms of womanhood it presents and say that she probably considered her position in society, and viewed herself as not equal to men or to the aristocracy on which she relied. Indeed, the fact that she was an author in this extremely male-dominated world is a testament to how much she was aware of what her social role was supposed to be, and how much she didn't necessarily participate in it.\n\nWhat's great about de Pizan, though, is that, in addition to giving us her own insights, her works show that she's not the only one pushing against a patriarchal system. While 15th century France wasn't exactly a roiling hotbed of women's liberation, we do see through her work and through her journals that she wasn't the only one looking at gender dynamics and seeing inequality. The women she interacts with discuss this, and the women she writes about are embodiments of this conversation. \n\nThe thing is, though, that 15th century France is not the only source of women contemplating their social roles and finding that they didn't much care for it. While it's a controversial example, I'd absolutely argue that Boudicca's Iceni rebellion stemmed partly from a rebellion against Roman's expectations of her as a woman. I'll admit, we don't have a story told from her perspective, but even from the Roman perspective, part of her fight was revenge for how Roman soldiers had taken her title despite it being hers, and how they had treated her as inferior through rape and beating. Of course, this is legend, and we know the dangers of relying on these sorts of legends for a depiction of history, but if we take Roman writings to have even a grain of truth, Boudicca might be an example of a woman rebelling against men because she was annoyed with her lot in life.\n\nIf we go to the 17th and 18th centuries, we see an abundance of female authors writing about how inequality was unacceptable, with Mary Wollstonecraft being probably the most well-known. Their arguments stemmed from inequalities in divorce rights, in property and inheritance rights, and in arguing against the perception that women were mentally less capable. In many ways, the very fact that they were arguing these things brought what they were saying more legitimacy. \n\nOther women rebelled against the social order in other ways. In my post about same-sex marriage, I talked about co-habitation and how it was, in some ways, a reaction against marriage norms. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the number of women choosing to co-habit increased as women saw that as a way to express themselves as well as escape marriage as their sole type of relationship. \n\nAll of this, of course, focuses exclusively on Europe. Women's rights and discussions about them were hardly limited to Europeans, nor were they the sole inspiration for them. Nana Asma'u, for instance, was a massive advocate for women's education in Africa and Islam more generally, even going so far as to train travelling teachers who went through Africa, teaching women and girls to read and write. She's been looked at as one model for what Islamic feminism can strive to be.\n\nWhile I don't want to detract from women's rights around the world, Islam and Islamic feminism does provide a great opportunity to look at [this comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/38ufwh/have_there_ever_been_any_major_violent_uprisings/crycm9a) and the idea that separate spheres means women couldn't have realised that they were treated as inferior. Islamic feminism is a fantastic example of a type of feminism that both takes the \"complementary\" roles as a given, and still advocates for gender equality. Within Islam, there is the clear teaching that men and women have their divinely ordained roles, and while you will run across Muslim feminists who say that this is a holdover from when the Qur'an was first recorded, there are many, many others who see this as a fundamental part of what feminism ought to be, that for Muslims, feminism and gender equality must be understood within the greater context of divine commands. This should not be interpreted as Muslim women being inferior beings and not realising it. Far from it. It's another, equally valid perspective on feminism and on what \"gender equality\" ought to be. To claim that because women had complementary roles to men, they couldn't realise they were oppressed is ludicrous. \n\nIn any case, my point is that women throughout history placed themselves and their experiences within a narrative of oppression. Some saw themselves as more oppressed than others, and some chose to say more about it than others, but it's hardly something limited to the 19th century and on. Both women and men have been talking about this for a long, long time. \n\nAlso, periods have nothing to do with women not engaging in armed rebellion. That's stupid.\n\nSources!\n\nI didn't say much about her, but I recommend reading about Elizabeth Thomas as well for another example of European protofeminism. The article \"\"To be both Patroness and Friend\": Patronage, Friendship, and Protofeminism in the Life of Elizabeth Thomas (1675–1731)\" by Rebecca M. Mills in Studies in Eighteenth-Century Culture is a good overview of her writing and her perspectives on gender equality.\n\n\"Sexism in History or, Writing Women's History Is a Tricky Business\" by Ruth Rosen in the Journal of Marriage and Family is really funny. Just go read it.\n\n\"The Vision of Christine de Pizan\" is a good overview of Christine de Pizan, her writings, and her views on 15th century French gender relations.\n\n[This](https://muse.jhu.edu/books/9781609170653) is the collected works of Nana Asma'u, but doesn't contain much about Islamic feminism more generally.
