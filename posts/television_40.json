Lucky it's only 6 episodes so I think that's a great example. \nBad first season is a common warning (\"Just gotta power through!\") but what others can you think of?\nUse spoiler tags if necessary.",

Specially those using platforms like Hobi and Watcht, do i have to use both services (both trakt and Hobi/Watcht) or trakt works just as a database and the other is the front-end?\n\nThanks in advance, looking to hear your opinion",

But I do believe that both the shows have a lot in common and if you like one of them you will most probably like the other one too. \n\nBoth of them are centred around the aftermath of a global event that eradicated a major portion of the population and is based on how people deal with the aftermath of that event. Both of them have a heavy emphasis on grief and how humans have to move on and are able to adapt. Both of them despite being on HBO can be surprisingly very episodic in nature where one episode can focus entirely on side characters leaving the protagonists with minimal screen time.\n\nObviously there are a load of differences, for one The Leftovers doesn't have blind monsters that track people with sound. But on a thematic and structural level both of these shows are good companions to each other on HBO.",

        "text": "I started rewatching TW recently after many years. I loved the first couple of seasons, but it went downhill IMO during or after S3. Watching in hindsight now (skipping around), they did seem to favor the police side a little more (esp B/Y) even in the beginning. However, by S4 it became an all out cop show and eliminated what I liked about it. It wasn’t even about working the beat anymore, it became cartoonish. I’ve never seen a show abandon it’s entire premise midway like that and wondered why the drastic change? Ratings, they couldn’t write FDNY/EMT? I even googled but couldn’t find anything.   \nFor me the heart of the show was more the EMT/firemen side. I was sad when Bobby C. left, he was charismatic and could’ve been developed more, but the way things played out it was the right choice to leave. The dramatic and depressing way they phased out some of the FDNY side was low and clearly ratings bait. What they did to Doc was particularly horrible and MB was the only actor I knew when I started watching. The way the show changed was kind of a slap in the face to the actors who were hired to have equal roles and then just discarded. I’m glad the actors in the FDNY roles went onto bigger and better things. Interestingly enough, most of the NYPD actors on the NYPD side disappeared. Thought Wile would have had a bigger career though.\n\nLoved all the original characters. Hated Cruz and the outlandish plots that were the last few seasons. Wish they would’ve stayed true to the original premise of the show. Not surprised it was canceled during S6.",

I often feel like I'm losing a good bit of info when watching shows, the discrepancy between the dub and the sub is intense at times and it's like I don't know which to trust the most. Usually I always watch in original language with subtitles because I felt that was the most accurate, but Netflix has me doubting a lot of times if the dub isn't better. So yeah next question which is closer to the original dialogue, sub or dub?\n\nBtw I hate dubs with a passion but if goofy voices are ''better'' than I might go for it even though it destroys my suspension of disbelief.",

But I didn't, because it was frowned upon in my family and we watched other stuff. I've only seen bits and pieces, know a few character names and that's it.\n\nNow I'm looking to enjoy it first time and get some 90s nostalgia. But. I read the episode summaries of season 9 on Wikipedia, and I understand there was lots of drama going on behind the scenes with the revival in 2018 and some tweets and whatever.\n\nWikipedia says that The Connors basically ignores everything past season 6 of Roseanne. So I'm wondering, do you recommend that I watch seasons 7-9 and ignore The Connors, or skip 7-9 and do watch The Connors, or just watch everything? Esp considering I already know the plot twist at the end of season 9.\n\nOh and there's season 10-11 I guess. I don't know. I haven't started watching yet, so I guess I have a solid 6 seasons to go through before deciding. Should I go into this with a grain of salt of some kind? What's your opinion on the series?",
