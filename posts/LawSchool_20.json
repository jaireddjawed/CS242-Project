        "text": "1L here, I just scheduled my first callbacks virtually when given the option between in person and virtual.\n\nI have a completely packed schedule over the next few weeks. I’m behind in classes right now and struggling to keep up. It’s stressing me out a lot. I panicked and chose virtual so I wouldn’t have to deal with travel time and missing classes (and because I have other upcoming in-person screeners preventing travel on some days). I’m pretty burned out and trying to bounce back, but the idea of having to travel a lot over the next 2 weeks immensely stresses me out. I also wanted to be able to do the interviews sooner rather than later so I chose virtual to be able to get them done this week. For what it’s worth, I got one of the callbacks after a virtual screener so I figured I am an okay virtual interviewer. \n\nBut is this a big mistake? I’m worried now that this will hurt my chances. It’s obviously easier to create a connection in person, and I’m concerned they’ll think I’m less serious by choosing virtual. Any insights would be appreciated!",

When I graduated I made a LinkedIn post saying that graduating at the age of X felt surreal, in the sense that I’m almost in disbelief that I made it and am proud of graduating. A lot of people at work made fun of me for it and gave me shit for it, and some even went as far as to call me a fraud. Is it reasonable to be proud of such an achievement?

I know that one way is to do the article 100 (when you’re a lawyer in Mauritius you can pass an exam to “convert” it for the French bar and become a lawyer in France) but I’m not a lawyer in Mauritius. I did all my studies in France (licence, master) and did the French exams (CRFPA / CAPA).\n\nHowever being a lawyer in France is only allowed if you have the French nationality or if you are from Europe. \n\nThe other way is to prove the reciprocity of the access to the lawyer profession between the 2 states - see below text:\n“It is up to the applicant, of foreign nationality, non-EU, holder of the French CAPA, but who is not a lawyer registered with a Bar outside the European Union, to provide proof of the reciprocity required by the provisions of article 11 of the law of December 31, 1971 modified by referring to a possible bilateral agreement linking his country to France and providing for reciprocity for access to the profession of lawyer, to the legislative and regulatory provisions of his country relating to the profession of lawyer by verifying whether they provide for access to the bar of his country for foreign lawyers and their practice under the same conditions as lawyers from his country in France, to the practice of the ordinal authorities of his country by seeking whether foreigners or French people have actually been able to access the bar of their country and practice their profession there under the same conditions as lawyers with the nationality of this State”.\n\nI asked the French bar and it doesn’t seem that such a document exists. The other way is to prove the reciprocity “concretely”, which means proving that French lawyers were able to become lawyers in Mauritius without having the Mauritian nationality. \n\nHow can I become a lawyer in France? \n\nThank you!",

However with cover letters, I see no reason why a candidate should not use it. Employers have used AI tools for years to screen applicants and to administer aptitude tests. I don't see why we shouldn't do the same.   \n\n\nI've been using some version of the following prompt to generate my cover letters. As inputs I use the annual report of firms and a resume + cover letter that I previously drafted from scratch. I also remove filler and non-relevant words from the firm's annual report.  \n\n\nYour name is \\[NAME\\] and you are a law student at \\[SCHOOL NAME\\]. Prior to law school, you worked as a \\[JOB\\] with \\[OLD EMPLOYER\\].  You are applying for \\[BRIEFLY DESCRIBE JOB\\] at \\[EMPLOYER\\]. I am now going to provide you with \\[EMPLOYER\\]'s 2022 Annual Report and job description, as well as a resume and cover letter you previously drafted. I want you to draft a cover letter for \\[EMPLOYER\\]. Use the annual report to identify unique characteristics and strengths of \\[EMPLOYER\\]'s \\[PRACTICE AREAS/PRO BONO/DIVERSITY/ETC\\]. After identifying their unique strengths, use your resume and sample cover letter to tie in your academic and professional experience to the characteristics you identified from \\[EMPLOYER\\]'s annual report. Create narratives wherever possible using the sample cover letter as inspiration. Use concise, professional language and avoid generalities at all costs.  \n\n\nThis prompt is only meant to generate a rough first draft. From there, I feed it further prompts telling it to delete/change language I don't like and to elaborate on language that I do like. I then patch together and edit the various responses I receive into one cogent cover letter. Definitely takes some work but is way quicker and higher quality than anything I would draft on my own.",

But, if FSU is more focused in “public offices”, than it wouldn’t make too much sense to pursue a degree in Business Law there.\n\n(I chose FSU because it is: 1. Good ranked; 2. Online; 3. I want to live in Florida; 3. There is this LAC (Latin-American Caribean) scholarship that can reduce the out-of-sate cost to in-stare cost, which is about 50% discount.\n\nThank you in advance.",
