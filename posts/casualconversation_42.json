        "text": "This season of my life has felt like a really big limbo; a long ass waiting room period, so to speak. \n\nI'm a recent college graduate yet I'm currently unemployed. I've been job searching for months but so many places never call back (it seems a lot of people are dealing with this currently). On top of that I've been dealing with depression for a little over a year now, which makes everything a little harder than usual. Friends I was really close to have come and gone, so there isn't even much of a support system for what I'm dealing with. \n\nI feel like making new friends would be nice, but I don't feel good enough...just yet. Once I have a job, I can move out of this shitty apartment and then re-create my life how I want it, and then all my current stressors will be gone. \n\nBut then I had someone tell me: wouldn't a friend or future partner be ok with all that? Do you WANT to be with someone who's judgmental about the fact that you're not your idealized self yet? A good friend or good partner would appreciate you exactly as you are.\n\nAnd it's like, I WANT to believe that, yanno? Battling with your self-worth is such a struggle. My brain just refuses to accept that anyone could like me as I am, with all that I'm lacking. But on the other side...I KNOW I can hold conversations well, put a smile on people's faces, and so much more. Maybe my worth ISN'T measured by the fact that I still don't have a job yet...maybe.\n\nAnyway. I was curious if anyone has experienced these feelings, and if maybe things changed for the better eventually. I'd love to hear it!",

        "text": "At my train station yesterday, there was this kid who is maybe 17 - 19. I'd seen him there before, he usually commutes alone and carries a photo id in a lanyard around his neck.\n\nHe was wearing his shoes in the opposite feet, listening to a playlist via his smartphone (and using headphones), and pacing around energetically waiting for the train. Big shuffled hair, baseball cap, red cheeks, looks almost like an adorable cartoon character from children's books!\n\nThen he approached me, got close to my face, looked me deep in the eyes, and asked loudly: \"DO TOW TRUCKS COUGH?\". Confused, I said \"I don't know!\". I was distracted before that and wasn't sure what was going on.\n\nThere are a lot of colorful characters at that station. But once he got my attention, I realized he's not one of them, but is in fact on the spectrum.\n\nHe turned around in place in a full circle, and then approached me again. And asked me the same question: \"DO TOW TRUCKS COUGH?\" Unsure of what to say, I said again \"I don't know\", but with a smile now. He turned away and continued \"vibing\" to his music. When he asked, he was looking at me innocently and earnestly. Like when a 5 year old kid is asking an adult an important question. Like he really wanted to know the answer!\n\nThe train came by and went on.\n\nAbout an hour later at home, I remembered that about 2 months ago I saw him there as well, and he asked me a question that I thought at the time was absurd (and that someone was playing a prank on me).\n\nI'd like to do better next time.\n\nWhat's a good answer to a kid in his mindset and imagination? An answer that would satisfy his curiosity but maybe also make for a 2-minutes conversation. I don't have experience conversing with people in his condition, and he looks lonely in his thoughts every time.\n\nSo, do tow trucks cough?\n\nTLDR; kid on the spectrum has been asking this question for months, seems no one is talking to him, and next time I'd like to answer his question in a nice and short conversation if possible.",

        "text": "So I (21F) have an 85 year old dad who’s watching the Super Bowl right now. Unfortunately for him I hate American football… our relationship is very easy going for the most part and sometimes I even love messing with his little ol self. \n\nFor example- back story! He keeps a meticulous track on his silverware! It’s incredibly annoying sometimes but in a funny way. Sometimes I’ll leave a spoon or knife in a container, say a cake, to use again and he’ll ask me where said spoon or knife are. Hell claim that he has x number of forks, x number of spoons, and so on, and one is missing. I do know it’s not OCD he’s just into sets as most old people are, and he’s also very bossy about everything so I know he asks these things.\n\nSo what did I do? \n\nI had a friend give me a spoon. I brought it home, and threw it on top of the spoons in the silverware drawer and just waited. Four weeks went by and one day I finally gave in when he was in the kitchen putting away dishes, and had a conversation with him that went like this\n\n“Have you noticed anything?”\n\n“No?…. What are you talking about??”\n\n“Anything in the drawer (pointing at the silverware drawer he was in)”\n\nPause…\n\n“ what did you do🙄”\n\nI couldn’t even hold in my laughter. When I told him he was baffled, shocked, and he was thinking about how I could possibly come up with something like that. He said he’d been wondering where the hell it had come from and why he couldn’t place it with any sets he has. He just couldn’t figure out how suddenly we had a whole other spoon just ✨poof✨ into existence! It was funny! \n\nSo \n\nOnto my needs. I need smart comments on the Super Bowl. I need lines that I can randomly spout. Normally I come home and randomly come up and say things about foot ball (which he knows I know nothing about) and he’ll look bewildered 🤣 I need SOMETHING. Something only true foot ball fans would even know please!",

        "text": "\nI wanted to have this talk with my friends but they’re all preoccupied or sleeping…it’s pretty late here.\n\nYesterday I watched the movie “call me by your name” and didn’t think much of it, liked it but moved on. A few minutes ago I was listening to one of the songs from the movie called words and it reminded me of a past love experience I had two years ago during lockdown. \n\nTo jump right into it, I had a friend named “Miranda”, she was smart, beautiful and compassionate. Before lockdown I always admired her mind, the way she handled situations, gave advice and was an open ear for others. But I also observed how it was wearing her down. Towards lockdown it was mostly just the two of us talking on the phone, about life and shit. Actually it was due to me feeling suicidal and her being there for me, but in turn I wanted to be there for her. I wanted to be a shoulder for her also. An ear for an ear if you will. \n\nI remember talking to her on the phone and us talking about the past, she really helped to put things into perspective and I of course tried to help her too. There was a time I spoke about my childhood with her. When I was younger my intelligence was constantly undermined, to the point where I believed I was an actual idiot. When saying it out loud I began to cry after realising how messed up it was. She of course was there for me. We began speaking about our lives, dreams and confided in each other for advice. For the first time someone actually came to me for advice, it’s always been me going to other people for advice. We spoke about philosophical topics, all sorts really. She really helped to show me that I actually have a lot to say about things and I’m not actually the bubbling idiot people thought I was. It was great. We had so much in common that it was uncanny but we were also direct opposites of each other. Such things were ironic that it’ll take ages to list. She even sent me a Christmas card, I was really grateful. \n\nthe only issue was at the time I didn’t know how to handle my emotions. \n\nI over thought a lot, got jealous way too easily not to mention was heavily suicidal and depressed, was also living in a hostile household. She was my life raft for the storm I was in. I relied on her too much. She was there through the turmoil that I experienced and honestly I feel shitty for subjecting her to it. It wasn’t fair on her she didn’t deserve what I dragged her through. I grew increasingly demanding of her attention that i cringe of disgust everytime I think about it. She was very patient with me however, more than I deserved.\n\nThere came a point where I knew things weren’t the same anymore and she had grew disdain for me. She cared of course but reached her limit. Then on my birthday she ended our friendship. Can’t say I blame her though. I was a lot. It’s embarrassing to look back on. \n\nBut through the friendship ending, I like to think I became a better person. I looked at the sides of myself that needed work and worked on them, became more compassionate to my friends and family all in all I became a better person. She also helped me learn that everyone has their nasty side, including her. \n\nThere were red flags she exhibited that I ignored cause I idolised her. I thought she couldn’t do no wrong. But that’s not reality, that’s not people.\n\nafter our friendship ended I removed everything about her from my life in order to help me move on quicker.\nIt’s been two years now and I often think about her. I always hoped that maybe we’d become friends again. But now I’ve realised that she was simply meant for a period of my life and that period has now passed. \n\nMiranda if you (for some reason) read this, I enjoyed our conversations and I’m sorry for breaking my promise to you on being the shoulder you can lean on. \n\nI dunno if we what we had was simply all in my head, but I’m willing to be delusional.

I completed the course in 54 minutes, which is pretty dang good for an unfit human being. Quite proud of myself for not stopping half-way 👏 \n\nI'm in WAY less pain than I thought I'd be in, so that's pretty great too.  \n\nDefinitely looking forward to my next 5K and all other new memories &amp; adventures.\nFeel free to drop any tips on 5K training. 🙂🙂\n\nAnyone else celebrating any milestsones or wins today, big or small?

I've felt a little down with the week running up to it, but it's hit me like a tonne of bricks today. \n\n\nShe was a shining light for me. She helped me in some of my darkest days and parted the clouds on the gloomy ones. She was part of the driving force of me leaving a dead-end relationship, changing my career and meeting my now-fiancé. \n\n\nShe died of Sudden Death Syndrome which makes things harder. There's no medical explanation for this. She was just shy of 30 years old... that's not even half of a typical life. It makes me angry because she had everything going for her. She JUST found the love of her life and was blossoming in her career. She had not long been back home to Ireland where she belonged, because I knew her heart yearned for her family when she was here in England for nearly 10 years, for someone who didn't appreciate her who she managed to get away from and start her new life with her absolute soulmate. Why does life have to be so unfair? \n\n\nI miss her everyday, and I hope I'm making her proud with everything she taught me. \n\n\nI'll never stop thinking of you, Jade. &lt;3",

At some point I considered myself a looser in a certain way.  \nI was always confident about myself, but the way my life went just didn't add up, eventually I blamed it on myself.  \nBut then I moved. It smelled like sweet hope and it was mixed with joyful anticipation.  \nI was expecting changes, I was lusting for them, I was craving changes.  \nA young man that could have settled down with a life cherished with despair and slowly fading beliefs.  \n\n\nBut NO. It is NOT like that! Slowly changes occured. Like a touch from the gods I was guided into another path.  \nI lacked a lot of activities that young people experience. Up until yesterday I never even went to a club to party.  \nYou could say it takes courage to admit the falses in your life. But I think that is a delusion.  \nI did work on my mental state, successfully. It does work. It's kinda do or don't.   \nIf you wanna get better, you have to approach changes and eager the work.  \nI have now found new friends and things are going great.  \nThe thoughts that I was just not very social are gone.. I just needed a different enviroment.  \nBtw I moved from a small town to a city.  \nWhat I wanna tell you is, if you suffer from an opinion that downgrades your mental state, pushing you into doubtful beliefs about yourself then don't take that for granted.  \nRemember, always, there is no giving up. Pain and misery always walk along with us in life to a certain extend, but those are just one side of the leaf.   \nThere is also happiness, enjoyment, peace, love and so on. But the positive stuff you kinda need to work for. So treat yourself, don't look into the dark.",

Been dealing with a lot lately, just wanted a bit of a breather. \n\nAs I pulled up, a woman walked by this this awesome purple mohawk. It was SO well done. The color was rich and deep, the style was  well done, like this wave moving atop her head. \n\nShe has her hair long enough that she had a solid black color for most of her hair, and that royal purple for the tips, it was just so visually striking. \n\nLike, I'm used to people who dye their hair, my brother has been a punk dude  turned hair stylist, so he's been dying his hair forever, I've done mine a handful of times too, so it's not that it was unusual to see, it was more comforting. Why? Because the area I live in doesn't really have many people who rock this style. It's more common with kids, I've noticed, but for older folks like me (lol I'm 36, I know it's not that old) it's so rare to see. \n\nAnyway, I was looking for a mask before I head in, and she happens to walk back out. I just very casually say \"hey, I just wanna say your hair is AWESOME!\" \n\nNot trying to flirt, not trying to strike up a conversation, just an acknowledgement that \"hey, you're cool!\" sorta thing. \n\nI'm not a woman, and I can only imagine some of the stuff they deal with when approached by strangers, so there's always a bit of hesitation, mostly because you never know who's having a bad day, and how it might affect how they perceive the comment.. \n\nBut in this case, I just went for it, I knew I wasn't trying to be a creep, so you'd hope they can tell you're being genuine, and.. yeah! Seemed like she was genuinely touched! She was a bit surprised, it was early after all, but she said \"thank you so much! It means a lot to me!\" and did that little motion where she grasped at her heart. \n\nJust to paint the scene; \n\nI think she was just wearing a big coat and sweats, it is cold out afterall, and obviously no judgement, be comfy, it's just Dunkin donuts. Just pointing out that there was SO much effort put into her hair style that you can tell she was proud of it, and it was deserving of recognition haha. \n\nAnd you know what? I feel that! I think my hair is my best feature, and even when I wanna be lazy and dess for comfort, I still enjoy making sure my hair looks good. Sometimes you just gotta feel yourself a little, ya know?\n\nSo anyway, what's the last genuine compliment you've given or received? I wanna hear em!",

The smaller door did not have the garage door opener installed, but all the wiring was there for one. No problem, I had one in the box that I had leftover from flipping houses before the pandemic. \n\nI decided to put it in last fall, but for some reason, the sensors did not work. I tried everything and came to this conclusion. My wife said no, it has to be this or that. I knew it was sensors. Finally, she said, after months of a standoff, that I could buy new sensors. Well, they worked. I now have a fully functioning garage door opener on the second door! \n\nWe old men just know stuff.",

        "text": "TLDR: I enjoy party planning, but our friends rarely initiate contact or reciprocate what we consider some of the easier elements of friendship, and despite having fun whenever we get together, I'm not sure I want to put in the effort anymore.\n\nMy wife and I (both 50yo) have a core group of friends. For years, I've been our group's party planner. I enjoy doing nice things for others and organizing fun events. So I'm the one who sends out memes or checks on friends, organizes parties or events, plans more intimate dinners, etc. \n\nLately, though, I realize how seldom others initiate. No texts. No requests for happy hours. No impromptu BBQs. Certainly no organized parties. \n\nWhen we get together, we all have a blast. And I'm totally confident others enjoy hanging out with us too. \n\nBut now...I don't know...I'm just not sure I have the energy to try anymore. \n\nI can't possibly summarize 7 years of friendships in one Reddit post. It's not as bleak as it sounds and it's a little more than the lack of initiation: our friends rarely ask about us; they talk about themselves a lot; some are judgmental, etc. \n\nWe're all human and some of that is just part of life, but it plays a role in my feelings of being meh. \n\nRight now, I'm in the mood to organize something fun, but damn it, I'm like, \"Oh, look, we're putting on a party for our friends who don't seem to notice when we're not around.\"\n\nSure, some people are busy, but aren't we all? And sure, some people don't think about initiating, but if that person can't find time for a simple check-in text every now and then, is that person trying?\n\nSo how do you determine if it's worth putting in more effort vs. letting a friendship fade?",

Exactly these all your child also want from you. No matter how many years passed away but still the situation is the same.",
