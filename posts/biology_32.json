        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/10hgetb/is_it_true_that_bisexualityhomosexuality_is_more/",
        "text": "I had assumed it was more common in males (with the exception of some species like bonobos and Japanese macaques), studies, from reading various lists etc, and I guess the idea the male has a stronger sex drive, but I read two old articles from the 70s and 80s that claimed it was actually found in more species of female mammals than males, or in many species (guinea pigs, rats, dogs) it was commoner in females. This surprised me, but make sense if it's to do with hormones that elicit more 'male typical' behaviours, or it's more related to social organisation, competition etc. One article by Goy and Goldfoot in 1975 (Neuroendocrinology: Animal Models and Problems of Human Sexuality), and an article by Young on 1961 (no reference) said that bisexuality was more common in females, and that in species either the male or female tended to be more bisexual. This seems easily disproved, however, as in many ape species its common in both. Maybe the theory isnt that accurate?\n\nThere's also another article, 'Homosexual behaviour and female-male mounting in mammals—a first survey' by Dagg 1984 (unfortunately you have to pay to access it online, I opted for the 48 hour access period) that said according to the literature it was reported in 73 species of female and 61 species of male mammal. However many of these were under captive conditions, induced etc, and among the list of mammals where she says male homosexuality exists, it is commonly reported, e.g. dogs. \n\nAre these assumptions outdated? Can one really compare the degree of bisexuality between genders and species in any qualitative way? Do males tend to have a more directed drive, while females less so? Interestingly most scientists also agree that in humans male bisexuality is more common, due to stats at the time and it's prevalence among cultures. I mean, this was the 70s/80s and we've come along way. It does seem scientists underestimate both male and female bisexuality. I wonder if these animals study say anything at all on human sexuality.\n\nCurious about your thoughts of this.",
