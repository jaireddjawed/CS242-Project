Someone who understands that people aren't really looking for success or happiness or any of those other things.

It's about creating an image, a brand, a feeling that people can associate with your product or service. It's about convincing them that what you're offering is unique, special, and something that they absolutely have to have.  \n\nAnd the beauty of it all? It doesn't even have to be true.

I figured i needed glasses too. We aren't identical twins but our symptoms were identical. Turns out my sister actually had blurry vision that her glasses corrected. During my appointment my Dr said that i have better than 20/20 vision but i do have an astigmatism. Im sure I'm explananing it wrong but apparently after dialating my eyes he determined that i needed a very minimal perscription in the one eye. He said that i was probably working so hard to keep everything in focus that was why my eyes were hurting. So technically I had been seeing everything perfectly fine but i still need glasses to prevent headaches and eye strain. I have never worn glasses in my life either. Apparently i could go on without glasses but i don't like having headaches so I'll wear them",

I have been reading a lot of news about students have been using chatgpt to write homework essays and stuff like that. I myself am guilty of it because I used it to do some basic assignment. But I think this will increase creativity in long run. I mean previously when you were told to write essays you used research about the topic and wirte it in your own way as much as possible. Now with this AI tools you can let the Ai do the work and just modify it a little. There was news that chatgpt passed bar exam, chatgpt passed MBA exam, and another subject too I forget the name though. I am not complaining because I have been using it a lot lately and enjoying. Technology is there to help and if used effectively provides lots of benefits. One thing I like the most about chatgpt is how it can explain complex topic in simple you tell to explain that thing in layman terms.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAre you using these tools?",

I had to leave early because i was on the verge of tears too, and i didn't want it to seem like i was eavesdropping (which i was). \n\nThat noon, i was at the botanical garden inside the uni and overheard a couple fighting. The guy's dad left his family, and they can't afford to study there anymore. The gal wants him to stay, and she's happy to help him pay the tuition. The guy didn't want to take the help, and an hour later, long story short, they broke up. \n\nWhen i was walking home that afternoon, the road was blocked for a good 15 minutes by a funeral procession. It had everything a telenovela/soap opera funeral march had: horse-drawn carriage, long procession of wailing mourners, a bunch of ladies wearing black dresses and veils hysterically crying, long line of black and white cars, and a live band with a singer singing soap opera theme tunes. I thought that this was the last of the dramatic shenanigans i'd see today until tonight. \n\nTonight, my neighbors had a huge fight that everyone in the block watched. The guy was accusing his wife of stealing the contents of a safety deposit box he inherited from his uncle. The wife accused the guy of infidelity with 2 women and 2 men. The mother-in-laws suddenly arrived, and they promptly proceeded to have a fight, which ended with the police coming and 2 old women losing some hair from pulling each other's hair. \n\n\nI could've sworn that i was transported to the alternate universe where soap operas happen today. I wasn't involved with any of those people's issues, but i feel rather emotionally exhausted. Anyways, what's the most soap opera-like event you have experienced or seen?",

That might sound like a negligible difference, 2 hours, but after several days the sleep debt piles up and I just feel groggy every day.\n\nI've also considered readjusting my sleeping pattern, but it already takes me hours to sleep. I chose this job almost specifically because it suits my disordered sleeping. I also sleep with earplugs, have tried white noise, and have blackout curtains.\n\nI've politely spoken to her about it and she was really nice, even offered to change her alarm to a quieter one, but I continue to wake up. I know it's not her fault at all. She needs to wake up for work. But do I have any other option or am I gonna have to start going to bed really early?\n\nAny suggestions appreciated!",

There is no denial that some Indians got internet before they got education but that doesn't mean 1.4. billion people are creepy weirdos . Okay I get it there's something about our body odour but I and a billion other Indians use deos. You haven't met us have you ? I acknowledged this in one of our Indian sub reddit and they told me to just ignore it but why? I'm sensitive I can't get out some shit out of my head . The crazy thing is the thousands of upvotes those remarks get on reddit. Yes on behalf of the whole country we apologise about the scam calls you deal with but that doesn't define all of us.\n\nA dude on some 'RateMe' subreddit commented on other guy's post that \"You are good looking for an Indian\". This right here was the most upvoted comment. They don't even realise that these subtle casual comments are straight up insulting. I also do accept that my country is dealing with a problem of women safety but not every Indian who can't speak English approaching you is having an intention of harrassing you. No we also don't drink cowpiss. Infact that is considered super weird for 99 percent of Indian population . Please if you could just console that would be fine too. I'm not an adult and maybe not that strong hearted. Neither do my parents believe in caste system so please stop giving excuses that it's okay to be racist to Indians coz they themselves treat each other with hatred. We are still developing slowly. Our infra really needs an upgrade. I get it but just if you see a stereotypical comment, am not telling you to downvote it but please just leave it as it is. The number of upvotes are just ridiculous. Thank you stranger for reading it through . Please pardon me , English isn't my first language.",

        "text": "My 80-year-old nan (grandmother) is a frail, small-framed lady. She was driving to a doctor appointment when she was waved down by two frantic young children (around 7 years old) on the street. She pulled over to help, and got out of her car with her walker (she'd recently had a hip replacement) when she saw a \\~50yo male face-down in the dirt, clutching his chest and saying he was in 10/10 pain. She's had a heart attack previously, so when she saw him clutching her chest she believed he was also having one. \n\nIn her walker, she has a little glove compartment where she keeps her medication (Glyceryl Trinitrate)  for unstable angina. She remembered that paramedics had used this on her when she was having a heart attack, so started rushing to his side to give it to him, while she asked the two kids to get her phone from the car to call an ambulance. She said she was rushing over when her walker got caught on the gutter, and she was too weak to lift it. After 30 seconds of struggling with it, she gave up and tried to walk on her own. She collapsed on the ground and couldn't get back up. \n\nShe yelled out for the kids to call an ambulance with her phone but they didn't know how. She said she was trying to crawl but wasn't moving, and her walker had rolled away.  She asked the kids to bring the phone to her. She called the ambulance, but was stuck in the gutter while the man was dying. She gave the medication to the kids and tried to tell them how to use it on him but they were frozen in fear. She said she just started screaming, trying to wake him up, trying to move but couldn't. No one pulled over to help. The paramedics arrived and started CPR but they were unable to revive him. \n\nShe was crying saying she immediately called the RTA (the driving-licence authority in Australia) to cancel her licence because she couldn't live with herself if she'd ever hit a pedestrian and couldn't help them because she couldn't walk. She was saying, \"if I had just been able to get to his side and give him the medicine, do you think he would have lived?\" I said the best thing for him was an ambulance and that's what you did. She said, \"I wish I could have just held his hand so he wasn't alone. I witnessed someone die in front of my eyes because I was useless.\"\n\nI said, \"you're the only person who stopped for those two kids, you did what you could with what you had, and I'm extremely proud of you\". I feel like crying. What do you say to something like that? I'm heartbroken that she has had to experience that.",

I'm 19, Canadian, and a bit bored and lonely on this lovely freezing night. \n\nI'm an artist! I draw, paint, make jewelry, play guitar, cook and bake, write angry trauma poetry, do books count? I love books but I haven't been reading because of stress. I also love nature very very much! Trying to figure out spirituality for myself, I love adventures, walking, being in the woods and collecting things I find! \n\nIt's currently winter (a cold one) so I'm inside a fair amount. I pace a lot whilst listening to music, drink a lot of iced coffee, cook and clean, and try to get outside if it's not too cold. My favourite season is fall. I love Halloween so so so much. And I don't even like candy much :p \n\nI wish I could live a thousand lives so i could be: a character in the picture of dorian gray, a kickboxer, running a Cafe, a banshee or siren, a famous skateboarder, a metal musician, a punk musician, an animal collector, a depressed artist (already living that one), living in France drinking wine and writing love letters, a cottagecore girl, a pool boy at the vampire mansion, with long hair, with short hair, with black hair. With blonde hair. An 80s rockstar babe, a swamp witch, a frog, a forest dweller, an antique collector, Eddie sedgwick, Banksy, the Cheshire cat, and many more things üòÄ\n\nRealistically I'm stuck in a shit job, in a shit city, I'm pretty poor, I want to live in a cabin and make stuff out of bones and wood and rocks and fur. I'm a writer, I'm a guitarist, I'm a neurodivergent queer who doesn't know their identity. I'm an insomniac, a soft hearted dork, who is also full of rage. And I'm pretty sure I'm an anarchist, or an anarcho-communist. Im making  a battle jacket. I admire people who scream into microphones. I was raised on punk music. It makes me feel most at home in a world I already feel out of place in. I am disabled, so I lose energy quickly, I also get overwhelmed easily. I hate cops and the government. I like shiny things I find on the ground. I'm a very creative person who also finds it hard to do things every day. \n\nI love horror movies, piercings, tattoos, intelligent people because I love to learn, nature, music, cold weather, coffee, concepts and speculations, weird fashion, and other creative people. \n\nI have a lot of energy at the moment. Hopefully it'll carry on for a while. My head hurts. I want ice cream and to talk to some lovely people. Please don't hit on me, I'm in a relationship and even so, it's creepy. \n\n- Love ya",

        "text": "I used to live in Michigan and moved to central PA about five years ago. Something I wasn't anticipating mot liking about PA (along with a few other major things) is how much sun it gets. I didn't realize how much I took mid Michigan's cloudy days and mild temperatures until I moved here. It seems that most days of the week I'm being blinded by the sun. Its much easier to see on cloudy days, and I really miss the rain. I don't know if anyone else feels this way, but I definitely don't understand all of the people who obsess over having sunny weather. I love rain and clouds and would love to live in a state where the sun never came out.",
