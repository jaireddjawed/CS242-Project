There will, undoubtedly, be pissing contests and infighting.  Deffinately not a *united front,* at any rate.\n\nWas this by design? \n\nOr maybe the professors didn't really care for Marxism, other than the *fighting exploitation* bits?  \n\nMaybe it was just the inevitability of an culture that wants to fight oppression in all forms (a kind of \"jack of all trades, master of none\" for social progress)?\n\nOr, something else?",

They didn't have the understanding that someone could just lie to them like that. When I lived there, I told such ridiculous stories, and people believed me!\"\n\nIs there something to this idea? Were Germans just too... innocent to understand Hitler's lies?\n\nOr was her understanding perhaps colored by the area where she lived? Oberammergau isn't Berlin, by any stretch... Maybe she was accustomed to dealing with... rubes for lack of a better word?\n\nOr, maybe people there were just humoring her, since she was a precocious child, and the daughter of an officer?\n",

Is there an alternative solution that doesn't involve using public funds? Is there anyways that using public funds for euthanasia will benefit society? \n\nEdit: Responses so far have been great. One more thing I can think of, if euthanasia is not publicly funded, the poor would be at a disadvantage for acessing that service. Having a government funded option will also help reduce stigma.",

        "text": "With the recent events in London along with the number of terrorist attacks I've seen on the media growing up throughout the noughties post-9/11, It's brings up question the accuracy of regarding the many dimensions of terrorism such as how much of a threat are the acts and the ideologies.\n\n People have said rightly that despite us living in one of the safest periods and nations in human history, the images on televisions, questions on online forums, news reports on media websites would have us believe otherwise. We can understand though that a certain level of sensationalism is necessary to make money for media moguls. People understand that the average citizen in the West is highly unlikely to be involved in a terrorist attack.\n\nIf that's the case then shouldn't citizens and most importantly, politicans be looking at the other side of the coin and realize that for the average citizen living in the West, the threat of radicalisation is highly unlikely? I completely understand to people who want to take a 'better safe than sorry' approach but this seems to be slowly but disturbingly tiptoeing into 'totalitarian state' with the disturbing suggestions that were made by some UK politicans back in March regarding surveillance of social media apps. Aside from just getting a backdoor to things like WhatsApp, Viber etc.. they also want to ban or regulate the presence of content that may be harmful to young kids/teenagers growing up and being exposed to the internet.\n\nFrom my experience, this seems a bit ridiculous seeing as the average kids in Britian or pretty much anywhere in the Western World regardless of religion doesn't seem to express the homicidal ideations or even sympathy towards any terrorist group that the very tiny minority of kids who join groups like Islamic State do. I suppose though, all it takes is a fringe minority of delusional extremist with weapons to cause chaos and mass murder on an epic scale i.e 9/11.\n\nWhat do you think?",
