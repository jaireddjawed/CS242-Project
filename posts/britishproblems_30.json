Used my modern Android phone, but the on screen keyboard covers the input fields, managed to input the stations blind, hit search and the whole page freezes, unable to even refresh the page. Figured it must be a compatibility issue, smartphones have only been around for over a decade after all, can't expect them to be on top of mobile browsers just yet.\n\nNo problem, I'll go to my desktop, input the journey details, actually see some results this time, but I forgot to add the return journey. I'll just click the 'Add return' button, nope that just scrolls me to the bottom of the page with no option to add a return. Click back, reinput journey, met with a 'Bad Request'. OK, browsers like to cache form submissions when navigating back, can't expect them to handle that gracefully, refresh, try again, 'Bad Request'. Close and reopen browser, try again, 'Bad Request'. Clear cookies and recent history, finally works. Completely painless experience all round.",

Because 3 people with baskets were using the 6 trolley check outs, then a 4th scan as you go person with a basket joined. The thing is, the basket checkout was almost completely empty, only 2 people were using it, and only one person was in the scan as you go area. So as the scan as you go lady only just put her basket on, i said \"Excuse me but the scan as you go is there.\" and pointed her attention to all the empty tills then said \"This is for trolleys.\" then pointed to the large sign saying it was for trolleys, then to the queue of people trying to use it. She responded \"No, you can do it here too.\" then as if to spite me, took ages to just pay.\n\nBut if you have a trolley and try and go into the basket area, Asda staff berate then redirect you. It is so clearly labelled, especially when it is empty, i dunno why people with baskets just can't use the area designed for people with baskets.
