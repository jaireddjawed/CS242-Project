        "text": "I recently became aware of Rev. Calvin Robinson's speech on why Christianity should not allow gay marriage in its institutions through an Oxford Union Debate. You can watch the [full speech here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymbTb2HS5Rc). \n\nDuring the section called \"The Trap\" he also states: *\"however, the faith is inherently discriminatory. God is discriminatory. He sets conditions on us entering His Heavenly kingdom. It is not a free for all. We must turn away from sin, repent and follow Christ...*\" To his credit, he does acknowledge that homosexual persons can get married in a secular way or be in a civil union. He is just arguing that gay marriage is not permissible within Christianity.\n\nI can understand the conservative Christian position on gay marriage and how it's based on the teachings of Church fathers and the Bible, but how would inclusive, LGBQ+ tolerant Christians respond to all of this from a progressive Christian (religious) standpoint??",

        "text": "Up down in short is the classical view of going from the top \"God\" down to everything bellow. A sentence that come to mind is \"as above so bellow\". \n\nDown Up on the other side is the idea that life, nature, the universe and ultimately reality emerged from the bottom up. How would that be? Well, one sentence that come to mind is \"positing the presuppositions\". Everything capable of positing its own presuppositions is taking there own power of reflection to grow up into complexity. \n\nAn example is the concept of true versus false infinity. False infinity is a infinite repetitive entity which isn't going nowhere or isn't building anything out of their infinity. On the other side true infinity starts with an obstacle. Something inherently capable to experience its limitation and start building from there.\n\nAn example is the cell. Without the cell membranes, a cell would not be able to multiply. But as soon as a cell takes knowledge of its limiting membranes, it can start multiplying and as such create a true infinity that builds upon an entity positing its presuppositions. In this case, I'm positing a limitation, it's time for multiplying and create out of limitation an infinite amount of combinations building life, nature, earth, the universe from the ground up.\n\nIsn't this view a proof that we can get rid quite easily of god. Reality emerging out of physical laws, chemical reactions and finally biological components. We are litteraly matter made alive from the ground up. Matter looking at it self. Not god looking over matter. There nothing but us over dead matter. And nothing over living matter. We are alone. Fully responsible. I think it's a very scary scenario for most which explains the god invention. \n\nWhat's your opinion? How would you put it in your own words...?",

        "author": "Martiallawtheology",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/religion/comments/11knxly/anachronistic_language_in_theological_discourse_a/",
        "text": "Well, through time, many many people have been concerned in the topic of hermeneutics, linguistics, rhetoric, etc etc etc. There are so many atheists interested in understanding religious texts written in ancient times or medieval times. Why? Maybe because it's human nature. And mind you, some of the atheist scholars are probably some of the best in the field, and necessary, due to their philosophical naturalism. \n\nI can posit a major value in these atheists that theists do, and must engage with. That is, they rarely have a purpose of engaging in the fallacy of anachronism. I make an assumption that this is the reason the atheist scholars honestly analyse the text to read them plainly, charitably, with scholarship. Of course this is referring to scholars, not the evangelist. \n\nThe issue with theists is that we might tend not to accept that theologies evolve and this evolution may impose changes in meanings of language, and vice versa. \n\nThe changes of language through time can be explained with something like the word \"awful\". A common example in this subject. Awful used to mean \"full of awe\". So our super dads used to be awful. Our super great kings used to be awful. God used to be awful. But today, awful means the exact opposite of what it used to mean. Imagine we back to some old text, four or five hundred years old, and impose the current meaning onto that text!! All the good people will become bad. All the awesome people in the modern language will become awful. Confusing?\n\nI can give an example some might take offence to. Son of God. The Tanakh has this term. I am no expert of the language so if I make errors, please do correct me. Ben Elohim was a designation of responsibility or power, not a anthropomorphic sonship. Maybe the term Bar Nasha during the times of Jesus was misrepresented some time later. In Arabic, every tom, dick and harry knows (or should it be every Ahmed, Abdullah and Fatima) knows that Darb means to travel. Lo and behold, there are travel apps, bus and route maps called \"DARB\". But see, the instance it's related to \"women\", they really really need it to be \"beat\". Actually, in this case not only Muslims want it to be beat, but also non-muslims. Another example is the word \"khimar\", which means \"a cover\". There are no verses in the Qur'an that speaks of a special hair covering apparatus directly, so the only verse that could be found is an ambiguous verse with the word Khimar. It just means to cover. It could even mean the cover or a concealment \"in someone's mind\". But no no. We have to impose the meaning we developed later onto the text that is older. \n\nThis is the fallacy of anachronism. Specifically, this is using \"anachronistic language\" to displace an old setting with newer evolved meanings of language. This is more prevalent than not.  It could even apply to other texts. I can give another example. \n\nIn the Buddhist scripture, there is a famous statement the Buddha makes that goes like \"Hatred is not subdued by hatred. Only love can subdue hatred\". Well, I am paraphrasing a common translation so the exact words may not be used. This \"love\" thing is not there in the original text. This passage is in Yamaka Vagga. In Sutta Pitaka, Buddha Nikayo, Dhammapada Pali. The actual text \"averena che sammanthi\". Vera means hatred. Avera is the negation of hatred. That does not mean love. That's the other end of the stick. So the actual meaning is \"only the lack of hatred will subdue hatred\". The word love is an anachronistic imposition. Of course not everyone translates it as love, but a lot of people do. Sounds nice. \n\nMaybe this applies to many other texts. Please inform me of any other examples, instances, or scholarship that you think is appropriate. And please do provide your views. \n\nThank you very much. \n\nPeace.",

        "text": "I saw a video on YouTube the other day that put some pictures to a high quality audio drama that made me think quite a bit. The video involved three separate Christian people who all went before God on judgment day, only to be told that they apparently didn't do it right or whatever. While they all did good things, prayed, spent their entire lives in church, and believed they accepted Jesus as their savior, they all had traits that God considered to be too malicious to ignore. One of them was only driven by money, another constantly spread a rumors, and the final person was actually a pastor, but apparently didn't put enough emphasis on the concept of sin and \"only preached what would make {him} successful.\"\n\nNow, it's my firm belief that no one deserves to go to hell, and at the very least everyone deserves a consistent loop of potential redemption since torturing people doesn't solve anything. But watching this video did make me wonder, because literally when the pastor questions an angel about the first guy being sent to hell despite spending his entire life in church, the angel responds with: \n\n\"Even now your friend curses at god and curses at you. That is your friend's true nature.\"\n\nIt kind of ticks me off that I'm apparently supposed to be moved by this phrase, and I'm supposed to literally be sitting there thinking: \n\n\"Wow. Who knew a guy who spent his whole life in church would be like that underneath the whole time?\"\n\nWhen instead, I'm thinking, of course he's going to be cursing at God now that he has nothing to lose. He spent his entire life, a life that he now knows could have been spent doing other things that he might have genuinely enjoyed, instead focusing on worshiping a deity who he believed he had to worship in order to not be tortured forever, only to find out that despite all of his sacrifices he still has to be tortured forever anyway. So of course he's going to be upset at the system, this is just like that Netflix show 3% but even worse.\n\nAnd that made me wonder, because there are so many Christians who I've talked to who have certain views about society not not only do I disagree with, but their views wouldn't even really pass in society itself. And yet, when I asked them why they had these views, they never said anything other than it's what they believed God wanted them to think.\n\nSo if that's really true, then I always wondered what their reaction would be if they were faced by their God only to find out that they got it wrong and didn't have the right views, and we're going to hell anyway.\n\nI guess what I'm meaning to ask is, do you think any Christian would end up being sent to hell and yet would be fine with it, and would believe that it was just?",

        "text": " Firstly, it is vital to cite that the Quran directly tells us human beings that the best clothing or garment is the garment of righteousness. \n\nÔÇ∑ Children of Adam, We have sent down for you garments to alleviate your bodies, and feathers; and the garment of righteousness is the best. That is from the signs of God, perhaps they will remember. ‚Äì Quran 7:26 \n\nHijab \n\nHijab is one of the most famous words in the current world. Some use it for distinction, some for slander whilst most do not know what it means. The word Hijab is generally accepted as a veil that women wear to cover their hair and sometimes even the face. The Muslim clerics propagate it as a way of life for women dictating her behaviour, conduct and dress code. This concept is not a Quranic teaching but a later development by humans. \n\nThe word Hijab is cited 7 times in the Quran and never as a piece of clothing. \n\nÔÇ∑ And between them is a Hijab, and on the elevated platform are men who recognized others by their features. And they called out to the dwellers of the Paradise: ‚ÄúPeace be upon you!‚Äù They have not yet entered it, but they are hoping. ‚Äì Quran 7:46 \n\nÔÇ∑ And we place Hijabs over their hearts, that they should not understand it, and a deafness in their ears. And if you mention your Lord in the Qur‚Äôan alone, they run away turning their backs in aversion. ‚Äì Quran 17:46 \n\nÔÇ∑ So she took a Hijab to separate her from them, so We sent Our Spirit to her, and he took on the shape of a human being in all similarity. ‚Äì Quran 19:17 \n\nÔÇ∑ You who believe, do not enter the homes of the prophet unless you are invited to a meal, without you forcing such an invitation. But if you are invited, you may enter. And when you finish eating, you shall leave, without staying to wait for a narrative. This used to bother the prophet, and he was shy to tell you. But God does not shy away from the truth. And if you ask his wives for something, ask them from behind a Hijab. This is purer for your hearts and their hearts. And it is not for you to harm the messenger of God, nor that you should marry his wives after him. This is indeed a gross offence with God. ‚Äì Quran 33:53 \n\nÔÇ∑ He said: ‚ÄúI have enjoyed materialism more than I enjoyed the remembrance of my Lord; until it had set beyond the Hijab!‚Äù ‚Äì Quran 38:32 \n\nÔÇ∑ And they said: ‚ÄúOur hearts are sealed from what you invite us to, and in our ears is a deafness, and there is a Hijab between us and you. So do what you will, and so will we.‚Äù - 41:5 \n\nÔÇ∑ And it is not for any human being that God would speak to him, except through inspiration, or from behind a Hijab, or by sending a messenger to inspire whom He wills with His permission. He is Most High, Wise. ‚Äì Quran 42:51 \n\nCould the word Hijab in any of these verses ever be translated as a clothing or lifestyle for women? These are the only use of the word in the Quran. The word Hijab is always used as a barrier, only contributing to these sentences as behind a barrier, beyond a barrier, or a separation. The verse 17:46 speaks of a barrier over their hearts to connote blindness whilst verse 19:17 talks of Mary who left the family and separated from them where the word Hijab connotes measure to separate from someone. \n\nThus, it is clear that the Hijab (As a head scarf, face cover or behaviour of a woman) is not Islamic, not cited in the Quran, but purely a concoction of later clerics. \n\nu/WiseWords218",

        "text": "When I say religious values, I mean the typical one's even some atheists claim they wish to follow. Doing good things, honesty, integrity, etc etc. \n\nThe new wave of AI has paved way for people to ask questions, cut and paste the answers and pretend they knew the topic all along. It has penetrated religious discussions as well. Of course if you in reverse copy paste it on an AI detection app it will easily tell you that it's AI intervention. Especially when it comes to linguistics, AI cut and pastes give the game away immediately. \n\nBut the phenomena is worrying because AI makes it easier for people to mislead others showing a bogus scholarship on the subject. Especially with languages that are openly available for translation on the internet, copy pasting, etc. This not only deceives others who are not well aware of that particular topic, but also deceives the deceiver because in my opinion, this makes it easier to pretend. For example, a person who lies conveniently can become a pathological liar. The DSM 4 says that deception and lying are common behaviors that occur in benign forms (e.g., in white lies) and in pathological forms, psychiatrically important in antisocial personality disorder and sociopathic behavior, pathological liars, and malingerers. Without reasonably good ego functioning in those areas, a stable, workable transference will not be established. So what happens is, pathological liars become morally corrupt, which makes them not analysable,  and rarely suitable for psychoanalytic treatment. That's in the DSM 4. So the ease of pretence maybe either pathological to some, or/and it will become. Will that become a slippery slope? Could be! Where will that lead? \n\nThis could also be the ruin of discussion in Reddit sooner than later in the future because people will catch on, and they will immediately stop trusting others in their scholarship. Everyone will have to use AI analyser software to even start respecting a human being, and the one's who are doing this pretence will never begin with an ounce of due respect as a human being because \"a thief will think others are thieves\". \n\nThe AI becomes authority, and the deceiver will never have respect for others but AI, and his personal integrity and knowledge or the lack of both makes that person not understand the flaws in AI. \n\nThere was a gentleman in this sub eternally believing AI will be God. I remember the Islamic concept of God. God is what you worship, your focal point of ultimate objective truth. It could be money, property, children, or your own ego/desire. I mean the Qur'an directly says this. Of course among priests, these are all models of God. iLah, not Allah. In Islamic discourse this is idol worship. \n\nAnyway, ultimately do you think AI will become a God for these particular people? Not to those who learn, and use it for the betterment of society, but to the person(s) particularly spoken of in this thread. What are your thoughts? \n\n(Psst: Don't worry. This is what I wrote using my own bad English. Not AI)\n\nThank you very much.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/religion/comments/11jkrs9/archbishop_oscar_romero_liberation_theology_and/",
        "text": "Liberation theology was one of the major theological movements in Christianity in the last century. and it placed a major emphasis on justice and the liberation of the oppressed. These are of course religious themes found in the Biblical corpus themselves which liberation theologians fighting for justice drew from, whether it was in their defense of the indigenous communities in Peru, Guatemala, Brazil or their defense of peasant communities against unjust policies from both authoritarian and unjust policies. This is just an overview of Biblical perspectives that leaders such as Archbishop Oscar Romero drew from in their defense of human rights and justice in their context for those interested.\n\n**(i)The Biblical concept of the Image of God**\n\n* \"*As holy defender of God‚Äôs rights and of his images, the church must cry out. It takes as spittle in its face, as lashes on its back, as the cross in its passion, all that human beings suffer, even though they be unbelievers. They suffer as God‚Äôs images. There is no dichotomy between man and God‚Äôs image. Whoever tortures a human being, whoever abuses a human being, whoever outrages a human being abuses God‚Äôs image, and the church takes as its own that cross, that martyrdom*\"\\_Oscar Romero(The Violence of Love, December 31, 1977 Sermon)\n\n**(ii)The Biblical and Christian concept of sin**\n\n* \"*This is why the church has great conflicts: It accuses of sin. It says to the rich: Do not sin by misusing your money. It says to the powerful: Do not misuse your political influence. Do not misuse your weaponry. Do not misuse your power. Don‚Äôt you see that is a sin? It says to sinful torturers: Do not torture. You are sinning. You are doing wrong. You are establishing the reign of hell on earth*.\"\\_Oscar Romero(The Violence of Love, December 8, 1977 Sermon)\n* \"*It is very easy to be servants of the word without disturbing the world: a very spiritualized word, a word without any commitment to history, a word that can sound in any part of the world because it belongs to no part of the world. A word like that creates no problems, starts no conflicts. What starts conflicts and persecutions, what marks the genuine church, is the word that, burning like the word of the prophets, proclaims and accuses: proclaims to the people God‚Äôs wonders to be believed and venerated, and accuses of sin those who oppose God‚Äôs reign, so that they may tear that sin out of their hearts, out of their societies, out of their laws ‚Äì out of the structures that oppress, that imprison, that violate the rights of God and of humanity*.\"\\_Oscar Romero(The Violence of Love, December 10, 1977 Sermon)\n\n1. The Inspiration for Romero here would have been Biblical prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah who explicitly say \"*Wash yourselves clean. Get your sins out of my sight. Give up your evil ways. Learn to do good. Seek justice. Help the oppressed. Defend the cause of the orphans. Fight for the rights of the widows*\"(Isaiah 1:16-17)\n\n* \"*The Christian must work to exclude sin and establish God‚Äôs reign. To struggle for this is not communism. To struggle for this is not to mix in politics. It is simply that the gospel demands of today‚Äôs Christian more commitment to history.*\"\\_Oscar Romero(The Violence of Love, July 16 1977)\n* \"*The Church, like Jesus, has to go on denouncing sin in our own day. She has to denounce the selfishness that is hidden in everyone's heart, the sin that dehumanizes persons, destroys families, and turns money, possessions, profit, and power into the ultimate ends for which persons strive. And, like anyone who has the smallest degree of foresight, the slightest capacity for analysis, the Church has also to denounce what has rightly been called structural sin: those social, economic, cultural, and political structures that effectively drive the majority of our people onto the margins of society. When the Church hears the cry of the oppressed she cannot but denounce the social structures that give rise to and perpetuate the misery from which the cry arises*.\"\\_Oscar Romero(Second Pastoral Letter, pg 10-11)\n\n**(iii)The Biblical concept of idolatry**\n\n* Idolatry is something that is of course clearly condemned several times in the Bible. In the commandments it states \"*You must not make for yourself an idol of any kind or an image of anything in the heavens or on the earth or in the sea*.\"(Exodus 20:4). Furthermore we see a link between criticism of idolatry and human dignity in the Biblical criticism of human sacrifice when it states \"*Do not permit any of your children to be offered as a sacrifice to Molech, for you must not bring shame on the name of your God. I am the Lord*\"(Leviticus 18:21). This is further developed when we see the Psalmist criticism of the Israelites stating \"*They worshipped their idols, which led to their downfall. They even sacrificed their sons and their daughters to the demons. They shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters. By sacrificing them to the idols of Canaan, they polluted the land with murder*\"(Psalm 106:36-38). Oscar Romero would draw from the Biblical theme of idolatry in the following quotes.\n* \"*This is the right place to draw attention also to the ideology that underlies this unjust repression. I am speaking of the ideology of national security,..This new political theory and practice lies at the root of this situation of repression and of repressive violence against the most basic rights of the Salvadoran people. But because it is an absolutization or idolatry of power, I shall speak of it.....as the church's specific contribution to the crisis in this country, its mission of unmasking idolatries and of denouncing false absolutes*.\"\\_Oscar Romero(Fourth Pastoral Letter, prg 17)\n* \"*Adhering to the demands of the same prophetic denunciation and conversion, the church reminds us that making any created thing into an absolute is an offense against the one Absolute and Creator, because it erects and serves an idol, which it attempts to put in the place of God himself. As well as offending God, every absolutization disorients, and ultimately destroys, human beings....When a human value is turned into an absolute and endowed, whether in theory or in practice, with a divine character, human beings are deprived of their highest calling and inspiration. The spirit of the people is pushed in the direction of a real idolatry, which will only deform and repress it*.\"\\_Oscar Romero(Fourth Pastoral Letter, prg 42)\n* \"*The omnipotence of these national security regimes, the total disrespect they display towards individuals and their rights, the total lack of ethical consideration shown in the means that are used to achieve their ends, turn national security into an idol, which, like the god Molech, demands the daily sacrifice of many victims in its name. The legitimate security that the state ought to seek for its members is cruelly perverted, for in the name of national security the insecurity of the individual becomes institutionalized*\"\\_Oscar Romero(Fourth Pastoral Letter, prg 48)\n* \"*Denouncing idolatry has always been a mission of the prophets and of the church. It‚Äôs no longer the god Baal, but there are other dreadful gods in our time: the god of money, the god of power, the god of luxury, the god of lust. So many gods enthroned among us! Hosea‚Äôs voice could say to today‚Äôs Christians: Don‚Äôt mix those idolatries with the worship of the true God! You can‚Äôt serve two lords, the true God and money. You can follow only one*\"\\_Oscar Romero(Violence of Love, June 11, 1978 Sermon)\n* \"*That reign of God finds itself hindered, manacled, by many idolatrous misuses of money and power. Those false gods must be overthrown...Today the idols are different. They are called money, they are called political interests, they are called national security. As idolatries, they are trying to displace God from his altar. The church declares that people can be happy only when, like the magi, they adore the one true God*.\"\\_Oscar Romero(Violence of Love, January 7, 1979 Sermon)\n\n**(iv)Christ's Parable of the Sheep and the Goats, Final Judgement and the Poor**\n\n* Jesus's Parable of the Sheep and the Goats is a simple Parable that speaks about heaven and hell using the metaphor of sheeps and goats. The Sheep represent those who pursue social justice for the oppressed. The Goats those who stand against this. Christ states clearly that when you defend the oppressed you are reverencing me, saying \"*For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me*\"(Matthew 25:35-36)\n* Both Oscar Romero and the practitioners of Liberation theology saw this as divine and sacred marching orders to be in solidarity with the oppressed in their defense of human rights. Fr Leonardo Boff from Brazil explains this when stating \"*the poor are also the workers exploited by the capitalist system; the underemployed, those pushed aside by the production process-a reserve army always at hand to take the place of the employed; they are the laborers of the countryside, and migrant workers with only seasonal work. All this mass of the socially and historically oppressed makes up the poor as a social phenomenon. In the light of faith, Christians see in them the challenging face of the Suffering Servant, Jesus Christ. At first there is silence, silent and sorrowful contemplation, as if in the presence of a mystery that calls for introspection and prayer. Then this presence speaks. The Crucified in these crucified persons weeps and cries out: \"I was hungry ... in prison ... naked\"(Matt. 25:31-46). Here what is needed is not so much contemplation as effective action for liberation. The Crucified needs to be \"raised to life. We are on the side of the poor only when we struggle alongside them against the poverty that has been unjustly created and forced on them. Service in solidarity with the oppressed also implies an act of love for the suffering Christ, a liturgy pleasing to God*.\"\\_Fr Leonardo Boff(Introduction to Liberation theology, pg 3-4)\n* This is further explained by other Liberation theologians who state \"*Today we cannot define the meaning of life without facing up to the poor, or without declaring ourselves in relation to the crucial conflict of our age: the peoples against the great powers...Thomas Aquinas states that all human beings, by performing a first rational act, define themselves in some way as being for or against God, even if God has not been explicitly proclaimed to them. This is because we are brought up against the most serious questions about our lives, about reality: the meaning of reality, of history, of humanity, of our own being in the reality of poverty we are confronted by the One who said: \"just as you did it to one of the least of these who are members of my family, you did it to me\" (Matt. 25:40);*\"\\_Pedro Casaldaliga(The Spirituality of Liberation, pg 24-25)\n\n**(v)The Christian concept of conversion**\n\n* \"*A spirituality of liberation will center on a conversion to the neighbor, the oppressed person, the exploited social class, the despised ethnic group, the dominated country. Our conversion to the Lord implies this conversion to the neighbor. Evangelical conversion is indeed the touchstone of all spirituality. Conversion means a radical transformation of ourselves; it means thinking, feeling and living as Christ-present in exploited and alienated persons. To be converted is to commit oneself lucidly, realistically, and concretely to the process of the liberation of the poor and oppressed*\"\\_Fr Gustavo Gutierrez(Spiritual Writings, pg 48)\n* \"*In this new epoch of the Church's history, what has always been true has become still more evident: there is need for conversion. As Medellin puts it, for our authentic liberation, all of us need a profound conversion....The Church is here speaking not only of the conversion that others ought to bring about in their lives, but is speaking in the first instance of her own conversion. This awareness of her own need for conversion is, historically, something very new, though it was said of the Church in the past that she always had to be reformed (semper reformanda). The pressure for this conversion came not only when the Church looked inward, at herself, with her defects and her sins, but also when she looked outward, at the sins of the world. The Church has regained the basic attitude for conversion, which is to turn toward those who are especially lowly, poor, and weak. Like Christ, we should have pity on the multitudes weighed down with hunger, misery, and ignorance. We want to fix a steady gaze on those who still lack the help they need to achieve a way of life worthy of human beings...It is in this encounter with the world of the poor that one finds the most pressing need for conversion*\"\\_Oscar Romero(Second Pastoral Letter, pg 6)\n\n**(vi)The Biblical concept of the Exodus**\n\n* In the Biblical text one of the central events is the Exodus. The Israelites leaving Egypt. And a major aspect of this narrative is liberation where God says \"*I have certainly seen the oppression of my people in Egypt. I have heard their cries of distress because of their harsh slave drivers. Yes, I am aware of their suffering. So I have come down to rescue them from the power of the Egyptians and lead them out out of Egypt into their own fertile and spacious land. It is a land flowing with milk and honey-the land where the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites now live. Look! The cry of the people of Israel has reached me, and I have seen how harshly the Egyptians abuse them. Now go, for I am sending you to Pharaoh. You must lead my people Israel out of Egypt*\"(Exodus 3:7-10)\n* The story of the Exodus would be very important for liberation theologians in their struggle against exploitation systematic oppression, and these theologians themselves report that it was one of the favourite narrative of the oppressed. In explaining the significant of the Exodus, theologians such as Fr Gutierrez state the following: \"*Creation, as we have mentioned....is a historical-salvific fact which structures the faith of Israel. And this fact is a political liberation through which Yahweh expresses his love for his people and the gift of total liberation is received*\"\\_Fr Gustavo Gutierrez(A Theology of Liberation, pg 156)\n* \"*Yahweh summons Israel not only to leave Egypt but also and above all to bring them out of that country into a fine and broad land, a land flowing with milk and honey. The Exodus is the long march towards the promised land in which Israel can establish a society free from misery and alienation. Throughout the whole process the religious event is not set apart. It is placed in the context of the entire narrative; or more precisely it is its deepest meaning. It is the root of the situation. In the last instance , it is in this event that the dislocation introduced by sin is resolved and justice and injustice, oppression and liberation are determined. Yahweh liberates the Jewish people politically in order to make them a holy nation....the God of the Exodus is the God of history and political liberation*\"\\_Fr Gustavo Gutierrez(A Theology of Liberation, pg 157)\n\nSo these are just some ways in which the Biblical texts informed perspectives of liberation theologians in their views on justice. Much more could be said on this but this is just a theological run down in bite size quotes for those interested.",

First post here. \n\nAs I was first baptized as an Orthodox Christian, I wouldn't say I like all the \"rules\" but as I was living with all orthodox people, that wasn't such a big deal, however, I have moved to France now, and there are barely any orthodox churches around the area, so basically, on Sundays, if I'm not hungover, I go to the one's that are open or are closest to my place. \n\nNow, I find it quite embarrassing sometime's that I don't know the rules, nor do I have to courage to randomly go to people and ask them \"yo, which religion do you do here?\" so instead, I am looking for the best parts of religions that you considered to be useful, or pleasurable.  \n\n\nAs an example, I find kneeling better than free bowing. I find Jesus Great, even a God in His time,but in our times, I find that only God can provide the Holy Spirit for people... but back to my point.  \nDo you have any favorite parts of the service? and what are those?",

        "text": " \n\nI'm a content creator and I needed someone to edit something for me. I didn't liked that he sometimes says things like \"O my Fu... God\" and stuff like that, it kinda makes me think he's an atheist, well the thing is, he edited my content and when the content is done edited I paid him, but I felt uncomfortable due to him mentioning things like that. Later I knew he used titles in his streams mentioning Andrew Tate to get clicks now im even more sad.\n\nThe work is good, I spent a huge amount of hours into it. I paid him, but I don't know if I want to post that work he edited because I would have to credit him. I realize that working with an atheist is not a bad thing as long as it doesn't get to my beliefs. But what he said and using Andrew Tate is not cool for me.\n\nAnyways, I edited the content myself and I actually got something good, but I still think the first one is good as well.\n\n2 questions, what if I post the one I edited. Am I discriminating?\n\nWhat if I post the one he edited? am I not being religious? I'm stuck.",

        "text": "I was raised devout Catholic, however, started questioning everything when I was in college. It was there where I found Buddhism, which made so much sense to me and improved the quality of my life. Fast forward 20+ years and I continue to benefit from Buddhist teachings and follow the 5 Precepts. I had a freak incident which landed me in the hospital (finger got caught in a hand blender!) and while I was in the hospital bed alone, thinking about my own mortality, it suddenly dawned on me that the Buddhist idea of Reincarnation brings me absolutely no peace, only fear, and that I may need another path that doesn't completely terrify me! The one thing that brought me peace when I was Catholic was the thought of heaven, however I've tried to read the Bible multiple times and it just doesn't make sense or sound believable to me.\nMy question is, is there a religion out there that is similar to Buddhism, yet believes in an afterlife such as heaven? The thought of reincarnation brings me zero peace. As I get older I feel like I need some sort of religion or spirituality to get through life. \nThank you.",

        "text": "A discussion I was having with a friend a few days ago was about the idea of having a God of Death that isn't seen as evil or scary.\n\nWe couldn't think of any actual known God of Death that wasn't in some way portrayed as villainous or terrifying. Gods of Death or at least related to Death that we could think of were:\n\n\\- Hades, frequently represented as evil\n\n\\- Grim Reaper, represented as a dark, terrifying figure with a giant scythe\n\n\\- Hel, frequently portrayed as malevolent or at least as cold and unsympathetic\n\n\\- Nuestra Senora de la Santa Muerte, frequently associated with the criminal underworld, portrayed as a skeleton\n\n\\- Baron Samedi, as I understood, can appear in several forms, one being sadistic and chaotic\n\nYou see what I mean. So my question is if there's actually any Death Deities that aren't considered as malevolent or sinister, but that are considered benevolent or that simply exist to comfort humans in their fear of death.\n\nI'm genuinely curious and any interpretation is welcome.",

        "text": "So I have this issue with a friend.\n\n \n\nThis said friend edited a video of mine. I haven't posted the video yet, but even though I paid him I feel bad for not wanting to post what he did. Here's why, he have said things like \"O my F.... God\" and he used Andrew Tate in his title (he's a streamer) to get clicks. I honestly don't like that and while the work he did does not relate to anything of what he says or do. I don't feel comfortable to post the hard work I did just because he edited.\n\nWhat I did after tho, I edited it myself and with another person, I paid the other person, but now? I feel like I can't post the video, because OCD basically says \"you should not have avoided the edited video from the other guy.\" \"you need to post the video he edited or you're discriminating because of his beliefs (maybe he's an atheist idk)\"\n\nBut if I don't post the video then I feel punished, I feel I discriminated and feel bad. I said to myself that as long as he doesn't interfere with my beliefs I'm good, but even though I like a bit what I and another person edited. I still feel like I can't post it.\n\nIn other words, I didn‚Äôt feel great knowing he would be an atheist and what he said on his streams made me uncomfortable. I paid him for his work, but it‚Äôs hard for me to upload any work wether it‚Äôs mine or his because if I upload his then it still needs fixing, if I upload mine it‚Äôs ok, but then ocd tells me im discriminating because of what I thought in the past, which was wrong I don‚Äôt think the same now. I thought that working with a possible atheist is bad. I thought wrong. As long as he doesnt interfere with my beliefs it should be good.\n\nwhat if I add something he edited?",

        "text": "**A Kafir is not what you think?**\n\nI have witnessed many discussions, both face to face and remote where some Muslims call Christians and Jews as Kafirs and Christians and Jews call themselves Kafirs. We should understand what Kafir means from the context of the Quran and the language at the time the Quran was revealed.\n\nThis word Kafir has evolved in its meaning and understanding due to worldly occurrences. The phenomenon that changed the meaning of this word is debatable and bears no value of discussion, but the fact is not only Christians or Jews are called Kafirs, Muslims are too.\n\nIt is personal experience of us Muslims to hear one sect call another sect by the word Kafir. Animosity of this nature exists in this world and if everyone is correct, there are seven billion Kafirs in this world.\n\nA simile of the evolution of what this word means is cops being called pigs in modern times. The original use of the derogative term pig being used on cops is known to have occurred in around the 1811 where \"pig\" was denoted to a Bow Street Runner, the police force. The reference has seemingly re-emerged in the late sixties. The modern dictionaries pronounce it as a slang for a policeman.\n\nIs it not unbelievable that within such a short time a word that was referred to a swine has grown to be referred to a cop? Similarly, think of the word Kafir evolving through 1400 years.\n\nA Kafir is someone who knows a truth and hides it\n\nThe first occurrences of the term Kafir occurs in the second chapter of the Quran.\n\nÔÇ∑ As for those who Kafaroo , whether you warn them or do not warn them, they will not believe. ‚Äì Quran 2:6\n\nÔÇ∑ Or like a storm cloud from the sky, in it is darkness and thunder and lightning. They place their fingers in their ears from the thunder-claps for fear of death; and God is aware of the Kafirs (Bialkafireena). ‚Äì Quran 2:19\n\nAn exploration of the chapter in concern in context of the surrounding verse will expound the true intention of this allusion. Below you will find a summary of this chapter‚Äôs philosophy.\n\nÔÇ∑ The Quran is revealed to the righteous, who believe in the unseen, who believe in this and the previous revelations.\n\nÔÇ∑ As for those who see the truth and hide it maliciously commonly referred to as rejecter‚Äôs they will not believe in the truth if you inform them or not\n\nÔÇ∑ Their hearts and ears are sealed, and they are blind. They will proclaim to believe in God and there‚Äôs a last day but only lie.\n\nÔÇ∑ They will claim to be good but the will spread corruption. When they meet those who acknowledge the truth they lie saying they do too\n\nThere are no references to religions, races or any denomination. A Kafir could be a person who calls himself a Muslim as you can see above that when a Kafir meets one who has acknowledged the truth they lie to you saying they also do accept the truth. Right at the beginning of the Quran God has explained what a Kafir is, therefore it is high time that people woke up and realised that they may have been mistaken all their lives.\n\nOf course it is common that most of us were taught otherwise throughout our lives. The Quran tells you to not follow what your society has taught you blindly.\n\nÔÇ∑ And if you obey most of those on the earth, they will lead you away from the path of God; that is because they follow conjecture, and that is because they only guess. ‚Äì Quran 6:115\n\nAnd don‚Äôt worry if others don‚Äôt believe\n\nÔÇ∑ And most of the people, even if you are diligent, will not believe. ‚Äì Quran 12:103\n\nu/ApostateAladdin",

        "text": " The first time I heard about this so called \"Taqiyyah\" was from a Christian theology student. When he repeatedly mentioned this word I thought it was Taqiya or school. I was wondering why this guy was talking about a school. Lol. It was some time ago of course and later I read up on it but I have been to Taqiya or school since childhood and known many Muslims (being one myself) but I have never ever heard of this Taqiyyah but non-muslims know more about it than any muslim I have ever met in my life. And when you ask other Muslims they haven't met anyone who knew about it. Its strange, but its true. \n\nWhen asked, an Ishmaeli religious leader who visited us was the first man to know and explain about this \"Taqiyyah\" to me. According to him Taqiyyah was a concept that justifies a Shia Muslim to keep his faith beliefs inside himself and not practice it outwardly in the face of persecution or death threats by anyone. Even he asked me 'why do you ask' because no one has ever asked him that question. Because it never comes up. Being a Shia Muslim himself, being a holy-man, even he didn't know any Muslim who ever spoke of this. Again, strange but true. \n\nAs far as I knew, Taqiyyah means righteous or god fearing. In the true sense of the word it is that sense of righteousness one has that speaks to your heart holding you back from committing a sin. That voice that speaks to you telling you 'help that man' and you turn back if you have walked past a man wanting money but you may have thought he is swindling you. Its the thought that holds you back from hurting your mothers feelings. Well, that's what we know. But strangely, the non-muslim tells me otherwise. No no no. Taqiyya means to lie. Its a central teaching in Islam he says. \n\nAccording to the waging non-muslim, Taqiyya is a central teaching in Islam not known to muslims. Does that statement sound strange to you? Muslims themselves learned this from them. Know in your heart that those who wield this weapon online are duping you. Because anyone who has done any kind of study can never think this to be true. They have to be lying or ignorant. \n\nQuran uses this word when referring to righteousness. \n\n19:12 ‚ÄúO John, take the Book with confidence.‚Äù And We gave him authority while in his youth.\n\n19:13 And tenderness from Us, and purity, and he was ever righteous (Thaqiyyah).\n\n19:14 And dutiful to his parents, and never was he a disobedient tyrant.\n\nSo its not the meaning of the word that people are messing around with, its a concept. However what should be stated is that those who propagate this don't know what it means. Why? Because they don't intend to know. This is just a tool.",
