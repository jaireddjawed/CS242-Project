So they take it and sell it but they eventually kill it. \n\nI know Mr. Hayes reading of \"The Heart of Darkness\" plays into this theme somehow but I don't know how as I've never read the book.

        "author": "rx034",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/89kn47/classic_films_melodrama_fused_with_horror/",
        "text": "I've been watching a ton of classic films from the 1930s, 40s and 50s and I noticed something that a lot of these films have in common: melodrama with elements of horror integrated in.\n\n**SPOILERS BELOW**\n\nI've been watching chronologically and I first noticed this fusion in *Gone With The Wind* (1939), perhaps the finest melodrama. The first hour or so of the film contains scenes shot during the daytime, lots of bright blue's and yellow's, but as the film progresses towards its 4-hour mark, you'll notice that scenes get darker and darker (with the effect of dark rooms lit dimly with candlelight) and during the last half of the film, most of the scenes are shot during the evening or at nighttime.  I can't really explain it but this effect of light transitioning to dark gives me this spooky feeling, which is complemented by scenes of increasing absurdities and cruelties as the film progresses. When Scarlet returns home and finds Tara deserted, its interesting how much of this seems like a horror film. Her now seemingly-senile father with an expression that evokes Frankenstein, opening the door to a dark, dingy house where everything has gone wrong. I swear it's as if a ghost might emerge from the shadows at any minute. But nothing captivates me more and gives me that dreadful feeling than the last hour of the film, where melodrama truly blends with horror. I want to bring your attention to that huge red staircase in Scarlet and Rhett's new home, where, if you pay attention, you'll notice something always goes wrong as characters ascend or descend it (e.g. Scarlet falling down the stairs and having a miscarriage, Rhett carrying Scarlet up the stairs one midnight to presumably rape her, etc.) And of course that staircase has to be blood red, as if to anticipate the dread. It's such a weird fusion of genres and for some reason, it continues to amuses me. And yet no one has ever referred to *Gone With The Wind* as a horror film or a spooky film, and indeed, it doesn't intend to be one. It almost unconsciously gives off that feeling of horror.\n\nLet's look at a few other films from this period. One of my absolute favorites, *Black Narcissus* (1947). You don't see elements of horror until the last quarter of the film, but they play out so well. Sister Clodagh walking into Sister Ruth's dark blue room, with the closeups on Ruth's face, all red eyes and makeup which makes her seem demonic. Then Clodagh falling asleep after a game of \"who can stay up the longest\" and Ruth creepily vanishing out of the room to find Mr. Dean. She runs out screaming and her voice echoes a thousand times as if summoning ghosts. Of course I have to mention that finale, with Ruth stepping outside as if she is Satan herself, her pale face, blood-red eyes and scraggly hair blowing in the wind as she approaches Clodagh to push her off the cliff. But again, it's not a horror film, and nor does it intend to be.\n\nOne more melodramatic film I'd like to mention, *East of Eden* (1955). This one uses music brilliantly to accentuate elements of horror. There's *Jaws*-style thump-thump music as Aron is nervously approaching his mom who he doesn't know exists. But Kazan also employs these tilted camera angles (like in *The Third Man*), again always at nighttime, to convey that feeling of unease. James Dean is yelling at his father on the swing, and the camera also tilts back and forth like the swing, and it gives off such a weird feeling. The characters might be spitting out the cheesiest lines but they are intensified by this dark, brooding atmosphere and I can't help but be captivated by all this.\n\nWhich gets me thinking...there's no more horror elements in drama films of today (or very little I should say). That strange blend of melodrama and horror elements seems to be relegated to the past, and yet, I can't explain why this cocktail works so well. You can watch one of these older, classic melodramas and immediately point out these elements are outdated, but to me, I find it has helped lots of these films hold up well throughout the decades. I find it even more interesting than the horror-comedy, because while these films specifically intend to have both horror and comedic elements, the melodrama-horror that I have mentioned does not intend to have both of these genres working side-by-side. The melodrama of that time simply evoked that uneasy, brooding feeling, and these strange scenes have become etched into my memory (that red staircase in *Gone With The Wind* has continually haunted me).\n\nHave any of you felt this? Any specific examples you want to give?",

It's tragic how Caden is still struggling and meandering in his 40s to create something of value that's meaningful to him. He's obsessed with finding purpose, finding some sort of predetermined path to walk on. He moves from relationship to relationship never really paying attention to the little moments; we see fragments of his memory; but the second you look closely to examine it everything evaporates. A truly surreal representation of the ephemera of life. The realization that you're aging, dying, with life slipping you back. It really shows you, visually the sad existence of an average man's path through life and his acceptance of it. In that way, it's truly scary. \n\nThe fact that everything was transient and slipping away from him, his lovers, his relationship with his wife(and daughter), his inability to complete his project.

        "text": "I often see the ending to this film discussed as nihilistic and a representation of John Doe winning because his ‚Äúprophecy‚Äù is fulfilled, but what exactly did he prove? all people including the detective can be corrupted into evil? it contradicts everything he had been preaching and punishing for. All other victims of his murders were sinners, but Mills fought as a signal of ‚Äúhope‚Äù in the dark world despite all of his judgement, flaws, and possible self serving motivation to do so. If John Doe had been proving that we ignore sins it seems that turning someone evil would contradict what he was preaching. I do recall him saying ‚Äúwe were never the plan‚Äù in reference to humanity though. \n\nThis draws me to my interpretation of the ending, we see Somerset struggling with the world around him, and he even has similar feelings to John Doe, he doesn‚Äôt think he is crazy (as he states to Mills multiple times) he thinks the world and the people in it are. But ultimately in the end he sides with the other philosophy presented in the film, and that is Mills. John Doe was indeed a complex character who believed his intentions, but the turning of Somerset into a character who chooses to face the evil head on after his relationship with Mills shows that John Doe‚Äôs method of turning the world would never have any impact, he was inherently wrong. Facing ‚Äúsins‚Äù and ‚Äúevil‚Äù with perseverance and good is the only real impact we can have. \n\nLove Fincher‚Äôs work and the risk he took by making a film so edgy and dark, would love to here others opinions on the film and ending.

Through the use of Brechtian technique with strange abrupt cuts, changes from grainy color to black and white to high definition color, verbalized onomatopoeia during a scene that presages sexual violence, etc; he is constantly reminding the audience that they are watching a movie. He does this to a lesser extent in all of his other movies of course but this is really the movie that does it best. \n\n\nWhat makes it even greater here too is that the aesthetic elements parallel the structural ones as we go from grainy in the first, misogynistic half, to HD in the second feminist half, with black and white separating the two (to signal just how different each half is from the other.) Speaking of halves, I‚Äôve never seen a movie that so successfully sets itself up to be something only to completely tear itself down.\n\nThe first half is obviously a grindhouse horror flick and the second is a feminist revenge movie. Even the girl characters are written in such starkly different ways (perhaps embodying the two archetypes of strong female characters). The first half characters are intensely self-sexualized beings who get ahead as a result of how beautiful they are and are proud of being objectified (the billboard girl and the lapdance, which incidently is really well shot.) The second half on the other hand are a lot less intensely attractive and self-sexualized (except for the cheerleader who ends up getting taken advantage of, or so we are to assume.) Even their discussion of men is a lot more aggressively dismissive (joking about how the killer has such a large car to compensate for his small penis, discussing their sex lives as mere details in their overarching lives, ultimately they are much more interested in other things like cars.)\n\nOn top of that his signature over the top bloody action sequences are really dialed up to 11 here. The main crash scene is extraordinarily gruesome and stylized and well shot with multiple different points of view (emphasizing the movie‚Äôs self-referential nature during a critical moment of violence.)\n\nAdd to all of that the fact that Tarantino is in top form with his dialogue, soundtrack, and photography and you end up with one of Tarantino‚Äôs best and a movie that is able to indulge in its violence and its revenge as entertainment without seeming tasteless and childish.",

Not buying it.\n\nI know these are minor things to be concerned with. I just think that things like this are used as cop outs.

So, if a character says ‚ÄòJesus is the truth‚Äô that doesn‚Äôt mean the film maker(s) feel that way. Man, I thought that was an obvious one, but I guess not (Devil‚Äôs advocate anyone??). I found this film to be about science, ¬†skepticism, credulity, wonder, and special pleading. When Jodie travels through space, but comes back with no evidence to show (darn that guy for hiding the 18 hours of static) she seems to forget for a moment there what it means to be a skeptic. She tells the world of her profound journey and expects the world to believe her. It‚Äôs not until her and her claims are on trial that she admits that, if in the other shoe, she would find herself in the same state of incredulity. After this realization, she holds her belief of the experience, but realizes she cannot beg for special pleading. When the kid asks her of other life in the universe, she doesn‚Äôt make a proclamation of certainty, but instead promotes skepticism.¬†¬†A theme of the film is absolutely skepticism vs faith. And a lot of us are too quick to judge people in this realm; some say scientists lack meaning, some say the faithful lack common sense. Carl didn‚Äôt seem to feel this way. He obviously was an advocate for science and he felt that being faithful was part of our nature (however harmful) , and not a flaw of someone‚Äôs character. That instead of making assumptions about what‚Äôs wrong with someone who is faithful, perhaps we can have empathy for why they are that way, and how easily anyone of us could have gotten there. He even shows how scientists can fall prey to credulity through Jodie‚Äôs desire to make contact. No one is safe.Contact is the quintessential film on skepticism, showing how all of us can fall prey to credulity. That why we believe something is just as important as what we believe. It‚Äôs about understanding the difference between personal convictions and shared knowledge. And how we should never stop questioning our convictions, be open to arguments and evidence, and never stop searching for contact with the truth.\n\nThis film is easily a 10/10\nI‚Äôm not a huge fan of the director, but he was PERFECT for Contact. The sentimentality wouldn‚Äôt have been portrayed better by anyone else. \nThe film has aged well, both technically and in substance. \nDebate me if you think otherwise ",

But in my most recent viewing, I started to realize that the main plot almost seems like it's not *supposed* to be the main focus. The main plot seems like a vehicle to sow the side plots together into a story, aka the \"Seven Psychopaths.\" The film addresses a lot of the problems the film has through commentary on the script in the main plot. But does the fact that these problems are brought to the forefront excuse these very problems in the first place? ",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/88zyxm/a_launching_point_technologic_specificity_in/",
        "text": "This is taken directly from my letterboxd review of the movie, but I wanted to post it here to generate a larger discussion:\n--\nI will avoid a wide and spoiler-heavy reading of this work and delegate that task to a later day. Maybe when it leaves theaters and I gain some distance from it. I am already making plans to see this movie again. Sadly, \"Unsane\" will not receive the attention it deserves because it is overshadowed by movies as bad and forgettable as \"Annihilation\" and ones that are currently culturally relevant, such as \"Isle of Dogs\". But, the truth here is that, this movie will be uncovered as a gem in the filmography of Soderbergh during some sort of retrospective.\n\nShot entirely on an iPhone 7 Plus, the movie procures a texture that is familiar to our eyes, but defamiliarizes itself on the big screen. In the digital age, when many devices are capable of recording video and taking pictures, it takes a movie like this for us to recognize the possible variations of visual language in high-budget films. Far from the glossy sheen that is found in most Hollywood movies, or even the grain you would see in a 35- or 16mm presentation at some Art House Cinema, Soderbergh's choice brings up questions about technologic specificity that are relevant to a greater appreciation of this film.\n\nThe point I am trying to make here is this: Soderbergh does not intend to hide the photographic with heightened verisimilitude, the idea here is not immersion in a fantastical sense. What I believe that this film showcases is that technology can contain human elements. Yes, I said it, a technological language that is human. \"Unsane\" approaches the relationship between the technical and the formal in a similar way David Lynch does in \"Inland Empire\". Lynch's film, which utilizes a standard definition camera encapsulates how more familiar modes of technology inform a movie formally and tonally. \"Inland Empire\" showcases how a baroque and opulent film can be made from technology that is seen as \"inferior.\" Formally, we see a compensation in both \"Unsane\" and \"Inland Empire\" for the deficiencies of both cameras and their lens': close-up shots are heavily utilized, contrasts are murky, lighting is more purposefully evident, etc. Through and through, \"Unsane\" uses formal elements which are of the now, ones which are a part of our camera and video taking experience as phone users. This visual language being placed on the big screen is not distasteful and overly campy, but something that is alluring and more genuine.\n\nI use the word genuine here as trigger, a launching point, a necessary crutch for the speedy digestion I am doing. It is similar to me stating that this use of technology is human because it is familiar to our eyes. Briefly, I think this is upheld by the narrative itself and its elements. The narrative proper attempts to grapple with an inverted psychic portrayal of paranoia that is rooted in sight and its veracity. The exposition unfolds, unforced, and its employment of non-parodic references and familiar language show an attention to the present. The acting by Claire Foy (Sawyer Valentini), Jay Pharaoh (Nate Hoffman), and Joshua Leonard (David Strine) are absorptive. This is the point I am trying to make, this movie culminates in an absorptive experience that the most \"life-like\" war movie does not and can not portray (or maybe just in a different way - a \"cinematic experience\").\n\nI want to try to understand how this usage of technology mediates the viewer's experience of the aesthetic, formal, and tonal expressions of the film. Is the utilization of \"inferior\" technology a way of resisting the passive experience of viewing? Do these efforts to familiarize the palette align with the narrative and its elements? Does using an iPhone amount to nothing more than novelty? Or, on the contrary, does the use of the iPhone erect a bridge between the world being portrayed and our very own through the integration of what I have dubbed the familiar? Lastly, if we propose to set \"Unsane\" in opposition to the aesthetic of the cinematic experience, we may wonder what defines this aforementioned aesthetic and how does it create a contrasting affect?\n\nI believe an interrogation of these concerns can begin with a provocation about contemporary installation art by Boris Groys. For Groys, installation art is \"material 'par excellence,'\" through its inclusion of the \"real\" into the neutral space of the museum (read: cinema). The recontextualization of familiar objects inside of a neutral (and institutional) space gives us \"an opportunity to exhibit [ourselves] to [ourselves].\"",

        "text": "(SPOILERS)\n\nJust watched Leon: the Professional last night and wanted to see what everyone thought of it. I often see discussions about new releases on here, but not many about older movies. So, what did you like and dislike about it? What would you have done differently? Why? What wee your favourite moments?\n\nIn my opinion, it was a fairly well crafted film. I gave it a 7/10 because it was enjoyable but it didn't personally speak to me enough to boost the rating. I think the first act and about halfway through the second act is really, really well done. The film does such a great job at setting up the characters and the world they live in. From the very first shot, we see New York City. A place that's been shown many times in film, but the way it's filmed in this movie makes it feel somehow foreign and as if we're about to dive into a world we've never been to. And that's exactly what happens. Leon's character is fantastic! He's shown as this scary, hard surfaced guy until he comes home and we see that he's just like the rest of us, despite what he does for a living. This is stressed even more when Matilda comes into his life. From the first time they interact, we're shown that he has feelings and emotions and he can't just shut them out, like we sort of expected. When Matilda comes home after her family has been killed, we see him struggle to decide wether to help her or turn a blind eye to it. \n\nAnother moment I liked was during the montage of Matilda and Leon going through their days. At the end of it, Matilda is seen wearing black next to Leon who is also wearing black. To me, this signifies that they are finally a team. Matilda had learned what she needs to and they can work together perfectly. Leon's glasses work as sort of a hard shell. He wears them when he works and when Matilda is shown wearing them, we know something is up. I know milk is supposed to be a strong signifier of something but I forget right at this moment. I think it has to do with power. \n\nThat's pretty much all I have to say. I picked up a lot more but it's hard for me to remember right now. What were your thoughts?",

        "text": "Following below contains spoilers for this film and a slight spoiler for Lars Von Trier's AntiChrist (I tagged it to where you have to hover over the Spoiler highlight to read the connection). \n\nSaw this on Netflix. While nothing groundbreaking I did find it interesting. Beautiful cinematography (on a budget too), eerie soundtrack, good acting, compelling story. With that said, I have a lot of questions about the story. Not sure if there are answers but maybe someone has an interpretation.\n\nFirst off I wonder what caused these events, although like a lot of Sci-fi films it's not that important, I wonder if anyone has a theory? I'm ok with accepting there is no answer other than Alien stuff since I feel thats the most they reveal.\n\nMy biggest question is how do the two Helena's relate? Being the film is about two women named Helena, I'd assume there is a big connection. What I got so far was both had something to do with babies. The older H with her weird doll thing (that is totally a taxidermy baby right?), and younger H with her, false pregnancy (that I think it's safe to assume the ..aliens or whatever took it?). Outside of that I don't really see much in common with the two.. I just feel there might be something I'm not getting. The ending imagery with the missing people and young H. in the fetal position hints more at the baby thing, just not exactly sure what it means. My guess is maybe Older H lost a baby in her life time and Younger H is mirroring that? \nAnother theory is maybe it's as simple as both of them are on a side of abduction? I read on a bkmag review that this film could have something to do with Helena of Troy (the film takes place in Troy, NY). The connection I see with Helena of Troy is she was abducted. So maybe there is no deeper connection other than they wanted to give two different sides of an abduction story (one goes missing, one has their spouse go missing), using two Helena's? Maybe, to bring back the baby point, maybe it's about abduction of an unborn child since younger H had hers taken away and maybe something in the past happened to a child of older H's?\n\n\nI just realized that a lot of this film reminded me of Lars Von Trier's AntiChrist. [Spoiler](/s \"Both movies involve women descending into either madness or serious depression after the trauma of losing a child, or at the very least, a loved one.\") ...........This makes me think, maybe this film might have something to do with the two H's mental health? In which they mirror each other/have a connection that way?\n\nIf anyone has seen this film and would like to chime in, please do! If not I suggest giving this film a look. It might not be for everyone though. Thanks for reading my ramblings.  \n\n\nEdit: I also noticed a small connection with both the husbands/boyfriends. The older one was describing how he wishes his wife would disappear, but he ends up disappearing. The younger boyfriend has his girlfriend disappear/die. Not sure if this adds anything but that was an interesting connection I noticed. \n\nAnother small thing: What was with Younger H's boyfriend's eye? Never got an explanation. \n\n\n",

Like \"omg how dare they cast this major anglosaxon historical figure with an italian\" gives way to just appreciating that the actor is good and it doesn't distract. \n\nI was also reminded of how the rising acceptance and popularity of the idea of casting a black actor as James Bond, or as Spiderman, tracks improving attitudes in that regard. Hamilton also enjoyed a lot of approval (and pushback, from those who deemed it white-washing) due to its race-bending, and iirc there were talks of maybe making many male roles such as George Washington open to male and female singers.\n\nAnyway, I wonder how far off we are from being able to casually entertain the idea of a biopic of a major really existing historical white guy figure, being played by someone of a very different race, or a woman.",

        "text": "First off I'd like to say that I did enjoy the film and I can appreciate the work behind it. It does certainly deserve spot as one of the greatest films of all time, but I did have one major problem with it: the ending.\n\nAm I really supposed to believe that the three of them started a family together? I perceived it as that the tramp is allowed to come visit their home but that the mother will go on to raise the kid. In my eyes the mother was practically a kidnapper and the tramp was practically the father, so to see her just automatically assume that it's fine just because she's the biological mother (and he's a tramp) removed any sympathy I had for her. After she abandoned the kid the Tramp took responsibility and raised him for her. If her plan had gone well then I'm positive she would have let the wealthy family keep him while she went on in her selfish ways, but because he ended up with a tramp then she can do whatever she wants to the tramp and the kid. This film (and some of Chaplin's other films) explores how unfairly the poor and homeless are treated by society and the authorities, but by the end it just gives one big final F-You to him and masks it as a happy ending. The final message of the film seems to be that if you're a tramp you'll always be worth less than others and your best efforts and kindness will at best be rewarded with a quick \"thanks\" followed by you getting a door slammed in your face. The ending tries to avert that by welcoming him into their home but once again, it's their (the mother and the kid's) home. Meaning that they are now a family, regardless of what the kid and the tramp wants, because the biological mother wills it.\n\n\nWhat is your opinion on this? Did I misinterpret something? Is it intentional? I'd love to hear your thoughts because this was unfortunately a somewhat frustrating experience for me. \n\nPS. I should add that I watched the 52 minute cut, so perhaps that was missing some important pieces to understand the mother and gain sympathy for her. I doubt it would change my mind on this though.",

        "text": "Science-fiction, as a genre, has always been an effective tool in criticizing the real world from the safe distance of a fictional society. It is also effective in discussing the prevalent societal anxieties, especially those relating to the ‚Äòother'. According to Isabel Mountz, ‚Äòother means to distinguish, label, categorize, name, identify, place and exclude those who do not fit a societal norm', while ‚Äò‚ÄòOthering' is the process that makes the other' (328). The concept of the ‚Äòother' gained traction with the growth of post-colonial theory. In the simplest terms, the ‚Äòother' is anything different from the ‚Äòself'. In post-colonial theory, this ‚Äòself' came to mean the dominant, occidental discourse while the ‚Äòother' was usually the ‚ÄòOrient' or the colonized subject. This article seeks to explore how the idea of the ‚Äòother' is explored in Spielberg's movies, starting from his earliest venture, Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) to War of the Worlds (2005).\n[Read the full article with references](https://www.desicinephiles.com/editors-pick/the-others-in-steven-spielberg-s-science-fiction-movies)",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/88hk0i/spirited_aways_awkward_third_act/",
        "text": "Disclaimer: Spirited Away is a masterpiece: a beautiful marriage of ideas, visual invention and Joe Hisaishi's wonderfully warm symphonic score. But after a rewatch last night I felt the third act - or more specifically the part of the plot involving Haku taking Zeniba's gold seal - to be a very awkward way to wrap the story up. \n\nThe first two acts are engrossing. We journey with Chihiro into the spirit world and learn with her the ways of the bathhouse. We are introduced to each new character carefully and we also experience some of the main themes of the narrative: doubles, friendship, propriety, greed, etc.\n\nThe awkwardness of the narrative starts with the scene where Haku is being attacked by a squadron of paper figures sent by Zeniba because he stole her gold seal. This sequence, and the whole sequence involving Chihiro venturing to Zeniba's house and then the flying scene, are where the film's plot starts to become a bit clunky. The No Face sequence, which we cross-cut to around the time of Haku's injury, is excellent and absolutely not the target of my criticism here.\n\nI guess the problem with the parts of the story I have highlighted is that the viewer is forced to learn far too much expository information in such a short span of time before the payoff. The first two acts of the film did such a great job of showing us, with Chihiro, what the spirit world is like. We are *shown*, rather than told, the idea that employees of the bathhouse must make themselves into 'doubles': Haku and Lynn must present one face to some people, and one face to others. We are shown the greed and occasional compassion of the bathhouse staff and through No Face's scenes the idea of the value of friendship in a commerce-oriented society. The narrative at these points is very simple: we know who the protagonist is, we know what her goal is, we know the obstacles that lie in her path. The film very skilfully makes clear who Chihiro can trust and who she can't, and like being lowered into a warm bath, we gradually come to understand both our hero and the world around her.\n\nBut in the third act this elegance is replaced with exposition. Suddenly loads of important plot info is dumped on us in the form of dialogue rather than what we can see on-screen. A new character Zeniba is introduced and we are told Haku has stolen a gold seal from her. We are told the seal is important and powerful magic. We are told Haku is a thief and why he works for Yubaba. We go to with Chihiro to Zeniba's house and then we are told about the fact Haku was under some sort of spell by Yubaba which Chihiro defeated by squishing it in slug form. Zeniba seems to forgive Haku about the gold seal for some reason, despite being close to killing him for it earlier, and the viewer is left a bit confused as to what the point of this seal is, other than an obvious macguffin. Then we get the flying scene, and in a very unsatisfying denoument, Chihiro remembers that Haku's true name is 'Kohaku river' because - as she awkwardly explains in a splurge of exposition while flying and then while falling: she fell into the river as a kid and the spirit of that river saved her.\n\n'Show, don't tell' is the principle that underlies most good filmaking, so why are we told all this info rather than shown it? I would care about it far more if I were shown it. They did use a very brief flashback, but why not have a more full flashback scene at the very start of the film, before the car journey, of Chihiro in the Kohaku river? It would make the revelation of Haku more meaningful and less abrupt. Similarly, why not show us that Haku stole the seal, instead of telling us? Even if we don't see him steal it, perhaps there could have been a scene of him showing it to Chihiro and explaining briefly why he needed it (by the way: why *did* he need it?).  \n\nIt's a shame that this narrative clumsiness exists, because there are some real moments of beauty here, largely thanks to Mr Hisaishi: the gorgeous train scene, the heart-swelling music of the flying scene, the brilliant and adorable animation of the paper squadron and mouse-bird team. Plus I love the fairytale themes of trials, transformations and rules. But Spirited Away's third act needs to be more like the first two: we should be *shown* the magic and not told about it.\n\nAm I missing something?",

        "text": "It strikes me as odd sometimes that movies are made so as to be best shown in the movie theater, even though nowadays most movies are only in the theater for a month or so, a bit more with the big releases of course. Fast forward a couple of years after a movies release and most people will have seen the movie at home or will see it again at least once at home. There are a couple of things that are done to make the movie more suited to the big screen, one of those is the aspect ratio. Most big movies now are made in a much wider aspect ratio than the average TV set, and so the home viewing experience goes from the inteded big, wide and cinematic to cramped and unspectacular because suddenly the movie fills only about 2/3 of the screen. With an big bombastic movie you want the biggest picture possible right? so you want the movie to fill all available space. So the home viewing experience suffers.\n\nBut why do this if your biggest audience is going to see it at home anyway. probably because once it's released on home video people the reputation of the movie isn't based on first experiences anymore but rather on how good the movie actually was. And they want to have it release with a bang and make as much money as possible from those first ticket sales.\n\nSo is the choice of aspect ratio and for example 3D primarily a business decision with the big movies? Or is it always a creative decision? What are the creative benefits of a wider aspect ratio? Are some films just more suited to a wider aspect ratio, or could any story be told with any aspect ratio and it's just a matter of adapting the cinematography accordingly.\n\nI think any story could be told in any aspect ratio, that is if it was the first thing you ever saw as a movie watcher. I don't think there is anything inherently different with all the different aspect ratios when it comes to storytelling. But things don't exist in a void. We viewers have 100 years of associations. And we associate a wide panoramic image with big epics, and we associate a squareish aspect ratio with old tv and the golden age of Hollywood. And we associate the in between with dramas and more moderate storytelling. Even when we watch the movies on our home TV sets.\n\nSo while it technically is an inferior viewing experience at home when the movie is shot in a really widescreen format. We still associate it with going to the cinema and with big epic stories. And while a film shot in academy ratio doesn't look perfect on any modern screen, as most modern movie theaters have really wide screens and TVs would make it pillarboxed, it could still be a viable aspect ratio today if you want to convey a maybe a glamorous old-timey feel or are making a throwback to some dead genre. But ultimately these assciations came from studio business decisions. And I think some movies should have more thought pout into them for the later home release.\n\nI don't really know what I'm trying to say with this, I just wanted to organize my thoughts a bit and hear what others have to say about this. Do you think to much focus is put on the theatrical experience for some movies? And why do you think some films chose to shoot in a particular aspect ratio. Clearly you can make a big epic story in even 4:3, since I'm watching Seven Samurai right now and that movie does it really well. But then again I'm not really the general audience and I'm slower to judge a movie for things like that.",

While the book's use of 80's references feels a bit like constant praise of said references through description, the visual element actually makes the audience go on a journey of pop culture egg hunting EXACTLY like Wade, our protagonist does. \n\n\nIt works so much better in the movie that it actually continually validates and supports the film, making the very ever of watching it a relatable experience to our hero. Whenever we as an audience see a reference that we recognize, our identification with it and resulting dopamine spike is likely exactly like Wade's whenever he nears a clue that unveils the next step in the puzzle. Not unlike a murder mystery where all clues are on screen, the references in RP1 are more filler and lore focused, yet they take us on a very personal journey. \n\n\nNot a huge revelation or anything, but I think the concept and execution present something I haven't seen before as a reflection of pop culture that may be integrated in our society. While our references in modern life maybe net us points at the nearby bar trivia, in RP1 it could be the difference between life and (virtual) death. \n\n\nAny other films create an odd relatable experience in unexpected ways?",

        "text": "[Video Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xA1f3KpIT4)\n\nToday, I‚Äôm reviewing director Lynne Ramsay‚Äôs latest, You Were Never Really Here starring Joaquin Phoenix.\n\nThe film follows Joe, a clearly unhinged army veteran who acts as a useful tool for shady entities that require his brutally violent skillset. When tasked with the job of saving a underage girl from sex slavery, he unwittingly finds himself caught up in a twisted web of corruption.\n\nFollowing on from the breathtakingly powerful We Need to Talk About Kevin, Ramsay‚Äôs new film operates in a similar vein evoking incredibly dark subject matter through the use of pitch perfect visual storytelling. Joaquin Phoenix is a riveting, unpredictable screen presence as Joe, a performance that further proves what he‚Äôs shown himself capable of with the likes of Inherent Vice, The Master and Her, becoming a chameleonic force to be reckoned with. \n\nRamsay directs her film with claustrophobic long lens close ups, rarely allowing you the breathing room of a wide establishers. From the outset, this has the effect of throwing you into the suffocating world of the film‚Äôs protagonist. Joe is shown as a man operating very much in the shadows, his overgrown beard and shabby clothing further allowing him to blend in with his surroundings. Frequent smash cuts put us inside Joe‚Äôs fractured mind, his past traumas evocatively conveyed with visual intensity. On top of this, the film‚Äôs sound design overwhelmingly heightens such an atmosphere in its emphasis on the sheer noise of the bustling cityscape, his only reprieve oxygen deprivation a means of control over these forces.  Joe is surrounded at all times; completely invisible by choice, utterly detached by nature. \n\nJoe‚Äôs crippling PTSD makes him a quiet, animalistic presence. Much in the same vein as Scorsese‚Äôs cult classic, Taxi Driver and its iconic central performance by Robert DeNiro, Phoenix and Ramsay have conjured up the danger and toxic corruption at the heart of the modern city. Other similarities are mostly surface level with the relationship between Joe and Nina comparable to the protective connection between Travis and Iris, the exploitation of young girls being the catalyst which pushes each character into preventative action. \n\nRamsay‚Äôs calculated depiction of on-screen violence is stunningly effective in its cold and  detached nature. Much like Austrian Auteur, Michael Haneke, Ramsay purposely disallows the audience from seeing explicit violence up close and personal despite the plethora of examples within the film‚Äôs narrative. Instead, she chooses to keep her distance, be it through static grimy CCTV camera footage, jump cutting to the aftermath of an encounter or cutting away to the character‚Äôs reaction to these events. This has the effect of focusing primarily on the physical and emotional ramifications of this violence, the toll it takes on Joe as well as refusing to glamorise it at the same time. Nevertheless, in a true testament to the potency of Ramsay‚Äôs directorial skills, you‚Äôll be hard pressed to find a more hard hitting and shocking film this year. \n\nIt is Ramsay‚Äôs choice to focus on the effects of violence that allows Joaquin Phoenix to truly shine. What the actor achieves in his portrayal of the damaged protagonist is his ability to make a menacing and brutally violent individual utterly empathetic. The relationship between Joe and his mother is the emotional crux of the film, an effective juxtaposition to the intense violence of Joe‚Äôs reality. It works as a reprieve for the audience in these grim surroundings just as it‚Äôs the only thing keeping Joe tied to his otherwise painful existence. Just as the flashbacks attest, Joe is a scared child in a much tougher exterior, struggling with life and the horrors of his past. These horrors are utterly derived from an inability to protect those around him, the driving force of this brutal avenger. Having always been surrounded by the worst examples of humanity, he has become a reflection of its ugliest aspects whilst being determined to fight against them so the same doesn‚Äôt happen to other innocent victims.  It is this moral compass that allows us to see Joe‚Äôs monstrosity as a force for good, one of the most uniquely affecting moments being when he acts as an empathetic companion to a dying antagonist. Through this, humanity is brought out in the bleakest and most unlikely of circumstances.\n\n\nThe supporting cast is very effective: Ektarina Samsonov, who plays Nina, brilliantly encapsulates the role of an emotionally vacant, traumatised teenager with an unpredictable energy about her. Elsewhere, Judith Roberts who plays Joe‚Äôs mother is an effective counterbalance to Joaquin Phoenix‚Äôs intensity, bringing Joe down to earth and evoking authentic maternal love for her troubled son whilst convincingly struggling with the onset of dementia. \n\nOn the technical side of things, the sound designer, Paul Davies deserves massive praise for the hellish and oppressive soundscape he conjures, likewise the masterful editing by Joe Bini is hugely successful in creating the propulsive rhythm and in quieter moments, emotionally resonant ones too. Jonny Greenwood has created another incredible score off the back of his work on PTA‚Äôs Phantom Thread, it‚Äôs bass filled percussive energy is a huge part of what makes the film so terrifyingly intense, filling the nightmarish events on screen with a sense of danger and unease.  \n\nThe film is thrilling, nerve shredding, heartbreaking and stunningly powerful. Though many may see the plot as simple, the story personified by Joe‚Äôs character arc and the socially relevant themes on display are the real driving forces of the film. It‚Äôs an incredible cinematic experience of the kind of  visual and sonic rawness that is all too rare these days.\n\nI‚Äôm going to give You Were Never Really Here 5 stars out of 5.\n\n\n[Video Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xA1f3KpIT4)",

        "text": "As some of you may know Scorsese has a new mafia movie coming out starring Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Joe Pesci and Harvey Kietel concerning the mob connections surrounding the disappearance of union leader Jimmy Hoffa. \n\nIt has been in development for around 10 years and just before filming began it was announced that CGI would be used on the main cast to make the actors look younger (most of the characters were around the ages of 40-50 when the main bulk of the story takes place). The film originally was budgeted at $100m (which is incredibly high as it is) but has since ballooned to around $140-170m and they haven't even got to the music licencing.\n\nIt got me thinking. If you would need to use expensive state-of-the-art CGI (which has no guarantee of looking convincing) wouldn't it have been a better idea to have made the film earlier, and not wait until 2019? Especially since the actors are old enough to begin with? Could Silence have not waited a few years? Or Shutter Island? Or The Wolf of Wall Street? \n\nI made this short video discussing the release of the film and whether they have left it too late or not:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akjZ3h6rYwQ\n\nIf you prefer to read, I wrote it up:\n\nWhen some people are made aware of Martin Scorsese‚Äôs latest film The Irishman and its development, a common reaction is exasperation due to the decision to reverse the age of senior citizen actors in order to make them play characters who will be up to around 30 years younger than their actual ages. Realistically actors like Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci are far too old to be playing the characters they are playing, which is why Industrial Light and Magic have been bought in during post-production of the movie to de-age the actors for scenes set in the past. Of course they could have picked different for the roles but that would mean losing the charm of seeing all these veteran legends in the same picture playing off each other, which is why they are instead opting for CGI.  So it does bring up another question ‚Äì why didn‚Äôt they just make this movie years earlier, when the actors were in their prime or at least a little closer to the actual ages of the characters they‚Äôll be playing? Ideally you‚Äôd have the movie filmed in the late 90‚Äôs, when it would be easy to make De Niro, Pacino and Pesci look both younger and older with makeup and which would also add a poetic element to the film‚Äôs release date given that this was when the gangster genre pretty much died out. It‚Äôs a legitimate question.\n\nIt is a legitimate question but that doesn‚Äôt stop it being a bit of a na√Øve question. First of all, the book the movie is based on I Heard You Paint Houses was published in 2003, so of course that rules out the film being made any earlier than that. So why wasn‚Äôt it made immediately after then? Well, for this we can only speculate. Who knows what went on behind the scenes? Maybe the project sat on the shelf for 10 years or maybe Scorsese was fighting tooth and nail to get it made for a decade. All I know is that in 2013 when Scorsese had the opportunity to make The Irishman or Silence he chose to make the latter because it was a personal passion project. This is the only time I know of that the movie was intentionally held back which sound crazy when you consider that Silence could be made anytime but the swiftness of The Irishman‚Äôs filming was crucial because of the age of the actors. They were moving farther and farther away from being the appropriate age for their roles and let‚Äôs be honest, they were getting closer and closer to their deaths. One actor who I‚Äôm sure would have been in the film Frank Vincent actually died close to the start of The Irishman‚Äôs filming start date. Maybe we would have seen Billy Batts and Tommy DeVito together again had Scorsese chosen The Irishman over Silence? Who knows? \n\nRobert De Niro mentioned the project in interviews several times over the past decade or so, explaining that the film is being planned very carefully. Seemingly then a conscious decision was made to not rush the film into production. After all it would take time to perfect a script based on such an expansive novel and to find a shooting schedule to fit in so many different actors. Of course we know now that there was great difficulty also in funding the project, with Scorsese eventually having to turn to the streaming service Netflix to bring it to life. The reason for the Hollywood studios reluctance was due to the huge budget needed to de-age the actors in post-production. \n\nLooking at it from this angle and providing the digital effects look good when the film comes out, it‚Äôs probably a blessing then that the movie wasn‚Äôt made until now, seeing as though if there‚Äôs ever a time to get special effects like this done right‚Ä¶it‚Äôs now. Even the revolutionary de-aging effects in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button look quite outdated now. The technology has come a long way since. Think of what a $50m studio-produced Irishman‚Äôs de-aging CGI would have looked like in 2005 vs a $170m budgeted mob flick in 2019 will look like. \nI think it‚Äôs safe to say then we don‚Äôt yet know if it was a wise decision to delay the making of this film by a few years. If you as the film makers knew you were casting 60 year olds in the roles of 40 year olds back in 2007ish, surely you‚Äôd try and get the film made as quickly as possible? Or maybe because you knew the age gap was already too apparent, you were looking for other ways to make the film work, finally settling for CGI which, at the time, wasn‚Äôt yet ready.\n\nIf the digital effects look good, we‚Äôll all be able to say it was a great decision not to produce the film until 2018, because they were able to use state of the art CGI technology and utilizes the fact that Netflix has given Scorsese an incredible amount of money to play with, and I can‚Äôt think of any film studio that would be willing to spend almost $200m on a mafia film. The film will look great, the legendary actors will all share a lot of screen time, and it will most likely be a critical success. \n\nIf the digital effects are bad however, it will have a huge impact on the film and it will give cynics the opportunity to again ask the question ‚Äúwhy didn‚Äôt you make the film earlier?‚Äù But as suggested by this video perhaps the tools were not available to Scorsese and co. back then to make the film, and a project as ambitious as The Irishman could only have been artistically and financially produced today. \n\nI remember when the film was first talked about years ago, sometime before the release of Shutter Island if I remember correctly. And back then I wanted the film to be released right now at this very second. But who‚Äôs to say if they chose to make it back then the film would have gotten laughed at for having 60 year olds in heavy make up trying to look like 30 year olds. Or if they went for digital deaging, who‚Äôs to say the effects wouldn‚Äôt look horribly outdated today, which they definitely would have. \n\nMaybe then the movie being promised and then disappearing, promised and then disappearing, until finally here we are 10 years later with the film having wrapped filming, might have actually turned out to be a good thing, because it means today CGI is as good as it‚Äôs ever been AND that a new powerhouse, Netflix, has the cash needed to fund such a project.\n\nIt all really depends on if the special effects being used to reverse the actors‚Äô ages, such a controversial decision within the film communities, will be up to scratch. And for that, we‚Äôll have to see when the movie is released in late 2019.",

        "text": "One of the more iconic and emotionally revealing film tropes is the \"ride into the sunset\" ending - whether literal (as in Westerns), or in more abstract dramatic terms.  Characters are shown leaving behind the struggles and conflicts shown in the story, literally or proverbially chasing the Sun toward a new day and an unknown future.\n\nWhile these have traditionally had elegiac overtones - particularly in endings of Western films where the protagonist is mortally-wounded and his ride is essentially a metaphor for death - the broader phenomenon has been far more optimistic, and sometimes classed among classic \"happy endings\" in film.\n\nThe question that intrigues me, and I would like to hear your thoughts on, is how much this is a reflection of American culture - and to what extent other cultural perspectives on these sorts of endings differ.  However sad, tragic, or emotionally draining the events of a film are, a (not mortally wounded) character's ride into the sunset - whether on a horse, a bus, or an airline - is perceived by American audiences as an open-ended and generous conclusion with optimistic implications.\n\nOur protagonist is \"putting the past behind him,\" and escaping whatever personal anguish, trap, or catastrophe had ensnarned him in the plot of the film.  Even when the problems were self-inflicted, the act of escape at the end is ritually hopeful.\n\nHowever, in discussions with film-lovers from Asia, their interpretation of such scenes has sometimes been the exact opposite, in ways that I've never encountered from other Americans: That it's not just bittersweet, but outright tragic and heart-rending because the protagonist is choosing or forced to abandon social and cultural connections.  Views like this don't see \"riding into the sunset\" as escape or new beginning, but as being hounded out into the cold.\n\nThis is not a unanimous view, of course, but it illustrates that aspects of film can have very different emotional contexts when perceived from different cultural backgrounds.\n\nAre you aware of similar cultural contrasts with respect to this type of scene, or indeed any emotionally-fraught film trope?",

        "text": "This isn't exactly an analysis, more an observation. It might sound like a fairly obvious statement, \"of course a crazy man looks like a crazy man, what else would he look like\", but I think it's *so* prominent that it deserves a mention. If it's too simple I'll throw in an \"how Oldboy conflates the typical revenge character arc and masculinity to then subvert it\" to please you intellegentsia lot.\n\nWhen the film start, the first very ambigious threatening scene pictures [Oh Dae-Su](https://imgur.com/a/mLlj1) as some very threatening figure, with his face all hidden and filmed from below etc. It sets up the \"scary revenge man\" angle (which it'll later subvert). But in this scene, Dae-Su is very much the \"threatening revenge man\" and look the part.\n\nThe next [scene](https://imgur.com/a/N5rEq), which is chronologically the first, we get our only view into Dae-Su before everything, and he looks like schlub. While he is portrayed as a \"normal man\", it's very much the comical emasculated normal man, the Homer Simpson. The \"normalcy\" here isn't portrayed as something to aspire to, which again is a view not too uncommon in revenge stories. The everyday man regains his masculinity in violent revenge. Anyway, let's continue.\n\nWhile [Dae-Su](https://imgur.com/a/iqs5M) is locked away, he starts to become insane. Odd rambling monologues (which continue for about half the film), hallucinations and all around strange behahaviour. And as his manners deteriorate, so does his appearance, and he starts looking about 30 years older. Meanwhile his wife and murdered and he's framed for it (again, typical revenge movie premise), and I guess you could say along with his wife (and child) stolen away from him, so's his masculinity. Rather than becoming a man in his prime, he's already become a crazy old fool. Then he of course gets rescued, and it's up to him to slowly regain himself, his pride and idolised badassery. So he starts to look more and more [cool](https://imgur.com/a/ggX8K). This is fairly early still, but his haircut is much better, as is his facial hair. Glasses still look a bit wacko and his clothes (not seen in the image) don't fit amazingly well.\n\nThrough-out the film Dae-Su noticeably (without the film making a deal out of it) improved his mental stability, appearance and other masculine traits. He gets a hot younger girl to help him solely through his charisma (at least we believe that so far) and has become some kind of superman fighter. His final appearance before and during the penthouse scene - and subseuently his downfall - is [this](https://imgur.com/a/UaKXy). \n\nCool dude, ain't he now? Nice hair and facial hair. Cool relaxed, somewhat sad (but in control of his sadness) facial and body language. Very nice clothes. I think it was Channel Criswell which explained Oldboy as a Greek Tragedy, and this is the final scene when the main character is at his highest point. This is peak Oh Dae-Su, this is peak man, and he's about to get his revenge! Then we who've seen the film of course all know what [happened](https://imgur.com/a/phoTp), and he doesn't look at all good anymore.\n\nFinal scene, with a broken Oh Dae-Su, and he looks fairly reminiscent of [earlier](https://imgur.com/a/MO06w), broken mind, broken body, lousy hair. Despite him still \"getting the girl\" (like a proper man does), it's all a cruel joke. There's no pride or anything worthwhile in that, nothing to admire, just a broken man stuck in hell.\n\nWhile I've mostly categorized Dae-Su's uprising and downfall so far, the film uses character appearance all through-out. When showing how devastated Dae-Su is by the death of his wife, we get no physical reaction from him, no lashing out, screaming or thrashing, only a [look](https://imgur.com/a/fZ2wP).\n\nIn the bizarre giant ant [scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lk4tQLPIgV0) (which in my mind serves as an explanation for why Dae-Su stays with Mi-Do, the woman crying seeing giant ants on the subway shows who she would be if he'd leave) we see a direct contrast with the editing. Lonely-looking devastated Mi-Do cut into tired but still healthy looking Mi-Do. We're not directly told the first woman is lonely, however Mi-Do *is* talking about lonely people seeing ants right in the scene previous. So despite most people being able to figure out the woman looking at the at the probably is lonely even if she looked normal, it'd go against the films language and how important appearance is to showcase the characters mental state. In this film, if she didn't *look* devastated, she wouldn't be.\n\nEven when characters hide who they are, their appearance follows suit. Before the true machinations of the villain Woo-Jin is revealed, he's dressed very [inconspiciously](https://imgur.com/a/o9Apt), a non-threat. Then as he begins to reveal his plan, he takes a shower and puts on a very nice and manly suit, when he becomes threatening and powerful, his appearance becomes more proper. \n\nThen when we see Woo-jins fall, it follows the same pattern. Despite the film just as easily could have him with a blank face like in the [promos](https://imgur.com/a/foEPq), it won't do. Despite getting his revenge, Woo-Jin is still devastated and unhappy with a broken soul, now what should that look like? Oh yeah, like [that](https://imgur.com/a/WLUvC). Despite being a very manly mans man with a great suit and a fit naked body (and nice ass as well, if you'll permit me saying that), he's been reduced into a mewling mess, openly weeping. The masculinity-from-revenge which was promised to him was a lie. He never got his closure either, and it broke him as well.\n\nYou might argue that character appearance reflecting character is present in every movie, but honestly this is so ever present in Oldboy. I haven't even mentioned the gangster character loses his threatening nature after losing his hand, or that Dae-Su's schlub friend from the beginning turned into an ultra-schlub looking over an internet caf√©. And we can only guess his ultra-schlub status from his appearance, it's never directly told to us.\n\nIf you don't wanna read all this, you can just look at the pictures, I think they tell a story by themselves quite well.",

        "text": "This notion that movies are getting worse has been parroted so frequently that I think it's become considered to be a fact. But are movies really getting worse? Were the studios more concerned with quality than profits in the past?\n\nI contest that people who insist that movies are getting worse are viewing the past through a selective prism, and that they only recall the movies that rose to the top that are great.  Every year has good movies and every year has bad movies. It's the same as it has ever been. Our biases and fallible memories tend to think that the past was better than it actually was, and there really is no trend of movies getting worse. Typically we only remember about 1% of the movies that are made in any given year.\n\nEven in 1939, in what is considered to be greatest year for movies ever, there were 761 movies made by the studios. Hollywood has always been a business and movies were always the product first and foremost, not works of art. They were only ever art by accident. The vast majority of which have never been released on VHS, DVD or Bluray, are not in rotation on TCM, and are pretty much forgotten. The only movies that persist are the great ones. All of the mediocre ones are just forgotten, which in turn skews it seem like the ratio between good and bad was higher in the past.\n\nThis also goes against the notion that there are more movies being created today than ever before. Last year, there were 729 movies released. Back in the days of the studio system, the major studios were releasing on average a movie a week via an assembly line process. Every once in awhile a Gone With the Wind popped out. But more often than not, it was an Andy Hardy Gets Spring Fever.\n\nNever heard of it? Me either. And it, along with 99% of the other 761 movies released that year aren't available and haven't been seen since 1939. Take another stellar year for movies for example. Say a year like 1975.\n\n**Best movies of 1975**\n\n* Jaws\n* One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\n* Dog Day Afternoon\n* Barry Lyndon\n* Nashville\n\nPretty great movies, right? Well the majority of people would believe so. These 5 frequently land on AFI, Sight and Sound and Ebert's Greatest Movies lists. \n\nBut that year also had middle of the road audience pleasers that people generally don‚Äôt think of when they mention 1975: These are some of the biggest box office movies of the year:\n\n* The Apple Dumpling Gang\n* Escape to Witch Mountain\n* The Return of the Pink Panther\n* Grizzly Adams\n* Rollerball\n* The Other Side of the Mountain\n* Funny Lady\n* French Connection II \n* The Adventures of the Wilderness Family\n* Lucky Lady\n\nAnd those aren't necessarily bad, just standard middle of the road fare that we dont even consider when we talk about high points of the 70s. No one is going to include clips from Grizzly Adams when talking about cinema of the 1970s, but it was the 6th highest box office draw of the year.\n\nAnd then when you look at a list of the 1,079 films released that year, the VAST majority are completely forgotten. Only about 1% of the movies released that year would we even consider to be a ‚ÄúGreat Movie.‚Äù But that 1% is all we refer to when we discuss movies of 1975.\n\nSo basically, it's the same as it's always been. Every year will average about 5-7 great movies that we will continue to watch and talk about in 20 years.",

        "text": "One of the biggest turnoffs for Fellini (outside of the Felliniesque weirdness of his later films) is that he dubbed all of his films. Of course, this was common with Italian films of the period, but nevertheless, it can still turn some people off. However, the way Fellini uses this to his advantage is, IMO, brilliant.\n\nFollowing a technique dear to Fellini, many lines of dialogue in his films were written only during post-production, while the actors on the set mouthed random lines. When I first read about this, it immediately reminded me of Antonin Artaud's theories. Now, I'm not claiming that Fellini was familiar with Artaud's theories, but hear me out for a moment. Artaud proposed the Theater of Cruelty, which was a return to magic and ritual. He sought to create a new theatrical language of totem and gesture ‚Äì a language of space devoid of dialogue that would appeal to all the senses. In the pursuit of that, Artaud proposed that words should be chosen not for their meaning, but for what emotion their phonic sound evokes. This is really interesting, and I partially agree with it. First off, it really gives the actor the ability to act with extraordinary passion and give us incredibly emotional performances. But on the other hand, without words, there is no coherence, and part of the beauty of a play or a film is the written word, which, if done well, gives the story incredible depth and poetry. So at least for me, Artaud's theory makes for brilliant performances, but also allows for incoherence and a lack of depth/poetry.\n\nThat is where Fellini's magic begins. He allows his actors to ramble off random lines on set (often gibberish), and later writes and dubs the dialogue during post-production. This brilliantly allows for the incredibly emotional performances while also giving his films poetry and depth. Fellini, from *La Strada* down through the best of his later works, took advantage of the dubbing, and that is where his brilliance begins, IMO.",

        "text": "[The World of Kanako](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He0oQJC9pzQ) is an exceedingly stylish thriller from an exceedingly stylish director (Tetsuya Nakashima) who's very much an enigma when it comes to energetic contemporary Asian genre thrillers. Despite being superficially similar in rapid editing, often adolescent cast and horrible (sometimes sexual) violence and revenge to directors like Kim Jee-Won, Sion Sono, Takeshi Miike, Lee Sang-Il, Na Hong-Jin (and sometimes a mislabeled Park Chan-Wook) there are certain fundamental differences in approach to filmmaking and storytelling which I think World of Kanako showcases very well.\n\nThe first (and least relevant to what I'll be talking to) difference is editing. World of Kanako might be the finest edited film I've ever seen. Editing is often described like \"it's good if you don't notice it\" which is only half-true. It's *fine* if you don't notice it, *World of Kanako* has the most effortless flashbacks, montages and use of slow-mo I've ever seen. While his previous film, *Confessions* has a similar editing style which takes over the whole film and turns into into a sort of Nightmare-meets-Radiohead-Music-video, World of Kanako's editing is there mainly to complement fairly typical (in structure) storytelling. However there's no way the film could be both as complex, nuanced and still incredibly stylish without the ever present editing which weaves through present and past and animated dream representations through insane montages without missing a beat. \n\nWhat I wanted to really talk about was really some choices in the storytelling. As you might figure from the trailer, the film is very typical in its initial premise. A laid-off divorced anti-hero detective looks after his daughter who's missing, it even has the typical dark Asian twist of \"She's been involved in more serious stuff than the parents thought\", and the search for the truth is mainly to answer two questions;\n\n\"Where is Kanako?\" and \"Why did she do what she's been doing?\".\n\nWe all know how a normal genre thriller would answer these questions, and the film comes very close to do the same. We've got a monologue by Kanako explaining herself, and the main character gets a hold of the the character responsible for her dissappearance. However at the last minute the film dodges from giving outright answer and instead just gives us hints. Kanako is awfully vague and we can only get some hint of trauma and her \"living in a dream where there are no rules\" and as far and where we is...We, and the main character, both cruelly only knows *vaguely* where she is, and that's all we'll ever know.\n\nThe effects of this, is that the story rather than becoming about the dissappearance, about a *what happened* it instead goes for the more interesting route, *why did it happen* and leaves the interpretation mostly up to us. We're left with an incomplete puzzle despite the whole story being revealed to us. Despite us knowing all information which would be relevant to a police officer in a crime case, a few seemingly irrelevant pieces of information is left in the dark and we can only imagine what the answers are, and in the process imagine why the questions are as important to the characters as they are.\n\nBy withholding two rather small pieces of information, the film ultimately transforms into an intriguing arthouse character study of Akikazu and Kanako and their father/daughter relationship, and thus becomes far more interesting than any typical genre thriller could ever hope to be.",

        "text": "Three Billboards was probably my favourite film of 2017, and for the most part I was impressed by how reasonably it dealt with a morally ambiguous plot with characters stuck in such impossible positions. Its narrative was mature in structure and content, and it never stooped to dumbing anything down or over-explaining, which by contrast made some dialogue quips feel a little stilted. \n\nThroughout the film, the first half especially, there seemed to be a lot of unnecessary, tacked on dialogue that served no purpose other than paying lip-service to contemporary social issues, or simply to name drop contentious political hot topics. By its nature the film was fairly progressive and this didn't need spelling out, yet it really felt like after the script was finished McDonagh had Googled 'political buzzwords 2017' then dropped one in every few pages. \n\nThere were a lot of witticisms about stuff like gay rights, women's rights, social media, police abuse of power, and even an unnecessary pro-weed throwaway line (I wish I posted this closer to seeing the film so I could give some more specific examples). Now I'm not at all suggesting these are 'SJW' topics that shouldn't be discussed, in fact now more than ever than ever I think the media should be taking a defiant line against outdated conservative social norms - it's just I don't Three Billboards handled these topics properly, nor had much reason to include them in the first place. To me they felt like they'd been included as a afterthought in a very ham-fisted way that bordered almost on /r/fellowkids material. \n\nThese lines seemed to come up very inorganically and often with an over-emphasised delivery that seemed inches away from the character literally winking into the camera. Such lines really seemed to break the 'show don't tell rule' - by having a film centered on a strong female lead and writing her a complex and fully realised character its evident the creator supports female empowerment, and yet McDonagh's insistence on  overtly reinforcing this in the dialogue made him a feel a little insecure about what he's saying.\n\nThe most emblematic example I can think of (although it wasn't exactly a throwaway line) was the scene where the priest visits. Frances McDormand's character goes on a lengthy tirade, specifically detailing the rampant problems in the Catholic church, and really doesn't mince her words. Everything she says is quite right, but within the context of the scene seems a bit unnecessary and pandering to the militant atheist crowd. She's ranting and raving at some small town preacher (who is barely introduced as a character) who seems like a decent guy and is a million worlds away from child sex abuse at the Vatican. I get that this was partly to show how unhinged she was as a character and so blind to everyone trying to help her, but it felt an awful lot like McDonagh patting himself on the back for taking a lousy cheap-shot at the church - and quite a few people in theatre I was at cheered after this outburst. \n\nThis is all obviously a relatively-minor nitpick in an otherwise decent movie, and if you haven't seen it yet I'd definitely recommend it. It has its principles in the right place and I definitely don't disagree with McDonagh's philosophy, I just think if he wants to address all these issues then he should make a movie about them, not add them as what felt like an afterthought to an already very politically charged movie. \n\nEdit: spag.",

        "text": "...in that The Lobster had one or two main themes and explored them deeply, whilst Killing was trying to do too much at the same time, I felt. \n\nHere are my thoughts on Yorgis' previous movie, which I legitimately think is one of the funniest films of the decade:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/7x9cc0/the_lobster_2015_is_one_of_the_funniest_films_ive/\n\nI though Killing was OK. Not amazing, definitely not a bad film. If you prefer an audio review click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRjF3Ww3F5g). If not, carry on reading and let me know what you thought of the film.\n\nMuch of the movie‚Äôs pull and charm lies in not really knowing what‚Äôs going on so I won‚Äôt give a plot outline because for this movie I‚Äôd personally consider that a spoiler. Just know that it revolves around a comfortably-living surgeon whose life begins to fall apart, and it seems to have something to do with a teenage boy recently he befriended. \n\n\nIMDb lists the main character as ‚Äòcharasmatic‚Äô and I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs supposed to be ironic or in an internet user taking the piss because similarly to The Lobster, the characters in the film act as if they‚Äôre all overdosed on anti-depressants and talk very bluntly and directly about subjects we would consider taboo. In The Lobster it was hilarious and made a lot of sense since it took place in an alternate society where the norms are a lot different from ours. But since Sacred Deer takes place in what I assume is our present day world I wasn‚Äôt too sure what purpose the oddball dialogue served. It was interesting and at times quite funny but unlike the film‚Äôs predecessor it did come off as aimless.\n\n\nI really dug the look of this film. Thimios Bakatakis‚Äòcamera, especially during the scenes set in the hospital where our protagonist played by Colin Farrell works, creeps around like a spectre with low-angle shots gliding around the building. The way we often follow characters from behind as they walk away or face them onwards as they move in the direction of the camera with the camera keeping a consistent distance, along with numerous slow zoom ins and zoom outs will instantly remind you of The Shining. Like Kubrick‚Äôs movie, an unsettling score chooses to drop in as it so pleases, making you shit your pants during some scenes and just feel mildly uncomfortable during others. The movie seemingly borrows heavily from The Shining in building its unnerving feel. It‚Äôs a film where everything on screen for an hour or so seems relatively normal, but you can‚Äôt shake the feeling that something is very off, that some of the characters know something that we don‚Äôt. \n\n\nIn terms of the story - it‚Äôs relatively simple once everything is unravelled and the film has an almost mystical captivating feel which relies on not knowing the details of the story. Essentially it‚Äôs a take on a tale from Greek mythology set in modern times. The players involved which includes Nicole Kidman as Farrell‚Äôs wife all give satisfactory performances. The stand out for me was Barry Keoghan as the odd kid that hangs around Farrell. His face alone is unnerving enough and he perfectly captured the essence of playing a weirdo teenager, the kind you suspect spends most of his time eating mud and playing with himself. \n\n\nThe Killing of a Sacred Deer was interesting. It was stimulating. It had my attention throughout. And when it was finished I did think it was a nicely packaged little film. But I did think the film was a little milder than it could have been. I apologies for bringing The Lobster up again since you should judge a movie on its own, but that film took a subject ‚Äì romantic relationships ‚Äì and ran with it, exploring it deeply and doing all sorts. Sacred Deer has a few different angles ‚Äì a quest for revenge, children paying for the sins of the father, guilt and karma, and a couple of other elements and several different subplots. The problem is the film briefly touches on each of these, poking a toe in but not diving headfirst in like The Lobster did. Because of this I can‚Äôt help but feel the film comes of a little bit bland for not flexing its muscles as much as it could have done. \n\n\nStill the film is a simple story told with enough creative juice from one of the most unique directors working today to be worthwhile. I‚Äôm not sorry I saw it, though I probably won‚Äôt see it again. 7/10. ",

        "author": "WhyAmIMrPink-",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/87mtvg/discussion_mute/",
        "text": "There wasn't a discussion on this subreddit about this film yet, so I'm curious about /r/truefilm's reactions. \n\n**Obligatory spoiler warning** \n\n\nI was surprised that I kinda liked Mute despite it being so widely panned. Although most aspects of the movie could've been done better, I don't think it was the awful mess it's been received as. I think there are things of value to be found. \n\nMute was a straight-forward 'detective' mystery about a man looking for his missing girlfriend. Movies in this genre tend to be a bit slow and \"boring\", and Mute did lack an intriguing mystery that developed further than just collecting clues about a missing girlfriend. There was basically one big development, which is the discovery that Cactus Bill's child is also the child of Leo's girlfriend. This was a development I liked, as it tied together the two characters the movie focused on (Leo and Cactus Bill). However, the movie could've used more interesting plot points that change the course of the mystery. \n\nI was also unable to detect a central theme above the plot, which ties in to a criticism I read that the movie doesn't make use of its setting to add a science fiction theme. It's one of those points that I get is a missed opportunity, but not something that breaks the film since it's a just a setting that the characters of this story simply live in and the viewer discovers while the characters move through it. I was fine with the fact that I got a glimpse into an interesting futuristic setting even if it didn't do anything more profound with that setting. I also feel that any disappointment about this is partly based on expectations, by which I mean the idea that since it looks and was clearly inspired by Blade Runner, it would have the same thematic weight to it. Then again, this movie does explicitly mentions Duncan Jones' Moon, which did do science fiction well and offered a more profound theme while telling a story with mystery elements.\n\nI liked the fact that it wasn't too clear that Cactus Bill was the antagonist of the movie. He seemed a somewhat relateable secondary protagonist, sometimes he seemed a good person, sometimes he seemed a bad person, but he didn't seem the killer and antagonist that he turned out to be until it made sense for the story. The tonal shifts were far from perfect, he forgave his pedophile friend Duck a bit easily after threatening him. This I was able to rationalize that because I understood that both characters were very friendly towards each other and clearly have a history, but this definitely could've been handled better. \n\nAlso, Cactus Bill's negative traits seemed to be like flipping a switch instead of being natural to the character. Late in the movie, Cactus Bill has everything he wants: he and his child are free to leave and him and Duck are on good terms. But then he steals some nuts and threatens a security guard out of nowhere. In his anger he even punches Duck, who then texts Leo the address of Cactus Bill. The end of the movie is only possible because Cactus Bill acts out when it doesn't make sense. I feel like this scene is supposed to show his bad side, but at that point in the movie we already know he's the bad guy. This action by Cactus Bill would make more sense earlier in the movie, when he's on edge for not yet having the forged documents he needs. Earlier in the movie, the audience could understand Cactus Bill's frustration and him acting out and at the same time this would be a good early sign that he is in fact the antagonist.\n\nTo quickly conclude my thoughts for now: I thought the core story was too straight-forward but fine, the setting lacked a thematic tie to the story but was nice to follow the story in. A lot of things could've been better, and while clearly inspired by much better sci-fi movies I don't think Mute was pretending to be as grand or deep as those. Mute is a bit boring and a bit hollow, but I didn't find it atrocious. ",

        "text": "Everyone knows that the MCU kicked off a trend of some of Hollywoods largest franchises deciding to have a shared universe of films. DC, Universal Monsters, Star Wars, Harry Potter, etc. For the most part, I'm super into it. I am a writer and actor and spend a lot of my free time playing D&amp;D as a creative outlet; all this is to say that I love building exciting fleshed out worlds and then seeing all the sorts of stories I can set within it. Its very exciting to get to revisit a world I love that can exist outside of a singular narrative arc.\n\nHowever, what I am not seeing in Hollywood is the exact opposite approach, which is a shame. Basically standalone solo films that may featurw the same character but have no relation to one another. This would be like if they made superhero movies out of famous graphic novels of varying styles. They could have The Killing Joke one year under Director and Actor A and go for a totally different style doing Death in the Family with Team B. No origin stories needed; we are now all collectively pretty familiar with these characters.\n\nOne franchise I would love to see adopt this method of storytelling would be Indiana Jones. Treat the character like James Bond but bring in new talent to each film. Abandoning any sense of continuity means you could set adventure in any time period, in any location, exploring any mythos. In one movie, Indy could be a woman in the 1800s and in another a hispanic man in the 1980s. By opening it up in this way, there are infinitely more stories to be told, and no need to ever do a reboot or another origin. Thoughts?",
