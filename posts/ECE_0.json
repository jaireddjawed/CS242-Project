        "text": " I'm a Computer Engineering student designing a wide-area, indoor surveillance system. The idea is a \"star\" or \"wheel\" network topology where each node in the network is made up of a camera, an MCU, and some communication link to a base-station CPU which will do image processing. The communication between the nodes and base should be duplex, and the nodes are sending a single image to the base station at &lt;= 1 image/second. The distance between a node and the base station will be between 1-100m but probably no more than 50m.\n\nI've never really done an IoT project before or had to work with comm standards on a low-level. Seems like the popular choices for mesh systems like this are Bluetooth, wifi, and ZigBee. Bluetooth is immediately out because it doesn't satisfy the range constraint. I'm still researching Zigbee, but it seems like the data rate may be too low for what we're trying to accomplish. Is WiFi a feasible choice for this kind of network?\n\nGenerally, I'm looking for any kind of advice regarding the physical communication link for a network like this. Thanks in advance for your help.",

        "text": "Hey, I'm writing this to ask for career advice. I'm a master's student who's deeply interested in SoC development. Ideally, I would want to work in top companies like Apple in the domain of design and verification.\n\nAt the moment, I'm doing an internship at a relatively big company(but not Apple) and working on SoC design based on high-level synthesis and abstract modeling. At first, I was very delighted to work on something I was very interested. But then, I'm still wondering if I'm on the right path to learning the necessary skills to become a seasoned digital design engineer.\n\nFor work, I'm mostly learning and practicing scripting languages, GNU make, Verilog and sometimes System Verilog. Apart from that, I'm also trying to learn design principles. But the thing is my department is somewhat more focused on experimental stuff that isn't yet available as actual products. So I'm not sure if this is good from the perspective of learning the industry standard methodology+tools as a student. And also the fact that I'm not using/practicing C++ while developing makes me feel like I'm missing out on an important skill as a hardware engineer. Although I'm not saying I'm not learning anything now(I'm definitely learning a lot), I just want to ask if I'm on the right path and learning the necessary skills to become a skilled SoC design engineer.",

        "text": "Having worked for around three years in a front end VLSI design role on a chip spanning subsystem, I am now wanting to move up the tech stack. I am guessing this is a rather common career goal, but I haven’t found any advice in general on moving in this direction. Ironically, I have actually seen far more advice on moving down the tech stack. I am assuming that experience doing system level design and an understanding of design limitations at a physical and functional level would be the primary skills to take from my previous role, but are there other things as should focus on honing before I start applying? \n\nI am guessing that a lot of work will actually revolve around writing C/++ models of systems and making changes to test efficiency, but I am also thinking that to actually be good at the role you need additional knowledge of literature and design techniques. Back in school I did a fair amount of arch work, and I think I could realistically understand most arch papers given a thorough reading. The most interesting paper I ever read was actually tomasulos algo, though it is rather hard for me to explain to others. \n\nI guess my main question here is whether it is feasible to transition directly into Arch after reaching the point of owning design blocks as an ASIC engineer, or whether I will legitimately need more schooling. For reference, my Senior project was implementing a reduced RISC-V processor, and I additionally did a quarter of lab work on my schools open source processor where I implemented a cycle stealing optimization in the data cache to allow 2 cycle reads down from 3.",

        "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nSo my path is a little weird so far, and I'm trying to follow the path of least resistance (in terms of education) to maybe get into Cyber, but honestly not sure. \n\nI graduated from university with my BSME, and worked as a Project Engineer in the general industry doing project management and IT stuff. Now, I am working as a Microelectronics Process Engineer. I do 2.5/3D packaging, PCB assembly, and learning quite a bit about digital design using Altium.\n\nI can go to grad school on my employer's dime, but I don't know if I want to do it. I am targeting electrical engineering with a focus on solid-state devices.\n\nI liked the IT stuff at my old job. I did pilots for IT platforms, wrote processes, and also maintained a local database, building modules here and there (VBA/SQL). These projects were successful, and although stressful at times, I liked them.\n\nNow, I'm more of a hardware engineer, but my main tasks aren't to design-- I'm mostly doing packaging and assembly, which I'm not too excited about. I just discovered industrial control systems that perhaps combine the two while also getting me back into the IT realm and programming again. I want to do it without perhaps not spending 2-3 years getting a master's degree. This would also get me into cybersecurity, which I originally wanted to get into during my senior year.\n\nI also know about topics such as FPGA and ASIC, but normally those engineers have master's degrees.\n\nI'm sure this is poorly written up, but I wanted to express my thoughts as simply as I can. I honestly just don't know what I really want to do.",

Could you please comment on the loudness / quietness of the environment where you perform them? I couldn't find documentation online about environment noise impact on the results of these tests. \n\nWe had false rejections of parts due to what we think is ambient noise readings on these tests, though there isn't much flexibility to the test location at the moment. We have machinery running and people talking. Best we could do is stop talking but turning these off for this test isn't very viable. Until we can find a new location, distancing is the best we can do.\n\nThanks",

The output of ALU flows into ACC register. However from this picture it seems that we can't choose to save it because the enabled output of R0 register also flows into ACC from the bus below it so if we choose to enable 's'ave bit I guess we will get two input bytes flowing into ACC register resulting in the unpredicted behaviour. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my guess is that here it is meant that bus coming from the ACC register goes only one way - down to the general bus. Is my guess correct? If so, how do we implement it? \n\nThis is a very minor question but it's been bugging me since it does not follow from his previous explanations in the book. From the first picture in my post all previous registers only had 2 bus-bytes coming for them - one for input and one for output and these two did not conflict because of 's', 'e' bits of registers. But here, this ACC register seems to have 3 bus-bytes: 2 inputs and 1 output that's why I'm a little confused here.",

I'm trying to understand it at basic level.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Question 1:\n\nTomasulo's algorithm allows out-of-order execution which could result into out-of-order completion. \n\nDoes the algorithm keep track of writing back the results of the out-of-order completions since the results should be written back (to memory) in order (as if program was running sequentially) to keep the data flow correct? I think Wikipedia article is hinting that the algorithm writes back the results in order. Could you please confirm it? Please check the quote below\n\nUnder the section \"*Stage 2: execute*\", the Wikipedia article says:\n\n&gt;In the execute stage, the instruction operations are carried out. Instructions are delayed in this step until all of their operands are available, eliminating RAW hazards. Program correctness is maintained through effective address calculation to prevent hazards through memory. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Question 2:\n\nThough I'm thinking of Tomasulo's algorithm without any reorder buffer, both Wikipedia article and the book, in my view, say that Tomasulo algorithm could produce imprecise exceptions and reorder buffer is used to get the precise exceptions.  Further, the reorder buffer is used for speculation. Is it true that reorder buffer is used to get precise exceptions?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks a lot your help, in advance!",

I don't wanna repeat the mistakes of the past with this one. Any advice you can give me, it's appreciated. I learn best by books. I downloaded several electronics books, and I am even writing my own circuit simulator which I will go back to one day. Remember that I don't want a 'career' in electronics, as it is impossible for a CS dropout, I just wanna exist in the fringes. \n\nSo yeah any advice you give me is appreciated. Even bad advice, or potentially/intentionally misleading ones. Thanks. I just don't know at which discipline I should start my journey? I hate building bullshit for no purpose. I like redoing established stuff my own way.\n\nFor example, take a look at this hashing algorithm I'm making. I wrote the initial version in C++ for integrity check in a custom web framework. But then I decided to rewrite it in Python. It turned out better than I expected. Take a look at this:\n\n```\n'abcdefghijk' -&gt; 1fbf7ef1c0c61a2d\n'bbcdefghijk' -&gt; 9fe6f4ddc0cc2ccd\n\n'0' -&gt; 1fd7bc42c0c7bb6b\n'1' -&gt; 9fd5bd1fc0e203b5\n\nfirst paragraph of this post -&gt; a0c63811c24d25ad\n```\n\nit's a block algorithm with block size of 64 with 4 16bit factors.

I only have 150$ left in my bank but I still like to pop Ritalin and code. I wanna do the same with code!\n\nThanks.",
