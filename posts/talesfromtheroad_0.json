        "text": "Just to Have On Record: Mon 3/21/2016\n  Earlier today I had to call 911 on a female driving a black GMC SUV that would not stop following me. I was inching out to pull out of the Dunkin Donuts on Franklin and Joralemon in Belleville, NJ and she was flying down Franklin Ave, then she slams on her brakes and decided to block me in. \n   Then she went on to start screaming at me, so I respectfully gave her the finger with both hands. This heavyset white female decides to park in front of me to block me in and whips out what looked to me like a passport. I rolled down my window and she kept cursing me out and telling me she was a cop and I simply told her to get out of the way so we can move on with our lives. I also told her that she is definitely not a cop and to just stop with her madness. She did not take kindly to what I said and she hits reverse basically letting me go so that she can try and pull me over. So I said OK thank you and drove in front of her.\n   She was trying to pull me over with her hazards and I just laughed at the situation. She would not stop following me, so I figured why not call 911 just in case anything happens. I told them exactly what was going on and even gave the officer her plate number and the color and make of her SUV (which should all be recorded- \"911call\"). I just want to post this just in case she did take my plates down and just like everyone else in New Jersey, has a family member that is a police officer. I have a feeling that the police around my area (Essex County, NJ) will be giving me a hard time.\n   I will keep posting anything that has to do with the police and tickets for the next couple of months. Last time I got pulled over was (I think) last year or 2014; I got pulled over for having a border around my licence plate. Other than that, no traffic violations nor points in my current driving record/licence (last 5 or more years). I have a clean licence. This can be very interesting, so let us see what happens.",

        "text": "A few yeas ago I went on a Field Service trip to work on an MRI in the NW of the US. I flew into SeaTac and was supposed to have a connecting flight to a small town in the middle of now where. As I was waiting for my connection it go cancelled, so check to see what the deal is. the town in mountains and fogged in. They normally have 4 flights a day there but only one has made it in the last 4 days due to fog. Well I need to get there on time and don't want to spend the night at the airport. I look it up and it's about a 3 hour drive. Immediately I switch my rental car reservation and head to the counter to cancel my connecting flight. While in line I strike up a conversation with a guy (John) who seemed like he had a pretty good buzz on. Once he hears that I am driving to the flight destination he asks if he can hop in with me. I ask him if he knows the way, which he does, so I agree. As we are talking another woman (Mary) hears us and asks if she can jump in. It's not my car, my company is paying for gas and I am a nice guy so I say sure. Now the 3 of are talking and another woman (Sue) hears our conversation and she jumps in. Now I have 3 complete strangers taking a 3 hour drive with me. It will help me get around some of the mountain passes that are closed and keep me awake.\n\nWe make our way to the car and leave the airport. I haven't eaten for a few hours so I immediately find a burger joint. Mary gets out of the saying she is going to smoke(420) and John joins her. I ask Mary if she had it with her on the plane and she says yes, along with some pills in my bag. Now I am thinking great, this chick has a bunch of drugs in my trunk, if I get stopped I am screwed, but we are already on our way so I say fuck it, and head in for my burger. I eat, they smoke we get on our way.\n\nSue is in the front seat, Mary and John are in the back seat. As we hit the road John and Mary are having a conversation that I can't really hear, and Sue is very quite so I turn on the radio, but can find nothing but country. I am a 35y/o black male with dreads, I don't do country, but it's was a distraction so I left it on. About 45 minutes into the ride I check my rear view and see that Mary has moved right next to John. All I can see is their heads but I thought I heard a slight moan out of Mary, but I don't turn around to see what is going on, or make it obvious that I am trying to hear what is going on behind me. But I definitely heard a moan, and think that he has his hands in her pants. \n\nNow I am trying to strike up a conversation with Sue, to keep my mind off what's going on behind me, and to keep her from hearing what I think is going on. We talk about her living in Tx and her kids, husbands business and whatever I can think of to keep the conversation going because she is not much of a talker and we have nothing in common. \n\nAt one point I look in the rear view and I can't see Mary's head anymore, but I can hear some ruffling in the seat behind me, where John is sitting. Now I am thinking that this chick is back there giving him road head. After a few minutes of silence from the back Mary pops her head up and asks if anybody wants a breath mint, Sue and I decline. \n\nWe are now about 2 hours into the ride and we stop at a rest stop. Mary (who throughout some conversations we had I knew was a strange bird) starts telling us about her 50th birthday and how her boyfriend took her to a park and nailed her in a rose garden. Her and John enjoy some more 420 and we hit the road. \n\n45 minutes later Mary's head is gone and I hear ruffling from John's seat. Son of a bitch!!, this guy is getting road head again and I am the one doing all the driving. Again she pops her head up and asks if anyone wants a mint. \n\nWe make it through the mountain passes and reach the town we are heading to. Sue starts making phone calls and wants me to drop her off at a McDonald's where her family was going to meet her. It's 2am and I am not comfortable leaving her there. She insists and gets out of the car. As she is leaving she tells us that she didn't want to be a downer during the ride, but she is coming home to where she grew up because her father is not doing well, and they are basically on a death watch. Well that sucked, I wished her the best, she thanked me for the ride and left.\n\nNow I know through conversations (when she wasn't going down on John) I knew that Mary was going home and lived in a trailer park. But when I got to the hotel John was staying at, they both got out. OK they are going to continue hooking up. Damn it, I did all the driving and this guy is going to get the ass. She did tell me that if I was in town long enough to swing by her place at some time. I wasn't that interested in her to drive out to her trailer park. They both get out thank me for the ride, I head to my hotel and never hear from them again.\n\nTL:DR Picked 3 strangers at SeaTac, drove them 3-4 hours home. Guy finger blasts a woman in the backseat, then gets road head twice. Found out one of my passengers was on a death watch for her father. And I am not a taxi driver",
