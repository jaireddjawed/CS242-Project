        "text": "After finishing White Bear,  I was confused as I usually am after watching an episode, but after thinking about it for awhile, some of the details really don't hold up like they do in the other episodes. \\(extra spoilers warning\\) The punishment that Victoria receives is really stupid and doesn't hold up under scrutiny. My first complaint is that at the end of the episode, the actors are seen setting up for the exact same scenes that played out the previous day, implying that they assume that she does the exact same thing every time they wipe her brain which seems like a huge oversight, because what if it doesn't work? In that case, she'd probably roam around and maybe even find her way out of the White Bear area, which leads me to my second problem with it. It's way too elaborate, and most of it doesn't have a purpose. I understand that the people are ordered to stand around recording with their phones because that's what she did during the murder of the kid, but what was the point of setting up a post apocalyptic town with actors portraying survivors and hunters with the strange masks and the idea that they had to shut down the white bear radio station? It just seems like something that would be entertaining as a TV episode, but makes no sense in the context of the episode, unlike a lot of the other black mirror episodes which all make sense within their respective universes, this one felt like it was riddled with holes. Do you guys also feel this way, or did I look over something within the episode? ",

There was a woman in my abuse survivors therapy group whose attraction was to children (it's more common than people realise when someone's gone through what this woman went through) and she'd draw pictures, write fanfiction, and admitted to doing what Kenny did (although when she was younger, at 13/14 or so).\nBut the first scene with the way he talks/ stares at the girl.. this isn't a kid with a fetish who hasn't yet figured out that he's ruining lives - this is a guy who knows exactly what he's doing and doesn't care! Obviously vigilante justice is a hugely flawed concept in itself, but I mostly see discussions about whether he did/ didn't deserve it and for those who felt badly for him, the main argument seems to be that he's a hormonal adolescent who can't help who he's attracted to! And no of course he can't, but his actions in that moment seem to me really predatory. \n\nI'm curious to know if I'm judging his \"nice gesture\" too harshly (I mean if I notice a woman leave something behind and point it out to her, that doesn't mean I'm thinking \"yeah we should bang!\") But I'd forgotten that scene by the end when I first watched it so when the second time round when that's what they chose to open on I was like OH HELL",

Never the less I always tell people to skip the first episode when I recommend the show, because the writing is honestly just bad. \n\nIt's like an exercise in frustration, watching every single character act incredibly illogically, blindly trusting a terrorist to keep his word, even though he's obviously trying to make some kind of statement and get a reaction. How did no one say the words *\"We don't negotiate with terrorist\"* at any point?\n\nThe first time I watched the episode I honestly expected the terrorist to just kill the princess/his hostage anyway after he, against all odds, managed to make the prime minister fuck a pig on live TV.\n\nI actually think the episode had an interesting premise, it was interesting seeing how the media dealt with it. But I felt like the moment the writers came up with the premise they decided that this episode have to end with the prime-minister fucking a pig, at any cost. No matter how much we have stretch common sense, and no matter how unbelievable it might be. \n\nAnd yeah I get you have to sustain your disbelief to some extend with entertainment, **but no one even questioned the trustworthiness of the terrorist, no one seemed to realize that going along with his demands didn't guarantee the princess's life.** \n\nAll in all it's so far out it feels more like more like a silly drama rather than some kind of meaningful criticism of society.

You run simulations that only get a pass if two people's cookies (which match their real human in every way) feel so strongly for each other that they're willing to rebel against their own reality (the dating world). That's a pretty drastic step to take.\n\nWhich means... the vast majority of simulation sets' rebellion percentage is going to be 0.02% or something. Matching two random people, the chances are very slim that they would like each other so much they'd attempt to climb the wall. Meaning, most people, when matched by the app, would get an extremely small match percentage. \n\nNow, imagine what it would feel like if after seeing hundreds of 0.02's and 0.004's... one day, you get a 60%. Imagine how exciting that would be. That is a huge percentage of simulations in which the two of you are crazy about each other.\n\nIn the episode, the two get a 99.8% match. That's like... incredible, given the system. No wonder they smile there at the end... That 99.8% number is as close to \"true love\" as anybody's ever gonna get.",

        "text": "Hey all, so I'm sorry if the title is confusing, but I'd like to get you guys' thoughts on something!\n\nSPOILER ALERT, I'll be talking about a couple of episodes that contain \"cookies\" (White Christmas, USS Callister, Hang the DJ)\n\nSo, it's been discussed a lot in this sub whether or not the cookies in White Christmas should be looked at as truly sentient and whether or not it's okay to torture them. However, I wanted to look at the simulations in Hang the DJ and the complexity of this episode. I feel that this episode has had less complex discussions about it because it has a happy, straight-forward ending. Anyways, I've just finished watching it for the first time and I came across some interesting comments that spoke about how the simulations were erased and practically murdered for the sake of the real people. I had a similar thought myself but ignored it for the sake of the happy ending. \n\n\nSo I just wanted everyone's thoughts and opinions on this. Did you guys consider it cruel how all the simulations were created and then erased once the data was collected to match the real people up? They believed they were real and felt that they had thoughts and emotions. The simulations are similar to the cookies in White Christmas and the \"cookies\" in USS Callister. Yet somehow I didn't find myself feeling bad about them in this episode at first like I did those two. I noticed that there were much less concerns about cookie abuse in this episode than in the other two, but they were still similar in how they were used by humans. So I was just wondering what you guys thought about this. Feel free to discuss other episodes, but I'm mainly interested in how you felt about the cookies in this episode specifically in relation to the others. Some questions I have stirring around are: What's the difference between the simulations in this episode and cookies in the other? Should it be okay to use/torture one but not the other? Where is the line drawn? More broadly, is there even a line that's crossed with digital intelligence in these episodes?\n\nTldr; Do you guys feel bad for the digital intelligence in this episode like you possibly did for White Christmas and USS Callister? Why or why not? Why or why shouldn't we feel bad?\n\nSorry if this post is rather confusing, I'm normally good with putting thoughts into words but BM takes that ability away every time haha.",
