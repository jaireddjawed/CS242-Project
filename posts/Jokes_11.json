It is shiny and in absolute perfect condition. He immediately buys it, and asks the seller how he kept it in such great condition for 15 years. ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs quite simple, really,‚Äù says the seller, ‚Äúwhenever the bike is outside and it‚Äôs going to rain, rub Vaseline on the chrome. It protects it from the rain.‚Äù Saying so, he hands Joe a jar of Vaseline.\n\nThat night, his girlfriend, Jessica, invites him over to meet her parents. Naturally, they take the bike there. Just before they enter the house, she stops him and says, ‚ÄúI have to tell you something about my family before we go in. When we eat dinner, we don‚Äôt talk. In fact, the first person who says anything during dinner has to do the dishes.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo problem,‚Äù he says. And in they go. Joe is shocked. Right smack in the middle of the living room is a huge stack of dirty dishes. In the kitchen is another huge stack of dishes. Piled up on the stairs, in the corridor, everywhere he looks, dirty dishes. They sit down to dinner and, sure enough, no one says a word.\n\nAs dinner progresses, Joe decides to take advantage of the situation and leans over and kisses Jessica. No one says a word. So he reaches over and fondles her breasts. Still, nobody says a word. So he stands up, grabs her, rips her clothes off, throws her on the table, and fucks her right there, in front of her parents. Jessica is a little flustered, her dad is obviously livid, and her mom horrified when he sits back down, but no one says a word.\n\nHe looks at her mom. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs got a great body,‚Äù he thinks. So he grabs the mom, bends her over the dinner table, and has his way with her in every position right there on the dinner table. Now Jessica is furious and her dad is boiling, but still, total silence.\n\nAll of a sudden there is a loud clap of thunder and it starts to rain. Joe remembers his bike, so he pulls the jar of Vaseline from his pocket. Suddenly the father backs away from the table and shouts, ‚ÄúAll right, that‚Äôs enough, I‚Äôll do the fucking dishes.‚Äù",

The Irishman had never been given such a proposal for his work... \"One moment as I will have to talk this over with me wife.\".... Inside the house the painter and his wife talked it over and decided it would be OK... The painter returned to the Beautiful lady and said.. \" I will paint you in the nude but I must leave me socks on so I have someplace to wipe me brushes.\"",
