It seems to me that the elephant in the room with rising sea levels is all the stuff that will be left behind from the displaced communities. I'm talking about: \n\n* Landfills in coastal erosion areas\n* Nuclear plants\n* Industrial plants\n\nIf all of those are left to be consumed by the ocean it will be an absolute apocalyptic scenario. We'd be looking at orders of magnitude increases in ocean pollution and possible irradiation of the ocean. The pessimist/realist in me envisions us heading blindly towards the problem of sea level rise without consideration of those problems, and when the sh*t really hits the fan communities will collapse and leave behind all that stuff without any decommissioning. \n\nI'm an Earth Scientist, but not in climate (Oil &amp; Gas ironically) and feel like a worst-case scenario would take the planets oceans to Jurassic/Permian conditions of global anoxia, megafaunal death and extinction. \n\nPlease discuss, as I've gone down the rabbit hole a bit today...

So anything under the gravity of a black hole would be parabolic as there is less and less gravity until it becomes spherical but everything with mass has gravity.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis is a concept I've been just toying with and I'm having a hard time disproving it in my own head. I'm not a flat earther, I very much believe in science and physics. Here it is.\n\nImagine a planet with our own gravity but only a 10 yard equator. Now project an xyz from a tangential point on the surface of the planet. Stand on this planet and look directly forward into the z-. What do you see?\n\nDo you see into space?\nOr do you see the back of yourself looking at the back of yourself on an infinitely flat plane.\n\nObviously this is an impossibility. But it expresses a concept that I've been messing with.\n\nThe idea that light bends and warps as it is projected into our eyes as from space which is why we see it as round when we are outside of the earth's gravity observing the earth.\n\nBut while we are in earths gravity the earth is flat.\n\nThe shape of the earth is relative to the location you are in the well of earth's gravity.\n\nThe further out you are in space the more the vectors of space curve before the reflection from earth enters your eye until eventually no light from earth enters your eye. Instead, the light from space enters your eye as it curves in earth's atmosphere and enters your eye so it looks circular.\n\nThe only way to prove this I can think of would be to have a laser parallel with the earth's surface, pointed at a receiver that would be out of line of sight.\n\nBut I dont think this is true because all objects have some gravity and the size and gravity of earth seems arbitrary when you take in account and the variety and size/density of planets.\n\nI must be doing something wrong.

        "text": "For background, I recently posted on Reddit on the transverse field detector. Research papers often make comparisons to Foveon (such as the MDPI paper Multispectral Filter Arrays: Recent Advances and Practical Implementation) Are there fundamental flaws with Foveon that cause higher noise levels in comparison to comparable Bayer sensors? The same research paper said the hybrid transverse field detector with a CFA has \"&gt;80%\" quantum efficiency for visible spectrum (it does not factor in the light loss from the CFA). What are the main differences between Foveon and Transverse Field Detector?\n\nI know consumers and most professionals who do photography only need RGB. Some may want IR spectrum or UV to use false colors for artistic effects or industrial or scientific use. Even reprographic photographers only demand RGB (they may not benefit from additional visible spectrum channels). Reprographic photographers and their clients are very picky about color fidelity. It is easier for them to use devices designed for high precision and accuracy. For consumer use, can the transverse field detector be modified for IR, RGB, and UV. This is so there are lower calculation and memory requirements for ordinary users (again, they only demand faithful RGB and sometimes UV and IR).\n\nThe reason I am looking for ideas on pixels that collect all three primary colors is so the sensor can have what I call XDR (extended dynamic range). Vision Research, a company that makes high speed cameras, has EDR (extreme dynamic range) on select cameras. It served as inspiration for my XDR idea. They work by having the photon collection process for pixels collecting photons at rapid rates stop early in the exposure. Everywhere else stops on time. My concern with a CFA like Bayer is this function will cause false color.\n\nIf the transverse field detector is put in devices for consumers, photographers, industrial, forensic, and scientific users without a CFA; what problems should be factored in? These can include electrical issues before or during A/D conversion. I already know that if limited to RGB without CFA, it would collect 3 times the amount of data versus Bayer. My solution for storage is to use lossy codecs for RAW in consumer devices; the codecs will be carefully designed to minimize destruction to fine details. For applications like photographing stars, users can repair low micro contrast (macro contrast as is) but not reduced spatial resolution (which may cause the \"star eater\" effect). For RAW motion picture, my solution is the choice between intra frame lossy and interframe with Group of Pictures (GOP).\n\nWhat are some ways to reduce the corrupting effects of photon noise and read noise at an electrical level without losing fine details and color resolution? I know both noise types are both inevitable. I found a solution for logarithmic ADC that eliminates a problem with it (Digital Pixel Sensor Array with Logarithmic Delta-Sigma Architecture; from MDPI). I want to modify it for global shutter and XDR as the article talks in terms of rolling shutter.\n\nWhat problems do you notice that should be addressed? What advice do you have? Thanks in advance.",

The scenario, roughly, is thus:\n\nYou have some cells that were preserved in some sort of special resin that desiccated them while replacing the water with other stuff, thus keeping the delicate bits intact--this and some other technobabble allows you to retrieve whole, intact DNA from these cells. (For a little more backstory: this is an accidental, coincidental property of the resin, and most things preserved in it were destroyed long before this was discovered--indeed, long before DNA was discovered.) You have only a few cells to work with, but do know that the place that this was made also housed birds, crocodiles, mammals, and other animals (not in very humane conditions, sadly) that have since become extinct. This and other circumstantial evidence (the blood cells are nucleated, thus ruling out a mammal) leads you to believe that these are the cells of an extinct archosaur that you are very excited about bringing back to life.\n\nThe cell machinery is useless--the cells are full of resin, after all--so you extract the DNA and PCR it (including, in their own separate vials, mitochondrial DNA and whatever's in the nucleolus if that's possible--this probably isn't necesary, but since it's your only shot to clone a possibly extinct animal you don't want to take chances). \n\nHow do you then turn that into a living animal?\n\nFollow up question: What's the oldest/most primitive technology you could do this with? I'd very much like for this story to be happening in the past, and the less tech and theory the team has to invent on its own, the better.\n\n**EDIT:** Alright, I'm getting a lot of \"we can't do that yet\", which honestly was predictable. Alright, new take on it: What would you need to do to figure out what you need to do to do this? Is there anything you **can** do, beyond just trial and error?",

How long would it take for evolution to change the colour of the person's skin from black to white, and how much would the environment be a factor?\n\nSecondly if we were to do the opposite, and have a control group of 1000 or more (number needs to neglect inter breeding and sustain a healthy population) people move to Africa with out mating with the African population. How long would it take to change the skin colour back and would it be roughly the same timeline? ",
