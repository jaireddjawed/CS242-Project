        "text": "But honestly, that is one of my favorite things about Wikipedia. I can feel like it's just in my pocket whenever I need it during a random thought, a disagreement of facts with someone, or actually diving deep into something. It's nice to not have to think about it and just take for granted it's there.\n\nWikipedia's best feature is the fact that it's free. Can you imagine if Wikipedia was subscription only? I don't say that negatively just because I don't want another subscription to pay for (though I don't!) but for another, more important reason. I think there are many people that couldn't afford or wouldn't pay for it and I think the loss is more than just missing out on another entertainment subscription like Netflix or Spotify. I'd bet there are many people out there that wouldn't normally go check out a specific book on a topic or hop online going forum to forum in search for the things they currently just search the Wikipedia page to find out.\n\nToday I was listening to Yellowjackets and wanted to know more about the band so I searched for the Wiki page and a banner came up mentioning donations. I've never donated before and I'd heard complaints in the past about the donation banner and people pushing back about how they should have their own money and not ask for donations. I let the undertone of that deter me from donating in the past not to mention I never had much money so I just never did. \n\nToday when the donation banner came up it made me think about all of the benefits Wikipedia has given me and aside from this specific banner, it's ad-free. Never thought about it before but it's cool I never had to. So with these things in mind, I decided to donate today. I'll admit that it wasn't much but it's what I could spare for something that has been giving me access to pretty much whatever I wanted to know on the spot for years.\n\nSo I'd like to encourage you to donate if you can, even if it's just a couple bucks. Easy, free, advertisement-less access to information is important not just for you, but everyone as a whole and I think this current model of Wikipedia is worth supporting. ",
