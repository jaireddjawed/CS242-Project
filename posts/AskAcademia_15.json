        "text": "So I have been talking to someone who is a PhD Professor and I have been very understanding about his schedule and his lack of availability trying to plan our first date. We made a solid plan time (he made reservations). I have let the talking thing go on for almost 3 weeks. Today was supposed to be our first date. He lives and works a significant distance away from me. \n\n2 hours before our planned date he sends me a message saying he would be late as he ‚Äúhad an issue come up at work‚Äù.  I don‚Äôt like last minute changes and I asked if we should reschedule. He doesn‚Äôt respond for a whole hour. By that time he should‚Äôve already been on the way. I said let‚Äôs just do it another time as he was clearly going to be super late. \n\nNow, this is what I wasn‚Äôt expecting‚Ä¶ he sends me a message saying, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt expect work to interfere. Sorry about that. Had a grad student literally start crying while I was meeting with her regarding here doctoral research. Had to provide support and the meeting took longer than expected.‚Äù\n\nThis rubbed me the wrong way for several reasons. I have been incredibly patient with him, he knew we had a date planned and I don‚Äôt even know how to feel about this whole ‚ÄúI am going to be late because a female student was crying and had to provide support‚Äù situation. \n\nIs this appropriate?",

        "text": "\nI am about to finish my PhD. Thesis done, committee check done, just the defence left but in my country (in the EU), at this point I am done, defence is a formality. So I should be super happy...\n\nWhen I started my PhD, I wanted to do fundamental research in my field (Machine Learning). I thought my supervisor had the same idea, but she turned out to be a lot more empirical than I like. Around the 2-year mark, I realized I wanted to go to theory, but it was already too late. \"Thinking like a mathematician\" was heavily discouraged in our lab, I have been many times told to stop doing that explicitly. I tried to learn as much theory as I can on my own time.\n\nA while ago, I noticed our national maths institute is calling for PhD research interns. They have a theoretical machine learning group that is world-renown. I reached out to a prof I was already following, we met. I told him how I want to do theory but don't have enough experience, and in fact he had a project for me. One that needs a background, but not years and years of background. I applied, and got accepted. It was like a dream come true. At no point have I over-sold myself. I was very open about not knowing theory and trying to orient myself towards it. \n\nNow, here I am, 1 week in. I feel absolutely gutted. I know nothing. We meet twice a week, and he ends up explaining me fundamental things. He told me that the ideal outcome is a paper, but in the end if I just learn a lot he'd still be happy. He is very friendly and never demanding. But... I just cannot stop feeling like I am wasting his time and disappointing him. I feel like I will never get there, so I might as well just make an excuse and cancel the internship... \n\nHas anyone made the jump from empirical to theory in a similar fashion? Any advice on how to capitalize on the internship is welcome.",

I have a few offers in my home country (Canada), but I also have an offer from my dream lab, an internationally-recognized, productive lab with an extremely supportive and genuinely kind PI. However, this lab is in the US. \n\nMy partner and I have been together for 6 years, not married yet but plan to be, and have always lived in Canada. Our family, friends and general support network is here. Not to mention, I have a chronic health issue that scares me a little to lose the free healthcare and team of HCPs I have here. \n\nGiven these concerns, plus the added stress of uprooting our life, including my partner giving up his job, having to either get married or find him a job to support a work visa, I‚Äôm worried that a move to the US might be too stressful and not worth it in the long run. So, I would love your advice or personal experiences on moving with your trailing partner to a new country for your academic position. Did you compromise eventually?\n\nI have also recently become a little apprehensive of academia, considering the job market and instability, so I have been considering applying to alt-ac positions as a compromise to my partner and I. \n\nAny advice welcome, thank you!!",

        "text": "Hi all, I am a 4th year PhD student in the neuroscience field. I work in a very well funded lab with 6 lab members other than the PI (1 research assistant professor, 2 upper level permanent researchers - PhDs hired in a ‚Äúpostdoc‚Äù position but content to remain in our lab, 2 new post docs - one that was a PhD student in our lab previously, and me). There are usually an assortment of other students rotating through as well - first year PhD students, MD students, and more recently some undergrads. \n\nDuring my time in the lab I have trained 6 students (a mix of PhD students, MD/PhD students, MD students, and undergrads). These were basically assigned to me by my PI without any input on my part. At first I didn‚Äôt mind, but it has gotten to the point that teaching (be it explaining every step of what I‚Äôm doing, supervising the student, or trusting the student with something small usually to have to scrap the results later) has severely hindered my own PhD progress. This past summer I had 2-3 students following me around for 8+ hours a day, watching and jumping in to help on smaller experiments. However, my mentor doesn‚Äôt seem to understand that even having a student watching me on most things can severely slow down an experiment due to questions, explaining every step, etc. Teaching and mentoring duties are not a requirement of my degree program either, so I feel that I‚Äôve already gone above and beyond what is asked of me (while still generating multiple publications, preliminary data for grants, etc.). \n\nI‚Äôve tried to have this conversation with my PI numerous times. They will seem agreeable only to then give me a student without any warning - usually presented in the form of bringing the student to me, saying he/she is interested in my project, and leaving us alone as I‚Äôm in the middle of an experiment. I‚Äôve started telling the student I‚Äôm busy and can‚Äôt chat/explain, but they will either stay because the PI brought them to me or leave only to return the next day hoping to catch the start of an experiment. I think this keeps happening because everyone else in the lab (especially the new postdoc who was in our lab previously) has also told the PI that they aren‚Äôt willing to train students. However, I am frustrated because at this point I am the only one in our lab who is on a firm timeline. I‚Äôve done my duty to the lab with the previous students, but at this point I feel that it is a postdoc job to take on these mentees. It came to a head this week when another PI on my dissertation committee pulled me aside and told me she was worried because she could see the pressure I was under and that I didn‚Äôt look well, which was a big wake up call to me.\n\nI‚Äôd like to talk with my mentor again to put my foot down. I‚Äôd love any sort of advice. Is it my place as a student to suggest that the postdocs take on the supervisory role? I will of course be respectful, but I am at the point where I have to stand up for my own career progress. Thank you in advance!",

For the whole span of their programs, they have to publish at least 3 papers at top ML conferences; in fact, they don't aim for journals, just conferences solely. The lab director has a policy for each PhD student that their funding would be cut if they did not produce at least one paper for a top conference per year. And you could imagine how the conversation was going. For the next two hours, I noticed they didn't talk about what interesting discoveries they had made, but rather about how many papers were accepted, what topics were easy to publish, and what kind of paper or criteria should be met to get publication. I don't feel any passion for a research topic or problem from either of them. Even if they have a PhD or have graduated, they are attempting to publish as much as possible at top conferences. They also use the number of publications, like the metric, to look at the work of other researchers or writers.\n\nIt seems that the \"publish or perish\" mentality is not only pervasive in academia but is also expected of graduate students. I know that publishing research is important, but the pressure to write a certain number of papers each year is too much for me. \n\nWhat do you think about this?",

        "text": "TLDR: Former professors made a joke about me becoming their coworker after my PhD. Another one of their former students was upset she wasn't considered the first choice and thought it was because she had children. Ironically both of us would be horrendous professors.\n\nBackground: We are both PhD students in different departments at different institutions but did our B.S &amp; M.S at the same institution in the same department (let's say geology) \n\nShe (late 30s?) did hers degree in early 2000s (B.S.) and 2016 (M.S.). Our department does not have a PhD program, so she went for a PhD in geography department at the same institution. She has kids, but I don't know much else about her.\n\nI know a few professors don't like her due to her attitude and work ethic. I'm not even sure who her M.S. advisor was and we are a small department (12 professors). No one seems to claim her. I overheard gossip that she isn't close to finishing her Ph.D. degree and probably won't finish ever because she's never is working on her dissertation. Since she's on year 7, and her advisor is out of money. I was also told that she hadn't done her quals before COVID. She might have done them by now but I don't know. Also she is a full time PhD student, not part time. \n\nThough even as a PhD student in another department, our old department did hire her as an adjunct for freshmen classes and to be the central academic advisor for the department. I heard a few student complain about her advising skills and that shes too harsh. I never had issues with her till now, but I rarely see her.\n\nI (mid 20s) was 2019 (B.S) and 2021(M.S.). I also was a dual major, and had a prestigious internship. I choose the nearby school for my PhD though mine is in geology. I'm frequently visit my old department because I'm running experiments or collaborating with a few of the professors. Ironically I also would be a bad professor and too harsh. \n\nStory: \nI was out at bars drinking with a group of professors (30s-50s) from our old B.S./M.S. department. This is fairly common since I graduated with my M.S. They do not drink with current students. This was the first time the other woman joined us. I think she had been out with them before when I wasn't around. \n\nSo the professors were teasing me about since I must \"love\" working with them, I should just be their coworker when I'm done with my PhD in a few years. It's not a new joke, they have said it before to me. It's a joke because: 1) It is well established that I want to work at a very specific national lab. 2) the department has no money to hire anyone for tenure track in the next few years. 3) I don't like teaching. \n\nSo I always say \"No teaching, no teaching\" in the style of Arrested Development's \"No touching, no touching\" \n\nAnyways the woman was offended they were \"considering\" me over her for a job that doesn't even exist, and she was their coworker already so she should be consider first for a tenure track job. \n\nThe table was tense, and someone diplomatically but firmly told her \"OP would have the more relevant degree since she would have a PhD in geology and not geography.\" \n\nShe responded something to the effect of \"You're only saying that because she doesn't have children. I could have moved to a new city with a PhD in geology if I didn't have children\" \n\nTo which one of the women professors (who has 3 children herself) responds, \"atleast OP will actually get her PhD degree. Having children doesn't excuse piss poor work ethic and lack of talent.\"\n\nI was stunned but quietly and squeakily said \"I just want to work at [name of national lab].\" Because some reason I thought that would help?  \n\nAnd she stormed off. \n\nAnyways I hear she's bad mouthing me more than the actual professor who said that. I come maybe 4-6 days per month. Though the few professors who I collaborate with told me not to worry about her. She is staff there and I'm just a visitor.\n\nI'm not sure if I should reach out to her or just leave it be. Though I don't have her phone number and never see her in the department when I am around. So it would have to be email. Thoughts?",

It appears that you either pass or fail, or perhaps get minor corrections after resubmission. How common is it to fail after resubmission of thesis with major corrections?\n\nWhat adds to my worries is that my supervisor has quit the academia and basically has not properly gone through my corrections. My area is mathematics and so there were a few actual mistakes in the proofs that were pointed out by the examiner but I believe I have fixed them now. I have asked some friends to have a look at my arguments and it seemed OK to them at first glance, however, they are not experts in my field so I still feel I may have screwed up and missed something :(",

Someone can't do something without me starting to (quietly) pick apart the underpinnings of their actions. I'm getting better about establishing some sort of work-life balance, but this leaves me curious as to how others feel (especially folks from different disciplines).",

Also my coat. Is it normal that you would have a place to drop stuff and grab it later? \n\nIt seems my interview is following a different format than what I have read about with a full day of interviews and dinner on the first day, and more interviews and a teaching demo the second. For the dinner, should I bring a shirt to change into or just wear my suit? \n\nIf they said 50 minutes for the job talk does that mean the talk itself should be 50 minutes or should I wrap quicker for Q&amp;A? \n\nIs it expected that I know the faculty and their research in every department or just the one I am interviewing in and leadership? \n\nThanks in advance!",

Clearly some degree of deviation has to be allowed (it's unlikely a research project's trajectory will follow an application proposal) but changing the research proposal to something else completely is probably unreasonable? What's the 'cut off point' for how much you can change your research proposal?",

My thesis will not be about anything health related, my minor isn't anything health related and neither are my published work, my grants and my extracurricular internships.\n\nBottom line, I have a good CV for a certain carrier path, and now that I am planning on switching, I feel like I have poor background that might hold me from certain positions. I guess I am here hoping someone will tell me \"nah, that's ok, you are not behind, your experience is great in whatever field\". I will finish my masters this year and even tho my grades aren't great due to the time I dedicated to the research, I can sell myself very well in a motivational letter or an interview!

        "text": "  \n\nI am 1.5 years through my postdoc in STEM in a foreign country I am staying in later on. \n\nWhen I only started here, I felt a strong motivation and passion for science, I was willing to work extra hours and searching for new ideas. The university is good (major level upgrade from the institution I did my pHD in) and the PI has a world-renowned reputation in the field.  But since the beginning I almost didn‚Äôt feel anything other than anxiety and frustration. The project that was assigned to me initially didn‚Äôt bring any results whatsoever, the PI changed it couple of times to topics that proved to be equally dead. I couldn‚Äôt manage to establish a good relationship neither with my colleagues nor with my boss. I have troubles interacting with him, I am not saying he is a bad person, he is detached and moody, always busy and he doesn‚Äôt care about anything other than results, which I keep failing to produce (others seem to be pretty happy with him). Sometimes I can spend a whole workday without saying a single word to anyone. I don‚Äôt fully understand my duties and responsibilities here and what is required of me. I spent a lot of time just sitting in front of my laptop and trying to figure out what to do next. Yet I was willing to work a lot, I simply didn‚Äôt have work to do. Moreover, I was and still am blaming all my troubles on myself, for not being smart and hard-working enough, not being active enough, not being resilient enough to persist through setbacks and cope with failure.\n\nWhen I was coming to my prof for advice, I wasn‚Äôt able to get anything constructive other than ‚Äúintroduce these small changes and try again‚Äù. Me and only one more guy are working on this topic, the rest of the group is doing something else and getting results, publication and approval of our PI. I am going to walk out without a single publication and to this point I don‚Äôt care. I didn‚Äôt take vacations because I was anxious for not having anything at hand and didn‚Äôt use my leave days) and now I just can‚Äôt bring myself to work at all. 5 months ago I was thinking about quitting, I was so frustrated that I used to cry in the bathroom after coming to work almost every day. After that time the PI told me off for not meeting his expectations and being potentially the only person from his group who had ever walked out without publications (which is not true btw as I later learned). \n\nI was holding to this position, because it brings me money and I am in a new country and I can‚Äôt go back. Now it‚Äôs coming to an end and I am literally mortified because the project I was counting on didn‚Äôt eventually work out either, and I have to report something to my PI. I am actually scared of him and feel guilty of letting him down. This is the only thing I care about so far. I still don‚Äôt fully understand what was the reason of me doing so poorly here (and I had high ambitions), so I keep blaming myself of that and feel ashamed of myself and disgraced. As I said, I don‚Äôt care at all about science and papers anymore, the only thing I want now is to take a breath and rest.  But I still have time to work and I can‚Äôt do anything, I am paralyzed. How could I come so far if I am good-for-nothing and clearly don‚Äôt fit in here? I am tired of feeling myself as a failure and tired of doing boring useless stuff. I don't want to work in this field anymore and unfortunately this is the only thing I know. How do I deal with those feelings?",

        "text": "I am a PhD student studying in Canada. I am currently in my third year. My PhD supervisor isn‚Äôt very hands-on with students directly, so in my initial years of PhD, I used to be supervised by a Post-doc in the lab. After a year or so in the lab, I started noticing sketchy behaviour from this Post-doc. Once I asked her to show me a code for a result she was going to send to a conference, but she refused stating that she can‚Äôt share the code with anyone (although she did get panic-stricken and had a pale face; as if someone caught her cheating). At one point last year, I tried to reproduce one of her previous works (published two years ago in another conference proceedings, not the one I described above) and got extremely different results from what was reported in her published abstract. I asked her for clarifications and she said she lost all the work from that abstract and cannot find it in her computer. She somehow convinced the supervisor that we did different things and that‚Äôs why my results were different. Apart from this, there have been multiple times I have caught her lying, for example, lying about her results, about her methods, about the data, about the way she is doing her simulations, etc. Many-a-times, I have also noticed inconsistencies in what she says. And I think she probably gets it that I caught her lying, so she just takes a U-turn on what she said and basically ends up saying whatever I want to hear. \n\nMy supervisor seems to favour this Post-doc quite a lot. I am not sure how (or if at all) I should report this sketchy behaviour of hers. Obviously I don‚Äôt have any strong evidence, but I am the only one who could report such a thing, as I am the only one who has worked with her more closely in the lab. I am not sure how strong of an evidence I would need before I can formally report this? But her lying has been going on for quite some time now. Has anyone else been in this situation as a grad student? If so, how did you go about it? How was the situation handled by the university/supervisor when you reported it? What were the consequences? \n\nHave been thinking about all this for about a year now. Still not sure if it‚Äôs the right thing to report!\n\nThank you!",

This I have no idea how to do. It seems like I'm not elegible for most of the scholarships that are offered by universities, and I don't know what are the other ways to get funding. \nAlso, there are some PhD that are offered by private companies instead of universities that may have funding. However I'm not sure if that's what I want to do, since I think a PhD at university is a better option for a future career in academia. \nWhat is your experience with funding and application process?\nAny advice would be appreciated. üôè",
