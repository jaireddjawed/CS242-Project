I have already seen many options, but I wanted to see if there are any other watches that I havent considered yet. \n\nThe specs im looking for are: \n\n-At least 200m of water resistance. \n\n-Shapphire crystal (if there is a very good option with mineral crystal I could also consoder it). \n\n- The diameter should be less than 42mm without crown (from 36mm to 42mm). A lug to lug of 48mm or less. And if possible less than 13mm high. \n\n-Screw down crown, with or without crown guards. \n\n-I would prefer an automatic movement, but I eould consider a quartz or solar quartz movement if the specs are very good. \n\n-Steel case. \n\n-I would prefer it if it came with a steel bracelet. \n\n-I dont know if there is any company offering this at this price range, but a ceramic bezel would be great (if there isnt any an aluminum bezel would also be ok). \n\n-Good lume. \n\n-Date, although I would consider a no date if it ticks the other boxes. \n\nMy wrist measurements are 16.3cm around (6.4 inches) and 5.5cm across (2.1 inches). \n\nIt can be from any already known company or microbrand. \n\nIm not looking for any color of dial or bezel in particular. \n\nSorry for the long post and thank you beforehand for your help.",

        "text": "Let me begin by saying \\*I am no watch expert\\*. \n\nI appreciate watches and have been looking to pick up an Explorer for a few years. I do not track serials or model numbers and so on. I wanted a watch and planned on going by the pictures. That said, I specifically wanted one of the models with the etched rehaut, and I'd been casually looking for one for a few months. \n\nI finally came across on on \\[[authenticwatches.com](https://authenticwatches.com)\\]([https://authenticwatches.com](https://authenticwatches.com)) for what felt like a decent price. They had it listed as a 14270 (which I now know can't even have the engraved chapter ring). There was a single picture \\[on the posting\\]([https://www.authenticwatches.com/rolex-explorer-14270.html](https://www.authenticwatches.com/rolex-explorer-14270.html)), and I swear I scrutinized that to confirm it had the etched rehaut.  Being able to at least make out the Os crossing over the lines (multiply \\[pictured here\\]([https://imgur.com/luqyB5o](https://imgur.com/luqyB5o))), I decided to go for it. \n\nThey immediately called me and asked me to repurchase the item via Paypal, which was fine. I didn't mind, even thought it probably should have raised flags.\n\nUpon arrival, I was holding in my hands a really gorgeous, non-rehaut Explorer-bummer. \n\nSo I wrote back to them trying to see if there had been an error. They proceded to say we could look at the pictures, but that it wasn't possible that I'd seen a rehaut, especially considering the model never had it. In the course of a few minutes, during which I was looking for the images I had seen (linked above), I came across their listing for a \\[114270\\]([https://www.authenticwatches.com/rolex-explorer-114270.html](https://www.authenticwatches.com/rolex-explorer-114270.html)), a model which not only could have the etched rehaut, but also \\*USED THE SAME EXACT PICTURE\\* (down to the photoshop error in \"Oyster\" with the missing O, also getting used and listed as a 114270 on their \\[postings on Chrono24\\]([https://www.chrono24.com/rolex/explorer-black-dial-36mm-watch-114270--id25221421.htm](https://www.chrono24.com/rolex/explorer-black-dial-36mm-watch-114270--id25221421.htm))). This listing had a supplementary side view (missing on the page I purchased from) that showed the lack of etching. \n\nThat said, I still maintain that the image linked on the purchase page does. I was told told it's not a reflection of letters, it's just the minute track, even though the majority of pictures either show \\[little to no reflection in the brushed surface\\]([https://imgur.com/a/JrZA3MG](https://imgur.com/a/JrZA3MG)) or very clearly show the \\[minute track and not letter forms\\]([https://imgur.com/a/WmYdGP6](https://imgur.com/a/WmYdGP6)). \n\nIn the end, I'm just disappointed, frustrated, and feel completely gaslit (including having to argue that these \\[two watches from two different posts with two different model numbers\\]([https://imgur.com/9GsbjFY](https://imgur.com/9GsbjFY)) were the same... they're the same). You be th judge, here's the side by side comparison of one with the rehaut and the picture from the product page. \\[Left is with the rehaut from a known correct photo and the right is from the product page.\\]([https://imgur.com/a/sFRTN5U](https://imgur.com/a/sFRTN5U))",

Since it is about 20 years old however, I also want to keep it in decent condition. I'm looking to start my own collection and would appreciate suggestions for dive watches up to the \\~$2,000 mark. I'm looking for a solid, dependable watch (I prefer the diver-style) with an automatic movement that I can wear everyday to the office, but also take camping or to the beach. I'm considering the Tissot Seastar Powermatic 80; does anyone have one or suggest another model? Thanks!",
