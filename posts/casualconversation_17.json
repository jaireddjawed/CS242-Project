I have a wonderful dog. I’m pretty happy. \n\nFuture-wise, I truly have NOTHING going on for me. \n\nI have like 5k of credit card debt. I could probably get it caught up pretty decently quickly if I stop going out and eating out and stuff but eh, whatever. I have 40k in student loan debt that’s literally never gonna get paid off unless I’m forgiven. I’ll never be able to afford kids so I don’t even bother thinking of that anymore. I live in one of the cheaper big cities in America yet I’m not even close to affording a house. I’m running my 10 year old car into the ground because car prices are dumb right now. I have no aspirations for bigger things in my career cause I like teaching and I like my time off. Not to mention the world is a fucking mess and who knows what the future holds. \n\nI really don’t have shit going for me lmao but I’m sure many others have it worse right now. Guess I’ll just keep on vibing through this mess",

I'm also doing my masters additionally to woking full-time.\nI'm basically doing work of a Junior Brand Manager - which will be the next step.\n\nLast week I've had a yearly self-assessment with my manager. Basically, she told me a lot of good things, like me being organised and structured, goal-oriented, diligent, communicating with distributors/agencies/HQ well and working independently.\n\nThe last bit surprised me, because one of my main problems was that I always had to double check things with my superiors before making a move, even little things. But it did get better now.\n\nWhat she said I have to improve though (and I agree) is my self-confidence. She said it in many nice words but the message was to grow a spine and don't appear as a pushover/stop being so nice.\n\nI also feel like I can do better. I have trouble speaking up in meetings, voicing my ideas, and I get easily swayed if someone is pushy. I am honestly just scared of appearing as rude, disrespectful or stupid.\n\nHonestly I feel like my low position and young age are the main issues. When I work on group projects in my university, for example, I am not afraid to take initiative/speak up/argue for my idea etc. Even my friend said they could feel I was angry when someone didn't do their part.\n\nAnd now idk how to fix it ... Fake it till you make? But how I do I fake it? And what I overstep a line accidentally?",

I was so down to the point I planned to end my life. Even though my life is messy. Talking to my cat and giving him a massage could help me forget about what’s inside my mind. I ate my words before that I will never adopt a cat but turned out my son is the only way to keep me sane. I am not rich but if you love your son you will do everything to spoil him. Even though I am broke I tried my best to treat him what he deserves. When I became a parent I felt what parents felt raising us. It's just funny that my cat took me to another level of parenting I could not imagine I could do it. It's funny because my cat made me realize not having a human child at all. 😹 \n\nNow, I don’t want to die because I am worried no one will take care of my son. \n\nI am typing this while looking at him. I feel so blessed to have him. ☺️",

        "text": "So there is this woman I use to work with. When we 1st started working together we instantly worked well with each other. Over the course of a few months of working we developed this friendship. It was only a seasonal job for her though. So she left. We did exchange our numbers as we were talking. So she leaves and returns home, which is in NC. We continue to text and talk. Developing our friendship and trust. We tell each other personal things and promise to keep everything we talk about between us. We've had our friendship for about a year now.   \nA few months ago she comes back to visit me, others for a few about a week. But this time she brings her boyfriend.  I was shocked she had a boyfriend. Last time I knew she had broken up with her boyfriend then got back together, then broke up again. I was happy for her but also jealous at the same time. I respected her and let it go she had a boyfriend. Then that weeks passes by and they leave.   \nAbout month later she texts me and then calls me saying she broke up with her boyfriend, cuz he cheated on her. We continued to talk like we use too. I then told her I had a crush on her, I liked her. She said she kind of had a feeling I did like her. But she wasn't interested in anything but being friends. I respected this and continued what we had. \n\nToday, I received a text that she was coming here to visit. So she arrives and stays with family she has here. I ask her if she wanted to grab lunch, She replied no, she's tired and wanted rest. I said okay, maybe tomorrow then. So I'm at work, which is a bar. She texts me and asks if she can come by. I said sure. Then she says she bringing another guy friend. I know this guy friend, and hes a player, sleeps around and I know he only wants to fuck this woman.  So the jealous part of me comes out and I text, \"you know he's only trying to hook up with you, hes a player\" She replies she was only gonna dance and have a few drinks like they've done in the past. I replied I'm only looking out you\". She replied that the guy has nothing to do with our friendship and if its an issue that she wont come by. I replied I dont care if you do or dont come by with or without the guy. I just wanted to say in person. ..\n\nSo about 30 mins pass and I realized I made a mistake and owned up to it.  I then text her an apology and that I never should have second guessed her. I also apologized for being a jerk and that I cherish our friendship. She replied I don't need you to protect me or my feelings and she will deal with it herself and said she was going to sleep for the night.  I replied, okay, I'm sorry\n\nSo I need advice, how do I save our friendship, trust and what we had. I don't want to loose her as a friend or have this bad vibe between us.",

Behind one of the chairs was what my grandparents called their whatnot. A mirrored display shelf that had all their old teapots, vases and Knick knacks. My dad came in and told us to stop before we broke something or got hurt. Of course as soon as he left we all dated each other to do it again and I did. The chair flipped straight into the whatnot. One of the vases smashed but somehow everything else including myself was ok. Every one rushed in and when my grandad saw the broken vase he started crying and walked out to his shed. My dad sent me to time out and yelled at me as that vase was the only thing my grandad had from his mother who had passed away when he was young. I was hysterical because I had not only broke the vase but made my grandad cry. My grandad composed himself, came sat with me and said you know what bubblebum (weird nickname but he never called me anything else) I loved that vase very much. You know something else I love something else much more than I loved that vase and that something is you. No possession on earth is worth more to me than you. \nI’ve never forgotten that and from then on I’ve never been cross at my own kids or friends kids if somethings broken by accident as the people in our life are far more important than anything else.",

I am a nurse and did not immediately panic when there was no onset of pain associated with the change. After two days without improvement I called my doctor who immediately referred me to a specialist.  When I went to the ENT (ear, nose and throat) doctor the following Monday he said there wasn’t much he could do but prescribe hyperbaric oxygen therapy, which I did for two months.\n\nSince then, I have had to re-learn life experiences. Driving in the car and talking, deciphering conversations in a crowded space, casual conversations are difficult even tho “much” of my hearing has been regained.\n\nTonight, as I was falling asleep, I asked  my smart speaker to play “forest sounds” instead of regular white noise. That was when I realized what I was missing…. I cannot hear bird songs… the trill of joy, the spirited tune, their morning song… it is completely missing from my right ear.\n\nAs I am trying to fall asleep this new found knowledge disturbs me.  \n\nI have an MRI scheduled in May (I am Canadian), to hopefully learn more, but what I know so far disturbs me.  \n\nBe thankful my friends, for all your senses. You never know when they might disappear!\n\n(Trying to fall asleep with this next wave of knowledge of loss).",

        "text": "Some cats, if you didn't know this, don't stop meowing after they've started. Cats meow to humans, not other cats. They hiss at other cats, but meowing was strictly reserved for our lack of understanding. I don't know why on earth they chose that particular sound to get our attention with, but I once met a cat like this. It would not shut up. And excuse you me, I'm long past this unfortunate event, but I remember, very passionately, the amount of anxiety and rage I felt in this situation. Here I had a cat that wouldn't stop meowing. I need sleep. I need to get up for work. I needed me time because I was hungover and or sick. This little bastard would go on for upwards of an hour. (I know, fellow cat lovers, it means she wants attention. I've given her all I can muster and she still won't stop!) Can you imagine a cat meowing at you for an hour without you being able to stop it within the bounds of adult maturity? It was madness. So I got headphones! Great idea until you lose them. Now you're out a couple bucks AND the very thing that caused your deficit is mocking you full force for an hour straight while you sit in despair. I finally got a squirt gun. There's a lot of mixed opinions on whether or not you should squirt cats with water to train them to behave. I understand that, but she stopped after I used this thing. It was an absolute miracle. It was paradise. Until tonight. When she realized I haven't been using the damn thing for weeks. RIP I hope I find it soon. She's most likely destroyed and buried it",

I guess comedians can be petty too\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/popculturechat/comments/11hcvoc/chris_rock_watched_emancipation_so_he_could_see/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button\n\nI get Will Smith doing it. A person is prone to feeling a lot of pressures at any given moment. Doesn't mean it wasn't silly -- they're comedians after all.  I wish Will Smith or Chris Rock were willing to confront what happened to one another. Maybe less so for each other's relationship, and more so for the sake of anyone else having functional adults to look to. The incident was nothing if not an indictment of how overblown celebrity culture is; everyone's got their opinion on someone else's affairs, and everyone wants to pretend that their opinion or someone else's minor transgression fucking matters",

        "text": "So... I came back in England last week and I was so happy that I got to see my friends again after almost 2 years! There's something \"weird\" going on tho...\nBefore coming back here I used to recall upon some kind of feeling I had, I clearly remembered having some kind of feelings towards someone in my group of friends.\nAfter seeing them I few times I might've realised who that was. I miss her right now even tho we saw eachother in the afternoon and spent a lot of time together.\nIt's kind of painful tho... It doesn't feel like I just miss her, it feels like running out of breath... I hate this so much.\nWhat really makes me suffer tho it's the fact that she's already engaged with another friend of mine.\nI don't know what to do about it, I don't know what to think of it... I just can't get her out of my head.\nI feel like crying right now. I've trying to shake this off in the past few days but it doesn't seem to be working, I just keep thinking about it, I just keep thinking about her.\nI don't know if this is the right place to talk about something like this, but I couldn't come up with any other alternative. Thanks for reading if you made it this far.",
