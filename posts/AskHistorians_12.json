        "text": "It makes zero sense to me. Especially in that part of the Roman Republic when Rome didn't even control the entire Italian Peninsula and their army was completely different.  20,000 men being killed, more captured, at Battle of the Trebia, another 25,000 killed the next year at Lake Trasimene, and then the slaughtering of 70,000 people at Cannae the next year, which was basically the largest army Rome had ever fielded up to that point. Where on Earth were these new men coming from? Who was paying to equip them?? We are over a century from the Marian Reforms, so the army was made up of only land-owning citizens. There couldn't have been hundreds of thousands of farms in Rome's territory in 218 BC for them to draw men from, could there have been???\n\nAnd how was the state able to continue to function? Hannibal was destroying everything in Italy for over a decade. Food, crops, farms, people, cities. And a bunch of Roman allies were switching sides to Carthage. How could Rome still collect and enforce taxes? Was their treasury basically overflowing with gold and silver before the war, enabling them to not have any financial problems?? This one conflict of the ancient world always boggles my mind. I just don't understand how Rome was able to prevail. Fielding and losing that many men and battles, in their home land, in the second century BC, it goes against all rational thought that they would win it.",

        "text": "Anecdote as follows:\n\n&gt; The US standard railroad gauge (distance between the rails) is 4 feet, 8.5 inches. That's an exceedingly odd number. Why was that gauge used?\n\n&gt; Well, because that's the way they built them in England, and English engineers designed the first US railroads. Why did the English build them like that?\n\n&gt; Because the first rail lines were built by the same people who built the wagon tramways, and that's the gauge they used. So, why did 'they' use that gauge then?\n\n&gt; Because the people who built the tramways used the same jigs and tools that they had used for building wagons, which used that same wheel spacing. Why did the wagons have that particular odd wheel spacing?\n\n&gt; Well, if they tried to use any other spacing, the wagon wheels would break more often on some of the old, long distance roads in England . You see, that's the spacing of the wheel ruts. So who built those old rutted roads?\n\n&gt; Imperial Rome built the first long distance roads in Europe (including England ) for their legions. Those roads have been used ever since.\nAnd what about the ruts in the roads?\n\n&gt; Roman war chariots formed the initial ruts, which everyone else had to match or run the risk of destroying their wagon wheels. Since the chariots were made for Imperial Rome , they were all alike in the matter of wheel spacing. Therefore the United States standard railroad gauge of 4 feet, 8.5 inches is derived from the original specifications for an Imperial Roman war chariot. Bureaucracies live forever.\n\n&gt; So the next time you are handed a specification/procedure/process and wonder 'What horse's a*s came up with this?', you may be exactly right. Imperial Roman army chariots were made just wide enough to accommodate the rear ends of two war horses. (Two horses' as*es.)\nÔøº\n&gt; Now, the twist to the story:\n&gt; When you see a Space Shuttle sitting on its launch pad, there are two big booster rockets attached to the sides of the main fuel tank. These are solid rocket boosters, or SRBs. The SRBs are made by Thiokol at their factory in Utah . The engineers who designed the SRBs would have preferred to make them a bit fatter, but the SRBs had to be shipped by train from the factory to the launch site. The railroad line from the factory happens to run through a tunnel in the mountains, and the SRBs had to fit through that tunnel. The tunnel is slightly wider than the railroad track, and the railroad track, as you now know, is about as wide as two horses' behinds.\n\n&gt; So, a major Space Shuttle design feature, of what is arguably the world's most advanced transportation system, was determined over two thousand years ago by the width of a horse's a*s.\n\n&gt; And you thought being a horse's a*s wasn't important? Ancient horse's as*es control almost everything. üòÅüòÅ",

How much of that is explained by each of the following factors?\n\n1) Land reform issues,\n\n2) sanctions (according to [this source](https://carnegieeurope.eu/2022/06/29/zimbabwe-long-shadow-of-sanctions-pub-87313), sanctions were \"placed on Zimbabwe after the land-reform program in the 1990s and years of human rights abuses\"), \n\n3) the introduction of IMF reforms in 1991,\n\n4) involvement in the war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and\n\n5) something else? I am, for instance, aware that Mugabe said that the UK didn't keep their promises in terms of aid to Zimbabwe, but I'm not sure how accurate that claim is.\n\n...I just realized that I misinterpreted the Multidimensional Poverty Index initially. When I quickly read about it yesterday, I somehow interpreted it as \"higher number = less poverty\", but a higher number actually means *more* poverty! This makes things more interesting, since the MPI then seems to contradict the other indicators I referred to. Unless poverty simply increased while life expectency, smallholders' output etc. also increased.",

        "text": "A question that sounds simple : Just google it. But I did found conflicting numbers. YouTube reconemended me, a leftist social democrat a libertarian video about Acadia as a successful example for an libertarian/ancap society. I did not watch the video but read it¬¥s [source](https://mises.org/wire/acadian-community-anarcho-capitalist-success-story). Besides the fact that I do find it a bit ... odd to project something like anarcho capitalism onto a colony from 1650 it was somewhat interesting. One thing that I found interesting was the claim that Ancadian population (just Europeans) peaked at 16,000. I then read the [paper](https://www.rcandela.com/uploads/2/0/1/6/20163847/candela_and_geloso__2021__trade_or_raid.pdf) mentioned on the site to find the source for the population number. It looked at least to my eyes legit. It takes the number of 16,000 from two sources who seem quite old (1968 and 1979).  Besides that I just googled it and found a number on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acadia#Population) (taken from \"La Nouvelle France: The Making of French Canada - A Cultural History\" by Peter M. Moogk) which stated a number of 2,528 by 1714. It also adds another 5,000 people by 1757 just on modern day Prince Edward Island (from the same source). Another [source](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/history-of-acadia) claims around 10,000 people in Ancadia by 1750. Soooo what is it?\n\nThere are more questions that I have about this piece, mostly how exceptional the described form of self rule in Ancadia really was, whether they were as peaceful as claimed and if yes why (was it as claimed in the paper, or that Ancadia had so much free land that settler aggression like in New England was just not needed?). But I will reseve them for another time.",

We do distinguish between the Roman Regnum, the Roman Republic, the \"Roman Empire\", and then Byzantium. \n\nThe \"Germany\" of today could be said to have only existed in 1991 with reunification, or maybe it changed under Nazi Germany, or the Weimar Republic... etc. But modern Germany came about in 1866 with the North German Confederation Treaty, and before that it was a German Confederation that sat beside Prussia. \n\nEngland became a republic in 1649 before reformed back into it's kingdom in 1660, but we don't regard England as ceasing to exist for that period. We DO seem to distinguish between England and what could be considered an English hegemony in the form of Great Britain, and then the United Kingdom. \n\nSo you can see the clear distinctions... sort of. But it seems inconsistent, and this is further compounded by the Chinese Dynastic Cycle, which (maybe in the spirit of nationalism) China would argue as a more or less continuous \"nation of China\" broken up by a particular ruling dynasty and then periods of interegnum. I take most issue with this perception because China itself was conquered by the Mongols but somehow the Yuan dynasty is considered a part of the cycle. \n\nSo here's my issues:\n\n* It's clearly not based on type of government or how long a particular government rules.\n* It's clearly not based on a particular geography as the center of regional power seems to constantly shift, wax, and wane.\n* There does seem to come a point where identities change, though. Rome was simply Rome, even though all rights were concentrated among the citizenry, who themselves were citizens of Rome. It didn't become anything \"more\", ie it isn't referred to as the \"Italian Empire\" or \"European Empire\". However, England becomes GB, then UK... \n\nIt seems to basically be based on who has hegemony, and who has rights. In Rome a limited few had true \"citizen rights\", though there was plenty of stratification. In the UK, English folks aren't superior, they are held equal with Wales, Scotland, etc. In America, though, the people of Guam or Puerto Rico are American citizens, even though their lands have no actual representation at the regional level. \n\nNow that's I've given my train of thought, I'd like to hear from historians on this.",

        "text": "Hi guys,\n\nAs a decidedly secular person, I have always had the casual impression that the Bible is, when unadorned of it‚Äôs religious connotation, a series of fables with which to imbue the readers of the time with lessons of ‚Äúcommon sense‚Äù. \n\nNot all of the Bible, of course. There‚Äôs many things in the Bible which do not conform to this. But it does have lessons like be respectful, help yourself and then others, show humility and quiet piety, etc. to even more a priori lessons like ‚Äúdo not kill others‚Äù and ‚Äúrespect your elders‚Äù. Some of these things really resonate with me (perhaps due to being born into the Western tradition that tacitly accepts most of these Biblical assertions for the underlying structure of society in many ways). These assertions strike me as things that I can deduce with logic and anecdotal experience to be proven as, at the very least, probably the way to go. I did not grow up in a religious household and I hold no beliefs relating to Abrahamic religions period, so I wonder how I could semi-independently come to these conclusions if there wasn‚Äôt perhaps an ounce of truth in them. \n\nHow accurate could my impression of the Bible be? Is this even an academically valid perspective to apply to the work? I don‚Äôt know much from the primary source, so I am eager to see how this perspective holds up to a more rigorous application of subject matter expertise and critical thinking. I welcome any perspective you guys might have!\n\nThanks everyone!",

In fact, historically more often than not the people with the least power seem to be the physically more capable. Slaves did hours of manual labour and so would have been stronger than their masters. There were far more peasant women than noblemen, and yet they‚Äôd have been stronger from working the fields all day than male clerics and administrators. \n\nPerhaps I‚Äôm being stupid, but this explanation just doesn‚Äôt seem satisfactory, and so I‚Äôd like to know if historians have a better one.",

And amongst western europe, the UK tends to lean more conservative than many other powers. France and Germany both have a long history of strong labor and leftist movements, but saw major uprising in 1848 that the British didn't. Both saw larger scale attempted communist/socialist revolutions (see Paris Commune, 1830 revolution, Bavaria Soviet Republic, SPD, KPD, Spartacist Uprising, France's socialist and communist parties, leftist partisans in France and Italy during WWII, etc throughout much of the 19th and 20th centuries). Both have stronger leftist movements than the UK with wider support for labor oriented parties. Now, to be clear, the UK is farther left (in general) than the US, but it very much isn't \"progressive\" in any sense of the word. You can find this pattern amongst a lot of english speaking countries (canada is a bit unique cause of the french influence, but still). Why is it that labor movements tend to be stronger in continental europe than in much of the anglo-phone world? Why were communist and socialist movements stronger in France or Germany than the UK?\n\nI'm not saying that the UK is uniquely conservative or right wing (hell spain was run by a literal fascist for decades, but before that it was an explicitly socialist government, and when democracy returned it was the socialist party that heralded it).",
