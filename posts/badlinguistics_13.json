        "text": "[This article](http://vsviti.com.ua/ukraine/56661) is called \"20 interesting facts about Ukrainian that every Ukrainian should know\". Most of them *are* innocent, mildly interesting facts, but a couple of them come at you way out of left field with some bizarre, nonsensical badling. I translated the worst offenders the best that I could.\n\n&gt;#2. In 448AD, the Byzantine historian Priscus of Panium, staying in one of Attila the Hun's camps located in the territory of modern day Ukraine, recorded the words \"honey\" and \"dish\".\n\nIt's pretty well documented that modern Ukrainian started to diverge from *Old East Slavic* around 1500-1700AD. At 448 there wouldn't even have been OES, there would have been *a* Slavic language. As for the words - honey in Ukrainian is /mɛd/, and it comes from PIE *médʰu. This root has descendants across Europe and Asia for words meaning wine, honey, mead (its English descendant), and nectar. So Priscus possibly did record a word similar or identical to мед, but a Greek or Hunnic word. As for dish, /strɑβɑ/, I have no idea, and I don't know what this \"fact\" is trying to get at.\n\n&gt;#4. Ukrainian is very closely related to Old Slavic, as well as Sanskrit, the closest language to that of the first Indo-Europeans. Incidentally, Ukrainian has many words that are almost identical to Sanskrit words: \"air\", \"to love\", \"horse\", \"tree\", \"fire\"\n\nAgain, not sure what the implication here is. Obviously Ukrainian is close to Old Slavic, but so is every other Slavic language. I don't know anything about Sanskrit, but I checked some online dictionaries and can't find anything like those words. If someone with Sanskrit knowledge wants to weigh in, the words are /pɔˈβitrʲɐ/, /kɔˈxɑtɪ/, /kinʲ/, /ˈdɛrɛβɔ/ and /βɔˈɦɔnʲ/, respectively. They do have some cognates with Sanskrit, but they're far from \"almost identical\". What's more, Ukrainian isn't closely related to Sanskrit by any stretch of the imagination.\n\n&gt;#5. The scientist V. Kobyliukh proved that Ukrainian formed in the tenth to fourth millenia BC. Therefore, the origin of the most important Ukrainian words should be found in Sanskrit, not in Russian, German, Turkish, Greek, or other languages that came later.\n\nThey're just throwing modern linguistics out the door completely, I have no words.\n\n&gt;#6. Ukrainian is one of the most beautiful languages in the word. It's considered the second most melodious language after Italian.\n\nI've seen this exact \"fact\" a few times before - #2 most beautiful after Italian. If you're going to objectify subjectivity why not just say you're number 1? Sheesh. Beauty is subjective, you can't rank or measure languages based on beauty.\n\n&gt;#13. Between the 18th and 19th centuries, Ukrainian used up to fifty different writing systems (but not literacy). By number of orthographies (not but literacy), Ukrainian exceeds the most complex - Mongolian.\n\nI don't know if my Ukrainian skills are failing me or if this is actually that poorly written/difficult to understand. There have been a handful of Latin and Cyrillic alphabets proposed and rejected for Ukrainian, but hasn't Mongolian gone through several different scripts entirely? Odd comparison to make.\n\nThere was also a fact talking about the Ukrainian vocative case and how that case is also found in Latin, Greek, and Sanskrit. Actually a cool fact, but you know that they just included it for the link to Sanskrit. Overall some pretty goofy badling, I was glad to see the comments were skeptical and critical. Strange how the author knows about Indo-Europeans yet asserts that Ukrainian is thousands of years old.\n\nPS: Do my explanations satisfy rule 4?",
