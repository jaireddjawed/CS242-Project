Crocodile was the first major Logia enemy Luffy and  the gang ever fought, thus it was basically Crocodile's only skill as  at that point being invincible and able to control an element was beyond  broken. Without it, Crocodile is strong and tough, but nowhere near as  dangerous as the other Warlords outside of Moria.\n\nSo  that leaves the question, assuming S-Croc doesn't have the Sand Sand  Fruit, what Devil Fruit, Paramecia or Zoan do you think he'll have. Me  personally, kind of hoping for a Crocodile Zoan if for no other reason  than just because let's face we all kind of would like to see that.",

        "text": "With Dragon and Akainu's ages being revealed, I've come to the conclusion that Dragon pulled a James Potter on Akainu. That's why Akainu never refers to Luffy as \"Monkey D. Luffy\" but as \"Dragon's Son\" and \"Mugiwara\" exclusively. It's the same as Severus Snape trying to psychologically prime himself into thinking of Harry Potter as James Potter's son and not Lily Potter's son. \n\nAkainu was in love with Luffy's mother, who was a Marine who turned traitor and joined the revolutionaries, breaking Akainu's heart. \n\nNami's background will be **a major plot twist**. Her ability to read the weather is *not* normal. Hell, I wouldn't even be surprised if Nojiko knows the truth but keeps her mouth shut because the world government would kill her family. There's no way Oda wrote \"Bellmere found Nami and Nojiko on a mysterious island\" for no reason. That island was most likely obliterated and Nami's background is going to be a huge plot twist.\n\n**My theory**: Nami's the \"last descendant\" of the Royal family of the ancient Kingdom that got wiped out before the Void century. I'm betting part of the reason it's a \"void century” is because the World Government probably wiped out every last island that had strong ties to that ancient Kingdom and Nami's original island just happened to be \"missed\" after a major event once the “void century” was officially formed. They probably weren't high-ranking up the family food chain, but likely have direct bloodline descent to the royal family of the ancient kingdom. Nami's background is going to be the final shock-twist of One Piece, even after the Straw Hats reach Laugh Tale. Essentially, “Celestial Dragon” was a term for royalty in the Ancient Kingdom (the name of which is probably “One Peace”) for those who could feel the weather patterns. This will probably be revealed after Nami breaks into the Celestial Realm at Marejeois when the Straw Hats finally attack it after everything with Blackbeard is settled; after freeing Arlong and the other Fishman from depraved Celestial Dragon slavery, the plot twist regarding Nami's backstory will be revealed by someone either from the Gorosei or the Revolutionary Army.\n\nAnyway, go ahead and downvote, as no theory is ever taken seriously on here.",

When the pilgrims arrived they would hand the parchment to a knight who would take out money and give it to the person this is what went on to lead to the modern banking system.the knights however became corrupt and greedy taking the money for themselves and demanding people give them more they were seen as fat and lazy people arrogant and cruel.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p0xvgf862lka1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6d786efa81a6adad89def6eb02006cd53f25e2e0\n\nmany people today think the knights are around still and control the world governments.\n\nbaphomet is regarded as their leader,  Baphomet is regarded as a the representation of balance good and evil and I think that fits as we know before luffy the system was balanced between the wg and yonko but luffy disturbed that balance causing a chain reaction of chaos.\n\nNow if you ask me Baphomet kind of looks like these guys\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2uk2r7ra2lka1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0456881c8ac0283bbc962869f9c284c3d847c583\n\neneru holy army of goat people with wings,  speaking of eneru\n\nHis ears resemble goat ears but he is missing wings and horns.\n\nit’s been believed he had his wings removed and replaced with the drums and I think he also had his horns removed as well or is hiding them\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mrz19ypd2lka1.png?width=540&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2c3963894928d6e37898194bd9af53830b3beff3\n\nmaybe hidden in his Afro ? could eneru be tied to Imu in some way ?\n\nNow back when the straw hats were separated brook was sent to an occult village who were trying to sermon satan to liberate them from their enemies and brook came in and met the leader a man who had a black sheep on his head.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jehyyxsf2lka1.png?width=1575&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=851527061547a554bf0be9bad4a8c74115835393\n\nAnd to be honest this symbol looks familiar\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rwsy7mdh2lka1.png?width=1620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fdc4318fa5d913c2c69e3db60fd5414a54fbf606\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yb7w19eh2lka1.png?width=1620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3a09cde1fbf5991f8fb870ff3291fe715d9149c4\n\nwe can see it all over the walls in the room of authority.\n\nAs I said oda is a Capricorn which is a constellation and we know there is a celestial theme with the goresei like Saturn.\n\nthe Capricorn is a sea goat so where does the sea come in ?   Well there’s 2 connections.\n\n1,  the pentagram originally had Hebrew letters surrounding it\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ie88dbxi2lka1.png?width=440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=809341cc7cb3c038e5c0ca0163cbfe11b4294c6a\n\nthese words spelled out the word leviathan which is a giant sea serpent maybe a connection to Poseidon\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bzpvd8h13lka1.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b88cb9ac19875e34c5c7ad9766168fd19c8d5435\n\nimu backwards is umi which means water in Japanese and vegapunk told us that the reason df users can’t swim is because of Mother Nature forbidding them from the sea.now this is a coincidence but on google.\n\nNow this is just pure coincidence unless oda made damn sure this actress was hired but an actress named Brigette Goudeau is the voice actress for sengoku goat which is weird as I would assume they would just use a real goat or generic goat sound affect\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0agidxok2lka1.png?width=1620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=28e5af5f54fe0292c057f2312a3eac6769468f6f\n\nshe also plays a servant for eneru Another coincidence.  But the reason its weird is.\n\nBrigette Goudeau Is a French name,  Brigette means someone with power or someone with the highest of authority.  Goudeau means god.\n\nthe goat who I think is imu is voiced by an actress who’s name means highest god.  How freaking weird is that !?\n\nbaphemot is also pointing at 2 crescent moons one is light the other dark. Now that made me think of pink Floyd dark side of the moon album and I came across a image that blew my mind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1jydnsjl2lka1.png?width=1873&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5a813e063b00ebbe9c2d77e30e9c20981545170b\n\nNow this takes me to the next part…..carrot.\n\nwhy did oda put carrot into the new cover ?  Well I don’t think she will stay in zou and will join the crew but it was important that oda show us that carrot was considered why ?\n\nthis takes me back to an old theory,  I believe the ancient kingdom was the original home of the minks and the leader of the minks was a lion.  I say this because sulong means moon lion in Japanese.\n\nAs I said oda was born in the year of the rabbit but he said he was a rabbit with a heart of a lion.\n\nhe also had this \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yx8xfknozkka1.png?width=1620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=dafe1a27caf643c56b12f828e184c73e1b1154af\n\nnow this takes me to gaimon.  Gaimon is the man who got stuck in a chest and now lives on an island of animals that are mixes of 2 different animals.  Over the time skip he met a woman who was stuck in a barrel named sarfunkel named after Garfunkel from Simon and Garfunkel \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z2udkxy30lka1.jpg?width=760&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=61f10f4011b0bd84dee1da7316a8388ab67f4466\n\nsome things feel off like how her barrel has the word caution on it.\n\ni believe this symbolises a few times. Gaimon was a stand in for joyboy and the animals are the minks so who is sarfunkel ? Maybe she’s imu,  \n\nso what I am thinking now is back in the day there was 2 kings of the minks the king of the day and the king of the night just like now in zou.  The king of the day was a lion mink who had similar traits to a rabbit and the king of the night was imu who might have been some kind of common ancestor of the minks fishman and lunarians they were friends and one day they met nika and the 3 of them really bonded however nika left their land to go on an adventure and the king of the day exited ran off and joined nika on his adventure leaving imu alone which is a trait minks have like when inu and neko left zou as kids without telling anyone or how they left wano to join oden without telling anyone or how they left whitebeard without telling anyone to again join oden which feels way more intentional this time because oden asked if they wanted to come and they said no but then snuck on anyway. Carrot snuck onto the sunny without telling anyway and I think she snuck off again and something happened to her.\n\nbut anyway I believe a war happened between nika and his enemy there are 2 kinds of pirates morganeers who cause chaos and peace mains who stop them and there is also peace mains and morganeers. This time it’s luffy vs bb.\n\nThe war was so terrible that Imy began hatching A plan and when joyboy came along imu made her move and created the world government.\n\n  So I believe imu is heavily involved with the minks for some reason\n\nwhat is oda planning ?",

The glaciers melting from the change in our climate is revealing gigantic meteor impact sites. The academics censoring New archeological evidence and not changing the current school curriculum to reflect these findings. The research journals we hold in high academic regard for science being influenced by government funding or even censored. Doctors being censored to only say and do what is approved from the ones determining public policy. The fate of the people determined by their government. When they controll what goes in history and what is shown in the media, what is shown on the internet, how can we notice that nothing is wrong? It seems similar to conditioning a culture. Making them so busy that they don't have time to look around them and notice how strange everything is? Our screens have our eyes focused on everything but our surroundings. Is our urban environments a well constructed way to control the masses? \n\nIf we have known this all along then what is to come? We recently started to ban psychadelics, would it be far fetched for the public to start really questioning what has been going on? \n\nI wonder if Oda has a real team like the revolutionaries going throughout the world uncovering its mysteries and subtlety telling us what is going on in our world here.\n\nIt seems like the worlds government has deleted our history, manipulated knowledge to create a controllable populace dependent on their government. To ideally create control make the people enjoy their confinement. Technology and ai specifically designed to keep us distracted from paying attention to anything else. Societies left with no time to stop and notice this strange world and phenomenon around us. Banning and making nature illegal. Banning the specific plants that cause you to question everything you've been told. \n\nWhy if the ocean has been left majorly undiscovered, that we haven't been setting out to sea trying to discover what anomalies and mystery this world contains? \n\nOda is setting up the great pirate era as we speak, the swelling of peoples dreams, curiosities, dreams, and passions. The human race  becoming awakened with the power psychadelics. He will inspire all of us to set out to sea at the end of one peace to start a new romance dawn.",

        "text": "I’ll get straight to the point. Gaba-gaba (ガバガバ) means to “gobble up” in Japanese, and like most other devil fruits, it’s an onomatopoeia. And in typical One Piece fashion, it is also a play on words: Kaba (カバ) is hippo in Japanese. \n\nThe hippo, as many of you might know, is the animal that Oda associates Blackbeard with, as seen in cover arts and SBS. We all accepted it because they share similar physicality but also hippos are the deadliest animal known to man, while also being proficient killers in water. But what if the comparison doesn’t stop there? Hence, the devil fruit’s play on words. \n\nIt has been a mystery for years how Blackbeard managed to eat two devil fruits (Yami-yami and Gura-gura) and lived to tell the tale. There have been many theories on this, but I’ve never seen the one I’m proposing. Having a gobble-gobble fruit would presumably give him the ability to imbibe in whatever he wants, including multiple devil fruits. I believe he had this fruit prior to the Yami-yami no mi and would fit his character well",

In Arlong park when Zoro first reunited with Nami, and while he was tied up just leaned back into the water knowing Nami would save him? Wow.

Not even caring that his arm could be cut off???

The two being Miss Goldenweek that is translated to Fröken Sportlov and  Mr 2 Bon Clay translated to Mr 2 HäggoSyren.\n\nGoldenweeks traslated name is referring to a one week school leave all schools has around the end of February when many sport related activities. It's common to travel somewhere to ski during said week. I guess you can say its similar to the golden week but sportlov is not related to any holidays, just on week off for no real reason.   \n\nMr 2 HäggoSyren I find quite clever but probably flew over the head of many swedish readers. Hägg and Syren are two different flower bushes that both blooms at different times during summer. A  saying \"between hägg and syren\" is a way to refer to the short period of summer between when the 2 bushes blooms. While this exact period is different depending on weather I think it tends to be close to when the Bon Kurei festval occurs.\n\nAnyone else have any stories about localised names from One Piece?",

If we believe any warlord is ok the table as a clone and any impel down prisoners fruit is on the table, then I think it's entirely possible that she has created a Blackbeard seraphim, who can utilize more than one fruit copy, is currently running amok and listening to Lilith's orders. He could theoretically have any of the powers of the previously imprisoned ten titanic captains, but I will leave them out for now since we do not know if vegapunk was allowed to pick from level 6 inmates. I believe that vegapunk actually has the powers of Mr. 2, Bon Clay himself, along with at least one other fruit power, although I'm not sure what it might be. This could theoretically allow the seraphim to look like anyone it has touched, completely hiding itself as a seraphim. We also know they are capable of talking, so they could issue orders to each other if they had a pass.\n\nAs I was writing this a thought came to mind. It's not entirely impossible for the vegapunks to give a seraphim their brain brain fruit. What would this do to a seraphim? Could it allow the seraphim to surpass their restrictions? I believe its entirely possible for a Blackbeard (or really any other warlord) to have Bon Clay's fruit and be causing this mess under orders. But if it's a seraphim gone rogue, I think it's a Blackbeard seraphim with the brain brain fruit and clone clone fruit, allowing it to control the other seraphim as a vegapunk and allowing it to ignore orders. \n\nLemme know if you think this is possible and/or probable. Or just discuss some other things that could further or piggyback from this theory.",

Luffy and co will be turned into slaves by Gorosei\n2. Kid and Law will be defeated and probably imprisoned somewhere far\n3. Garp will be killed but Koby will be freed.

Doflamingo has always been saying that the WG is in a precarious position and knew fully well that one could, with the right plan, take Imu's spot. Xebec, a man Blackbeard seems to idolize, also thought this.\n\nThere are two key things that the King of the World cannot rule over, even after 900 years.\n\n1) The sea. The sea is simply too vast to capture all of the pirates. Even with the strength of admirals, Imu cannot wipe out piracy for good.\n\n2) Devil fruits. This random and flexible power system allows people mobility in terms of power hierarchy. People everywhere can pop up with a power and live a freer life. Due to reincarnation and 1 per person rule, they cannot easily hoard them.\n\nBlackbeard does not seem to have this problem. He already rules a good chunk of the sea with his yonkou fleet. He could always expand that.\n\nAnd as for devil fruits, his fruit seems to allow for the manipulation of them. He alone on the ocean is the one most suited to hoarding all of the devil fruits. Not only has he been ruthlessly accumulating them, but he has two of the most powerful ones locked within his body. If he is able to manipulate them, then it is the same situation as AfO in MHA, and the world is in danger because there now exists a man who can regulate the flow of true power in the world.\n\nSo think that there is a good chance that he can distribute these powers more freely to his most trusted subordinates and give them some really strong abilities in addition to the ones that they already have. And this would justify the BB pirates being the final opponents of the Strawhats.",

But i feel this meeting will turn out different ,instead of rockstar being sent back he'll either get killed / captured by kidd , maybe even used as a way to protect himself from shanks . This will give kidd some plus points in terms of feats and at the same time doesnt mess with shank's reputation . I still believe kidd will die and his death and flashback will give us insight on shankss past . Also in the chapter there is a line about the celestial tribute, where elbaf residents are requesting shanks to take some , im still not sure what this could lead to but it surely is intentional .

        "text": "**For reference: I just finished episode 1052, and have been caught up with the manga for a while now**\n\nWhen I caught up with the manga, I thought I would lose interest in the anime, or be angry with how little content they cover in the anime (roughly one chapter per episode). But for the past few months of episodes, I've been absolutely loving it.\n\nIn the past, they used to just extend scenes in a really obvious, dumb way (sumo fight was peak of this); or pan to a needless 5 second clip of everyone in Wano's fight/situation without actually adding any diologue. And flashbacks galore. \n\nNow, they still do this, don't get me wrong, but they also actually add new content to scenes (like Yamato and momo running through the rocks, or Zoro's fight with King). Like, in a way where it just seems natural. Or they do something very \"artistic\", like that shot at the end of 1051 when Momo first used his flame clouds; or again, the scene in 1052 with zoro vs King in that \"tiger vs dragon\" scenery.\n\nIdk, where does everyone else stand on this topic right now?",
