        "text": "I’ve got interested in transgenderism and noticed that many trans people say “I’ve always FELT I’m male/female”.\n\nE.g. a typical transwoman narrative would be like “Since I was a child, I preferred to play with girl toys and wanted to wear make-ups and pink stuff like my mom (or sister or many adult women) and I got along better with girls.”\n\nBut toys, makeups, feminine clothes etc are socially/artificially developed “women’s stuff”, not biologically/naturally. Women tend to wear certain clothes or makeups is a result of socialisation.\n\nFor example, if you were raised like Mowgli or Tarzan, you wouldn’t dress like how humans usually do.\n\nSo maybe you like socially resulted aesthetics of femininity, but that doesn’t mean you’re biologically female because you can be male and still like those stuff. It would be a very close-minded thing to say “As a man, you cannot want to wear makeups. If you do, that means you’re mentally a woman.”\n\nThen is there any way to tell that your “FEELING like a woman” happened biologically?",

But if you compare same-aged Asian and Caucasian, usually the Asian looks much younger as they have way less wrinkles.\n\nDo they still have more melanin than Caucasians? Or the amount of melanin is actually not significantly different but they are just better at sun protection? Or they just genetically develop less wrinkles?",

I am looking for suggestions of some certifications I can acquire in the short term to get a decent-paying job in the industry while I pursue a path in another industry. Any details, stories, experiences, suggestions would be really helpful. I've considered the CLS program but I live in California and competition is high. It's just too much for something I'm not up to pursuing in the long run. Looking to get paid around the 30-40/hr mark if that is information that helps.",

        "text": "I read about a study on Psychology Today about the placebo effect. People who were allergic to nuts were given a powder. Some of them were told that the powder did not contain nuts. They ate the powder, and they did not have a reaction, even though the powder contained nuts. They did not have a reaction as they expected not to have one. Their blood levels of histamine were checked. No histamine was released.\n\nThe others were told the powder contains nuts and when they ate the powder, they had a reaction since they expected to have one, even though this powder did not contain nuts. Their blood levels of histamine were checked. They had a significant, measurable histamine reaction because they expected to have one.\n\nMost importantly, what this study showed is that when nut-allergic people were expecting NOT to have a reaction, they didn't - even if they ingested the allergen. Their brains told the immune system ''everything is clear'', so to speak. This is proof that the brain has direct control over allergic reactions and the immune system.\n\nSo, if a person was given a pill (which is actually just a fake pill with no active ingredients, but the person is not told this), and they were told it's a new pill which will cure an allergy, and after they have taken the pill, they will no longer be allergic to the allergen, would they be cured of their allergy if they were completely convinced it would cure them?",
