Besides yesterday having been United Nations Day, I thought it may be of interest to the community because President Donald Trump constantly justifies the reasons for pulling out of various international trade pacts and treaties due to their perception of limiting American sovereignty. Given \"America First\" has also meant pulling out of various U.N. organizations and approaching other countries in a starkly different way than predecessors, figuring out how much reason he has behind his reasonings seems appropriate. (Stewart Patrick is also quite accomplished, which hopefully leads to some insightful personal questions.)\n\nIn the past we've done AMAs and the top comments have regularly been from NeutralPolitics regulars. For that reason I wanted to thank you for making those events a success. If you choose to ask a question or simply check this one out, we really appreciate it. \n\n[Here's a link to the AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/78nl3w/i_am_stewart_patrick_senior_fellow_in_global/).\n\nCheers!",

        "text": "The main point of the question/s is to discuss the relationship that local councils and local governments has with the bigger picture nowadays in any modern democracy:\n\n- How much power do local governments represent, if any, and should that be taken into account in current politics or it doesn't hold any real significance.\n\n- Is it sustainable when there's such unbalance between one territory and another —like it's happening now in Catalonia— and what kind of measures should be used to solve this, taking into account that these kind of conflicts have historically escalated into violence and wars, making that an unacceptable way —and one that the catalans aren't going to push.\n\nActual question/s are at the bottom, after all the context is given.\n\n---\n\nSources for claims in title (basically electoral data), plus involved parties political alignment:\n\n1. [AMI](http://www.municipisindependencia.cat/), Association of Municipalities for Independence (link is official webpage), has, according to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Municipalities_for_Independence), *\"the support of 786 town councils out of the 948 total in Catalonia (82,9%). In addition, 39 out of 42 county councils give support to the association and also all the four Catalan provincial councils.\"*\n\n2. The lasting ~20% of City Councils are owned by PSC and CSQEP, which are center-left and hard-left leaning parties that are part of state-wide parties ([PSOE-PSC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialists%27_Party_of_Catalonia)) and coalitions (CSQEP and [Podemos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podemos_\\(Spanish_political_party\\))). Those parties are the actual opposition in [the Spanish Congress](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Spanish_Congress_of_Deputies_\\(12th_Legislature\\).svg). PSOE (the main spanish opposition party right now —homologous of Democrats in the US, and Labour in the UK) rejected 155 application during all the legislature, but has backed it once the PP-Ciudadanos Government pushed for it earlier this week; Podemos, the 3th party in seats, rejects it all the way.\n\n3. Between the aforementioned City Councils ruled by PSC or CSQEP, are most of the biggest cities in Catalonia, like Barcelona and the cosmopolitan surroundings, Tarragona, or Lleida, making 3 of 4 the province Capitals. This shows an interesting part of the whole point, imo: the political weight that life in big cities —\"modern, cosmopolitan life\"— has in these kind of matters that affect the rest of a territory, with lower density.\n\n4. Albeit those ~20% of City Councils aren't part of the Association of Municipalities for Independence, many of them have already [openly rejected](http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20171021/432245123748/alcaldes-psc-piden-rechazar-155.html) the application of 155 —including the Barcelona one, which mayor is part of CSQEP, the coalition party that rejects it in the Spanish Congress. This doesn't mean they will not abide, but it shows their disconformity.\n\n5. The actual [government in Spain](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/XII_legislatura_de_Espa%C3%B1a), elected in 2016 and that pushed for the 155 application this past week, is mainly PP with the support Ciudadanos. Between those 2 parties, they rule one single tiny town in Catalonia (sourced in next point).\n\n5. The only City Council owned by Spain's ruling party (PP) in Catalonia is [Pontons](http://www.huffingtonpost.es/2017/07/18/la-vida-en-pontons-el-unico-municipio-catalan-donde-gobierna-el_a_23035629/), a 453 citizens municipality, making it an anecdote —still, as a curiosity, that town had a [80% turnout](http://elmon.cat/politica/arrasa-lunic-municipi-governat-pel-pp) in the 1-O 'illegal' referendum.\n\n7. Among the previous point, Ciudadanos, the party that supports PP in Madrid and earns them the Government, hasn't got a single municipality currently —and has only had one single mayor there, in it's brief history.\n\n8. Results of the current events, ~70% Mayors in Catalonia are allegedly [being prosecuted](http://www.elmundo.es/grafico/cataluna/2017/09/08/59b28078e2704e19168b4593.html) for having shown public support and collaboration with organising the 'illegal' 1-O vote. [37 have already](http://www.larazon.es/espana/la-fiscalia-cita-a-37-alcaldes-como-investigados-por-su-apoyo-al-referendum-AE16034422) appeared in front of the judge.\n\n---\n\nFurther context:\n\n**What is the 155 article of the Spanish Constitution, and why has it been pushed?**\n\n- The 155 article of the Spanish Constitution [was pushed by Spain's Government](https://elpais.com/elpais/2017/10/21/inenglish/1508587023_487115.html) this past weekend, and will have to go through the Senate to be approved. Such article is [a measure](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art%C3%ADculo_155_de_la_Constituci%C3%B3n_espa%C3%B1ola_de_1978) to shield the State from disobedience in any autonomous community, when any autonomous government (in this case, the catalan Generalitat of Catalonia) rejects following the requests of the Central Government, which would be backed by the Constitutional law that rules us all.\n\n- The reason for Madrid's central government applying the 155 is the Catalan Government push for an Unillateral Declaration of Independence. The reason the Catalan Government has been able to push for that it's because it has [an absolute majority in seats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_regional_election,_2015#Results), as of the last elections in pro-Yes parties. After the 'illegal referendum' as the finishing point of the legislature —complying with the main point of their electoral promises— the Independence of Catalonia was [announced yet immediatelly suspended](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/10/catalan-government-suspends-declaration-of-independence), after the 1st of October vote. The immediate suspension was to call for a dialogue in terms, for negotiating a better way out —a legal one— than the unillateral, after the Catalan Government considered the [1st of October 'illegal' referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_independence_referendum,_2017) success substantial enough to push for independence. That kind of measure has been compared with the [Slovenian way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brioni_Agreement) of gaining independence in 1991.\n\n- This suspenden situation lasted about a month, and the Central Government finally pushed for the 155 to prevent anything else from happening. This will take away any political power from the Catalan Government, rendering the Catalan President unable to push for anything, overtaking any offices they consider necessary for the time being, plus the control of catalan autonomous police, and the public media apparently, too. In other words, the 155 is an 'à la carte' article to make the territories follow the Constitutional law.\n\n- Pushing that article will mean that PP, a party with [8.49% of the votes in Catalonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_regional_election,_2015#Results), will rule that territory for a while —only with the backing of Ciudadanos though, a party that has 17.90% of the vote in Catalonia, summing to 26,4% of the votes of the territory with PP. This engorges 1/4th of the people entitlement, while it creates greater distress over the 48% of pro-Yes voters, being the distress present but lesser in the lasting ~25% (pro-legal-referendum parties).\n\n- Albeit the main goal of the PP is, allegedly, to call for new elections in the Catalan Parliament as soon as possible, [polls show](http://www.elperiodico.com/es/politica/20171022/encuesta-elecciones-cataluna-6371299) that the independentist simple majority is consolidated, showing a quasi-identic scenario. As such, pushing for them isn't solving anything apparently, making the situation stuck and unsustainable long term.\n\nLast but not least, for context on independentism in the contemporary world, mainly Europe:\n\n- [Unillateral declarations of independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateral_declaration_of_independence), being Croatia, Slovenia, and Kosovo, the last ones in Europe the last half of a Century, after wars and violent episodes.\n\n- ~~Non-unilateral~~ [declarations of independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_independence), in modern Europe, include mainly the countries that were former parts of the USSR, like the Baltic Countries and many Balkanian ones.\n\n**edit**: removed \"non-unilateral\", as that was an error of mine adding it for emphasis, and /u/CQME kindly addressed that this was not right.\n\n---\n\nSo, for the question/s, I guess they are:\n\n- **Are there any other modern territories where virtually none of the local councils are represented by the main party, or any coalition, that rules the upper instances of the territory, outside of it?**\n\n- **Are such scenarios sustainable only by the rule of law, which is the only thing the Spanish main parties have said they'll follow, ever?**\n\n---\n\nI'm quite illiterate in terms of history and politics, but the closest situations I know of are:\n\n- The Northern Ireland situation, where they're mainly overruled by the UK in many things (part of the peace treaties), albeit Wikipedia shows me that [there're a big deal of local governments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_in_Northern_Ireland) ruled by unionist parties in Northern Ireland —as far as I can tell, unionist conservative parties like DUP are part of the Conservatives main party, in the House of Commons, and Labour does too, so there's indeed some balance there.\n\n- In Spain, the other really distinct autonomous community, the Basque Country, has too [3 out of 251](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partido_Popular_del_Pa%C3%ADs_Vasco#Elecciones_municipales_y_forales_2015) city councils. However, as center to right Basque Nationalists aren't currently pushing for independence, they actually have some deals with Spain's hard unionist parties like PP and Ciudadanos. (In Spain, which screams conflict, the main voted party is the 4th and 5th party in Catalonia and Basque Country, gathering ).\n\n- It's worth mentiong that the above 2 territories had a violent apporach by radical groups back in the day, being [ETA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETA_\\(separatist_group\\)) a terrorist group for Basque independentists, and the [IRA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army), a paramilitary army.",

Virtually all men - ages 18 through 25 - must register. Only if there is high compliance with this law, will a future draft be fair and equitable.   The obligation of a man to register is imposed by the [Military Selective Service Act](http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title50/chapter49&amp;edition=prelim), which establishes and governs the operations of the Selective Service System.\n\n&gt; The Alternative Service Program would provide public service work assignments in America's communities in lieu of military service for men classified as conscientious objectors to all military service.\n\n---\n\nOn the SSS's website, [it also states:](https://www.sss.gov/Registration/Why-Register)\n\n&gt; By registering, a man’s ***voluntary*** participation helps provide a hedge against unforeseen threats. It is a relatively low-cost insurance policy for our nation.\n\n[And:](https://www.sss.gov/Registration/Why-Register/Benefits-and-Penalties)\n\n&gt; ***Failing to register or comply with the Military Selective Service Act is a felony punishable by a fine of up to $250,000 or a prison term of up to five years, or a combination of both.*** Also, a person who knowingly counsels, aids, or abets another to fail to comply with the Act is subject to the same penalties.\n\n&gt; If a man fails to register, or provides Selective Service with evidence that he is exempt from the registration requirement, after receiving Selective Service reminder and/or compliance mailings, his name is referred to the Department of Justice for possible investigation and prosecution for his failure to register as required by the Act. For clarification, if a man is exempt from registering with the Selective Service System, his name is not forwarded to the Department of Justice. The federal law stipulates that names are to be submitted to the Department of Justice annually.\n\n&gt; The more immediate penalty is if a man fails to register before turning 26 years old, even if he is not tried or prosecuted, he may find that some doors are permanently closed.\n\n---\n\nGiven that the SSS exists in order to provide manpower for the military via a draft, that[ a draft is definitionally non-voluntary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/draft), and that failure to comply with the SSS's mandate is a felony offense, is the SSS's claim that participation in its program is 'voluntary' accurate?\n\nAnother question: Given that the SSS still runs its mandate, is it accurate to say that the US has an 'all-volunteer' force when all men must still sign up for draft eligibility?  What effect does this have on [draft-induced 'volunteering'](https://books.google.com/books?id=CnfTyMEAb00C&amp;pg=PA112&amp;lpg=PA112&amp;dq=draft-induced+volunteering&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1wFyaS-43t&amp;sig=-C_K65ItCooYhS0bigqGbq4ykW0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjy0MW7i4PXAhUrjFQKHZEtDcoQ6AEIVjAH#v=onepage&amp;q=draft-induced%20volunteering&amp;f=false), a phenomenon noted while the US was actively conscripting for various wars?\n\n---\n\n[This article from WP provides some perspective:](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp/2014/10/16/america-may-never-have-a-draft-again-but-were-still-punishing-low-income-men-for-not-registering/?utm_term=.810df488ad68)\n\n&gt; This may be a nation with an all-volunteer military, one that ended conscription more than 40 years ago, but federal law still requires men ages 18 to 25 to register for a draft that does not exist. There are few exemptions and no second chances.\n\n&gt; The point, supporters of registration long have argued, is that ***almost-zero odds of conscription are not zero odds.***\n\n&gt;“You can never say never,” says Lawrence G. Romo,  director of the Selective Service System. “We are a deterrent. We want to make sure our adversaries understand that if we had an extreme national emergency, we would have the draft.”\n\nI suppose another question stemming from this WP article is whether or not the US actually ended conscription 40 years ago if the SSS's mandate is still valid?",

I can't find anything credible supporting the \nanti-Isreael bias cited in the first link aside from the admittance of Palestine in 2011 cited below.\n\nIn the wiki I found this:\n&gt; In 2011, Palestine became a UNESCO member following a vote in which 107 member states supported and 14 opposed.[39][40] Laws passed in the United States in 1990 and 1994 mean that it cannot contribute financially to any UN organisation that accepts Palestine as a full member.[41] As a result, it withdrew its funding which accounted for about 22% of UNESCO's budget.[42] Israel also reacted to Palestine's admittance to UNESCO by freezing Israel payments to the UNESCO and imposing sanctions to the Palestinian Authority,[43] claiming that Palestine's admittance would be detrimental \"to potential peace talks\".[44] Two years after they stopped paying their dues to UNESCO, US and Israel lost UNESCO voting rights in 2013 without losing the right to be elected (as a consequence, US was elected as a member of the Executive Board for the period 2016-2019).[45]\n\nThis appears to indicate that the US had already pulled funding from UNESCO during the Obama administration and lost voting rights.\n\nWhat does it mean to pull out completely now and what will this directly affect?",
