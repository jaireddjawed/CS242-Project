However it's only about 3 pounds, 1' x 6\".  I know the recipe says you can halve a 12lb belly, but can you quarter the size with good results? Would it affect the rolling, or result in losing too many juices and drying out? Has anyone tried?\n\nIf the answer is \"don't do it\"... Any suggestions on how to make the best of a 3lb pork belly?\n\nAny suggestions would be appreciated! \n\nCheers! :) ",

        "text": "Both times I've attempted this, something doesn't seem right with the dough. After kneading, the dough doesn't have hardly any elasticity, but I can't really tell if I'm overkneading or underkneading (looking up symptoms sounds the same, dough that breaks apart easily).\n\nI'm using a Kitchenaid Pro with the dough hook, so *lack* of power shouldn't be an issue. I always measure by weight whenever it's given. The first time, I just let it run for 20 min on \"2\" (the highest the manual suggests with dough), after which it didn't look quite so smooth or as elastic as the recipe recommends, but I was pressed for time, so I went with it. They turned out alright regardless.\n\nThe second time, I adhered much closer to the temps than before. I brought the melted butter up to 80* *after* mixing in the whole milk/ full-fat yogurt. She suggests a kitchen at 70*, but I feel like a thermostat at 70 in July would set off the spidey-sense of every father in America, so I settled for 74. \n\nI kneaded this batch at the lowest speed for 20 min, but it tore apart even more easily than before. I let it go another 5 min at the higher speed, but it didn't look much different. I took it out to knead some by hand, and it seemed to get *worse*. At that point I let it rise, after which it looked like [this](https://imgur.com/a/PrfDtgu). I feel like it's probably underkneaded, but regardless, next time I'll be checking more frequently, but I'm not sure where else to go from there. \n\nAny other suggestions to tell whether I've gone too far, or not far enough?\n\n\nAlso, would baking these in a toaster oven be a terrible idea? I'm bringing them to work, but don't really want to wake up an hour early just to bake them at home.",

Fast forward to me pulling this fucker out 3 hours later, and it’s as if the pork was boiled. It’s rubbery, the fat didn’t render, its flavorless, and worst of all- you can’t shred it. I figured I could douse this disappointment in enough sour cream to make it slightly better, but the texture of the meat won’t even allow for that.

        "text": "I’ve been making Kenji’s smashed burger recipe on my cast iron skillet. The burgers are fine but there is one thing which keeps bothering me: the burgers don’t stick to the skillet at all. To put it another way, I don’t have to scrape them off the skillet. \n\nYouTube is many smash burger recipes and all of them have to scrape off the seared burger. I’ve some variations such as adding a bit of oil, not adding it, trying patties of different sizes, applying various amounts of force when smashing it, etc.\n\nI have a laser thermometer and the temp on my skillet is usually in the 400-450 F range. In a similar question here, Kenji answered that 600 degrees was acceptable. Is my temp just too low? I would have to wait a while for the temp to get that high.\n\nIn that post Kenji also mentioned that he doesn’t add surface temps to his recipes due to different pan types. I think it will be very helpful to have a supplement to Kenji’s book which did include that info for two or three pan types (or the temp for the recommended pan type). It could be from Kenji or from experts in this subreddit :)\n",

Two weeks ago I made [Kenji's Black Beans with Chorizo](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/10/quick-and-easy-pressure-cooker-black-bean-chorizo-recipe.html). Simple, easy, and packed with fatty flavor. Lots of farts too.\n\n\nThis weekend I went out shopping for ingredients to make [Daniel Gritzer's Black Bean Soup With Sausage and Cumin-Lime Sour Cream](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/03/pressure-cooker-black-bean-soup-andouille-recipe.html). When I saw my needed 8 ounces (225g) cremini mushrooms, I was shocked at the price per pound. There was only one box of 6 oz of Cremini mushrooms for over $8 a lb. However, there were multiple larger boxes of Baby Bella mushrooms for cheaper. And they looked the same. To my surprise they are! So I picked up a large box of Baby Bellas for around $2 a lb and now have a lot of mushrooms to use.\n\n\n&gt; Botanically, there is not a difference between portabello and crimini mushrooms‚ and baby bella is just another name for criminis. But in the marketplace, you'll see a difference.\n\n\nAs we go hunting for ingredients, it's always good to be aware of where to get the best deals - if I want Scallions I'll go to a Korean grocery store - Dates or Spices? Indian - Canned tomatoes? American - Fresh herbs? That Chinese grocery store across the way. Knowing different ingredient names are also part of that. Just thought I'd share being part of the daily 10,000. Happy cooking!",

After the first batch I though my oil might have been old so I used a different bottle. The aftertaste is sort of bitter-like, but bitter doesn't truly encapsulate it. Whatever it is, it tastes bad. Both batches are no good. Any hints, explanations, suggestions?",

        "text": "I usually avoid boneless skinless chicken breasts like the plague in favour of chicken thighs but I found some on sale and grabbed them on a whim for a quick dinner of roasted veggies and chicken.\n\nThanks to Serious Eats (both Kenji and Stella), the chicken was incredibly juicy, tender and delicious - with only salt!\n\n- Pounded the chicken breasts to a more even thickness then liberally seasoned both sides (about 1/2 tbsp salt per side) with kosher salt and dry-brined uncovered in the fridge for 2 hours.\n\n- Patted breasts dry then seared them over high heat in my cast iron pan then transferred to a sheet tray to cook in the oven at 400F. \n\n- Thanks to Stella's recommendation, I recently bought an in-oven digital thermometer with a temperature timer. I stuck the thermometer in the thickest breast and set the timer to 150F (Kenji's recommended breast temperature).\n\n- Left the chicken to do its thing until the timer beeped. Turned the oven off and held the temperature for a couple minutes then removed the chicken, rested for 10 minutes, then sliced against the grain and served with roasted veggies.\n\nMy husband, (who I call the \"sauce boss\" for his affinity for drowning his food in sauces) took one bite of the chicken and didn't even bother with his sauces.\n\nChicken breast. Salt. That's it.\n\nThank you Serious Eats for making boring boneless skinless chicken breasts taste awesome.\n\n**Edit:** Made some of the instructions more clear. :)",

Any ideas? They're grilling an entree, so nothing too...entree-like. I have to drive it about 40 minutes to get there, if that makes a difference. Thanks!",

What a time/effort payoff! I kept the original pretty close to the recipe, just upping the mustard, as I was making for chicken salad. \n\nWhat’s next—what are your secrets for amping up the fatty heaven that is my newfound love? Sriracha? Curry? Peanut butter and jam? I’m open to creativity! When do you add in the extras—pre or post blend? \n\n[Two-Minute Homemade Mayonnaise ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.seriouseats.com/amp/recipes/2011/10/two-minute-mayonnaise.html)",
