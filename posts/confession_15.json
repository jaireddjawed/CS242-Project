        "text": "Im 16 years old and was always told that I was a great driver. Two days ago when I was trying to leave work I hit the rear end of a truck in the parking lot. Not too make any excuses, but rather to explain the context, where I work the parking lot is very tight. I had a long shift and was eager to get home and enjoy the rest of my Sunday. I had got out of the parking spot, but went the wrong way and got to a do not enter sign. As I was already frustrated I got even more frustrated. I had basically started a K-turn to try and turn around and go the other way. I wasn’t paying attention and on my passenger side bumper I hit the rear end of a parked truck. When I backed up I saw there wasn’t any structural damage to the truck, so out of a moment of stupidity I just drove off. When I got home I checked the damage to my car and it wasn’t horrible. I told my parents that I had hit an extension of the garage (which was believable because my dad had done the same thing before) my parents were not mad and kind of just laughed it off. My dad was able to get the dent out and just a few scratches were left. Now I sit here unable to sleep with the guilt settling in. The moment keeps replaying in my head and I literally cannot sleep. I keep thinking to myself if I actually did damage the truck and just didn’t notice. I work on again on Thursday and I’m scared to death that the owner of the truck reported it and told the restaurant I work at. There is definitely a camera that could have saw it. This morning driving to school I literally could not stay focused as the crash was all I was thinking about. I don’t know what to do",

        "text": "All my life I've been hated. People say to be kind, that what goes around comes around, and if I am kind they will be kind back. That never changes though. People hate me, and honestly? They are right, only they are so wrong. They are right I am horrible, but their reason are all the wrong ones. My views have always been strange, and no one has ever actually taken the time to listen to them in full and think about them before speaking out. But why am I the bad guy? I suppose it's my views. To me, when someone is rude and cruel to you, you beat them back hard enough that the roles are reversed, that when you are bullied, you become the bully. I always hated humans, always, and religion is one of the main reasons. There are hundreds of reasons, almost all of them slipping my mind since I could right multiple paragraphs about each. Simply too much for my mind to handle. I am constantly insulted, and I insult back, even though I know it won't bring me anywhere. I guess the reason I do it is the same reason as to why villains are the way they are. People always say it's stupid that villains monologue, that they allow someone to live even though they'll clearly jeopardize their plans. But the truth is, their end goal is just what they want the world to be, and not the actual revenge, not what they are seeking. What a villain really wants — and is the main reason why they almost always win in the end — is because they want suffering. That is revenge, to make everyone suffer. Killing them is not good enough, they need to feel pain without end, a living hell. Black Ops 2 showed it best, explaining it all in one line from CoD's best villain: Menendez, \"You suffer with me.\" \"When you see this pendulum again, your life will be consumed with absolute loss. Only then will you understand what you have done to me.\" Menendez purposefully made it so that Woods would shoot his best friend, and purposefully had Hudson choose if he, Woods, or David would die. It all leads back to that one line, \"You suffer with me.\" I just want others to suffer, and I have. I am a horrible person, and while everyone sees it, they all see it for the wrong reasons. My views on things are never black and white, but for people of you aren't good, then you're evil. I guess they're right. Sometimes I purposefully do tiny little things that will lead to someone that I hate having their day ruined. People say being nice is the best way, and I've felt what it's like to be nice, but I've never felt something as good as the suffering of others.",

My classmates bashed me for it because I was apparently so “mean”. \n\nFor a while he kept bothering me and I kept telling him I wasn’t ready for any type of relationship nor did I feel anything for him. It got to the point where I just had to ignore him so he would stop, but he wouldn’t. The past few days during lunch he gets up out of his seat, and walks to where I’m sitting just to yell at me. One thing that really caught me off guard was him saying “what the F**k is wrong with you?!” I had already been having an awful week considering some family issues, and he hits me with this. I continue to stay calm and polite and explain why I’m ignoring him and why I wouldn’t like to talk to him. He won’t listen to these reasons, and keeps repeating his “what the f**k is wrong with you” or “why are you ignoring me” All the teachers and students alike pity his cancer, and when he does something bad at school they use his cancer to justify it. I don’t know how to escape??",

I truly didn’t think it was an issue and I’m surprised I had access to peoples files in the first place being a student on work experience. I won’t divulge what I saw on those files but I’ve never forgotten about this and I feel bad that I knew things about people that probably wouldn’t have told me their medical issues. \n\nAnyways curiosity isn’t always a good thing.",

I got on my phone and I googled how to pray, and then I sat at the edge of my bed and prayed to God, begging him to give me cancer, or have something happen to me that would increase my chances of getting it. I also googled how to increase my chances of getting cancer, so that I could make it more likely myself too. I never told anyone about my plan but I tried very hard.

Donations in coins were considered positive points, and dollar bills were negative points. Obviously, it was encouraged to raise as much money as possible, but the goal was to keep your class's collection all coins with no bills. But it was encouraged to secretly put bills in other class's collection to lower their overall points. Whichever home room class had the most points at the end would get ice cream with lunch for a week. So, in order for my home room to win, I would put $5 into each home room class on the first day, except mine. The funny thing is, every year I was awarded for making the most donations than any student. Thankfully, getting the award was in private instead of in front of all of my classmates, because they would have probably killed me. 😅",

Generally male characters act like complete creeps or jackasses to women and they fall for them because the plot demands it. Magic Mike has realistic scenes of adult humans flirting. People talk about their emotions like adults and despite the smutty content, the men treat the women with respect. It's also like a real period piece. The film follows some washed up frat bros through their quarter life crisis while they come to terms that they probably aren't going to be able to coast by on looks their entire lives. Also, the films are pretty hilarious\n\nI know i'm about to get called gay though and that's okay, haha",

        "text": "When I was younger, my parents took me to Mexico to visit my Aunt and Uncle. There was a corner store across the street from their house, which was always bustling with customers. One day, while exploring the store, I saw a slot machine tucked away in the corner. It was the first time I had ever seen one, and I was curious to try it out.\n\nI begged my parents for some spare change, and they gave me a few pesos to play. I quickly got sucked into the excitement of the machine, and before I knew it, I had lost all of my money. Disappointed, I wandered back to my Aunt and Uncle's house, hoping to find something else to do.\n\nAs I walked into the kitchen, I noticed a utility bill on the table with some cash on top of it. It was money that my Aunt and Uncle were about to send out to pay their bills. Seeing the money, a plan formed in my head. I would take the money and play the slot machine again. Maybe this time, I would win big. \n\nI grabbed the money and ran back to the store. I put the cash into the machine and started playing. It seemed like I was losing again, but then, all of a sudden, the machine started flashing and making noise. I had won the jackpot!\n\nA few hours later my aunt asked me if I had seen the money but I denied it. I knew I had done something wrong, but I couldn't bring myself to admit it. It was a mistake that haunted me for a long time afterward, and to this day I have not admitted it.",
