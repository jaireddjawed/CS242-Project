It's quite a huge text, but I think it's worth to read, and I thought maybe some people here would be interested. The text was not originally written in English, it was translated to it afterwards, so I apologize for any grammar mistake, or anything that might have got lost in translation.\n\nBasically, I argue that with an AI, making art will get a lot easier. I mean, imagine if making an \"Avatar\" movie was as cheap as writen a fanfic. Imagine if we have machines capable of dubbing movies in a new language, imagine if we have machine capable to convert any content to 8k, imagine if we have a machine capable of creating new episodes of ____ (insert here your most loved TV show that got canceled), and so on...\n\nImagine if making art was easier. If everything you needed was the idea, and the machine did the rest? That's basically the idea of my text.\n\nThe name is \"The Automation of the 'Technical' Part of Art: The Use of Artificial Intelligence in The Artistic Creation\"\nHere is the link, and I would love to know your guys opinion:\n\nhttps://estranhosidade.wordpress.com/2016/02/20/the-automation-of-the-technical-part-of-art-the-use-of-artificial-intelligence-in-the-artistic-creation/",
