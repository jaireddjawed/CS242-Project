        "text": "So, in case people here don't know, there's this \"\"\"documentary\"\"\" television series called [Greatest Tank Battles,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_Tank_Battles) which is essentially a Wehraboo wankfest. Every fucking episode has an overwhelming majority of its time devoted to anecdotal evidence by soldiers, with a small percentage actually being devoted to discuss the strategic implications of the offensives conducted by each side. Keeping that in mind, I present to you [this colossal piece of shit.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss83GuXt_u0) Don your biohazard suits and enter into the realm of Wehraboo wankery with me, comrades.   \n\n00:17-- \"The Soviets unleash wave after wave of tanks on the beleaguered Germans.\" Okay so, before we start, I'd like to remind those who don't know that this is a typical Wehraboo wankpoint; claim that the Soviets won through sheer force of numbers, and that was all there was to it, aka the myth of the \"Asiatic hordes\", which is basically reminiscent of [Nazi propaganda,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crimes_of_the_Wehrmacht#Evolving_analysis) used to excuse Wehrmacht war crimes:\n\n&gt;[...]Operation Barbarossa was as Hitler claimed a \"preventive war\", which meant that for Nolte, Wehrmacht war crimes were portrayed as a defensive response to the threat posed to Germany by the \"Asiatic hordes\".\n\nThe entire \"Asiatic hordes\" myth was, of course, bullshit. The execution of Red Army soldiers for retreating was [far rarer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1d589e/did_the_red_army_use_barrier_battalions_post_wwii/c9n1wsr/) than many like to think, and the key to Red Army success was often [outnumbering the enemy at the local level](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I98P1AxQRUM&amp;t=33m29s) rather than on the entire front for an effective, concentrated attack, as was done during, say, [Operation Bagration,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Bagration) a masterpiece of deception in which the Red Army [successfully fooled the Nazis into believing that they would attack Army Group South instead of Army Group Center,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Bagration#Strategic_aims_and_deception) thoroughly exploiting Hitler's paranoia over Romanian oil.   \n\nIt is also worthwhile to note that even during late 1943-1944, the Red Army faced acute manpower shortages and could not afford to lose its soldiers in \"human wave attacks.\" They would have to utilize deception and quick neutralization of the enemy. Quoting Glantz:   \n\n**Regarding late 1943 onwards:**\n\n&gt;[...] it is worth recalling that the Soviets, like the Germans, suffered from severe manpower shortages. The staggering civilian and military casualties of the war, the large factories needed to maintain weapons production, and the demands of rebuilding the shattered lands reclaimed from the Germans all strained the supposedly inexhaustible supply of Soviet manpower. The manpower needed to build new mechanized and artillery units could come only by reducing the number of replacements provided to rifle units. Moreover, because the Soviets were almost continuously on the offensive, they inevitably suffered heavier casualties at the tactical level than the German defenders.\n\n**Regarding Spring 1944:**\n&gt;The basic problem was that, even at this late stage in the war, the Red Army\nforces opposite Army Group Center were still too weak to ensure a crushing\nnumerical superiority. When the Stavka first began to plan the battle, it estimated,\novercautiously, that there were 42 German divisions, totaling 850,000\nmen, opposite the approximately 1 million men in 77 divisions and 5 mobile\ncorps of the 1st Baltic and 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Belorussian Fronts. To achieve a\nsufficient numerical advantage, the Soviet forces opposite Army Group Center\nsoon received reinforcements totaling 5 combined-arms armies, 2 tank\narmies, 1 air army, 1 Polish field army, and 11 mobile corps—over 400,000\nadditional men. The plans also focused on deception campaigns and emphasized\ndestroying the forward German forces as rapidly as possible.^^[1]\n\nClear with that? Good, because the myth of \"human waves\" is going to be repeated *ad nauseam* in this farce of a documentary.  \n\n00:30--\"We have to stop them, because it's gonna be worse if they take over Germany.\"\n\nOh, you mean like how Germany attempted to take over the Soviet Union and killed millions of Slavs, Jews and Roma people? I'm pretty sure things can't get worse than fucking genocide. I guess I can't expect better from an asshole who literally served in the Nazi army.  \n\n2:09--Another main point you should notice is that these fuckers have only interviewed a handful of former Red Army soldiers, and absolutely no Russian academics. The overwhelming majority of interviews are conducted with former German soldiers and German/Finnish academics. Furthermore, the personal anecdotes of the German soldiers are discussed in great detail (most of which end up being battles which the German soldiers win, curiously enough), while the Red army soldiers make all sorts of generic statements like \"this was the turning point of the war\", \"we kept hammering at them until they died\", etc. etc. In other words, the interviews are incredibly biased and designed to show the Nazis in a favorable light, as the soldiers who desperately struggled to save themselves against ruthless \"Asiatic hordes.\"\n\n2:17--The offensive they're discussing is the [\"Leningrad–Novgorod Offensive\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leningrad%E2%80%93Novgorod_Offensive) conducted in January 1944. You'd think that the fuckers would at least have the decency to refer to each offensive by its proper name instead of referring to it as though it was some random mass-horde attack.   \n\n2:27--Oh FFS, the Soviets DID NOT ATTACK ALL ALONG THE EASTERN FRONT. The Leningrad-Novgorod offensive was a CONCENTRATED, WELL-THOUGHT OUT ATTACK primarily launched against Army Group North near Leningrad. It was NOT a \"human wave\" attack. The Soviets could NOT afford to merely use \"human waves\" against a well-defended enemy.   \n\n3:20--\"The Russians always formed waves of tanks[...] and sent them forward as a huge group, as a blunt instrument\"  \n\n*Sigh.* The usage of Red Army [shock troops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_troops#World_War_II) as a blunt instrument had more to it than what this dunderhead of an academic seems to suggest. They were primarily meant to outnumber and encircle the enemy at a [set of points and not along the entire battlefront.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_operation#Doctrine)\n\n&gt;The primary target [of deep operations] usually consisted of a geographical objective and the destruction of a proportion of the enemy armed forces. Usually the strategic missions of each operation were carried out by a Soviet front. The front itself usually had several shock armies attached to it, which were to converge on the target and encircle or assault it. The means of securing it was the job of the division and its tactical components, which Soviet deep battle termed the tactical mission.\n\n5:01--Aaaand they've done it. Instead of discussing the strategic consequences of the encirclement at Narva, they digress and talk about an engagement of 2 Stugs against 10 T-34s, in which the 2 Stugs miraculously win (which BTW, could quite possibly be an exaggeration). Quite the documentary they have right there!   \n\n8:43--\"The Germans, desperate to stop the swarming T-34s\" Just a reminder, they haven't stopped with the \"human wave attacks\" yet.  \n\n8:50--Oh geez, they're going to talk about the Tiger. No way this isn't going to devolve into a Wehraboo circlejerk, nope!  \n\n12:51--\"Swarms of T-34s\" Holy fuck why won't this shit just die?  \n\n13:00--Using the word \"deadliest\" to refer to the Tiger I tank? Check. Indeed, a tank so deadly that [only 1347](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_I) were ever produced, ~~most~~ a large number of them being incapacitated due to maintenance and reliability issues.   \n\nEdit: Okay, so I'll some more context. For one, the fact that only 1347 Tigers were ever produced was a serious handicap, because in contrast, the Soviet Union produced 3,854 IS-2s and 2,311 IS-3s, and the British produced 7,368 heavy Churchill tanks, far more than both the Tiger I and its successor, the Tiger II combined. The United States produced 2,212 M26 Pershings, a tank that was comparable to the Tiger. The Tiger simply could not be produced in enough numbers to be an effective game-changer on any of the fronts. Also, since I have no statistics to back it up, I will not claim that most Tigers were incapacitated due to maintenance and reliability issues, though I am fairly sure that such an assertion is correct.     \n\n13:15--\"All but imprevious to T-34 fire\" That is, until you hit it in the side.\n\n&gt;[When firing APCR shells, [the 76 mm gun] could pierce 92 mm of armour at 500 m.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-34#Firepower)\n\nThat's easily enough to penetrate the side armor of the Tiger tank at that range. Furthermore, when you take into consideration that an 85 mm variant was also produced,\n\n&gt;The 85 mm gun could penetrate the turret front of a Tiger I tank from 500 m (550 yd) and the driver's front plate from 300 m (330 yd) at the side angle of 30 degrees\n\nNot so impervious anymore, huh?\n\n14:23--Okay, so the T-34, like an idiot, literally circles around the Tiger, exposing itself to enemy fire, not taking the opportunity to hit it in the vulnerable rear when it can, and gets hit. Whuda thunk that idiotic tactics lead to your tank getting knocked out???   \n\n19:27--Ya'know, the June 1944 offensive had a fucking name. It wouldn't hurt to call it \"Operation Bagration\" instead of referring to it as though it was just another wave of offensive attacks.   \n\nThe rest of the documentary is mostly just a bunch of anecdotes after this. I'll just head over to the last part of it now.\n\n39:51--Hitler was not \"spared another Stalingrad\" by the encirclement at Riga. [Regardless of initial breakthroughs,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Doppelkopf) much of Army Group North was still encircled within the Courland Pocket, and ultimately up to [180,000 soldiers surrendered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courland_Pocket#Surrender_of_Army_Group_Courland) by the end of the war, almost twice as many soldiers that surrendered at the Battle of Stalingrad.  \n\n[1]: Glantz, D.

        "text": "&gt; It was definitely a war of secession, a successful real revolution doesn't end with the same people in charge - I'm pretty sure most of the American founding fathers were colonial governors appointed by the British Crown.\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/FULLCOMMUNISM/comments/5l0c1n/bootlicking_in_colonial_times/dbsgr0t/\n\nNeedless to say, this is complete and utter bullshit. Let's look at each colonial governor prior to the revolution and see how the revolution affected them.\n\n* Province of New Hampshire - John Wentworth. Fled a Patriot lynch mob to Boston, then was evacuated from there to Halifax.\n\n* Province of Massachusetts Bay - Thomas Gage. Enforced the Intolerable Acts, and once the revolution started commanded British troops at Bunker Hill and was recalled to Britain afterwards.\n\n* Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations - Nicholas Cooke. This is a bit more complicated situation, because Cooke was a Patriot and remained a public figure after the revolution. However, Rhode Island elected their governors. Indeed, Nicholas Cooke was selected by the General Assembly for the express purpose of rebelling. The previous governor, Joseph Wanton, was forced into retirement for his refusal to build up the colony's militia to participate in the upcoming revolution. The first acts of the Cooke administration were to move the capital from undefended Newport to Providence in preparation for war with Britain. Either way, neither of them were appointed by the Crown.\n\n* Connecticut Colony - John Trumbull. This is much the same situation as Rhode Island; the governor was both elected and a Patriot.\n\n* Province of New York - William Tryon. He was chased out of New York by the Patriots, was appointed a general on the British side during the ARW, and tried to have George Washington killed. In 1780 he went back to England, and he never set foot in the USA.\n\n* Province of New Jersey - William Franklin. Despite being the son of prominent Patriot Benjamin Franklin, William was a staunch loyalist. After January 1776, he was imprisoned by the Provincial Congress for his loyalist sympathies. In 1780, he left to England and did not return.\n\n* Province of Pennsylvania - John Penn. Throughout the war he tried to stay neutral and not take sides. In 1776, the Provincial Assembly wrote a new constitution that stripped him of his power. From 1777 to 1778, he was held under house arrest by the Patriots. In 1779 he was forced to swear an oath of loyalty to the new Commonwealth and large amounts of his property (he owned a great deal of the colony since his family founded it) were nationalized. He retired and did not participate in politics until his death in 1795.\n\n* Delaware Colony - John Penn. See Province of Pennsylvania\n\n* Province of Maryland - Robert Eden, 1st Baronet of Maryland. Although he was also a Loyalist, he was very popular and in 1776 he was politely requested to leave the colony, which he did. He eventually returned, but did not participate in politics and died in 1784.\n\n* Colony of Virginia - John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore. Served as a British general, and fought a brutal guerilla war with the Patriots. George Washington said of him, \"Nothing less than depriving him of life or liberty will secure peace to Virginia, as motives of resentment actuate his conduct to a degree equal to the total destruction of that colony.\" He eventually retreated to Britain and was appointed as colonial governor of the Bahamas.\n\n* Province of North Carolina - Josiah Martin. Was forced to flee the province in 1775 by a Patriot mob. Died in England in 1786.\n\n* Province of South Carolina - Lord William Campbell. He fled the province in 1775, and returned to England. In the battle of Fort Moultrie, he was fatally wounded by a splinter aboard the HMS Bristol.\n\n* Province of Georgia - James Wright. He fled the province in 1776, and set up a new administration in 1778 following the British capture of Savannah. In 1782, he fled once more to England, where he died. His extensive properties were nationalized by Georgia and South Carolina.\n\nSo, out of 12 colonial governors, 2 (both of whom were elected) continued their political careers in the USA, 2 had their political careers ended by the revolution but stayed in America, 7 fled to England, and one was killed by Patriots.",

        "title": "\"How Christianity Retarded Modern Society by 1500 Years\" - Again",
        "author": "TimONeill",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/5l7419/how_christianity_retarded_modern_society_by_1500/",
        "text": "New Atheist bad history time again.  Bob Seidensticker of the blog [Cross Examined](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/crossexamined/) (\"Clear Thinking About Christianity\" apparently) wrote a post back in April entitled [\"How Christianity Retarded Modern Society by 1500 Years\"](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/crossexamined/2016/04/how-christianity-retarded-modern-society-by-1500-years/).  It's an oddly meandering piece that, for a posting with that title, really goes to little effort to actually make the case it claims.\n\n\nFirst it talks about Hero of Alexandria's little steam toy, but admits that it amounted to nothing much. Then it attributes this dead end to slavery, rather than Christianity. Which makes sense given that Hero's toy was a good three hundred years before Christianity was in a position to \"retard\" technology in any way.\n\n\nThe article then meanders around for a few more paragraphs, talking about looms and the Industrial Revolution and slavery, before we get to at least something like an argument about Christianity retarding technology:\n\n\n&gt;\"Christian Europe didn’t nurture innovation. Yes, there was some during the medieval period (eyeglasses, water wheels, the stirrup, metal armor, gunpowder weapons, castles, improved plows, crop rotation, and others), but that was in spite of Christianity, not because of it.\"\n\n\nWe could actually add quite a few items that to grudging list, like vertical windmills, a vast expansion of water-powered mechanisation, tidal mills, mechanical trip hammers, blast furnaces, stern rudders, weight driven clocks, metal rolling mills, tredle-operated vertical looms, steel span crossbows and the printing press. To which we could also add artesian drilling, chimneys, treadmill cranes, harbour cranes, floating cranes, mast cranes, oil paints, the hourglass, the compound crank, waterpowered paper mills, the dry compass, the astronomical compass, the nocturnal, the albion and the altitudinal dial.  For a period in which Christianity was apparently \"retarding\" technology, they sure did manage to come up with a lot of innovation.\n\n\nBut how exactly was all this innovation happening \"despite Christianity\"? The article doesn't explain. Except the bald assertion that \"Christian Europe was ruled by superstition, not reason.\" Exactly how this stopped people from innovating I have no idea.  Or what the Church supposedly did to stifle innovation is also not explained.  If the Church was sending the Inquisition to ban artesian drilling, burn vertical windmills and rip out stern rudders for being insufficiently superstitious, this not only happened without anyone recording it anywhere and it was clearly ineffective judging by the list above.\n\n\nWhen queried on this in the comments section, the author - who is a \"hardware designer and software programmer\", so the *obvious* go-to guy on medieval history - came up with a classic example of *post hoc ergo propter hoc*: \"the previous 1500 years ....  when Christianity was largely in charge (saw) the merest trickle of scientific and technological progress\".  So therefore, you know, it was the Church.  Or something.  \n\n\nWhen alerted to the fact that this was the period of the total collapse of the Western Roman Empire and the former long-distance trade based economy of the western Mediterranean and western Europe, with its attendant collapse of civilisation, loss of technology and almost complete decline of learning, Bob didn't seem to think this could be the problem.  \"There were no European wars after 1800? No ebb and flow of people fleeing bad conditions?  Britain kicked Napoleon’s ass and nurtured the Industrial Revolution.\" Apparently the Napoleonic Wars were the equivalent of the collapse of the WRE - not fun, but hardly enough reason not to invent steam engines.  No, it had to be the Church.\n\n\nSome of Bob's minions then chime in with comments that descend into a dizzying spiral of stupidity, with one claiming the Roman Empire's collapse wasn't catastrophic at all and another repeatedly challenging me to \"prove it WASN'T the Church, so there!\"\n\n\nThe usual litany then ensues in the comments, which are ongoing: the Antikythera mechanism, Galileo, Richard Carrier etc.  Giordano Bruno and the Archimedes Palimpsest haven't been invoked yet, but give it time\n\n\nDespite repeated challenges, neither Bob nor his minions can explain exactly HOW the Church did this suppressing.  Occult powers perhaps.  Nor can they explain why the examples of innovations that Bob grudgingly admits (and the dozens of others he seems unaware of) mainly happened at the end of the medieval period; in other words, when the impact of the collapse of Rome was over but the power, influence and authority of the Church was at its highest.  This is the exact opposite of what we'd expect if \"the Church dun it\", but despite repeated requests, Bob and Co. have not been able to explain this at all.\n\n\nFor those interested in why this stuff is ridiculous:\n\n*[Wiki - Medieval Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_technology)\n*[Paul Gans' Medieval Technology Timeline](http://scholar.chem.nyu.edu/tekpages/Timeline.html)\n*[Badhistory FAQ link on the Church not causing the \"Dark Ages\" 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1vcffo/badhistory_of_christianity_part_3_the_christian/)\n*[Badhistory FAQ link on the Church not causing the \"Dark Ages\" 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1pxjia/a_til_about_erastosthenes_provokes_some/)",

        "text": "Honestly with all the posts on if Jesus existed, Christmas bad history and the rest, I felt that Chanukah was largely left out. So here are the common cases of Chanukah bad history that I could find. Also this is my first post so please don't break my oil and desecrate my temple. \n\n**1) Who are the villains of the Chanukah story?**\n\nWell this is the one that is probably most commonly mistaken as it falls for the 'Ancient Grome' issue. People who are a bit wonky on their ancient history often claim it was one of these three: The Romans, Alexander the Great or The King of the Greeks. All of which are wrong, some to a greater extent than others of course. \n\nWell who did the Maccabees fight? Well the answer is the Seleucids, who were Hellenistic, in particular Antiochus IV. So let's break down how those previous three were off:\n\n*Rome:*\nWell firstly the Romans were a Republic at this point and had hardly even reached mainland Greece let alone Judea and Palestine (as in the geography). Secondly The Republic only gets in that region at the time of Pompeius Magnus who gets control through a conflict of power between, you guessed it, two heirs of the Maccabees. \n\n*Alexander the Great:*\nWell this one is pretty easy and I put it as bad knowledge of Greek history in it of itself. Alexander died in 323 BCE whilst the events of Chanukah occurred in around 170 BCE, a good 150 year gap. However now that I think about it if it were Alexander, the Maccabees probably would've lost. ^(Alexander too OP plz nerf)\n\n*The King of the Greeks:*\nOnce again this boils down to a bad understanding of the Greeks/Hellens. Antiochus IV was a Greek King but not King of the Greeks. Although the Seleucids at the time had the most land out of the other post-Alexander kingdoms they were still yet another Hellenistic kingdom in the region vying for dominance and didn't in fact control the entire Greek peoples.\n\nAlso a bit of a side note but really the villain of Chanukah weren't the Seleucids per se but rather Antiochus IV, which many sources claim to be brutal to his subjects and of course the Jews. Take Antiochus III (the Great), Antiochus IV's father, who took the lands of Judea from the Ptolemaic kingdom. He, according to Josephus, was a kind ruler to the Jews of the region and preached tolerance of their customs. \n\n**2) The miracle of Chanukah.**\n\nReally this is more badbiblicalhistory but from what I've read most agree that the Chanukah story did occur with the Maccabees against the Seleucids so I'm putting this in as badhistory too. Well if you ask any average Joseph Jew they'll probably tell you that the true miracle of Chanukah was the ability of the oil to last for eight days when it was only enough for one. However the actual Chanukah miracle was in fact the victory of the Maccabees over the Seleucids against overwhelming odds. Now it might be fair to get the idea of the miracle being about the eight day oil from the details given by Josephus who calls it \"The festival of the lights\", an eight day long festival where candles are lit. But Josephus claims that the candles are lit for eight days to remember the restoration of the second Beis HaMikdash (Temple) and that the festival was largely held as propaganda for the Maccabean dynasty that ruled Israel. This is affirmed in the two other main sources of the event, Maccabees I and Maccabees II in the New Testament, which lacks any mention of the eight day long candles. It does however, like Josephus says, very much endorses the Maccabean revolt hence why it was not added to the Tanach by the Sanhedrin as they thought it endorsed rebellion from the status quo too much as to threaten their authority. \n\nThen where did this idea of an eight day Menorah miracle come from? Well there are only two sources for it: Megillat Antiochus and a small footnote in the Babylonian Talmud. The first text, Megillat Antiochus, is a non-contemporary piece on the Maccabean revolt written in the 2nd Century CE. The Megilla was originally written in Aramaic then translated literally into Herbrew, where-in that translation was used for other languages. The Megilla refers to the miracle only in its conclusion and as the purpose of the holiday, however being a source that is over 4 hundred years after the events it describes it is likely that this is merely a misunderstanding/fantastic retelling of the reason for the length of the holiday. The eight day origin comes from the 7 day long purity transition in Jewish tradition after battle and the insufficient amount of oil for the 7 days (they lit a Menorah not a Chanukiah) that required them to be pure then make another batch of oil (hence the 8 days). This Megilla became a very common and widespread text in Jewish communities in the 1500's, likely the source of its popularity. \n\nThe second source is from the Babylonian Talmud which became a significant Jewish text after the Roman expulsion of the Jews. In it, whilst describing the Shabbat candle lighting there is a small anecdotal footnote about the Maccabees struggle with the oil and the miracle of it lasting for 8 days. So due to the in depth study of the Talmud by the Jews for thousands of years this was taken as fact and spread the popularity of this legend. \n\n**3) The Maccabees used dreidel to hide their Torah learning.**\n\nProbably one of the more iconic things about Chanukah are the dreidels and the role they played in hiding the studies of the traditional Jews against Antiochus IV's persecution laws. However, like the miracle of the eight day oil, this seems to be a much later revision of the Maccabean story. But, again like the eight day miracle, it does have a few reasons why it is apart of the tradition of Chanukah. \n\nFirstly the dreidel itself was definitely not used by the Maccabean supporters as such a toy wasn't even present in that place or at that time in history. In fact it only came to Europe in the times of the Roman Empire, hence why it is likely the origin of the legend of their use to disguise Torah studies comes from a much later time than that of the Maccabean Revolt, Bar-Kohba War (132 - 135 CE). During the Bar-Kohna War the Romans forbade Torah learning with a punishment of death, among other things. Thus the idea of Jews hiding their Torah learning with games of dreidels might have some basis for that time period, however the dreidel wasn't a Jewish toy at this time and the non-Jewish variant, a teetotum, was a common thing across the Roman Empire. The actual Jewish-ification of the teetotum occurred much later in Ashkenazi communities were the basic rules of the game were transferred into Yiddish with: *״גאנץ״ \"whole\", ״האלב״ \"half\", ״ניט״ \"nothing\", ״שתעלו אין״ \"put in\"*. These were literal translations of the Latin and wasn't even tied into Channukah. That occurs even later on as the Yiddish variant of the teetotum is not understood by other communities, thus the letters are widely understood to mean different things, one of which was a tie to Channukah. Now because of the badhistory I just said before, the belief of the dreidel in hiding Torah learning during the tyranny of Antiochus IV, the four letters ״**נ**״(Nun) ״**ג**״ (Gimel) ״**ה**״ (Hey) ״**ש**״ (Shin) were believed to signify the miracle of the Maccabees by reading ״**נ**ס** ג**דול **ה**יה **ש**ם״ (A great miracle happened there). So really this is like a double self fulfilling badhistory with the dreidel. Anyway these reasons are also why the dreidel was not apparent in Safardi Jewish communities until after Israel was founded as a country whereupon they were adopted universally. \n\n*tl;dr The Maccabees fought the Seleucids and in particular Antiochus IV. During the revolts dreidels were not used to hide Torah learning, but that likely comes from Roman persecutions and a bunch of people not understanding Yiddish. When the Maccabees overthrew the Seleucids they did only have enough for one day but it didn't last for eight days, rather the eight day length of the holiday comes from the 7 day period of purification in Judaism and the time requirement of 1 day to make the oil afterwards. Oh and if you tell me the Maccabees didn't eat jam donuts and latkes I'll kvetch until the cows come home.*\n\nSo yeah that raps up my badhistory shpill about Channukah and the legends/miracles we are told about it. Hopefully some other Jews will no longer feel that Channukah didn't get as much love on r/badhistory as Christmas did. Anyway enjoy the holidays! ",

        "text": "Note: I am not here to discuss the ethics or morality of the nuclear bombs. \n\nSo [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/EnoughTrumpSpam/comments/5jxj4s/george_takei_on_twitter_trump_wants_to_expand_our/dbjxu7l/) we have some fanciful thinking with respect to Operation Downfall. \n\n&gt;The first estimates were that like 20,000 Americans would have died invading Japan.\n\nThere's no source to who those estimates came from, but let's take a look at some casualties [estimates](http://coachfleenor.weebly.com/uploads/6/6/7/3/6673552/no_bomb_no_end.pdf):\n\n* 514,000 (135,000 KIA/MIA) for the US Sixth Army under a Pacific Experience 90 day campaign\n* 149,000 (29,000 KIA/MIA) for the US Sixth Army under a European Experience 90 day campaign\n\nThis was not to say that the campaign would be won in 90 days, but just what the first 90 days would bring given a contingent of about three quarters of a million. Other estimates are a bit harder to parse out dead from the casualties as a dead soldier and a permanently wounded soldier are both in need of a permanent replacement. Nevertheless the casualty estimates were in the hundreds of thousands.\n\n* Maj. Gen. Willoughby had a rounded down estimate of 200,000 battle casualties and half a million total just to push to the \"stop line\" a third of the way up Kyushu\n* Lt. Gen. Somervell estimated 720,000 replacements needed for a campaign through *December 1946.* \n* Secretary of War Stimson had a staff estimate of upwards of four million casualties (of all kinds) on the US side alone.\n\nSo no, the early estimates were not painting a picture of an easy and casualty-light campaign to invade Japan. You may say \"but couldn't they have overinflated numbers to encourage dropping the nukes?\" and that is a valid concern. However, looking at the battle of Okinawa, we can get a glimpse of what was to come. That nearly three month long battle cost over 20,000 American lives with another 50,000+ wounded. If this battle, where roughly 90% of Japanese forces fought to the death, was even a remotely accurate signal to how hard fought the battle for Japan would be, then these planners were likely on the right track.\n\nSo far, this has done nothing to talk of what Japanese casualties would have been like. At the aforementioned battle, at least 77,000 Japanese soldiers died along side at least 40,000 civilians. The island prior to the war had roughly 300,000 people living on it. Another way of framing that is one American dead per 15 inhabitants, one civilian dead per 7.5 inhabitants, and one soldier dead per 4 inhabitants. This last one is likely unsustainable as you'd have to conscript one fourth of your nation, but it still paints a very deadly picture of the battle.\n\nYes, the nuclear bombings had tremendous destruction, but to suggest that the invasion of Japan would have not brought tremendous pain and suffering is both foolish and revisionist. \n\nThis was my first R5 so if there are suggestions for improvement I would be more than appreciative.",

Regardless of whether or not you think they were right in their actions, the Soviets did many things that warranted foreign ire. For example, operating spy rings in Britain, the U.S., supporting underground parties/dissidents across Europe, and *agreeing with the fucking Nazis to conquer Poland and execute 22,000 Polish military officers.* Needless to say, the Allies had good reason to hate the Soviet Union. And yes, the Allied nations did similar shit to the Soviets, they weren't blameless either, but *still*, it's a **huge** stretch to paint the Soviets as victims of warrantless hatred.\n\n&gt;other countries still refusing to trade, plotting to invade you, and start engaging you in a massive arms race against you and proxy wars all over the place\n\nI think the trade part is mostly correct, though it's worth noting that NATO and Warsaw Pact countries did conduct low-key trade during the Cold War. But yes, economic blockades against the Soviets were a thing. The rest of that line, however, is pretty off-base. Obviously there was indeed a massive arms race and dozens of proxy wars, but let's not pretend like the West started it all. Both NATO/Western countries and Warsaw Pact/Soviet-aligned countries built up their weapons technologies and conducted proxy wars. And can you really blame the West for \"engaging in a massive arms race\"? If your enemy gets stronger, you try to match his strength so you can defend yourself - or attack, if needed. The Soviets engaged in this arms race too, and that's not inherently a bad thing...I don't get why the image is trying to say it's a bad thing. And as for the proxy wars part, the Soviets also conducted proxy wars against ideologically opposed nations, many of whom committed horrible atrocities, e.g. North Vietnam, North Korea, etc. \n\nTLDR Poland, Finland, the Baltic countries, the Central Asian countries, eastern Europe in general, Mongolia, and plenty of other countries *definitely* wanted the Soviets to conquer them, USSR did nothing wrong, fuck you capitalist pigdog.\n\n#**IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS IS NOT AN ATTACK ON COMMUNISM, PLEASE DO NOT THINK IT IS. I'M SOCIALIST MYSELF, I'M JUST NOT A FAN OF, Y'KNOW, BEING SENT TO A GULAG AND GETTING WORKED TO DEATH. FURTHER, THE WESTERN NATIONS ATTACKED IN THE IMAGE ABSOLUTELY ARE GUILTY OF MANY THINGS, I'M NOT DENYING THAT; ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT THE SOVIETS DID SOME BAD THINGS TOO**\n\nAnd I'm actually quite a fan of r/FULLCOMMUNISM, plz do not send to gulag.\n\nThank.",

        "text": "*Firstly I would like to point out this is adapted from a blog post I wrote a while back, I hope this is not frowned upon (I won't link the blog, but to prove I'm not ripping it off some random blog on the internet I can provide evidence it's actually mine if asked).*\n\nAnyway. After seeing yet another post with a dangerous misconception about Anne Frank and her diary, I thought I would share this with you, my first post here.\n\nThe focus is [this graphic](http://i.imgur.com/BsCv4b5.png), which circles around less reputable parts of the internet but the myths of which I have seen elsewhere. I will also have a quick look at the other common lies, myths and misconceptions surrounding Anne and her diary.\n\nThis is bad history, because, succinctly, it is full of lies, half-truths and misconceptions - and pushes that as fact, to further an agenda (Holocaust denial).\n\nLet's take a look.\n\n&gt;In 1980, as a result of a lawsuit in a German court, the German state forensic bureau (Bundes Kriminal Amt [BKA]), forensically examined the original “diary” manuscript. The analysis determined that “significant” portions of the work was written with a fine ballpoint pen. Fine ballpoint pens were not available before 1951; portions of the work was [sic] added well after the war (Anne Frank died in March 1945).\n\nSo what’s the source for this? Of course none is provided in the image, but a search reveals it to be taken from a website that cites Ditlieb Felderer as the source.\n\n\nFelderer is an interesting character. It would be wrong to say he has been discredited as, well, he doesn’t seem to have ever been credited. His book in which he attempts to expose the diary, *Diary of Anne Frank- A Hoax*? is a bizarre, rambling and at times sickening publication that does more to probe in Felderer’s own mind than the diary itself. He goes into strange detail about Jews and sexuality. And since it was published, his claims have been discredited by actual academics. It is not, to be succinct, a valid source.\n\nBut to take on this point about the ballpoint pen anyway, as it is frequently repeated.  The BKA report – which consisted of just four pages – reported everything matter-of-factly. Yes – there were ballpoint pen markings in the diary. These had in fact been written in the 1960’s by a woman carrying out graphological investigations into it. ^[1]\n\nThe other ballpoint amendments were page numbers written onto the sheets and some minor corrections. All ballpoint amendments differ dramatically from Anne’s handwriting, as was confirmed later.  The West German police had also reported that ’emendations’ and ‘corrections’ were made to some of the pages of Anne’s diary.^[2]  This was also correct. Anne went over her own work as she believed that one day it may be published.\n\n&gt; The BKA also determined that NONE of the “diary” handwriting matched known examples of Anne’s handwriting.\n\nThe BKA report did not attempt to measure the authenticity of the diary as a whole, only if the pages were written at the time they were claimed to have been.^[3]\n\n&gt; Earlier handwriting experts had already determined ALL of the writing in the “diary” was the same hand. Hence, the “diary” was a postwar construct.\n\nIndeed, previous graphological investigators did determine all the writing was in the same hand.\n\n\nTheir investigation was in part a result of the differing handwriting like that [here](http://i.imgur.com/zlpel5a.jpg) which often excites deniers. Unsurprisingly, as was discovered, the handwriting of a teenager changes.\n\nMany false claims about the BKA report probably originate from a Der Spiegel article which used misleading language to suggest the report cast doubt upon the authenticity of the diary. It was in part these doubts that led to, in 1986, the Dutch Institute for War Documentation carrying out a full investigation into the authenticity of the diary. It found that the diary was authentic.^[3]\n\n&gt; The true author of the diary was a man, Meyer Levin. He demanded payment for his work in a court action against Anne’s father, Otto Frank. Meyer Levin was awarded $50,000 and the matter was resolved quietly.\n\nNope. After the war,  Levin was asked by Otto Frank to write a play  based on the diary, but a dispute about which direction the play should take led to a fall-out. Frank instead turned to Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett to move the play forwards. Levin sued for plagiarism from his writing, and did indeed win $50,000 – but this court decision was later reversed.^[4]\n\nSo what else is there in the way of Anne Frank denial? Well, not a lot.\n\n**The Anne Frank Foundation admitted that Otto co-authored the diary; clearly he manipulated it**\n\nThe first part is true. In 2015 there was a copyright controversy concerning the diary. The Anne Frank Foundation listed Otto Frank as a co-author.\n\nThere really isn’t much evidence that he heavily manipulated the diary.  What Otto did do was edit it substantially, as the Foundation claimed.^[5]\n\nAlso, remember that there was not one ‘diary.’ Version A is the original, the bound diary that Anne was gifted and first wrote in. In early 1944, Anne began reorganising her writings onto sheets of paper. This was in light of an announcement over radio asking for diaries after the war had ended and is referred to as B. After Anne’s death, Otto combined the two versions, removing some pages and deciding whether to include the version of events from A or B. Otto’s version is C. The removed pages were later published.\n\nThe listing of Otto as co-author will extend the copyright the Foundation has over the writing. The cynical would see this as the reason.\n\n**The writing is too mature for a young girl**\n\nAs far as I am aware, David Irving (the disgraced Holocaust denier) has only significantly written on Anne Frank once, in a letter to a student in 1986.^[6] The letter repeats in various forms the myths and lies above, but is also brings up an interesting point:\n\n&gt; ‘I was rather suspicious of the content of the Frank diary when I read excerpts… [they] struck me as written too maturely for a girl who was only about thirteen at the time.’\n\nNote that he says ‘excerpts.’ Irving admits:\n\n&gt; ‘I have never read the whole thing — life is too short for that…’\n\nThat should tell you everything, but let’s continue. Could such writings as\n\n&gt; ‘I see the world being slowly transformed into a wilderness, I hear the approaching thunder that, one day, will destroy us too, I feel the suffering of millions…’\n\nreally be the work of a young girl?\n\nWell, yes. Anne goes through quite a transformation in her writings. Take into account that her diary was one of her few joys in the annex – naturally, when writing in it so much, her writing would mature and become more complex. If one, unlike Irving, actually reads the entire diary, this becomes obvious. Anne’s earlier writings are much less mature and developed, discussing gossipy teenage girl subjects.\n\n**The diary was greatly manipulated or even written by Albert Cauvern**\n\nAlbert Cauvern was a close friend of Otto Frank. He was brought into the limelight during the trial of Lothar Stielau in 1958, who had claimed the diary was ‘fake.’ When he realised that he didn’t have much of an argument, Stielau – to much amazement – changed his argument to that the diary was ‘seriously altered.’ A significant part of this argument used an article in Der Spiegel in which Cauvern had mentioned that ‘at the beginning I made a good many changes.’ Stielau expanded by concluding that the diary had been edited by Cauvern. In reality – and in the opinion of the court – Cauvern had edited spelling and grammar mistakes, not anything else.^[7]\n\n**Where did the new pages come from?**\n\nFive new pages were added to the diary in 2001. Why had these pages not been included with the rest of the diary previously? The answer is that Otto did not want anyone to read them, as they featured some unpleasant mentions of his first wife. He therefore turned them over to his friend Cor Suyk, who gave them to the Dutch government a few years after Otto’s death.^[8] Really, why would some Jewish puppet-masters perpetuating an apparent lie be so stupid as to insert extra pages after the event?\n\n**The occupants could not have lived as they did; the diary contains ‘continuity errors’**\n\nAnne claims that ‘during the daytime we can’t make any noise that might be heard downstairs’ and that the annex has ‘thin walls.’ Robert Faurisson put great effort into taking these quotes and finding every other quote in the diary which mentions noise.\n\nFor example, at one point Mrs. van Daan uses a vacuum cleaner, which Faurisson is keen to point out would have been extraordinarily noisy. However, he ignores quotes immediately afterwards that the warehousemen had gone home.\n\nThis cherry-picking is evident throughout his work. Faurisson also writes that the use of electric lights and candles would be something that would clearly give the Franks away to neighbours. This claim is laughable: Anne explicitly mentions that they did not turn on lights in rooms that did not have curtains.^[9]\n\n\nAnyway. I hope this is an acceptable first post here, and I hope my writing on this silly subject is tolerable.

        "author": "heavypettingzoos",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/5jz9eo/yakko_warners_world_songs_conception_of_nation/",
        "text": "We are gathered here today to discuss a timeless classic of 90’s children’s weekday morning routine: Animaniac’s Yakko’s [World song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaLSUKeGWw).  The song first aired in the 1993 episode Yakko's World/Cookies For Einstein/Win Big.  Rob Paulsen voiced Yakko, Randy Rogel wrote the lyrics and adapted the music from ‘Jarabe Tapatio’, which some of us might know better as the Mexican Hat Dance. \n\nI had wished to present a more straightforward case of badhistory, but the central question to what constitutes said badhistory in this nostalgic case is as complicated.  Specifically--what constitutes a nation?  Let’s start with the opening lyric to glimpse the problem before us: \n\n          And now, the nations of the world, brought to you by Yakko Warner!\n\nA bold proclamation considering the diplomatic thorniness of exclaiming what exactly is a nation and what isn’t (for example, Taiwan is listed among the nations with China but I could find no formal protest from China lodged at Warner Brothers for this provocation).  We could do a close reading of ‘nationalism’ and its attendant theories, but we’ll assume that by ‘nation’ what Yakko Warner meant was ‘nation-state’ and, like any good historian worth his salt, ignore the overlap between theories of statehood and nationalism to keep things digestibly simple. \n\nFirst, a cursory overview of the most popular theories on what a nation-state is: \n\nThe Constitutive theory posits that a nation-state is extant if it is recognized by other states.  There was lively debate about just how many states would be needed for recognition, but then around lunchtime after a few drinks and some bad Emmentaler it was decided that the more important question was “if no states are around to recognize the first nation-state, does anyone care?”  Thus, the chicken/egg paradox of statehood was born.  \n\nThe Declaratory or Declarative theory of statehood posits that once a state becomes extant once it meets some minimal criteria of statehood.  What criteria you ask?  Defined borders, a permanent population, a functioning government, and the capacity to hold diplomatic relations with other countries.  \n\nThe last theory (for our purposes) is based on the Peace of Westphalia, signed in 1648 after the Thirty Years War.  The Westphalian system is predicated on established sovereignty over a defined territory and people with that territorial integrity being uninterrupted by outside entities. \n\nNone of these theories fully explain our international system and none are mutually exclusive.  Let’s put a country or two to the test.  \n\n1st--Canada.   In 1993 Canada gave and received recognition from the majority of declared nation-states (constitutive theory), met all of the criteria of the Declaratory theory (well, meets the criteria I listed), and had established sovereignty over defined territory and people recognized by and uninterrupted by neighboring states.  \n\n2nd--Taiwan.   In 1993, upwards of 25 countries recognized Taiwan, about ⅛ of the world’s countries.  Does this pass the Constitutive test? Seeing as none of those countries held real sway in the international order of things (countries include Malawi, Sao Tome and Principe, Bahamas, etc.) , I’d argue that it fails.  We can take this a step further and include recognition by international orders such as the UN and multiple arms, economic, and cultural unions and you’ll not find Taiwan.  Recognition--out. \n\tNow, ‘93 Taiwan does seem to pass the Declarative test--it has well defined borders, a permanent population that it governs, and as pointed out above the ability to hold diplomatic relations.  But where it falls apart, both here and in the Westphalian test, is that Taiwan’s well defined borders were contested by neighboring China, a contest that most of the rest of the world recognized to be in China’s favor.  Taiwan may have had de facto sovereignty over its proclaimed territory, but that sovereignty wasn’t recognized.  So Taiwan fails these tests too.  \n\nAlright, now that the nagging criteria is out of the way (we won’t run every mention through a full examination here) let’s get to the offending song: \n\n     United States, Canada, Mexico, Panama,\n     Haiti, Jamaica, Peru,\n     Republic Dominican, Cuba, Carribbean,\n     Greenland, El Salvador, too.\n     Puerto Rico, Colombia, Venezuela,\n     Honduras, Guyana, and still,\n     Guatemala, Bolivia, then Argentina,\n     And Ecuador, Chile, Brazil.\n     Costa Rica, Belize, Nicaragua, Bermuda,\n     Bahamas, Tobago, San Juan,\n     Paraguay, Uruguay, Suriname,\n     And French Guiana, Barbados, and Guam.\n\n     Norway, and Sweden, and Iceland, and Finland,\n     And Germany, now in one piece,\n     Switzerland, Austria, Czechoslovakia,\n     Italy, Turkey, and Greece.\n     Poland, Romania, Scotland, Albania,\n     Ireland, Russia, Oman,\n     Bulgaria, Saudi Arabia, Hungary, \n     Cyprus, Iraq, and Iran.\n     There's Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Jordan,\n     Both Yemens, Kuwait, and Bahrain,\n     The Netherlands, Luxembourg, Belgium, and Portugal,\n     France, England, Denmark, and Spain.\n     India, Pakistan, Burma, Afghanistan,\n     Thailand, Nepal, and Bhutan,\n     Kampuchea, Malaysia, then Bangladesh (Asia),\n     And China, Korea, Japan.\n     Mongolia, Laos, and Tibet, Indonesia,\n     The Philippine Islands, Taiwan,\n     Sri Lanka, New Guinea, Sumatra, New Zealand,\n     Then Borneo, and Vietnam.\n     Tunisia, Morocco, Uganda, Angola,\n     Zimbabwe, Djibouti, Botswana,\n     Mozambique, Zambia, Swaziland, Gambia,\n     Guinea, Algeria, Ghana.\n     Burundi, Lesotho, then Malawi, Togo,\n     The Spanish Sahara is gone,\n     Niger, Nigeria, Chad, and Liberia,\n     Egypt, Benin, and Gabon.\n     Tanzania, Somalia, Kenya, and Mali,\n     Sierra Leone, and Algiers,\n     Dahomey, Namibia, Senegal, Libya,\n     Cameroon, Congo, Zaire.\n     Ethiopia, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar,\n     Rwanda, Mayore, and Cayman,\n     Hong Kong, Abu Dhabi, Qatar, Yugoslavia...\n     Crete, Mauritania, then Transylviania,\n     Monaco, Liechtenstein, Malta, and Palestine,\n     Fiji, Australia, Sudan!\n\nFirst, were Yakko simply compiling an exhaustive list of every nation, state, and country he’d have failed quite miserably.  Some of the biggest omissions of ‘93 in this list include: South Africa (likely in an effort of solidarity with the recently departed Apartheid government), Brunei, Singapore, the Seychelles, the Vatican, Eritrea, and the recent former soviet states.\n\nSecond, let’s take a look at some controversial mentions, clear nixes, and bizarre additions: \n\n* Most notably, Korea is not split between North and South.  This could’ve been due to rhyming or rhythmic necessity or, most nefariously, an expressed desire for the reunification of the peninsula.\n\n* Palestine:  ‘93 was an auspicious year for Palestine.  It was occupied by the IDF, had no permanent govt. nor a people free to move, and had no standing army.  However, in '88 it had applied for statehood recognition through the UN and by the time of the Oslo Accords in '93 had gained [recognition from more than 90 states](http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0008/000827/082711eo.pdf).  The Oslo Accords, provided for the creation of the PNA (Palestinian National Authority), but that was to have administration of both Palestine and the West Bank.  This is most certainly a sharp invective hurled at Israel for its occupation of Palestine and a push for Israel to recognize Palestine as a country.  Coincidentally, this episode of Animaniacs aired on September 14th, 1993, the day after the signing of the Oslo Accords. \n\n* Tibet, Hong Kong:  Neither self governed nor recognized as an independent state we can file this as a solidarity mention with the then popular Free-Tibet movement.  Hong Kong was a British territory at the time. \n\n* Guam, Bermuda, Cayman:  All territories of the US and Britain respectively, they might not even qualify as nations in the most extreme sense as the ‘native’ populations in the latter two cases are settled from slavery and colonization.  \n\n* Romania, Indonesia, Greece, and Benin:  Provinces or islands with no recent history of rebellion or aspirations of statehood are mentioned.  Transylvania (Romania) is likely mentioned because of an episode where the Warner Brothers and their sister Dot accidentally travel there while trying to reach Pennsylvania.  Sumatra and Borneo are both mentioned alongside Indonesia.  Crete for Greece, and Dahomey for Benin (an older name for the small African nation). \n\n* \"Both Yemens\":  By '93 both Yemens had unified. Yakko must truly desire their separation.\n\n* Greenland: A curious case as Greenland was still partial to Denmark in '93.  In 1979 it had been granted homerule.   However basic law, policing, foreign policy, accounting, environmental affairs, and other domestic affairs were still largely governed from abroad with a slow handover.   \n\nThere are, of course, other odd mentions (Mahore, an alternative for the French possession of Mayotte in the Comoros) but most of those can be explained away reasons of rhythm or rhyme (Caribbean, Asia).  \n\n\nIt’s hard to decipher what agenda Yakko Warner had with this song, but suffice to say it is very bad history. \n\nEdit: Fixed some information on Palestine\n\n[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoaLSUKeGWw)",

        "text": "I stumbled upon this doozy in /r/lewronggeneration:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/IMzmqer.jpg\n\n[Here's the original comment thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/lewronggeneration/comments/5jlsai/life_sure_was_better_during_the_crusades/dbhfbma/?context=10000).\n\nNow, I'm nothing more than an amateur historian at this point, but I know enough to call bullshit. Almost all of the points this meme made are either untrue or deliberately obfuscating what really happened. Personally, I hate /pol/ and want desperately for Muslim refugees to find a safe home in Europe or America, but bad history is bad history, so here goes (oh, and I'd love for people to correct me on my many mistakes):\n\n1. Do the raiding, enslaving, etc. yourself\n\n Yeah, this one is accurate. Not sure what the point is, but whatever.\n\n2. Wreak havoc on your homelands by constantly attacking true Europeans\n\n There was no concept of \"Europe\" at this time. Furthermore, there were no concepts of national identity. People may have been united in a common language but traveling a mere 100 miles might take you to a place where you struggle to understand the same language that you speak!\n\n3. Byzantium is begging for help... so instead of helping out, sack the capital of Christian Byzantine leaving her vulnerable to Turkish hordes.\n\n I assume this is referring to the Fourth Crusade? Byzantium was not \"begging\" for help. The reasons why Enrico Dandolo and the others were led to Constantinople was partly due to bad intel (a pretender to the throne convinced them that he was the rightful ruler, and if they overthrew the Emperor, he would submit to the Pope as the premier religious authority) The crusaders, while waiting in mainland Venetian territory, suffered a horrible plague. Drained of money and time, the crusaders needed to first go to the ERE in order to make connections, loot, or otherwise stock up for their planned conquest of Alexandria (Jerusalem was a wholly unrealistic goal). Oh, and the Pope excommunicated all of the crusaders for attacking Constantinople and tried desperately to have them stopped.\nTo be honest, it's been a while, and I'm citing [Rodger Crowley](https://books.google.com/books?id=1RW8ieYILjMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Roger+Crowley%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiU5o2m4ofRAhUqqVQKHbnPCJQQ6AEIJjAC#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) here. I'd love for someone more knowledgeable to chime in. Regardless, the truth is infinitely more complex than \"hurr durr let's raid Constantinople.\"\n\n4. Take credit for stopping the Muslim advance when it was really the Mongol Hordes that destroyed the Islamic empire from the East.\n\n This one absolutely cracks me up by how wrong it is. The real people who stopped the \"Muslim\" (in reality, a very specific Muslim dynasty, the Umayyads) advance were the Franks, more specifically, [Charles Martel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Tours), who stopped the Umayyad incursion into (what is now) France in 732. His grandson is more famous though, being Charlemagne. More on that later. Anyways, the sacking of Baghdad happened in 1258. That's right, over 500 years after the Battle of Tours. Not sure how the sacking of Baghdad in 1258 had any impact on the Umayyad problems in Southern France. As for Baghdad itself, the era of Muslim expansionism had long come to an end at that point. \n\n5. Call upon fellow Christian peasants to put an end to oppression, yet casually massacre them in my backyard.\n\n I'm not going to dispute this. However, you have to recognize that at the time, \"oppression\" meant many different things. It definitely did not mean what it does now. Not exactly uniquely Christian to do such a thing.\n\n6. Lose hundreds of thousands of men from the Mu..., I mean from myself (Thirty Years War).\n\n Wikipedia's articles on the TYW are awful. They're written from an English perspective that glorifies the idea of a Protestant alliance vs. the Catholic Habsburg powers. This is simply not true. For one thing, the primary \"Protestant\" power was France, aka the biggest Catholic nation in Western Europe. Secondly, faith merely acted as a component to the more serious dynastic and territorial ambitions of various groups, most notably the Swedish, the Hessians, and the Palatinate. The war was triggered by the Bohemian Revolt, not overall religious tension in the Empire. Indeed, the war is best seen as a failure of the existing Imperial framework to resolve new disputes. Before the war, the Empire was easily the most peaceful part of Europe. Most disputes were resolved via arbitration, not violence. It was only after Ferdinand II issued the Edict of Restitution that the war took on a more religious flavor, and even then Sweden just abused the \"freedom of Germany\" to achieve its aim of controlling the Baltic grain trade. What's more, the war claimed around 20% of the population of Germany, not 25-40%, and an overwhelming majority of the victims were from the plague/other diseases. Lastly, the assertion that the TYW somehow left the Balkans vulnerable to the Ottomans is ridiculous. The Ottomans already controlled most of the Balkans, and furthermore, the end of the War marked the beginning of the reconquest of Hungary and the Balkans by Austria. For more, I recommend [Peter Wilson](https://www.amazon.com/Thirty-Years-War-Europes-Tragedy/dp/0674062310).\n\n7. Rather than take back what the Moorish aggressors had taken in Iberia, decide it's more important to convert the Saxons and spend about 300 years massacring them.\n\n This one is so misleading that I have to conclude OP is from /r/atheism. I have to assume that OP is talking about Charlemagne, who is largely responsible for the Christian crusades into Germany. Firstly, he did try to reconquer the Iberian Peninsula, but failed. [Turns out that the Pyrenees are a bitch to cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Roncevaux_Pass). What's more, the successive Iberian rump states were often supplied with crusading knights and funds from various Catholic donors, although I don't know enough to really comment definitively on the subject. Anyways, the Saxon lands, ruled by various leaders, were much easier to conquer than the massive Umayyad Empire. It was also a Karling family tradition to convert Saxons from paganism to Christianity. Charlemagne had his power base in Aachen. A trip to Iberia would take much longer than a trip to Saxony, and any trouble at home could be remedied much quicker. Lastly, the Carolingian Empire was highly tolerant at the time. He even employed Isaac, a Jew, as his ambassador to Baghdad. Charlemagne was devoutly religious, but also a pragmatist. War with the Umayyads would be overly costly and probably not worth it in the long end, and that's if he could win. Saxony was land ripe for the taking for a man of Charlemagne's talents. Oh, and the Pope was into it as well, and considering that Charlemagne's cooperation with the Bishop of Rome led him to being crowned the first Emperor of the West in hundreds of years, I think it was the right decision. The Imperial title lasted until 1806.\n\n#In conclusion, this meme sucks.\n",

Some small, but annoying tidbits that keep popping up from time to time. Both here in my country and out in the internets.\n\nI'm here to briefly look over and deconstruct a bunch of them:\n\n####PREHISTORY AND EARLY LITHUANIANS, OR HOW THE BALTO-SLAVIC-GERMANIC-CHINESE-DENE-CAUSASIAN PEOPLES ARRIVED TO [AFRICA](http://m.demotyvacijos.tv3.lt/media/demotivators/demotyvacija.lt_Rusija-uzeme-Kryma-nes-ten-daug-rusakalbiu-tai-gal-Lietuvai-reiktu-uzimti-Afrika-nes-panasi-forma_139859831018.jpg)\n\n**\"Balts are basically Slavo-German\"**\n\nThis is something that a friend of mine on NationStates wrote to me while we were discussing Lithuanian origins a few years ago. No, Balts are not Slavo-German. Germanic influence in the Eastern Baltic is a relatively new development, only stretching out for about the last 800 years (1200 years if you count the Vikings), and Balts and Germanic peoples lived relatively far from each other for most of their history. Slavs and Balts are closely related, but your guess is as good as mine on who is the original and who branched off from who.\n\nAnd speaking of that...\n\n**About Balto-Slavs**\n\nOkay, to make one thing clear, Balto-Slavs are nowhere near being fully confirmed and accepted as the accurate origin story of both the Balts and the Slavs. There are numerous holes in that theory, and the connections between the Balts and the Slavs can be just as explained through intense cultural and linguistic contact later on.\n\nSo stop pretending like it's the end-all and it's absolutely correct, okay?\n\nAt least in my opinion, Algirdas Girininkas^[1] proposes an interesting alternative to current theories on Baltic ethnogenesis - from his point of view, the effect of Corded Ware culture on what should be the homeland of proto-Baltic culture is miniscule, thus he proposes that the Balts formed from Late Narva culture directly, thus pretty much saying that they are the autochthones (original inhabitants) of the Eastern Baltic coast and didn't detach from any Slavs at all.\n\nBut, as I said, your guess is as good as mine. Just that we shouldn't pretend that any of our guesses is fact.\n\n**\"We defeated the German knights in Saule and Durbe!\"**\n\nNo, Lithuanians did not participate in either Battle of the Sun in 1236 nor Battle of Durbe in 1260. The Samogitian forces in Saule were led by Vykintas, Duke of Samogitia, who was actually [a rival of the soon-to-be King Mindaugas of Lithuania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vykintas) in his quest for power. And in Durbe, Mindaugas was actually the *enemy* of the Samogitian forces who defeated the Livonian Order. He gifted Samogitia to the Livonian Order to obtain their help against rebels in Samogitia who opposed his Christianization and consolidation of power. The same rebels then defeated the Livonians.\n\nNow we celebrate a battle won by our at-the-time enemies as a battle won by us.\n\n**\"The reason for the formation of Lithuania was the arrival of German monastic orders. Without them, Lithuanians would not have united\"**\n\nalso known as:\n\n**\"Before Mindaugas, Lithuania did not exist\"**\n\nMuch like everything else in this entire god damned entire field of history, this is still being heavily discussed and disputed. While schoolchildren in Lithuania learn about King Mindaugas as the first ruler of Lithuania who united a bunch of wayward tribes into a solid state to fight against Teutonic and Livonian pressure, the situation is actually much, *much* more complex, and actually more interesting, than what most people believe.\n\nThere is a large subsection of historians who propose that the foundation of Lithuania is actually somewhere around the year 1183^[2], when Lithuanians suddenly began launching raids into nearby East Slavic principalities and other Baltic lands after over a century of Ruthenian attempts at subjugation. By the time that the Livonian Knights arrived to Riga, Lithuanians were running around all over modern day Latvia and Estonia with raiding parties over a few thousand men strong, terrorizing the locals and providing a great challenge to the crusaders.\n\nIn 1205, almost 40 years before Mindaugas's supposed unification of Lithuania, the Lithuanian duke [Žvelgaitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%BDvelgaitis) clashed with the Semigallians and citizens of Riga after a raiding trip and lost over 1200 men in the process - organizing such armies in the Baltics, and for *raiding* rather than full-blown warfare, requires a high degree of governmental organization. And Žvelgaitis wasn't even the leader of the Lithuanians at the time!\n\nAnd after the death of Žvelgutis, Dangerutis and Stekšys in the 1210s, the number of Lithuanian raids greatly diminished until the rise of Mindaugas, indicating that the strength of the Lithuanians fell - Tomas Baranauskas presumes that the deaths of these many leaders at the hands of the Livonians weakened the unification process among them until Mindaugas arose to fill in the power vacancy.\n\nKeep in mind that this is saying that the arrival of the Livonian Order actually caused the *decline* of Lithuanian unification rather than caused it's beginning. So, think for yourselves.\n\n####MEDIEVAL LITHUANIA, OR THE FACT THAT HISTORY OF LITHUANIA ENDS WITH VYTAUTAS'S DEATH\n\n**\"Lithuanians were the victims of Teutonic aggression and were generally not as bad as them\"**\n\nImma just let [this source](http://imgur.com/a/xMVnF) speak for itself.\n\n**\"Algirdas marched to Moscow three times! See, we defeated the Russians!\"**\n\n[Actually, he had to retreat all three times.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian%E2%80%93Muscovite_War_(1368%E2%80%9372) And thus lost Tver, a very valuable ally of his in fighting Moscow. It was generally a defeat.\n\n[shamelessplug]However, if you are interested in both this war and medieval Lithuania in general, why don't you read my alternate history timeline, [The Silver Knight](http://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/the-silver-knight-a-lithuania-timeline.399196/), a timeline with a POD exactly at this point in time and this war, when AH.com comes back online? I would appreciate more readers, I put a lot of work into it, kthxbye[/shamelessplug]\n\n**Vytautas the Patriot, or Not**\n\nEvery nation has historical figures they look up to as a source of national pride. At least, most of them do. I think you Americans really like your founding fathers. Mongolia has Genghis Khan. France has Napoleon. Turkey - Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. And so on and so forth. They even give them appendixes like 'the Great', 'the Holy', 'the Glorious', 'the Terrible'. Maybe not that last one. But anyway, so does Lithuania. \n\nThe most famous Lithuanian from history that we know is Vytautas Kęstutaitis, Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1392 to 1430, most commonly known as \"Vytautas the Great\". Extremely respected figure. He's huge. Maybe not as huge as he was during the Interwar, when we went full yandere on his remembrance, but still huge. And I have to say, for the most part he has a lot be respected about. He put the foundations for turning Lithuania from a state still resembling something from the Early Medieval Era with it's structure to a modern, Christian, Western nation. He expanded Lithuania to it's greatest extent ever (barring Gedgaudas's pot dreams, of course) and commanded it's troops in the Battle of Grunwald. And he got so close to being crowned King, too...\n\nThe problem is when people start to see him as not just a capable Grand Duke, but also as a patriotic figure fighting against Polish influence in his country and forcing all kings and rulers around him to kneel to him. (from here on out using^[3] )\n\nVytautas was a pragmatist like no other who cared little about his people - and especially not the \"ethnic Lithuanians\" that were getting harder and harder to distinguish from the Ruthenian subjects. His goal was to obtain the cap of the Grand Duke for himself, become independent from the whims of Jogaila in Poland and expand the power of his country - and all of them for himself and only for himself.\n\nThe easiest way to prove it are the events of the Lithuanian Civil War. So your cousin Jogaila has taken control of the country. You have managed to escape from imprisonment (leaving your father to die in that same prison, by the way) by dressing up in a woman's clothes. Jogaila is considering leaving for Poland and marrying a Catholic princess, thus accepting their faith as well. You want to gain the throne, but you don't have much support, nor do you have money, soldiers or any land. What do you do?\n\nDon't say. Here is what Vytautas did - he went to the Teutonic Knights to ask for help. You know, the exact same guys that have been looting and pillaging your country for over a hundred years now? The same people who burned down the Kaunas Castle, and a teenage you, according to a legend, witnessed the destruction and swore that you will avenge against them? Those Teutonic Knights? Yup. \n\nAnd what happened then? Well, the Teutonic Knights took that opportunity like a hungry hawk and looted the Lithuanian heartland the next year. Good job, you supposed patriot. Oh, what is that? You got the position of Grand Duke, mr. Vytautas, and yet a few years later you fled to the Teutons *again*? And promised them Samogitia, one of ethnic Lithuania's core regions, this time? And let the Knights pillage your country a second time? Wow, that's some amazing patriotism, bro!\n\nVytautas was a pragmatist who was great at realpolitik. He was not against backstabbing allies for his personal gain and he could befriend even his fiercest enemy if that alliance gives him something. He was a great military leader and had pretty much everything set up for making Lithuania a kingdom. Just that he wasn't this patriotic figure fighting against Polish dominance. If he was the successor after Algirdas and if he was proposed with marrying Hedwig to become King of Poland (and if he wasn't already married, of course, because he was), he'd have taken that opportunity immediately and would be remembered as a Polish tool much like Jogaila.\n\nSpeaking of whom...\n\n**\"Jogaila was a traitor to Lithuania!\"**\n\nHere's a fun historical fact: in 1930, when the entire nation was celebrating the 500 year anniversary of Vytautas's death, there was an unofficial \"court trial\" of Jogaila, the first Lithuanian King of Poland, for betraying Lithuania. You know, crazy Eastern Europeans.\n\nJogaila is like the opposite of Vytautas when it comes to being remembered. He was also a pragmatist who really didn't care much about preserving Lithuanian nationality or anything, and wasn't even an amazing or terrible leader, just that he got an easy \"press here to elevate your rank\" button in the name of Hedwig de Anjou. However, he is seen as a sort of \"traitor\" to Lithuanians, the man who started a 400 year long period of Polish dominance of Lithuania.\n\nAnd while Polonization is, well, not good, Jogaila was actually much more beneficiary to Lithuania than he's given respect of. The Christianization of Lithuania itself was huge, his rule brought Western culture, arts and technology more accessible to Lithuania, he moved it closer to Europe, and he ended the hundred years' war against the Teutonic Order.\n\nBut, of course, people will always point to the future, to the Republic of Both Nations and say \"Jogaila did it!\"\n\n####THE MODERN ERA, OR HOW LITHUANIA WAS SUDDENLY CIRCUMSIZED\n\nI won't touch the numerous things about Belarus and Vilnius that I covered before, nor will I talk about some minor things, neither will I talk about the Soviet era, but I will write about two big things from this period.\n\n**\"Interwar Lithuania was fascist. Lithuanians were Nazi sympathizers.\"**\n\nThese two sentences are extremely common throughout Russian propaganda today, but I won't cover what Kremlin is doing with our history because R2.\n\nWhat I do have to say is this: the first sentence is false and the second sentence is applying modern views onto historical people.\n\nInterwar Lithuania was about as fascist as any other minor Eastern European dictatorship, so not a lot. The dictatorship of Antanas Smetona was oppressive compared to a democracy, but it did not have mass incarceration, secret police, totalitarian control of the press and education, mass political purges nor extreme oppression of opposition parties (only the communists were fully banned). It was nationalistic and had territorial claims on Vilnius that it sought to regain, as well as a much larger military than, say, nowadays, but by all means, it was a standard right-wing authoritarian dictatorship, like the rest of the Baltic states at the time. While it *did* seem like it was about to gravitate to one at the beginning, what with an actual fascist named Augustinas Voldemaras as Prime Minister employing things like paramilitaries and concentration camps, this was soon reverted when Smetona realized what was going on.\n\nNow, the second one. I'm sure some of you have seen pictures like [this](http://g4.dcdn.lt/images/pix/naciai-71515776.jpg) or [this](https://i.redditmedia.com/Q2w__87n0riOfGD8UZZqWiaxBEwz2_b1Pe3LBMjEDC8.jpg?w=1024&amp;s=a795a687c094dc49731d404a5479b63a), which seem to indicate that the Lithuanians were sympathetic with the Nazi cause and did most of the work for them in the Holocaust. The truth is much different - as in, it is much more grey than what people think.\n\nYou see all those people cheering for Wehrmacht soldiers in the streets in June of 1941? What were they hoping for? An independent Lithuania, that's what! Remember the [June uprising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_Uprising_in_Lithuania)? As soon as the Germans marched through the border, Kaunas and Vilnius were taken over by Lithuanian revolters who declared the reestablishment of the Lithuanian state.\n\nBut wait, you might say. Why did they think the Germans will give them freedom, anyway? They wanted to annex Eastern Europe, purge or assimilate the inhabitants and settle the lands with Germans! Well, none of us knew at the time. It's the same with the Holocaust - none knew that the Jews will see their fate in death camps upon the beginning of Operation Barbarossa.\n\nThere were people who joined the Nazis in massacring Jews and there were people who tried to rescue them from certain doom in concentration camps. It's never \"all in favor\" or \"all against\". And the Lithuanians - almost an absolute majority of them, anyway, now that I said that nothing is black and white - would have made a deal with an invading Satan if it meant the chance of independence against Russians.\n\nI had two grand uncles from my grandmother's side, they were brothers. One of them was a \"white-band\", a Hiwi, serving in the Wehrmacht. The other was a volunteer in the Red Army. And this is actually true, and actually common throughout Lithuanian families of the time.\n\nIt's never simple here in Eastern Europe.\n\n---\n\nSources\n\n1.

        "text": "Hello there, long time reader, first time poster, yadda yadda. \n\nI saw [this](http://imgur.com/a/6SuJ3) today while trolling through Google Images looking for a good map of US demographics. This map... raised an eyebrow, and although I'm not sure this belongs here, there seems to be no /r/baddemographics, so I figured I'd give it a try here. [The website](http://www.tdaxp.com/archive/2012/03/21/educational-achivement-in-the-context-of-the-five-heartlands-of-the-united-states.html) in question seems to argue that areas with pluralities of minorities (and Scotch-Irish, for some reason), tend to do worse than areas with pluralities of Germans/English-Americans. This point frankly isn't very good, but I'm not here to argue about that, let's critique his attempt at a demographic map. \n\n* The general structure seems to have been taken verbatim from [this](http://www.gridgit.com/postpic/2014/07/ancestry-of-the-united-states-map_1394271.jpg), so let's examine this map and look at how our man interpreted it, shall we?\n\n1. The Italian majorities in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Rhode Island appear to be completely ignored, in favor of a complete Germanization of every Italian-plurality area. Germans and Italians are not the same people. (R5 **not** needed)\n\n2. English and Irish-majority areas in the Northeast are lumped together and called \"British\", which is rather broad, and risks inflaming some rather nasty ethnic tensions.\n\n3. The areas that reported a plurality in \"American\" ancestry are labelled \"Scotch-Irish\", which simply isn't true. Sure, some people with reported American ancestry do have Scotch-Irish blood, but just as many are English, or Scottish, or German, or [anything else](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_ethnicity#American_ancestry_in_the_U.S._Census). The term is kinda catch-all, y'know? While [these states do tend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotch-Irish_Americans#Geographical_distribution) to have a large population of Scotch-Irish, in none of these states are these populations the plurality. \n\n4. Delaware is listed as African-American, when it isn't. Small things, really. I suppose the guy making this realized how tacky it would look to have two \"British exclaves\", so he just decided to go with the option that would lead to the prettiest lines across the map.\n\n5. This guy's whole organization is just dire. Why he decided to go by state instead of by county or concentration baffles the mind. For example, compare [this](http://proximityone.com/images4/txsdp2.png) map of school performance in Texas to the demographic map. If this guy's racist theory holds any water, then there should be a sharp decline in performance in Latino-majority countries, yet there isn't. This whole thing falls apart under the smallest scrutiny.\n\n6. Much like \"civilization\" maps we've seen earlier, this map completely seems to ignore anything except for plurality, so that Nevada, where the Latino and German populations are [very close](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada#Race), is in the \"German Heartland\" while California, which has only [slightly more folks of Latino descent,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California#Demographics) is Hispanic all the way!\n\n7. The distinction between German, British, and Scotch-Irish is completely unnecessary, really, and seems to have been done mostly to make it seem like there are more nonwhites than there actually are.\n\nAnyways, this guy is beginning to get on my nerves and I probably spent more effort on this post than he did on his map, so I'm gonna check out, bye. Hopefully I avoided R2 successfully, it was kinda hard. This is my first post, so feedback is always appreciated.\n\n",

        "text": "Hey again, badhistory. Let's skip the pleasantries and get right to it. Over on a thread in r/dataisbeautiful , I said this:\n\n\"Every time someone mentions the A-Bombs, usually in the context of how horrific they were, I always go straight for this.\nIt can be incredibly hard to get people to understand that The A-Bombs saved Japan as much as they did America. Japan wouldn't exist today if we had to firebomb every population center like we did Tokyo, presumably followed up by an invasion.\"\n\nThe \"This\" in this case is [this] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_raids_on_Japan) and more specifically [this] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Tokyo). The US bombing campaigns against Japan. They were devastating and horrific, and depending on how you compare the numbers, more deadly than the A-bombs. Bomb for bomb, the A-bombs were obviously more destructive, but the carnage left behind by the bombing campaigns caused a lot more deaths and damage overall. \n\nThis comment prompted [this] (https://np.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/5j8nlp/every_bomb_dropped_by_allied_forces_during_wwii_oc/dbeu3py/) response from one Mr or Mrs [fkdbhrbithjfnhxdhb] (https://np.reddit.com/user/fkdbhrbithjfnhxdhb). The comment:\n\n&gt; That's the most insane argument I've ever heard. Firstly, Japan posed no significant threat to America when the atomic bombs were dropped, if it ever did, so the assertion that America was saved in any way by the bombing is abjectly wrong.\n\n&gt; Secondly, the idea that Japan was saved presumes that America would have otherwise completely taken over Japan and made it part of America, or hand it over to another country. Is there any evidence they wanted to do that? Because if Americans weren't ever going to do that then Japan would be \"saved\" in all cases.\n\n&gt; Thirdly, you are the whole of America and the whole of Japan. You are those concepts, psychologically, and they are not real, they are only beliefs, ideas, they are not actual. Your argument implicitly places emphasis on the continuity of imaginary things over the continuity of actual physical humans. Political and social structures are ideas. The only facts of that conflict is that enormous amounts of humans of all ages and sexes died horrifying agonising deaths, along with the destruction of their houses and property and physical environment. The existence or non-existence of any country is of no more significance than the existence or non-existence of middle earth in Lord of the Rings, they are equally fictious and unrelated to reality entirely.\n\nAnd, well, I take ~~umbridge~~ umbrage with this. \n\n\"Firstly, Japan posed no significant threat to America when the atomic bombs were dropped\"\n\nOne thing I want to say right out is that this is actually *kind of* a fair point from a certain perspective. Japan never intended to invade the continental US. They were, however, a threat to *Americans*. Mainly, the American serviceman who were fighting their empire, seeking to liberate the territories Japan had brutally subjugated. At the time of the A-bombs, Americans were still fighting and still dying, and Japan still held territory in mainland Asia. The power of Imperial Japan was waning, but by no means was it completely *gone*. \n\n\"...if it ever did\"\n\nWell, no, it did. If you want to talk about the power of Imperial Japan towards the end, that's fine, but don't pretend they weren't *all kinds* of dangerous at their peak. \n\nThe two examples I want to link specifically are the [Pearl Harbor attack] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor) (I know, predictable), and the [Aleutian Islands Campaign] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleutian_Islands_Campaign) both of which put Americans in danger on their own territory. \n\n\"Secondly, the idea that Japan was saved presumes that America would have otherwise completely taken over Japan and made it part of America, or hand it over to another country. Is there any evidence they wanted to do that? Because if Americans weren't ever going to do that then Japan would be \"saved\" in all cases.\" \n\nMy ultimate point in my first comment was that, if the US continued their bombing campaigns, followed up by an invasion, Japan would probably be destroyed. Some people and traces of Japan might live on, in the same way organisms can continue living in a corpse long after its died. The losses of American servicemen would've been nightmarish as well. The codename for the theoretical Japanese invasion was \"Operation Downfall\", and the estimates of both combatants and non-combatants is [downright chilling] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Downfall#Estimated_casualties).  \n\n\"Thirdly, you are the whole of America and the whole of Japan. You are those concepts, psychologically, and they are not real, they are only beliefs, ideas, they are not actual. Your argument implicitly places emphasis on the continuity of imaginary things over the continuity of actual physical humans. Political and social structures are ideas. The only facts of that conflict is that enormous amounts of humans of all ages and sexes died horrifying agonising deaths, along with the destruction of their houses and property and physical environment. The existence or non-existence of any country is of no more significance than the existence or non-existence of middle earth in Lord of the Rings, they are equally fictious and unrelated to reality entirely.\"\n\nr/badhistory , I tell you. I don't know what this means or how to respond to it. But Japan was dangerous in more places than just middle earth. ",

        "text": "Disclaimer: Im no scholar, but researched as much for historical jesus the past 6 months, so excuse me for some inaccuracies, and im not sure if this should be R/badhistory or R/AcadamicBiblical but seeing theres more people here I thought I could get the best of it here. BTW this is my first post on reddit and i decided to sign up to join the reddit community so im pretty shy, here we go!\n\nEvery year, every year theres at least some people who seemingly want to ruin christmas for certain people by preaching \"jesus never existed\" argument and it seemed to pop up in R/Atheism a few days ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/5hhdhi/evidence_doesnt_add_up_for_existence_of/?st=iwv2bmbr&amp;sh=d0549b4b\n\nIve seen this article posted 3 times in the same week in R/Atheism and it seems they are eating it up without secound thought, but I'll make a critique of that later, now I found something worse and clearly done by a first timer in journalism. This article\n http://www.rawstory.com/2016/12/here-are-5-reasons-to-suspect-jesus-never-existed-2/\nGives 5 reason why he never existed, since im interested in someway on their supposed accusations, im wondering if they were repeating something click baity just so they can upload easily, of course im right.\n\nHe starts with saying the gospels are considered \"mythologized history\" which maybe so, but that is considered by a lot of ancient history to carry some sense of 'myth', the gospels are just probebly exemplified, but he goes and show the examples scholars considered \"myths\" \n\n&gt;\"At the same time, these scholars acknowledge that many Bible stories like the virgin birth, miracles, resurrection, and women at the tomb borrow and rework mythic themes that were common in the Ancient Near East\"\n\nI dont know about you but its clear that the virgin birth, resurrection and women at the tomb are not \"reworks\", only possible exception of Resurrection, but the virgin birth and women at the tomb? instead of quoting or sourcing these claims he just passed it on as what \"most scholars claim\". The virgin birth idea must come from the idea he's based on Pagan gods, and resurrection might be part of it, except for the whole matter that **no single pagan god thats associated with the jesus myth theory ever had a virgin birth**. Horus, Dionysus, mithra, Khrisna, and whatever other dietys dont have virginity attested to their \"parents\" (Mithra born from a rock so unless if people were into boulders back then...). Hearing the Women at the tomb as a rework really made me give a big **sigh**, how is woman at the tomb at all a re work, and of what? Especially considering if they were making a myth of him, why put in your only testimony as women? They were considered as unworthy as witnesses unless if they were the \"only\" witnesses there. Considering if this was made up, it could have been easily maybe some of the apostles paying respect, but found the tomb, instead its women, so it seems strange.\n\nHe admits a bit later that \"The notion that Jesus never existed is a minority position\" but after words we get a shocking reveal, its \"David Fitzgerald, the author of Nailed: Ten Christian Myths That Show Jesus Never Existed at All.\" DUN DUN DUMB!\n\nHe goes on saying the **only** reason its considerd major is because \"Fitzgerald points out that for centuries all serious scholars of Christianity were Christians themselves, and modern secular scholars lean heavily on the groundwork that they laid in collecting, preserving, and analyzing ancient texts\"\n\nOh OF course, i wonder then why people like Bart Ehrman, Maurice Casey, Paula Fredriksen and Gerd Ludemann, Mark Nanos, Alan Segal, Jacob Neusner, Hyam Maccoby and Geza Vermes all of whom who reject the christian notion of jesus as a divine being and earlier works, are only using christian works to support their own. If you dont already know, Fitzgerald is somewhat of a un trustworthy blogger/writer who claims scholarship but seeing his work, its so obviously purley emotion and now scholarship, surprising how he was picked and not Richard Carrier of Rober M. Price, who are actual scholars (who i disagree with but still at least they are more legit then David). If you can, read Tim O'neills review of his book, and from davids respons here:\nhttp://armariummagnus.blogspot.ca/2011/05/nailed-ten-christian-myths-that-show.html\nhttp://armariummagnus.blogspot.ca/2013/12/the-jesus-myth-theory-reponse-to-david.html\n\n&gt;\"Fitzgerald–who, as his book title indicates, takes the “mythical Jesus” position–is an atheist speaker and writer, popular with secular students and community groups\" \n\nClearly a lie because literally **every community that deal with real scholars reject all his notions**, He doesent even list or name any so im assuming he's pulling this out his ass. His only acceptance is those in the comment section of the article.\n\n&gt;\"More academic arguments in support of the Jesus Myth theory can be found in the writings of Richard Carrier and Robert Price\"\n\nFinally something somewhat true, Robert M. Price's view (from what I read) is not that jesus didnt exist but that theres such a lacking evidence for him that we should consider it, sounds reasonable but he seems to fail the notion were talking about a peasent preacher in the middle east, very hard to find the best attested evidence for such a wortheless guy at his time. Carriers view is also shotty, but his latest claim is that theres a 1/3 chance he existed, so he coming closer to considering he existed at least.\nTo skip the rest, im just gonna go to the 5 reasons, sorry for the long ranting then.\n\n*1. No first century secular evidence whatsoever exists to support the actuality of Yeshua ben Yosef.\n\n*siiiiighhh* you know this article is going wrong when its starts with \"not first centruty 'secular' evidence\" because its gonna be hard to find that for consideration of a nobody who preached to other nobodys (fishermen, farmers, very poor people) since why would there be? Instead of giving his own argument as expected, **he quotes Bart Erhman!** he doesn't name or source where this quote is from only its from page 56-57 so maybe his book \"did jesus exist?\"? Reading the quote is should be clear that he is talking about why there isnt afterwards, not that his conclusion is that there should have been, Bart makes it clear that considering the lack of writings from 1st century as it is, its not surprising at all for someone like jesus. The other thing is that this point is entirely wrong, if we count josephus text as its dated in 93CE, where he mentions him **twice**. His first has some very clear additions to it that fit a christian view, but also carrys words that seem authentic to josephus, like calling the christians a tribe. There are also other version of the Testimonium Flavianum from syriac and arabic, the arabic seems to be the most likley authentic as its talks about jesus, not even attributing to him being resurrected (just that he assu and only states he was claimed to be the messiah, so heres the text: \"\n&gt;\"At this time there was a wise man who was called Jesus. And his conduct was good, and he was known to be virtuous. And many people from among the Jews and the other nations became his disciples. Pilate condemned him to be crucified and to die. And those who had become his disciples did not abandon his discipleship. They reported that he had appeared to them after his crucifixion and that he was alive; accordingly, he was perhaps the Messiah concerning whom the prophets have recounted wonders.\" \n\nThis seems to show that there was an earlier text that at its core talked about jesus, and that the greek version was alterd more likely by Eusebius, but even if he did, Origen (3rd century) Mentions Joesphus passage about jesus how he failed to accept him as the messiah (Contra Celsum I.4) &gt;\"Now this writer [Josephus], although not believing in Jesus as the Messiah\"\n\n so we can confirm that even before Eusebius the text contained the mention of jesus. So its conclusion is that its partial authentic, but at its core it definetly mentions jesus.\n\n*2. The earliest New Testament writers seem ignorant of the details of Jesus’ life, which become more crystalized in later texts.\n\n\nOk, he 'kinda' gets it right about the crystalized in later texts, but thats expected if talking about a small time figure, of course theres gonna be in need of clarification, but that doesnt account them as being completley unreliable, its just means later accounts are less and less reliable, not the ones closer.\n\n&gt;\"Paul seems unaware of any virgin birth, for example. No wise men, no star in the east, no miracles. Historians have long puzzled over the “Silence of Paul” on the most basic biographical facts and teachings of Jesus\"\n\nWhat? So just because he doesnt talk about the virgin birth=no jesus? Paul wasnt writing about all the other miracles as well, that was not what fully amazed the early christians, it was his resurrection that caught their attention, his godly appearance in human incarnation. Its not surprising he also didnt mention the water to wine, raising the dead, and etc. But lacking mention of miraclous jesus doesnt account at all for either lacking that he did, let alone his existence, this argument has nothing to do with his existance but instead his powers, that a different subject talking about the gospels, not pauls letters.\n\nHe then uses a quote from Marcus Borg as how later through the 1st century the story of jesus seems to become more mythical, but he clealy states how the gospels are based from the christian community's. Im not familiar with Marcus Borg or much of the Jesus Seminar, but his conclusion is that jesus existed, and gave teachings to whom the apostles spread to said communites, paul could have easily just heard from the aposltes about him but what struck him was the ressurection (though i could be wrong with that, if im wrong please correct me)\n\n *3. Even the New Testament stories don’t claim to be first-hand accounts\nThough he is right, that doesent at all discredit everything written in them to not be attested to his life, they were clearly written in communitys that were taught by the apostles themselves or followers of them, so its likely in these texts there were some additions but at the core, they got the same message of who he was and what he did and what happened at the time and place.\n&gt;\"For a variety of reasons, the practice of pseudonymous writing was common at the time and many contemporary documents are “signed” by famous figures. \"\nHe doesent bring this examples from other writers of the time only the ones from the new testament, so cleary i got no clue what he's talking about outside the bible.\n&gt;\"But even the gospel stories don’t actually say, “I was there.” Rather, they claim the existence of other witnesses, a phenomenon familiar to anyone who has heard the phrase, my aunt knew someone who . . . .\" \n\nappreantly, according to him, people who state that their person x mentions person y, its most likely made up, because that sounds reasonable. Im not sure how this arguement stands on its own, he seems to dismiss reading accounts as just made up for the sake of saying its made up.\n\n*4. The gospels, our only accounts of a historical Jesus, contradict each other.\n\nOk, to get this out of the way first, when he means gospels, im gonna assume he never read the gnostic gospels, i.e other accounts of jesus. \n\nHis claim that the contradict each other is pretty obvious, but he makes it seem like *everything* written down is a contradiction. He asks us to put our knowledge of jesus on a 20 question quiz on exchristian.net (clearly its gonna be unbiased).  His only examples he puts up is his birth narrative (of course) and says this is one of the \"many\" disagreements. But wait you might ask, didnt he claim the birth narrative is a rework of common myth? if so, how hard would it be to re-imagine it then? its the sames story so it should have just been replacing names here and there, thats it. I seriously doubt theres \"many\" disagreements as he also pointed out that luke and matthew are re-works of mark, but with additions. he doesnet seem to think maybe these additions come from Q or other sources, he doesent mention Q at all so i suspect he thinks the 4 gospels are the only accounts. The only other Disagreement among the gospels I can think the top of my head is the Trial, where in mark he says little to nothing at all, but in john he goes all sermon on them. its clear to guess we dont know what took place during the trial since the disciples weren't there so they just guessed what he said, which is what he been telling the disciples .\n\n *5. Modern scholars who claim to have uncovered the real historical Jesus depict wildly different persons.\n\nAt this point, im only convinced he wasnt even argueing agains jesus's existance but just who he was, how does various views equal to leading his non existance? We know little about pontius pilate, just that he was a ruthless jerk and governor of Judea at the time, or he was a decent fellow to jesus at his trial who had sympathy. its clear that because of lacking much accounts of jesus out of the bible is gonna be very hard to determine, so thats why we rely on the gospels (canonical and not) on who he was.\n\nHe then lists off a few quotes (an amazing 2) by price and crossan saying how there being so many depictions of jesus is embarrassing, but i say contrary to them, thats probably who jesus was. Look at the early Christians, they were amazingly diverse in the 1st-2nd centruy, his presence truely had different opinions to who he was, he gave his teachings and most likely before he could properly clear things up or finish his work, he gets killed, people spread his teachings and many groups try to demonstrate who he was by what they got. some viewed his teachings on being meek was important, that he was preaching on being spiritually enlightned, on being virtous and alms giving, justice working, etc. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_in_early_Christian_theology\nso the diversity on who jesus was fits exactly what the early christians followed, its not surprise today we have that as well.\n\nWhat scared me the most is when he announced Fitzgerald plan on a new book: Nailed, entitled Jesus: Mything in Action. Sweet baby jesus i really wanna see Tim O'Neill tear this to pieces as well. His argument is gonna be about how diverse the opinions of jesus is thus his non existance. As I explained above, the diversity of the community to me leads that there was a person who preached his teachings, but died before his finish up and people tried to pick up what he left off. if he was a myth its wouldnt be easy to make diverse ideas of him. \n\nlook at Heracles, his story is interesting and straigt forward, we dont have different accounts/version of him or any evolution, its not like it started with him being some gladiator who fought people to fighting monsters for zeus or something, unlike jesus who it seems his followers have difficulty understanding him and try contributing ideas to make sense of him.\n\nFitzgerald is just sounding rather authoritive now on saying\n&gt; \"Even if one accepts that there was a real Jesus of Nazareth, the question has little practical meaning: Regardless of whether or not a first century rabbi called Yeshua ben Yosef lived, the “historical Jesus” figures so patiently excavated and re-assembled by secular scholars are themselves fictions.\" \n\nin other words, disagree with me, your just stupid and wrong.\n\nI thank you so much for reading, if theres any corrections i need to make, please comment and let me know. this was my first time and still pretty shy on discussing this with possible historians on this. \nI hope my critic was accurate and clean as possible as to why these arguments are little to no worth and i hope a Merry Christmas/Happy Holidays!\n\nedit: i seem to have problems with listing the numbers, they seem to repeat 1 and 2 when it should be 1, 2, 3, 4 ,5 so im gonna try to fix this, but please help if you can",

The upper figure of 1,500,000 is (the new) \"official\" figure as now inscribed at Auschwitz, with the earlier figure of 4,000,000 having been removed from the memorial at the site of the former concentration camp.\n \n&gt; 1,000,000\n \n&gt; Source: Jean-Claude Pressac, writing in his 1989 book Auschwitz: Technique and Operation of the Gas Chambers. This is interesting since he wrote his book to repudiate so-called \"Holocaust deniers\" who were called that precisely because they had questioned the numbers of those who had died at Auschwitz.\n \n&gt; 900,000\n \n&gt; Source: Reported on August 3, 1990 11, by Aufbau, a Jewish newspaper in New York.\n \n&gt; 800,000 to 900,000\n \n&gt; Source: Reported by Gerald Reitlinger in his book, The Final Solution.\n \n&gt; 775,000 to 800,000\n \n&gt; Source: Jean-Claude Pressac's revised figure, put forth in his 1993 book, The Crematoria of Auschwitz: The Mass Murder's Machinery, scaling down his earlier claim of 1,000,000 dead.\n \n&gt; 630,000 to 710,000\n \n&gt; Source: In 1994 Pressac scaled his figure down somewhat further; this is the figure cited in the German language translation of Pressac's 1993 book originally published in French. Again, this is substantially less than Pressac's 1989 figure of 1,000,000.\n \n&gt;135,000 to 140,000\n \n&gt;Source: This is an estimate based on documents held by the International Tracing Service of the Red Cross. It is known that International Tracing Service has a complete set of registration documents. This is thought to include a complete set of roll-call data which includes twice daily tallies of those who died. Although the International Tracing Service of the Red Cross has such records, they have never officially published an accurate count of those who died, or even an accurate report as to exactly which documents they hold. However, totals from these records have been obtained by various interested parties.\n \n&gt;The estimate of 135,000 is roughly corroborated by the \"Auschwitz death books.\" The death books themselves are wartime German camp records, which were captured by the Soviets towards the end of the war, and hidden in Soviet achieves, until released to the Red Cross in 1989.\n \n&gt;The death books consist of 46 volumes which document each death at Auschwitz (each death certificate consists of the deceased person's full name, profession and religion, date and place of birth, pre-Auschwitz residence, parents' names, time of death, and cause of death as determined by a camp physician). The records for the most important years, 1942 and 1943, are almost complete (there are also a few volumes for the year 1941, but none for the year 1944 or January 1945 (when Auschwitz was evacuated)).\n \n&gt; The Auschwitz death books contain the death certificates of some 69,000 individuals, of whom about 30,000 were listed as Jews. You may view various eThe above mentioned, ever declining numbers of alleged dead at Auschwitz, are graphically illustrated by the following pictures of plaques from the camp. \n\nI didn't have time to go through everything that's wrong with this article, but there are two particular issues that stand out to me. First, it's widely agreed that Miklos Nyiszli was indeed at Auschwitz. The biggest criticism I can find of his book is that he didn't describe the crematoria all that accurately and that he defamed the Sonderkommando. (I hate Wikipedia as a source but here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikl%C3%B3s_Nyiszli) \n\nSecond, my recollection is that the death books were never particularly accurate. That is, they recorded prisoners who were brought into Auschwitz and incarcerated for labor purposes. They don't reflect prisoners who got off the train and were immediately taken into the gas chambers. If you're going to kill somebody, why would you bother giving him a number/taking his records/etc.?  (Source: https://www.hdot.org/debunking-denial/ab2-death-books/)\n\nThird, just a basic factual error: Adolf Eichmann was executed in 1961, so if somebody was testifying at a trial in 1981, Eichmann had been dead for 20 years. \n\nAnyway, have at it.

        "author": "chocolatepot",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/5ij1il/timetravelling_teenaged_jane_austen/",
        "text": "Have you ever heard of the \"Rice Portrait\"? I'm guessing not. It's a full-length portrait of a young girl, probably aged ten to thirteen, owned by the Rice family, which they claim is a picture of Jane Austen. You can see it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rice_portrait) or [here](http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/news/cambridge-news/stunning-rare-portrait-jane-austen-12304585). There's obviously a good reason for the family to want it to be Austen - it's worth a lot more that way, and gets a lot more attention. And the few \"experts\" declaring it to be her could get acclaim as the person to identify the sitter (stander?) as well. But there's no way this is Jane Austen.\n\n Jane Austen was born in 1775, meaning that if this were her, it would have been painted in 1785-1788. The Rices argue that it was painted by Ozias Humphrey in 1788, commissioned by Austen's great-uncle for reasons that do not seem clear (they know he was commissioned to do some painting by Francis Austen at that time, but there are no records of his subjects). The blogger defends this date by comparing the dress in the portrait to [that in other late 18th century portraits of children](http://janeaustenportraits.blogspot.co.uk/2016/05/jane-austen-c18th-costume-and-rice.html) and the portrait's website [has its own page of comparisons as well](http://www.janeaustenriceportrait.com/dress/4581230738), but in all cases, there is one problem or another with the comparison.\n\n(And can I just point out - the portrait's page states that the 1948 dismissal of the portrait as Austen was flawed because the writer \"did not have access to Google image\". I'm not denying that the internet has been a huge help to fashion historians, but it's because of museums putting their collections online, not because of Google Image Search, which gives you tons of results on blogs and in Pinterest with no attribution and often wrong dating. And even then, there are a lot of museums with poorly-dated artwork! The fact that both sites include portraits that have been wrongly dated as \"c. 1790\" or \"c. 1780\" when someone more knowledgeable with the history of fashion would have placed them later shows the pitfalls of researching with Google Images.)\n\nThere are two big hints that the Rice Portrait is not from 1788: the sleeves and the waistline. To start with the sleeves: they are fairly full and gathered to a flat band a bit above the elbow. The majority of the \"see, they're the same\" portraits show children in gowns with narrow sleeves. This is really key, because from roughly the 1740s through the 1780s, both women and children wore gowns with sleeves that were cut to fit from shoulder and elbow. When white gowns became commonplace for children from the 1770s on, the conventional sleeve continued to be used, and this continued to be the case through the 1780s. When a more chemise-gown style of dress was worn by a woman or child, the sleeve could indeed be full, as you see on some of the images compared - but they would be gathered in on drawstrings at the bottom (and sometimes in the middle of the upper arm) or to an internal tape band, not to a cuff. You don't start to see sleeves like those on the Rice portrait until the mid-1790s, as shown in the [Tyndall family portrait](http://artuk.org/discover/artworks/thomas-tyndall-with-wife-and-children-185174) ca. 1795), or the [Bridges family portrait](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/constable-the-bridges-family-n06130), 1804.\n\nNow, the waistline. On the Rice portrait, it's extremely high and held in or decorated with a narrow ribbon. In portraiture of children and young girls of the 1780s, we see broader ribbons with the lower edge at the natural waist level. For instance, [Sarah Champneys in this portrait with her mother](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/228065168604294899/), dating to 1789; or [two daughters of the Baillie family](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/gainsborough-the-baillie-family-n00789) in 1784. The very high waist with a narrow ribbon only shows up, again, in the 1790s, as shown in the links in the previous paragraph. You can find some pictures of uncorseted adult women in chemise gowns with very high waistlines in the early 1780s - they point to one by Humphrey from 1782 - but these are rich women at the peak of fashion, who are in a position to defy scandal, like Georgiana Cavendish, [Elisabeth de Bourbon](http://artuk.org/discover/artworks/elisabeth-de-bourbon-17641794-princess-of-france-madame-elisabeth-218170), or [Izabela Lubomirska](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Izabela_Lubomirska.jpg). Jane Austen having an aunt in France who could have theoretically sent her a chemise gown is inconsequential - it was not a garment a thirteen-year-old clergyman's daughter would have been allowed to wear, let alone pose for a hella expensive portrait in.\n\nThe websites both show plenty of paintings dated after 1790s to \"prove\" their point, but this is completely illogical and nonsensical: fashion doesn't work like that. A 1797 portrait of an English princess shows the height of fashion in 1797 - it can't tell you what was fashionable in 1787, or even 1795. It's misleading and deceptive, and frankly it's obnoxious.",

        "text": "[The Nice Guys](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3799694/) was a movie released in May 2016. It follows a Private Detective and Strong Man duo as they search for a missing girl after a mysterious death of a porn star. I really enjoyed the movie! 8/10, go watch it if you like a bit of action comedy that reminds me of an R rated Rush Hour. Anyways....\n\n\nThe movie takes place in **1977**, meaning all they have to do is slip up once and boom! I got a post. Now better, more well trained historians could potentially break down clothing, car models, and dialect, but worse, pettier, pedant badhistorians such as myself are content with the easy stuff, and the excuse to recommend a pretty good movie. \n\nBe warned, all of these are petty.\n\n##1. \n\nWhen entering the bar during the final confrontation (1:38 Time wise), the song Escape is playing on the local stereo. Escape is such a well known song that everyone only knows it by its sub-name: The Pina Colada Song. Its [this one in case that didn't ring a bell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TazHNpt6OTo).  Now this is a problem because this movie takes place in [1977](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nice_Guys#Plot), and this song came out in [1979](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_(The_Pi%C3%B1a_Colada_Song\\)). \n\nNow I know what some of you guys are saying.\n \n&gt; 'Georgeguy007! This song wasn't shown to be directly playing 'in the movie' per se. The directors could have just chosen this song to play over to give the general mood of the scene and drive home the 70s feeling.' \n\nWell you know what I say to that completely valid point? I once did a post on Airplane! For [playing 'Staying Alive'](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/4kx8h4/surely_ugeorgeguy007_isnt_doing_a_post_on/). That's right. I have no shame. Back away slowly from the madman.\n\n- Fun Fact, The Pina Colada Song was the last number one song of the 1970s. [The more you know!](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GD6qtc2_AQA/maxresdefault.jpg)\n\n##2. \n\nI have to hand it to these bums, the next nugget of badhistory is from the trailer, and it was cut from the final movie. So props to Warner Brother Pictures for the most stringent historical standards. Anyways, [this scene in the trailer](https://youtu.be/GQR5zsLHbYw?t=58s) shows the main character smartly replying to a prompt for money with\n\n&gt; It's the/a Recession\n\n[Technically](https://xkcd.com/1475/), its not. According to Wikipedia's list of recessions, [the recessions during the 70s were from 1969-70, 1973-75, and all of 1980](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States). The movies time frame of 1977 nicely misses these windows. \n\nI will give them some credit for the display of worry about gas prices. I honestly found it interesting and looked it up. From 1972-77, the price of gas nearly [tripled](http://inflationdata.com/Inflation/Inflation_Rate/Historical_Oil_Prices_Table.asp). In todays money, it was an increase from $20 to nearly $60. Damn!\n\n##3.\n\n#Small Spoiler Warning\n\nOkay this one may be the most nit picky, which is saying something. The final scene involves are protagonists [arriving at a bar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PAyDzl1-P0) to get a victory drink and celebrate their new business. The problem? I actually was lucky enough to vacation in West Hollywood, and stayed literally a block away from where they were drinking. So after looking into Google Earth's Historic View looker thingamajig, and using the Comedy Store as a point of reference, I concluded that the building they were drinking in was ^*gasp* nonexistent during 1977.\n\n- Here is a blurry photo of the corner during [1989](http://imgur.com/tmWi6Ru), [1994](http://imgur.com/nrncsCv), and [2005](http://imgur.com/9sAs9fw). I'm no expert, but it seems to be green empty lot until 1994. Maybe one of you will say that the picture quality isn't good enough to prove it one way or another, and I won't blame you! It is now the home of the [Cochon555](http://www.amusecochon.com/), a place to eat good pigs apparently. \n\n- I also perused a really awesome database called [Age Of Los Angeles](http://cityhubla.github.io/LA_Building_Age/#17.9/34.09443/-118.37383/0.2). It is a really awesome graphic and it will take up a cool 3 minutes of your time. Unfortunately the building was grayed out, so either it was built 2000+ or the data wasn't public. \n\nSo Warner Brothers were unable to pave down a private business and rebuild a historical accurate 1977s bar in its place. For *Shame*. If we, historians, don't stop them here on the beaches of pedantry, who knows what will.  Next they will have ahistorical ties, or car horns. Or they will use guns from the second World War in a movie about the first World War. Imagine a 80s themed show with clothes from the 90s! The end result? They will take out children out from under us and show them a documentary on 9/11 with everyone using Iphone 7s and listening to music on Walkmans. Have ^they ^^no ^^^shame?\n\nWelp, thats it! Would recommend the movie! Hope you people have a great Christmas and Happy Holidays!",

And then after the war, all of the murders done by the Ku Klux Klan during the reconstruction was definitely not to destabilize the government. \n\n* After the war between the states (which was fully about state rights) the Fenians did not try and use all of the surplus equipment to try and take over Canada to make a sovereign Irish state. Nope, they were all just wanting to reenact some of the battles of the war of 1812 in the most realistic way possible. \n\n* Gavrillo Princip and the rest of the black hand were just a social club, and I am sure that the killing of the heir to the throne of one of the big empires of that day and his wife was completely accidental and was not intended to try and free Yugoslavia. \n\n* The killing of the Israeli team at the Munich Olympics were totally not a terrorist activity.\n\n* The FLQ crisis did not cause widespread, politically motivated panic and force Trudeau into enacting martial law. \n\n* Certainly all of the bombings and throat slitting during the Irish troubles was just a little bit of drunken fun and almost definitely not a violent attempt at independence. \n\n* And what about the hostage takings at the Iranian embassy in London? Or the hostage crisis in the US embassy in Tehran that was going on at the same time? \"It's just a prank, bro.\"\n\n* The bombing of the apartment block in Moscow to which Russia claims to this day was done by Chechnya.

        "text": "Preamble?: This is my first submission to bad history, and I may be doing this wrong. \n\nSo, I was actually looking around for the history subreddit when I came across this:\n\nhttp://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/feature/islam-in-america/\n\nWhich included two items of note:\n\nItem I: \"When Columbus made his journey to the United States, it is said he took with him a book written by Portuguese Muslims who had navigated their way to the New World in the 12th century.\"\n\nI can find absolutely nothing about a book. It might be a reference, an badly stuffed anachronistic one, to the Piri Reis [map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piri_Reis_map#cite_ref-19). However, the first part is much more refutable - the [voyages](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Viajes_de_colon.svg)  of Columbus did not even indirectly reach the United States, unless we count Puerto Rico, Guantanamo Bay, and the Virgin Islands.  \n\nItem 2: \"When the first Muslims came to the land that would become the United States is unclear. Many historians claim that the earliest Muslims came from the Senegambian region of Africa in the early 14th century. It is believed they were Moors, expelled from Spain, who made their way to the Caribbean and possibly to the Gulf of Mexico.\"\n\nRefutal: This most likely alludes to the theories about a Malian fleet which set off to 'explore the limits of the Atlantic'. This itself is mostly, from what I can tell, an afrocentric theory, and the only real source I can find, with no primary sources listed, is [this](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1068950.stm) ancient news article. \n\n\"According to a Malian scholar, Gaoussou Diawara in his book, 'The Saga of Abubakari II...he left with 2000 boats', the emperor gave up all power and gold to pursue knowledge and discovery. Abubakari's ambition was to explore whether the Atlantic Ocean - like the great River Niger that swept through Mali - had another 'bank'...The researchers claim that Abubakari's fleet of pirogues, loaded with men and women, livestock, food and drinking water, departed from what is the coast of present-day Gambia. They are gathering evidence that in 1312 Abubakari II landed on the coast of Brazil in the place known today as Recife.\"\n\nThus, according to what I am assuming is the base for the claim on PBC, they were not expelled Moors, but a King and his navy, who had no real contact with Spain, and who left for Brazil, not the Caribbean or the Gulf of Mexico, which may had come up solely because of afrocentric [claims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olmec_alternative_origin_speculations#African_origins) on the Olmecs.\n\nThe basis for 'expelled from Spain, who made their way to the Caribbean' might also be a confusion with the myth of the Seven Bishops of Oporto and the island of Antillia, which were apparently an old Iberian myth, but I can only find [this](https://books.google.com/books?id=rToSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA234#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) second hand source on the matter, where seven bishops flee from, well, Oporto (later Porto, later the name basis for Portugal) with their male and female followers and all their goods across the ocean and find Antillia and make a nation of seven godly cities on it.\n\nThis might be a cause of double, stacked, and layered 'bad history', where the bad history itself is so badly translated or used it becomes its own second layer.

        "text": "[Here the thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/creepy/comments/5hra62/the_bones_of_the_800_martyrs_of_otranto/)\nNot only can we observe a white washing of religious motivated terror in europe, but OP also is keen on giving ISIS/Islam really a exeptional position when it comes to cruelty.\n\nI start with this little pearl which should undermine his claims about being a history student immediately:\n\n&gt;Vikings (and germanic tribes) are mistery to me they were one of the cause of the destruction of roman empire...they won in a certain sense...then suddenly out of nowhere they went full christian.\n\nVikings destroyed rome. Also suddenly out of nowhere CHRISTIANITY, as OP thinks there were only 8 crusades, I glady present him some more : The northern crusades (many tribes moved up to the baltic sea, after the fall of rome), in which the church expanded its sphere of influence through legitimizing secular claims to power. Have a look at the crusades against the Baltics, Prussians or Stedingers (under Gregor IX).\n\nExample :\nAbsalon the bishop of Roskilde, destroyed the shrine of Svantevit in Arkona, burned down the temple and build a church on it and then \"converted\" the villagers through forced baptism.  \" the power of weapons\" -theologian Hagenbach- The handbook of church history conceded that \"the sword-mission and the word-mission meshed together\". \n\nThe \"hired\" nobility (legitimised by god) made sure slavs, which were denounced as criminals, were either killed or \"converted\". Castellan Cuncelin ordered to hang any slav who walks besides the paths or through deserted areas without a reason.\n\nVoilà, the catholic church now controls Bohemia and the land up to the sea.\n\n&gt;On 11 August, after a 15-day siege, Gedik Ahmed ordered the final assault, which broke through the defenses and captured the citadel. When the walls were breached the Turks began fighting their way through the town. Upon reaching the cathedral \"they found Archbishop Stefano Agricolo [ Stefano Pendinelli ], fully vested and crucifix in hand\" awaiting them with Count Francesco Largo. \"The archbishop was beheaded before the altar, his companions were sawn in half, and their accompanying priests were all murdered.\" After desecrating the Cathedral, they gathered the women and older children to be sold into Albanian slavery. Men over fifteen years old, small children, and infants, were slain. \nISIS is nothing new.\n\nLets not forget that we have a clear agenda here, painting the picture of europe being under attack of malicious muslims since centuries. Some user mention that these killings werent in any form unique or rare during the middle ages. Others bring up the siege of Jerusalem in the year 1099 :  A unimaginable blood bath.\n [source wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Jerusalem_%281099%29)\n\n\"In this temple 10,000 were killed. Indeed, if you had been there you would have seen our feet coloured to our ankles with the blood of the slain. But what more shall I relate? None of them were left alive; neither women nor children were spared\".[16]\" \nAlthough conquerors committing atrocities against the inhabitants of cities taken by storm after a siege was the norm in Medieval warfare, the massacre of the inhabitants of Jerusalem likely exceeded even these standards.\n\nHe goes on:\n\n&gt;In Europe we could not imagine nothing worse than hitler and communism...after the cold war we believed to have it easy now we see this people who are way more cruel than the nazis(**i am not just saying this, i mean it i studied the subject**) and we don t even know how to react.\nAlso such level of violence was uncommon even in the fucked up medieval italy...behading kids of 15 years old, sawing half priests...nah this shit was low even for Medieval standards...\n\nMhm, in that case Im happy to bring another crusade to his attention : The albigensian crusades, in which whole villages were eradicated (Starting with the \"Massacre at Béziers\", some sources mention that in another city, hundreds of people got their tongue cut out, only one man kept his tongue so he can warn other villages which where mainly inhabited by cathars about what is coming for them. \n\nBut If we really want to talk about \"low\" then lets tell the story of Sir John Arundel, on his way to battle, he accommodated his men and himself into a monastery, waiting for a better wind, they raped all of the nuns and looted the whole place, he then sacked another church, raided a wedding and collaboratively raped the bridal. After that the forced some nuns on their ships as sex slaves, which were thrown overboard as a storm began to brew. The ship ultimately crashed into the cliffs.\n\nThe act of killing the false priests of the enemies is a very symbolic act, which we find in many sources during history, everyone since the uprising of religions was doing it, the assyrians, romans, christians, muslims, etc. Lets not forget that religions, as all masses, firstly seek to expand and win followers, killing the enemies priests breakes with the reign and religion of the former holders and are the symbolic start of an assimilation. \n\nI believe it is not a coincidence that most historians specialised on this subject wouldnt want to live during that time period, Nietzsche described it as the \"the alcoholic poisoning of Europe\", it certainly was a very violent and crude time.  \n\nAbout Oskar Dirlewanger: \n\n&gt;We are far from the shit we see in Iraq. He was a monster, but a different kind even an inferior one compared to the violence displayed by those of the ISIS.\n\nI think mexican cartels are as creative as isis. \n\n&gt;He was an oddity even in the nazis scenario, he was an outcast his soldiers ex convicts.\nI tell you one story: the invention of the gas chamber as a tool of mass genocide by the nazis was made after a specific episode involving Himmler: he was witnessing a mass execution of jews in the eastern front, the soldier used to shoot the jews in the area between the neck and the head, in that specific occasion a soldier messed up and shoot the poor victim right to the head...the head exploded pieces of brain hit Himmler to the face, he nearly fainted. This episode may be one of the cause for the adoption of gas chambers: executions were too shocking for the german soldier(i doubt they concerned about jews) who were often drunk while doing this horrible task.\nhttps://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1535735/newly-discovered-diary-reveals-bloodlust-of-top-nazi-heinrich-himmler-who-almost-fainted-when-a-jews-brain-splattered-on-his-clothes/\n\nA italian/german ? history student linking the Sun.\n\n&gt;Everyone who put all the religion on the same level ignore what religions are: a set of ideas, and 2 different sets may different values and be more or less destructive.\nEveryone are dicks to everyone else, and it's pretty easy to paint any group\nYes, **but I can't not notice how christians made 8 crusades and how muslim made hundred or thousand of jihad against the western world alone**.\nas horrible barbarians if you pluck the right incidents out of the history books\nWe may have different meaning of the word incident.\nAlso I don't dislike islam because of history books, i dislike it because of the shit I read in my newspaper every day.\n\n\n\n\nIt finally gets political :\n&gt; My unviersity has armed guards, my metro is watched by the army...it is like a warzone, and yet if you critisize the mass immigration policies you are an evil racist...this is not even about ideology it is instinct of self preservation.\n\n&gt; Well this is probably the only good side of modern western globalism.\nSame rules for everyone, no difference on the basis of skin colour ethnicity, freedom of religion of sex orientation ecc... The problem is that most of muslim countries and their own people don't want that...they don't want to be part of the happy globalist family, or better, they want to be above it.\n\n&gt; I just wish we could isolate them and letting them live in their distopia. Maybe in a million year they will eventually understand that it may be wrong...\nYou know what it is really sad...even if the succeed in their objective of make the whole world muslim, then they will start killing each other on the basis of how to interpet their book...just like they are doing in the middle east. They are hopeless.\n\nAs an Austrian I find it atrocious to see so many of these perfidious attempts on this website. Their only goal is it to place ISIS or conquerors of the islamic world on the level with the NS-regime and the Holocaust. The nazis murderous machinery is unparalleled.\n",

        "text": "In my day job I work on some history magazines, and one of my many pleasures is having to \"explain\" why we \"got things wrong\" to Holocaust deniers, Irish slavery enthusiasts, Lost Causers, and now Afrocentricists. What we did was [illustrate Cleopatra for the cover](https://www.imagineshop.co.uk/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/5e06319eda06f020e43594a9c230972d/u/n/unnamed_7.jpg), but some people weren't happy, because we'd chosen to depict Cleopatra as white. (TBH I'd have preferred her more tanned to head off some of the milder criticism, but whatever - high status Greek women would have stayed out of the sun anyway)\n\nPresented for you enjoyment are the highlights of this whole awful exchange [from Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/AllAboutHistory/photos/a.257315171079690.1073741829.256825224462018/974078389403361/?type=3&amp;comment_id=974549476022919&amp;comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R%22%7D), subtly edited for the sake of your attention span.\n\n&gt;Why is Cleopatra depicted as a white person?\n\nGreat question - thank you for asking. There's a great deal of debate about Cleopatra's heritage, and it's definitely plausible that she could have had some Semitic or sub-Saharan ancestry but that's speculation and we wanted to stick as closely as we could to what we know. The Ptolemiac dynasty were Macedonian (in the Ancient Greek sense, rather than the modern sense) and notoriously insular (and incestuous) interlopers who held themselves apart from their Egyptian subjects. Cleopatra was the first Ptolemiac ruler who could actually speak Egyptian, they were that haughty and aloof!\n\nContemporary sources aren't hugely helpful in arguing either case. Roman writers saw things in terms of culture rather than race, so even if she had appeared fully Hellenic (and therefore incredibly familiar in language, manners, values etc) they would have happily othered her as an exotic outsider. Contemporary Egyptian art doesn't depict the Ptolemiac Pharaohs in a distinct way from earlier kings - which could be seen as evidence that they were Semitic, but the Ptolemies, for all their superiority, took care to present themselves in the correct manner and ensure that they were seen as \"authentically Pharaonic\". A good comparison would be Egyptian depictions of Alexander the Great, whose conquest of Egypt put the dynasty in place (Ptolemy was one of his bodyguard).\n\nThe extent to which the Ptolemies were a Hellenic culture at the heart of Ancient Egypt is a fascinating one. Essentially Cleopatra was almost certainly of majority Macedonian descent and so we chose to depict her with strong Mediterranean features. \n\n&gt;Your problem is that you assume that the Macedonians and Semitics were WHITE WHEN THEY WERE NOT! The evidence is in actual pictures and murals BY THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS OF THEM, DEPICTING THE SEMITES AS A BLACK/BROWN PEOPLE! There is no such thing \"Mediterranean features\" because modern Mediterranean peoples ARE NOT THE SAME GENETIC PEOPLE AS THE ONES FROM THE TIME PERIOD OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS!\n\nIt turns out that first question wasn't actually a question in any sense that we would recognise, it was a portal to a dimension of fringe history madness. Anyway:\n\nI didn’t describe Cleopatra as being Semitic, I said there was is a case to be made that she was part-Semitic or part-Sub-Saharan African, but that’s not something we know for certain. We chose to depict Cleopatra with a “Mediterranean” look precisely because of that ambiguity.\n\n&gt;The Macedonians WERE NOT WHITE PEOPLE! If you don't believe me, LOOK AT AUTHENTIC PORTRAITS AND MURALS OF THEM! Even REAL PORTRAITS OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT, DEPICT SOMEONE THAT IS BROWN SKINNED AND NON-WHITE! \"\n\nI’m assuming the portraits of Alexander the Great you’re referring to are the [Alexander mural in Pompeii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Mosaic#/media/File:Alexander_the_Great_mosaic.jpg) as that’s dark haired and tanned, although I wouldn’t say that was compelling evidence that he was non-white. If you’re thinking of something else, let me know.\n\n*If you can think of any other depictions that could be helping support the \"Alexander was ~~a Brother~~ black\" narrative, let me know* (Edit: Was inappropriate, I'm genuinely sorry for my poor judgement. This is a fraught enough subject without me using the tools of the racist. Thanks to u/probablyaname for calling me out on it.)\n\nFunnily enough, Plutarch (who we go to for much of our knowledge of Alexander) criticised some depictions of him as \"too dark and swarthy. Whereas he was of a fair colour, as they say, and his fairness passed into ruddiness on his breast particularly, and in his face.”\n\nOther depictions of Alexander are much paler, including [these](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/8._The_Stag_Hunt_mosaic_from_Pella.jpg) [two](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Pella_Lion_Hunt_Mosaic.jpg) Hellenic examples:\n\nThe fairness/redness of his hair is interesting too, as Pseudo-Callisthenes identifies him as blonde or tawny (\"For he had the hair of a lion”) and Aelian describes him as blonde (\"his Hair curled naturally, and was yellow\").\n\nUltimately, I’d like to add a gentle reminder that whiteness and non-whiteness is a modern concept and not something that Alexander the Great or Cleopatra, or any of the chroniclers who wrote about them, would have recognised or been particularly concerned about.\n\n&gt;There is no evidence that someone of her complexion could survive the high temperature and high sunlight environment of Ancient Egypt, ergo by that logic SHE HAD TO BE BLACK OR EXTREMELY DARK SKINNED OR NON-WHITE!\n\nI had to re-read this several times, because each time I finished I became instantly convinced I had imagined it. The news that white people cannot survive high temperature and high sunlight environments will be fantastic news for the Indigenous Australians of 1787. Just hang in there guys, they'll be dead in days!\n\nI mean is Egypt some sort of Star Wars like lava-world? Did Napoleon have to wear a special suit? I didn't even know where to start with this one. It's very difficult responding to something that stupid without appearing condescending. Luckily I'm among friends here, right?\n\n&gt;If you people are going to make false asinine and fraudulent portraits and pictures depicting A FALSE DUPLICITOUS VERSION OF HISTORY, PLEASE MAKE THAT CLEAR! Because idiocy such as \"Mediterranean features\" has to BE BACKED BY PHYSICAL GENETIC AND SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE!\n\nDepictions of historical characters don’t “have” to be backed by genetic evidence, because in the vast majority of cases this evidence does not exist. Instead we have to make do with primary and secondary sources, and from that build the best possible interpretation mindful of biases and context.\n\nI didn't add anything about the reconstruction of (what might be) Arsinoe, because my hope of hope is that they'll bring it up later and I can devote a whole reply to saying, effectively:\n\na) Cleopatra and Arsinoe were *half*-sisters, so relying on her for Cleopatra's skin colour is flawed\nb) We don't know for certain that it is Arsinoe, so relying on her for Cleopatra's skin colour is flawed\n\nLet me know if I've erred anywhere, ancient history is not my comfort zone.\n\nSources: *Cleopatra: A Biography* by Duane W Roller and *Alexander the Great* by Robin Lane Fox",

Only 5% owned slaves, and they were (to put it in modern terms) the corporate overlords of the antebellum south. \n\nHe doesn't source his statistic (of course), but this is at best misleading, or more accurately wrong.  In 1860, [25% of households in slave states owned slaves](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4al3zm/approximately_how_many_americans_owned_at_least/d11lksg/).  A household might have the father, the owner of the slaves, plus his wife and any number of kids.  While the wife and kids do not own the slaves in a technical sense, they would have participated in the management of them, and benefited from their labor.\n\n&gt;An average southerner (average meaning non-slave owning in this context) would be required to go on slave hunts every few weeks much like we have jury duty these days, and it was appreciated about the same.\n\n[citation needed]  While my search was far from academic, I cannot find any citation of people being regularly pressed into slave hunts.  Mostly these were performed by state militias and military academies.\n\nAnd the comment goes on...\n\n&gt;They also realized slaves were working all the low wage jobs that they might really like to get, since they can't compete with the big slaveholders. Essentially, think of being a worker at McDonald's whose job gets taken over by automation, and every few weeks you have to go fix up that robot without being paid for it.",

Because of its light weight, it found very little use on the battlefields of the 16th and 17th centuries. The swords carried into battle tended to be much heavier as many of the weapons found on the battlefields of that time would have overwhelmed such subtle and sophisticated weapon as the rapier. Rapier techniques deviated drastically from the techniques of the heavier military blades As such, although swords were used on the battlefield, rapier fighting is a personal, not a military discipline.\n\nOffence #1:\n\n&gt;its light weight\n\n[Rapiers aren't particularly light](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efZLw-tlIOs). [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapier) lists the average mass of a rapier to be around 1 kg. There was also a [wide range](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrtnDRDPFZw) of [specifications](http://historisches-fechten.at/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Comparison_of_Period_Rapiers_to_Modern_Reproductions.pdf) for the weapon. [This specific rapier](http://wallacelive.wallacecollection.org/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&amp;module=collection&amp;objectId=61063&amp;viewType=detailView) from the Wallace collection weighs in at 1.62 kg, which is within the average weight range of a run-of-the-mill longsword. The average weight of [rapiers in the Wallace Collection](https://np.reddit.com/r/SWORDS/comments/5cb9a4/rapiers_wallace_collection_vs_repros/) is 1.22 kg, not much more than a [medieval arming sword](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fy8rhlK3kNY), and well within the [weight range of most one-handed swords](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03HIYgLWGu0).\n\nOffence #2:\n\n&gt;it found very little use on the battlefields\n\nSee the [first video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efZLw-tlIOs) linked. Rapiers are all-purpose swords.\n\nOffence #3:\n\n&gt;swords carried into battle tended to be much heavier\n\nSee Offence #1. Contemporary swords were not much heavier; the average weight of a [Schiavona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basket-hilted_sword#Schiavona) is pretty similar to that of a rapier. The [backsword](http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/wew/fencing/blades.html) shown in this set of photos to contrast the rapiers isn't particularly light or heavy compared to them.\n\nOffence #4:\n\n&gt;many of the weapons found on the battlefields of that time would have overwhelmed such subtle and sophisticated weapon\n\n[Rapiers are substantial and not easy to cut through or snap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6VB2hQJhqg). Also, [Salvator Fabris](http://www.bankeside.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=100&amp;Itemid=562) shows how fight against pole weapons using a rapier in his [treatise on its use](http://wiktenauer.com/wiki/Salvator_Fabris). While pole weapons would indeed have a huge advantage, the same can be said about any other kind of sword.\n\nOffence #5:\n\n&gt;As such, although swords were used on the battlefield, rapier fighting is a personal, not a military discipline.\n\nThe same could be said about many other systems of sword fighting.

        "text": "r/enoughcommiespam is the gift that keeps on giving. \n\nThis post was...rather more insane then the previous one.\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/EnoughCommieSpam/comments/5giwq5/rip_the_democratic_party/datr1tk/\n\n&gt;Social Democrats got 7 million votes in the November 1932 parliamentary election, communists got 6 million. If they were to join forces they would have had more than the Nazis and could have blocked Hitler from power, but just like the USSR always did, they fomented discord and the Soviet Comintern forbade German communists from allying with the center left.\nThey thought this would give them war between fascists and liberals that would benefit the USSR, because the tenets of the ridiculous historical materialism told them it would. So they also helped Germany circumvent the Versailles treaty, helped them test tanks and develop arms, and finally aided them as they invaded Poland and France, giving them a oil, manganese, rubber, and grain for the war effort.\n\n&gt;you mean when Social democrats killed Rosa Luxembourg and Karl Liebknecht?\nWhy is it that the liberal societies are the only ones held to the impossible standard that they shouldn't do anything when their existence is threatened? They were trying to bring on full rebellion.\n\n\n\n&gt;Social Democrats got 7 million votes in the November 1932 parliamentary election, communists got 6 million. If they were to join forces they would have had more than the Nazis and could have blocked Hitler from power\n\nThis is partially true in that if both the SPD and KPD had joined together they would've had more votes then the Nazis. But they would have only held 38% of the seats in parliament; they still would've needed to form a coalition with someone else. And the problem was that all the remaining parties in parliament were more right-wing then them and would more likely have supported a Nazi coalition - like the effectively eventually did - then a socialist one. In any case, a failure to form a government would've just played it out like it actually did, with Hindenburg and von Papen appointing Hitler as Chancellor on the idea that he could be coopted. The structure of the German state was already too corrupted for anything short of a majority victory to have made a substantial difference.\n\n&gt;but just like the USSR always did, they fomented discord and the Soviet Comintern forbade German communists from allying with the center left.\n\nThis is true in regards with the third period, but it was actually the Comintern who in the 1920s was forcing the KPD into the comparatively unpopular position of forcing the KPD to try to work with the SPD under the United Front. Assuming the KPD was not a part of the Comintern, it's likely they would've not supported the SPD anyway since they hated each other so much.\n\n&gt;They thought this would give them war between fascists and liberals that would benefit the USSR\n\nUh....what? The USSR was afraid that the Nazis were going to ally with the West against the USSR (which considering the stance of many conservative politicians was not out of the realm of possibility, and even liberal politicians until the invasion of Poland considered the USSR the greater menace). It makes no sense for the USSR to have elevated Hitler considering they believed Fascism was directly created by capitalists to crush socialism. Even assuming that the USSR would not the be the first target of Fascism, the Stalinist Comintern didn't see a war between liberals and fascists as a realistic possibility until it actually happened since under their logic they were both basically capitalists.\n\nAnd the USSR most definitely did not want a war - keep in mind that the Third Period began in 1928, so the USSR would have had to plan this out a full eleven years before World War 2 actually started. The first five year plan had not even started until 1928, let alone the industrialization that actually enabled the USSR to fight world war 2 on equal terms with Germany. \n\nAs well, the KPD was the largest \"communist\" party in Europe at that time - it's not like some insignificant thing that could be sacrificed for the greater good, so the idea that the USSR elevated Hitler to power is especially baffling.\n\n&gt; because the tenets of the ridiculous historical materialism told them it would. \n\nI have literally no idea what this is supposed to mean. The USSR thought that inter-imperialist wars would benefit socialism - as indeed ended up happening with both of them - but I don't really think they felt the need to actually start them, nor am I aware of anything written by a Marxist that said anything about the inevitability of a war between fascism and liberalism. \n\n&gt;So they also helped Germany circumvent the Versailles treaty\n\nThis is true but this was happening in the 1920s, long before the Nazis, and had more to do with the USSR's desire for money in the aftermath of the Civil War then any ideological principles.\n\n&gt; and finally aided them as they invaded Poland\n\nKind of true. The USSR obviously invaded Poland, but it wasn't really the coordinated effort this implies. The USSR only intervened once it was obvious the invasion was successful and didn't really coordinate militarily with the Germans, the only coordination was diplomatic in the form of the Molotov-Ribbentrop treaty.\n\n&gt;and France\n\nUm...what? The USSR did not aid the Germans in invading France. \n\n&gt;giving them a oil, manganese, rubber, and grain for the war effort.\n\nAccurate, the USSR did sign a commercial agreement in 1939 at the same time as the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact and revised in 1940, but it wasn't for the reasons that were implied. Namely, the Nazis were not being traded with to give them war material so as to destroy liberalism and allow the USSR to profit, but because once again the USSR wanted money to buy industry with. \n\n&gt;Why is it that the liberal societies are the only ones held to the impossible standard that they shouldn't do anything when their existence is threatened? They were trying to bring on full rebellion.\n\nThis is extremely, extremely disingenuous. It is known for a fact that the newly formed KPD had zero plans for a rebellion in 1918-1919. In the 1918 revolution the government had been overthrown and placed in the hands of workers' councils, which were dominated by the SPD. The SPD however was spouting one line in public to the effect of actually implementing socialism, which most people thought the SPD sincerely wanted, and another line in private to the effect that the state and economy were to remain mostly the same - to the extent that Friederich Ebert promised that the Army was to remain a \"law unto itself\". \n\nHowever the state was still in the hand of revolutionaries - mostly supporters of the SPD who were mostly unaware of their conservatism (remember the SPD was still touting itself as the party of Marx, Engels, and Lasalle), with a minority of more radical socialists in the USPD and the more left-wing KPD. So more or less Ebert and his defense minister Gustav Noske decided to try to provoke the left into doing something they could crack down on. Already the SPD was starting to lose control of it's own supporters who in December were growing restless at the lack of real change.\n\nSo in January of 1919, Police commissioner for Berlin Emil Eichorn who was a member of the USPD was dismissed. The KPD and USPD naturally called a protest. The reaction however was far out of proportion to what they expected and hundreds of thousands of demonstrators turned up to a protest that rapidly became a general outlet for anger at the slow pace of the revolution; doubtless many of them were SPD supporters unaware of the true attitude of the party leaders. The protest turned into a spontaneous - but at this point mostly unarmed and popular - uprising, with government buildings being occupied and Noske and Ebert fleeing Berlin. It is important to stress at this point once again that the uprising was not planned by anyone, nor was it a coup d'etat. It was a spontaneous and popular revolt. The KPD was divided on whether the protestors should try to seize power; Karl Leibknecht supported it and Rosa Luxemburg felt it was premature. Both however supported the protestors in opposition to the government. The USPD was more cautious and tried to engage in negotiations with the SPD to defuse the situation - walking out in disgust however when it emerged that the SPD had called in groups of ex-soldiers called the Freikorps to forcefully crush the demonstrations. \n\nAt this point the demonstration was losing momentum and most of the soldiers who supported it deserted. This was the point at which the Freikorps, a fully military force backed by Mark-IV tanks, slowly approached Berlin through the suburbs to crush mostly unarmed demonstrators. The end result was a few days of fighting, resulting in 17 killed from the Freikorps and up to 3000 civilians killed. Leibknecht and Luxemburg, who had not planned the uprising nor done anything other then give intellectual support to it, were murdered by the Freikorps, and according to the testimony of Waldemar Pabst done so on the direct orders of Noske and Ebert - who in any case were guilty of tacit consent to their extrajudicial murders, and after a rigged trial the murderers were acquitted, with the once exception given a hilariously low sentence of two years in prison. Waldemar Pabst who was actually in charge of the murders was never even arrested. Then Leo Jogiches who was Luxemburg's sometime lover and an important SPD then KPD member was murdered by the police for investigating the murder - the government at first attempted to claim the two were murdered by an angry mob.\n\nThe overall effect of a military attack on their own constituents was that the SPDs support immediately fell by half in the next election a year later.\n\nIn any case, this was not a case of some terrorists plotting a coup d'etat against a liberal democracy, this was the state ordered murder of political opponents for leading popular protest against them. Even to those who are not socialists, this should be an embarrassment.\n\n\n\nSources:\n\nThe Letters of Rosa Luxemburg, Rosa Luxemburg\n\n\"What does the Spartacus League Want?\", Rosa Luxemburg\n\n\"Our Program and Political Situation\", Rosa Luxemberg\n\n\"Order Reigns in Berlin\", Rosa Luxemburg\n\nThe Rosa Luxemburg Reader, Peter Hudis\n\nSocialism Unbound, Stephen Bronner\n\nIron Kingdom: The Rise and Fall of Prussia, Christopher Clark\n\nThe Lost Revolution, Chris Harman\n\nThe Rise and Fall of Communism, Archie Brown\n\nSocialism, Michael Harrington\n\nComrades!, Robert Service\n\nThe Red Flag, David Priestland\n\nDark Continent, Mark Mazower\n\nTo Hell and Back, Ian Kershaw\n\nThe Age of Extremes, Eric Hobsbawm ",

Kind of a big mistake.\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n&gt;Same story as 1933 Germany\n\nWell, no, not really. The United States isn't at all like 1933 Germany. More importantly however, the dates are wrong - the German election that actually brought Hitler to power was in 1932. The 1933 election was a failed attempt for Hitler to secure an absolute majority and was marked by widespread intimidation and irregularities since Hitler was effectively in power already.\n\n&gt;the communist supported parties attacked the center-left parties\n\nPartially true. More specifically however only the Comintern allied KPD embraced the \"Third-period\" strategy of labeling the SPD as Social-Fascists.  The small but not insignificant Right and Left oppositions both advocated a United Front of KPD and SPD. This requires further explication: the United Front was a tactic advocated by the Comintern in the mid 1920s after the failure of the post-war revolutionary upsurge. It basically said that Comintern supported parties should ally with reformist socialists in non-revolutionary situations because that was where the mass of the workers were at, and by presenting themselves as the militant edge of the workers' movement they would gain support. \n\nThe Popular Front was developed after 1934 and it was basically a cynical tool of Soviet foreign policy: namely that \"official\" communists should ally with every single other party who was anti-fascist regardless of political ideology solely so that fascists would not come to power. Revolutionary goals were dropped and they became in effect social democrats (indeed in some cases social democrats such as the SPUSA were actually more radical since they demanded immediate reforms whereas the Communists told them to be patient). This also involved outright being anti-revolutionary as when they turned against the French General Strike of 1934 and the Spanish Revolution of 1936.\n\nBack to the story however, the KPD had actually been trying to forge a coalition with the SPD for years, without much success. This was also widely unpopular since the SPD had allied with the Freikorps in 1918-1919 and effectively used them as a death squad to crush the left-wing revolution. The SPD also used force to disband Communist elected state governments, and was generally unreceptive to the KPD. It's an open question if a United Front was actually possible in 1933 considering how much the two hated each other. In 1932 when the state government of Prussia was illegally dissolved by Franz von Papen, the KPD proposed a joint general strike. The SPD refused in favor of pursuing legal action which only won them a partial victory. \n\nMore to the point, simply creating a Popular Front like the poster suggests tended to be a short-term solution. While it increased the political respectability of \"official\" communism, it also tended to blunt it's edge as an effective force. And by removing it from being primarily concerned with the workers' movement it also tended to just make it a vaguely opposition party. Finally the emphasis on moderation and alliance with out and out pro-capitalist parties badly handicapped the Communists from doing anything effective. The French Strikes of 1934 and Spanish Revolution were simply rejected, and in the case of the Spanish Revolution was literally suppressed by the Communist backed Popular Front. The French Popular Front was notably ineffective and didn't accomplish much of anything due to their unwillingness to make any radical reforms (for comparison the USA was engaged in a far more radical program of economic reconstruction). In the United States, the CPUSA managed to gain a controlling vote in the CIO (which was important at the time as it contained around 40% of the Union membership of the USA), but when the CIO voted to found a Labor Party, the CPUSA decisively voted against it in favor of continuing a coalition with the Democrats - who turned against them in the late 1940s and effectively banned them and expelled them from the unions.\n\n&gt;attacked the center-left parties because the far-right was going to be so bad that people would see its obvious you need socialists in power\n\nThis is completely backwards. The SPD had been dominating the government since the 1918 revolution until 1930; not a liberal government that the SPD had the chance to replace. In that time it managed to completely squander it's support which directly allowed the far-right to grow in power. It was not so bad in the 1920s but they were completely wrecked when the Depression hit. In 1930 the German Trade Unions asked the SPD to support a public works program and increased welfare. The SPD flatly refused since they were unwilling to run up that much debt. The SPD also infamously promised to increase welfare but then voted to spend the money on battleships instead, which destroyed popular support in favor of the far-right. It is not that the Left lost Germany by attacking the Social Democrats, it is that the Social Democrats lost Germany. Indeed such was the loss of popular momentum of the SPD that if the Nazis had not gained power it is not inconceivable that the SPD would've been in a junior position to the KPD since the SPD was hemorrhaging votes that the KPD was picking up. No one was voting for the SPD to stop the Nazis.\n\nFinally, Hitler didn't even win the popular vote. He was appointed by the German right which had effectively run the country as a dictatorship since 1930 passing laws by decree under President Hindenburg (who the SPD supported), under the idea that the right could use him. The authoritarian structures that Hitler abused were already in place, and the SPD was simply not willing to mount any real challenge to them.\n\n**Sources**\n\nThe Anatomy of Fascism, Robert Paxton\n\nThe Struggle Against Fascism in Germany, Leon Trotsky\n\nIron Kingdom: The Rise and Fall of Prussia, Christopher Clark\n\nThe Lost Revolution, Chris Harman\n\nA History of Fascism, Stanley Payne\n\nFascism, Roger Eatwell\n\nIt Didn't Happen Here, Seymour Lipstet\n\nFreedom From Fear, David Kennedy\n\nSocialism, Michael Harrington\n\nA Short History of Socialism, George Lichtheim\n\nComrades!, Robert Service\n\nThe Red Flag, David Priestland\n\nDark Continent, Mark Mazower\n\nTo Hell and Back, Ian Kershaw\n\nThe Battle for Spain, Antony Beevor\n\nThe Age of Extremes, Eric Hobsbawm",

That means not declaring on a player Theodoro in 1450 as a Muscovy-Ottomans alliance (though declaring at the Austria-France alliance would be fine), or wrecking your nation by no-CBing all your neighbours as France when you lose a war. Player conflict is fine, but ‘winning the game’ is not the goal.\n\n * also, balance of power benefits everyone\nso keep powerful players in check\n\n * You can claim nations below, however you must be there when we start, or else that claim falls away\n\n * We use an unofficial gaming badhistory (sorry mods, it just became a thing after TS went down) Discord to communicate [Permanent link here](https://discordapp.com/invite/N7FAvTr)\n\n * To join, you will have to be on the [Badhistory steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/badhistory)\n\nThe game were going to play is Europa Universalis 4, Incase you are not aware.\n",

It's a new version of ~~\"the graph\"~~ **\"the chart\"**.\n\nQuick R5 :\n\nThis graph is absurd. It makes no sens to classify \"human accomplishment over time\" in such a small graph. Almost 2000 years of human development in only a 1199 pixels wide graph ?\n\nAnd why does the graph starts just before 600 BC and stop abruptly around 1900 ? What does \"year of birth\" of Human Advancements even mean ?\n\nFor most of History, the graph seems to say that Europeans basically did 95% of everything. That is absurd as well and only shows the way of accounting for \"human advancement\" is heavily eurocentric. The division between \"European\", \"Asian\" (in yellow, of course) and \"other\" progress is comically absurd.\n\nAnd, of course, that drop between 200 BC and 1400.\nThe idea of a loss of knowledge and progress in \"the Dark Ages\". But this \"Dark Ages\" is very, needlessly, unsettlingly ***LONG***. \n\nWhy would a \"Dark Age\" begin right before the formation of the Roman Empire ? Then Europe hits rock bottom around 800 and immediately bounce back. All in all, this graph shows a great progression during the whole Middle Ages, until the 1400s where Europe retakes its place as the World's greatest creator of Human Advancement®.\n\nIt is stupid, of course, because great knowledge was not lost in Europe between the Greek Antiquity and the 1400s. You can thank the Monks for that. Also the Byzantines and... the Arabs. Where are the Arabs on the graph by the way ? In \"Others\" ? Come on !\n\nWhat is \"human advancement\" anyway ? No explanation. Oh wait... It's actually from a book.\n\n[Now what the fuck is this](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/282085.Human_Accomplishment). So it's the number of great scientists and artists, apparently. This guy is playing Civilization V. \n\nAnd of course, he only counts the guys he heard of, as an American from Iowa. \n\nOh, there's also Wikipedia pages about him and his book. I'll let you read it because I already wasted enough time with this nonsense. [Charles Murray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Murray_(political_scientist\\)) ~~(I can' link it properly because at the (((parenthesis))) at the end...)~~ and [this thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Accomplishment).\n\nThis is already dumb. But the tweet took the dumbness to a unprecedented level. Maybe this graph is also an Human Advancement. \n\nEdit : By the way, the whole twitter of the guy is a gold mine. No, it's more of a shit mine. Anyway, it's full of /r/badeverything.\n\nEdit 2 : I'm not even sorry about the English mistakes. \n\nEdit 3 : **[The culprit is now aware of our existence.](https://twitter.com/KirkegaardEmil/status/804837880388603904)**",

So, I take a look at it. What do I see? [A topic on the Maya](http://www.thelostcivilizations.info/2016/11/06/mayan-culture-origins-hieroglyphics-documentary/)? Let's see what he's gotten wrong.\n\nEdit: this isn't the [first time](https://np.reddit.com/r/AncientCivilizations/comments/5bffkh/here_are_some_facts_about_the_mayan_civilization/) I've corrected this user\n\n---\n    \n&gt; the Olmecs, the oldest culture in Mesoamerica\n\nThere are several cultures that are older or contemporaneous to the Olmec. The Mokaya (Blake and Clark 1999), Capacha (Kelly 1980; Mountjoy 1994) , Matanchen (Mountjoy 1970, 2000; Mountjoy and Claassen 2005), El Opeño (Oliveros 1970, 1974), and Monte Alto cultures (Parsons and Jenson 1965; Demarest, Switsur, and Berger 1982), for example.\n\n&gt; Olmecs settled along the Gulf of Mexico and began building great cities of stone and brick. \n\nThey had dirt mounds (Cyphers 1997; Diehl 981). The Red Palace has some basalt columns, but most of it is dirt.\n\n&gt; Though no one knows where the Olmecs came from, nor what happened to them, they lay the foundation for all the future civilizations in Mesoamerica.\n\nThey came from Archaic populations in the region (Wilkerson 1981). They are the culmination of centuries of cultural development in the region. They didn't come from anywhere else but where they already lived.\n\nAs for where they went, they continued to develop culturally and became the Epi-Olmec (Pool 2000).\n\nThey also did not lay down the foundation for all Mesoamerican civilizations. West Mexican civilizations, for example, diverge greatly from their eastern cousins. There is little to no Olmec material that has been recovered in West Mexico despite no physical barriers preventing people from moving and trading. West Mexico simply drew upon their own ancestral cultures such as Capacha and El Opeño.\n\n&gt; important cultural elements of the region were disseminated such as writing, mathematics, astronomy and the development of the calendar; all of which the Maya would refine.\n\nIt's somewhat debatable since the Olmec didn't write any of this. There's the Cascajal Block, but it hasn't been confirmed to be writing exactly. It could be writing, looks like writing to some, but cannot be read (Magni 2008). And it looks very different from Zapotec, Maya, or Epi-Olmec writing. The oldest Long Count date comes from Tres Zapotes, that's true, but it dates to the Late Formative long after what we would consider Olmec.\n\n&gt; The Plumed Serpent god  Kukulkan (also known as Gucamatz) was the most popular deity among the Maya. \n\nWe don't refer to the feathered serpent at Teotihuacan as Quetzalcoatl or Kukulkan because we don't know what Teotihuacanos called it. How is the feather serpent the consort of the Goddess? Where has that been established?\n\n&gt; During this time the great urban centers rose across the land and the Maya numbered in the millions\n\nYou put this in the El Tajin section, but mention the Maya. The Maya did not inhabit El Tajin. And you need to provide a source on the population estimate if you're going to say millions.\n\n&gt; The very important ball game which came to be known as Poc-a-Toc was developed and more ball courts have been found in and around the city of El Tajin than anywhere else in the region. \n\nWhile El Tajin may have had its own variation of the Mesoamerican ball game, keep in mind that ball courts have been found that predate El Tajin. The Teuchitlan culture, for example, built ballcourts beginning in the Late Formative to Early Classic periods. \n\n&gt; The Classic Maya Period: 250-950 CE – This is the era which saw the consolidation of power in the great cities of the Yucatec Maya such as Chichen Itza and Uxmal. \n\nYou should make a note that both Chichen Itza and Uxmal were founded in the Late Classic (600 AD, Chichen - 850 AD - Uxmal) and survived until the early Postclassic (13th century, Chichen - 1100 AD, Uxmal)\n        \n&gt; Direct cultural influences may be seen, in some sites, from the Olmecs and the Zapotecs and the cultural values of Teotihuacan and El Tajin\n\nWhat are these influences? You need to establish that. Especially with the Zapotec, El Tajin, and Olmec.\n\n&gt; This period was the height of the Maya civilization in which they perfected mathematics, astronomy, architecture and the visual arts and also refined and perfected the calendar.\n\nHow did they perfect these things? And how did they differ from the Preclassic? Or Postclassic?\n\n&gt; The oldest date recorded in this era is on Stele 29 in the city of Tikal (292 CE)\n\nEl Baúl (Ochoa and Lee 1983; Marcus 1976) and Takalik Abaj (Riese 1988; Stuart 2004) both have older dates and both are Maya\n\n&gt; The Post-Classic Period: 950-1524 CE – At this time the great cities of the Maya were abandoned.\n\nSome were, some weren't. The Postclassic thrived, as well (Chase 1992; Chase and Chase 2006; Masson, Hare, and Peraza Lope 2006; Sabloff 2007; Jones 1998). It may not be as well known and published as the Classic period, but it is just as important if not more so since the Postclassic Maya were who the Spanish encountered\n\n&gt; The Toltecs, a new tribe in the region, took over the vacant urban centers and re-populated them. At this time, Tula and Chichen-Itza became dominant cities in the region.\n\nThe Toltecs were not in the Maya region. And they did not \"take over\" anything. The topic is still hotly debated and part of it is because there is this is a common misconception based on early archaeological work where people visited Tula before they visited Chichen. They saw some similarities between the two and concluded Tula influenced Chichen, but did so without any sort of dating. Radiocarbon dating, however, suggests sometime more complicated. The sites are contemporaneous in terms of architectural style and Chichen may actually be a little bit earlier (Kowalski and Kristan-Graham 2007). So we don't know who influenced who. It could very well have been Chichen on Tula. Both scenarios, though, are unlikely. The Epiclassic was a period of upheaval and change. People latched onto whatever they could to secure power and part of that power stemmed from art and architecture. There are so many common elements in this period that we refer to this art style,as the International style.\n\n&gt; the widely popular conception that the Maya were driven from their cities by the Spanish Conquest is erroneous as the cities were already vacant by the time of the Spanish invasion (in fact, the Spanish conquerors had no idea the natives they found in the region were responsible for the enormous complexes of the cities). The Quiche Maya were defeated at the Battle of Utatlan in 1524 CE and this date traditionally marks the end of the Maya Civilization.\n\nOne sentence you say the cities were abandoned, but the next you say a battle took place at Q'umarkaj (Utatlan) which is a city. I'm afraid you are following the popular misconception that there were no Maya cities occupied when there were. It took many years of fighting for the Spanish to pacify the Maya region. The last Maya city to fall was Nojpeten and it did not fall until 1697 (Jones 1998).\n\n&gt; to reach the paradise of Tamoanchan (`place of the misty sky’) where beautiful flowers bloomed.\n\nTomoanchan is Aztec and Postclassic, not Maya and Classic. You are blurring the lines between peoples and time periods. They are not one in the same, but distinct from one another.\n\n&gt; The great religious book of the Quiche Maya, the Popol-Vuh\n\nThat was written in 1701. You have to recognize that it is not a Classic period document, though it may have earlier roots. There are elements of the Popol Vuh that can be traced back further into Classic and even Preclassic artwork. But we cannot verify that the story stayed the same (unless someone finds a long Preclassic/Classic inscription or a book), we can only identify shared iconography.\n\n&gt; It has long been believed that the losing team (or the captain of the losing team) would be killed at the end of the match but recent advances in deciphering the Mayan glyphs, together with archaeological evidence, suggests it may have been the winning team or the winning captain who was given the honor of a quick death and instant passage to paradise.\n\nThere's no evidence for either outcome. Either way, you should provide specific sources on this statement\n\n&gt; This is not quite correct, however, as glyphs at many ball courts, Chichen Itza to name only one, ***could be interpreted***\n\nCould be interpreted to be sensational and drive up clicks. Come on, mate. You just said researchers say there is no evidence for this.\n\n&gt; Only three books of the Maya escaped the conflagration at Mani: The Madrid Codex, The Dresden Codex, and The Paris Codex\n\nAnd the Grolier Codex\n\n&gt; The Haab and the Tzolkin work together, like gears interlocking in a machine\n\nThat's just how Westerners visualize this. The Maya did not depict their calendars like that at all\n\n&gt; As the long count calendar begins 11 August 3114 BCE, it goes into its next cycle (known as a Baktun) on 21 December 2012 CE.\n\nDecember 21, 2012 marked the beginning of the 13th b'ak'tun. That means the Long Count had undergone 12 previous cycles. December wasn't the first nor will it be the last.\n    \n&gt; The claim that the Maya somehow vanished, simply because their cities were found abandoned, is not only inaccurate but insulting to the over six million Maya who carry on the traditions of their ancestors.\n\nBut that is exactly what you did when you glossed over the Postclassic and colonial periods.\n\n---\n\n***tl;dr*** - second time this week I've raged over some Mesoamerican bad history.

The Celts had javelins, so there is no reason why they could not have used one of those instead. DRINK!\n\n20.38: ANOTHER SHOT OF SPEARS BEING HELD IN A WAY THAT PRECLUDES ATTACKING WITH THEM! DRINK!\n\n20.51: Ardeshir says the Persian spearhead is very broad. He needs to check his privilege.\n\n20.57: Ardeshir states that the Persian spear would have had a ball at the end to strike opponents with. Herodotus states the spears of the Persian central regiments has gold and silver ornaments at the end, making them unsuitable for use in battle. DRINK!\n\n21.11: \"It's one thing to have a man on two feet thrusting into a body, but now you've got two horses  its obviously going to give you a lot more mass and a lot more velocity with the moving horses\". Hehehehehehehehehehehehe.\n\n21.29: Immortals were infantry guardsmen, they would not have ridden chariots, and chariots would not have been used by the time of Cyrus the Great as cavalry had overtaken them in effectiveness. DRINK! DRINK!\n\n23.42: So a warrior who keeps his spear has an advantage over one who pointlessly throws his away? Go figure.\n\n23.43: HOLLYWOOD DUAL-WIELD! DRINK!\n\n23.44: \"But the Celts still think they have enough muscle to beat back any Persian assault\". Hehehehehehehehehehehehe.\n\n24.16: Francis is speaking English here but I still think we need a translator.\n\n24.38: HOLLYWOOD DUAL-WIELD! DRINK!\n\n21.41: And now we have the burda, a weapon I am sure is pure fantasy. DRINK!\n\n21.41: Just looked in an Irish Gaelic dictionary. Bata is the Gaelic word for stick. So it seems they just took a generic Gaelic word for stick and used it describe a specific weapon. Jesus Christ.\n\n26.59: When someone comes at me with a club I always make sure to have some horses hooked up to my scythed chariot thwart them.\n\n30.47: \"The arrowheads were specially designed to rain death from above\". In contrast to those designed to rain hugs from above.\n\n31.01: My question is what is the draw weight of the bow and how does it compare to those used by the Achaemenid Persians?\n\n32.50: Francis asserts a Celtc would just readily pull out the arrow that hit him. I'll take organ damage and internal bleeding for 500, Alex.\n\n31.13: After testing the bow against targets at long range, outdoors, they then test the sling against targets at short range, in doors. Well, that's certainly fair. A far better way to go about testing the sling is outdoors at those gel torsos to determine damage. DRINK!\n\n33.24: Ardeshir expresses disbelief that the Celts a bringing rocks and a \"g-string\" to battle. Did he miss that bit in the Anabasis where Rhodian slingers drove away Persian bowmen? DRINK!\n\n33.47: Yeah, the fellow with the sling is about twenty meteres away from those targets, at the most. Real accurate test there, guys. DRINK!\n\n33.03: Testing a sling against bones is nonsensical. Flesh and muscle can reduce the impact of the strike, for instance. DRINK!\n\n34.27: I thought depressed skull fractures did not have the motivation to be lethal.\n\n38.12: Time for the final, historically accurate battle!\n\n38:12: They are both charging each other in chariots after a stare down. 2Fast@furious4me.\n\n38.49: And the Celt is de-charioted.\n\n38.55: The Celt, who I now call Derporix, grabbed his spear but left the shield behind.\n\n39.08: Derporix throws his spear at the riders instead of the horses.\n\n39.11: Derporix leaps over the scythe and does a combat roll instead of just side-stepping.\n\n39.32: UNNECESSARY NINJA JUMP!\n\n39.43: Persian Immortal gels nailed in the upper leg by a massive spear blade and laughs it off.\n\n39.45: He then puts all his weight on the injured leg and kicks Derporix.\n\n39.49: Limping?

Pleb stuff, really.  \n\nInstead I'm going to ravage your eyes with BadHistory I encounter in the wild.  BadHistory that I paid money to receive.  BadHistory that was forced upon me much the way the Swedes forced themselves upon Bavaria in the 30 Years War.  The same way that Napoleon forced himself upon the democratic institution known as the Holy Roman Empire.  The same way the US forced itself upon poor defenseless Munich at the end of WW2 because what did Munich and Germany ever do wrong?\n\nNow, I'm older than most of you, with more disposable income, a spouse who's interests don't lie as much in the historical, and a kid who's old enough to be interested in the historical.  This means I occasionally do silly shit like spend money on tour guides.  I'll stress the \"silly shit\" because I've yet to have a tour guide that doesn't suck.  Partially because I resent spending money on what I consider \"silly shit\" and look for budget priced ones, partially because it's often spur of the moment caving to some random person hawking tours.\n\nThis time?  Oh yes, this time I did everything properly.  Researched the tour company, read all the good reviews, chose the time, booked ahead, everything.  BECAUSE FUCK ME I'M AWESOME AND I'LL EVENTUALLY DO SOMETHING RIGHT!!!\n\nYeah well.  FML.  I got a shitshow.\n\nThe tour started off okay.  The guide was pleasant and presented herself as an art historian who does this on the weekend for cash.  Knowing art historians, this is all plausible.  No complaints.  NO BADHISTORY HERE GUISE!!!!\n\nBut wait!  Not 5 minutes in, there's BadHistory!\n\n* \"The column in Marienplatz was raised to give thanks to Mary for the Bavarian Army's success in the 30 Years War.\"\n\nWell.  ACKT-SHULLAY.  Wait maybe she was talking about the Magdeburg Massacre.  Rousing success, that one, and pretty much the last success the catholic League (and Bavaria) had prior to the Swedes stomping their way through Bavaria and occupying Munich.  The column was raised after the Swedes left as thanks for them leaving.\n\nNext stop: St. Peter's Church\n\nNothing particularly bad here except through omission, just a lot of emphasis on Americans bombing stuff.  Emphasis that continued for quite a while, with only a single mention of Hitler using Munich to come to power.  Not even a mention at the Hofbrauhaus of the beer hall culture being used to propel him into power.  Well, there was a slight mention at the end of it, but there was more time spent talking about the process locals use to get a beer stein locker at the Hofbrauhaus than Hitler.  I'm surprised and more than a little disappointed we didn't get any, \"Mein Oppa!\" stories.\n\nSo, onto the final bit of BadHistory I'll mention here:  \"Napoleon destroyed the German democratic institution known as the Holy Roman Empire.\"\n\nVoltaire really said it best in 1756: \"This agglomeration which was called and which still calls itself the Holy Roman Empire was in no way holy, nor Roman, nor an empire.\"\n\nI've never even heard anyone call the HRE democratic before so I ran off to Google it, giving me this fine bit of writing:\n\nhttps://www.thetrumpet.com/article/6831.24.121.0/europe/european-union/the-holy-roman-empire-is-back\n\nSo why did she say the HRE was democratic?  Because the electors elected the Emperor and there was the Imperial Diet.  Which . . . to be honest I don't really know what the Imperial Diet did other than try and figure out who'd be Emperor or affirm the Emperor's right to something.  \n\nAccording to Wiki, \"The Imperial Diet of Constance opened on 27 April 1507;[1] it recognized the unity of the Holy Roman Empire and founded the Imperial Chamber, the empire’s supreme court.\"  Seriously I'm at a complete loss here for what anything in the HRE actually did, but whatever it is it doesn't seem that democratic.\n\nThere were 7 Electors for most of the HRE, 3 church, 4 secular.  All of which were appointed \"by God\" to be kings or dukes or bishops.  Okay still . . . still not seeing anything reflecting the will of the people.\n\nOH SHIT! I GOT IT!\n\nThe will of the people is the same as the will of God, which is reflected in the appointment of the Church and secular rulers to their positions, which then allows them to appoint the Emperor, per the will of God.  How did this not make sense before?  Oh!  Probably because I'm a secularist, much like the BIG FUCKING STATUE the guide said was, \"No-one important,\" just happening to be the main guy who pushed Bavaria to be secular.\n\nSo, the will of God = the will of the people and the will of the people = the will of God.\n\nIn conclusion, DEUS VULT!",

        "author": "chocolatepot",

        "text": "It is I, /u/chocolatepot! And I have come with more corset-related badhistory!\n\nThe offender this week is an article in the New York Times Style Magazine, [Can a Corset Be Feminist?](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/25/t-magazine/fashion/corset-history-feminism.html) And I decided to read it even though I knew it would have some big clunkers. And I will say for the writer that they clearly are attempting to engage with the topic rather than just answering their own question with a resounding \"no\". But there's still badhistory happening.\n\n&gt;Since the heyday of the hand-span waists in the mid-19th century, the corset has represented a visual shorthand for “woman.”\n\nThe first frustrating statement refers back to a mythical time when women often had waists so small that a man could literally put his hands around it, touching thumb to thumb and fingertip to fingertip. I suspect this mainly comes from the *Little House* books by Laura Ingalls Wilder and Rose Wilder - Laura's mother claims that when she was married in 1860, Pa was able to do this. But we now know that the *Little House* books were heavily fictionalized by Rose in order to reflect her own values, and this could be one episode of fictionalization (Ma being something of an antagonist, representing pre-\"modern\" repression). This is also the remembrance of one woman, filtered through a second woman's memories, and a third's strong editorial hand - hardly a primary source. The smallest extant corsets we have tend to be 18-19\", which, as they were worn with a 2-3\" gap between the laced edges, would give a 20-22\" waist - too large to span with most men's hands, unless I'm much mistaken.\n\n&gt;The first was Christian Dior’s “New Look” of 1947, an ironic moniker given that the silhouette requisitioned the corsetry that had been shrugged off by women back in the Edwardian era. Dior’s corsets were of lighter construction, but their nickname, “waspies,” underlined their goal to pinch women’s waists to wasplike insignificance.\n\nCorsetry was never abandoned in the Edwardian era. From 1905 to 1907, the waistline was occasionally raised, which resulted in haute couture [evening and reception dresses being produced in 1908 with defined high waists](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47e0-ed3e-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99), which did not emphasize the actual waist at all. This led into the [\"Titanic Era\" silhouette](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47e0-fe07-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99) with narrowed hourglass figure. This didn't get rid of corsets, but merely [changed how they looked](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3ncs8n/the_corsets_in_downton_abbey_are_very_wrong/). This style of [long-line corset](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47e0-fcf9-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99) was worn throughout the 1910s, developing into [a smooth body-shaper in the 1920s](https://witness2fashion.wordpress.com/tag/1920s-corset/), usually made with elastic, rubber, and spiral steels. These materials continued to be used in the 1930s and 1940s for both all-body torsolettes/corselets/etc. and bra-and-girdle combinations. The New Look didn't represent a sudden jump back to corsets, but a change in construction techniques and intended shape.\n\nThis also seems to take a humorous/nostalgic reference to the idea of a \"wasp-waist\" too seriously.\n\n&gt;What Dior built was a resolute conservative view of femininity, and although fashion history has it that women fell into Dior’s silhouettes with gay abandon, the reality was more torn. In America, a group of women formed the Little Below the Knee Club to protest Dior’s cumbersome skirts (some included 130 feet of fabric). \n\nEasiest point to refute: 130 feet of fabric would not be possible to squeeze into a skirt made for a human. I honestly cannot imagine where that number came from. That's about 43 yards. Bear in mind that even with the narrowest available fabric at the time, you'd be hard pressed to go above 9 or 10 yards to make an entire dress, including wastage.\n\nThe Little Below the Knee Club is also difficult to use as a barometer of opinion because it's so unstudied. (Even [otherwise scholarly works](https://books.google.com/books?id=qoVwCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=little+below+the+knee+club&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjG7Z2I7M7QAhVCLyYKHZ39CAwQ6AEIPzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=little%20below%20the%20knee%20club&amp;f=false) state that there were 300,000 members without citing the source.) It seems to have been beloved by Time and Life for making creative protests that photographed well, but apart from that, it's hard to gauge how popular its viewpoint was - whether enough women were on board for the reception of the New Look to be considered mixed.\n\n&gt;In postwar Europe, the impracticality of the twin restrictions of corseted waist and full skirt indicated wealth and idleness. A woman wearing the New Look didn’t need to work, and in fact could not in the clothes. \n\nNope. Women had been able to move and work in the 19th century while wearing corsets and petticoats, and they continued to be able to do so in girdles and full skirts. Why would a teacher, saleswoman, or secretary not be able to function in them? The look trickled down the scale fairly quickly, with affordable versions coming out in lower-end stores using less material (and less-expensive material). You can see in [this 1948 Sears Roebuck catalogue](http://what-i-found.blogspot.com/2010/07/sears-roebuck-and-co-catalog-from-1948.html) that the average woman's version of the New Look had been modified from the couture [Bar suit](http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/81460).\n\n&gt;The silhouette enforced traditional views of a woman not as a worker, but as a mother — a notion at odds with the large number of women who contributed to the war effort by working in factories, or driving ambulances and buses. \n\nThis isn't so much objectively wrong as it is an exaggeration. The WACS and WAVES uniforms, for instance, were tailored jackets with skirts, and not really [so](http://www.nationalww2museum.org/see-hear/collections/artifacts/women-in-wwii.html) [obviously](http://www.ww2online.org/image/wacs-employed-training-unit-fort-benning-georgia-8-july-1944) [at odds](http://libcdm1.uncg.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/WVHP/id/7671/rec/1) with the popular post-war silhouette as in the catalogue above, which is still part of the New Look. \n\n&gt;The garment has, in hindsight, generally been assumed to be a symbol of a patriarchal society — exacerbated, perhaps, by the fact that in 1675, Louis XIV incorporated a guild of female dressmakers to make all clothes for women, except for riding habits and corsets, which were to be made only by men. While the former was an almost-unique symbol of female freedom of pursuit ... the latter came to epitomize the male hold on women, figuratively as well as literally. The corset, forged by men, “formed” a woman’s silhouette.\n\nThere is a *lot* to say about this situation - see *Fabricating Women: The Seamstresses of Old Regime France, 1675-1791*, by Clare Haru Crowston. Stays (and the similar bodices of court dress, which were also reserved for tailors) and riding habits were considered the most difficult aspects of women's clothing to make, and therefore the most prestigious. When Parisian seamstresses were petitioning to be allowed to work for themselves, the tailors were obviously concerned about their own status and business; the crown struck a compromise by allowing seamstresses to incorporate and make most clothing for women due to their arguments about the making of women's clothing being inherently feminine, and allowing tailors to retain the garments that took the most knowledge, skill, and strength and earned the most money. (Although the development and popularization of the unstructured manteau/mantua around this time meant that the seamstresses soon bounded forward.) And stays really did take quite a lot of hand strength, from cutting out the whalebone to stitching through several layers of canvas at the seams. This is again not strictly *wrong*, but the writer is ignoring the actual context in order to make a metaphorical point that doesn't have a factual basis. The corset wasn't given to tailors in order to keep men in charge of women's figures.\n\n&gt;Back in the 19th century, satire had it that husbands were frequently called upon to lace their wives into their corsets: on the one hand because the strength required exceeded that of a ladies’ maid, but also so that men could see if the laces had been untied and refastened incorrectly by a lover. It was fashion as female subservience.\n\nEasy bit first, again: it was not in any way beyond the strength of a woman to lace another woman into a corset. Some women were helped to dress by their husbands, some by maids, some by sisters or daughters. There's no evidence that men treated corsets like the [mythical medieval chastity belts](http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/everything-youve-heard-about-chastity-belts-is-a-lie), deliberately reading the knots.\n\nThis is a rather backwards reading of these satires (which, for the record, only exist in a couple of iterations - they were way more concerned with satirizing tightlacing and the idea that a corseted, padded, etc. woman was deceiving men into thinking they're more beautiful than they are). Valerie Steele shows one of them in *Corset: A Cultural History*, which is probably where the writer got the idea: [\"How odd! This morning I tied this lace in a knot and this evening there's a bow!\"](https://art.famsf.org/paul-guillaume-sulpice-gavarni/paria-le-soir-ah-par-exemple-voil%C3%A0-qui-est-bizarrece-matin-j%E2%80%99ai-fauit) It's just as likely, if not more so, given the general tone of satires about affairs, to be laughing at the husband for not realizing that he's been cuckolded as it is to be showing the moment before the man lashes out as his wife for having a lover.",

        "text": "[Link.](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3lrbzj/when_and_how_did_islam_make_its_way_to_southeast/cv8yo95) The main issue I have is with point 4, which grossly understates the influence of 'orthodox' Islam in Southeast Asia. \n\nFirst, the sources provided by OP.\n\n&gt; * Raden Abdulkadir Widjojoatmodjo, *Islam in the Netherlands East Indies*, The Far Eastern Quarterly, Vol. 2, No. 1 (Nov., 1942), pp. 48-57.\n\n&gt; * Vincent J. H. Houben, *Southeast Asia and Islam*, Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, Vol. 588, Islam: Enduring Myths and Changing Realities (Jul., 2003), pp. 149-170.\n\n I would personally have preferred to see OP cite M. C. Ricklefs, *the* most esteemed English-language historian of Java. Nevertheless, Houben is a good (and recent) source. \n\nBut to be honest, I'm a little doubtful about any source from 1942. 1942 predates most of the autonomous movement in Southeast Asian historiography, which emphasizes looking at history from an indigenous perspective rather than the external point of view of the European imperialists. It also long predates the \"Age of Commerce\" paradigm, which puts economics into play as a background for early modern Southeast Asian history. In other words, like any other work of science from 74 years ago, this work is almost certainly significantly outdated. (I mean, the title does say \"Netherlands East Indies\"...)^0\n\nNow to the post itself.\n\n&gt; 1) The Hindu caste system was not practiced in Indonesia, rather an occupation-based system was used. This was due to SE Asia archipelago's tendency to pick and choose external cultural influence in ways that fit their model and preference.\n\n'Caste' is indeed a misnomer in Southeast Asia, but AFAIK no widely accepted alternative term has ever come up. Anyways it is also worth noting that notions of 'caste' were extremely diverse in the subcontinent too.\n\nI'm not entirely sure what OP means by \"an occupation-based system.\" In the case of Bali (and to oversimplify), virtually the only remaining Hindu region in Indonesia, 'caste' is an unchangeable rank that reflects the family's relationship to its divine ancestral origin. All humans are descended from divine ancestors, but the more the family has 'declined' from these ancestors, the lower the 'caste.' So while it's very different from Indian caste, it's not occupation-based. For example, we know that in the 19th century the majority of Balinese *brahmana* (the priest 'caste') were not actually priests.^1\n\n&gt; 4) The Islam that spread to Indonesia in the 13th-18th centuries was heavily influenced by South Asian culture. It was not until the 19th century that Indonesian muslims started to take pilgrimage to Mecca and Medinah, where they learned a more Arabic (\"pure\") form of Islam and brought it back to Indonesia. Even then, the influence of adat, or local customs as they are called in Java, was and is still very strong.\n\nThis is what I have gripes with. \n\n&gt; The Islam that spread to Indonesia in the 13th-18th centuries was heavily influenced by South Asian [i.e. Indian] culture.\n\nIt is undeniable that Islam in Indonesia was heavily influenced by non-Islamic culture. But even in Java popular Austronesian beliefs were just as important  as South Asian culture, if not more. In the eastern Indonesia there were virtually no South Asian influences. For a short breakdown:\n\n* The Malay world - the Malay Peninsula, most of Sumatra, and north and western Borneo - was the most Islamized area of Southeast Asia, especially at a court level. And while Sanskrit and India's high culture left an enduring mark, Abdul Samad al-Palimbani, a Muslim theologian from the Malay sultanate of Palembang, doesn't take the time to complain about Hinduism or Buddhism. He complains about good Muslims wasting money on rituals to the ancestors, even though there is no evidence that the dead can intercede in the present. He complains about shamans and their followers, saying they're just possessed by demons. Palimbani really, really *hates* \"men who wear women's clothes,\" or transvestite animist priests. In other words, the greatest influence on the religion of common Malays were animism, not Hinduism.^2 \n\n* Java: The Javanese, even after Islamization, still recalled and arguably even honored many of the old Hindu gods. For instance, Sultan Mangkubumi, one of the greatest Javanese sultans, is positively identified with Vishnu and his Eighth Avatar, Krishna. But the Indian gods were not the non-Islamic deities most dear to the Muslim Javanese. The 'Goddess of the Southern Ocean' - a non-Indian, indigenous sea deity - was by far the most venerated of the spirits of Java, with Javanese rulers acquiring the support of the spirit world by ritually marrying her. And when a Javanese king was driven from his capital in 1742, he appealed to an indigenous mountain god, Sunan Lawu. Javanese Islam was extremely syncrestist, but it was influenced by indigenous religion just as much as, if not more than, India. ^3\n\n* In Eastern Indonesia (Sulawesi and further east) Hinduism and Buddhism never had much of an impact.^4 So of course South Asian influences on Islam were negligible, and almost entirely the result of second-hand contact from Malay or Javanese. This isn't to say that syncretism didn't exist here. Hell, Bugis Muslims of South Sulawesi generally accepted that an entire epic full of a pantheon of non-Islamic gods ([*La Galigo*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sureq_Galigo), one of the masterpieces of world literature) was real. But it wasn't South Asian.\n\n&gt; It was not until the 19th century that Indonesian muslims started to take pilgrimage to Mecca and Medinah, where they learned a more Arabic (\"pure\") form of Islam and brought it back to Indonesia. \n\nThis is what gets on my nerves the most, since it's wrong on two levels. First, there was an entire community of reformist Southeast Asian scholars who had studied in Mecca and Medina throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. A brief introduction to a few of the major thinkers, and how they affected their homeland:^5\n\n* Nur al-Din al-Raniri (d. 1658): Arguably not Southeast Asian; he was born in Gujarat, India, to an Arab father and a Malay mother. After studying in Gujarat and the Islamic Holy Lands, Raniri served the Queen of Aceh, a major sultanate in what is now the western end of Indonesia. A mystic, polemicist, and legal expert who had mastered five languages, he strove to weaken the influence of mysticism and heterodoxy in Malay *sufi* orders. He was the first Muslim cleric in Southeast Asia to write a standard manual for religious duties, still in use in the Malay Peninsula. He was responsible for the abolition of inhumane (and thus un-Islamic) torture methods in Aceh, such as \"licking the burning steel.\" In the neighboring sultanate of Kedah Raniri is credited with completing and deepening the Islamization process. He also translated a number of *hadiths* to Malay.\n\n* 'Abd al-Ra'uf al-Sinkili (1615-1693): Born in Aceh, Sinkili studied extensively in Arabia from 1642 to 1661. Upon his return, he was the first Southeast Asian to write a commentary (in Malay!) on the entire Qur'an. Considered \"a landmark in the history of Islamic learning in Malay,\" Sinkili's commentaries were read from South Africa to Maluku, and were even published in the Ottoman empire, Cairo, Mecca itself, and in Jakarta as recently as the 1980s. He wrote more than 20 works, in both Arabic and Malay, on other topics such as the application of *shariah* in daily life. Many of his works were circulated as far afield as the Philippines.\n\n* Muhammad Yusuf al-Maqassari (1627-1699): Although born in South Sulawesi, Maqassari left in 1644 and lived most of his adult life in the Middle East and Java. Maqassari is best remembered for his guerrilla fighting during a war between the Dutch and the West Java sultanate of Banten from 1680 to 1683, when Maqassari was the last major Bantenese leader to capitulate. He apparently did not write very much, unlike his two Acehnese contemporaries. He has a beautiful grave in South Africa (of all places), though.\n\n* 'Abd al-Samad al-Palimbani (1704-1789), a half-Arab who was born in the Malay port of Palembang, left for Arabia, and never returned. But from Arabia Palimbani was a major influence on Southeast Asian Islam. Palimbani encouraged religious wars in Java against the Dutch, criticized syncretism (as seen above), and lead to the further development of a more orthodox Sufism in Indonesia, including the introduction of novel Sufi orders. \n\n* Muhammad Arshad al-Banjari (1710-1812), from Banjarmasin in South Borneo, who studied for 30 years in Mecca and 5 years in Medina (with side visits elsewhere in the Middle East) before returning to Indonesia. After returning Banjari built the first educational institution in Banjar, consisting \"of lecture halls, students’ hostels, teachers’ houses and libraries. This centre was economically self-sufficient, as Mu\u0019ammad Arshad together with other teachers and students transformed nearby lands into productive rice fields and vegetable gardens.\" He also established the *shari'ah* as the basic legal system of Banjar, making Islamic courts and establishing the position of *Mufti*. \n\nAnd even before Raniri or Sinkili, surviving 16th-century Islamic texts from the northern coast of Java appear to represent conventional Sufism. It strongly criticizes heresies, including conflating God with humans (which would be expected from Javanese acquainted with Hinduism), so it does indirectly provide evidence that heterodox Islam was rife in Java at the time. But it still shows that 'orthodox' Islam has been in Indonesia for at least four centuries before the 19th century.^6\n\nSecond, OP seems to suggest that any *hajji* (anyone who has gone on pilgrimage to Mecca) would bring orthodox Islam back to Indonesia. This is not the case. *Hajji*s were considered to be imbued with supernatural power once they returned, and most apparently accepted this role - even though it flies in the face of orthodox Islam. \n\n^0 For discussion on Southeast Asian historiography, Lieberman's *Strange Parallels: Southeast Asia in Global Context*, Volume I, has a good synopsis at the beginning.\n\n^1 This paragraph is based on Geertz's *Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali*, a very important work of archaeology. \n\n^2 See \"Palembang in the Late 18th and Early 19th Centuries\" by Barbara Andaya. \n\n^3 See M. C. Ricklef's *Mystic Synthesis in Java.*\n\n^4 See, especially, Ian Caldwell's \"Power, State and Society Among the Pre-Islamic Bugis\" for South Sulawesi not being Indicized. \n\n^5 See Azyumardi Azra's *The Origins of Islamic Reformism in Southeast Asia*\n\n^6 See discussion in M. C. Ricklef's *History of Modern Indonesia from c. 1200*\n\nSources: For Islam in Indonesia pre-1800 these two books are pretty good.\n\n* M. C.

        "text": "Greetings Badhistoriers. The job market back in my home city is just as fertile as I remember it. So, besides keeping the house in order, I have had lots of free-time. This means it is an ideal occasion for another documentary review. This time I have selected Deadliest Warrior, Season 2 - Episode 8: Persian Immortal Versus Celtic Warrior. I have abandoned my practice of selecting an alcoholic drink to match the civilization depicted as enduring Deadliest Warrior requires whiskey, served neat. My imaginary bottle of Canadian Club is thus handy and I am ready to start. \n\nEdit: Got bored, watched some more, added new material.\n\n0.05: Badhistory 5 seconds in! The narrator calls the Celt a savage barbarian. First, that applies only to those from Scotland. Second, the Celts had complex social and religious structures such as ruling councils and assemblies where free citizens could take part in government, as well as refined artistic traditions and a strong sense of loyalty to their aristocratic patrons or officials. There was nothing barbaric or savage about them. DRINK!\n\n0.10: That maille looks way to anachronistic. The maille used in the time period would have looked like this: \n\nhttps://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/ae/9e/b7/ae9eb779a29b8d595fdec6c85de740ea.jpg\n\nThe maille displayed looks more medieval:\n\nhttp://www.heavenlyswords.com/images/T/Large_Medieval_Crusader_Knight_Haubergeon_01.jpg\n\nDRINK!\n\n1.21: The narrator states the Celts were the ancestors of the Scottish and Irish clans. He also leaves out they were the ancestors of the French, English, Bretons and Welsh, as well as a large proportion of the Spanish and North Italian population. One drink for the overly narrow statement. DRINK!\n\n1.22: The \"stats\" of the Celtic warrior don't mention they would wear maille. DRINK!\n\n1.23: HOLLYWOOD DUAL WIELD! DRINK!\n\n1.27: Metal helmet with nose-guard many centuries before they became common. DRINK!\n\n1.33: Two errors here. First, the narrator calls the Persian Immortal a special-ops killer. Disregarding the fact that the Immortals were most likely called Companions (Anûšiya as opposed to Anauša), the Immortals were a regiment of full-time troops intended to fight in open battle, not a small group of men who would operate behind enemy lines. Next, the \"stats\" list them as having a wicker shield, as opposed to a wooden shield that a Persian professional unit would usually possess. Wicker shields were employed to form a shield wall, and not for guard duty. DRINK! DRINK!\n\n2.40: HOLLYWOOD DUAL WIELD! DRINK!\n\n2.47: MORE HOLLYWOOD DUAL WIELDING! DRINK!\n\n2.52: Time to roll out the \"experts\". The first is Francis Brebner. Extraordinarily fit looking guy and a participant in Highland games, he may have the athletic ability but has no background in martial-arts or experimental archaeology. DRINK!\n\n3.17: The next person is Spencer Dinnean, whom I could find absolutely no information about. DRINK!\n\n3.42: The narrator says the Celts were the first iron-workers in Europe and helped usher in the Iron Age. Uh, no. That would be the Greeks, and the Iron-Age was transmitted from the Middle-East, not heralded by the Celts. DRINK!\n\n3.46: The narrator says that iron helped the Celts conquer much of Europe. Again, no. Celtic culture was spread through a variety of methods. Migration seems to be the most attested to within written sources, but trade and acculturation to a new elite may have also been methods. DRINK!\n\n3.59: The Celtic noble is not wearing maille. DRINK!\n\n4.14: HOLLYWOOD DUAL WIELD! DRINK!\n\n4.51: The first Iranian expert is Ardeshir \"Bitches be nothing next to sharp akinakes\" Radpour. Now we are getting somewhere! Mr Radpor is a trained rider, martial-artist and experimental archaeologist. He is also a metal smith and has crafted numerous weapons and armour. His website can be found here:\n\nhttp://www.radpour.com/\n\nThis has earned The ByzantineBasileus Seal of Approval (tm).\n\n5.02: Mr Radpour called the Immortals special-forces. The ByzantineBasileus Seal of Approval (tm) withdrawn. Also, DRINK!\n\n5.17: The next individual is Cyrus Zahiri, also known as Cyrus James, who appears to be only an actor and occasional film crewmen. DRINK!\n\n5.28: The shape of the shields here is correct, but they are held in the wrong manner. They are held horizontally rather than vertically, meaning the warriors lose the protection offered to their lower and uper bodies. DRINK!\n\n5.59: The Immortals were infantry, and did not use chariots. DRINK!\n\n5.52: The narrator says the Persian scythed chariot would destroy any resistance. Most of the accounts of scythed chariots describe them as total failures when facing troops who were prepared for them. DRINK!\n\n6.09: The narrator states that the Immortals numbered ten thousand. This figure comes from Herodotus, but I personally doubt his description is accurate. I would propose that the \"Immortals\" where a guard unit of 1000 men with golden apples on their spears. The amount of 10,000 should perhaps refer to the standing palace regiments as a whole, who were called the Companions.\n\n6.31: HOLLYWOOD DUAL WIELD! DRINK!\n\n6.46: STILL MORE HOLLYWOOD DUAL WIELDING! DRINK!\n\n7.03: The narrator calls the Celtic sword a long-sword, which was a specific weapon from the medieval period. DRINK!\n\n7.10: Francis Brebner states the Celtic sword had a rounded point whilst holding a version of the weapon with a relatively narrow point. DRINK! \n\n9.05: Francis swings at the armour instead of thrusting under the scales. DRINK!\n\n10.17: Test is done against a bare head, whilst an Immortal would have been most likely been wearing a helmet. DRINK!\n\n11.19: Narrator calls the Immortal a commando. DRINK!\n\n12.15: The narrator says an ancient Celtic warrior would have had a burda, which was a club. I have never read about the burda being used by the ancient Celts, so I will count this as an error. DRINK!\n\n13.19: This test proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that a sharp iron point can penetrate flesh.\n\n14.03: Francis suggest a leather belt as protection for a Celtic warrior rather than, you know, MAILLE! DRINK!\n\n14.28: That belt looks less like a belt and more like a girdle. For when your warrior wants to look svelte on the battlefield!\n\n14.59: I am sure a Celtic warrior would not just let you pull down his shield like that, especially with him holding it and trying to cut you in the spleen. DRINK!\n\n16.48: ANOTHER HOLLYWOOD DUAL-WIELD!\n\n17.17: MORE SHIELDS HELD INCORRECTLY IN A BATTELINE! DRINK!\n\n17.33: Not only are their shields held inproperly, they wield their spears in a manner that actually prevents them attacking with it! Double drink. DRINK! DRINK!\n\n17.39: Sigh. More Hollywood Dual-Wielding. DRINK!\n\n17.45: \"Coming up! Both sides thrust their most piercing weapons!\". Hehehehehehehehehehehehehehehe.\n\n18.44: Francis states that Celtic spear-heads were wavy in shape. In reality they were leaf-shaped: \n\nhttps://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/69/e3/33/69e333085eb3cc9de09c629d1d449339.jpg\n\nDRINK!\n\n19.27: They are testing a Celtic spear by throwing it, rather than using it hand-to-hand.

        "text": "Our bad history in question,\n\nhttp://www.ancient-origins.net/history/pre-columbian-murals-and-norse-sagas-suggest-vikings-met-aztecs-and-outcome-was-not-pretty-021084?nopaging=1\n\nIt starts off in the deep end and just wades around the bullshit. There's no testing the waters with a toe dip here before going head first in.\n\n&gt; Did the Vikings visit Pre-Columbian Mexico?\n\nIn short, no. But I have a feeling you are going to concoct a fantastical tale to explain to me why they did.\n\n&gt; The depiction of white people on Chichen Itza murals in the Temple of the Warriors probably represent Vikings\n\nOr, and I’m throwing this out there, you don’t understand the conventions of Maya art and you are going to completely misinterpret things.\n\n&gt; There are also three traditions of the Norse Sagas that mention that in 965 or 986 Ari Marson set sail from Ireland in an attempt to reach Greenland. The story has it that Marson’s ship ran into rough seas and a storm threw him off course. Within six days he had reached Mexico instead. The Eyrbggia saga and the voyage of Ari Marson may explain how the first white people got to the Yucatan.\n\nWhere’s the evidence Winters? While stories are great there needs to be some hard proof that the story is speaking the truth. And the story doesn’t even describe Yucatan, the Maya, or anywhere else in Mesoamerica. HOW DO YOU KNOW THEY WENT TO YUCATAN?! There's a lot of doubt (nothing solidly Viking has been found) on the settlement at Point Rosee and that is in Newfoundland where L'Anse aux Meadows is. And you're trying to tell me these Vikings just completely missed the US Eastern seaboard, missed the Caribbean, and arrived in Yucatan in six days?\n\n&gt; Some researchers claim that the tribes joined the conquistadors’ in defeating the Aztecs because they represented a return of the “white lords”. However, most researchers say that this story about “white lords” was a myth created during the Spanish conquest. Restall wrote that: “The legend of the returning lords, originated during the Spanish-Mexica war in Cortés' reworking of Moctezuma's welcome speech, had by the 1550's merged with the Cortés-as-Quetzalcoatl legend that the Franciscans had started spreading in the 1530s.”\n\nAnd yet you are going to ignore that? Really?\n\n&gt; Murals in the temple depict black, white, and brown people. In some of these murals one can see whites fighting and in bondage to blacks.\n\nNo, what you are seeing are people in body paint. If you took time to make note of it, you would see that the black warriors have different color faces. And that your white prisoners have many horizontal lines. Unless these black Maya were capturing mummies, one has to consider that these markings are meant to portray something other than skin color. In fact, if we look at the [mural as a whole]( http://www.celticnz.org/images/Nazca/Pre-Inca4.jpg) (sorry, can’t find a large image that isn’t [blurry]( https://classconnection.s3.amazonaws.com/202/flashcards/2906202/jpg/012f06c82308b10f4e916a97447dfd9c62b5360b44-142ED35F6BD76775F52.jpg)) instead of this one small part, we see “white” people on a building in war costumes like the “black” people.  You know why, Winters? Because the black figures were the ones doing the attacking. The white figures were the ones [defending](http://www.jstor.org/stable/275525?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents). But you wouldn't understand that if you had just looked at one part of one mural and ignored everything else.\n\n&gt; In Esotericism of the Popol Vuh by Raphael Girard, one reads about the ‘Dance of the Giants’. This Mayan dance appears to represent a Pre-Columbian conflict between white and black people in Mexico.\n\n&gt; This book is quite illuminating. In it, Girard discusses the Dance of the Black Giants. The dance of the Black Giants explains the reason why the other indigenous peoples joined the Spanish in destroying the Aztec nation. Girard's description of the Dance of the Giants is startling.\n\nIf you actually take a look at the [chapter]( http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/popolvuh/pv-16.htm) it makes no mention that these giants have white or black skin. They are merely called the White Giant and the Black Giant. If Winters was aware of anything about Mesoamerica, he may know that white and black are both [colors associated with cardinal directions]( http://www.famsi.org/research/hopkins/DirectionalPartitions.pdf).  West was black, white was north, east is red, south is yellow, and blue/green is Center.\n\n&gt; The Chichen Itza mural indicates that the indigenous peoples had sided with the blacks when the whites first attempted to invade Mexico. However, it later appears that they felt the ‘black giants’ were arrogant and boastful and they wanted to overthrow them – even though they originally had helped defeat the Vikings.\n\nOr you read a book about Maya spirituality and because it ties into the Popol Vuh, a K’iche’ document of questionable age, you think it somehow ties in with the past. While it is all well and fine to conduct ethnographic work on people to help illuminate our understanding of the past, there is no bridge between these modern K’iche’ practices and pre-Columbian Maya beliefs. There are no murals or painted scenes which show these giants battling one another. And the mural at Chichen is inadequate because it depicts multiple black and white figures who are not fighting as well as villagers. \n\n&gt; Although many of the Indigenous peoples sided with the blacks in their battle against the white invaders in Pre-Columbian times, by the time the Spanish arrived in Mexico the black rulers, namely the Aztecs, were mistreating the other groups of Indigenous peoples.\n\n&gt; The Spanish described the Aztecs as follows: “The people of this land are well made, rather tall than short. They are swarthy as leopards, of good manners and gestures, for the greater part very skillful, robust, and tireless, and at the same time the most moderate men known. They are very warlike and face death with the greatest resolution.”\n\nWhoa, what? When did you establish that blacks were rulers of Mexico? Just on the basis of some Maya murals at Chichen? Chichen is not Mexico. Two different locations in Mesoamerica with two different cultures and two different heritages. On top of that leap that could cross the Grand Canyon, you provide a description which in no way describe the Aztecs as black.\n&gt; Archaeological evidence, Mayan and Spanish descriptions, and pictorial evidence from the codices indicate the Aztecs may have been black people. This would not be surprising because the Paleo-Americans Luzia and Naia were also black.\n\nI don’t know how to deconstruct such a bold faced lie without writing a whole book about it. What I can say is that within Aztec art they made a distinction of what black people looked like. Within the Codex there is a scene in which Cortes is meeting two Tlaxcalan lords [while being accompanied by a black servant]( http://christinaproenza.org/BlackConquistadors.pdf). Even in the colonial period when this was made, Aztec artists made it a point to highlight how different this servant’s skin was from their own.\n\n&gt; In summary, it would appear that the character named Gavite in the Dance of the Giants represents the Spanish. The blacks defeated by Gavite were the Aztecs, who were identified by the Maya and Spanish as black and were represented in the codices as a horrible people who mistreated the other local tribes.\n\n&gt; The whites who landed at Chichen Itza were Vikings. The Vikings were well-known navigators that sailed to many nations in Europe, including Great Britain. They may have been sailing in the Atlantic and were mislaid by a storm until they reached Mexico.\n\nIn summary? IN SUMMARY?! You didn’t even prove that the white looking figures on the mural were Vikings. You chose an arbitrary date of the occupation of Chichen that coincided with Viking exploration of Greenland and Newfoundland and used that as your proof that somehow Vikings traveled all the way south to Yucatan. This is fucking horseshit and anyone with half a brain would recognize it as such. But I guess I should have expected this from a person who makes it their life [publish pseudo-history]( https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=clyde+winters&amp;btnG=&amp;as_sdt=1%2C23&amp;as_sdtp=). I'm kind of surprised there was zero mention from our favorite Afrocentrist Ivan Van Sertima. Didn't think of using the worn and disproven [\"Olmec were black\"](http://www.unl.edu/rhames/courses/current/vansertima.pdf) card to try and bolster up your position? What a shame, it would have just added to the ridiculousness of this article.\n",

        "text": "Jack Chick (RIP) was best known for his comics warning people that no matter how good they were in life, they would be tortured forever in hell unless they personally asked Jesus to come into their hearts. Recurring motifs of his include Catholicism being the root of all modern evil, young universe creationism, Mary Sue evangelists, and dialogue that would have been too cheesy for a Silver Age comic book.\n\nWhen it came to Israel, he often tried to play historian. I've found a few especially egregious tracts he published:\n\n* [Love the Jewish People](http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/1000/1000_01.asp), originally published as \"Support Your Local Jew.\" I'm gonna refer to it as that, because it's fucking hilarious.\n\n* [Squatters](http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/1019/1019_01.asp)\n\n* [Somebody Angry?](http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/1055/1055_01.asp)\n\n* [The Holocaust](http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0054/0054_01.asp). Not Holocaust denial, but Holocaust blame-shifting.\n\nAccording to Chick, it all started when Abraham fathered Ishmael by Hagar, his Egyptian servant, and Isaac by his wife Sarah. God decided he liked Isaac and that Ishmael could go fuck himself. Ishmael was sent into the desert where he [sired the entire Arab race](http://media.chick.com/tractimages67491/1019/1019_04.gif) (\"Squatters\"). Somehow Isaac's chosen descendants, the Jews, wound up in Ancient Egypt, Chick writes:\n\n&gt; \"The slaves Egypt used to build her empire belonged to someone else. And their rightful owner watched the Egyptians mistreat his people for 400 years. Now he was going to stop it!\" [Support Your Local Jew, panel 3](http://media.chick.com/tractimages67491/1000/1000_03.gif).\n\n(NOTE: From here on, \"Support Your Local Jew\" will be abbreviated to SYLJ).\n\n\"Someone else\" being YHWH. A century of Egyptological research has found no evidence that the Jews ever settled in significant numbers in Egypt, much less were the enslaved economic backbone Chick thinks they were. Fast forward a few thousand years and Chick claims that [\"Egypt is still Israel's enemy\"](http://media.chick.com/tractimages67491/1000/1000_05.gif), and that this is why Egypt is a developing nation. Note that this was published in 1998, 20 years after the Camp David Accords established peace and formal diplomatic relations between Israel and Egypt.\n\nBut no matter. Chick takes the Egyptian bondage, and the Exodus to the Promised Land, as historical fact. Notice that he draws the Promised Land as including not just Israel and Palestine, but most of Jordan and about half of Syria in [panel 21 of \"Somebody Angry?\"](http://media.chick.com/tractimages67491/1055/1055_12.gif). **Edit to add**: Here's \"the river of Egypt\" Chick says demarcates the southern border between Israel's Negev Desert and Egypt's Sinai Governorate. [Very river. Much wow.](http://eoimages.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/imagerecords/65000/65114/MiddleEast.A2003031.0820.250m.jpg) Perhaps he thought showing Israel's legitimate borders spanning to the Nile would be too much too soon.\n\nChick, as any fundamentalist would, blames the Jewish diaspora and centuries of European antisemitism on the Israelites' rebellion against God. That's nothing too unusual for people like him, although [this image from \"Somebody Angry?\"](http://media.chick.com/tractimages67491/1055/1055_13.gif), which shows Joseph Stalin (as a Tsarist officer) with the Russian Orthodox Patriarch expelling Jews from a Shtetl, is a little strange.\n\nNow we get to Mandatory Palestine, and the densest concentration of bad history in these tracts (SYLJ, panels 13-20). Chick says that until 1918 everything was sunny for the British Empire thanks to Queen Victoria, who he says (no source given) was God-fearing and read her Bible for guidance. Everything changed during World War 1, when he claims that biochemist and Zionist politician Chaim Weizmann developed synthetic acetone for the Royal Navy in exchange for a promise to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine. While Chick is correct about Weizmann's role in the British war effort, no acetone-for-land deal was ever made. What did happen was that Weizmann gained influence in the British government, and used this influence to lobby more forcefully for a Jewish homeland's creation, which was laid out in the Balfour Declaration of 1917.\n\nChick insinuates that the British stabbed Weizmann in the back by restricting and eventually halting Jewish immigration to the Mandate and divvying up the Holy Land in the Arabs' favor, as shown in [this panel](http://media.chick.com/tractimages67491/1000/1000_14.gif). None of this is remotely true. Weizmann and the World Zionist Congress were the ones who put forward the first formal suggestion for a Jewish-Arab partition, Weizmann agreed to the initial caps on immigration, and from 1933 to 1939 Jewish immigration to the Mandate surged with nearly 200,000 European Jews arriving in six years. Chick, however, implies that Jews only started begging to enter the Holy Land in 1938 (his arbitrarily-chosen date for the start of the Holocaust).\n\nHitler is portrayed as a conscious agent of the ~~Illuminati~~ Roman Catholic Church. Chick actually writes that \"Catholic Germany ... launched a 20th century inquisition\" in [this panel from SYLJ](http://media.chick.com/tractimages67491/1000/1000_07.gif). He ignores the fact that Protestants outnumbered Catholics in pre-war Germany 2:1, that the Nazis' strongest support was in rural Protestant areas, and that all 28 recognized Protestant groups in Germany were merged into the National Reich Church in 1936. But here's Chick's big, damning primary source proving that the Vatican orchestrated the Shoah: A [photo](http://media.chick.com/tractimages67491/0054/0054_12.gif) from the tract [Holocaust](http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0054/0054_01.asp) of Pope Pius XII meeting with Franz von Papen, \"a sinister Nazi.\" Chick doesn't mention that in 1934, Franz von Papen provoked the Night of the Long Knives by publicly denouncing Hitler in the [Marburg Speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marburg_speech), saw most of his political allies get imprisoned or killed, was excluded from the Nazi government for the entirety of World War 2, and was acquitted of all charges at Nuremberg. This photo is one of the very few primary sources Chick cites.\n\nThe best thing that can be said about Chick's history of the Holocaust is that he admits that 6 million Jews were murdered. But he assigns the blame strangely: In \"Somebody Angry?\" he [says](http://media.chick.com/tractimages67491/1055/1055_13.gif) \"the whole world hated them [Jews] -- especially the **Muslims, the Vatican, and Britain** (emphasis mine). Not the Nazis. Not the Waffen-SS. The real antisemites were the Muslims, the Vatican, and the guys who were bombing German cities.\n\nChick goes on to say that during the Arab-Israeli War of 1947-1948, British officers commanded the Transjordan Arab Legion in [SYLJ](http://media.chick.com/tractimages67491/1000/1000_15.gif). This is yet another distortion. While General John Bagot Glubb was in command of the Arab Legion, his orders were to *prevent* Arab troops from entering Jerusalem or the borders of the planned Jewish state (EDIT NOTE: As the 1948 war progressed these orders were disregarded concerning Jerusalem, but that does not change Whitehall's intentions). Of course, Chick regarded those borders (and probably the very existence of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan) as illegitimate, so that detail probably doesn't matter to him.\n\nMeanwhile, in Chick's parallel universe, the true story of the Nakba is as follows: Israeli armed forces *begged* the Palestinian Arabs to stay. However, the Palestinians were afraid of being killed by *other* Arabs, and therefore fled to those other Arab lands. [Sauce](http://media.chick.com/tractimages67491/1019/1019_16.gif).\n\nThat's all for now, but I've barely scratched the surface of the bad history in those tracts. I leave the links. You can browse them at your leisure.\n\n**Edited** to fix grammatical errors, and to put verbs in the past tense given that Chick is dead.",
