I've modded it, I've done sidequests, stories quests and searched for tons of stuff I found on the on the net about it. Searching for rare weapons and armor and quicky side quests. I didn't beat it yet, because I've just been having fun run around doing little side quest and things, I have put in 370+ hours into it, but I think I've reached my end. It's time to shelf if for a while. \n\nI always have a hard time going back to a game after being away from a long for a long time. I shelfed the Witcher 3 for a year, a whole year! I went back to it last year, after I put a couple hundred hours into MGS5, and had a new fell in love with Witcher 3 all over again. \n\nSo when do you determine that it's time to give something a rest? When you beat it, or when you just stop having fun with it? Do you just grit you teeth, grind through it,  sunset it for good or just give it a rest?",

        "text": "Something I hear a lot nowadays is how games like the Soulsborne series and Monster Hunter have a lot of *weight* to their combat, while inversely, games like Elder Scrolls, Devil May Cry, and Dynasty Warriors have no weight to their combat.\n\nQuite some time ago, I made [a thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/6s2v41/whats_the_appeal_of_heavy_committed_combat_a_la/) on this sub asking the appeal of heavy, committed combat, but looking back, I clearly misunderstood what \"weight\" meant in this sense. I thought \"weight\" meant that attacks are slow and hit hard, as if you were wielding a really heavy axe, but both Soulsborne and Monster Hunter have as much fast, weak combat options as slow, strong ones, yet are continued to be praised for their weight. I later found [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coCsLWqT3v0) regarding Punch-Out Wii's animation that praised said game for its weight, even though it has quick, snappy combat.\n\nSo I need this question answered: what makes combat have \"weight\"? Is it literally just making swords swing like giant telephone poles? Is it about how in-game animations respond to attacks? How can even fast combat have \"weight\" to it?",

        "text": "*Disclaimer: I won't be spoiling any major plot points but I will be going over the main antagonists so if you don't want to hear anything about these characters then you have been warned*\n\nI'm gonna go through the contents of each of the 5 soundtrack albums, and how they help create a wonderful and memorable experience for the player.\n\n[Far Cry 5: Original Game Soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBcTm3xeomM&amp;t=1107s&amp;ab_channel=UbisoftMusicUBILOUD) - This is the original score for the game.  Anyone who has played the game will be transported back to the main menu as soon as the first tune begins playing.  A lot of it comes from action sequences so it isn't all exactly easy listening, but it really adds to a lot of the scenes, while still using a similar set of instruments to keep you in that same country/rural vibe.  Not much of an expert on scores so I'm sure there is more to say about this one.\n\nFar Cry 5 Licensed Music Soundtrack (contents found [here](https://www.psu.com/news/far-cry-5-soundtrack-list/)) - This is pretty straight forward given the 'Rock, Flag, &amp; Eagle' theme of FC5.  Lots of great rock songs that really add to the badass mechanics of the game.  Some of them are used in set pieces (Barracuda) and makes for some of the most memorable moments in the game.  The list is great and I'm sure everyone will recognise a good few songs form it.\n\nThis is where it gets interesting.  The other 3 albums contain the same 10 songs, performed in a unique style for each album.  In the game these albums can be heard on the Project Eden's Gate radio station whenever driving vehicles or from radios in Peggy territory.  The lyrics directly relate to the antagonists and you will hear a lot of rhetoric in the songs that the various antagonists use throughout the plot.\n\n[When The World Falls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW2tLhmkOII&amp;ab_channel=UbisoftMusicUBILOUD) - This is performed by what Ubi have dubbed 'The Hope County Choir', which is a full choir accompanied by a guitar.  This album plays in John Seed's area and fits perfectly, with John being the evangelist of Eden's Gate, and other than Joseph, being the closest to a 'minister' sort of character.\n\n[Into The Flames](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_E_NB1POuA&amp;ab_channel=UbisoftMusicUBILOUD) - This album is performed by a full band, and has quite a few different singers throughout the album.  This album plays in Jacob's region, and although it doesn't really correlate to his character, it fits the setting of the game hearing a full country band playing songs that relate to the characters and themes within the game.\n\n[We Will Rise Again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLivJdCDvxo&amp;ab_channel=UbisoftMusicUBILOUD) - This album contains 'reinterpretations' of the 10 songs, which make use of soundscapes and ambient music to perfectly capture the essence of Faith's region.  Aside from them fitting the trippy and drug fuelled vibe region perfectly, they are actually very well put together and extremely good listening.\n\nI think that this approach is genius, and really drills the themes into the players head as they hear these songs in different style throughout the game.  If you want an example of how the different styles create different moods, pick a song, and listen to how it is performed on each album.  I have actually listened to these albums quite a bit, and it feels really rewarding to hear references to events and themes from the game in the lyrics of the songs.\n\nSorry if this is a bit verbose, but I needed to get off my chest how clever I think this approach is, and I think Dan Romer did something really special with these 5 albums.",

        "text": "When Bioshock Infinite came out it was THE game for me. I loved everything about it.\n\nI adored Elizabeth, and still think she's the best and most helpful co\\-op npc in gaming ever.\n\nThe whole premise and setting were amazingly crafted, both lore and design of levels, that were often one and the same in the various \"museum\" types of levels.\n\nThe combat was fun, always encouraging to move around and use different weapons and powers, as ammo and mana were not that abundant. The levels were often large open spaces and had alternative routes, so I needed to do some backtracking and explore around to find hidden supplies and voice recordings.\n\nThe music... those alternative time\\-appropriated song covers were done perfectly.\n\nThe story was exciting and captivating from the very start to the very end. Every twist threw something interesting in my face, just to turn it up to eleven with that ending. After finishing the game, I was thinking about it for the next two weeks, turning it over and over in my brain. Listened to the soundtrack and re\\-played parts of the game. And came to appreciate even more how masterfully the whole thing was put together.\n\nThe opinions about Bioshock Infinite were, at the time of release, kind of the same as mine. Universal appraise from reviewers, love from players, tons of fan content and cosplay, hundreds of theory and explanation videos and it got all the end\\-year awards it could possibly get.\n\n**\\~** \\`**fast\\-forward to today \\~**\n\nWhen I'm online, I always peruse the gaming side of the internet, and more and more, I notice that everybody... kind of dislikes Bioshock Infinite? Every time it comes up, it's used as a well known example of a disappointing and bad game. Like, someone would say: \"It's not like this is Bioshock Infinite or anything. Remember that? Yeesh... \" and everyone nods along.\n\nCombat is considered stale, the story \\- mediocre, the ending \\- shit.\n\n**why?**\n\n**Why?**\n\n**W H Y ?**\n\n*Also, maybe it \"explains everything\", but I tried and couldn't enjoy the first two Bioshock games. The repetitive hand animation, the clunky weapons swap, and plus the story got spoiled for me. Not bad games, just not for me.*",

        "text": "Does anyone else have a profound problem with the way so many game publishers and developers openly bash the old games in franchises in order to sell new ones? They approach games as just products being iterated upon, instead of creative works that have artistic value. The worst thing about it is how many people buy into this and then start bashing the old games as well. I can't even name how many people I have seen on various forums bashing the old God of War games after taking a cue from Cory Balrog. \n\n&gt; God of War's Kratos was an angry lump of muscle. I made him a struggling father.\n\nI mean I understand saying something like, \"we wanted to take a more narrative based approach to the new games compared to the older ones.\" This would be fine and get the point across, but in several of his interviews he highlights how bad Kratos is as a character, as a way to promote the new game.  It comes across as, \"Hey, our old games are shit, but the new one fixes them and is so much better!\"\n\nThis seems to be a constant approach to sell new software in the game industry. Molyneux was famous for it with the Fable games and Bungie did it with Halo 2. The belittling of older titles to sell new ones diminishes the industry. I hate it. Anyone else?",

        "author": "EternalDahaka",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/8f7oyr/the_core_reasons_thumbsticks_are_inaccurate/",
        "text": "Hello everyone.  This is something I've talked about for years but isn't something that's touched on in the gaming community almost ever..  This is also very important to me because I tend to play exclusively with controllers, even when on PC.\n\nI've read posts, articles, comments, and even academic studies on how controllers are inaccurate, yet what all seem to miss is just *how* the controls are set up for the sticks.  Despite popular belief, most of the inaccuracy tied to controllers is not inherent to the stick, or failings of a velocity system.  Most of the issues stem from a *velocity system not actually being achieved* and necessary options not being offered the majority of the time.  This has been frustrating seeing as every issue I'll be listing is easily fixable, but attention is never given to improving them because of the stigma surrounding controllers.\n\nNow before I get into this, this will not be a comparison between mice and sticks.  I would like to avoid devolving into that.  There's a certain level of accuracy you should be able to manage with controllers that is heavily stunted by these issues.\n\n\n#Issues:\n\n**Non-circular Deadzones**\n\nNon-circular deadzones are very common in games, with squares being the most common of these.  Non-circular deadzones means the amount of stick movement you have to make before you see acceleration differs based on the direction you point the stick.  Square/axial deadzones in specific also have a side affect of restricting how much of the stick can create diagonal movement.\n\nVideo example between circles, squares and rounded squares: https://youtu.be/e5fsPRJubOw\n\n\n**Restricted diagonal movement**\n\nI've mentioned square deadzones can restrict regions of the stick from creating diagonal movement, and this is by far the leading cause of this issue, but there are intentional methods to achieve this.  Games like [DOOM2016](https://imgur.com/Wwlt1Og) will restrict diagonal movement by angle, [Skyrim](https://imgur.com/bTM8Tsb) by whatever it's doing, [Bioshock Infinite](https://imgur.com/TR00slD) carrying the square issue while using a circular deadzone and [Red Dead Redemption](https://imgur.com/4NFXZam) combines both the side effects of a square and intentional angle restricting.  While it's important to note that in most cases no diagonal movement is technically lost, having the diagonal movement shifted still makes all the diagonal movement wrong.  If you want to make subtle angles with the cursor, you'll have to make drastic angles with the stick to break into the regions that allow diagonal movement.\n\nLosing diagonal movement can make aiming feel extremely clunky and the incorrect diagonals make aiming less predictable.\n\n**Poor Acceleration**\n\nThere have been a myriad of ways games have flubbed acceleration.  This can be done by poorly normalizing the acceleration, meaning the diagonal/cardinal acceleration can be different at the same stick movements or diagonal acceleration can be slower or faster, and/or by having a sharp jump in accelertation after a certain threshold of stick movement.  Additionally, the deadzone shape can warp these values(even if normalized relative to itself) so acceleration isn't consistent with stick movements on various angles.\n\nGames can also set a high minimum starting turn speed(acceleration should start at 0, and other values should follow some curve) which can make precise adjustements difficult regardless of skill level.\n\n**Aim smoothing**\n\nThis could be added to acceleration, but it deserves its own section.  For those unaware, aim smoothing causes your turn rate to build up over time.  So for example, if you moved the stick some distance and expected to turn 100'/sec, you'd actually start turning at a lower speed.  Your turn rate would increase over a certain time until it reached at 100'/sec speed *without the player moving the stick at all.*  For those PC gamers reading this, this is functionally the same as mouse smoothing on PC and carries all the same issues.  This can make aiming feel sluggish and extremely unpredictable, but has seen a larger surge of popularity in games in recent years despite having no benefit to the player.\n\nAnyone whose played Assassin's Creed has experienced extreme levels of it, but heavy levels exist in Skyrim, Dishonored 2, Dead Space, Bioshock Infinite and others.\n\n**Limited/Incorrect options**\n\nWhile it's changing slowly, still very few games offer more than a single sensitivity option, occasionally two.  This is not enough for thumbsticks.  Thumbsticks require at least deadzone size and acceleration curve options.\n\nDeadzone options are necessary because thumbstick lean can vary drastically between players and the quality/wear of the controller.  Having a large static value may avoid drift for most players, but is a waste for those who don't need it, and larger deadzones have a big effect of the accuracy of players.\n\nThe acceleration curve controls how the stick magnitude relates to the acceleration.  An option would control the intensity of the function controlling how the acceleration increases.  This should be an option because an ideal acceleration curve can vary between players, and preference on the curve can also vary based on sensitivity and deadzone size.\n\nA single sensitivity option wouldn't normally be an issue, but separate X and Y sensitivities are necessary if the X/Y ratio for the game is not 1:1, which is normally the case.  In many games, the vertical sensitivity is lower than the horizontal which causes two main issues.  The first is it can be unintuitive to the player.  Second, and even more important, it makes all diagonal movement wrong, with bias towards the more sensitive axis.  Having a different sensitivity ratio alters the direction vector so the cursor won't travel in the expected direction.\n\nAim assist would be a forth.  This isn't part of the core aiming mechanics, but it can have major effects on your aim.  This should never be forced regardless of the player's opinion on it.\n\nSo 3 core options and a 4th being aim assist.  Any other options like smoothing or edge acceleration are only necessary when implemented.\n\nIncorrect options are also present in a number of games.  Games like Rainbow 6, Halo 5, Paladins have offered deadzone options, but none of them are accurate.  Some games have offered X/Y sensitivity but the options scale differently from each other.  Others with aim assist options also do not fully remove it.\n\n**No consistency between games**\n\nThis isn't an issue for the set up specifically, but it doesn't help at all when switching between games.  Games differ between deadzone sizes, shapes, diagonal movement, acceleration, aim smoothing or available options.  There is no standard for controller aiming quality.\n\n\n**Specific Game Deadzones**\n\nHalo 2/CE: [Deadzone](https://imgur.com/VfRgoi0) | [Dotgraph](https://imgur.com/e7wrdZ6)\n\nHalo 5: [Deadzone](https://imgur.com/UZ1WMki) |\n\nHalo Wars 2: [Deadzone](https://imgur.com/TDH5ugy) |\n\nDestiny 1/2: [Deadzone](https://imgur.com/GEVDkJn) | [Dotgraph](https://imgur.com/OgpuQgW)\n\nCoD Blops: [Deadzone](https://imgur.com/Y6pqCGq) | [Dotgraph](https://imgur.com/7Uoqnmt)\n\nBioshock Infinite: [Deadzone](https://imgur.com/TR00slD) | [Dotgraph](https://imgur.com/aShIh9r)\n\nCounter Strike GO: [Deadzone](https://imgur.com/AYY5yI7) | [Dotgraph](https://imgur.com/LOBFJ2f)\n\nUnreal Tournament 3: [Deadzone](https://imgur.com/D6JRF89) | [Dotgraph](https://imgur.com/BEtiqAl)\n\nDOOM2016: [Deadzone](https://imgur.com/Wwlt1Og) | [Dotgraph](https://imgur.com/apomyYF)\n\nSkyrim: SE: [Deadzone](https://imgur.com/bTM8Tsb) | [Dotgraph](https://imgur.com/hz3zMQ3)\n\nLeft 4 Dead 2: [Deadzone](https://imgur.com/ryxq497) |\n\nGrand Theft Auto V: [Deadzone](https://imgur.com/szGPJCv) | [Dotgraph](https://imgur.com/1jF05Pp)\n\nOverwatch: [Deadzone](https://imgur.com/MdCArkM) | [Dotgraph](https://imgur.com/UgLHrsp)\n\nTitanfall 2: [Deadzone](https://imgur.com/TeFMaPD) | [Dotgraph](https://imgur.com/ttNdTqO)\n\nPainkiller H&amp;D: [Deadzone](https://imgur.com/jVlceaH) | [Dotgraph](https://imgur.com/efZCzuS)\n\nQuake Arena Arcade: [Deadzone](https://imgur.com/qRMJJdg) |\n\nSerious Sam HD: [Deadzone](https://imgur.com/omTloiy) | [Dotgraph](https://imgur.com/GorF0UI)\n\nSUPERHOT: [Deadzone](https://imgur.com/QU4Ekij) | [Dotgraph](https://imgur.com/ZK8dlj7)\n\nTurok 1&amp;2 Remaster: [Deadzone](https://imgur.com/bC82Lla) | [Dotgraph](https://imgur.com/81qJ4sR)\n\n\nHere are just a handful of games I've tested.  Of course, these don't illustrate any issues with the general acceleration, but you can see a lot of the issues from these graphs.  The quality varies wildly between these games and only a relatively small handful use modest deadzones in combination with circular deadzones.  Unfortunately, the arena-styled shooters have traditionally been given some of the worst controls on console(UT3, Quake 3, Serious Sam, Painkiller), which only exacerbates the stereotypes surrounding controller competence in that genre specifically.\n\nI've included Halo Wars mainly to show this doesn't just affect shooters or cursor movement but everything.  This negatively affects all types of cursor movement, and is why we see aim assist even being applied in cursor based menus in Destiny or AC: Origins when that should be ridiculous.\n\nOf these listed games, only really CoD, Overwatch and Titanfall 2 have a proper velocity system, and of those Titanfall 2 is the only game that offers every basic option(and more covering \"turning\" and ADS options).\n\nWe've seen games like Battlefield 1 offer deadzone and acceleration options as well as Overwatch offer acceleration curve options(Aim Ease) which are good improvements, but not quite there(OW needs deadzones, and BF1 needs curve options), but these games are still heavy outliers.  There are also a number of other games that do implement proper velocity systems, but also cripple themselves by not having adequate options.\n\n#Implementation\n\nDespite some comments I've seen over the years, creating a proper aiming system is not difficult.\n\nThis blogpost has been linked a number of times, and it's a great representations of everything I've shown here, but I'll expand on the sample psuedo-code it offers.  [Doing Thumbstick Deadzones Right](http://www.third-helix.com/2013/04/12/doing-thumbstick-dead-zones-right.html)\n\n    sensitivity = 100;\n    deadzone = 0.15;\n    outerDeadzone = 1.00;\n    degree = 2;\n\n    magnitude;\n    angle;\n    acceleration;\n\n\n    RstickX = [R stick input]/[stick resolution];                              //converts input range to 0-1 range\n    RstickY = [R stick input]/[stick resolution];                              //converts input range to 0-1 range\n\n    angle = Atan2(RstickY, RstickX);\n\n    magnitude = sqrt( pow(RstickX, 2) + pow(RstickY, 2) );\n\n    if( magnitude &gt; deadzone )\n        acceleration = ( magnitude - deadzone )/( outerDeadzone - deadzone ); //scales range so 0-1 range starts after the deadzone.\n        acceleration = pow( acceleration, degree );                              //raises\n    \n    else\n        acceleration = 0;                                                     //sets values below the deadzone to zero\n\n    if (acceleration &gt; 1)\n        acceleration = 1;                                                     //ensures acceleration is normalized\n\n    rotationX = cos(angle)*acceleration*sensitivity;\n    rotationY = sin(angle)*acceleration*sensitivity;\n\nI'm far from a competent programmer so I'm sure this could be cleaned up a bit, but this is all you need to create an idealized aiming system.  This is what makes up games like Overwatch's, Titanfall's and CoD's core aiming.  You don't need to invest years into implementing a circular deadzone, correct diagonal movement and normalized acceleration.  Even without any options aside from sensitivity, this aiming system is above the grand majority of games.  Adding options for the deadzone size and degree would make it uncontested among anything but Titanfall 2.\n\nHere is a graph of what this looks like and what the given options would change: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/idygzo2fhi\n\nYou can of course modify this to include separate X/Y sensitivities, ADS sensitivity, edge/turn acceleration and smoothing.\n\n\n#Conclusion\n\nHopefully I've been able to show these problems adequately.  Controller aiming can be significantly better simply by changing the way the input is handled and offering a few of options.\n\nI also want to reiterate that while the system I've described and especially Titanfall 2's additional options are what I'd consider idealized, these are *basic* velocity system with options.  There have been attempts to mimic mouse acceleration for thumbsticks(cursor moves faster the faster you move the stick) in the M&amp;KB emulator [Antimicro's Extra Acceleration options](https://imgur.com/2834Crf) and seemingly in [GEN1US's emulator](https://youtu.be/qdbh8ggQti8), to allow faster turn rates while maintaining easily accessible precise speeds.  This is something developers could be looking into at this point, but we're still getting AAA games with incorrect diagonal movement and no deadzone options.\n\n**Edit**: fixed code error",

        "text": "We all know music and scent are two senses tied intimately to our brains memory centre, and extension, to nostalgia. \n\nBut because gaming technology has not (yet) delved into smelling technology, music is a strong force in evoking nostalgia back to games. But, at least in my experience, only to games with strong musical themes and scores. \n\nWhen I think of ''immersion' in a videogame,  I do not think of a thousand mechanics that seek to simulate the complexities of reality and our bodies, but rather a combination of audio visual elements that describe a world.\n\nAnd because this world can only be described in two senses, our eyes and our ears, each are so important. Hence why graphics are held in such importance in a game without much exposition in text. Yet I feel that many games that seek to deliver an immersive experience underestimate the power of music on our belief in the virtual world, and its descriptive power. \n\nA good score and sound design I believe can carry average visuals into the realms of the truly magical. \n\nIn Knights of the Old Republic I believe the sound design and planet songs did an amazing job in describing everything the visuals could not. The peaceful pipes of Manaan, the harps on Dantooine. \n\nI think the Witcher 3 and The Elder Scrolls series have both incredible scores, but also incredibly different ones in tone. Because the games in tone and also so different. I cannot help but think that without the music both worlds would be less actualized. \n\nLastly, as much as I do appreciate what Breath of the Wild did in its minimalist sound design and sense of fresh air and space that is conveyed, I truly do believe I would have simply understood the world more, and fallen into it, if I could have heard the world described to me. Music can fill spaces, and I know it would have been magical to hear sweeping chords resounding in the empty grass fields. \n\nSo essentially what I mean to describe is the importance of music in giving a world an individual personality, and its power as a descriptive force to the player. \n\nWhat do you fellas think ?

        "text": "The first time I really thought about melee combat and what I like or don't like about is when I bought **Dark Souls 1** (years and years ago). I played it for a few hours and at one point I put down the controller and realized: this is not fun and is never going to be fun. The dodging the opponent and timing your attack is tedious. I can absolutely understand why this is satisfying for a lot players and why they like the game, but it's not for me. \n\nThen we have **traditional 1st/3rd person RPGs**. Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, Gothic, Elex etc. etc. Some of those games have more polished controls than others, but again, I wouldn't say the combat was fun. I play RPGs for the story, the world, the atmosphere and like to go dispatch enemies so that I can get better and level up. \n\n**Action RPGs** like Kingdoms of Amalur and Shadow of Mordor, where combat is mainly supposed to look and feel good are more what I find engaging. Shadow of Mordor is the perfect example: story meh, the world empty (except for enemies), relatively little sense of progression because of the difficulty, but the combat was imho special. Of course it was easy and I would've wished for some more control, e.g. that I can control the finishing move, but it was great to look at. The nemesis system helped a lot, too, and I'm not sure the combat alone would've been enough to keep me hooked. \n\nI recently watched someone play Monster Hunter: World and I figured out something else that I liked about SoM: the enemies were reacting to your hits. Obviously a massive monster is not gonna stagger every time you hit it, but it's something I would miss. SoM was particularly good in this because of the lack of control you had, so the moves your guy pulled off feel like they had some weight behind it. \n\n___________\n\nThat's it, I just wanted to share my thought and wondered how it is for other players. \n",

Quite early I noticed a problem: The games are not easily attributed to just one genre!\n\nThis is not a problem for people who just order their games very roughly by the \"main genre\" of that game. But for people like me who like to further categorize their games it becomes an incredible difficult task to do if one does not want to end up with 50 categories that only contain two or three games!\n\nExamples:\n\nSure. Both Skyrim and Mount and Blade are RPGs. They both have character creation, skills, equipment, combat and so on. Yet I am sure everyone here will ackknowledge that there are vast differences between the two.\nNow one could just assign Mount and Blade to the Action genre instead but then you get into the problem of how in the world it is supposed to be similar to Action games like Battlestations: Midway.\n\nOr you assign it to a more specific genre Action-RPG but isn't Diablo also an Action-RPG? Hell in fact Skyrim is. So you just assign Skyrim to a genre called Open World RPGs right? But Mount and Blade does have that too. \n\nOr take Company of Heroes 2 and Age of Empires 2. Both have units, base building, ressources, real-time, etc.. yet nobody will say they only differ in their setting and are otherwise easily put into the same category.\n\nThere are countless more examples but I think I got the point across. There are so many games nowadays that include elements of many different genres that it is super hard to easily categorize them.\n\nIs this a problem for you as well? Or are you satisfied with few \"super categories\" like RPG, Strategy, etc...?",

        "text": "In the good old days, consoles were _the_ way to play games. You had a PlayStation, not a PC! Nowadays, though, consoles are essentially just mid-range PCs. The PS4 and Xbox One don’t do anything that a PC for the same price can’t do.\n\nI recently saw [an old forum post posted over 21 years ago](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rec.games.video.nintendo/6cXaqHbZtmo/mpwbfZp484sJ) that claimed the following: “PC\ngames will never be as good as home gaming systems.  They will be far, far superior.” Oh, how times have changed.\n\nNow, this makes me wonder: How long will console gaming stay alive? Will people keep buying PlayStation and Xbox consoles when pre-built PCs and separate PC parts become more acessible and cheaper every year?\n\nThis topic is similar to newspapers. Why do newspapers exist when you can just use a computer, a phone, a tablet, or… well, any electronic device in your house to read or watch the news for free?\n\nWhen it comes to Nintendo, there was a lot of talk about Nintendo possibly planning to leave the hardware scene before the Switch’s release, but with the huge success of the Switch, that seems very unlikely anytime soon. The Switch will most likely live on for up to six or seven years and will get several new models over the years, but what’ll happen in ten years—or fifteen years—or thirty years? Will Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft eventually make the move to PC? You can already play any Xbox One game on your computer with Microsoft’s Xbox Play Anywhere service available for Windows 10, so it’s only a matter of time before Sony and, eventually, Nintendo will do the same… right? Every PlayStation and Xbox game, aside from exclusives, are available on PC anyway.\n\nPerhaps, in the future, every new and old game will be on Steam. Or maybe Nintendo and Sony, or even other companies, will create their own video game distribution platforms. Maybe Nintendo could have their own platform on Windows and Mac that would be similar to Steam and would allow you to play old and new Nintendo games.\n\nJudging from the sales and fanbases for each console, consoles don’t exactly seem to be a dying technology, so this reality would have to be very far off, but, perhaps, in the future, instead of a PlayStation 5 and an Xbox Two, the PC market would be the only market left in gaming.\n\nWhat do you think?",

Basically, a lot of people believe that the remaster should be free for owners of the original.\n\nThe two most common arguments I see are that the changes made in the remaster are minimal and aren't worth the money, and that many other games that release Remastered/GOTY/Enhanced/etc. editions gave them for free to existing owners of the original such as BioShock, Divinity: Original Sin, Darksiders, and Skyrim. The first argument has merit judging by comparison videos and the list of changes we've seen so far but I wanted to hear you all's opinions of the second argument.\n\nPersonally I think paying for a remaster is completely fine. Updated textures, lighting, and adding mechanics takes time and resources. It's the nature of software that something released 6 years ago is going be outdated and not everything can just be patched in. If you think the game should be cheaper that's one thing but claiming that you should get it for free comes off as entitled. I've always seen instances of other developers doing that as incredibly generous but it seems like now it's happened enough times that it should be considered standard.\n\nWhat do you all think?",

Between overpopulation of mostly inaccessible Battle Royale games and Youtube videos that are rarely subtitled (both which I'll on about later) gaming is becoming a medium I'm slowly losing my passion for.\n\nIn this thread I'll be pointing out dire trends that are ruining the industry for almost everyone not \"able-bodied\".\n\nDeaf gamers are getting the shortest side of the stick. Funnily enough, last decade we had the upper hand. But lets get to the meat of what is happening for us that developers, fans and creators need to be aware of!\n\n-Battle Royale-\n\nCurrently a genre worth billions, but so damn inaccesible for deaf players. It's not even the genre. It has plenty of potential. But let me get this straight, what was Epic Games' motivator to add more visual cues to make Fortnite Mobile at the very least \"playable\" without need for audio... Cause able-bodied people can't hear it on the go... WTF? The cues they added weren't even on the DESKTOP or CONSOLE version because \"able-bodied people will have an advantage using accessibility options.\" Reeeeaaaalllllyyyyy?\n\nBut now HERE is the stinker that made me REALLY lose hope.\n\n-Overwatch-\n\nI am a bloody HUGE fan of Overwatch, don't get me wrong. If only I could actually, you know PLAY IT. In Overwatch, Blizzard STRIVES for it to be accessible to \"everyone\". What do they do? Make it the most sound-dependent shooter on the market just to spit in our face. Just to rub salt in the wound, subtitles aren't a thing. ISN'T THIS REQUIRED BY LAW? Like WTF?\n\n-Youtube-\n\nEver follow a personality for their text-based ramblings? Do they even exist anymore? This is probably the most powerful point here cause Youtube is ruining it for us deaf gamers.\n\nThe absolute pity and rage I get from seeing an audio-dependent discussion on YouTube that 10 years ago would've been an awesome readable blog post, just can't be described. As a real middle finger, subtitles are a rare gem of a thing on YT. So fellow deaf gamers, **good luck with finding the right info on your next purchase**\n\nRIP Text.\n\n-Multiplayer in general-\n\nDevs can't cater to EVERYONE in a multiplayer game right? But they make the most money so lets kill off single player! *coughEAcough*\n\nI personally find it absolutely disgusting how multiplayer, teamwork etc. is becoming the centre of gaming when deaf accessibility usually gets thrown out the window. We can't communicate nor coordinate and I feel we'll be left out in the dust soon.\n\n--\n\nSo between multiplayer, video on demand and lack of awareness, I feel things need to change. But... How?",

But as new games kept coming out, I was very surprised at all these things that just stayed constant. \n\n\n\nI once asked my friends who were really into league of legends, \"Why three lanes?\", why not two? why not ten? why each champion in a lane? Why even have 'lanes' to begin with. Why not just have a battlefield in which the AI just kind of randomly traverse through. They really didn't have much of an answer besides that this is how its been. \n\n\n\n\nWhy no other maps (excluding HOTS), why no map objectives (excluding HOTS, not talking about bosses like roshan/dragon/red-blue jungle camps etc), why even have the jungle? Why are the map sizes the way they are? Why always health and mana, gold, items and a shop, last hitting, etc etc? Why are there usually four abilities, one being an ultimate? \n\n\n\nMy background is in RTS games, and each RTS game usually mixes up the formula a bit. In those games, you have hundreds of maps, big and small. You have 1v1, 2v2, free for all, custom games, etc. I know mobas like League of Legends and DOTA 2 are just getting into this field but I feel like it has just stagnated for years now.\n\n\n\nThe only game I've seen really shake things up is Heroes of the Storm. I don't particularly like some design decisions but there are features they implemented which are awesome to see. Removed the concept of items, talents that you build while playing, map based objectives, multiple maps, towers with ammo (i can't believe this was removed), destructible walls, players getting into 'vehicles' like the Dragon Knight or Garden Terror. Why can't we see more games innovate like that?\n\n\nThe genre is a multiplayer online battle arena, so why not take advantage of the freedom that genre implies? Hell even games like quake fit that description. I'm surprised we don't have MOBAs on randomly generated maps where no team has an advantage (since no team knows the map) or MOBAs where you don't just control one hero, maybe three. Why is it that every MOBA just seems to follow a strict formula (with minor tweaks) while every other genre often has massive breakthroughs. I'm also noticing this trend in Battle Royales.\n\n\nWould love to hear some thoughts from people more invested into MOBAs.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/8eg142/spoilers_god_of_war_2018_how_its_conflict_between/",
        "text": "**Early-to-mid game God of War spoilers ahead!**\n\nSo I just finished God of War and, I must say, the game exceeded *all* of my expectations. It's not 'GOTG' material in my opinion, but in terms of game design, combat 'feel' and overall presentation it's stellar on almost all fronts. However, I have one major issue with the game that EDGE Magazine, who gave the game a controversial '8/10', agrees with, and that is the game's pacing. \n\nEssentially, the game has one main goal, which is to scatter Kratos' wife's ashes at \"the tallest peak in all the realms.\" It's a classic \"get from A to B,\" story, and that is not the issue. What is the problem, however, is that the game's actual structure is that of a central hub 'wheel' with multiple 'spokes' going out from it. It's clear why the game designers chose to implement a hub-based design; it allows for the re-use of assets without things feeling too cheap, it's genuinely interesting in terms of world design and it makes sense within the story's lore and world. Yet, despite my understanding of why they chose this structure I felt that it's implementation into the story itself hampered the experience to a level that I simply couldn't ignore. \n\nWhy? Well, the discrepancy between story structure and game structure meant that the actual objectives you go for in-game are, for the most part, side-tracks. They push you forward towards the goal, but because they aren't geographically in the way to your final objective and they don't accumulate towards it, they feel 'artificial'  The majority of your time in the story is spent being side-tracked, with 9 of the 13 'main' chapters (i.e. not just a cutscene/single combat arena) in the game entirely dedicated to being side-tracked. Of course that doesn't mean these parts can't be effective story-wise, but for the majority the actual goals hold as much resonance to me *and* the characters as a glorified side-quest. This is no better exemplified by the early Alfheim chapter where, because the structure dictates your goal to be 'find the macguffin', the actually interesting part of ending the Dark/Light Elf war and questioning whether it's right to do so is just brushed aside and falls flat. Hell, even the characters start to complain about the issue by the end. The worst part, though is how It makes the pacing of the overall story feel entirely repetitive, as you essentially go through the same structure 9+ times just to reach a total of two main objectives. \n\nHowever, this could have been fixed, and quite easily, in fact. Right now the game follows a structure very much like:\n\n1) Kratos and Boy start travelling to X\n\n2) Oh no! They can't get to X without going to Y and collecting/doing Z\n\n3) They go to Y and collect/do Z\n\n4) They travel to X\n\n5) Repeat\n\nWith some simple re-structuring of the game's narrative the 2nd and 3rd steps should have, instead, be accumulative towards the 4th, with multiple '2s' and '3s' before you get to that goal. If done well it would, instead of your goal being ripped away from you every time you get near, make it so that you're always working towards it. It would also inadvertently make the water lowering around Tyr's Temple more than just a gate blocking your way to side content. This is the same narrative structure found in many, many other games including, but not limited to, most of the Zelda series and most of the Souls franchise, and I think it would have worked fine here without too much in the way of changes to the story. \n\nThat brings me to the final point; how world design can influence story design. Large, free-roam open worlds and hub-based \"wheel and spoke\" designed worlds generally do not lend themselves well to an entirely one-goal story. The Witcher 3, for example, fell into much the same trap as God of War in that every goal was just \"go to place, Ciri's somewhere else, go somewhere else\"; though it made up for it through sheer scale and meaningful interactions with the world's inhabitants. In that game and in God of War the ratio of roadblocks to progress felt too high. Meanwhile, in the overused example of Dark Souls, the structure of ringing the bells, going through Anor Londo, and then finding the Lord Souls felt like everything you did was putting you at least some small way to the game's two main objectives. \n\nI can't really think of a great conclusion but, yeah, I wanted to put these thoughts into words and I hope they made at least some lick of sense! \n\n\n",

        "text": "First, i apologize for not having really good examples of the phenomenon I'm trying to explain. I only have a general idea of what I'm looking for. I'm hoping for a little help from my fellow enthusiasts here.\n\nA few hours into a game, we generally have an understanding of what the rest of the game will be about. We might not have any clue about what will happen in the game regarding the story, enemies, or even all of the mechanics. But a few hours in we've generally seen the pattern. I'm going to list a few examples here. Obviously some spoilers.\n\n**Skyrim**: a few hours in, we've learned (among other things) about fighting and magic mechanics; quests and leveling. We've learned that enemies get tougher, that all caves have a shortcut to the exit, that there are cities (probably a few of them) and other places to discover; that companions can be hired and that they each have their own quest line (or was that only Fallout?)\n\n**Horizon Zero dawn**: a few hours in, we've learned (among other things, obviously) that there are different weapons in the game, that will allow us to overcome more dangerous enemies; that we will get new skills by leveling; that we will find more powerful coils as we go; that we can buy stuff from vendors; that yellow ropes in the mountains means path we can climb; that there are bandit camps with patrols and an alarm system that can't go off; that tallnecks are to be climbed, which will make a new portion of the map visible.\n\nHZD is actually a good example of what I'm trying to highlight (bear with me): we know a LOT about which concepts the game will contain by just going through the menus. It says how many enemy types there are to discover, and generally tells a lot of what there is to be found (banuk figures, hunting trials and so forth).\n\n Another example, which is less obvious about what it will contain. \n\n**Bloodborne**: A few hours into the game, we know (among other things) the fighting and movement mechanics; how blood echoes work; that new weapons can be found and upgraded to become more powerful; that the level design always uses shortcuts (or hidden paths) that quickly will take you back to bossfights; that you are trapped in a \"nightmare fog\" during bossfights; that you'll get insight, item drop and find a lamp after killing a boss.\n \nNow, this is not a bad thing. Not at all. Explaining the concepts, and sticking to them, creates reasonable expectations. It makes for a coherent, engaging experience. But the downside of always sticking to your already-established concepts is that we gamers sort whatever the game throws at us into these categories. Examples:\n\n**Skyrim:**\n\n+ \"Another cave. I Wonder what the boss at the end has in his chest\"; \"I wonder which of these rocks in the dungeon entrance hides the quick exit.\"\n\n+ \"Another city. \"I wonder what the vendors have to sell; \"I hope there are some good companions to find here\".\n\n**Horizon Zero Dawn:**\n\n+ \"I wonder which theme this hunting ground will have.\"\n\n+ \"I wonder which enemy this cauldron will have at the end\"\n\n+ \"I wonder what i'll see on the map after climbing this tallneck\"\n\n**Bloodborne**\n\n+ \"I wonder what this weapons' strengths are\"\n\n+ I wonder how this boss will attack me\"\n\nAgain, knowing what to expect while playing is not a bad thing at all. But my thought is when you know what to expect, you are never surprised. Very few games try to subvert the expectations that you gained after a few hours of gameplay, and my hypothesis is that these subversions would work pretty often (and totally depending on how it's done of course).\n\nTo sum it up, the expectations that i would like to se subverted more often are the ones that concern what's in the game and not, after hours of gameplay. I'm not talking about plot. I'm not talking about \"more of the same\", but rather something that's different. I'll list some examples: that do work, and a few i've made up.\n\n**Skyrim:**\n\n+ when you enter Blackreach, it subverts the expectations of what a cave/dungeon has been in the game so far. For many players, finding this place is the most rewarding moment in the game. I think part of it is due to subversion of the expectation. \n\n**Horizon:**\n\n+ I'm sure there are times that HZD subverted expectations, but I can't think of any (remember, we're not talking plot here), so I’ll make up a few examples instead.\n\n+ Maybe the expectation of the tallnecks’ behaviour could be subverted by one of them becoming hostile after you’ve climbed it. Just this one time, climbing it triggers a cutscene and then an unexpected fight.\n\n+ In one of the bandit camps, one of the enemies trigger a dialog when you’re going for a stealth kill. Suddenly you have a quest given to you in way you did not expect.\n\n+ There is a climbing path that doesn’t have the yellow markings. Ok, this is pretty insignificant, but still.\n\n+ In one of the portions of the map you unlock late in the game, you start finding objects that don’t belong to any of the categories the game has introduced so far.\n\n**Bloodborne:** Admittedly, this game already subverts a lot of the expectations, which IMHO is part of why it’s a great game.\n\n+ It takes (or might take) a long time before you realize that objects can be used for interacting with enemies/npc:s. Like the music box.\n\n+ Dialog choices. This mechanic is introduced pretty late in the game (unless i missed it).\n\n+ Being captured by the bag-monster. This concept is not introduced until late, and it feels pretty new and unexpected when it happens.\nIdeas:\n\n+ One of the weapons you find doesn’t behave like a normal weapon. Instead it turns into an enemy when you’ve made your first upgrade to it. This also subverts the expectation of the hunters dream being free of enemies.\n\n+ One of the bosses doesn’t have to be killed; is gone when you go through the nightmare fog to face it for the second time. I don’t know, but you get the idea.\n\nNote that my examples aren’t necessarily things that would work in the forementioned games. I hope that they do convey my idea of working against expectations. \n\nI do realize that a lot of the subversions aren’t really subversions if they happen several times. If it happens a few times, it’s a game concept/mechanic on it’s own, and one that will start expecting. I also realize that some of my examples (though not all of them) are cost-inefficient. For instance making a tallneck that fights in HZD. Of course they’d not want to build that whole thing to use it only once.\n\nMy point, though, is that many games would benefit from the developers looking at what the players have come to expect after, say, 50 percent of the game, and then ask themselves if something we take for granted by now could be flipped over. Not in a cheap way, but creatively. I think that this question might keep us players on our toes and provide some unforgettable moments.\n\nThanks for reading this far. Do you have any thoughts on when subverting expectations work and not (if ever)? Do you have any examples of when it’s done right? Ideas of how existing games could have subverted your expectations in a good way but didn’t?",

        "text": "Over the years it seems there has been a shift in the way we judge game length and what we consider value for money. I remember a time when 8 to 12 hours was the norm for most action games. I remember a time when people would actually criticise a game if it was too long. But now it's like there is no such thing as too long. The majority seem to have decided that longer games with more content = better.\n\nBut why can't games be too long? I would like to ask those same people if they also think a film can never be too long... Or a song? Why are games as an entertainment medium treated differently? The bottom line is that there's a reason most films aren't 4 hours long, most songs don't go on for 15 minutes, and most books don't have 1000 pages. Most of them would be worse off for it. So why does every game need to last 40 fucking hours now?\n\nI would argue that most games at least in the \"AAA\" sphere these days are too long, and are worse off for it. They outstay their welcome and don't respect my time, because they are only interested in squeezing as many hours as possible out of me. It affects pacing and can lessen the impact of the story, it can induce fatigue and boredom, make everything too predictable, and I can get to the end of a game in a mindset where *I'm glad it's over*, even if I actually enjoyed the ride.\n\nWhen I replay some of my favourite games from my late childhood and teens (we're talking late-90s to mid-00s releases), I find that most of them are a perfect length. They're not short enough to leave me wanting more, but not long enough that I feel they're starting to take the piss. Ironically, these tend to be the kind of games that I play over and over again (through many years), because I want to experience the journey again. They are cohesive creations that are more memorable and more interesting to me than the 40 hour time wasters, which I will forget about the moment I finish them.\n\nMy opinion is that just like films, games should be as long as they *need* to be. A 60 hour game is fine, but you'd better make sure the gameplay, the story, and everything else warrants what I would personally consider an obscene length. Likewise, a 10 hour game is fine, if it's better that way. I will respect your game a lot more if it also respects me, and I will happily pay $60 for a 10 hour great experience that I will fondly remember. I know that's strange now, but I swear it didn't use to be.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/8ecdh6/how_expectations_hinder_the_evolution_of_a_genre/",
        "text": "In my opinion expectations hinder the evolution of all genres and mediums. I should also make it clear that the expectations are not the problem. Problem is the way consumers generally respond when the expectations are not met.\n\n**Edit.** A good example of expectations almost hindering evolution in gameplay is Demon Souls. The initial reception of that game was not very good. After people began to understand it, a whole new sub genre was formed. And the combat system continues to evolve other titles as well. \n\n**Edit.** Discussing with Kurkpitten actually reminded me with another relevant example. I have seen many Assassins Creed fans being very negative towards the new combat system in AC:O even if there has been very little innovation since AC II, but after actually giving it a fair chance many have actually come to love it. It's fascinating to me how much power we sometimes give our preconceptions.\n \nIn my post I'd like to focus in a few genres especially from the perspective of combat mechanics that currently bother me. All these genres have long roots in the past and might have done mechanics a certain way based on technical or other non creative limitations. Despite improved circumstances, many of these mechanics remain to this day. I'm not suggesting that these systems are not following the demands of the majority, I'm simply speculating on how much of those demands are molded by the preconceptions set by our past experiences, or done so simply because that's how it has always been done. Do the consumers and developers fear the unexpected regarding the core mechanics and let preconceptions restrict them and why?\n\nThese are mostly just generalizations and my personal opinions. Also my English is not the greatest, but I hope I'll get my point across.\n\n**Fighting systems in Diablo like ARPG's**. Originally when Diablo and other similar titles established the genre, the gameplay loop felt amazing. While the combat was lacking it was acceptable since the theorycrafting of builds and abundance of loot has been the main attraction for me. Many say the simple gameplay was because of the poor internet connections back in the day, which is understandable.\n\nNow years later, while the genre has evolved with games like PoE, Grim Dawn and Diablo 3, the gameplay mechanics have stayed largely the same. Mainly you hold one button and watch hundreds of enemies explode. I believe western people have come to expect this simplicity out of habit. The same problem doesn't seem to be prevalent in Asian ARPG's like Lost Ark, Lineage Eternal or even Divilion. I get that many enjoy the effortless instant gratification, but I don't think this genre should be defined by it.\n\nLet's compare this genre with MOBA's. Diablo like ARPG's offer very passive gameplay with little to no reactive abilities, like dodges, blocks or counters. Little abilities that provide mobility, combo with each other or have different kind of aiming zones. Less restrictive cooldowns or need to use more than one ability per situation. Little to no reason to change rotations or tactics depending on the situation. I'm not expecting all of these to be in an ARPG, nor that they make the combat necessarily better, I just would hope to see some experimenting with more involving gameplay mechanics like these.\n\nI have the same problem with **fighting games**. The possibilities are limitless, yet most fighting games have been following the same formula since street fighter II. There are some notable differences between 3D fighters(Tekken) and different types of 2D fighters, like air dashers(Gulty Gear) chainbased ones(Killer Instinct) and games like smash. There are however not many fighting games that offer the same kind of three dimensional freedom or precision like Blade Symphony or Gunz for example. Chivalry was alright and I'm glad even Ubisoft tried something new with For Honor despite the shortcomings. \n\nHow about **CRPG's**?. It feels to me like many of this genres conventions originated from the technical limitations of the time just like in ARPG's. I really hope to see some radically new combat systems besides the ones we see in Pillars of Eternity or Divinity Original Sin. Party systems are also so prevalent yet I really enjoyed the single character fighting system in Age of Decadence for example.\n\nIMO Ultimately the negative response to failed expectations and lack of innovation probably stems from two main things. The evolutionary psychology of perceiving what is known as safe and the nostalgia factor of people wanting to relive their positive memories. These things affect the gameplay elements even more strongly since getting to know them requires more effort from the player. It's hard to blame the game devs for not wanting to take the monetary risks in order to remold these expectations. \n\nI guess I'm mainly interested in the developer and mass consumer psychology here. How much of these and other systems are affected by the psychological reasons connected to our expectations? Do others have similar problems regarding combat systems and what kind of innovation you would like to see? Have you had negative preconceptions towards a game mechanic and after giving it a fair chance actually liked it? What other reasons for the lack of innovation in gameplay mechanics are there besides time and money? How true do you think anything in this post is?\n\n**Edit.** trying to make the focus a bit more clear\n\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/8ebzxw/immersive_sim_is_a_design_philosophy_not_a_genre/",
        "text": "Gaming discussion has recently been inundated with the genre label \"immersive sim\". Although it evokes images of games like Microsoft Flight Simulator, European Truck Simulator, or even SimCity, the phrase was actually coined in 2000 by Warren Spector to describe Deus Ex. The term lay largely unknown to gaming communities until the release of Prey 2017 when people started to use the descriptor to describe a range of games mainly inspired by Warren Spector titles. Wikipedia describes an immersive sim as:\n\n&gt;  An immersive sim (simulation) is a video game genre that emphasizes player choice. Its core, defining trait is the use of simulated systems that respond to a variety of player actions which, combined with a comparatively broad array of player abilities, allow the game to support varied and creative solutions to problems, as well as emergent gameplay beyond what has been explicitly designed by the developer.\n\nGames given as examples of immersive sims include older titles such as Thief, Deus Ex and System Shock 2, as well as newer titles like Dishonored, Bioshock, Prey, Hitman and the Deus Ex reboots. It is even being retrospectively applied to older RPG titles like Morrowind, Vampire The Masquerade Bloodlines, Ultima and S.T.A.L.K.E.R. \n\nHowever I think as a genre descriptor, \"immersive sim\" is terrible. For me when someone says \"sim\" I get flashbacks of games like Flight Simulator or Truck Simulator - a realistic experience being simulated, not playing as an awesome stealthy transhuman assassin. The above description of an immersive sim is also so nebulous that you could apply to it many games. All games have some degree of simulated systems in them - it's why they're games. \n\nIn Crysis I can play a level however I like - you can go into super strength mode all guns blazing and kill all of your enemies by picking up things in the environment and chucking them at enemies, but you can also go through an entire level in stealth mode and not be seen or detected at all. Does this make Crysis or a similar game (like Metal Gear Solid V) an immersive sim? Similarly are Zelda games immersive sims? In Breath of the Wild a intuitive but complex physics and elemental system is simulated in game allowing for interactions between electricity, water and lightning. Older games involve using your items in certain areas to bypass certain obstacles, simulating the effect of a boomerang or similar item on an environment. The puzzles may be simple but they're logically simulating things like arrows being set on fire by torches and lighting other torches.\n\nThen you get to the entire RPG genre. Morrowind, a fantasy RPG, is cited as an immersive sim by some people. By this logic you could also cite Oblivion as one. Oblivion actually doubled down on the \"immersive\" elements by giving NPCs unique schedules and routines like eating, which could be famously exploited by poisoning an NPCs food source with apples. Similarly top down RPGs like Divinity Original Sin or Baldur's Gate have deep magic systems. The elemental mechanics in Divinity can be used to solve problems in and out of combat, and Baldur's Gate has complicated magic rulesets being simulated, featuring spelling, counter-spelling, and exploits in the game are still being discovered to this day. \n\nAnd that's not even touching on Dwarf Fortress and Nethack, survival games like Subnautica and The Long Night...\n\nSo when someone coming from a stealth action game like Dishonored looking for another \"immersive sim\" could be recommended anything from swords and sorcery RPGs to third person adventure games to text based dungeon crawlers, I think there's a classification problem with your genre. \n\nA subgenres game should be simple and evocative. As much as I dislike \"Soulslike\" you know what you're getting when someone recommends one, same with \"CRPG\" or \"Metroidvania\". Immersive sim is a poor genre descriptor because a wide variety of games which have vastly different gameplay could all potentially be classified as \"immersive sims\". However it's a good descriptor for a design principle and describing the underlying way in which elements of games can interact together.\n\n\n",

        "author": "Doglatine",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/8eaqar/opinion_harder_difficulty_settings_teach_you_a/",
        "text": "Over the last few years I've developed a preference for playing games on harder difficulties. This is despite the fact that I'm not a particularly skilled player, and also have relatively little time to play with a young child in the house. These days, I find playing on lower difficulties quite frustrating, and I've been thinking about why that is. Of course, I recognise that people have different reasons for playing and seek different experiences, so this is just my suggestion for why some people might get more out of playing (some games) on harder levels.\n\nIn short, I found with a number of titles that playing on easier difficulty settings left me with a poor understanding of how the game actually worked and how my actions contributed to my success. Was that scary boss actually easier than he looked, or did I get lucky, or was my decision to take a strength potion just before the fight a piece of tactical genius? Similarly, in a number of games, I found myself falling back on the same simple strategies, because I was never forced out of my comfort zone.\n\nSince then, I've been playing much more on harder difficulty settings, and I'm now convinced it teaches you more about how a game works. You quickly figure out which potions or buffs are helpful, because they're the ones that stop you dying. Luck still plays a role, but a much more marginal one. Similarly, it's hard to settle into a comfort zone if you're being challenged: if a game is well designed, then the only 'comfort zone' that exists will be an optimal or near-optimal strategy, which may vary from encounter to encounter and will probably take some finding.\n\nA bit more poetically, I think we can distinguish between the 'surface game' \n- the graphics, lore, special effects, etc. - and the 'deep game': the set of dynamic ultimately mathematical feedback systems that regulate progression. You learn about the deep game only via its intrusion into the surface game, which normally means via death or punishment. The deep game is like the rocks under the waves, and it's only when you're ploughing deep into the water that you bump up against them.\n\nOf course, there's not always a neat relationship between difficulty and game dynamics. Sometimes, harder difficulty settings just involve making enemies into bullet sponges, or penalising the player in arbitrary ways. The result of this can be that you find yourself having to adopt *different* strategies from those that are optimal on easier settings, so you're not really learning much about the deep game.\n\nI'll close with a specific example. Supergiant's awesome game Pyre got mostly positive reviews, but a few people (notably Zero Punctuation) said that the actual game dynamics in the 'rites' (the combat/sport sections) were lacklustre, and that despite the wide array of moves available, there wasn't much incentive to use them. This was my initial experience, but after bumping up the difficulty settings, I found the rites a lot more rewarding. Specifically, I was required to use all sorts of moves that I hadn't had to use before, and I gained a better grip on which strategies worked.",

        "text": "I was thinking about Overwatch's recent [Archives event](https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/events/archives/) the other day, and it struck me how deeply odd the idea of a temporary gamemode is compared to the way things worked not too long ago. For those who don't play Overwatch, there's a seasonal event currently going on where you can play through two co-op PvE missions (à la Battleborn, funnily enough). One of these is on (I think) a brand new map, is fully voice acted, has some level of cutscenes, all that jazz - things you would expect from a game with a decently high budget co-op campaign. None of this is a bad thing; I find them to be quite fun diversions from the normal game, and they were enough to get me to start playing the game more than an hour a month again.\n\nBut there is a problem: they are only playable between April 10th-30th. After that, they're gone, either forever or until April 2019 rolls around. A whole map, character backstory (if that's your thing), an entire *gamemode*, just completely, arbitrarily removed for no reason other than \"it's a seasonal event.\" This is not something new to Overwatch. The game's arcade cycles between available gamemodes on a daily basis. Wanna play capture the flag when it's not the soup of the day? Too bad. Are you and your friends into lockout elimination? Fuck you, here's two deathmatch playlists.\n\nOverwatch isn't even the only offender, either. Destiny 2 also has a form of this rotating gamemode system, as do Fortnite, CSGO, Hearthstone, and probably a number of other games I have yet to play. The question is, *why?*\n\nI used to spend ages playing jailbreak, deathrun, gungame, and such in Counter-Strike. They were diversions of a similar nature - somewhat clumsily tacked on to the basic game design, but still more than serviceable - but my fondness of them came from the fact that they were *always there*. The novelty of a new gamemode wasn't what was driving people to them, but the fact that they were allowed to just enjoy them whenever they wanted. This is not a problem of modern matchmaking, either. Global Offensive manages to have things in that vein (built-in gungame, the \"wingman\" modes, et cetera) and still run them through the standard casual matchmaking system, but for some reason Overwatch's even higher budget modes are destined to evaporate from the beginning.\n\nFiguring out the origin for this sort of thing is not very hard (MMORPG holiday events), but I can't grok the decision to turn \"merry Christmas, here's some snowballs and a Santa hat\" into \"you can only play CTF on the days I say you can.\" ",

        "text": "I've been turning this idea in my head over and over the past few days, I've been trying to decide if it's worth it to limit player choice in order to combat feelings of ludonarrative dissonance.\n\nIf you don't know, to quickly define ludonarrative dissonance, it is a unique problem that video games have in which in game actions don't quite match up to the narrative the game is trying to tell.  The popular example in Uncharted's Nathan Drake.  He's portrayed as a sarcastic, witty, everyman who's always got a snappy one liner at the ready.  And yet he murders hundreds of people per game and shows absolutely no remorse for it.  \n\nMy thoughts began as I started to replay the Watch Dogs series recently.  I've seen a lot of people criticize Watch Dogs 2 for what is essentially ludonarrative dissonance.  People complain about the fun wacky hijinks nature of the game, especially compared to the darker, more grounded tone of the original Watch Dogs, when Marcus murders enough people to be considered a domestic terrorist.  And rarely ever are they particularly bad people.  For example, an early mission has you breaking into a movie studio in order to hack in and extract incriminating emails and steal the script for the upcoming film \"Cyberdriver\".  If you go in guns blazing, realistically a slaughter like that on innocent guards at a movie studio would absolutely label Deadsec as terrorists, and their efforts to get the people on their side would end right then and there.  \n\nExcept my Marcus never killed a soul.  I've played WD2 three times, and all three times I've never once killed anyone.  I make it a point to only use melee attacks and the stun gun, making the most of my drone and RC Jumper in order to infiltrate restricted areas.  So in my playthroughs, Marcus's personality, goals, and actions in gameplay line up perfectly.  And in my opinion, the game plays way better and is much more interesting and fun then if I just ran in and murdered everyone.  \n\nSo, would WD2 have benefited from a narrative perspective from removing lethal weapons from the game and forcing the player to play in a stealthier way?  Even if I choose not to play that way, I can admit they would have lost a ton of sales if they had went that route.  Do people that criticize the difference in their playstyle versus Marcus's personality just not have a valid point, because they're playing the game \"wrong\"?  Is there anyway to fix this problem that's unique to video games at all?  Does it even need to be fixed?  And to expand beyond my Watch Dogs example, should games try to address this?  Do we need Nathan Drake taking a moment to contemplate the lives that he's taken?  Do we have fourth wall breaking jokes in order to ease the sense of strangeness that comes from ludonarrative dissonance?  Or do we do nothing, and say that games are fine with this, and it's just something we have to learn to live with? ",

        "text": "This is gonna be a long read, but I really want to share one of my most memorable moments in gaming while playing Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis. For those who don't know, this was the predecessor of the ARMA series, a military simulator with extremely unforgiving combat. In the game, there is this especially grueling mission where you have to destroy  enemies' nuclear launcher. The target is heavily guarded with troops and tanks. You are only given a small squad, and the option to call in attack helicopters and ground supports at any given time. The game suggests you two approaches: do it stealthily, or attack head on. But at the time I couldn't succeed at either of them. The mission takes place in broad daylight, so infiltration is nigh impossible. Enemy forces also completely outnumber you, so chances of destroying the target and escaping alive is very slim. \n\nI spent several days and countless attempts failing over and over again. Then I sat down and started brainstorming. Now there is this neat thing in this game, is that that it does not restrict where players can travel. Each mission takes place in a huge, open world map. Before you start, the game generates enemies, allies and objectives. You can abandon mission site and go to the other side of the island if you please.  Another thing about this game, is that you can fully interact with any vehicle and weapon, whether it belongs to enemies or allies or even civilians, with a few story related exceptions. During the mission, I had my eyes on the helicopters that you can call as air support. They are by far the most powerful assets in this operation, yet their usefulness is completely undermined by the stupid AI. They fly in, miss most of their missiles, then gets shot down by anti air. If they wanted, they could totally have destroyed the target from long range and left unscathed. \n\nAnd that's where an idea sparked in my head: what if instead of relying on the AI, I conduct the airstrike myself? If I can find the helicopters, I can pilot them! The map is a pretty huge island though, so I can't just blindly search any area. I knew the direction the helicopters came from, so I narrowed down which part of the island to start with. I knew that air bases in this game were usually located in fairly large, open areas, so I pinpointed all those places. Then I hopped on my truck and started the search. And not long after, I found those helicopters! I \"stole\" one of the pilot seats, then coordinated an attack along with the remaining forces. I completed the mission after three tries using this strategy. I've never felt more accomplished. This was one of the rare moments where I had to think  outside the box to find a really unorthodox answer. It was enabled by the game mechanics, which allowed me to completely bypass scripted events.\n\nDo you have any similar stories where you ignored the script to do things completely differently? ",
