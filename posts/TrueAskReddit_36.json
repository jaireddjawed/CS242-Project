Feminism, MRA'S, men's liberation, gender differences in biology, criminology, privileges etc.\n\nWhat I've noticed however is even with the most seemily rational of people, it seems that it can be difficult to make a criticism without someone dismissing it as 'Men and women are obviously different' or trying to equalize the gender's in some sort of zero some game 'Both men and women are capable of doing...x..y..z' 'Both sexes have it equally tough'. \n\nI wonder though, why is gender for some people a difficult topic to debate? Why are things like the statistics of violent crime among men compared to women  hard to swallow without trying to 'sugarcoat' them. Why can't people just admit that one gender may have more 'empathetic' or 'violent' people compared to the other?\n\nIt's interesting how a lot of people say that kids today are too coddled and live in a sissified society where we can't tell young people the tough truth about life...Yet that only seem to apply when it doesn't undermine people's belief system. When that happens attempt at rational conversations goes out the window.\n\nWhat do you think is the reason for this?",

My initial assumption would be that the initial cluster of celebrity deaths earlier in the year was a catalyst for the inception of this idea/meme, and ever since, it's easy to attribute every following death to the narrative, like a steadily growing pile of confirmation bias.\n\nOr, are we at some sort of threshold of global celebrity culture and mass media where it'll soon be the norm to have high-profile people dying somewhat frequently? Simply due to the ever growing number of celebrities, our growing capacity to retain these personalities in global culture, as well as the globalization and narrowing of that culture?\n",

There's a very sharp drop in the number of fascist philosophers after World War II.\n\nIs it because Communism had it's roots in political philosophers? Did Nazism and the revelations of the holocaust seriously damage fascism's credibility in academia? \n\nAlso, as a general note, please don't try to turn this into a discussion about whether or not either ideology is correct, and claim that one side is better informed than the other.

I feel as though I am currently unequipped to take full advantage of a setting in which the people around me are excited to discuss, debate, and challenge each other's thinking. I'm ashamed to admit that overall I'm not very informed. I come from a family very uninterested in politics, and so I am only just beginning to form my own political opinions. I try to read newspapers and turn on the news whenever possible, but I feel so behind because I don’t have a strong enough base knowledge of the content. It seems as though I don't even know what I don't know, so I can't find a good place to start to start educating myself. Is the Electoral College good? What does ISIS want? What is Donald Trump's policy on any number of issues and how does it compare to that of other politicians? There are plenty of answers I can find with a quick Google search, but I only ever seem to have a very shallow understanding of these things. \n     I know this may seem like a dumb question, and I apologize if it is. My goal is to head off to college next year well-versed in a variety of topics that matter and are relevant, and above all I just want to be informed. Until then, I turn to you all for any advice your willing to toss my way. Where is a good place to start to be better-informed? What are some of your favorite news sources? What are some things (current events, politics, social issues, etc.) that everyone should be able to discuss?\n",

        "text": "If someone wanted to build a platform for financial civil disobedience, could the following setup work out, what are the errors and how could it be designed in practice? The basic idea is to create a universal basic income by „robbing“ banks through faulty loans (e.g. like [Enric Duran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enric_Duran)). The trick would be that each person taking faulty loans would send the money via a laundery system (e.g. Monero) to the plattform (let‘s call it #takethemoneyandlive). #takethemoneyandlive would be a nonprofit association which provides legal council, banking services and a monthly basic income of 2000€ for everybody who takes part in the „robbery“. The money you send to the platform wouldn‘t be the money that you yourself took up as a loan, but would be more like your ticket for a livelong basic income and the services provided by #takethemoneyandlive. These services would especially help you through the period of your insolvency status. #takethemoneyandlive would also provide some kind of asset that could be transfered easily from person to person to appear credit worthy for the moment in front of the banks. Let's assume the money for such an asset is readily available to begin with to start the movement.\n\nSome known issues and questions: \n\n* what would be the easy to transfer asset and how could it be secured so nobody would #taketheassetandrun?\n\n* if you send the money via an anonymous laundry system to #takethemoneyandlive, how can you receive the basic income if you prefer to stay anonymous? (maybe an automatically created second monero adress for the monthly payout?)",

        "text": "J.S. Mill, in his masterful essay [On Liberty](http://socserv2.socsci.mcmaster.ca/econ/ugcm/3ll3/mill/liberty.pdf), sets the stage for one of the most enduring questions in modern political philosophy: what is liberty and what is the state's role in protecting it?\n\nWhereas enlightenment thinkers believed that organized, authoritative bodies (e.g. the state and the church) represent the greatest threats to liberty, Mill recognized a potent threat from the prevailing opinion of unorganized masses:\n\n&gt;when society is itself the tyrant [...] its means of tyrannizing are not restricted to the acts which it may do by the hands of its political functionaries. Society can and does execute its own mandates: and if it issues wrong mandates instead of right, or any mandates at all in things which it ought not to meddle, it practices a social tyranny more formidable than many kinds of political oppression, since, though not usually held by such extreme penalties, it leaves fewer means of escape, penetrating much more deeply into the details of life, and enslaving the soul itself. **Protection, therefore, against the tyranny of the magistrate is not enough; there needs protection also against the tyranny of the prevailing opinion and feeling;** against the tendency of society to impose, by other means than civil penalties, its own ideas and practices as rules of conduct on those who dissent from them.\n\n&gt; - J.S. Mill, *On Liberty* Ch 1 (emphasis mine)\n\nEnlightenment thinkers proposed that to protect against systemic tyranny, we should design governing systems with internal controls that limit their ability to tyrannize. Hence western political systems emphasize representative government, constitutional limitations on government, separation of church and state, etc. But how do we combat the organic tyranny of majoritarian opinion without tyrannizing the majority?\n\n**Case #1** \n\nIn 2014 [Masterpiece Cakeshop](http://aclu-co.org/court-rules-bakery-illegally-discriminated-against-gay-couple/) owner Jack Phillips refused to bake a wedding cake for engaged gay couple David Mullins and Charlie Craig claiming his religious convictions as the reason for his discrimination. The couple filed a complaint with the Colorado Civil Rights Division contending that Phillips had violated state anti-discrimination laws. A CCRD ruling in the couple's favor led to an appeal by Phillips to the Colorado Office of Administrative Courts. The court upheld the prior ruling and ordered Phillips to pay associated fines, take re-education classes on discrimination, file quarterly compliance reports with the CCRD for two years, and make wedding cakes for any prospective gay clients. Further appeals were denied, and Phillips chose to close his bakery instead of violate his beliefs.\n\nIf we treat the religious community's refusal to participate in gay weddings as a Millsian social tyranny on the gay minority then the state's intrusion can be justified as a promotion of social liberty. On the other hand, many would argue that Colorado's laws tyrannize devoutly religious business owners by forcing them to choose between betraying their religious convictions and going out of business. Is liberty served by these types of anti-discrimination laws? Is there another way to ensure that minority communities are protected from this type of social tyranny?\n\n**Case #2**\n\nIn May 2016 [liberal activists interrupted](https://youtu.be/Pw-MnRyIoQY?t=46m33s) a DePaul University College Republicans event hosting conservative columnist Milo Yiannopoulos. To shut down political speech the activists blew whistles, took over the stage, stole the microphones from Yiannopoulos and the interviewer, and threatened physical violence against Yiannopoulos. The event was eventually canceled after school administrators told campus security and the Chicago PD, who were both present, not to interrupt the protest. \n\nMill would argue that the liberal activists' attempt to shut down political speech represents an affront to liberty and a social tyranny. How can we ensure that freedom of expression is preserved in our society amid a significant, organic movement to silence certain viewpoints? Is there a way the state can protect freedom of expression from organic threats without becoming tyrannical towards protest movements?",
