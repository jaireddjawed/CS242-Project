I've been doing this for about four years and continue to gain skills that I can use on a resume. While working I am also going to school to get a degree in Information Security / Cybersecurity because I want to work my way into an Analyst position and ultimately work on Malware Analysis or Pentesting. I have around two years until I'm done with my degree, and will ultimately be taking mostly programming/database courses towards the end.\n\nMy question: If I am picking up relevant SysAdmin skills while working \"General IT\", would it be wise to also put in relevant coursework on my resume? To expand on that, I particularly mean: If I were applying for an Analyst position, would it be wise to have a small section on my resume to explain the divide between what I have professional and educational experience in? I know this kind of question can really depend, but hope that makes sense.\n\nThank you all!\n\nEdit: This may not be the appropriate subreddit to ask. If you have a recommendation, it would be much appreciated.",

It consists of a base64 encoded JWT, which has been signed. The typical JWT attacks don't seem to work (e.g. alg=none).\n\n\nWhat bugs me is the fact that you cannot set a Secure or HttpOnly attribute for an Auth header, which to me screams insecure. On the other hand, for example, a CSRF attack may be harder to perform...\n\n\nMy question is - can this be considered good or bad practice?\n\n\nThanks.",

        "text": "Hey Guys,\n\nI am currently a pentester that leads a small team at a financial services company. I just got my GPEN on Monday and I am wondering if GCIH is worth it at this point for the price of the exam? I do have an interest in threat hunting and actually want to eventually get GCFA or GNFA. But to get those I think GCFE/FOR500 is kind of a pre-req.\n\nAs far as GPEN goes, work paid for it. I did the OnDemand classes and honestly did not feel like I was going to pass the exam. I felt completely unprepared since I had no time to study in the month leading up to the exam. Just got so busy with work and life that I really neglected it. I didnt even get a chance to read the last two books before the exam. I did not have an index for anything other than the SANS provided one which was for the most part useless. In the weekend leading up to the exam, I did take the time to do TABS of the last two books which really saved my ass I feel. I ended up passing with an 81. \n\nI already have all the books for GCIH, and since I already know the majority of the \"hacking\" tools and techniques, all I would really need to learn is the incident handling aspects. All I would need to spring for is the cost of the exam which I know I could get work to pay for.\n\nThat being said, does doing GCIH add value to me considering I already have GPEN?\n\nOr should I wait a bit and try to finagle work into paying for GCFE or GCIA? As they arent Pentest related it may be hard to get them to pay for it.\n\nAnd I know someone will mention OSCP, I took PWK a few years ago but never got around to doing the exam. Right now I dont have the time to do the labs and the exam. It is definitely on my list of future endeavors however.\n\nThanks fellas!",

Everything I've read has either been extremely general or extremely specific (for example I got a CHFI book and it appears to just be very basic criminal justice concepts and the first network security class I took 10 years ago, for something that's supposed be at least a second-level cert), but I just can't see the path between these concepts and applying them to an actual job.\n\nI want to find a specific aspect to dig into and be passionate about, but I'm not clear on what each person actually does (and doesn't do). Obviously the makeup of a team is different depending on the business. I'm most interested in organizations that aren't primarily IT, but are large enough to have security teams to protect their data, but anyone that can tell me what people in security roles actually do beyond a list of resume bullet points will be helpful here",

However, it seems to me that this doesn't give any real advantage over symmetric encryption (where the encryption key is stored directly on the machine), since if the machine is compromised, the files being backed up are compromised as well anyway.\n\nThoughts?",

        "text": "Greetings, to anyone willing to read or anyone looking to give some friendly \\(or blunt\\) advice. \n\nI am a recently graduated student with my Bachelor's in Computer Science, with a focus in Cyber Security. I have gathered a great interest in Cyber Security during my time as an undergraduate and was, for the most part, considered a star student in the discipline. I really like learning about hands\\-on penetration testing, firewall configurations, python scripting, and the like. However, things were very different when I first entered college. \n\nWhat I wanted to do originally: Originally, I wanted to go through my college education becoming an efficient programmer and ultimately land a Software Engineering position. However, throughout my years of taking theoretical computer science courses, I found myself with a profound interest in academia and research \\(algorithmic analysis, analytic geometry, cyber security research\\). \n\nWhat I did close to graduation: Close to graduation, I applied to a plethora of jobs and graduate schools \\(both for Master's and Ph.D.\\) and at the time of graduation, I had not secured an entry\\-level security job \\(though I do have some industry experience\\). My case is not necessarily the norm, there were reasons why I had little time to secure a job for immediately after graduation, but that is beyond the scope of this post. \n\nA couple of months later, I am working random jobs from McDonald's to a factory where I do manual labor \\(I actually do not mind this kind of work, but definitely not an end goal\\). From there, I was contacted by a company \\(which I will call Company X\\) seeking to hire me. They contacted me BEFORE I heard back from most graduate schools. \n\nCompany X: Company X wanted to hire me, and we discussed it and went through the interview process, and on top of this, I was also accepted into Johns Hopkins online Master's in Cyber Security! Wonderful! Great job and getting to work for my Master's! Now for the tricky part. About a week ago, I was accepted into Virginia Tech's Ph.D. program in Computer Science, and around this time, I started noticing red flags from Company X. So when I was ready to completely uproot my life and move across the country for Company X, they then inform me that I have two more interviews with them. During the first the said interviews, since I had already assumed I had the job which I was told differently a few days prior, I didn't act as if I already had the job. I acted in such a manner with my recruiter and they seemed assured. So during the actual interview, I did not act with the same reassurance of job security, and after that said interview, was then denied the job. I literally have to go around telling all my friends and family that I'm not leaving after all. \n\nWhat my dilemma is now: Here is my dilemma and the main point of this post \\-\\- I have a great opportunity at VT to pursue my Doctorate in Computer Science \\(with cyber security specific research of course!\\) and I am not 100&amp;#37; sure if, given this industry, it is necessarily the best move to get my Ph.D. right now. I like hands\\-on security, and want to do more hands\\-on work, and I'm worried that work I will be doing as a Ph.D. student will hinder me from visiting Exploits Database for my occasional learning! I don't want to feel like I want to go with VT just because it's my only option on the table. I graduated this past December and haven't done anything with my degree yet. I feel like at this point, I'm confused and am unsure of myself and what I want to do. \n\nAny feedback will be helpful. \n\nThank you very much for your time, to anyone who reads and comments. \n\nEDIT: I have 2 years experience.",

The hunt, the enumeration, the intelligence gathering, and the (hopefully) inevitable conquest. But it seems like my current job isn't what I'm looking for.\n\nIt doesn't seem like there's enough time to get quality testing done (test 1 web app for 20 hours, but web app is huge, or 10 hours to pentest a `/23` or `/22`), and like there isn't much of a chance to explore anything.  \n\nIt seems many people are primarily running scanners with a little bit of manual testing here and there. There's no red teaming, social engineering, or phishing, and it's mostly application tests. \n\nI've seen us putting complete newbies on projects for important clients and having them do it by themselves... people who don't really have the chops to give the client what they're looking for, and trying to get away with finding \"low\" vulnerabilities, when they can't even take apart a JWT. Like, they're clueless about the encoding, and just run burp on the JWT value to hope they get something...\n\nMentoring is almost non-existent because it hurts profits to train inexperienced people, and some feel it's best to just throw them right into the fray.\n\nMany of the network penetration tests consist of people throwing random metasploit auxiliary/exploit modules at a target and hoping something sticks, without realizing why those scripts won't work. \n\nMost of our \"senior\" pentesters with many years of network pentesting experience are unable to pass OSCP after multiple attempts. I think I've seen up to 7 failed attempts.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I think pretty much everyone I work with is an excellent person and I like being around them, but I can't help but wonder if there's room for more. Are my standards too high? Is this common? Is there anything out there that is different?\n",

Some are Wordpress instances, some are custom built sites, some are other pre-packaged software.  I have security plugins running on Wordpress instances which have been running for years defending against this attack.  The attack I have is a distributed brute force attack trying to guess the Wordpress admin password.\n\nHow do I know?  Every 5 minutes the plugin locks the admin account for failed attempts, and sends me an email with the offending web request details.  At first these were all coming from IPs in China.  I had the hosting provider drop all packets from China at the gateway, that lasted all of about 10 minutes before the attacks started coming from random IPs inside the U.S.\n\nI tried reaching out to the hosting provider but their response was a very generic \"Do not worry Mr. XXXX, we show no malicious activity on your server.  The emails you received were probably false\".  (I.e. they covered their butts and wont look into the issue)\n\nMy big question here is, what are my Legal options? Who can I get involved to track down the source of this and when I do ~~maim them~~ force them to stop, or prosecute them?\n\nThis has been ongoing for over 4 years now.  I've set the passwords to something very difficult to brute force, but I just want the attacks to stop.\n\nTL;DR - What actions can a business/individual take when they are being hacked (via distributed attack), to prosecute the attacker, and defend themselves?\n\nedit1: Grammar fixes, detail clarification",

This is guaranteed, in writing. \n\nThe other is another state level public sector job, the starting pay is considerably higher, about 85,000. The work is general cyber security engineering but I have held the stance that I would want penetration testing to be an official capacity of my job (since it cannot be all of the time at this particular org)\n\nThe benefits are very similar, so I consider that to be wash.\nBoth teams are great, I have worked with both teams in the past and I can say that they are both great. I do feel like the Government job has a higher skill ceiling and the colleagues offer more with respect to my learning.\n\nAdditionally, I feel that if I ever left the Government job I would have more exit opportunities with the clearance and the penetration testing experience, but I don't know. \n\nOne of the unknowns for me is that if I dislike doing the Cyber Engineering work, how difficult would it be for me to transition into penetration testing or another similar technical field? Typically, I would expect that I would have to start at a more Junior level, even if penetration testing is an official responsibility at the state job. \n\nSo, I guess some of my concerns are: Does one opportunity lend itself to better opportunities down the road? Engineering is ubiquitous and I'm sure the private sector is in no shortage of these jobs -- but is it fulfilling and interesting day in and day out? \n\nWould I be taking more money now, doing engineering, to earn less in the future? \n\nAny wisdom is appreciated and I can clarify or expand on any part of this.\n\nThanks!\n\n",

But I just want to make sure I understand correctly. \n",

One of them is ECC, the other is RSA. In total, I have 4 subkeys.\n\nI want to export the secret keys in such a way that they do not remain on any non-volatile medium where the data may persist. My idea is to export them on a RAM Disk so that if I reboot (cold), there is a very low chance of an attacker getting my private subkeys. Is this just a waste of time, or should I do that?",
