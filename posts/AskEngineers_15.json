I would like to have a career at NASA, Spacex, JPL (I don’t know if this is the same as NASA?). Anyways I want to focus on the structure, engines, orbit?, aerodynamics of spacecraft, satellites, and any other vehicles (rovers is also another option if that’s possible through these degrees) which will end up in space. Would aerospace or mechanical be better? Also, I live in NYC, if I do want to work at NASA or any other space agency and work on spacecraft, will I be able to considering my location? Any answers would be appreciated. Thank you!",

        "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am currently an engineer 2 years out of school, Mechanical Engineering to be exact. I went through school with a good balance of life and school work - with extra curricular activities as well as school. However, as I'm sure we all know, life is much different outside of school.\n\nCurrently been in a new role for about 4 months (same company for 1.5 years):\n\nI've always been someone who enjoys working to a point, I enjoy using my brain to solve complex problems - and possible decipher the solution to the people who had the problem in the first place. Using tools to automate and make processes more efficient, etc...\n\nHowever, I find that my job right now is slow - and tedious - and activates some solid self-doubt. Not because it is challenging, I enjoy a challenge, **but** because I feel like the work I do is trivial and I only use what I'm good at 33% of the time. ***I don't want to lose what made me strong, my abilities as an engineer and cognitive ability to sole problems***. But because of my current role that's how I am feeling. \n\nSome people say *be patient*, *the time will come* when you start getting work along with experience. But, how am I supposed to get engineering experience and build up my technical skills if I am waiting for this to come? How am I supposed to find the position I might enjoy if it takes \"time and experience\" to build the skillset to finally be challenged?\n\nI'm not someone who dreamed of becoming an engineer since I was 4 years old. Through school, I had no advisor to help me find my passions or guide me. I know the things I enjoy but never thought of becoming an engineer when I was a child. I know what might be interesting, but how am I supposed to find the position that I will enjoy (I mean, 40 hours a week is a lot, I don't want to settle) if I have to *wait until I build experience?* \n\nI enjoy it now, but I enjoy the problem solving and challenge aspect, which I don't currently get. Any thoughts on being patient vs taking a career leap? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR** \\- Being patient is a common response to Engineers in a position where the work seems trivial, not challenging, and not fast paced. As someone who loves chaos, and is able to grow/learn/succeed to their best being in uncomfortable positions - is being patient really an option? Or is the better route finding another position. I just don't want \"the grass is greener\" syndrome.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

I'm a civil engineer by trade.\n\nI've used Inventor mostly for smaller light fixtures and Autocad for metal stationary structures.\n\nI see an opportunity for a large metal structure (about 25-45 meters in length) that had a major moving component. I've taken steps to start this company but I'm a long way from realizing it. \n\nThe metal frame has already been designed in 2d autocad to satisfy the needed standards, but I'm still working on the mechanical aspect.\n\nThe thing is I'm not sure which software is best for this. I've heard Inventor does not work well with huge assemblies like this? Is this true? I've heard good things about Catia, but I see it mostly discussed for automotive. \n\nAnyone have some insight?",

Lots of the time I'll even look to actual engineers for guidance because there is no better source of knowledge than the person who has the knowledge. \n\nNaturally it's basically trial by fire the entire way and I'll have to burn through 25 uni papers just to be sure on a design of something and I'll end up redoing something 30 times but overall it's enjoyable. \n\n\nAre there people out there who have somehow spent a lifetime becoming a self taught engineer? . I don't think a normal person could redesign an engine but it also doesn't do me any favours if I have zero credentials to my name",

The piping from the pump is 2 inch diameter. It goes vertical  from the pipe, through a union, 2x 90-degree turns, then vertically  through a check valve and a gate valve. The vertical rise from the floor  to the top pipe is \\~87\". **As I understand that gives me \\~9.75 of static head.**  At the top of the vertical rise, near the ceiling, the pipe makes a 90  degree turn, then another 90 degree to a 45 degree down facing fitting.  Then there's 3 more horizontal 45's (avoiding other pipes) before it  goes into the branch of a tee, and goes down \\~ 2ft toward a 2\" to 3\"  45-degree fitting where it connects to the 3-inch main sewer line. The  total piping for this section is around 17-feet.\n\nFor everyone's sake for their spreadsheets, that's 4x 90s, 5x 45s, a gate valve, a union, a check valve, and a branched tee - all with 2-inch pipe.\n\nThe  3-inch main does 2x more 90 degree turns and in through branch of a 45 degree tee (one side of the straight flow-through exposed to basement and closed, for cleaning) before hitting the septic tank. The total distance for this section is around 65 feet.\n\nI understand I need to add the friction loss, but I can't figure out what to do about the pipe diameter size changing. Can anyone help me out? Do I calculate the pipe lengths separately and just add the equivalent  pipe lengths together?\n\nThe  pump has a flow rate of 76 gpm at 5', 50 gpm at 10', 20 gpm at 15' of  TDH. I think my TDH is around 10, seeing as the friction loss doesn't  seem to account for much, but I don't know what I'm doing, so please help!",

        "text": "Hey  everyone, I am currently in my final semester of EE and really  struggling with my senior design. Honestly, the project just feels super  ambitious but not that I have been giving it my all in completing it. I  just want some help on where to go from here right now, the following  is a prompt I fixed up using GPT, it summarises everything very  cohesively and I would appreciate any input from people who have worked  on similar projects!\n\n\"Project Title: OpenDSS Based Power Distribution Studies\n\nIntroduction:  With the increasing adoption of low-carbon technologies and distributed  energy resources, the dynamic of power distribution systems is changing  and posing new planning and operational challenges. To address these  challenges, new tools are needed to understand real-time system behavior  and improve planning techniques.\n\nProject  Summary: The prototype developed in this project consists of two parts:  creating a DSS script to represent a circuit and editing the interface  using a Python application. The OpenDSS block runs load flow analysis  and takes input in the form of a DSS file, which describes the necessary  system parameters for power flow analysis. The DSS file is typically  written in Delphi, but the Python shell allows the user to interface  with the DSS engine and run changes on the system being studied,  eliminating the need to work directly with the Delphi code.\n\nGoal:  Initially, the goal was to conduct a comprehensive literature review on  reinforcement learning, active network management, and power flow  analysis. However, after feedback, the focus shifted to gaining  expertise with the simulation software and prioritizing the  understanding of power flow through labs and books. So far, the team has  gained proficiency in the OpenDSS software and successfully run,  understood, and validated a test feeder using the PyDSS library. The  next steps involve using PyDSS to make intelligent changes to OpenDSS  text files and analyzing a system larger than a 30-bus system. The  ultimate goal is to have reportable time-varying results.\n\nChallenges:  The team, consisting of three members, is facing difficulties  prioritizing tasks and delegating work effectively. With 12 weeks left  to complete the project, the team has a lot to do, including moving from  a 4-bus to a 30-bus system, mastering and exploring PyDSS, reviewing  the thesis of previous seniors who worked on the software, and finding a  relevant paper to replicate its results.\n\nRequest:  We are seeking advice on how to prioritize and effectively complete  these tasks within the remaining 12 weeks. If anyone has worked with  OpenDSS and PyDSS, any insights and suggestions would be greatly  appreciated.\"",

        "text": " I currently work in Strategic Ops for an Australian startup. I mostly focus on supporting SLT and executing projects to improve business process across the company. I am interested in deepening my career further into business process, operations and delivery.\n\nI am looking at jobs and almost half of them request/require some sort of Lean Six Sigma qualification, which I don't have.\n\nI have a few questions:\n\n1. All jobs that mention LSS require atleast Green Belt. Do I need to pass yellow belt first?\n2. Jobs seem to just require the certification. I am not sure what I should be paying for when looking online. \n3. Are all providers weighted equally? I can see that universities offer LSS for thousands of $$$ whereas other providers are less than $1000. I am confused by the different websites and what they offer and where I could go for industry standard\n\nThanks!",

He shared some photos with me in which he has two dowel pins at each end of his base plate and has attached a taught guitar sting to the posts. He has then fixed his linear rail to the base plate, attached a raspberry Pi with camera (the camera lens has some for of cross hairs) above the guitar string to the bearing block and run it length of the rail to check that it is parallel to the guitar sting/perpendicular to the ends of the base plate.   \nI though this was pretty clever given he is doing this in his house.  \n\n\nBut I cannot think of good ways of doing this myself. How would you go about doing this either in a dream set up for creating precise machinery or a hacked together solution with acceptable results?",
