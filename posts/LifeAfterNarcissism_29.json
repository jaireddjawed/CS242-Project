One of the most unsettling things for me after going NC at the age of 38 was realizing how many things I had always believed to be \"true\" about my life weren't true after all.\n\nFor example:\n\n1. That we were poor. We didn't bathe often, wore hand-me-down clothes that were outdated, ripped, etc., we never went to the doctor or dentist, I just generally knew that we didn't have some of the basic things other kids my age had.\n\nRecently I was looking through some old photos and it occurred to me that my parents had some very expensive hobbies such as collecting fine art and antiques, making handicrafts that required expensive equipment and tools, etc. It's clear there was enough money for them to pursue these leisurely activities but not to provide some of our basic needs.\n\n2. That we lived \"in the middle of nowhere.\" They always used this as an excuse for why we didn't get medical attention even when something serious happened (should have had stitches, etc)., why we couldn't go to friend's houses or socialize much outside the family, why we couldn't participate in sports or opportunities other people had.\n\nWe did live in a rural area, but it was less than 10 miles away from a town where there were doctors, dentists, etc. We frequently went to a town 50 miles away (100 miles round trip) so they could purchase things for the hobbies mentioned above. \n\nThere are more things I can't think of right now and every few months I discover a few more. I'm just curious if anyone else has experienced this.",

        "text": "Using a throwaway for this one. So this is mostly an incoherent vent about random anecdotes. My mom died three years ago. It was most likely suicide. There was no farewell letter, but the general concensus among several experienced and competent police officers was that nobody falls like that by accident, and I believe them. She did definitely have issues, with both alcohol and general loneliness, as well as having a difficult mother herself.  \n\nThe stuff she did was nowhere near some of the crazy shit you read here and over at RBN. Superficially speaking, she did take good care of me and my brother. She was a single mom for most of the time. Highly educated, eloquent, in a sorta political position with lots of responsibility. We were always clothed and fed. Conveniently the mortgage to our house was payed up before she died and she had taken care of a life insurance, which makes me carefree about monetary issues.  \n\nAnd then there was this other side about her. The one that makes me kind of glad she's gone. The one that made it impossible to open up to her about anything without feeling terrible afterwards. In many ways my real life started when I moved out and really took off when she died.    \n\nLet's start with the first instance that made me suspect she didn't prioritize her kids the way other parents did. It may sound materialistic, but I think it illustrates the issue in a very quantifiable way: In my childhood neighbourhood there were a dozen identical row houses, all inhabited by families with exactly two kids. In every other house, the kids' rooms were the two rooms on the top floor. My brother and me on the other hand were placed in two other rooms on the first floor, which were considerably smaller, while the two larger rooms were inhabited by my parents (in addition to their bedroom). My parents' relationship ended somewhere around that time, so my dad rarely spent time outside of his room. When I confronted her about it years later, she used excuses like „Technically, this wasn't my room, it was our guest room“ (well, our guests used the fold-out couch in there a lot, but it was full of her stuff) or „You should be glad, in summer it gets way too hot in there!“ (It didn't)\n\nWhen I went to elementary, she used a loophole to get me into a school next to her workplace instead of the one designated for our district. So I was the only kid in my neigbourhood that didn't go to school with the other kinds in our street, and the only kid in our class that didn't live near the other kids. Today I feel like this was one of the first things to turn me into an outcast. She'd always insist on driving me to school, as a result I was always late because finishing her makeup was more important. Now I'm always über-puncual to anything and slowly working towards loosening up on the less important appointments. Of course she was the one complaining to me about me having few friends.\n\nWhen I was 10 years old, we were in a zoo in Italy and a parrot landed on my head out of nowhere, which they rarely did in that park. I loved it. But whenever my mom used to retell the story in front of others, she would change and twist it in a way to make herself the center of it. Either it landed on her backpack first and she placed it on my head, or she had put some birdseed into my hair first. Everytime I tried to correct her, she'd always say things like „Sure it did, sweetheart.“ or „If you say it happened that way, it happened that way.“. In her later retellings of that story it was still her own version, but I just didn't feel like correcting her anymore. Nobody would believe me anyway. This parrot incident could've been one of my most precious childhood memories, before she took it away from me.  \nShe generally talked a lot about herself, stories about how she came out on top of things, about men desiring her, about her solving complicated issues and baffling everyone around her. I rarely questioned her, ate it up, I put her on a pedestal. It was probably all lies and exaggerations.    \n\nShe often coerced me into giving her compliments, particularly about her looks. Mostly while demeaning other women, particularly housewives (she despised those). When we ran into a female colleague of hers, it was „I can't believe she's five years younger than me, it doesn't look that way, does it?“, after a parent-teacher conference she said things like „All those mothers are so out of shape and badly dressed, I guess you don't need to be embarrassed about me in that respect.“.  Usually this was fine to me, as it made her happy. But occasionally she made me very uncomfortable. I remember one incident. TV: „[Random celebrity gossip story]... and still has a fantastic body“ Her:„You know, there are people who say that about me...“ Me: „Yeah, alright.“ and then she kept pushing me towards „admitting“ that she was hot (She wasn't. She was thin and knew how to dress, but that was basically it. You could clock the booze and cigarettes on her face). I once read about the term „covert incest“ over at RBN and it fits my old situation to a tee. I'm also hyper-aware of any catty feelings I feel towards any woman because I think I know where they come from.  \n\nWhen people asked me questions while she was around, she would often answer them for me. Either in a blatantly wrong way or revealing more than I'd like. Another shtick of hers was when we were at the dinner table with guests discussing something and I contributed, she went \"L. got that info from the internet\" in a very derogatory way. Btw, in any of these incidents I can remember, I had gotten my facts from school, and my country's education doesn't suck.  \n\nWhenever she wanted to state some hurtful opinion about me, she used a sockpuppet. „__ told me he didn't like the way you style your hair“, „__ is surprised you haven't been dating for a while“ „__ is glad your skin finally looks better“. This may sound petty, but it still enrages me. Maybe because I feel like she insulted my intelligence, it were obviously her poorly masked own opinions after all, or just because it was so cowardly.   \n\nShe would often lie about random guys checking me out. Puberty was kind to me, I'm confident now, but back then I definitely wasn't the type of teenager guys check out. Then there's that hygiene issue. As a kid/teenager, there's things you don't know instinctively and your classmates sure as hell won't tell you. How often to shower, how often to change which piece of clothing etc. Eventually I had to google this stuff because she didn't teach me. Until then I must have been a mess.   \n\nHer relationship to her own mother was really strained as well. When we were on car rides, she would often tell about her childhood and really get into it, I was afraid she'd flip the car over in a fit. My grandmother is still alive (and grieving like crazy, my mom was her only child) and I've heard both sides of their conflict, so I won't elaborate on their story or pick a side. All I know is that it was the same my grandmother and her mother. If I decide to have kids one day, I'm sort of terrified of getting a daughter because I'm sure history would just repeat itself.   \n\nThen there was the whole alcohol issue. She wasn't your average alcoholic, but every other weekend she'd spend the whole day or longer passed out in her bed, reeking of coffee, piss and sweat (I can still remember that smell, probably one of the reasons I don't like coffee). And you would always find some half-empty bottle of heavy booze hidden beneath a pillow. The next day she would go to work as if nothing had happened. God forbid you adressed the night before, she'd just change the topic into how terrible I was and how I should clean up after my own issues. One time when I was 13 it was so bad I called an ambulance. By the time the paramedics had arrived, she stood by the door all dressed and eloquent and told them about how unreliable and crazy I was. Luckily they still clocked how drunk she was, but then left anyway. Once the paramedics got out of the door, she backhanded me. I swore to myself to just let her drown in her own puke the next time, which never happened. The next morning she told me all kinds of stuff about how I was „kind of retarded“ (fyi, I graduated high school with honors and have an M.Sc. in mathematics) and should go to hell.  \n\nThrough all that, her reputation was excellent. In public she was always perfectly mannered, well dressed, always to first to volunteer for any bake sale. Her funeral was *packed*. When I tried to open up to someone (teachers, my godparents, my friends etc.) it was always the same old story: No way, your mom is such a lovely, hard-working person, I should stop being so ungrateful... I guess many of you know the drill.  \n\nWhen she was still alive, I often made an attempt to call her out on this stuff (at least the things I recognized as abusive back then, that is), which never ended satisfactory in any way whatsoever. When it was about her blowing cigarette smoke into my face, she went \"But I never smoked inside the house, nor while I was pregant!\" (She quit 1,5 years before her death. And she *did* smoke while pregnant, my grandmother and father both told me, and they never agree on anything). She was great at derailing, shifting the blame, making me feel hysterical and inadequate. She was a politician through and through.  \n\nI don't miss her, but in a way I'd love to talk to her again, just to call her out on all that shit. Something I somehow have never been able to when she was alive. You could really see my younger brother blossom after she was gone, and as happy as I am for him, I feel cheated out of these experiences because when I was his age, her influence was still all around me. And at the same time, I still feel like I'm really unfair to her because often she seemed like she really tried. Maybe it's the fleas talking. I'd love to take all these harsh feelings and this bottled-up anger and flush it down somewhere, but I've got no idea how.",

        "text": "I apologize in advance for rambling incoherently, it's currently almost 3AM and per the norm I can't even fall asleep. \n\n\nQuick back story: both of my parents are covert narcissists, everyone loves them but their 3 children - myself being the oldest and only male. I finally got out of their awful house when I was 21 after pitting the two of them against each other to get my father to give me my own savings account that he locked me out of the day before I turned 18 to prevent me from leaving. I left in a very calculated way - having enough to support myself for a year, thinking at the time I would just have 1.5 years of school left... I switched schools at the time in hopes of finishing my bachelors in computer engineering.... of course the switching of schools went nothing like I envisioned it.... but more on that later.\n\n\nMy middle sister (now 20) has traits of being an N, and was always the GC... until she suddenly realized how awful our parents were and decided to run away the very next day with little to no planning. This was 2 years ago, just 6 months after I had left. This created even more tension in the already broken family as... my youngest sister (now 15) was left to be the only one with my awful parents. My youngest sister is also the only reason that I have not gone NC and I plan to never speak to my parents again the day she gets out of that house.\n\n\n**Ok....** now for where I'm at...\n\nIt's been just over 2 years since I left... I still have 9 classes to finish my degree and I'm in my 6th year .. I've failed 4 classes so far, have a 2.6 GPA, ended up dropping the current semester entirely after my middle sister showed up in the middle of the semester and basically invited herself to live in my room for a week causing me to basically go insane.... I'm still a virgin (this torments me pretty much day in and day out), have no friends, absolutely hate my roommates, can't sleep most nights (I sleep about 5 nights a week...), struggle to even hold down food most days... have absolutely no motivation to do anything for school (already had 2 C-s that I was 'working on' before my sister showed up... and was very behind in the other 2 classes but the grades weren't yet published), am perpetually struggling to pay off credit cards that I've had to put my tuition costs on (that just keep increasing cause I keep failing classes and having to retake them)\n\nOk... so when I said I had *no* friends that was a lie... I could argue I have like 30% of a friend. I have one girl that I met a few years ago that I text every day and she considers me her best friend, I suppose by definition of 'best' she's also my best friend. But, she has a boyfriend that she's had since very shortly after I met her, she lives on the other side of the country (moved 3 months after I met her), never talks to me outside of texting (even though I've expressed I really wish we talked on the phone occasionally many times and have called her a few times but I don't wish to constantly be the one to call her, every time she says she'll try to call me sometimes but the last time she said that was over a month ago and she has still never been the one to call me after years of me saying I feel like we only have a fraction of a friendship because it only exists in texts)...but still, she's the only one who even gives me any time of day and most of the time I feel like a huge burden on her....\n\nMy roommates consist of.... *a bumbling moron alcoholic* (I kid you not he is the single dumbest person I've ever met, he drinks an 18 pack of beer every day while just sitting in his room playing xbox or watching netflix and living off his parents money. He dropped out of school a year ago and is more than content working a minimum wage job for the rest of his life... an example of his lack of intelligence... earlier today, I was loading the dishwasher and he tried to help and he put 2 cups stacked on top of each other in, I fixed it and told him it wouldn't wash the inner cup and he responded \"Yes it will, it's a dish washer, it washes dishes\" things like this happen near daily with him),.... *a narcissistic PHD student* who uses mr alcoholic as his SG for his own complete lack of cleanliness and basically will blame anything that goes wrong on anyone else no matter how trivial... my favorite example of this was when we ran out of tin foil and he was the last to use it. I went to use some and he left the empty box in the drawer, I had seen him use it not 2 minutes prior so I asked if he used the last of it and he responded \"no you guys used it yesterday for that pizza\" .... and a quiet kid who just comes home and closes himself off in his room without saying a word to anyone (I don't mind him and wish the other two were more like him, but I also know next to nothing about him besides his name, major, and age). I'm the only one who cleans and I've pretty much just stopped cleaning up after everyone else (I make very sure to clean up my own things and clean whatever I use) and because of this the house is a complete pig sty... even as far as still having the christmas tree sitting in our front yard because narcissistic PHD asshole said \"well you guys didn't do anything so I did half the work\" (LITERALLY LESS THAN 10 FEET FROM THE CURB WHERE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PICKED UP BUT HE DIDNT WANT TO TAKE IT THAT FAR), and a ripped up couch sitting by our front door because nPHD says \"it fits *alcoholic* perfectly, makes him look like a real redneck\"  ............... thankfully, I've secured a cheap 1/1 for next year so I won't have to deal with awful roommates like I have for the past 2.5 years...but I know this'll just push me further into loneliness\n\nSchool feels like it may never end for me... I've been in the \"one year left\" era for almost 2 years now and my GPA just falls more and more every semester... I put effort towards classes and it never seems like enough... even the BS class that everyone at the university has to take... I've taken twice and got a D and a C- in... this is a class that mostly freshmen take and they all get As ... I don't do anything different from them, have talked to the professors with no real advice besides \"talk to your TAs\" and the TAs say \"make sure to stay on topic\" or whatever other cliche advice but can't give me examples of why my submissions aren't on topic or whatever they say might be wrong with my work... I got 60s on the exams which were essays subjectively graded by the TAs, when asking where I went wrong I just get my paper back with a bunch of circles on it and no guidance as to why my answer isn't as good as everyone else's... In my core classes... the last test I got back before I dropped this semester I got THE LOWEST GRADE in the class on... a 14/100... this was in part due to my sister showing up and also in part to my not having put much time into studying before she showed up (but I was planning on doing so in the time she took away from me)... but even in the classes I feel I completely understand... I somehow end up forgetting everything on the exam and getting a 50-70... I wasn't always like this... I graduated high school with a 5.0, 5th in my class of over 500, perfect score on the math SAT, accepted into an Ivy league school (that my parents refused to let me go to or even let me go to any school besides the one they chose that I was stuck at for 2.5 years before finally moving out)\n\nI've gone to multiple therapists/counselors and it seems all of them just reaffirm what I say without giving any advice, telling me that my roommates are awful, that school's just a series of bad luck for me, that I need to give myself more credit idek.... nothing that's helped me at all\n\nThis isn't everything obviously... I could keep going on about how shitty I feel everything is... but... how do I make it stop how do I make things better\n\nI just... don't understand how I'm supposed to take care of normal day to day things or things as important as school when I have so many other things that I also cannot seem to do.... Things that it seems everyone else just is able to do (talk to people, fall asleep, hold down food, wake up at a reasonable hour, make friends) just do not seem to happen for me at all and I'm beyond lost... I don't know where to post this either, I know my problems stem from my awful parents...but that doesn't help me fix them\n",

Feeling like showing how well I'm doing to Nex2 (photos, yo. He's an out of shape, alcoholic, in Europe), and Nex1 (who now has a big beer gut).  (I know... I know, this is highly dysfunctional to take my power back using a cocktail dress. Maybe it's because there have been times with other Narcs that I was so out of shape and unhealthy, that I need to prove that these idiots didn't hurt me?)\n\nWhat I want to wear:  An invisibility cloak. A la Arya Stark.  And some Valerian steel. The girl has no name.\n\n",

I think I have radar for N's, which would be good, but I feel DRAWN to them, which is insane.  \n\nI've taken up a hobby that winds up being mostly college kids, and I'm old enough to be their parent, most of them. I don't really care, bc I've done other things with my life, I'm not ashamed of my age, and I'm not a competitive person.  I get that some kids are always going to be like um what's the old person doing here, but it's worth the discomfort to pursue something I've long been interested in and love.\n\nSo in this current crop of 20-something kids, there's one in particular who I'm sure is a narcissist. He's constantly crowing about his achievements even though he hasn't even graduated from community college yet, giving advice unsolicited, talking shit about other people to underline his own superiority...the problem is, I *like* him! Why! I practically have a crush on this kid, which is inappropriate in the first place, but the worst thing is I'm pretty sure he's not a nice person and I STILL catch myself currying his favor and worrying what he thinks of me.\n\nI just feel like I'm not in control of who I'm drawn to...maybe no one can help it, or there wouldn't be so many songs about it...but it makes me worry that my radar is deeply and completely broken! If I can't control who I'm attracted to and I'm naturally attracted to grandiose, charismatic but narcissistic assholes, then I feel like I can't trust myself to be out in the world making friends. And definitely not dating! \n\nDoes anyone else have this problem or concern? I'm not sure how you recalibrate your attraction radar! Sigh it's just appalling to feel like you know better but you're stuck with your patterns anyway.  Advice appreciated!",

        "text": "This will be a fairly long post, so thank you in advance if you make it all the way through. \n\nThe N in my life was my mother, and she is... well, let's put it this way:  if you know the song [She's Always a Woman to Me](https://play.google.com/music/preview/Togmqoxynobbnylspaoclfz6tqq?lyrics=1&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=search&amp;utm_campaign=lyrics&amp;pcampaignid=kp-songlyrics) by Billie Joel, you have a pretty good idea of what she's like.  And when I was younger, she and my dad would fight constantly over little things; the dishes, a broken oven, directions, being on time for appointments, etc.  She nitpicked a lot, and my dad occasionally fought back, but mostly just took it.  We moved when I was 12, after a short sale where they lost a lot of money.  The arguments became more frequent, more caustic, and higher volume.  And then one day, two weeks after the move, it happened.  \n\nThey were arguing about dishes after dinner, I had gone upstairs.  My mother just kept verbally abusing my dad.   And then he snapped.  He grabbed my mother by the throat, and choke-slammed her to the ground.  The back of her head slammed against the tiles, breaking them.   He then stood over her trying to strangle her.  He might have succeeded if not for my 9 year old younger brother, who was desperately trying to pull him off mommy.  That snapped him back to reality, and it dawned on him what he was doing.  He then got up and ran out the door, got in his car, and drove away.  \n\nI didn't see my dad for 6 months to a year after that.  He was the parent that was the calm one who I felt safe to talk to.  And even though he likely did not intend to abandon me, that is what happened.  He was in a mental hospital and then jail, and then not allowed to see my brother and I for obvious reasons.  I was left alone with the worse parent, the one who would become my emotional abuser, me taking the place of my father as her verbal punching bag.   It was very painful abandonment from my experience. \n\nMy mother also had a specific way she wanted people around her to act, and woe unto the person who did not tow the line.  I was pretty smart as a kid and tested with a high IQ.  This means my mother expected perfection in all things academic, and would scream, cry, berate, shame, and just make my life miserable if that standard was not maintained.  I was incredibly depressed, looking back on that time.  Everything was grey to me.  So when I didn't make friends right away in the new town, I was weird and not trying hard enough. Wheni didn't want to do chores and housework, I was lazy.  And when I didn't do my homework, it was because I was spitting in the face of all the sacrifices she made,  and all my incredible gifts.  \n\nShe also, because of her own abuse growing up, had incredibly high standards for behaving and apologizing.  If we made a mistake or hurt her or didn't did what she wanted, she would refuse to engage with my brother or I until we apologized; profusely.  And we couldn't just say \"I'm sorry,\" we had to spell out exactly what we did wrong.   But she wouldn't tell us what we did.  We needed to figure it out ourselves, so we could learn to recognize what we did and avoid doing that in the future. This led me to always being in trouble,  and never knowing or understanding what for.  And until I figured it out and apologized for it, my mother would not be anything but quiet and passive aggressive to me.  I did not know if at the time,  but this was withholding love.  I wanted love, and rarely got it,  and only when I had done everything right.\n\nSo in total, sudden total abandonment, a household where everything was my fault, I was unworthy of love unless I am perfect, and I must apologize for everything,  because if someone is in a bad mood I caused it. \n\nCut to present day,  when my wife admitted herself into first a mental hospital,  and then a long term residential mental health program for her own abusive past.  I can't talk to her at all right now, and can't see her for another week.  She'll be in there at least a month, if not two or three.  This whole saga had been going on since Jan 31st.  And both of her admittances were sudden, abrupt, impersonal, and invalidating.  \"Thank you for bringing the patient to us sir, we'll take it from here, goodbye.\" **SLAM**\n\nIs it any wonder that I felt abandoned?  That I was in a depressive tailspin for weeks?  That this was all my fault and I missed the signs and didn't help and didn't listen?  That I cried myself to sleep every night?  I knew logically that isn't what happened, but here I was again,  unworthy of love because of mistakes I had made.\n\nThis saga has been the worst time in my life, and that's saying something considering my abusive past.  But I have learned things, I have new supportive people in my life, and i have gained personal knowledge and growth.\n\nThank you all for reading to the end.  This whole situation has been weighing me down for most of this new year.",

Like looking for someone in power to give you direction and help you manage your life? Sometimes I swear it was my mother looking at me, instead it was this lady. \n\nSometimes I think therapy is counterproductive for ACoN. What we really need is to be immersed in normal life and develop normal types of agency. Maybe a good therapist helps you do this, I dunno. I've never had one. \n\nAlso, I can't help thinking this was my fault. A part of me knew I was going somewhere to be abused. I was so messed up at the time, running home wasn't an option. I had to run somewhere else to get that dissociated haze. ",

        "text": "Hi everyone\n\nI've finally been diagnosed with ehlers danlos syndrome in the past year at age 26. It's a genetic connective tissue disorder. All of my joints are unstable and prone to partial dislocations. I have a bunch of other comorbidities like GI issues and headaches due to my cerebrospinal fluid (brain fluid) leaking out in places it should be contained (my dura has tears). I'm so glad to finally have a diagnosis that explains everything. My parents never believed that I was sick, and of course I was treated with violence for my childhood symptoms. \n\nNow I'm married to someone who is similar to my parents, but less (currently no) violence. \n\nMy big issue is I'm unable to support my daily needs financially because I can't physically and mentally (brain fog - even if I tolerate the pain and go to work my cognitive ability is really suffering) perform well enough to work. And of course I can't afford my medical treatments either. \n\nIn different families, a person might lean on their parents in this kind of situation. But for ACONs that's not an option.\n\nI'm concerned disability is only around $800 per month. Which might be enough for cheap food and bills. But the cheap food will make my stomach unhappy (can't tolerate grains, dairy, beans, tomatoes, etc. and cooking ability is limited by joint pain and other symptoms) and I still won't be able to afford medical things that the insurance doesn't cover. I won't be able to see EDS specialists on Medicaid. \n\nThe procedure to repair my dura (membrane which contains the brain fluid and brain and spine) to stop the headaches, which are my worst symptom, involves lying flat for several days so it can heal. I thought I could do this even without a lot of support from my husband. Really all I need is to be brought some food a few times a day. But apparently this is way too much help to need! I got the procedure and it's failing because i can't let the site heal for long enough. So what on earth am I supposed to do? Not be able to get the procedure?\n\nI've heard people with chronic illnesses end up homeless, is that partially due to not having help healing from procedures??\n\nI was nc with my mother but I called her (bad decision) when I was hospitalized. Now she's alternating offering to help and saying it's unreasonable to expect help. \n\nI hate being sick, I hate needing help. I want to get better, earn my own money, and not rely on people who are not kind to me. But I feel stuck. I thought getting diagnosed would be life-changing but instead it's just informed me of how I could be better if I had support and money I don't have. \n\nAny ideas?",

        "text": "Long post, not very detailed, just blowing off some steam I guess \n\nSo I'm at this point where I'm content on a day to day basis, cooking meals, getting uni work done etc. Not much social contact because there are a lot of flying monkeys around, or gossipy people in general, doesn't seem worth it socialising when my name has been dragged through the mud and I'm ok with that for the most part (moving away soon). I have tried 'being social' but often felt something was off, like these people had an agenda I didn't want to be a part of and over a few months decided to minimise contact as much as I felt was right (only saying hi and walking off, not even saying hi - just a nod/smile, deleting off of facebook/instagram, just avoiding completely on and offline), i have my hesitations in the moment but don't turn back a day later, it's peaceful after that because it feels like I've cut a chord that's been weighing me down/tying me to the past- even if just a little. \n\nI thought I was doing alright, no contact was going pretty well until a Friend sent me a link to the N's page (some article), my Friend thought it's funny piece of news and I thought this too. But then it sent me in a spiral of digging deeper, telling myself I'm alright I just wanted to look for 'fun'. And the next 2 weeks I was on an emotional roller coaster of freaking out and breaking down when I'd randomly remember the hurt I had suffered. I've since realised it was because I broke nc, and have told my Friend never to send me things related to the N - whether good/bad/funny, didn't matter, just nothing. \n\nHowever, in that period I've also come to the realisation that all this time I've thought that I fully recovered wasn't exactly true. By far, I am doing alright and a lot stronger and more mature as an individual w the way I handle things (pick my battles, pick my people, struggle from time to time with picking what I focus my energy on.. sometimes I get caught up w obsessing but I'm more aware of this tendency now). I feel as though I've been repressing a lot of pent up emotions, a lot of sorrow for what I've felt, perhaps I numbed myself so much just after the fallout that the compressed and repressed emotions are now reappearing when I'm stronger to deal with them.. a little bit of anger here and there for the situations he put me in as well. But it's mostly sadness about what I went through.. I want to deal(w it), I just don't know how.. help?\n\nMy memory is fuzzy now, which I take as a good sign, but I can still feel the same emotions of the particularly dire events that happened. \n\nI want to get to a point where I am able to look at the events of my past and not feel sorrow, be able to look at it without so much attachment. I was a completely different person w the N, but I'm still holding onto her now, I want to let go but I feel like I can't and I don't know why. Why am I still holding onto the remnants of the past, am I too afraid of the future? It looks brighter from where I stand now so idk why I'm so sunk and stuck w what has happened. What's your opinion on this? \n\nI just feel like I've gotten 80% of the way (thought it was 100% but now I am aware I was faking the 20%), and I don't know how to get past the remaining 20% to full recovery. It's like there are little spheres of toxic energy left in my body/mind that are holding me back. And I know I'm not supposed to be, but I can't help feeling frustrated with myself for being stuck and not being ok by now. I've been putting a lot of pressure on myself to do things that would mean I was ok (completed multiple internships and pulled my grade up), but when I was working at those things I felt I was willing it to happen so much at times it felt like my head could explode with all the self inflicted stress and wanting. While I need a chill pill sometimes, idk if it's just my usual tendencies or unnecessary force that's come about because I just want to be 'Over it', proving to myself and my family that I'm so much better now. \n\nWhile I am, I am also not quite there.. so\n\nIf you're closer to full recovery than I am, I could really use your advice and insight on how to achieve this. Thanks for reading this far, I'm very touched that you have.\n\nP.s. I don't have the $ to speak to a professional rn, and I'm not comfortable w the online route so I'd really appreciate it if these options weren't tossed around at me. I wish I could, but I really can't afford it at this point in time. \n\n",

        "text": "Long story short, was a caregiver for Nmom for many years, currently still a caregiver for Edad. She passed away earlier this year. His doctors believe he is nearing \"end of life\", and that it is simply a matter of time at this point. \n\nI haven't had a job since 2008. I have no degree, and what work experience I do have is entry-level and outdated. After all is said and done, I'll be left with an inheritance (under 150k), a year or so to myself followed by starting the long process of becoming an English citizen.\n\nI was going to buy a tiny house on wheels, but they seem to be awkward to move and can end up pretty expensive. I talked everything over with my brother, and I'm going to buy an RV instead and live in it for a year or so, while traveling around the USA. \n\nAfter a lifetime of negativity, everyone I've talked to about my plans has been nothing but supportive. I've been researching everything about living in one full-time, and narrowed down what size I'll need. I'm downsizing heavily right now, I don't want to ship tons of crap overseas when the time comes, and mom was a hoarder who tried her level best to instill the same mindset in me. I've weighed the options of renting in another city/state vs buying a house vs an RV, and this is the best option for me. It will allow me to save around 80% of the inheritance (worst case scenario, I'll still be able to put away 75% of it as a nice little nest egg). \n\nI am *terrified*. Mom got sick when I was 11. I've taken care of her off and on my whole *life*, and when Dad got sick, I ended up moving in to take care of them both. I've never lived in another town from them for more than a couple of months and with the two of them gone, I have absolutely *nothing* holding me here anymore. My brother and his kids understand that not being next door doesn't mean \"vanished off the face of the Earth\", and that I'll be able to come back and visit (and definitely will, they will all be in Florida within a few hours drive from each other by then).   \n\nPart of me is waiting for someone to say \"that is such a stupid idea\" or to point out how horrible the RV they rented in the mid 70's was and how no one can live in one for more than a weekend. It's like I'm scared to actually move forward with planning anything because any minute someone is going to say \"no, you can't\" and come up with an irrefutable reason why. And I still feel guilty planning on doing anything, I was brought up with the mindset of \"it's better to not try than to fail at doing it\". \n\nThe other part of me is absolutely giddy at the thought of doing this. I have absolutely no idea what I'm going to do to earn a living during this or after this. I'm \"old\" (relative to most people starting out in life), but there is absolutely nothing holding me back from going back to college, or starting a business or whatever.  \n\nI'm having trouble putting it all into words honestly, so this post is a bit of a ramble. I'm posting here because I don't really have anyone else to tell. RL friends are few and far between, and most people my age don't really understand the toll caregiving can take on a person, especially for someone that's had to do it for both parents with a bare minimum of assistance... for almost a decade. \n\nTLDR; Spent almost the past decade as a caregiver for my parents. Going to buy an RV and travel the US for a year before I move to England. Terrified and excited, and almost a little guilty about it. \n\n",

        "text": "So I just posted this on r/raisedbynarcissists, and then happened upon this subreddit. Though I love that one, I saw this community and thought \"maybe I'm ready to talk to people who are moving on...not quite as lost in the shit.\" Well, here goes my first post to all of you:\n\nExcuse the WALL OF TEXT. I decided to write this to purge some of my feelings based on a “breakthrough” in therapy. I figured if at least any of you reads this and you can relate, or we can feel a little less alone, then hey, double-time worth the purge. \n\nThere is a moment from when I was 13 that I’ve never been able to forget. My Ndad was newly dating my stepmom and my parents had been split up about a year. I remember everything about this exchange; where we were driving, the car we sat in, I can still see the day was overcast. I asked him, “If a tiger was going to attack me or Stepmom, who would you save?” He responded, “That will never happen so I’m not going to answer.” Now, even as a 13 year old, I knew what a dick move that was. All he had to do was quiet my nervous heart, and tell me “of course you, always you.” But my asshole dad couldn’t give his daughter what she needed most in that moment: reassurance. Thus, begins our journey of ups and down, NC, VLC, lots of tears and trying to forgive, only to be hurt again and again. \n\nMy dad is now a raging alcoholic who sometimes abuses prescription pills. We don’t speak much. In fact, we were NC until my daughter was born in October. My brother and I decided that maybe meeting his granddaughter would be motivation enough to sober up. He falls off the wagon, sobers up, apologizes, falls off, is an asshole, over and over and over. I hoped this time would be different because he’s my dad, and I’ll always want him to be “normal.” I’m NC again, to be clear.\n\nWell, in therapy this last week, I was discussing something my husband said. He told me, “You don’t know how to let things go because of him. You don't believe I’m on your side because of him.” This really got me thinking. Is he right….? Fuck, he is. My husband is now the most significant relationship I have with a man, and I am CONSTANTLY waiting for him to fail me. I walk into conversations believing he’s going to fail me. Not because he ever has (I mean, none of us are perfect, but husband is about as close as they come), but because that’s what I’ve been set up to believe. \n\nI go back to that moment when I was 13, and that seemed to be the point in my life where we veered off into the direction I’m on now. But my therapist asked me, “what was going on that you felt the need to be validated at 13? What happened up until that point that made you need your dad’s reassurance? Why wasn’t it already there?” HOLY SHIT. Honestly, I don't have a real answer. I don't remember much before that moment (about our father/daughter relationship) but it was his huge “aha!” moment. That wasn’t when my life started a new “path,” but the catalyst for finally voicing my fear: That I’m not good enough for my dad. \n\nI logically know that isn’t true. I logically know he’s a narcissist only capable of thinking of himself. But emotionally I’m that little girl, begging for my dad to love me, and getting hurt every time he acts on brand. It started a snowball effect of looking back to seemingly insignificant instances in my life that I can’t shake. Some of them I’m not proud of. Like in 5th grade when me and my other little girlfriends where so shitty to Wendy. God, what the fuck was wrong with us. Well, I realized that, (no excuse-to some degree preteens/teens are just fucking awful), that I lashed out on other people a lot. I made other people feel bad because I felt bad. Classic, right? \n\nI look back and I hate myself for that cruelty. I hate that I lied a lot growing up, or picked on my brother so much (he was the GC). I look back and I hate my fucked up way of trying to relate to men my whole life. I have spent my ENTIRE life looking for validation, and not believing when it was genuine. Instead, I believed my dad, that I’m not good enough. \n\nFUCK THAT. I’m hoping this breakthrough will help me finally forgive myself for not always doing a good job, for mistake and regrets. I’m hoping I’ll do a better job for my daughter, and make sure she ALWAYS knows, she’s worth everything good in life. Its going to take time, but I think I’m finally on the better path. Knowledge is power, amiright? \n\nThanks for reading, if you got this far. I feel so broken sometimes. I just want to be whole. \n\nEDIT: thank you for the gold! My very first. At least we have each other, right?",

        "text": "Hi - I recently saw [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/60uvij/post_nc_how_to_deal_with_a_therapist_who_is/) post and it motivated me to comment on some of my own therapy experiences last year.  \n\nI guess I was reading the comments and had some serious self-loathing/regret about the whole situation and I just need to put it out there and get some support. \n\nSo I was seeing a therapist - I outlined some of the issues I have having with her [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/5bnhq3/therapy_counsellor_doesnt_understand_so_looking/) (this was on a previous account) but I realized that my problems go deeper. \n\nThe straw that broke the camel's back was her telling me (over a long, half-hour or so conversation where I didn't talk much) that I should get in contact, or at least maintain contain with my abusive older brother because then I can 'teach' him to be better (like when has that ever worked?). It just felt so threatening and I was upset about how she seemed to never take my side. She talked a lot about my invalidating family and withholding judgement, but when I complained about being isolated and how nobody would find my body for days if I died, she said I must be the best housemate ever and laughed. \n\nI wonder if I was projecting my parents onto her and looking for another abuser type (not that she's abusive, just a bad fit) to fill my co-dependent needs. I remember thinking that she could help my mother - she'd be someone that my mother would talk to and their overly rational as oppose to my emotional approach would fit better somehow. \n\nI regret all the time spent with her, and I'm frustrated because I often think of how she prevented me from moving away from my N family because she 'wasn't a fan of running away' and I missed out on a lot of opportunities that I dreamed about for so long because of this. I hate how I keep hurting myself, and the guilt that comes from running away from innocent, well-meaning people who just can't understand N dynamics and do harm, even when they're trying to help. \n\nThese are the people that I know would like to see me happy, but are inadvertently sabotaging my happiness. It just seems like I see the whole world as abusers and I'm the problem, but if I think like that I go down the rabbit hole. \n\nThanks for listening. \n\n*Edit* Another thing she did was go on about the bonds of family and how deep they are. When I said I had no one here, she said 'well, you have family'. When I had to go to my brother's wedding and face my entire N family, she said I should try to enjoy myself. This Christmas she respected my decision to go NC and didn't push it because I think she knew that if she did, I would just bolt right then and there. ",

My theory is that it has to do with overproduction of cortisol-- the stress hormone-- at a very young age. A child's body is not meant to handle so much cortisol. I think being yelled at, being constantly afraid of making a mistake and causing an angry eruption in Ndad, and even being afraid that we would be killed by him (Ndad talked often about his desire to kill people), left my body in a constant state of \"flight\" mode, inundated with stress hormones, and caused long-term damage to my brain and endocrine organs.\n\nI realize not all N's are rageaholics...or are they? And not all rageaholics are N's?\n\nBut anyway if your Nparent was also a \"rageaholic\" -- someone who used rage to control the weaker ones around them-- maybe you know what I mean.\n\nDealing w/ this acutely now (thyroid related) and it's on my mind.

        "text": "I wanted to address some of the common things you can experience after you are free from your N.\n\n1. You may feel stuck.  If you are sitting around waiting for instruction from someone, that's common. N's control, which means they break down your mind to think for yourself.  Just start figuring out what you want in life or even at the moment, then do it.  \n\n2. Insecurities regarding friends and potential mates.  I have seen people who are free, but insecure about themselves.  Insecurities can lead to narcissism.  If you are insecure when someone talks to the individual you like, and it's fresh out of the gate, let them talk.  Nothing in the world scares away someone who has no idea what we've been through like insecurity.  Be patient, be confident, and build that relationship. The best way to fight this is to build confidence in yourself by learning and reading success stories.  Incorporate positivity into your mind until it's a belief.  Don't be a product of what N's tried to create by doing it to others.  \n\n3. The feeling of worthlessness.  This is the strongest for me personally.  I was told what to do and feel.  How I should feel all the time.  When you break free, you have no one telling you how to feel.  Now it's up to you to observe your gut feeling and emotions by the minute.  If you feel like shit, ask why.  If you feel good, ask why.  Your brain will give you the event you are looking for if you ask.  Then make the decision you want on it. (Example: I used to hate a certain group of people based on politics.  When I think about it, I don't anymore because they are humans who want to do good too). \n\n5. You are never alone, but you may feel that way.  Spend more time being with friends and family that can help you, but also be a healthy distraction.  enjoy the time you have not analyzing every motive by every person.  Even being in a chat with people who have gone through it just to talk to them can be the biggest help in the world.\n\n6. Don't take things personally.  People who aren't effected by N's love to joke around.  It's easy for us to get offended or take it very personally because of what happened.  If they are doing it on purpose, then address it.  Building confidence and a mental shield to those who will never understand is part of survival.  If you reflect enough, you can completely let go of all triggers.  This is a very important step, but also something that takes work at.  Once you do, you will feel better than you ever have.\n\nHope these help!",

        "text": "I was on a 2-hour flight, and seem to always wax philosophical in those moments. It will be 4 years this October since I've gone NC with my NMom, and here were my thoughts for anyone who's considering going NC:\n\nThe feeling of having excised from one's life a person who caused so much pain, as evidenced by one's extensive emotional damage is one of liberation and lightness. It is the feeling that no further damage or denial of the existence of said damage shall be permitted. There is no lack of love, but a renewed love in the form of compassion that is permitted across a boundary of one's design. Compassion is now far more accessible an emotion than it ever was before. From the solitude of one's newly quieted thoughts, it can be observed that the other person would prefer the situation in reverse: no boundaries and a resulting diminishment of love amidst the onslaught of hostility.\n\nThe other person defines this boundary as a lack of love, and chooses to not see the reasons for the boundary. What is most apparent is this person's inability to experience real love. There is a failure to accept or understand their loved one's dilemma for fear doing so will conflict with their need to retain control and compensate for their self-hatred and fragile ego. There is a fear that they will be forced to acknowledge their own pain, acknowledge what they have done to hide from their pain and admit that their behavior is without merit, shameful and a responsibility which they have failed to pass on to someone else. \n\nThe boundary is painful because it symbolizes their failure, returns to them the burden of their pain and imposes the challenge of having to compensate for this boundary and explain its presence in a manner that absolves them of having played a role.",

I set up the voicemail with a personalized message, 'hi this is me, please leave a message, thanks' etc.  so that's where they should start contacting me.  and for a little while, i'll contact them back so it catches on that that's my new number.\n\nThen I just notified all the people who generally call me that for a few months, my voicemail would sound like an error message, but it's fake and they can still leave voicemails if they want.  They know the deal.\n\nOnce I think family believes the new google number is my number,  i'm going to put it ALL on do not disturb.  settings will be: voicemails and texts deleted upon receipt, no record of call history.  i won't be able to have a day of weakness and check because there won't be anything TO check.  and my phone with my number will be intact.\n\nmy big master plan... just another friday.\n\n",

It is as if this is a never ending journey. Something will pop up, and I will deal with it perfectly, but then, after that, another thing, other thing, will just keep popping up, and I have to deal with it, like a stoic, pretend-to-be-calm-like person. It is as if weights are added one by one on the already existing rocks, just to see when will you collapse. I can't deal with this, I can't. I'm 20, I am just out from college(which I quit btw), I am not meant to deal with this. No. \n\nSigh.. I mean, I really want to become strong. I really want to have the strength to say, \"yes, I can. I can deal with this!\" But then, I can't. I can't. I have been there so many times. I have been *defeated* so many times. I'm sorry, mother, but I just can't. Well, why am I apologizing to her anyways? I don't know, but I really want to tell her, I can't, so that I don't have to be that child anymore. The perfect child.. you know. \n\nI'm sadden by a lot of things. By how much not many people understand this. Sometimes I wish people can just be a little more understanding, just a little. I can't talk about emotional vampirism(did I just make that word?). It's just not the topic that anyone will talk about ... I know. I know!  I've been emotionally vampired, sucked... They kind of just blamed on me, again.  I know, I can't explain it. \n\nYou know, why would people do this? *Shake my head* That's just ridiculous. I've been told my whole life I was 'too pure' for this world, and I hated it. I don't know, because why wouldn't you, you and you (to the adults I have encountered) taught me how to become self-protective? I mean in a good way, so I can refuse the rotten ones. \n\nWhy were there so many bad friends in my life? You see, that's how you have made me! (to parent)\n\nYea, sometimes I just want to kill myself. You know, killing yourself should be one of the rights --- I've been thinking about this lately. I think we should all have ownership of our lives. Sometimes I just want to die quietly in the woods of Japan, because, then, no one would know and it wouldn't 'create a scene'. Sometimes it's sad to think, because I want someone to be aside with me if I die.  If I die, may I die beautiful and peaceful, perhaps.  I don't really want to die right now, because I am listening to a beautiful music, and I still have the fortune to talk to you guys... Yea, sometimes I just feel very lonely. So lonely that I would cry, sitting on an armchair... ",

        "text": "Hi - \nI just started a new job (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/5xgdcm/i_got_a_job_support/)) and one of my co-workers is raising some serious N flags and I think it's getting to me, or at least I'm worried about it and I wanted to get some feedback. \n\nHere's what I know about her/what's happened so far-\n\n- So, my job's to make coffee/tea, and so far every tea order that I've made her has had something wrong with it. The first time, she didn't ask for milk (I'm almost sure of it) and so I didn't make it with any and then she said she had asked for it. The next time I asked if she wanted milk to double check and she said it so quietly, like to throw me off or confuse me or something (might just be paranoid here). Another time she said the tea was brewed too much, and asked me to take the tea bag out. The next time, leaving the tea bag in was OK, but then today the tea was over brewed again. Today, I brought her tea, and when I came back up after my shift, the first thing she says is the tea was very bad. She kinda said sorry, but yeah I didn't know what to say. *edit* Another time she said I didn't stir in the sugar enough. \n\n- Another time when I brought her tea to the kitchen (where she works) she immediately said \"I asked for two\". She usually has two teas but I was still getting used to orders and she didn't mention two so I only brought her one. \n\n- She asked a lot of personal questions and gave me advice right off the bat, like we were friends/mentors, but got colder when she realized it would be harder to boss me around. She said that she talks a lot and that's just her, but then a few days after I started, when I assumed we were friendly, I saw her in the morning and said \"Hey, how are you?\" and she ignored me. \n\n- Asked me to pick up a coffee cup out of the garbage (\"her garbage\") because she's responsible for the trash in the kitchen and she can't have me filling up her garbage with her trash. I didn't know this before, so now I make a special trip to the basement garbage to throw things away. It's confusing because I'm pretty sure the person who was there before me threw her trash away there before and she didn't say anything, but she really liked the person that was there before. She also didn't mention it until this week, so I thought it was OK ( I started last Monday). \n\n- She asked to see my phone, saying she just needed to see it. I asked if it was to make a call or use the internet or what for, and she said she just needed to see it again, so I got confused because that's such a personal thing, so I told her that I was sorry and that I was just confused about what she was asking and she told me it was OK and to forget it (it was to check if her friend had an iphone through imessage which I was cool with but just the way she asked it felt weirdly intrusive)\n\n- She told me I remind her of her sister who's \"quiet\" and so serious and takes everything seriously \n\n- Her sister is in NC with her and her family (mother), and when she told me this I had this sense it was a RBN thing. I have no idea if I'm projecting here, it was just a feeling. \n\n- She gives me confusing directions and led me to another room to get paper towels when I just needed a few and was also on my shift so didn't want to be led astray somewhere when I had to serve people. \n\n- Then she gave me a new packet of paper towels and (I think?) told me to use those from now on for supplies but when I opened it she's like why did you open it but why would she give it to me if not to open???\n\nReading back over the list, it all seems like such small things. \n\nAnyway, is this all in my head? Am I projecting??? I felt this flash of anger today when she told me I was quiet and too serious like her sister. Like I could get her hatred vibes and that desire to get under my skin. I really liked her at first - she seemed friendly and I've tried to be polite - generally I like to be left alone to work, or at least not distracted and I'm trying to be more social to parents and the other co-workers who I'm trying to build a better relationship with. \n\nI try not to let her personality get to me, and I try not to take anything personally and just be polite and accommodating when appropriate. That cold flash of anger I felt and the desire to put up a psychic wall between me and anything to do with her worried me, though. \n\n",

        "text": "I wrote this piece of non-fiction prose as a way of processing how I feel after 3-ish years of therapy to deal with my NMom. It is very long and personal, and ends with two poems. I hope some people can relate to this. I wrote it without really knowing what I'd do with it, but felt like I should share it somewhere at least.  \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n                  \n++++++++  \n                   \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhen I look back on the past few years of therapy I feel like I’ve come a long way.  \n                   \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe first time I went to my appointment, I said “My mother used to criticise me harshly,” and then spent the next 45 minutes weeping uncontrollably, unable to speak save for a few choked replies here and there.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;      \n\n“How did that make you feel?”  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n“B-b-bad...”  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy poor therapist looked at me with that expression people get when they hear something awful but don’t really know what to say. It’s something like pity and empathy, but also helplessness. I was incredibly embarrassed about the whole thing; here I was paying to cry and stammer in someone’s office for 45 minutes every week. It seemed awkward for everyone involved. I also had to go back to work afterwards and pretend that I hadn’t just spent my lunch weeping. I did this for at least 3 more sessions, crying while barely saying anything. I was comforted by the idea that my therapist probably saw a lot worse, and also that I was paying her good money to listen to me. This was totally worth her time, I reasoned. It was also evidence of how badly I needed therapy.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI started going because my mother was coming to visit. I’d moved to another city in another country, eloped, and as a formality invited my mother and brother, sister-in-law, and nieces, to come meet with my new husband. My family is not close at all. We only meet each other for occasions like this; someone is getting married, someone is dying. Now that I lived a 5 hour flight away, I didn’t even do normal holidays or birthdays. So this was the first time in almost 2 years that I would see my family.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFor a month and a half, while we made plans for them to visit me, I wept every day.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI came home from work, at 9, 10, 11 o’clock at night, having done overtime for the nth day in a row, sat down on my couch, and silently stared at our 30 gallon fish tank while tears streamed down my face for an hour or more. My husband, worried, would come check on me and ask if there was something he could do. “Is it something I did? Do you want to talk about it?” No, I would say. I’m just stressed that my mom is coming to visit.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter a few days, he started suggesting I go to therapy. “I know a therapist, I have her card here.” It’s ok, I would say. I’ll get over it.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter a week, he said “How about I just give her a call and make an appointment for you? What day can you go?” This signalled to me that things were really bad, and something needed to be done. I made the appointment myself.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n++++++++  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI hate crying. I don’t make any noise when I cry either; I haven’t sobbed sincerely since I was a child. I tried wailing and sobbing a bit in my late teens and early twenties, just to see if it would feel better. It just felt odd and mechanical. People talk about feeling relieved afterwards, or that it’s cathartic, but I can’t relate. Crying has always been shitty for me, and afterwards I just feel drained and empty, or worse.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt’s not a mystery where this came from. Whenever I cried, my mother (almost always the cause of my crying), would taunt me or verbally abuse me. Some of my earliest memories are of my mother yelling.   \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n“You think your life is sooo hard! Waahh wah!” She would shout in Cantonese, imitating my crying. “You don’t know anything! You don’t know what a hard life even means!” The more she screamed at me, the angrier she got. The volume of her voice would rise and rise until it cracked from the strain. The tendons in her neck would stand out as she thrust her head forward like a vicious dog barking, pushing her face into mine while I flinched away and looked at the floor, at the chair, at the hem of my shirt. Hours would go by like this. Once she quieted down, I would slowly get up from my chair and walk to my room, closing the door behind me quietly. If I slammed it, she would start all over again. Sometimes she would think of something particularly witty and hateful, something that hadn’t occurred to her during her earlier tirade, and she would burst into my room just to make sure she got to say it. Sometimes she would burst into my room to see if I was still crying, and if I was, she would start up all over again. She once woke me up in the middle of the night to scream at me for something I’d done a month prior. Years later, in my late 20’s, she screamed at me the same way after I’d been living apart from her for awhile. I started hyperventilating.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo, crying has never really been an option for me, nor has it ever been a source of catharsis. Crying has only ever been about humiliation and pain. To stop myself from crying I would lay on the floor and hold my breath. My heart would clench as if I was squeezing all my feelings into a tiny ball. I would press and press inwards until I felt dizzy, and the pain would flow from my heart all the way to the tips of my fingers. After a while, there would be no more tears.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n++++++++  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAt some point after a year and a half of therapy, I felt better. Honestly, I think the events of my childhood just needed to be heard by someone face to face. I needed someone to hear what I said, and tell me in professional terms that my mother had a problem. That what I experienced was not normal; that the problem is not, and never was, me. And that this means there is nothing I can do to solve it.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI’ve told my friends some bits and pieces through online journals and chats. I’ve only been able to talk about it face to face with a few people, and it’s always difficult. And afterwards I always think, “Of course your friends are on your side. They’re your friends. They want to be nice to you.”   \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThese are actually my mother’s words, echoing back from long ago to haunt me today. It never occurred to me that my friends were on my side because my mom was in the wrong. But somehow, a trained therapist is different. This person acts as an authority on psychological issues. You get the sense that they won’t offer you cheap platitudes when what you really need is to change yourself. It’s easier to believe someone who seems invested in your actual well-being, not in your short-term sense of Okayness.   \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI had always thought that there was something I hadn’t done, some tactic I hadn’t yet tried, that would fix everything. Maybe I needed to be more firm with her. Maybe I needed to be more open. Maybe I needed to educate myself more about dealing with difficult people. The truth is that it doesn’t matter what I do. My mother is the one who needs to change, not me. My behaviour always flowed from hers -- she wrote the rules, made the template for how I needed to act. If she doesn’t like my behaviour now, then she only has herself to blame. I knew this, and yet I kept thinking that I should keep trying. Tenacity, I’ve read, is one of the markers for high IQ. Problem solving ability has a lot to do with how long and hard you are willing to work on a problem, failing and coming up with different methods to get to a solution. Though I can’t tell where the line between tenacity and stupidity lies anymore. Surely it is no longer intelligent to keep working on a problem that you know can’t be solved, for 20+ years? It became like a gambling addiction; there was a slim possibility that I’d hit the jackpot and my relationship with her would be OK. Until then, I kept sinking my emotional capital into it, like handfuls of tokens disappearing into a slot machine.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n++++++++  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy mother is an amazing woman.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nShe was abandoned at birth in a village near Hong Kong and taken in by illiterate rice farmers. She lived a harsh, Cinderella-like life slaving for her parents and a younger sibling, the biological child of her adoptive parents. She went to a school set up by Catholic missionaries, graduated at 16, and went on to work as a secretary for a Supreme Court Judge in order to support her family. At that time, the government was still run entirely by the British, so she spoke British-accented English, wore fashionable clothes, and drew dress designs for the wives of Judges. When she met my father, they began to dream of moving up in life. They moved to Canada, where my mother, who couldn’t understand the Canadian accent, could no longer write shorthand fast enough to be a proper secretary. She worked at A&amp;W in the kitchen, instead. Burger by burger, she put my father through engineering school. She went to night school and got her accounting degree shortly after he graduated.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy brother was born, and then six years later I was born. Her relationship with my father was already deteriorating by the time I came along. They were divorced by the time I was 3, a messy and dramatic affair by my mother’s account. My father won’t tell me his side of the story.  He only says “Ask your mother”.   \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo an immigrant single mother raised two kids by herself. She eventually started her own accounting practice and had a pleasant office downtown. We moved to the nice part of the city and lived in a White neighbourhood and went to good schools. My mother bought us nice clothes, we drove a nice car. We went to ballet lessons, badminton practice, piano lessons, speech arts classes, and karate. We vacationed at Disneyland and Disney World, New York City and Montreal, hiked in the summer and went skiing in the Winter. Her business grew and so did her children, so we moved to a bigger house a few minutes away. One with hardwood floors, a big yard and a garage. We had a dog, and the newest computer, and the fastest internet. My brother skipped grades and graduated at 16, and we both did IB classes and graduated with Honors.   \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nShe never remarried. She wore fabulous thousand dollar suits to work, and taught me about quality and style. She is almost 70 and refuses to stop wearing 3” heels, even though she fractured her ankle one year when she slipped on some ice. Her brand of feminism is from the 60’s; act like a man to get ahead, but dress like a lady so you can still use your charm if you have to. She gave us everything we needed to get ahead in life, by hook or by crook. She worked so hard, so very hard.   \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nShe always accused me of not being grateful. But I am. I am profoundly grateful for the wonderful things she’s given me; financial support, education, opportunity, taste, style, privilege. It’s the other things I’m not grateful for. And unfortunately, those things persisted even after the wonderful things were no longer necessary. There was nothing good left in our relationship after I didn’t need her to raise me anymore. Only our twisted love, mixed with equal parts of twisted hate.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n++++++++  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe year after my mother and brother visited me, I brought my husband back home to meet my friends and my father. My father showed me a thick envelope of photos of my mother he had found in his storage. He wanted to give them back to her. When I looked at them I wanted to cry. I look so much like she did then.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhen I was growing up, I wanted desperately to be like her. She would always say that I took after my father’s side, and looked like my youngest aunt. This was considered a compliment, I think, as she is the best-looking of my father’s sisters. My mother had me late in life, so I only knew her as an older-looking lady with smile lines and crow’s feet, her cheeks no longer plump. But in the photos, you can see the resemblance clearly. We have the exact same smile.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI wonder if she looked at me and saw her own face? If she loved me as she loved herself, and hated me as she hated herself too. Were the awful things she said directed at me, or was she looking in a mirror through time and space, seeing the child version of her staring back at her?  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhen I think of things like that, I want to weep for her too. I inherited her sadness along with her face.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n++++++++  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nShe used to tell me about her childhood, when I was young. As young as 3 or 4 years old. Too young to be playing therapist for a grown woman. I would cry, listening to her stories. I couldn’t yet tell where her emotions ended and mine began. From then on, her sadness was my sadness, her anger was my anger. If I think about it now, I was probably depressed for the entire time. From ages 3 to 27, I was more or less depressed. Like an empty vessel, she poured her emotions into me until I was overflowing.   \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI had to learn to block whatever I could. No emotions came in or out when I was around her. My tone of voice was carefully flat, lest it be criticised. I would only say neutral things like “Is that so?” or “I see”, and avoid expressing any kind of opinion. My mother started into Buddhism, and she stopped yelling. She still said the same things to me, she just spoke them calmly while playing solitaire instead of screaming them into my face. Sometimes I would try to argue with her, which only made her diatribes longer. I would still weep silently, and then get up from my chair when she was done and lay on my bedroom floor, holding my breath.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI became convinced that there was something wrong with me. That I was weak, and that if only I was stronger I wouldn’t cry like this all the time. I was sick of myself. How could I be crying when I wasn’t a poor orphan? What right did I have to feel sad in this beautiful house with hardwood floors, with the big yard and the dog, with the best of everything? Outside, other people were laughing and the sun was shining. Only I was sad, and weak, and useless like this.   \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI can’t remember her saying any of those things to me. I don’t remember much of what she said during her lectures. I was always away, mentally gone. When I try to remember it now, it’s like watching video without sound. I remember the color of the floor and how it looked with the light hitting it on an overcast day, and the clenching of my heart. But I don’t know where those thoughts would have come from, if not from her.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs I was laying on the floor and thinking about all the things that were wrong with me, I thought about dying. Not killing myself, per se. Just, ceasing to exist. Like if I got hit by a bus, or my heart just stopped beating. Sometimes I thought about cutting myself, but I was afraid. Something like that left evidence that people could find. I didn’t want anyone to know, especially not my mother. If she found evidence, she would invariably use it against me. It would be evidence that I was weak, subhuman, broken. Incapable of any of the things that normal people are capable of; things like living, and being grateful for what you have, being happy and loving your mother who sacrificed everything for you.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n++++++++  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI look back on myself with sadness and empathy. I feel sorry for the me that felt that way. Sometimes it’s like it was a completely different life; as though it was a sad story that I watched, but belongs to someone else. I often wonder if I made it all up. That life is so very different from the life that I have now. There is no trace of that life anywhere in my new life, none of the locations or the people or the belongings. There is only what is inside my head, and online journal entries that were written by someone more childish than me. Like this, it is possible to believe it was all a fantastic delusion.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThat version of me no longer exists, and perhaps never existed. Like waking up from a bad dream, the me at present is the only me, and all the other selves that had those experiences dissipate as another day passes.   \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n++++++++  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLoved (Part I)  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nYou loved me in the worst of ways.  \n\nThrew a net of gold and silver over me,  \n\nhung heavy jewels around my neck.  \n \nWealth raining down, pelting and bruising  \n\nI was drowning   \n\nbreaking underneath the weight  \n\nCouldn't breathe, strangled voice straining  \n\nCoins pouring into my mouth and  \n\ndown my throat,  \n\nfilled my belly with shame and gilt.  \n\nYou stab me with your best dagger  \n\nright up to the hilt, and gut me  \n\nspill my history all over the expensive rug  \n\ndiamonds and intestines mingling  \n\nyour shoes squishing  \n\nyou pinpoint all my flaws, bit by bit  \n\nwith knives and claws.  \n\nI'm in pieces, my skull collapsing like hammered gold  \n\nbludgeoned into obedience with the hull of a fine ship  \n\nand bought and paid for, no words leave my lips.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nYou heave the stories of your pain onto my back  \n\nme, a pack animal, has no say  \n\nI carry them for you, day after day, and when I falter  \n\nwhen my legs grow bowed and I veer  \n\nwhen a tear slips from my eye  \n\nwhen my tongue is insolent to your ear and when I curse the sky  \n\nYou throw a net of gold and silver over me,  \n\nhang heavy jewels around my neck.   \n\nThe finery burns into my wounds, takes hold  \n\nYou don't find it cruel  \n\nmy torso stuffed with shit but patched with silk and tulle  \n\nforce-fed and then swallowed whole  \n\nmy mouth is full of shame, and guilt  \n\nnot built to house a soul, my flesh rips  \n\nbut bought and paid for, nothing leaves my lips.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n++++++++  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nLoved (Part II)  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nNow I bray into the wind.   \n\nThe heat and stench of my breath  \n\nreaching farther than the stain of your decay.  \n\nThe filthy things I say offend you so  \n\nthat I am made real, of flesh  \n\nand not just your imagined thing  \n\nsaddled with your baggage and   \n\nthe sting of your judgement on my cheek.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nTo defend, I speak against  \n\nthe onslaught of words that attack  \n\nfrom all sides, my hide tanned by critique  \n\nbut scarred and torn, I still block my wounds  \n\ntry to avoid your scorn as best I can  \n\nI struggle up this muddy slope   \n\nbut sometimes rest on fetid ground to recharge  \n\nor to cope with the things I've found.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI am shredded, torn apart,  \n\nbut I live and fight another day  \n\neven my weak heart can beat   \n\nthis pain away.

        "text": "There was a time before my parents divorced. I was five when they did. I guess that I'm about three years old. The memory is very clear. My dad hit the table with his hand making a really high sound I guess he was yelling as well. My oldest brother had already fled to our grandmother just 100 meters away. I'm standing in the hallway watching a big map over Scandinavia. I don't know where my mother and middle brother are. I'm crying because I was scared. My dad comes up to me and can't understand why I'm crying. He was not mad at me. I remember that I can't explain but that I know that he was not mad at me. I guess I was kind of the golden child, or me and my middle brother was. My oldest brother has a small disability. My middle brother was the number one favorite. My dad's philosophy has always been that you can scare your children to make them behave. I guess he was right. Even if it fucked us up. We did behave, but me and my oldest brother can't spend more then two hours with him today. And it's not only because of the memories, after two hours he tries to start controlling your life again. He can't stop. I guess. I got lucky, I only had to live in that hell hole every other week (after the divorce). But I guess it broke me down to get sent away again and again and again. To know what could be. And even when I knew the difference between loving and hell I did not question the abnormal behavior of my dad and his wife. I remember a game we played in school a friend would come up and clap hands right in front of the face and if u blinked you where afraid of your parents. I was very straight forward with the fact that I was afraid of my dad but not my mom, and I remember being surprised when my friend could not choose what parent she liked the best. I guess I'm free now, but will I ever be free for real?",

Just need to share this.\n\nNMom is blocked on my phone, email, social media, everywhere. \n\nBut I got an email from flying monkey sister today, which contained an 'urgent' and 'important' message from NMom.\n\nThe salient points of the email are as follows:\n\n- NMom is selling the family home \n\n- NMom is buying an apartment which she will rent out.\n\n- The rental income will be split between NMom and my two sisters. \n\n- Plus some lengthy justification of how PP you are doing really well and don't need any extra money at the moment, so that's why you're not getting any. (Not that Id want any anyway!) (Plus we haven't spoken in 4 years so she can't possibly know how my life is going anyway!) \n\n- Plus, \"the door is always open to you PP\" (yeah, right, the door to that emotional cage you raised me in. I'm not going back in there.) \n\nSo essentially, nothing has changed. My life will continue exactly as before, and NMom is still playing weird mind games. \n\nExcept that it is really annoying getting this message. It's just NMom finding something new to kick up a drama about and try to get a reaction from me. And also a way to try to create some friction between me and my sisters. \n\nUrghhh! \n\nI went NC by ghosting. But I wonder if now is the time to send an email to say 'Do not contact me again, I will treat it as harassment and contact the police if you contact me again' \n\nBut maybe that's just inviting more drama... \n\nJust ughhhh.",

        "text": "Hey everyone,\nI haven't been posting here much since switching over from RBN. I started seeing a therapist in the middle of last year, and we're almost done with 45 hours, most of them double-sessions. Before christmas, we were both confident I wouldn't need more therapy, but as most of you know, christmas can be a rough time. During that time, I think I got started on the second of two \"trauma complexes\", namely the bigger one, the abandonement and abuse coming from my mother, the first one being the abuse one of my sisters subjected me to.\nThe point I am at now is this: I can identify three states of mind I flash back to; the first one is the oldest, the one that came into being the earliest in my life: That part is coninced I am a failure and terrible, is looking for proof of that in everything I do but then, strangely, tries to suppress it all (this is due to a lot of double bind stuff my mother did).\nThe second part, the middle one, is afraid that my self-image is wrong and the projections from my abuse caregivers are after all correct; this part is mostly associated with fear.\nThe third and youngest part is simply afraid of being punished for thinking or doing or knowing the wrong thing.\n\nI'm feeling not too bad about all this, as it's a step forward from just being lost in a general trauma melange. My therapist is leaving town, and we've been discussing continuing my therapy for a while now. I can't keep seeing her, so that's no option. I'd like to ask you for experiences with and recommendations for different methods of therapy; so far the paradigm has been cognitive behavioral therapy, and we've been doing IRRT (imaginative reliving, restructuring and reintegrating of traumatic experiences) as well as focusing. This has been good for certain events, but I think what I would need at this point is something a little more overarching, that deals with introjects, projections and viewpoints forced on someone over a long time, not just single traumatic experiences (which were more the stick to get me to behave exactly like I was supposed to).\n\nThank you all for suggestions; I don't mind different schools than cbt, but psychoanalysis probably isn't an option.\n\nAs for the progress I promised, I had two dreams yesterday and the day before yesterday; one of my typcial subtle nightmare, in which I was driving a car through a city, got lost and every turn just landed me deeper in trouble – however, this time, the otherwise impassive surroundings actually aided me and were on my side.\nEven better, yesterday I dreamed I was living with my \"mother\" again, with her making excuses for my present, but not visible sister again. However, I confronted her and told her that she was putting her sensitivities above my needs again. Of course, she denied it, but I didn't back down. It felt good, and I woke up feeling my subconsciousness is catching up on the work I've been doing :)\n\nAny way, thank you for your time.",
