        "text": "According to google, there are 4,294,967,296 possible IPv4 addresses. This is a large number, but there are definitely more devices than that on the internet. Probably at least an order of magnitude more. Obviously IPv6 exists to make up for this, but it's possible for me to disable IPv6 on my computer and take only an IPv4. My intuition is that there are at least 5 billion other devices in existence that force this.\n\nSo how is this overflow handled? Are addresses duplicated? Is there an order of priority for one device to take the address from another? I apologize if this question is due to a lack of understanding by my part.",
