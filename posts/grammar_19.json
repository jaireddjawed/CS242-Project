It influenced many aspects of me which I consider important. Three of which are: my day-to-day routine, learning, and friendships. \n\nPrior to starting to code, I didn't really have an outline of what I wanted to do in the future. So, excluding going to school, my day-to-day routine mostly consisted of playing video games.\n\nAfter starting to code, though, I stopped playing video games for the most part; coding seemed more fun than playing video games. So, I spent the time I previously spent playing video games on coding.\n\nCoding also affected my learning; before starting to code, I had a major problem learning things. To start off, I had a negative outlook on learning new things. This stemmed from an unrealistic expectation I had, thinking that I should be able to learn everything easily and quickly. I'm not sure why I had this expectation. Since I was constantly learning new things while coding, \n\nI eventually stopped having this expectation, and grew comfortable with my learning speed. This was important, because it made me a lot more open to learning new things.\n\nSince I didn't really know what I wanted to do with my life, prior to coding, I used to randomly talk to people and make friends. Eventually, I stopped unnecessarily making conversation with people. Coding also made me stop doing things that made me relatable to other people: playing football, playing video games, etc. So, having friends outside of school became difficult.\n\nTo conclude, there may be more aspects of my life which coding changed, the preceding three were the ones I could think of at the top of my head. Undoubtedly though, coding played a big hand at forming my identity. Whether that be in a good or a bad way.",

I think a  lot of native speakers simply consider the present perfect to be more recent because a recent action is more likely to have an impact on the present compared to something I did 10 years ago. Or is it actually true that when I come up to you and say \"I have finished my homework\"  without any additional context that would justify this to be relevant for the present like \"I have finished my homework. Can I go outside now\"  you would still consider this to be a more recent action than \"I  finished my homework. As you all know I find this topic quite interesting so I thought I would ask here and see what the rest of you things. By the way is my use of the perfect correct in my example? I  feel like whenever I add such a sentence that starts with now in the second part present perfect works quite well since \"I have finished all my work can I go home now\" definitely sounds like the first part is relevant for the present because it is the reason I want to go home now.",

As far as I know, adverbs can go before or after the verbs they modify. The exception to this is \"well,\" which must always go after the verb and not before. I guess the exception to the exception is this U.S. Senate Oath of Office, where the speaker swears that they will \"well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office.\" That sounds strange to me, yet correct at the same time because it's probably very formal English.

This has to be by far the biggest fiesta I've ever seen on a grammar reddit and after at least 20 different answers by now I am sure that natives simply develop a personal understanding and pattern how to use these two and from one native to the other this differs greatly. So I suppose instead of trying to learn any rules ill just do so as well and create my own habits and pattern for these two.
