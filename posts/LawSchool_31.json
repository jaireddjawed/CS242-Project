        "text": "1L in Canada here! Last term I did every single reading in detail with briefs, but I honestly don‚Äôt think it helped that much for the exam. This this term I am balancing a bit more self care while still putting in a good reading effort before classes and reviewing notes/PPTs on the weekend. Did dropping some readings in term 2 of 1L bite anyone in the ass? For context, I am happy with my grades for term 1, but there was a direct correlation between how well I did and the stress level I felt toward an exam/paper. The higher the stress, the lower the grade. The thing I thought I was going to fail on and thought I could not give my best effort in, I actually got an A‚Ä¶ sooooo it really made me re-think the late nights reading and stressing myself out. \n\nI know your experiences will of course vastly differ and everyone has to figure out what works for them, but I‚Äôm just curious to know other people‚Äôs experiences with dropping readings and exam performance. \n\nThanks and congrats to the other fellow 1L‚Äôs on making it to the next step!",

Networking feels like torture to me and I‚Äôm very socially awkward. If I just focus on raising my GPA and skip out on networking entirely, will I be screwed at OCI? If networking is really necessary, what would be a good minimum goal to set for myself (like number of 1L firm receptions per month or something)?

I don't have a history of drugs, but I did try some cocaine in 1L year. Are these things to be concerned about and should I disclose them?

My guilty feeling comes from the fact that I cannot be compared against my peers on a time-pressured test. I feel I deserve my GPA as with undergrad, but not the rank. The GPA is also informed by the curve however. What do you think as a law student without accomodations?\n\nAnother area of guilt- Throughout my life, I've had a \"filter problem\" with what I say. I feel like a liar for not telling anyone about my test accomodations. I thought about it before opening my mouth and reasoned that best case scenario their opinion of me will not change and worst case scenario they will feel jealous or resentful of me. The other people from my law school I saw at the disability testing center reached out to me not tell anybody about them being there either for stigma.

It may not have occurred to you that you're depressed (or could be a thyroid thing), but if you feel crappy all the time, there could be something else going on. If there is, don't wait to act until a crisis comes. It's better to get anti-depressants, get a therapist, start thinking about whether any life/thought changes would be helpful etc. before it gets really really bad. \n\nIt genuinely did not occur to me that I was depressed even though I definitely was.

They're generally exclusively or largely diversity positions (and firms vary in what qualifies). 1L class sizes are extremely small compared to 2L class sizes, which are already rare, highly competitive positions.\n\nLast year, V10 firms cumulatively had 1,798 2L summer associates but only 238 1L summer associates. Think about how hard it is to get BigLaw normally for your 2L summer, then cut that to 1/10 the chance. And given the uncertainty in the economy, it makes more sense for firms to cut 1L positions because 1L summers are even more of a cost sink than 2L.\n\nChill out.",

I am currently in my last year of high school, planning on studying a 3 year  undergraduate Bcom Law degree (not LLB) in South Africa and then I will be moving to the UK due to family related reasons. What would be the best way of starting and finishing my law studies in the Uk? I‚Äôm also a bit concerned with the amount of years I‚Äôll still have to study for. Any advice appreciated.",
