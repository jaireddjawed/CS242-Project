I'm sold.\n\n'Some business within Ipswich have begun offering above award-level wages to attract and retain staff. But it's an incentive many can't afford.\n\n\"A lot of businesses that I speak to are operating purely on the margin,\" said Mr Bell. \"So the capacity to pay sort of higher than award rates or higher than going rates for local labour simply isn't there.\"'\n\n- Businesses can't afford the cost of doing business. That sounds like an unsuccessful business model. \n\n\"I think it really comes down to people want to be part of an organisation, part of a culture. They want employers that care, that want to see their people grow as well. You don't always have to throw cash at something to solve a problem, that's a short-term stop gap I believe.\"\n\n- So paying above award wages is both not a long term solution and not what employees want.
