For a sample input of:\n\n`- * / 15 - 7 + 1 1 3 + 2 + 1 1`\n\nI have managed to draw the recursive tree which helped a lot, and I found that polish( ) is called 15 times; and the input has 15 operators and operands.  My first thought was that it is a O(n) function, however I'm not too sure, and am getting confused. Additionally, when analysing line-by-line, I understand that an operation such as '=' or '+' is a constant, but what should be done when analysing a line such as the last line in the code.  Do I need to lookup the function in the cstdlib header and continue the analysis?  Same for input.c\\_str()?\n\nI'd greatly appreciate any assistance anyone can provide.\n\n    int polish(istringstream&amp; is) {\n            \n        string input;\n        is &gt;&gt; input;\n       \n        if (input == \"+\" || input == \"-\" || input == \"*\" || input == \"/\") \n        {        \n            int first = polish(is);\n            int second = polish(is);\n            \n            if (input == \"+\") return first + second;\n            else if (input == \"-\") return first - second;\n            else if (input == \"*\") return first * second;\n            else return first / second;\n        }\n        else return atoi(input.c_str());\n    }",

Philosophy is a subject that I am very interested in and read several posts regarding on how Philosophy ties together very well with CS. I feel that Computer Science and Philosophy is a double major that I am really considering.\n\nHowever, I am very unsure about my university choice and if all universities do allow for a double major or is it considered a single degree. I am also unfamiliar with how universities work in general, if taking a double major means that I will have to be taking twice as many classes and may be too overwhelming?\n\nAnd, if anyone has any recommendations for any universities (possibly in Canada and the UK) that I should consider for this double major. To give an idea, for my IGCSE results I did pretty well with 5A\\* and 3A as my result.\n\nI have tried to search and find different universities but I want to know from a student / professional point of view for which university degrees that are sought for and your personal experience with any universities.\n\nI hope you guys can help me out. Thanks a bunch :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for commenting - it really helped me make up my mind! Grateful that I could get so many comments! :)",

        "text": "Hi guys, \n\nCame across the following question in a Discrete maths text book:\n\nIn ordinary algebra, the null factor law for multiplication states that if xy = 0, then x = 0 or y = 0. Is this true for:\na) Logic \nb) Sets\nc) Boolean Algebra\n\nI understand this as the following:\n\na) It is true for Logic. Multiplication is the same as the AND method and 0 = F. If pANDq = F, then you either have TF, FT or FF. I.e. one of p and q are 0/false. \n\nb) It is not true for sets, because multiplication is the AND function again, but zero is the null set. As such, for setA and setB to produce the nullset, it just means there is nothing in common between setA and setB. This does not mean setA and/or setB are empty... \n\nc) Boolean: I read this argument exactly the same as the logic argument. So the answer would be yes it does hold.\n\nHowever the answers to the textbook says:\n9 a) True, b) False - does not hold, c) False - does not hold.\n\nI do not understand why this does not hold for Boolean Algebra. Any help would be appreciated. \n\n\n",

I'm a fairly fast learner, but the shut off for enrolments is happening fairly soon. I'm mainly wondering what sort of knowledge I should already have before I even attempt a comp science course. \n\nI've started and going fairly well at codeacademy for Python (which they list as a first-used coding language in the degree) and have started up khan academy to brush up on my past math and to look into linear algebra and calculus. \n\nI'm really not sure I'll be able to totally grasp all of these different categories of knowledge before enrolments are cut off. So I guess I'm asking, would you dive into a computer science degree and learn these sorts of things along the way, or would you delay another year of university to learn these things before enrolling? \n\nI personally want to enrole, but I'm not sure if it'd be a big mistake. \n",

My main question is how pertinent is this to getting my degree and do employers look at this? What makes this different from other certifications? Looking around the internet I haven’t found much positive opinions on it. Many people seem to not even be familiar with it.",
