        "text": "**Does Residential Sorting Explain Geographic Polarization?**\n\nA research paper seeking to answer exactly this question was published March 23, 2018 by Gregory J. Martin and Steven W. Webster of Emory University.\n\n&gt; **Abstract:**\n\n&gt; Political preferences in the US are highly correlated with population density, at national, state, and metropolitan-area scales. Using new data from voter registration records, we assess the extent to which this pattern can be explained by geographic mobility. We find that the revealed preferences of voters who move from one residence to another correlate with partisan affiliation, though voters appear to be sorting on non-political neighborhood attributes that covary with partisan preferences rather than explicitly seeking politically congruent neighbors. But, critically, we demonstrate through a simulation study that the estimated partisan bias in moving choices is on the order of five times too small to sustain the current geographic polarization of preferences. We conclude that location must have some influence on political preference, rather than the other way around, and provide evidence in support of this theory.\n\n**Wikipedia:** [Partisan sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partisan_sorting)\n\nExcerpt from [truth decay](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2314.html), beginning page 180 of the [PDF](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR2300/RR2314/RAND_RR2314.pdf) (156 of the source document):\n\n&gt; **Political Polarization at the Popular Level**\n\n&gt; Political polarization has also occurred outside of Congress and is apparent in broader society. The consistency of partisan voting among Republicans and Democrats is at an all-time high, meaning that a given voter is increasingly likely to vote only for Democrats or only for Republicans in election after election. Over the past 20 years, the percentage of voters expressing views that are consistently liberal or conservative has more than doubled, from 10  percent to 21  percent. Political polarization is exacerbated by __geographic polarization__—people who share similar political views tend to live close to each other,rather than being distributed throughout the population. Analysis of voting returns for the 2016 presidential election show that, out of 3,113 counties in the nation, fewer than 10  percent had a single-digit margin of electoral victory in the presidential election; in 1992, more than one-third of counties fit this description. As Figure 4.6 shows, the number of landslide counties, where the margin of electoral victory is more than 50 percent, has also increased dramatically over the past 25 years, as has the share of voters who live in extremely polarized counties. Looking at the period from 1976 to 2012 shows the median number of landslide counties as 450 and the average as 472. In 2016, 1,196 counties were decided by margins greater than 50 percent—about 2.5 times as many as the average over the preceding 20 years. There are a number of reasons for this change, including politically motivated redistricting and sorting between parties, both of which have contributed to the homogeneity in political districts that is driving this trend in landslide elections. Both of these issues are addressed later in this chapter.\n\n&gt; In addition to the measures already shown, political polarization can also be observed in trends in the beliefs and attitudes of people on each side of the political spectrum, both within the government and among the electorate. For example, since 1970, party elites have grown farther apart regarding environmental spending, and attitudes among\nthe public have followed suit, becoming increasingly polarized along party lines. At the level of the electorate, polls show that Republicans and Democrats have very different views on several key issues:\n\n&gt; * A May 2017 Quinnipiac University poll reported that 49 percent of Republicans approved of the American Health Care Act while approval among Democrats was well below 10 percent.\n\n&gt; * A 2017 Pew Research Center survey found that about 90 percent of Democrats expressed support for the media acting as a government “watchdog,” compared with about 40 percent of Republicans. (This is a sharp change from 2011, when about 60 percent of respondents on both sides of the political aisle expressed this view.)\n\n&gt; * A December 2016 survey showed that 58 percent of Republican respondents reported that environmental regulations are too costly and hurt jobs and the economy, a position held by 17 percent of Democrats.\n\n&gt; Although there has never been a consensus on these issues—healthcare, views of the media’s role, and environmental regulations—disagreement appears to be deepening at an increasing rate. It is not just that Americans live in a divided political society but that this divide is becoming increasingly deep and increasingly difficult to counter.\n\n&gt; Data and metrics presented thus far suggest a strongly polarized electorate, but it is important to understand the sources of this divide. A closer look at a number of additional metrics suggest that the widening divide between Republicans and Democrats at the popular level could be due to party sorting rather than an actual shift in attitudes. For\nexample, the number of people who identify as independents or who place themselves at or near the midpoint on the political spectrum has not decreased. Furthermore, public opinion polls reveal a number of areas of consensus across party lines, including the value of democracy and the importance of Medicare and Medicaid. One explanation for\nthe apparent contradiction between (1)  data on the number of landslide counties and the sharp partisan divides and (2) data that suggest areas of agreement and stability in the number of independent voters could be party sorting. The concept of party sorting suggests that, rather than changing their attitudes, people are shifting and sorting themselves\ninto two more-homogenous parties consisting of people who used to be mixed across party lines. Thus, median voter attitude on either side of the partisan divide might appear to have become more extreme although attitudes of the electorate have not changed at the aggregate level.\n\n&gt; This explanation lends nuance to an understanding of how polarization could be affecting the broader electorate. Opinions might not be growing more extreme, but the distance is increasing between parties in terms of both their platforms and the mean preferences of their members. However, this is still a form of polarization at the systemic, electorate level. Americans on both sides of the political spectrum are increasingly farther apart on a wide range of political and social issues, increasing the finality, severity, and consequences of this division. It seems that many areas of disagreement involve issues about which people care deeply and feel strongly: immigration, economic inequality, moral issues, and government intervention. When it comes to polarization, the cross-party chasm appears to have the most-significant implications for Truth Decay. As the party divide\nwidens, communication across the gap becomes increasingly difficult and the sharing of ideas and opinions ceases. This creates echo chambers on each side: Each group has its own narrative and worldview, both of which might be incomplete or contain inaccuracies but thrive because they go unchallenged within the party.\n\nAlso see: /r/truthdecay\n\nDoes residential sorting explain geographic polarization, and what can be done to combat its effects?",

My first question is the following: how do we assess this claim when definitions of both \"race\" and \"social construct\" are nebulous at best? If our definition of \"social construct\" amounts to little more than \"created by society,\" what *isn't* a social construct? Isn't all knowledge communicated via human language, by this definition, socially constructed?\n\n\nMy second question, and the subject of the title, regards Witherspoon et. al's 2007 paper in *Genetics* titled \"Genetic Similarities Within and Between Human Populations\" (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1893020/). In this paper, the authors address an argument typically put forth in support of race constructivism, namely that individuals differ more *within* populations than *between* them. This turns out to be true if the number of polymorphic loci being analyzed is small. However, if thousands of loci are used individuals can accurately be categorized into populations, and as more and more loci are used the probability of finding two individuals in the same population who are genetically more dissimilar than two individuals from different populations quickly approaches zero.\n\n\nWhat, if anything, has been the consensus response from mainstream sociology and race constructivism to this paper? In my view, this work seems to cast some doubt on the notion that race is purely a social construct, and not in some ways biological. I would love to hear other peoples' views on this. Thank you!\n",

Unwin studied 80 primitive tribes and 6 known civilizations through 5,000 years of history and found a positive correlation between the cultural achievement of a people and the sexual restraint they observe.\nAccording to Unwin, after a nation becomes prosperous it becomes increasingly liberal with regard to sexual morality and as a result loses it cohesion, its impetus and its purpose. The process, says the author, is irreversible:\n\"The whole of human history does not contain a single instance of a group becoming civilized unless it has been absolutely monogamous, nor is there any example of a group retaining its culture after it has adopted less rigorous customs.\"\n\nDid the book age well? \n\nIs there any up to date research on the relationship between sexual customs and culture that validate or invalidate this thesis?",

And now I'm facing a puzzle, that I can't get out of my head.\nI came across this quote from Elderidge Cleaver’s autobiaography:\n“Every time I embrace a black woman I’m embracing slavery, and when I put my arms around a white woman, well, I’m hugging freedom”.\nI'm neither Black, nor American, but it occured to me that this way of thinking was quite common in the past.\nAnd here’s the quote by Ellen Holly on why she married a White man:\n“When Harry Belafonte picks me out of his bed in Philadelphia and said: ‘I don’t want you to take me seriously because no Black woman can do anything for me’. I could not help him to progress into where he was going to. ‘A Black woman would hold a black man back’, that’s what he told me. If I wanted wanted to marry a Black man there wasn't one because White girls had them.”\nUnlike her male counterparts she didn’t seek out White men on purpose, to upgrade her social status. Yet it seems she was heavily judged by men like Belafonte for marrying a White men.\n\nAnother example is that we see a lot of bitterness in men of minority background, who can’t get themselves a White girlfriend. But there are rarely minority women who complain about the lack of attraction from White men. And minority men who are in relationship with White women often resent minority women for being in relationship with White men.\n(There are more examples of this behaviour, but I try to limit them because, well, my English skills are limited too).\nSo here are the questions.\nMay it be that women strive to upgrade their own group, while men strive to get accepted into the established group of power? (I used to think that women preferred to improve their status through vertical mobility).\nAre men more prone to inferiority complex? Is there any research on that?\n",
