        "text": "UK citizen here - I was listening to BBC radio (which I usually trust), and they were interviewing Richard Kemp, a retired British Army officer who commanded the British forces in Afghanistan.\n\nHe was talking with some authority about the current geo-politiking that's going on, and said, almost off-handedly, that Russia ultimately want to avoid a war [with the US] that they have no hope of winning.\n\nIt was said so matter-of-factually that it caught me off guard. I seem to have developed a belief that Russia, a superpower, pose a significant military threat to not only the US, but the combined \"West\". However, upon looking further, the US's defence budget of $600BN is ten times Russia's, which is roughly equivalent with the UK's ($50-60BN).\n\nIs this the prime reason for Kemp's statement? Why would Russia, a superpower, stand \"no chance\"? Would a war with Russia really be that one-sided?\n\nI'm curious as to your thoughts on this.\n\nThanks.\n\nEDIT: Spelling",

On a macro level, where it's the broader society that is influenced, those who \"break boundaries,\" are celebrated. It is so odd to me the term can be used almost exclusively as positive on one level and almost exclusively as negative on another. \n\nAs far as I can see the descriptor is exclusively used in a positive manner when describing someone who changed broad social norms or institutions. Often it's used without any level of reflection or evaluation. If the term is being used to describe influence on the culture, you can pretty much assume the writer thinks the broken boundary deserved to be broken. It is practically a cliche when describing someone's impact on culture positively. \n\nI rarely see the phrase \"he broke boundaries\" to describe a spree killer. It just seems to be taken unquestioningly for granted that breaking boundaries on a macro social level is good and doing it on a personal level is bad. I don't get it.",

Moderators. We need more of them. As it stands we have three moderators in this sub and all the credit for keeping it together goes to /u/Feyle and /u/Anomander. They have been your dutiful mods since 2013 and without them this subreddit may well have turned out very different. Honourable mention to /u/exoendo who left us a month ago but was equally diligent in their mod duties.\n\n2. Your feedback on the state of the subreddit. I want your opinions on anything and everything that comes to mind pertaining to /r/TrueAskReddit. I at least would like to hear what you think about the quality of the submissions and comments as well as the rules in the sidebar and if they need updating. Though if you can think of anything else you'd like to say about the subreddit now is your time, all suggestions for improvements welcome!\n\nI hope you are all well and look forward to seeing what the community has to say.\n\n***\n\n**If you would like to be considered as a mod you can apply via the [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FTrueAskReddit)**. This isn't a default subreddit and the workload isn't staggering so if you are not experienced with moderating reddit that isn't necessarily a drawback. Though experience is a plus, mods are promoted primarily on character. What sort of redditor they are and what contributions they've made to the subreddit will be the main things considered.",

And I wonder if maybe by following that we are setting ourselves up to be in mediocre relationships because we were too afraid to just be ourselves in the first place? \n\nI mean, if being yourself means someone perceives you as being \"too eager\" what if they aren't the right person for you? \n\nWhat if the rejection is actually a blessing because it just helps you cross out the ones who aren't a right fit and match up to the ones who are - the one who will love to hear your stories or loudness on the first date. The one who won't be intimidated by your You-ness. \n\nThe one you don't have to tone yourself done for? \n\nMaybe instead of changing ourselves we should just learn how to be ourselves.",

The world let's say 30 years ago was quite not like these days, and in 2050 it will be much more dramatically different from now. Probably we just cannot think about then with minds of today. Neither we can make life plans for such far future. Taking this into view, is it really worth planning really long term financial security, employment and retirement? \n\n\nEfforts of excessive working now to save money for survival at retirement can be nullified in turbulent technological singularity with universal basic income and more abundant resources... or the daily financial struggle and \"a new iPhone every year\" pace is here to stay for the rest of our lives?",

        "text": "I used to think averbally often, especially when it comes to solving problems. What I mean by \"thinking averbally\" is hard to explain, but it's reaching a conclusion without formulating thoughts, just shooting from one abstract solution construct to the next.\n\nThing is, I never trusted my results without doing a second round of putting everything into words and going through the steps one at a time. At least in cases where the result can be checked against a known correct result, the first pass turned out true (or the same as the inner monologue) and was much quicker, but I never managed to trust it. \n\nApart from snap decisions and reactions, I have since stopped the averbal thinking and always word out my thoughts from the start.\n\nWhen I'm alone I even like to think out loud, talking to myself. I tend not to lose focus or my train of thought as easily as with the inner monologue that way.\n\nAnyway, I thought this was normal until the subject came up while talking to a friend and he remarked something to the effect of \"You word out your thoughts? No wonder you talk so slowly / take so long to respond / to make a decision.\".\n\nSo, years later this popped up in my head again and I wanted to ask the internet: How do you think? Is the inner monologue, or the \"flash thinking\" the norm? Or something else entirely? Maybe you think in pictures?\n\nCurious to see how Reddit thinks.",

There seems to be little recourse for people intentionally misleading their audience.\n\nHow is there no certification that someone is a certified journalist similar to a licensed physician, nurse, pharmacist, etc. that is enforced. \n\nI should be able to pull up an article and see if the author is an accredited journalist. If not, I could easily take the contents of said article with a grain of salt. If they are certified, I can trust that they write to a set standard and if they are writing editorials or think pieces, it is clearly demarcated. \n\nWhat am I missing here?",
