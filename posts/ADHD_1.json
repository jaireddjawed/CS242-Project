I was on vyvanse or concerta from 12 years old to 17 and it made me very anxious, so I don’t want to try stimulants again. I recently picked up my last prescription at the pharmacy so I have 30 days to find a new drug. I have tried generic Atomoxetine but it does not work the same (if at all) compared to Strattera. Strattera has been a god send, it works so well for me I don’t know I’m going to do :(. I’m really upset their discontinuing it. Do you guys know of any similar drugs I can try? My doctor is suggesting I try Intuniv next, does anyone have experience with that? \n\nI work a white collar job and my ADHD is pretty severe, going raw with no drugs will likely not work out for me.\n\nPlease help!!!",

I'm particularly happy with this one.\n\nThe idea is this: instead of blocking out an amount of time to do something, get a beverage and commit to doing the task for the duration that it takes to finish the drink.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDetails:\n\n\\- Let yourself \"cheat\" by chugging or sipping. The impulsive side gets to feel like it's getting away with something while the responsible side can relax knowing that getting started is the hardest part. Nothing feels too daunting when you can literally see the end and know exactly how to get there. Often I'll start something, just sip my drink, and get more done than I would have guessed possible. Also don't beat yourself up over chugging down the drink because you find the thing truly miserable. I've found that allowing myself a way out is important. Again, just making yourself start something is the point. \n\n\\- If in hindsight, the responsible side of you is still upset with slow progress, increasing beverage volume is always an option. Eventually chugging x amount of fluid will be more painful than just doing the thing. \n\n\\- This strategy can also can be used to limit more pleasurable activities... I'll play this game or browse social media for just as long as this drink lasts. Again let yourself \"cheat\" by sipping your drink or ignoring it for a bit, and then let yourself get mad at yourself for cheating and chug a bit of it. Adjust volume/beverage choice with experimentation....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's it, hope it helps someone out there",

I'm also  extremely sensitive to what other people said about me, and sometimes I feel like ending this all by committing suicide. Sometimes I even think, what would I be like if my family is gone. I wanted to seek for help but I was scared to tell my parents that I have these kind of thoughts. I tried to focus on learning new things so these thoughts don't pop up, but I can't because I don't know how to start and where to start. I'm working as a server where I feel extremely stressed everyday, but I can't stop working because I'm in debt from personal line of credits and student loan. I want to learn new stuff such as engineering, comp sci, game theory...etc that im kind of interested and I want a job in that field.

FYI I'm currently getting reestablished to see a dr, and trying to see someone about what I'm pretty sure is inattentive adhd with depression/anxiety comorbidities. Not diagnosed yet, never go to the doctors. M36.\n\nSo I'd describe the mental exhaustion like this:\nImagine you're standing on a cliff face. There's an indent in the cliff where you can put half the length of your feet in to be able to stand and keep from falling. But you can't rely on that because the cliff face moves outward higher up. To the point that the cliff at head height is actually further out than the lip you're standing on, and the only thing keeping you from falling back away from the cliff is a thin string barely able to hold your weight. If you let go of the  string you fall, if you slip, the string will break. The mental exhaustion is like the physical exhaustion from this situation, knowing that a wrong move in any way will make you fall. Not knowing or seeing any other option than to just hang on for life.\n\nJust wondering if any of you feel this way, and maybe what you do to give some relief to the exaustion.",

        "text": "I started on Vivanse about 5 weeks ago. The first 2 weeks I got SO much done, felt super motivated and then as time went on I found that there slowly became more negatives than positive effects from it. \n\nI wasn’t sleeping at all (like a weird broken half sleep where I always felt like a zombie unless I took the drug), began to hate the gym, my empathy and libido completely disappeared and I started getting these extreme crashes about 4 hrs after taking it that would be debilitating most of the time. I was stuck in a cycle of taking Vivanse to wake up and feel productive and taking valdoxin to fall asleep from the Vivanse. It was horrible. \n\nFast forward a few days later, I’ve decided to give my meds a break as it just wasn’t worth the low quality of life it was causing me. I’m really struggling to feel motivated to do ANYTHING and just want to eat all day and have nothing to do with my business. \n\nIf you’ve ever taken a break from your medication - how long was it until you had a normal level of motivation back? I don’t want to do what the doctors keep telling me to do which is “up your dose!”.",

For context, I am about to start the most significant job in my career in a competitive environment, and my fear about what others think of me has the potential to cripple my performance; I have a very significant fear that people will talk badly about me behind my back because of things I said or faux pax’s I may have made. I am afraid people will have hostile feelings toward me and attempt to undermine my career. \n\nAlthough this may sound more in paranoia than in social anxiety, I can tell this is an outgrowth of run-of-the-mill fears I have when interacting with people in normal social circles. (The fact that my everyday life will be spent around colleagues just amplifies it.)\n\nIf you do not have specific resources but just life experience in this area, I am equally happy to hear your thoughts.",

        "text": "I've recently been able to actually express some of the negative effects of ADHD specifically concerning anxiety. I'm curious if this is common to some of y'alls experience or not and if so what the hell do I even do with this new understanding. \n\nSomething that I've seen on here fairly often and that I've understood for a long time is the sentiment \"I don't trust my brain\". There's even a post on this subs front page titled \"I hate my brain\". This way of thinking naturally leads to a lot of uncertainty about the future. Now, obviously there are myriad reasons to be uncertain about what is to come but typically (neurotypically?) they are external. Am I going to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and get hit by a vehicle, shot, fall, etc? Will the economy tank and put me out of a job? nuclear war? Worries about lots of things out of my control that I think I've come to have a fairly healthy relationship towards. Intrusive thoughts that I acknowledge for what they are and then move past. \n\nTechnically not trusting my own brain because of this disorder and the effects that can't be *completely* eliminated through treatment should fall into that same category of \"out of my control\" but that's where part two of this comes in.  \nAnd that is the idea that, overdiagnosed or not, tons of people believe that it is. So whether I consciously agree with that sentiment or not there is part of my brain that still says \"hey what if you don't have ADHD, what if you've been making excuses and lying to yourself for years?\". \n\nI can't fit my brain into that category even though intellectually I know that it belongs there. At the end of the day it *feels* different to the rest because this feeling of having a lack of control is about my own brain, the thing I'm using to even ponder this in the first place. \n\nI feel like a timebomb and eventually something thing WILL go wrong and blow everything up. Or one of those rocking bamboo water features you see in traditional japanese gardens (Shishi-odoshi) and mistakes or whatever will eventually reach a critical point where I lose everything and have to start again from nothing.\n\nObviously there's frustration and fear involved but even more than anything like that, I'm tired. And not like I didn't get enough sleep because I get at least 8 hours almost every night. But like in a broader sense that's the only way I can really think to describe it. I'm tired. I'm just so tired and I don't know \n\nEverytime something goes wrong the first thing I have to figure out is \"was that ADHD or some other shortcoming. Because at the end of the day someone with ADHD can still be lazy or stubborn or pridefull or have literally any other personal flaw and it's just so exhausting. But the moment I stop asking that question I either have to deny that ADHD is a real thing or attribute everything to adhd and become a shitty person who takes no responsibility for things that I really should. \n\nHave any of you felt something similar? If so, and I'm kind of scared to ask this, how do you manage these thoughts and feelings? \n\nTL;DR I don't trust my own brain and I don't know how to frame these thoughts in a way that doesn't give me anxiety.",

I know this is an emerging area of study and that hundreds of factors go into this etc. but still find it interesting non-the-less. I think someday they might have a better way of diagnosing people accurately and much more quickly than they have been able to in the past.

For the first time in school, I'm now commiting to high quality work and study, but I can't do it, because my mind just bounces off of the work.\n\nI'm a very mellow sort of person and my academic record is great, which isn't the typical pattern psychiatrists will expect from someone with ADHD. So I'm a little anxious about not being considered because of biases.\n\nI've always been a great student, but I never studied much. I've had only As (with one B often added into the mix) all throughout my first 8 years, but studying consistently was still hard. This developed into a kind of complex, where I thought myself more intelligent than the rest. I wanted to be the smartest person in the room at all times, and a diligent worker at that. In my private life, I never could focus on any skills, ending up thinking about all the great stuff I could be doing, but never commiting. And so I envied my friends who were better at trivial things like drawing, building in minecraft, etc. I eventually got into competetive gaming at around 13, but after 450 h played, I was no better than my beginner friends. (Likely because I could not concentrate on the happenings.)\n\nI was very aware at this and so got into productivity, also at around 13. I tried very hard, many times, but always failed. During all this, my social skills degraded more and more because I was trying so hard to beat my brain and achieve my intellectual goals, which never got anywhere.\n\nWhen I have a project someone asks me to take part in, like a vacation, I can't make myself care enough to plan anything ahead. My room is very messy, even though I hate disorder. I avoid writing e-mails for job applications I need for weeks. I don't message my friends first, and when I do, I can't focus on them. I feel terrible about this, but I just can't seem to be able to change it.\n\nMany people with ADHD say they are great at problem solving, but I'm terrible at it. I now go to a technical school where I study programming, and I'm atrocious. Even though I know the syntax and the theory better than anybody else, and I get about the same amount of practice. My head just bounces off the problems and I end up debugging endlessly, not really looking for a solution.\n\nAre there any clues in this that make clear that I have a medical problem? Or am I maybe just wanting too much? Are these problems anyone has? Do I have a different problem?",

        "text": "Hi folks,\n\nso I was diagnosed in my late 20s. At the time, I thought it'll change my life and it will make me happier, more succesful and so on.\nIn a way, the diagnosis actually did change my life for the better. I was promoted, I earn quite a bit more money than before, the job is so damn chill. But goddamn, it cost me so much emotionally.\nHonestly?\nI lost so so many people in such a short amount of time, but not because of me or my own behavioural patterns. Bit by bit, I started to see (or rather: consciously recognize) the true colors of many people in my life. Not in a silly, wrong or paranoid way, but rationally.\nLike... Omg, I suddenly saw the manipulative behaviours of some of my best friends, playing on my fears and so on, holding me back, not supporting me but rather keeping me down just to feel better about themselves.\nMaking fun of me about negative aspects of my life, but never congratulating me about the good stuff, you know?\n\nEven worse, I recognized the same behavioural patterns in my own bloodline, my own family, most notably in my mother. Somehow I never recognized that whenever she and I met, she said something negative to me. It could be something about my haircut, the \"messy\" way I was dressed or my beard... I'm not kidding, instead of hugging me or asking me how I felt like any mom would, she said something like \"Oh god, who cut your hair?!\" or something alike.\nAt this point, I am well aware that this goes way deeper than ADHD and says a lot about my mom and her own issues, but goddamn... I doubt I ever would have noticed without Ritalin.\n\nIt's like... of course I recognize the progress and that this is something positive. It WILL affect the quality of my interpersonal relationships positively in the long run.\nFor god's sake, tho, I yelled at my mom last time and told her to shut the f*** up and asked her whether she'd like if I asked how much weight she gained, why she didn't ask me how I felt like any other person would and if she recognizes the negative way she speaks to me all the time...\nShe and I - we didn't talk all that much anymore that night. No call since, no message, but... I know I'm right.\nThe really sad bit is: it's not just my family, not only my mom. It's my best friend which I've known since I'm a little boy, a few other friends I've known for years and a bunch of colleagues I truly considered to be close.\nI'm not asking for advice on how to view the behaviour of those people, I really, REALLY am convinced that they're full of sh*t and I think that I recognized thanks to medication.\nThere is probably a really simple, logical background to this. People who suffer from ADHD are prone to experience RSD, rejection sensitive dysphoria, and I think that's exactly it: I used to be extremely afraid of rejection and thus remained silent whenever somebody made fun of me or treated me badly. You know, I didn't want to lose them, no matter how shitty they treated me...\nBut the truth is, now in my mid 30s, I realized that many people in my life are just shitty, psychologically weak people that abuse those close to them for their own sanity and it makes me feel SICK, lonely and depressed.\n\nI actually don't struggle with the ladies and I can make people laugh easily. I never really struggled to make friends and when I want to, I can spend a night out with people and have a few circles I'm in, but deep down I feel lonelier than I ever did and don't feel like I can bond like I used to.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this after being diagnosed as an adult?",

        "text": "Hi everyone, I am recently diagnosed and I'm considering taking medication, specifically Ritalin (that's what my doctor wants to try me on, if I can get my blood pressure down a little bit). \n\nMy biggest issue is that I feel like I don't have enough time to do anything. Anything at all. It feels like I can't make room for even the things that I enjoy, let alone the things that I need to do for basic survival. \n\nIt's lead to years of me not doing things that I need to do for myself such as focusing on my health and my fitness. I've heard that medication can help you focus better and be more productive, but I'm just really wondering if it will also make me feel like I just have more time.\n\nI'm also Autistic and in full time employment, so if I'm not working I'm pretty much too exhausted or socially spent out on energy that could go towards hobbies or interests. I'm also trying to maintain a social life and spend time with my family. I feel like I'm constantly running out of time and I'm not able to do everything that I want to do, no matter the timescale or how big or small my commitments are. Part of me worries that if I start taking medication, I'll just have more things to do and the motivation to do them, but I still won't mentally have enough time to enjoy myself or feel like I'll doing the \"correct\" thing\n\nI've mentioned it already but I'm also concerned about my health and fitness. I know that I need to exercise and eat healthy, but I just can't seem to find the time or motivation. I'm hoping that medication will help me focus on my health and fitness goals and make me feel like I have more time to take care of myself, but I can't even start it until I get my BP down a bit. The lock downs made me much more sedentary and whilst they were great for my brain, it's been pretty bad on my weight and lifestyle.\n\nHas anyone else experienced a change in their perspective of time on medication? I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences. Thank you!",

He would not let me try a different stimulant or put me on blood pressure medication or an A2 agonist to go along with it, or reduced my starting dose.\n\nHe then prescribed me Straterra, that also was causing mild chest pain and a high heart rate, so I was taken off it.\n\nNow my last option according to him is Clonidine, I suggested taking a blood pressure medication with a stimulant or with Straterra, as I have seen some psychiatrists do for people who have experienced the same as me on reddit, but he says it wouldn’t work because of different half lives, even though there would be some that have the same ones.\n\nI am going to give Clonidine a try, but if it doesn’t work, is it worth changing psychiatrists?

Ever since I started my first dose around 4 months ago, I’ve had no issues with them.\n\nI recently spoke to my doctor about the side effects I’ve been having and she suggested a booster dose. So I was currently at 25mg, so she bumped me to 30 mg of Adderall XR and wanted me to take one in the morning and one six hours later. So overall it was a 60 pill 30 mg Adderall XR prescription. \n\nMy prescription was due today but it said that it hadn’t gone through due to an insurance issue so I called to ask what was going on and the pharmacist was not the kindest. \n\nShe first of all told me FIVE times in a 6 minute phone call that I would have to start seeing a doctor in person by May to keep getting my prescription. ( The prescription was through a telehealth company. ) And I have no issue doing that, and even told her that I have plans to but she still continued to tell me over and over again that I would have to do that by May. Then she told me that they couldn’t fill my prescription because one, they don’t have it, fine okay, but also because my insurance would not cover a double dose. \n\nMy only confusion here is that my little brother is on the exact same insurance plan and has the exact same prescription and my mom has never had an issue with insurance covering his prescription. The only reason I could think this would be an issue is because he’s a minor and I’m not? \n\nShe then made comments about how she didn’t understand how my dose was so high. She made comments about how I had gone from 25mg to 60mg and how it didn’t make any sense. I didn’t bother explaining that it was a booster dose because I already felt bad. I felt like a drug addict. Idk has anyone else had this happen to them? Especially with the insurance thing? Thank you guys.",

I have absolutely no control over when I’m going to be capable of working. I’m not exaggerating when I use the word “capable”. Apart from those short spans of time, I’m literally left unable to do *anything* that I don’t want. Which includes productivity related to work and education, and also household chores. \n\nWhat makes it worse is that I’m an introvert going through a slump. Being around people exhausts me to a point where I have physical symptoms of exhaustion. This makes being productive as a person that has ADHD, nearly impossible. \n\nI’ll get the motivation to do something, and if I’m interrupted by someone, it’ll just drain me completely, so that I never end up going back to that task. Then I’ll get the nagging feeling of “task still pending!!” repeatedly in my head. The worst case of this was when I put a very important task concerning a lot of money, off *for a while year* because I didn’t want to deal with those people and I just couldn’t physically write that email or sign that paperwork. I felt so ashamed and irresponsible. \n\nWith work, if I don’t feel equipped to do something, but still have to, because the team has that planned as per everyone’s schedules and requirements, it feels like a circle of hell. Them demanding me to do something (which is their right, because I’m supposed to put in that work) and being all around me just chips away at whatever little effort I manage to conjure. I’m always left dissatisfied with my work, and I get extremely agitated. Lately it has gotten to a point where I’ve started making excuses. I hate being this way because I used to be ambitious. I used to want to do well. \n\nAt home, (we have multiple members) if someone else is, say, doing their laundry, for instance, at the exact moment *I* feel like doing my laundry, and I don’t have the washing machine at my disposal, I’ll just not do it until I feel like it. Which is… who knows when. It sucks because I hate bad smells and I can only and only wear clean clothes with specific textures (sensory issues. sigh). At the same time, I can’t arrange for a “schedule” because my family just isn’t like that, and talking to them about any mental illness basically leads to 3-4 hour lectures about “meditation”, “listening to motivational speakers”, “taking the power back from your mind”, etc. I can’t sit through one of those again. \n\nI feel like I’m locked in a nightmare. Do any of you also face similar issues? If yes, how do you deal with them?",

I want to apologize to everyone who I told it was not a problem in my area (Phoenix AZ). The tech I talked to earlier told me that they will get a stock of it in and be out that day. She said that I should be fine since I have been getting the name brand stuff. Also it was so great to talk to a tech who was so understanding about the issue- I've had much different responses before when trying to inquire if I would be able to pick up my meds.\n\nHOWEVER\n\nI have noticed the efficacy of my meds has decreased considerably since December-ish. No clue if it has anything to do with the formulation or what (it's the name brand so it shouldn't change at all, right?), but I've gained over 20 pounds within the past few months. My weight had been steady for 10 years. No clue if this is from med issues or something else but I have talked to several people who had a similar issue. I had to buy all new clothes because of this :( Again, I don't want to claim that it's because there's some f\\*ckery with the meds, but I fall asleep if I don't get up and moving after I take them and I used to get insomnia if I would take it after noon. My ability to do a lot of basic things, let alone my job, has been awful. It could be a tolerance issue, a me issue, maybe a thyroid issue but I know something is wrong. The meds are better than nothing, but I wonder if I would should try something else. \n\nI am not a doctor, pharmacist or insurance expert, but maybe if people could have their doctor to send in an Rx for the name brand stuff they might be able to pick it up if they have the money. Good Rx has worked for some people to get a considerable discount but I understand that $100 for a month supply of meds is not feasible for a lot of us, myself included.",

I think it's related to my adhd but I haven't talked about it with my psychiatrist. Thoughts? Similar experiences?",

        "text": "My biggest difficulty with ADHD is trying to overcome the stranglehold that it has on me throughout the day. I feel like my brain's default is to procrastinate and cling on to the relative comfort that I feel in the moment(it's kind of like ADHD paralysis). The only success I've had in the past is when the rational part of me is able to break out of that tight grip and overcome my default.\nSo what I'm looking for are any tips/apps/devices that can help me break free. Alarmy has been a terrific app, because I literally can't stop my alarm until I complete a task. This helps with my morning routine, but it's not really a viable solution for an office or public spaces. What are your thoughts?",
