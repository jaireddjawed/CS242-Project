So I wanted to ask what are some of the most unusual or memorable conversations you've had with strangers?\n\nFor me, one conversation that stands out is when I was on a bus and I sat next to an old lady who told me her whole life story. She was born in another country, survived a war, immigrated to the US, raised five children, worked as a nurse, traveled the world, and wrote a book. She also gave me some advice on how to live a happy and meaningful life.",

I don’t know why, but I started to think about the past and I realised that one of the things I miss is the old internet. I even miss MSN Messenger, I miss all the different forums and I even remembered that I even met some of the members in real life through those forums. I mentioned on one thread that I’m going to see Limp Bizkit and some girl replied:”Me too, let’s meet up!” and then another time on a Papa Roach Fanclub forum I met like 8 different people at once in real life, just because we knew we’ll go to the same show. I don’t know. It felt so much better than reddit and every forum was different and I don’t get the same vibe on reddit and there really aren’t any alternatives to reddit. Thanks to reddit even the forums in my home country have died out.\nA lot of people have said that the old internet was slow, but I don’t remember it being slow. I even remember back in 2000 - 2004 my internet was pretty decent and I didn’t have to wait pages to load nor I had to wait for a long time for Limewire to download my music and movies. (In my defence,iTunes store wasn’t available in my country and I lived in a small village). I’ve even been thinking that MSN Live Messenger worked better than Microsoft Teams does and a lot of things were just better. I don’t remember websites really being ugly either. I was honestly really impressed by some of these. I remember Linkin Park’s website was so cool and later Fort Minor’s site was the most beautiful thing ever and I also remember that some of the forum’s were more customisable than Reddit and you could choose dark theme etc. I miss fanclubs, different forums, people’s websites and blogs. I even miss GameTrailers etc and I have better memories of the old internet. I feel like something’s missing these days and sites like Reddit and YouTube have too much power and have killed many sites and forums. Same goes for Facebook. Even some of the companies don’t have a website anymore,just a Facebook page, which you can’t see because you don’t have Facebook.\n\nDoes anybody else know what I mean or I’m all alone on that one?",

But don't worry, I'm fully aware of how ridiculous it is to be writing to a ghost of a friend that I haven't met yet. I mean, let's be real, I'm just a guy, sitting in front of a computer, asking it to love him.\n\nAnyway, I just want to put this out there, to the universe or whatever cosmic forces are out there, that one day we're going to be best friends. Right now we're strangers, but one day we'll be be inseparable and get through thick and thin, and sharing stories about our Halloween costumes through the years. We will live our lives without a care in the world. Something we didn't think we could ever do again. Dancing in the rain, piggy back rides on walks around the lake, just everything that brings us that spark of joy life has taken from us far too often.\n\nI can't wait to get to know you, but for now, let me introduce myself. I'm a 33-year-old with three cats, way too many amazing life stories, and a lot of love to give. It's funny because we both are super quick to trust people and \"fall too hard, too fast,\" but it's those traits that jumpstart this friendship.\n\nWe don't need small talk or any awkward stages. We just clicked. And it was amazing!\n\nYou will never stopped being amazed at just how many turns life has brought my way and just how I went from a minor league baseball prospect to going to school to possibly be a s\\*x therapist to getting a degree in business only to create art and become an artificial intelligence engineer.\n\nI hope you're out there living your best life right now. Maybe you're on a camping trip with friends, or on a cute date with someone special. Or maybe you're just binge-watching Netflix in your pajamas, and that's totally fine too. I can't wait to hear all about your adventures, no matter how big or small.\n\nAnd when we finally do meet, we're going to have so much fun together. We'll decorate our cute little houses with pumpkins in the fall and Christmas lights in the winter (but let's be real, we'll probably leave them up until February). We'll have deep conversations without devolving into arguments, and we'll always stand up for what we believe in.\n\nSo, if you're out there reading this, let's make a pact to become the best of friends. I promise to bring the humor and personality, and I hope you'll do the same. Can't wait to meet you!",

He does well in producing movies. Their child is lovely. \nAnd it goes on and on with each cousin. \nI think they're all incredible.

My ex is a textbook narcissist who cared only about himself and refused to wish me on my previous bday which hurt so much. My bday is coming up in a few weeks, and I’m taking that week off. It’s also a special one, as the age I’m turning matches the number of my\nbirth date day. I’ve tried hard to get at least 1 friend to travel with me, not just for the bday reason but because we haven’t traveled together yet. They’re both busy or don’t have vacation days.\n\nShould I ask one of my closest friends from school that I haven’t talked to in a while but still visit (vice versa)? There’s also a local friend I don’t know as well but maybe she’d be open to it. How can I lift the mental pressure and intensity that I’m placing on this calendar date? Is it better for my mental health to celebrate with friends locally and do some solo R&amp;R the day of? Why am I so affected by this? It’s a whirlwind of trying to make up for how my ex treated me, feeling like I’m getting old, and wanting to make the most of the time especially such a rare event. Any advice or suggestions?

        "text": "I (22f) have been forced to quit more than halfway to my Bachelor's Degree in Clinical Lab Science. I had been so looking forward to getting started in my career. I had an internship already lined up, I was successfully getting into all of the classes I needed, I was well and truly ahead of the game and ready to go.\n\nI found out that, due to medical reasons, I wouldn't be able to move forward. Not only in my current career path, but I probably won't be able to work in the medical field in any capacity like I wanted to.\n\nIt was incredibly upsetting, all the work and time I put in gone to waste. And it was discouraging because I had been looking forward to working in a science lab for so many years. I didn't know where to go from there. I didn't have a job as I was a full time student, and all I had were my savings from when I DID have a part-time job, which I didn't want to blow through. But I didn't let myself feel stuck for too long. I figured out a new career path and it so perfectly fits my circumstances and I'm really excited to get started. \n\nI'm taking a leap of faith and starting my journey as a freelance copyeditor and proofreader. Nearly every bit of free time I had as a student was spent reading all kinds of different stories. My friends and family knew I was a big reader so they often had me read over and correct their college or work papers. I thought, why not make something out of it? So I purchased an online course, completed it and got my certificate, practiced and practiced and practiced... and I found my first client. Granted, it was another family member and I do it for free for them since they're really just helping me hone my skills, but still. I now know for sure that I enjoy the work and I'm good at it. I also got a testimonial from a business where a friend works, which I did some free editing for!\n\nI've since created a website for my business, set up an account on LinkedIn, and made an official business page on Facebook. There's so many freelance editors out there that it's so competitive but it just feels really good to have a sense of direction after that giant loss of what I thought was my \"set in stone\" career in CLS. I'm trying not to get discouraged by a lack of clients but I'm just starting out so it's to be expected. But I'm still really excited to get started and to ***hopefully*** see my business take off.",

I love that I like to get really into fun video games, a deep movie, or a good book, diving so deep that I'll think a lot about both the themes of the media as well as admire the craft. I love that I've suddenly gotten so interested in Paleontology even though I have no degree or education in the field. I love that I can enjoy the little pleasures of life like a cold brew(beer or 'bucha!), the warm sun, or a walk through the mall so much that they can make my afternoon. I love that I can push through and try at things like my job, exercise, or practicing music even if I don't like to do them. Even typing this, I realize that this post is such a small window into who I am and I never give myself enough credit for that.\n\n\nI'm often really, really hard on myself for not being someone that I'm not, and I think my mind and body are both starting to feel it. I keep judging myself based on goalposts that I don't even WANT. Of *course* I feel bad because I judge myself based on a template that *I* don't even desire. I just want to be me!\n\n\nAnyway that's my caffeine/stimulation rant about how I think I love myself. How're you all?",

Jack passed away suddenly, leaving Carla alone and heartbroken.\n\nCarla struggled to cope with her grief and found herself feeling lost without Jack. She couldn't shake the feeling that she had lost a part of herself, and it was a struggle just to get out of bed each day.\n\nAs time passed, Carla began to realize that Jack would want her to live a full and happy life. She remembered how he always encouraged her to pursue her dreams and never give up.\n\nWith Jack's memory as her inspiration, Carla found the strength to start moving forward. She pursued her passions and made new friends, but she never forgot the love she shared with Jack.\n\nNow, Carla wants to honor Jack's memory by encouraging others to live their lives to the fullest. She started a foundation in his name to help people struggling with grief and loss find the same hope and healing she did.\n\nIf you're struggling with loss, know that you're not alone. Reach out to someone you trust, and don't be afraid to ask for help. Together, we can support each other and find the strength to keep going.",

Recently, I've been struggling with feeling sluggish and lethargic, and I'm starting to think that it might be due to a slow metabolism. Have any of you ever tried a metabolic reset diet? What was your experience like?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo be honest, I never really thought about my metabolism until I noticed how much harder it was for me to lose weight compared to my friends. One time, I was at a party, and my friends were joking about how they could eat whatever they wanted and never gain weight. Meanwhile, I felt like I was stuck in a rut and struggling to make any progress. It was a really frustrating feeling, and I started to wonder if something was wrong with me. That's when I began researching ways to give my metabolism a boost.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been doing some research on metabolic reset diets, and I'm really interested in giving it a try. However, I'm a little nervous because I'm not sure what to expect. Have any of you tried this type of diet before? If so, what was your experience like? Did it work for you? I would love to hear your tips and advice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm also open to other ways to give my metabolism a metabolic boost. If anyone has any tips or tricks that have worked for them, I would love to hear about them. I know there's no magic solution, but any guidance or help would be greatly appreciated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really hope to find some support and advice from the Reddit community. Making positive changes in my life is really important to me, and I think that giving my metabolism a boost could be a great way to start. If anyone else is in the same boat as me and is looking to boost their metabolism, please share your experiences! Let's support each other and make positive changes together.",

        "text": "For context, I work in a city with a huge housing crisis and I have spent almost 1 year looking for a 1 person apartment closer to work. Before, I was living in another town and commuting everyday which was taking a huge toll on me.\n\nFinally last week I reached an agreement with this lady. I had seen the apartment back in Christmas, but I wasn't interested back then due to the price. We finally got in touch again and she offered me a better price, which I agreed to. We set some conditions on text, and she told me the apartment would be ready \"next Friday\". She also said she wants rent paid in cash.\n\nI work nights so I asked if I could go there Friday morning right after work, but she works Friday morning then so she said maybe leave till Saturday. OK.\n\nOn Friday evening I texted her confirming I would go the next morning, to which she replies that she was hoping to meet afternoon/evening since she still needs to clean, paint, move furniture etc.\n\nThis was shocking because not only did she not warn me, the flat was supposed to be ready the day before? but OK, I say let's meet Sunday instead because I cannot meet that late in the day. I work nights and so I need to sleep during the day.\n\nSunday morning I'm on my way to meet her and I receive a text - the door is open and keys inside the door, we can meet in the afternoon and I'll take your deposit and rent. This is strange but at least I have the keys now. I just want to pay her rent and get it over with because I don't like carrying a lot of cash around.\n\nIn the afternoon she still didn't show up - I ask for a specific time and she said they just went for food and we can meet later or tomorrow. I say fine, I'll just go back to my old apartment tonight and bring more of my things and meet tomorrow at lunchtime.\n\nSo here we are today, it's already late in the afternoon on Monday, been here since 1pm when I texted here saying I'm here. She hasn't replied, I hear her next door sometimes (oh yeah, my apartment is attached to her house btw). \n\nI don't know what to do, how am I gonna pay cash in rent every month to someone so flaky? We cannot agree on a time to meet and finish a simple transaction. Plus we have completely different schedules. I like this apartment though and I am tired of looking for one, but I wonder if this is gonna become an issue in the long run.\n\nHas any of you dealt with something similar?",

However since last week I'm getting no emails, no one really needs help with anything so I'm just writing a procedure that I'm pretty sure no one will use, just because I don't know what else to do.\n\nI messaged my supervisor telling her to let me know if she had any tasks for me since all my projects were wrapped up and she just replied with a thumbs up.

I still wanted to see if HE was having a bad day, despite having just brake checked me, tried running me off the road, etc. I still wanted to reach out. \n\nHow can I stop caring so much about others and try to worry about myself for a change? It’s clearly ruining my mental health and I’m getting sick of no return for the amount I do for others.",

That seemed to unblock something in me, since I always struggle with healthy habits, accomplishing that was big(and I lost 6kg in the process that was the reason why I've started).\n\nSo I think that made a click on me, and I've been waking up at 6.30 AM every day for the last 10 weekdays(during weekends I relax a bit).\n\nIt's a big win for me since I'm happy to add 2 hours to my life. 🤞that I manage to do this for a long long time.",

        "text": "I had an especially stressful week at work last week, and on Friday night I re-downloaded Candy Crush after having played it for a while 8+ years ago when it first came out. \n\nIt was ridiculously satisfying to play. It felt soothing and relaxing, which was so nice after a week of having my thoughts constantly circling around work. I kept playing on/off throughout Saturday, trying to limit myself by not buying more lives when I ran out (I think you have a reserve of 3 or 5 that replenish with time, but you can buy more with gold you collect in the game).\n\nNow, my partner kept seeing me play and wanted to try, and absolutely loved it. What ensued was that we kept alternating with who was allowed to play Candy Crush for a good part of Saturday and Sunday t (he didn't want to download it to his own phone as to not play it too much, and kept begging for my phone so that he could play \"just one or two levels\"). \n\nThe scary part is that it feels like the game genuinely changed us as people. My partner seemed to not notice anything around him as long as he was playing, and both of us kept buying more and more lives because we didn't want to stop playing, even though I don't know if it was even fun at some point. We also started bickering about who would get to play to a point of actual pettiness (we don't usually fight much). It was ridiculous. \n\nIt got to Sunday night, and in the middle of another fight about who was allowed to use my phone, I said I was just going to delete the whole app to end this, which I thankfully did. Afterwards, we both realised how ridiculous it was to be so engrossed in such a pointless game app and to spend our entire weekend fighting about who gets to destroy fictional candy. It's almost a bit scary how much we wanted to be constantly playing it. \n\nJust wanted to share this odd experience. Weird how addictive a simple mobile game can be.",
