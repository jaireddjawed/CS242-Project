I am assuming it relates to the process that the meat industry uses, but what is this process and what makes it worse for the environment than the alternative? \n\nI’m not looking for a debate on the health benefits/cons of each diet or anything of that sort. I’m solely curious on the proven facts regarding each diet’s impact on the environment, good and bad! \n\nTIA :)",

        "text": "I feel like I need to explain my question because I understand the concept of a stock share. buying a stock you now have “ownership” of a portion of the company. The stock itself has a value it can be sold or bought at that is determined by supply and demand and how much people are willing to pay. With owning stock you get voting rights in what the company does.   \n\n\nMy question is where does the value come in to play here if the stock doesn’t pay dividend? The stock holder does not get any portion of the actual company earnings, and only actually makes money if they sell it to someone who’s willing to buy.   \n\n\nUnlike other investments like real estate for example, there actually is no value provided to the holder except the fiat value behind it. How is this any different than cryptocurrency for example?",
