Or just go with recall and validate your answer based on what is in your head?\n* Etc etc",

Unfortunately making the deck myself isn't helping me learn the words so the SRS isn't working. I can never recall anything the 1st time they appear and I still can't the next time it shows up. I'm also really struggling to make mnemonics since sounds are so different. \n\nI've heard there are filtered decks in Anki that let me use it more like Quizlet but I found them really convoluted and a huge hassle. \n\nDoes anyone have any recommendations? I'd like to use Anki since I have so much control, especially over the audio which can be batch generated, but I'm not finding it effective.

        "text": "I think new language learners have a tendency to just 'jump into it,' with the idea that you'll make progress no matter what you do. I think this is a *huge problem* and leads people to waste hundreds of hours with no progress towards their goals. This is because short term language learning resources and long term language learning resources *directly* conflict with each other.\n\nWhat's the first thing people think about when learning a new language? If you live where I am in the US, it's probably Duolingo. I think this is fabulous, because it's accessible and can show you some basic phrases and vocabulary. If you're going to Japan for travel and want some basic phrases down, this is a great resource. The problem lies in people thinking they can extrapolate this progress they see with apps like Duolingo in the short term to achieve a long term goal of proficiency. They think that if they complete the whole course on Duolingo, they're going to be able to read simple novels with relative ease. Yeah, not happening. \n\nOn the flipside, if you ask about starting language learning on this subreddit, the first thing people will do is recommend immersion. Although I'm a huge proponent of immersion and have seen incredible progress in multiple languages (including English, which I learned through YouTube before moving to the US), I think this idea that everyone should use immersion is disingenuous. Frankly, most people don't have the time or motivation to learn a language through immersion. They have a spur of the moment interest that won't last more than a month. These people are perfectly valid, and resources exist for these people as well. But if you immerse in Japanese for an hour a day for a month, *you will get nowhere.* If you immerse for an hour a day for a year, *you will get nowhere.* For immersing to be worth it, you should really be spending &gt;3 hours per day with your TL. And even still, realize that it will take *years.* \n\nThis is also why I sympathize with the issue of language learning in schools. People say it sucks, and I kind of agree, but from the perspective of a teacher, they have to be able to demonstrate that a student made progress regardless of how many semesters they learned the language. Typically I think this benefits the short term learners and sabotages the long term ones, but no matter which system they use, someone loses.",

While I don't have the results yet I did pass the practice exam.\n\nBut I digress, often times in job ads they do in fact specify N2 as being \"business level.\" I personally have a hard time believing that it is based on my own abilities and would consider it moreso intermediate-advance maybe, but that's for another discussion.\n\nSome also specify N3 as conversational and N1 as near-native or fluent (again, hard time believing it's near-native but these are the classifications I'm seeing).\n\nReason I'm bringing all this up is because there are job ads that specify business-level Japanese but don't specify a JLPT level. The job ad is entirely in Japanese and I hesitate to apply even if my skills may be a good fit as it sounds more like they're looking for bilingual native speakers and knowing that most Japanese companies don't even know about the JLPT I often just don't apply at all.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/108istg/hellotalk_is_destroying_my_motivation_to_learn/",
        "text": " I'm sure I must be the first person making a post like this, but please bear with me I'll explain everything in a bit.   \n\nI (24 M) had been depressed for about the first half of 2022 due to relationship problems. I went through sooo many negative feelings. When everything was over,  I managed to get some mental rest, and then all of sudden anime came magically into my life. At first I didn't really take it seriously but to cut a long story short, not only did it get me out of my depression but it also gave me unbelievable motivation to get on with my life. Needless to say, my urge to learn Japanese was unmistakable. I got Duolingo, Genki, Kanji Study, Anki and I went at it with everything I had. My only reason for learning Japanese was pure motivation and I even had a solid goal of passing JLPT N4 in December 2023. I enjoyed every single minute of studying Japanese, and now I'm almost N5 level after studying for only 4 months.  \n\nUntil I got started on that HelloTalk app... Disclaimer, this is not to say HelloTalk is not a good app. It is one of the best apps for language exchange and I myself used it 3 years ago for my French (though I was already almost proficient in the language) and it helped me get a lot better. However, I think that in my particular case it has been counter productive with Japanese to say the least. Here's why. \n\nFor starters, not even having 100% completed N5 myself, I think it's fair to say that I rushed wayyy too much to get myself out there to chat with native people. I should have waited until I got a better grasp of vocabulary and especially grammar. It is thanks to Google translate that I manage to get by with most of my conversations in Japanese (by filtering stuff of course). But that's not even the problem.   \n\nThe problem part is that by talking with Japanese people I want so bad to be there and live it up in Japan. And I know that I can't go to Japan to meet them anytime soon, not even as a tourist. And even though I knew that right from the start and it didn't stop me from learning Japanese, interacting with all those people made me long for more... that I can't have. As a result, my motivation is going downhill and I have even started to have tendencies to roll back to my depression. At this point I'm even questioning whether I should be learning Japanese at all. I do find learning the language enjoyable, more than any other I have learned but after a certain point it just feels like building myself a pair of gorgeous wings but never actually getting to fly with them. \n\nThe worst part is that I have been ghosted by a couple of girls after having talked with them for a solid month. That really was the final fatal blow, because I find it nearly impossible to form any form of friendship with Japanese people from such an app. I know every Japanese person is different as an individual and that I should not generalize, but the blunt truth is this. I had an immense source of motivation and I destroyed it all on my own by downloading a damn app.  \n\nMaybe I shouldn't have started using this app. Maybe I would have been better off just staying in that anime bubble. At least I would have managed to keep my motivation intact. Or maybe I'm just being paranoid... I don't know anymore. I'm just looking sooo bad for a way to get my motivation back on track.  \n\nSorry if the post is too long, I just needed to sit down and write all this. I know all of this probably doesn't even make sense to most of you but it's just the way I feel. If anyone has any experience that is even remotely close to mine I would love to have any feedback.

I have about 3-4 years before I would be starting my studies in an university, and I was wondering if it would realistically be possible to learn good enough japanese in that time so I could go study there. If so, how? I have the possibility to take japanese courses from the local university, so I think that would be helpful at least. \n\nThanks in advance for any tips!",

And at this point, I've already gone through every grammar point and example sentence at least 5 times by now, so I was just wondering if there is something else that's better to do so it doesn't get too repetitive. The thing I like about Renshuu though, is that you have these tests where you need to use the correct grammar point in an example sentence, or structure the sentence properly. I like this because you get a chance to find it if you really do understand how the grammar works and you didn't just read about how it worked without any confirmation. But Renshuu doesn't seem to have the most detailed explanations for grammar points. but maybe I could just go to something like Imabi for more details, or perhaps some monolingual source on the grammar?\n\nSo, TLDR: what is the best way to study grammar?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/107y31y/as_tone_deaf_i_started_learning_pitch_accent/",
        "text": "So earlier today I dropped by the kotu website and took two of their pitch accent tests along with a friend. We did the same thing together last year but my friend does not study Japanese (anymore), while I do. She didn't know anything about pitch accent and I read a little about it around January 2022 but couldn't hear it. Here are the results:\n\n**2022 (Feb?)**\n\n*Minimal pairs* \\- Me: \\~40/100, Friend: \\~50/100.\n\nThis test gives you (if I'm not mistaken) any type of word and you are provided with 2 options. This means that my friend was exactly 50/50'ing it, but I was somehow even worse than had I selected an option at random without even listening to the recording.\n\n**2023 Jan**\n\n*Words + Particles* \\- Me: 50/50, Friend: 25/53.\n\n*2 Mora Words* \\- Friend: 33/50.\n\n*Sentences* \\- Me: 12/13.\n\nI only listened to each recording once from speakers at medium volume, but my friend really struggled without any restrictions. Then we tried to even out the difference by me listening to sentences and my friend to 2-syllable words (again, as many listens as she likes). Even as an untrained person she was able to get two-thirds of it but as barely above picking at random (there are two options), it's a long way from being able to catch words, let alone full sentences.\n\nNow, this last part was amusing because for some reason the audio for sentences wasn't playing, but I got the full 12 sentences right because I already knew what it was supposed to sound like (they write sentences in kanji but the lone words are in hiragana, so you can't know for sure which word it's supposed to be and have to use your listening). \n\nI got the word 異性 wrong on the 13th one. The strange thing is that my dictionary says it's flat (which is what I selected) but the test said the first syllable is accented. I played it on Google Translate and it's also accented that way (or I've gone insane). Maybe both are used, but I'll stick with Google's because although I've seen many errors (or at least variations) in dictionaries, I cannot recall hearing Google pronounce something wrong, amazingly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My initial level**\n\nWe can see from the original test that I couldn't hear the difference in pitch if my life depended on it. Actually, I used to take singing lessons and I could never tell if I was in tune with the singer. I always depended on my instructor to tell me if I needed to go higher or lower.\n\nI could tell if individual notes she played on the piano were higher or lower than each other, but if she played multiple notes I would get confused. However, the most important point is that the more complicated the 'instrument' became, (say, a violin) and eventually when it came to voices, there was too much going on for me to understand. \n\nI would get confused by the timbre of the singer (or 'quality'), and a syllable stressed always sounded higher to me even if it was only the volume that was increasing, not the pitch. (P.S. I eventually quit singing partly because I felt hopeless).\n\n**How I studied**\n\nI initially studied how I'm *supposed* to accent something, but I quickly realised I couldn't hear it nonetheless. After I found that test and faced complete defeat, I decided to train my ear there. I started from two syllables, doing around 100 each day. Every time I reached around 95% accuracy, I would go to the next difficulty. I stopped after words with particles because the website is kind of poorly designed for sentences. It probably took me a couple of weeks to get to 90% accuracy on all words (now it's almost 100% on any sentence).\n\nAlongside that, I started to use the 10ten reader to check the pitch accent of every word I encountered. This made my reading *extremely* slow. I spent about 2 months reading like I didn't know kanji because it completely bottlenecked my speed. I tried to separate my time reading as general practice vs for pitch accent but I found that I actually couldn't stand the idea that I was reading something wrong and felt the need to keep looking everything up.\n\nWhen I could more or less hear the pitch of words and memorised a fair percentage of them, I started to learn the actual rules. If you don't know, the pitch of words in a sentence is not necessarily the same as when in isolation.\n\nI would often listen to the pitch of words I hear e.g. in anime, try to guess the accent and then check. Sometimes to my delight I would get it right, many times to my dismay I was reminded how long the way ahead still was.\n\nOne of my favourite tools was a website that lets you insert any sentence and it uses artificial intelligence to make a graph of the pitch. Its advantage over typing it into Google Translate is that you can learn the accent even if you can't completely hear it yet. This probably helped me the most in understanding the various rules in sentences.\n\n**Do I still study pitch accent?**\n\nThe basic answer is no. I can't give you an exact date as it was a continuum, but around the second half of 2022 I stopped studying the accent specifically. The main reasons are that,\n\n1) I already know the accent of most words in my vocabulary, so I only really need to look up the accent of new words.\n\n2) If I hear those new words (e.g. in an anime, or talking to a friend) then I almost always catch the accent correctly and don't need to look it up.\n\n3) I have learned it to the point that even while reading something, I read it with the correct pitch in my head (as demonstrated by that last test).\n\n4) If I say something wrong then hear the correct way, I generally notice and correct myself.\n\n**How I feel about dialects**\n\nMy friends that are not from the east still use standard accent so... *shrugs.* That being said, when someone has an accent I immediately recognise the difference. It's possible to tell someone has a dialect from what they say or their 'rhythm,' but I found that just by hearing a single word I can immediately tell from the accent they use on it.\n\nI feel like if I continue hearing dialects long enough I'll be able to tell where someone is from just from the pitch accent they use.\n\n**Was it worth it?**\n\nDefinitely. I find it amusing how I didn't even know how little I knew before actually learning pitch accent. It has reinforced my appreciation of the language.\n\nLearning it was a little bit like learning kanji. At first, it made everything so slow and I had to break sentences apart and analyze them. But learning the main parts of pitch accent makes it so that I just naturally improve by listening, much like I now don't really study kanji per se but occasionally learn new ones by just reading. Kanji improved my reading comprehension just like accent my listening comprehension. Of course, learning kanji takes way longer than accent but both involve a lot of frustration and struggle along the way.\n\nContrary to popular belief, learning the accent isn't just memorising (and training your ear). Once you learn it to a certain point, you start to get a feel for the *flow* of sentences and it makes speaking and listening much easier and enjoyable. It gives you a sort of consistency in how you speak, and in how you recognise words. I love Japanese even more now. Not to mention the effects it has had on my listening in general, including music. \n\nAnd yes, it does make learning the Chinese tones that much easier.",

About every sentence there’re one or two words I need to look up with jisho.org, and sometimes I put the whole sentence into a translator when I’m struggling with the overall meaning. \n\nThis system mostly works for me, but the amount of back and forth between book and website is annoying. The most annoying thing is when I don’t know the reading for a kanji. I currently use the Google Translator app’s scan feature to look up the kanji. This is consistent but is very fiddly and breaks the flow of reading. \n\nBasically I feel my system is working but I find it a pain in the ass, so would appreciate any ideas or just to hear what other people around my level do.

It’s an immersion deck with the focus on being able to get into slice of life type content as fast as possible I can learn way more new words by just the kana/voiced reading (pretty easily 40+ words a day) but if it’s brute forcing the kanji with reading/writing/understanding I can do way way way fewer and it’s a LOT more difficult as someone with 0 exposure to kanji before.",
