        "text": "I'm curious about where, how long ago, and why ancient humans got the notion that gods (or eventually, a God) wanted sacrifices, whether they be plants, animals, or human beings. By definition, a god would be all powerful, but why would that god demand the destruction of something precious as appeasement for some anger?\n\nI don't subscribe to the idea that ancient cultures were necessarily \"primitive\" in an intellectual sense, so I don't see belief that a god wants a sacrifice as a primitive idea. This is supported by the fact that people still believe it today. (!) If your god loves you, why would that god want you to kill something? Your human father wouldn't ask you to kill your puppy to prove your love, right? (Ok, I'm digressing...) This is a complicated question posed in a space the size of a matchbook cover--hehe. Any thoughts on this? Any books that might help me understand this better? Many thanks.",

Is this debunked, well-studied, or just a parallel to Atlantis? I find it interesting that it's a remote possibility, and would partially explain the language isolate that is sumerian.\n\nAnyone got anything more substantial on this?",

However, that is part of my concern here - I need a good overview of the topic to get my bearings. FYI, this isn't for school or anything...this is a general curiosity I have. \n\nLike, for example, is there a mechanism that can explain how different Christian sub-groups compete for \"real\" Christian identity? How about what qualifies as a \"real\" Dallas Cowboys fan? Or how a heirarchy of group membership is established between two Harry Potter fans? \n\nAny general overview reading suggestions would be appreciated :)\n\nThanks. ",

It actually hasn't been very long since ethnic communities were a bigger thing in America (only a few generations), will these distinct features not be as distinct in the future as we get farther from the point were there were ethnic communities?

What does it entail to purchase a new mobile phone - which rare earth metals are being used, how much climatic gasses are released, and what does all of this do to our mind and way of thinking?\n\nI have no choice but to think of modern society as utterly mad. I am full of sorrow that we have brought this madness to other parts of the world. To me, the world isn't a place of progress (not any longer), but of regression. I am not a pessimist, but once one becomes oriented about this day and age, one soon realizes that the problems we have created are of a massive scale - of which our mode of thought is the biggest issue. We are never content it would seem. That is not to say humans are evil, but we sure do have room for improvement.\n\nWhat is your opinion?\n\n",

I want to know this, as the Scottish Ethnic Group was formed by an Irish Kingdom of Western Scotland which sent many Irish migrants there, eventually the Irish and Native Pictish mixed together creating the Scottish Gaelic ethnicity we know today. \nAlso the Romanichal Gypsy group of England was formed when Ethnic Romani arrived in England and did some mixing with the local English population, eventually this made the Romani appear White, and it also made the Romani language into Anglormani, which is a creole language. \n\nAnyway, what is it called when two Ethnic Groups combine together to make new one?",

I want to know more about this line of thought.\n\nOne of my high school students brought this up in my English class's discussions earlier today. I'm from a diverse community in a northern state, originally, but I now teach in a predominantly-white (with a growing population of other demographics) city in north Texas.\n\nI stopped the discussion because, while points like this are not-infrequently touched on (and discussed civilly in my class, surprisingly enough), some of the language being used (\"thug\" was a trigger word) bordered on overtly racist. Nobody was upset that I stopped the discussion before anything went off-the-rails, and I am genuinely interested where ideas like these originate from.\n\nThe idea, in a nutshell, was that modern-day African American culture is largely media-propagated (via news, fictional characters, books, what-have-you) and that popular/familiar images/characterizations of African Americans \"as thugs\" (this was where I stopped the discussion) have been \"manufactured\" and perpetuated by white people. They (**EDIT:** an African-American student, fwiw) argued that the appeal of violent male characters appealed to young men who see them as role models.\n\nI'm not sure about where any real inklings of truth are in these statements, but before it ended, some of it seemed to make sense to me (a 30-something white guy) based on my limited knowledge and experience(/the lack thereof).\n\nI'm familiar with things like the offensive and inaccurate images perpetuated in, for example, \"blacksploitation\" films popular in the 70s and 80s, which seems to be the one idea that I come back to as I try to wrap my head around this. Is there much truth to the ideas that my student brought up? I'm kind of fascinated; even if it's a kooky conspiracy theory-sounding nonsense, I'd like to know if, say, people think that these ideas and images have been created by a white population to \"mold\" an impressionable young minority population, or something.\n\nEvidence, literature, criticisms, debunkings, anything would be neat to read.\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nI thought it also worth mentioning that in my department (I teach gifted &amp; talented students), there is a lot of discussion lately about the disproportionate number of African-American students enrolled in the program compared to other demographics as these numbers shift in our community. As an example, our city is 9.9% African-American, but among my 149 students, I have just 3 who are. Perhaps the \"image\" of what people traditionally envision a \"gifted\" student to be, is in opposition of the images that my student brought up as influential to a younger African American population, and thus \"gifted\" African American students go unidentified as a result?",

I read that the Indo-Iranians pushed the Dravidians into the South.\n\nAccording the the internet, Indo-Iranians identified as being Aryan, or Arya (Different from the Nordic \"Aryans\") and that they encompass the modern day lands of Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Northern India. Anyway, Indo-Iranian is considered Indo-European, whilst Dravidian is not, providing proof that Aryans were outside invaders. Also, another piece of supposed evidence that the Aryans are invaders is that their skin tone is much lighter, with Pakistanis and Punjabis have much lighter skin than Tamils and Sri Lankans. \n\nI have also read on the internet that the Aryan invasion theory is false. Apparently the British made it up to stop the Indians from trusting each other and uniting under a common force, allowing the British to keep control over India. Also, apparently the reason Indo-Aryans speak Indo-European languages and have Indo-European culture is due to them adopting it. Also apparently the reason North Indians and Pakistanis have light skin and South Indians and Sri Lankans have dark skin is to do with adaptation, and not due to North Indians being descended from Aryan invaders.\n\nWhat theory is correct?

The first is climate: that the same changing conditions which made it possible for humans to move into those spaces also led to the extinction of resident megafauna. The main problem I have heard with this theory is that we can often see these species managed to survive through multiple prior climate changes and recover. The second is that humans moved into these spaces, found these populations of megafauna that were already displaced by climate change, and hunted them into extinction.\n\nMy thought was that when a new predator enters an existing ecosystem, it may disrupt an established predator, or even wipe it out, even though the two species of predator may have little direct interaction. That an ecosystem can only support a small number of predatory species, and if one thrives it will often be at the expense of another: a zero sum game.\n\nMy question is, do we have a model of how migrating humans may have impacted existing ecosystems that is more nuanced than, \"We hunted them all to extinction?\" Could they have caused extinction events more by reshaping their environment to suit their purposes (via planting and burn-offs) than by literally hunting megafauna to extinction?\n\nAlternatively, is the climate model so widely supported that we don't seriously consider human agency in these extinctions anymore?",

Historically, lion hunts were done by individuals, however, due to reduced lion populations, lion hunts done solo are discouraged by elders. Most hunts are now partaken by groups of 10 warriors. Group hunting, known in Maasai as olamayio, gives the lion population a chance to grow. However, in Kenya, where this practice is illegal, olamayio may be used as a reason for retaliatory killing against lions suspected of killing livestock.[7] Maasai customary laws prohibit killing a sick or infirm lion. The killing of lionesses is also prohibited unless provoked.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion_hunting#Maasai_lion_hunting\n\n\nThe Maasai used spears to kill lions.   A spear with a razor-sharp metal head forged with modern technology is a highly lethal weapon.  A spear with a wood tip fire hardened or some crude metal tip forged 400 years ago is far less so.\n\nWhat exact spear technology did the Maasai have to undertake this daunting task?\n\n&gt;\"Historically, lion hunts were done by individuals...The killing of lionesses is also prohibited unless provoked.\"\n\nWhat success does a lone warrior with a simple wooden spear have against a male lion?  Male lions commonly weigh 350-400 pounds.  Some males exceed 500 pounds.   I will not expound on the ferocity of lions.  Even a 200-pound female lion is a formidable target.\n\nEdited to add:  A more detailed source.  Still wonder about verification.\n\nhttp://www.maasai-association.org/lion.html",

So, for example, they started out as hunter gatherers, then pastoralists, then agriculturalists, then “civilization” (whatever that means), then sweatpants and smartphones. And this had a kind of myth of progress to it, where the later stages are superior to the former. \n\nI watched a series on anthropology from the great courses and that just exploded all these ideas I had. Societies are too diverse and varied to fit into any idea of progress. Few other cultures developed in the way western societies have, so it has nothing to do with upward movement. We don’t know what hunter gatherers were like before the dawn of writing. I can’t list all the reasons wrong with this narrative. \n\nBut one idea still sticks in my mind and I’m wondering if it’s bad. Typically, if someone said “well contraceptives are unnatural” or “meat eating is unnatural”, I’d probably say “Well small scale societies, very different cultures, they also have these practices, so they’re not alien to human nature.” The point being it’s not like some evil moustache twirling villian invented some cultural practice and then my culture spread it around, perverting everyone. The idea being in occurs independent of our influence.\n\nIs this a bad type of argument? I know the notion that anything is natural is kind of loaded but I hope my point still sticks. ",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnthropology/comments/7s3jvg/frazers_names_of_the_dead_tabooedany_basis_in/",
        "text": "So just for fun I read *The Golden Bough* last year (the abridgment, I'm not that crazy) and while I do not have any illusions about the accuracy of its conclusions I do assume that Frazer's examples are at least based on something observed by someone, no matter how badly understood.  But one section in particular seemed so bananas that it is very difficult for me to believe it at all.  This is where he claims that in some cultures speaking the names of the dead is avoided, but because those names are common words for things like \"Fire\" and \"Water\" the words for those things are changed.  The chapter is [here](http://www.bartleby.com/196/57.html) but let me quote the most relevant part:\n\n&gt;Further, when the name of the deceased happens to be that of some common object, such as an animal, or plant, or fire, or water, it is sometimes considered necessary to drop that word in ordinary speech and replace it by another. A custom of this sort, it is plain, may easily be a potent agent of change in language; for where it prevails to any considerable extent many words must constantly become obsolete and new ones spring up. And this tendency has been remarked by observers who have recorded the custom in Australia, America, and elsewhere. For example, with regard to the Australian aborigines it has been noted that “the dialects change with almost every tribe. Some tribes name their children after natural objects; and when the person so named dies, the word is never again mentioned; another word has therefore to be invented for the object after which the child was called.” The writer gives as an instance the case of a man whose name Karla signified “fire”; when Karla died, a new word for fire had to be introduced. “Hence,” adds the writer, “the language is always changing.” Again, in the Encounter Bay tribe of South Australia, if a man of the name of Ngnke, which means “water,” were to die, the whole tribe would be obliged to use some other word to express water for a considerable time after his decease. The writer who records this custom surmises that it may explain the presence of a number of synonyms in the language of the tribe. This conjecture is confirmed by what we know of some Victorian tribes whose speech comprised a regular set of synonyms to be used instead of the common terms by all members of a tribe in times of mourning. For instance, if a man called Waa ( “crow”) departed this life, during the period of mourning for him nobody might call a crow a waa; everybody had to speak of the bird as a narrapart. When a person who rejoiced in the title of Ringtail Opossum (weearn) had gone the way of all flesh, his sorrowing relations and the tribe at large were bound for a time to refer to ringtail opossums by the more sonorous name of manuungkuurt. If the community were plunged in grief for the loss of a respected female who bore the honourable name of Turkey Bustard, the proper name for turkey bustards, which was barrim barrim, went out, and tillit tilliitsh came in. And so mutatis mutandis with the names of Black Cockatoo, Grey Duck, Gigantic Crane, Kangaroo, Eagle, Dingo, and the rest.\n\nIs any of this for real?  Was it just some missionaries totally misunderstanding the cultures they were in?  I find it hard to imagine how people can have a language at all where this goes on.  There is no necessity behind this question but the consistent feeling of \"WTF am I reading?\" during this section, which even the craziest stuff about Japanese emperors' every tiny movement being totally prescribed by ritual and places where they lock the girls up in a tiny wooden hut for ten years after puberty, etc etc, did not create in me.  I mean I doubt literally everything in Frazer without some outside source, but this part was another world of implausible.",

Basically, for my third-year dissertation, I'd like to look into how the digital technologies we use influence the way we think and vice versa. If you have read literature on any of the below questions or that you think would be relevant please let me know what it is. It's super vague at the moment but here are some of the first questions I've thought of.\n\nIs digital tech made in a way reflective of the human mind?\n\nIs the human mind formed into something which mirrors how digital interfaces function through our frequent interactions with them?\n\nHow does digital technology change the way groups of people behaviour and think?\n\nWhen changes in behaviour are caused by digital infrastructures, do patterns exist for these changes follow?\n\nIs digital space as real as physical space? Who should hold power in the digital sphere? Should we use digital spaces to test how ideological interactions react before bringing the positive reactions into the physical world?\n\nAre humans becoming cyborgs? \n\nThrough our interaction with purposefully created digital parameters of behaviour, can we progress humans into a form of being that displays consciously selected for ways of existing? \n\nEngineers create software with purpose and an idea of what we want to happen when it's used. The software we interact with must alter our perceptions of things. Therefore, over time as we interact with software we end up changed. \n\nI'm also trying to think about how a discussion of blockchains potential to change the human experience regarding trust could be incorporated but I think this is still a bit premature. It's this angle which I think is the most exciting because blockchain has so many uses, all of which have come from one person seeing a problem and converting it's solution into something using blockchain which I think is awesome.

As a layman, my guess is that \"hazing\" is a way of accepting someone as a member of your \"in-group\"\n\nThere are many African tribes that practice ritual circumcision of boys and girls, sometimes as teenagers, which can leave quite a memory. Another example, [there is a tribe in Papau New Guinea, where boys are regularly forced to give adult men fellatio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etoro_people)\n\nIt seems this is all a way of saying \"I got hurt and turned out fine, so you should get hurt too if you want to be with us\"\n\nAm I wrong?

        "text": "Recent developments on the Nova Scotia Oak Island mystery has a TV that has paid for some scientific testing that confirmed old reports and found some new things. Is this now a legitimate area for study by archaeologists? In the past, archaeologists dismissed most of these findings because the people involved in the dig had a financial interest to claim they had found artifacts in the money pit area. However, recent findings have confirmed old findings for the following: human bones, pottery, paper on parchment and book binding all from what is believed to be below searcher depths (160 - 200 feet below ground) so it seems unlikely that this sort of evidence couldn't have been planted as was previously claimed by some archaeologists who have claimed this isn't a worthy area of investigation. Results confirmed with electron microscope and DNA testings. The bones were of European or Middle Eastern ancestry from the mid 1600 to mid 1700s. Other interesting observations about the island are that the Oak Trees that the island was named after are not native to Nova Scotia, there have been a number of unusual stone carvings found above ground and wooden works have been found buried on the island on a large number of occasions. Some previous archaeologists claimed the old wooden works were just buried wood but that claim has also been disproven. Archaeologists also have correctly pointed out there is no compelling evidence for flood tunnels, treasure or even prior diggings. The stuff found below the surface could be from natural underground cavities linked to the sea that may have drifted in from an old ship wreck (for example). It still could be that the current group of investigators and the prior independent investigators could have planted all of this evidence but this seems very unlikely as some of it was filmed being dug out of the ground. Also, some things could have been left behind by previous diggers (e.g., an old graveyard fell into a searcher tunnel and was buried below). However, this is highly implausible for findings from 200 feet. It's pretty clear that no one dug down that deep before due to issues with flooding the digging shafts. I'm looking forward to your thoughts about this.",

What sort of jobs are there? And also is it true that most anthro majors get a masters instead of just a bachelors? Thanks ",

        "text": "I'm a historian of medieval heresy and inquisition. I am currently writing about how modern historians (since 1850) treat the subject of 'medieval heresy and heretics'. There is a striking feature of these historians' works: an unreflective, constant use of the vocabulary of disease like contagion, spreading, infecting, etc. Effectively this is a critique of ideology and paradigms conveyed in language which ultimately shapes our understanding. This is a fairly elementary observation. However I'd like to get a theoretical perspective on this from the field of anthropology, which I imagine has dealt a lot with how ideology embedded in vocabulary shapes the experience and observations of anthropologists. Can anyone recommend texts? \n\nI'm open to works in English and French.\n\nThanks in advance.\n",
