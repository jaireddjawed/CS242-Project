I go to sleep at reasonable times, depending on when I have to work the next day. I have tried different sounds to wake me, different alarm times, and I still wake up an hour and a half after I'm supposed to be at work with my adrenaline level at 11 until I calm myself down after I get to work. I did order a dedicated alarm clock to be delivered in a few days.\n\nAny tips that could possibly help me in this situation are greatly welcomed and extremely appreciated!!",

I use earmuffs rated 27 dB because that's the highest I could find with a form factor that is similar to headphones and not stupidly bulky.\n\nIf you also listen to music while working, try headphones inside earmuffs! Some earmuffs come with built-in audio. I use wired headphones (EarPods) and the wires don't break the seal. Be careful though because some headphones can get jammed into your ears depending on the shape. If the music is helping to block out noise, you might be able to lower the volume and save your ears.\n\nAnother option for passive noise cancelling is in-ear monitors like the ones drummers use (although it can be hard to get a good seal and you may need to keep replacing the tips). Or try earplugs in addition to earmuffs.",

When working on in house DIY projects the asbestos dust can linger in your house for quite a while and/or contaminate your house. There are no safe or acceptable levels of asbestos and all forms are carcinogenic. Please care for your help and don't make the same mistake as I did. Getting material tested is cheap and quick. The 5 days waiting on the test result is worth it.\n\nHad the scare of my life when I removed my old toilet tiles (ceramic) as I only ever heard of asbestos contain vinyl floor tiles. I grinded away the old tile thinset which later I discovered that could be asbestos containing material. The grinding created alot of dust and could've potentially exposed myself to alot of asbestos fibers, but also contaminated my complete house and all of its contents.

By reducing stomach acid, these drugs reduce or even effectively eliminate absorption of Vitamin B12 from food.\n\nB12 deficiency causes low energy, exhaustion, poor mood, and is implicated in clinical depression and PCOS. The medical literature suggests that we’re just beginning to learn about the broad negative impacts of B12 deficiency. \n\nLow stomach acid does not interfere with supplement absorption, so if you take an acid reducer, take B12. \n\nUse caution as some B12 supplements also contain B6, which can accumulate and cause adverse neurological conditions.",
