        "text": "Fair warning I absolutely love *National Treasure*. It's combination of early American history and puzzle solving hits the sweet spot for me. In this review I'm going to ignore the elephant in the room and talk about all the other stuff going on, because there's still plenty of bad history to talk about even if we ignore the whole Templars bringing over shiploads of gold to America plotline. \n\n*National Treasure* opens up with young Benjamin Franklin Gates rummaging around his attic and discovering some papers, whereupon his grandfather tells him a tale of a treasure and a map. \n\n**01:44** \"It was 1832, on a night much like this\" (I just realized that the writers of *National Treasure* managed to start the movie off with the equivalent of \"It was a dark and stormy night\")\n\n**2:00**--Carroll *was* the last surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence. However, he actually wasn't a delegate to the Continental Congress while the discussion about Independence was going on, and in fact wasn't named a delegate until *after* independence had been voted on and approved. He took his place in the sessions starting August 2, but was allowed to sign the document, as were the other new delegates (there were several men who weren't delegates when the vote was cast who's names are on the Declaration). \n\n**2:05**--However there's absolutely no indication at all that he was a mason, though his son was (and he was also named Charles). Also the Freemasons aren't exactly a \"secret society\"\n\n**2:55**--Despite the numerous times I've watched this movie I never realized until now that they were [blinding us](http://i.imgur.com/4eNoV4H.jpg) with propaganda. \n\n**3:20**--It didn't reappear until more than a thousand years later. This was the time of the first Crusades. \n\n**3:02**--[These guys](http://i.imgur.com/25qODgQ.jpg) make an appearance, which would put this event sometime between 100 B.C.E. and 100 A.D.? They have the stereotypical \"Roman\" look which makes it's appearance about this time, which is also about the time that Rome was busy conquering Judea. For reference [here's](http://i.imgur.com/28MmViS.jpg) what a Roman from that time period might have looked like. They've at least got the right shape to the armor. \n\n**3:23**--The [Templars](http://i.imgur.com/Ah57Eaj.jpg) show up!\n\n* Wearing uniforms of the Knights Templar before they were even organized. Apparently they had access to Edward's time machine. I am happy to see that they're wearing mail and not plate armor--that much is correct. \n\n* White mantle was assigned as a uniform in 1129, the red cross at the beginning of the Second Crusade 1147, or almost 50 years after the First ended.\n\n**3:38**--\"They brought the treasure back to Europe and took the name Knights Templar\". It sure did take them an awful long time to organize. The First Crusade was called in 1096. Jerusalem fell in 1099. The Knights Templar weren't organized until 1120.\n\n\n**3:41**--I think the set designers for National Treasure must have robbed the fantasy store of swords. What in the everlasting fuck is the point of [those crossguards](http://i.imgur.com/ZyrVEwn.jpg)? Also those helmets seem to have come from the fantasy prop department. Again they're wearing mail, which is good, but you can totally tell that it's just an outfit with a mail design on it--basically a grown up version of kid's costume. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/d1eFx7G.jpg) we see the gear that a Templar would have used in 1165. Note the astonishing lack of fantasy swords and helmets. \n\n**3:59**--Not enough going on in [this scene](http://i.imgur.com/NLdBCEk.jpg) to let me really critique though I'd be shocked if they have the uniforms right for either side. However note the wide angle shot. See the stoopid British marching in line formation? See how the Americans aren't in a line, because they didn't fight that way, right? Even in a 5 second clip this myth gets reenforced--never mind that these are Continental Army soldiers who were absolutely trained to do this and fought this way as a matter of course. Oh and never mind that militia were trained to do this as well, and generally did so except in unusual circumstances or where the terrain prevented it. \n\n**4:01**--Freemasons included Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, &amp; Paul Revere. Washington joined the Freemasons as a young man but by the time he was President he hadn't been involved in the organization for decades. Paul Revere *was* an active Freemason as were many of the most influential Whigs in Boston. In fact the planning for the Boston Tea Party took place in the meeting place of the home of the Scottish Rite Masons which met in the Green Dragon Tavern. In 1798 George Washington wrote a letter in which he said this \"The fact is, I preside over none, nor have I been in one more than once or twice, within the last thirty years.\" The letter was in response to claims that Washington ran the lodges in America and that the Freemason lodges were associated with the Iluminati. [This](http://boston1775.blogspot.com/2014/06/george-washington-encounters-illuminati.html) excellent article by J.L. Bell is definitely worth reading.\n\n**4:08**--Since when did the British issue [sawed off shotguns](http://i.imgur.com/BXKzJDc.jpg) to the infantry? At least that's what this weapon appears to be. \n\n**12:25**--[Meershaum Pipe.](http://i.imgur.com/xSrm7Zt.jpg) Looks ivory to me and not handled at all. (Meershaum is actually a type of mineral, not just a decorating style). Used meershaum will become discolored with age, acquiring a reddish or even brown tint, such as [this pipe](http://i.imgur.com/jQAZ5Wr.jpg) from 1791. The cleanness of it might be explained by it being a new pipe, but there are two issues with that. First is that new meershaum pipes tend to be much whiter as in [this example](http://i.imgur.com/Y9f65ai.jpg). The second is that we know that the pipe had to have been handled on a regular basis before it was stashed on the *Charlotte*, because it was used as part of the key to the Templar treasure. \n\n\n**15:25**--[Mr. Matlack](http://i.imgur.com/cZphMCX.jpg) not the official scribe of the Congress. He'd acted as scribe on a handful of documents, but there was no official scribe. We don't know who actually copied the Declaration. It may have been Matlack (he was the one who took the copies down to the printer to have printed and sent out to be read), but we're not 100% sure it was him. Matlack was a powerful figure in Pennsylvania politics--he was certainly too powerful to be the official scribe of the Continental Congress. He did engross George Washington's commission as Commander-in-Chief as well as the First Continental Congress' reply to King George III, but that's not much work for an \"official\" scribe.\n\n**15:42**--It was actually signed by 56 men, not 55 One of the signatures was added much later than the others, which might be what was referred to here, but the Declaration wasn't signed by the other 55 in one sitting, despite what John Trunbull would have us believe. There's some debate about when the signatures were added, though it wasn't all done in one sitting. \n\n**15:59**--\"A document of that importance would ensure the map's survival\". Except that the document *wasn't* regarded as that important when it was written. The act of declaration was more important than the document, which didn't start to become \"American Scripture\" until the 19th century with the rivalry of Adams and Jefferson. (See *American Scripture* by Pauline Maier for more information)\n\nArguing happens. Then guns and flares get pulled and a ship blown up. Then a trip to the office of Dr. Abigail Chase who proceeds to laugh at them. \n\n**23:01**--\"Nice collection of George Washington campaign buttons\". I see you're missing one. \nThere were no such thing as George Washington campaign buttons. There were commerative buttons issued for his inaugration, but there were dozens of different designs issued. [This websight](http://georgewashingtoninauguralbuttons.com/) has many examples of the varying designs, shapes, materials and types of inaugral and commorative George Washington buttons, along with some other military buttons. (Warning--individual pages have background music that you can't disable--it's incredibly annoying). \n\n**23:07**--Also what's up with the [fake writing quills](http://i.imgur.com/jFy9Arv.jpg) and ink stands? Presumably that's what they're supposed to be and not just a random feather stuck in a jar. A standard 18th century quill pen might look more like [these](http://i.imgur.com/1amsR7K.jpg) surviving examples from the late 18th century. Some quills did have longer feathers, but the quills always would have been stiff and feathers stripped on one side, not just a long feather stuck in a random jar.\n\nThey leave and visit the Library of Congress. Then there's a montage of various preparations to steal the Declaration. \n\n**32:23**--Amazingly enough the button that Nic Cage ends up giving away *is* an actual reproduction of a 1789 inaugral button which is known as the \"Pater Patriae\" button. \n\n**37:07**--A toast to high treason. These executions were actually still carried out in the 18th century for crimes of high treason. \n\nNot much else happens until they find the code on the back of the Declaration, which happens at about the mid-point of the movie, so I figure this is a good point to stop part 1 of the review.

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2as7i1/opium_is_safe_and_the_myth_of_a_19th_century_drug/",
        "text": "I've been in a debate about drugs and legalisation here on Reddit. At the risk of violating the rule about no politics, suffice to say there are a lot of interesting historical questions that are brushed over in the haste to say that drug laws are evil incarnate. I admit, I'm not an expert on drug policy, or on 19th century drug culture, but I do know a bit about history, and I suspect that many of the comments I'm running into are a bit...optimistic. \n\nTake [this comment](http://np.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/2anjeh/a_refugee_crisis_not_an_immigration_crisis/cixv9hc), for instance. \n\n&gt; Opiates were \"regulated, consumed, and distributed relatively safely\" in the 1800s in America. There was some addiction, as there is now, but the problems with gangs didn't start until the drug was prohibited.\n\nNow, as I said, I'm not an expert on the history of drugs, but this one stuck out at me. Works like [Confessions of an English Opium-Eater](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confessions_of_an_English_Opium-Eater) describe that a situation that was neither well-regulated nor safe. Indeed, social taboos in the US meant that opium smoking was often done in secret in one's home or in opium dens. This led inevitably to addictions. While the above quote suggests that addiction was rare, in actuality, it did become a problem, especially with the introduction of opium derivatives such as heroine and morphine. In China in 1906, for instance, there were an estimated [16.5 million opium addicts](http://search.proquest.com/docview/304450590), with millions more smoking or consuming more casually. Even before 1906, opium addiction was seen as such a problem that the Qing emperors - Jiaqing and Daoguang especially - took radical steps to try and stop its spread, first banning imports in 1799, then criminalising it in 1810. \n\nBut there's a bit more to be said about China and opium. While opium use in the US did originally come from China, the Chinese emperors saw it as a horrible nasty thing [\"undermining our good customs and morality.\"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_opium_in_China#Growth_of_the_opium_trade) Much of the opium being smuggled into China in the 1800s was coming from British colonies in Bengal and India. For the British, trade in opium was the the only way to obtain the Chinese goods - such as tea - that the British desired. When China responded by destroying British opium, the British declared war. Granted, the causes and motivations behind the First Opium War are a bit more complex than \"they destroyed the opium, let's get 'em,\" but the role of opium and addiction to it in triggering the war cannot be denied. The same is true of the Second Opium War, in which one of the conditions of the Convention of Peking was the legalisation of the opium trade. The British Empire relied on opium until about the turn of the century, and wars were fought to maintain that power. British influence gained through the Opium Wars, too, played a large role in the eventual fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912. This is not to say that opium brought the end of imperial rule in China, but it really didn't help.\n\nMy point with all of this is to emphasise that the legality of opium in Britain and in China didn't mean it was safe in either place. It still caused social unrest (in China) and health problems (in both China and Britain). Nothing about the situation is the ideal that the quote implies.\n\nBut this might be tangential. After all, the quote is talking about America (weaselly little thing, isn't it?). One thing I found was that it's difficult to get numbers for addiction and things like that. What I find is lots of articles about the moral and societal problems relating to opium use, but because these are contemporary, they have to be looked at askance. After all, as [this](https://faculty.unlv.edu/mccorkle/www/Opium,%20Cocaine%20and%20Marijuana%20in%20American%20History.pdf) article points out, prohibition movements had an effect on creating a xenophobia around drugs, first by associating opium with a \"yellow scare,\" then later heroin with black men and marijuana with Hispanics. Even while legal, drugs created societal problems in terms of xenophobia, but also in terms of public health.\n\nCertainly, though, they weren't \"well-regulated\" in the US. As [this article](http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/library/studies/cu/cu1.html) shows, opium was widely available, and only became more available as became distilled into heroin and morphine, as well as with the eventual invention of the hypodermic syringe. Social taboos, as always, also ensured that those who were addicted weren't always necessarily able to get the help they needed. \n\nBut unfortunately, as I said, I'm not an expert on opium in the US or opium in general. What I do know, though, is that saying the 19th century was the place to use drugs safely and openly is not necessarily an accurate summary of the world of opium in the 19th century.",

It's science, yes, but they didn't recognize it as such.\n\nNo, blacksmiths were NOT seen as magicians. They were respected? Yes. Like every craftsman making something people needed. Also, the whole reason blacksmiths were respected was because they made nails, cooking utensils and other things farmers needed to work the land, not because of their swords.\n\n&gt;The mere fact that they had apprentices should say a lot.

So go ahead, start watching, pause at 2:14. See the nice British oppressor? See his jaunty pipe in his mouth, and his cool hat? See that rifle? WRONG! While it does a decent job of getting the generic \"rifle\" look down, they fucked up. You see, [British rifles](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f6/SMLE_Mk_III.jpg) of the time had a rather distinct profile.  The video shows the profile of something roughly equal to a Mauser rifle. Not the unique butt of the SMLE. We'll ignore the idea that they were fighting sword carrying Arabs as well, because they had plenty of guns, usually of the Mauser persuasion. \n\nNow, moving to 2:31, we see that the Jewish people are facing the still incorrectly armed Arabs with revolvers, which appear to be the wicked cool [Model of 1917 US Army revolver in .45acp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1917_revolver). Such beautiful combination of a fine revolver, and the .45 ACP round would not likely be found in Palestein. Instead we would expect to find British arms, such as the Webley (which is equally glorious and worthy of adoration).  We might also expect to find some smuggled European and American arms, but not in such quantity as to find M1917 revolvers in the hand of every soldier. \n\n2:40, the Arabs have early pattern milled receiver AK 47 rifles. Finally, something done right. Unfortunately, it doesn't last long.\n\n2:46, the goddamn Israelis have THE SAME FUCKING ONLY AVAILABLE FROM THE SOVIET UNION AND IT'S MINIONS RIFLES. Now, Israel did capture some AK 47's from the Arabs, and issued them to special forces, so we might give them a pass, but presumably the video shows common infantry, not the elite fighting each other.  Instead, we must look to the [Galil rifle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMI_Galil) which is what happens when Israeli small arms geniuses redesign Kalashnikov's (Peace be unto him) famous weapon, and manage to make it a bit better.  Or prior to the Galil, the [FN  FAL rifle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FN_FAL)\n\nThe rest of the video is grenades and rocket launchers and shit.  But the guns. Totally bad history. I'll let somebody else tear the rest of the video apart.   I'd like to give a shout out to poor /u/tayaravaknin who has been fielding the most annoying and even offensive sorts of questions about the current and past Israeli conflicts. I offer this up as a sort of light hearted way of talking about Israel in light of current events, without, well, focusing on any of the root causes of the conflict. \n\nEDIT: Fixed bad link",

        "text": "I enjoy Disney movies. I know I'm adult and that I'm probably supposed to watch adult things at this point, but I'm just so much happier with a princess and a happy story that wraps up beautifully at the end. That said, though, the adult in me does have trouble not analysing and criticising a film. When I see something that doesn't make sense in the context established by the film, I can't help but stick on it, smacking it and getting sucked in like some perverse historical tar-baby.\n\nSo *Brave.* *Brave* takes place in medieval Scotland, a place of mystery, funny accents, glowing faeries, and bears. It's a happy place, or at least Pixar wants to pretend it is. The trouble with *Brave*, though, is that historically, it makes no sense, at least in some parts. Other parts are completely accurate, leading to this glorious amalgamation of I-don't-know-what-I-think, and me spending more time than is reasonable fretting over this film. \n\nAs an example of what I'm talking about, let's start with [this](http://imgur.com/2Hb8Yzf.jpg) image from early in the film. That's the head of Clan Mackintosh there, riding his boat and yelling stuff about how awesome he is. It's an interesting shot as it's both sometimes really beautifully accurate and really inaccurate at the same time. For instance, the boat? [Accurate](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/dec/08/gaelic-longboat-healing-heritage-scotland). It's called a [birlinn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birlinn), and while this particular design looks a bit fancier than what was [probably used](http://www.conbio.org/images/content_static_pages/IMCC2014_Slider_BirlinnReplica.jpg), I'm willing to forgive that as the clans are trying to impress each other. The birlinn was used until at least the 17th century (or at least, there are Gaellic songs about it being wrecked from the early 17th century), so it seems likely that it would have been in use in whatever time period *Brave* takes place in. The awkward thing about the birlinn, though, is that it was used primarily in the western part of the Scottish Highlands. Remember how I said this guy was from Clan Mackintosh? [It's a real clan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Mackintosh) with a long and illustrious history. They're from the eastern part of the Highlands, near Inverness and Loch Ness. While the birlinn is *historically* accurate, it's not *geographically* accurate. It's likely not something Clan Mackintosh would have been using.\n\nThat's what I mean when I talk about this film being a weird combination of accurate and inaccurate. The tartan? [Accurate, at least in its colours](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Mackintosh#mediaviewer/File:MacKintosh_tartan_(Vestiarium_Scoticum).png). But that particular design of tartan? [Likely not prevalent until the 16th century](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartan#History). [This](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartan#mediaviewer/File:Scottish_soldiers_in_service_of_Gustavus_Adolphus,_1631-cropped-.jpg) is the first known depiction of Scots wearing that style of tartan, and it's from 1631. The argument could be made that this film is taking place around the 17th century, but then the body paint doesn't work (among other things). The body paint is derived from a plant called \"woad,\" and while the Romans noted that the Picts painted themselves, by the 17th century, Scottish soldiers looked like [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/Highland_soldier_1744.jpg). It's decidedly non-blue. Now, that said, this film *could* take place much earlier (after all, there's references to beating back Romans), and the Picts did control land north of the Firth of Forth stretching up to Orkney. However, that all happened before the 11th century, when Clan Mackintosh came into existence. There's no way this shot is historically accurate, regardless of the time period in which the film takes place.\n\nBut that said, we can figure out a little bit about the time period. [This](http://i.imgur.com/w5SjYs7.jpg) is a shot with two of the dresses worn in the film. We can tell a lot about historical periods based on dresses (and on [this](http://i.imgur.com/chi8zLn.jpg) super-grumpy face). The clothing of nobility changed a lot over time, especially based on where queens were coming from. For instance, [here's](http://www.rampantscotland.com/famous/graphics/portrait_gallery_kenneth_maid_of_norway_x4961cf.jpg) a mural of the monarchs of Scotland. Margaret, there in the middle, was a queen during the 11th century. Her clothing matches that of Queen Elinor in the picture up there. It's much more flowing and open than the tight, close-to-the-body clothing of, say, [Yolande de Dreux](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Sceau_de_Yolande_d'Ecosse_-_Duchesse_de_Bretagne.png/220px-Sceau_de_Yolande_d'Ecosse_-_Duchesse_de_Bretagne.png), a Scottish queen from the early 13th century. Merida's dress, though, seems to fit in nicely with clothing from the 13th century, where blue was fashionable and tight dresses were all the rage. The headdress (which I think is a wimple, but I'm not sure) is from a bit earlier, but that's fine. Maybe this castle just isn't hip with the current groove. What doesn't work, though, is [this](http://i.imgur.com/45moNhH.jpg) image from slightly earlier showing Merida being squished into a corset. Corsets weren't introduced until the 16th century, and then from Italy. It wasn't until the 16th century that they were in use across Europe. While Merida's and Elinor's dresses may adhere to various fashions from around the 13th century, corsets once again throw off any attempt to actually place the historical time period of this film. Those dresses and corsets couldn't exist together.\n\nThere is another way to try and place the film in a historical period, though. At one point, the chiefs of the clans talk about how the king united their clans to drive out invaders and form a kingdom. Since we know this has to be a medieval film, I'm going to guess that this is based on the [Chattan Confederation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chattan_Confederation), a group of clans that eventually became a clan in its own right. It's in the right place (near [Loch Arkaig](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loch_Arkaig#mediaviewer/File:Loch_Arkaig.jpg) ), and at the right time period (end of the 13th century). There was even a [war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish%E2%80%93Norwegian_War) between Scotland and Norway (though no one got a kingdom out of it)! So clearly, this film takes place roughly around the 13th century, give or take a few decades.\n\nThis leads to another awkward problem. Meet [Angus](http://i.imgur.com/44x1HSG.jpg). Angus, I'm almost positive, is a [Clydesdale](http://data1.whicdn.com/images/71131544/original.jpg). The markings and feathering are right, and it fits with the film insisting the Scottish-ness of everything in it. However, Clydesdales as a breed weren't developed until the [18th century](http://www.clydesdalehorsesociety.com/breed-history.html). Now, that said, it's not like there weren't Medieval horses. Horses were generally classed based on what they did. Because Angus is a princess' horse, it's likely that he's a [palfrey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palfrey), or happy-fun-riding horse. However, he still doesn't really match [the image of a medieval palfrey](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_zVtE7gWnuH4/TJUZGPsUalI/AAAAAAAAAuw/LO6oG015hUM/s1600/IMG_3495rs.jpg), which would have been smaller, lighter, and not as feathered as Angus. \n\nSo the horse doesn't help. Stupid horse. But you know what the film does get right? [Castle design](http://i.imgur.com/dNqSxhI.png). Oh yes, [dat castle design](http://i.imgur.com/ho4vzwP.png). Round castles were all the rage in the - \n\nHang on a sec.\n\nHang on.\n\n[That's](http://i.imgur.com/ho4vzwP.png) [Castle Urquhart](http://i.imgur.com/bNRIEZn.jpg). It's from a funky angle, but that's clearly [Castle Urquhart](http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/00/14/5e/85/urquhart-castle-on-loch.jpg). As in, in use until the 17th century, Castle Urquhart. I mean, good job capturing Scottish castle architecture, but Castle Urquhart? One of the most famous Scottish castles? It seems...poorly planned.\n\nI think the end lesson to take from *Brave* is that Disney movies are fun and should not be taken seriously as historical documentaries. Also that there are more tartan designs than I care to sift through and Scottish fashion history is *fascinating*.\n\nP.S. [This?](http://i.imgur.com/KcT9FVq.png).

        "text": "Last night I was listening to the Teaching Company lecture series titled \"The American Revolution\". The course lecturer is Allen Guelzo, who wrote *The Last Invasion* which is a recent book on the Battle of Gettysburg and worth your time. As such I was looking forward to this set. I enjoyed the first two lectures, \"The Imperial Crisis, 1763-1773\", and \"The Ancient Constitution\". The third lecture is titled \"A Soldier What's Fit for a Soldier\", and I even enjoyed the vast majority of it, as Professor Guelzo makes sure to point out that no, the British redcoat was *not* the scum of the earth (Wellington's statements notwithstanding), and that no, he was *not* a \"lion led by jackasses\" (despite what Napoleon liked to say). \n\nWhere he failed spectacularly was in the last five minutes of the lecture when he starts to talk about the Brown Bess and the shortcomings of the musket. A few choice quotes from Professor Guelzo to illustrate the point. \n\n&gt;\"The Brown Bess was *utterly* unreliable for hitting targets at more than eighty yards\" \n\n(emphasis was Professor Guelzo's).\n\nThe effective volley range of a Brown Bess musket was actually 100 yards. (Effective is defined as 75% of your shots hitting a man-sized target at 100 yards) The maximum range was 175-200 yards, though a few extreme shots of 250-300 yards were recorded during the Revolutionary War. This has been confirmed many times through modern testing, but for quick comparison here's a reenactor unit of the 95th Rifles doing some testing on the Brown Bess to show how accurate it truly was.\n\n[2/95th Tests the Brown Bess](http://youtu.be/trgZmM9fNS0)\n\nIn both the single firing and the \"volley\" (volley in quotations since it consisted of two men), at least 75% of their rounds landed on target. In the volley fire there was one misfire in the 20 rounds--in the 18th century there would have likely been more, especially among the British army who were chronically plagued by bad flints. One caveat is that the quality of powder used in modern reproduction is more consistent than what would have been available in the 18th century despite the best efforts of reenactors and enthusiasts to duplicate 18th century techniques.\n\nIn case that's not enough, here's some contemporary evidence:\n\nGeneral Thomas Gage:  “One close, well-directed fire, at the distance of eight or ten rods [forty-four to fifty-five yards],will do more towards defeating the enemy than all the scattered, random shot, fired in a whole day.” The point with this statement is that 55 yards was considered \"close\".^1\n\nAt Bunker Hill the opening volleys opened up at about 60 yards--and again commanders at the site told their troops to wait until the men got close and to hold their fire until the last moment (though no contemporary evidence of \"wait until you see the whites of their eyes\" has ever been found). The point again is that 60 yards was incredibly close for an opening volley and it proved devastating. \n\nAt Guilford Courthouse there was one point during the battle where about 1600 British attacked 1100 Americans who were stationed behind a rail fence. When the British had gotten to about 150 yards, the Americans opened up with their first fire, which proved to be pretty effective, described by one British soldier as “most galling and destructive\".  It's quite likely that some of these men had rifles--in the Carolinas a higher portion of the militia had rifles than in any other area, but the vast majority of them would have still been armed with muskets. \n\n&gt;\"The muzzle velocity of 660 to 800 feet per second could not guarantee penetration when you did hit above 100 yards\". It is true that occasionally men were struck by musket balls that didn't penetrate--for example, in a skirmish in New Jersey in February 1780 men of the Queen's Rangers were struck by musket balls that didn't penetrate. Simcoe (commander of the Queen's Rangers) thought it was because the militia who fired them lacked the presence of mind to fully ram down the musket ball--however it could have been due to poor quality powder, extreme distance of shot, not enough powder being poured in due to inexperience, or a number of other things. \n\nI really have no idea where he got this information from. If using 160 grains of powder (standard load for the Revolutionary War), then the average muzzle velocity of the Brown Bess will be 1000-1100 fps. If you're tap loading (which was done on occasion but certainly wasn't standard), then yes, you could expect to lose 25% of your velocity. \n\n&gt;Although the smoothbore of the musket made it easier to load than the rifle it could still only be loaded one shot at a time\"\n\nThis is a minor nitpick, as I know full well what he meant. However, it *was* fairly common practice for soldiers to load multiple rounds into their muskets. This was particularly true of the Americans who would load one large musket ball and two smaller rounds into their muskets for what was called \"buck and ball\". Some examples from contemporary sources. During the battle of Williamson's Plantation (also known as Huck's Defeat), which was a significant defeat of a combined Loyalist/British force by American militia in South Carolina, the Loyalist leader, Christian Huck, was killed. The man who claimed credit for it did so by saying that he had loaded his musket with two rounds and that's how he would be found. ^2\n\nWhile we're talking about myths of the musket, I want to talk about one more big myth that needs dispelling. \n\n**The British Army wasn't taught to take aim**\n\nThis one pops up occasionally because in the manual of arms there's no command for \"Aim!\", merely \"Present!\". However, in the instructions for said manual of arms it gives pretty clear directions for what appear to be aiming directions:\n\n“raise up the butt so high upon the right shoulder, that you may not be obliged to stoop so much with the head (the right cheek [is] to be close tothe butt, and the left eye shut), and look along the barrel with the right eye from the breech pin to the muzzle.”\n\nMilitary theorists, such as the Earl of Cavan advocated for aiming instruction,  recommending that officers have at the breech [of the firelock] a small sight-channel made, for the advantage and convenience of occasionally taking better aim.\"\n\nAlso there are many eyewitness accounts during the Revolutionary War of soldiers taking part in aiming drills. At Boston in January 1775, Lieutenant Frederick Mackenzie of the 23rd Regiment wrote:\n\n&gt;The regiments are frequently practiced at firing with ball at marks. Six rounds per man at each time is usually allotted for this practice. As our regiment is quartered on a wharf which projects into part of the harbor, and there is a very considerable range without any obstruction, we have fixed figures of men as large as life, made of thin boards, on small stages, which are anchored at a proper distance from the end of the wharf, at which the men fire. Objects afloat, which move up and down with the tide, are frequently pointed out for them to fire at,and premiums are sometimes given for the best shots, by which means some of our men have become excellent marksmen.\n\nA visitor to Boston witnessed one such session in late March 1775: \n\n&gt;“I saw a regiment and the body of Marines, each by itself, firing at marks. A target being set up before each company, the soldiers of the regiment stepped out singly, took aim and fired, and the firing was kept up in this manner by the whole regiment till they had all fired ten rounds. The Marines fired by platoons, by companies, and sometimes by files, and made some general discharges, taking aim all the while at targets the same as the regiment.”\n\nIn New Jersey in May 1777, the battalions of the Fourth Brigade were urged to undertake a similar exercise: \n\n&gt;“Lieutenant Colonel Mawhood recommends to the officers commanding the several regiments of the 4th Brigade to practice the men in firing ball by platoon[s], sub[divisions] and grand-divisions and by battalion; and this [is] to be done by word of command and on uneven ground, so as to accustom the men not to fire but when ordered, and not only to level but to be taught to fire up and downhill.”\n\nFinally, from a participant at the battle of Freeman's Farm. This is from an American militia member's recollections. \n\n&gt;Their whole battalion on the right of the colors were ordered to fire at once. I heard the words “Battalion, make ready!”; and, as few as we were (notwithstanding their boasted discipline), when the word was given and they came to a “recover” to cock their muskets, a considerable number went off and were fired in the air. When the word PRESENT was given (which means “take aim”), they fired, along the battalion as if it were a *feu de joie*; and when the word FIRE was given, there was but few pieces to fire.\n\n**Sources**\n\n1.)

Someone [quoted the Fourth Amendment](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2ai93k/whistleblower_nsa_stores_80_of_all_phone_calls/civexi5), thus sparking a debate chain on morality, how the founding fathers wouldn't stand for this, how the founding fathers were all slave owners, how slave owners would probably be better than modern politicians, and [this gem](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2ai93k/whistleblower_nsa_stores_80_of_all_phone_calls/civhyy7). Let's see their eloquent argument:\n\n&gt; the important part isn't so much that they [the Founding Fathers] owned slaves and farms, it's that they were planters. they would buy up land to the west and sell it. and *that's* the reason there was an American revolution.\n\nSure, the [Proclamation of 1763](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proclamation_of_1763) certainly created some tensions with English colonists and the crown, but that's beside the point right now. Shall we move on?\n\n&gt; the monarchy said that only agents of the crown could authorize the purchase of land past the Appalachians, and the hyper-wealthy planter class (who George Washington and other founders came from) wouldn't budge on this, because they needed to consume land to be wealthy - and consume is definitely the right word, because every single suitable piece of land was used for growing (mostly tobacco) and this land was not taken care of. land was grown on non-stop, without rotation or fertilizing (which were understood techniques at the time, they just weren't economical compared to claiming more land) until it could no longer support life.\n\nWhoa there. Sure, some of the Founding Fathers owned plantations, but they were not the \"hyper-wealthy\" class this deluded redditor made them out to be. In fact [some sources](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington#Retirement_.281797.E2.80.931799.29) suggest that the Mount Vernon barely managed to turn a profit. The only [acknowledged mention](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington#Between_the_wars:_Mount_Vernon_.281759.E2.80.931774.29) of George Washington getting land in the Appalachians (i.e., the \"cause\" of the American Revolution) was a large parcel of land in West Virginia as a soldier's pension after the French and Indian war.\n\nAlso, the possibility of the land being \"grown on non-stop\" was unlikely; [the four-year crop rotation cycle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_rotation#History) was common place knowledge, and, while it was argued that it was neglected for economical reasons, it just simply wouldn't make any sense. Why would someone destroy land that is already proven to grow crops well, simply in the name of budget? \n\n&gt; no taxation without representation didn't mean shit, and was only used to get the rest of the population to support the idea of a revolution, the real problem was that the planter class didn't have royal power and since they couldn't get it, they would just circumvent it entirely.\n\nNow they're arguing that \"taxation without representation,\" among [other actual grievances](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War#Causes) (including, but not limited to: establishing British trade monopolies in America, forced quartering of troops, restrictions on freedom of speech/press/assembly, blockading Boston harbor, embargoing the Thirteen Colonies, etc.), wasn't an *actual* problem, but was overblown to rile up the colonists. When the Revolution was over and America, those dirty \"Founding Fathers\" must've gone and claimed all the lands for themselves, right? [Wrong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson#Later_years), [wrong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams#After_his_presidency), and [wrong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Monroe#Post-presidency).Thomas Jefferson focused mostly on his library, John Adams mainly ran a newspaper, and James Monroe even sold off his plantation! \n\nI'll now leave you all with a quote from our valued contributor:\n\n&gt; the American mythology of liberty and populism is bullshit from the ground up.",

        "text": "Return of Kings. In the hotly-contested “Worst of the Manosphere” competition, this blog  is a consistent front-runner. [Their latest effort](http://www.donotlink.com/framed?56321), by one “Billy Chubbs” (also known for [this post](http://www.donotlink.com/framed?10240), about how school shootings are the fault of young girls.) is entitled “Men Fought The Nazis, Women Slept With Them”. It's a parade of selective quotations, dubious sources, obscene interpolation, and general misogyny. I haven't even looked at the comments, which are apparently full of holocaust deniers.\n\nMr. Chubbs starts his essay with a war story supposedly from his great-uncle. I won't bother discussing it, as it's both mostly irrelevant to his main point and, well, a relative's war story. It would be uncouth to pick apart childhood memories of an old man's recollections, especially when there is so much else to dissect. There's an odd line about how “men from many western countries” had similar traumatic experiences to his great-uncle. The specification of westerners is quite odd. Eastern Europeans suffered many more casualties than the West in WW2, and excluding them from the human experience of the war is, I think, revealing. He then gets into conscription and how “regardless”, the war was still justified by the evil of Nazi Germany.\n\n\nFinally, about halfway through the essay, we get to the heart of Mr. Chubbs' argument – fraternization between women and German men. He relates a further story from his great-uncle about scandalous visits by local women to a POW camp. Now, he states that\n&gt; Fraternize is a polite, politically correct term: in actuality, these Canadian women were driving or walking out to the tar shacks to screw the brains out of these German prisoners of war.\n\nThis is at best partially correct. While the term “fraternization” is most often used to refer to sexual relationships, it covers any kind of forbidden relationship.\n&gt;All the services prohibit personal and business relationships between officers and enlisted members, calling them prejudicial to good order and discipline. Personal relationships include dating, cohabitation and any sexual relationship. Business relationships include loaning and borrowing money and business partnerships.\n\n[From the Defense Department's page on fraternization regulations](http://www.defense.gov/specials/fraternization/)\n\n\nAnyway, that's what this essay is about: The betrayal of fighting “western” men by Woman.\n\nMr. Chubbs discusses fraternization in occupied France, contrasting the torments that french Men suffered with the behavior of “their” women, who \n&gt; were willingly allowing themselves to be [spitroasted by SS officers](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/02/books/review/excerpt-sleeping-with-the-enemy-coco-chanels-secret-war-by-hal-vaughan.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;) in Parisian hotels.\n\n Now if you follow that link, you will see that it discusses famous fashion designer Coco Chanel, her relationship with Abwehr agent Hans Gunther von Dincklage, her antisemitism, and her activities as a Nazi agent. It says nothing about french women in general or the wives or girlfriends of resistance members in particular. It doesn't even support orgies with SS officers. All Mr. Chubbs has done is demonstrate that one collaborator was in a long-term relationship with a German intelligence agent. \n\n\nOf course Ms. Chanel was not the only person to have a sexual or romantic relationship with a member of the occupying forces in France. 20,000 or more women had their heads shaved after liberation for \"collaboration horizontale\", although this number can be only loosely connected to the number of actual fraternizers, to say nothing of male collaborators of any kind.\n\n&gt; Elsewhere some men who had volunteered to work in German factories had their heads shaved, but that was an exception. Women almost always were the first targets, because they offered the easiest and most vulnerable scapegoats, particularly for those men who had joined the resistance at the last moment. Altogether, at least 20,000 women are known to have had their heads shaved. But the true figure may well be higher, considering that some estimates put the number of French children fathered by members of the Wehrmacht as high as 80,000.\n\n-[Anthony Beevor]( http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jun/05/women-victims-d-day-landings-second-world-war)\n\nConsidering the motivations of these women is beyond Mr. Chubbs, of course. He says nothing of the effects that the combination of the incarceration of 10% of adult french men in german POW camps with Vichy policies regarding working women and the extraction of french resources to support the German economy had on the ability of women to support themselves without resorting to prostitution.\n\n&gt;One of the conditions of the armistice was to pay the costs of the three-hundred-thousand strong occupying German army, which amounted to twenty million Reichmarks per day. The artificial exchange rate of the German currency against the French franc was consequently established as 1 RM to 20 FF. This allowed German requisitions and purchases to be made into a form of organised plunder and resulted in endemic food shortages and malnutrition, particularly amongst children, the elderly, and the more vulnerable sections of French society such as the working urban class of the cities.\n\n-[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_military_administration_in_occupied_France_during_World_War_II#Daily_life)\n\nAfter a brief shot at Hilary Clinton, Chubbs moves on to British women and amazingly manages to fail even worse at implicating them than he did french women. He starts with a link to an article about possible children of occupying German soldiers in the Channel Islands, which itself points out that the higher numbers are disputed and are derived from anonymous informers. He follows up with an article from the Daily Mail, which would normally be enough to throw it out right away, but this particular article doesn't seem too bad. Anyways, it discusses two women who married German POWs … after the war was over. British men were hardly being “machine gunned” by other Germans at the time. Next, discussing upper-class British girls who were sent to finishing school in Germany during the '30's. The source is an interview with the author of a novel about the subject. In any event, I fail to see how young, politically naive girls enjoying a trip abroad can in any way condemn British woman as a whole. Their fathers and brothers often had nice things to say about Germany, as well. If you look through some of the names [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Far-right_politics_in_the_United_Kingdom), you'll see that pro-German and pro-Fascist feelings were not uncommon amongst the British upper class, irregardless of gender.\n\n&gt;  John Amery was the son of Leo Amery, a half Jewish Member of Parliament and later Conservative government minister. John's brother Julian Amery also became an MP and served in a Conservative government. ...  he came to embrace the fascist National Socialist doctrines of Nazi Germany on the grounds that they were the only alternative to Bolshevism.\n\n\n&gt; [Robert] Gordon-Canning was born in Hartpury, Gloucestershire, England in 1888. He counted the poet Lord Byron among his ancestors ... In 1934 Gordon-Canning joined the British Union of Fascists ... At a sale of former German embassy property in 1945, Gordon-Canning attracted significant publicity when he purchased a large marble bust of Hitler from a sale of former German embassy property. Apparently by way of justification, he told reporters \"Jesus, 2000 years ago was mocked, scorned and crucified. Today, He is a living force in the hearts and minds of millions of people.\"\n\n\n&gt; Henry Hamilton Beamish ... The son of an admiral who had served as an A.D.C. to Queen Victoria ... was one of the earliest developers of the Madagascar Plan for Jewish deportation. He spoke in Germany where he claimed, rather dubiously, to have taught Adolf Hitler\n\n\n, you'll see that pro-German and pro-Fascist feelings were not uncommon amongst the British upper class, irregardless of gender. The end result of all this is that Mr. Chubbs has managed to demonstrate that, when Briton was not at war with Germany, the people of the two countries pursued romantic and sexual relationships with one another. Shocking. He finishes us this topic by linking to, amazingly, an actual academic source: [a paper from the Journal of Contemporary History](http://jch.sagepub.com/content/48/4/742.abstract), written by someone who appears to be an actual historian! Unfortunately, I don't have access to this publication, so I will not be able to discover if anything from it supports the thesis that the behavior of British women during the war demonstrates “how immoral and low women as a species can go”. However, I doubt it does. \n\nContinued in comments",

        "text": "[Rejected Princesses](http://www.rejectedprincesses.com/post/91260096575/elisabeth-bathory-the-blood-countess-first-off-i#notes) has appeared here in the past for smaller mistakes the blog's creator has made, but this is pretty egregious. After describing the various crimes accused of the famous noblewoman, as well as a list of popular myths, the owner of Rejected Princesses claims that Elizabeth Bathory was innocent of all crimes.\n\nThe blogger insists that the killings were fabricated by George Thurzo, a Hungarian count and rival of Bathory. She describes him as a \"known schemer\", though she gives no source or example to support that. She asks the audience to judge which is more likely: 'an incredibly outlandish list of violence perpetrated by a cadre of old women over decades; or, an orchestrated persecution against a powerful, harsh, and independent woman – in the age of actual witch hunts, no less!\" Essentially, Rejected Princesses is just going on a hunch that Bathory is completely innocent, because she was an important person from a wealthy family. The contemporary accounts and general historical consensus are wildly different, and it's believed that while some stories were exaggerated, Bathory *did* kill people. \n\nHer single source is the biographer Tony Thorne, who isn't a historian. Even still, he does not postulate that Elizabeth Bathory was innocent of all accusations. This is just the blogger's own speculation.\n\nIt really seems like the blogger in question wanted to change the facts to fit her narrative of Bathory as an independent, intriguing badass who was constantly persecuted by male rivals. And she certainly was! But just because you appreciate a historical figure doesn't mean it's okay to distort the facts to support your own narrative or agenda. I believe that it's disrespectful to whitewash a person known for their crimes as an innocent victim, and while I usually like Rejected Princesses, this is a very poor way to honor a person as intriguing as Bathory.",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2a82wk/the_straight_dope_smallpox_and_what_really/",
        "text": "From the ancient past of 1997, Cecil Adams of *The Straight Dope* attempts to answer the question [\"Did whites ever give Native Americans blankets infected with smallpox?\"](http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1088/did-whites-ever-give-native-americans-blankets-infected-with-smallpox). The article discusses the best known and best documented incident of this sort. I've seen this article being cited around Reddit quite a bit lately, including here at Badhistory. Unfortunately, it's missing a big a sizable piece of the puzzle that results in an erroneous conclusion. So let's start with some background. \n\nAs the Straight Dope articles says, in 1763, Pontiac organized a widespread resistance to the new British military presence in the Ohio Country following the end of the French-and-Indian War. During the early part of the war, Pontiac and his allies succeeded in capturing all but three of the British forts in the region. While Pontiac led the siege of Fort Detroit, Guyasuta led the siege of Fort Pitt (the Straight Dope article gives all the credit to Pontiac). The third surviving fort, Fort Niagara, was not under a dedicated siege, but its supply lines were subject to frequent raids, apparently led by another of Pontiac's Seneca allies, the little-known \"Farmer's Brother.\" Guyasuta's nephew Cornplanter was also involved in the raids on this area. Jeffrey Amherst dispatched Henry Bouquet to lift the siege of Fort Pitt and in a series of letters between the two, we find the exchange discussed in the article. On August 1st, Guyasuta broke off the siege to confront Bouquet's approaching forces at the Battle of Bushy Run (August 5-6).\n\nCecil Adams concludes the article with \"We don't know if Bouquet actually put the plan into effect, or if so with what result.\" Of course, whether or not Bouquet actually put the plan into motion is irrelevant. Because by the time he should up at Fort Pitt, the plan had already been independently devised and put into motion by Simeon Ecuyer and William Trent.\n\nEcuyer and Trent were ranking officers at Fort Pitt when the siege began on June 22nd. On June 24th, two Lenape diplomats, Turtle's Heart and Mamaltee, entered the fort to negotiate the British's surrender and offer them a chance to evacuate the fort. As Ecuyer wrote in his diary: \"Out of our regard for them, we gave them two Blankets and a Handkerchief out of the Small Pox Hospital. I hope it will have the desired effect.\" Trent would also later file an invoice \"to Replace in Kind those which were taken from people in the Hospital to Convey the Smallpox the Indians [...]\"\n\nThe original question \"Did whites ever give Native Americans blankets infected with smallpox?\" can be definitively answered \"Yes\" in this case at least, along with the added qualification that it was done specifically to spread the disease. Another famous incident, involving the spread of smallpox on the Plains following the path of steamboat *St. Peter's* as it traded up the Missouri in 1837, is sometimes cited as another example, but by all accounts was more accidental than intentional, but that's for another day.\n\nHowever, while we can answer the question with a clear \"Yes,\" it's much harder to answer the question \"Did  the smallpox scheme actually infect the besieging forces?\" An outbreak of smallpox had already begun among both Euroamericans and Native Americans in 1762, popping up here and there throughout the war (including within Fort Pitt before the siege began). Some of Guyasuta's forces were likely infected even before Trent and Ecuyer sent out the blankets with Turtle's Heart and Mamaltee. While the fate of Mamaltee is unknown, Turtle's Heart survived the war and was present at future treaty negotiations several years later, despite being a hypothetical Patient Zero. Ecuyer and Trent *may* have made a bad situation worse if their blankets had \"the desired effect,\" but they didn't create an epidemic on their own.\n\n**Sources**\n\n* [Ecuyer's Journal](https://archive.org/stream/fortpittlettersf00darl#page/n103/mode/2up)\n* [Biological Warfare in Eighteenth-Century North America: Beyond Jeffery Amherst](http://www.jstor.org/stable/view/2567577)",

The new res features seem to be helpful, too. But anyway...\n\n\nFor those of you don't know who Giorgio Tsoukalos is, the title of that submission should make it pretty clear. As should [this compilation.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IABsBprJJPo) If you have never watched *Ancient Aliens*, then I suggest you do, only because it's absolutely hilarious (as long as you're getting the content for free), especially if you keep a bottle of hard liquor close by. Hell, this is badhistory...you should have a few tequila bottles lined up upside-down (like water dispensers in a hamster cage) mounted to the wall by your desk. (Credit to /u/Khosikulu for this novel means of spirit dispensation.)\n\nNow, I want to start off by pointing out the last sentence Tsoukalos utters in the video clip compilation that I provided above. Quoth the hair-man:\n\n&gt;It happened because, if you look at all the pieces, it's the *only* conclusion that you can draw.\n\nOf course, here he is referring to the position that extraterrestrials had influence on the technological development used in the impressive architecture of various ancient civilizations throughout. This flies right in the face of what the person in the linked thread is saying about Tsoukalos:\n\n&gt;The man cuts no corners. Leaves no stones unturned.\n\nI would certainly say that there is a major stone left unturned in the basic thesis that Tsoukalos is parroting (most of the ancient astronaut theorists' work is just a rewording of the arguments of Erich von Däniken and Zecharia Sitchin made in the '60s and '70s). Dismissing the possibility that the ancient civilizations in question consisted of clever individuals capable of developing and utilizing sophisticated technologies which, coupled with large amounts of time and manpower, made these civilizations able to produce such monumental architecture—and instead concluding an alternative scenario which assumes (a) that extraterrestrials exist in spite of no existing proof in the form of artifact or radio signals, etc., and (b) that these extraterrestrials came to earth, effectively communicated with and taught ancient civilizations throughout the globe how to develop technologies that are not beyond the means of human ingenuity anyway, and left without leaving a single artifact so far discovered—is such a gross failure of application of the Principle of Parsimony that even vast hordes of conspiracy theorists and other over-credulous individuals do not buy into it. If that's neither 'leaving no stone unturned' nor 'cutting corners', it's certainly a failure in reasoning/methodology equally bad, if not worse.\n\nMoving on, the person also claims this:\n\n&gt;If only for his understanding of happiness, he is one of the smartest people I've ever met. In addition, his vocabulary is immense and his articulation of complicated ideas are simple. **His knowledge of history (beyond aliens) appears to have few limits as well.**\n\n(Emphasis mine.) As an explanation of what's wrong with this statement, I'm going to quote myself from that thread:\n\n&gt;Savvy in the field of history requires far more than just exposure to copious amounts of information. It requires a deep understanding of methodology, and how it's employed to sort through the wealth of evidence historians have to work with. Tsoukalos is extremely deficient in the latter.\n\nI would also add that Tsoukalos, for the influence von Däniken and Sitchin have had on him, is also extremely deficient in his ability to analyze 'secondary' materials in historical or anthropological study, as he does not so much as question (anywhere I've seen) their lack of direct citations of primary evidence (sometimes works themselves, other times direct passages), their frequent (mis)translations and (mis)interpretations of texts, their repeated unwillingness to submit their work to peer review (through which it would most certainly not pass), their failure to provide any sort of credentials in any of the subjects they're writing about, their repeated failure to address contradictions in their own work as well as contradictions issued by academics in the field, and so on. Tsoukalos instead parrots these arguments without due analysis of the evidence with stringent adherence to agreed-upon methodology, leading to many outlandish and erroneous conclusions that make it highly improbable that his knowledge of history beyond aliens is anywhere close to impressive, provided that expertise in history, or any of the other fields he intrudes upon, requires (as I assert) a thorough knowledge of methodology—and I would also add familiarity with the relevant historiography to the list of necessary qualifications to be considered skilled in this discipline.\n\nSomeone in reply to the first linked comment then says the following, lamenting that nobody is taking this person seriously (despite the person getting a good amount of net upvotes):\n\n&gt;Sounds like all of them have jumped on the \"mainstream knowledge couldn't possibly be wrong.\" But I bet they'd change their tune if Hawking or Tyson started preaching ancient astronaut theory.\n\nI replied to this point as well, asserting that these people are *as* qualified in discussing ancient history, Old Testament scholarship, ancient languages/religions, and so on. That level of qualification is essentially zero, at least on the level required to be considered competent, much less an expert or authority. It's also not so much a matter of not recognizing that mainstream knowledge could be wrong—most people would concede this possibility—but whether one should be willing to discard the theses that require very few outlandish assumptions with plenty of supporting evidence in favor of the ones that require a large number of outlandish assumptions with no supporting evidence, and with it discard any willingness to subject possible explanations to Occam's Razor.\n\nThat person continued, in the initial comment to which I replied, to say this:\n\n&gt;Enjoy the back pedaling as more structures like Gobekli Tepei (sic) are discovered and our ideas of ancient human history alter drastically.\n\n[Göbekli Tepe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Göbekli_Tepe) is an impressive discovery that has forced archaeologists to rework some of their conclusions about paleolithic/mesolithic hunter-gatherer societies (assumed to be constructed by them, lacking any evidence of contemporaneous domestication of plants or animals). Research and excavation are ongoing, but so far nothing about any of the excavated complexes suggests extraterrestrial intervention—which is the major leap that Tsoukalos and ancient astronaut theorists take, for which they get rightfully dismissed.\n\n-----\n\nEdit - Yes, I am aware there are some pretty awful run-on sentences in here.",

If you were expecting this to provoke thoughtful and intelligent discussion of a topic that's sensitive even today, you would be wrong. \n\n&gt; Also, I have a hard time accepting the idea that because a small tribe of people live in an entire state that it \"belonged to them\". They probably viewed the settlers as people setting up their own villages in the big expanse of land. We just grew much, much faster. - PMMEYOURSHRUBBERY\n\nThis is ridiculous.

Many tribes have specific roles known as [medicine men](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine_man) that among other things attempt to understand and treat illness among their people. Additionally, if \"the government\" refers to the United States government as context would suggest, they have never given smallpox blankets to any natives. Not only do we have anthropological evidence of disease, we have [physical evidence](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1071659/) as well. \n\n&gt; and you can have this, a used blanket... -- skch\n\n\n&gt; Hey guys!

'Tis life. -- CommanderWilliamTRiker\n\nFuck you. You don't get to justify genocide by saying \"Well they did it too\". \n\n&gt; American seizure? I think not. More appropriately European seizure of land in the Americas.\n\n\n&gt; *Should really be titled \"Time-lapse of British seizure of indigenous land\"\n\nIt's a bloody map of *US* seizure of land. That's why the date starts at 1776 and not in 1511 with the Spanish.\n\n&gt; True, some indigenous tribes have actually been completely wiped out in other parts of the world... like no one left in 1-2 generations.\n\nI'm sure the natives were happy only 80% of their population was killed, their homes forcibly relocated, their families split, and their culture in many cases literally beaten out of them at BIA schools. \n\n&gt; Yup....I just get tired of the \"your whole country is stolen land\" meme. No....99% of it was fucking empty and wasn't taken from anyone. -- PMMEYOURSHRUBBERY\n\n[Here's](http://cogweb.ucla.edu/Chumash/Images/calprecontact.gif) an approximate map of pre-contact tribal territories in California. How empty does that look to you? Just because you can't see the evidence of political structure does not mean it never existed.\n\n&gt; the indigenous did not understand land as something to be owned or conquered. As far as they were concerned it shouldn't belong to anyone -- bringbackfirefly \n\n\n&gt; You can't 'seize' something that isn't owned. Aboriginals had no concept of ownership, and often just ceded use of the land. -- UnderThereModel\n\nGood god, there is so much wrong with these two statements. Ignoring any issues with property rights and the semantics of seizure, it's not nearly as simple as \"the natives just gave up their land\". In many cases, they were given confusing contracts in languages they barely understood (or couldn't understand at all!) that ceded lands, signed by people who had no authority to do so. The most famous case of this culminated in the Black Hills war and the US government later conceded its fault in [United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17366742430439084905&amp;q=United+States+v.+Sioux+Nation+of+Indians&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=806&amp;as_vis=1). In other cases, the natives were persuaded to trade land for goods and later came to regret their trades. In still more situations, entire tribes were forcibly relocated, as happened with the Bedonkohe, Lipan the Nednai Apache. \n\n&gt; more like the spread of civilization! -- AlphaSh0ck\n\nThe Hohokam in the American Southwest had the largest irrigation network in the world before their collapse. There were trade routes spanning a thousand miles or more, extending from the coasts deep into the interior of the country. The east coast and Mesoamerica were home to civilizations rivalling anything in Eurasia in social complexity and size in their heydays. The Puebloans of New Mexico were building dams and roads. Their cultures may have been alien, but they can hardly be called uncivilized.\n\n&gt; But were the Spanish, in the North American territories, quite as genocidal? -- georglukacs \n\nIt reflects a deficiency in the educational system that the Spanish atrocities in North America aren't as widely known as their atrocities in Central and South America.

Relevant excerpt:\n\n&gt;And these millions of deaths, some of which were the unavoidable results of natural calamities, some of which were the avoidable results of poor resource management, many of which were the result of totalitarian oppression, get lumped together into Exhibit A and laid at the feet of Communism itself and also (in some weird reversal of the Great Man theory) at the feet of whichever prominent leader was in power. And we, the present day people having the conversation, have to sit there and not say anything in defense of anyone or we're banned.\n\nWhat time is it?  R5 time.\n\nThe Great Leap Forward was Mao’s grand plan to surpass the capitalist west.  Overnight, agricultural production would be modernized, and crop yields would skyrocket.  Steel production would overtake the United Kingdom in three years, and the United States in ten.  There was never any concrete idea as to *how* these things would happen, and, in truth, they never did.  Instead, official publications printed staged photographs and elaborate lies about model farms producing ten times (and later a hundred times) the normal yields, and local cadres were given to understand that the same was expected of them.  Mao himself publicly stated, in August 1958, that “we must consider what do with all of this surplus food.”  (On the steel front, the plan was to order peasants to turn all available iron into brittle, useless crap in homemade rural blast furnaces.)\n\nUnfortunately, there was no surplus. The cadres dutifully reported the expected inflated numbers, and grain was confiscated as if those numbers were true, leaving the peasants with nothing at a time when China was *exporting grain.*  A [2014 study]( http://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty/pyared/papers/famines.pdf) found that there was *positive* correlation between regional per capita grain production and famine mortality rates.  In other words, *areas that produced more grain had more people starve to death.*  This is the crucial fact that must be understood – the famine was not the result of crop failure.  It was not the result of war, or natural disaster.  It was the result of Mao’s policies.\nNow, our Communist poster might insist at this point that I am unfairly laying responsibility for the famine at the “feet of whichever prominent leader was in power at the time.”  To that, I say that it is virtually impossible to overstate the degree to which Mao dominated the Chinese Communist Party at the time.  \n\nTo fully understand Mao’s level of control, let’s take a look at Marshal Peng.  In 1959, Peng Dehuai was the PRC Defense Minister.  His life story reads like that of some kind of Communist superhero.  He was born to a poor peasant family and lost two brothers to starvation.  At the age of thirteen he went to work in a coal mine.  As a teenager, a warrant for his arrest was issued after he took part in the seizure of a grain warehouse.  At sixteen he became a soldier, and he later secretly joined the Communist Party.  He rose steadily through the ranks and commanded the resistance to the Japanese in Northeast China.  After the war, he defeated Nationalist Forces there.  He subsequently commanded Chinese forces in Korea.\n\nIn 1959, at the Lushan Conference, Peng wrote private letter to Mao.  Though he took pains to emphasize his respect for Mao, he essentially called out the inflated grain yield numbers as being impossible.  Unlike Mao, Peng was a peasant, and had experienced famine first hand, and so he expressed his concern.\n\nMao’s response was to publicly read the letter, denounce Peng, purge him from the party, and order his arrest.  That was Mao’s response to a straightforward, respectful, factually based objection to his policies from an old line revolutionary with impeccable Communist credentials.\n\nAccording to official Chinese numbers, 16.5 million people starved to death during the three years of the Great Leap Forward.  Other studies have placed the number as high 45 million.  Those deaths were the entirely predictable, entirely preventable result of Mao’s fantasyland policies.  Placing responsibility for them at his feet is entirely just and proper.  Remember, people.  Sharing, or nominally sharing, an ideology with someone doesn’t mean you are honor bound to defend everything they do.\n\nIt’s worth noting that the Communist rabbit hole goes very deep, and this is actually a comparatively mild example.  For a taste of just how bad this sort of thing can get, have a look at this [wide ranging interview]( http://revcom.us/a/323/you-dont-know-what-you-think-you-know-en.html) of a person named Raymond Lotta, a member of a Communist splinter group with an outsize view of its own ideological and historic significance. \n\nIf you’re not particularly familiar with Chinese history, Lotta might sound persuasive.  But his persuasiveness is founded on methodically ignoring inconvenient facts.  For example, Lotta insists that the main cause of the famine was a “sharp decline in food production” caused by bad weather.  To support this assertion, he cites to YY Kueh, *Agricultural Instability in China, 1931–1991: Weather, Technology, and Institutions* (New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1995).  Unfortunately, the study Lotta just cited goes on to say that, though bad weather contributed, weather of comparable magnitude in the past [“had not caused such serious contractions in national grain output.”](http://faculty.virginia.edu/wei_li/papers/drop-current.pdf) (bottom of page 1; the linked paper – I was unable to find Kueh’s paper online and had to find another paper that cites to it -- attributes 80% of the decline in production to Mao’s policies).  In other words, Lotta *misrepresented the position of the source he just cited to support his claim that bad weather was to blame.*\n\nNeedless to say, Lotta also neglects to mention anything related to Peng Dehuai, Mao’s rosy public statements, or the fact that China’s grain exports in 1959 doubled.  He goes on to characterize the Cultural Revolution as “The Furthest Advance of Human Emancipation Yet.”  That’s not me pulling a quotation of his out of context.  That’s the name of the chapter on the Cultural Revolution.\n\n While I have a certain amount of sympathy for the Communist who was banned from SRS Discussion, who after all was probably just buying into the fabrications of someone like Lotta, for Lotta himself I’ve got none at all.\n\n(Note on sources: all quotations from the People’s Daily are taken from Jung Chang and Jon Halliday’s *Mao: The Unknown Story.*  I realize that it’s not the best source, but I think it’s entirely trustworthy when it comes to reporting what the official organ of the CCP was printing.  It was also the source of the “England in three, USA in ten” remark, which was not sourced to a People’s Daily article.  That may be an error – others have suggested Mao thought it would take fifteen years to surpass US Steel Production by throwing farm implements in shitty homemade blast furnaces.)  \n\n(Information on Peng Dehuai is from my recollection of a university lecture and a source I don’t currently possess.  It’s also easily verifiable and quite uncontroversial.  Finally, the study on famine mortality and crop yields may be found [here](http://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty/pyared/papers/famines.pdf))",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2a1g3e/thor_heyerdahl_is_terrible_and_you_are_terrible/",
        "text": "Thor Heyerdahl is probably the most famous person connected with either ancient South American or Oceanic studies from the twentieth century. His [list of honors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor_Heyerdahl#Decorations_and_honorary_degrees) is staggering, his papers are included in the UNESCO archives, his exploits fill museum exhibitions and he has multiple documentaries made about him. He is widely hailed as a hero and admired for his perseverance and daring against all odds. there is one problem: He is terrible and you are terrible for liking him.\n\nAnd I don't mean terrible as in just bad history, I mean *actually* terrible, as in heritage denying theories to give even the most hyper of diffusionists pause. This is a bit unusual and more like my Bronze Age post than a normal /r/BadHistory post, because I want to highlight how this form of inertia works. he is so widely praised that it becomes easy to praise him ore, an forget that he was, at his core, terrible. So let's start with the UNESCO listing:\n\n&gt;World citizen, explorer, writer and scientist, Thor Heyerdahl's legacy is an archive of unusual richness that encompasses photographs, films, manuscripts and documents of historical, artistic and cultural value. They provide a unique insight into the life and work of one of the greatest communicators and renowned explorers of the 20th century, who at the same time was a source of inspiration for generations of people and scientists throughout the world. Some of unique photo and film material were collected from places that soon after would face modernisation and globalisation processes making the pictures and films documenting their transitional period even more important, both for the local communities as well as the modern world that imposed these changes upon them.\n\nThis is actually mostly true, his fame and media reach did allow for a pretty high degree of media documentation, and his excavations on Easter Island yielded important data for later researchers. But did he really \"inspire scientists\"? At least my reading is that he is pretty widely reviled in the community of Oceanic archaeologists for being yet another person to deny the heritage and unique achievements of the Polynesians. He was what is known as a \"hyperdiffusionist\", which essentially means that when he looks at a culture, he asks \"where does this come from?\" This is fine as far as it goes, origins and precedents are important and interesting, the problem is that this line of thinking always answers that a particular culture comes from somewhere else. So the Greeks come from Egypt (pretty much everything comes from Egypt, really), the Indians came from Sumeria, and the Maya came from just about everywhere.\n\nHeyerdahl specifically believed, to quote [the Kon Tiki website's biography](http://www.kon-tiki.no/en/page/thor2):\n\n&gt;Like all previous researchers, Thor found confirmation that there had been two different migrations to the Polynesian islands. Unlike the others though, he claimed that the oldest one had not arrived from Asia by canoe, but instead by balsa wood raft from South America. Such a theory proposed by a young, unknown student was too controversial, and Thor met with solid resistance from other scientists. Anthropologists the world over had based their theories on the accepted dogma that no American type of prehistoric vessel could have brought people to Polynesia alive.\n\nIt is worth noting here how the Polynesian Islands were actually peopled, because this account, naturally, is confused. The evidence, linguistic, archaeological, and genetic, is overwhelming that the Polynesians are descended from Austronesian seafarers from southeastern Asia. The exact Austronesian homeland is a matter of some debate, but Taiwan and coastal Fujian are the best candidates. Beyond that, there are three \"stages\" of the colonization of the Pacific (leaving out Micronesia, which is complicated). First there was the Paleoloithic colonization of [Near Oceania](http://www.pnas.org/content/101/24/9167/F1.large.jpg), followed by the colonization of [Remote Oceania](http://www.lapita-voyage.org/en/images/bildergalerie/karte_gr.gif) by the Lapita, who arose in the Bismark Archipelago perhaps around 2000 BCE, followed in turn by the Polynesian colonization of the so-called [Polynesian Triangle](http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/etexts/BucExpl/BucExpl010a.jpg). The distinction between the Polynesians and the Lapita is actually really difficult to draw and they are probably on and the same, although there is some debate as to this and for now it is a convenient one.\n\nDetails of this narrative can budge, but the overall form of it is utterly undeniable. And this isn't a recent theory: even before WWII the ethnographic data had always pointed towards SE Asian origins, and post WWII archaeological work simply cemented this. So when Heyerdahl sailed the Kon-Tiki in 1947, it wasn't as if it was one theory among many, it was already clear that he was dead wrong. His specific theory is that the monuments were built by voyagers from lake Titicaca in Peru who first colonized the islands, then were driven off by a second wave of migration, which came from Asia via British Columbia. His evidence was a belief that people would only follow the pacific currents, his belief that the statues in Polynesia and Peru look similar, and his belief that Polynesians look like Tlingit. He then tied this together with highly idiosyncratic readings of mythology and local origin myths.\n\nI wish I were being uncharitable in this reading, but I'm not. There isn't really a place to start with this, because it is all absurd. It is built off of his iron clad belief that people would only follow the currents. This on the face of it doesn't make sense, as there was plenty of two-way communication between island groups so clearly they sailed against the currents at some point. More to the point, it ignores the specific Polynesian method of exploration, which specifically sails against the most favorable direction so that the return voyage would be easier and quicker than the out voyage (a useful precaution if you want to get back safely!). His Kon-Tiki voyage, meanwhile, proves nothing. It demonstrated the capability of Titicaca rafts, at least when using modern navigation technology and food storage, it does not provide any evidence that this *did* happen. This is the essential flaw in popular experimental pseudoarchaeology: Experimental archaeology can tell us a great deal but only in conjunction with good evidence that it actually represents the action of past societies. Being able to sail somewhere is different than actually doing it.\n\nAnd this is all of course deeply demeaning to the Polynesians themselves, who are transformed from the inheritors of a noble history of explorers and builders to savage conquerors of the peaceful original inhabitants. Despite supporting these grossest of colonialist assertions, Heyerdahl is widely hailed as a visionary and a humanitarian. He later continued to insult the current inhabitants of the Pacific throughout his entire career to his death, either igorant or uncaring of the masses of evidence against it.\n\nA few quick notes: One, someone will point out the DNA evidence of Easter Island and the chickens of Chile. There is some intrusion of South American genetic material into Easter Island's population, but 1) this may be post-European contact, and 2) while this may provide evidence for Polynesians having brief contact with South America, it certainly does not provide any evidence for the range of Heyerdahl's assertions. The chickens are controversial, and I have seen them said to be both post-contact in date an European in origin. And, of course, the second point holds (as it does with sweet potatoes).\n\nI should also mention that I am being charitable in not discussing the Ra and Tigris expeditions.\n\nThe best introductory source on the fascinating topic of Oceanic Archaeology is Patrick Kirtch's *On the Road of the Winds*. All of the information here, and much, much more, is contained within it.",

        "text": "So I was browsing through Wikipedia, trying to not do some work, and I found myself in the article for Multiracial Americans. Clicking through for a bit, I get to [This section on \"Passing Identity\"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiracial_American#Passing_identity). According to the image and caption, J. Edgar Hoover was secretly Black and \"terrorized his biological black relatives, descendants of Emily Allen, into secrecy over the matter by having two black relatives murdered, his biological father Ivery \"Ivy\" Hoover and his daughter, his half-sister, as examples.\"\n\nThere are three citations attached to that entry. \n\nNumber one is:\n\n&gt;McGhee, Millie LePearl (2000). Secrets Uncovered: J. Edgar Hoover - Passing for White?. Allen Morris. ISBN 978-0-9701822-0-3.\n\nNumber two:\n\n&gt;[Millie L. McGhee-MOrris, James E. White, Jr. (2011). What's Done in the Dark: The Millie L. McGhee Story (DVD, Video). Inland Empire, California: Allen-Morris.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiracial_American#cite_note-McGhee-259)\n\nNumber Three is:\n\n[A youtube video that has since been removed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3iURH9mo3Q), but was originally a link to a documentary, or a trailer for the documentary, by Millie L. McGhee.\n\nSo the only two actual citations are from the same person, who, according to Amazon, also wrote story [of forbidden inter-racial love set in the 19th century (focused on the Hoover Family)](http://www.amazon.com/Drifted-Back-Time-Secrets-Revealed/dp/160462244X/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1404716373&amp;sr=1-3), and [an inspirational self-help book for women](http://www.amazon.com/Wounded-Survive-Journey-Torment-Triumph/dp/0989095703/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1404716373&amp;sr=1-1).\n\nAccording to one user review, \n\n&gt;\"After hearing the hype,I purchased this book and I must say as an african-american male,this was as offensive as it gets....instead of a true expose about the roots of the author,we get a book filled with sexual fantasies and 1 chapter about genealogy of said family.which is the only thing decent in the entire book. BUYER BEWARE\"\n\nBut after doing some googling, the only source I can find for the \"J Edgar was Black\" factoid is Millie L. McGhee-Morris. The Youtube video was presumably a link to her \"documentary.\" However, her story has the backing of [COINTELPRO conspiracy sites as well](http://www.fantompowa.net/Flame/hoover_fbi.htm)\n\nSo I decided to check the main article on good ol' J. Edgar. No mention is made of African-American ancestry, but on the talk page, it does come up, with the [\"He was secretly a black descendant of Emily Allen\" position being supported by user Bab-a-Lot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:J._Edgar_Hoover#African_American_heritage). \n\nIn their comment, Bab-A-Lot includes a link to the same youtube video as the citation I mentioned earlier, so I can assume that Bab-a-Lot is the one who added that entry. Looking at edit logs for the Multiracial Americans article, Bab-a-Lot is VERY active. I'm still slogging through the edit logs to see if Bab-A-Lot is responsible for the initial entry.\n\nOne thing sticks out for me. Bab-A-Lot says says that the research is legit, and the family tree can be traced to:\n\n&gt; a well known late Mississippi Legislator, minister and slave master Christian Hoover, Sr. born November 24, 1796, and a 16 year old slave he purchased directly off the ship from Africa.\n\nHere's the thing though. The importation of slaves from Africa into the United States was banned in 1808 by the [The Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves of 1807](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_Prohibiting_Importation_of_Slaves).\n\nMeaning that even if the ship arrived as late as the year the practice was banned, \"Master Hoover\" was only 12 when he bought J.Edgar's \"grandmother\"\n\nNot only that, but apparently the Hoovers and Allens were fans of the way the Lannisters did things. In the same comment, Bab-a-Lot gives us this:\n\n&gt;Millie's grandfather Clarence Allen inherited land from his father William Allen. William Allen's father was William Hoover, son of Christian Hoover, Sr. and his daughter-granddaughter Emily Allen, whom Christian Hoover, Sr. conceived with his biological mulatto slave daughter Elizabeth Allen, who was the daughter of Christian Hoover, Sr. and the 16 year old African slave he purchased. Then, Elizabeth Allen leaves Christian Hoover, Sr. and her daughter/sister Emily Allen, to marry Christian Hoover, Sr's (and subsequently her own) distant cousin, another relative by the name of William Hoover. Elizabeth Allen and her distant cousin William Hoover have a son name John Hoover, Emily Allen's half-brother. They move from McComb, Mississippi to the Maryland/Washington, DC area.\n\nMillie being the sole source for all of this, by the way.\n\nTo untangle this, according to Millie/Bab-a-Lot:\n\nChristian Hoover Sr. buys a 16 year old slave by the time he's twelve-years-old, and with her conceives a daughter, Elizabeth Allen. The same Christian Hoover Sr. and Elizabeth (his daughter) have yet another daughter, Emily Allen. Christian Hoover, in a bid to outdo both the Targaryens and Lannisters has a son with his daughter-granddaughter. This son is William Allen. Elizabeth Allen then leaves and marries Christian Hoover's (and by extension her own) distant cousin, a man who is also named William, but with the last name Hoover. With Christian, an \"Ivery Hoover\" is born, and he is J. Edgar's true father.\n\nKeep in mind that these 4 recursive generations occurred between a 12-year-old purchasing a slave no later than 1808, and J. Edgar's birth in 1895.\n\nNow, [J. Edgar's main page links to the American Almanac for his parentage](http://american_almanac.tripod.com/hoover.htm). And lists  Anna Marie and Dickerson Naylor Hoover, Sr. as his parents. \n\nBut checking the source, it's another article that indulges in Mille McGhee's book. According to this, when she was ten, her class was learning about J. Edgar Hoover's importance and history (Not quite sure what fourth grade class  requires the biography of the head of the FBI, but whatever), and she told her grandfather. Her grandfather then decides to let ten-year-old millie in on a family secret, a secret so dangerous that it could get them all killed. J. Edgar Hoover is young Millie's Grandfather's second cousin, and is willing to murder them all (and has already done that to a couple) to keep them quiet.\n\n[The American Almanac \"According to McGhee's account, she was so frightened that she suppressed the memory, which only gradually came back while she was writing a fantasy-story of her family's history as slaves.](http://american_almanac.tripod.com/hoover.htm).\n\nShe goes on to hire a geneologist, and the story matches records, except where it doesn't.\n\n&gt;Through his research, with some assistance from others researching the Hoover family, Ott found that some aspects of Millie's story bore a remarkable correspondence to the documentary record, but that other aspects could not be documented or corroborated.\n\n&gt;According to McGhee's account, a composite of the family's oral history, reconstructed memories, and fantasy, the Washington, D.C. Hoovers, a mixture of black and white, were related to the Mississippi Hoovers. The part of the family's oral history which was very specific, and oft-repeated, was that she and her family are descended from the union of a slave-woman and her master, which resulted in the birth of a daughter in 1814 in Virginia, named Elizabeth Allan.\n\nSince we're accepting \"reconstructed memories and fantasy\" as credible sources now, we have a solid birth date for Elizabeth Allen in 1814, making Christan Hoover Sr. 18 by then.\n\nOf course, there isn't any *evidence* to support any of this. But fantasies and the reconstructed fantasy-memories of a ten-year-old who was telling her grandfather about her fourth grade class lesson on the director of the FBI.\n\nEdit: A couple of hours after I submitted this, the Hoover entry has been removed fro the Multiracial Americans article. [Here's a screenshot of the offending entry](http://i.imgur.com/MlMoHCi.png?1?9071)\n\nEdit 2: Corrected Wikipedia Editor's username. It's Bab-a-Lot, not Bab-a-Talk.\n\nEdit 3: I found the original edit, and it was indeed user [Bab-A-Lot](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Multiracial_American&amp;oldid=564246921#Passing) It's much more tame, still citing Mcghee, but limits its claim that Hoover had a grandparent listed as \"coloured\" by the US Census. Subsequent edits, also by Bab-a-Talk, expanded this to the \"He's the secret product of 4 generations of incest and murdered has black father and black Mom-sister\"\n\nConsidering the edit pattern, I'm going to guess that Bab-a-Talk bought a copy of McGhee's reconstructed-memory-fantasy book, and edited the article as they read the book.",

I dont know if you know this but let me break it down&gt; statistically muslim famlies are pumping out 2 more kids than any other race or religion of people on our planet. they say by 2050 there will be a overwhelming massive populaition of islamic muslims in the world. If you know anything about muslims, theyre bible commands them to lie cheat and manipulate to enable their people to gain control of governments - it sounds like a conspiracy but look it up seriously, because the only form of government that is good, just and should be used because its \"perfect\" is sharia law according to their religion. muslims are the ones people should be afraid of. not in the sense of being hurt now, but for the sake of this land and the future generations of our children. we live in a democratic land which enables them to be voted into power by the people. since 2001 they have been the majority in north america. people need to seriously look at this as an issue. stand by isreal law is great.. he is a smart man\n\nFirst the bad history,[ the Crusades started because the Byzantines were desperate and asked for Western Christian help against the Seljuk Turks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Clermont) and the Crusaders used this as an excuse to \"liberate\" Jerusalem even though that was not part of the Byzantines' agenda.\n\nAlso, **Jews sided with the Muslims, not with the Christians**, [the Crusaders massacred Jews as much as they massacred Muslims](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_First_Crusade#Siege_of_Jerusalem). Given the [progroms of European Jews](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhineland_massacres) in the lead-up to the First Crusade to say that Christians and Jews were on the same side is beyond laughable.\n\n**(Other Sources: *Holy War* by Karen Armstrong)**\n___\n\nThe rest of the screed is classic post-9/11 Neoconservative Islamophobia of the Pamela Gellar type claiming that Muslims are going to outbreed us and destroy Western Civilization. Also cue bad religion about Sharia and the Koran.\n\nHe also thinks Muslims have been \"the majority in North America\" since 2001. Seriously? SERIOUSLY???\n\nI need some good scotch after this...",

        "text": "This evening I was scrolling down my Facebook feed, hoping to find something interesting. And I found it, in the form of [this post](http://imgur.com/0qfPLMH). For those of you who don't speak Italian, the post reads as follows: \n\n*70 years ago the Nazi-Fascist nightmare ended in Umbertide, on the 5 July our city [It's more of a town] was liberated from that period of terror which plagued all of Italy; I think few of us remember this date, but I believe that we shouldn't forget, we shouldn't allow a new life to this horror!  \nTHEY CALLED US BANDITS!  \nTHEY CALLED US THUGS!  \nYESTERDAY PARTISANS,  \nTODAY ANTI-FASCISTS!*  \n***\n\nAll in all, I had little problem with the post itself. It goes against Fascism, and it goes against forgetting history, so I'm fine with it. But the fun bits come in the comments. The first comment simply says \"It's even worse now than it was 70 years ago!\" [All of the comments have been translated by me], to which the poster responds: \"[redacted], we are still plagued by corrupt, do nothing politicians who thing of nothing but their own good and not that of the people; but we mustn't forget the fascist abuses and kidnappings!\"  \nAnd so it begins. He has just started an argument with one of the local fascist supporters.\n\nFirst Fascist Supporter: *What, and the partisan abuses and kidnappings should be forgotten?*  \nSecond Fascist Supporter: *But [redacted], what are you saying, what partisan abuses and kidnappings? IMPOSSIBLE. [/s]*  \n\nSo far they haven't gone into the history too much. All is calm on the historical front.\n\nPoster: *Well, if you consider your friends methods to be fine, I just can't manage to understand you! I consider what the partisans did to be right because they liberated this city and this country from this literal shit period!*\n\nAnd here begins the Bad History. I will take a break from their debate about whether Fascist/Partisan methods were right to expl ain what is wrong with the above statement.\n\nThe partisans helped quite a bit in the liberation of Italy, aiding Allied forces as they moved up through the peninsula, but to say they were the ones to liberate the country is just wrong. More specifically, to say they liberated the town I, Poster and Co. live in is ridiculous. Said town, located in the province of Perugia, was liberated by Indian troops in the British Army (3rd Punjabis, part of Tenth Infantry Brigade, in turn part of the Indian Tenth Infantry Division) in July of 1944. A report by a Lieutenant Sasson written on the situation in the Umbertide-Città di Castello area states as follows about the general situation in Umbertide:\n\n1 UMBERTIDE (Lieut. *Sasson*)  \n(a) *General*  \nThe town is partly destroyed by Allied bombing. The population has been evacuated to the country since April and is very slow in getting back home. Very few civilians are in evidence. Indian troops had been thoroughly looting the place, and this caused a very bad impression on the few remaining civilians who were eagerly awaiting the arrival of the Allies.  \nThere was no C.d.L. in the town. The A.M.G. offr appointed mayor a doctor by profession who seemed quite lost and did not know what to do and where to start.\n\n***\n\nThe same officer goes on to describe the local resistance: One nearby, I.E. operating in the area around Umbertide, and another operating near Pesaro. According to the report, the one near Umbertide had its centre at Pietralunga (Near Umbertide, but still a bit of a drive away), and was composed of 160 armed men and 280 workers. In April this group helped the American consul of Monaco Orebaugh to cross the lines. But the important part is that: \"On the 8th of July, they made contact with the first Indian troops, and for three days fought side by side with the Indians at Cima S. Pietro.\"\n\nNow you may remember that the Indian troops had entered the town on the fifth. Therefore, if they had met up with the Indians on the 8th, they cannot have been at all involved in the liberation of Umbertide.\n\nI in no way want to belittle the bravery of the Italian partisans, who fought German occupation very well, and aided the Allied effort in Italy by disrupting German lines of communication, along with killing large numbers of German soldiers (The group I mentioned claimed to have inflicted three hundred casualties on the Germans, destroying 18 bridges, and losing 37 men).  \nBut.  \nThe belief that the Allies stood on the sidelines and applauded (Or, in the case of Umbertide, bombed the town and killed a load of civilians), while the wonderful (Or, for the Fascist supporters, awful) partisans liberated the country from the German jackboot seems to be a prevalent belief among Italians, and I think that to make that claim is to belittle and demean the hundreds of thousands of men who fought and died in the Allied armies that struggled through Sicily and up the peninsula, and put an end to the Fascist regime, and to the German occupation.\n\nAnd it is also Bad History.\n\n***\n\nI'm not good at doing sources, but the quotes from Lieut. Sasson can be found on pages 198-199 of the book Perugia Liberata, which is a collection of the Anglo-American documents appertaining to the Allied occupation of Perugia and its surroundings.",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/29xp78/more_bad_americas_history/",
        "text": "Yesterday I posted a pretty lousy post about (IMO) negligent Americas history in /r/ELI5, and today I found a very similar post on my front page - this time from /r/showerthoughts.\n\nThe main problem that constitutes this new thread was passively mentioned in my post yesterday - directly comparing Americas history to European history, and dismissing one for the other.\n\nNow, in this case, the \"shower thought\" specifically refers to the United States, and not the Americas, so that's one thing. But the commentaries that arise don't seem to stick to the same distinction - they compare the United States to, say, \"Europe,\" or \"France,\" which has only been the state of France for so many centuries. Is the history of Gaul the same as France? Is the prehistory of France the same as France? If so, then where does the line end for the Americas? Is the Iroquois Confederacy the same thing as New England? Is our pre-history the same as our current history?\n\nI don't know, really. Bear with me on this one.\n\n[The U.S. is so young that in the distant future people will think of our current time as still the very early stages of America's birth and growth as a nation. ](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/29w8wt/the_us_is_so_young_that_in_the_distant_future/)\n\nNevermind the truthfulness of this statement itself, I'm more interested in the reaction to it.\n\n&gt;One thing that Americans have not yet really experienced as a people is a real change of regimes. For nearly all of American history, which is a relatively short period of time, Americans have had the same government. As long as there have been Americans, the current government has existed.\n\n&gt;Now if you compare that to other peoples around the world, Americans stand out. There have been French people, loosely defined, in the land currently known as France since about the Fall of Rome. Their national identity has changed over time, and they have seen countless political entities rise and fall. Governments come and go but there have (almost) always been French people. You can see similar scenarios around the world, in England, China, Japan, and Russia to name a few prominent examples.\n\n&gt;Americans, on the other hand, have only known one government, and their national identity is strongly tied to that polity. It is telling that in American media that depicts the future, the government has typically been replaced by a totalitarian regime, or utter anarchy. Americans don't seem to consider the possibility that something better, or simply different, could replace the status quo.\n\nI can find interest in the notion of consistent vs. dynamic forms of government. However, the sudden veer into France - dating back to \"the Fall of Rome,\" starts to make me a little uncomfortable. I'm not sure it's altogether productive to say \"The French have been French for a millenium, even though little about France has been France.\"\n\nAlso, the notion that American history starts with the Constitution is screwy as well, but I'm not interested in that.\n\n&gt;I applaud you. No, really, I do. I don't know if you are American or not, although I do wish it; because if there's one thing I think americans, if not the rest of the world, needs to keep in mind (especially in this time of festivity and 4th of July). It's that America is young. Very, very, VERY young.\n\n&gt;Now I'm no Americana expert or historian, but the birth of the United States of America was around 200 years ago; which I think everyone will agree is rather short. Some others will even argue that it's history dates back to Columbus, 500 years ago. Yet, that's still small; not as small I'll grant you that, but small nonetheless.\n\n&gt;There's a reason Europe is called the \"old continent\". 3,000. Three, THOUSAND years of history at the bare minimum. Which, if my math isn't completely off, corresponds to around 6 times that of the largest estimate, and 15 times of the lowest. And don't get me started on Mesopotamia and Egyptians; or heck, the Chinese; which boast around 4,500 thousand years of history; however vague it may be.\n\n&gt;And for those wondering why I wrote all this, it's to respond simultaneously to the other commenters who believe otherwise.\n\nThis fucking guy... This is the real problem. They applaud our bold redditor for recognizing that America is young - America is only 200-500 years old. Europe, of course? 3,000 years at the MINIMUM.\n\nThis is not a strong view. If we can look at 3,000 years of \"German\" history and draw meaningful connections between then and now, despite how extremely non-similar various stages of German \"history\" are through three millennia, then why does American history come to a full stop with European arrival? Why doesn't the millenia of native history before that count for anything? \n\n\"Don't get me started on Mesoptamia.\" Okay, well, don't get me started on the Iroquois language group! \n\nThe simple thing is, geographically speaking, almost all parcels of land on the planet have millenia of human-civilization history to them. You have to go way, way, WAY back to get significant differences in timeframe. This entire discussion - and the previously quoted comment - rely on distinguishing the political dynamic of the nation state and its people from the geographical dynamic. However, if we're going to decouple American history from the history of the Americas, we need to perform the same surgery on other histories. I mean, just to stick a pin in it somewhere, what's to stop me from saying German history starts in 1990? Or maybe 1949? Maybe 1815? Or were the members of the Holy Roman Empire \"Germans?\"\n\nHow about Italy? Are modern Italians part of Imperial Rome, or does Italian history only go to 1861? \n\nPersonally, I think it's productive to speak of Italian history as going well before the Roman empire. However, I also find it productive to speak of American history in greater terms than \"1776.\"\n\nSome of the responses to the previous comment claim that they are wrong, because America doesn't actually exist - it is just a continuation of European history. If *this* is true, and we can safely neglect basically all independently American history, then Germany and, say, England, sure as *fuck* don't exist.\n\nWhich gives us the OP digging in even deeper:\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;That's seeing history on it's Grand scale, the World scale. Which, granted, is really how it should be seen. The history of all of us (to quote a certain series on Nat/geo); yet I made my point solely on a country to country point of view; which is a different thing entirely. However, it must be noted the two answers are not incompatible (at least in my opinion).\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;I still stay besides my point that, if not country speaking (Modern germany IS technically 100 years old, well actually 50ish to some) regionally speaking, there is a personal history that is longer then that in America. Although I have to note my own close-mind when I say that before europeans came to the land, there was no history (Obviously this is false, the Americas has had a rich Native American Culture; which would be interesting to go over in history lessons); there is still one point that stands: some regions have been actively OCCUPIED, have had a longer history then others. Not always by the same people, this is true especially for China, who has swayed in the hands of many ethnic groups before settling with the Han Dynasty; nevertheless it is IT's history.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;But I do fully agree on the fact that the US is a continuation of Europe history; or rather that it branches off of it. However, having studied a few years in America, in grade school were we are taught history, this is not a point that is stressed enough; and that was the main reason for this rant; the lack of awareness of such a rich heritage. Restricting yourselves to those 200 to 500 years of history seems a bit off; and turning it into a cult of patriotism is even worse; but that's beside my main point.\n\nThey even reference the inconsistencies in their historical reckoning, and then just dismiss it altogether. Sure, SURE, there was history in America before the Euopeans - but they didn't actively OCCUPY the regions known as \"America,\" and because of REASONS, China has IT'S history, Europe has IT'S, but America, and Native Americans, they don't have IT.\n\nThis person - apparently a Frenchman - goes on next to rant about how France is France and that's HISTORY FOR YA. Although, the person they are replying to doesn't seem to be making a very strong point either. I'm not even sure what they're really arguing about even. Something about stereotypes and baguettes.\n\nWhy does this person feel so strongly?\n\n&gt;I, personally, do think that americans are brought up in their country with a very \"we are number 1#\" attitude. Which by all means is fine, every country as their views on the world; but that being said, sometimes views can be misleading and lead to misinformation and disinformation. Again, in my opinion and through personal experience, I've observed that this turns into true blue patriotism (which again is fine, one should be proud of his roots/country) but also leads to the phrase: We have the GREATEST history; we are THE country; stereotypes etc etc etc...\n\n&gt;So in all honesty, the reason I said americans need to keep this in mind, is because I feel a couple of them are simply not realistic in terms of scale. America HAS lived through a lot in it's history (the 500 year old one AND the 200 year old one); but I feel we should still be paying respects/reming ourselves of the other civilisations that have lived much longer and consequently lived through more.\n\n&gt;Note: The quantity or quality of history that a country or region may possess is not indicative of it's value; I'm just putting things into perspective.\n\nAh. Americans are dumb, of course. We simply haven't experienced the perspective of thousands of years of history. You see, the French? They've been French for basically ever. They're a real people with real history. America? Just America, really. Barely even that. We should pay our respects to the histories of REAL civilizations that have been around \"much longer\" - as long as they aren't American, of course, like the entire history of pre-European America.\n\nAnd then again:\n\n&gt;It so happens that I am a Frenchman myself so I can fill you in that particular subject. Let it be know that we we're part of the roman empire near the year 0; that's a long time ago; I wouldn't need to go that far to prove my point.\n\n&gt;First off; I have to highlight this point as it seems I have yet to do so: I'm not talking about the length of time a regime stays in place; but a common idea of a people; a group of individuals that possess patriotism towards their country; however or whoever is leading it. You mentioned Napoleon; back home he was considered a hero for his military prowess. Back Home. Home here, would be the culmination of every region bound to French history (and more prominently, language). That's why at that time, I don't consider the North of Italy has France, although it technically was through conquest.\n\n&gt;Building upon that, this vague idea of people, at least in France, dates to our kings, which we have ample generations of. Yes, we butchered them in the end, but not in the name of a new country, in the name of our right to eat food. In my opinion, and this might be the problem, it's only my opinion; changing from all those Kingdoms, to an actual Democratic Republic; going through an empire... Those build up a common history to our France of today.\n\n&gt;Now, unto United States. Yes, it most certainly has been a thing since Native Americans got there. But keep it mind that was around the year 1000 (if not mistaken, since I believe the Aztec Wars were around that time, and that some Peruvian forces fled to calmer plains due to them) which is still relatively smaller then Europe's History. But that's not a bad thing and as others have pointed out, History is a global concept we all share; i'm just dividing it up country to country for the sake of making my point.\n\n&gt;Note: France wasn't taken by Germanic Tribes, our Brittany (the Triden thing) was for a long time a. independent b. before that, owned by Gaelic Tribes.\n\nFUCK! How bad can it get?! Suddenly we're not talking about the history of states, or populations, or landmasses, but now we're merely into strict nationalism. Way to constantly re-define your terms. And on top of that, France hasn't been part of Rome since 0 AD? Bullshit! And on top of that, France has better history because they have a history of rejecting monarchy - as though America didn't fucking reject a king once upon a time?\n\nAnd on top of THAT, the worst of all: \"Yes, it most certainly has been a thing since Native Americans got there. But keep it mind that was around the year 1000 (if not mistaken, since I believe the Aztec Wars were around that time, and that some Peruvian forces fled to calmer plains due to them) which is still relatively smaller then Europe's History.\"\n\nY'all, American history goes back a fuck ton farther than \"around the year 1000.\" I mean, they even contextualize it as \"Aztec Wars\" - what, like Aztecs and Peruvians and Wars just sprung fully-formed from the earth in 1000 AD, and nothing existed before then? Because *that makes sense,* sure.\n\n&gt;That's the start of the Republic, which has risen and collapsed and been replaced by a new monarchy and a new Republic and a new new Republic etc.\nBut it was all France.\n\n&gt;&gt;But why not apply that logic to the Native Americans then? New government, new people, still America.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Well, still the land mass that was called America by white people, but the natives have always, and still do, consider themselves independent nations.\nThey never considered themselves Americans, they were Sioux or Iroquois or what have you, and many still retain their separate national identities. The American nation would then be a foreign invader.\n\nAt this point, it's like, why? Why is everyone so insistent on defining things in such a way that Europe has le extensive deep history of magic, while America has nothing? Pre-Colombian nations don't count because \"they were independent,\" but France? No, they were all always French, forever. No such divisions ever existed. Burgundians - what?\n\n But it isn't even always about the native populations, we don't need them in order to dismiss American history:\n\n&gt;Our government, though, is actually one of the older ones in the world. Think about how many revolutions, invasions, and unifications have taken place around the world in the last few centuries.\n\n&gt;&gt;I believe I've stated this somewhere else, but nevertheless, let me reiterate. Democracy, your current government; is something that spread around the world at very specific point in time; and not only to America, but every single country in existence. Granted it did not always have such an impact; but in a lot of cases, it did. Surely, The US's government is an old one; I believe that MANY countries afflicted with the Democracy Disease (Just used as a metaphor for multiplicity and infection, democracy is of course positive) possess a government just as old as the US of A. Which is something I rarely hear credited to other nations, sadly.\n\nUhhhh ok then, France is real and America doesn't seem to even exist.\n\nE:\n\nIt goes on and on in that thread.\n\n&gt;I don't really consider the US very young. We are like a branch of a river that broke off from the main trunk (Europe), but essentially came from the same cultural source waters. Also in the era of nation states we are one of the oldest.\n\nThe US doesn't exist except as part of Europe - American history is merely European history.\n\n&gt;&gt;The history of the US goes back 250-500 years. The history of China around 4,500 years. US(and our government make up) is really quite young.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;But if we want to play that game, China is a kid compared to African culture. And Europe is a baby compared to both. But ultimately I don't think that approach accomplishes much. It's like a middle aged man comparing himself to a 95 year old in order to feel young.\nI was simply saying that the U.S. was for all practical purposes an offshoot of Europe (the US revolution was essentially an English civil war) and so our cultural history extends back further than it might seem.\n\nAhh, of course. \"African culture.\" And the strange, demanding twist that \"Listen up, guys, America has a very long, deep history\" - *because it's merely European history!*\n\n&gt;As a French that's something that always puzzled me a bit. I have high respect for USA and its people (WWI/II and all) but to read about \"American history\" and how it seems so far away for you guys is always a bit funny. Sorry to say but the Founding Fathers, Independence and all (we are talking about USA here, not the American continent history right?) is like the penultimate chapter or something in our history school books. I guess its all a matter of perspective, I guess we also do not learn all the details of it but go for a more broad approach compared to you guys.\nIn the same way my Chinese wife thinks I am cute with my \"old\" history and legends... \"Charlemagne? That's like yesterday's news!\"... :)\n\nwhich continues to:\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Absolutely no \"bragging\" here, sorry if that sounded like that, as you said not like I contributed to it. Its just a different point of view with some Americans' friends I have, stuff happening in the 19th Century is very old for them, its considered \"Modern History\" here.\n\nI don't really know how to R5 this stuff anymore, at this point I might as well be posting in /r/circlebroke. It's just bugging me how everyone is so goddamned smug with their \"ancient history,\" even though none of these positions are exactly consistent with themselves. And if a modern Frenchman can freely claim Roman history, can I as a modern American freely claim Cherokee history because it's relevant to my location in space and time?\n\n&gt;The US is not the only superpower. You still have Russia and China.\nMost European nations are old, very old. Norway for example, is over a thousand years old. Same goes for Portugal, Britain, France and all the major Euro-nations.\nOf course, Italy was a bunch of city states, but Modern Italy itself formed when one of those states conquered the entirety of Northern Italy, which doesn't necessarily mean that the country has no history. The Land, however, has plenty of history. There was countries there before even the Roman Empire was a thing.\n\nOutright wrong. France is not over a thousand years old. Neither is Britain. Beats me about Norway.\n\nAnd then they swap conditions back from \"nationalism\" to \"The Land,\" which has \"plenty of history.\" \n\nIf *that's* the case, then Americans can *absolutely* claim millennia of Pre-Colombian history. But our ancient empires weren't called Rome, so they don't really exist, either.\n",

Whether this matters or is even true isn't to be addressed in this post, but what I would like to tackle is the sheer misunderstanding of how both history works and how it relates to the present that exists in this video.\n\nFirstly, in response to the New York Times article's statement that the Abbasid Caliphate \n&gt; thrived on multiculturalism, science, innovation, learning and culture\n\nthe video's host, Cenk, after first dubiously claiming that this Caliphate was the most powerful state in the world at the time declares that\n\n&gt;They were winning at the time because they cared about science, because they were more modern than Europe was at the time.\n\nThis comes dangerously close to chartism and tech-tree history here, but the real kicker in my opinion is the bizarre mixture of presentism, a whiggish understanding of history, simultaneous eurocentrism and anti-eurocentrism, and a seeming belief in progress being competitive. The last of these is most interesting as history and progress are related to each other only in that they take place over time. Furthermore, progress itself is non-linear and rarely fueled by grand-scale cultural clashes.\n\nThere isn't really much else to say about this except to note that I've recently realised that *a lot* of people view history as nothing more than a tool to win arguments, which is mildly infuriating!\n\nAlso, I have a new favourite badhistory quote:\n\n&gt;Look into it, fix your face, learn history!",

I may be wrong, but intuitively it is not satisfying. The entire Americas certainly had trade systems, between many states, confederacies, and empires - or as the OP said, \"adjacent tribes.\" \n\nThe basic problem was that the Americas lacked big ships and \"seafaring traditions,\" despite the fact that there were seafaring people in the Americas. [Here's a random example of prehistoric settlements in California.](http://westerndigs.org/11000-year-old-seafaring-indian-sites-discovered-on-california-island/) And it's not like no one on the east coast had boats or ever \"fared sea.\"\n\nI reject \"they lacked big ships\" as a satisfactory explanation of the question, and I find the general conception that the Americas lacked international economies to be a major misconception. Like when someone on reddit goes \"Europe is so cool, you have ancient history right in your streets, America is just so young and boring by comparison,\" rudely neglecting literal millenia of extremely diverse and fascination human civilizations. \n\nAnyway, for a new-level of historical misconception, check out one of the other answers:\n\n&gt;Natural selection, survival of the fittest.\n\n\"Because Darwin said so, that's why.

Grant. He refused to carry on a guerrilla war as requested by Jefferson Davis and see his beloved south ravaged even further.\nThe war didn't just end, the North won fair and square. The south was being economically strangled from the outside (no trade partners to speak of), and from within (scorched earth policies from vengeful union commanders). Their army was vastly smaller than the north and had lost the initiative it had in the first couple years. The confederacy was split in two down the Mississippi, and many major cities (like Atlanta, burned to the ground by Sherman) had been lost. The south very much lost that war, in every sense of the word.\n\n/r/Askhistorians explains well how the north won in every conceivable way to consider it, but I can't wrap my head around how someone could claim it \"just ended\". I want to understand the tortured logic, anyone talk to one of these people before?\n\nI want to know if anyone has had someone explain \"the war just ended\".

        "text": "A few people have sent [this post for my comment.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/29qtbe/no_land_for_whites_in_zimbabwe_says_mugabe/cinzecq)  It's in a larger thread that annoys me because it contains elements of truth but then goes off to the \"Black people can't farm\" and \"Legal ownership obtained under a discriminatory land regime, created under threat of violence, was perfectly just.\"  I've stopped drinking, so sadly you will all have to drink for me.  Land in Zimbabwe and South Africa is a huge lightning rod for political battles.  It's wrapped up in politics and not a little mythology, both in promoting and opposing land reform, and it's the handmaiden of a LOT of badhistory.  \n\nBut we're here for the SA comment now.  The first thing that's important to note is that apartheid was a discriminatory legal system, built on earlier systems of segregation and the limitation of access, that confined black ownership and eventually citizenship to a few small and crowded areas in SA that had been too heavily populated to conquer and parcel out to whites.  These areas were simply not capitalized effectively, and although apartheid rhetoric claimed they were preserving \"Bantu culture\" so they could develop along \"their own lines\" between 1951 (Bantu Authorities Act) and 1991 (Repeal of Racially Based Measures Act), what they actually created were dependent client states that were never viable, run by \"tribal authorities\" they divined, empowered, and backed up--to the point that those authorities still fight to hold on to those almost dictatorial privileges in so-called traditional societies.  To suggest this was fair and free separation requires that we ignore a history of colonization, subjugation, dispossession, and disempowerment that goes back to the 1830s (when Bantu-speakers could first enter the Cape Colony on a permanent basis) if not before.\n\nNow, the comment itself:\n\n&gt;That's [domination/subjugation] not what apartheid was about but don't let the facts stop you. \n\n&gt;EDIT: You can keep fucking downvoting me but apartheid was about separation.\n\nThe comment is right that apartheid was about separation *on paper*.  But it quickly became apparent to everyone that separation was a fig leaf--and that white South Africa and its industries were so utterly dependent on black labor that that by the 1960s even Minister for Native Affairs / Prime Minister Dr. Hendrik Verwoerd, widely recognized as the architect of apartheid and its most coherent theorist (not that it was a high bar, mind you) was pushing \"separate development\" as a better term because \"apartheid\" had become so poisoned outside of the Afrikaner nationalist movement.  The lie was also evident to Professor F. R. Tomlinson, whose famous Commission report on development in Bantu areas (so long it required a condensed version, U.G.61-'1955) suggested massive investment in the areas designated as \"black\" but also a clear termination of all crossing of the lines by migrant labor and so forth; SABRA (South African Board of Racial Affairs) came to the same conclusions, that apartheid was unworkable without a sacrifice of cheap black labor; and even people in the normally quite nationalist Dutch Reformed Church objected to apartheid policy on the basis that it was racist at its heart and un-Christian.  They all said that if the goal was true separation and \"development along each group's own lines,\" then white people must be required to sacrifice the servants and workers they depended on.  This made Verwoerd angry enough that he threatened Tomlinson with blacklisting if he ever discussed the Commission's findings again, he purged SABRA of the dissenting sciences, and he even put pressure on the NGK and NHK (Nederduitse Gereformeerde Kerk and Nederduitse Hervormde Kerk) to stay out of politics, which some like Beyers Naudé refused to do anyhow.  \n\nVerwoerd was a true believer, and figured the migrancy would just stop if he got rid of all the blacks--he sought in the 1950s to close Johannesburg's townships, and ran smack dab into industrial capitalism that told him to fuck off.  (David Welsh's *The Rise and Fall of Apartheid* (2011) is very good on this; he lived through most of that period and is an actual historian.)\n\nI will leave aside the fact that homeland policy--grand apartheid--was only one part of the whole; petty apartheid, the day to day restrictions and harassment of nonwhites (and sometimes whites), was arguably much more threatening to people.\n\nBut there's other mythology hiding in here too.  In order:\n\nOP doesn't have his facts straight when talking about the homelands.  If he's South African, he's from way up on the fucking highveld, because he gets the government line on \"tribes in homelands\" correct up there.  But he says this:\n\n&gt;Transeki - Zhisa\n\n&gt;Ciskie - Xhosa\n\nBeyond the misspelling of Ciskei, the Xhosa paramountcy/kingship (insofar as there is just one; Mpondo, Mpondomise, Qwati, Thembu, and other royal houses would disagree with that) is on the Transkeian side, near Gatyana, and is specifically broken into amaNgqika (who used to be on the Ciskeian side) and amaGcaleka lineages.  Ciskeian reserve areas are also isiXhosa-speaking, but they are generally made up of people identified as \"Fingoes\" or amaMfengu--an identity formed by their position as functionaries of the old colonial state.  Who the hell are \"Zhisa?\"  '\n\nBut all of the \"homeland list\" names ignore the fluidity of identidies in South Africa.  Gerhard Maré did a nice book on tribalism and politics in SA--this idea that \"you belong in a homeland, and this is your tribe\" was an alien one until the power of the South African state grew to the point that accepting it was the only defensive strategy left against it--if you were an independent person with no affiliation, you had no network, no community, and no access to whatever shared resources might exist.  But that also put you under the thumb of the indirect-rule systems the South Africans created and made you even more dependent on finding income through migrant labor.  The homelands were labor reservoirs, which is exactly what most apartheid supporters really wanted; the cover of \"policy\" and \"intent\" were very useful for convincing the majority that grand apartheid was a noble enterprise of parentage or tutelage.\n\n&gt;70% of South Africa is uninhabitable. Only 10% is under normal climate conditions for economically viable farmland. All of the Homelands were built in ares of South Africa that receive higher than average rain fall. All of the Homelands were created in what were historically tribal lands. Homelands made up 50% percent of the total, liveable land in South Africa. Not the 13% people like to throw around.\n\nSome of this is correct--the first two sentences.  The third is wrong for Boputhatswana at least (see Nancy Jacobs, *Environment, Power, and Injustice: A South African History*), and big chunks of Venda too.  It should be pointed out that boreholes made a lot more land potentially usable, and that \"conditions for economically viable farmland\" ignores the very important point that *livestock farming doesn't require the same conditions*.  In the areas where agricultural conditions were poor, herding was a far more significant part of life, for whites as well as nonwhites.  The homelands indeed made up a significant chunk of the arable land, more than 13%, but it wasn't all like that--not by a long shot.  What's more, that land quickly exhausted, because until the arrival of Europeans there was enough land for shifting cultivation with indefinite fallow, and unlike white farmers, Bantu-speaking cultivators received no subsidies from the government to repair and renew their land.  The betterment and conservation schemes of the 1940s and 1950s led to the massive killing or forced sale of black-owned livestock to \"save\" the land.  This was actually anticipated during early reserve policy efforts; the magistrate of Idutywa, CGH Bell, in the 1890s said quite clearly that he expected the land to provide a diminishing return and force more people into migrant labor.  That tendency continued, even though it, like other aspects of apartheid, had plenty of true believers who really meant well in these paternal acts of destruction.\n\n&gt;Moreover, 20K white South Africans were forced to relocate to allow for the creation of the Homelands.\n\nThese were the \"white spots.\"  Their numbers are dwarfed by the nonwhites removed from \"black spots,\" often in the dead of night by bulldozers with only an hour at most to collect everything.  Whites removed in this way also received compensation more generous than what forced removals gave nonwhites--often nonwhites were stuck in some township or thrown into a homeland they'd never been part of.  That said, I agree that claims for land restitution by whites dispossessed during the apartheid era must be taken seriously, and I also agree that the land reform process--highly politicized and disappointing to virtually everyone involved--has not done so.\n\nThen there's a little section on Soweto, and a magnificent strawman argument built around the belief that those who saw injustice in apartheid didn't understand it and thought it was plantation slavery.\n\n**But then there's this gem, which is unadulterated bullshit and pure badhistory.**\n\n&gt;[Segregation and apartheid] started because the Boers were tired of having their families murdered by tribal blacks that showed up 150 years after Cape Town was founded. 150 years. The Boers weren't out there stealing land from anyone or any tribe. That didn't stop them from being targeted again, again, and again by the tribes, at first, and the English, second.  None of that even begins to touch on that fact that tribes showed up in South Africa, there were, already living and working there ... :\n\nWrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.  \n\nFirst of all, Portuguese travelers encountered Bantu-speakers east of the Kei River as early as the 1510s; names we can recognize of major kings start appearing in the early 1700s.  But more than that, even the anthropologists of the apartheid era itself recognized that mixed farmers were well south of the Limpopo before 1000.  The presence of Mapungubwe on the Limpopo alone (and the proto-Sotho hilltop compounds in North-West) attests to this, but the Bokoni Complex in Mpumalanga and a variety of other locales show very clearly the existence of extended networks of trade and communication throughout the eastern half of the country by 1500 at the very latest.  [edit: Mitchell's *Archaeology of Southern Africa* (2002) has some of this in condensed form, though volume one of the *Cambridge History of SA* does too.]\n\nBut even permitting that, the comment indicates an entitlement to all of present-day South Africa based on the existence of Cape Town and the Cape Colony--which was quite small until the 19th century.  It wouldn't matter if people *did* cross the Limpopo that late; they were in possession of the land when white settlers arrived on it where they were.  The comment makes it sound like South Africa was one entity, whole and complete, in 1800; got news for you, Cape Town and Graaff-Reinet aren't the whole of South Africa, bru.  Ironically, opponents of land restitution and reform are perfectly happy to ignore this primacy of habitation when it suits them, namely their seizure of grazing and hunting lands from Khoesan people who were *undeniably* in the region first--and who died in droves from smallpox, or else were incorporated to the colonial economy as underlings in the ancestry of some of the so-called \"Cape Coloured\" population.  \n\nThis myth of simultaneous or later invasion by nonwhites is part of what's known to historians as the \"Myth of the Empty Land.\"  (The post doesn't bring up the other major chunk, the so-called *mfecane* or depopulating/scattering wars attached to Shaka, so I'll leave that aside.)  This myth is an important piece of white settler lore, and it's complete bullshit.  (See Clifton Crais's article \"The Vacant Land\" from the *Journal of Social History* in Winter 1991 if you want more on its effects on racial ideology.)  The white settlers who took over the land did so by legal artifice, claiming over 25 square kilometers per male head of household, on the basis that the land was in disuse or not being used adequately--even though the new settlers also couldn't use the land without hiring poorer white sharecroppers (*bywoners*) or coercing black tenants to provide it.  As for the English victimizing the poor, poor Boers, that's usually universalizing the experience of the highveld Boers during the South African War (1899-1902) in the internment/concentration camp system even though the vast majority of Afrikaners remained loyal to the Crown during the war.  Only later, when manufacturing Afrikaner nationalism, did that become an ethnic experience for wags like Bok van Blerk to invoke so wistfully.\n\nThen there's the whole \"tribes were murdering us\" schtick.  When it happened, it was usually the opposite, and it had to be forced by something.  African kingdoms in the interior saw whites as potentially very useful allies, and helpful in their trade with the coasts, and generally assaulted colonists only when they saw an immediate threat to land and livelihoods.  Sometimes it was quite precipitous, even deceitful (such as the Zulu king Dingane's murder of Piet Retief's party), but that ignores the significant number of *trekboers* who made local arrangements with African rulers to live and travel among their towns.  **Apartheid wasn't openly based on the violence argument, and suggesting it was actually undercuts the \"separate development\" point.**\n\nBut yeah, there is so much pernicious and demonstrably false badhistory in that one line that my head hurts.  Hey, OP, go pick up Hermann Giliomee and Bernard Mbenga's *Nuwe Geskiedenis van Suid-Afrika*.  I dare you to call Hermann fucking Giliomee, author of *The Afrikaners* (in English *and* Afrikaans), a revisionist apologist.  It's written well and is accessible.\n\n&gt;Was it bad? Yes. Should it have ended? Yes. And it would have ended sooner had the Cubans and Soviets not gone hell-bent for leather to roll through Angola. Every person with half a brain knows that there were literally dozens of strong, black, political leaders trying to work with the Apartheid government for change. What happened to them all? The ANC killed them or drove them out. That's what happened. Communism was the goal and violent takeover was the intention.\n\nWho were these black leaders?  Heads of the homelands?  I've got news for you: they're still in positions of authority--and remarkably persistent at defending their privilege.  The ANC didn't kill or drive them out, unless Mangosuthu Buthulezi is some kind of revenant spirit (I will not rule this out however).  This model that \"Apartheid saved SA from communism because Cuba and the USSR in Angola!\" is propaganda bullshit.  The MPLA were bastards who broke the power-sharing arrangement in Angola, yes.  But we know *for a fact* that US and South African ops were in play before the Cubans even showed up, thanks to US documents declassified in 2002.  They were a response to us--and to Vorster's SA government--not the other way around.  \n\n&gt;Just stop. Countries don't spend 55% of their budget supporting a collective group of people if they're truly just interested in crushing them. If South Africa had wanted to crush them it would have and it could have.\n\nThey do, if they're dependent on that group of people for the 40+% of budget that benefits less than 20% of the population and also provides them with labor to make even more money.  South Africa didn't want to crush them because it was demonstrated visibly by 1970 that the country could not function without cheap black labor and private industry wouldn't permit it (much less all the families with their housekeepers and nannies).  But beyond that, South Africa couldn't crush them--policies from \"local government\" to \"Bantu authorities\" to apartheid homelands all were aimed at deflecting rural black discontent that they could not afford to deal with.  Even in the case of the Border Wars the poster points to, the only way SA could maintain force levels was to begin incorporating nonwhites and women (the latter in non-com roles).  By 1985, 30% of the SADF was nonwhite.  The point the post makes about apartheid not aiming to destroy blacks? 100% correct.  Did the SA government give partial subsidies to the homelands, eventually?  Yes.  But the reasons were not altruistic--it did involve immiseration, and there was a major return on state investment because **South Africa's economy was and still is dependent on cheap black labor**.  Even though there are now some darker faces among the ruling classes, that fact remains--but that problem is another chapter of the story.\n\nApartheid had two faces: one that claimed equality with separation in theory, and one that facilitated subordination and subjugation in fact.  The two coexisted, and OP wants to take the discordant and disjointed justifications and claims while ignoring the actual effects.  Ask a black person who lived under apartheid and wasn't in a position of authority what it was like.  The fear that some skittish South African whites feel today is a dim shadow of what nonwhites faced under apartheid.  The comment is right in saying \"apartheid wasn't some kind of Nazi plantation caricature and was a complex thing\" but it goes utterly off the rails after that.  Read Welsh's book; read Giliomee/Mbenga; hell, read the two volumes of the *Cambridge History of South Africa* (2009 &amp; 2011).  \n\nHell, this got rambly.  Maybe Zim will come later, maybe not.  It's always surprising to me how the descendants of privileged settlers in those settler societies can claim that the measures meant to dispossess, cordon, and then somehow \"make it up to\" people who were on the land first were just cool and dandy and totally justified.\n\n[edits: grammar where not good ook ook ook]  ",

        "text": "Let me preface this by saying that I'm far from an expert in this field; I'll quite happily take corrections to any misconceptions I may hold as well.\n\nWith the disclaimer out of the way, let's dig into the very special gentleman and/or lady quoted in the title. Our tale begins in [an article on io9](http://io9.com/archaeologists-uncover-a-trove-of-rare-inca-calculating-1596906974) about a discovery of a number of quipu/khipu in Peru. I assume most people are familiar with these nifty devices, but for those who aren't, they are cords knotted in specific patterns as a means of recording numbers and potentially other information, and were used by the Inka (or Inca--I'm not totally sure which spelling is considered more correct, or if both are used equally these days).\n\nIn the comments, I happened across someone referencing Jared Diamond and *Guns, Germs, and Steel* and how he speculated that one reason the Inka fell so easily to the Spanish was the lack of a written literary tradition warning about treachery. I don't know enough about this topic to be able to respond, but I remarked that they certainly had oral traditions, and that it seemed the bigger factors were that the Inka had just been coming off of a divisive civil war and had been ravaged by disease. All in all, a normal and pleasant interaction.\n\nThen the other guy came in, responding to the original poster.\n\n&gt; Umm they fell so easily because they had an extremely primitive culture. Stop revising history. Diamond has a few worthwhile points, but his story is about 3% of the story.\n\n&gt; The traditional story, \"These were primitive peoples who didn't even utilize the freaking wheel!\", is still 97% of the story. But we don't want to hurt people's feelings so we pretend that these cultures that compare unfavorably to Ancient Egypt were somehow on a par with 15th century Europe.\n\nI know there's quite a few people around here that reject Diamond's work for not incorporating enough factors (his apparent disregard for human agency is one I've heard cited a lot), but this is the first time I've ever seen somebody rejecting Diamond for going too far in the first place! But I think it's pretty obvious from looking at recent literature and discoveries that modern historians don't make such claims out of some fear of \"hurt[ing] people's feelings\", but rather because we've made many discoveries in recent years that have led historians to re-examine what we thought we knew about pre-Columbian America. This is how historical inquiry is supposed to work--you continually look for more evidence and if the new evidence doesn't line up with the old ideas, you reconsider the old ideas to determine whether or not they were accurate in the first place.\n\nIn this case, historians have largely rejected the idea that the Inka, etc. were \"primitive peoples\" with \"an extremely primitive culture\", based on the mountains of evidence that no, actually, they had complex cultures with advancements in many areas we did not previously recognize.\n\nThere's also the unfounded idea that you can somehow compare cultures directly. How, exactly, do you compare the Inka to Ancient Egypt (a pretty nebulous term, as that covers a good couple millennia of history) to 15th-century Europe (which should be 16th century, anyway--Pizarro's conquest of the Inka was in the early 1500s)? They're completely different cultures, with different religions, with different political systems, in different biomes, with different philosophies, with different military techniques... they didn't even eat the same kinds of *food.* By what measurement can we objectively (or even *sub*jectively) compare these three cultures? There is no real way to do this, and you'll notice that the poster doesn't even make an attempt to defend his position--he simply states it as if it's so incredibly *obvious* that the Inka were primitive (another ill-defined term), clearly any sensible person should believe him.\n\nAnd, of course, the new slur \"revision\" gets thrown out, as if it's a bad thing to revise your ideas based on new information.\n\nIn all my ranting, I've skipped over his claim about the wheel, which is possibly the most obvious of his misconceptions. I feel that the other things I've talked about are more insidious errors, but let's talk about the wheel. It's true, we have no evidence that the Inka ever developed the wheel. And it seems to be a very basic invention, to anyone from a Eurasian cultural background. So what, were they just stupid or something? This is the conclusion the poster seems to have come to, but let's actually think about this. Many cultures actually never developed the wheel. Nobody in the Americas did on any large scale (in Mesoamerica, some children's toys have been found with wheels, but that's it), and they weren't used widely in Africa before the Europeans took over, either. Why not? For the very simple reason that they weren't practical. With no large domesticable draft animals and terrain unsuitable for the wheel anyway, there never was a *reason* for these cultures to develop the wheel. It wasn't because they were stupid, it was because the wheel wasn't practical for them.\n\n(for the sake of completeness--the Inka actually did have the one large domesticable draft animal, the llama. However, the steep terrain made wheeled carts impractical, which is why there was no particular reason for them to invent them.)\n\nBut let's carry on. I responded with an abbreviated version of these remarks, again stressing that disease and civil wars were major factors, and in return, I got...\n\n&gt;Umm no new world cultures had the wheel. And the wheel is still totally useful in mountains. You have zero idea what you are talking about.\n\n&gt;The Inca civilization was comparatively brand new. It had no \"stability\" to speak of. It is famous because it was what was there and was slightly more advanced than say the Chimu.\n\nSadly, this is the last response I've gotten, but I wish the guy had kept going, because this just *confused* me. He's uninformed enough to think that the Inka were \"extremely primitive\", yet knows enough to know that the Inka Empire was relatively new and that the Chimu existed? I'm going to call Wikipedia skimming on this one.\n\nBut to address these points, as I said above, there *were* wheels in the New World, just they were only in Mesoamerica and only used for children's toys. Also, while a wheel may have some practical uses in mountains, it's not nearly as useful as in flatter, more open terrain. The Inka actually had quite an advanced transportation system in the form of an extensive road system, which they used to great effect in managing their empire, much as the Romans did.  \"Ah!\" you say, \"that's good for wheeled carts.\" Except for the part where the roads turned into steps in the mountains. That's not so good for wheeled carts. Llamas and alpacas, both quite at home in steep mountains, were a great deal more practical.\n\nAnd to finish off the comment, the Inka empire was indeed quite new when the Spanish showed up; their predecessors the Chimú were conquered in about 1470. I'm not sure why the poster mentioned this, other than to try to prove he knew what he was talking about, as this only supports my argument that the Inka fell because of inherent instabilities, *not* because they were \"extremely primitive\"! At any rate, seeing as the Spanish arrived less than a century after the Chimú fell, it's not much of a surprise if the Inka were only slightly more \"advanced\" than they were. And I'm not sure what that would prove, anyway. He might've been going for \"the Chimú were primitive and the Inka weren't any better so therefore the Inka were primitive\", but... the Chimú weren't \"primitive\" either. So his whole argument kind of falls apart.",

        "text": "http://www.np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/29ju47/isis_vows_to_destroy_meccas_kaaba_kill_those_who/cilm7op\n\n&gt;The idea of wanting to destroy the Kaaba has a long and interesting precedent. Throughout history, Arabs who have traditionally hated Muhammad have expressed their desire of doing so, probably out of spite of what Muhammad represents.\nYazid bin Muawiya of the opposing clan of the Ummayads, who massacred Muhammad's family including Muhammad's grandson Hussein at Karbala, also attacked the Kaaba with catapults.\nPreviously, Muhammad's grandfather Abdul Muttalib organized the defense of the Kaaba against another attacker named Abraha who arrived with a cavalry of elephants.\nIn the current incarnation, ISIS represents Wahabi'ism, a cult that wishes to erase Muhammad's heritage and establish the supremacy of the rival, non-Hashemite clans descended from Ummaya and Abd Shams(translated as slave of the Sun). Wahabis have already destroyed many heritage buildings belonging to Muhammad and his family and friends in Saudi Arabia, under the same guise. (Please see modern-day news references here, and here, and here).\nAn oft-repeated Wahabi canard is the supposed prevention of idolatry. The likely objective, however, is the obfuscation of Muhammad's heritage and the discouragement or prevention of discussion about what he really represented.\nSo why the enmity stretching over centuries? At its core was the ideology of Muhammad. Muhammad supported the poor, the downtrodden, the disenfranchised. The opposing clans represented elitism, money, power and Arab imperialism. It was the selfless vs the selfish. They tried to persuade, bribe, cajole, armtwist him to their side. He refused. They massacred most of his family. The survivors refused to budge, citing egalitarianism and condemning the trappings of concentrated power and wealth, and refused to take part in government or Arab imperialist conquests abroad.\nAnd so it continues to this day.\nMuhammad was one of the few people in history who really put his money where his mouth is. And by paying with their lives in the service of the poor, so did his family.\nEdit: Thank you for the gold!\nEdit 2: The obfuscation of Muhammad's intended message by various rulers has been consistent throughout history, but has taken on a renewed fervour in recent times. Muhammad may be one of the most misunderstood personalities in history. This warrants more attention and discussion.\nTLDR: The history of Islam is a protracted class struggle. Muhammad sided with the poor. The classes have persisted to this day, explaining many world events.\n\nI'm surprised this isn't already here, but this guy makes a lot of crazy claims and was gilded three times for his horrible history. for R5 I submit a response from /r/AskHistorians by /u/sln26 \n\n&gt;Your friendly redditor has engaged in a nice bit of \"let's make stuff up and hope people don't actually question what I'm saying.\"\nHe seems to think that the Kaaba was somehow seen as a symbol of Muhammad by the Arabs of his time. The Kaaba predated Muhammad by centuries and pagan Arabs in the area would have revered it just as much as Muslims did. Furthermore, the actual physical building of the Kaaba is a product of each time. Other than one stone, the building is rebuilt periodically. The location is what is sacred in Islam, not the structure.\nMoving forward, I have no idea what he means by \"Arabs who have traditionally hated Muhammad have expressed their desire of doing so, probably out of spite of what Muhammad represents.\" What Arabs? What are the sources that state this? There have been some groups (e.g. Qarmatians) that have wreaked havoc in Makkah but they, in their own twisted logic, would have argued that they were doing it out of love for Islam/Muhammad/God.\nNow, on Yazid ibn Muawiyah. The poster is mixing up people. Yazid ibn Muawiyah was the caliph at the time.....in Damascus. The man who \"attacked the Ka'ba\" was Hajjaj ibn Yusuf (quite an infamous character in Islamic history). Furthermore, it's quite deceptive to describe him as \"attacking the Ka'ba.\" The background is that a man named Abdullah ibn Zubair (grandson of the first caliph, Abu Bakr) had also laid claim to the caliphate and was supported by the people in Makkah and the surrounding areas. Hajjaj ibn Yusuf (a general, under Yazid ibn Muawiyah) was attacking him, not the Ka'ba. In the battle, yes, the Ka'ba was destroyed. However, to suggest that this was purposeful is ludicrous. In fact, when the Ka'ba was accidentally destroyed by the catapults, people in Hajjaj's army began defecting, sure that this was a sign that they were on the wrong side. Hajjaj (ever the shrewd politician) convinced his soldiers that they hadn't destroyed the Ka'ba, Abdullah ibn Zubair had. After all, if he had surrendered without a fight, they wouldn't have been forced to use the catapults, right? So really, this was his fault. The point I'm making is that yes, the Ka'ba was destroyed, but it was far from purposeful, let alone part of a expression of hatred towards an ideology.\nNext line, wow, even more pseudohistory. I've heard some pretty strange descriptions of Wahabism, but to say that they wish to erase Muhammad's heritage and establish the supremacy of the Banu Umayyah is the equivalent of someone saying the Republican party wishes to establish the supremacy of the descendants of Robert E. Lee and erase all aspects of George Washington's heritage. Literally, that's the comparison of how his statement sounds. Wahhabism is, in a very short nutshell, a puritanical (for lack of a better word) movement that attempts to bring Islamic theology and law back to its foundations by relying solely on the first three generations of Islam and removing Islam of any characteristics it has picked up in its 1400 years that was not present at its founding. Their destruction of these heritage buildings is mainly two reasons, one theological the other practical. Theologically, a lot of these buildings were taken as shrines or holy places. However, the earliest Muslims did not consider these locations to be holy so in the eyes of the Wahhabi movement, these are innovations which should be removed to return Islam to its original state. The other, practical reason, is that the buildings needed to be demolished to make room for the new construction.\nFinally, the idea that there has been a long class struggle between \"Muhammad and his followers\" and the rich/elite does not hold up to historical scrutiny. Yes, even a lot of Muslims will claim that the vast majority of early Muslims were poor and downtrodden and that the rich and powerful opposed Islam but this really isn't true. If you actually do an analysis of the earliest converts and group them by their clan affiliation, you'll see that they span all economic and social groups. Yes, you have Bilal and Abdullah ibn Masud who were slaves and clients (poor people without a strong tribal affiliation). But then there are plenty of early Muslims from the strong and rich classes like AbdulRahman ibn Awf and Al-Arqam ibn abi al-Arqam. Heck, out of the first four caliphs, all were from elite tribes. The first three were merchants and relatively wealthy (the third exceptionally so).\nTL;DR: Friendly redditor has spun a nice fictional yarn http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/29kgrb/how_long_have_there_been_factions_within_islam/cilz4zv\n\nIts later decided that the OP probably belongs to an extremist sect of Shia Muslims that paints all Sunni as haters of Mohammed. But seriously, saying Muslims hate Mohammed is like saying  there are Christians that hate Jesus or Jews that hate Moses as a theological principle",

Sure the coup was a contributing factor but there were multiple underlying tensions like inequality, both socio-economic and racial that drove a lot of the fighting. To blame the US alone for a 36 year long civil war with many complex stages and actors is to make it seem like the Guatemalans who participated on all sides were nothing but pawns in a game played for and against US interests. It makes it seem like Guatemalans were subject to the will of whatever the US wanted and did. \n\nI would also like to take issue with a particular [comment](www.np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/29hzm8/til_united_fruit_companys_main_rival_was/cildom4) which spouts typical misinformed anti-American nonsense. \n\n&gt; And of course everyone already knows about the death squads in Nicaragua, which was very much a response to agrarian reforms.

I mean he might be talking about the Contras and the participants of Operation Mongoose but even then, their grievances with the revolutionary governments were a hell of a lot deeper than land reform. Many of the original Contras had their land seized by the Sandinista government waaaaaaaay before the agrarian reform. Many just wanted to get back in control of Nicaragua. Same with many Batista supporters in Cuba.

Were there decisions made with the intent of protecting US interests abroad, of course. However, to say that we have not supported elections where candidates with less than pro-market and pro-US sentiment won is absurd. I'm not saying the US has not meddled in the affairs of Latin America, because it has. However, the make overly simplistic blanket statements about a complex field such as the history of US foreign policy in Latin America, is bad history. ",

        "text": "Ordinarily I'd just post this in /r/AskHistorians, but I won't be around Saturday and quite frankly am just kind of annoyed with it, so I'm going to post it here. Before I start, the two books are [Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict](http://www.worldcat.org/title/palestine-and-the-arab-israeli-conflict/oclc/54762581) by Charles D. Smith, and [Defending the Holy Land](http://www.worldcat.org/title/defending-the-holy-land-a-critical-analysis-of-israels-security-foreign-policy/oclc/62127840&amp;referer=brief_results) by Zeev Maoz. Both make glaring mistakes on the lead-up to the war that have been documented extensively by other scholars, mostly around details that anyone who studies the conflict is fairly aware of.\n\nLet's start with Smith. I'll highlight some passages with problems:\n\n&gt;Israeli planes and torpedo boats staged an apparently deliberate assault On an American intelligence- gathering ship, the U.S.S. Liberty, on June 8, killing thirty-four and wounding more than seventy.\" The ship was stationed off the Sinai near Israel to monitor radio signals from all sources. The Israelis probably acted to forestall American\nawareness of their plans to move against Syria. Johnson and his aides accepted Israeli apologies for the \"accident,\" relieved that the attackers had not been the Russians (Smith, 284).\n\nWe get into this right off the bat with a healthy dose of conspiracy theory that is apparently being reinforced in an academic work. I've done an [extensive write-up on the events](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/24h6c7/what_evidence_is_there_that_shows_that_the_uss/ch7c6nc) (leaving it out here to save space) and reasons it's not likely this was deliberate, and Smith's decision to lend credence to the claim and imply that it's the majorly accepted account of events is troubling, to say the least.\n\nBut Smith wasn't doing much better before this either:\n\n&gt;[Nasser] occupied Sharm al-Shaykh to blunt Arab criticism, not as a prelude to an offen- sive. He stressed defensive preparations and insisted that Egyptian forces in the Sinai adopt a defensive posture, albeit in forward, offensive positions. The confusion probably reflected his military chiefs' desire for war. His war minister, Shams al-Din Badran, returned from Moscow on May 25 and lied to Nasser, telling him he had Soviet backing for war when in fact Moscow was desperately urging restraint (Smith, 281).\n\nThis is rather interesting, considering all other accounts. Smith makes absolutely no mention of Operation Dawn, the Egyptian plan to attack Israel at first light on May 27th. Nor does Smith mention at any point the Soviets forcing Nasser to back down, as a result of a United States message. Oren documents it quite clearly:\n\n&gt;“One hour ago, President Johnson informed me that Egyptian forces are pre- paring an attack on Israeli positions and that this attack is about to be launched. If such a thing happens, then the United States will consider itself freed from the commitments it gave to the USSR to exercise restraint.” Pojidaev read Kosygin’s text to Nasser, adding only that a tougher warning had already been sent to Eshkol. Nasser’s reaction was composed: “It’s essential that everybody know that Egypt does not want war and is not heading in that direction, but will defend itself if attacked.” (Oren, 119).\n\nThe Soviets, at this time, were unaware entirely of the intention to launch Dawn mere hours later. But this is all omitted by Smith. Evidently the near false-start by the Egyptians on May 27th doesn't merit mention, and it was all the Badran's fault for trying to push Nasser towards war by lying, and Nasser was a voice of restraint! Indeed, Nasser was not the most enthusiastic, and was mostly convinced by Amer, but to completely omit Dawn is an oversight I can't understand. Then again, Smith also doesn't mention Dimona once in his entire book by the looks of it, despite it being a huge source of fear for the Israelis (when Egypt flew over it at least twice in May without any Israeli planes being able to intercept), and despite it having huge play in US-Israel relations during Kennedy's time.\n\nWhat's interesting is this especially:\n\n&gt;[Amit, Chief of Mossad] informed [the US] on June 1 and 2 of Israel's intent to attack in order to gauge their response; he received encouragement, particularly from Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara (Smith, 283).\n\nIn no uncertain terms, this is wrong. Amit *believed* he had received ambiguous go-aheads, ie. in the form of \"If you attack, we won't openly oppose you, but we'd like you not to\". Once again, Oren makes this clear:\n\n&gt;Amit’s records show that Johnson called twice during the meeting and was fully apprised of its substance. The Mossad chief thus concluded that the president, like his defense secretary, was not telling Israel explicitly not to go to war. McNamara would later object to that conclusion: “I cannot believe that he thought that. We were absolutely opposed to preemption. We were afraid that preemption, by provoking the Soviets to intervene, would necessitate American intervention to save Israel.” But Amit had discerned the internal divisions over Regatta in the White House and, apart from supplying some gas masks and medicines, its refusal to aid Israel militarily. If Johnson’s purpose in accommodating Amit had been to allay Israel’s fears and buy more time for diplomacy, the goal had been emphatically missed. Amit would fly home more than ever convinced that Israel gained nothing by waiting, except compounding its losses (Oren, 147).\n\nI could continue this for quite some time, but I want to save some space for Maoz's mistakes. Also, as a reference, what Oren says is not only considered an authoritative source on the Six Day War, it's reinforced by *The Six Day War* by Randolph S. Churchill, and by *Righteous Victims* by Benny Morris. Roland Popp disputes Dawn's existence on the basis that it seems unlikely that it occurred, but never once disputes the Arab and Israeli sources alike backing the narrative and dialogue that is given in detail, merely says it must've been a ploy that the Israelis were using to cause the US to support their pre-emptive strike. Popp also relies on Brecher's claim that the move was Machiavellian and interprets that to mean it must've been deceptive, rather than a masterful play of strategy using information that was only half-in, or any other interpretations. I'm not sure if he thinks all the dialogue gathered from Arab sources was fabricated, or what, but it's a little silly all in all to assume no such plan existed and that it's not even worth a mention, especially since Smith leaves out Dimona. But fine, let's move to Maoz:\n\n&gt;Jordan and Egypt refused to let guerrillas from the newly formed Palestinian Liberation Organizatlon (PLO) operate from their territory. In contrast, the Baath regime provided both logistical and practical support to the PLO. (Maoz, 84). Most infiltrations to Israel after 1965 originated from the Syrian border.\n\nSeriously? This is like, a rookie mistake. As documented quite extensively by Moshe Shemesh, the PLO was *not* the same as Fatah as this quote seems to imply, who were the Syrian-funded guerrillas. Fatah was actually perceived by the Syrians as a counterweight to the Egyptian-influenced PLO that was operating under Shuqayri. The PLO incorporated Fatah (it had a very open structure that was decentralized, it was more like a union than a unitary body especially at the outset) only after the Six Day War, and was not operating in Israel's territory out of Syria by most narratives of the war. Shemesh:\n\nThe change in Egypt's position (and the PLO's) toward support of Fida'iyyun operations began in mid-1966. By the end of the year the PLO, the Arab Nationalists' Movement, and other organizations such as Ahmad Jibril's group, the Palestinian National Front-also started taking an active part in sabotage operations (Shemesh, 2).\n\nIn no uncertain terms once more, Shemesh puts to rest the idea that the PLO was responsible for border destabilization from 1965 as Maoz seems to believe, and removes the idea that they were the same as Fatah. Shemesh again:\n\n&gt;Unlike the PLO, (founded by Ahmad al-Shuqayri in \n1964 that loyally supported Egyptian strategy) Fatah adopted a militant, \nindependent path that broke ranks with Arab strategy over Shuqayri's \nleadership and the nature of the struggle (Shemesh, 4).\n\nThis correctly recognizes the power dynamic by which Palestinian organizations were being influenced by Arab nations. Syria backed Fatah, Jordan and Egypt mostly backed the PLO, though eventually Jordan moved away from the PLO.\n\nI could continue but I have neither the energy nor the space.",

This led to a lot of badhistory, including the comments of review articles of the DLC.\n\n&gt;While true, the idea that there was any sort of technological parity between the Aztecs and the Europeans is just revisionist garbage.\n\nI've noticed that more and more often people have used the term \"revisionist\" as a four-letter word. Incidentally, most of these people don't know what they're talking about.\n\n&gt; The Europeans were easily a few THOUSAND years ahead of the Meso-American Civilizations.\n\nApparently we measure technology in years now. Back in my day, we measure it in beakers and we liked it. Damned revisionists.\n\nA few thousand years ago, the 17th century BCE, there is the Minoan civilization in prominence. At this time, the Minoans boasted of trade, currency, writing and hieroglyphics, pottery, bronze working, large cities, architecture, and complex religion. Babylon had astronomy as well.\n\nIn 1300 AD, the Aztecs boasted of [trade, currency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec#Economy), [writing and hieroglyphics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_codices), [scultpture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec#Arts) , [bronze and obsidian working](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec#Tribute_and_trade), [one of the largest cities in the world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenochtitlan), [architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec#City-building_and_architecture), [complex religion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec#Mythology_and_religion), astronomy, and [education](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calmecac).\n\n&gt;The Aztecs would have had a hard time dealing with Old Kingdom Egypt, much less a civilization that was figuring out gunpowder, the compass, and sanitation.\n\n*New* Kingdom Egypt lost to a civilization that had iron.

The Mesoamerican cultures had advanced social systems, maths and literature, and construction and engineering. Obviously, they were lacking in other areas such as metallurgy and shipbuilding.”\n\n&gt;&gt;Yes advanced compared to cave people, not advanced compared to say China and Europe in 1000bc, much less Europe in 1400 AD. It is all well and good to be excited about their technological capabilities, but they didn’t even have the barest fragment of the material or cultural know how of the Eurasian cultures.\n\n*grind teeth* The context of what this is being what it is, the technological and cultural developments of China hardly seem relevant here. As to the rest, see above.\n\n&gt;“Anyway, who cares? It’s an alternative history scenario in a computer game. And it’s interesting for its complete inversion of the usual “Europeans go out and take someone else’s land” colonisation theme.”\n\n&gt;&gt;I don’t mind the setting for a video game at all, I was just trying to point out that it is indeed insane. A sub Saharan African invasion of China is a lot more plausible, and well….\n\nI like the subtle implication of the mud hut Africans here.\n\nLater on...\n\n&gt;I agree completely that the history American kids are taught are a ridiculous fairy tale obscuring what was essentially a genocide of exactly the kind we love to chastise the Turks/Nazis about.\n\nI'm becoming increasingly convinced that either my high school has the only-half decent history program in the nation, or I'm the only person in America to pay attention in history. \n\n&gt;“knowing about something” and having it an effective part of your technological mileu are two different things. The wheel most definitely would have been extremely useful for moving goods in Meso America. And they didn’t use it. If you want to be generous we can say they hadn’t invented the “cart” yet. Do you feel better now?\n\n\nI'll just copy what another comment said.\n\n\"That region is full of hills, mountains, swamps, and rivers. It is not the dry and dusty type of terrain that so many people traditionally associate with Mexico. It’s perfectly reasonable to assume that the Aztecs did not use the wheel because the terrain they lived in prohibited it from being fully effective. In fact, I’d go so far as to say that any historian who claims that the Aztecs were “ignorant” of the wheel’s primary use (as human transport) is straining credibility. The Aztecs obviously knew the physics behind the wheel.\n\nOf course, maybe that whole “operable wheels on mobile toys” thing was just a freak occurrence.\n\nI should mention that the Aztec peoples used aqueducts, one of those fancy “high-level” technologies that savages are apparently incapable of creating.\"\n\n\n&gt;It has nothing to do with Eurocentrism. I love world history and have studied as many cultures as I can. IN fact the Eruocentrism is repackaging actual Meso-American history (as was done in the 60s-00s) because of intellectual trends in the Western world.\n\n\nI honestly don't what he's saying here. Maybe it's poorly worded, maybe I'm slightly more dense than usual. No matter.\n\n&gt;Guns Germs and Steel is the apotheosis of this, and while it makes a lot of interesting and valid points, is also kind of a joke. The main thesis is frankly ridiculous.\n\n\n[Hey, something I can agree with.](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/historians_views#wiki_historians.27_views_of_jared_diamond.27s_.22guns.2C_germs.2C_and_steel.22)\n\nI'd like to remind that all of this came from an alternate-history involving the Aztecs invading Europe in the 1300s.",

        "text": "First, there's [this article](http://www.fstdt.com/QuoteComment.aspx?QID=98023) which is an utter abomination, and which has of late been posted to /r/BadSocialScience. First, there's the problem (that ought to be obvious) of using *Gone with the Wind* as a historical source. This, of course, can be done, but can only be done well with a great deal of analysis of its biases. The work does an enormously fantastic job of whitewashing southern society with the project of romanticizing southern society be ignoring or revising its less savory elements. This can only be accomplished through ignorance of certain themes, fabrication of atypical relationships, or (as this passage does) irresponsibly shifting the blame for contemporary images of southern society onto disturbed northerners rather than the fact that such awful practices did exist, if not in this single example. Next, there's statements like these:\n\n&gt;People are born, raised, educated, and find themselves in a certain kind of society to which those around them are all accustomed. American slave society was a way of life; a settled way that most people took for granted, as most people will anywhere. \n\n...followed by:\n\n&gt;There were aspects of life resembling slavery in the communist China where I lived, 1982-3. People had no liberty to find their own employment. You were “assigned” to a “unit.” If unhappy there, it was a devil of a job to get re-assigned. \n\n&gt;Families broken up? One of my Chinese colleagues lived alone because his wife was “assigned” to a distant province. He only saw her once a year. \n\n&gt;The guy drank a lot. \n\n&gt;Yet while there was much grumbling, and some scattered seething rebelliousness, most Chinese got along with the system. A lot of people were very happy with it. You didn’t have to think much, or take much responsibility. And that suits many of us just fine.\n\nOf course, one of the major problems here is the employment of anecdotal evidence to characterize a population of what was nearly a billion people at the time. In that such evidence is utterly worthless by itself. Secondly, comparing a planned economy directed by an authoritarian state is best described by itself, and not by comparison to a capitalist agricultural society dependent upon chattel slavery. These are fundamentally different things, and the comparison in no way enhances the understanding of either society. Moreover, trying to cast slavery in a better light than is done in *12 Years a Slave* is not easily accomplished by comparing it to China in the '80s.\n\n-----\n\nNext, we move onto [this person's belief](http://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/29gvh1/video_of_confederate_civil_war_reunion_from_1914/cilcxj4?context=1) that William Lloyd Garrison and other abolitionists can be considered 'proto-libertarians:\n\n&gt;The only anti-slavery advocates, as slaves had no political power at the time, were marginal proto-libertarian abolitionists who held little to no power.\n\nFirst, while abolitionists had very little power, their agency is not defined exactly by this alone. They still had enormous influence for a small minority—enough to instill fear in Southerners of abolitionist conspiracies against their way of life through anti-slavery agitation, as had been seen at Harpers Ferry. Of course, that's just one example.\n\nSecondly, as I state in the linked thread, this is an absurd projection of a modern political ideology onto the antebellum period. There's 150+ years separating us from this period, and libertarianism is a distinctly twentieth century phenomenon. So this is at best an anachronism.\n\nThirdly, portraying the faction that wanted the immediate abolition of southerners' means of production and foundation of their socioeconomic model as 'proto-libertarians' is absurd for this very reason. They favored a strong exercise of federal power over southern agricultural capitalists, who tended to favor decentralization of power, nonintervention in slavery, low tariffs, etc.\n\nFourthly and lastly, this person seems to be under the impression, later in the thread, that my equation of abolition to intervention in the economy means I myself believe (somehow) that recognizing contemporaneous laws that held slaves were property means I agree that people can and should be considered property, which is ridiculous. My opinion is of no interest in the statements I made, and this is not a correct assumption of my opinion to begin with.\n\nThat thread on the whole is filled with the [predictable neo-Confederate babble,](http://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/29gvh1/video_of_confederate_civil_war_reunion_from_1914/cikvw0k) and I spent a few minutes pointing out the errors in some of the comments in there, but [nothing really that we haven't seen here before.](http://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/29gvh1/video_of_confederate_civil_war_reunion_from_1914/cikv08h)\n\n-----\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/wiki/good_history#wiki_the_civil_war.2C_and_the_confederacy\n\n-----\n\n**Reminder: commentary concerning contemporary politics without a firm relation to political, economic, or social history will be removed.** Attacking a faction's misinterpretation of historical evidence to suit ideological ends is OK in /r/badhistory, but arguments of an ideological nature are not permitted.\n\n-----\n\nEdit — An ELS post I made on this topic was linked to SSS, so please remember to report any suspicions of brigading or violations of rule 2.",

        "text": "[Spotted here:](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/06/airbnb-ceo-cities-are-becoming-villages/373676/)\n\n&gt; \"Cities used to be generally villages, and everyone was essentially kind of like an entrepreneur,\" he said at the Aspen Ideas Festival. \"You were either a farmer, or you worked in the city as a blacksmith, or you had some kind of trade. And then the Industrial Revolution happened.\" World War II followed, and \"suddenly cities became more and more mass-produced. And we stopped trusting our neighbors.\" [...]\n&gt; \n&gt; This is \"the Internet moving into your neighborhood,\" Chesky said. \"And what it really means is that people, for the first time, can become micro-entrepreneurs. They can actually build a reputation, and they can offer goods and services.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; \"At the most macro level, I think we're going to go back to the village, and cities will become communities again,\" he added. \"I'm not saying they're not communities now, but I think that we'll have this real sensibility and everything will be small. You're not going to have big chain restaurants. We're starting to see farmers' markets, and small restaurants, and food trucks. But pretty soon, restaurants will be in people's living rooms.\"\n\n* Cities have existed for a mind-bogglingly long time. While the earliest cities were quite small by our standards -- [Eridu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eridu) estimated at around 4,000, [Catal Huyuk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87atalh%C3%B6y%C3%BCk) 10,000 at most -- with that population we would nowadays reckon them as towns, not villages. \n\n* **edited to add:** There have always been more jobs than \"farmer\" or \"tradesman\". One might be a banker, lawyer, midwife, barber, bureaucrat, teacher, surgeon, wet nurse, etc. Not to mention household labour that, in our industrial age, we would leave to someone else -- cheese-making, brewing beer, cleaning \"dry clean only\" type fabrics.\n\n* Statistically speaking, city dwellers in the Middle Ages had even less reason to [trust their neighbours](http://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/23/us/historical-study-of-homicide-and-cities-surprises-the-experts.html). For example, 14th-century London's murder rate was [equivalent to present day Atlanta or Pittsburgh](http://bedejournal.blogspot.ca/2011/11/steven-pinkers-medieval-murder-rates.html). There are [numerous theories](https://soci.ucalgary.ca/brannigan/sites/soci.ucalgary.ca.brannigan/files/long-term-historical-trends-of-violent-crime.pdf) for why crime in Western society has dropped over time. One possible factor is the rise of the legal system and the centralization of state power, which seems to be the opposite of Chesky's goal.\n\n* In the average pre-industrial city not just anyone could set up shop as a self-employed tradesperson or merchant. [Guilds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guild) regulated how people trained, what they could manufacture, and who could go into business. In [16th-century Salisbury](http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=41799) \"rules were made confining them to their own type of work, namely, women's hose, men's stockings, and boot hose. Likewise, apprentices to tailors were to make only men's and women's garments\". In [14th-century Southampton](http://www.shsu.edu/~his_ncp/Gildmerc.html) \"no private man nor stranger shall bargain for or buy any kind of merchandise coming into the city before a burgess of the gild merchant, so long as the gildsman is present and wishes to bargain for and buy this merchandise; and if anyone does so and is convicted, that which he buys shall be forfeited to the king\"\n\n   The [domestic system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putting-out_system) allowed business people to outsource, so to speak, to individual labourers working at home. But it wasn't really \"be your own boss\" -- workers had to pay the merchants fees. (Agricultural life also lent itself to working at home due to the winter off-season. However, Chesky's talking about cities.)\n\n* \"Micro-entrepreneurs\" have [been around for a while](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_economy#History). See, for example, [the history of mixtapes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixtape#History). If a guy selling tapes on the corner isn't a micro-entrepreneur, who is?\n\n**tl;dr:** trust your neighbour, calm your techie boner, don't eat in a restaurant that is someone's living room",

Poor education on my part I reckon.\n\nThis is more an example of bad logic than bad history, since terms like \"Europe\" or any other continent refers to a collective rather than a single unit, but there's more to come.\n\n&gt;You are pretty much implying three countries when you use the continent of Europe. So it sounds kinda dumb to write it.\n\nThe assertion that referring to Europe means that you're dealing with three countries is a bizarre one, but they might have been talking about Britain, France, and Spain, since they were the primary western European powers in the Americas during the late 18th century. This simplification of course ignores Portugal and all other European countries which had influence in other parts of the world by the end of the 18th or had influence in the Americas before being absorbed into the British, French, or Spanish colonies. If, in such a narrow context, there's still more than three relevant European powers, it's difficult to imagine one that would fit the bill.\n\nI understand why it's best to downplay a glowing analysis of European dominance, but to deny that it was significant because Europe wasn't completely united culturally or politically is just wading into the opposite but equally inaccurate extreme.",

        "text": "I was talking to a friend the other day about history and stuff (very specific, I know) and the focus shifted to Native Americans/First Nations, the Idle No More movement, stuff like that.  Our conversation went something like this:\n\nMe:  Yeah, I think the Canadian government has a different kind of relationship with the native peoples than the American government, not really sure how though, I'll have to look it up.\n\nHim:  It'd have to be pretty different since there was only one tribe in Canada.\n\nMe:  ...What?\n\nHim:  Well, there were different groups, but they were all united under the Iroquois.  \n\nMe:  Oh, I see...([Whaaaaaat.](http://mrwgifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Wat-Meme-Picks-Up-a-Gun-Of-Confusion.gif))\n\nR5:  This is bad history because, as shown by a quick trip to /r/AskHistorians (links at the bottom), native peoples in North America had very limited trade and communication, much less political unity.  That's not to say there was *no* interaction; traders and explorers from certain nations were aware of others, especially neighbors in the region.  There were even far-reaching trade networks, some of which reached (albeit indirectly) across the continent.  /u/TeknikReVolt explains one such network regarding the trade of Chumash seashells.\n\n&gt; The Chumash, a combination of fishermen and hunter-gatherers, used a quarry on Santa Cruz to produce drills that made seashell beads which were traded extensively, including eastward to the Hohokam peoples and to the Pueblo. The Hohokam peoples, specifically the site of Snaketown located 30 miles west of Phoenix AZ, which were known to have traded with Meso-Americans due to the discovery of Maccaw feathers at the site, as well as trading northward with the Fremont culture, and eastward with the Mogollon. These peoples: Mogollon, Hohokam, Anasazi, and Pataya are collectively known as Oasisamerica. They traded turquoise in exchange for the decorative shell beads produced by the Chumash, as well as to the Mesoamericans. The next link in this chain of trade exchange was what is now Texas. Texas was a confluence of the Oasisamericans, the nomadic Plains cultures, and the Caddoans. Spiro is the westernmost part of the Caddoan Missippian culture, and trade goods such as the Californian shells, mesoamerican Obsidian and Mica/Quartz from the Carolinas. So the only complete pacific to atlantic trade network would be as follows\n\n - Chumash people trade shells east to Hohokam and Pueblo\n\n - Hohokam trade east to the Mogollon culture, which is on the same longitudinal axis as the Aztecs and is a link for Obsidian and maccaws and copper\n\n - Mogollon trade east and north to plains nomads in the Caddoan language family\n\n - Caddoan Mississippians trade east with the other Mississippian cultures in the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex (North to the Oneota Complex, North East to the Fort Ancient Complex in Ohio, South to the Plaquemine culture in Louisiana, and South Eastward to the Southern Appalachian)\n\nSo we can see that Native American groups did trade and communicate with each other to an extent.  However (bringing it back to Canada), your average Iroquois or Algonquin man (from modern East Ontario) probably wouldn't have even known much about the Cree or Ojibwa (Northwestern Ontario); to suggest *all the First Nations in Canada,* from the Beothuk from Newfoundland to the Haida from B.C., were united under the Iroquois government is rather ridiculous.\n\nSources:\n\nhttp://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1k7xno/what_were_the_trade_networks_like_in_the/\n\nhttp://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/md8m4/how_much_continentwide_dispersal_of_information/\n\nhttp://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1nd1m2/were_native_americans_aware_of_other_tribes/\n\n",

It's only isolation and doesn't actually solve any problems. It's a quick fix, and quick fixes never work. It's like suggesting blacks back in the 1960s just create black nations that are self sufficient, it's a terrible idea.\n\nWhich is ironic because there are many evidences that breaking away from a current country actually helps in the long run. For example, the entire USSR after the Cold War, with nations like Lithuania and Estonia becoming prosperous democracies with good economy.\n\n&gt;Creating a Kurdistan for the sole purpose of giving Kurds a nation, that you claim will also give inspiration to other racial minorities to create their own nations, is not at all racial division?\n\nHe's trying to link national independence movements with racial division, which pretty much glosses over the fact that empires usually committed worse racial genocides than those of separatism. And Arabs in Iraqi Kurdistan are doing pretty well.\n\nAlso, Singapore.\n\n&gt;What you're asking for is the same exact thing /r/whiterights is asking for. The Muslim world will and should move forward together, not apart.\n\nSo apparently Tunku Abdul Rahman, Ahmed Ben Bella, Émile Eddé and Muhammad Ali Jinnah are literally fascists for wanting a tate of their own instead of being in an unrealistic Muslim caliphate.\n\n&gt;What I do know from history is that quick fixes fail. If the blacks tried to create their own nation, well, America would still be backwards (don't get me wrong, it still is, but not so much).\n\nDidn't Liberia actually happened?\n\nAnd Liberia was also prosperous between the late 19th century till 1980 (When the coup happened). And don't we have a Black President with a 6.3% unemployment rate? \n\nI swear to God these are the types of people who thinks that the Abbasid Caliphate can still work in today's empire. /u/possiblea2m is pretty close to joining a Syrian jihad movement (like ISIS, who also wanted to create an Islamic Caliphate).",

        "text": "So hey, I'm here again, bringing in more badhistory for y'alls guys and gals to peruse. \n\nAnyway, this is (unfortunately) once again low hanging fruit, but seriously, I couldn't really let this one slide. \n\nSo anyway, what is the offending post?\n\nOr more accurately, what is the offending thread?\n\n[Why, it's this, of course](http://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2953p5/til_66_years_ago_today_the_berlin_airlift_began/cihrv0y), straight out of the oven from /r/todayilearned. \n\nSo what exactly is going on here, exactly? Well, the TIL in question reads as such:\n&gt;TIL 66 years ago today, the Berlin Airlift began. Landing one plane per minute for over a year, the airlift brought in 5000 tons of food and coal per day to Berlin.\n\nLeading to a great argument to when exactly the Cold War began, ranging from 1947 to the Berlin Airlift (1948), with a whole line of bad history behind it. \n\nLet me go over the trash here: \n\n&gt;lol have you ever taken an american history course? [The Berlin Airlift] is considered to be the beginning of the cold war by historians.\n\n[Woah really???](http://i.imgur.com/MWg8sz0.gif)\n\nNormally, I would ignore stuff like this and move on. However, it seems like posts like this were upvoted and posts to the contrary were downvoted into oblivion, implying that for some reason, Redditors seem to agree with that idea.\n\nBut anyway, back to the post.\n\nOk, first off, seriously, which historians are you talking about? Because this is a serious weasel word right here. I have yet to meet a historian who believes the same thing. \n\nBut I can accept if *you* think that this is the beginning of the Cold War, as it is a topic that is greatly debated on by historians.\n\nAs for the definition of Cold War, we'll use this: The Cold War was a sustained period of political tensions between the Western Allies led by the USA and the Eastern bloc led by the Soviet Union. \n\nSimple and sweet, and yet a bit ambiguous. But that's fine. The Cold War is a loose term for the tensions at the time.\n\nBut since you (and potentially 6 others) seem so convinced that \"historians\" believe the Berlin Airlift to be the beginning of the Cold War, I'm going to give you a small history lesson right here...\n\n[For many historians, there are a couple points at which the Cold War could have started from:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origins_of_the_Cold_War#Disagreement_over_the_beginning_of_the_Cold_War)\n\n(There are more, but I'm just going to go with the two main ones)\n\n1. 1917, the Russian Revolution. Here, in the midst of the Great War, the Communist Bolsheviks took power Russia from the Czar, leading to the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and the withdrawal of Russia from WWI. This didn't exactly go well with the Alliance powers, and thus this marks the point where the USA first grew to resent the Soviets. You can probably tell why. The United States supported the Provisional government that replaced the Czar, which wished to continue the war against Germany. However, this resentment was shown when the United States, under Woodrow Wilson put its troops into Russia in 1918, supporting the Whites against the Red Bolsheviks, fearing the fall of the Russians to communism, marking this the first conflict between 'capitalist' USA and 'communist' Russia, and marking the first military and ideological struggle between communism and capitalism. Also note that this debated starting point is 30 years before what our fellow Redditor is trying to purport. If you are using this point, however, then perhaps it is possible to put a date on the beginning on the Cold War, March 3, 1918, the day of signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. However, again, this is a topic for debate, so I would not do that if I were you. \n\n2. 1945 at the Yalta, the Potsdam Conference and the end of WWII. (Of course, I'm not forgetting the Tehran Conference, but it's effect on the entire Cold War as a whole was highly minimal). Stalin, comes in, of course, and through the two conferences, is able to secure Soviet hold on Poland and half of Germany (including Berlin). But that's not all. At the same time, Stalin was able to secure and annex Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, etc, and found satellite states in Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania and Albania. Here, the Eastern Bloc was established, and with that, Stalin has created a faction of communism that could rival the Western capitalist world. (No relation to the video game Red Alert) [Some historians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historiography_of_the_Cold_War#Orthodox_accounts)  in the past have placed this time to be the origin of the Cold War because of Stalin's failure to fulfill his promises in the conferences, as well as his purposeful expansion into Eastern Europe. But this is highly debatable. But whatever happened, post WWII led to the severe political tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States, and led to an economical \"country grab\" by both countries in Europe in order to halt each other's expansions. (Remember the Marshall Plan and the Truman Doctrine?) However, let's not also forget the use of the Atomic Bomb by the USA on Japan. Development and use of such a destructive instrument led to the nuclear arms race that defined the Cold War. If we're using this as the beginning of the Cold War, then it is pretty much impossible to put a starting date on the war. Where should we put it? At the beginning of the war where Russia allied with Nazi Germany against the Western Allies and invaded Poland, beginning its expansion into Eastern Europe? Near the middle/end of the war where the Russians took back all of its holdings on Eastern Europe back from the Germans and the USA entered the war? Or at the end of the war, where the US dropped its atomic bombs on Japan and the Russians solidified their hold on Eastern Europe? These are all simplifications, but it does bring up a point: the beginning of the Cold War is questionable. We aren't clear when it started, who started it, and who is to blame, and frankly, it is bad history to try to solve all of these from your computer.\n\n(BTW, I'm trying to keep my Cold War origin points as post-revisionist as possible, but if it does seem like they are orthodox, I apologize)\n\nBut wait, there's more. \n\nUnfortunately, no matter how much debate is made, with no good historical evidence/sources/points made on either side, this argument has reached a standstill.\n\nWhich leads us to the next post:\n\n&gt;but I what I said isn't an argument or a statement of opinion but rather historical fact that anyone with a College education is aware of.\n\nActually, if you took Modern European history in college, (which you clearly didn't), you would have learned about those 2 points that I've made. \n\nSo TL;DR, the Berlin Blockade, is not agreed universally to be the starting point of the Cold War, however, it was the first major diplomatic and political crisis between the two major factions of the conflict. \n\nAlso, while the word \"Cold War\" was popularized in 1947, that doesn't mean that the conflict started then. \n\nHowever, I've got it to u/darktask for this post (even though it was downvoted into oblivion)\n\n&gt;With the ambiguous nature of the Cold War, hence it's name, it's not considered to be as clear-cut a conflict as WWI or WWII were and if you know what it involved that also means knowing it was very uncertain; assigning it an anniversary is simplistic and could be considered crude, especially since so many aspects of the Cold War have only recently come to light.\n\nThank you, you took the words right out of me. I don't know who are the 8 ignorant sods who downvoted you, but you're correct. And yes, ever since the fall of the Soviet Union as well as the opening of the Soviet archives by the Russian Federation, it is true that most have recently come to light (Rule 2 ho).\n\n(Please respect Rule 1. Even though I like his post, that's still no reason to start an upvote crusade)\n\nHowever, to emphasize, the relations between communist Soviet Russia and the capitalist West are complicated and are by no means simple. Our definition of \"Cold War,\" therefore, is incredibly loose. Tensions have heightened and eased like a rollercoaster ever since that first conflict in 1918, whether it be through proxy wars in Africa, or through detente through Khrushchev. To pinpoint an exact starting point is inaccurate. To pinpoint an exact starting point, and emphasize that historians say that it is the starting point is just bad history. \n\n\nSo here's to you, /r/badhistory, from me. \n",

That's the low end of the estimate by the way. In what universe is that 'not trying'?\n\nNote that the Dunkirk evacuation was only possible because the French Army was holding off the Germans, outnumbered, delaying the German advance for days. In other words the French were fighting so the British could run away.\n\n&gt;And if you consider that French arrogance at Versailles after WWI was a major factor leading to WWII, well, they kind of brought it on themselves.\n\nThe French claims at Versailles were not \"arrogant\" in the slightest. They simply wanted payment for all the stuff the German Army had maliciously destroyed when they had occupied part of France for years, a perfectly reasonable request on their part.\n\n&gt;You're making my point: the Poles suffered more killed during their invasion, despite having a much smaller army.\n\nThe Poles were generally seen as subhuman, where as the French weren't. Also, Poland was being destroyed as a nation, where as France wasn't. France was given the option for an armistice, which they took seeing as continuing to resist after they had already clearly lost would have brought on more deaths and destruction on their country. I'm gonna go ahead and assume if the Poles had been given the option of an armistice with only partial German occupation and semi-autonomy, they would have taken it rather than suffer obliteration.\n\n&gt;The casualties on the Eastern front are orders of magnitude higher.\n\nBecause of length of time, the sheer numbers involved, and the fact that the Germans tended to view most Eastern Europeans as subhumans and were murdered in large numbers.\n\n&gt;England fought for 6 years,\n\nBecause they retreated to their island, protected by this thing called the English Channel. Unfortunately the French didn't have this option.\n\n&gt;the US for 4,\n\nOn a different continent surrounded by two oceans. Again, France didn't have this advantage.\n\n&gt;USSR for 4.\n\nBecause they had room to retreat into their ridiculously huge country and regroup. Once again France didn't have this advantage.\n\n&gt;I think saying the feeling that the French got out early and for relatively little harm was widespread is not a stretch.\n\nThey \"got out\" because they lost, plain and simple. They were beaten. There's no evidence of a lack of effort to defend themselves. In addition there were collaborators in pretty much every country the Nazis occupied, France was little different in that respect.\n\n\n",

Also the fun game of \"vague counterfactuals\" in general. Although in this case, no one play's OP's games.\n\nMost of the comments basically say, \"Yeah, what if. Not possible.\" Some more elegantly than others.\n\n&gt;Not possible. Roman kinda sucked at sea. They were best on land­.\n\nBad roll, Rome. Sea bad, land best. Naval exploration unlikely.\n\nFrankly I'm kind of disappointed that none of the answers even attempt to entertain the hypothetical. I guess I would've been even more disappointed if someone had - I'm just not satisfiable.\n\n&gt;Nothing. The Carthaginians were still the main naval power im the mediterranean at that time. Something trivial like that would be ignored in comparison to obtaining supremacy in the mediterranean.\n\nBut the point of the hypothetical is that the Romans develop a better boat or something, right? Wait - I don't want to defend a counterfactual here. But also I kind of wish people were more respectful of the scope and intent of the question.\n\n&gt;I've always thought about this. I don't know a lot about Roman naval capabilities, but I always thought if they did settle North America, if and when the Roman empire collapsed in Europe, the North American empire might have stayed around, and continued to thrive while Europe was going through the dark ages. Unfortunately I'm sure the story would have been the same for the Native Americans, just a few thousand years earlier.\n\nThis is a very poor attempt at entertaining the hypothetical, and it does extreme injustice to the American side of the question.\n\n",

Note that the North Korean population at the time is estimated to be around 8 to 9 million people. Also note that not all of these civilian deaths could have come from bombings in particular.\n\nIn other words, yeah, it’s not 30%. The only way you can get a 30% figure is if you count all North Korean casualties – civilian and military. At maximum from the sources cited here, you get a figure of 25%.\n\nAnd when it comes to casualties, a freaking 5% difference is HUGE. 5% of about 9 million people is about 450 thousand people. THAT IS NOT A SMALL DIFFERENCE. This isn’t like eating 5% of a box of chocolates if the box had like 5 pieces. This is 450 thousand fucking people, who you just declared dead because you went to a site that promotes the idea of a New World Order among other things. Good fucking job.\n\nIf you’re wondering why the numbers seem to vary wildly with sources, the problem is that casualties from the Korean War are really hard to come by. It’s difficult to get an estimate of casualties from the war, partially because not everyone agrees on what to include and partially because the North Korean government is rather secretive.\n\nThat being said, I think we can conclude in this case that 1) 30% of the North Korean population did not die because of bombings, and 2) you really should not use fucking conspiracy-mongering websites to support your points.\n\nAs a side note, I should add [this response from /r/AskHistorians](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1c29lu/wednesday_ama_north_korea/c9d594j?context=1) in terms on whether all of the bombings could be considered war crimes (which was implied in the original post):\n\n&gt; **How accurate do you think these charges [i.e. “bombing dams, causing famines, massive dropping of napalm on civilian populations, destruction of more than 1/3 of buildings in NK through aerial bombardment”] are?** They're accurate, although there's a touch of presentism to the argument that they should be classified as war crimes. We would consider such actions to be war crimes today, but in the 1950s with limited targeting technology, repurposed World War II equipment, and a very different attitude on both sides to the nature and purpose of war, they were standard operating procedure.\n\nThe user goes on to state that in their personal opinion, you could call it morally indefensible even by the standards of the time. However, it is noted that the argument does contain some presentism.\n\n&gt; and installed a fascist regime in South Korea.\n\nOh goddamn it, no. \n\nOkay, so the first leader of South Korea, backed by the US government, was Syngman Rhee. An anti-Communist, he was the first president of the provisional government of the Republic of Korea, and later the first president of South Korea. \n\nYes, during his regime, he was rather authoritarian. Yes, he curtailed political dissent, and yes his regime did oversee massacres of leftists. You can argue that he was a freaking dictator, and you probably aren’t even wrong. But no, this does not fucking mean that the South Korean government was fascist.\n\n&gt; [One common definition of fascism focuses on three concepts: the fascist negations of anti-liberalism, anti-communism and anti-conservatism; nationalist authoritarian goals of creating a regulated economic structure to transform social relations within a modern, self-determined culture; and a political aesthetic of romantic symbolism, mass mobilization, a positive view of violence, and promotion of masculinity, youth and charismatic leadership.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facism#Definitions)\n\nThere is a specific definition for fascism, and the South Korean government of the 1950s, while rather anti-Communist and repressive, isn’t actually fascist.\n\n[From /r/AskHistorians](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/22ox1w/what_is_fascism/cgoz902):\n\n&gt; Unlike socialists and communists, fascists wanted to cure modern society’s alienation through the creation of a hierarchal state made up of different social classes working together for the benefit of the nation. This is called ‘corporatism’ and is fascism’s only real contribution to economic thought. The competing segments of industrial society would be united by the leader act entirely through the state, which incidentally would preserve existing capitalist hierarchies and strengthen them. Fascists were for a sort of inverted social-democracy which would give social services to its members but not to anyone else. If you were not a member of the nation or the Volksgemeinschaft - tough luck. This is why many people participated in Fascist and Nazi organizations like the DAP or Hitler Youth; if you did not actively participate in the national or racial community, you were not a part of it and would be socially ostracized (or worse) and denied state benefits. They didn't necessarily believe in fascist ideology, and many opposed it, but the fascist state required them to participate in it.\n\n&gt; The major difference between fascism and socialism is that the former was all about preserving hierarchy and bourgeois society, while getting rid of industrial alienation through the creation of a totalitarian society. Mussolini thought that by giving up your individuality to the totalitarian state, you could have your energies and efforts multiplied by its services. Paradoxically, by surrendering individuality, alienation would somehow disappear. In industrial societies, fascism was popular with the middle class because it offered a cultural and social revolution which would keep hierarchies and fortify them through corporatism. Unlike conservatism, fascism wanted a cultural revolution that would create a “New Fascist Man” who had no individuality separate from the state. This is why it was appealing to the middle class; it let them vent their frustrations about modern society and be little revolutionaries while simultaneously protecting their property and position in the social hierarchy.\n\n&gt; The emphasis on maintaining private property and hierarchy was what made fascists hate socialists and communists. Fascism marketed itself as the “Third Way” between Liberalism, which was responsible for alienation and the post-war Wilsonian order, and Socialism, which threatened to take bourgeois property in an economic revolution. Conservatives and fascists usually got along because they both hated the same things, but most conservatives failed to understand the revolutionary aspect of fascism and believed they could be controlled to curtail workers’ rights and revise the Paris Treaties, which didn't really work out.\n\nR5 continued [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/294d23/user_in_rsrsdiscussion_claims_that_30_of_north/cihaw1p).",

Some of the leaders in the new civ game have committed the cardinal sin of not being white, so of course we get bunch of racist spiel about how non-coloured people have never achieved anything and how the inclusion of any non-white characters is just a token gesture to minorities.\n\nANYWAY, /u/lettersaremoving gets us going by attempting to fight the racism with bad history.\n\n&gt;Im not entirely sure where that sentiment comes from, Guns Germs and Steel is essentially really hated by most historians, and the only real reason why Europe shot ahead of the rest of the world is because of the discovery of the New world and its subsequent colonization.\n\nI appreciate what he's trying to do - saying that there's nothing inherently special about Europe, and that it 'shot ahead' because of a chance discovery and the consequent flow of riches.\n\nBut he could not be more wrong. I don't even know how he brought Guns, Germs and Steel into it. The original sentiment he's referring to is [this vaguely racist notion](http://np.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/28ze1h/beyond_earth_ingame_image_of_four_leaders_a_lot/ciga8dr):\n\n&gt;That's only because we kickass. Not our fault we've created modern civilization as we know it and no one else did.\n\nWell, it's not our fault that we created the self-centric history curriculum that this guy (and the rest of us!) learned about in school. The grand narrative of how Europeans went places and did things for two thousand years. But this sub has had plenty of discussions about Euro-centrism, so we'll leave that there.\n\nGetting back to the previous comment, it feels like /u/lettersaremoving has tried to shoe-horn Guns, Germs and Steel into his comment. For those not familiar with it, GG&amp;S is a book that says Europe's technological and political supremacy were inevitable for a variety of what were basically geographic reasons. It's interesting, but it's also enormously deterministic. It deals with history in broad strokes using the power of hindsight - ie it sees the past and tries to figure out why what happened was inevitable, instead of seeing our history as one of many possibilities. It's also fairly dismissive of human agency, and a number of other important factors. So yes, it's not widely regarded as an academic work, and is in itself bad, or at least reductive, history. But it's also irrelevant to what /u/lettersaremoving was addressing. It feels like he's using this as an opportunity to repeat something he's read elsewhere on reddit. Compounded with \"hated by most historians\", and it feels like something I would have written in my mid-teens.\n\nAnd I apologise for taking so long to get to the meat of it, but this leads us to the first bit of really bad history. \n\n&gt; the only real reason why Europe shot ahead of the rest of the world is because of the discovery of the New world and its subsequent colonization.\n\nInteresting opinion. To look at it though, we have to decide what \"shot ahead\" means. I'm guessing something similar to [this](http://i.imgur.com/zbue8vU.jpg) or [this.](http://i161.photobucket.com/albums/t206/viroteconsidon/GenericTechTreeEra1.jpg) Shot ahead in this linear progression of technology. Ick. But let's take it at face value. So the exploitation of the New World led to European dominance? Of course, that explains why Spain is the foremost industrial power in the world, and at the cutting edge of technology. No, no, wait, no it doesn't. Spain and Portugal were the two countries initially most heavily involved in colonisation, commerce and exploration - not just in the Americas, but across the world. And the wealth that these practices bought them made these states incredibly powerful. *But it did not have a transformative impact*, at least in the way that /u/lettersaremoving is talking about. By 1700, Spain and Portugal were deep in decline. Spain's throne was a prize for the other great powers of Europe - Spain itself was a non-entity.\n\nSo what did the New World do for Europe? It provided an incredible flow of wealth and resources to colonial powers. It introduced new foods and changed cultures. It shaped the politics of the continent. In many ways its exploitation and the resultant wars defined and empowered many important European institutions. But *it was not* in and of itself technologically transformative.\n\nIf you want to talk about Europe \"shooting ahead\", you probably want to talk about the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. You want to talk about innovations in production and warfare. You want to talk about urbanisation and industry, and unprecedented technological growth. And you want to make a very clear distinction between each of those things and simple wealth.\n\n/u/lettersaremoving's edit:\n\n&gt;EDIT: If you are downvoting me, im genuinely curious. Would you say that Western European nations were well on its way to becoming global power house even before colonization of the new world?\n\nAs you'll see later, his question isn't really a question. When people do propose alternatives later on, he dismisses them. But saying that European powers either were or weren't on the path to becoming a \"power house\" is absurdly simplistic. The Portuguese began exploring the coast of Africa the better part of a century before Columbus ever reached the Americas, and reached India for the first time by sea less than decade after that event. Why the Portuguese were the first people to establish such a vast maritime network and trade empire is an interesting question in and of itself, but it was not conditional upon the discovery of the New World. Even then, it is difficult to call what they did \"shooting ahead\". They were able to project their power widely as a result of their large maritime empire, but with nowhere near the force of the British and French in the nineteenth century. And if we're talking about technological \"progress\", we know how much that helped them in the long run. Anyway, more from our friend letters:\n\n&gt;Nope, Europe was hardly ahead of anyone in terms of economy and military in the 1400's. I would say the reason for Europeans colonization was the Catholicism's need to convert people, which essentially started with the first crusades (and essentially the first European colony in the Middle East, the Kingdom of Jerusalem).\n\nJeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesssssssssssssssssssssssssssuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuusssssssssssssssssssssss that's so much worse than anything before. Jerusalem was a *colony*, the Crusades took place entirely because Christians wanted new converts in the Middle East, and colonization was driven by a desire to create new Christians. I wish I'd just written that in my essay this semester. That would have saved so much work! But really. *Maybe* Jerusalem was a colony in a broad sense of the word, but it's disingenuous to use it in the context of what was going on in the Americas. And as for the Europeans' religious motives? Look at how the Spanish treated the Incan Emperor Atahualpa. They hid troops in a plaza while they made a token effort to have him submit to the Pope, before the Spaniards rushed out, killed his entourage, kidnapped him, and pillaged his camp for treasure. Now call me a cynic, but what with the pre-planned ambush and all, it feels like a peaceful conversion was not the foremost goal of the Spaniards. And this was typical of the attitudes of the European powers. Many natives were converted as a result of the European conquests, but this was not the goal - the goal was profit. The vast wealth of the Americas. That is not to say that the colonisers did not consider the spreading of Christianity to be a noble goal - simply that it was not the primary cause of their endeavours. The Scramble for Africa in the late nineteenth century is a much better example of conquest for the purported sake of spreading Christianity.\n\n&gt;In terms of economy, the exploitation of the new world through colonization brought unimaginable amount of wealth in to Western Europe. This wealth would go on to fuel the flowering of European culture, technology and enlightenment.\n\nI love that he unironically refers to wealth fuelling not *the Enlightenment*, which is in itself debatable, but the enlightenment in general of the European peoples. ^^^Insert ^^^circlejerk ^^^comment ^^^here.\n\n&gt;There is really no other way to see it.\n\nOh really?\n\n&gt;Look at Central and Eastern Europe which did not have the wealth of colonies that western European countries had or the benefits of trade routes like the mediterranean states of Italy. Of course it still took the European states a long time before they could start colonizing on the old world, but the fact remains, without colonization of the new world, its pretty hard to argue about how Europe shot ahead of almost everyone else.\n\nPutting aside that the comment seems to degenerate into gibberish at the end, *what*? He might be acknowledging that the Americas weren't the only source of wealth in the entire world, but he does so at the cost of marginalising everyone east of Germany. Except wait, the Germans never really made a large foray into the New World, nor were they on the Mediterranean! What does this mean for /u/lettersaremoving's preconceived narrative of world history? Is he unfairly marginalising the achievements of Eastern Europe because his high school history class never mentioned it? *Say it isn't true!*\n\nI'm running out of space because frankly I'm terrible at staying on point, but I'll keep going in the comments.",

        "text": "I'm aware that the History Channel is the butt of more than a few jokes in this sub. I know that no channel which broadcasts Ancient Aliens or which is quite so fixated on Hitler can be trusted with anything important. However, what can I say? I'm a naive optimist, and I wanted to see if this particular series was any good. I'd heard good things about it from a friend, and so in I dived.\n\nIn the short answer, it's terrible. About ten minutes into the first episode, I decided I make my own series of posts about the show and each of its episodes, pointing out some of the problematic art and costuming choices, the oversimplification or over-aggrandising of certain events (I'm looking at you, Battle of Megiddo). About five minutes later, I realised there's not enough alcohol in this whole damn city to make me want to sit through another episode of this shite. It's not that the history it chooses to represent is all that bad. Sure, the costuming it chooses to use is pretty bad ([this](http://imgur.com/2gdHNB0.png) is how the show chooses to represent African hunter-gatherers, for instance. That's ritual paint - it's not supposed to be worn while hunting, nor would it have been), but that's not the worst part of it. Not by far.\n\nI think the first indication I got of what the real terrible history of the show is came with the line \"All of human history stems from these migrants\" in reference to migration out of Africa. In a show called \"The Story of All of Us,\" the History Channel chooses to define \"all\" not as universal humanity, but rather as those who left Africa. It leaves the wealth of African history behind in that phrase, classifying native Africans not as being part of \"all,\" but as not included. You might think I'm making too big a deal out of one line (understand, though, that the show doesn't have too many lines - it's mostly flashy graphics, loud noises, and random celebrity interviews, including one with a man that I'm pretty sure is a cannibal, judging from how enthusiastic he is about discussing how to eat people), but it's a pattern that continues time and time and time again throughout the episode. \n\nAfter discussing migration out of Africa, for instance, the show talks about Neolithic peoples in France, showing them huddled in caves with menacing-looking glaciers just outside the cave door. It presents France and Europe more generally as the home of domestication of dogs, with lovely shots of [snuggle wolves and people](http://imgur.com/KdlwaWO.png) all hunky dory together. However, it's debated where and how domestication began,  with some dog skeletons being found in [Belgium and Russia](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/27240370/#.U6q9CfmwJJM), yes, but that by no means means that the French (or Western Europeans) are responsible for domestication. Indeed, [this](http://www.uchospitals.edu/news/2014/20140116-domesticated-dogs.html) study suggests that dogs likely were domesticated in a range of places rather than one, a theory which the show disregards completely in favour of kids, dogs, and France.\n\nThis isn't the only time it does this, asserting one and only one origin for something. [This lady](http://imgur.com/rvZBvOk.png) and this lady only is apparently responsible for the agricultural revolution. She lived in Mesopotamia and changed the world. While the agricultural revolution that started in Mespotamia was hugely influential, it's grossly misleading to say it was the only one, or that it was the work of only one person. There were [many different domestication events](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic_Revolution#Domestication_of_plants), all happening around the world and around the same time period. While the show asserts that without the Mesopotamian lady, there would be no agricultural, this is hugely inaccurate as agriculture sprang up in many places at once.\n\nThe same with writing. Once again, there's an assertion that writing was the sole invention of Mesopotamia [but this isn't the case](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_writing#Inventions_of_writing). At the very least, the invention of writing was separate in Mesoamerica and likely in China as well, and it's debated whether the writing systems in Egypt, India, and Romania were developed independently. My point here, though, is that the show says with absolute, black-and-white certainty that writing was invented in Mesopotamia with no consideration for nuance or actual historical accuracy. Rather than saying that this sprang up in a lot of places - as was the case - it instead places all the accomplishment of writing on one particular area and one particular group of people, excluding the others from that moniker of \"all.\"\n\nAs a final example, the moniker of \"first recorded battle\" is given to the Battle of Megiddo. The History Channel has a thing for Megiddo. I don't claim to understand it, but it does get tedious to see Megiddo time and time again. Now, I know that Megiddo is held to be the first battle to be recorded *reliably*, but that's a very different statement than the statement the show makes, which is that it's the first recorded battle. [The Stele of the Vultures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stele_of_the_Vultures), for instance, tells the story of a war between the Mesopotamian city-states of Lagash and Umma which took place by 2350 BCE at the latest (full text of the stele is [here](http://www.thenagain.info/classes/sources/ummalagash.html), if anyone's interested). While it may be incomplete, it is a battle we know of that took place well before the ~1500 BCE of Megiddo. True, the details are not as complete or reliable, but the show never claimed reliability. It claimed *first*, which is not the case.\n\nBut it gets worse. Oh does it get worse. When the show discusses religion and the development of religious tradition, it says (and I quote): \"With agriculture comes the beginnings of religion.\" And oh boy. I'm not sure where to go with that other than to throw my hands in the air and say \"What are you even thinking?\" While the exact definition of religion is hotly debated, [spirituality, at least, is far, far older than agriculture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic_Religion). The only thing I can think here is that religion is being defined in terms of modern, organised religion, but the multitude of flaws with that definition aside, it's still extremely difficult to claim that agriculture and religion developed around the same time - agriculture in Mesopotamia (the site the show uses) likely developed around 10000 BCE, and Judaism (probably the religion the show is going for since it's old and has a book) dates back to 2000-1000 BCE (later, depending on what you classify as \"modern Judaism\"). Even Hinduism  arose from ancient Vedic religions around 2000 - 1750 BCE. Both are well after agriculture, but equally, religion and spirituality had existed in a form for thousands of years before that. To define religion as being organised is mind-blowingly bad, and reveals that what the show means by \"religion\" isn't religion as scholars understand it, but rather, religion in terms of organised, western religions. \n\nAnd then comes what I think may be the show's crowning achievement in terms of face-palming groan-worthiness. You remember the French cave people? The ones who invented dogs? They also painted [this!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cueva_de_las_Manos#mediaviewer/File:SantaCruz-CuevaManos-P2210651b.jpg). [This guy](http://imgur.com/VbsUAqC.png) did it all by himself. You might notice, though, that that guy doesn't look too terribly much like [these people](http://www.limbos.org/sur/tehu/tehue7.jpg). You might also notice that those people don't look particularly French. Who are they? Well, they are members of the Tehuelche people, the ancestors of whom probably painted the cave. They live in Argentina. Not France. Argentina. That's right. In its urge to make the history of \"all\" instead the history of Europeans, the show appropriates Native South American art, says it's a product of Europe, and moves on. It's wrong on so many levels. \n\nI could go on. There's so much to say about this show and every bad thing it's spewing, but for everyone's sanity, I'll stop. My problem here, though, isn't necessarily the history. Well, okay, for a channel called the History Channel, this is a problem, but it's not an unexpected one. The bigger problem, I think, is having the audacity to call a show \"The Story of All of Us,\" and then blatantly ignore massive swaths of human history, even going so far as to misrepresent, appropriate, and explicitly exclude at times. The problem here is that's it's perpetuating the idea that history is the history of white people and white civilisation, and that everything sprang from white domains. That's not acceptable, and it's very, very bad history. In fact, for a channel with as much viewership as the History Channel, it goes beyond bad history. It's flat-out dangerous. ",

Indeed, many people just blindly accept that Anthony Johnson (a black man) was the first slaveowner in what we now know as the United States. Would you be surprised to find out that they are [wrong?] (http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1qerrx/racist_meme_about_timetraveling_khazar_jew/) To quote from the explanation supplied by /u/Plowbeast:\n\n&gt; Genealogists and historians describe John Punch as the first documented slave because he was an indentured servant sentenced to life in servitude as punishment for escaping in 1640. His master Hugh Gwyn was legally recognized as a slave owner before Anthony Johnson.[16] The Punch case was significant because it established the disparity between his sentence as a negro and that of the two European servants who escaped with him (one described as Dutch and one as a Scotchman). This is what happened in Johnson v. Parker. Even though Casor had two white planters confirming his claim to freedom from his indentured contract with Johnson, the court still ruled in Johnson's favor.[21]\"\n\nOuch, strike 1.\n\nEdit: /u/smileyman added: \"He wasn't even one of the first. The Spanish had slaves in their colonies long before there was an English settlement in North America. He's only one of the first if you limit it to English colonies in North America, and you have a loose definition of what \"one of the first\" means.\"\n\n&gt; All races kept slaves all throughout history\n\nI mean, yes, but what does that have to do with history of black slavery in America? I would find it difficult to explain that because all races at one point had slaves, that somehow meant blacks in America couldn't complain about their conditions. What the hell kind of deflection is this? \n\nAnother thing that must be pointed out: Notice how he groups people into \"races\" and not \"nations\" or \"countries\"? Yeah, that'll come up later in this explanation. It's an attempt to both diminish the experience of Africans in slavery, and to enhance the supposed superiority of white people in abolishing slavery. But I'll go into that later.\n\n&gt; When the Trans-Atlantic slaveships docked at African slave-markets to buy slaves, they bought slaves who were already slaves. It was Arab Muslims and Black Africans themselves who captured members of rival tribes and took them to the coastal slave-markets to sell to the Whites and Jews. White people didn’t go into Africa and kidnap free black people. \n\nIf by \"white people\" you include \"Portuguese\", [they most certainly fucking did.] (http://exploringafrica.matrix.msu.edu/students/curriculum/m7b/activity1.php) That's basic history. There were definitely slave raids done by various countries, including European ones.\n\nIn reference to the blacks enslaving other blacks, I ask again: How does this diminish what slaves went through when they arrived in America? Does he honestly think that slaves just went and said \"Oh well, don't have anybody but myself to blame!\" Of course they fucking didn't, because I'm *pretty* sure they hated those who sold them into slavery. Trying to group all African civilizations/nations into the category of \"black people\" is absurd. That's not even mentioning the difference between chattel slavery and the type practiced by most African civilizations pre-Atlantic slave trade.\n\nAnother interesting topic is the relationship between African kingdoms and European traders. It's a complex issue, so I'll defer to experts in the field. Guyanese historian Walter Rodney (1972) argues in *How Europe Underdeveloped Africa* that it was an unequal relationship, with Africans being forced into a \"colonial\" trade with the more economically developed Europeans, exchanging raw materials and human resources (i.e. slaves) for manufactured goods. He argued that it was this economic trade agreement dating back to the 16th century that led to Africa being underdeveloped in his own time.\n\nAnne C. Bailey in her book *African Voices of the Atlantic Slave Trade: Beyond the Silence and the Shame* comments that:\n\n&gt; [\"To see Africans as partners implies equal terms and equal influence on the global and intercontinental processes of the trade. Africans had great influence on the continent itself, but they had no direct influence on the engines behind the trade in the capital firms, the shipping and insurance companies of Europe and America, or the plantation systems in Americas. They did not wield any influence on the building manufacturing centers of the West.\"] (http://books.google.co.za/books?id=YrIjNMu5_vsC&amp;q=Africans+were+equal+partners#v=snippet&amp;q=Africans%20were%20equal%20partners&amp;f=false)\n\nStrike 2.\n\n&gt; They barely needed to get off their ships to buy slaves, it was like buying McDonalds at a drive-through. The slaves were already at the slave-market in chains, ready to go.\n\nIf I was a McDonald's rep, I would try to sue the shit out of anyone trying to invoke the golden arches in some sort of slavery apologetic. They can do that, right? Help me out here lawyers!\n\n&gt; In the 16th – 18th century, Africans enslaved 1.5 million White Europeans in the Barbary Slave Trade. \n\nSee what I'm talking about? He groups all Africans into the Barbary Pirates and groups pretty much all of the Europeans into \"White\". Other than that though, I'm admittedly ignorant as to the scale and effects of the Barbary Slave Trade. Though you don't need to be an expert to see that:\n\n&gt; This was more brutal than working on a plantation or as a domestic servant.\n\nIs a load of bullshit in more ways than one. Ignoring arguments of what counts as \"worse\", he has effectively tried to diminish the severity of slavery in America. I've asked this question more than once and if anyone can answer it, please respond: **How does this in any way reduce what happened to slaves in America?**. I guess it's easy to make an argument when you ignore the most glaring issues with your position. \n\n&gt; Native Americans and Jews owned Black slaves too, but no one seems to assign a collective guilt to modern Native Americans and Jews for their slavery. \n\nProbably because neither group were the ones who owned the majority of slaves, nor were they the ones who created the demand for aforementioned slaves? I'm also fairly certain the Civil War wasn't fought because the \"Native Americans and Jews\" wanted to keep their slaves.\n\n&gt; In fact, Jews were the biggest slave-owners in America per capita.\n\nTHE JEEEEWWWWWSSS!!! He provides a link to the Wikipedia article of Slavery in the United States...which says nothing about Jewish slave ownership. Trust me, I looked. Couldn't find a thing about it. We'll just chalk this one up to the ole \"Make shit up and see what sticks\" tactic that is oh so common on Stormfront. In further response, I'll include a link that actually *does* talk about [Jewish views on slavery.] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_views_on_slavery#cite_note-ColumbiaHistory-12)\n\nEdit: /u/gingerkid1234 included a great comment about this [below.] (http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/290ji1/racist_user_comments_on_history_of_black_slavery/cigo1yq)\n\n&gt; Whites were the first people to stop slavery in modern times\n\nThis is where I expound on the fact that trying to classify multiple nations and countries as one uniform group is just plain wrong and shows a blatant ideological bias. Imagine if you went back in time to Spain in 1542, and told a Spaniard that they were basically the same as the English, and the French, and the Portuguese, and most other European nations. Do you think they would approve of that? Unless you are completely oblivious to European history, you'd assume that they wouldn't take too kindly to such a grouping. So why do it in modern times? These nations weren't having get-togethers to discuss how to advance the white race agenda. They didn't combine to form the Alliance of White People. This point is hilariously absurd.\n\nAlso, notice his little trick of adding \"in modern times\" to the end of his statement? That's because the first kingdom to abolish slavery in some aspect was the Qin Dynasty in China. The next one? The Xin Dynasty. \n\n&gt; whereas slavery still continues in Africa to this day.\n\nRinse and repeat. Doesn't diminish what slaves suffered in America. Also fails to acknowledge the incredibly complex relationship between African nations, and why slavery continues to be an issue in the continent that was pillaged for its inhabitants. \n\nI would also like to point out that [it is not just African nations] (http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/10/17/this-map-shows-where-the-worlds-30-million-slaves-live-there-are-60000-in-the-u-s/) that have issues with modern day slavery. To try and portray slavery as a problem limited to Africa is just wrong. Nothing else to say about that.\n\n&gt; Less than 2% of Whites in America ever owned slaves\n\nHey! [We've dealt with this one before.] (http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1yh69t/only_a_tiny_portion_of_white_southerners_owned/) It's misleading at best. I'll include the percentages of each state's population that was slaves right [here] (http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:US-SlaveryPercentbyState1790-1860.png) and ask you to consider what /u/turtleeatingalderman said: \"...the institution of slavery was defended by an overwhelming majority of white southerners, even by those (small farmers, etc.) who didn't immediately benefit from it economically.\"\n\n&gt; Only 5% of the black slaves transported across the Atlantic actually went to the modern U.S. Most in fact went to Latin America to serve Hispanic slave-owners. But we don’t look at modern Hispanics as evil slave-owners.\n\n**YOU FOOL. YOU HAVE MERELY GIVEN WHAT \"IS\", NOT WHAT \"OUGHT\" BE. YOU HAVE GIVEN NO CONNECTION BETWEEN THE TWO AND INSTEAD HAVE COMMITTED AN EGREGIOUS META-ETHICAL ERROR.**\n\nBut honestly, who looks at modern white Americans and calls them evil slave owners? Seriously, is there anybody that does that? Does anyone here know of an instance of this happening? Exactly. \n\nFuck this racist piece of shit, this isn't just the 3rd strike, this is the fucking 81st and the game is over. Historians pitched a perfect game and Racists forgot their equipment back at the Little League field.",

Im sorry, I just had to share it here. So lets handle this piece-meal. \nThe Greek knowledge from the classical era had a profound impact on early Islamic academia, no doubt about that. However, to suggest that all the Muslims did is translate that knowledge and stagnate is so asinine that it makes me want to fight a cassowary. The Islamic scholars from the \"Golden Age\" not only translated this knowledge, they debated it, they analyzed it, and they expanded on it. In fact, when Europeans \"re-discovered\" the classical Greek works, sparking the Renaissance, this was via the Islamic civilization. Secondly, the Library of Alexandria by 642, when it was captured by the 2nd/3rd Caliph, was a shadow of its former self. The library was first burned by the Romans, and it never quite reached its former glory again. Never hear anyone badmouthing the Romans for that (not that the should), or claiming the Romans only made any scientific achievement *at all* because of exposure with the Greeks (which is BS), though the Romans were arguably *more* influenced by the Greeks than the Arabs. \n\nBut this:\n&gt;\"Once you people burned it down and the Greeks left . . . there has been nothing but death and destruction since.\"\n\nis where I lose it. The Library was burned in 642. The Islamic Golden Age came to an end **600 YEARS LATER**. In that time span, Muslims literally contributed to and pioneered virtually every single field of contemporary science. I'll just rattle off a few disciplines today that today would not be what they are without Islamic contribution: math, astronomy, optics, chemistry, biology, medicine, warfare, law, philosophy, government, music, etc. Now think about what these academic fields would transform into as time passes, and how this might have effected the look of our modern world. \n\nWhat's ironic is, the opposite of what this person said could actually be argued: That Europe would look nothing like what it does without contact with Islamic civilization. Major European pioneers in science from Copernicus to John Locke were influenced by Islamic scholarship. The European Renaissance and Enlightenment are both inherently, intrinsically, and intimately tied to the accomplishments of the scholars from that era. But see, what pisses me of the most is not that this person is so ignorant of the history that he/she is commenting on, but rather that people view knowledge as a 'possessive' thing that is 'yours' and 'mine' and not a universal, cyclic phenomenon. Buddha say everything is connected. ",

        "text": "Ok, ok, guys, I know it's a slow /r/badhistory day, and this is really really  low hanging fruit, but I just felt like doing this because it's summer and I'm quite bored (and also I needed some new flair).\n\nSo what appears on /r/changemyview?\n\n[This](http://np.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/28ydjm)\n\nAnd while I know many people have already called him out on it and disputed it, I felt like this needed the full /r/badhistory treatment, no matter how many times shit like this is done before, or how often this topic appears on this subreddit. \n\nSo anyway, what do we have on our hands?\n\nA lot of apologist junk and stuff we have to swim through, but we'll go through it all one sentence (or section) at a time. \n\n&gt;1) He killed about 11 million people he deemed to be physically, ethnically or mentally undesirable. Almost 6 million of these people were Jewish, the rest were a mix of Soviets, Poles, physically/mentally disabled and a few more. This is generally why people think Hitler is super evil, and this is a terrible tragedy. \n\nOk, yeah, sure. I can accept that. I'll give you the \"Partially correct hay in the needlestack\" Award. \n\n&gt;However many dictators believe that they are genetically superior to many other ethnicities in or around their nation, and many commit genocides.\n\nAh yes, the \"everyone else did it\" cliche. Yes, a genocide is still bad no matter how many people you kill or what ethnicity you're going for. No, a genocide isn't less bad because Stalin did it too, and no, it does not make you any less of a horrible person. \n\nAnd also, [many dictators?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_word)\n\n&gt;The only thing that stands out with Hitler's holocaust is the numbers. This doesn't make Hitler more evil because he killed more people, if anything that shows how efficient and determined the Nazi's were. The body count doesn't indicate more or less evilness.\n\nI feel myself getting dumber reading this. \n\nI don't think this really needs an explanation, but generally, if we're going with your subjective and nonsensical unit of \"evils,\" then I'm sure systematic and purposeful genocide of 11 million people would be in the kiloevils. \n\nAlso, I think we should do an experiment: let's kill 12 million people, and see if people call us \"literally Hitler,\" or \"worse than Hitler.\" \n\nPoint is, all this shite is evil, and yet at the same time, it's a fallacy to rank actions or people by how \"evil\" they were. \n\n&gt;So why is Hitler more evil than those dictators? It's not because Hitler hated the Jews more than other rulers hated oppressed minorities, many rulers hated other ethnic groups just as much as Hitler would have, especially during the Colonial era, when anti-semetism was very popular. \n\nI'm sure [Jews gaining legal rights in post-revolution America](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism#17th_century) meant that antisemitism was *very* popular. Also, TIL Hitler wasn't that evil because everyone hated the Jews. \n\n\n&gt;Now let's look at the ways Hitler was good. He loved animals and was against animal cruelty, he was even a vegetarian.\n\nIs this supposed to make the genocide of 11 million people any less cruel?\n\nJews and disabled people are rubbish. But hey, cats are cool. \n\n&gt; Hitler was very good with children, being affectionately referred to as 'uncle Adi' by German youths. \n\nJohn Wayne Gacy was very good with children, being affectionately referred to as \"Pogo the Clown\" by American youths. \n\nYes, so indoctrination of the German youth to love you doesn't make you that bad of a guy. Thanks, Goebbels. \n\n[Because utter devotion to the Fuehrer was definately not taught while one was in the Hitler Youth](http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007820)\n\nHe may have gotten this idea from the multitudes of pictures featuring Hitler with children, obviously not used for propaganda purposes.\n\n&gt;Hitler also sought of loved his country, in my opinion that's a destructive belief that leads to more harm than good (that's obvious in the case of Germany) but still, he did love his country and most Germans, which counts for something I think. \n\nHitler's not that evil. He loved his country so much that he was willing to subjugate several European nations and invade Russia to give his country that sweet, sweet Lebensraum. \n\nBut hear that? Patriotism makes you good. I guess every single child who recites the \"Pledge of Allegiance\" is now going to moral heaven. \n\n&gt;He was also a nice guy according to many accounts.\n\n[TIL the Night of the Long Knives don't real](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_of_the_Long_Knives)\n\nAnd where did you get that idea from? [Here?](http://imgur.com/user/LordBlango/favorites/sYcGG11)\n\nAlso, to quote:\n\n[Findings from the Coolidge et al. (2007) study suggested that Hitler suffered from a\nmultitude of Axis I and Axis II disorders. There was a consensus among the expert\nratters that Hitler reached the criterion threshold for a range of personality disorders\nincluding) paranoid, antisocial, narcissistic,  and sadistic personality disorders; the\nfeatures of which are all consistent with detailed reports of his adult life.](http://www.psychologyandsociety.org/__assets/__original/2012/01/Hyland_et_al.pdf)\n\n[Hitler receives a 56 for the GAF, Axis V. This because he, socially, exhibits moderate symptoms- notably, his severe outbursts of anger. He was, however, able to function with high precision. \"Hitler could act with high rationality and paralyzing effectiveness. He was a consummately able political and military tactician, until something went wrong, and he was reduced to terrible rages.\"](http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~kld22/index240srep.html)\n\nSo in other words, I'm not too sure Hitler was that kind of \"nice guy\" that you suppose he is. \n\nMoving on...\n\n&gt;Hitler also rebuilt Germany, turning it from a bankrupt country to a nation that would nearly destroy the world in just a few years.\n\nApparently, [5 million soldiers](http://www.feldgrau.com/stats.html) is enough to face all other world powers at the time.\n\n&gt; Hitler wasn't really a political genius but he did advance Germany's economic recovery by a lot.\n\nYeah, but he didn't really do it nicely. \n\nTo quote:\n\n[...emphasized building up the nation's military defenses, disregarding the restrictions imposed on Germany by the Treaty of Versailles after the German defeat in World War I.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-Year_Plan)\n\n[whether this helped the average German is a matter of debate—while more Germans had jobs, a focus on rearmament meant rationing in food, clothing, metal, and wood [30] for most citizens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Nazi_Germany#Pre-war_economy:_1933.E2.80.931939)\n\nAnd from Hitler himself:\n\n[I consider it necessary for the Reichstag to pass the following two laws: 1) A law providing the death penalty for economic sabotage and 2) A law making the whole of Jewry liable for all damage inflicted by individual specimens of this community of criminals upon the German economy, and thus upon the German people](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Nazi_Germany#Pre-war_economy:_1933.E2.80.931939)\n\nOf course, some people would argue (see last link) that this would indicate the inherent \"politics over business\" approach Hitler had, and there is debate on whether the policies Hitler set in the Four-Year-Plan were economical or political in nature. \n\n\n&gt;There are some more downsides to Hitler, he was a dictator and as soon as he came into power he revealed his dark side (night of the long knives is a good example of this). \n\nSomehow, I'm kind of glad to hear that. I'm just kind of surprised that he didn't use the Holocaust as an example. Oh wait...\n\n&gt;However there are other rulers out there that were far more evil but weren't given the opportunity to be as effective as Hitler. Just look at Francisco Franco, or Mussolini, or Stalin, Robert Mugabe, Pol Pot, Idi Amin, everyones favorite Kim Jong Il and his son. These men are in many ways more evil than Adolf Hitler.\n\nAll of these guys were more evil than Hitler! I know! Let's rank them all in terms of evilness! \n\nBut we all know why this is badhistory. From the great words of /u/henry_fords_ghost 7 months prior:\n\n&gt;As a general rule (and there are of course notable exceptions), anybody categorizing a historical figure as \"good\" or \"evil\" probably doesn't know what they're talking about.\n\nAnd he's quite right. The word \"evil\" is a simplification. It is used in order to categorize people in the past as people who should be respected, and people who should be stuffed into the very gates of hell. Unfortunately, like a lot of things, people, events and history is not as simple as \"black\" and \"white.\" It's inaccurate to call Hitler evil, much as it is inaccurate to call Hitler good. That goes with pretty much any other person in our history books. So while I understand that the guy who wrote the offending post attempted to blur the lines between them, he made the one mistake of utilizing way too many generalizations and misconceptions in his post. Not to mention a lot of it sounded like apologist ramble. \n\n&gt;Once again I'm not arguing that Hitler was in any way good. He was a terrible person, just not as terrible as everyone believes he is.\n\nWhatusay? Let's go back and take a look at something.\n\n&gt;Now let's look at the ways Hitler was good. He loved animals and was against animal cruelty, he was even a vegetarian.\n\nWow. So I'm guessing everything you said above there was irrelevant right? Which pretty much makes this entire post useless, I guess...\n\nAnd that's it...\n\nSo at the end of the day, remember. We can generalize that Hitler was a bad, bad man. Maybe he was good, but not in the ways that the post stated he was. However, not all things are in black and white, but \"Hitler wasn't THAT bad\" or \"Hitler is good\" isn't really a good topic to your thesis. \n\n\nAnyway, that's really all the time I have. (And also, I'm running out of space to write)\n\nSo for now, stay classy, /r/badhistory",

The first is the idea that the men went over the top knowing that they would die. For the most part that's inaccurate, as soldiers going over the top had a range of emotions, with some being quite confident in success, some just worrying about letting down their comrades, some afraid, and a few thinking that it was a waste of men and resources. The latter attitude has become the dominant one of WWI historiography, something that /u/NMW talks eloquently about in [this comment](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1pq02a/hearken_back_to_precolonialist_india_the_idea_of/cd4wbkg) about Basil Liddell-Hart.\n\n&gt; Another piece of badhistory is calling the generals idiots. Again this is part of the historiography of WWI, the idea that the generals sat safe and sound miles behind the lines with no idea or care about what the reality was like at the front line. The British Army saw something like a 33% casualty rate (wounded and killed) during WWI. Among British generals the casualty rate was 18.5%, which is a rather significant number.\n\n&gt; The final piece of badhistory is the idea that the commanders didn't try anything else. They tried many things. They tried digging tunnels under the opposing lines and then blowing the lines up (this would prove somewhat successful in limited trials). They tried poison gas. They tried tanks and other armored vehicles. They perfected the art of a rolling artillery barrage. This consisted of the artillery firing just ahead of the advancing soldiers in the hopes that it would keep the opposing forces pinned deep inside their trenches. They tried massing a large force at one point in the line while leaving a skeleton crew to guard the rest. They tried having the soldiers infiltrate no-man's-land at night time and launch the attacks in the morning from their positions. They tried small scale raids.\n\n&gt; They tried all sorts of different ideas, but all people seem to think about is going up over the trench.\n\n&gt; This belies the main point though, which is this--what else were they supposed to do? In the early days of WWI the battle fields were fluid. By the time trench warfare developed you basically had two fortified positions staring at each other. What does this poster think could have been done to take the forts? You have to attack them directly and any attack on a fortified position is going to have serious losses.\n\n&gt; They couldn't dig encircling trenches and move them closer to the objective (as was done at Petersburg in the American Civil War), because the trench system stretched across France. The only way to attack them was by direct assault.\n\nBut a WWI post on /r/badhistory would not be complete without quoting NMW himself, \n\n[On the apparent incompetence of allied leadership.](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1ue42t/how_accurate_is_blackadder_goes_forth/cehcb7b)\n\n&gt; Thank you for your reply, but I have a number of reservations about this comment.\n\n   &gt;&gt; Allied command had a tendency to be incompetent in WW1 which is portrayed in Blackadder.\n\n&gt; This is a widely repeated claim that has very little foundation in reality. As with any such massive enterprise, the tendency was towards, well... being average. Unremarkable competence and modest achievements. This view of Allied command being unremittingly hopeless is predicated in part on actual failures from time to time (notably, in the British case, at Loos and the opening of the Somme), but also upon the starkly populist editorialization of the war that began almost as soon as the war itself concluded. With over 1200 officers at the rank of Brigadier-General or above in the British Army alone during the course of the war, it would be simply unsupportable to actually insist that all of them just tended to be incompetent -- in reality there was, as with any such group, a wide variety of skill sets, temperaments, practical operating philosophies and so on.\n\n[Why did those idiots dig all those trenches?](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1p6ovv/whats_some_bad_first_world_war_history/cczgrj7)\n\n&gt; Here's a few big ones for me.\n\n&gt; \"Didn't the leaders know how stupid trench warfare was? Why did they wage war like that?\"\n\n&gt; It's a common thing, and it arises from a misconception about how trench warfare originated and why it developed the way it did. Trench warfare was simply an organic growth resulting from a stalled offensive. Every army in history has dug breastworks and trenches when besieging a city or when they're defending a city (look at some of the photos during the American Civil War of the trenches around Petersburg).\n\n&gt; The opposing army tries to flank the trenches of the defenders. The defenders throw out more troops to block the flanking attack. They dig in. This cycle repeats itself several times until you have hundreds of miles of trenches. Then you dig those trenches deeper and wider and make them more elaborate because you don't have much else to do and you want to be as comfortable and as well-fortified as possible.\n\n&gt; The British high command consistently and regularly executed soldiers for cowardice under fire and didn't care about them. In fact there were only 306 executions during the entirety of the war (British executions that is). That's rather astonishing considering the vast amounts of men that served under arms.\n\n[On the utter pointlessness of the entire conflict.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1p6ovv/whats_some_bad_first_world_war_history/cczfcqk)\n\n&gt; I disagree.\n\n&gt; The war was not an accident. You make that claim, and then mention several events which were definitely not coincidences. Austria-Hungary did not accidentally use Franz Ferdinand's assassination as an excuse to force war with Serbia. Germany did not accidentally ensure Austria-Hungary that it would receive support. Russia did not accidentally declare war on Austria-Hungary to support Serbia. Germany did not accidentally declare war on Russia and France, and Britain did not accidentally come to the the defence of Belgium. Every event which contributed to the war was the result of a positive decision to take action to support each particular country's interests. And these decisions were not 'failures'--it is a state's right, and indeed purpose, to pursue its own interests. These decisions had tragic consequences, but they were neither accidental nor wrong. The only way you can disapprove of these decisions is by employing hindsight which those involved did not have.\n\n&gt; Austrian aggression against Serbia was not normal. I can't think of a single major power which annexed another European nation in the period preceding the First World War. Austria embarked upon an aggressive course towards its neighbour with the full knowledge that it would provoke a Russian response. The assassination which served as the pretext need not have been significant; but the invasion of a sovereign state with a powerful ally was anything but normal, and it had predictably unusual consequences.\n\n&gt; The war wasn't pointless. As I've said, each belligerent went into it with their own particular goals in mind. Austria wanted to expand into the Balkans to preserve its great power status and reinforce the state's power against the burgeoning nationalism of her subject peoples. Germany wished to increase her power on the world stage, a goal which could be reached by defeating her colonial rivals of France and Britain and her European rival, Russia. Russia had interests in the Balkans and could not allow Austria-Hungary to grow dominant over the region. The Ottomans wished to capitalise on their good relations with Germany--the only European great power without territorial interests in the Ottoman Empire--and take coveted territory in the Caucasus and Egypt. France had no desire to see an undemocratic and expansionist Germany increase in power; an interest shared by Britain, whose security depended upon the Channel ports threatened by Germany's thrust into Belgium. To be completely clear--the belligerents got involved for a reason. They did not fight the war for fun. They had something to gain. Even if you approach the issue from a moral perspective (which you really shouldn't) you can't claim that an undemocratic Germany taking over large swathes of Russia and France would have been a good thing; especially since those resources would have almost inevitably been used to fight a second war to deprive France and Britain of their global positions and transfer their empires to Germany. It wasn't pointless.\n\n&gt; I'd urge you to pick up a modern book on the war (Gary Sheffield's Forgotten Victory is a good one) because your argument is, quite frankly, severely outdated.\n\nIf you don't already know, [it was kind of a war of German aggression.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1ijr21/til_when_coming_to_power_in_january_1933_the_nazi/cb5gje3)\n\n&gt; There are so many things wrong with this post, it's hard to know where to start, but let's choose WWI. Blaming the British for the outbreak of WWI shows you have basically no clue about pre-war international relations and how the alliance system was formed in the first place. German foreign policy post 1890 was hyper-aggressive and belligerent. Wilhelm II deliberately ended the policies of Otto von Bismarck because he thought they were restraining Germany from it's place in the sun.\n\n&gt; I'm going to quote a bit from an old post, the entirety of which can be found here.\n\n&gt; Germany gave a blank check to Austria in dealing with Serbia and Russia. Germany preemptively declared war on Russia and France. Germany invaded neutral Belgium. Germany had built a navy, at great expense, which served no purpose other than to attempt to intimidate Britain (Perversely, the goal of this intimidation was to force them into an alliance. Thus spake Admiral von Tirpitz).\n\n&gt; The alliance systems that existed during WWI, and indeed the war itself, were a result of increased German aggression after Wilhelm II ascended the throne in 1888. After 1890, Wilhelm II embarked on a policy of \"Weltmahct,\" or world power. A common turn of phrase in Germany was \"Weltmacht oder Niedergang,\" world power or downfall. Wilhelm II and his ministers, in collusion with the Pan-German League, abandoned Bismarck's system of balance, and indeed dropped Bismarck in 1890 as well. Also significant in 1890 was Wilhelm's refusal to renew the Reinsurance Treaty with Russia and the beginning of German naval expansion. The unfortunate (for Germany) result of this belligerence was the Franco-Russian Entente in 1892 (followed up by a formal alliance in 1894) and a naval race with Britain (which culminated in 1904 with the Triple Entente). All of this led Europe down a path that the German government knew would mean war eventually (War was actually desired earlier than 1914 by the German General Staff, men like Helmuth von Moltke).\n\n&gt; Germany, however, continued to be aggressive. The first incident of note in the 20th Century was the 1st Moroccan Crisis. In 1905, the Kaiser went to Tangier, Morocco, which was supposedly under French influence, and gave a speech supporting independence. This was a test of the Entente Cordiale. The result of this confrontation was the Algeciras Conference during which Germany was essentially told to mind its own business. To continue with Germany (but also remember that Germany supported Austria-Hungary during the the Bosnian Annexation Crisis of 1908.) we must also look at the Second Moroccan Crisis. In 1911, Germany sent a gunboat to Agadir (also in Morocco). This enraged France and David Lloyd George, then Chancellor of the Exchequer in Britain, gave his famous Mansion House Speech as an ultimatum in support of France. Germany had almost two decades of clear warning of what would happen in the event of war but the Kaiser gave a blank check to the Austrians in 1914 anyway.\n\nWhat should you take away from this post? Well if you're bent on taking over large swaths of land, make sure the country you invade is full of Redditors. \n",

        "text": "The Wall Street Journal's Review section this weekend was all WWI, all the time. The front page article was by historian Margaret MacMillan, and in it I found some history that wasn't always wrong, but often weighs very heavily on what 'should' have happened if not for the war. \n\nThe article, [“World War I: The War That Changed Everything”](http://online.wsj.com/articles/world-war-i-the-war-that-changed-everything-1403300393), is supposed to be an overview of the consequences of the war, which it mostly is, but in several areas, it comes across as blaming the war for certain results rather than just identifying them as resulting from it. I say 'blaming the war' and I mean it. She's not blaming anyone for starting the war or escalating it, because her position is that no one country is responsible, so she just ends up blaming the war itself, as if it's accountable for everything. Let's begin with the beginning...\n\n&gt; A hundred years ago next week, in the small Balkan city of Sarajevo, Serbian nationalists murdered the heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary and his wife. People were shocked but not particularly worried. Sadly, there had been many political assassinations in previous years—the king of Italy, two Spanish prime ministers, the Russian czar, President William McKinley. None had led to a major crisis. Yet just as a pebble can start a landslide, this killing set off a series of events that, in five weeks, led Europe into a general war. \n\nNot all political assassinations are equally likely to cause war. McKinley was killed by an anarchist named Leon Czolgosz, whose 'foreign' name fueled nativist sentiment, but wasn't going to cause a war. Alexander II was killed by a Russian revolutionary, which wasn't going to cause a war. [Umberto I](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umberto_I_of_Italy) was killed by an Italian-American anarchist, which wasn't going to cause a war. [Dato](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Dato_e_Iradier) was killed by Catalan anarchists, which wasn't going to cause a war **(quick edit: my bad, this occurred in 1921, so this was not in \"previous years\" to 1914, so I think the author was referencing [Cánovas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_C%C3%A1novas_del_Castillo), whose assassin was an Italian anarchist**. [Canalejas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Canalejas) was shot by an anarchist, which wasn't going to cause a war. Archduke Franz Ferdinand was killed by a Bosnian-Serb nationalist during tensions between Austria-Hungary and the Serbs over Serb nationalism. That caused a war. Moving on...\n\n&gt; Before 1914, Russia was a backward autocracy but was changing fast. Its growth rate was as high as any of the Asian tigers in the 1960s and 1970s; it was Europe's major exporter of food grains and, as it industrialized, was importing machinery on a massive scale. Russia also was developing the institutions of civil society, including the rule of law and representative government. Without the war, it might have evolved into a modern democratic state; instead, it got the sudden collapse of the old order and a coup d'état by the Bolsheviks. Soviet communism exacted a dreadful toll on the Russian people and indeed the world—and its remnants are still painfully visible in the corrupt, authoritarian regime of Vladimir Putin. \n\nYes, Russia was starting to have growth and reforms. These reforms, like the Duma and the Constitution of 1906, came as a result of the [revolution of 1905](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Revolution_of_1905). Which was sparked by a war- the [Russo-Japanese War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Japanese_War). Those reforms didn't 'evolve' naturally- they were concessions following a violent uprising. And Russia's industrialization and modernization came from influences and competition from other nations, including wars and peacetime militaristic buildup. And its industrialization wouldn't have been possible without the serfs being emancipated after Alexander II saw the weakness of a Russian serf army being defeated by free armies in the Crimean War. So much for Russia evolving on its own without the help of a war or three. \n\nBut if you want to go speculative, imagine a Russian Revolution without a war going on, since the dissent against an autocratic regime that gave only token reforms was not just going to stop existing without WWI. Czarist troops, aided by loyalists who would have been disillusioned by the war, crack down on the revolt when it happens, brutally killing thousands or millions, and upholding the Czar's power. How is that supposed to progress Russia's evolution into a 'modern democratic state' where Putin would never dare to [corruptly ride a horse shirtless](http://shirtlessputindointhings.tumblr.com/post/39192584671/a-far-away-shot-of-him-and-his-beloved-my-little)?\n\n&gt; The war also destroyed other options for Europe's political development. The old multinational empires had their faults, to be sure, but they enabled the diverse peoples within their boundaries to live in relative harmony. Both Austria-Hungary and the Ottomans were trying to work out ways of encompassing the demands of different groups for greater autonomy. Might they have succeeded if the war had not exhausted them to the point of collapse? We will never know, but since then, the world has suffered the violence and horrors of ethnic nationalism. \n\nThis is where I started to wonder what was going on in this article. Russsia was one thing, but is Macmillan seriously arguing that ethnicities being ruled by an empire should just sit back and wait for the empire to find a better way to rule them? That's borderline \"slavery was dying out anyway, the abolitionists should have just waited.\" There has been a great deal of ethnic violence resulting from the collapse of these two empires, but ethnic violence has not been non-stop for the last century in these places either. And if everyone was living in 'relative harmony' before the Great War, then why were Serbian nationalists assassinating an archduke? Why had there already been several wars in the Balkans? Why were Arabs joining up with the first guy named Lawrence of Arabia they ran into? \n\nIs she saying that violent revolution is somehow invalid? It exists. It happens. It's violent and horrific. But the mere concept that oppressive empires undergo violent strife after they collapse is not regrettable because the empires were trying to 'work it out'. Of course they were trying to solve the problem. They didn't want their empire to collapse. What credit does that earn them?\n\n&gt; The European empires had called on their colonial possessions to support the war effort, but in so doing they had hastened the coming of their own end. Empires had always rested on a giant confidence trick—where the ruled agreed, or at least didn't actively dispute, that their colonial rulers were more civilized and advanced and thus entitled to rule. \n&gt; The soldiers from Africa, Canada, India, Australia or New Zealand had now seen for themselves what their European masters were capable of.\n\nThis part is pretty interesting and a significant consequence of WWI, but I'd question the placement of Canada, Australia, and especially New Zealand, which took its time in accepting independence 16 years after the Statute of Westminster, so it's hard to link it directly to WWI. The essay does go on to mention Gandhi's experiences in South Africa and Chinese communism originating in 1920, and another good example of this impact left unmentioned was Ho Chi Minh, who was disillusioned by the lack of attention to colonial independence from Wilson and the Treaty of Versailles while in Paris. \n\nThose were the major problems I had, and it's worth a read otherwise. As I said, it's like MacMillan wants to blame someone for things that went wrong as a result of the war, but can't (another article in the WSJ about the historiography of WWI identifies MacMillan as aligned with Christopher Clark in not viewing Germany as the instigator to the war), and ends up blaming the war itself. It struck me as really weird. If anyone's read MacMillan's work and understands it better, feel free to contribute. ",

        "text": "Last night, I was watching the craptastic alt-history film \"Fatherland,\" a film that takes place in an alternate history where the Nazis won WWII and established a Third Reich across all of Europe. There's a lot of problems with the film, but this isn't /r/badmovies, but /r/badhistory. What I want to focus on - dare I say, obsess over - is [this](http://i.imgur.com/yZPMP1K.png) image from the film.\n\nTo understand why this image is bad history, we have to know something about pop music history and the culture that gave rise to the Beatles. We also have to know a bit about the Reichsmusikkammer which controlled music and what could and could not be performed.\n\nWe'll start with the Beatles. As I'm sure everyone knows, the Beatles rose in Liverpool, one of many bands to get their start there. They moved briefly to Hamburg in 1960 before returning to Liverpool in 1962, hitting it big, and becoming world-wide phenomena. In 1957, though, John Lennon started the Beatles as a skiffle band. [Skiffle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skiffle) was a genre based in jazz and blues, both imported from the US. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GynnhBUOHkg) is a bit of what skiffle sounds like, and as you can hear, it's pretty clear that its origins lie somewhere in the southern US. By 1960, the Beatles had changed their name to the Beatles in tribute to Buddy Holly and the Crickets, another band which influenced their sound. As you can hear [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvJXCNwzBq4), it's yet another genre influenced heavily by the southern US sound and by traditionally black genres such as jazz and blues. Finally, we have to consider [Merseybeat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseybeat), the sound that originated in Liverpool, and which the Beatles would become the most famous example of. It was an important genre for about a decade, and has continued to be hugely influential on British pop music today. While the Beatles' sound would evolve over time, by 1964 (the year in which this film takes place), they sounded like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vZLVJwXP-U). While we could argue about the Liverpudlian influences of the sound and the lyrics, my point here is that it's a sound that's clearly the direct descendent of that American sound from earlier rock and roll and from skiffle. Without these influences, the Beatles would not have the sound they did. \n\nBut let's take this a step further. Part of the reason the Beatles were able to be a band at all was a combination of factors in both the cultural and economic scene of Liverpool. Liverpool, because of its location as a port and a centre for Irish immigration, became hugely important as a centre of music and culture. It still is, to a large extent. One consequence of its status as a port, though, is that it became a massive importer of American goods, including guitars and media. These became massively influential, and - when coupled with deindustrialisation and the baby boom - produced a wealth of bands, all influenced by American sounds, and especially by the American south and the sounds of jazz and blues. Without these trade links to the US, without deindustrialisation, and without the baby boom, it's unlikely the Liverpudlian music scene could have happened in such a way as to create a band like the Beatles. Certainly it wouldn't have created Merseybeat or allowed skiffle to flourish. The film emphasises that trade links with the US were cut off. If that's the case, then the Beatles could not have existed as a band, let alone had the same sound that would have gone into the album \"With The Beatles\" (the album on the poster). \n\nLet's for a moment, though, assume that there were still guitars and that through some miracle, Liverpool was able to become the centre of music that it is today and was in the 1960s. It's here that we have to discuss the Reichsmusikkammer, a branch of Joseph Goebbels propaganda machine that controlled which music was played, who composed it, and what could be considered \"good\" music at all. What's perhaps most important for this post is [degenerate music](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerate_music) (*entartete Musik*), and what would fall under that. There was a very clear image of what was good and bad music, partly as a reaction to the music of the Weimar Republic (and to modernist composers like Arnold Schoenberg, especially), and partly as a reinforcement of Nazis' racist ideologies. As Michael Kater explains in \"Composers of the Nazi Era: Eight Portraits\" (which I recommend if you're interested in what impact the Reichsmusikkammer had on individual careers), Goebbels and Hitler were very much looking for music that emphasised the grand, glorious nature of Germany, music which was bombastic and large, but most especially which conformed to the standards of the Classical and Romantic periods rather than the modernist styles. The Reichsmusikkammer was a huge fan of Wagner, for example, because he espoused German values and sang about how great it was to be German. There's also [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Meistersinger_von_N%C3%BCrnberg](Die Meistersinger von Nuernberg) which is blatantly anti-Semitic, so you know Hitler loved it. [This piece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD3VsesSBsw) represents Carl Orff's successful attempts to get into the good graces of the Reichsmusikkammer (once again, according to Kater). You get the idea. \n\nSo what, you might ask, does this have to do with the historical inaccuracy of saying \"Die Beatles?\" Let's remember their roots again for a moment. The roots of the Beatles lie in skiffle, in jazz, and in blues. If there was any type of music the Reichsmusikkammer didn't like, [it was jazz, blues, and \"black\" music.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerate_music#mediaviewer/File:Entartete_musik_poster.jpg). This goes back to the racial ideals of the Nazis - because jazz and blues have their roots in African-American culture, they were seen as degenerate, much like modernist music. It would be impossible, then, for the Beatles to have started a skiffle band and changed the face of pop music. John Lennon and Paul McCartney would not have gotten together over their love of the guitar, and the Beatles would not have been, not without the influence of jazz, blues, and the sounds of black America. The Reichsmusikkammer's rules about degenerate music would have made this impossible.\n\nBut /u/Quouar! I hear you say (my ears are very good, you see). This is alt-history! Surely it doesn't belong on /r/badhistory, which is about actual history! Well, hypothetical person, I respectfully disagree. One of the appeals of alt-history is the fact that it is meant to accurately represent our own world, albeit it a different version of that world. It's meant to take the truths from what happened, tinker with them, and see what happens. It is, in its own right, a form of imaginary history, one which still has to obey the rules of reality. This image is bad history not because it's trying to represent history as such, but because at its roots, it has a fundamentally flawed understanding of historical institutions and what influence they had on music. It's taking a brutally simplistic view of music history, and assuming that a language change would be the only difference. It's bad history in that it's not respecting or accurately representing history while claiming that it does. \n\nAlso, the movie just sucks.",

As an Indian, I find no difference in both. 1.5 million to 4 million died because of scorched earth tactics in the rice growing areas of Bangladesh and food stocks being redirected to supply the British soldiers at the cost of the average brown man.\n\n&gt;A genocide is a genocide is a genocide. To say that the Nazi's used gas chambers and hence it is more evil is being disingenuous at best. Gas chambers, bullets, machetes, starving to death they are all evil and are acts of genocide. Please do not do a disservice to the memories of the millions of other (non Nazi victims) who have died from starvation, bullets, exhaustion, swords, machetes and various other means. \n\n&gt;What about the fact that the allies knew about the concentration camps yet didn't bomb the railroads leading into these camps.\n\n&gt;No matter which way you spin it, no British presence would have meant no deaths or very few. \n\nFinally, accusations that sympathizing with the holocaust is nothing short of racism, since \"white people\" died:\n\n&gt;Of course, neither the Indians (Bengalis in this case) or the natives of the New World were white. Sorry to be so direct, but is it that only white lives are important to you? \n\nThis appears to be a topic of controversy even on wikipedia in the article on the [1943 Bengal Famine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_famine_of_1943)\n\nMost of the conversations appears to be in [this](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/28rrpv/a_largely_indian_victory_in_world_war_ii_mostly/cidx76o) thread, which starts after accusations that Gandhi was a sellout to the British and betrayed India.\n\n/r/AskHistorians had a thread a while ago on the topic of the Bengal famine: \n\nhttp://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1c49ev/one_of_the_largest_mass_killing_of_humans_in/\n\n&gt;I'm not an expert on India and have only studied the famine in a broader wartime context, but there are exculpatory circumstances for the British. The Bengal famine occured during some of the darkest hours of World War II for Britain, with the Japanese on India's doorstep and German submarines harassing Allied merchant marine. Under those circumstances, the British Empire's resources weren't as formidable as they otherwise would have been. The Chinese famines under Mao, while brought about by stupendous ineptitude, were during peacetime.\n\n&gt;Another factor is intent. Few official attempts were made in China to seriously combat famine during the Three Bitter Years even though low-level officials knew its extent and high-ranking officials certainly must've had some understanding of it. Even so, the Chinese government refused foreign aid, even from other communist countries, and Mao himself expressed disinterest if some of China's many, many people died so long as the revolution continued onward. British and Indian officials, by comparison, misunderstood and underestimated the Bengal famine and therefore mismanaged their response to it -- but they still responded. Their misunderstandings and underestimations are more readily attributed to poor communication, incomplete information, and the general disruptions of war, and not to malice or malign indifference.\n\n&gt;If I could illustrate this difference metaphorically, think of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina as these famine-stricken areas. With Bengal, British and Indian officials didn't know how many people needed to be evacuated, where they were, or how to get to them -- but they tried to help nonetheless. With China during the Great Leap Forward, Mao and other officials dismantled the levees to build something else, then pretended like nothing was wrong when the city flooded. With Ukraine during the Holodomor, Joseph Stalin dynamited the levees, summoned the hurricane, and shot those who tried to escape.\n\n\n",

You know, that which should be appended to every Cracked article.\n\nBut what made me twitch at the uniform love coming from my friends' feed was when the author discussed Pasiphaë:\n\n&gt;Now, here’s where it gets weird. Her husband’s mother, Europa (after whom Europe itself is named), had almost the exact same story. In her story, Zeus took the form of a beautiful bull, approached her, carried her out to an island in the ocean, and mated with her. She then had three kids, one of whom was king Minos - Pasiphaë’s husband...So what’s the deal? As best as historians are able to determine, they were the same legend. Europa was the Minoan version, and Pasiphaë the Greek one. When the Greeks rolled through and conquered Minoa, . Instead of her being a powerful and in-charge woman, she was a depraved and lustful pawn. Their way of breaking Minoan traditions and bending it to their own ends. Dick move, guys.\n\n\"Minoa\" is not a place. Okay, Minoa [is](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minoa,_New_York) a place (or several), but generally, if we're talking about what they're talking about, it's Minoan Crete.\n\n\"Rolled down and conquered\" gives me some trouble, too. About 1400BCE or so there was a switchover from what we can call Minoan civilization to what we call Mycenaean civilization, but we don't have great documentation on what the nature of that switchover was, and the long shadow of the awesome [Sir Arthur Evans](http://www.civilization.org.uk/minoans/sir-arthur-evans), who's view of Minos was that it was a combination of Paris and Alderaan and so naturally this needed to be a brutal conquest by dirty Mycenae. Since then, you've seen all sorts of theories, from [The Volcano](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minoan_eruption) (her lava be everflowing) to [nothing at all](http://archaeology.about.com/b/2008/07/17/the-end-of-the-minoans-a-cretan-insurrection.htm).\n\n\"they essentially rewrote things\" - Technically, granting the invasion, they didn't, because they probably got [Linear B](http://www.ancientscripts.com/linearb.html) their writing, from the [Minoan script](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_A). But I guess that wins the Technically Correct award.\n\nHowever, that's also when things get particularly shaky, and the principal bad history here. This theory gets squarely into [Great Goddess](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marija_Gimbutas) theory here, this trope that pops up on a reoccurring basis. Society, the theory argues, was matriarchal, or at least a lot more egalitarian than it would become, with worship focused on goddesses and goddess figures. It's not until the men-cultures took over, (presumably having unlocked \"violence\" in the tech tree), that this changed...but they still left all the evidence of the Old Ways in terms of repurposed myth and religion.\n\nIt's a pretty story, but no one [believes it](http://www.nytimes.com/books/00/09/17/reviews/000917.17angiert.html), at least in a serious historical way. Best you're left with is a bunch of maybes about it. And as noted, Minoan culture, frequently because of its [striking female iconography](https://www.google.com/search?q=snake+goddess&amp;rlz=1C1GIGM_enUS567&amp;espv=2&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jb2lU_7nAs-IqgbO6YKQAg&amp;ved=0CCsQsAQ&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=1056#q=snake%20goddess%20knossos&amp;revid=1170208936&amp;tbm=isch&amp;imgdii=_) gets [a lot of it. NSFW](http://www.fjkluth.com/minoan.html).* If anything, its the Greeks misunderstanding either Cretan or [another culture's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenicia) religion and myth, in the terms of some sort of legend between the sky and the moon.\n\nBut a systematic campaign of erasure and contortion? No.\n\nSimilarly, when discussing Hatshepsut:\n\n&gt;You’d be forgiven for not knowing about her, though. Thanks to a sustained campaign by her successors to erase all traces of her reign, it was not until fairly recently that she came back to historical prominence. She was re-discovered due to the fact that her time in power saw such an incredible proliferation of architecture, statues, and art that it proved impossible to scrub mention of her from *everything*. \n\nIf by \"recently,\" you mean 0CE, then sure. Josephus, through other [refrences](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manetho) knows about her.\n\nBut here's what I particularly don't like about this, and to some extent your can extrapolate this to the whole \"rejected princesses\" project. There was a period of physically trying to obliterate her memory, but it was successor (probably) not \"successors,\" only near the end of [his reign](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thutmose_III), and we don't really know why. I feel there's an unspoken \"because she was a woman, the only response was to unperson her,\" in the text. Likewise, the failure to clear out everything is read as necessarily accidental, where it might have been incidental or intentional. And as anyone who's played Crusader Kings 2 knows, succession is a pretty fragile and complex thing, and it might be more to do with presenting lines of power in one way rather than another. Or maybe it was something that the historical record doesn't touch on. We just don't know.\n\nAnd as much as I am sick to death of actual women-erasing bad history, which, you'll note, is more often in the in modern world than in the historical one, it's no good to swap new bad history in its place.\n\nAlso on Hatshepsut:\n\n&gt;In fact, speaking of Jesus — you know the myrrh that the wise men brought to his birth? Almost certainly due to Hatshepsut importing it 1500 years earlier, in the first recorded attempt to transplant foreign trees.\n\nShe did, in fact, import Myrrh trees, or at least the first record of transplanting trees is during her reign, so it's worth giving the benefit of the doubt. But the connection to Jesus? In Matthew 2:1–12 it only refers to the wise men as \"from the East,\" which has generally been given a Persian sheen. Later Christian reinterpretations of the Magi would situate the Magus, and the Myrrh, from around Yemen, where Hastshepsut imported the trees from, making the myrrh in the Bible disconnected. Likewise, a trade good, when a trade good, can get all over, and the transplant of the trees isn't relevant, except perhaps in that the Jewish authors would definitely have known knew about myrrh in the sense of having myrrh tree orchards in Israel, which may have been connected somehow to hers.\n\nLast:\n\n&gt;To quiet the gossip at court, she began her rule wearing men’s clothing, including the pharaoh’s false beard. Once they stopped flapping their gums, she went back to wearing whatever the hell she wanted.\n\nOr maybe not. We've been through this, sort of, with the question of whether the Europa/Pasiphe myth is a reflection of another person's mythology. As an analog, there's a portion in Herodotus where he discusses how Peisistratos, one of the early Athenian tyrants, assured his power by dressing up a woman as Athena and marching into the city, which is supposed to show how foolish those wacky believers are. And sure it's possible, but it seems to have the hallmark of myth and tradition.\n\nEgyptians understood symbolism, and the pharonic false beard was part of the package. Egyptian art was highly stylized to begin with - figures always in profile, with [variations in size](http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alientravelguide.com%2Fart%2Fpainting%2Feras%2Fegypt%2F503027.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alientravelguide.com%2Fart%2Fpainting%2Feras%2Fegypt%2Freflect.htm&amp;h=256&amp;w=384&amp;tbnid=bRWra9CoZUlynM%3A&amp;zoom=1&amp;docid=v_vF1Ze8plVKxM&amp;ei=-s2lU9r4D4SL8AHM-YH4DQ&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=0CDoQMygJMAk&amp;iact=rc&amp;uact=3&amp;dur=289&amp;page=1&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=40) to denote relative importance, and lots of standardized forms to things. That artwork tended to match to the standardized form - the image of pharaoh as pharaoh rather than person, isn't good, bad, or indifferent, it's just that culture's particular stylistic form. You can discuss the sort of semiotics thereto, but it gets iffy to read it as fact that meant something. \n\nBrief looking at the others suggests there's a lot more to get dragged up that are historical - I'm really hoping that someone can find something obscurely wrong with the T-34 - but A for premise, C for information.\n\n -* Okay, if you ignore the rest of this post, you should go to that link, if you don't know about it already. I'd forgotten about it until I started writing this, and it's just...is there a term for when something becomes too weird to still be bad history?",
