        "text": "Like most kids when I turned 18 I quit going to the dentist. I'm 21 now and recently (about a year ago) started going back because I knew I had some issues. I knew I had at least one cavity which was made way worse by grinding at night when I didn't even know I did. I'm on state insurance so I went to one of the few dentists who take it near me. I've been going back and forth to that dentist for a freaking year. They told me I had 3 cavities. 4th one was on one of my wisdom teeth which I had removed as well. They filled the 3. 2 went fin but the 3rd one was in a weird spot so grinding st night had made it huge. And every time they filled it would would come out again even with my night guard. And every time I went back I kept telling them \"hey I have more than those 3 cavities I know I do I can feel it\" and every time they would tell me \"no you don't you're just paranoid cause you haven't been to the dentist in so long\" so finally I went to a different dentist cause I KNEW something was wrong and I had more than just the three. I went in there they looked me over and cleaned my teeth. Y'all I had FIFTEEN FREAKING CAVITIES that they just refused to fill for some reason. The cavities are small and are really only there because I grind so bad and didn't know it. So the grooves it made in my teeth were perfect to create cavities. But they were still bad enough the dentist said I need all of them filled. Why in the world would they lie to my face about 15 cavities???? I can't even wrap my head around it. Wtf",

My wife and I both work from home, so we pretty much depend on our connection.\n\nMonday March 6th, 12 pm: internet goes out, light goes red. I call them, they tell me it should be fixed within 48 hrs. I don’t love it but that’s ok. I Can figure it out for a couple of days.\n\nWednesday March 8th: I call them a couple of times and they tell me they should be here today. By 3:30 pm they arrive, nonchalant technician tells me that my issue needs to be fixed by someone else. Says they’ll try to be here that same day, if not it won’t get past Thursday. I’m staring to get angry but what can you do?\n\nThursday March 9th: I can’t them at 9 am to see at what time they will be here, a representative says they have it scheduled for 12 pm at the latest.\n\n12:30 - obviously no one shows and no one calls. I call them, that apologize and say they’ll be here at 4.\n\n4:15 - same old, no showing, no call. I call yet again and they apologize again and assure me they’ll come before 6.\n\n5:50 - silence again, I call for the fourth time. A rep apologizes, says they come Friday. By this time I’m furious, I go full Karen and ask for a manager. Manager gives me yet another apology. I ask if they are lying or just incompetent. He gives me a personal guarantee that they will come on Friday. I log off from the situation and watch some forgotten dvds (been using streaming only for a while).\n\nFriday March 10th (today): I call at 9 am to see at what time are they planning to arrive. They put me on hold. They tell me that my ETA for fixing is 24 hours. I snap, I call their biggest competitor. They say they will come set me up today.\n\nWho arrives first? We’ll see.",

        "text": "I get no home mail service where I am in a rural area, so I have to go to the PO box for all my mail.  If an item doesn't fit in the box, they keep it behind the counter.  My post office closes at 4:00pm, (Mon-Fri) additionally they only keep items behind the counter for 5 days - so if I can't make it on my lunch break for 4 days in a row, I have to arrange to book off work early if I need to get something that is behind the counter, or it get sent back.\n\nToday I had an item I knew was ready to get sent back, so I went to the post office 10 minutes before close, but right before they closed, I got a work call - which was necessary for me to answer since I was technically still working remotely for another hour.  Normally I would NEVER do something so rude to the post office people and the customers there.  I'm actually quite shy about talking on the phone in front of other people, and I think it's a bit rude, particularly in a normally quiet place - but this was an extenuating circumstance, so I answered the work call and tried to simultaneously pick up my package (which only consists of picking up the slip from the box and handing to the person behind the counter).  I did my best to engage with the work call in the quickest, least rude way possible.  I didn't make chit chat - just quick, short answers to my co-worker's questions.\n\nWhen I tried to do this, the post office lady told me (rudely) that I can't be on the phone.  So I excused myself and tried to quickly take the call outside.  I did get back just in the knick of time to hand the inconvenienced lady my slip.  She brought my package back, and said, \"This is marked for return. In the future you need to keep in mind that we send these back after 5 days.\"\n\nYeah.  Got it.",

        "text": "So today I went to a thrift store in search of a couple chairs for my breakfast nook. I found the perfect fit for my space—brand new chairs, and lucky for me, 50% off of all green tags (the tags were green, woo!) I grabbed two chairs of the three available, and headed up to the register. When the cashier went to ring up my purchases, he could only find a tag on one of the chairs. He was very concerned about this, and told me that sometimes chairs are sold in pairs and wanted to be sure about it before he rang me up for two. I told him that I was pretty sure that they were being sold individually, because there were three available for sale and they all had separate tags on them. (My guess is the tag for the second chair fell off somewhere when I made my way up to the register.) Anyways, the man wasn’t comfortable with just ringing me up for two and insisted that he check with his supervisor first. So we waited. And waited. My three year old was losing his patience, flopping his body this way and that in the cart, asking when we were going to get out of there. The line behind me was piling up, and people were staring at me impatiently, like I was the one causing the hassle. We continued to wait. The man at the register called for backup cashiers, but the line had gotten LONG after waiting for such a while.\n\nThe supervisor finally arrived, clearly already irritated. The cashier asked her if the chairs were sold as a set or separately. Then she looked at me as if I was the one asking, and scoffed, “They are sold SEPARATELY. We can’t give you two chairs for the price of one. Do you still want them?” And then I said, politely, “Yes, I do, thank you.” Then she stared at me blankly for a second, and said, “I also can’t give you the 50% off the chair without the tags. You’ll have to pay full price for that one.” I was starting to get a bit flustered at this point—my kid was having a meltdown, the line behind me was getting longer, people were staring, and the lady was just being mean. So I replied, still a bit confused, “So you’re not able to just scan the other tag twice? If it’s really a problem, there’s a third chair I can grab that does still have the tags on and I can switch it out for that one.” I pointed towards the chair, which was just an aisle away from where we were and would have taken less than 30 seconds to grab and be back to the register. The woman paused for a moment, then looked me dead in the eye, and said, “No, you can’t do that. You can either pay full price for this one right now, or you can go get the other one and take it to the end of the line.” At this point, I was so overwhelmed that I wanted to cry. We had already waited such a long time. So I pathetically pleaded, “Really?” And she said, “Yes. So are you going to pay full price or go get the other one and get back in line?” At that point, I was so anxious and overwhelmed that my mind was jelly, but my subconscious wasn’t going to be bullied into paying full price for an item that was on sale, or be pushed into waiting in a line that I had already waited in. \n\nI didn’t answer her. I took my cart, walked over to the chair that still had the tags on, and took it back to the cashier. The woman stared me down as I approached again, but she didn’t say anything further. The cashier had begun helping someone else just before I returned (who frustratingly had a full basket of items and needed to look at a bunch of things in the jewelry case, which made my time in that store even longer).\n\nAfter an unnecessary amount of time, my son and I finally made it out of there. I was so overwhelmed that I cried when I got into the car. I tend to be emotionally triggered when I feel like I’m being treated unfairly. That and I was in the prodromal stages of a migraine attack, which later became full-blown. From my standpoint, I really feel like I was treated unfairly, and I feel like other people would be in agreement. But maybe my judgement is clouded? Was I acting Karen-y?",

I kept telling her that it’s me, I just look really different in the picture, but she just kept going and there wasn’t anything I could tell her to get her to believe me. I even told her that she could call the cops and get them to come verify that it’s my real ID. She took the drink off the counter and acted like she just caught a 14 yr old trying to buy beer with a fake ID. I ended up just saying “alright” and walking out. She was so rude about it and even laughed about it to the customer that she rang up after me. I wish she would’ve just taken my ID or cut it in half so that I would’ve had a reason to call the cops on her",

        "text": "Listen. I've been there. I've been a cashier, delivery girl, and food runner at my old fast food job. I know what it's like to not get a tip. BUT, I never, *ever,* asked straight to the customer's face, \"You don't want to tip me?\" That is just so uncouth.\n\nAnd what did you do tonight for me and my friend's AYCE sushi night? You brought us our food. The food that we ordered from a TABLET. You barely interacted with us. Hell, the HOST interacted more with us; he at least asked us if the tiny table was fine and helped us out when we thought that our tablet was broken. If I was tipping him, then I would absolutely give. All you did was try to rush us out when we were discussing how to split the bill (listed on the tablet) and asking if we were done. \"Oh no, not yet, I just want one thing of ice cream, and then we'll pay!\" I said.\n\nI get it, at buffets, you don't want customers to loiter and eat all the food. But how are you gonna bring me the bill BEFORE I even get my ice cream? We hadn't even eaten that much; We went through maybe two rounds of food and one cocktail we shared before we felt stuffed. I just wanted one more tiny thing and then we'd be good.\n\nI put it all on my card and my friend paid back her share in cash to me (she's the one who got the cocktail too). I get the card back, fill out the receipt, and just converse with my friend, waiting for the food to digest. They take back the check, we converse some more. My friend's still trying to polish off her cocktail, but she says she can't, so I chug it for her. I got yo back, bestie.\n\nTHEN, the dreaded moment:\n\n\"Excuse me, you didn't leave a tip on the check. You don't want to tip? And also, you forgot to sign the bottom.\"\n\nI WAS SO FLUSTERED YOU GUYS. To be fair, that last part is my fault, but, my friend and I were literally just talking about how we're introverts and this restaurant was great because we don't have to talk too much to the servers. Not to say we're crippled in that sense, but you know, sometimes you just don't feel like socializing with strangers. BUT NOW-\n\nSo I stutter and fumble for a bit before taking out my wallet and fumbling more with the cash my friend just gave me. By the way, the server (*food runner,* not a true \"waitress\" in the sense that she took our orders) is STARING AT ME THE WHOLE TIME. Waiting for what she probably expects to be 20%. In any other situation I probably would have. But 1. I'm struggling right now to get consistent income, I work per diem and only get paid twice a month. Adding to that, I was already freaking out earlier because I lost my debit card somewhere, so I had to pay with a credit card.\n\n2. Our bill came to over $80. It's $30 per person (a change from before inflation, it used to be $25) for AYCE, and my friend's drink came to around $14. Adding tax it came to that. I get it, everyone that night was working hard, it's Saturday night, it's busy as hell. But if I'm gonna tip someone I'd rather do it for a person who A. was super nice and accomodating, and B. actually interacted with me beyond getting me the food. When I was a cashier I never expected tips. When I was a FOOD RUNNER I never expected tips. I would graciously accept when I did, but never did I openly ASK for it.\n\n3. Girl, YOU WERE SUPER RUDE. I'M SORRY BUT YOU WERE. Your tone might have been neutral but you definitely implied I was being scummy for not leaving anything. I did feel a bit bad, up until the part where YOU CALLED ME OUT. Now I'm scared of looking like a dick in front of my friend.\n\nSo I slowly sign the receipt (she's still staring btw) and I reluctantly take out $7. I gave her a *tiny* bit of empathy; maybe she has a quota to meet or whatever, but I sure as hell wasn't giving her 20%. She said thanks and took back the check. My friends straight up told me I should have just given the $5 bill and honestly, I should have. We should have just bounced after they took back the check the first time, though I guess we couldn't have because I had to sign anyway. And I don't know if it was the alcohol I just chugged or the lingering sense of embarassment or both, but I was still fucked up when we got back in my car. Friend and I just watched a video for a bit until we got our bearings.\n\nAm I being overdramatic about this? Yes. But was I justified for initially not intending to tip at all? Let me know.",

Because that’s how I wear it. And it was maybe getting close to chin length. I asked her to cut it to my ears. All the way around, one length. \n\nSo she starts parting my hair in the middle. And I say “no, I’d like it cut on my side part, where I had it,”.\n\nShe replied, “but if you part it in the middle it’ll be long on that side.”  I reply, “I don’t part it in the middle.”\n\nSo she cuts my hair. Only she cuts it around at a slant. So my right side is like an inch longer than my left side. She asks how it looks. I tell her the left side is too long. Again, she says, “if you part your hair in the middle it’ll be longer on that side.”  I tell her again that I don’t part my hair in the middle. I tell her, “I wear it on the side part, just how I have it, every day. I want it cut so it’s one even length all around.”\n\nShe got really huffy but she did what I asked. But how hard is it to understand that I’m not in 1960 and I don’t part my hair in the middle? I think cutting your hair where you part it every day is a pretty normal thing to ask for.",

        "text": "I want to first preface this post with the fact that I do think tables of 10 ppl or more should not be able to split bills. Here’s the story!\n\nI grew up on the east coast where splitting bills is almost like telling someone they’re the scum of the earth compared to the west coast where they will split a bill 90 ways to hell happily. \n\nMy girlfriend and my brother and his partner were all out for brunch on the east coast while I was visiting family. There’s a restaurant my brother loves, I think it’s fine. \n\nBrunch goes great, food is ok and then we get to paying the bill. We asked to split the bill - two dishes on one receipt and two dishes on another. That was all.\n\nThe waitress looked like we slapped her in the face. She went on this tirade about how they can’t do two bills for one table. We were all very confused? We didn’t order drinks, we didn’t order apps. It would have just been two dishes on two receipts. She also then offered to split the bill down the middle? Which confused us. \n\nHell, I worked at a smoothie counter in 2009 and I could split bills on my POS. Why can’t most restaurants in larger cities do this? \n\nTwo questions:\n\nHas anyone had a similar experience in west coast vs. east coast splitting bills? \n\nAnd\n\nWhy are servers so against splitting bills in 2023? Again, not for large parties. That makes sense!",

        "text": "This may be a little long!\n\nI decided to treat my sister to a massage at the spa of a five star resort for her birthday (which sadly happened two months ago, but such is life). I knew it would be pricey - it ended up being just under $500 for two 80 minute massages - but I know the service is fantastic and it was what she wanted and deserved!\n\nThe massages were indeed amazing and the facilities were everything you’d expect them to be for that sort of thing. We were really enjoying ourselves and went to lounge by the heated pool. We decided to order some food, which you can do by calling room service. The room service menu is pretty limited, but nice. \n\nHere I have to explain that my sister and I are both gluten free (medical, not personal choice) and she has additional allergies. We are both also lifelong vegetarians, although this is no longer really an issue in our country or in places like the States or the UK. \n\nWe are extremely aware that this makes us very annoying diners and we both avoid eating out because it’s often a bit of a headache. When we do, we both try very hard to limit questions or requests, and to be satisfied with whatever a place can do to accommodate us, even if it means just having a plain old side salad as a main. We have both worked extensively in customer service (I have waitressed specifically) and know how it goes, so we try as hard as we can to be nice and as not demanding as possible. \n\nUpon looking at the menu, I saw they had a GF Mac and Cheese (this is extremely rare and super exciting so I nearly didn’t believe it!) and a sandwich on GF bread that looked tasty. My sister wasn’t quite as easy, but saw a salad she could have. She also wanted to inquire about corn vs. flour tacos and if she could have a certain side. \n\nMy sister made the call and prefaced it by apologising that we would have some questions. She first asked if the Mac and cheese was actually GF and the girl on the phone said yes so I was thrilled! That and my sandwich ordered, that’s me sorted. She then asked if the side she wanted was GF, as it wasn’t noted on the menu, but usually would be (it’s VERY common at least where we live for things to not be noted as such when they are). The girl asked her to hold, but she didn’t actually but the call on hold, instead just put the receiver down. My sister heard some shuffling and background talk, and then the following occurred:\n\nGirl (muffled but clear, in our local accent): well this lady is asking for so much bullsh*t! (Then after picking up the phone in a customer service, non regional accent) Hello!!\n\nSister: (still cheerful, but quite surprised) Wait, am I the lady? \n\nGirl (pretending not to hear her): hello? Hello?\n\nSister (less cheerful): seriously, am I the lady asking for so much bullshit?\n\nGirl: click.\n\nMy sister was very upset and hurt and wanted to just not order food or anything else, but I decided we should call the front desk and discuss it. My reasoning for doing this is that a) we deserve to be able to ask a couple questions without rudeness and b) this resort is a famous rep of our country and the type of tourists they cater to would not tolerate this - this sort of attitude is getting more common in customer service here and it sucks. I work in tourism and our reputation is important to me. \n\nI called the front desk and asked to speak with a manager, the lady who answered said she was one. I explained the situation and she was horrified and said she would investigate. She then asked if we had made our order, and I said no because we were hung up on. She asked if we’d still like to and I said that I was rather hungry but was concerned about any kind of pushback from the girl in question. She asked who I had spoken to and I told her I didn’t have a name, but it was a (probably) young woman of our nationality. I also explained it may be difficult to take our order as we still had a couple questions and didn’t want to trouble her, and she said she wouldn’t know the answers but was more than happy to find out. I explained our order and asked one question, and she said she’d call back. \n\nFive minutes later the phone rang and the lovely front desk lady informed me that the GF Mac and cheese didn’t exist and my sisters question was a negative. She offered a alternate to the Mac, which I declined (still had the sandwich!) and took my sisters new order. This phase was not without its issues, as she didn’t know the menu - but I expected this and kept asking her to please stop apologising as she was going above and beyond. She said she’d call again and please stay by the phone.\n\nShe called back soon after and said she had investigated the situation. As follows:\n\nManager: I have spoken to the girl in question and she says that she wasn’t speaking to your sister but venting her frustration over the chefs not being able to accommodate her questions. However, this is not an excuse for profanity, and it is a resort policy that staff not use profanity on property for any reason, and for that I apologise. This is an awful situation for you and I’m sorry she used profanity with your sister. \n\nMe: I appreciate your apology and your efforts to resolve the issue! However I wish to make clear that my complaint is not her use of profanity, I myself swear like a sailor and that alone wouldn’t bother me at all. My concern is that what you have said isn’t what happened. I completely understand that may be what she said, or what you need to tell me, but I want to make clear my concern was feeling and not the phrasing, as it upset my sister a lot. \n\nManager: I completely understand and I apologise again, I really don’t want you to feel unappreciated.\n\nMe: you have done all you can and I know how these things go, thanks again for your efforts and apology! \n\nShe then asked to speak to my sister, and apologised to her. My sister explained how hard it is for us to order food sometimes and how badly we feel, but it was really upsetting to be spoken about like that. She then thanked the manager, who told her the food would be there soon and let us know if any further feedback. \n\nThe food arrived about 30 minutes later, mine was delicious. My sisters was very good, but not overly filling for a nursing mum. No one’s fault at all! We were given a 15% discount on the food before service charges and grats. The man who brought the food told us the discount was ‘for not being able to hear us on the phone and disconnecting the call.’ I have been given a greater discount for less fraught issues, but I was pleased to be accommodated and ultimately would not have cared discount or not since the manager made it clear she was concerned. \n\nMy boyfriend seemed to think I had made a big fuss over the whole thing. That being said, he always thinks I make a fuss even if I simply ask if something can be GF if it’s not noted. My sister is still upset and feels like we deserved to say something, but it wasn’t worth it. I feel confident in what I said, but I wish I had explained to the manager that I too work in customer service and I too complain to colleagues about my guests ALL the time - I just make sure they don’t know about it. I have no issue with the girl in question complaining about us (I’m sure it happens all the time, no matter how polite we are), but us hearing it isn’t great. \n\nAlso, I wonder if my elaborating that I didn’t care about profanity but did care about the real issue came across how I intended it (I’d never complain just about someone swearing, and especially not directly to me) or if it came across as me just being nit picky, which I didn’t wish to be. \n\nThoughts? Karen or nah? \n\n*note - I only refer to her as the ‘girl’ because the manager did. I originally called her a woman, but I never saw this woman, and for all I know she really is a girl. It’s very common for us to refer to someone even my age (29) as a ‘girl’ so it’s not a big thing, but I know it is in some cultures. Also, I only made note of her using our local accent because it is clear she wasnt speaking to my sister. My sister sounds somewhat American, I sound more ‘local’, and the girl used a very customer service version of our accent with my sister, as did the manager with me until she realised I was local, when she then switched to a stronger accent. This is normal for us in any interaction, but it strongly shows to me that the girl definitely didn’t know my sister was listening and also let’s me suspect we would have been treated differently (better or worse, not sure) if we were tourists or not local.\n\nExtra note - I accidentally posted this to r/talesfromthefrontdesk, not even sure how! So sorry if anyone has seen this twice!",

        "text": "So I take a Adderall for ADD, super common medication and have been taking it for awhile now. Well For anyone not aware, there is currently a pretty serious shortage of the medication that's been going on for months and only seems to be getting worse. Originally I was prescribed one dosage, but that stopped being in stock months ago so they altered my size of the pills but kept me at the same daily dosage, just need to take more pills. Well starting in October this dosage size also started to be hard to find, and the pharmacy I normally use ran out and my doctor told me they don't have time to look around, so to call around until I found somewhere that had it and they could send my script there. Called around, found a place, no worries.\n\nFast forward to January and my stock was out again, but it was much worse and I was told to call different pharmacy chains. So I tried wallyworld and other box stores, until I call my nearby location that sounds like VHS, and told the pharmacist that I was calling to see stock of a medication. The guy is clearly annoyed but asks for my patient info, I tell him I have not used them before and I just need to see if they have stock first and then my doctor will send my prescription. He gets really cagey but says ok what medication, I tell him my Adderall dosage and he absolutely flies off the handle. \"UM SIR, THAT IS A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE AND FOR MY SAFETY  I WILL NOT EVER DISCUSS CONTROLLED STOCK OVER THE PHONE!\"\n\nRight away I'm taken back, I have called dozens of different pharmacies during this shortage and not once has someone acted like that was weird. I stay calm and respond \"Okay... I'm just confused as my doctor told me to call you guys and I've called other places with no issue..\" and he snaps back \"WELL AGAIN FOR OUR SAFETY I WILL NEVER EVER DISCUSS CONTROLLED STOCK WITH ANYONE OTHER THAN A DOCTOR, NOT JUST ANY JOE SHOPPING AROUND FOR DRUGS!! DOES THAT NOT SOUND REASONABLE TO YOU!?\"\n\nSo I'm just like okay man idk what to tell ya, I was told to call you by my doctor and you're the only one acting like this, but nevermind. I immediately call the other nearby VHS location and ask them their stock, not only does he give me the exact amount he has, he gives me sock amount of the first location I called, as well as when they get deliveries in to help my odds of finding some LOL. He said it was crazy what I experienced at the first place, and how its extremely common for people to call for medication inventory and especially Adderall due to the shortage. Good news is he said he'd let upper management know because that's not okay for him to freak out as he needs to be able to tell people these things.",

        "text": "I went to a gas station yesterday in my smaller/mid-size Texas town. I bought 2 cans of tobacco and a Gatorade totaling $16, and paid using my debit card.\n\nThe total was not displayed on the card reader, and when the clerk pulled and looked at the receipt he made a funny face before offering it to me. As he handed it he said he accidentally charged me $116 instead of $16.\n\nI acknowledged the mistake and politely asked him to just put it back on the card. He immediately told me he couldn't do that and started explaining to me how I could recover the money he overcharged me. He said he'd give me the receipt with the overcharge and a corrected one and write a note on it and I could go down to my bank and explain it and they'd give me $100.\n\nNow... I'm not a businessperson at all, frankly, but this didn't seem like the best option to me. I couldn't get him to accept that his plan wouldn't work so I called my bank and had to put them on speakerphone so they could tell him the same thing. Bank said if we couldn't resolve it I could file a dispute once the charge came through but I'd have to cancel my card and jump through hoops.\n\nI asked the clerk to call the owner and he immediately told me the owner is busy and doesn't have time to talk. I asked him to simply give me a $100 gas credit or cash instead. There were immediate \"buts\" to all of the solutions I offered.\n\nBefore I got off the phone with the bank rep I asked if I needed a police report to prove what happened and of course they said \"we don't have to have one but it's helpful.\" So I said loudly so the clerk would hear me, as I had walked away to verify identity with my bank... \"Ok, I'm going to see if I can get the manager/owner to resolve the issue and if I can't I will call the police and make a report.\" I didn't want to go to that extreme, but also didn't want to leave without my $100!\n\nThe clerk then had a new plan. He said the owner would be there in the morning and I could just come by and get my money then. He was still refusing to even attempt to call the owner so I called the police non-emergency line.\n\nKeep in mind that the conversation between the clerk and I all this time had been civil. I have lots of patience and simply dont like confrontation. The clerk just seemed to want to ignore the reality of the situation, that the business had \"taken\" my money and was refusing to give it back despite me offering several alternatives to resolve. I chose the word \"take\" carefully when I tried to sum up the situation in a simpler way because I had no desire to escalate or call it theft. He kinda seemed surprised, saying defensively \"I didn't *take* your money.\" \n\nI explained the situation over the phone and the PD dispatch said it wasn't a criminal matter, but a civil matter between the business and I.\n\nI then asked if it would be a criminal matter if I took $100 worth of items off the shelves and walked out with them and she said it would. I, flabbergasted, let out a sigh and thanked her for her time. Not trying to make this a police bashing thing, but wtf? \n\nThe clerk then says \"I can try to call the owner,\" walks 4 feet from the register and dials the number of the owner, which was written on the wall. I didnt ask why all of a sudden he chamged his mind. At this point I'm recording. Not pointing it at him or being a karen in any way. I was really afraid nobody would believe how fucking stupid this whole thing had been and I'd still be out $100.\n\nOwner doesn't answer. Clerk starts writing the note he wants me to take to my bank and I tell him we already talked to my bank and it doesn't work that way. I've been there for an hour at that point and the clerk starts having discussions with other customers telling them what happened and why I should just take the note to my bank. I ignored it.\n\nHe tries again to call the owner and gets an answer. He spends about 5 minutes on the phone with the owner and clearly he isn't explaining the situation effectively. He's trying to tell the owner about his \"note to my bank idea...\"\n\nI asked him to give me the phone. As he hands it to me he says \"If you can even understand him...\" and I'm expecting very broken English and difficult communication. Within 1 minute of me explaining the issue to the owner (who spoke perfect English, btw) the situation was resolved. I gave the phone back to the clerk and he pulled 5 $20s out of the till and handed them to me. \n\nI thought it was even Stevens, but...\n\nCake has icing, no....??? Yesterday was the last day of February 2023. I discovered after I left the store that one can of tobacco expired in November 2022 and the other in December 2022. : /",

        "text": "So a few years back when I was a kid (probably 10?) I was at the supermarket with my mom. We went through the whole store and I kept asking my mom for all kinds of snacks and sweets. She repeatedly said no. At the end of our visit, we went to the deli section. They mostly have meats and cheeses, but they also have stuff like potato salad or tuna salad. They also rotate things seasonally and this time, they had chocolate pudding. I knew this was my chance. If I could order the pudding before my mom had a chance to say no, the worker would have to give it to me right? They sold the pudding by the pound and I decided that I needed an entire pound. I knew I had to speak quick once they called my mom's ticket, so I got the sentence in my head ready to go \"pound of pudding!\". I kept repeating it in my head. Once they called my mom's number, I walked up to the counter and waited for the worker to greet my mom. Just as my mom was about to order, I cut it and screamed \"POUND OF PUDDING!\". The worker was shocked, my mom was shocked, and I was shocked. I didn't mean to yell. I just wanted to say it quickly, but I guess I got a little excited and screamed at the top of my lungs. The worker stared at me and then bursted out laughing. My mom also started dying laughing and I did the same shortly after. My mom looked at me and said \"Fine, you can have the pudding.\" It was the best day of my life. Finally I would have my pudding. The worker put it in the little container while still chuckling. She even gave me a little spoon so I could eat it in the car on the way home. And oh did I eat it in the car. By the time we got home, there was only a small amount pudding left and my mom looked at my shocked and gasped \"You ate ALL the pudding?! That was a whole pound of pudding!\". I just shrugged and she told me if I wanted a pound of pudding, I would have to eat the whole pound so she made me finish it in the car while she brought the groceries in. I didn't really understand why I had to eat it all, but now I realize it was because my brother would definitely be jealous that I got a pound of pudding and he got nothing. \n\nI still bring this story up once in a while and it gives us a good chuckle.",

But I was a customer at the time.\n\nMany years ago, I was shopping at a grocery store deli. You know the type, they slice various charcuterie, cheeses, meats, and make occasional sandwiches.\n\nI was in line behind a mother and her son. He was old enough to be exploring new flavors but young enough not to want to push the boundaries. His mother was frustrated because she wanted him to explore something beyond bologna sandwiches.

I need pastrami and salami and roast beef and provolone and swiss. And Use the spiciest mustard you've got. I don't want any bologna. I'm too old for that flavor!\"\n\nTattooed Biker Deli Dude, not missing a beat, responds in a deep gravelly, bass voice: \"You forgot to ask for rye bread.\"\n\nI responded with, \"I sure did. I'll take that too.\"\n\nSide note, Tattooed Biker Deli Dude, you make a fabulous sandwich.\n\nI turned around and saw (a little embellishment here) the mother trying to pick her son's jaw up off the floor. And I asked him if he would also have a man sandwich as well. And he silently nodded his head.\n\nI ran into the mother at the same store a few weeks later. I asked her if her son was still eating only bologna sandwiches. She sighed. And then she continued on, telling me that her son wanted to eat ONLY 'man-sandwiches' for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

Standing there with your girlfriend in tow ;)\n\nLast weekend my gf and me visited a local Lidl, this is a German discounter which - in my opinion anyway - sells pretty good stuff for very good prices. In fact, this supermarket is one of my favorites; also because they sell genuine German beer (fully committed to the Reinheits gebot!).\n\nBut I digress...\n\n**Standing in line before the till**\n\nWe had a bunch of stuff as well as some beer for the weekend, got in line and we soon noticed that it took quite a while before the line moved, things were unusually slow. Directly before us was an older couple, she was walking with an aid (\"rollator\") and he was also visibly of age: grey hair and the looks. They eventually get to the register and much to everyone's surprise: the cashier asks for their... ID? Obviously this took some time because this is something no adult would expect over here in the Netherlands, let alone a senior citizen!\n\nBehind us were a bunch of students who also saw the whole exchange and it immediately led to some remarks about having to be completely blind if you thought those people were under age. My gf also rolled her eyes when we saw this unfold and told me: \"*I'll handle that*\". I nod back and we put our stuff on the belt.\n\n**Cashier asks everyone for ID?**\n\nWell, sure enough: \"*I will need to see some ID to sell the alcohol*\", the cashier tells me. Not a problem I tell her, my gf will handle that. So I call over to my gf: \"*Honey*... *Aussweiss bitte!*\", and point towards the cashier who is now looking at me with a rather uncomfortable expression while the students behind us start laughing it up.\n\nSo my gf comes over and gives the cashier her ID who is now looking at it with utter confusion on her face. Oh, right, did I forgot to mention? My gf is of Japanese origin and thus has *two* nationalities: Dutch but she also has a Japanese ID, which is the one she just handed to the cashier.\n\nNow, the thing with a Japanese ID is that it contains *a lot* of kanjii (the strange Asian signs?) and if you don't know where to look then... good luck finding what you need.\n\nAfter she took her time staring my gf asked (in English) if there was something wrong...  \"*That's a perfectly valid ID*\", she told the cashier (my gf only talked Japanese &amp; English during this encounter).\n\nNeedless to say it seems the cashier didn't like any of this, she gave the ID back and then asked to see mine to which I told her that she could forget about that idea. After all: it was my girlfriend who was going to pay for our groceries so... obviously *she* needed to show ID, not me.\n\nWell, there was a bit of sputtering to which my gf told her that if she didn't trust our age then she should call for her supervisor: \"*Surely he'll be able to resolve this matter, no?*\", my gf says with a grin on her face: \"*Don't worry, we got time...*\".\n\nAnd with an annoyed look the cashier gave in, my gf paid and with a big grin on her face told the cashier: \"*And thanks for the compliment, I always knew I still looked my 20's*\". For the record: we're in our fifties ;)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I really don't know what was up with all this. Maybe she had a bad day, maybe she felt entitled... I dunno but either way it's *very* uncommon for cashiers to ask older people for ID when they buy alcohol in the Netherlands, this goes double for senior citizens.\n\nAnd because of all that the line went into extreme sizes, right through the middle of the store which is highly uncommon over there.\n\nEither way, I hope she got whatever it was that upset her out of her system and that things go back to normal.",

We booked them in a city in which we lived about two hours away from.   The day before we were supposed to shoot them she asked if we can reschedule.   When I told her the inconvenience we were in and we had a limited window to get this done.  I work on the weekends and I can’t ask off again for this.  So if she couldn’t keep the appointment we’ll have to cancel instead.      \n\nShe got mad and told me she needed to reschedule because she was going to the doctor because she had cancer.   Which I felt bad for that but we needed to get this done.    \n\nLuckily we found someone that was open and able to accommodate us on short notice.    So we took the photo shoot and drove home.  Sometime later we were at a point where we were ready to schedule a wedding photographer.  So I called the person that helped us out in short notice to get a quote since he’ll have to travel to out of state for it.   \n\nTold him my name and we worked with him before.   He immediately became suspicious and rude assuming that we were just using him for a quote.   Again reiterated he did our engagement photos sometime before and we were happy with his work.   Because of his poor attitude and my wife also found someone willing to do it heavily discounted through one of her bridesmaids.  So I didn’t even call that guy back because of that.",

        "text": "Me and a group of friends hang out and play TCGs at a store one of us owns. We got hungry and decided to hit up a very famous fast food place with Golden Arches. We were a large group so we ordered two of the new forty piece chicken nugget deals. \n\nI admit we should have checked before we left given it was a larger order, but we didn’t think anything of it. We get back to our buddy’s game store and start going through the bag and notice we were missing an entire other forty nuggets. We check the receipt on the bag to make sure we ordered correctly (we had a couple other items as well so the bag didn’t feel **too** light), and we did. So we make a call to the restaurant to inform them of the missing items in hopes that it was either sitting there and the drive thru forgot to give it to us, or they would just make more that we could go get. \n\nThe store answers and tells us to bring the food back with us. That felt weird to me because I was under the impression they couldn’t take food back after it left the premises, but whatever. We put it all back in the bag and make the trip back. We go inside and hand them the bag with the receipt on it, and the manager working there takes it back behind the counter and does something with it. Not sure, but she said that they would make us fresh nuggets along with the rest of the food in the bag. \n\nWe got our fresh food and left, but I still can’t help but feel like that was strange. Any time I’ve ever had problems with an order at a restaurant they always tell me to keep it and make a new one or apologize and give me a coupon. I was under the impression it would be a health code violation for restaurants to take food back like that (other than undercooked steaks and such) especially after it left the premises. Is this actually normal and the restaurants I usually go to (his store is in another state like 30 minutes from my house) are the weird ones? Just curious.",

        "text": "I recently dropped off some film from a disposable Kodak camera at a well known convenience store that does this for people. When I dropped off the film I was informed it would be at least a week. Whatever. I wasn’t in a rush. \n\nAbout two weeks later I have some free time so go back to the store to pick up the film.  When I walk in I go to the film department, and walk right past an employee - who looks up and sees me - who appears to be doing some stocking or inventory type task right next to the area where you pick up your photos. \n\nThere was one guy in the actual area to pick up photos and his back is turned towards me and I can see he is busy and focused on the computer editing passport photos. I wait patiently for a couple minutes, I didn’t want to be rude as he looked busy and was waiting to see if he would turn around. \n\nEventually I just say “excuse me sir?” The kind gentleman turns around and asks what I need and I just say need to pick up some photos I dropped off. He calls over to the other lady I mentioned earlier and asks her to help me. She certainly heard this interaction between myself and him, we were all within about 6-8 ft of each other, with me in the middle of them. \n\nShe comes over to the photo area and just stares at me with a thousand yard stare and asks if I need help. So I tell her yes, I need to pick up some photos. She just impatiently says “name?” so, unsure, just tell her my first name (which is obviously a first name when you hear it) and she just grabs a tub out from under the counter which has at least 50 packets of different peoples developed film. Next to these, I see like six other tubs with packs of developed film as well. \n\nShe just starts flipping through super fast and like halfway through throws one out on the counter with what’s very clearly a last name on it that sounds a little similar to the name I gave her and just asks, “this you?”  I tell her no it’s not. \n\nAt this point I’m just fed up with her attitude and frustrated because she clearly didn’t hear my name properly. So I clarify my first name and then give her my last name if that’s what she needs. Despite this, she doesn’t go back to another tub or start over. She finished flipping through the rest of the tub and then just said “Not ready yet.” Which I’m doubting at this point because it’s been two weeks and she clearly wasn’t even looking for the right name in the first place, first or last. \n\nSo I ask if she knows when it may be ready. She says “no idea” in the most flat and annoyed way possible, as if that’s such an unreasonable question. I tell her cheerily “thanks for being so helpful today!” And leave. \n\nI come back like a week later and the lady working was extremely nice. She immediately asked for my phone number and then located my photos within like 20 seconds, which I’m sure were there the whole time.",

There might be a case where a small part of the order gets forgotten, but I've always managed to get a refund for them and everything politely works out.\n\nThis time I once again ordered from one of the online stores and I have never had any problems with them before. I would rather say I have had an excellent experience instead until now.\n\nI ordered a console controller clearly advertised for console Y as different pictures and datasheets were presented for that product. What happened is that I received an older model for console X instead. I'm sure that mistakes like that can happen as someone might mix up the boxes since the controllers of the same brand look the same with only some subtle differences. However in this case I'm still not sure what to make of it when it turned out that they never intended to sell a product for console Y and seemingly tried to get faster sales for an older product for console X through misleading advertising.\n\nI contacted the store and they offered me a refund if I ship the item back at my own cost. To make up for that they promised to give me a discount which is equal to my shipping cost on the next order.\n\nThis offer might almost sound decent and seemingly solves everything, but then again is it actually reasonable? I paid the initial cost of shipping and I would have to pay the cost of returning the item. Then I'm forced to make an order for a random item which I don't even need to \"get my money back\" and then pay for that shipping also. This would make me pay three times for shipping, make another order by buying something which I don't need and still end up not having what I want. On top of that I would have to take the time to visit the post office and buy a shipping envelope for the package also.\n\nThis does not sound right at all. I'm sure there would be a good counter offer I can make?",

        "text": "This is an update to [THIS POST](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/10purwf/the_mystery_of_the_disappearing_100positive/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) from a month ago.\n\n**Condensed version**:\n\nI purchased a vintage model kit on \\[online auction site\\], but became suspicious of its authenticity after the purchase. I messaged the seller to ask if the item was a \"repop\" or if the contents had been inspected. The seller initially responded, but never followed up. The estimated delivery date passed, and the I sought advice on Reddit. I then messaged the seller again and received a response admitting that the kit was likely a fake and offering to cancel the order and issue a refund. However, to the my surprise, the seller shipped the fake kit after the cancellation was requested. I am now wondering if this strategy is an attempt to avoid a bad rating on \\[online auction site\\].\n\n**Normal version**:\n\nHello. I bought a vintage model kit on **Jan 27**. I’ve seen crappier specimens go for $2000, but this one was listed for $449.95. The seller looked legit—he allows 30-day returns (seller pays return shipping) and 100% positive feedback.\n\nThe more I thought about it, the more suspicious I became. Is it possible that he *himself* was scammed and is selling a fake item unknowingly? It could be a “repop”—a new kit disguised as a vintage one but worth 1/10th the value—or worse, a box full of loose plastic bits that sound like a model when you shake it?\n\nSince these kits are sometimes sold as collectibles while still sealed in shrink wrap, many buyers hesitate to open them to examine the contents. This could suggest that the seller may not have known the contents either.\n\nSo after buying, I sent him a message asking if (1) he knew for sure that it was not a repop, (2) if he had inspected the contents, and (3) why the shrink wrap looked so new.\n\nHe responded right away:\n\n&gt;Hi BUYER, you ask very good &amp; pertinent questions. If you don't think it rude of me, it's 11pm and I get up early. I will gladly tell you the story of the kit, previous owner who had quite a large collection and the homework I did on everything before listing it \\~ tomorrow!! If you'd prefer, I would gladly talk via phone about it all.I appreciate your thoroughness and am happy to see that the kit will be in good hands. Chat soon, SELLER\n\nTwo days passed and he never contacted me. So I wrote back on Jan 29, “Yes, I’m all ears, please send the info.”\n\nFeb 2, the far-end of the Estimated Delivery date, came and went.\n\nI asked people for advice on reddit. Some people said just open a case for item not received, others said to send one more message.\n\nBy Feb 19 (!), it was obvious that he had attempted a scam, had been caught, and wanted me to just cancel the order rather than fess up. I decided to send an overly polite and naive-sounding message just to see what would happen. Here’s what I sent:\n\n&gt;I hope this message finds you well. It's been 23 days since I purchased the “1961 Aurora #423 Frankenstein Model Kit - Instructions English &amp; French \\~ T710a” from you, and I still have not received it or any update from you regarding its status. I'm starting to get concerned about the situation, and I would appreciate it if you could provide me with an update.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I understand that you may be busy, but as a buyer, it's important for me to know when I can expect to receive the item or if there are any issues with the order. If you could let me know what's going on, I would greatly appreciate it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Thank you for your time and assistance in this matter.\n\nTwo days later, to my shock, he actually responded!\n\n&gt;I greatly appreciate your note and you patience. I sent a couple of messages early on that after some study, the box does not appear to be constructed the same as other 1961 vintage kits. **\\[This is a lie. He never sent any messages.\\]** The exterior is 'printed' onto thinner cardboard stock and does not show on the inside of the bottom lip of the lid. The early original kits have a bit thicker cardboard and the printed exterior paper 'wraps around' and underneath the bottom edge of the lid \\~ extending up a little on the interior of the lid.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We bought a large collection that did indeed include a good number of original kits along with cases of later era issues. It was the opinion of my lister at the time that these were truly vintage. After looking closely, I am led to believe without hesitation that the kit does not date to 1961. We located instructions from one of these and they were printed in the UK but are very 'white' and clean \\~ again on thin paper \\~ which makes me believe again that it does not date to 1961.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Please feel free to cancel your order and we will refund the payment immediately.\n\nI read the email/message last night and couldn’t believe that I got a reply.\n\nToday I got up to cancel the order and, to my utter amazement, right after telling me that it’s a fake, he shipped it.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. This strategy of ignoring me for three weeks, then admitting that it was fake, then telling me to cancel, and then shipping it anyway … does this combination of actions trigger the \\[online auction site\\] system in some way to make him look better? Because he can now say, “Hey! I shipped it! He can’t give me a bad rating?”\n2. What’s the best course of action now?",

A whole bag of books cost only $5, and you got to choose whatever books you could in the bag they gave you…\n\nBut library book sales are really hit or miss, and 90% of books aren’t really worthwhile (unless you’re a big fan of Nora Roberts, who had a disproportionately large number of books there). My partner brought me along it sort out the gems, but I myself haven’t really read much lately, so I’m there more for support than for help.\n\nAfter a half hour in the stacks, I start rummaging through the media hoping they have some classic console games to acquire. But before I can a particularly irate Kevin who appears to be in his early 60s captures my attention. He’s dressed neatly in a polo shirt and jeans, and a North Face parka.\n\nBoomer Kevin (BK): “I want to open this DVD to make sure it has all the discs.”\n\nGen Z Library Volunteer manning the volunteer desk: “Uh. Ok… Sir, this is hard to open.”\n\nThe volunteer is trying to open the plastic off a DVD case containing Guy Ritchie’s **Snatch**, but having a hard time.\n\n BK: “I want to make sure it has all the DVDs. One time, I bought a DVD and it was missing the special commentary disc.”\n\nMe, being Gen X and maybe feeling a little bit protective/white-knighting, insert myself as a buffer having dealt with my predecessors my whole life. \n\nMe: “Hey buddy. That’s a sealed DVD. It’s brand new. Look.”\n\nBK: “I want them to open it to make sure all the discs in it.”\n\nMe (taking the DVD from the struggling volunteer): “See these stickers on the top and bottom? Those are the stickers from the factory. This is factory-sealed. What makes you think anything is missing?”\n\nBK: “I want it opened to check.”\n\nMe, shoves it into his hands: “Then open it. You’re haggling over a two-decade old DVD at a library book sale. No one else cares if it’s open or not. And anyone else would throw it out if they had any problems this because it’s only $1. Now, stop giving these new young folks grief and do it yourself.”\n\nBK glares at me, then starts clawing the DVD. The volunteer gives me a thumbs up, and weirdly enough my partner got offered a free bag of books, and the library got an unsolicited donation of $10 from myself.",

THREE times recently I've had issues at different places where customer service refused to help me with my issue. Passing me along to different departments, telling me things were against policy even when it was the companies fault, etc.  \n\nAll three times, I've utilized the same method of emailing some random vice president of the company about my issue and explaining the ineptitude of the customer service team. Each time, this resolves my issue quickly and efficiently. It just goes to show how quickly they can resolve issues but refuse to do so because they rather keep your money. I guess a lot of people give up easily when they push back so they are now teaching representatives to push back and make it as difficult as possible.\n\nWhat is funny is that in most situations, they end up giving me MORE than I even wanted in the first place, all for a \"good faith gesture\". All I wanted was what I should have received in the first place, nothing more and yet now it costs the company more because you want to \"make it up to me\". It is such a bad trend.",

        "text": "I mentioned in my first post on here that we have recently moved into a new house and that our boiler isn't working. So here's the story of that whole mess.\n\nWe moved in at the end of November. This house is about 100 years old, is a former rental property and has not had much money spent on it. Our boiler is oil fuelled and provides heating and hot water - we have no electric shower units or anything. It's all the boiler.\n\nIn November we had someone come and look at it to help get it working after it had been unused for some time. He said he'd do a service on it but would be away for a few months. We couldn't get anyone else out because it was nearly Christmas. In January we had another company come out to quote for fitting some radiators (not all the rooms had them, because that would have made sense) as part of this they said they would service the boiler. I'll call them 'Company B' \n\nWell, 2 weeks ago (a few days before the radiators are due to be fitted) our boiler broke down. Turns out it hadn't been serviced in at least ten years. Maybe more. We lost heating and hot water.\n\nCue an emergency callout to Company B, as we were already dealing with them. They sent Engineer 1 to take a look. He couldn't do anything and the next day, Engineer 2 came out to check what parts were needed and to order them.\n\nEngineer 3 turned up a few days later to fit the radiators. After fitting 2 of the 3 radiators E3 told us that the third radiator hadn't been ordered and so he obviously couldn't fit it. He did however get the heating back on after a week of not having it, so we were pretty happy. Until then we'd been using two electric heaters for the whole house  which already has a damp problem, and it was getting worse without heating. \n\nStill no hot water though. Turns out they ordered the wrong part, they need some kind of valve but ordered the one for the heating, not the hot water system. \n\nA week passes.\n\nFor two and a half weeks at this point, we've been washing ourselves and the dishes with water boiled in the kettle. Four adults doing this caused our kettle to break yesterday, so we spent £30 on a new one. \n\nWe were told 2 days ago that our radiator, which was meant to be ordered weeks ago, has now been ordered but will not be here until mid march. Which is inconvenient but obviously not our biggest concern, though why they hadn't ordered it before is anyone's guess.\n\nToday Company B sent someone out to finally replace the part in our boiler. \n\nThey have ordered the wrong part. After looking at the boiler several times and sending several engineers, and ordering the wrong part once already. \n\nStill no hot water.",

And brings it back, on speaker. For 5+ minutes, she idly chats on the phone while tending to me. Then they quit talking, but stay connected. I can hear the woman on the other end sniffing repeatedly. After a few more minutes, I ask “Is she sniffing?” I get an nod. Bold for me, I ask “Why am I listening to this?” The cosmetologist points at the TV with the nature videos, but doesn’t hang up the phone. \n\nAfter the pedicure, while I’m waiting for the polish to set, the only other employee settles down and starts watching to - and listening to - videos on her phone. \n\nI need to find another salon.",

        "text": "Buckle in, this one ends with a twist.\n\nI moved house at the end of November and had run down all my bath and body products so I wouldn't have to pack them (I'm a bit of a soap hoarder). We stayed at a hotel overnight before moving and while there I decided to order a bunch of new shampoo bars, soaps, moisturisers etc etc from an eco friendly beauty company I'd bought from before, who were having a sale.\n\nRed flags I blithely skipped past - The company had changed names and when I went to their old website they say this was because they were being bullied/harassed over orders. Their new website listed products with a third company name on them too. Their ads on facebook are also all marked with 'angry reacts' with comments deleted. \n\nDid I heed this warning? Nay. I was bedazzled by a discount code.\n\nI placed a £20 order (which was down from £35 due to the sale). I was shortly notified of a partial shipment and we moved into our new house, where it would be delivered. Albeit by a courier and not the post office, which was the method I'd paid for at checkout. \n\nMy partial order arrived a few days later, missing like 2 items. I liked the items that had arrived and started using some of them. I was then notified that the sale was now EVEN BETTER, and because our new house was so depressing (mould, rubbish left behind, broken appliances, damp etc) I ordered a little pick-me-up - another £20 ish order.\n\nHere's where I begin to regret my choices.\n\nThe 2 items from my original order never ship. Because there's a strike on at the post office I am slow to start emailing, I give them like two weeks. Then I start asking for my order. I am told a replacement will be sent. Nothing arrives. I am told my items will ship tomorrow. Nothing arrives. I am asked to give them 5 business days. Nothing. Even though they already used a courier on my first order, they are now adamant that this is all to do with the post office. They can only use the post office and the strikes are causing a delay.\n\nDuring this time I am order lots of stuff for the house and it's all arriving within days, including the post office stuff. I tell the company this and they don't have an answer. Not to mention my order hasn't even been dispatched, so how can it be delayed in the post?\n\nMy second order (oh my hubris!) has also not even shipped partially. I placed the order on the 7th of December. \n\nIt is now JANUARY.\n\nI finally receive a dispatch notice on my second order - 2 items are being dispatched. \n\n2 of 9. After over a month.\n\nI email them and tell them this is getting ridiculous. No response. I give them a week before I open a case to get a refund. They send me an email saying 'a replacement is on its way'.\n\nMy 2 items from the second order arrive. Still nothing on the rest of my original order. I email them asking for a refund. The send me the same email as always - 'a replacement is on its way'. At this point I realise they're not even reading my emails. They're just sending the same response to every other email and ignoring the ones in between.\n\nI open a case with all my screenshots (the thread is actually too long to upload fully) and am quickly refunded for both orders (just for the items that didn't arrive, fair). In doing so I notice that their order confirmation for my second order lists 2 of some items when the total suggests I only bought one. But whatever, I get my money back. Who cares at this point.\n\nI later discover that the shampoo bars I ordered are DREADFUL. They don't clean hair at all. I am too tired to be angry at these people anymore. (Plus, our boiler, which the previous owners hadn't had serviced in 10 years, is about to break, leaving us with no hot water with which to use shampoo). \n\nTWIST TIME\n\nThe items from my second order were just delivered to my house, still missing one item!! \n\nI can only assume they are drop shipping or having these products made by multiple smaller companies and that they forgot to cancel the order when I refunded it. But, the items have arrived. I would send them back but I'm not going to spent another £4 odd on postage to give non-security sealed products back to this company so they can resell them. \n\nI hope you enjoyed my tale of woe.",

        "text": "This was a really terrible situation, and I've been upset about it for a few days. I have a fairly thick skin, but certain things can really send me over the edge.\n\nI ordered a koi plakat betta fish from a seller online. They had excellent reviews, only a couple bad reviews, but it's extremely rare to find anyone with zero bad reviews. I fully understand that things happen. I had wanted a koi betta for a long time, and the photos from customers showed absolutely beautiful patterns, so that's why I went with them. There is a pet store near me that carries betta, but they've never had any koi variants and I've been going there for years.\n\nI'm no stranger to ordering freshwater fish (also snails) online and having zero issues with the animals that have arrived.\n\nUnfortunately, the fish arrived dead. To start, they had it in a bag of water of course, but there was a really thin layer of bubble wrap around the bag. The styrofoam box they shipped in was way too big for the bag, and the bag had no cushioning to prevent it being jostled too much. Like, of course you have to ship in water, and of course the animal will get bounced around because it's in water, but this fish would have gotten bounced around A LOT. Way more than any fish could handle.\n\nI would just blame the shipping company, however, the seller didn't account for that either. A different seller I've ordered snails from will put them in enough water to survive shipping, plus soaking wet cloth, and with a heat pack or cold pack based on whatever the weather will be in the location they're shipping to. Also significant padding to avoid being tossed around. The fish seller didn't even try!\n\nOn top of that, the poor fish had ich on it. It didn't get the ich from the two day journey to my home. There were a lot of white spots (not shiny scales, actual ich), so it had been present for a while. Who does that? Send someone a sickly fish? If the fish had arrived live, I would have quarantined and treated it for sure, but that's obviously not a possibility.\n\nThe package arrived at 9:45am, and I got the email the package was in our mail lockers right when it was dropped off. The mail lockers where everyone from our complex picks up packages, is indoors and the room is well heated. I get dressed, go down the street to the lockers, get the package, and come back home. Open it up, discover dead fish, take photos. That was at a little after 10:00am.\n\nThe seller's policy was you had to open the package within an hour of arrival, photograph the fish with the bag UNOPENED within that hour, and within two hours write to them so they can refund. I did exactly that.\n\nWhat the seller tried to say was that I had left the package outside for 6 hours, didn't contact them within two hours of delivery, and that the bag in the photo was open. I took multiple photos, and had shared all of them. The bag is clearly CLOSED.\n\nI sent them the photos again, pointed out the timestamp on the photos, sent them the email of the delivery, plus the delivery confirmation from the site to show the package was not sitting outside for 6 hours.\n\nThey finally agreed to refund me.\n\nYes I left a very harsh review about them.\n\nI'm mad for ordering the fish, even though they sent me a sick animal which is their fault. A day after this happened, I saw a review that described something similar to what happened to me. So maybe they were good in the past but have gone down hill since.\n\nOn the bright side, the day this happened, I figured ya know what? I don't care about the koi variant anymore, the tank is cycled and I want a betta fish. That pet store I mentioned at the beginning of this post has some beautiful betta, so I'd rather have a healthy, living, breathing betta than a dead one. I go there and doncha know they have to koi betta, and I chose the one who has a red head, pink body, blue fins and silver speckles. His name is Kingsley, since he's in a planted tank. He's got a great personality and is getting along fine with the ramshorn snails and mystery snails. It took him all of a day to realize I'm the human who brings the food so he gets excited whenever I approach the tank. He's not easily spooked or anything, very active about also well-manner for a male betta. I couldn't be happier. It was a good end to a crappy situation.",

        "text": "I ordered an action cam from the biggest action cam company on 1/25 and paid an extra $25 for express shipping for it to get to my house by 1/27 since I was going on my honeymoon 1/28. I was super excited to have my first action cam to catch  all the Hawaii memories with my wife. Yeah, I was gonna be that guy who holds a camera in the ocean in Hawaii.\n\nHowever, on 1/27 I noticed that the delivery had been delayed and said that Saturday delivery had been requested, which of course wouldn't work for  me since I would be on a flight. So I called, got someone named Abby.  She assured that the camera would be delivered on time and asked for  proof that the delivery had been delayed. So I grabbed a screenshot of  their own website to send back to her, gave her my honeymoon address in Hawaii to reroute the shipment. She promised that she would get back to  me by the end of day with what was happening. When I asked to clarify  when the end of day would be, she dodged the questions and just repeated  end of day. I was just curious what time zone they were in, but I  shrugged my shoulders and moved on. Guess what happened by the end of  day? Nothing, no response.\n\nSo, on 1/28, during a layover I called again. This time I got a man named Jade.  I asked him to get the package rerouted or to talk to a supervisor. I gave him the address again because what he had on file was wrong. I told  him I'd be on a flight for the next 6 hours, but they could call me back anytime after that, which was still 2-3 hours of business time  left. Guess what happened by the end of the day? Nothing, no response.\n\nSo, on 1/29, I called again. This time I got quickly rerouted to a  supervisor, Fred. He seemed understanding. He promised to look into  possible solutions and to get back to me within 24 hours. He read me the  Hawaii address they had on file and it was wrong again, so I corrected  it again. Guess what happened by the end of the day? Nothing, no response. And what happened by the end of the next day? Nothing, no response.\n\nSo on 2/1, I called again, got someone named Arnold. I tried to get him to link me up with  Fred again, but Fred wasn't in office so they put me in the queue for  another supervisor. Thirty minutes later, David called me back. I told  him the whole story, how many times his agents had just dropped me. I  asked him if it was policy for agents to lie. He said no. I asked him if his agents had lied to me. He said no. I asked him what he was going to  do to fix this. He offered me a refund on my express shipping and that was it.\n\nI'm not even that frustrated about the delayed shipment now. I'm much more frustrated and disappointed about the circles they run around expecting me to put in the work to fix their screwup.",

Regardless of the validity of it, I’ve just continued to do it, old habits die hard.

I ask her for a can of butane, because in my experience they’re almost always behind the counter, and she just stares at me confused. Again, I ask her for a can, and she points to their small automotive section saying it could be there. \n\nI start trying to explain what it would look like, and the girl gets her coworker, who looks to be about the same age, come over and she asks the other girl if she knows what butane is or where it would be.\n\nThis other girl gives the same exact confused stare, looks at me, and gives me a one liner that I think about at least once a day. \n\n“Butane? Is that a type of cigarette?” \n\nWhat’s the meme where a person has their fingers pressed together against their lips - because that’s what my reaction was. \n\nAn older man was behind us, and he chimes in “Huehue different generation, huh” and we chuckle with him and I just give up with this girl. \n\nWe googled an actual smoke shop, I went and got my butane, happy ending. \n\nI try to give leeway with how young she looked, but aside from maybe not knowing anything about lighters or smoking - miss, you work at a gas station. Maybe have just a tad bit of product knowledge?\n\n I feel like I’m being too mean about it, but once a day I ask myself, “Is butane a type of cigarette?”",

        "text": "Just for context, this is a true story, happened a few years ago, I was not involved, I did witness this all happen though.\n\nAs I said happened a few years ago, I seen something today that reminded me of it.\n\nSo a few years ago around holiday time, I was out at the local Dollar store doing some shopping for some items I needed. This particular store was severely understaffed for the evening shift. There were two cashiers, even though the store only had three registers total. There was also one manager on duty. That made up all the employees in the store. It is holiday season, after Thanksgiving, so I have no idea why the store had so few employees working at night, when they have several during the day. But any ways, the manager had been in the back of the store the whole time I was there cleaning, arranging items on the shelf, trying to put things back where they go. \n\nAs everyone knows who work retail, when a company does this, they expect the manager to have the store cleaned properly by the next day, and to be out of the store on time. And it seemed all of this was laying on this one manager to do while the other two employees ran register.\n\nSo any ways, there were two lines backed up with people wrapping around the isle behind the registers. In one line a lady had on barely any clothes. It was December, but we lived in a southern state so it wasn't like freezing cold, but in my opinion a little to cold to be wearing what I call booty shorts, and sports bra, but to each their own, not my place to tell her what to wear. As I was standing there minding my business and waiting my turn, I guess someone close to the lady had said something about her choice of clothes, and how they were inappropriate to wear out in public. Next thing I know the lady started going off on a tangent about how these fat bi\\*ches needed to mind their business, and they were just jealous they couldn't look as good as her after having six kids. She was cussing, and raising her voice and get more vulgar and louder as she went on. A few people asked her to please keep her voice down, and not to cuss, because there was children in the store. Which only made her get louder. She got so loud that it drew the attention of the manager on duty.\n\nAt first the manager didn't know what was going on, she just assumed that the lady was aggravated because she had to wait in the long line. So she asked one of the cashiers why they didn't call her up for help. She opened her register, and started taking whoever came into her line. Well the lady doing all the yelling came into her line, and had two people in front of her. The whole time ranting and raving. So while the manager was ringing up the first person, she calmly asked the lady what the problem was, and asked if she could help in any way. The lady still cussing up a storm and still talking at the top of her lungs started telling her. \n\nSo the manager was like ma'am please I am trying to listen to what you have to say, but I would really appreciate it if you would stop with the cussing and lower your voice so I can understand you better. There are children here, and I do not wish for them to listen to this language. Well that set that lady off, and she started cussing out the manager. So the manager while still ringing up customers, and doing her job, simply stated if you can not lower your voice and stop cussing, I am going to refuse you service. Well as you can imagine that didn't go over well. So the manager stated calmly once again, that she refuses the woman service, and asked her to leave. The lady said f\\*ck off I am not leaving until I purchase my items, and if you don't sell them to me I will just take them. By this point the manager just picked up the phone, and dialed a number. \n\nAll the store is standing around watching this unfold, quietly. Even the ones who already paid for their items stuck in the store to watch it. The manger could be heard asking to have a police officer to show up, explained the problem, and said she would like to have a customer trespassed. Once through with the phone call, she went back to ringing up customers. Well the lady refused to leave. Stood in line with her items, and when she got to the front of the line, the manager simply picked up her items, grabbed a basket, placed them all in it, and stuck it under the counter, then started ringing up the next person. \n\nThat really set the lady off, and she stood in the way of the card reader, thinking if she blocked it, no one could swipe their card. The manger kept asking her to leave, over and over. But when it came time for the other customer to pay, she simply asked the customer for their card, and cashed them out from her side of the register. Bypassing the card reader on the counter. That really pissed the lady off, and she tried to come over the counter after the manager. \n\nIt was at the moment the cops came in and caught her trying to attack the manager, they handcuffed her and took her outside, and then one came in to ask what was going on. The manager explained, as well as a few witnesses and the lady had been arrested.\n\nSeveral of the customers, told the manager what a wonderful job she did keeping her cool, and how she handled it. \n\nI don't know what came of the lady, but the manager only stayed on at the store a couple months more. I had gone back in a few times after the incident, and talked to her. She was moving out of state. Hopefully she is doing well.",

I walk in and find the shipping counter next to the photo pickup. I excused myself and went around two customers waiting in the checkout line to get there.\n\nI start telling the woman behind the counter my details, but before she could grab my package, the second customer waiting to pay shouts over to me.\n\n“I’d just like to thank you for cutting in front of all of us in line!”\n\nI reply that I think this is the counter for picking up packages, and they are at checkout. Then the first customer in line chimes in.\n\n“WELL, SHE WAS RINGING PEOPLE UP, TOO!”\n\nI said “I’m sorry, I didn’t realize that, I thought this counter was for packages only.” The (very sweet) clerk is quietly telling me I’m fine while they both glare at me like I murdered their firstborns. So I said, quieter but still audibly, “Wow, what a bitch” and finished grabbing my package.\n\nI didn’t have to pay, or really do anything other than tell her my name and flash my driver’s license. This stupid interaction wasted more time than if they said nothing, because I would’ve been done already and she would’ve been back to checking people out. Why do people have to be such assholes about things that don’t really matter?\n\nShoutout to the lady behind the shipping counter who helped me, though. She was awesome. And I’m fairly certain I was in the right line all along.",

        "text": "I just recently turned 21 about 3 weeks ago and was picking up some Margarita mix at a grocery store. As soon as I put the bottle on the lever, the cashier gave me a dirty look. Granted, I do look young for my age so I completely understand when I get carded. I gave her my ID and she studied it for a good minute. I go to school out of state so I have a different driver’s license than she is probably used to. She says “I just have to double check with a manager since it’s out of state.” Of course, again I am totally compliant because I understand. She brings it over to a teenager who says it looks fine to him. Then, she brings it over to an older man who also says it’s fine. Then she goes over to the teenager again, points to my ID and says “Well what about this?” and again they grab the older guy. Meanwhile, there is a line building behind me and the woman right behind me is sighing in frustration. The older guy just tells the cashier “why are you asking me?” and then takes the ID out of her hand and scans it into their system. He says “See, it’s fine.” I think this took a good 5 minutes of waiting for her to figure out she could have just scanned it. She also could not confront me and tell me that she thought it was fake. I had bought alcohol from this same exact grocery store before and all they did was check it and scan it. This lady had some sort of stick up her @$$ and crumpled up my receipt and told me to have a good night. Told her “that was a little dramatic, have a good night.” Maybe this is not the worst experience but god it feels so good when someone like that gets proven wrong!! Anyone else have similar experiences?",

Despite being intimidated by the formal atmosphere, we decided to give it a try and asked about its child-friendliness over the phone. To our delight, the hostess suggested we dine in the restaurant's cozy kitchen area instead of the more formal dining room. We made reservations and were ecstatic. Yay us!\n\nAs we settled in, another couple came in without reservations and requested a table in the proper dining room. However, they were disappointed to be seated near us in the kitchen. They grew increasingly dissatisfied and even complained to the waitress. The owner/chef soon came over and, after a brief exchange, politely asked them to leave.\n\nMy daughter, who thought she was the cause of the commotion, became upset. But the owner came to our table, comforted her and told her that his food was meant for people like her who appreciate it. My wife and I apologized profusely, but he assured us that it was not our fault. My daughter was so happy, she sang him \"Baa Baa Black Sheep\" in French and he was touched by her performance. He brought over the hostess and his wife to hear her sing it again, making it a our most memorable family dining experience ever.",

        "text": "(Insert gratuitous apology for formatting; I'm on mobile)  \nQuick backstory: My parents owned quite a bit of land that was bisected by a road. It was a rural area, and the road didn't have utility poles for decades because there were no houses along it. Houses were built, and sets the stage for the story.   \n\nThe local cable company couldn't access the houses at the end of the road, and having people that could be paying customers without cable caused a certain amount of anguish to this company. \nThe company sent a rep to my parents and asked if they could put utility poles for their cable on my parent's property. My parents agreed. \n\nAll was well for about ten years.  \nNear one of the utility poles was an oak tree. A big one. Easily three times the diameter of a utility pole. One day, the tree was cut down, sectioned into fifteen foot long lengths, and stacked on my parent's property. They called the cable company. The cable company said they'd look into it.   \nA few months later, I showed up for Easter and the pile was still there. My parents were rather annoyed, and my mother said that the phone rep she talked to made it sound like she should be thankful that they have cable to begin with, so I placed a call of my own, and it went a lot this....   \n\"Hello, this is (cable company), how can I help you?\"  \n\"Hello. I'm calling on behalf of (my parents) at (my parent's address) and there's a pile of logs here that was made by your company.\"  \n\"Yes. I see the notation in the log. It says no actions taken.\"  \n\"I see. Did you think the problem was going to go away if you ignored it?\"  \n\"No, sir.\"  \n\"So then why didn't you remove them?\"  \n\"Because they were too large for our trucks.\"  \n\"So cut them?\"  \n\"We don't have the equipment to cut them.\"  \n\"Are you alleging that the tree cut itself down?\"   \n\"No, sir. It's just not our policy to remove trees we've cut down.\"\n\"So let me get this straight... it's your policy to trespass, destroy private property, and leave a dangerous situation for an elderly couple to deal with?\"   \n\"No, sir.\"\n\"Alright. So when can we expect them to be removed? Give me a day.\"\n\nThe conversation went on a little more, but in the end, it took two weeks, but they were gone .",

        "text": "My wife and I just got married and registered at Target for our wedding. We were gifted a few hundred dollars in Target gift-cards, which we loaded onto her Target app. Combined with gift cards she already had on the app (college graduation gifts from last year), our gift card balance totaled to about $400.\n\nOn two separate occasions, we tried to pay for in-person purchases at Target with these gift cards, and both times we were unable to use them. We would select “gift card” as the payment option at checkout and scan the barcode given by her app, and the payment just simply wouldn’t register. Both times, store employees were unable to help us figure out the issue, and we had to pay using other methods. We were pretty upset about this after the second time, so we went to the customer service desk, where the representatives were completely unhelpful and referred us to Target’s corporate customer service department.\n\nFast forward a few days. My wife and I are preparing to call customer service, and we open her Target app to find our gift card balance reduced to $1.56, down from $398 that we never spent. These gift cards were only accessible through her app, and there is no record of any purchases being made with them. I immediately call customer service to report this, and they pull up her account. They tell me that they see no history of the gift cards ever being on her account (like, yeah, we can’t either, that’s why we’re calling?) and that they can’t do anything unless we give receipts or numbers for all of the gift cards. We don’t have these because we discarded the cards after loading them to the app months ago.\n\nI don’t think my wife and I should lose $400 because of Target’s completely incompetent app software. Has anyone dealt with this in the past/have any solution suggestions?\n\nThank you!",

        "text": "**Event**\n\nHello! Four days ago I saw a MINT **1961 Aurora #423 Longbox Frankenstein Model Kit** on an online auction site for $500.\n\n**Description**\n\n&gt;1961 Aurora #423 Frankenstein Model Kit - Instructions English &amp; French \\~ T710a  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Brand: Aurora   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Name: Frankenstein  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Condition: This is a new kit that has the factory tape on it that has not been cut or removed and is sealed. The box at the top says Instructions in English and French and on the side says Aurora Plastics (of Canada) LTD. Toronto (Rexdale) Ont.. We have not seen any kits like this in our search for a comparison.\n\n“That's odd,” I thought. “People sell 1961 Frankensteins in chewed-up boxes with missing parts for over $1000 all the time. This must be a repop.”\n\nTick … tock …\n\n“Then again, this person might not know the market value and I should jump on it!”\n\nTick … tock …\n\n“Oh hell, every second that passes means a possible loss!”\n\nAnd so, just in case it was real, I did a **Buy It Now**.\n\n**Communication**\n\nRight after clicking the **Buy It Now**, I sent seller a message:\n\n**My message January 27, 2023 8:00 PM**\n\nHello! Well, I couldn’t believe that an original mint from 1961 was available. I felt regretful paying the “Buy It Now” price—I've never done that before—but when I saw that you accept returns, I nabbed it.\n\nSo I'm wondering if it's a repop or a trick item. The main reason is the shrink wrap. I've bought a ton of Aurora models, and the one time I bought one with new shrink wrap, the box was full of scrap. (My neighbor's a dentist so I can x-ray stuff for free.)\n\nOf course, I know you wouldn't do that. But the person you bought it from might have—especially if you received it with the new shrink wrap already on.\n\nAnother issue is that the companies making Aurora repops now often design the boxes to look original, so they omit things like actual company name and actual date.\n\nSo that's the background info that's motivating my few questions:\n\n(1) Are you sure it’s not a repop? If so, how?\n\n(2) Have the contents been inspected? If not, do you trust the seller?\n\n(3) How it is that the shrink wrap looks so new?\n\n(4) Are those Scotch tape marks stains or tape?\n\nI think that covers everything. If it’s a genuine item then I’ll be eternally grateful and do some free social media marketing for your store. Thanks in advance for reading this long-ish comment.\n\n**His** **response** **January 27, 2023 10:00 PM**\n\nHi BUYER, you ask very good &amp; pertinent questions. If you don't think it rude of me, it's 11pm and I get up early. I will gladly tell you the story of the kit, previous owner who had quite a large collection and the homework I did on everything before listing it \\~ tomorrow!! If you'd prefer, I would gladly talk via phone about it all.\n\nI appreciate your thoroughness and am happy to see that the kit will be in good hands. Chat soon, SELLER\n\n**My response January 29, 2023 7:00 PM**\n\nHello! Yes, that would have been great. Tomorrow was yesterday, but I’m still all ears.Please send the info.\n\n**Update**\n\nIt’s Jan 30 2200 CST. I figured I’d stumbled on the find of the century because I’d never seen the item before in my Aurora Monster Model “feed”—I get emails from the online auction site showing new Aurora models every morning.\n\nBut just now went into the sellers’ Revision Summary for the item and … it has an **Up Since** of **Oct 27, 2021**!!!\n\nImpossible! Are sellers really allowed to change the title and photos of items? How have I never seen this before? People buying worse-condition ones for $2000 would surely have nabbed it in that time. So I guess that means it’s fake after all! Right?\n\nAnother skepticism falsifier is that the seller has 100% Positive feedback.\n\n**My questions are**\n\n1. What was my biggest mistake in this transaction? Should I have kept quiet after ordering and then just sent it back after x-raying? I think so. If it was fake, he pays return shipping and I get to warn the community about a proven scammer. And if it was not fake, why tell him and warn him to cancel the order and re-list it at 5 times the price?\n2. What would a seasoned or non-stupid person have done? Kept quiet and then returned it if it was fake?\n3. I should mention that I don't actually have free access to an x-ray machine.  I just wanted to avoid being scammed with a box of scrap, or (worse) a fake (newly printed) box with scrap.\n4. How can it be that 100%-Positive feedback sellers scam people?",

The courier was going to arrive on Friday but I was at work so I had to reschedule for a different delivery day when it’s most convenient (we informed the courier company to not delivery it on Friday but they did not listen). But I thought it should arrive on Monday instead. However, today (which is Monday here in Australia) I was really stressing out and I sounded like an angry man complaining on the phone. I called and complained to customer service at this depo on three phone calls but all the told me was that you will receive a notification (still no notification nor update) and I was really agitated because I waited for awhile and was mentioning the other customers that used their service were really dissatisfied and I feel like another complainer just like them. I told the first dispatcher that I don’t want to make a lawsuit of this because of the incompetent I’m hearing on their (crackling). When I got transferred to another dispatcher who I thought that can help it was always the same woman who sounded a bit like some butch and there was a bit of cock fight on the phone because I felt like my parcel will never arrive. She only told me as if it’s making it easy for her that she emailed courier about my parcel but I think nothing has been done. I told her that I don’t have to write a bad review because many people have and I just hung up saying whatever (and she did too). I hated the way I acted on the phone but I really felt like they were being really rude in some ways too.\n\nI really felt like crap but I had to stand up for myself in this situation and I should have just forgotten about it because nothing would happen regardless (I wouldn’t receive my parcel) - took my day off from work today just to receive it.\n\nI hate to rant on here. I’m just really frustrated with them because it just feels like eternity and now I don’t feel like I’m looking forward to my parcel arriving as a result. It will not arrive.\n\nI feel like shit and it doesn’t matter if they are a shitty service I just feel like shit for being shitty. I don’t want to be another Karen. Will anything bad come if it? I heard that they do break parcels and leave them unattended for theives.\n\nI’m curdling into a ball and all I see is black with a pillow on my face.\n\nI apologised to the woman about my behaviour.\n\nThen next morning I checked my tracking despite no further updates on the whereabouts of the item. My mother got involved (she was a lawyer) and complained to them on my behalf. She had even asked the server on the phone of we can even come and pick it up but the said no don’t do that and then hung up on her. I got so mad that I rang them up (I swore to myself not to) and threatened legal action because this was not on and I want to speak to the head manager (her name) . I told her not to call me sir because I’m trans but still still called me sir smh. They got all bitchy and complained (like little children) that I am abusive (they lie a lot) to them but I told them that I did not even swear at them. The lady ordered me to stay on the phone until she got someone higher but I hung up immediately. No wonder this service has received 1 star…\n\nI still haven’t received my parcel. They said that they will just leave my parcel at the door step of my apartment (like never) and remain unattended. My area has a high rate of theft.\n\nThis is so stressful and uncalled for. So I just backed out and forget about my $5000 parcel from now on smh. Knowing that we are not allowed to pick it up sucks even more. (Other people have complained the same thing)\n\nThis company should never exist. Even bad courier services can do better. I feel like crap because I never complained like this before.\n\nWe’re thinking about filing a PayPal dispute to get out money back. Smmmmhhhh the depo close by to me is like 15 minutes away so they could have delivered it. But they just ignore my parcel even existed and I’m still not notified.\n\nBs. \n\nI could go on about it I will stop now.",

I dont want mymaccas, i dont want hungry jacks shake and win or club x's porn rental app (i assume such a thing exists, if it doesnt it will soon enough). Not interested.\n\nNow its a 911 and im served by the same two people every time (i think they must run the place because they both look and act like management, not like an underpaid drone whose job is to man the til). I dont expect them to remember my face (ive worked cust service jobs like that before, you get so many every week of course ya cant remember every face that walks through), but i do expect them to hear the words \"I am NOT interested\" and respect that their customer isnt interested. I dont wanna hear a fucken sales pitch every fucking time i show up to fill up petrol or buy a damn krispy kreme\n\nI think next time im just gonna tell them \"look im in here 2 or 3 times a week. If youd like me to keep coming here respect the words 'NO I AM NOT INTERESTED' and stop trying to sell me something i do not want. Otherwise keep trying to sell me this app and i wont ever come back\", theres another 911 less than 5 minutes away, sure they are smaller and only have V in cans, but screw it, ill take that over folks who keep trying to push an app on me\n\nam i the only one sick of this bs?",

        "text": "My husband and I were sitting in a diner eating lunch one day. At first we thought we had a great server. Friendly, attentive etc.\n\nWhile sitting there enjoying our meal, a guy I knew my whole life came in. Now mind you he is older than I am, was friends with my mom. And lived in a care facility, because mentally he was not all there. During the day he rides his bike all over town, it gives him something to do, and he enjoys it. At night he goes back to the care facility. He gets disability, but most of his money goes to paying the care facility to live there. \n\nWell on this day he came in, asked a waitress for a cup of water in a to go cup. My waitress decides to chime in and says, you know we can't just give you the water, you have to pay for it. Robert was already pulling out change and counting it out at this point, and he said yes I know and held up the change. My waitress kept after him, saying I don't think you have enough change, you can't get a water, and just berating him. \n\nI told my husband that I was going to buy Robert a drink, and he was ok with it. So I called my waitress over, ( at this point I am upset at the way she treated Robert , but don't show it) and I said add his drink to my bill. She said you don't need to do that, he comes in every other day and expects us to give him water for free. I am not allowing you to pay for him. That statement right there set me off. So loud enough for the whole place to hear, I said for starters it is none of your damn business to tell me what I can and can not do with my damn money if I want to buy someone something I damn well can, and your job is to do what the f\\*ck I want. Secondly your behavior towards that man was nasty and out of line. Sitting here loudly berating him because he looks as if he don't have enough money for something. You don't know Robert or his situation. I do , I have known that man my whole damn life. Thirdly water is f\\*cking free on your menu, but you want to be a b\\*tch and charge him for it, because you think he is homeless and beneath you. Well news flash b\\*tch that man is not homeless. Stop passing judgement on people because of the way they look. Now give him his damn water, and it better be a f\\*cking large one, put it on my f\\*cking bill, and bring me my damn bill. I will not be leaving you a tip, and I want to talk to your manager right now,\n\nShe ran off to get manager , while the whole diner applauded me. Robert thanked me, and the manager came out to talk to me. I told him, that I did not appreciate her attitude, that if she wasn't reprimanded I would leave a review online, as well as call corporate. And that from now on if I ever heard of Robert being treated that way again, I would make sure everyone knew how they treated customers in their establishment. He assured me he would rectify the situation, and any time I saw Robert after that he said he has never been treated poorly again.",

You can tell they market themselves to a specific upper middle class crowd with its focus on clean eating and being health conscious. It is very much a \"white people\" restaurant but in a good way, or, well, so I thought. \n\nWe waited in line to order, and when it was our turn, the cashier looked at my friend, scrunched her face, and said in a condescending tone, \"Oh... you have *interesting* eyes.\"\n\nMy friend replied, \"My eyes?\"\n\nAnd the cashier said, \"Yeah. Your *EYES*,\" and touched the slant area. My friend didn't know what to say and was flustered and embarrassed and just thanks and left. \n\nNow for context my friend is Korean and she has small asian monolid eyes. For asian americans, our eyes have long been a subject of pain and harassment, and that \"compliment\" was definitely a purposeful microaggression. \n\nI wish we could say we brushed it off but ngl it ruined our meal and the vibe of the rest of the day. and  I tried to talk to the manager after but the employee said there was no manager (?) on duty. She gave me a business card and I tried to get in contact with the manager multiple times but was unable to. When I called the number another employee picked up and said he is sorry, will tell the cashier to not do that again (that's it??!), will refund us the meal, and the manager will contact me back asap. Surprise surprise, no refund ever came and the manager never called me. \n\nIt wasn't worth pursuing so I dropped it, but the whole situation still makes me really upset.",

I saw him pick it up at 8pm, but it was delivered at 8:30pm. Not sure how that took 30 minutes. It showed the latest arrival time as 8:05pm. I was slightly confused and annoyed, but wasn't going to make a fuss. \n\nHe knocked on our door and when I opened the door and said thank you, he tells me I should tip more and if he can have $50 because I live in a nice building. I was in shock. \n\n1) I don't live in a nice building. I'm in an old co-op, not a luxury condo. Like the building has bug and rodent problems, and is noticeably falling apart.\n\n2) The food wasn't even $50. Why would I tip $50?\n\nIn shock, I said \"no, why would I do that?\" And his response was \"some of my customers tip $50. You seem to have a nice apartment too and you probably have $50 lying around. I also take Venmo.\" Which also not true, we just moved to a new place and it's basically empty. At this point, I get creeped out and I slammed the door, locked all the locks, and called the front desk to make sure he left, which he did. \n\nI sent a complaint to Boober and they sent me back a generic response about how they care about customer safety. We've been asked for more tips before, but this guy was just creepy.",

For as long as I've gone to this store (and the chain itself), it's always let you do this sale twice a day using their membership card. So I went to the self-checkout and rang up my items, and it wouldn't take the money off for the second order (someone in the meat dept. had stickered a couple of packages of meat wrong). I called for the cashier watching the self-checkout over to help me. She said \"oh, it only lets you get that sale once a day\". I asked her when they had changed that (keep in mind the sales paper and all of the signs in the meat dept say \"limit 2 transactions per day\"). She said \"it's been that way since I started working here in 2017\". I told her calmly that I've been coming to this store for years and 2 a day has always been the policy, and that it says it on the advertisements. Her response? \"Are you ret**ded or just stupid? I know my job! Do I come to your work and tell you how to do your job?!\". Then she walked away, leaving the self-checkout on an employee service page...so I couldn't even check out. \n\nAfter that, I left my stuff and walked over to the CS desk. I told them what happened, along with this nice old lady who was checking out at the self-checkout next to mine who confirmed what the cashier had said. The manager on duty fixed my purchase (it took them a second to figure out that something had been mislabeled), and they called the cashier over and asked if what I said was true. She tried to say that I screamed at her and demanded free stuff, which was swiftly debunked by the nice older lady and several other people who were nearby. They fired her on the spot, and she's walked away in a huff.\n\nI wasn't happy she was fired, even if she deserved it. I was sad more than anything. If she had so openly said something like that to me, a person who isn't mentally handicapped, you can imagine that there's a good chance she's said it to someone who was. I can't begin to think how that would feel. And if she had just taken the time to look over my order in the first place and find that one item (that the manager found in like a second), all of this could've been avoided. \n\nPeople, please don't use the word \"ret**ded\". While it was at one time a common word to display disgust with someones stupidity or the stupidity of a situation, we know now that it is really hurtful.\n\nTL; DR: cashier used a mentally challenged slur at me and didn't do her job, and the result was that she was fired on the spot.",

In addition to a few snail species, I was also planning to house a banjo catfish.\n\nLast time I set up an aquarium like this, the animals arrived before the food did (it was a problem with the carrier, I ordered the food well in advance), so this time I decided to order the food and wait until the food arrived before ordering the animal.\n\nThe massivore pellets I got, came today. The good news is, they would be great for the banjo catfish. However, my roommate pointed out that they might eat snails, even though the breeder I was gonna buy the catfish from said they don't. A few internet searches later, and banjo catfish eat snails so nope, not getting that fish. That's totally my error for not doing extra research, but at least I don't have an animal that's gonna gobble up my snails.\n\nUnfortunately, the seller of the massivore pellets did not list all the ingredients on the site, and passed off the ingredient list as being all the ingredients when they really weren't. Like, I'm kicking myself for not thinking to ask if they were all the ingredients, but it's also really annoying they didn't include half of them. The massivore pellets contain copper-sulfate, which is toxic to snails, and wasn't listed on the seller's site. So I have this food that is non-returnable, and cannot feed to my snails.\n\nI started asking around to my friends online if they have catfish or know anyone with catfish who would like some free pellets.\n\nAgain it's pretty much my fault, but at least I didn't have my snails dying from toxic food or getting preyed upon. In the end I just have a bag of fish food that I don't need. Could have been so much worse.\n\nI'm also one of those people who won't get a pet of any kind unless I have 100% of the info, so I'm also kicking myself for not researching as intensely as I normally do.",

        "text": "Hello reddit, I have decided to join you as a way to relieve stress and built up frustration in my life anonymously. Today it's about my experience at a known food chain this week. \nI'm sorry if I offend anyone or if I come off as whiney. \n\n'Midge of backstory; my days are not in routine, I struggle often, I have a clingy older infant, and living situation causes me stress. Work does too, am a retail worker and recently I have been struggling with my performance (which I am not proud of). The town I live in doesn't have many pleasant residents. I have more negative interactions than positive, neutral being the usual. \nMy child is hard to lay down to sleep so often I am tired and lack energy, I don't drink energy drinks (for multiple reasons).\nI'm fairly shy and get nervous when ordering food. I don't like to bother people and hope people wouldn't bother me BUT when I work, people have actively harassed me. I have grown to dislike people in the recent two years. I still try to maintain a level of professionalism even though my willpower to is draining.\n\nThe story: My day started with me opening the store. I am one of the key delegates for managing. It opens at 8 but we have to be there either at 6-7 am, and my child didn't sleep until 4. I was tired. It was a busy morning, I was by myself for 3 hours, had a deadline for a store task, a few customers threw their money (very rude by the way especially when your cashier has their hand out for the cash). Prices issues. Unhappy people here and there. Tiring day. I didn't get breakfast or lunch. I got off at 3 and my lover texted me about getting food from the mentioned food chain. I agreed and off I went.\n\nI wear glasses and completely forgot them (don't do this) as normally I don't wear them at home but I can't see far away as well, and I don't have a spare in the car (we all should ngl). But I generally remembered what my lover likes since they didn't specify what they wanted so the menu wasn't as much of an issue until I decided I wanted to get something but wasn't sure. I probably should have looked at the menu online. It didn't occur to me. I get into the building. \n\nI greet the ladies there, I slightly cut off the lady but I didn't mean to because we greeted at the same time but I apologized. Her face went from smiling to sort of a deadpan I guess. I really wasn't trying to cut her off. She asked what my order was but I forgot how many chicken fingers were in the item so I had to take a moment, I apologized and said I forgot my glasses. Everything is fussy up there.. okay? \n\nI ordered three items. A salad, the meal fingers, the chicken sandwich meal. She asked a name for the order and I gave my name. She asked for the spelling (no one has ever asked me for the spelling), I spelled it out, she said it back. With how my name is you could put idiot in there if you take off the a and add ot. I heard her lowly say it but I didn't think much of it. My receipt however had the spelling she gave me. I could tell she was irritated and pissed off about something from her demeanor. My order came quick. I was struggling with the ice drink machine as it wouldn't give me ice immediately when she yelled for me with a tone even though she saw me right there. I haven't a clue what I did. I apologized and thanked her. \n\nI am a bit goofy by nature and it gets more noticeable when I lack the requirements for surviving. However I really can't think of a reason as to why she blatantly insulted me. I did nothing to her. The order didn't take longer than 2 minutes if even a minute and they were dead at the time. I read the names out properly. I just took a few extra moments. I have gone there on other occasions and all were pleasant except for one other when this boy in the further back of the restaurant saw me, made eye contact, and said \"oh boy here we go\". I laughed at him and made my order quick with no issues and went about my business while staring at him. Because why not. Their job is on the same street as mine and it is possible some of them have gotten pissed off with my store. It's whatever. It's just.. I don't try to cause issues for workers. I can understand struggles BUT GOOD LORD I don't take kindly to being insulted for nothing. I don't do that and I have angry issues-",

        "text": "This happened around 5 years ago. This is copied and pasted from another site I posted it on. \n\nMy friend, her eleven-year-old daughter, and I go to a local village today for their Scarecrow Festival, a tradition that we’ve been enjoying for about seven years. Before getting started, we go to one of the restaurants for lunch.\n\nWe arrive a little after 11:00 and are seated right away. The restaurant had just opened so it’s not busy at all.  The waitress brings our menus and takes our drink orders. When she returns:\n\nMe: “I’ll take chicken salad on a croissant with American cheese and mayo on the side, please.”\n\nFriend: “I’d like roast beef with horseradish sauce and a bowl of French onion soup.”\n\nDaughter: “I’d like a house salad with ranch dressing and chicken fingers.”\n\nThe waitress leaves and comes back a few minutes later.\n\nWaitress: “Where did you see roast beef?”\n\nFriend: “On the menu.”\n\nIt turns out that they have new menus they started today, and the one my friend ordered from was the old menu. [Friend] changes her order to a crab cake sandwich. No problem.\n\nThe food comes out and my friend’s daughter tries her salad.\n\nDaughter: “This isn’t ranch dressing.”\n\n[Friend] and I try it and we both agree politely that it’s not, and we request the correct dressing. When the waitress brings out new dressing, she has an attitude.\n\nWaitress: “Try this one.”\n\nThe ranch is right this time. I politely remind her about my mayonnaise, which she has forgotten.\n\nFor the next forty minutes, our waitress ignores us. She doesn’t check to see if everything is okay and doesn’t see if we would like refills. I never get my mayonnaise. She serves the tables around us since it’s gotten busier now. But she walks right by us and looks right at us but ignores us. We’re finished eating but she doesn’t even come back to take our dirty plates. My friend and I are both getting pissed, but she’s keeping it together because her daughter is with us.\n\nFinally, after we’ve been there an hour, the waitress FINALLY comes back to our table and asks if we’d like anything else. We say no and that we just want the check, and she leaves. Five minutes later:\n\nWaitress: “Hey, I just wanted to double-check. You didn’t need anything else, right?”\n\nUs: “No.”\n\nTen minutes after she first asked us, she brought our check out, and then we had to wait another five minutes or so before she took the card to run it and then finally came back with the receipt. She got a $2.99 tip on a $60+ check.\n\nWe didn’t blame her for the first two things; they were out of her control. But the attitude and the fact that she ignored us for most of our lunch is inexcusable.",

THEN I get an email stating they cannot cancel and order once it has shipped...excuse me?! \n\nFine, I get the order, I send it back. Don't even open the package. \n\nThey then try to tell me that they can only refund the purchase price, not the shipping...because they had to pay to ship it to me.  \n\nI just want my money back! They are no longer responding to my emails, or my texts, and the phone number on their website goes to a voicemail that is full. \n\nI finally got fed up today and posted on my facebook and IG and tagged them in it, as well as messaging them on their accounts on those sites. \n\nY'all, I really don't think it should be this difficult for me to get my money back. They confirmed they received the product back. \n\nAnyone have suggestions for other things I can try to call them out and get my money back from them? I'm super pissed off about this whole thing. \n\nThank you. \n\nPS I also have emails and texts from them confirming the return of the product and multiple times being told it would be \"elevated\" to management.",

My first stop didn’t have the kind I was looking for, but I decided to grab some candy for the walk, which I put in my jacket pocket. My next stop was a nearby drugstore, which I went in, checked the fridge aisle, and left. I went to a crosswalk and I started eating my candy pondering where in the world I could find milk at this hour when the nighttime manager poked out of the doorway and told me not to come back. I had no clue what he was talking about until he accused me of taking the candy, which he said I didn’t have on me when I came into the store and that it was all on tape. I offered to let him scan the candy or look at the cameras which I knew would prove me right (I walked through the make up section to get to the milk, I was nowhere near the candy aisle), but the guy refused to do either, threatened to call the cops and stomped off. It was important that I could go back to the store again because I use this particular drugstore to refill my medication. I tried calling them and the employee who picked up told me I probably shouldn’t come back because “The manager made a decision” but I didn’t let up and eventually got to talk to the manager. I think he knew he messed up because he was far more cordial this time around and went on about how there was a group giving them trouble 20 minutes before I came in and they thought I was part of it. He said he wouldn’t check the cameras because it was “too difficult” and gave me an apology along the lines of ‘I am sorry if you weren’t actually shoplifting’. I got a confirmation that he wouldn’t call the cops if I came back, but the situation still ticks me off. I get that I might have seemed suspicious, but what angers me the most is that the guy refused to even check if I actually stole the candy, even when I offered him ways he could determine it.",

        "text": "This story was from awhile ago but I just discovered this sub. My wife and I were going to an early show at the theater during the week, and we went to a nearby restaurant for lunch. It was a nice little place that I'm sure gets busy at night, but was basically empty for lunch, there was only 1 waitress and no one else eating besides us and a small group of young Asian guys a few tables down.\n\nWell as soon as the waitress walks up, she immediately gives off just an aura of hostility. She was not friendly at all, very short and seemingly annoyed with any questions we had. She'd disappear for long stretches and eventually she gives the other group their bill. Now the guys seemed quiet and friendly and didn't do anything weird or inappropriate while we were there, so idk if they were the cause of her anger but however she spoke to us, she was worse to them, and it was clear they didn't appreciate it either. Well they pay their bill and leave while she's away. She walks up to grab their check, and literally yells \"what the F\" sprints to the exit after them and starts yelling at them down the street \"SO YOUR JUST NOT GONNA EFFING TIP ME HUH??\n\nNow I used to manage a restaurant, no matter how bad the service is, I always tip. It's just usually like 30% for good service and less for bad service. Now I'm sure I'll get heat for rewarding bad behavior, but the food took forever and we didn't want to start any fuss out of fear of being late to the show.  However my wife was legitimately so worried she'd freak out and chase us if we gave her like 15% that she added extra \"protection money\" just to get us safely out of there 😂.  Needless to say we haven't gone back since.",

        "text": "Back in the early 2000s my parents and I went to a chain restaurant. My parents are from the Midwest and didn't know any better. I wasn't thrilled but the food was usually OK. \n\nThe service, however, is pretty bad and the environment is gross. But this one lives in my head and keeps me from ordering certain things in public, to this day. \n\nWe sat down and my dad decides to order either mussels on the half shell or oysters for a starter course. I'm like cool, yeah, I like both of those things. \n\nThe server looks surprised but doesn't say much, we put in the rest of orders. I know I ordered a cobb salad with blue cheese on the side. \n\nShellfish comes out. \n\nWe all say something like yeah, that looks good and start eating. \n\nA minute later a different server or employee is gawking at us over the half wall. I look back and she's like \"I just wanted to see if you all were actually eating that. It looks so nasty.\" She shudders. Her body language is judgemental. \n\nOkay, wtf. \n\nShe stares for a bit. \n\nI feel self conscious as the person closer to my age is making fun of me to my face and I'm like 17 or something. \n\nI stop eating. \n\nSalad comes out with two dressings. Server is like \"I brought you some ranch in case.you wanted to try it. Ranch is so good.\"\n\n\nFuck you, lady. I still hate ranch. Blue cheese is superior. \n\nAlso their \"blue cheese\" was gross. Pretty sure it was ranch with chunks of blue cheese. \n\nAnd that is it. It's not much of a story, but I'm angry at myself every time I see mussels/oysters on the menu and wish I'd said something to that ignorant and pathetic white trash woman. She basically ruined eating in public for me for a long time. \n\nAnd that wasn't the last time people tried to force ranch into me, and probably won't be the last. I wish i could just leave the US.

        "text": "I'm pretty easy going and I know what I want. I worked food service when I was young, then moved to retail and then owned my own retail store for many years. I know shit happens, that it all works out in the end, and not getting stressed about stuff is the key to happiness. I don't like drama. Some people just can't work with that, probably because there's no suffering in it.\n\nThere was a restaurant that I used to eat at two or three Friday nights a month. It was high end casual. White table cloths, they changed the cutlery between courses, just under a hundred dollars per person without alcohol. We don't drink.\n\nOne server who had been there forever took care of the back of the room by himself with a runner/busser. Six deuces, three four tops a four person booth and a six person booth. We were always there about five. I had someplace to be at 7:30. The hostess would seat us and he would be right behind her with our drinks. We were fast. No alcohol, gone in an hour, good tippers. If it was busy, he could get another turn out of that table.\n\nOne night we walked in and he was working the front. When he saw us, he mouthed 'sorry.' The manager had decided to put him in the front and two servers in the back section. His section was full. Right away things went off the rails. I wanted a tonic water with a lime, in a pint glass. Huh? Tonic water. Out of the gun. With a lime. Just tell the bartender; she knows. I got soda water with a lemon in a ten ounce glass. Whatever, that'll work.\n\nIn this place, all the entrees changed throughout the week. On Fridays there was usually a bunch of stuff I don't eat. Coho Salmon, fresh water fish, mollusks, lamb. I ordered filet au poivre. Medium well. (You can keep your opinions about that to yourself.) Soup, salad, entree. Did I want my soup and salad with my entree? Ahhh...no. Soup, then salad then entree. Just like it says in the bible.\n\nI like to sit opposite the pass so that I can watch the show. I knew the Chef in this restaurant. He had been a customer of mine in the previous place he worked. He was out tonight. He had told me earlier in the day that he was going to his sister's wedding that weekend.\n\nMy filet comes out. It was a little charred. Not unusual with medium well. But at one point the grill had flared and it taken them a minute to get it under control. The filet was well/medium well about an inch or so around the edge, and then a bloody center. So I ate what I liked, plus everything else on the plate, and pushed it a way. The busser came to clear my plate. I knew him well, because he was the other half of the team that could manage the back half of the restaurant on their own. He looked at the plate, he looked at me, then he took the plate by itself up to the pass. The manager saw that and ran over. My server was there already. An animated discussion ensued. They pulled and inspected the ticket. I could see by the hand gestures the conversation was something along the lines of, it says medium well, it isn't medium well, why didn't you make it medium well. The chef threw up his hands and walked away.\n\nThe manager comes up to the table. Was there a problem with your meal? Now, the one thing I hate more than drama is bull shit, because bullshit causes me to want to make drama. I wanted to say, you knew what the issue was over there. Was you memory wiped while you walked the ten feet over here? But I didn't. No, I said, everything is fine. Is there anything I can do....she starts to ask. I hold up my hand and say yes, you can not do this. It takes her a second to get that. Then she starts to say, okay, well I'll just take the filet off... No, I say, just leave the check alone. Now I'm annoyed. She turns and goes to the POS and probably starts to take the filet off, but at this point my regular server sees whats going on, he sees that I am becoming angry, walks up to the manager, takes the ticket, pushes her out of the way and enters it under his number as it originally was. When he gets to the table, I am already holding out my card. He runs it, I add 20% and sign and we are on our way. I smile and say good evening to everyone on my way out.\n\nAs we were walking down the street, my friend says, why do I feel like you were a raging asshole in there? But you were never rude and you never raised your voice. Because I was a raging asshole. I made it quite clear that we all had a role to play in there, and I did everything I was supposed to do. I ordered my food, I ate what I wanted and I paid my tab. I was polite, I smiled, I looked everyone in the eye, I didn't complain, I didn't point any fingers, I didn't shame anyone. Any mistakes were made by not me. And everybody got paid. There’s something deeply unsatisfactory about that, isn’t there?",

I found that strange since I remembered spending hours picking it out and making sure it was the right one.\n\n  I looked through my online purchase history, and sure enough, I had ordered the right color.  And to make matters worse, I had ordered a locking exterior door knob, while this one does not lock and is intended for interior applications.  \n\nI hadn't really looked at it until now, maybe 5 months after purchase, because I bought a house and purchased a bunch of stuff for projects and just now got around to this.  \n\nOh well, I hope it doesn't rust.\n\nI'm worried about my dishwasher for the same reason: I purchased it when I bought the place but still haven't managed to hook it up because I have to convert a 240 and stuff.  But I'm eating through that warranty period.",
