        "text": "Hello AskAnthropology!\n\nI'm new to this sub, so let me know if this doesn't belong here. This is focused around archaeology and grad school, and sorry if it's a bit long.\n\nSo, I have recently heard back from a M.A. program I applied to, and the professor I would be working under asked me what my plans were for my PhD topic. Since the M.A. is only a one year program, he reminded me that I should be thinking about it. I had counted myself pretty clever on deciding on prehistoric metallurgic archaeology for my M.A., but he said I should be much more specific and find a culture and time period to specialize in for the PhD.\n\nNow, aside from the amazing difficulty I feel in picking a culture (It's like a candy shop, each one is amazing and awesome), I also realized that other than what I've read in some books, I really don't know a significant amount about any of them,  at least, I feel, not enough to approach them at a PhD level. (my undergrad was in the more general field of \"anthropology\" and I didn't have any archaeologist instructors)\n\n(TL,DR?)\nSo the heart of my question is: when going for a PhD in archaeology, are you expected to be already significantly well versed in the specific culture you're studying, or is learning about it a part of getting the PhD? Should I plan, after my M.A. to work under a researcher for a number of years before thinking about applying for a PhD? Or do I apply for a PhD right away, and learn as I go?\n\nThanks for any help!\n",

He wrote: \n&gt; It is one of those books that is either complete rubbish or a work of consummate genius, nothing in between! Probably the former, but I’m hedging my bets.\n\nSo, well intrigued, I bought a copy and devoured it. When I closed the last page I recalled the Dawkins quote. Man, this has to be proved. Scientifically. Did someone tried? \n\nHe was theorizing, basically, that for a loooong stretch of time (something like ten or twenty thousand years) humans live, build societies, invent things -without- being self-aware. There were no need of real consciousness. Then (according to [wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameralism_\\(psychology\\))): \n&gt; Jaynes theorized that a shift from bicameralism marked the beginning of introspection and consciousness as we know it today. According to Jaynes, this bicameral mentality began malfunctioning or “breaking down” during the second millennium BC. He speculates that primitive ancient societies tended to collapse periodically, (as in Egypt’s Intermediate Periods and the periodically vanishing cities of the Mayas) as changes in the environment strained the socio-cultural equilibria sustained by this bicameral mindset. The Bronze age collapse of the second millennium BC led to mass migrations and created a rash of unexpected situations and stresses that required ancient minds to become more flexible and creative. Self-awareness, or consciousness, was the culturally evolved solution to this problem. This necessity of communicating commonly observed phenomena among individuals who shared no common language or cultural upbringing encouraged those communities to become self-aware to survive in a new environment. Thus consciousness, like bicamerality, emerged as a neurological adaptation to social complexity in a changing world.\n\nBut that was his 1976 idea. How about today? What is the scientific community consessus on Bicameralism? ",

        "text": "Let me just start by stating that I have zero formal training in Anthropology and any false assumptions or mistakes I make are purely due to my own ignorance. That being out of the way, I got this idea a while back concerning the globalization of culture and some of the dying/endangered cultures out there. My thinking is that if the world keeps shrinking and homogenizing in the way it is now, then sooner or later there's going to be one prevailing dominant culture that almost every person on the planet will be a part of. It could be western culture, it could be Chinese culture, it could be Zulu culture, doesn't matter. Now I can see a few benefits to this phenomenon: Conflict resolution and international communication would probably be easier since everyone would have some set of values and beliefs that they shared with everyone else. However, this cultural \"flood\", as I call it, would likely render smaller more local cultures either suppressed or completely forgotten. This would eliminate much of the cultural diversity in the world \"gene pool\" so to speak. \n\nTo prevent this, my idea was to build a cultural ark in preparation for the \"flood\". A database consisting of information on every culture on earth. Now there are already many academic databases that try to do this sort of thing I know, but what would set the ark apart is that it would contain only enough information from each culture to effectively facilitate cultural immersion. Every cluster of information pertaining to a particular culture, weather it is that of a tribe or that of a whole nation, would constitute a \"seed\". Each seed would have as much information on that culture as is necessary so that if someone who is completely unversed in say the culture of a South Pacific islander for example were to be exposed to the seed of that particular South Pacific people, then by the end that person would understand what it means to live and work in that South Pacific community. The idea for the ark is that it would be a catalogue of indoctrination experiences rather than a research tool for academics. This way, I figure, any culture that exists now would still have its seed information left behind if it were ever to die out. It would be like that seed storage bunker that is up in the arctic which stores seeds in case of a world wide plant extinction event. And even if there is no \"flood\" and the world remains culturally diverse for the foreseeable future, this database could still be useful as a diplomatic tool. Wouldn't you be able to negotiate better with a country if you understood what the typical citizen there had to go through throughout life?\n\nSo now that that long-winded explanation is done, my question is whether or not anyone else has already thought of this. Does this project already exist? If so, I would very much appreciate being pointed in its direction. \n\nThank you.  ",

Our ancestors spent well over 99% of our species' evolutionary history living in huntergatherer\nsocieties. That means that our forebearers lived in small, nomadic bands of a few dozen individuals\nwho got all of their food each day by gathering plants or by hunting animals. Each of our ancestors was, in\neffect, on a camping trip that lasted an entire lifetime, and this way of life endured for most of the last 10\nmillion years.\nGeneration after generation, for 10 million years, natural selection slowly sculpted the human brain, favoring\ncircuitry that was good at solving the day-to-day problems of our hunter-gatherer ancestors -- problems like\nfinding mates, hunting animals, gathering plant foods, negotiating with friends, defending ourselves against\naggression, raising children, choosing a good habitat, and so on. Those whose circuits were better designed\nfor solving these problems left more children, and we are descended from them.\nOur species lived as hunter-gatherers 1000 times longer than as anything else.\"* (from 'Evolutionary Psychology: a Primer')\n\nHowever, I've googled the (probably very over-simplistic) question 'how long have humans being around' and have got many conflicting and varied answers. What exactly do Cosmides &amp; Tooby mean when they say that humans ('our species') were living as hunter-gatherers for 10 million years?\n\nI'm a philosophy student, not an anthropology student, so would appreciate simple terminology.

Geologically, slag is junk.\n\n[example 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/geology/comments/ddt2s/i_found_this_rock_metal_detecting_in_the_james/), [example 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/geology/comments/2ku5ky/lava_rock_meteorite/), [example 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/geology/comments/1phte1/anthropocene_igneous_sedimentary_formation_slag/)\n\nBut I wonder: from a Historians/anthopologist point of view, what can we learn from slag? When can we tell if it is a significant artifact and when can we tell it isn't? Are there descriptive or analytical approaches which allow to categorize slag and derive usefull information from it? If so what? Where to begin looking at slag as an information source? When some redditor shows me an obvious piece of slag, what should I look for?\n\nAlso: whatever you'd like to share/discuss about slag!",

I have checked google, and JSTOR and have yet to find any decent leads for anything beyond a broad mention of the topic.\n\nWould any of you happen to have any other databases or places to start?  My Uni has access to a wide variety of databases.  \n\nI'm also interested in the particular aspect of pain reduction in regards to the practices of their dentistry.  Did they take advantage of any pain reduction or were they drilling out teeth without?\n\nThanks!",

Of course, I don't know when we think language first developed, nor do I know if we have evidence for neanderthal language.\n\nI'm just curious if we have any evidence linking any amount of language to neanderthal and figured finno-ugric would be the most likely.\n\nWe know they were absorbed by modern humans, and we suspect they had language capabilities.  I see no reason to assume that their culture didn't influence future languages as it was being absorbed and we have a few languages that developed in the regions they were active.",
