I was tempted to go with /r/AskComputerScience, but wanted to reach the broader audience here.\n\nI have decided to study towards a degree and have narrowed it down to either Computer Science or Electrical Engineering, but I am strongly leaning towards the former.\n\nI am not able to attend a traditional university as I have a full time job that I'm not able to drop. Therefore, my best option would be distance learning at the OU.\n\nThere course is as follows:\n[http://www.open.ac.uk/courses/qualifications/q62](http://www.open.ac.uk/courses/qualifications/q62)\n\nNow, this isn't listed as a Computer Science degree, but an IT and Computing degree, with options of a CompSci or Software Development focus (within the Broad route, there are other routes to choose from, and I am tempted by the Software route).\n\nCan anyone vouch for the quality of this degree? I want to turn my career around and would love to work as a software developer (or in another IT role, but this would be my preference.)\n\nAs an aside from the degree, I am teaching myself Python and a mix of web development technologies.\n\nI would really appreciate any advice on this, including whether you think this is worthwhile, and if you think there's a route or focus listed on there that would likely be the best.",

In each cell, an organelle of choice has been stained by a protein. \n\nBasically, each image consists of 1-12 pixelated bright spots. There are 30 frames in each image - we took vertical slices of our cells to get a 3D picture (like a gif). I need to be able to isolate the organelles from the background noise. I already know how to extract the data I want, I’m just struggling to write code that can correctly identify the organelles, without getting confused by the diversity of the images (because their brightness, background noise, etc vary a lot)\n\nI thought I would find an algorithm that I can teach to correctly identify these bright spots. I’ve been trying to use Gaussian blurs, Otsu Thresholding, etc, but training an algorithm by feeding it sample images seems like it would give the most accurate data. \n\nI’d greatly appreciate any tips/resources/things to read on finding/creating an algorithm like this.

        "text": "Hello!\n\nIf you're reading this, you're most likely interested in learning about quantum computing; however, you might not be sure how to get started because of a lack of people to work with, lack of direction, and maybe even a lack of a bit of background knowledge.\n\nI've created a subreddit, /r/MikeAndIke, which will enable people with the desire to learn about quantum computing to come together and learn, generally directed (though not entirely restricted) by the book Quantum Computation and Quantum Information by Michael A. Nielsen and Isaac L. Chuang (hence the name, Mike &amp; Ike).\n\nI'm very new to reddit in general, and so I'm extremely new to running a subreddit. But, I hope that together we can make this a great learning experience for each other! Let me know if you have any questions or any other comments, feel free to spread the word to people you think may be interested, and I'll continue to look forward to your arrival! :D\n\n-Foobanana (the real one)\n\nP.S. - I've posted this a couple times, and so I leave it to the moderators to determine whether or not I'm spamming the sub, and to remove my post if they deem this to be the case! My only wish in doing so is to leave no one behind who wishes to learn with us in our community!\n",

        "author": "gomboloid",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/8quclm/attention_machines_is_this_a_branch_of_complexity/",
        "text": "This started with me telling my wife \"I need my full attention on the road here\", and then the internal contrarian asking me how true this was. \n\nI started asking myself how you'd go about measuring \"fraction of attention\" needed to model an object in real time, and came up with a little theoretical space  that feels quite rich. It seems to me like this space must be some part of complexity theory that i've never heard of, because it seems both interesting and applicable.\n\nThe idea here is that we could have a little branch of computational complexity theory that deals with models that reflect a changing reality.  I feel like this has to exist, but I haven't been in academia for years. \n\nTypical complexity theory considers machines that inspect strings and make determinations: is this string in that language or not? Suppose we model \"reality\" using a string over some alphabet, with each consecutive character being the state of \"reality\" at a point in time.   Then we can consider state machines machines as  \"things that observe a reality that changes its state over time.\"\n\nThe key difference between this idea and the typical complexity theory is that, unlike a state machine or a turing machine, these  models can't see all of reality, only part of it.  I call these models  \"attention machines\". \n\nFinite state automata are special cases of attention machines, that have the ability to see all of reality.  Here are the definitions:\n\nAn \"n-dimensional reality over alphabet sigma\" is a function from the natural numbers to length-n strings over sigma.\n\nThe idea here is that we model reality as \"some state that changes over time, driven by an arbitrary function\". The natural numbers represent time; at t(0) there's some string, a different string at t(1), a different one at t(2).\n\nWe can then talk about \"attention machines\" which react to a reality function by modifying their internal state.  A regular expression becomes a simple case here, of a system that reacts to a 1-dimensional reality function.\n\nInstead of laying the string out in \"space\" and then running the machine over it \"in space\",  the attention machine approach is to think of the string being laid out out in time. Each string over an alphabet corresponds to a single  1-dimensional reality function in that alphabet.\n\nFor example, we can convert the string \"cats\" into the reality function\n\n0-&gt;c\n\n1-&gt;a\n\n2-&gt;t\n\n3-&gt;s\n\nWe could talk about machines that react to changes in 'reality', over time, and thus compute some aspect of 'reality.'  The word \"reality\" here might be problematic, but I don't know what else to call \"The thing which is being observed by the attention machine\". \n\nThis case isn't super interesting. It's just regular expressions.  We don't have a notion of 'time' when dealing with regular expressions, except to maybe say that they are worst case O(n). The attention machine idea comes out of this because \n\n* the state machine can \"see\" all of reality, but most computer systems cannot see all of the system they are observing\n\n* the state machine can update itself just as fast as reality changes, whereas most computer systems have limits on how rapidly they can modify their internal states.   \n\n\nWhat happens if we have some system with a finite number of  internal states, that's trying to model some portion of a larger system which changes  \n* faster than the smaller system can keep up with, and \n*in ways that the smaller system can't see.\n\n Can we talk about limits or bounds on how accurate the Attention Machine's model can be?\n\nLet's say we have a two-dimensional reality function over [0-9], which means at each time t, the state of reality is given by a single two-digit number. \n\nLet's say as well that we have a state machine, but the state machine reads, as input, only *one* of the characters of the state of reality.  This is where we diverge from everything I remember about complexity theory.\n\nIf we give 'reality' as a changing, two-character string, and we have the attention machine ( our 'computer') being able to only observe, each time frame, one character.  The clock ticks, reality changes according to the reality function, and the state machine updates again.   We'll ignore the idea that the machine might update slower than reality, becuase just the first part alone (not seeing all of reailty) introduces a bunch of neat stuff.\n\nLet's say we could have the states of the state machine encode &lt;em&gt;which&lt;/em&gt; bit of reality the state machine will be reading from. We specify the finite state machine as usual, with one extra piece of data per state: the dimension of the reality function that is used as the next input to the state machine. In the case of traditional FSM's, this last piece of data is always '0', as the traditional FSM looks only  at one dimensional reality functions (i.e. they consider exactly on character at a time of a string.)\n\nCan we prove anything about how the limits of this kind of machine? \n\n\"Recognizing a language\" with a finite state machine means  you get to see the whole shebang before making a decision. In attention machine terms, we can call recognizing a language \"recognizing a reality function\" . What if you get to see exactly &lt;em&gt;half&lt;/em&gt; of the input before making a decision? You get to choose which bits you see, and you know that other bits are passing by, which you'll never see. What kind of limits does that impose on you?\n\nIn our case, if the alphabet is 0-9 and we are dealing with two dimensions, i do not think we could build a state machine in this environment that was capable of recognizing sequences of incrementing integers. For example, the Attention machine might be looking at the ones digit, when the ten's digit decrements. The attention machine can't distinguish between that situation, and one where it's looking at the one's digit, and the ten's digit increments. \n\nSo a two-dimensional attention machine of machine can't possibly determine 2-dimensional reality function \"sequences of increasing integers\"\n\nWhat CAN it determine?\n\n* Sequences that contain no odd numbers\n* Sequences that contain no multiples of 10\n* Seqences where all values are less than 30 (but it cannot determine \"sequences where all values are less then 42!)\n* Sequences where even values greater than 10 are always followed by an odd number\n\nThese seem contrived, i'm not sure there's any utility in saying these things specifically. There does seem to be some structure in here worth exploring, though.\n\nHow much lookback do they have? Adding more states does seem to buy you more lookback history here. For example, if I want to recognize a reality function \"All multiples of 5 are followed by at least 30 numbers ending in the digit 3\", I could do this with ~30 states. \n\nWhat about \"all multiples of 5 are followed by at least 30 numbers divisible by 3?\"\n\nI don't think a 2-dimensional attention machine can solve this problem, because the numbers that are divisible by both five and three would require much more internal state than the attention machine has access to.. The word 'context' feels natural to use here -the attention machine can't store enough context internally to differentiate between \"i saw a five, 29 3's, and then 40\", vs.  \"I saw a five,  29 3's, and then 30\",  vs.  \"I saw a five, 30 3's, and then 30\", \n\nThe key idea is that \"regular old FSM's\" fall into this naturally as \"Attention machines operating on 1-dimensional reality functions\". \n\nWe could get even crazier with this and ask \"what if there are 5 dimensions to the reality function and the attention machine can read two dimension sat a time\"\n\nIn addition to asking \"which reality functions can be recognized?\", we could also ask questions about modelling  a reality function. Say we have a 5-dimensional reality function over the alphabet of 3-digit integers. We might be representing 5 stocks whose values are changing over time.  Suppose we want our computer to be computing the average value  of these five stocks - if the stocks change faster than the state of the computer, can we place guarantees on the accuracy of the computed average?\n\nWe can add on restrictions to \"how fast the machine can update its internal state\", by having the reality function changing faster than the machine can update.  \n\nWe could also talk about restricting the reality function as well: if it's a random function, then the only guarantees an attention machine could provide would be that the most recently measured character would be accurately reflected.  What happens when you add on guarantees about  the reality function - say, that lower dimensions change very slowly, and higher dimensions can change more rapidly? These restrictions both reflect reality (plate tectonics move slowly, but the local electromagnetic field changes very fast). These restrictions also add interesting tradeoffs in choices and techniques. Perhaps you ignore the rapidly changing higher dimensions (because any accuracy is short lived), focus some attention on the slower-changing dimensions (don't need to visit here too often because these things rarely change), and keep most of your focus on the middle bits, which you can track but also change rapidly.\n\nYou could also chain attention machines together, modeling a computer as one fast, small attention machine (The registers)  being modeled by a separate, slower attention machine (the RAM),  which is then further modeled by an even larger, slower attention machine (the hard drive).  You might  inquiring about accuracy limits and throughput.\n\n\nWith a little extra work, from here we can also talk about Turing machines as being attention machines operating infinite-dimensional reality functions. We'd need to  impose restrictions on the structure of the reality function: it can only change in the part under the tape head of the Turing machine.\n\nDoes this thing already exist? Or am I just totally out to lunch here?\n\n",

        "text": "So I have read that many programmers prefer MacOS because of the Unix command line. I have read on this a little but I am unfortunately nowhere closer to understanding what does this mean.\n\nFrom what I have seen on another reddit post, I understand that Unix is not so much of a OS, but rather a standard. And the fact that OSX has met this standard means that it can call itself a UNIX certified OS (correct me if I'm wrong). But what exactly is this UNIX support good for? For instance, is it better for debugging? Is there a Unix OS that you can program for on OSX, but not Windows?\n\nPlease shed some light on this thanks. Any explanation would be most welcome.",

I've finished \\*most\\* of the leetcode problems (albeit dodgily)\n\nI've heard the top hackerank problems are olympiad level. Is there anywhere else I can improve my coding game? I know some courses at my uni give you 3 questions to do in 4 days and most people dont get past the first one (for one notoriously hard subject). The best advice ive been given is to do the top hackerank problems.  \n\n\n**Any other resources you would recommend for HARD problems (aside to the mainsteam code competition style websites)?**  \nAlso have completed 1 full year of mathematics study at uni. Not much but still going. Starting real analysis soon. I'll begin reading big code repos as well!",

I know that Linus Torvalds created linux from scratch (inspired from unix) and licence it under GPL and that's how we have So large open source Linux community. But what about FreeBSD? What about FreeDOS? How they are different from proprietary BSD and MS DOS.
