UNCENSORED talks about my own experiences and struggles, from a difficult early childhood filled with pain, uncertainty, and conflict to the struggles of code-switching between my home in a rough neighborhood and my elite private school.

I’m Allen Ling. I am a physical therapist in the Bay Area but I had a passion for comics that eventually drove me to create my own graphic novel, Genesis 2 (https://genesisiicomics.com/).\n\nI partnered with an amazing artist, Christian Boe, who illustrated most of the story and we got placed in Comic Con, booth 835! I wanted to do this AMA because I’ve been touched by the overwhelming amount of support I’ve received from the various artistic communities such as r/comics, r/graphicnovels, r/sculptures, and r/comiccon just to name a few.\n\nI’m currently setting up at Comic Con this week and I figured while I have the time, I’ll answer questions from interested people. So please, ask away!!!\n\nP.S. I have some of my friends helping me out as they are fielding some questions but I will be answering them from 3 - 6 today and 3 - 5:30 tomorrow.\n\nProof: https://imgur.com/a/QoJa1bz, https://imgur.com/a/bcs1qGW\n\nEDIT: Thank you everybody for the questions, I had so much fun talking with you all! If you're attending SDCC I hope you'll drop by the booth and say hi, and if you want to check out Genesis II the first chapter is available for free download here: https://genesisiicomics.com/\n\nI'd love to do this again some time Reddit, thanks for making it a great experience!",

Got started in the game creeping the internet for how to (legally) scam into Presidential Suites as a broke student with bad credit. These days I find a lot of the content reposted around the travel hacking scene. I also stay on these rates. I regularly stay at $5-10/night rooms around the country that are hotel mistake rates. That kind of thing.\n\nAsk me anything but I probably know the most about topics such as staying on hotel mistake rates, reactions from hotels, finding deals, breaking into the subculture, how to get free compensation from hotel chains without being an asshole, helpful blogs vs. bs marketers.\n\n**Proof** [http://extremehoteldeals.com](http://extremehoteldeals.com) Recent [$6 a night Hyatt deal](https://twitter.com/JonathanChen77/status/1002631528642465793/photo/1) that was honored for hundreds of people.\n\nUpdate: Thanks to everyone who commented.

Making enemies with our southern neighbors and erecting walls between us is counterproductive, insulting and foolish. I am the candidate on Texas' ballot this November that will **oppose the embarrassing behavior of Donald Trump** and his absurd attacks on immigrants and building of walls. We must honor the principle of **individual liberty**.\n\nI have a background in **law, business, project development and project management**. I have a **Bachelors of Law** and a **Masters in Administration from San Luis Potosi, Mexico**. Over the past 30 years, I have established, developed and operated several companies, including a **HydroElectric Plant in Belize**, **Central America and a Law Firm in Monterrey, Mexico**. Throughout my career I have effectively communicated and successfully partnered with many private, and government entities, including: legal, engineering, environmental, electric and water commissions, natural resource departments, lands departments, road and bridge departments as well as municipalities and villages. In the legal field, I have been successful in negotiating international grants, concessions, land leases, water rights, contracts, as well as litigating numerous cases.\n\nMy wife, Jeri, is an **educator** at Harbor Leadership Academy in Leander, Texas.

Soy **Asesor Jurídico y Comercial Internacional** para empresas y particulares que poseen propiedades y/o negocios en **México y Latinoamérica**. Hacer enemigos de nuestros vecinos al sur, y construir muros entre nosotros, es contraproducente, insultante y ridículo.

        "text": "Hi! I went from \"nothing is wrong with me, I'm a healthy 30 year old woman, I'm just kind of constipated and tired of it, I think I'll go to a GI doc and see what's up\" to surgery that used a six inch incision down the direct center of my abdomen to remove an adrenaline producing tumor IN JUST THREE WEEKS TIME. \n\nSo...\n\nI had a colonoscopy done on a Monday in late-April. The doctor saw that something was pushing in on my colon from outside of it, and she advised me to go get an MRI. I had the MRI done on the following Saturday. Three days later - Tuesday - I was told that the MRI revealed I had a 5 cm tumor, about the size of a lime, growing off of what they believed was my small intestine. Three weeks later, I had open surgery to remove the tumor. \n\nThe surgeon tried to go in laparoscopically, but could not find the tumor. He opened my abdomen up with a six inch incision, and found that the tumor was actually growing off of my right adrenal glad. He successfully removed the tumor, along with 1/4 of the gland. I was in the hospital for 5 days, and had a pretty hellish recovery. Two weeks post-op, I was informed that the pathology results concluded that the tumor was a pheochromocytoma, a tumor so rare it occurs in only about 2 out of every 1 million people. I was also told that this tumor is extremely dangerous to remove, and I'm unbelievably lucky that I did not have a stroke on the operating table (usually they put people on meds prior to surgery, and have a special anesthesiologist intensely monitoring the patient throughout). Pheochromocytomas produce massive amounts of adrenaline and are often referred to as \"ticking time bombs\" because they can cause heart attacks and strokes purely from the incredible amount of adrenaline they cause to rush through one's body. \n\nI did not have high blood pressure prior to the surgery, which is usually the #1 symptom of a pheochromocytoma. I did, however, have myriad other symptoms for many years that doctors consistently dismissed as \"symptoms of anxiety,\" regardless of how often I sought medical evaluation for these symptoms and how adamant I was that they were not anxiety related. ALL of these symptoms have gone away since removal of the tumor. The biggest symptoms were: Frequent urination - about every 30 minutes during the day and about every hour at night (yes, this made my quality of sleep horrible); sweating attacks where I would instantly start pouring sweat regardless of the temperature; attacks of an inability to fully catch my breath that would last about 10 minutes at a time; constipation that got progressively worse over time, to the point where I was eventually only pooping every 6-10 days; unmanageable obsession with my own mortality/death (a \"sense of doom\" is associated with this type of tumor); among other lesser symptoms. \n\nI am now about 7 weeks post-op. My incision is healing well, though it remains painful and I am still limited in my physical ability. I'm going in for genetic testing in early-August, to find out if I have a gene that caused development of this tumor. \n\n**My Proof:** https://imgur.com/a/eRHz0xA",

Barcroft TV saw the last IAMA post I did and since it had over 13,000 upvotes they decided to make a small documentary on me. I wanted to say thank you to everyone who upvoted my post and made this mini-documentary possible. I hope that it helps many child abuse and sexual assault survivors. Here is the video  Barcroft TV made about me. [Why I Ran Away From The Amish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LK0N_Oa8sU)\n\nMy Story:\n\nWhen I was six years old my stepfather forced my family to start living and dressing like the Amish. For the next 12 years, my sister and I were held in isolation and severely abused. When I was 18 I tried to escape and that is when my stepfather took my sister and me to an Amish community. Three years later I reported the bishop of my church for sexual assault. They told me I did not have enough evidence and he was not arrested at the time but 2 years after I published my [memoir](https://www.amazon.com/Tears-Silenced-American-Tragedy-Leaving-ebook/dp/B00RETC8B4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8) (self-published until September when the publisher releases a newly edited version) he was arrested and sent to prison for molesting almost all of his 11 children.\n\nThrough an email, I put in the back of my memoir I have been able to help thousands of sexual assault and child abuse victims including some who are still Amish. \n\nSexual abuse among the Amish is a serious problem and sexual assault victims among the Amish and other ultra strict religions need help. Since my last IAMA, I have worked with an Amish woman ( who has since left the Amish) to try and report sexual abuse cases in her community. The police were called but they did not even respond. In that community and many others, there is an agreement that when the police are called they go to the bishop or designated elder and discuss it with him. This is very serious and discourages Amish assault victims from coming forward. \n\nAgain, a great big thank you to everyone who participated in my last AMA and helped me raise a lot of awareness on this subject. It has also led to other opportunities to help abuse victims. Ask me anything!\n\n[Proof](https://twitter.com/ExAmish101/status/1018898193042399232)\n\nMini-documentary Barcroft TV made about me  [Why I Ran Away From The Amish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LK0N_Oa8sU)",
