I wonder how would it handle different opinions between them. Would one dominate? Would different ones dominate on different subjects? Probably MxKenna knows more about drugs, but Jung might know more about the human psyche. With Internet access how would they all change, evolve ever time? A singular guru entity?\n\nAlso, I would have Frank Herbert for writing the real ending of Dune, perhaps even a personalised version for me. And even several different ones, until I will have had enough. Preferably in the form of slightly interactive VR movies. I would be a random Fremen just hanging around. Text is so 20th century :)",
