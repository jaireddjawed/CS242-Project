        "text": "*I apologize if someone has posted something like this before -- I'm sure I'm not the first one to explore this topic.*\n\nReddit's upvote/downvote system has long been criticized for how it stifles discussions and creates echo chambers within communities. It's easy enough to see how they emerge -- any community centered around 'good content' rising and 'bad content' being hidden is sure to prevent certain topics from receiving as much traction as they might deserve and for certain tropes to become played out. Still, many Redditors choose to read and vote on long comment threads all the way into the downvoted oblivions, and we need to ask some fundamental questions about how these \"bystanders\" react to the content before them (\"bystanders\" is defined here as Redditors who read and vote on comments without being involved in the discussion themselves):\n\n* How do the visible scores affect one's perception of the content they're reading? \n* Does the perception of popular opinion create a sense of legitimacy surrounding a comment?\n* Do bystanders hold more influence over content perception than content creators?\n* Do bystanders create 'vicious cycles'?\n* How does one go about solving these problems? \n* Do these problems even have solutions?\n* Are these even problems?\n\n----\n\nThere's [a well-known experiment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOucwX7Z1HU) involving a jar of jelly beans that's made its way in the collective consciousness. The gist of it is that if you had a jar filled with some really large number of jelly beans--a number too big to easily approximate with a quick glance--and took guesses from a very large sample size, the guesses themselves will be all over the place, with most being very inaccurate, but the mean of all the guesses would be surprisingly close to the actual amount. In the linked video, the actual number of beans is 4,510, with the mean of all the guesses being about 4,515--this, despite the guesses ranging from 400 to 50,000, with only a few of the guesses actually being anywhere close. Pretty crazy.\n\nAn oral history of this experiment is often the prelude to some speech about 'the wisdom of crowds', with the intention of teaching you a counter-intuitive lesson: a person is dumb, but people are smart.\n\nOn the surface, that assertion seems quite backwards. Anyone who's ever been in a crowd would tell you that a mob of people is very stupid; it functions like a collective organism that merely reacts, rather than one that can organize or plan. There's no higher reasoning in a crowd. If there's ever a sense of organization, it's usually in pursuit of a predetermined goal, like a planned rally... or a lynching. But the results of this experiment would suggest there's a clear difference between 'herd mentality' and the kind of collective wisdom that results from averaging the thoughts from independent subjects. This is how we rationalize a simultaneous belief in the wisdom and stupidity of crowds.\n\nBut let's put aside the experiment (which I consider dubious) and its conclusions; instead, let's first recognize that most people, regardless of whether they're familiar with the experiment, believe the conclusion to some degree -- *argumentum ad populum* is a subconscious fallacy that all of us are guilty of at least once in a while. \n\nNext, let's recognize a critical point when arguing for crowd wisdom: [it only works when guesses are independent.](http://www.pnas.org/content/108/22/9020.full) That is, when someone tries to throw their guess into the mix, they're not supposed to know the current average. The only reason the experiment (supposedly) works is because every individual has their own prejudices that manifest in systematic error through their guesses, with a higher quantity of guesses resulting in a greater degree of error negation. *Paradoxically, the wisdom comes from error.* If we brought in a separate group of jelly bean guessers and told them the previous group's average beforehand, we'd find their guesses would be less disparate than the first group's. If we repeated this with further groups, each time informing them of the previous group's average, we'd find the guesses would increasingly converge--proof that the systemic error is being phased out.\n\nSo the crowd wisdom disappears -- does mob mentality remain?\n\n---\n\nKeeping all of the above in mind, consider Reddit's upvote and downvote system once more. Every post and comment is made visible or hidden through an embedded voting system that raises and lowers content based on its net score, *which is visible*. In theory, this is meant to facilitate crowd-sourced content sorting, with approval and disapproval separating the quality content from the average and bad content. In practice, it becomes the ultimate dupe, a converging system masquerading as true crowd wisdom. The dangers this poses are simultaneously minute and of massive importance.\n\nThe bystander looks at the comment thread and sees scores of every comment in the chain and makes certain assumptions, the most important of which is that they, to some extent, accept the idea that something with more upvotes is more correct, or at least has more legitimacy. We base this off the 'wisdom of crowds' idea -- if thousands of people saw and voted on this comment, the end result must be pretty close to the objective truth. The funny thing is that this might have at least some merit were it not for the comment scores being visible. What the bystander is seeing isn't a 'jelly bean guess', where every 'guess' is independent and errors negate other errors. Rather, they're seeing 'guesses' converge in real time, because every new guess is influenced by the current score. In other words, the problem isn't that the content is being misjudged -- the problem is that the bystanders become confident about this misjudgement because they falsely believe there's a consensus.\n\nSo when we talk about echo chambers and certain discussion topics or viewpoints inevitably getting buried, we should try placing it in this context to get an idea of just how dangerous this phenomenon actually is. Someone who is entirely uninformed about some issue -- like, say, modern art -- could read Reddit comment threads and assign certain amounts of legitimacy to opinions based on their scores. They might very well conclude, or at least subconsciously accept, the idea that modern art is a pretentious money laundering scheme. On its own, this is a pretty bold claim, but when it receives more upvotes than its parent comment in multiple instances within a thread, it might at least open your mind to the possibility that it's more than a fringe theory. Regardless of your own views on modern art -- I just used that thread because it's a memorable recent example -- at least concede that such a strong opinion seems to carry more validity when it's backed up by upvotes. (Also keep in mind that most Redditors aren't aware of meta trends, such as the tendency for modern art dismissal to be its own kind of echo chamber.) \n\n---\n\nI think we can now attempt to answer the questions posed earlier. 'Attempt' being the key word.\n\n* _How do the visible scores affect one's perception of the content they're reading?_\n\nAs I've already said, scores likely influence whether you perceive a comment as being right or wrong. This probably doesn't apply in cases where you know for a fact that a comment is entirely right or wrong, but most comments that aren't outright opinions are right or wrong in various degrees, and this is where a comment score can nudge your perception ever so slightly.\n\n* _Does the perception of popular opinion create a sense of legitimacy surrounding a comment?_\n\nIt often does, with some caveats. We're assuming that bystanders view comment threads as being sort of mini-communities that are voted on by the same people all the way down a chain. Thus, when we see a comment get more upvotes than its parent comment, we assume it must be better because everyone who upvoted the child comment saw the parent comment, yet the child received more upvotes. Something we haven't talked about is the effect of gilding a comment - gold is often seen as a kind of 'super upvote'. We'll generally see the gold symbol before we read a word of the comment, so we'll read the comment already influenced by the knowledge that we're about to read something so good that someone spent money to reward it. This, combined with a comment score, can pique your interest and make you read a comment in a more positive light, especially if the comment deals with some issue that you have no familiarity with. Any sense of 'legitimacy' that comes from a comment score is amplified by the ignorance of the bystander.\n\n* _Do bystanders hold more influence over content perception than content creators?_\n\nProbably not for actual submissions, since submissions are initially voted on with scores hidden (at least until you go into the comments to see the current score). But for content in comments sections, it might very well be the case that the 'crowd wisdom' which has marked your comment as good or bad relative to those around it is probably going to stick around, no matter how much you edit your comment or reply later on down the chain.\n\n* _Do bystanders create 'vicious cycles'?_\n\nWell, that's basically the whole issue, now that we've broken it down. Upvotes beget upvotes, downvotes beget downvotes - the only question is whether you or someone else will be able to stop the cycle through a well-received reply. That might be nothing more than a matter of timing and making the reply look spiffy enough to get attention - **bolding words does the trick.**\n\n* _How does one go about solving these problems?_\n\nThe obvious solution, which we already see on /r/TheoryOfReddit, along with other subs, is to hide comment scores for some period of time - usually 6 hours. To some extent, this does solve the problem, yet when the vote totals are revealed after the set length in time, it often seems to follow similar patterns to what we see in subs that don't hide their vote totals - although the numbers themselves are usually lower than what you'd expect if the numbers were never hidden. I would say part of this behavior is based on both comment position and mental guesswork. If a comment is higher up, whether it's a top-level comment or a reply, we don't need to see the vote totals to know that it's a more popular opinion. And since we're so familiar with patterns of comment scores and comment chains, we can often guess which comments received high scores and which ones received low scores. *The expectation has already influenced and violated our way of reading \"pure\" content.* Not a complete solution -- it just puts a barrier between the problem and the result.\n\n* _Do these problems even have solutions?_\n\nShort of creating a pure time-based bulletin board along the lines of 4chan, I think Reddit's comment layout is inherently susceptible to this sort of problem and will never be entirely free of it. The only way to even remove the expectation of scores (and thus false consensuses) is to scrap upvotes and visible gildings from comments entirely. Can you do that and still create a filter that rewards good content and punishes bad content? Perhaps, but then it can't be crowd-sourced. And if that's what Reddit's goal is, then there's no getting around this groupthink pitfall.\n\nUltimately, Reddit would have to entirely rethink their values if they chose to redesign their comment system, and I'm not sure which values the site creators desire and whether it conflicts with the values the users desire. The current system values **democracy**, for all its imperfections. The 4chan system values **authenticity**, because the users aren't motivated by a voting system to fall in line with site-friendly opinions. /r9k/, a 4chan board where all text posts are logged and can never be repeated, values **originality** because it's enforced through a bot that gives short, automatic bans. I'm sure there are ways one could design a forum that promotes some other value above all others -- **kindness**, **intelligence**, **fairness**, **responsibility**, etc. If you don't think these values are as important as democracy, you're probably stuck with what we have, more or less. There are problems inherent to every value prioritization. Forums can only hope to juggle them as effectively as possible.\n\n* _Are these even problems?_\n\nMaybe not! Perhaps this is a sign of a flourishing internet democracy, still trying to work out its kinks. Maybe it's a microcosm of all democratic societies and their best-case-scenarios. Maybe it's a 'problem' that's just inherent to humanity and can never truly be eliminated, so our best approach is to just roll with it, no matter what form it takes. Ultimately, I would say crowd wisdom, for all its flaws, still pretty much accomplishes what it's supposed to do. Rarely do I enter a thread and feel like I haven't read a single worthwhile post, and rarely do I feel that the submissions that make the front page of the subs I frequent are devoid of merit. So at the very least, crowd wisdom is quite a step above reading every comment and looking at every submission. It keeps me entertained. It also provides perspective by reflecting the interests of the community -- if you can read between the lines, comment scores can quickly tell you how much tolerance a community has for stuff you're not interested in, which might be the only barometer you need to ensure you (mostly) enjoy your Reddit experience. But always keep in mind the pervasive influence of the herd, and try to think independently when evaluating new ideas. Redditors are often wrong, even when Reddit seems right.",

In order for a subreddit to be nonspecific in its political content one must accept the inevitable organic biases which will develop- if we want to maintain some sort of 'level playing field' by heavy moderation one quickly becomes 'biased to the unbiased', we may crate a fairer supplier of news for those who click links and rely on such a sub for content- but we would destroy the point of such a subreddit, to allow for all kinds of discussion- and if such a bias arises out of that then so be it- providing moderators don't start getting rid of any anti-Bernie or pro anyone else posts then it is how it should work- we cannot expect the sub to be completely neutral because communities aren't neutral, they develop opinions and ideas through debate- and yes it may become a bit of a hivemind (which to me is a separate and far larger issue) but if that is how it develops then that is how it develops- we are not stopping a large influx of, say, trump supporters to counter the wave and such a thing could be welcome as that is the nature of such a sub- it is supposed to be organic, constantly developing and non-anchored, as soon as we start trying to create a level playing field one does not end up with a community but instead a news source- something which the sub is only in secondary terms. Yes we may cry that it is ignorant of his weaknesses or biased against Hillary, but are we to expect a fair and balanced discussion through user generated content? Yes we will end up with subjectivity and ignorance, but by doing so we also allow for freedom of community, to have the power to create perspectives and shape views. ",

I talk about it in this short video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnSNvadQo0&amp;feature=youtu.be\n\n\nThe thing that got me thinking about this was the post on InternetIsBeautiful showing that pretty much *all* political posts are in support of Bernie Sanders. Even with Reddit's liberal crowd, it seems like there should be at least *some* minority opinions. My theory is that people don't post minority opinions because of social pressure, not wanting to get down voted. Because of this, often just one angle/opinion on a topic will get posted.\n\n\nLet me know what you think!",

In fact, Google gives you 1TB of free queries each month.  \n\nAll you need to get started is to visit https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/, log in if you aren't already, and create a project if you don't have one already.\n\n**Disclaimer:**  I do not work for Google -- but use BigQuery a lot.  You can visit /r/bigquery for more information on BigQuery.  User /u/fhoffa is on the BQ team and does an excellent job answering complicated questions.  \n\nLet's just dive into the first edition of many more to come on how to use BigQuery to pull interesting results out of all this Reddit data.  Below is a SQL query that looks for 2-3 n-gram words that are capitalized (usually proper nouns).

        "text": "Every so often, I see these sort of backhanded comments coming from European Redditors directed at American Redditors that imply some sense of superiority.  It's not inherently racist or mean-spirited, but I feel like there's a deeper meaning behind these types of comments.\n\nYou ever have one of those neighbors that always tells you things that you \"ought to do\" whenever they make contact with you?  That's the closest comparison I can make.  The neighbors in question are pretty innocent and don't mean any malice behind their words, but you just *know* that somewhere in the back of their heads they're thinking they're better than you.  That's the phenomenon I keep seeing.  It occurs when discussing major political issues to even the most trivial matters.\n\nFor example, [this recent video from SNL that deals with race](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/45q260/the_day_beyonc%C3%A9_turned_black_snl/).  Check out the comments.  There are a lot of European Redditors being every so slightly smug about how corrupt and racist America is (as if there aren't any problems over there).  You'll also notice lots of American Redditors rebuttling the comments as well, so I know at least some people take offense to them.\n\nAnother example that I unfortunately can't find is something incredibly trivial:  coffee.  I can't remember what sub or post it was, but there was a discussion about the way people drink their coffee.  Apparently in some European countries, most people stop by cafes every morning for their daily fix.  They see their morning coffee as a time to socialize and relax rather than just a drink.  This is obviously quit the opposite of the \"American\" way, which mainly consists of a K-Cup and a thermos.  I saw several comments that again, sort of implied that the \"European\" way was somehow superior.  One person even told a story about how their husband wanted a thermos because they were in a rush, to which the commentor told them \"we don't have a thermos!  This isn't America!\" as if the situation was comical.\n\nAgain, maybe I'm just going crazy and remembering the bad stuff over the good stuff.  But I certainly feel like the thread I linked to provides some evidence to what I'm saying.  It's definitely not all Europeans.  But I feel like a vocal minority has some sort of odd superiority.",

        "text": "The reputation of /r/politics is well known. It's widely considered a *de facto* extension of /r/SandersForPresident, since at any given time the top page is filled to the brim with posts proclaiming the political revolution Bernie Sanders has sparked, how inevitable Hillary Clinton's defeat is, and how everyone will get a free PS4 when Bernie is elected. [\\(Example from today\\)](http://imgur.com/mbK0tYs) The reason for this isn't difficult to discern; Reddit's demographics are dominated by college-aged whites, who are overwhelmingly pro-Sanders and anti-Clinton. This translates into upvotes for posts praising Bernie Sanders and downvotes for posts questioning him or praising Clinton, despite the official rule for upvotes and downvotes nobody ever follows. \n\nThe state of /r/politics is deplorable, and it needs to be fixed. I'm a Sanders supporter, and even I had to unsubscribe because the deluge of posts from Salon or Huffington Post sucking Bernie's dick got *really* tiresome after a while. [As I pointed out in the subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/43urc4/theyre_all_bought_and_sold_american_democracy/czlb6up), /r/politics is supposed to be a subreddit for news, not a 24/7 Sanders rally. /r/SandersForPresident exists for that purpose, and the American politics subreddit should not take the side of a candidate or allow their top page to be flooded with worship of him.\n\nTo that end, I am proposing something called **trend moderating**. Basically, anytime the moderators of a subreddit notice that a certain view or attitude is overwhelming links and discussions, in such a way that is distorting the subreddit's purpose, they should take more active steps to remove those links and restore balance to the subreddit. In the case of /r/politics, here are a few options:\n\n**1. Domain banning/approval needed:** The simplest way to fix the problem of /r/politics. Links from certain websites would either be automatically removed or require approval before being submitted. Were I a moderator, I would ban links to the following sites via automoderator (and redirect the poster to /r/SandersForPresident):\n\nwww.salon.com\n\nwww.motherjones.com\n\nwww.huffingtonpost.com\n\nA few others, like MSNBC or Rolling Stone, should require moderator approval before posting. If someone posts a link from one of those sites, their link would be removed and the following message would appear:\n\n&gt; Thanks for your submission! Unfortunately, it has been removed due to being on our list of banned domains. The website you linked to is known to be heavily biased for or against a current political figure, and removing links to it is necessary to maintain a neutral point of view in /r/politics. Consider re-submitting your link in /r/progressive or /r/SandersForPresident. \n\n**2. Manual removal of heavily pro-Sanders links:** This would require more time and would be more inefficient, but could be used in conjunction with #1. Every time the front page of /r/politics is flooded with articles about Sanders, mods could remove all but one or two, as well as all editorials. Bringing to #3...\n\n**3. A moratorium on pro-Sanders editorials.** As it says on the tin, any piece written by an author who is heavily supporting Bernie Sanders could be either removed or confined to a stickied thread. \n\nSo there you have it! Now, here are a few counter-arguments I'd like to preemptively address:\n\n**1. It's anti-free speech!** Subreddit aren't democracies; they're semi-authoritarian dictatorships with occasional democratic input. Moderators in nearly every subreddit have rules about what self posts or links are and aren't allowed, and remove those that violate the rules. If you wish, there would be nothing stopping you from creating your own /r/AllHailSanders subreddit. \n\n**2. You're biased against Sanders!** No, I am a Sanders supporter. These steps are necessary because /r/politics has become so overwhelmingly, insanely biased in favor of Bernie Sanders that dramatic action is necessary to restore a neutral point of view. /r/SandersForPresident exists for a reason; it's an explicitly pro-Sanders subreddit, and /r/politics is nominally for political discussion. Allowing the current state of affairs continue goes against the intended purpose of the subreddit.\n\nSo there you have it, my proposal to turn /r/politics from a 24/7 Sanders rally into something a bit more controlled and accurate to its nominal purpose.

        "text": "I'm currently doing a content analysis of YikYak at the university at which I work, and while I have found the much-talked-about hate speech one expects to find in anonymous communities, I also found a really long, sophisticated debate about the ethics of abortion (it touched on the burden on single mothers, laws about child support, the responsibility placed on taxpayers, the fact that correlation does not equal causation). Part of what allows robust discussions on sensitive topics is anonymity: users don't have to worry about the things they say being used against them in totally different contexts for the rest of their lives. So it is with other anonymous communities, like Reddit. \n\nBut there's an important point of difference between Reddit and YikYak. Reddit allows for the creation of sub-communities, and these sub-communities, I've observed, become increasingly ideologically homogenous (there may be some exceptions to this, I'm sure). But with YikYak, you are forced to encounter people who do not share your interests. They only share your geographic space and your willingness to use YikYak. \n\nAgain, I KNOW there are exceptions to this lack of robust, sophisticated debate on Reddit. But even those sub-Reddits are liable to the problem of homogeneity by virtue of the silo-ed design of Reddit. YikYak, as much as people like to dump on it, may be a more heterogeneous \"public sphere\" than Reddit. \n\nWhat say you?",

Right now it reached it's absolute peak with the FineBros scandal.\n\nThe outrage is always shortlived but once one thing is through theres another thing to be outraged about right on the doorstep.\n\nLike right now we seamlessly transitioned from Amy Schumer stealing jokes, to Youtube sucking balls (though that was an undercurrent for like 2 weeks), to most recently the whole React thing.\n\nEven before that we had outrage about \"Prank\" channels. A lot of times this outrage is generated by only one video that gains a lot of attention. For example even before the hate towards Prank channels there was a period of outrage about \"safe spaces\", which all started with one video about an Halloween incident at Yale (if anyone remebers that).\n\nThe question now is where this is all going. Like right now almost all of /r/videos is React related. A lot of users do not like this, they don't come to /r/videos to look for drama, but to laugh or be entertained. So this never ending stream of drama could actually drive users away from the subreddit.\n\nSo what do you think? Is /r/videos suffering from it or not?",

The reddit community jumped on this - gaining +670 in /r/Canada alone.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/canada/duplicates/3sj2f1/marketplace_pfizers_emergenc_among_vitamin/\n\nRecently (approximately 1 week ago), Marketplace issued an apology statement/redaction of the previous article. As it turns out, the lab involved made some errors, and after re-testing, the previously singled-out products were in fact found to meet their label claims. In other words, there was no issue with them.\n\nOn /r/Canada, where this was submitted on Jan 22, this retraction report got a mere 11 upvotes. Across Reddit, it was basically ignored.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/canada/related/426tc3/cbc_retracts_supplement_report/\n\nThe concern here is the original Marketplace article has been found to be hogwash. At the same time, due to what might be a bias in Reddit users preferring 'negative' news to positive, all those who initially commented/read the original news report are potentially walking around with incorrect information - nobody even saw the redaction.\n\nI'm not sure how widespread this type of behaviour is. I'm also not sure if there is any solution available. However, it makes me believe there is some echo-chamber going on all over Reddit.",

However, looking at the sub, most threads don't have any comments and few are upvoted into double digits.\n\nThere are usually two or three exceptions at any time, these threads have hundreds if not thousands of upvotes and usually hundreds of comments. So basically we have tiny pockets of high activity and vast wastelands without any activity. This is probably because whatever post makes it to the top of the page is then seen by people on their personal homepage and this attracts them, but few directly visit the sub itself.\n\nAnyways, I don't have any great insight, it is just something interesting I noticed and would love to hear what other people think of it. /r/Books is another example. /r/SandersForPresident would be an example of the opposite, a massive sub that is massively active with all posts have hundreds or more commonly thousands of upvotes and hundreds of comments.",

There are obvious XXX spam bots.\n\nBut lately I've noticed an influx of comment bots on Reddit, and they're doing a pretty good job of passing as human.\n\nWhat's that?  You ask how one might notice a comment bot?  Well, you've come to the right place.\n\nBehaviors of a comment bot:\n\n * Markov chain, AKA \"Frankenstein bot\":  they will take portions of other comments in the thread, and chain them together, creating a new, often nonsensical comment.  See /r/subredditsimulator for examples.\n\n * Comment copy:  makes an identical comment that someone has already made in the Reddit thread.  The syntax will be identical.\n\n * Imgur comment copy:  makes an identical comment that someone has already made on Imgur.  The syntax will be identical.\n\n * Comment repost:  runs an image/gif through KarmaDecay.com and copies a comment from when it has been posted previously.  The syntax will be identical.\n\nSome of you may have already noticed these accounts.  I've seen a huge influx of them lately, so I created /r/spambotwatch to track them.\n\nDoes any of this matter?  I don't know.  It's possible that we'll see them all show up on the next Volkswagen or Marco Rubio AMA.  It's possible that they're all just some Computer Science class project.\n\nThey seem to hang out everywhere.  I've been posting to subs like /r/animalsbeingjerks and /r/thisismylifenow, and they're showing up there, as well as in subs like /r/aww and /r/gifs.  If a post can get &gt;1,000 points, it seems like they'll pop in.\n\nWhat can you do?  If you're interested in doing anything, just post a link to the account in /r/spambotwatch.  I'm not really sure of anything else that can be done.  It might not matter, and it might be impossible to combat.  If you have any ideas I'd love to hear it, but right now I'm just trying to make people aware of them.  If any of their comments receive enough downvotes they'll delete the comment, but I think even brigading bots might get us shadowbanned, so I don't recommend it.\n\nPersonally, I think the point is to appear to have a legit comment history.  I don't think it's so much about karma acquisition, although I've seen some of the comments highly upvoted and gilded.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on bots that try to pass as human?",

EDIT: As mentioned by /u/Br00ce, also brigading.\n\n5) Overcorrection. People see a downvoted comment that they don't think deserves it, and are motivated to upvote it, whereas a similar comment with only a few net upvotes might be ignored. EDIT: As mentioned by /u/Br00ce, people may be prompted to overcorrect by a child comment.",

        "text": "Circlejerks have existed since the beginning of human time. Whether it be Senator Cato the Elder calling for the destruction of Carthage, or Senator Joseph McCarthy calling for the outing of communists, circle jerks have always had the same basic principles. An outside force does something the public doesn't agree with or antagonizes them personally. So the public, in response, blame the outside force for problems that may or may not exist, almost all outside opinions on the subject are ignored or  denied, no matter how strong it may be. \n\nWhich brings us to Reddit. Reddit is odd in the fact it doesn't usually have a McCarthy or Cato that leads the jerk, at least one that we can see. Instead you could argue the instigator is the media. People on Reddit are humans, and like most humans we want the most information in the shortest amount of time. And a large amount of redditors (myself included) do not read the article. Especially when the subjects really controversial. They go straight to the comments to offer their opinions. Which brings me to my main point. \n\n*We reward people if they have the \"right\" opinion*. And punish them is they don't. The karma system on Reddit is completely abusive. In real life, the best you can do is praise someone for their opinion, and the worse is argue with them. On reddit the best you can do is give them Karma or gold. And the worst is take away that karma or gold. The downvote button was not originally meant to be a dislike button. But everyone (including me) use it as one. In real life, if say your whole family is against gay marriage, and you're just a kid, you don't know what a gay person is. And you're watching TV and see a gay person, and you're whole family talks about how they don't like him because of how gay he is. Odd's are you won't like gay people either. And if you go on a thread about a controversial subject like racism or sexism. And you see a \"SJW\" buried in the comments sitting on -25. You might downvote them, even if you have no opinion on the subject, because of our natural need to feel part of something. That comment might change your views so now you disagree with that comment (which is fine, as long as you have a good argument). \n\nI know you're all thinking. \"Where did circlejerks come from?\" And there is no one answer. Some come from offsite from forums such as 4chan or StormFront. There are some innocent circlejerks such as Carl Sagan or whenever a celebrity dies. But then there's the not so pretty ones. Reddit is predominantly white, heterosexual, atheist, American, males. And our surroundings and upbringing, influence us is ways we can't even imagine. Two current circlejerks I'll use are the Anti-Amy Schumer, and the Anti-Oscarssowhite. Now these are two basic circlejerks and perfect for what we are talking about. The Amy Schumer one revolves around sexism and the Oscarssowhite one revolves around racism. I won't argue about either and go off topic. But the reason these have been circle-jerked is because, like I said, reddit is predominately heterosexual white males. And because of that people on reddit feel as if heterosexual white males have been unfairly \"persecuted\" in real life. Maybe they developed that feeling on reddit, maybe they developed it in their teens and now reddit solidified that, maybe they're still teens, but the circlejerk doesn't care. If you have the right opinion on Reddit, the circlejerk just swallows that up. \n\nMy point is, people are who they are, because of their environments, and their environments are what they are because of the past. And circlejerks personify that, due to the similarity in the upbringings and experiences in a lot of redditors lives, circlejerking can be, and is, a reflection of that. And while it's human nature to circlejerk, reddit takes it a step further, punishing dissenting opinions, and rewarding you for familiarity. How do we stop this? I have no idea. But the next time you find yourself voting or commenting, think \"Am I circlejerking?\" and \"Is that a bad thing?\" \n\nTL;DR- Circlejerking is human nature but reddit takes it to the next level. \n\nPS: Some people may be mad at how I generalize reddit. But I do so because, its painfully obvious that a large amount of reddit believes certain things. ",

Data is not available for posts earlier than October 2007 - so results may be incorrect for accounts older than this date.\n\nThe page also shows some basic stats about first-time comments and submissions. Most results are what you'd expect - /r/AskReddit is at #1 (and over 3 times bigger than /r/funny at #2 for first-time comments), and about 20% of all first-time submissions is from Imgur. Almost 50% of first-time submissions are self-posts, mostly skewed by /r/AskReddit.\n\n15.97 million users have posted at least one comment, whereas for submissions, that number is 16.03 million, which I find a bit surprising, as one would think commenting is a lot less effort than making a submission.\n\nIf you have any suggestions for any other statistics, let me know and I will update the page.

        "text": "At time of writing /* and editing /*, there is an [interesting post](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/41zak5/global_temperatures_in_2015_by_far_hottest_in/) that sits atop the mountain of submissions on r/science's front page for all users to see.  ~~All of them, apparently, except for me.~~\n\n~~You see, I thought it odd to see it sitting there, after watching~~ at least 5 posts on the same topic ~~get~~ /* were /* rapidly removed yesterday, when the news story first blew up.  They had been removed, and /* I'm sure the moderators who did so thought /* rightly so, for breaking that subreddit's submission rules: the report they cite is not a peer-reviewed journal article.\n\nSo I reported this post for its transgression.  ~~Then, immediately upon returning to r/science's front page, it was gone.  Until I logged off, that is.  It seems that the post had only been 'shadow removed', which I didn't even know was a thing!  I hypothesize that others might observe the same effect upon reporting the post: it will appear to have been removed while logged in but become visible again upon logging off...~~ /* (hypothesis confirmed; speculated mechanism falsified) /*\n\nI'm ~~also~~ suspicious that it might be less than coincidence that (a) this particular post is not getting the same treatment as others before it, and (b) it contains a stickied mod-post promoting today's r/Science AMA on the same topic.\n\nWhy should this ~~be justification for violating submission rules on such a heavily moderated subreddit~~ /* post be the first of several posts on the same topic which escapes the Wrath of the Mods /* ?  ~~Does it~~ /* It would seem to /* call into the question the integrity of the moderation tactics on r/Science~~?~~. \n\nAfter all, the quantity of removed comments and posts are quite high on this particular subreddit, the highest by far of any of those where my lurking carries me with any frequency.  (Besides of course one of its own sisters: r/askscience!)  Yet here we have a rather explicit example of ~~*motives* driving a deviation of the subreddit's moderation dynamics from the rules purported to guide it.~~\n\n~~In this case, admittedly, that deviation is one that favors a scientifically valid post.  But if there can be deviations in one direction, what is to stop deviations in the other?~~  /* inappropriate removals. /*  What is to stop a user from reporting a post on ideological motives just to have it removed?  How skewed have visible posts/comments become on this subreddit due to heavy-handed ~~and/or willful~~ moderation tactics?\n\nI rarely comment these days, but report frequently.  So I can attest that the removal of comments and posts usually follows rapidly from such reports, and I can confirm that in general, in contrast to today, if I log off after I do so, they remain removed... /* Surprisingly, given what u/dukwon has taught me in the comments below, this statement actually remains true.  Which makes it something of a testament to the *speed* at which reported posts tend to be removed from view in this subreddit. /*\n\nSo consider this post a call for moderation reform on popular science subreddits.  I understand the impetus for the heavy moderation that these subreddits have come to receive, and I sympathize with the goals that motivate this.  But I cannot help but be suspicious of the way it is currently pursued.\n\nI think the first step is introduce greater transparency in the process.  r/Science should collect statistics on its moderation habits, and make them publicly available via the sidebar:\n\n* What fraction of all submitted posts are removed, and how quickly does it happen?\n* Similarly for comments\n* What are the proportions of the various potential reasons for removal?\n* etc (any dditional ideas for measurable aspects of r/Science's moderation dynamics?)\n\nIt would also seem reasonable to request good faith efforts on the part of the Mods to address the following:\n\n* What steps do moderators take to verify the accuracy of reports before acting on them?  Are there any controls in place to decrease the likelihood of unfair removals? ~~(Or, as to today's example attests, even occasionally unfair non-removals!~~  At least one the posts I reported yesterday was rising rapidly.  Why should that user be denied the karma that u/mars_colonist has been so liberally handed!?~~)~~\n* Can a single moderator remove a comment or post?  If so, should this be replaced by a consensus threshold prior to removal?  (Is that even possible on Reddit's systems?)\n* ~~On what grounds, and with what frequency, do the Mods make decisions to willingly break their own rules?~~\n* ~~On what grounds, and with what frequency, do the Mods take steps to make it hard for users to recognize that they are doing so?  On what philosophy do they feel that it is ethical to do so?~~\n* Should the sidebar include a (link to) a statement regarding the philosophy behind the subreddit's moderation tactics?  *Why* does its moderation need to be so heavy-handed?  What, for example, is the harm of allowing downvotes to sort out some of the chaff, rather than removing it wholesale?\n* etc?\n\nAnyway, you all can probably tell by now that today's event is more of a /* (misguided) /* 'last straw' sort of thing and this post is not a spontaneous reaction.  The discomfort with the heaviness of moderation at r/science and r/askscience has bothered me for some time now.\n\nThough maybe that is due to the fact that I enjoy reading the comments that get written not only from an informative aspect, but also from a 'meta' aspect; learning something about the way people (not only the more educated, but also those less so) *think* about these topics can be as valuable as walking away with a new factoid to spread.  Yet a heavy moderatorship removes many of those unintentionally insightful comments before more than two or three people have even had a chance to see them!\n\nSo I suppose I'm just wondering if I'm the only one who is made uncomfortable by what I have come to call the \"hardening\" of these subreddits, or if this sentiment is in any way prevalent.  Anyway, I suppose I'll go ahead and step back down from my soapbox now.\n\n**TL;DR**: What are the costs of over-moderation on the popular science subreddits, and to what extent are they actually outweighed by the benefits?\n\nEDIT:\n\nIt has been [pointed out to me](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/41zak5/global_temperatures_in_2015_by_far_hottest_in/cz6hsg2) that government sources are apparently allowed sources.  Though I did not remember this being the case, I have to admit that, upon checking, the Submission Rules section does clearly state this.\n\nHowever, this only reinforces my points regarding a high potential for unwarranted post removals, given that this story was removed several times just yesterday...\n\nEDIT 2:\n\nIt has also been [pointed out to me](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/42247v/the_mods_have_spoken_and_called_it_good_or_when/cz71n4c) that I'm something of an idiot, and that today's triggering event was triggering only due to my own ignorance of a difference in the way reddit handles posts that are reported versus comments that are reported.  Which is a shame, since my critique would actually have more forceful *without* that complication than with it.\n\nI've adjusted the text above for accuracy in light of this new information while also preserving my idiocy for the sake of posterity.  The question of whether or not the reception of my critique would have been this negative (It was always going to be negative, of course, but to what **degree**?) must now remain a pointless counterfactual.  It did inspire at least [one thoughtful comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/42247v/the_mods_have_spoken_and_called_it_good_or_when/cz70z0b), though, so I'd say in the end the effort has been worth the scorn.\n\n:P",

What happens when a previously default-status sub is removed from the Frontpage?\n\n**Edit:** the (amazing) answers below have shown me that I phrased my second question badly.

What are your thoughts?\n\nOne thing I find particularly interesting is that since the ability to sticky comments was introduced, five moderators have been awarded the Inciteful Comment trophy in their profile.  This award is given to comments which garner a lot of both upvotes and downvotes.\n\n * Jan 11, /u/Meoang:  http://reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/40j8lu/reynads_video_discussing_drama_on_the_subreddit/cyum7vk?context=5#cyum7vk\n\n * Jan 7, /u/courtiebabe420:  http://reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3zwrjn/i_am_actress_natalie_dormer_from_the_forest_game/cypo4no?context=5#cypo4no\n\n * Dec 20, /u/GodOfAtheism:  https://www.reddit.com/r/ImGoingToHellForThis/comments/3xjpln/when_your_poopdeck_is_too_big_for_the_life/cy5e45v?context=5#cy5e45v\n\n * Dec 12, /u/videosmods:  https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3wkn2l/denied_aknowledgment_of_damage_done_to_my_car_by/cxx1trr?context=5#cxx1trr\n\n * Dec 10, /u/NotANestleShill:  https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3w7w5s/tifu_by_holding_a_door_open_for_a_female_coworker/cxumzdt?context=5#cxumzdt\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/wiki/awards#inciteful_comment\n\nIn what ways could this feature be abused?
