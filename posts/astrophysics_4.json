So I've come here to ask for help.\n\nCan a 3 planet-system work around the same star but yet hold different kinds of enviroments? How would they orbit? Could a \"dyson-sphere-like\" mechanism be implemented for these planets to strive? How would they behave around each other? If they have their own moons, how would the moons react one to another when coming in close orbit contact?  \nMixing the concept of magic and real physics may be weird, but after reading writers like Brandon Sanderson it seems possible to make a fantasy out of something that may be half real.\n\nI'm aware that maybe the questionsm, these and many more, are not going to be really well formulated since I am no pro at this and exploring is the best I can do, but if any one could lend me a hand, that would be really appreciated!",

        "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI've been thinking about the nature of dark energy and its relationship to the expansion of the universe, and I wanted to propose a new theory.\n\nAs far as we know, dark energy is an as of yet unexplained form of energy that is thought to exist in order to explain the observed acceleration of the expansion of the universe. It is not well understood, and there are many different theories that have been proposed to explain its nature.\n\nOne possibility is that dark energy could be related to the overall structure of the universe. Some theories suggest that the universe may have a multi-faceted structure, with different regions exhibiting different expansion rates.\n\nHowever, I think there could be another explanation. What if dark energy is a result of the infinite mass of an infinite universe pulling on every other piece of space harder and harder with the passing of each second?\n\nWe know that gravity is a force that arises from the presence of mass or energy, and that it propagates at the speed of light. If the universe is infinite, as some theories suggest, then it would contain an infinite amount of mass. This would mean that the force of gravity would be present at every point in space, and it would continue to grow over time as more and more mass is 'exposed' by the passing of time to every other point in the universe. This has been happening for 13.8 billion years already, and it will only be increasing more and more.\n\nIf the universe is infinite and the above statements are based in truth, then the force of gravity would be constantly pulling on the fabric of space, despite the fall-off by the inverse-square law, driving the expansion of the universe.\n\nThis could be what we observe as Dark Energy.\n\nOf course, this is just a theory, and it would need to be tested and verified through further research. But I think it's an interesting possibility to consider. What do you all think?\n\nThanks for reading!",

In both cases, natural selection drives the development and evolution of complex systems.\n\n* In the case of DNA, natural selection acts on individual organisms, selecting for those that are best suited to their environment.\n* In the case of cosmic evolution, natural selection acts on entire galaxies, selecting for those that are most efficient at forming new stars and planets.\n\n# Another important similarity is the idea of self-organization.\n\nIn both cases, complex systems arise from the interactions of simpler components.\n\n* In the case of DNA, this involves the way that individual atoms come together to form complex molecules like DNA.\n* In the case of cosmic evolution, this involves the way that individual particles come together to form galaxies, stars, and planets.\n\nThis has implications for our understanding of the origins of life on Earth, as well as the origins of the universe itself.\n\nIt also suggests that the principles of evolution and natural selection that we see at work in DNA may also be at work on a larger scale in the universe as a whole.",

        "text": "Tonight my wife and I were discussing what little we know about the theory of stellar formation. We ran up against a question that neither of us could answer: how can clouds of gas form in a vacuum? What brings them together in the first place, and what keeps them together when simple diffusion should cause them to dissipate? My guess is it is related to gravity, and there is perhaps some minimum size and density of gas cloud, where there is an equilibrium between the attractive force of gravity and the dispersive force of diffusion. I have read molecular clouds tend to be about 10 K, so I guess the dispersive force would be low and the diffusion would be slow. But there’s a lot of space and time for that diffusion to happen.\n\nI guess when I’m here I should also ask about the surprisingly low figure for the volumetric power density of 276.5 W/m³. Is it just the sheer size of the sun, plus the fact that it can only radiate energy into free space at its surface, that allows it to reach temperatures of 15 million Kelvin at the core? Somehow thermonuclear, fireball and compost heap-level power density seems hard to square up.",

        "text": "Hi, everyone! This post might be a little all over the place, so sorry in advance if you decide to read it. I am super thankful for any responses, though! You can be brutally honest - I would actually prefer it.\n\nFor a little background, ever since I was young, I have loved anything to do with outer space. I would stargaze any chance I could, read any books I could get my hands on. When I got to high school, my mind was set on studying astrophysics in college. But while in high school, I took an AP calculus course and an introductory physics course. I struggled quite a bit - which now that I'm thinking of it, I didn't really study as hard because I used to never have to to get good grades. While I could easily grasp and understand the theories, actually executing them was my issue. Despite struggling, I did get okay grades in the end.\n\nBut because of the struggle, I sat myself down to think about my future. Would I be able to succeed in a competitive career environment when it took me so long to be able to solve some equations? At the last minute, in my senior year, I decided to take a different path and went to major in communications. Writing and media have always been a strong suit of mine, so it seemed like the safest option. But then that didn't work out, so now I'm going for international relations. And while I think I would enjoy and thrive with that type of career, I can't stop thinking about trying for astrophysics again.\n\nI've gotten a lot better at studying and retaining information, and I think I'll really be able to push myself. But this is me thinking of myself. If it's really possible, I won't know until I try it. But I figured I could ask for some opinions to see what other people thought. \n\n\ntldr; i sucked at math in high school, think i can do better now, and want to try switching my major to astrophysics. should i? thank you for any responses!!",

        "text": "Hi everyone! I hope you're all doing well :-)\n\nI'm going to try my best to keep this short, but it may end up being quite long - my apologies!\n\nI am currently an undergraduate student studying biology, and I'll be graduating the summer of 2024. In high school, I took the International Baccalaureate, with physics and biology at higher level, but with math at standard level. Because of this, I did not meet the requirements for a physics or astrophysics undergraduate course at UK universities (which required both higher level physics *and* math). I could have easily done a foundation year, but at the time, I had my mind set on specializing in astrobiology, and since I had gotten accepted to a prestigious biology programme, I thought I might as well become an astrobiologist through the biology route.\n\nHowever, although deep down I always knew this, I finally have come to the realization that while I do love biology, my true passion lies in astrophysics. I would still love to specialize in astrobiology, but I would definitely much rather get my degree(s) in astrophysics (and, if astrobiology does not work out, I would much rather become an astrophysicist over a biologist).\n\nHere is where the problem lies: Every single Master's and PhD programme in astrophysics I've come across requires an undergraduate in a related discipline (either astrophysics, physics or math)! Now, if re-doing my undergraduate degree means I get to do what I love, I would. But, it's both extremely expensive and time-consuming, so I hope that's not the only option I have.\n\nI have sent an email to an astrobiologist/astrophysicist who was my teacher/professor in a summer course I attended; she wrote back an extensive email with such fantastic advice, one of which is taking the Physics GRE, getting an outstanding score, and applying to astrophysics Master's/PhD programmes in hopes my Physics GRE score is proof that my physics background is strong enough for the course.\n\nNow, I am already quite ready to start studying for the Physics GRE (this is actually another question I have - I've bought the Fundamentals of Physics textbook by Jearl Walker, am planning to study that in its entirety, and then move on to Conquering the Physics GRE by Yoni Kahn and Adam Anderson. Does that sound like a good plan?) But, I thought I'd like to write on here to reach a wider audience who might have some other insights and advice that could be useful.\n\nWhat do you think is the best course of action to take in my situation?\n\nThank you so much for reading all of this! I look forward to reading your responses :-)",

So, sorry if I say something extremely dumb.\n\n \n\n1. If an object were to make a slingshot maneuver around the sun with a given mass it would gain acceleration as it gets closer to the sun. Now, my question is, if the object starts with, let's say, 10 units of mass (just a random number of mass) and by the end of the slingshot maneuver it had lost mass until it only had 1 unit of mass, would the acceleration it got from the maneuver multiply by 10 or losing mass while accelerating by a gravity well doesn't do anything?\n2. And if it does do something, would it need to lose mass continuously from the start of the maneuver until the end or would it work better if it lost all that mass at the periaxis?",

I was reading that this can be measured in our own solar system as the earth's orbit, increases by 1.6cm per year due to stellar mass loss of our own sun.\nThis implies that on the galactic scale, galaxies would be returning space into to the intergalactic areas of the universe and I can imagine this would be a significant cumulative effect, especially when we account for the total number of galaxies.\nCan we definitively conclude that this does not account for the expansion we see?
