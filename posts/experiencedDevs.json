Does it have to be that way?","author":"robertgfthomas","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ExperiencedDevs\/comments\/11pjcjl\/why_is_cms_development_always_so_godawful_does_it\/","text":"Over the years I've been assigned to work on about 10 Wordpress and Drupal instances. Some were for companies that are household names, some were for small companies. Each instance has been a horrible, painful development experience.\n\nNow I'm tasked with taking over yet another Drupal instance. I'd love to switch over to a headless CMS, but as developers we're always tempted to say, \"Just torch it and start over from scratch,\" and frequently that's not the right approach. Also this company has been using Drupal for years and has a pile of content on it. Cutting over isn't practical with the resources we have. So, combining that and the fact that Wordpress and Drupal are so widely-used, I really want to find ways to make them enjoyable.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n- **Is the DevEx for CMS projects always awful for everyone?**\n- **Why?**\n- **Can it be different?**\n\n# How it's awful:\n\n- **User experience.** One of the big selling points of a CMS is that it's usable by nontechnical content-writers. But in each case the content-writers have been so intimidated and overwhelmed by the UI that they just write the content in Word\/Docs\/emails and send it to the developers for implementation.\n- **Installation process.** Each time it has taken at least 3 days to just get the codebase up and running. Even when the build process looks well-documented, in practice it always takes hours of twiddling with drush, Docker, Lando, Composer, etc.\n- **Build and deployment process.** As with installation, every developer finds they have to do things differently from every other developer. What makes it worse is that every command takes 30s - 60s to execute. Also every Drupal project seems to be hosted on Pantheon, which nobody seems to like.\n- **Dependency management.** The codebase is chock full of vendor libraries, all committed to version control (if there's any version control at all). It's impossible to tell what is actually being used. Worse, some libraries have been modified locally.\n- **Code clarity.** Even when things appear to have been done \"right,\" the codebase is so complex that it's hard to know where to start. The database has dozens of tables the purpose of which is hard to pin down.\n\n# Why it is this way:\n\nIt would be easy to say that Wordpress and Drupal are just bad tools. But the reality is there are lots of very talented developers who contribute to them, use them, and love them, so that can't be true. I've thought over possible reasons:\n\n- **Because of PHP.** People love to rag on PHP. True, it was my first back-end language and there's a reason I've tried to avoid it for ~10 years. **But I don't buy that everything written in PHP is hard to grok.** The language seems to have evolved a lot. And it's possible to write great code and garbage code in any language.\n- **Because CMSes are inherently complicated.** CMSes have to be usable for content-writers and consumers, and have to be scalable and performant all the while. That's hard. Plus, Wordpress and Drupal have been around for a long time, so lessons-learned and the need to be backwards-compatible have both probably informed most decisions by its developers. **But that doesn't mean using them has to be complicated.** There are plenty of sophisticated web frameworks that have lots going on under-the-hood but a much better DevEx.\n- **Because people set them up the wrong way.** My sample size is 10 CMSes across very diverse industries and companies. **I don't buy that all of them were implemented poorly.** Some of the other developers on the projects seemed a bit out of their depth, sure, but there were plenty who seemed very competent, and chalked up the difficulties to \"That's just the way it is.\" If all 10 of these CMSes _were indeed_ implemented poorly, that would imply it's far too easy to set them up the wrong way, which is probably one of the first things the internal development team would address.\n\nCurious to hear other perspectives?","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1678640004.0},{"title":"SVB depositors to recover in full; Signature Bank NY also shut down","author":"BumpitySnook","url":"https:\/\/home.treasury.gov\/news\/press-releases\/jy1337","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.78,"created_utc":1678662550.0},{"title":"Transitioning from management in web dev to low level\/embedded\/OS work","author":"Twoodeep","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ExperiencedDevs\/comments\/11pn769\/transitioning_from_management_in_web_dev_to_low\/","text":"Surely some variant of this question gets asked here somewhat frequently but I wasn't able to find anything related enough to be satisfying.\n\nI have about 7 YOE, currently managing two teams doing web dev and data engineering in the ad industry. I'm torn between what feels two paths that feel reasonable for me to take at this point:\n\n1) I'm pretty good at managing and enjoy it, I think I could get more comp by continuing down this path and just building on management + the IC skills I have in the domains above. This feels like a safe choice.\n\n2) \"Start over\" and go into something more low level, which I find so much more interesting and read\/experiment with a lot in my free time. I think the overall financial potential here is smaller than continuing down the beancounter track I'm currently on, but maybe the comp delta is smaller than I think? I also don't know what is a reasonable comp hit to expect to take given that I have 0 professional experience working in low level systems and have been a Node monkey my entire IC career (along with some  infra and data experience).\n\nI should also mention I have no CS degree. I do have a physics degree and am good at self study but my overall CS knowledge is hit or miss - either real world high level knowledge or just reading through textbooks and doing little experiments myself. I would imagine there is a stronger bias against self taught devs in low level work as compared to the bootcamp frenzy of web dev.\n\nI'm interested to hear from others who have made a comparable transition.

I like to have autonomy and ownership of the things I work on. I've mostly had managers in the past who delegated and then evaluated outcomes, and would get involved only if they needed to. Not so with my current manager. Maximum involvement seems to be his style. He keeps a record of every single interaction that happens during the week and will bring up every mistake no matter the scale during our 1-1 meeting.  These meetings take on the feeling of an interrogation. \"When you were working on [x] you took too long to figure out [y] was the root cause. Why is that?\" These are very often nit-picking details, not things that I would expect managers to even care about.\n\nAll discussion is required to happen in the public chat so Manager can add to his chat log. As a result, I feel incentivized to *hide* mistakes and not be transparent about what I'm doing out of fear that if I make a mistake, I will be punished, and\/or it will damage my standing on the team. I've tried to ask coworkers for help privately, but they tell me \"don't cut the manager out of the discussion\" and won't respond except in the public chat. The criticism is also inconsistent, and seems to be dependent on Manager's moods, so it's impossible to know if any given mistake is going to be ignored (\"Thanks for being persistent\") or blown up into yet another sign of your utter incompetence.\n\nThe worst part of this to me is not just pointing out mistakes, but making assumptions that the mistakes were due to some personal flaw. He criticizes my problem solving ability, not specific errors in judgment or skills that I need to develop. I don't know everything and I'm going to make mistakes, that's just the nature of this work. It doesn't mean I'm not intelligent or that my problem solving ability is low relative to someone else. I don't feel a lot of respect from Manager. It's obvious he doesn't think very highly of me, and this might be in part because I'm the only member of the team that he didn't personally select to hire -- I was on the team before he joined, so I'm seen as part of the \"legacy\" team. All of this adds to a sense of resentment and distrust. I suspect that a lot of the nit-picking is Manager trying to build a case against me so he can replace with someone of his own choosing.\n\nMore to the point of my question -- I really dislike this management style, and I absolutely dread interacting with my manager directly. I don't feel I have enough job security to criticize him to upper management, so I haven't said anything to that effect. The job market is awful and I will probably have to stick it out here for at least another year until things soften up. In the meantime, how can I make the best of this situation?

Now not all team will have a good platform to present your work, in such cases you need to take an initiative and setup sessions to present your work.\n\n3.

I live and work in the EU.\n\n---\n\nHere you can enjoy the story of my failures so far:\n\nI got in touch with a local coding bootcamp. I sat in on a session, talked with one of their teachers, and it seemed reasonable enough. As in, actually providing value to the students and not just blatantly ripping them off. When it came time to sign the paperwork, the contract was horrifying. I really hope the terms they intended to enforce were not legally enforceable. I couldn't convince them to drop the particularly egregious clauses from the contract, so it never got signed. The worst thing was that they expected a teacher who missed a session for any reason to be liable to them for an amount of money that was wildly out of proportion to their pitiful compensation. Illness and acts of god not excepted. What the hell?\n\nI tried tutoring a friend who professed a desire to make a change in their career. We don't live in the same area anymore, so we did this with weekly online calls. It was at no cost, since they're my friend and I was happy just to help. We had only an informal agreement that if they got a software job and a fat paycheck thanks to me, then they might express their gratitude financially. And the tutoring seemed to be going very well. They were already writing basic programs and algorithms on their own after maybe twenty hours of tutoring over a few months. Given their aptitude and the lesson plan I was working through, I think they'd have been junior dev employable in less than a year, maybe much less. But then they must have gotten tired of the sessions, or maybe they already found a tech job and didn't want to feel obligated to me, because they sort of ghosted me. (Dude, I'm not mad and you don't owe me. Answer my texts you coward.)\n\nAfter that I tried posting an ad on Fiverr, but that went poorly. I wonder if it was the wrong place to ask for a rate that, while aggressively discounted compared to the value of my time as a software professional, wasn't bottom-of-the-barrel. For the months that I had it up, the only people who responded to the ad with any seriousness pretty much just expected to pay me a shit rate to do university coursework for them. Which would be a terrible waste of my time, since at that point I might as well just freelance. But I would like to teach.\n\nSo I'm hoping there's some option I'm missing. Maybe a website that doesn't suck for experienced people offering serious online tutoring services? Maybe some bootcamp-type organization I could work with that isn't garbage? Maybe market myself to corporations as a consultant who can train their juniors?

Thankfully, there are not yet any mandatory ratios imposed to label anyone as a low performer to be managed out, for now we just need to bell curve and label the top 5% as 5s, then other 30% we give 4s and 65% 3s. HR wants us to only give 2s and 1s to employees who the manager is actually actively PIPing and there needs to be explicit approval from your department head to label someone as an underperformer.\n\nBut as we get ever bigger I'm sure it'll happen one day where we are encouraged to label 5% or 10% as low performers to either improve or manage out each year.\n\nI am a manager and this got me thinking that if a company ever mandates forced ranking for low performers on each team\/division, then among high performing teams who want to minimize turnover among core members, it would be perfectly rational for a smart manager to intentionally hire folks to reserve for firing. \"Sacrificial lambs\" so to speak. Where KPIs incentive for the wrong things.\n\nIn tech in particular, learning a complex codebase well and becoming a \"net positive\" independent contributor generally takes a minimum of 3 months even for really bright folks, probably closer to 6+ months for most folks. If you manage a team of say 6 engineers and lose 1 every year to forced attrition from stack ranking mandates, it makes much more sense to just keep a team of 5 that you invest time in to develop, and reserve a rotating slot for an unlucky sacrificial lamb each year.\n\nReading Wikipedia and news articles, it appears the savviest managers during Ballmer era Microsoft routinely practiced this and so do many Amazon managers currently.\n\nIn retrospect, I'm like 90% certain that this happened to me at my 2nd job after college at an extremely high talent bar and profitable financial firm with notorious stack ranking and turnover. I was effectively Pipped right after I finished the analyst onboarding and spent a total of 1 week with my team at the trading desk. Fortunately they gave me substantial severance and the company brand (and reputation for firing fast) was strong enough that it was net boost for my career to work there despite being stacked. But I'm sure that for many folks who were less resilient or fortunate than myself or even worse, non-citizen on H1Bs who were kicked out of the country because of this, it was not a pleasant experience.\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum though is if there is such a strong sense of safety that people become lazy and just \"rest and vest\". Apparently one of my friends at a very well known tech firm literally has 0 diffs on her git account during ski season the last 2 years.... (to be fair this person is brilliant the rest of the year but still this seems excessively luxurious).\n\nSo in conclusion my view is you still probably need some sort of stack ranking (maybe make it very obvious to pay people who work hard\/ have high impact large bonuses), but probably eliminate the forced\/desired turnover percentage if you don't want your firm to have perverse incentives.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1678307259.0},{"title":"New job is a bad fit, how to learn from this situation?","author":"deaths_head_hawkmoth","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ExperiencedDevs\/comments\/11mglmj\/new_job_is_a_bad_fit_how_to_learn_from_this\/","text":"Background: I have >5 YOE, all at the same company.

I asked a lot of questions to the hiring manager to make sure that I would be doing *exactly* that thing that I wanted to go into and I looked at the title \/ pay cut as an investment into my future career, maybe this was just a cope. \n\nI know it takes a few months at least to get settled into a new job, but I think I have a pretty good idea of the scope of my role at this point and the bottom line is that it does not match the job description at all. I would not have accepted the offer if I had known this.  I have asked for other tasking but that has been ignored.\n\nOther stuff I asked about basically ended up being false: CI\/CD, code review process, the amount of legacy code, etc. Basically a lot of dealbreakers for me in terms of quality of life as an engineer. I do not think it was from malice, but rather from ignorance, all the same I do not want to be on a team where the lead is that disconnected. At my previous job that was the situation and it led to our PM not communicating deadlines to the engineers, which caused a lot of unnecessary overtime.\n\nFrom browsing this sub it seems like the consensus is that a quick job hop is not a big deal if it is a one-time thing, so I'm not worried about that. My questions are as follows:\n\n1. Is there any reason that I should stay for a few more months rather than start looking for a new job now? \n  \n  -  My tasking is mostly DevOPs related, are SWEs expected to have those skills and it would be beneficial for me to get comfortable with that before I leave? \n\n  - The company is a fairly prestigious \/ household name (not FAANG). Would it look especially bad if I left that so soon?\n\n2. How the hell do I avoid a situation like this happening again? \n\n  - I asked a lot of questions to the engineers in my final round interview, and I had a separate meeting with my hiring manager after I received my offer. I asked very pointed questions and everyone seemed to be very candid with their answers, but it seems like they just told me what they thought I wanted to hear. \n\n  - I have had a number of interviews and offers in my time at my previous job and all of the others I got a bad vibe from. I thought I had a pretty good system for weeding out companies with poor dev practices but I guess not.

We've been deploying our code in phased increments up until this point, which has served us very well, based off requirements.  However, now we have reached a point where those deployments and the code included are going to get more complicated, and I wanted to know the best way to handle our source code management.  Let me explain...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Existing Branching Strategy**\n\nOur `master` branch represents code that has been deployed in our production environment.  At the start of the project, feature branches were created off `master` and merge requests were submitted to merge those feature branches in as code was reviewed.  This worked fine, as nothing had been deployed to production yet and all of the initial code was to be included in Phase 1.\n\nAfter our first production deployment, I created a `develop` branch off of `master` and tagged the `master` release with a release number.  The develop branch was intended for code that was ready for deployment into our various test environments via our CI\/CD pipeline.  Code made its way into `develop` through the use of feature branches that were created from `develop` and then merged in.  Prior to each subsequent production release, the `develop` branch would be merged into `master` for final build.\n\nThis setup has served us well with the next several phased releases, but are now reaching a point where it's getting more complicated.\n\n**The Problem**\n\nWe are now in a phase in our project where some development work is slated for our final phase, but is NOT ready to go to production yet.  The work is completed but would have adverse affects on our existing functionality if it were to be merged into `master` and deployed to production (call it Code Base A).  There is other work that is completed that would is ready to go to production, or at the very least would be benign should it be deployed (call it Code Base B).\n\nUsing our existing branching strategy, this would be problematic.  We can't merge the feature branch for Code Base A into `develop` when the work is complete because our next production deployment would merge `develop` into `master`.  Code Base B is ready to go, which wouldn't create a problem.  But what to do about Code Base A?\n\nIs there a recommended strategy for a \"staged for release\" branch?  That is, `develop` would still be used for deployments to our non-production environments for testing, but when Code Base B is ready we could merge those changes into a `staged` branch?  How would we handle the Code Base A situation?  Are there strategies for a \"done but not ready for deployment\" branch?\n\nI've been spending entirely too much time reading up on various git flows and branching strategies, but can't see which one would be best for the scenario.  Are there any best practices you all recommend?  Can you give examples on what the git branch\/commit\/merge process would look like in such a situation?

Two of us are devs, the product is a iot device and a cloud platform. Im mainly a fullstack dev, and have been able to deliver features from day one. But over this period of time my workload have become more then just developer. When I started they talked about upping their monolith system to be Microservices based. I was in the discussion said I have some experience on hobbie projects but no real expertise. The same goes for 90% of AWS. I did however accept to try to deliver a poc application so we could evaluate, since I atleast have some experience with the concepts.\n\nThe poc turned out great, event bus, one api service, one websocket server and client. Also did a ci\/cd pipeline, monorepo structure. After that they have went all in with me, with full faith. But here\u2019s what\u2019s hard for me, their monolith with client is built in plain js. Many parts needs to be dissembled and rebuilt for scalability. AWS with kubernetes turns out to be a pain to build on. There are shitload of guides, but half of the time I\u2019m not sure if I understand correctly. And sometimes I go \u201cwhy did this work just now\u201d. \n\nMeanwhile I work on a service which was requested from a potential huge client, and there I was told to make a poc aswell. And they really liked it, so the boss shows other clients.. who also likes it. I get told to upgrade it a little and host it on ECS for now. And the problem is that the service has no ui, it works descent but now in this beta state I see problems with it when it\u2019s been running for two months. It needs development and my boss invites more people to try it and since there is no ui I need to manually add them, and this process is not automatic I need to do this in unison with the client. And sometimes a client crash and I need to set it up again. So I\u2019m basically an administrator here. Until the kubernetes cluster is done this is the way\u2026\n\nMy boss also wants me to build an oauth authorisation server, so I spend some good three days researching this and made the plan for this. Now it\u2019s on hold when he finally understands that this is a big project for our system that will change alot of the current build.\n\nWe have meetings every day for about an hour, makes me even more stressed.

Go to the repo for the site on e.g. Github\n1. Use the Github in-browser text editor to update the content of a Markdown or simple HTML file, or to create a new file\n1.

Open a pull request\n1. Let a designated reviewer merge in the PR\n\nHere's why that's a reasonable expectation of nontechnical people: they already have to spend a lot of time and energy figuring out a clunky CMS system. At the end of it they really don't understand the CMS any better, just how to interact with the backend UI. They may as well spend that time and energy learning Markdown or basic HTML. They'll come out with a much better understanding of the platform and the web in general.\n\nIn fact, most of the CMS content writers I've encountered had to manually edit\/insert snippets of HTML anyway in order to style things correctly!

The UI is largely static with few animations. It's used for presenting lists of products, a map of the store, upcoming events, etc.\n- The applications require Internet access anyway. However, even if they go offline, a SPA with frontloaded dependencies would remain usable\n\nPlus, SPAs have several advantages over compiled executables:\n\n- Deploying could be as simple as having the kiosk refresh the browser\n- The applications and the retailer's website could share component\/style libraries. The applications could even just be accessible as websites themselves\n- Front-end web technologies (JS\/TS\/CSS\/HTML) generally have a lower barrier to entry for developers than languages like .NET and Java\n\nThoughts?

Just this week, I was informed that my current project team is getting disbanded due to our client dropping the contract while near project completion and that more cuts would be coming thanks to this. No one knows who is going to be laid off or when. With that being said, I intended to leave this company anyways because I keep getting passed up on promotions due to these layoffs and the fact that my supervisor left the company before I got it and the new manager is ignoring my previous performance reviews.

Like many of you, I've been long complaining about tech interviews going deep into leetcode. If you talk to professionals in any other field, their interviews are nothing like this. Most interviews are discussing your past work, your credentials, etc. We *kind of* do that in tech, but much more emphasis is placed on your performance in a series of timed coding questions which are structured much more like a programming competition, and having little in common with daily work. \n\nThat is because leetcode questions are essentially computer science themed IQ tests. The theory here seems to be that if you hire smart people, throw them into a room together, and corral them correctly, you'll produce quality software. Whether or not this is true, it seems to be an assumption by HR, hiring managers, and CTOs. The most important factor we are selecting for in interviews is overall intelligence, and especially *fluid intelligence*.\n\nThat doesn't mean if you fail an interview you have a low IQ. After all, only one candidate can get the job. It does mean, however, that we can cater our approach to the interview with this understanding that your interviewer isn't only looking for professional skills, but specifically for fluid intelligence \u2013 the sort of thing one would normally measure with an IQ test.\n\nDoes this change anything about how we prepare for interviews?

Overall I'm pretty happy where I am and I've been able to make high profile contributions to the company.\n\nThe issue I'm running into is that my company's organization is *extremely* flat. There's a strict hierarchy of mid-level managers, C-suite execs, and then the company owners. Despite having double\/tripled our headcount over the last few years, we've hired basically no more managers. This presents organizational problems of its own, but it highlights the fact that the company's leaders are vehemently against adding any more layers of management, or even hiring more managers in general.\n\nWhat this means for me is that there is approximately zero room for career growth. I will never achieve a \"higher status\" title like Tech Lead, Manager etc because the company doesn't give those titles out to anyone. There are no lateral movements I could make to become a manager, and there is no official designation I could be given that would allow me to manage or lead groups of people. It's all done by the same hard-coded set of mid-level managers. Any attempt to even behave like a leader is usually frowned upon by management, I'm guessing because it makes them feel threatened in some way. Whatever the reason, they don't appreciate it.\n\nThis presents a conundrum for me. On one hand, I really like my TC, but on the other hand I feel like this is really pigeonholing me to only being an individual contributor.

I've estimated that it would be pretty difficult for me to keep my current compensation levels in a similar COL area at a different company, even if I apply to management roles.

There isn't enough push to get it done faster which I understand... you can't just hold back on ALL features until the refactor is done otherwise the company will go bust... but when I'm asked to build something in the monolith because otherwise we would need to wait for another team to refactor that portion of the monolith it feels like we're going in the wrong direction. I'm typically told that it's much more complicated than I think and our team definitely doesn't want to take on the refactoring of X.\n\nAnyways... my question is really about if this is normal. This is my first big company so I can only assume this is a symptom of being on a bigger ship that is harder to turn. I don't want to go back into the job market just to discover that the next big company I work for is exactly the same. I feel like that spark of joy I used to get from building a feature is gone because I can't build very impressive things anymore due to how hamstrung I am by our environment... I can't be creative in my work anymore.\n\nIs this normal for bigger companies? If so, how do you cope with it?\n\n\ntl;dr: My company's legacy codebase\/dev env is awful, I'm forced to do work in it and I hate it.

Even though it's a large company I quickly learned the team is a bit siloed and not matured.\n\nFor starters, we have daily meetings that last 3+ hours. In our call we discuss each team member's stories and progress on them, discuss any blockers. We go through each team member's stories (5 of us) which is why it takes so long and it often gets derailed into screen share sessions. A good bulk of these sessions aren't helpful to the other team members that have learned to go mute after their turn to talk.\n\nOne reason that may be behind these long meetings is a lack of a clear goal. Before every sprint our manager will create stories that he will assign to each member, which is fine, but often times it takes a few days of meetings before they're hashed out and they often change through the sprint. Team members end up \"theory crafting\" tasks for stories they don't fully understand and inflating estimates to prevent slipping. The worst is when we underestimate a task and have to cram it into the sprint which is very exhausting, or when more stories are added in the middle of the sprint. We also don't hold retrospectives or dedicate time for planning, so the majority of these stories are conceived by my manager alone.\n\nAfter our meetings we often end up firefighting issues or spending time on unplanned tasks unrelated to stories. These get brought up in the meetings, but they often don't reach the backlog and are forgotten about until they surface again. I have brought up that I think these are good potential improvements that could be made into a story, but my boss doesn't find any interest in them.\n\nI like my boss, not blaming him entirely, but it doesn't feel like we're working effectively. Long meetings, lack of concrete goals, and firefighting is exhausting. Is this how agile is supposed to be?

This place feels like group therapy lately anyway, so I felt like participating\n\nThrowaway acc for obvious reasons. For clarification, I'm from the EU, details changed to stay anonymous\n\nI started working at a bank a few months ago, and I'm struggling to find motivation to continue, and I don't think it's the bank's fault?\n\nActually, let me back up a little, or even a little bit more. First, my background is kind of half Computer Science, half math? You see, in the town I grew up in, we had two colleges. One was a \"new\" brutalist engineering college built in the 70s with a reputation of \"you will definitely get a high-paying job after graduation\". The other was an \"ancient institution\" built in one of those revival styles, you know what I mean. It had a reputation of producing many famous arts, physics, philosophy alumni and was generally regarded as a high-class institution. I grew up poor and hated high-class snobs, but when I was picking a college I had this lingering thought in my head - internet forum flame threads about whether Java or C# is better. The thought made me want to avoid learning only \"encyclopedic knowledge\" and to learn general skills instead. I felt like if I went to the \"engineering\" college, they would teach me a lot of practical things and make me a really good Java programmer, but only Java, and if one day Java 2 Electric Boogaloo comes out all coffee sipping on everyone, and none of my Java skills transferred to Java 2, I'd be effed like all those COBOL programmers. As an aside, I honestly thought COBOL programmers were old men who refused to learn new ways and were stuck in dead-end jobs, instead of the chads they truly are. So apologies to the one COBOL programmer reading this, I have learned the error in my ways.\n\nThe college I ended up picking didn't have an CS department yet, it was a spin-off of the maths department. CS already had a decade long history at the maths dept, but it was newly spun-off into its own wing and I was entering the first semester of the newly founded CS department. Things were kind of still being figured out back then, and I had to pick between a more practical and more theoretical CS degree. I was a big fan of Noam Chomsky back then, and when I saw that we'll be learning finite automata in the 2nd semester instead of the 4th semester in the more theoretical major, the decision was set. Plus I was thinking, if I'm going to the theoretical college, might as well go full theoretical? FTR I like Chomsky for his contributions to science, the genocide denial not so much.\n\nWell, in the end I don't know if it was a good decision. I know my analysis was wrong. Our dorms were partly shared between the colleges, so I met a lot of people from the other college. To surmise: the other college was teaching the same stuff, they did a few more \"big projects\" than we did, and we did much more math classes.\n\nThe programming classes were a breeze for me, the math however, I spent all of my time doing math, badly... Looking back, I was forcing myself to do something I wasn't really all that excited about. Don't get me wrong, I love math, but I think I love it more as an art piece at a gallery. I don't enjoy being the painter as much. I've never had a drive nor talent for puzzle-solving, at least not the kind some of my peers from uni had. I was always better with words than math, and in programming I was more the hackery-type. I don't mean that I'm a Kevin Mitnick or anything cybersec related (I do dabble in reverse engineering sometimes though!), more like my approach to problem solving has always been \"ok this that tomayto tomahto... and how do I break it?\", rather than dreaming about the Seven Bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg. Regardless the takeway here is that I have a lot of formal math training but (in my mind) not all that much to show for it. Therefore, don't lie to me about Lie groups! No, for real, please don't lie to me about Lie groups, I legitimately have very little recollection of them and might believe you. Also I might have PTSD from solving group theory equations. Naive me thought that algebra was king in computer science, nowadays I realise, calculus rules the world. (this is a joke, for you, calculus people)\n\nAnyway sorry for the tangent, I mean it's not unimportant but I just couldn't think of a way to say it in fewer words.\n\nNow flash forward to christmas time 2021, I was at this company for 2 and a half years then. I didn't know it back then but I hated that job with a passion. I was hired as a C# programmer to modernise some old systems and then go on to head new greenfield projects together w\/ a Junior (whom I loving   \ncalled my 'mini-me'), but in reality we ended up bugfixing a giant spaghetti of node.js microservices and others projects of the same ilk for the whole time. I was promised over and over that time for modernisation would be allocated next time, but nothing concrete ever materialised. I was paid well and it was my first \"senior\" position and I felt grateful for the experience for a long time. Especially since they hired me as a senior even though I had little experience before (at least in my mind). I think I was hired on the basis of being ballsy and creative during the interview and not being afraid of the CTO even though he's a \"big name with a C-level position\".\n\nI was kind-of lowkey already looking for a new job though, even though I kept believing them that \"it'll get better soon\". I saw the suggested raise number in my manager's Teams chat which I peeked at when nobody was looking, and it was not the kind of money that would make me tolerate some bullshit. Or in other words, not the kind of money that would fundamentally change my relationship with the employer. I opened my linkedin account back then. Again, looking back there were signs things aren't all fluffy and nice at the company. After about 1 and a half years, some of the best people in the company started leaving it. Funnily enough, at first, in the exact order that I ordered them in my head from best to worst. The first person who quit was someone who I deeply respected and taught me a lot. He was actually a skydiving instructor turned BI analyst, great guy. I regret to this day not taking him up on the beer offer after he quit and losing contact. Shortly before everything went down, my mini-me, the junior, also quit to focus on studies.\n\nSo that was the situation then, and then, after christmas, in the forest, far away from civilisation. I went skiing in the dusk \"to clear my head\" and hit some gravel during a turn, queue nasty accident, screams, birds flying and the sound of popping my dislocated shoulder back in. I remember screaming like I was being murdered, counting my losses, realising I still had cell signal though and calling my then-girlfriend. She told me to call an ambulance immediately, and I promised to do just that, and opened the local taxi app. I had 1.2km to walk to the nearest road, and it took me the 30 minutes or so to get there just as the driver was arriving. It was his last shift and I was very lucky he was so close. On the way to the hospital I looked at the data from my watch and unfortunately it didn't record the exact time of the accident, but based on the data up to the accident I estimated I was going \\~30 km\/h at the time. When I told that the admitting nurse and doctor, they repeated to me how god-awful lucky I was so many times I stopped counting. And yeah, you bet, it was my \"just one last run\". You don't have to call me an idiot, trust me, I know. Driver was nice, a giant greek grandpa who didn't read the messages I sent him and was quite surprised to find bloodied and bruised me and said he almost didn't pick me up because he was afraid it was \"some stuff he didn't want to get into\". Now that I think about it, I sat in the car's front seat and the adjustment handle didn't work so it was a little uncomfortable. From that point on, for about a week, I didn't think about my job at all. Boss sounded very concerned when I informed him, for a second I thought he actually cared about me. He was the typical middle-aged nerd who got forced into a managerial position because \"well somebody had to do it\" (and he had 3 kids and a mortgage). He drove in an expensive SUV he didn't have to finance, but was lacking in deodorants and abundant in showing his butt crack one too many times (note for therapist: another source of PTSD?)\n\nSo I laid in the hospital bed, for a week, two weeks, three weeks, it was a whole thing. By about week two I realised, I'm so unhappy at the job, it's starting to affect my health. I had to go, like now. It felt like a romantic breakup, you know? Like when you realise you don't love your partner, that you were lied to. At first, I had this weird feeling of my whole world ending, which then quickly turned into a giant feeling of relief. Like that feeling of losing a giant anchor after a break up. I think I might've been in a toxic relationship with my job. \ud83d\ude02 I decided to hold on though for a while, to have some income and attend interviews in down time. I spent the next two months working from home. Let's say the first few weeks were okay. A few busy days at first, you know, playing catch up with the jiras...\n\nThen after those few rough but rather productive weeks I found out I simply had no more discipline\/motivation. It was like the motivation generator ran out of juice and nothing could refill it. It was a similar kind of feeling that I'm feeling now. Back then I explained it thinking \"oh I'm just so excited for the next job this one doesn't interest me anymore\". Now, I don't know, I'm skeptical that that's what was happening.\n\nDuring my first quarter at that job I had a different boss, who later got fired for groping a female employee (yikes). I called him Mr. Curly Hair (sounds better in my language). The Junior wasn't hired yet then (the original hire that was supposed to start at around the same time as me withdrew his interest). Curly was a complete techno-illiterate, but had a managerial degree and knew coding a little, probably from being at the company when it was a startup. Thus, he was the manager of this \"team\" of disparate positions (we were essentially all doing different things and didn't sit together or even talk at all). It was supposed to be a temporary solution before the person who was supposed to be my actual boss returned from parental leave, and it was, so I didn't mind it back then, but Curly Hair was [unable to judge the difficulty of tasks at all](https:\/\/xkcd.com\/1425\/). Once, I got yelled at for taking a week to solve a \"one line problem\", which was in reality was a set of very difficult to reproduce bugs, I hotfixed it by increasing some timeouts and I wasn't given more time to actually fix it, hence why he thought it's a \"one line problem\". Then that very same month, I was praised for solving an issue quickly that he thought was hard, and wasn't. He even sent a positive appraisal to upper management. I don't even remember what it was, think moving a button hover effect with CSS.\n\nBut it was those experience (and those two especially) that made me realise, nobody actually checked my work aside from some internal company users who really didn't give a damn about the projects I was working on. More than a year and 3 new bosses later things weren't different.\n\nAbout a month after the accident, one day I just didn't work, at all. I joined the morning standup, and the next day I said I was working on this and that, and nobody checked. So I decided to say fuck it, I'll just pretend I'm working and use this time to find another job, they don't seem to care anyway. After a month and some time, I had two jobs lined up, one at a fintech startup where they really seemed to want me but I wasn't fully sure about, and one which was more of a \"backup\".\n\nIt took them a little under 2 months to realise I essentially \"quietly quit\". I thought they'll make a big deal out of it or be mad. My boss didn't even know I stopped working, he just said that he \"saw in me that I wanted to quit\". Actually, I made a few commits in that time, like css changes or super simple tasks like typo fixes.\n\nThe firing went like this, I was no longer bed-bound but still recovering at the time, but able to move, and they called me in to the office for a 'big meeting' (there actually was a scheduled quarterly meeting as well, but I didn't attend that one). I was 50\/50 if they're about to fire me honestly. I was a little surprised they did. However, it went much better than I expected. Basically they said that they trusted me, but that just to be sure, they'll give me a giant (in my eyes) compensation package, so that it doesn't seem like they fired me because of my accident. About 3\/4 of the \"golden parachute\" money was money I was contractually owed when being fired anyway, but they paid for the vacation time, gave me my work phone for free and gave me an extra 2 months of wages. Technically the 2 months were a \"consultancy fee\" and I was contractually obliged to help them with whatever problems they might have with the big systems I worked with, but they gave me the paper to sign and promised they will never bother me, that it's just a small \"bonus\" for cooperating. And to their credit they didn't bother me after that. I believe it was company practice to give this to all fired employees, but managers were actually expected to use the \"former employee consultancy\". It was actually great because in the contract you were only obliged to work 8 hours a week or 32 hours a month maximum, and if they wanted you to work more than those hours then you could negotiate your own hourly rate with an arbiter ('employee representative') present. And all that was on top of the 2 full monthly wages I received in advance just for the option to 'force' me to work for them after the employment contract. I wish more companies did this, actually, seemed not only fair at the time (maybe this is common in some industries?) but also generous.\n\nRegardless, the golden parachute changed things. I bought a few fancy things for my soon-to-be wife and then decided to just focus on finding my dream job. I declined the job offer I got before (the backup offer wasn't really an offer even though the potential boss\/interviewee told me they want me, it was still stuck in HR), and contacted all the dream job places I could think of. I burned through much of my savings in the 3 months after. Our car broke down, rent is expensive, and utilities shot through the roof in 2022... Finally, it was between a small 3d educational app startup, and a small family company with 30 years of history releasing a suite of niche mechanical engineering applications. The startup sounded like they needed a math guy and I just wasn't feeling it, so I picked the family company. For a while I honestly felt that it was worth it, I found my dream job...\n\nBoy oh boy was that a mistake. I will keep it brief. It was technically a remote job even though I was going to the office every day. Most of everyone else was working from home. 4 months later a few 60+ year old coworkers whom I've never met whispered in the ear of the CEO\/founder that I'm too young to earn this much money, and that I'm performing below expectations. It wasn't even that much money, I don't know how much they expected my wage to be, maybe they didn't notice inflation exists. My wage there was just \\~250$ more than what I was getting at my previous job, and with inflation it was actually less. First there were talks about lowering my wage. Then, I was told that if I don't quit on my own, they'll fire me, and then they'll say I introduced some bugs which cost them money and I'll be contractually obligated to repay them. There were no bugs of course, but the part about repaying damage to the company really was in the contract. I was hurt, I've never felt so betrayed. I know they are cheating on taxes so I anonymously reported them with receipts, half out of spite, half out of a sudden feeling of a citizen's obligation (okay, it was 100% spite). Our tax office doesn't fuck around and I hope they will f\\*ck them to death. Our police and justice system though... I didn't have receipts for what they said, it was all said in closed meetings. I can't imagine what they would actually do if I didn't quit but I didn't care to find out. There were people there whom I already considered friends, we went to the pub every friday after work. Honestly I would've never admitted it then but it really messed me up big time. I decided to just quit and focus on getting any job that will hire me as soon as possible\n\nSo (skipping a few things) that's how I ended up at the bank. I was luckily one of the last 3 people hired that year as the next month the department was hit by a hiring freeze.\n\nHere's how money comes into play. The point is, my ex-gf aka wifey wants a big house and kids. I don't really care much for money, don't care for working at a bank or not, I was excited to work on the projects they were selling to me during the interview. I felt like it was perfect for me, some of my math skills are needed but not all math the time. And the wage increase covered the inflation plus 20% which for us was literally life changing money. I had no way of saving up for a house in this economy before, and now I actually have a chance of... Of saving up for the mortgage downpayment in 15 years or so. But hey it's at least no longer impossible, and if my career advances more it might be more feasible, provided kids don't come earlier than expected. Also wifey, bless her heart, promised to help with it financially even with her measely teacher's wage.\n\nAt any rate we come to present day. Like I said, it's been a few months. I was so excited at the start, I wanted to start programming day 1 but of course they said things move slowly at the bank. But I never expected it to be this slow. Basic things like laptop setup, visual studio, admin access, git access and so on weren't done on day 1 like I was used to. They weren't done on day 2, week 2, month 2. They were done on the last day of January. I started actually working only 3 days later because my manager didn't have time to assign me tasks. In the time between I had a million new joiner tutorials and meetings, bunch of trainings, a million safety and financial law trainings. One day, I felt like I lost motivation, I worked for a few anxious hours but just gave up halfway through. I don't know why. Like I wrote above, it feels eerily similar to what happened before. I don't know what I'm doing honestly, I think I lost my sense of self or direction or whatever. I don't want to work just for money, it makes no sense to me.\n\nIn a way working for money is working for the house, for my wife, but, I don't know, my brain just doesn't want to do this. The waiting for visual studio was just too long. I got paid for doing nothing for several months, it doesn't sit well with me. Or okay I was doing lectures and stuff for part of it. Kind of felt like being back at the college for a while.\n\nAnyway, what are your experiences of working at a bank? How do you find the discipline\/motivation?

I\u2019ve been working in a position that is, in practice, fully remote. Pay is good, I am learning a lot more and gaining a ton of confidence where I work at. I got an amazing manager, life is good and things couldn\u2019t be better. Sure I could earn more maybe, but I don\u2019t really need it, and I\u2019m at the high end of earners in my country anyways (high middle class if it helps).\n\nMy company was acquired by another one. To the surprise of no one, a massive layoff happened, and of course I not only escaped unscathed from it, I also got a retention bonus on top of it to be paid next year at the latest depending on how much time I stay here. As it is, I am probably the most senior in my team right now not counting my manager. My team was downsized by half, and during the next few months doing work will be difficult since we no longer will have the same output as usual.\n\nHigh management asserts that no new massive layoffs are upcoming in the short term and that moving forward they want to consolidate what we have before ramping up. I feel threatened by all of these uncertainties. We need to rebuild our product roadmap, finish off our current projects as soon as possible, there is an entirely new style of working, and worse, the company explicitly stated they want to expand the amount of workers in a different continent since there is where they have their headquarters.\n\nI love working on what we\u2019re working at.

Our customers are mostly state and local governments which means pretty rigid contracts for projects and almost every project has several requirements which are unique to that customer and dictated by that customer's local laws (ie non negotiable). On top of that some of our products deal with sensitive information such as court documents which are also partly public and bugs which cause the incorrect amount to be made public (either too much or too little) can result in lawsuits against the company and potentially damaging the lives of people affected by that information. So testing and clear requirements are very important.\n\nAbout a year ago I was tasked with leading some junior engineers in development of a new version of one of our \"products\". I say \"product\" because it was almost entirely custom built for each client using database stored procedures which took a long time to build and was basically impossible to test well. The ask was for a base product which would include some standard functionality and allow the addition of the customer specific customizations with minimal effort. I believe we have implemented a good design of a highly polymorphic application which allows the creation of customer specific extensions of practically any individual component. We have automated tests which can test both the base and each customer extension within the same codebase including 800+ parameterized test cases just for the logic of what things are and aren't made public.\n\nBut upper management isn't satisfied with this. They don't want us to be always building customer extensions, they want us to build a system where a tech lead can put all the rules and unique requirements into a config file that will configure the system for the specific customer. Their reasoning seems to be that the tech leads could encode all those rules faster and without using engineering resources, freeing us to do other projects. To top it off there are no product managers at my job. The middle managers are given some product to manage the development of but they don't know the product domain at all and they don't have the authority to decide what features should do, the tech leads don't have the authority either and don't actually lead anything, and the authority for feature decisions is held by the cto who is far too busy to disseminate their product vision to the people actually implementing it.\n\nSo for the past few months I have been flatly refusing to change the design to one where all the business rules are parsed out of a giant config file on the grounds that it's just coding with a different name, is extremely difficult to test and debug, will almost certainly take longer than the current extension design, will almost certainly not free up engineering resources for other projects, and if the tech leads have enough time to effectively do the coding of the actual logic then have them actually lead the development of these products so we don't waste weeks just trying to figure out what one feature is supposed to do.\n\nThis seems like a strange hill to die on and I'm wondering if my stubbornness has gone past the point of stupidity.

The company is a mature startup that went through rapid growth early last year, then a bit of a slowdown late last year, but it looks like we're back on track to resume hiring soon.\n\nI report to the CTO and at our last 1x1 he mentioned wanting to talk about career progression and setting goals for me to reach EM2. The thing is, I'm not enjoying being a manager and ideally I'd go back to some sort of IC role. I always enjoyed my work at the company as an IC and I liked my EM role early on when the team and company was much smaller and it was more hands on and I had time to also engage in technical leadership. \n\nI currently manage 7 direct reports, 3 of which were hired in the last year. It had been 8 reports, but the only engineer on the team with more technical expertise than myself left five months ago and I haven't had approval for a backfill since. I have two other senior engineers on my team, they are both solid engineers but also on the greener side of senior and can't quite fill the void in technical leadership from the other senior leaving.\n\nAdditionally, my product manager was promoted about 9 months ago, we hired a backfill who we quickly realized wouldn't work out and let them go, soon after the company reorganized the product team and a few PMs were let go and another left and we haven't been able to backfill for any of the product positions yet either. At this point, we essentially have one product person filling 4 roles and some of the slack has to be picked up by EMs and by senior engineers leading projects.\n\nI'm officially not on any on call rotation, but there are occasionally time sensitive incidents with massive risk that are escalated to me, and often I am the only person that is capable of resolving them  in the amount of time required to avert a catastrophe. The complexity in addressing these sort of incidents and the likelihood of them occurring could be massively reduced if we would dedicate some resources to paying down tech debt in certain areas. \n\nSo, I'm in a spot where I have to fulfill all my EM responsibilities for a fairly large team, but I also need to handle a lot of things that would have fallen to my PM in the past and I often need to fill the role of a tech lead for my team as well. Like I mentioned before, we're starting hiring again, but I don't know how long it will take to backfill for a PM and tech lead and even if we do fill those roles it will take a while for them to ramp up. I'm at a point where I already feel burnt out, I'm doing a lot of different jobs and I don't feel like I'm doing any of them well. I have already delegated a lot to my senior engineers and if I give them much more it would end up taking away from higher priority work.\n\nMy team is responsible for one of the most complex and critical domains for the business and I am by far the strongest subject matter expert in that domain, I also have wide expertise around much of our backend and a lot of expertise with our particular tech stack. I honestly feel like I could be much more of a force multiplier in ramping up new engineers, reducing development friction, decreasing incidents and their risk, improving our engineering strategy, and so on if I didn't have my management responsibilities and was back in some sort of IC\/tech leadership role.\n\nI mostly don't find management interesting or rewarding, I don't think this role plays to my strengths or interests and I do think I can be more valuable in a different role. I enjoy tech leadership, mentoring and training engineers, and trying to solve higher level strategic engineering problems. I also enjoy hands on solving difficult technical challenges\n\nI want to propose to the CTO that I switch to some sort of tech leadership role where I can focus on those sort of things and that we instead use the headcount to find a new EM for the team. I'd ideally like to be in a role where I am focused on solving higher level strategic engineering problems rather than typical feature work, but I'd prefer feature work to management if it came down to that. The CTO and I have a good relationship and I believe he understands my value and trusts me, but I don't know how he'll react to my request. Also, despite my frustrations in this particular role, I generally believe in the company, like the people I work with, and I feel like I have been an important contributor to its success and would like to see it through to a possible exit some day, but I will look for a new job if I have to stay in an EM role.\n\nHas anyone else gone through an experience like this?

They do this by connecting to MongoDB and manipulating documents used by core\\_app.   \n\nNow the (obvious) problem arises: core\\_app slightly changes its database (document) schema and all of a sudden, mgmt\\_app is writing broken documents into the database.   \n\nI know this shouldn't be a hard problem but a bunch of confused managers are making a big deal of this, trying to fix the problem. I'm currently not working directly on this project and don't want to get involved but I still like to think about good solutions.   \n\nThe obvious solution, from my perspective would be to use a simple CRUD application that handles all DB reads\/writes. The CRUD app also does all validation (mandatiry\/opt fields, ...) and exposes its api via OpenAPI, so both Golang and Java developers can easily consume it.     \nOne variant would be adding the CRUD api directly to the core\\_app.   \n\nAnyway, am I being too pedantic here? Is it common for different apps to read\/write each-other's database schemas or is this horrible?\n\nEDIT: I see I'm being downvoted a lot.

Do you need everyone who is hired on to have experience working on big games running on UE, or just a few key architects and leads?\n\nI can't even begin to imagine the undertaking of building such a huge codebase as these large open-world games - but how much of it is actually written by the team? How much of it is already built into the engine? Just how similar is this game to Skyrim, or Witcher 3, RDR, or other recent open-world games? Are the performance issues seen in the new Hogwarts game an indicator of inexperience?\n\nI'm coming at it from this perspective - I'm familiar with, say, web, and how there are a few monolithic JS frameworks (plus WordPress!) which drive a good chunk of the web. Now, I think it's safe to say that a framework like UE4 or Unity plays much of the same role. On top of the web framework, most people are doing generally the same thing, and generally are implementing it in similar ways. Is this roughly the same in game dev? Are we just talking about FAANG companies who have those ridiculously talented people who have been working with\/developing from the ground up these huge frameworks, who are able to eek out that little bit extra in performance, or integration, vs. smaller start-ups - is that what we're seeing here with big AAA games vs. newer studios who do things 98% right, but have issues with some of the more specialized stuff?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry, it feels like one big tangent, but lately I'm just really curious about how this sister industry chugs along.

I also asked what would be the appropriate channel to share health-related information over.**\n\nGot no reply for 3 days, 2 days until the interview is coming up. I get anxious.

Two hours before the interview should have happened, I receive an email from the recruiter stating that the software engineer who was meant to interview me got sick and asked me to submit my new availability.\n\nI submit my new availability.

I lay on my bed, can't sleep, remember what happened and **get angry**. I go on Glassdoor and post a very strongly worded Interview feedback about it.\n\nBut I felt that wasn't enough. I went on LinkedIn and messaged the CTO himself. Something along the lines \"I am writing to inform you of, in my opinion, a possible issue of systematic discrimination at your company. I'll simply copy-paste the Glassdoor review that should be live soon.\"\n\nI was assigning a very high probability to either \"canned extra-reviewed-by-Legal-and-Comms reply\" or no reply.\n\nBut he actually replied with quite a humble and apologetic attitude. It seemed to me that he feels that they failed to hold the interviewing process to the high standards that they have for it to be an amazing experience. Besides this, he gave me a bit of background: they have only two engineers that conduct interviews for that specific team - one of them was OOO and the other sick. He acknowledged that this isn't a good excuse and that he'll make sure this never happens again.\n\nKeeping it super polite, friendly, and apologetic, he offered, if I was still open, for me to continue the interviewing process and to receive accommodations. Specifically, I exemplified in the Glassdoor review that I was imagining for a 15-minute extension to the duration of the tech interview and he offered this.\n\nThey don't have much stuff on their Glassdoor, so my review is of high visibility.\n\nNow here comes my moral dilemma:\n\n* If they did discriminate, I do want to raise awareness about it, at least on Glassdoor and internally since I guess it very likely wasn't a top-bottom conspiracy or something like that.\n* If they did not discriminate, I do not want my Glassdoor review to possibly unfairly drive away candidates from their company and for the company to suffer for it (e.g. I very frequently just pass on a small company the first detailed negative review that I see).\n* If I go through with the interviewing process and get hired, I would instantly be on sour terms with my boss and the recruiter, given that I have accused them of discrimination publicly online and directly to the actual CTO of the company. Besides this, I probably would start with very low political capital and be known as \"the guy who flipped his shit over stale email\".\n* If I don't go through with it and just move on, I might miss on something real cool.\n\nAs a last bit, I am not based in the US. I live in Europe.\n\nDid I fuck it up by jumping to conclusions? I am quite unsure if the intention really was to discriminate and maybe they really did have a planning \/ communications failure.\n\nAny shared thoughts would be very appreciated.\n\nEDIT: For clarification, they have ~260 employees on LinkedIn as of now. HR seems to be all in-house. Just 10% growth in the past 6 months.","upvote_ratio":0.38,"created_utc":1677012352.0},{"title":"\"Off the record\" virtual meetup with Dir of Eng at Slack.","author":"efunction","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ExperiencedDevs\/comments\/118atup\/off_the_record_virtual_meetup_with_dir_of_eng_at\/","text":"Hi, everyone.

Most of my career I\u2019ve been hired\/promoted based on inherent skill. I pursued promotions, but only at a \u201cplz give me one\u201d level of granularity.\n\nI am now trying the following - it\u2019s hard, and I wonder how others manage this:\n\n- keeping a brag log; so I can summarize key events often invisible to my manager unless I tell them. I am now trying to correlate entries to specific next-role behaviors in the company manual.\n\n- pay more attention to my visibility - see a small event with my bosses boss or their boss (vp)? Go to it. My promo has to get approved at their levels so they should minimally remember my face if not my team\u2019s project work.\n\n- manage perception - I hate to admit it, but you promo based off perceptions and beliefs of others. First, fellow peers must perceive you are already at the next level - this helps your boss avoid offending others by promoting someone too \u201cgreen\u201d to their level. Also, peers give feedback at my company that affects end year rating. Secondly, manage your manager\u2019s perception. Choose 1:1 items carefully to highlight your excellence in dealing with ambiguity, and give them some sense of the complexity you shield them from. Don\u2019t be silent in meetings and take offline notes to digest and followup later, talk and inject opinion - silent people get mischaracterized as disengaged or not courageous, people who engage (even on a borderline performative basis) can avoid this problem.\n\nPerception management is the hardest for me. But my manager effectively said this is what I need to work on. I feel like just doing good work is what matters, but I do see the politics of it - you don\u2019t promo into higher level leadership levels without directly managing what people see of you.\n\nBy the way, do be aware your manager is incentivized in some cases to under-state your performance and say \u201cdo more of this <horoscope level of detail> thing to promote\u201d. This slows you down so they can pace you into available promo slots for each fiscal increment they are allowed to promote (otherwise you both agree you are ready to promo, and they get stuck waiting, you get frustrated and leave). So I\u2019ve also been trying to hold my manager more accountable to guiding me to get to promo in 1:1s. Steer your manager out of logistical conversations and on to career mentorship. Managers can be very busy (especially director level, they may sometimes be more invested in business relationships than their own engineering org) and so there is a \u201ckeep this in forefront of their mind\u201d element where you literally don\u2019t want them to forget the urgency of promoting you. If you don\u2019t engage regularly, it\u2019s easier for them to slow roll you because it means less trouble for them. Terminal seniors \/ line managers are easier to manage, you don\u2019t have to go to bat for them, you just keep them doing good work and keep them happy in smaller ways. Don\u2019t get classified as those if you want to keep moving.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1676820721.0},{"title":"Job satisfaction of those in embedded software roles","author":"climbbikehike","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ExperiencedDevs\/comments\/116ptm1\/job_satisfaction_of_those_in_embedded_software\/","text":"I've been in the industry almost 4 years now and have bounced from UI to backend heavy work.

In the eyes of the founders, these represent excellent decisions that saved money and aligned the tech teams with the business. \n\nIn other B2B businesses, UX was nice, but not critical.  There was vendor lock-in, but we operated in a space with limited competition and the quality of our work was more important. We never offered live streaming and much of our work could be processed offline and presented to the businesses with low refresh rates (no more than 6 hours). Anything businesses wanted would be communicated to product teams and would be built into our batch pipelines. Again, these decisions are the right ones - the work required to get to a streaming ML platform would not amortize across the customers and wouldn't provide a competitive advantage.\n\nNow this is no longer true for a consumer facing company. UX is king and getting say youtube recommendations once per day would probably not be a great experience. You should be able to use chatgpt interactively and not get the result tomorrow. \n\n\nBut I guess where does that leave someone like me? I can read all the systems design interview textbooks and treat them like leetcode until I can talk about scaling and microservices like I'm learning to invert a binary tree, but this leaves me feeling that these systems design interviews that decide your level leaves someone with my skills unable to get into a web company, and not because I can't bring useful skills, but because the systems design interview implicitly assumes that the candidate has worked in webtech before. The interview I just went to told me I couldn't query the customer db because it would cause a lot of load and the team in charge of that db didn't provide said guarantee and that I should use S3 as a backend. I was told there was a design pattern I should use to solve this particular problem. \n\nDoes it just mean I have to play the game and pretend until I stumble pass the finish line or stay in my lane of b2b\/internal research teams. It seems unsatisfying that the only way to get into a webtech company is to have already been in webtech (weirdly enough trading is the most unbothered about taking in people with no domain experience). \n\nAs an aside, I run a systems design interview which is to basically build up hadoop from scratch to run on the office PCs that sit idle overnight (in this example they use linux and can assume they have the correct security). This question scales incredibly well because it tests fundamentals. We can start with any kind of queueing solution, a simple bit of code that runs on the prime node to accept jobs and then farm them out to the rest of the nodes, which allows for discussion of the messaging protocol and how to handle errors. The interview is mostly me finding the worst case scenarios for the given design and seeing how the candidate goes about solving it. I've had excelllent answers from SREs with multi-cloud experience, to fresh grads who built most of the architecture using the python stdlib for all of it, and the opposite too - someone who could only design using AWS services (I learned more about AWS services from these interviews than from the AWS reps) and had no idea how to build a queue from scratch. More senior candidates are able to bake in much more error handling and protection as well as are able to roll with punches much faster, though very few ever consider operational considerations and how that aligns with the business. I use all the interviews (sys design, code review, short presentation of an ML  algo in depth, ML interview - loss function analysis for a range of problems, coding task - write tests, code naive solution, discuss optimal solution) to decide the level the candidate operates at since there are many archetypes of engineers in ML that may have strong ML, weak sys design or strong coding + sys design, but surface level ML. All the archetypes are quite valuable and a good mix is necessary for an effective team.","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1676603231.0},{"title":"How to work constructively with \"good enough\" engineers? Or quit?","author":"brodega","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ExperiencedDevs\/comments\/113th66\/how_to_work_constructively_with_good_enough\/","text":"Over the years, I've worked with various engineers who write \"good enough\" code and push back hard in code review when asked for changes. The argument typically goes \"It works fine\" unless there is something obviously breaking. On my current team I have run into two of these types of engineers.\n\nDuring code review I constantly have to address very basic problems. For example:\n\n```\nconst firstItem = feed?.items?[0];\n```\n\n> Reviewer: Let's avoid creating references from hardcoded indexes. Looks like the feed may not even exist. And if it does, it may not have any items in the list, so the index will be out of bounds. If you know the feed and items should always exist, please update these types to reflect that. If not, lets add a default case as close to the API boundary as possible, so we don't have to do this in multiple places across the UI.\n\n> Engineer: I don't think thats necessary. We should always have a feed - if not, the whole UI would break - and I know that this query will always return at least one feed item. We don't do this anywhere else, so I can just add the default case here to keep it simple.\n\n\n```\nconst ratio = selected!.items!.length \/ feed?.items?.length\n```\n\n> Reviewer: Are all of these properties actually nullish? Please check the types to make sure they reflect the data model, and lets avoid making non-null assertions. If they are nullish, this could lead to bugs where we either the numerator or denominator could be undefined. Let's pull this logic into a separate function where we can handle these edge cases and add unit tests to cover the undefined and divide-by-zero cases.\n\n> Engineer: I don't think thats necessary. The selected items should always exist, not sure why they are nullish, so I added the assertions to get the build to pass. Also, the API guarantees at least one item will be in the list, so I don't think we need to worry about handling a case where there isn't.\n\nI work at a FAANG and tbh I was surprised to even be giving this feedback to begin with - at my last job I would have gotten ROASTED for submitting this code to begin with. It seems like these engineers view any sort of feedback as \"nits\", and will circumvent comments by going to other team members to approve PRs. This has lead to a lot of cruft in our codebase and we are constantly have to put out hotfixes for runtime errors. My manager is very hands off and when I've spoken to him about this in 1:1s, he basically says he's aware of the tech debt but we need to agree on a solution collectively. But getting the other engineers to admit that there even is a problem has been fruitless\n\nGetting into this company took almost 3 months and I had like 5 intense technical rounds, so its kind of mind boggling to be handling such basic stuff but I'm stuck on this team for the next year. Right now like 90% of my time is spent debugging these kinds of avoidable errors that often our own users are catching before us!\n\nI can only think of a couple ways forward.\n\n- Stop doing code review entirely and just focus on my own tickets until I qualify for a transfer.\n- Add comments and let myself be overridden but don't approve PRs. If something breaks, at least there is a record of me surfacing the problem. Apply for a transfer.\n- Start interviewing. I could probably find another job in the Bay Area pretty quickly.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1676562016.0},{"title":"Personality tests?","author":"weevhy","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ExperiencedDevs\/comments\/11440ig\/personality_tests\/","text":"What's with this approach lately?

I don\u2019t know what paths are available to me from here aside from continuing to take on responsibility and lead bigger projects. Like, even if I know DDIA front to back I know as soon as I get a different backend job it\u2019ll be more of the same. Maybe in 6 years we\u2019ll have to decide between mongo and postgres, and then boredom resumes until 2035.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLong story short I find the day to day minutia of software engineering boring. I enjoy writing software sometimes (dislike frontend, backend is bearable but still gets boring). I just hate the human side of it - the endless debate over the smallest thing in the name of code quality. To be clear I\u2018m happy to work with others, I want to work with them on technically interesting things and not code quality. I get that it\u2019s an important area for the health of the codebase, but I just don\u2019t give a shit \\[to an extent\\] about where we draw the lines around our services. I don\u2019t care if a service should be broken up into a few smaller services. I don\u2019t care if each DB model DTO should have its own file or if we can group it together with other related files. I don\u2019t care if we should be storing functions that components will use in context or if they should be passed down through props from the parent. I don\u2019t care about writing tests (I do it though, as with all of these I understand the importance). It\u2019s like just pick something decent and move on, we don\u2019t need 5 people chiming in with 17 comments on the PR. I\u2019m mindful of all these things when writing code because that\u2019s why I\u2019m paid, it\u2019s just such a slog. The other half of my job is just meetings, alignment, blah blah.\n\nIt\u2019s not wrong to care about those things, I\u2019m aware that they all add up to making the codebase more maintainable in the long run. My current codebase is\u2026 pretty bad so I feel the pain. That\u2019s just not where my passion is when it comes to this stuff. In school I enjoyed learning DS&A as it was actually mentally stimulating for me. I like writing c, the fact that I can shoot myself in the foot is fun.\n\nI look around at my career options and it\u2019s \u201cbecome more senior\u201d, which is more of the same (lead bigger projects AKA be even more of a Jira master, cross team initiatives + alignment meetings, learn more about organizational code quality, DDD type stuff, etc). Is there even a path for deep technical work anywhere? The staff engineers everywhere I\u2019ve worked have been focused on code quality across the organization. How do we increase velocity, solve developer pain points, lint against common mistakes, etc.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m wondering if I need to just go back to school for something else. I don\u2019t fit in with other developers - I like writing code but I don\u2019t enjoy the same aspects of it as others do. I got into this for the machine part but 99% of the day to day is optimizing writing for humans. I feel like I\u2019m 40% product manager and 60% human mind reader.","upvote_ratio":0.73,"created_utc":1676610188.0},{"title":"What are the not-so-obvious tools that you don't want to miss?","author":"FattySuperCute","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ExperiencedDevs\/comments\/113syrn\/what_are_the_notsoobvious_tools_that_you_dont\/","text":"Hi folks!\n\nI'm using the same tools (IDE, password manager, ...) for years and would like to get some inspiration.

We are both early engineers in the company.\n\nLonewolf is engaged in a vicious cycle that ultimately produces a fair amount of organizational risk:\n\n1. Lonewolf has (usually good) proposals & principles\n2. Lonewolf does not communicate them effectively\n3. Others do things that violate those principles or make those proposals harder (usually unknowingly)\n4. Lonewolf will complete them anyway even if they do it alone, quickly, and with little oversight in order to try and preempt (3)\n\nThis developer simply does not (or can not) communicate problems and solutions to the extent required in order to get meaningful feedback or buy-in for their proposals - either to eng or product. \n\nThey speak quickly, very abstractly, and use unintuitive terminology that they invent for the domain. They don't frame proposals well, like breaking them into \"background\", \"problem\", and \"solution\". For example, they may deliver a specification out of the blue that lists 10-15 endpoints with detailed schemas, but it may have only a sentence or two about what the proposal is meant to solve.\n\nDespite (or because of) this, they often settle for \"tacit buy-in\" (i.e. no questions at the end of a 45 minute monologue delivered at 1.5x speed means their proposal is great). They are plenty knowledgeable and capable enough of doing all of the implementation themselves, so they do not need buy-in to accomplish their goals.\n\nDespite these issues, this developer is generally a pleasure to work with, and I think they have mostly good ideas. They are very personable and are a good programming mentor to the junior folks.\n\nThe issues I believe they cause for our company are:\n\n* Lots of bus-factor=1 products (ramp up, and on-call is a huge issue)\n* They continuously monitor their pet-projects, because they cannot educate & trust others to look after them\n* Their time is being spent on things for which there is no organizational consent\n* Their proposals are under-scrutinized (e.g. Lonewolf often ignores open-source implementations)\n* Other devs have no sense of ownership (many things are a \"Lonewolf special\" that others don't touch)\n\nWe do 2 week sprints, but Lonewolf will frequently create tickets and then complete them inside of the same sprint so there isn't much opportunity for oversight.\n\nI've also suggested requiring others contribute to Lonewolf's projects, rather than them doing all the work for the other teams. That is when Lonewolf explained that they don't think PMs will allow other teammembers to work on their projects (and so Lonewofl must do it themself -- i.e. \"I can't convince others this is valuable enough to work on, so I will just spend all of my time doing it myself\").\n\nShort of forbidding work that I haven't explicitly understood and signed off on (terrible for morale), I would love to hear how others have dealt with engineers like this. \n\nThe bright side is that this engineer is easy to talk to and we have a good working relationship, and they are aware of their communication difficulties.","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1676542629.0},{"title":"Recruiting agencies asking for extremely sensitive info... just don't - how is this even legal?","author":"quiubity","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ExperiencedDevs\/comments\/113z0uu\/recruiting_agencies_asking_for_extremely\/","text":"I've been applying to contractor roles and one of the biggest things that has stood out to me is recruiters\/agencies asking for your DOB and last four digits of your SSN.\n\nSome places claim that it's for \"creating an applicant profile to submit for the role\".\n\nHowever, this isn't consistent, even for different agencies recruiting for the same place.\n\nAs a matter of fact, I told someone yesterday who was persistent on getting this information from me \"so they could move forward with my application\" to go kick rocks and that if they cannot submit my application without this information, then I'll pass.

He had that priority queue solution in his mind and he was trying to get me to code up a priority queue. Obviously he was against the idea of creating a PQ from scratch.

I don't really care for the industry the business is in. Small layoffs this year (< 10 people), annual bonus canceled, benefits cut. They are in a very competitive industry which I'm not sure that they long term can win but probably survive. That also reflects on my valuation of the equity I have - I don't think it's worth much even though they're \"preparing\" for an IPO for many years now. My manager is the best I've ever had. Coworkers are nice. Having some downtime a few nights a year is no big deal. I can take time off freely. I do feel like I've peaked at here. Since I don't care about the industry I can't offer any business insights with them. Chance of layoffs: moderate but for good engineers between moderate and low.\n\nI have 2 young kids and I try to keep engaging in a few hobbies multiple times per week. I need remote or to find something in the small metro which doesn't pay as well as the coasts. At my current company I transitioned from hybrid to fully remote last year and they're fine with it especially since I know how to tweak many of the systems so it's just at a minimum - handy to keep me around.\n\nTrying to save for a house and to retire early maybe, so I do tend to look for something like \"market rate\" which is still a very wide range.\n\nJob 2 would be a comparable role in an old passion, not as much anymore but my resume can get interviews at those companies and the interviews are not LeetCode which I don't feel like cramming right now. Low-ish chance of layoffs - their latest product is growing well. They're looking for engineers to grow into bigger roles because they're absorbing a lot of new people. Hiring does seem to be frozen after these last hires though.\n\nJob 3 - general tech company that pays well. This is all the Stripes and Googles and Metas and Netflixes and Databrickses. Hard to get in but pays the best. Moderate chance of more layoffs this year.\n\nJob 4 - current passion industry. Not as software heavy, they're often not the most essential part of the business but still has clear synergy with the core business. Hard to find openings at current software salary levels and very rarely remote. Chance for layoffs: miniscule.\n\nI would appreciate anyones thinking of such a scenario or if they've been through something similar in their longer career. I've been working for 15 years now, trying to improve every year and I do have some choice probably.

If someone raises concern, they are squashed quickly saying oh, its not a big deal, we can fix it just by doing X.  \n\\- If things we missed before are identified, the EM's expectation is that it should just be fixed on the same timeline even though that causes scope creep.  \n\\- We line up new projects one after the other and give ourselves only a couple of days to test features E2E (ok for small ones).

It was kind of an easy job. I just wrote very complicated SQL and PL\/SQL for data manipulation and creating data pipelines. It was on-premises Oracle server, so no cloud experience there. \n\nI recently transitioned into full stack software engineering role ~7 months ago. The tech stack we use is Angular on the frontend and Node with Typescript on the backend with AWS serverless technologies. \n\nI am struggling in this job because the world of software engineering is very new to me. I have never created a fullstack website without following a YouTube tutorial. I had also never written unit tests or integration tests or used cloud technologies prior to this job. I had never used version control with branches and PRs and code reviews either prior to this job. Basically, every single software engineering thing is new to me except for things related to databases. I frequently have to ask senior co-workers for help. If the seniors don\u2019t help me when I am stuck, which is often, I can\u2019t figure out what to do. I am paid like a mid-level dev, but I work like a junior. It makes me anxious\/stressed, and I frequently think of going back to database development.\n\nHowever, I personally know I have been learning a lot, which I am happy about, and I don\u2019t want to stop that. I am frequently anxious about my incompetency, but I know every day, I am getting slightly better at software engineering, which I like. I have learned a little bit of a lot of things over the past 7 months - docker, AWS (with infrastructure as code), git, typescript, node, unit\/integration testing, and other general web development things. I am putting in 8-10 hours of work every day and sometimes even work ~4 hours on the weekends because I just want to get my tickets done, and look somewhat competent in front of my team. I feel burnt out some times, but mostly I feel fine. \n\nIf I try to learn something independently outside of work, then I have noticed I have no energy\/motivation for it anymore. For example, I want to get a AWS cert, but every time I seat down to study for it, I feel tired. I know this is because I already work a lot for my job. I don\u2019t really blame myself for this.\n\nHaving said all of this, I still have a lot to learn to meet my team\u2019s and my own expectations of me being a mid-level developer. **What do you consider a mid-level fullstack developer should know? I want to have a list of \u201cmust-know\u201d for a mid-level fullstack developer, and put extra focus on it at work and also outside of work.

There were times before where I gave people tasks to do, but it's the first time I actually have to mentor someone.\n\nIt's a small but quickly growing company. I am the lead of the Machine Learning team, which includes just me and this junior guy. Let's call him Alex. My work and vision is to build the machine learning competence of the company. Currently, there is none. We have to do the objective setting\/planning\/managing requirements work, the data engineering work, the dev-ops work, the dev work, and the ML work. Not for all the company, but for our part. It's an alright job for me (great in fact!), but...\n\nThis guy is really green. It's his second job. I assumed that he, having a year of experience at a previous job, would know the basics. But his previous job included writing crappy selenium parsers and from what he said there was not a single line of tests in the company. Essentially he came as a blank slate with some entry-level knowledge of programming and necessary tools.\n\nThere are tons of things to do with all kinds of tools and no established processes. There are no specialized tasks. For Alex those tasks range from making some API endpoints to moving some small part of a service into a separate microservice to setting up some periodic jobs to writing SQL\/SQLAlchemy queries to configuring NGINX to chasing down a bug. All just regular tasks for me, but it's quite hard for him.\n\nThe guy lacks systems-based thinking. Example: we have a storage thing and a data labeling thing. Stuff gets sent from the storage thing to the data labeling thing. Before I came the company had him try to do some ML. So he needed things from the storage thing combined with labels from the labeling thing. He ended up matching something like 1700+ examples of things **by hand**. Physically looking at the storage thing UI, finding the relevant thing in the labeling UI, and writing down the label. When I asked him: why not just make a script to do it? His idea then was to use selenium to parse the UI of the storage thing. But we own the thing and it has an API! \n\nAlso, the guy is really slow. He takes the whole sprint to do a single task like writing one SQL query + testing and deployment. \n\nAt the same time, the guy is learning like crazy. He is really dedicated. Really reminds me of me in the beginning, but maybe he is even tougher at it. He really digs deep into stuff. When he encountered a task with SQLAlchemy he dug into the docs and not just fiddled until he found a solution. He even overdoes this, going too deep into not critical things. He is constantly practicing. Even too much: I had to talk him out of working nights and weekends multiple times (we have an extremely chill atmosphere, there is no pressure to exert yourself, and our team doesn't even have deadlines). He is asking the right questions. The \"stupid\" questions, which I find most important. He questions my design decisions and in a few occasions that highlighted an oversight of mine. Quite likely I have never seen a more dedicated learner in my life. I think he has a great career ahead of him.\n\nInitially, I suspected he is so slow because he is slacking off at work. I was wrong.\n\nWhat I did:\n\n* Set up biweekly 1x1s with him.\n* During the first 1x1 I calibrated the expectations. I told him about my expectations, asked him about he perceived the whole situation and asked him what I should expect. The answer came clear: my expectations of his skills were super inflated and he wasn't slacking off. Also it became obvious that the guy demands way too much from himself. He insisted that I should not lower my expectations because he would \"stop growing\" if I stop pushing. Had to persuade him that it's better to be aligned with reality and I don't believe in pushing.\n* There as well I told him that I am an inexperienced manager. That I mean no harm and respect him. That I might appear annoyed, harsh, rude, or unapproachable, but only due to my inexperience. \n* Now every time we plan the sprint and he takes some tasks I sit down with him and we go through the task. We discuss how to approach it, what to do, what to look out for, and what is the checklist for delivery. \n* Instead of expecting him to review my merge requests (he would just say \"I guess it's ok\") we sit down together and I walk him through my solution, reasons for my technical decisions and so forth. Obviously, I review his MRs.\n* Checking for progress. The guy tends to get stuck and tries to force his way through, so I actively reach out to him and ask him if he needs any help. \n* Regularly telling him that he is making good progress (it's true, he is!) and that everything is ok. Highlighting his achievements to others during meetings. This has had a very good effect so far: recently noticed him helping out other juniors with tricky SQLAlchemy stuff, and it seems he surpassed them in knowledge, even though they are working with it much longer. \n* Trying to be as calm as I can.\n* Asking him for feedback during 1x1s. This has not been effective so far because he always tells me it's all good and no useful feedback. Tends to blame himself for everything, so I have to spot my own fuckups.\n\nI think I managed to turn the situation around. Initially, I would just get frustrated and suspect the guy is slacking. Now our 1x1s turned into really interesting conversations. He is no longer afraid to ask for help (at least not so much), no longer works weekends (not for the company at least) and doesn't jump when I approach him (jeez, am I THAT scary?). On the tech side, the guy is making crazy strides and getting up to speed fast. On the last 1x1 he told me that now after I introduced him to testing, he thinks about code in terms of invariants, modules, and testable components, and can recognize bad interface design that might lead to problems. \n\nMy problem is that I still get frustrated easily and I feel guilty. When he needs help he often asks me very stupid (as in very basic to me) questions. When I explain he often can't follow me, so I have to do it a few times over. He is very slow, so I still can't depend on him after 4 months. Sometimes by the time he does a single task, it becomes obsolete as we learn new things. \n\nI know it's not his fault. The fault is mine. It's completely unrealistic to expect him to catch on this fast on so many things. He doesn't deserve any frustration. I am used to being this star engineer and it's hard to take it slow explaining stuff that seems very basic to me. I am trying to be as calm, patient and helpful as I can, and I think I got better at it. But I know that I am giving him that \"are you stupid?\" vibe. I am doing it despite myself and it damn sucks.\n\nWhat can I do to get better at it?","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1675977146.0},{"title":"Culture of no Code Review","author":"zayelion","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ExperiencedDevs\/comments\/10y260m\/culture_of_no_code_review\/","text":"I can't tell if I'm just in a strange place or what.

I want to give some advice to those who may not know better or ever had someone review your resume. This applies to people at all levels, I have seen 20+ yoe with some horrendous resumes, so even if you are fairly new, don't feel bad!\n\nFirst, have someone review your resume before you submit it! Having a second pair of eyes on it will help you find stupid little mistakes. \n\nSecond, try to keep everything concise. I want to know that you are able to take our very technical field and sum it up to a few bullet points. As you progress higher in your career, you will be communicating with stakeholders, they do not want to read a book, showing that you can sum up your job skills shows me you have that ability.\n\nThird, goes along with the second, don't submit a resume that is 3+ pages long. I have to read through 10-100 resumes a week while still performing my regular job. I do not have time to read your life story. \n\nI tend to want to keep several sections in a resume. Again keep these as short as you can. But the sections I usually want to see\n\nThese are the top sections I want to see, you can place education either beginning or end it does not really matter. But I like to see skills then professional experience (just my preference, makes it easier to read)\n\nSkills: a list of technologies and or languages that you know. If you get creative here, have a little bar graph showing how long you have known this. But again, do not let this go for more than 1\/3rd the page.\n\nProfessional Experience: where you worked, how long you worked, the further back it goes the less bullet points. The most recent, give me 3-4 good bullet points tell me what you did and how it brought empact to your company. Metrics and what tech you used is helpful. The more you go back 1-2 bullet points on 3+ prior jobs \n\nEducation: short and sweet - where did you attend college, did you graduate if so what degree. \n\nThen there are a few sections that can make you stand out and show you have more though not required.\n\nLeadership Experience: where, what was your title, how long, and brief 1-2 bullet points describing it\n\nVolunteer Experience: where, what was your role, when, 1 bullet points\n\nHobbies: small list of things you like to do. (Only add this, if you have some blank space after you have fleshed out the rest)\n\nThen last but not least, I recommend always place this as the last item (just as you would when writing a paper with an appendix) \n\nPortfolio: if you have any publicly available things to show put a list of links here. It could include GitHub,gitlab, LinkedIn, website you created. But please only include personal things do not get in trouble and share private company info here. If you do not have a portfolio, that is fine! I do not look down on anyone who doesn't because you may spend all your time coding for a company and you have a life outside of coding.

Our company used to have around 80 in-house developers, with long tenures (average of 6-7 years), but after the pandemic hit, we had to downsize to around 40 developers. However, starting last year, we began to hire again and now our company is even larger than before with 90 developers, but the average tenure of a developer is very new.\n\nAs a result of this new reality, we are facing challenges in onboarding new developers and keeping our documentation up to date. The tribal knowledge strategy that worked for us before is not enough now, as we are constantly pulled into meetings to answer questions that could be easily answered with good documentation. Additionally, the constant influx of new developers is making it difficult for us to pair with them and get them set up with the development environment.\n\nI am looking for advice on how to handle these new challenges.

I had an interview for an FE Engineer role earlier in the week and got a rejection today with the feedback that they really liked me and it was a very close thing between me and the person who got it, but they felt the other candidate gave slightly more detailed answers. I felt the interview went reasonably well, but I certainly felt that my answers weren't as conscise or detailed as they could have been (I have a habit of nerve induced rambling, which I really need to get out of), so I'm hoping some of you could help me improve them for future reference! My answers below are as close as I can remember to the ones I gave, they'll certainly give the gist.\n\nQ: Imagine you're developing a part of an application and there is a gap in the design documentation, how would you address that?\n\nA: Firstly, don't guess. It may well be that the design of something can be easily inferred from a pre-existing part of the application, in which case that could solve the problem. If a CSS framework is being utilised, such as Tailwind, that may well dictate the style of the area. If at all possible, consult with the creators of the design rather than guessing.\n\nQ: How would you get other developers up to speed so they could work on a new codebase?\n\nA: If possible, I would first show them the application in use, this would give them valuable context which should help them to understand how things fit together once we delve into the codebase. When moving onto the codebase, I would start with fundamentals to give them a good grounding before moving on. Then I would try and be led by them, it's no good me talking at them for hours, I feel it works better if they discover the codebase themselves with me guiding them.\n\nQ: When writing code, how can you make life easier for other developers?\n\nA: Comments are key. I don't agree with the adage that good code doesn't need comments.

I have some libraries \/ frameworks I am pretty passionate about and figured it is worth getting into, but it feels like it is absolutely impossible so far. Issue I've faced:\n\n* Often knowing how to use a library is far from knowing how to work on it, or what to work on. People usually say \"Oh, just implement X or fix bug Y, whatever you feel like\". But in my case I didn't always know what the maintainers really want, or I did not have a bug to fix. It's often very hard to get into the mindset of the creators \/ maintainers.\n* The tags are either not up to date, or people are absolutely circling like vultures above issues open to be fixed. Some open source projects I personally know are very popular and often make it sound like everyone can contribute and is welcome, yet, they have like 20-30 issues tagged as \"free for all\", and every issue is immediately taken and competed on by 2-3 devs due to the popularity.\n* The codebase is huge and I failed to identify some side effects on changes which I actually managed to get into the PR stage (This one's on me, but it still felt very discouraging).\n* I've also had the case multiple times now in which I file an improvement, talk it through with the maintainer, come up with a plan, just to wake up the next day to see someone else who was never in the conversation creating a finished PR that's merged before I have a chance to work on the issue I proposed and signalled I wanted to work on.\n\nHonestly, so far my experience with contributing to open source is very discouraging. I feel like I might just take a wrong approach, but I don't really know how to \"properly\" do it.

And as a result, the quality of the product may suffer, and the company may not achieve long-term success.

I love Python, it is my preferred language.\n\nHowever, when it comes to an algorithmic interview, I prefer to forbid candidates from using idiomatic python. When I'm a candidate, I also do not write idiomatic python, instead writing things out the long\/hard way. My reasoning is that in an algorithmic interview, the purpose is to show that the candidate knows the fundamental basics of algorithms, and using idiomatic python somewhat obscures that. In addition, the other languages do not have these nice features that python does, so it gives candidates who pick python a somewhat unfair advantage.\n\nFor example, I do not allow the use of the `sum`, `min` or `max` builtin functions. I do not allow list comprehensions, such as `sum([word in seen for word in words])`. I don't allow `collections.Counter` or `bisect` or `itertools`. \n\nOf course, I allow built in data structures like `set`, `dict`, `deque`, and I also allow `sort()` \/ `sorted()`. These are available in java\/go\/etc and I don't think it is reasonable to ask a candidate to implement a hash set or implement timsort in order to solve an algorithmic interview question.\n\nOn the other hand, if it was a take home assignment, instead of an algorithmic interview, I would of course allow the use of idiomatic python. Take home assignments are more geared for showing that the candidate can write clean, production code, so idiomatic python is the correct approach here.\n\nI always make sure to tell the candidate, or tell the interviewer if I am the candidate, something along the lines of \"of course, in production python code we would use the built ins\/list comprehension\/etc. but for purposes of this algorithmic interview we are going to do it the long way. We are going to do it the long way for two reasons: 1) the other candidates who pick Go or Java or w\/e don't have these nice built-ins available; 2) I want to make sure you understand the basics of algorithmic programming\"\n\n-----------\n\n\nDo you agree or disagree with my approach?","upvote_ratio":0.2,"created_utc":1675788078.0},{"title":"Ask Experienced Devs Weekly Thread: A weekly thread for inexperienced developers to ask experienced ones","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ExperiencedDevs\/comments\/10urrsu\/ask_experienced_devs_weekly_thread_a_weekly\/","text":"A thread for Developers and IT folks with less experience to ask more experienced souls questions about the industry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease keep top level comments limited to Inexperienced Devs. Most rules do not apply, but keep it civil.

As a result, requesting new features from them is excruciating, going on unbearable. \n\nThese feature requests are not necessarily described at a high level, but include things like \"add ability to incorporate x model into output\". But these people seem to have absolutely no map in their mind about what is going on in the code vis a vis the business\/application logic. It ends up being that I have to walk them through the codebase to show them the relevant parts for the change. Not only that, but they insist on verifying their very brittle and precarious understanding of what's being asked by regurgitating a few paragraphs through Slack, whereby we engage in a lengthy back-and-forth until they have assuaged their anxieties. And then if I missed some flag they need to consider or some small refactor which they might need to do to achieve their goal, they come back to me for guidance instead of just solving the problem.\n\nFor a general sense of things, our codebase has probably 30k-50k lines of code but lately we've only been touching about 500-1000 lines for the past few weeks. The business logic contains basically no recursion: it is of the \"ask question, get answer\" variety, so there's not even that much complexity. \n\nThese people just really, really, really cannot direct their attention to learn any single thing about the freakin point of the work they do.\n\nHow do I encourage them to read the codebase for themselves to understand how things work and how they correspond to the intentions of the application?

The person whom I think was the origin of this culture has been gone for a couple years but they seem to have internalized a pathological aversion to paying attention to any code that doesn't fall under their purview explicitly.

During our conversation, he asked me about my philosophy on building technology, specifically my thoughts on microservices architecture versus a monolith approach and the importance of testing and preference in design patterns. \n\nI shared that I prefer microservices architecture, but if containerization is an overkill for the usecase and with available resources, we can still use different repositories based on functionality and deploy them using cloud services. However, the founder was against this approach and felt that a monolith approach was the way to go. He also expressed his dislike for testing saying it was a waste of time (Tbh I find writing tests boring too, but it's for the greater good of the product). I like building APIs in hexagonal architecture and I was trying to explain the benefits and he was like 'Why not write all the code in the same file'. I gave a few opinions on clean code like the single responsibility principle of functions, classes, etc, use handler patterns whenever there are many if else statements, etc.. (This was the funniest part for me when he went 'I don't see any problem in writing 100s of if-else statements. The code still runs'). He said all these microservice, tests, scaling, clean code etc are just tech jargon that aren't useful to increase the business. \n\nAs a result of our differing philosophies, I received an email saying I wouldn't be moving forward in the hiring process. This got me thinking about the importance of one's personal philosophy when it comes to building technology. Also, I am not able to decide whether I dodged a bullet or I should have just played along with him to get the job? \n\nI am curious to hear from more experienced developers: How strongly do you believe in your own philosophy and do you think it's best to stick to it, or is it sometimes better to adapt and do what is easiest, given time constraints and other considerations?\n\nWith 4 years of experience as a founding engineer or first hire at a few startups, I am questioning if my beliefs make sense or if I have too little experience to form solid opinions.\n\nI would love to hear your thoughts and perspectives on this topic.

I never get quite the same high as when some mysterious thing comes along that's fucking everything up, and it doesn't make sense, and no one can make sense of it, but I come in and I dig through and tear away at things until I find the root cause. Not just a patch for the problem, but I root out the real problem.\n\nIt's just so satisfying. And I just love the forensic process of analysing and interrogating the code, the call stack, looking through papertrail, investigating the DB trying to see what's gone wrong, where the data mismatch is or whatever. I love the process, and I love the end result of being the hero who slayed that annoying beast that was fucking up Production.\n\nSo... I know there's different paths you can take. I'm at that point in my career... my title is \"Senior\" but I'm more of a mid-level, but I'm approaching proper senior level, and I need to start really thinking about what sort of path I want to take, what do I really want to invest in being really good at...\n\nI've never come across any developer whose job title is \"Lead Exterminator\", but I like the sound of it. Bugs are just that thing that sit in the backlog, or are urgent enough them become emergency tickets in the sprint, but either way they get picked off as-and-when. There's no focused attention on them anywhere I've seen. But despite them being something you can't plan for, there's always going to be a healthy load of them to work through. So I feel like there must be a place for such a person, but maybe it's just a dream?\n\nedit: Gotten some great answers.

About 2 years ago the SaaS product I work on got carved out of this company and sold off to another. The new company was a joint venture between two larger companies, one being our previous competitor.\n\nIt was clear from the start that company A in this joint venture was shit. They underpaid and overworked mostly junior and offshore developers. There were some \"staff engineers\" who mostly seem like older dudes that checked out and are stuck leading teams of junior devs on the other side of the world and developing software like it's 2003.\n\nI was lucky in that technically my employer is company B and is a much better place to work. However company A has been tasked with building the next generation of my product. I am part of the only team from company B that is also working on this next gen product (since we previously worked on the original version).\n\nThe problem here is that with this acquisition the company acquired a pretty good tech stack, and then just basically threw it away. It's on life support now, and just staying alive to serve existing clients. All dev focus is on this \"next gen\" platform which is just our competitor's sub-par offering with a coat of paint over it basically.\n\nThe new product is late, development is a mess, performance is terrible.\n\nMy team is tasked with a small part of the new product, we're building a few new micro services to serve a few features of the new product. Our services are good quality, robust, performing good, and we are generally the model team for the rest of the organization.\n\nMeanwhile the rest of the development effort is a garbage fire and I'm just sitting here watching and laughing.\n\nAll the devs who came over in the acquisition with me have left by this point. We've hired some new, good people on to my team that I really enjoy working with and we do good work. Like I mentioned, we're technically part of company B and are the model team on this whole development effort (which is mostly company A).\n\nWe met with the CTO in the earlier days of the acquisition to try and warn him of the things we were seeing at company A. Now, fast forward 2 years and it's all coming to fruition. The product we're developing is at a point where our customer support teams are starting to actually be able to use it and they're like \"wtf is this shit?\"\n\nWe're months late. Performance of the app is terrible. And I foresaw all of it.\n\nThere were numerous decisions that were made that I disagreed with, and now I'm stuck in this position where I'm just looking at all this and thinking \"I told you so\". I tried to help, I had a number of meetings with my skip level manager and talked to him about my ideas and how to improve the culture at company A. Everything was met with agreement and then zero action.\n\nI've been extremely blunt with my immediate manager. He knows how I feel, but is kind of powerless over the other side of the company so not much can be done.\n\nLike I said, my team is still doing good work, I enjoy working with them, and I feel extremely valued at the company since we are doing so well and my manager makes that very clear. Plus I'm basically the only person who can fix prod issues on our legacy platform.\n\nAnyways...I'm wondering if I should raise this above my manager and maybe just be more blunt with upper management?

Like everyone else, the pandemic forced a remote culture and they started recruiting remote talent. I was hired there even though I live a time zone away because I guess it seemed like remote employees were working out well for them.\n\nWell, during the final few months of last year, I was asked *at least* once a week when I'm going to fly in and meet everyone. It was always prefaced with \"no big deal if you can't make it this month, totally optional. We just feel like people work together better if they know each other.\" I was asked so many times that I'm starting to think it *is* a big deal and it's *not* optional.\n\nAdditionally, a few weeks ago the company put together this company-wide \"in-person\" event where even the remote-first employees (employees initially hired out of state) flew in and everyone was on campus. This apparently went so well that the company is now planning three more such events this year. Not everyone flew in (including me) and of course they said \"it's ok if you didn't make *this one*\" but I think the next ones are going to be a little more mandatory.\n\nFinally, the weirdest thing to me, a couple months ago they created a new Slack channel called \"remote-employees\" that is literally just a channel of all the out-of-state employees.

I'm okay with longer hours for important issues, production outages, etc., but not when this is the daily grind.\n\nHopefully all of this sounds like a pretty decent reasons to look at other roles.

The past two years I've been at my current team and it's been going great. \n\nAbout a year ago our team hired a junior dev who we'll call Peter. Peter, being fresh out of college, has always been quite slow on doing anything assigned to him. I had absolutely no part in his training, those responsibilities were assigned to another member of the team. Occasionally though I've worked with Peter (pair programming, code reviews, walking him through stuff that I knew a lot about) and he's never really impressed me. He struggles with a lot of basic things and never really takes any initiative of his own. Whenever he gets stuck on something he won't take any initiative to try and find a solution on his own, he will just wait until the next days stand up and say hes stuck. He is also just a terrible hindrance to the team as we have to go in one day a week and every 15-30 minutes he has some compulsion that he needs to stand up in his cubicle (he's really tall) and starts up a conversation with anyone who'll listen.\n\nThere's so many other bad things about him that will take forever to write. I'm pretty sure the guy has never completed a story on his own and more than half of our sprints have ended with him not completing his story at all. I think the moment when I just lost all respect for him was when I was helping him with docker because he hadn't used it before and he said he just doesn't understand it at all. I told him that our company offers professional training courses for docker and k8s paid for up front and he said \"yeah but I don't really believe I should have to learn anything new to work here you know?\". At that moment I basically marked him as a parasite programmer and just avoided working with him, always directing him to the mentor hes assigned if he ever asked me anything.\n\nI think our teams manager\/team lead (kind of the same thing in our company) is also not a fan of Peter because I've noticed that he's always putting Peter on minor projects\/tasks that are off to the side while the rest of us focus on the big upcoming deliverables. It's like he just sees Peter as a chore. My TL is a very laid back kind of guy who's probably a redditor since he views his job as him having to \"protect\" us from the business and a lot of his beliefs line up with what I read on this sub and \/r\/cscareerquestions. He's very supportive and I know in his head Peter is \"just a junior\" and expected to fail and just doing his best, but in my eyes the guy is literally doing nothing. My TL is always in a call with Peter probably \"peer programming\" which I put in quotes because I do still review the PRs Peter will put up and notice that the branch is just full of commits made by my TL revising the stuff Peter does. I'm pretty sure Peter just takes advantage of my TL's good naturedness and is offloading all his work onto him which is probably why my TL assigns so many meaningless tasks to him in the first place.\n\nBut, none of this is what I need advice\/help on (and if you've made it this far in what I realize now has basically been a rant then I'd like to thank you for taking the time). All of this is my TL's problem and really doesn't affect me as me and 2-3 other team members often just work together on our stuff and knock things out together while the TL handles Peter and his otherm managerial things. What's happened though is that we just hired another junior (and senior but that has no impact here), who we'll call Jill, a couple weeks ago because our team has been given some major projects to do for this year and we need more resources. And who's been assigned to on board and mentor this junior? Peter. The rest of us need to focus on these major projects that's probably going to make or break my TL's career.\n\nSo again I would normally not consider this any of my problem. It's my TL who has to deal with it. But this past week Peter was on pto and I decided to help Jill out. Well, it turns out Peter's way of \"on boarding\" has just been sharing his screen while he codes and in the past couple weeks Jill has learned nothing about our code base. Jill didn't even have a local dev environment set up (and I KNOW it's because Peter doesn't know how to set it up himself and his is only setup because of my TL's hand holding). I walk Jill through all of this the past 3 days and honestly Jill is quite bright and already looking like they'll be great on their own (though they apparently have zero experience in our stack...i just don't understand how these things happen). Also we pulled down the dev branch Peter had been working on in his screen share with Jill and it wasn't even functional. I looked into it and the issue was something Peter the parasite had brought up in stand up before he left because he just didn't know how to use the library that was part of the story requirement and was trying to push it onto someone else to do it. He couldn't be bothered to try and just read the first page of the documentation. \n\nSo I don't really know what to do now. I've developed a hatred of this guy over the past year so am worried I just have a strong bias against him, but this recent development of him taking on the on boarding of a new dev and just doing it wrong has really irked me. But I really really really just don't want to be that guy who complains about a team member especially since our passive TL seems more than happy to just let him fester. I have weekly 1x1 with my TL(next one is day after tomorrow). Should I say anything and if so how I can approach this diplomatically? I really hate working with Peter, he is a complete parasite, but I want to keep these feelings aside and if I need to bring this up I want it to be from a place of neutrality.\n\nEdit: One more point of context. Our TL was promoted into the position shortly (like two days) after I joined. Peter is his first actual hire so I partially suspect he doesn't want his first hire to look bad as he thinks it'll reflect badly on him\n\nEdit2: I'd also like to add that I've spoken to my friends and family members about this and almost all of them told me not to say anything. Don't \"rock the boat\" as complaining about a team member will just make ME look like the problem.","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1674985194.0},{"title":"How to use ChatGPT to be more productive?","author":"kazestyle","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ExperiencedDevs\/comments\/10p9sux\/how_to_use_chatgpt_to_be_more_productive\/","text":"I've seen quite a few people talk about how they're getting 2-3x more work done with chatGPT specifically for programming.

This new EM is way too hands-on on everything. Literally everything. They want to know every single little detail of everyone's work all the time. I was ok with it at first, thinking no harm in a manager wanting to get down into the roots, but lately it's just been stressing me out. It's like they want everything to be done their way only or they need explanation on why it wasn't done that way. I will give some examples on what it looks like:  \n\n\n1. They leave nit-picky comments on my pull request. I don't know how common this is, but out of my 4 previous managers, no one reviewed code. Again, no harm in having more eyes on your code. But all their comments are either very minor, like this name doesn't sound good, can you change it etc., or they are very broad, like why did you take this approach, did you evaluate options x, y, and z. Thing is, I did evaluate options x, y, and z and discussed them with the area owners and my tech lead, evaluated pros and cons and settled on that approach. But they are not convinced, they want a \"one-pager\" summarizing all the discussion. I did cave in and wrote them a one pager and their only comment: \"I like what you had in the doc, but when I ask for a one pager I expect more details and not just a high level view\". Their exact words. I really have no idea how to fit all the details of a complex multi-week task into one page and more importantly, I don't understand why I am supposed to do it \\_after\\_ I already wrote the code for it, tested it, got it reviewed and deemed it ready to go into Production, just to please them.\n2. They called me at 9 am, knowing full well that I will be traveling and was on leave, asking me to address some comments that another engineer has left on my work, because the deadline was the next day. I checked the comments on my phone and they were very minor but I already packed my laptop so I thought I will finish them once I reach my destination and get a chance to unwind and open my laptop again. After all, the deadline was the next day. But, come 7 pm, I get a message asking me if I have completed the work. I told them I still didn't reach my destination and I will get it done that day itself and they don't have to worry about it. 30 mins later, I get another text saying that they have made the required changes and just need me to review them and see if they are ok. WTF?! Why call me at 9 am on a day I was traveling and already had a lot on my plate if they could do it themselves? And why go and do it when I assured them that I will get it done??\n3. I created a pull request on Friday, assigned it to one of my peers who is the owner of that area for review, discussed a few things and logged out. I logged in on Monday morning, saw that the PR was approved but the CI build has expired so I ran it again because it's needed for the merge. 30 mins later, before the build even finished, I get a message from my manager asking me why I haven't merged the PR yet. I told them it wasn't approved and the build expired. To my bad luck, the build finished just then and they checked the PR and messaged me saying the PR is approved and the build is done and I should merge it. As if I didn't know that!\n4. They enabled 2FA for accessing our Production resources on Friday evening, without discussing it with anyone. My colleague and I had some work to be done on Saturday and we both logged in only to find out neither of us could access the resources because 2FA has been turned on and setting up 2FA requires approval from my manager or my lead and they were not online. We had to wait until the next Saturday to get the work done and it just pushed all our timelines\n5. Just today, they made it mandatory to have 3 reviewers on your pull request for it to be accepted. 3! Including the person who wrote the code, that would involve 4 people for every pull request. We are a team of 12 working on a very diverse set of features, how the f\\*\\*k are we supposed to gather 4 people with enough knowledge on that specific task?\n\nSorry for the rant. I never had this happen before and I don't know how to process it. I don't know if we got off on the wrong foot and they don't trust me to do the right thing or if they are like this with everyone. We are 100% remote so I can't gauge how my coworkers are feeling about them and none of them are openly complaining about anything. Am I in the wrong here? Am I being too sensitive? Is this normal? What do I do? Because I don't feel like working under them anymore and I don't think it's a good time to switch jobs.

One is personal: staying in a position for over 2 years without moving up the ladder, second is potentially out of my control problem of current economy influencing the former. Location of the company is in Zurich, Switzerland. I work remotely from Latvia. Position: engineer, next level: senior engineer\n\nWe had layoffs - around 15% of the staff were terminated immediately with generous severance. We also had quarterly bonuses become bi-annual (I assume because if people leave, they won't be entitled to them). There is focus on cutting wasteful expenses and overall high effort to conserve the runway (not too different from other non-profitable startups).\n\nAround 6 months ago, I told my manager that it is time to consider me for promotion. I listed the items that were done, and he agreed it makes sense. Since then, I asked that our 1:1s include follow-ups on the progress. The promotions would happen in a regular review cycle in December. I was consistently told being on track until December, when suddenly skip manager told my manager promotion is not happening due to CTO being worried about company spend (not yet profitable) and historical dislike for the team I am in (not my fault, the offending people are long gone, yet the beliefs persist).\n\nThen, around New Year's time, my manager announced to me that Senior VP is still pushing for bumping me up the pay band, and that come January it should happen. Then, last week they delayed everyone's reviews again - I believe most won't even get cost of living raises after being there over a year because \"it is unfair to people we laid off\". So, this is the second time in two short months when I am once again softly denied promotion. It is getting quite old to be frank. My manager in the last couple 1:1s asked about stuff like what makes you work here, what would make you leave etc. I told her that me staying in one position for much longer means I will be dissatisfied.\n\nI don't even care about money, the startup has 2 years runway with cost-cutting present, my personal runway is over 5 years in length - being without work is not an immediate problem to me. My problem is staying in a company for over 2 years without moving up the ladder. I think it looks terrible on a resume and it feels like no matter what I do, nobody gives a damn about my own wishes to have more authority in the company. I also am struggling to comprehend the flip-flops over last two months of: \"on track\" (November) - \"not anymore\" (December) - \"on track again\" (early January) - \"eh ... not anymore lol\" (late January). \n\nI do like my own team, and work we do is useful to the world somewhat, but I dislike leadership because of reasons above.\n\nWould appreciate your insights.","upvote_ratio":0.44,"created_utc":1674889538.0},{"title":"How is your guys job search going?","author":"False_Secret1108","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ExperiencedDevs\/comments\/10memo8\/how_is_your_guys_job_search_going\/","text":"The csccareer subreddit is being spammed with people despairing over not being able to find a job.

I came into this role having some background in best practices (I finished at a master's so had some semi-professional experience under my belt) and right off the bat, I could tell that the company was, for all intents and purposes, a joke. As an example, the company built something akin to MongoDB but with less than 10 developers and no QA whatsoever. With time though, the company got a bit better and they ended up pumping out a product that was picked up by very big clients. Eventually, the company was bought out by an international cybersecurity firm (think top 10).\n\nI stayed at this role because generally I could tell that I was respected, saw my salary more than double over the years, and with seniority I could basically do whatever I wanted - free from micromanagement and really with plenty of praise.\n\nHere's the problem... the company literally never cared about architecture or design. To them, readability and scalability was and is a waste of time. As as example, one of the principal SEs (who can barely write in python) said that if people can't read messy code, they should work elsewhere. Because of the poor scalability, we could not keep up with a client's demands and lost a major client. This immediately led to the layoff of about 10% of the workforce. This led to poor morale as we were told that \"we are just going to have to work a little harder.\" Lo and behold, a few months later another client hung up the skates because our product became too buggy. And... a few more layoffs and people quitting. Fast forward to now and basically all the red flags you can imagine: secret closed door meetings, top level execs leaving, cost cutting (i.e. on cloud resources, no bonuses, etc).\n\nWe're officially at a point of \"technical debt insolvency\" - that is, myself and basically any dev that has enough social skills is on a client call debugging something all day every day. It's so bad that I just have to ignore most of the clients because I simply can't keep up. One client even threatened to sue me personally if I don't answer him. **And let me add... these are not small clients. We are talking about companies that advertise on the major American news networks.** The icing on the cake is that the manager of the UI team told the founder and SVP that it's not possible to continue like this and the SVP fired him.

As an example I just reviewed a PR where the author wanted to introduce data overrides into a sql table, including logical operators. Like there's a table with a column called criteria, which would be like \"a >= b*17\", then another column with which column to replace and another column with the value, and this is all translated into code and executed. I objected that this was just using databases to get around all the unit tests and approvals needed to change code, but met heavy disagreements because they had run into issues where they needed to make quick changes and even with quick turnarounds all the builds and tests took a few hours.\n\n\nSo my question is how do other teams handle this balance?

I seem to constantly struggle trying to figure out which things should know about each other and always seem think I am an idiot for doing it one way, invert it, and then think I'm an idiot for doing it the new way.\n\n\nCase in point - I have a personal project where I'm trying to load <model> data from a file and do stuff with it, but having trouble figuring out which things to surface to the rest of the app. I currently have:\n\n* Model - unique instance \/ representation of a file containing model data\n\n* Bundle - grouping of Models + metadata that are all related and intended to be used together\n\n* Manager - coordinates and maintains Models + Bundles\n\n* Engine - does all the heavy lifting, e.g. loading the file data and creating async jobs to do so\n\n\nOriginally I had built things such that the Model was essentially just a dumb reference that held a filename, the Bundle is what told the Engine to load Models, and the Engine managed async jobs + file I\/O. Soon after I realized that the Bundle was going to have metadata on top of potentially different ways to relate a given set of Models, so I decided to make the Engine encapsulate the concept of async jobs (since the Bundle should have no real knowledge of how a Model is loaded), and added the Manager to help coordinate between the app and everything else. It seems like no matter what the app will need to know about Bundle, so I've recently started to wonder if I should actually just lock everything behind that and have the Manager manage the async jobs and the Engine just do straight file I\/O without any knowledge of jobs.\n\n\nWith all of that said, the one question I always seem to have is **how do you figure out how best to encapsulate + expose objects in your app?** It seems like no matter what I do I can find reasons for any given combination + usage, but I can never really figure out which one is the right way to do so. I always seem to find some different interpretation of encapsulation to suit the way I'm building things but often time overlook how that actually affects the rest of the app and don't really ever consider which objects get too fat.","upvote_ratio":0.6,"created_utc":1674665324.0},{"title":"How do you Hit the Ground Running when Joining a New Company?","author":"chinawcswing","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ExperiencedDevs\/comments\/10kao3y\/how_do_you_hit_the_ground_running_when_joining_a\/","text":"I've worked at the same company for a long time.

I can probably answer it myself, but at the same time I am feeling a bit annoyed.\n\nI work in a team of 11 and last year there were 8 seniors and 3 standard developers including me.\n\nMy projects over the last year have largely resulted because I seem to have the primary domain of expertise in it. This has meant I have not been given an opportunity to look at new technologies and the like while my other standard devs have been given those opportunities. My current projects do not involve looking for new tech, just using what we as a team are using, so I am bottom rung in that regard.\n\nRecently I found that both of my other standard dev colleagues were promoted to full senior. This irks me quite a bit as I'm now the lowest ranking team member. I do get why the other two were promoted ahead of me but if my projects do not allow time for me to look at new things (in fact, this was dissuaded in my last performance review which was rated excellent) because the manager didn't feel it would be of benefit. However, I have been there longer and have been a major go-to point for my area of the product (which accounts for just under 50% of our product sales combined). I guess you could say that the knowledge is silo'd to me. \n\nBut to now hear I am the lowest rank despite the extra hours and the efforts I have previously gone to (including working 13 hour days to get a new product launched during the pandemic which was at that point deemed an absolute priority) is a bit of a kick in the teeth.\n\nI do intend to bring this up tomorrow as I'm meeting with my manager, but how should I approach this? One of my colleagues said not to worry as they are hiring in a new dev so I won't be the lowest rank for long. \n\nWhile I haven't been able to take part in researching new tech for business use, if this is the only measure of success then I think it's a bit rubbish. That and I have heard through the grapevine that my manager intends to ask me to mentor the new dev coming on board. While I have played the role of mentor plenty times before and I'm willing to do it, I do have a compulsion to say no and get one of the seniors to do it.\n\nI don't want to appear pedantic or cause a big old fuss, but it does feel rubbish. The other devs are perfectly fine devs and while they have had the opportunity to do more R&D than I have, it also is largely due to my retaining this domain of discourse and knowledge and means I am pretty much the only person in the company capable of pulling off my part of it. OK don't get me wrong, I'm sure someone could muddle their way through it, but the nuances would likely pull them up down the line, etc. I would agree it's not good for just one person to have domain knowledge that accounts for 50% of product sales, but it's where we are.\n\nShould I just keep shut and not worry about it, or if I bring it up to my manager, how should I approach it?","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1674549751.0},{"title":"Company shifting me into more in-person role when I was hired as a fully remote employee","author":"theKetoBear","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ExperiencedDevs\/comments\/10jnlyc\/company_shifting_me_into_more_inperson_role_when\/","text":"Hey Experienced Devs I feel a little sheepish  posting this but I also would love to hear your insight and if you also appreciate and udnerstand the source of my frustration here .  \n\n\nI am at a job where I really enjoy the team and I enjoy  the work we do.

(This is more of an EM's job, but he comes to me for advice at times.)\n- Being an architect in the team. I'm normally the first to take up major projects and develop technical specs. I may or may not own the implementation depending on bandwidth.\n- Ensuring that the services that my team owns are running healthily, operational excellence, observability, documentation, reviewing PRs and other technical documents.\n- Collaborating with other teams, answering technical questions here and there, etc. (This is rotated sometimes)\n- Code implementation in whatever tasks that I'm taking on.\n- Occassionally, depending on the scope, leading projects involving multiple teams\n- Oncall ;(\n\nI'd say that writing design documents take up a lot of my time. But I actually really enjoy this a lot now compared to writing code constantly. I used to hate writing documents because I'm bad at them. But as I grew in my career.

I can see what is happening, but I am at a total loss on how to either break the cycle or mentally gymnastic myself into not caring.\n\nThe pattern is:\n\n* System is required to be super available\/durable\n* System is architected\/designed appropriately\n* Low\/mid level Leadership tells the engineering team to take shortcuts in the name of release deadlines and promises \"fast follows\" (or deprioritizes design elements because \"it's very unlikely 'that' would actually happen\")\n* Fast follows never happen, system breaks (due to aforementioned shortcuts), customers demand answers for why super available\/durable system failed.\n* Leadership says \"This is so shocking! How could this happen?!\"\n* Senior leadership asks for a post mortem, low\/mid level leadership forgets\/ignores\/deflects that they made the decisions to take shortcuts in the first place, and tells engineers to \"do better next time\" - often with fast follow fixes that never get scheduled either.\n* Cycle repeats\n\nThe two parts that that really gets me are:\n\n1. Post mortems almost exclusively focus on the technology and failures of implementation and very rarely on the process and incentives which drove the decisions to build that technology\/take shortcuts.\n2. The business sets up new features as a top priority *until something goes wrong*, then suddenly fixing the system is priority 0 and senior leadership has to have an explanation, but then shortly afterwards its business as usual.\n\nI understand that management is being evaluated on the features they release and hitting deadlines as opposed to system availability\/durability.  However, I am at a loss on how to actually break the cycle or even get leadership to be aware of the problem.  \n\nIn this environment it seems like shortcuts are a slippery slope, as soon as you take one and schedule a fast-follow, the fast follow is doomed because if it isn't high enough priority *now* there is no reason it will ever be, as it will be compared to the priority of the *next* shortcut (which, of course, will be higher priority).\n\n\n**Example**\n\nAs an example, I was in an incident post mortem where a service went down in 5 AWS regions due to a database failure in 1.  The regions are supposed to be independent.  \n   \n\nThe post mortem focused on the failure, talked about how the other regions were made dependent to speed up the release process to get a release out the door, and fixes were identified and tasks assigned.\n\n\nEveryone was all set and happy with the incident report until I asked if the team knew the risks of getting the service built quickly with dependent regions and if there had been any plans to build in the regional independence after the feature release.  Surprise, surprise the team WAS aware of the issues and a bunch of \"fast follow\" action items had been created.\n\n\nI asked what happened to the \"fast follow\" items. Turns out the items were consistently priority number two for the team, behind the next feature. Eventually the items were just forgotten after failing to be scheduled for months.\n\nPushing the issue, leadership essentially said taking the shortcut was the right thing to do at the time (I agree) and the engineers should push to get the fast follow items harder after the fact.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1674276084.0},{"title":"Taking a year off to level up my skills","author":"z8man2","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ExperiencedDevs\/comments\/10hsavt\/taking_a_year_off_to_level_up_my_skills\/","text":"Hello,\nI'm self taught senior software engineer with 5+ yoe, but i feel that I'm not as good as i should be in \n\n- fundamentals such as OS, network, databases, concurrency (how things work internally) \n\n- software design, i mean low level design, how to design a single system that is maintainable and extendable (OOD,  database design, simplicity, DDD)\n\n- system design, designing distributed systems that work together ( microservices,  queues,  event driven)\n\nThis year i started paying more attention to low level design, im taking those steps\n- reading design pattern books\n- refactoring by Martin fowler\n- refactoring to patterns\n- reading open source projects code\n\nBut I'm planning to take next year (2024) off, so i can learn the the rest of the skills I'm missing and return a stronger senior engineer ( also to reset as I'm stressed) \n\nWhat do you think of this idea?
