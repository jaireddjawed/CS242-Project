        "text": "Today I had an argument about what sarcasm is, which left me in doubt. \n\nAs I understand, sarcasm is a type of irony used to mock, ridicule or criticize. If that is the case, sarcasm is just a subgroup of irony, so you can have irony without sarcasm but not sarcasm without irony. I have found similar definitions in several pages/videos explaining sarcasm. \n\nHowever, someone corrected me, saying that sarcasm does not require irony, and linked the Wikipedia to prove their point. There it used the phrase \"I'm not a mind reader, okay?\" as an example of something sarcastic but not ironic. To me it doesn't feel right to say that it is sarcastic, because the meaning is literal, even though there is mockery in it.\n\nI did some digging, and I found some papers in which define sarcasm as a form of irony, and other that claim that sarcasm can exist without irony. In [this paper](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1990-09402-001), for instance, they say the following:\n\n\" An example of a sarcastic remark that is not ironic would be \"Thanks a lot!\"  Such an obviously insincere expression of gratitude would not be viewed as ironic, but it would almost certainly be viewed as sarcastic .\"\n\nI don´t agree with that, because an insincere expression of gratitude conveys the opposite meaning of what the words literally mean, and therefore is ironic.\n\nSo, I'm confused about this. Is sarcasm a form of irony, or is independent of it? Can you have sarcasm without irony?",

        "text": "Hello - back again with another syntax question. I've been thinking about the phrase \"\\[when\\] compared to...\" and was wondering what type of role its playing? Take these sentences for example:\n\n&gt;(1) When compared to English, Icelandic is difficult.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(2) Compared to English, Icelandic is difficult.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(3) Icelandic is difficult, compared to English.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(4) Icelandic, when compared to English, is difficult.\n\nIn these four sentences, (1) at first seems to be a fronted adverbial clause because of \"when\"; however, when there is no such \"when\" as in (2), do we treat the clause as a participial phrase instead - in such a case, is it acting adjectivally, modifying \"Icelandic\"? I'm not exactly sure how to consider such phrases. What about (3), where it's sentence-final, or (4), where the 'when-clause' is acting relatively.\n\n\"When compared to\" (and \"**when-clauses**\" in general) can act relatively, in a restrictive pre/post-modifier position, but can also be sentence-initial/final as in the above examples. Does this change in structure also change what type of clause it is? In the below examples, it seems as if there is some discrepancy between what \"**when**\" can actually modify. [Some websites](https://www.unr.edu/writing-speaking-center/student-resources/writing-speaking-resources/relative-clauses-pronouns-adverbs) and [books](https://gyazo.com/fab1477b5bf120d844d4e72d37ea05c7) list \"when-clauses\" as an ad-hoc way of forming a traditional relative clause by replacing \"on/in which\". [Others](https://www.grammarflip.com/curriculum/relative-adverbs) say it's maintaining a relativized status whilst modifying verb phrases. \n\n&gt;(A) When he saw the dog running, Johnny closed the door. &lt;--- 'When-clause' modifying \"closed\".  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(B) Johnny closed the door when he saw the dog running. &lt;--- 'when-clause' modifying \"closed\".  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(C) Johnny, when he saw the dogs running, closed the door. &lt;--- 'when-clause' modifying \"Johnny\".\n\nIs there some discrepancy between what we consider a subordinator or relativizer? Traditionally, adverbs cannot modify nouns, so theoretically there should be no way that (C) be possible, yet it is. If \"when\" in (C) is in fact adverbial, then how is (C) a relative clause - also known as an adjective clause? I don't understand how it supplementing \"on/in which\" just magically changes the clause type. Perhaps I just don't have some fundamental knowledge of grammar, or I'm missing something. Even the Cambridge Grammar of the English language had nothing on this, simply stating it was a \"relative word\" - in fact, it doesn't even have the term \"relative adverb\" anywhere in that book. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBooks referenced or checked prior to the making of this post:   \nComplete English Grammar Rules - Herring (FARLEX international).\n\nThe Cambridge Grammar of the English Language - Huddleston, Pullum.\n\nCambridge Grammar of English - Carter, McCarthy",

In this case, consider that it's not California Roads, but a map of all roads within California. It is also a formal title -- so all words are capitalized.   \n\n\nAnother opinion is that it's **California's Roads Map** \\-- no possesive apostrophe on \"Roads\". \n\nI am cross-eyed from thinking about this, and I'm sure it's easier than I think, but after sentence trees, Elements of Style and the like, I think my brain needs a new fresh grammar-nerd brain on it.   \n\n\nCan someone please help me stop obessesing on this and tell me which version is correct and why?",
