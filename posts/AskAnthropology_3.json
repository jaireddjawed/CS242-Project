My question is: if we looked at the quality of life of every human on earth, how many would have had a \"net-positive life\". My hypothesis is that most people would have had net-negative lives?\n\nPerhaps my perspective is clouded by privilege, but I cannot picture my life being that difficult/unhappy and still wanting to live. I want to continue living right now because my life is relatively easy, but what motivations did people have to survive if they were miserable all the time?\n\nHad you asked a sample english peasants in the 12th century, what percentage of them would have called themselves 'happy' or even 'content'?\n\nI'm sorry if this doesn't make much sense, I can also answer any follow-up questions if needed.\n\nPhilosophical side-note: if happiness is a modern concept, then does that mean that it cannot be the meaning of life, since it hasn't existed for the majority of humanity?",

I'm sure there's some factors involving human adaptations, pigmentation, etc. But, this correlates quite strongly to regions thought to be relevant to human evolution,. Botswana's mean temperature is 22C (up from 21.74.), Ethiopia is 23C (I'm pretty sure the region where all the bones are found are relatively cooler than this), Is Zimbabwe is 21.92, nambia is 20.6.\n\nI mentioned Ethiopia, I know it's generally not considered to be an origin point by modern research but I feel it's still useful.\n\n\nThere's a big outlier in human anthropology, and the study of bones, Greece. Some of the oldest bones we have are from Greece, but it's generally not considered to be an area which humans developed from for many many reasons. The average temperature in Greece is far lower than 21° C, it's 15° C. \n\nThe average global temperature is around 14C This show is a correlation, generally, from where we consider human originated from, and our preferred temperature, and, being that the global temperature is far lower. Obviously, correlation does not equal causation, and, following this logic you can conclude that maybe, humans originated from South America. Or really anywhere in a specific area relative to the equator, which is obviously not true.\n\n\nSo, what I'm asking is, is this just chance or did our material environment around our evolution influence our preferences for climate? How does this influence our generally preferred humidity? How does this impact our hair, our skin, our eyes, and is this even a useful area to investigate? Does this have any ramifications, should we seek to replicate controlled aspects from this climate in our daily lives? I have quite a few questions...\n\nThank you, I hope this question is satisfactory!",

She thought  that in American society(this might happen in other English speaking  countries as well) that Romance was seen as primarily a \"Young people  thing.\"\n\nFor instance, that Young  people go to a big city they start a band, engage a the whole \"hook up  culture\" they might have a few partners before settling down with  someone then moving to the suburbs and buying a house. And stop playing  with their band. Instead, switching to a more \"practical career\" maybe  working at an office. Hence, you see the whole \"dead bedrooms\"  phenomenon. There's also an element of stop hanging out with friends and  focus \"inward\" towards the nuclear family.\n\n**Some of you guys might think that this is Universal.**  However, I would say that's not necessarily the case and I think that  live in America and the other English speaking countries is much more  \"structured\" and even \"rigid\" like,  \"this is what I should be doing at a  certain age..etc.\"\n\nHere are some examples of that I've observed:\n\n**Spain**: I have seen it with Spain that people go with their children to bars.\n\n**Colombia**: It seems continue to go to Nightclubs even after having children. Nightclubs are places to have fun with friends.\n\n**France**:  I have seen it in French society that even if married people are more  into sex hence less likely to have deadbedrooms and also it seems  \"affairs\" are more allowed.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI'd  like to add that it might not just be that \"Americans and other English  speaking countries\" are more \"puritanical.\" But also, because of  corporations grouping people into demographics.  Like people from 18-24  should be watching X show, people from this other age group should be  doing Y activity..etc.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

During school I was a security supervisor for my campus’s many libraries and officers, did a CRM field school, and worked a semester in a bioarchaeology lab.\n\nSince 2018 I’ve been working as a fraud investigator for one of the major financial institutions, leveraging anthro’s skills in “finding the patterns” and my experience supervising security; however, I’ve always been a nature boy at heart, being raised in a rural area and spending most time outdoors. The pandemic threw a wrench into my career plans and I’ve been stuck working behind a computer for way longer than my sanity can tolerate.\n\nMy senior year, I took a graduate course in Environmental Anthropology from one of my favorite professors, and it was an amazing experience meshing together my love of human culture and our beautiful planet. Since then, I’ve dreamed of having a career gaining first-hand knowledge of local environmental practices in the contexts of mitigating damage and our changing climate (hence that minor in atmos science), but I’m unsure of what that may look like in real life.\n\nWith my background, are there any careers/job titles someone may be able to recommend that seem relevant or any resources I can be pointed to for guidance? Or is it possible my bachelor’s degree isn’t enough and that I should look into a master’s program? An advanced degree has long been a dream, but the pandemic and inflation have created new anxieties I’m working through.\n\nAppreciate any thoughts or opinions! Thanks!",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnthropology/comments/10pq89i/is_culture_quantifiable_what_about_technology/",
        "text": "I don't mean to ask in any sort of superior or inferior sense. But is culture something that can be quantified, or is it a concept that simply cannot? I got into this discussion a few times on random posts and I figured I should just make a post about this as to prevent random tangents and annoyances here. I agree with the idea that an anthropologist should look into cultures without its own cultural bias, like aliens observing humans. I also accept that I have my own cultural bias too and try to look past it as best as I can. I have accepted things like morality being subjective too. So I am trying to open my views into the field of anthropology and sociology. But there is only so much time for me to read books and so much interest on my part. I realize anthropology aims away from ideas of superiority and inferiority, as it started as a field to justify taking advantage of people seen as primitive in European culture, rather than to truly understand it. But I also like to know reasons for avoiding some aspects just to know that there is a logical reasoning behind it and not just an attempt to avoid offensive topics. Like, I get not stating any culture is better or more advanced among humans as a factual and logical stance, and to not look at technological progress as a default. Out culture seems to hold technology on a pedestal, even if the new tech is a few steps back at the moment (EVs, electric windows when they 1st came out, etc).   \n\n\nEvery culture has things they are good and bad at, and not every culture focuses on new technology. Can culture be quantified between different species? Like monkeys and crows? All culture has technology and what is considered technology can be subjective. Lots of new technology involves using older tech in new ways, or is centered around a technique rather than a physical item. But can you say a culture has more technology than another? Like, if 1 culture had the means to create all the same weapons and tools, could do all the same art forms, has more effective medicine leading to an ability to cure more diseases and increase lifespan, more geographic knowledge, more knowledge on plants and a larger variety of species. Can you say they have more technology? Like, if we took western culture with access to the internet and the bulk of human knowledge, and compared them to the Sentinelese. I'm not talking about culture or any concept of superiority with culture. No doubt I am sure there are all sorts of fascinating things among Sentinelese culture (and would love to learn more about them). Perhaps a supportive society for mental health, cool religion and beliefs, and no doubt they would know best how to survive in their environment if starting with nothing, what foods, medicines, etc. are around them. But if we were to take a body of knowledge around tools, weapons, medicine, food, agriculture, etc. I would think any culture aware of the rest of humanity and the world, and access to the internet would have a quantifiable larger amount of technology. I understand in an anthropomorphic sense, they might not hold that technology to any sort of value, but what if they did? What if they prized the idea of more effective antimalarial and antibiotic drugs? Again, I am sure their culture is fascinating and has us beat in many other aspects. Also my cultural bias would make me prefer living in western culture. I get staying away from concepts about superiority and inferiority, but what about simply stating more or less? I don't doubt people would have better mental health there. I also get that anthropology just aims to study culture and not exactly compare it, though I think it can be beneficial for our culture to observe things that work in other cultures and try to adopt them too. I simply ask about what can and cannot be quantified or qualified? And with that, how much in theory there can be objectivity to, even if we don't have any way to measure it.    \n\n\nIf one culture focused on minimalistic stuff and another was full of tradition, had more art, etc. Could you say 1 culture has more culture than the other? Or does one just have more artifacts and traditions while another culture just stresses minimalism?  \n\n\nWhat about between different species? What is the bare minimum before something is considered to have culture? I have heard once a species teaches new things to their off spring that get passed on. If this is the bare minimum, is it accurate to say monkeys have less culture than humans? What about if we came upon a highly advanced alien species? You could probably say their technology, intelligence, influence, etc. is more advanced, but what about culture? It would be much older probably. They would have had culture longer. Does culture have any way to advance? Or is all culture across all creature equal? I get modern anthropology rejects the idea that technological progress is the default pathway for a culture. Going from hunter-gatherer to agrarian is not the standard. If a culture aimed to remove aspects of culture and aim for objective truths and minimalism, do they have less culture? or is it just part of their culture to operate that way? If we ignore that concept, could one say the second a species can be classified as having culture, it is on the same level with human kind? Does everyone agree on a definition or concept for culture?  \n\n\nWhere does one culture start and end? There are sub-cultures. heavy metal, gamer culture, hippy and stoner culture. There are cultural concepts adopted through globalization and capitalism. One could call something American culture, but it would seem that there are noticeable differences between west coast, east coast, deep south, northern states, etc. Is there a human culture with loosely shared concepts (minimizing suffering as best as one could do but in different ways)? If something is vastly more popular among a variety of cultures, can it be a tip towards what may be more natural or typical for humans? I get humans are cultural and social creatures, so creating and taking place in culture seems like a natural stance. I don't mean to make an appeal to nature here, as historically, things like war are very common among us and other species, but not good things. I also realize we are very diverse and adaptive. With things like monogamy being more popular among cultures, could one person say more people are inclined to engage in it, without disregarding the various polygamous aspects to other cultures as not being typical? If someone looked at the social and mating practices of species like bonobos and chimps, one could say bonobos are a matriarchal society and chimps are one with an alpha-male structure. I understand some cultures like the Iroquois were matriarchal, while some cultures in the middle east saw wealthy and powerful men have a harem of wives. So I get we are heavily adaptive.  \n\n\nIs culture quantifiable? I remember Richard Dawning's concept of the meme. His premise being that in biology, evolution happens at the gene level and that is the minimum unit, and so he figured meme would be like a minimal unit of culture that change enacts upon. But I have talked with some people here who are very annoyed by the concept as Dawning's was speaking way out of his field, and that culture doesn't work in that way. Though it would seem that memes do multiply, spread, change, and die out, it would not be a larger pic of how culture changes. I have a bit of a background in biology, so I tend to want to quantify and qualify things, but I tend to go with the experts in their field and would think Dawning's was wrong. I saw someone here who said that they avoid the concept of cultural evolution, which seemed strange to me, because it clearly does change and adapt, but through different methods, but I think they said they wanted to avoid the word because it brings about misconceptions.   \n\n\nI see contradictions between biologists, anthropologists, sociologists, and psychologists. I have taken an interest into human behavioral biology and psychology and tend to see things contrasted between them. By no means do I think there is a simple answer to human behavior. I also find it fascinating how various psychological conditions can manifest differently depending on the culture they occur in. I have fallen out of the simplistic thinking of biological essentialism for the most part. Human genome project showed that genes are way more complex than we thought. Environment leads to different expression of genes, and epigenetics can rely on the environment of your parents and grandparents. The human brain develops as a result of culture, environment, and even language and their impact on biology (genome, epigenome, nutrition, toxins, etc). Recently took a liking into Sapolsky and his Behave book, but I see some criticism that he focuses too much into biology and doesn't give the other fields credit. By no means do I think it is simple, and I get it is normal for different fields to have different explanations though.  \n\n\nTLDR: I get a little meta. What is culture? What is technology? Can you quantify those things between different species? What about different groups of humans? What concepts are purely subjective in this field and what are objective (even if we have no way to measure)? What are some things that we reject because they are objectively wrong (one culture being better being rejected I would think is objective and not factual). What are some things we reject due to the historic and harmful baggage that anthropology carries with it and culture-centrism? What can we quantify and qualify? Is quantitative and qualitative analysis purely something used in the hard sciences and life science? Or does it have a place in the humanities? No doubt anthropology and life science use things from each other and hard sciences. Anthropology uses biology when it comes to genetics and anatomy, and biology uses chemistry when it comes to genetics and biochem. What are some objective truths within anthropology? What is purely subjective?",

The following is the best possible recollection of my date's social anthropology lecture. I was drunk.\n\n* Two individuals in conversation form a dyad. One speaker will become the \"alpha\" and dominate the other, who will be subserviently polite and listen for the most part. Let's call them the \"sub\". The sub gets to speak up, respond, and interject... but the alpha tends to lead the conversation.\n* Three individuals in conversation form a triad. One alpha speaker will dominate two subs. If there are two alpha personalities, they can generally split the floor time without issue while the sub nods along and gets in a couple \"yea, uh huhs\" now and then.\n* Four individuals in conversation and things get slightly complicated. 1 alpha + 3 subs... everyone smiles and nods while the alpha rambles on. 2 alphas and 2 subs... the alphas find enough space to give-and-take, sharing leadership of the conversation back and forth without much conflict. Bids for conversational leadership by the subs are batted down quickly. Both of the alphas find fertile ground with the subs, who focus their attention on one or the other. No one is being ignored.\n* Five individuals in conversation and we've now reached ***the tipping point.*** In any group of 5, there are bound to emerge 2 alphas. By nature, alphas would prefer to lead the conversation than to give deference. But now, we have enough people in the circle for a quorum. The stress of sharing conversational leadership between the two alphas begins to erode the polite social fabric that held the subs' attention. One of the alphas starts to win floor time over the other. Unable to tolerate the tension, the second alpha looks for a lifeline. And ***(aha!)*** finds it in the most deferential sub of the group. While the first alpha carries on with 2 sub listeners, the second alpha has succeeded in drawing away the attention of the 3rd sub. And here again, we  have a new dyad and triad.\n\n**The Rule of Five** basically states that no social conversation can tolerate 5 active participants. My date said it was a theory she learned about through her social anthropology studies.\n\n**REQUEST:** \n\nCan anyone validate this theory with a reference? Every 5-6 months I remember the idea, furiously search google for 20min, and give up with no results. I want it to be true so I can keep using the story to kill time at cocktail parties.\n\n**NOTE:** \n\nLater (much later), I was able to get this wiki reference from my date but it didn't really sound like the full theory she had described.

        "text": "Hello,\n\nSome time ago, I took an interest in understanding magic as a social/cultural phenomenon.\n\nSomeone recommended reading The Golden Bough. This book is really LONG but surprisingly easy to read, considering the publication year.\n\nI was wondering if this book has a good reputation in the academic community. Some of the terminology (\"savages\") is a bit cringey, but I understand that it's appropriate for the time in place it was written. I'm actually surprised by the author's acknowledgment (between the lines) that women were punished for silly superstitions/ sympathetic magic.\n\nAlso, the content of the book is a bit daunting. I'm reading chapter 3 now, which is quite long (120 pages on my phone), and it's mostly long blocks of text providing different examples of the author's thesis/argument. I'm wondering if the entire book (1700 pages 😞) is structured like this. I enjoy the occasional zingers, but I'm hoping for a bit more substances beyond numerous examples of a certain aspect of magic. \n\nI don't expect the author to elaborate on each of his examples, but the structure of the chapter is a bit boring because it's just a list of examples with no discussion about where it came from, how it was developed, etc.\n\nI just want to know if this improves and picks up the pace, or am I facing 1700 page more of the same?",

What was it, if any?\n\nFinally, how much of the European admixture in the American Indian genome is the result of colonial era sexual violence?

And it was a hit!\n\nQuite the achievement for an all Central American cast in a movie completely subtitled. \n\nAnd yet upon further research I’ve found that it was excoriated as racist on the part of Gibson. Now don’t get me wrong, I understand looking at this with a raised eyebrow because of Gibson’s past history but I don’t quite get what was racist about this?\n\nThe Spaniards at the end of the movie, which a lot of people criticized as being   “White saviors”, certainly didn’t feel that way to me. It felt ominous and foreboding. Not like they were being saved.  \n\nI know *it’s not* historically accurate of course, no more then The Patriot or Braveheart was. But I don’t see racism. Hopefully there’s some people of Central American descent that could give their perspective.",
