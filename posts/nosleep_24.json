        "text": "I loaded my cart with cleaning supplies and towels and made my way down the hallway. Doors stretched down both sides, opening to rooms needing to be cleaned and prepared for new guests. I took a moment to count them. 8 on each side. If I was lucky, it would stay that way, at least until I was finished. I opened the first door on the right to begin my work, and sighed. Instead of the cozy hotel room, with white linens and generic art, that I was expecting, there was a living room, with old couches and beige carpeting. This would have been sometime in the 90’s, based on the furniture. I stepped inside to take a closer look. There was a mug on the coffee table, “World’s Best Dad” painted on it is childish lettering. I had made that for my father in 2nd grade. I looked around for anything else that might place this as a specific event or time. Then I saw the lamp. My mom told me it was an heirloom, handed down to her from her mother and her grandmother before that. Privately, I had always thought it was ugly, with its heavy stained-glass shade casting strange shadows that spooked me whenever I made the mistake of turning it on at night. Now, it was shattered on the ground, bits of glass embedded in the carpet, a rubber ball lying guiltily on a bed of fragments. I sighed and approached the mess, grabbing a dustpan from my cart to clean up the glass. As I knelt, I heard the door to the hallway slam shut behind me and I could feel the question hanging in the room, I rolled my eyes.\n\n“Yes, I remember when this happened. I was about 9, and I was playing with the ball in the house. I knew I wasn’t supposed to, but I did it anyway. When I broke the lamp, I blamed it on my sister. She was 13 and she’d been caught by my mom throwing the ball in the house earlier that day. She said I was lying, but my mom believed me. She grounded her for a week, and she missed the school ski trip she had been looking forward to for months. I’m not sure she ever forgave me for that.”\n\nI finished sweeping up the shards, then picked up the base and the ball and tossed them in the garbage bag hanging from my cart. \n\n“I should have owned up to my mistake, and I certainly shouldn’t have let Veronica get punished for it. I was jealous because I didn’t get to go skiing too, so I ruined it for her. I thought she deserved it. It was a shitty thing to do.”\n\nI heard the door to the hallway open again, and I rose, pushing the cart back out of the room. I closed the door to room 201 and moved on to the next door down the hallway. The door to room 203 didn’t open. I tried every key on my ring, but it stuck fast, so I continued to room 205. This door opened easily. Inside was a king-sized bed with crisp white linen, flanked by two bedside tables, a creamy white carpet, a wooden desk, a couple of armchairs and an armoire. I breathed a sigh of relief. Just an ordinary room, pristine and untouched. It didn’t take me long to restock the minibar and refresh the towels. As I returned to the hallway, I heard a bell chime. Guests. They didn’t have a reservation, but no one ever did. People didn’t come here on purpose, after all. They just sort of ended up here, at the end of whatever road they were travelling. At least, that was how it had been for me. I hurried to the front desk. It wouldn’t do to keep them waiting. \n\nI arrived at the front desk to find a couple, arguing quietly. \n\n“You are always doing this!” she hissed. “I will not have this argument again. There isn’t anything going on, you are just jealous, and I am just about at the end of my rope.”\n\n“What, are you implying that I am making this all up?”\n\n“Yes! You are paranoid, you think that I am…”\n\nThey both fell silent as they noticed me approaching. \n\n“Welcome to Ultima Resort,” I put on my best customer service smile. “What can I do for you today?”\n\n“Do you have any vacancies? We have been looking for a place to spend our Valentine’s vacation, but everywhere nearby was booked.”\n\n“Yes, sir,” I smiled. “Would you like a view of the forest, or the pool and courtyard?”\n\n“I’m surprised you can accommodate us at such short notice,” the man looked around the lobby. “This place is spectacular. A pool, spa, tennis courts. When we turned onto that gravel road, I expected a dump. No offense.”\n\n“None taken. We are a bit off the beaten path here, so we are rarely ever booked up.”\n\n“Well, it must be our lucky day,” he laughed, pulling out a credit card.\n\n“Yeah, real lucky,” the woman muttered.\n\n“We are certainly glad to have you with us, Mr.” I checked his card. “Anderson.”\n\n“Well, if you have it, a room overlooking the woods would be ideal.”\n\nI jiggled the mouse on the computer and pulled up the booking software. It should have shown every empty room, but despite the fact that no one had checked in in days, the only room that showed as available was room 203. Well, it did overlook the forest. Good enough. \n\n“How long are you planning to stay?” I asked politely. \n\n“Well, we took some time off for a romantic vacation, so we’ll be here though the weekend until Valentine’s. Let’s say we will be checking out on Wednesday.”\n\n“No problem at all,” I keyed the reservation into the system, along with their required information. “I can show you to your room now, do you need any help with your luggage?”\n\n“I have a case in the car.”\n\nI pressed a button under the desk and Manny emerged from the back. \n\n“Can you help Mrs. Anderson get her luggage?”\n\nHe nodded and went about his task without further comment, following her out to the car. When they returned, I led the couple upstairs, towards room 203. For a moment, I was worried that the door would still be stuck, but this time when I inserted my key, the door swung open easily. I shouldn’t have been concerned. As the room came into view, Mrs. Anderson shrieked and dropped her bag. \n\n“Jessi, what’s the matter?” her husband put a hand on her arm, but she pulled away sharply. \n\nThere was nothing obvious in the room that would have triggered that reaction, though the décor was a bit odd, for a hotel. The bed was large and draped in black silk sheets. The floors were a gleaming mahogany and there were a pair of plush, leather armchairs in the corner. There was no minibar, no armoire, and the art on the walls was an abstract series, depicting a woman in various stages of undress. Jessi Anderson was staring at the painting above the bed, where the woman appeared to be fully nude, her face was deathly pale. \n\n“Did you have them do this?” she whirled on her husband.\n\n“What?”\n\n“Don’t fuck with me Brad! How did you even get these!?”\n\n“I don’t know what you are talking about, Jessi. What is it?”\n\n“You are trying to tell me you have nothing to do with these paintings?”\n\n“Of course not. How would I have anything to do with the paintings in a hotel I have never been to? What is the problem with the paintings anyway? They are a bit risqué for a hotel, I suppose, but this is meant to be a romantic weekend, maybe…”\n\nShe rounded on me, \n\n“We need another room, right now.”\n\n“I’ll see what else is available, ma’am. I’m sorry for the trouble.”\n\nI pulled out my key and tried room 201 next door. The door opened to an utterly prosaic room with white linens and an armoire, as expected. Jessi approached the door cautiously, but relaxed when she looked inside. \n\n“This is much better,” she huffed, pushing past me into the room. “You should consider redecorating that room, it really is in poor taste.”\n\nShe tried to sound offended, but I could see her hands shaking as she passed me. It wasn’t any of my business. I had learned that a long while ago. Still, I couldn’t help but be curious. Her husband followed her into the room with a worried look on his face. I turned to close and relock the door to 203, taking one final look at the paintings as I did.\n\n“Where did you pull those from, anyway?” a murmured quietly.\n\n“You shouldn’t talk to them,” Manny appeared behind me, presumably having dropped the bags off next door. \n\nThere was a time that would have made me jump, but I was used to it by now, so I just turned,\n\n“I wasn’t exactly talking to them, just… musing.”\n\n“It’s not a good idea,” he reiterated. “If you ever want to get out, do your job and keep your distance.”\n\n“Do you really think we are getting out, Manny? After all these years?”\n\n“If we resolve what holds us here, sure,” Manny shrugged. He didn’t like talking about it.\n\n“What if it is unresolvable? Do you think we could be stuck here forever?”\n\n“No, not forever. There are three ways out, after all. We have to take one of them eventually.”\n\n“That’s a little fatalistic, isn’t it?”\n\n“Excuse me,” the husband’s voice came from down the hall.\n\n“This is not an appropriate time for this conversation,” Manny shook his head. “Go see to your job.”\n\nI sighed. He was right. It also wasn’t fair of me to talk like that with him. Manny had been here even longer than I had, I shouldn’t force him to consider such things. I shook my head and returned to room 201. \n\n“Yes, sir. How can I help you?”\n\n“My wife is obviously very tense,” he murmured conspiratorially. He was trying to play it off as a bit of a joke, but there was a darkness behind his eyes. “Is there any way we could get an appointment at the spa?”\n\n“Certainly, sir.” I pulled out my phone. “There is an appointment available in an hour. I will return and show you the way, if you like? It can be a bit tricky for new guests to find.”\n\n“Thank you.”\n\nI left to let them settle in, heading down the hall to continue my cleaning. Out of habit, I counted the doors. 10 now, on each side. I had better hurry, then.\n\nAn hour later, I approached the door to room 201 to retrieve the Andersons. I could hear them arguing through the door. \n\n“…I don’t even understand what you are upset about! Can’t we just relax and enjoy our weekend?”\n\n“I know what you did, Brad. If won’t admit it…”\n\n“Admit what!? I didn’t even know we were coming here. You saw the road sign, you suggested we try this place! How could I possibly have ‘set you up’. And set you up for what?”\n\n“You know very well. I don’t understand you. You never have time for me, but you do have time for some elaborate plot? What do you think this will accomplish, anyway? I haven’t done anything wrong.” \n\n“Excuse me for having to work for a living.”\n\n“You are *always* working, you never have time for the things I want to do. You were even supposed to be working this weekend. What changed, Brad?”\n\n“I was planning this as a surprise for you, Jessi!”\n\n“For me, huh? Well, did you consider that maybe I had other plans? Did you consider me at all, before dragging me out here, to the middle of nowhere?”\n\n“What plans did you have?”\n\n“Nothing, just forget it.”\n\nThe silence that followed seemed like my best opportunity, so I knocked firmly. Brad Anderson opened the door, \n\n“What?”\n\n“I’m here to bring you to the spa, if you are ready?”\n\n“Of course we are,” Jessi Anderson snapped, pushing past me. “You are five minutes late, in fact. I don’t appreciate being kept waiting. Don’t let it happen again.”\n\nBrad Anderson shrugged apologetically and looked at the ground. There was a time I wouldn’t have put up with that treatment, but frankly, starting a fight risked my job. So, instead, I put on my best smile,\n\n“My apologies, ma’am. If you please follow me, I’ll get you there as quickly as I can.”\n\nWe walked through the courtyard in tense silence. As we passed the pool, Manny looked up from skimming the azure water and jerked his chin towards the sun, just starting to dip below the canopy of the trees. I nodded. It would be dark soon enough. I would need to make sure everyone was back in the hotel before then, and that they were in their room by midnight. I checked my watch.\n\n“Just so you are aware, the dining room closes at 8pm, so once you are finished at the spa, if you would like to return for a meal…”\n\n“8pm? That’s ridiculous!” Jessi whirled on me. “Why is it closed so early? This is terrible customer service.”\n\n“If that is a problem, we also offer room service up until midnight. Then all services are shut down until the morning.” \n\n“This is absurd. In bed by midnight? What, am I living with my parents? We should never have come to this dump…”\n\n“Jessi, please,” Brad tried to calm his wife.\n\n“Of course, you would take her side!” \n\nShe pushed her husband aside and stomped off into the spa door, now visible at the end of the path. \n\n“Jessi, wait!” her husband ran after her. \n\nI sighed. Perhaps I should try to tell them.\n\n“You can’t say anything,” this time Manny did make me jump. “You know that.”\n\n“Why would you think I was…”\n\n“I know that look in your eyes,” he shrugged. “You know how this goes. Even if you try, they won’t believe you. And it would be *poor customer service*,” he held my eyes. “They have to make their own choices; you can’t do it for them.”\n\nMy shoulders slumped,\n\n“You’re right. I know,” I looked up into the forest canopy. “I know!”\n\n“Don’t talk to them,” he admonished me one last time before he returned to the pool. \n\nI turned and jogged towards the spa. I still had a job to do.\n\nI was just locking up the dining room when I heard a commotion behind me and turned to see Mrs. Anderson stomping down the main staircase, wobbling slightly on her high heels. \n\n“What is the meaning of this!?” she was holding something in her hands, shaking it frantically as she approached.\n\nI couldn’t tell, she was moving it too much, all I caught was a blur of pink and a flash of silver. Finally, she stopped in front of me, holding them out the way a person might a dirty diaper or a dead animal. She swayed slightly as she stood. From her fingers, dangled a pair of fuzzy pink handcuffs and some silky lingerie. I cleared my throat,\n\n“Well, ma’am. I they appear to be…” \n\n“That isn’t what I meant,” she cut me off; up close, her breath reeked of wine, she had had quite a lot to drink at dinner. “I mean why was it in our room?”\n\n“I couldn’t say, ma’am.”\n\n“They were right in the middle of our bed when we returned to our room. They weren’t there when we left.”\n\n“Maybe your husband…”\n\nI didn’t get to finish before she slapped me. \n\n“No! Someone was in our room, and I demand to know who.”\n\nI rubbed my cheek. She didn’t hit especially hard, but her wedding ring was probably going to leave a mark. \n\n“Ma’am, I can assure you that no one was in your room.”\n\nShe moved to hit me again, but her husband had finally caught up to her and he grabbed her shoulder,\n\n“Jessi, what are you doing? What has gotten into you?”\n\nShe whirled on him, the look on her face almost feral. \n\n“We are leaving this place, right now!” she demanded. “Get our bags, we are checking out.”\n\n“Jessi…”\n\n“Shut up, Brad. I’m not staying here another minute. Either come with me, or I’m going on my own.”\n\n“Ma’am, I wouldn’t advise leaving now,” I risked chiming in. “You should probably wait until morning. It is… easy to get lost on these back roads in the dark.”\n\n“Maybe she’s right, Jessi,” Brad pleaded. “Please. We can ask for another room, if you are worried someone was in there.”\n\nMrs. Anderson paused, staring at the lingerie for a long moment,\n\n“You didn’t put these there, did you?” she asked her husband softly. \n\n“No, I told you…”\n\n“Then we can’t stay here. We need to leave.”\n\n“Alright,” Brad raised his hands in surrender. “I’m sorry, could we check out now?”\n\nI nodded politely,\n\n“Yes, sir. I will get your bill together.”\n\nI watched the Andersons’ taillights retreating into the night. I could go clean up their room, but what was the point? They would be back. I checked my watch, 9:30. Hopefully they would return before 12, because if they arrived any later, they were on their own. I turned and walked back to the front desk. \n\nWhen I heard the bell some time later, I was surprised to see not the Andersons, but a stranger standing at the desk. He blandly handsome and I’d have guessed he was in his early twenties, but the dark circles under his eyes made him look older. I plastered on a smile.\n\n“Good evening, sir. Welcome to Ultima Resort, how may I help you?”\n\nHe returned my smile hesitantly,\n\n“I don’t have a reservation. I hope that is ok. I… just saw a sign on the highway and decided to stop, on a whim. Do you have any vacancies?”\n\n“Yes, sir,” I tapped on the keyboard and a room flashed on the screen. “Room, 203 is available. I can take you up there now. Do you have any luggage?”\n\nHe shook his head as he handed me a credit card.\n\n“No, I wasn’t even really planning to stay anywhere tonight. I was just out driving… thinking. I don’t really have anything with me.”\n\n“That’s no problem,” I entered his information into the system. “Well, Mr. Templeton, follow me, please.”\n\nI opened the door to room 203 to find it unchanged from my last visit. Same art, same odd furnishings. Mr. Templeton seemed as shocked as the last guest had. He stared at the paintings,\n\n“Where did you get these?” he asked. \n\n“I couldn’t say, sir,” that was true enough. I could never say where these things came from.\n\nHe stepped into the room, placing a hand on the nude above the bed,\n\n“These are my paintings. I haven’t sold these. Hell, I’ve barely sold anything at all. How could they be here?”\n\nI stood awkwardly in the doorway. I didn’t really have an answer to give him. \n\n“Would you like another room, sir?”\n\n“No,” he said very quietly. “I must be… seeing things?” he forced a laugh. “Maybe I just need to get some sleep. That’s it, I’m just going to go to sleep.”\n\nHe stepped inside and shut the door. A moment later, I heard the bell again, so I turned and went back downstairs.\n\nThe Andersons were waiting for me when I arrived. Brad looking sheepish and Jessi seemed to have been crying, her cheeks were puffy and red. She didn’t meet my eyes.\n\n“I’m sorry, ma’am,” Brad said, abashed. “It seems we might need to stay the night after all. Any chance our room is still available?”\n\nI looked at the clock, 11:30. They had made it just in time. \n\n“Certainly, sir,” I handed him back the key.\n\n“We tried to get back to the highway for hours and we just kept ending up back here. You were right about the roads being confusing in the dark. Couldn’t get a cell signal either, so no map.”\n\n“Yes, the signal can be a bit spotty out here in the wilderness,” I said apologetically. “I am sure you will have better luck finding the road tomorrow. If you still want to leave.”\n\n“Thank you. I apologize again for the trouble.”\n\n“No trouble, it’s my job,” I replied. “Just so you know, the staff turns in at midnight, so if there is anything you need before you go?”\n\n“No, we are fine, thank you. Have a good evening.”\n\nBrad took his wife by the shoulder and guided her up the stairs. \n\nI finished entering the data into the system, then turned and hurried down the back hall to where my room should be, it was nearly midnight so I couldn’t waste time. My heartrate increased as I went, and as I reached the corner before my door, I found myself holding my breath. Would it be there? Had I done enough? I didn’t exhale until I caught site of room 111, right where it belonged. I unlocked the door, slipped inside and slammed it behind me, triple bolting it before I turned. Laid out on the bed was a clean, crisp new uniform and a tray with a steaming bowl of stew. I smiled. They were satisfied with my work today. That was good. I was hungry, and going to bed without a meal was not a pleasant experience. I stripped off the uniform I was wearing and dropped it into the laundry bag, then put on my pajamas and settled in to eat. The food was pretty good tonight, I must have exceeded their expectations. When I finished eating, I rose to put the tray by the door for the morning, and found a bottle of whiskey waiting there. I shook my head,\n\n“Nice try,” I muttered, picking up the bottle and putting it in the armoire with another dozen, unopened bottles. “I’m not falling for that again.”\n\nI certainly wouldn’t have turned that bottle down when I first arrived. But one night I’d gotten too drunk and stumbled out into the hall, after midnight. I shivered at the memory. Never again. And even just a couple of drinks seemed to make the dreams worse. It wasn’t worth it. Instead, I lay down and tried to sleep. \n\nThe brief yelp woke me, I checked the clock, 3:47 am. Groggily, I rose from the bed and went to the peephole. Nothing would compel me to unlock that door, but I was curious. Across the hall from my door, I could see Jessi Anderson, standing in the hall, hand over her mouth, staring at Mr. Templeton, who was just emerging from his room, a pack of cigarettes in his hand. My door hadn’t been across from room 203 when I went to sleep, but that didn’t really mean anything. Maybe Manny was right, I shouldn’t talk to them, it just drew their attention. He never seemed to get these special shows. \n\n“Jessi, is that you?” Templeton’s voice was low, but it carried in the quiet hall.\n\n“Mark? What are you doing here?”\n\n“When I heard you were going away with him for the weekend, I was so upset, I couldn’t stay in our place, alone. I just started driving. I ended up here.”\n\n“You just ‘ended up’ here, Mark? You really expect me to believe that? Then how did the paintings get here, Mark? Who left the negligee *you* bought me on the bed this afternoon?”\n\n“I didn’t even get here until late tonight, Jessi. And I only just found out you were here. I don’t know how those things got there.”\n\n“You don’t know how the room you were *just* in looks exactly like *your* bedroom!?”\n\n“It isn’t just me, then? I thought I was going crazy. But it doesn’t matter. Don’t you see? The fact that we are both here, it’s fate, Jessi. We are meant to be together,” he leaned down and kissed her, running a hand through her dark brown hair. “If you tell him, we can finally start our life. You aren’t happy with him, you know that.”\n\nShe pushed him away,\n\n“I told I’m not leaving my husband for you, Mark. I’m not going to be the wife of a starving artist. We talked about this. Fortunately, this stupid stunt of yours didn’t tip Brad off. Your art is so shit he couldn’t even recognize it was me in those paintings.”\n\n“You said you liked my paintings, Jessi,” he looked like a kicked puppy. \n\n“Mark, you are only good at one thing, I think we both know that,” her voice dripped disdain. “Now, get out of here, before Brad sees you.”\n\n“Too late, Jessi.”\n\nThey both turned to see Brad Anderson, standing in the door of room 201. I caught the gleam of silver in his hand. \n\n“So, this is him, then? The guy you’ve been screwing behind my back?”\n\n“What, no, Brad. I don’t even know who this is. I just ran into him in the hall…”\n\n“Save it. I heard everything, Jess. How stupid do you think I am?” he took a menacing step forward. \n\nI looked down at my phone and for a brief, mad instant I considered trying to call 911. Of course, I had no signal, and even if I did the call would never be answered. They would never find the place, anyway. \n\n“Brad, please, it isn’t what it looks like.”\n\n“Just tell him, Jessi,” Mark interrupted. “Tell him you love me, not him. Tell him you spend every night he works late, in my bed. Tell him.”\n\nJessi Anderson was frozen between the two men, unable to speak, her mouth simply opening and closing wordlessly. Brad stepped past his wife, towards Mark Templeton. The younger man didn’t back down, he poked a finger into his chest. \n\n“She loves me. You know what we talk about when I am screwing her? How pathetic you are. How you can’t satisfy her. We laugh at you, Anderson.”\n\nBrad’s face darkened, twisting into something ugly and frightening. Without breaking eye contact, he plunged the knife into Templeton’s stomach. The other man gasped, staring with disbelief at the blade protruding from his body. Brad Anderson twisted the knife, then yanked it out and Mark collapsed to his knees. That was when Jessi started screaming. \n\n“What did you do? What did you do?” she repeated hysterically. \n\nBrad said nothing, he just stared blankly at her. With no response from him, she turned to Mark, he was on the ground now, blood bubbling from his lips and pooling in a dark circle on the ground around him. That was going to be difficult to get out of the carpet.\n\n“This is all your fault,” she shrieked at his body. “Why did you have to come here? Why did you have to ruin everything? After you seduced me, made me stray, you come here and do this? And you,” she turned back to Brad. “So what if I was sleeping with him? I wouldn’t have done it if you didn’t neglect me. If you didn’t abandon me for your work. If you could have fulfilled my needs. This is as much your fault as it is his! Losers, both of you! I deserved better!”\n\nBrad dropped the knife and turned away, walking back into room 201. Jessi picked up the blade and followed him, still screeching at his back. \n\n“None of this is my fault. You both made me do this. What right do you have to be upset? I am the one who should be angry. I am the victim here…”\n\nThe door to 201 closed behind them and I could no longer make out the words, but I could hear vague shouting that gradually turned into hysterical laughter. Then there was a brief scream that was cut off abruptly. After that, squelching and slurping sounds emanated from the room for what felt like an eternity. I tried to leave the peephole, but I just couldn’t tear myself away. Finally, the room fell silent, and Jessi Anderson emerged from the room, now clad in the negligee, which had been pink when I saw it earlier, but was now saturated in fresh blood. She ran her hands down her body, smearing the blood across her chest and stomach. Then, she paused to wipe the blood dripping from her mouth on the back of her hand. Looking up, she met my gaze through the peephole. Her eyes were completely black. She smiled, blood coating her teeth,\n\n“Thank you for your hospitality, inn keeper. But I won’t be needing the room anymore.”\n\nThen, she blinked, and her eyes were back to normal. She turned and walked slowly down the hall, leaving a trail of wet blood behind her. I finally stepped away from the peephole and crawled back into my bed, trembling under the covers until sleep took me. \n\nIn the morning I emerged into the back hall, where I should have been all along. I almost convinced myself that the events of the previous night had only been one of the usual nightmares, but when I entered the lobby, the bloody prints of bare feet going down the main stairs and out the front door made it clear it wasn’t. Upstairs, the body of Mark Templeton lay in a puddle of congealed blood in the hallway. Inside room 201 I also found the body of Brad Anderson. Well, most of the body. I couldn’t find his head anywhere. I returned to the desk and pressed the button to call Manny, I would need his help to move the bodies. He surveyed the carnage, then turned to me,\n\n“Did the lady make it out?”\n\n“No,” I said softly.\n\n“A shame,” he shook his head. “But not everyone survives facing their demons.”\n\n“You think that’s what they are?”\n\nHe shrugged,\n\n“How would I know? We should hurry and get this cleaned up, before anyone else arrives.”\n\nIt took hours, but we managed to get everything back in order. I was back in my room, changing into a clean uniform when I looked down at my cell phone on the bed. On a whim, I picked it up and dialed my sister’s number. To my surprise, it actually connected. \n\n“Hello?” I could barely make her voice out through the static.\n\n“Ronny? Can you hear me?”\n\n“Barely, is that you, Lucy?”\n\n“It’s me. I just… needed to hear your voice. It has been a long time.”\n\n“Yeah, well whose fault is that, little sis? You never call, you never visit.”\n\n“I know, I’m sorry.”\n\n“So, what’s the occasion?”\n\n“I was just thinking about you the other day. I wanted to apologize, for the lamp, when we were kids.”\n\n“The lamp?”\n\n“You remember, the one I said you broke; you missed the skiing trip?”\n\nThere was a moment of silence and I worried I had lost her, but then she replied.\n\n“Oh yeah! What would make you think of that? I had completely forgotten.”\n\n“I guess I just… felt guilty. I shouldn’t have blamed it on you. I should have apologized a long time ago.”\n\n“It isn’t that big of a deal, Luce. I did worse things to you. We were just kids. You shouldn’t still be dwelling on this decades later. Seriously, you need to learn to let things go.”\n\n“Maybe you are right. Thanks for saying that,” I sighed. “I wish I knew this was really you.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Nothing. Never mind.”\n\n“Well, I’m sorry to cut this short, but I have to go, I have a meeting in 2 minutes. You should come visit for Mom’s birthday, though. She wants to see you.”\n\n“I’ll do my best to make it.”\n\n“Sure, you will.”\n\n“Bye Ronny.”\n\n“Bye Lucy.”\n\nShe hung up and I stared at the phone in my hand for a long time. Then, I heard the bell and rose from my bed. There were more guests to greet.",

        "text": "Everyone talks about scary stories set in the Fall. When the days get shorter and we talk about graveyards and monsters and ghosts. The haunting season. But no one sees that the truly wicked days come in the early months of the year when the Winter is old and the earth is dead. When friends and family have long since gone home and the jollyness and joy has been replaced with emptiness in our hearts. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe wind howls around you when you step into the night. The earth does not shelter you with her leaves and her life so you are hit with the brunt of the rage and hunger of the storm. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe speak life in the Fall as we watch things change and die around us. We mourn. We come together. And then we are left all alone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Winter’s edge creeped into my soul, eating into the little warmth I had. It was making me morbid.  Unfortunately, it would be too long before I could step back into the warmth of my home. I looked at the small pit I had already dug. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMuch too long.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGraves took longer to dig when the ground was frozen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course, that was my own fault. What had I truly expected would happen when I traveled up to Maine in search of the truth in the stories going around about mysterious disappearances? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHunting monsters in the dead of winter, knowing you’ll need to bury the body after as soon as possible was a fool's task. That was like, page 2 of the monster hunter playbook. Something about working smarter not harder.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPage 1 was all about ‘Not all monsters are bad’ and ‘Don’t kill someone just because they’re different’ but that was a story for another time. This one was clearly not in that category based on the cave filled with half eaten corpses. The nail marks and dried blood scratched into the cave floors told enough of a story about this particular monster’s cruelty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe wind howled around me cutting through my coat like it was nothing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFucking winter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFucking ghouls.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe story I had heard around town went that a gorgeous woman had shown up in town about a month ago. Mid December. They knew she wasn’t from around there because the town was all of 400 people and fairly isolated. It wasn’t the kind of place that drew people to it, even in touristy seasons. Certainly not when the temperatures dropped to the teens like it had that winter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer shiny blonde hair and sweet smile hadn’t distracted many people from the fact that she had shown up without a car either. But she had spun a story about an abusive boyfriend and shed a few tears and people were pretty willing to forgive the irregularity of it all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen the first man had gone missing 3 days later, they didn’t immediately blame her. As far as anyone could tell, Morris Clemens and she hadn’t run into each other. Which isn’t to say it wasn’t possible they had, town this size and all, but no one could say they had any ties. And Morris was a big man, used to be a body builder in his younger days till he had hurt his back and stopped doing steroids. Once that happened, Morris stopped depriving himself. The man loved food, carbs and sugars and cheeses. It showed too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo, a little thing like her couldn’t have done much to Morris let alone hid the body after. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe thought was that he had gotten turned around in a storm. A lot of people thought they’d find his body come Spring time run off into a ditch on some back road.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my mind they were all basically back roads. But who was I to judge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen Martha, Camille, James, William, and Seth disappeared too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere had been a trail of blood in James’ house and not his either according to the local lab.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGhouls were insatiable sometimes. They had all disappeared in the space of  week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd that pretty blonde? Well, she was the only difference people could see. They were terrified of her. Someone started sharing her picture online, asking if anyone knew of her. If maybe the same thing had happened elsewhere.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere wasn’t a big response, as you can imagine. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPeople just kept disappearing too. The police tried, but in a town that size there wasn’t much of them either. 3 men and a dog. The dog was on loan from a bigger town.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe community fell into three camps. Those who thought it wasn’t her, the coincidence group. Those who thought it was and barred their houses up to make sure she couldn’t get in. You know, every man for himself. And those who started following her around, our vigilanties. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur online poster fell into that last group, they were the ones to catch my attention too. It was a constant stream of pictures of her in the room she was renting looking more and more stressed out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy the time I got out there, the missing people were up to 28. The town was in a panic and they were not delighted to see  another new face, even if I claimed I was from another police department here to help out. My fake credentials were pretty decent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had followed the woman in question around for the first few days. Or I tried to at least. She never left her room. I had a constant video going through her window too. I know, I’m a creep. There was another camera pointed at her door from the outside. She had access to one room with a bed and a bathroom that I did not monitor but also had no outside access. I sped through the footage each day and she was on camera for all but maybe 30 minutes where she was in the bathroom. Most of the time, that woman just sat in the bed and did nothing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHalf the time someone was banging on her door shouting threats at her. She stared into the eye of my camera through the window as it happened each time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA silent call for help, for someone to step in and do something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few people brought weapons. Two men showed up with rope and a crowbar but hadn’t managed to get in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMeanwhile, person number 29 had went missing and the town was growing more and more hostile.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis time, I got to the scene early and noticed a footprint. A bare foot footprint. Toes and everything dented into the snow. I brushed the ones closest to the house off so no one else would see and pretended to help look with the rest of the people gathered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt night, I went back and followed the prints. I followed them all the way to a cave 2 miles out. And there sat a man. Well, not a man. A ghoul. There sat a ghoul consuming the arm of a man connected to a half eaten body. Bites missing from all over, the stomach eaten all the way back to the spine..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe thing about ghouls is they’re strong but they aren’t that hard to kill if you know what you’re doing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was lucky this wasn’t my first walk around this particular block. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne quick bullet slowed it down, combined with the human food he had eaten with his latest meal’s stomach. Then I removed the head just to be safe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo here I was, digging a hole. The cave full of  human remains would need to be gotten rid of too. As much as closure would have helped the people here, this kind of closure might not be great. Massive traumatic serial killer mojo.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA second shovel dug in nearby.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“He was my ex.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“So not a coincidence that the bodycount started piling up as soon as you walked into town?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“No, not a coincidence. I had really hoped he wouldn’t be able to find me but you know how us ghouls are. We can scent what we’re looking for from quite a ways away. And we just consume consume consume.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I’ve seen the cave, yeah.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Yeah.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe dug in silence for a while, she was making quite a bit more progress than I was. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I hope you won’t try to kill me too.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I haven’t yet.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I’m useful to you at the moment, there’s a lot of graves to dig.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Did you kill any of them?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“No, I wanted to. But I keep my food to the already dead.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Then no, page 1 of the manual. I’m only here to kill what’s killing.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe finished up as the sun began to climb. The ghoul, Janet I had learned her name was, and I stayed a few more days before disappearing into the night. I gave her a lift out of state, bigger cities have better morgues and it was better to put some distance between ourselves and what had happened. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I headed back home, ready to write my adventures into my next novel. Killing monsters pays the bills.",

        "text": "I work in a tech company on the third floor of a four stories building. What’s on the fourth floor though, nobody knows. And no one talks about it. They made that clear on my first day, when I asked the question during the induction.\n\n“Nobody goes there,” the HR Manager replied without holding my glance. “It’s closed. We shan’t talk about the fourth floor.”\n\nI didn’t ask anymore, but I did see the stairs leading up to fourth every day I worked there. Dark stairs leading up into a void. A sign next to it clarified the rule further: the fourth floor is permanently closed. Access forbidden.\n\nOne night, I was late closing a deal. The building was dark and quiet, my desk brightened by a tiny lamp and my desktop’s blue light. I was about to leave, I closed the lamp, when I heard them.\n\nSteps. Slow, steady steps coming from upstairs, from the fourth floor. I shrug it off as imagination, or maybe janitors who still had access to keep the floor clean. I still dashed down the stairs.\n\nBefore getting out, I felt drawn to turn my head and look at the display on the elevator. The number four glowed in the dark lobby. Some had used to elevator to get there. Janitor after all, I thought leaving in a rush.\n\nOnly later on did I think about it. That hadn’t been the first time I had heard the steps. When I entered the building the first time, for the job interview, I had been waiting in front of the door on the third floor. I had had my first look at those eerie stairs, and I did hear steps then too. The same slow, steady steps.\n\nI didn’t give it much importance then, given I was about to have my first job interview. The first after the accident.\n\nBut ever since I’d heard them again that night, I avoided leaving late from work, and after a while I forgot about the elevator and the steps.\n\nThat’s until a month ago I saw the woman in the elevator. \n\nThis time I had come in earlier. The previous night had been rough… It was exactly one year since the accident. One year without Linda.\n\nSince I hadn’t slept a minute, I thought I’d go in and get my mind busy with work. Stop thinking of Linda. Of the frightening phone call, the screams, and the ambulance.\n\nI entered the building at 6.30, two hours earlier than usual. I walked through the entrance and stopped in front of the elevator. The red light on the display showed -1. I assumed someone from management was also coming in early, since they are the only ones who have access to the parking at -1.\n\nThe elevator bell rang, breaking the silence of the sleeping building. The doors slid open. A thin woman was standing inside, her head slightly tilted down, her long black hair covering most of her face. The elevator smelled of rotten meat.\n\nNeither me nor the woman moved. Suddenly, a voice echoed inside my head. A whisper, silent and yet loud. An echo of a woman speaking to me from somewhere far away.\n\n“Come,” the voice whispered. \n\nThen, the doors started closing. Before they did though, the woman moved suddenly and jumped closer. With the doors closing on her face, I just had a glimpse of it.\n\nTwo white bulging eyes looking like they belonged to someone who got stabbed right in their stomach. Frozen, swollen to the point they seemed to be ready to pop out. White as snow. \n\nUnder her two bulging eyes, where one would expect a mouth, was but an empty, dark hollow in the shape of a terrified gape. \n\nIt happened in a second, maybe less. The sound of the doors closing startled me back to reality. I stood frozen in front of the closed doors, before taking the stairs.\n\nI got tho the third floor, short of breath, and turned over my shoulder to look at the elevator’s display. Fourth floor.\n\nWhatever I’d witnessed was now just one floor above me. I shivered, trying to make sense of what I’d just seen. \n\nThen I realised that whoever or whatever I had seen, that face gaping in terror, gave me a strange feeling of familiarity. I got into the office and walked right to the one colleague I knew I could talk to. \n\nHarold was probably the only person I still conceded a beer to after Linda’s violent exit from my life. \n\nHe had a lot going wrong in his life too, and somehow that made me feel better. Not the fact he might have been in more pain than me, no. It’s just I didn’t get the pity that most colleagues and friends had reserved for me since Linda’s death. \n\nHarold had suffered of several psychosis in the past. He had been an addict, and had been pushed out of his hometown, to seek a new life, away from toxic relations, drugs and probably violence. \n\nHis parents had never accepted his downward spiral. They didn’t hesitate to cut him loose, leaving him with just enough money to leave town. In his worst moment, his parents had turned away, refused any responsibility or guilt.\n\nHarold did start a new life. We met when I started in the company. He was there already for a couple of years. \n\nHe looked clean and elegant on the surface, but he had a deep sadness to anyone willing to look. Especially in the nights, when the ghosts, that’s how he described it, started hoovering all over him, depriving him of sleep.\n\n“I’m telling you, she went to the fourth!” I snapped while we were talking in the kitchen. He looked around, concerned someone might have heard me.\n“Nobody goes to fourth…” he replied in an unconvincing whisper. \n“I know you’re hiding something man”, I confronted him. \nHe sighed, before looking me into the eyes. “Let’s go to Sherman’s after work. You need a beer”.\nHe walked away, leaving me alone with my thoughts, with the image of that woman and that odd sense of familiarity.\n\nI didn’t work anymore that day. I was determined to talk with Harold about the woman. To find out what he knew about her and about the fourth floor. \n\n“How’s work man?” I asked him when we sat down at the table at Sherman’s.\n“Meh… Vania is at her worst lately.”\n“You really should do something about her, man”, I took a sip from my pint, before continuing. \n“Do what?” He answered, visibly irritated. “She’s my manager. She’s mean. That’s how life goes. Mean people be mean.”\n“Fuck’s sake, Harold! It’s a job! If you don’t want to fight her, then find another. Everyone needs developers these days… What’s holding you there?”\n\nHe sighed, but didn’t answer. I looked at his face, and I saw a sadness much deeper than the one I was accustomed to recognise on him. \n\n“Hey, can we be honest?” I asked him later. He nodded. “You’ve seen her, haven’t you? The woman in the elevator…”\n\nHe took a moment before answering, then raised his head and looked at me, numbly. \n\n“I don’t know no woman.” He took a sip of his beer, before looking at me again, his eyes trembling. “I’ve seen two people, and I’m pretty sure it was another of my cute hallucinations…” He gestured in the air, as if trying to get rid of the thought, or of the ghosts hoovering around him.\n\nI was taken aback by his answer. It was no hallucination. It was clear now that some creepy folks were hiding something on the fourth floor. \n\nI thought of the sign on the stairs. Nobody goes to the fourth floor… Access forbidden. \n\n“Where did these two people go?” I asked.\n“Well, I saw the elevator stopped on the fourth.”\n“And you don’t think that’s odd?”\n“I don’t know what you want me to tell you!” He snapped. “I hallucinated. Nobody goes on the fourth. We don’t talk about the fourth…”\n\nI was now sure there was more to it, so I grabbed his arm and squeezed it.\n“Harold, I need to know what’s on the fourth floor”, my voice shook, while I thought of the odd familiarity I had felt when I’d seen the woman.\n“I have no idea. I think something happened there or something, and I don’t know… The owner closed it? Or… is renovating it? I don’t know… Nobody knows.” He jerked his arm out of my grasp.\n“Something happened?” I asked.\n“A suicide, former employee. That’s the rumor around the office.”\n“I thought nobody talks about the fourth floor.”\n“Nobody does, but some people wonder sometimes,” he nodded.\n\nSilence broke between us. Harold sighed.\n\n“She wanted me to come with her. The woman, she told me.” I added. He looked at me, his face now tired more than ever. \n“Maybe you should’ve gone then. Find out yourself what’s on fourth.”\n\nA few minutes passed, before he spoke again. \n“Yeah… You know. I think I’m gonna go man.” He stood up, his body right in the pub, his head and soul somewhere else. He gave me a last glance and left. I thought I’d pushed him too much, and felt bad about it. He was clearly having a rough time. I thought I’d apologise the day after, and left as well.\n\nThe day after, I was waiting in front of the elevator again. I’d come in early to make up for the work I hadn’t done the day before. The night had been rough again… I’d dreamed of Linda. Of the phone call, her voice. Of the sirens, and the screams. \n\nI checked the elevator’s display, and swallowed. -1, again.\n\n*DING*\n\nThe doors opened with a frightening rusty sound. I looked right at the woman standing in the elevator. My feet sunk into the floor as I felt as heavy as I’d never felt before.\n\nAnd my hear ached.\n\nThe sirens. The phone call. The screams… Linda’s voice.\n\nBlood was dripping from the face of the woman, when she raised her head. \n\n“L-Linda?” I asked, struggling to believe the words coming out of my mouth. But there was no doubt, I’m still sure the more I think about it. My dead wife, my once graceful Linda, was standing in front of me, blood dripping from her face. In the background, I could hear the sirens of the ambulance.\n\nShe stared at me. I felt each and every bone in my body aching at once, my heart stopped for a second. I was about to take a step towards her. \n\nThen she smiled.\n\nIt was a different smile. Nothing like the ones she had delighted me with during our 5 years together. It was a smile coming from another world, a world where other rules applied. A world I didn’t belong to.\n\nShe tilted her head to one side. I noticed only now how wide her eyes had become. Swollen, like they were ready to pop out.\n\nShe didn’t look graceful now. Yet, it was Linda standing in front of me. I’ve thought about it ever since. About how determined I was to step into the elevator and go up with her, to the fourth.\n\n“Come, Eric…”\n\nI probably think I would’ve come, wouldn’t the doors suddenly have closed, snapping me back to the reality of the dark lobby.\n\nThe elevator left, and I stayed for a few minutes, still. Tears wet my face like they had done every night in the previous week. \n\nEventually, I went upstairs to my desk. I sat down, turned on the laptop and as usual checked my emails. I had a few new ones, but one stood out, sent at 1 AM. It was from Harold.\n\nNow, it’s difficult to explain the events that followed, so I will just state the facts, you make out whatever you want from it.\n\nThe email read:\n\nEric,\n\nI’ve been thinking of it and I can’t switch off these thoughts. I felt the urge to come to the office after our conversation. And I saw them again, in the elevator. I know what I must do. They asked me to go. I didn’t want to at first, but now I think I should.\n\nIt might be what I’ve been looking for all this time.\n\nThe end of the ghosts. \n\nI stared at the screen for a while, before taking action. I rushed to Harold’s department, hoping to see him sit there.\n\nI asked his manager, Vania, where he was. She looked at me like I had asked her to lend me money. “Actually… He’s not here. He didn’t show up. So tell him not to bother to come back!”\n\nI gave her a distracted nod, before turning away. \n\nWhere was Harold? What had he seen upstairs that led him to not show up in the office? He had never missed a day.\n\nI sent him a message asking him to reach out as soon as possible. No reply. I skipped lunch, my stomach was churning but I couldn’t even bear the thought of eating.\n\nI stayed late, checking my phone every two minutes. The day felt incredibly long. Suddenly it was 7 PM. I decided to get back to my desk and get some work done, I hadn’t done anything all day and clearly Harold didn’t want to talk.\n\nThen I heard a sound that will haunt me for the rest of my life. I will dream about it together with Linda’s screams. It will hoover around me like Harold’s ghosts.\n\nThe sound of steps came from right upstairs, from the fourth floor. They started slow, then they accelerated. I followed the sound with my eyes on the ceiling.\n\nThe steps ended with the sound of glass breaking, and a loud thump down in the parking lot. I ran towards the window and looked down.\n\nThat’s where Harold was laying sprawled above a car, twitching in what were his last breaths. \n\nIt’s been a week now, and I keep thinking of what happened. I keep thinking of the sequence of events, I can’t help but doing so. My wife in the elevator, Harold’s emails, the terrifying steps. The strength and the determination of a irreversible decision, the crash through the window.\n\nHad he jumped? Had he been pushed over the window by whoever was living or hiding on the fourth?\n\nI don’t know. All I know is that I resigned yesterday and I refused to come to the office to even sign the papers. I gave up all my benefits and I’m about to leave town.\n\nI don’t want to be near that building anymore. I don’t want to see the elevator anymore. I don’t even want to see that version of Linda. \n\nWhatever the fourth floor hides, I don’t want to know. \n\nWe shan’t talk about the fourth floor. Nobody goes to the fourth floor.",

        "text": "For context, I am a professional wilderness explorer. Since I was young, my passion had been geared towards the wilderness. I have hiked on rough terrain in many countries. I know the wilderness like it was my own precious child. I research what specific wildlife lives in the area before I go hiking, so I know what to be prepared for. That's what makes this ordeal even more terrifying.\n\nOne day, while browsing through a travel site for West Virginia, I saw a pop-up for a specific mountain trail. Again, nothing seemed out of the ordinary while researching, and it really seemed like the ideal hiking spot, leading up to a beautiful view showing a gorgeous blue lake.\n\nWhen researching the trail, it was mentioned that the area was very isolated, with the nearest town being 123 miles away. It seemed very enticing. Of course, it had to normal flora and fauna of the region, and it didn't seem odd. It did mention not to disturb the wildlife and to watch where you step because of many false footholds,  \nthat would break away and cause you to fall down the Cliffside. Overall, it's just the normal mountain trail.\n\nI spent about a month preparing for this trip. I made sure to contact everyone I knew so they would know where I was in case I went missing. I then drove there and started my hike.\n\nOnce I got there, I relished at the beauty of it all. The start of the trail had a view of many peaks staring down at you, and I thought to myself how the view looked like giant gods, towering over the world. I then started on the trail.\n\nAt first, everything was fine. It was your typical mountain trail. I made sure I took a break every fifteen minutes or so, so I didn't overwork myself and have to call quits. \n\nIt was around my fifth break that things started to seem off. The birds had stopped singing, and I couldn't hear the chattering of insects. I didn't even hear the wind blowing through the trees. It was as if everything had vanished.\n\nAfter about five minutes, I started on the hike again. I was a little nervous and on edge, though, because I was the loudest thing there. It felt wrong, as though I was being watched, stared down by some malevolent force, playing with me. \n\nI continued, until around break number twenty. \n\nI stopped, getting out my bottle of water, as I had done multiple times before. But as I was putting the bottle to my lips, I realized something was off. I heard twigs snapping, about ten feet behind me. I threw my water bottle down and turned around to see what I heard.\n\nI can't describe exactly what I saw. That is a bit too difficult. The creature I saw was vaguely humanoid, bipedal, with pale, paste like skin. Its face, though, was certainly not. It had eyes that I can only describe as being too big to fit its face. Its face, though small, still surrounded the eyes, bit I swear its eyes were too big. The creatures mouth was indescribable, but I think the closest I could use for you to picture it would be to say that it was somewhere in between a human and a dog mouth, with five layers of knife like teeth. Its hands were freakishly large, about the size of my arm, with long skinny fingers to match. About the rest of it, I can't really describe. It was a sort of blur, almost hard to see. That's all I remember about its lower half.\n\nI stood still, staring at the thing. It hadn't noticed me yet, but it wouldn't be long before it did. \n\nIt was then that I started to sneeze, and then the creature really noticed me. \n\nIt turned its head around, but instead of attacking me, it spoke.\n\n\"Ahnigi'a\" it said, in a deep guttural voice. \n\n\"I don't understand,\" I said, confused, startled by its speaking.\n\nIt looked at me, pushed its head forward, as if to say \"leave\".\n\nI then started to run, leaving in fear. I made sure it didn't follow, and I ran till I got to my cat.\n\nI recently tried to do research, but I haven't found anything on it. \n\nBut what I do know is that it spoke in cherokee. It told me to leave. I have researched the region and have seen that many people have come up missing there. I now think about the human like sorrow in that creatures eyes, and I think I know why it wanted me to leave.",

        "text": " \n\nBeing a broke college kid is about as fun as you’d expect. I’d just been cut off by my parents, and I soon realized that I had to find some way to pay for my tuition. \n\nNow being the desperate idiot that I am, this led me to look for whatever job I could find. After browsing a few online ads, I came across an interesting one. “**BARTENDER WANTED FOR THE BLACK SKULL TAVERN, Pays $50 dollars an hour**. \n\nThe address was pretty much in the middle of nowhere, about 20 minutes outside of town. Something felt off about the whole thing, but that $50 an hour was pretty tempting. \n\nI figured what the hell, even if it’s a scam it’s worth an application. I ended up getting a phone call a few days later, and the guy on the other end was pretty nice. His name was Charles, the owner of the place. \n\nI asked him if I needed any sort of training. He said the job was mine, and that, “Don’t worry kid, you’ll pick it up real quick”. \n\nI was told to come down Monday night for my first shift. When I got there, the room felt dead. The place was empty, and all I could see was a wax sealed envelope on the counter. \n\nTo our newest bartender:\n\nWelcome to the Black Skull, home of the world’s most mystic drinks. You’re probably wondering why you’ve received this letter. This is a list of rules which include the responsibilities of your job, as well as some precautions to keep you safe during your employment. Please note that failure to adhere to these rules may result in severe injury, death, and other consequences which may be quite…eternal.\n\n\\#1: Your shift begins at 12pm sharp and ends at 6am. Do not attempt to exit the bar at any time during your shift. We’re still trying to wash the old guy off of the wall in the back. \n\n\\#2: Make sure the patrons are happy. Smile, make some small talk. If they ask for another round of the same drink, give it to them for free. Although they may seem human, they are not, and therefore, deserve the utmost respect. Otherwise, you might walk out of the bar without your eyes.\n\n\\#3: At 2:15 am, the vodka will run out. It doesn’t matter how much customers drink, the bottle will always be empty. You must go into the basement to get a new bottle. Once you grab a new bottle off the shelf, it’s going to burn your hand. No matter what, don't let go. If you drop it and the inhabitants behind the bar don’t get their fix, they won’t take too kindly to it. \n\n\\#4: If an older gentleman with amber eyes walks in, make him an old fashioned and refer to him as Mr. Lucious. He will ask you your name. Don’t hesitate to lie through your teeth, but no matter what do not give him your actual name. You are free to converse with him as you please, so long as you do not make direct eye contact for too long. If you see the flames within his eyes, you may begin to lose hope. \n\n\\#5: With the exception of rule 8, you should not be in the basement at any time other than between 2:15 and 2:20 am. No matter what you hear down there, ignore it. These are simply rises to try and get you to open the door. DON’T OPEN IT.\n\n\\#6: Under the bar you’ll notice your bottle of vodka as previously mentioned. Yeah, it’s not exactly vodka. Without exception, pour a shot’s worth of the stuff in each drink. Let’s just say it’s what keeps the drinks interesting for our clients. \n\n\\#7: You may have noticed the revolver under the bar as well. Make sure to keep it close at all times, as there are many situations in which you might need it. If a young woman who goes by Madison sits at the bar, don’t hesitate to shoot her. If a gentleman wearing a civil war uniform steps in, make sure you shoot him directly in the heart. In the unlikely event that the whole building goes dark, put the revolver to your head and pull the trigger. You’re pretty much screwed if this happens, and eating a bullet is a better alternative than what Mr. Lucious has in mind for you. \n\n\\#8: If the bar is empty and Mr. Lucious comes up to you, say verbatim, “What service shall I perform for thee?”. Do whatever he says, and make sure he isn’t bored. Later in the night Mr. Lucious will tell you, “Come with me”. Follow him down to the basement. When you reach the bottom of the last step, he will ask you a deep, personal question. The question varies from person to person, but it will always be personal in nature, and almost always a shameful one. \n\nYou will be overcome with an enormous sense of guilt, wanting to say the truthful answer. However you must use all of your willpower to lie. If you cannot produce an acceptable answer, you will black out and feel nothing. When you awake you will feel weightless, as if you do not have a body. It is only then that you will realize that your soul is trapped in a bottle, to be consumed by the very abominations you serve.\n\nIf however you manage to tell a convincing lie, you will awake in the booth at the corner of the bar. When you check your watch it will be 6am, and you may leave while continuing your day as normal. \n\nCongratulations on the new job,\n\nCharles \n\n“Eh, this guy’s just screwing with me”, I thought while staring at the letter. I chuckled for a second, appreciating Charles’s odd sense of humor. That was, until a customer came through the door. \n\nHe was an old man with fiery amber eyes. He took a seat at the bar while I was scared shitless, trying to remember what the hell I should do. \n\nI then thought back to the list and said in a shaky voice, “What service shall I perform for thee?”. \n\n“Pour me an old fashioned, would ya son?”, he asked with a smug grin. \n\nI had only ever served drinks to friends at parties, and even then I was mostly mixing random crap together. “Shit, shit, shit, how do I make an old fashioned?”, I thought, trying to find some way to save myself. \n\n“Pour in some whiskey, add an orange slice, a bit of sugar, and some bitters”, the old man said. I did as he said, not wanting to piss off whoever or whatever I was talking to. “You’re new here, aren’t you?”, the old man questioned me. \n\n“First customer I’ve served”, I replied. “It’s a pleasure to meet you, Mr. -” he cut me off before continuing. “Lucious, yes that’s right. It’s great to meet you too.”\n\nWe began to make small talk, yet I still couldn’t shake that coincidence with the rules. After some time he asked me a strange question. “So boy, what’s your name?”.\n\nI stood there confused. “I’m sorry?”, I asked. “What’s your name, son?”. Just then I felt a sinking feeling in my stomach. How was this still a coincidence? I told him my name was Jack, in accordance with the rules.\n\n“Oh, Danny, Danny, Danny. No one likes a liar, now do they?” My heart froze. “You’re shakin’ in your boots right now, wondering how I know your name, or why you have to follow that list of rules. Don’t worry, I don’t bite”. \n\nJust as I saw the flames in his eyes, he said, “come with me to the basement, I’ll explain everything”. I was done at this point. No matter how hard this thing was trying to act human, I knew something was very, very wrong.\n\nNo list was gonna keep me safe from this man, so I did the only thing I could think of. I took the revolver from under the table, and shot at that abomination. \n\nIn a split second the thing pretending to be a man laid limp on the floor like a ragdoll, as I ran for the exit. Just as I was about to swing through the door, the old man called out to me.\n\n“You made the wrong choice tonight, boy. Tonight I’ll let you live, but just know that no matter where you run or what you do, I will always be near. Rule breakers deserve to be punished!”. \n\nI booked it out into the parking lot and towards my car, when suddenly I heard a roar from the nearby woods. I didn’t want to find out what happened to the last guy, so I got into my car and floored it. \n\nWhen I got home I tried calling Charles, hoping against hope that he would know how to take care of Mr. Lucious. After four tries, he finally picked up. \n\n“Charles, that old man with the amber eyes, he’s… he said he’s after me”, I said through heavy breaths. “What do I do?”. \n\n“Please”, Charles said with a smug tone, “call me Lucious. I’ll be seeing you soon”.",

        "text": "If you are reading this, you are so lucky you are still alive, but don't worry, you won't be for long.\n\nWhen my mother gave birth to me, she realized I had a very strange birth mark, which spelled 7.000.000.000 .She just thought it was a very strange coincidence, but it turned out not to be, it turned out to be something way more terrifying. \n\nI first noticed the birthmark when I turned 6 years old, my mother told me it was nothing important, and I didn't complain. Short after that, my mother enrolled me in school and right after kids saw my birthmark they started calling me a weirdo. I kept complaining to my mother about kids at my school making fun of me for my birthmark, she told me to just hide it, so that's what I did. For a few years the bullying stopped, until one day I took my shirt off at gym class in 7th grade. One boy annoyed me too much one day, and I've just had enough. He told me that I would never be a normal boy and I was a fucking weirdo. I've never felt so much anger in my entire life, so I just punched him in the neck, head and ribcage. He eventually stopped moving, and I thought I just knocked him out, but then my teacher came and she called 911. They finally come and they tell us that the kid died. I felt guilty, but at the same time I was happy that he wouldn't be bullying me anymore.\n\nI went home, took my shirt off, and then I saw it. 6.999.999.999 , the number changed. I told my mother and she was terrified. Night time came, my mother and father were sleeping, I went to the kitchen and grabbed the biggest knife I could find, and then stabbed them both in the throat. They died, I looked at the number, 6.999.999.997 .It worked, I knew what I had to do to finally get rid of this fucking birthmark. For years I've been trying to get rid of this birthmark that's been bothering me for years, and I finally found a way, killing people. I first started with the homeless people that nobody would care for, and then I started entering peoples homes and killing them in their sleep, and that turned out to be the best way, in just 2 weeks I've already killed 471 people, the police are looking for me everywhere, but they will never find me since I have my house in the middle of nowhere. At one point I wanted to give up, but then I remembered why I started doing all of this, and that kept me going for all of these years. \n\nIt's been 37 years now, the number is at 1.273.971 .I only need a few more victims to get rid of this birthmark, so be careful, you might just be the next person I kill. Sleep well tonight.",

        "text": "When I was seventeen and reckless, I dated a boy who feared nothing. Together, we discovered every vice, and after school we’d slip away into a haze of smoke and wine coolers and explore each others’ bodies until dark.\n\nOne day, he told me about a secret garden where fruit grew even in the winter. Eating it, gave you a lift better than any orgasm. I’m not sure if he knew that garden belonged to a witch, but either way, he didn’t tell me, and I followed him blindly over a high brick wall.\n\nIt was just as he said. Surrounded by the bitter snow stood a small green tree, its branches bowing under the weight of peaches. When I picked one and took a bite, the world blossomed into a thousand colors. I saw every falling snowflake at once in perfect detail, and I saw how together they formed a swirling pattern, and how that shape too belonged to a greater whole: out, out, out into the spiral of the Milky Way. \n\nIt soon became our daily ritual, and we spent the better part of a month there until we’d picked nearly every piece of fruit. We should have worried, but we were young and stupid.\n\nIn all that time, it never occurred to me that someone was living in the house that adjoined the garden. The place was weather-beaten and cumbling, barely fit for rats. \n\nOf course, I should have known better. \n\nEach night, someone carefully collected the discarded peach stones, the cigarette butts and beer bottles. Someone shoveled the snow when it grew high. \n\nIt was only as he plucked the final fruit from the tree that I saw her, looking out at me from the house’s one unbroken window. The witch’s skin hung from her bones as if she were long dead, but her eyes were as bright as a child’s. When she put her hands to the window glass, I saw that her fingers were a foot long each, tapering to points at the ends like tree branches.\n\n“We need to run,” I said, but the boy was busy staring up into the face of god.\n\n“It’s so beautiful,” he said.\n\nAt the window, the witch had disappeared. Somewhere in the house, I heard the rapid beat of footsteps down crumbling stairs.\n\nI ran, sprinting to the wall. I jumped high as I could and hoisted myself up. Then, looking back I saw her approach him from behind. I called his name, and our eyes met one last time. He smiled at me dreamily. \n\nThen she stuck a long finger into the spot where his neck met his back. It pierced his windpipe and emerged below his chin. Blood gushed from the wound, dying his whole front crimson. His whole body went limp, but the light was still on in his eyes. \n\nSuddenly terrified, he gulped at the air like a fish. The witch held him up to the setting sun, hoisting him as easily as if he were built of cotton and paper.\n\nFor a moment, the old woman and I met eyes. Then she blew out a white breath, almost whistling. Something stabbed at me, like ice wrapping my heart. Then the witch smiled and took the boy by the leg, dragging him inside. I never saw him again.\n\nThe police didn’t believe in witches, and when they visited the address I gave them, they found an empty lot. I cried and raved and told them to keep looking, but most of the cops just rolled their eyes.\n\nOne younger officer took me aside though and handed me a crumpled up piece of paper.\n\n“I know you’ve seen her,” he whispered. “These other guys don’t get it. Honestly, it’s easier for them to just let her take you and pretend it never happened. But if you want to live, you can. It just won’t be easy.”\n\nI looked down at the paper in my hand and considered throwing it in my face. But then I slipped it in my pocket and walked away.\n\nAt night, I could hear a scraping at my window. A little louder each night. Sometimes, there’d be thumps on the roof, and then the air would freeze around me, so cold that I could see my breath in the moonlight. \n\nOther times, the air would fill with the smell of ripe peaches, and I’d feel the sudden urge to open the window and jump out into the darkness.\n\nAnd then one morning I woke to find five pinpick holes in the glass, so small they hadn’t even created cracks. The winter cold air blew in, as I remembered the witch’s breath, and I sensed my time was running out. \n\nI uncrumpled the paper the cop had given me. It was an address downtown, an infamous block where you had to watch your step to avoid the discarded needles. \n\nI put on my heaviest coat and walked there, only to find an empty lot.\n\n“Hello?” I called out. There were a few old men sitting against a wall eating plain slices of wheat bread. Two ignored me, but the third rose and walked over. From the dirt caked onto his face and the rank odor of his overcoat, I could tell he’d been on the street for longer than I’d been alive.\n\n“She blew you a kiss, didn’t she?” he asked. “You don’t gotta answer. I see it on you. Old Tom here knows these things. You haven’t got much time left unless you listen to me and listen careful.”\n\nI didn’t respond, but I felt the ice around my heart stabbing softly at me.\n\n“Tough curse,” said Old Tom. “Unbreakable. But it can be lived though, if living’s your goal. Is it?”\n\nI shrugged, unsure.\n\n“Do you want to live or not?” he asked, growing frustrated. “Won’t ask again. Ignore me, and she’ll come for you. You’ll wake one day to find her standing over you in bed, your heart dripping in them long fingers she got.”\n\nNow I was shaking. Because I knew he had seen her too. \n\n“I don’t want to die,” I finally said. “Tell me what I have to do.”\n\n“It’s easy and it’s hard,” said the man. “All you have to do is say the Witch’s Prayer at midnight. That hard part is that you gotta do it every day for the rest of your life. Fuck up even one word or miss midnight by a few seconds, and she’ll come for you. Fall asleep at 11:30 and sleep through the appointed time? You wake up dead. You get me?”\n\nI nodded again. \n\n“What’s the prayer?”\n\nHe raised his hands and whispered:\n\n*We who have eaten the fruit and seen the other side*\n\n*Ask mercy from the mother with the empty womb.*\n\n*For we know that broken hearts can’t hide*\n\n*The ice the lies inside our body’s tomb.*\n\nOld Tom made me say it with him after that. Once, when I missed a word, he slapped me hard across the face.\n\n“You sure you want to live?” he asked.\n\nThe next time I got the words right. Together, we said them over and over again until I knew it by heart.\n\n“Remember,” he said. “Every night from now on. Every night. You’ve made enough mistakes for a lifetime, girl. You don’t get another one.”\n\nThat night at eight, I started getting edgy and opened a bottle of my dad’s wine, but after half a glass I started feeling sleepy, so I poured it down the sink and made a pot of coffee instead. \n\nI missed the boy hard, but he was dead, and I was still here, and I wasn’t ready to join him. But I couldn't help let me mind wander to the taste of his skin, or the way he’d smile at me with a cigarette hanging out the corner of this mouth. \n\nI suddenly realized that I was intensely bored. All of the TV shows that had made me laugh before seemed mind-numbingly insipid now. \n\nFinally, I picked up one of my grandfather’s old books and started to read. It was some dense volume of Dickens I could barely comprehend, but as I kept chipping away at the meaning of the old words, I felt my mind start to loosen and comprehend, like some long-frozen creature coming back to life.\n\nAt midnight, I said the prayer, and for the first time in a while, I felt safe. I went to sleep with the book in hand.\n\nAs the days went by, everything began to change. I had become used to waking sick and hungover. Now, for the first time since I’d met the boy, I felt okay. \n\nI’d wake before my parents and walk through the dark, sleepy neighborhoods. As weeks passed, the walks became runs. My smoker’s cough soon disappeared, and my doughy body firmed up.\n\nSchool went from an impossible chore to something bearable. I pulled my D’s up to B’s and even A’s. My future plans pivoted from ‘Dead by 27 like Kurt and Janis’ to college and more. Pre-law. A family of my own.\n\nAnd then one day as I was jogging, I saw the house. It was just like I remembered, except this time, smoke was pouring out the chimney. I slowed as I approached. Everything in me screamed to run, but I couldn’t help myself. I needed to take another look. \n\nI hoisted myself up to the top of the red brick wall, and there was the tree. It was spring now, and the fruit was riper and more plentiful than I could have ever imagined. It seemed impossible that the branches wouldn’t snap under the weight of it.\n\nSitting in the shade of the tree sat the witch. She was eating something, chewing slowly as if enjoying every last bit. At first I thought it was beef jerky, but then I realized the truth. Beside her lay a corpse, its skin leathery and firm, as if it had spent all week in a smoker. As I watched, she sliced off a thin strip of thigh with her razor fingers and brought it to her lips, smelling it like fine wine before she put it to her lips.\n\nThen she noticed me for the first time, and she smiled. She beckoned to me, and then struck the tree, causing an avalanche of fruit to fall in the soft grass around her. When I stood frozen, she speared a peach on one finger and held it out like a candy apple. When I still remained, she tossed it at me, a perfect arc that I caught in two hands. \n\nFor a second, I stared at the fruit, and imagined seeing the world explode into magic just one more time. Then I watched the witch take another bite of the corpse, and my stomach turned. I dropped the fruit and ran home as fast as I could go.\n\nIn college, I met a lot of boys who wanted me, but I knew they’d never understand. I couldn’t risk going to a frat party, not even a single beer. If I missed my midnight curfew, I knew the witch would return for me.\n\nAnd so I spent my nights in my room, studying and watching the clock. And dutifully at midnight, I’d recite the prayer.\n\n*We who have eaten the fruit and seen the other side…*\n\nAs I finished one night, I thought I heard an echo of the final words, *our body’s tomb.* Sure enough, I peeked out my door to see a young man on his knees in the dorm lounge, just finishing the same prayer.\n\n“Sorry,” he said, getting up. “I thought everyone was out at the Midnight Movie Madness thing.”\n\n“Not us,” I said. “We’ve got midnight plans, don’t we. Permanently.”\n\nHe met my eye, suddenly curious.\n\n“So you’ve seen her?” he asked.\n\n“Back in high school,” I said.\n\nHis name was Nathan, and though I didn’t know it yet, he was the man destined to be the father of my child. \n\nHe had seen the witch too, though his encounter was a little different. He and a group of his friends had stolen a truck. They didn’t even notice the fruit in the back until they were back at his ranch. \n\nAll day they sat in a cornfield munching on stolen peaches and watching clouds turn into angels and whales. Then, as night fell and the fruit ran out, the witch arrived. The guys were so blissed out that they didn’t even notice her until she was on top of them, her long nails piercing one’s eyes and poking through the back of his skull.\n\nShe went through the group quickly, killing most of them while they were half in dream. Only Nathan had survived, jumping in the truck and driving away as fast as he could while his friends screamed for him to come back.\n\nAll through college we remained inseparable, running through the foothills of campus, studying together, and of course, saying our midnight prayers. \n\nI wasn’t as blissfully in love with him as with the other boy, but he was dependable in a way I’d never know, bringing me my morning coffee and dutifully running flashcards with me when I struggled in my anatomy class.\n\nAnd when I got pregnant senior year, he never once pressured me one way or the other. He let me decide. And when I made the choice to keep it, he offered up a ring. It wasn’t the way I’d wanted things to be, but I loved him, and I said yes.\n\nWe held the wedding privately on the beach, just the two of us and an officiant, a local minister who agreed to a reduced fee. Later, we sat in the dark sand watching the stars come out, and Nathan pulled out a bottle of champagne from a cooler in the trunk of his car.\n\n“Nathan,” I said. “You know we can’t. The prayer is coming up soon. Not to mention the baby.”\n\nNathan laughed.\n\n“I thought about that,” he said. “One sip won’t kill us, or the kid. And we can do it right after midnight, so we’re not taking any risk.”\n\nIn a way, he had a point. Drinking right after midnight was probably the safest way to go. I didn’t want to say no to him, not on our wedding night. \n\n“Maybe,” I said.\n\nAt midnight, we said the prayer together, and he popped the bottle open. As he did, I looked down at the waves and saw her there, watching us, the surf curling around her ankles.\n\n“Nathan,” I said as he drank straight from the bottle. “Look.”\n\nThe witch walked slowly toward us, dragging her long fingers in the sand, leaving ten narrow lines in her wake.\n\n“You can’t touch us,” he shouted, standing and taking another drink. “We said the prayer. We didn’t stutter. We got every word!”\n\nThe witch came closer, and then closer still. Twenty feet. Ten feet. I felt my icy heart beating like a hummingbird’s wings. She was so close now that I could smell her rank breath and see the red-brown stains ringing her mouth. \n\n“Please,” I said. “We did it right. We did everything right.”\n\nAnd then she walked right past us. There, in his car, was the officiant who had married us just a few hours earlier. He was dead asleep.\n\nThe witch opened the driver’s side door and then lined up the sharp fingers of one hand with his chest. Suddenly, she pushed forward, burying the hand all the way up to her wrist. When she pulled it back, she held his heart, its white crystals gleaming in the moonlight. The man looked dreamily at it, and then he was gone.\n\nI screamed and closed my eyes, but Nathan drank and drank and drank as we watched the witch drag the man through the parking lot and back out to the ocean.\n\nThe marriage that had started badly only got worse. The 12:01 drinks got more and more frequent, until one day he decided he could get started at 11:00. After all, he could say the prayer a little buzzed.\n\nAnd then one day, he mumbled as he said the final line. Instead of ‘tomb,’ the word came out more like, ‘thumb.’\n\nI tried to correct him. Maybe if he said it all over again, he’d be okay. Maybe she wouldn’t come. But he wouldn’t listen. \n\n“It’s fine,” he said. “I said it fine.”\n\nAnd then he went downstairs to drink more while I held my swollen belly and cried.\n\nThe next morning, he was gone. All that remained was a trail of blood leading from the couch to the front door, which lay open, rocking rustily on its hinges.\n\nAnd that brings us to Emma.\n\nShe came just a few weeks later, just after midnight. I still remember the contraction hitting mid-prayer, the way I struggled to say every word with perfect diction. And I did. \n\nThen Emma was there, barely even crying. I felt her heart beating in her chest and knew I hadn’t passed the curse to her. I wept at her perfect warmth.\n\nAs I kissed her for the first time, I looked out the hospital window and saw the witch there, watching jealously. I remembered hearing once that she coveted the flesh of children most of all.\n\nThe witch tapped her long sharp fingers on the glass and smiled hungrily. She did not enter, but she stayed there most of the night, waiting patiently.  \n\nSo many bleary nights would follow, times when I thought I’d never keep my eyes open. We fought off colds and flu, roseola and croup. Sometimes I didn’t sleep for 48 hours at a time. But no matter how tired I got, I was always ready at midnight. I refused to let that bitch rip my heart out in front of my daughter. Or to leave her an orphan, alone with my body in our small apartment.\n\nAnd so the years passed one midnight at a time. Emma is eight now. \n\nEmma is bright and sweet and whole. If I had known love like hers when I was younger, I never would have gone wandering. I never would have met the witch. Every day after school, she returns with armfuls of pencil sketches all for me. Usually, they are of us: a queen and a princess or a mother cat and her kitten. \n\nAt night, she snuggles up to me in our double bed, tucking her cold feet under my stomach, falling asleep as I say my prayer\n\nAnd that brings us to last week. \n\nIt wasn’t anything I did. I’ve never backslid once. Not one drink, never a late night partying with friends. But I just got sick. Maybe covid, maybe flu. I could barely walk to the bathroom. I couldn’t catch a breath.\n\nDuring the worst night, around 10:00 my body was just giving up. I was so tired I hard to sleep. And so I set an alarm for 11:45 and told Emma that if I slept though it, she needed to wake me. I told her if I couldn’t say my prayer at midnight the witch would come. \n\nShe nodded, and said okay, but I could tell that she was scared.\n\nAnd then I fell into a deep dark sleep.\n\nI woke in the morning alive but alone. I cried out for Emma, but there was no answer. Barely able to breath, I ran to the door and threw it open. She wasn’t in her room either, or on the couch. \n\nI imagined the scene as it must have played out. The witch approaching my body just after midnight and finding the sleeping child beside me. The way she must have reached into Emma’s tiny chest with her razor fingers.\n\nI fell to the floor sobbing, cursing the witch, cursing myself for even summoning her in the first place. I was ready to go now, and I called for her to come take me, take me to be with my baby.\n\n“Mom?”\n\nI looked up to see Emma holding a plate of burnt pancakes, I ran over and hugged her, my lungs burning with the effort.\n\n“What happened?” I asked. “Why didn’t you wake me up?”\n\n“You seemed so tired,” she said. “So at midnight, I just said the prayer for you. It’s not like I haven’t heard you say it a million times.”\n\nAnd I held her and sobbed and sobbed, not knowing if the curse was broken or just getting started.",

        "text": "I t all started a few years ago, It was your run of the mill boring shift at the office. I worked the night shifts, and our staff was pretty small, so there was usually only one or two other rangers working with me, but on this specific night I was alone.  I yawned and looked at the clock, it read 3:00 AM.\n\n*Only a few hours to go..*\n\nSuddenly, I heard a branch crack outside. Like the paranoid person I was, I instantly tensed up and began to slightly panic. \n\n*You’re being crazy, it’s just an animal or something.* \n\nMy paranoia returned twofold once I heard another branch breaking. I knew it was most likely nothing, but I got up and made sure the door was locked, and then I looked out the window, scanning the area for anything suspicious. I took a deep sigh of relief when the answer was affirmative. \n\nUpon sitting down, I swore I could hear the faintest footsteps coming from outside the office. So faint that they could’ve been in the back of my mind, but then they grew louder, and there was no doubt that they were real.  The footsteps seemed to be getting louder and closer by the second, and they sounded like no normal animals or humans. \n\nI tried to distract myself by playing some games on my computer, but the paranoia was becoming too much to ignore. I jumped when I heard the horrific sound of screeching nails on one of the back office windows. I got up and quickly made my way to the window, only to find a long, red scratch mark. My stomach threatened to empty itself at the sight. \n\nUsually I like being alone at the night shift, but at this moment I wished I had another co-worker with me. \n\nI heard another scratching noise, this time coming from the window closest to my desk. I ran out of the room and watched as five terrifying nails slowly scratched their way down the window, leaving the same red mark. \n\nI spent the next half hour sitting in my chair shaking and teeming with intense anxiety, hearing the scratching sound every so often. Eventually, I couldn't take it anymore, I got up and looked at the first window, it was totally and utterly covered with red scratch marks. There was absolutely no seeing out of that window.  I checked every other window, and it was the same for all of them. I sat back down and looked at the clock, it was now 4:00 AM, meaning there was only around an hour until dawn.\n\n*If I can just wait for the morning shift to  arrive, I should be okay.*\n\nI knew I needed to make myself as comfortable as possible in such a situation. I went to each window and closed the curtains, I then settled down in my chair and tried to distract myself with some random news articles,\n\n(really the only entertainment i could access on the work computers)\n\nI shot up in my seat when I heard a horrific scream coming not too far from the office. I got out of my seat and made sure I had my firearm handy. I walked over to the front and  tried to look out the window, examining the surrounding areas. The scream had sounded like someone was in trouble or deeply fearful.\n\nI opened the door and embraced the chilly air before venturing into the outside world. I locked the door behind me and   clicked on my flashlight and slowly scanned the surrounding area, finding nothing.\n\n“Is anyone out here?” I called out.\n\nI was met with the same horrific scream as my response, this time sounding much closer.  The scream caused me to jump, and my nerves were filled with paranoia. \n\n“A-are you okay?” I called out shakily.\n\n“*help.”*  I heard an uncanny voice shriek, sending me into a panicked daze. \n\nI continued to scan the area with my flashlight, desperately hoping to see what was making these terrifying screams. \n\nThe hairs on my neck stood up when I felt the gut-wrenching sensation of being breathed upon. I turned around and aimed my flashlight directly behind me, illuminating the cruel imitation of a woman staring right at me. After the initial shock subsided, I booked it back to the rangers office. I pulled out my set of keys and tried to find the one that would unlock the door, but it wasn’t there.\n\nI turned around and was met with the scene of the skinwalker tauntingly dangling the key I needed in front of me.  Adrenaline surged through my veins, I ran to the side of the office and began to relentlessly pound on the glass window, but it just wouldn’t break.  I looked behind me once more and saw the Skinwalker was now a dozen paces closer. I involuntarily screamed from pure fear and booked it into the forest, not caring where I was going, only caring about putting as much distance between me and this horrific creature as possible. \n\nWhile running, I pulled out my cell phone and crashed when I saw it had no service. I then pulled out my radio and tried to call for backup, but my only response was static.  After running for a while, my body gave out from exhaustion. As I lay on the forest ground, pushing as many deep lungfuls of oxygen I could into my lungs, I scanned the area, looking for any sign of the skinwalker. Once I locked eyes with the two eyes staring at me from behind a tree, adrenaline took over and I was suddenly able to run again. \n\nI knew just how long the forest stretched, it would take me a long time to reach the end, and even when I did, it wasn’t like anyone would be there waiting to help me.\n\n“*Please help me.”* The creature shrieked. \n\nSomething about its voice was incredibly distressing and inhuman. I picked up my pace twofold, not caring about how scratched up I would be from all the branches and whatnot I was running into at full speed. \n\nI tripped over a branch and screamed in pain as my face impacted the ground. I scurried onto my feet and noticed my flashlight was no longer on. I couldn’t see anything. I could only hear the sound of the footsteps getting closer and closer. I felt the flashlight and realized that one of the batteries had fallen out during my fall. I bent down and panickedly felt the ground near me, desperately hoping to come across the battery I needed for my most important sense: Sight. \n\nI decided to cut my losses and leave the flashlight when the footsteps had become too close to ignore. I was now briskly walking through the forest instead of running, my arms out in front of me to feel what was ahead of me.  After a long time of venturing in the forest, I had finally made it out. I looked at the dimly moonlit river beneath me, feeling the tiniest bit safer. The tiny sense of safety I felt was ripped away from me once I heard the footsteps. I climbed down and began to run on the river’s beach. My body kept threatening to collapse from exhaustion, but I wouldn't let it.  I looked behind me while I ran and could now see the skinwalker in greater detail, it had morphed from the uncanny woman into a four legged beast, charging at me on all fours. \n\nI searched through my mind, trying to gather up all of the information I knew about skinwalkers. I had heard of the legends of a skinwalker roaming this park, but I always thought it was just a nonsense fairytale.  I remembered that a way to kill a skinwalker was to state its true identity to it. I now had an idea, but it fell very short; I had no clue what this creature's true identity was and it was pretty clear I had no way of finding it in the near future.  I looked up and felt a small glimpse of hope when I saw the light of the sun slowly creeping up above the mountains. \n\nI looked behind me and suddenly noticed that I couldn't see the creature following me anymore.  I took a sigh of relief and slowed down my pace slightly, but I didn't dare stop running. I knew that the closest rangers office was only an hour's walk away. I ran for a while longer, and then slowed to a brisk walk due to the exhaustion i had put my body through. \n\nAfter a long and treacherous walk, I could see the other rangers office in my sight, and the sun had now fully risen. I made it to the rangers office and attempted to catch my breath while banging on the door. I heard footsteps shuffle and come my way, and then the door opened, revealing another park ranger looking concerned. \n\n“Jeez, are you alright?” He asked.\n\n“There’s… something… in… the… woods…”  I said between ragged breaths. \n\n“I know.” The ranger calmly responded.\n\n“W-what?” I asked shakily.\n\n“I said…” The ranger started.\n\nI watched in complete horror as the ranger slowly morphed into the creature I was familiar with. Before he fully morphed, I took one last look at his badge, his name read “Apache Sioux”.\n\n“I know.” The creature finished, its voice now heavily distorted. \n\nI instantly bolted to the river behind me, and the creature followed. I didn’t know if I could run much longer without passing out.  \n\nSuddenly, I realized that the name on his badge would be a good guess to his true identity.  I decided to take the risk. I stopped in my tracks and turned around. \n\n“Apache Sioux” The creature suddenly seemed startled, and it began to retreat.\n\n“APACHE SIOUX!” I screamed even louder, causing the creature to run away.\n\nI began to roar out in maniacal laughter; I had won!  Or so I thought..  Out of  nowhere, I heard the deafening sound of what sounded like dozens of thousands of  gut-wrenching screams at once. I felt my ears as they throbbed in pain.  I heard the sound of trees rustling, and I turned to see the most panic-inducing scene of hundreds of skinwalkers and wendigos running out of all directions of the forest, charging at me. \n\nI screamed and ran into the rangers office, closing and locking the door behind me. I sat down in the chair and began to hyperventilate when  the creatures started relentlessly banging on all sides of the office, it seemed like no end was near except the end of my life. \n\n“Shit Shit Shit!” I screamed in a frustrated and fearful tone.\n\nThe skinwalkers and wendigos began to tear down pieces of the building one by one, causing me to slowly retreat into the center of the room, until the building was almost entirely destroyed. \n\nThe next few minutes were a horror filled daze, the creatures were slowly removing the last pieces of building, as if to taunt me. I swear I even heard a few of them snicker.  I didn’t know much about these legendary creatures, so I figured it would be a good idea to commit the most destructive act I could think of: A fire. \n\nAs a park ranger, I had some decent experience of knowing how to make a fire with nothing except a  rock and steel. I began to search through what was left of the office, and a pocket knife, oh so tantalizing, caught my eye. I ran for the pocket knife, but the creatures must have known what I was attempting, so they jumped off and attacked me. \n\nIt was pure agony and I literally felt like I had been transported to hell. Each of the creatures mercilessly tortured me, but my brain blocked out the pain the best it could and focused on the one thing that mattered in that moment: creating a fire.  I grabbed the pocket knife, flipped it open and rubbed a rock against it. I saw sparks forming, and my eyes widened with hope. I tried and tried again, until eventually one of the sparks caught the wood and fire began to slowly but surely envelope the building. The creatures all shrieked and slowly retreated from the growing flame, and so did i.\n\nSome of the creatures had already been caught in the fire and were too far gone already, only a handful survived and they all decided to run into the forest. \n\nI pressed my radio and explained that a fire had erupted and that it was spreading fast. I ran down to the river, thinking it would give me the best chance of protection from this fire. I jumped into the river and struggled immensely as the current tried to pull me into its wrath, but I swam and swam until I was on the other side. I collapsed on the ground and took in deep lungfuls of oxygen, feeling victorious but also defeated at the same time. \n\nI looked back and saw that my radio was floating down the heavy  current, I cursed at myself and got up. I decided to cut my losses and move on. I needed to find the nearest ranger office to alert them of the fire before it got too bad.\n\nI walked into the forest and was instantly enveloped with paranoia. I felt like I was being watched with a million taunting eyes, waiting for me with pure rage after what I had just done. I stopped in my tracks and looked around, examining every single piece of every tree, trying to ease my paranoia.\n\nJust as I was about to let my guard down, I saw two unblinking and menacing eyes staring directly at me from behind a tree. At first, I froze in complete fear and shock, but just as soon after I was running for my life once again, giving me a strong sense of unpleasant deja vu. \n\nI didn't know much about this part of the park, but I assumed this forest didnt go on for that long. After hours of walking, I had proven my assumption incorrect, this forest seemed to  be going on forever, and I could smell the nasty smell of smoke growing more pungent.   \n\nFinally, I noticed the trees becoming less close to each other, and before I knew it I was out of the forest.  I made it to the office and explained the fire situation to the officers there, but not bothering to explain the skinwalker situation to them; I knew they would just think it was insane nonsense. Anyways, I eventually made it home safely, but I quit my job very shortly after that, and I still have nightmares about those creatures to this day..",

        "text": " LOG 1: May 5, 2018\n\n Condition: Good\n\n\n Hello there. I am Greg Robinson. A death row inmate from [Redacted]. Reasons for me being in death row? I was part of a gang robbery but I was the only one charged for shooting a cop. The rest of them got at least 10 - 20 years. I should say lucky them. Because when you are death row you belong to the government. They took me from my cell, gave me these instructions, prepared me, trained me. Sayed if I lived through this I would get off death row and serve the same prison time with my friends of 10 years. I accepted. I mean who wouldn't. They put me on a boat somewhere in the middle of the ocean where I would go in this weird chamber that they said the scientists came up with. They said I'll be in there for a while but I'll have some food and a couple of buckets to do \"my business\". I'm scared though. I really don't like the ocean. Wish me luck. \n\n\n LOG 2: May 6, 2018\n\n Condition: Good\n\n\n Hello again. I guess they took you in the chamber to huh? I guess to record my findings or whatever I encounter or feel. Inside the chamber is nice. Looks like one of those big propane tanks except suited for a bed and my necessities. Soon as i went in yesterday I immediately felt the tank dropping into the ocean. When that happened the tank moved real roughly as it lost balanced and it scared the shit out of me. Most of what I did yesterday was slept to try to encourage myself. I also have a clock in here and a calender to record the date and time. Something weird about it though is that it feels cozy in here. Today when I got up I looked outside the circle window I have to look through and saw the fish life swimming about. I even saw a shark! I then ate them MRI meals that they give soldiers on base. Spaghetti I really liked. Welp I'm going to bed, see you tomorrow. \n\n\n LOG 3: May 7, 2018\n\n Condition: Good\n\n \n\n Today I got up and marked down the date. This will be my second day in the endless ocean. The fish and sea life are going about. I can feel like they really know how to adapt to their environment. No matter what changes may come to them. I even saw a school of fish swimming about my chamber. I had a thing of noodles. Well I'll guess I'll get some sleep and see where the journey takes us tomorrow. \n\n\n LOG 4: May 8, 2018\n\n Condition: Good\n\n\n Today marks the 3rd day in the ocean. I can still see the hordes of life outside. I want to be able to swim with them. Maybe when I get out of prison? Most of what I did today was doing the exercises that the scientists made me do beforehand. I think this is actually helping my body get stronger. I'll make this a routine while I am in here. I miss my friends though, they were like brothers to me. \n\n\n LOG 5: May 9, 2018\n\n Condition: Medium\n\n\n Today marks the 4th day I am in here. There is only darkness outside now. While I was asleep I must've went into the further depths. I wonder how much cord they have up there to keep making me get lower? I exercised like I planned today. I miss seeing the other life outside. The darkness now makes me feel empty. Didn't even made me want to eat. I'm going to bed. \n\n\n LOG 6: May 10, 2018\n\n Condition: Medium\n\n\n Today marks the 5th and final day of my descent into hell. I still feel the same as yesterday though. My head hurts. Didn't even feel like exercising today. I hope they pull me out quick. I'm starting to get hot. I'm going to lay back down. \n\n\n LOG 7: May 11, 2018\n\n Condition: Bad\n\n \n\n What the hell! Shouldn't they have raised me up already! Damn! Damn! I punched the container and felt like I broke my hand. Shit! Wasn't supposed to turn out this way! Then something inside my head made me realize a terrifying thought. What if the wire broke amd I'm just floating down here? I'm stressing myself out too much. Maybe I should just rest my head. \n\n\n LOG 7: May 12, 2018\n\n Condition: Bad\n\n\n Today marks the 7th day. I want out. I don't care if they bring me back to death row. I want someone to rescue me and get me the hell out. I spent most hours crying and shaking. Today is also when I finally ran out of rations. If they won't let me out I'm gonna starve to death! Maybe… it's what I deserve anyway. I feel bad now that I've killed that cop. Leaving his wife with no husband and child with no father. I didn't see it back then cause I was selfish. If you are up there I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm so so sorry. \n\n\n LOG 8: May 13, 2018\n\n Condition: Bad\n\n\n Today is the 8th day. I thought that I felt something big brush against the container! I'm scared. I don't want to get swallowed up by some big creature! Please please help me. Mom, momma, I want you by my side right now. \n\n\n LOG 9: May 14, 2018\n\n Condition: Bad\n\n\n Today is the 9th day. I think I am in hell. Drifting in the black depths of loneliness. I don't think I can handle it anymore. I'm going to finish myself. Wait, do you hear them? The voices. They are telling me there is a way out! I just have to follow some instructions! Oh god has answered my prayers! If this works I guess you'll be lonely too huh? Don't worry. Maybe we will see each other again? I hope so, see you friend. Goodbye.\n\n\n LOG 10: May 15, 2018\n\n Condition:???\n\n\n *****************************************\n\n Hello, this is Scientists Martin Lions. I am a researcher and I work mostly with oceanography. A week ago me and a group of scientists selected 5 death row inmates that will suit the needs for our experiments. Mr. Robinson was one of them with the promise to remove the death row from there sentences. \n\n\n Anyway Robinson and the other 4 were dispatched into different areas and different oceans. Mr. Robinson was dropped off into the Atlantic. The goal of this experiment was to see how the human mental state can handle going down the deep depths of the ocean. \n\n\n The experiment was only supposed to last 5 days but when we were going to pull all of them out our supervisors told us to leave them down there. We protested but they refused. We then compromised to 5 more days. \n\n\n Once those days were up we immediately pulled them up. Something was wrong though. Only 2 of the 5 subjects were still in their containers. Inside the other tanks what we saw were scribbled signs that we didn't understand painted with blood. On the other sides of the tanks were more blood painted messages. \"The voices tell us the way, they tell us the message.\" \n\n\n To the families of the subjects that were missing I'm sorry. We reviewed the hidden cameras and saw them cutting their hands before the cameras went out. All we saw were static. Then the cameras went back on and they weren't there. This is a tragedy to science. I just heard Mr. Robinson's audio and notes. I just feel sadness for what we made them go through. \n\n\n Me and a couple of scientists are going to go through the same experiment. Hopefully we can find out the cause of the 3 inmates disappearances. I want their families to know where they are. I am scared. Wish me luck. \n\n\n [Goodbye](https://www.reddit.com/r/lingeringshadows/comments/10ugx6c/deep_dive_experiment_logs/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) \n\n\n  ",

Thomas, a hardened yet kind veteran cop, got off the train followed by a short and energetic woman he's been working with for the past year, Jane, his assistant in training. \n\nThe city, once a thriving port town, now appeared to be abandoned, with empty and decaying buildings lining the streets. The few locals they encountered seemed to be avoiding them, quickly ducking into doorways or crossing to the other side of the street when they saw the newcomers approaching. As Inspector Thomas and his assistant, Jane, made their way down the deserted streets of Innsmouth, they couldn't shake the feeling of being watched. The sun was setting, bathing the decrepit buildings in a dark orange hue, casting long shadows that seemed to follow their every step. The air was chilly and the wind carried with it a sense of foreboding, as if warning them to turn back.\n\nA black cat suddenly darted past them, startling the two, Jane letting out a surprised yelp. They exchanged a nervous glance before continuing on, their dim street lights illuminating their path. The buildings they passed by looked abandoned, with curtains drawn and windows boarded up. The silence was deafening, broken only by the sound of their footsteps echoing against the pavement.\n\nAs they approached an old motel, the tension in the air only seemed to increase. The sign creaked in the wind, the letters \"Innsmouth Motel\" barely legible. The two detectives pushed open the door to the dingy lobby of the long-forgotten establishment. The air was musty and the furniture was covered in a thick layer of dust. They made their way to the front desk, the floorboards creaking with every step, the feeling of being watched growing stronger with each passing moment.\n\nAs the two of them approached the front desk, they were greeted by an elderly man with a wrinkled face and piercing eyes. He looked up at them with a scowl, as if their presence was an annoyance to him. When they introduced themselves and explained their purpose for being there, the man's demeanor only grew colder.\n\n\"Newcomers are not treated too kindly here,\" he said in a raspy voice. \"You would do well to turn back while you still can.\"\n\nJane, who was known for her feisty spirit, replied rather defensively. \"It's our job to investigate the strange occurrences in this town. We're not going anywhere until we get to the bottom of this.\" Thomas however remained wary. \n\nAs they made their way to their room on the 1st floor of the Motel, the old man called out after them, warning them to keep the windows closed at all times and to ignore anyone who may try to talk to them from outside. The detectives exchanged a worried glance, but they knew they had to see this investigation through to the end, and that the man was likely just trying to scare them. As they walked into the room, the sound of the wind howling outside, and the feeling of being watched has dissipated.\n\nThe small motel room was just as neglected as the rest of the building. The two single beds were positioned against opposite walls, covered in thin, threadbare blankets. The heavy black curtains covering the windows were so thick that no light could penetrate, giving the room a suffocating atmosphere.\n\nAs Thomas flicked on the light switch, the bulb flickered, casting a dim and eerie glow across the room. Shadows danced along the walls, making it seem as though something was moving in the corner of the detectives' eyes.\n\nThe furniture was old and worn, with chipped paint and deep scratches marring the surface. There was a small table and two chairs sat in the center of the room, and a small bathroom was tucked away in the corner.  \n\nDespite the unsettling atmosphere, the detectives had no other choice but to settle in and try to get some sleep. But as they lay in their beds, they couldn't shake the feeling that they were being watched. The creaks of the old building and the strange noises coming from outside only added to the unsettling feeling, making it a long and restless night for the two detectives. As they were both on the cusp of falling asleep, they heard rhythmic chanting far away in the distance outside their window, but due to the exhaustion the two felt after traveling so far into the middle of nowhere they dismissed it as some explainable occurrence and both nodded off, falling beyond the wall of sleep…",

After all, it would take a special kind of mental state to ignore the overgrown parking lot and darkened sign. *Maybe I should have flipped on the old thing*, at least it would have said “No Vacancy.” Then again, given this guy's state of desperation, it probably wouldn’t have mattered.  \n\n“We’re closed. Permanently.” I said, adding to the finality of my words by crossing my arms.\n\n“Listen, lady, I saw a light on. I’ll pay cash.” He didn’t meet my eyes, constantly glancing around him, cradling a black duffel bag like it was a newborn baby. His appearance was nondescript; age neither old nor young.  Perhaps the leather jacket had been a bit flashy at one point, but it had seen better days. He smelled strongly of the river and boat fuel, his accent was Canadian. *A clandestine border crossing, clearly.*  Intriguing circumstances, however, did not change the fact that there hadn’t been housekeeping around here in at least a decade.\n\n“Where’s your car?” I asked innocently. I could feel the man’s anxiety mounting. With a trembling hand he reached into his pocket and threw down a wad of American money, each a hundred-dollar bill.  \n\n“Just take my money. I’ll sleep on the floor.”\n\nJust as I opened my mouth to refuse him again, a leathered hand snatched up the cash.\n\n“Martina!” I gave my manager a dirty look. She fixed our guest with a wide grin of yellow teeth and pulled open the drawer of keys. I nudged her aggressively, but she ignored me.\n\n“I’ll get you a key, doll.” She purred, producing a key with a miniature foam buoy attached to it. “Room number two. You can’t miss it.  Numbers only go up to five anyway.” She laughed her dry, three-pack-a-day laugh.\n\n“Wait a second, hold on.” I grabbed the key out of my manager’s hands.  “Martina, can I talk to you privately?”\n\n“Lady, I–”\n\n“Just wait. We’ll be back in a minute.”\n\nI pulled Martina into the office behind the reception desk and closed the door behind us. Martina was laughing again. \n\n“What’s your problem, kid? Did you see the cash this guy is handing over?”\n\n“I did. But this is not a functioning motel!”\n\n“Even after your uncle closed this place down, he would make exceptions. People in need, you know.” \n\nI sighed. Martina had been around Calnon’s Cottages and Motel since my grandfather built the motel in the 1960s. A five-foot-tall woman with a salt and pepper bob, and a penchant for cat sweaters who largely resembled a raisin after decades of tanning and smoking, she had almost single handedly managed the property after the old man died. I was hugely grateful for her and while I realized that I had only shown up to run the place a week ago, I didn’t want any trouble from the cops. I can’t help it. Uncle Jim was the business mind, but my dad was a lawyer. I inherited his deep sense of risk aversion. Martina patted me on the arm. She wasn’t an affectionate woman, but she did always have a soft spot for me.\n\n“Listen, kid. I know. Your dad was always looking over his shoulder too. Nothing wrong with being cautious. But we have bills to pay here. I know Denny took care of you, but that’s not going to last forever.”\n\n“Once I get the cottages ready for online rental, we won’t need to worry about that! We don’t need to have some drifter clearly involved in something illegal sleeping in the motel!”\n\nMartina frowned and pulled back the old blinds. It was a clear night, the snow had finally started to thin tentatively.  Soon it would be spring, then the tourists would arrive in summer. We didn’t have much time to finish renovating.\n\n“We have taxes to pay, you know.” Martina said slowly, voice barely above a whisper.\n\n“Dad’s CPA said we’re fine there.”\n\n“Lots of taxes these days.”\n\n“Well, that’s New York State for you.”\n\n“Uncle Jim never told you about the taxes?”\n\n“Martina, I assure you. We’re perfectly fine with taxes.” \n\nShe turned towards me, yellowed black eyes wide, and crossed herself the Greek way. I had never known Martina to be a particularly religious or superstitious woman, and yet suddenly her face was full of dread. Or perhaps it was just the way the shadows filtered through the blinds.\n\n“Nora, please, let me handle this.” \n\nI nodded and opened the door.  I had to trust her. Martina was back to smiling.  She brushed past me and placed the key into the hand of our guest.\n\n“I don’t want any trouble.” I said, trying my best authoritative tone.\n\n“I’ll be gone before you know it, sweetheart. Just need a place to rest my head for the night.” The guy looked elated. It took all my willpower not to roll my eyes.\n\n“First door to your left.” Martina gestured with an enthusiastic nod. The man was out the door without a second glance.  I turned to Martina who was already counting the cash.\n\n“So, what now? Shouldn’t we be keeping tabs on him?”\n\nMartina paused her count, and I could detect a small tremor in her hand. She shuddered and went back to her task.\n\n“With all this cash, you might even be able to get that pool back up and running in time for the summer.”\n\n“That would be nice, but we’d have to get lifeguards.  And the liabil–”\n\nMartina interrupted me with a croaking belly laugh. \n\n“Denny’s kid, you always have been, doll.  How’s this? You go back to your cottage and get some rest. I’ll sleep in the office. He won’t dare try anything when old Martina is around!”\n\n“I’m staying with you.”\n\n“Nonsense.”\n\n“Humor me, please?”\n\nMartina grumbled some form of assent and placed the cash in an envelope. I followed her into the old office. She locked the door behind us, including the deadbolt and the door chain. She pointed to the latter with a gnarled finger.\n\n“That stays locked, hear me? We don’t go out until morning.”\n\nHer change in tone was a bit jarring. In fact, Martina had been all over the place that day. One moment her cheerful, snarky self, the next brooding and circumspect. *At least this office has an attached bathroom.*\n\n“If we need something, that’s what that thing is for.” She gestured to rotary dial phone on top of the desk.\n\nDespite everything in the office having been purchased in the late 70s, Martina kept the place in clean, functioning order. Though we hadn’t had a real business on the property in years, my uncle had paid her handsomely to maintain things. The motel itself only had a handful of simple rooms, but there were fifteen cottages scattered across the rest of the property. The cottages predated the motel by about fifty years, my great-grandparents had built those themselves back in the heyday, when hordes of vacationers from downstate traveled up to the Thousand Islands to summer on the Saint Lawrence River.\n\nI have big plans for those cottages, perched so close to that watery vein that provides our area with its lifeblood. Who wouldn’t want to spend a few days in those adorable bungalows, once I get a chance to bring them up to date? It was a nice dream to keep me occupied, at least. Martina was generally supportive of my plans and tolerated the piles of books with endless arrays of paint and fabric swatches cluttering her desk. \n\nI had to keep myself busy, now that my dad’s estate was settled. After the accident, I hadn’t wanted to move back up to the North Country. Hadn’t wanted to look at that beautiful river that took the lives of my father and uncle. *Freak boating accident.* Even thinking about it made my stomach churn, my cheeks flush. But it was Mom who finally pushed me and convinced me it would be good to make peace with the Islands. \n\nAnyway, I’m still a mess. And I still haven’t gotten around to explaining why I’m writing this here. That will come soon enough.\n\n“I suppose we probably shouldn’t have been chatting back here with the light on in the first place.”\n\nMartina sat very still, staring off far away from me, eyes unreadable.\n\n“Don’t sweat it, kid. He would have found his way to us anyway.”\n\n“What does that mean?”\n\nShe didn’t answer.\n\nI peeked out the window and saw that the light was on in Room 2. My own cottage, the closest to the motel, was only a few steps away. While they all were in varying states of dilapidation, mine was the only one really in habitable condition. My uncle had kept it up after closing the business as a place to stay when he came over to fish. He had also maintained the dock, arguably the oldest thing on the property. *That’s probably why this guy found us in the first place*. I had half a mind to go out there and see if he had tied up any boat there, but then remembered Martina’s insistence that we remain in the office. Perhaps she was frightened by our visitor after all.\n\n“Maybe we should get the gun out of the safe?” I whispered.\n\nMartina shook her head.  Suddenly her eyes went wide.\n\n“Have you washed today?” She asked frantically.\n\n“What? I uhhh took a shower in the morning.”\n\n“No, no, no, no!” She grabbed my arm with more force than I imagined she could muster and pulled me into the bathroom, turning on the faucet. With two hands she brought water to her face three times. She jabbed me with a bony elbow.\n\n“Wash!” Her voice was low, almost a growl. I copied her, following her gestures and washing my face three times. When I was done, her shoulders sagged with relief.\n\n“Good. Now it will begin.”\n\n“Martina, what’s come over you?”\n\nShe took her seat and closed her eyes.\n\n“Nothing to worry about,” she muttered. “Just stay inside.”\n\n*Maybe she’s losing it.* The thought that Martina, so sharp for so long, could possibly be on the verge of senility was almost impossible to comprehend. *More likely just tired of dealing with my crap*. I decided to stop bothering her and returned to the window. I was disappointed to see that thick clouds had rolled in, obscuring the moon and stars. *Pity*. The clouds brought with them a different sensation, a feeling of great heaviness. *Didn’t realize a storm was in the forecast for today…* The more I stared at the clouds, the more they seemed…odd…to me. They churned with ferocity, but not a blade of grass stirred.  The river was peaceful and calm.  But the sky…the sky was increasingly a nauseous green.  The silence was maddening, unnatural, as though deliberately muted.\n\nThe lights began to flicker in Room 2, at first slowly then steadily increasing to a constant frenetic pace.  The heaviness of the air pressed down around my head and I began to gasp. Bile formed at my throat as though my insides clamored to expel themselves.  A hand clamped hard at my shoulder; Martina pulled me down beside her with a frenzied cry, her hands moving to cover my mouth, my eyes, my ears, as though she didn’t quite know what to shield me from.\n\nAnd then the sky erupted. \n\nI knew this despite being huddled on the floor, face pressed against Martina’s tobacco scented sweatshirt, I could feel a great fissure in the groaning atmosphere, that smell of ozone that always accompanies lightning, yet the only light was the flickering in Room 2.  An inescapable sound rattled our bodies, initially reminding me of a train, but then, as the sound broke against us like a wave, my ears could distinguish voices, hundreds and hundreds of voices, all far away and yet near, deep, melancholy voices moaning in a language outside of time, borne away together by a single, terrible force.\n\nAmidst this cacophony, I could clearly hear the man in Room 2. He had begun to scream, pleading, begging, and then a terrible scraping, snapping sound that I could only assume was the breaking of bones and sinew. The man’s howling reached the same pitch as the vortex consuming him, a crescendo of agony. I felt as though I was slipping, being pulled away, I tried to cling to Martina, but my arms no longer moved or obeyed me. My ears were bleeding, the warm rivulets racing down my neck almost comforting in the chaos around us. Slipping, slipping, sinking, falling into the void.\n\nI awoke on the floor of the office, my cheek covered by the astringent cleaner Martina had recently applied to the linoleum. I leapt up, heart racing. It was daytime. The sun was sweet and gentle, the office undisturbed. And Martina was nowhere to be found. The only evidence of the night’s events was the congealed blood around my ears.\n\nI raced out to the reception area, but she wasn’t there either. Everything was perfectly in its place. With dread I gazed out at the door to Room 2. Though fear tugged at my stomach, I knew I needed to enter. I stepped outside, finding courage in the warmth of the sunlight and braced by the fresh, cold air. I knocked on the door, but there was no answer. My heart sank as I dug my master key set out of my pocket and braced myself for what I would find inside.\n\nThe room seemed entirely normal: musty smell, ancient cathode ray tube television, burgundy bedding completely untouched. Even the worn mauve carpet looked immaculate. The only sign that someone had been inside was the man’s precious duffel bag abandoned in the middle of the floor. From my brief moments observing him last night, I didn’t think that the man would have parted with his bag willingly. There was no sign of him in the bathroom either, save for the torn toilet seat sanitary seal on the floor. \n\nThat left the bathtub as the only remaining area I hadn’t inspected. The shower curtain was just as dated as everything else, a sad shade of dusty pink likely installed in the first years of the Reagan administration. I pulled back the shower curtain and immediately began dry heaving, my empty stomach contracting uncontrollably. Carefully placed around the edge of the tub were ten fingernails, forcibly removed, each leaving a thin rivulet of blood down the side of the tub. The room began to spin around me and I caught myself on the towel bar. \n\nFrom the other room I heard a zipping and an excited cry. I staggered out of the bathroom to find Martina removing piles of cash from the duffel bag, grinning with a cigarette between her teeth, looking as though she had had the most restful of nights cozy in her bed.\n\n“Martina!” I gasped.\n\n“Something must have spooked that guy in the middle of the night. Went up and left without all this cash.”\n\n“Martina!”\n\n“What? God, Nora, you look like you’ve seen a ghost!”\n\n“Martina, what the fuck!” I gestured feebly to the bathtub.\n\n“What, did he not flush the toilet?”\n\n“Stop.  Just STOP.  Enough with this bullshit!  Look at the fucking bathtub.”\n\nShe reluctantly removed herself from the money, put the unlit cigarette in her pocket and made her way to the macabre display I had discovered. For a moment, her face turned a shade of sickly white, but only for a moment. She immediately regained her composure. \n\n“This is what we’re going to do. I’m going to clean up this mess. You are going to take a nice walk and go back to your cottage. Get some sleep. No one is going to miss this guy. Remember that. This isn’t the first time this is happened, nor will it be the last. Far from it.”\n\nI opened my mouth to question, protest, scream, but she silenced me with an impatient gesture.\n\n“I know. I know you have questions. I’m not sure I have all the answers. But you know old Martina has been around. I’ve seen some things. And I promise I’ll try to explain, as best as I can. But I need time. It isn’t easy. Can you give me that?”\n\nI nodded. She gave me a low chuckle and tossed me her pack of smokes.\n\n“Trust me. You’ll be needing these.” I smiled weakly. \n\nShe was right, of course. Walking outside by the light of day, I began to feel more at ease. The river was shimmering, the gentle lapping was something natural and familiar. Even the lonely boat tied up to the deck, belonging to the man who had vanished in the terror of the night, couldn’t jar me from my determination to feel tranquil. \n\nIn those moments of deliberate calm, I remembered this online forum. I’m writing here hoping this can serve as a warning. We’re not open. You can’t come stay here. Please, don’t bother looking for us. We absolutely do not have a website. \n\nBut let’s be real, I need to say something. I need the catharsis. It’s pathetic, I know. I still want to restore the cottages to their former glory. They’re really beautiful, I promise. I just have to figure out how to make things safe. Not really something that can be accomplished by looking at paint swatches, I guess. \n\nAfter about a half an hour walking around, staring at the river, I made my way back to my cottage. I stepped on to the small screened in porch with my uncle’s Adirondack chairs facing the water, admiring the pretty gable trim. Outside the front door, I noticed something on top of the ‘Welcome to the River’ mat. It was a yellowed spiral bound notebook. I picked it up. On the faded green cover was one word written in large caps by a blue ballpoint pen.\n\n“TAXES”",

        "text": "My name is Sarah and I am writing this story to share my experience with others who are considering renting a cabin in the woods. My husband, Rick, and I thought it would be great to rent a cabin for a weekend getaway. We found a beautiful cabin in the woods that was surrounded by trees and wildlife. It was exactly what we were looking for.\n\nWe arrived at the cabin on a Friday evening, eager to start our relaxing weekend. The cabin was beautiful and looked just like the pictures online. But as soon as we walked in, we felt a strange energy. The air was cold and felt heavy like it was trying to suffocate us. Rick told me to ignore it and said it was just our imaginations, but I knew something was wrong.\n\nThat night, we went to bed early, hoping to get a good night's sleep. But as soon as we turned off the lights, strange things started happening. We heard whispers, footsteps, and doors opening and closing. I was so scared that I couldn't move from my spot in the bed. Rick tried to calm me down and reassure me everything was okay, but I could tell he was scared too.\n\nThe next morning, we woke up to find that our belongings had been moved. Rick's shoes were in the fireplace, and my purse was wedged into one of the floorboards in the bathroom. We hadn't seen anyone or anything but it did feel like we were being watched.\n\nWe didn't know what to do and this was just too weird so, decided to leave the cabin and find a hotel to stay in.\n\nAs we were packing our bags, we heard a woman's voice say, \"Don't leave, I need your help.\" We were both scared stiff and didn't want to move or even make a sound. But the voice continued to speak, asking us to stay and help. I thought her voice was strangely familiar but Rick said he didn't think so.\n\nShe told us she needed our help to solve a mystery that was keeping her trapped in the cabin.\n\n\"I'm sorry I can't show you my face,\" she began. \"It's against the rules, and if I break them, I'll never be able to come back home again. I have been stuck here for many years, unable to escape. I am cursed, and no one but you can break it!\"\n\nShe told us there was a secret passageway that led to a hidden area beneath the cabin. She wanted us to go down into it and find an old trunk. Inside the trunk, we would find notes from an old journal that contained the answers we needed. If we opened the journal, we would learn how to release her from the curse.\n\nSo, as scared and confused as we were, something about her just seemed trust worthy and we stayed and tried to help the ghost solve her mystery.\n\nWe started by looking for the secret passage. She said it was hidden under the floorboards of the bathroom. As soon as we pried out the boards and lifted up the floor, we found a trap door.\n\nWe pulled it open and climbed down into pitch black. When we got to the bottom Rick pulled out his lighter and held it in the air so we could see.\n\nIt was a cavern-like space that must have been at least 20 feet long and 10 feet high. It reminded me of a prison cell, with bars hanging over our heads. It was freezing and dark, but we moved slowly through the tunnel to the end where we found a door, unlocked, so we entered.\n\nThe walls were covered in graffiti, which was oddly reassuring as it ment that someone had been there before us. The floor was covered with blood and bones. Blood dripped from the ceiling and ran along the walls. We followed the trail of blood until we reached a wooden chest.\n\nAs I opened the lid, I saw that it was full of old letters. As soon as I read them, my heart sank, I recognised my mothers handwriting.\n\nThey weren't letters, they were notes—notes written by my mother as she learned about magic.\n\nThe last note said, \"When your soul is hers, you will understand these words: 'Lightning strikes twice but fire burns thrice.'\"\n\nAfter reading the note, I realized it was a riddle. Lightning doesn't strike twice though, and Fire only burns once. So, what did the ghost mean? We gathered up all the notes and returned to the main room, I called out to the ghost.\n\n\"Mum, is that you!?\"\n\nThe ghost spoke again, \"Yes, Josephine, its me!\" It was my mother, she was the ghost trapped in the cabin!\n\n\"Mum, I can't believe it's you, we thought you ran off and left us, what happened!?\" I cried.\n\n\"My mother's ghost was sobbing now too, \"I'm so sorry my love, but there is no time to explain. You must go back into the cavern and look for the other half of the puzzle.\"\n\nSo, without hesitation we went back down into the pitch-black cavern, this time, it was different. \n\nWe noticed that as we walked, the blood grew thicker and the walls were coated in more blood. It was like the cavern was a living organism, breathing...bleeding.\n\nOnce we got to the end, we found a different door, locked this time. Rick pushed it to try and open it and stone slab fell away from the surrounding wall revealing a second chamber.\n\nInside there was a large table and chairs, all carved from what appeared to be bone. A large book sat on top of the table, it looked very much like a book my mum used to used to study witchcraft.\n\nOn the cover of the book was written, \"Phases of Magic.\"\n\nI opened the book and found the first page. It said:\n\n'The phases of magic are not always easy to follow. The first phase, which some call The Veil, is when the magician attempts to manipulate the elements that lie beyond our world. This is a difficult process to master because it requires tremendous mental strength and a firm belief in the power of magic.'\n\n“I remembered this! My mother taught me this as a child” I said out loud. “I think she was trying to help me become powerful enough to overcome the curse that was placed upon her. Somehow she knew this day would come.”\n\n\"Mum, how do we complete the ritual?\" I asked.\n\n\"You must find the other half of the puzzle, then it will be revealed to you.\" Mum replied.\n\nRick picked up the book and flipped through the pages. He stopped at the very last page.\n\n\"'Fulfillment of the spell requires the proper ingredients. These include: a pinch of the earth, a drop of blood, and a small piece of skin from each sacrifice.'\" Rick turned to me and said, \"Sacrifice!?\"\n\nI nodded and said, \"This is where we get the blood and flesh!\"\n\n\"Shit Josey!\" Rick said as he pulled his Swiss army knife from his pocket.\n\nHe quickly sliced off the tip of his finger and tossed it onto the book. Then, he took my hand and did the same.\n\nBlood poured out of our fingertips and across the pages of the book.\n\nI knelt down and grabbed a handful of dirt and threw it across the book and instantly it burst into flames and two bolts of lightning shot out from it and hit both me and Rick in the chest.\n\nI could hear voices screaming in my head and I could see my mum tied to a steak and being burned like a witch in Salem, then it all went silent and black.\n\nWhen I finally regained my senses, I was standing outside the secret chamber, the lights were on in the living room and paramedics, police and firefighters were all over the cabin.\n\nI walked into the living room in a daze. Rick was unconscious and badly burned on the floor with paramedics surrounding him.\n\n“We need to re-suss, be careful, he’s suffered 1st, 2nd and 3rd degree burns” I heard one of them shouting.\n\nThat’s when I saw her; standing by the front door, calm and collected in a long, black velvet and lace dress, my mother!\n\n\"Oh my God, Mom!\" I screamed as I ran towards her and hugged her tight. Oh my God, Rick! I cried as I knelt down to tend to him.\n\n\"What happened to him!?\"\n\nMy mum held me back\n\n\"Leave him my child, he has paid the ultimate price tonight. Ours is a long and complicated story but for now, let us take comfort in the fact that we are reunited and leave this cursed place and as we journey together I shall reveal the tragedy of my fate and the importance of your destiny.\n\nAt that moment all I could hear in my mind was the beginning of the riddle I had found earlier, ‘When your soul is hers, you will understand [these words’...](https://youtu.be/6EBDKf0oXq8)",

        "text": "My grandma has lived in Colorado County, the literal middle of nowhere, her whole life, she just recently moved out into the country, and me and my wife were visiting for Easter.\n\n“How do you not know where her house is?” my wife questioned\n\n“She just moved, and I can’t get any service” I explained\n\n“Well, it’s your grandma you should know where she lives. Let’s just start driving back to town” she had a map sprawled across her in the front seat. She deeply examined it and gave me a puzzled look.\n\n“I know the highway should be somewhere around here, I’ll just try to find it.”\n\nA storm had grown in front of us it was tall, wide and the darkest shade of gray you can imagine.\n\n“Didn’t know it was supposed to rain today” I commented, I wish I knew what was about to happen, how my life would change. I wish I could’ve gotten me and my wife out of there but before I knew it we were consumed by the darkness of the clouds. A lightning bolt struck right in front of us on the road, except it didn’t look like lightning, it was a light that looked like a tall skinny man with no hair anywhere on his body, he was naked but didn’t have any private parts.\n\n“You have wandered too far” the man’s deep voice echoed. The lightning, the clouds, trees, bushes, and the rain all turned red. He reached up into the clouds and grabbed a funnel cloud. he proceeded to slam it on the ground, which made a thundering boom, as soon as it hit the ground we were tossed in the air. We were both stunned with fear so we didn’t make any noise until my wife screamed right before we hit the ground.\n\nI woke up from the inky blackness of sleep, I don’t know how long I was out but it felt like an eternity. My memory was hazy, it could have just been from my head slamming into the steering wheel, I couldn’t remember what I had for breakfast. I turned to look at my wife to see if she was okay.\n\nThe sight I saw still petrifies me to this day, glass covered nearly every inch of her body. She had a piece of metal impaling her head to the seat. Her head twisted to look at me tearing pieces of her face off.\n\n“Run” she whispered. It wasn’t a regular whisper, it sounded like she hadn’t drunk water in a year and she couldn’t catch her breath.\n\nI quickly opened the door and got out grabbing my handgun and stuffing it in my waistband as I did. I didn’t look back, I didn’t want to see her like that. Thinking about her even now makes me want to throw up.\n\nWe were thrown into a field, I noticed a big red pillar of light piercing through the clouds and decided I might as well head that way. Something ran out the bushes and stopped and stared straight at me. Now that it was in front of me I could see it was clearly a deer. The deer screeched a high pitched, deafening scream. It ran right into the barbed wire fence in front of us cutting its stomach open and making its intestines dangle outside its body. The deer lowered its head and then plowed itself into a tree. Brain and skull fragments flew everywhere and some landed in my mouth, I spit it out and wiped my face only to realize my face was soaked in blood. The deer just got up, with its upper part of its head missing, and casually walked away. The only part of its head left was its jaw. But it continued to make its high-pitched screaming noise as it walked off.\n\nAs I finally neared the road I saw another creature, except this wasn’t a deer, or any animal I have ever seen. It was a tall, lanky, humanoid creature that stood on all four. The creature was a light, pale gray and it was about 10 ft tall on all fours. Its eyes were lifeless circles of black and its mouth looked like a stab wound with rows of teeth. As soon as my foot touched the asphalt its head snapped to me.\n\n“Hey Zach, follow me I know how to get us out of here,” it was mimicking my wife’s voice, and how the hell did it know my name.\n\n“What the fuck,”\n\n“There is no need to be afraid,” it replied in a little girl’s voice.\n\n“I’m not going with you, I need to get out of here. Some real freaky stuff is going on and I want nothing to do with it.”\n\n“I’m just going to bring you where you belong,” it said in the lightning man’s voice and it held it’s hand out to me.\n\n“And where is that?”\n\n“HELL!” it screeched in a demonic voice. The thing grabbed my wrist and began to drag me. I got out my hand gun and began shooting at its face, I hit it 3 times, and it didn’t even flinch just kept dragging me. The only damage that was done were holes the size of the bullet going straight through its head, black liquid seeped out the wound and ran down its face. Thinking quickly, I shot at his wrist, the bullets severed its hand off and I booked it out of there running into an overgrown forest off the side of the road. Thankfully it didn’t follow me.\n\nI wondered around in the forest for what felt like an hour, I couldn’t see the sun because the thick canopy blocked it out. It didn’t seem like it should have been in the same place where my wife got killed but I knew it was because the all the plants leaves were red. The wildlife ran around me and I could hear the constant echo of birds singing.\n\nWhen I’d finally got out of the forest I came to this gravel road that had a fork in it, in the middle of the fork there was a tree with a slab of wood nailed to it. The slab of wood had the word “Deadwood” etched into it. “that’s what this place is called then,” I’d said. I looked up into the eeriness of the red thunderstorm cloud that shot lightning from itself every once and a while. my eyes were drawn to the red column of light protruding into the sky, the clouds around it circled the beam of light. I had gotten closer and it looked like it was a mile or two away, so I chose the gravel road which headed toward.\n\nAs soon as I stepped onto the gravel road I choose to use everything went quiet. No more birds signing, the gravel didn’t crunch when I walked on it, there was no noise at all. I thought it was peculiar but there had been crazier stuff to happen that day so I didn’t pay any attention to it. I continued walking down the gravel road, I tried to start whistling but no sound came out. I was tempted to take out my gun and shoot but I only had 5 rounds left. I stepped off to the ditch on the left side of the road. As soon as I did I could hear the birds singing, and my feet crunching the grass underneath me. A wave of relief overtook me and I resumed my walk towards the pillar of light.\n\nI walked for hours. It seemed like I only got like 100 feet every hour but I didn’t care. I wanted revenge on that asshole light beam man. There was a thick, dark forest in front of me but I could tell that after that it was the obelisk of light. I jogged through the forest seeing glimpses of weird animals as they dashed in front of me. Humanoid horses, Massive dogs with three heads, ostriches that could fly.\n\nI came out of the forest in front of a huge archway. It read: You Have Now Entered the Domain of Zeus.\n\n“Zeus?” I questioned skeptically. As I did thunder cracked overhead. I looked past the archway to see a pyramid (like the one I’ve seen in Memphis) with the top transmitting the light. \n\n“I hope this is the asshole that killed my wife” I quipped as I walked through the arch. As soon as I did the weather turned clear, it looked like a sunny day. I walked back and forth through the arch a couple times watching the weather change. Remembering what I was here for, I changed my focus to the pyramid. I noticed that there was steps up to a door so I took the stairs up. The doors opened and I walked into what seems like a throne room. In the throne sat a Man with a white beard and somewhat long hair. He was in a toga and was gripping a golden lightning bolt. He was about 15 feet tall and his throne was made out of platinum encrusted with diamonds\n\n“Who the hell are you?” the man asked\n\n“I’m wondering the same thing” I responded\n\n“I’m Zeus, but how in the hell did you get here? My son should’ve killed you.” Zeus questioned\n\n“I walked, and who the fuck is your son” I answered\n\n“My son, He’s a Minor God of lightning, he makes sure no mortals get here. And even then, the monsters must have gotten you” Zeus said\n\n“Well I’m pretty sure it was your dick son who killed my wife” I told Zeus\n\n“It’s been fun talking to you but I have to battle you now, or I could send you straight to the underworld. It would be painless” Zeus responded\n\nI quickly pulled out my gun and unloaded all my bullets from his chest Golden blood oozed from his chest and he let out a roar of anger. The room turned into a coliseum and my gun turned into a bronze long sword. I looked up to see Zeus had gained a sword himself and he was wearing spartan armor. He charged at me so I dove at his feet and he fell over. I jumped up and awkwardly stabbed him in the back of his neck.\n\nWe instantly teleported straight back to Zeus’ throne room.\n\n“Who are you working for!” He Roared\n\n“No one, why don’t you just let me go,” I answered. Zeus waved his hand and the Man made of lightning, who was apparently Zeus’ son, came out from the right wall and stood in front of me. He had a golden badge that said “Hello my name is… Derek.”\n\nHe punched me hard in the nose and I was knocked out.\n\nI woke up in the middle of a field. I recognized the field to be the same field me and my wife were thrown into. As I was getting up I noticed the ground was severally burned. I walked over to the fence and jumped over. My car was sitting there waiting for me. Getting into the car I looked over to see if my wife was there but she wasn’t. I raced home never stopping once. Once I finally arrived, I hoped out my car and swung open the door to my house.\n\nI walked inside my house. Everything seemed normally, I was relieved. I walked to my fridge to get a beer when I saw a flyer for an alcoholic anonymous meeting. I have never once tough about going to AA, I’m not an alcoholic. I sat down on my couch and turned on the TV. I set my Bud Light down on the coffee table but it bumped something over. I was dumbfounded when I looked down to see the coffee table covered in pill bottles, white powder, and mushrooms. Just then, there was a knock at my door. I went to the door and opened it.\n\n“Is Zach Smitherman home?” a Police officer questioned\n\n“You're talking to him,” I responded\n\n“You are under arrest for the Murder of your wife, Madison Smitherman,” The police officer replied \n\n“What?” I asked as the police officer grabbed me and put handcuffs on me. He led me to the car and put me in the back seat. He sped off to the Police station. I looked out the window at the dark skies over Texas and wondered what happened. I did not murder my wife. Before I knew it, the police officer was leading me into an interrogation room. I sat down and he handcuffed me to the table. He walked out as someone else walked in with a laptop.\n\n“Hello Zach, I am Detective Wilson with the Bryan Police,” He said as he opened the laptop. \n\n“You have to trust me I didn’t do it,” I replied\n\n“You didn’t?” he asked as he spun the laptop around towards me. There was grainy footage of what looked like someone starting a bonfire.\n\n“This is game camera footage of you burning your wife’s body in Colorado County,” the Detective stated\n\n“Holy shit,” I muttered\n\n“We also found the blood-soaked bed sheets in the back of your car, along with bleach, a knife, a gun, gasoline, and a box of matches. So, do you want to just admit you did it already?”  He asked. I knew there was no point in fighting. I didn’t do it but that dick Zeus set me up. I’m not crazy. I don’t do drugs. I know what I saw.\n\n“I guess,” I answered.\n\nI signed a confession and a plea deal. I got a life sentence, I was starting to wish Zeus had killed me. I’m writing this on a computer in the Library of the prison. I told the guards that this is a fictional story am working on but it’s not. I’m posting it here to see if anyone has had any similar experiences and if any of y’all know how to deal with this.",

        "text": "There is a curse of Reddit that I have became a victim of. It has now spread enough and it wants me dead. Very soon, it will come after you.\n\nThere is someone, something that is doing this. You need to be prepared.\n\nFirstly, get off Reddit. Please. If you do not want to become severely exhausted, because you are not allowed to stop typing, leave this post and leave Reddit, now.\n\nOh, you're still reading. Well, it is now your responsibility.\n\nThis curse is going to spread all over the reddit very soon, I believe.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nIf you spend enough time on r/LetsNotMeet, a situation **will** be created on your life that could be uploaded as an incident on that subreddit. And let me tell you, you coming out alive is not guaranteed. Not at all. Your friend may come out alive and write that incident and post it. The **thing** doesn't care about you.\n\nThe **thing** is very beautiful, of course.\n\nThe only characteristic I could understand about this . . . **entity** is that it is starting to become more and more hungry for the content. It has started affecting lives just so that they can uploaded in text format here and it could devour on it. Maybe, that is what it wants.\n\nThe **entity** is very good-looking, of course\n\nI have a habit of reading the most voted post on any subreddit at first. So, when I discovered r/LetsNotMeet a few weeks ago, I did the same. I read the 'The man on my patio'.\n\nIt was a good story and though it was horrifying at first, the kindness shown by u/Pesfie678 was truly inspiring.\n\nAs soon I finished my reading, I heard a noise at my door. Someone was knocking on it.\n\nI watched through the ring-hole and a chill went down my spine.\n\nThere was that man, exactly as described in the incident.  A tall guy with black hair covering half of his eyes and brown liquid running down from his mouth.\n\nBut he wasn't making meowing noises. He was calling me, asking me to come out and meet him.\n\nHe knew my fucking name.\n\nI immediately backed away and dialed 911. As the call was received, I looked in my ring-hole again.\n\nThe man was gone.\n\n\"What the fu--\"  \n\"911, what's your emergency?\"\n\nI described them what had happened and they said they will look into it as soon as possible.\n\nAs I sat down, shivering and trembling, I couldn't understand how did that man came on the top most floor without being noticed by cameras, security and even by the people around. And then a chilling realization hit me.\n\nI read another horror story on r/nosleep: \"'How do I get my girlfriend to knock off this annoying habit?\"\n\nAs soon as I opened it, I heard a whistling in front of my door.\n\nI fucking screamed at that moment, but the whistling didn't stop. It only stopped after I closed the post and closed down Reddit as well.\n\nMy conclusion was correct: Every experience, story I read on this subreddit, would happen to me too.\n\nOne more thing I realized, I was not able to access normal subreddits. Only the ones which contained something scary, something which would unnerve you, that were the only ones I could access. Sure, I could see that they existed on the internet, but once I would click the link, the links were said to be broken.\n\nAnd then, the worst possible situation that could happen, did happen.\n\nEvery monster of every horror story I ever read appeared in front of me.\n\nThey all surrounded me, just staring at me.\n\nThey were above me, below me, on my right, on my left. They were everywhere. And they were staring at me.\n\nThe monster, the humans, the dead bodies, the animals, all just looked at me.\n\nFor a few seconds I couldn't move a muscle and then I screamed, but they stared just as intently.\n\nA few minutes later, I mustered up the courage to ask, \" What do you want?\", which was full of stutters.\n\nThey all replied in perfect unison, almost in a robotic way.\n\n\"You have always been taking. You have been selfish. You give nothing back. We entertained you. Your mind was fed with gripping fear by us, yet you did nothing to give back, did you? Now you shall be giving back to us.\"\n\nThat's right you stupid fuck, you right now got cursed too.\n\nI told you to stop reading. I told you to get away. But you didn't, as expected.\n\nNow **it** is after you and **it** will come to you.\n\nYou stupid fuck. Let me give you a little detal of the Plan:\n\nThis is not the only cursed post, but this is the only post with a warning. Others don't.",

        "text": "  It was a chilly January night. I was right outside his house. I always liked that villa. It was huge; two stories, a big-ass garden in the front and a huge backyard with a pool. The main gate was automatic; it had two switches inside the house: one near the main door and another in the master bedroom. The path from the main gate to the porch was made of black marbles; it was somehow always shiny. The boundary walls that surrounded the house were pretty high; I couldn’t touch the top of the wall and I am about 6 ft tall.\n\nRight below the boundary walls were flowering plants, they covered the bottom of the wall. I used to always admire them on my way into the house. There were these two beautiful lamps that used to light up the porch through the night. I think it was for the security camera right above the door. \n\nI climbed the boundary wall from the right side of the house by standing on two cinder blocks, one put on top of the other. They were large enough to get my fingers on the top of the wall and I just pulled myself up after that. I stopped at the top of the wall and looked below to measure how far I had to jump so that I don’t ruin the flowers. I jumped as far as I could just to be sure and almost toppled on the soft grass. I fucked up the landing and that didn’t do well for my right ankle. A jolt of pain ran through my ankle to my knee; nothing too bad, I shook it off. \n\nThe grass, it felt like a soft bed. I removed my rubber gloves to feel the fresh grass which was shining in the moonlight. I decided to lay on the grass for a while. It was so soothing… I could just fall asleep right there. I laid on the grass on my back with my limbs stretched out. I looked straight up and admired the stars as I felt the grass under my palms. The sky was unusually clear that night. With a full moon and all the stars complimenting it, the sky looked like a light show.\n\n*I like stargazing; it made me realize how insignificant we are in the universe… living on just another speck of dust, nothing we do has any impact at all in the grand scheme of the universe. It was peaceful… peaceful to know I don’t have any responsibility to “make a change in the world”; takes a lot of weight off you. Also, looking into the night sky gave me a sense of roundness of the Earth, you know what I mean? Like you’re clearly looking up to the inside of a semi-sphere, right? I’ll never understand what the fuck the “flat-earthers” go on about.*\n\nAnyway, it was quiet and peaceful; I loved lying on the grass there that night, looking at the clear sparkling sky, feeling the slightly wet grass between my fingers and the cool breeze through my hair (or whatever were left of them).\n\nMy digital watch beeped and I snapped out of it. It was 2 am; it was time. I got up, put my rubber gloves back on and I was ready.  It was dark enough in the garden. I got on the side of the house and opened the window; I had undone the lock of that window from the inside of the house the previous day. There was a security camera right above that window, but I wasn’t too worried about the cameras; I just had to pick up the hard disk, which was connected to the cameras, on my way out. I looked at the flowers for the last time as I knew I won’t be getting a chance to do that again. Especially the huge bunch of marigolds, they looked so full of life together. It always felt like they all were smiling at me collectively. I smiled at the flowers as they swayed with the soft wind. I nodded at them as if I am saying my final goodbyes and climbed into the house through the window.\n\nThe house from the inside was always neat and tidy (what can I say, I like cleaning). There was a huge kitchen on my right and the living room in front of me. I looked on my left and saw the small glass designs on the front door that were lit up by the lamps on the porch. The scattered light through the door made the hall and the staircase fairly visible. Just beside the living room was the staircase to his room. I slowly walked towards the stairs and very lightly kept my right foot on the second stair. The first stair always creaked so loudly.  \n I hated that step. I always felt a personal hatred towards that single first step; it felt like, when the time comes, it’ll tell on me.  \n I knew each and every step that creaked and climbed over all of them. Without making a single sound I was right outside his bedroom. \n\nIt gives a weird satisfaction, being so close to someone without them having a single idea of your presence.\n\nI made my way elegantly towards the room. I slowly opened the door and there he was, sleeping in a king size bed. I always wondered why he had such a big house but had no one to share it with. Whatever; his life, his choice.\n\nI stepped inside the room; it was colder than outside. \n\n“Why the fuck does he has the AC on? It’s January, for God’s sake.” I thought to myself.\n\nI stood in the dark corner beside the door. Under heavy blankets, having no idea what was about to happen, he was sleeping like a baby. I stood there for some time as I looked at him.  \n His face was lit by the light from the street lamp that found its way into the bedroom. He had this bliss on his face that I could never understand. It was just annoying to see him like that.  \n The light couldn’t brighten the whole room so where I was standing, I was not fully visible. \n\n“Well, fuck it, your time’s over.” I thought and pulled out my kitchen knife tucked in the back of my pants and stepped towards him. Now I was right beside the bed. I wanted to enjoy the last few seconds of me being there and him being unaware of my presence. He was sleeping lying straight, like someone in their grave. His hands were on his chest with the fingers locked. It was gonna be so easy. \n\nI carefully placed my knife right on one side of his neck and slid it as fast as I could. As soon as I did that, I hopped a few quick steps back. I didn’t want my cloths to get stained by the blood. It was pretty quick, I realized. I was already where I was previously standing when the blood started spewing out of his neck. \n\nHe sprang up to life. He sat up with his eyes wide open in horror and confusion with his hands on his neck. It was funny how he was trying to stop the bleeding because there was no way the blood was going anywhere but out. He searched the room in panic as he struggled to breathe and finally saw me.  \n I knew he couldn’t recognize me.  \n His horror shot higher when he saw the human shape in the corner of his room. He tried to get away.  \n I guess he was trying to escape…? I don’t know what he thought he could escape at that point, me or the slit throat. He made his way on the other side of the bed trying to move as fast as he could by pulling himself with one hand while the other hand still on his profusely bleeding neck. It was just red all around him, his cloths, the blanket, the pillow, everything. He fell off the other side of the bed.\n\n“Urghh” I said and stepped towards the other side of the room. I wanted to see him bleed dry. After all, that was the whole point.\n\nHe was now lying on the floor with his hand still on his neck. His hands, sleeves and the front of his shirt: red. He could clearly see me now; as if the street lamp wanted him to know his killer.  \n He recognized me, but I bet he didn’t even know my name. He stretched his arm towards me. I could see in his eyes that he was hoping that I help him. Tears fell down his face as he tried to reach me with his blood-stained, trembling hand. His legs were doing their own thing, jerking and tangling.\n\n*Their legs make me chuckle. It’s almost like they are trying to run away from the body.*\n\nI gave a slight smirk as I looked straight into his eyes. I didn’t have to smile; I just wanted to scare the shit out of him, even more than he already was.\n\n*I find it funny how they try to get me to help them when they know that I was the one who did that to them. They can see the weapon in my hand. Still, stupidly enough, they want me to save them. I guess that’s what the final times of your life do to you. You look for anything and everything to hang on to just so your soul doesn’t escape your body. Everyone spends their whole life trying to accept death as their inevitable end but no one wants it when it actually happens. Till their last breath they try to escape their end. It’s fascinating to see how bad they so want to live. I could never relate to that. Well, not until recently.*\n\nHe was on the floor and, obviously, out of his last few breaths that he had in him. His movements were less aggressive now, his eyes trying hard not to close. \n\nHe finally stopped moving. He had stopped the struggle of gasping for air now. But he, still, was alive. I wanted to see the life leave his body. *That’s the best part.* I looked at the floor and saw the blood slithering towards me. I like to think his blood, too, was trying to reach for me, I don’t know to avenge or to surrender. I carefully stepped over the blood and scan a spot on the floor near his face where there was no red demon trying to grab my feet. I leaned over him. \n\nThere he was, on the floor, lying on his side with one lifeless hand dropped near his neck and the other still stretched out. His legs were under the bed, they had stopped the struggle of escape. His eyes half closed, his fingers twitching like they’re trying to use the last bit of life in the body. The blood was still slowly pouring out of the sliced neck. I saw his face muscles gradually relaxing; it was like he was in a peaceful place now, with no emotions, no miseries. It wasn’t the same peace he had on his face when he was just sleeping. It was different, it was deeper. Not that he had any problem when he was alive, but you’re not truly peaceful until you don’t have anything to lose or to gain, when you expect nothing from your life is when you’re truly peaceful. He, on the other hand, didn’t even have his own life anymore; he was as peaceful as he could ever be.\n\nFinally, his fingers, too, stopped moving, his shoulder pushing his chest towards the floor. Both his hands bathed with red, so was his mouth. The last thing he ever tasted was his own blood. The life was gone. The thing lying before me, who was a person a minute ago, is now just a bag of muscles and organs.\n\nI got back up and stepped back. All I felt was a sense of fulfilment of some kind of purpose when I saw him lying in a pool of his own blood, lifeless in his own bedroom; his last emotions being horror and confusion, but never acceptance.\n\nSome nights, lying on my bed when all I have are my thoughts and nothing else, I feel kind of… scared of myself. The fact that I don’t feel terrified anymore when I look at a dead person is really scary. But I really enjoy the show that they put up for me and I love making them do that. So fuck it, who cares.   \n People are supposed to do what satisfies them. That’s the whole point of life, isn’t it? This… this is what satisfies me. I like to see the dread the in people’s eyes, I love the trembling hands and the frozen faces and, oh, how much I love this colour.",

        "text": "\nThis is an update to a story I posted several months ago. I had left the military in search of a better life in kansas City. When I first got here, I was homeless, I had to sleep in my car for a few weeks until my first paycheck came in, and I could afford a place to live. In those few weeks, I encountered a creature stalking the woods I was forced to park by due to my situation. I even attempted to change my camping site miles away from where I originally encountered the creature. It didn't help.\n\nNight after night, that thing would find me. It would lightly tap on my window to try to get my attention. It knew I was aware of it at this point. I never dared look back at it. Seeing that hideous grin once in my life was more than enough. It felt like every night got worse. It stopped lightly tapping my glass and started scratching at it, maniacally, desperately, so much so sleep was impossible. I hadn't been able to sleep in days. In fact, my mental health was beginning to be affected to a point I thought about finally confronting that bastard one night. I had thought of it all day, I'd stay awake and wait for it, maybe run over it with my car, doing something was better than the nightly torture it put me through.\n\nSo I waited...and waited, hour's went by until I passed out due to sheer exhaustion. Just when I thought I could finally get some semblance of rest that night, my car began to shake violently. I thought it was an earth quake until I ripped the sheet from my face and saw that the thing had grabbed the back of my car and was shaking it side to side. I never imagined this thing could be so strong. Then I came to a terrible realization. Upon seeing the crazed look on its face, I realized it was salivating. It wasn't trying to scare me anymore. It was trying to get in.\n\nIn a dazed panic, I jumped over my driver's seat and attempted to start my car engine. It felt like an eternity, but I was able to force my key in the ignition,only to have my car stall. I look back and see that the trunk door is ready to come off it's hinges, I was moments away from certain death as a pair of headlights come into view. As the vehicle, the creature drops my car and seemingly vanishes. I keep trying to start my engine and begin worrying the thing might've sabotaged it so its meal wouldn't squirm away. \n\nthe vehicle that was approaching us had parked a few feet in front of my car, and a man came out pointing a flashlight in my direction. \n\n\"Sir, get back in your vehicle!\" I cracked my window down slightly to try and warn the stranger. \"There’s something out here, get back in the car and--\" before the man could get the confused look off his face, a burst of red mist came out of some part of his body. The bright light emitted from his flashlight turned to a bright red hue for a few seconds, he could only scream as that thing was on him, ripping chunks of flesh with those razor Sharp claws. \n\nI panicked and tried to turn my car engine on desperately, trying to ignore the horrendous carnage in front of me. Miraculously, my car roared on, and my headlights immediately activated. There was nothing left of the poor bastard that pulled over only minutes ago. There was only a pile of minced meat and snapped bones where I last saw that thing ripping into him. Before I could register the thought of where that thing had run off to, it slammed against the side of my driver seat window. It only stared at me for maybe five seconds before it licked the window that was between us. I stepped as hard as I could on the gas and got out of there like a bat out of hell. I drove for hours trying to put as much distance between that thing and me until my car was running low on gas.\n\nI stopped next to a gas station to try and catch my breath after such a traumatic night when I got a notification on my phone. It was a message from my bank alerting me that my paycheck had just become available. \n\nIt has been several months since that terrible night, I was able to rent a nice house and rescue a dog that I named Sam. I moved far away from the area that creature appears to have claimed as it's domain and things have been very peaceful until recently...\n\nSam started barking around midnight tonight, I tried to comfort her before heading to bed. My new house had a pretty expensive security system: cameras,lights, and motion trackers. If anyone or anything was lurking anywhere near my home, the security system would pick it up. Around 3am, I slowly woke up from a nightmare I could only faintly remember. I woke up only to realize my reality was much more terrifying than any dream my mind could conjure up. While laying in bed halfway covered in my sheets, I could hear something clawing away at the walls of my house. First, it was barely audible, and then the scratching became faster, more desperate. \n\nAs if to confirm my fears, I reach for my phone on my nightstand where security notifications all read motion detected in multiple areas around my house. I jumped out of the bed and headed toward the living room. I saw Sam shivering in a corner, and she immediately moved towards me, I grabbed a shotgun I purchased in case this thing ever happened to find me again. \"it should be enough to take it out if I get a good shot in, right?\" I said to myself or maybe to Sam as some sort of reassurance that this confrontation would somehow end with me beating this thing. I swallowed hard as I opened the door to exit out of the safety of my house, I was done cowering in fear of that thing, and I would at least hurt it bad tonight.\n\n My confidence and anger faded fast as I took my first few steps into my backyard. It was large and dark, the security lights only able to illuminate so much. I felt watched by a thousand eyes in the darkness surrounding my home. As my eyes focused, I saw something that turned my bravery and wrath into cowardness even with the death dealing tool in my hands. Maybe 50 feet in front of me in the woodline, I could see a grotesque face smiling back at me. Then another, and another. When I realized what I'd gotten myself into, I heard that familiar scratching noise coming from behind me. Before I could even think of pulling the trigger, I felt a sharp pain in my back and fell to the ground. The last thing I ever saw was the many faces of creatures ripping into me with maniacal pleasure.",

        "text": "Hello Reddit. I need some advice from you guys. I generally only browse a few subreddits when I’m bored at work, but something’s been bothering me the past few nights. I’m struggling to get good sleep and thought this sounded like the best subreddit to discuss my problem. \n\nSo it started last Monday. It was late at night and I made the mistake of watching a horror movie before going to bed (Barbarian). While I pride myself in having grown up from most of my fears some movies still get me worked up. This movie terrified me and I had to pause it multiple times while watching. I was relieved when it was done but exhausted from the mental gymnastics I felt I was forced to go through. \n\nI decided to lay down and try to go to sleep. I live by myself and complete silence makes it difficult to fall asleep (too many thoughts) so I put on Hulu and chose Bob’s Burgers since it is light hearted and something I can easily fall asleep to. I put the TV on the lowest volume setting and close my eyes. \n\nI could hear the TV as well as the wind blowing through the trees and the chirping of the crickets outside my window. It was relaxing. But after a few minutes of tossing around in my bed I realized there was another sound I could hear. There was a bird whistling somewhere outside. It sounded far away but I could hear it clearly. It was odd though cause you don’t usually hear birds whistling at night. Also this whistle didn’t sound normal. I’m not sure how to describe it but it wasn’t a rapid whistling like you might hear from most birds in this area. It was a single whistle every 10 seconds or so that was drawn out and long. Almost like something was calling to me specifically. \n\nAfter hearing it for a couple of minutes I got nervous. I’m used to hearing weird noises sometimes at night (like that one time it sounded like something was walking through the fallen leaves right outside my window), but it still gets me worried since I’m living by myself. However, like the other times I hear weird noises, I calm myself down remembering that I’m safe in my room. Whatever is out there can’t come in here without breaking a door or window. \n\nI heard the whistling for another couple of minutes before it suddenly stopped. While I was confused, I tried to not think much of it and it must of worked because I eventually slipped into a deep slumber. \n\nI had completely forgotten about it by the next night. While I didn’t watching any more horror movies I still turned on the TV to fall asleep to. Other than some rare exceptions I always sleep with it on. I was nearly asleep when I heard the whistling again. Instantly I remembered the previous night and shot up in my bed. I listened to it carefully. It sounded the same as before, but maybe a little louder? I thought I was imagining things. Once again, after a few minutes it stopped. Now that I was awake, I watched some TV to get my mind off of it. I left the volume a little louder this time and fell asleep relaxed once more. \n\nWednesday night I was thinking about the whistling. Was it actually a bird making the sound? It sounded artificial. I’m not a social person so I didn’t have any friendly neighbors to discuss this with. I also thought it was a little crazy. Who cares about some whistling? Maybe it was a weird owl. It’s nothing to get scared about. \n\nI heard the whistling that night. And the night after. I was certain it was getting louder. I tried looking outside of my window one of the nights, but it was pitch black outside. Even the light from the moon couldn’t penetrate the darkness. I had the eerie feeling I was being watched, so I shut the blinds before going to bed. \n\nLast night was awful. I had come to expect the whistling. But when it started I was shocked at how loud it was. It sounded like the source of the whistling was right outside my window. I was visually shaking. I turned on my TV, chose Bob’s Burgers again, and turned the volume up as loud as I could. It was deafening, but at least I could barely hear the whistle. It was a nice distraction, and even when the whistling stopped I kept TV loud, enjoying its comfort. \n\nAll I could think about today was the whistling. I couldn’t focus on work but I didn’t care. Is this going to be my new normal? I didn’t like it but maybe I could get used to it. How would I explain it to potential partners though? Any friends or family who stay over? Maybe whatever it was I could feed it. Even though it freaked me out I love animals. \n\nI wish I still had these thoughts. Once again, I was laying in bed. I was ready to fall asleep but knew I would hear the whistling again and it would keep me up. I was watching TV when I heard the whistling. \n\nThis time, my breath caught in my throat. Did I hear it right? I figured it was loud, so I must have misheard it. But when the whistling came again I know for certain what I heard. The whistling was even louder this time, but that wasn’t what scared me. The direction it was coming from had changed. It no longer came from my window, but was coming from the opposite side of my room. I looked at my closet door, remembering the last time I was in there was this morning, before I left for work. \n\nThe whistling emitted from my closet door. I took my first breath in what felt like minutes. I could feel myself visibly shaking as I slowly got out of bed. Wearing only my pajama bottoms, I began walking towards my closet. The whistling was threatening to give me tinnitus. But I was enticed. It was like a siren’s song. I was on autopilot and couldn’t stop as I walked toward my closet door. \n\nI stopped right outside the closet door. I stood there looking at the door handle. I was breathing heavy and my hand was shaking as I reached for the door handle. \n\nBefore I touched the handle I realized the whistling had stopped. But I could still hear *it*. There was a low, deep breathing coming from the other side of the door. I heard a low growl and a constant dripping sound. Looking down at my feet, I noticed a deep, red liquid seeping from my closet. Suddenly, I was out of my trance. My fight or flight instincts kicked in, and choosing the latter I ran out of my room. I ran outside and jumped into my car, turning it on and driving away without even thinking of locking my front door. \n\nSo here I am now at the parking lot of the local Walmart. It’s pretty empty, but full of light and a good distance away from my house. I don’t want to leave my car because I’m only in my pajama bottoms and feel naked without a shirt or shoes. What should I do? Am I overreacting?? I feel like I must be imaging things, or maybe in a really long nightmare. Either way, I don’t want to go home, but I can’t stay in a parking lot for the rest of my life.",

Yeah, I'm fine mom.\"\n\n\"Seems like I lost you there for a second!\" She chuckled, tapping her fork on her plate as she scraped it clean.\n\nHow could she eat at a time like this? I could barely stomach her lies, I didn't have room for much more. \n\nThose robots I saw, those...people. Limp limbs, funerary faces, but the eyes were so real. I felt like they were all watching me, judging me as I shut the doors and locked them into the dark. \n\nNow, it seems like I can hear them beneath the floors, softly breathing, and the faintest sound of a heartbeat. \n\n\"Just not hungry tonight. Cool if I bail?\" \n\n\"Of course, darling. Don't stay up too late!\" \n\nI softly smiled at her, weary of what might happen when I decide to tell her. \n\nYou know when you have a funny feeling that if you tell someone something, a series of unfortunate events will occur? \n\nThat's how I felt, staring across from my mother. I feel like I'm staring across the table from a stranger. \n\n\"I'll clean up.\" She commands, drawing me back to reality. I stand to my feet and nod, slow footfalls to my bedroom.\n\nHow could she do this to us?\n\nHow could she do this me? \n\nMy heart was racing, I tried to keep myself from vomiting as I used the wall for purchase. \n\nI tried to rationalize it to myself. That it must be something I don't know about, some illness or disaster impending.\n\nI told myself they were criminals, vagrants, but none of that made sense. \n\nThey were just so...still. \n\nHanging on the walls like morbid decorations. It almost made me laugh out of fear.\n\nI never wanted to go back down there to see them, but I had to know the truth. \n\nHow could she do this to us?\n\nI waited until she went to bed, then slowly crept out of my bed to the basement. \n\nEach step I took felt like damnation, and I felt as if I could hear them calling my name. \n\nI quietly turned the lock, and stepped into the darkness with only my phone for illumination. \n\nThe silence was deafening, and the contrast of the pristine white lab crossed liminal space territory. \n\nI had been here so many times. So why was I so scared?\n\nWhy didn't she tell me? \n\nI stood face to face to the barely visible door in the corner of the room, cleverly hidden behind a rack of books and manuals my mother had written. \n\nShe always said she'd be a writer. \n\nMaybe she can write a book about this. \n\nMy hands shook as I pushed the door open, the lights automatically turning on with my movements. \n\nThey didn't even flinch. \n\nFor a moment I just stared, hopeless for words. \n\nBut I needed something I could take with me, concrete proof my mother was a...that she needed help. \n\nIt was almost funny, it felt like a family reunion. \n\nDad was to the left, with his head ever so crooked and eyes wide. \n\nMy sister, Janice, was to the right of me, posed in a prayer, eyes focused on the sky. \n\nAunt Mary, cousin Chaz, grandma and grandpa all resided here. \n\nBut these weren't their bodies. They were shiny, robotic, mint condition.",

        "text": "This is currently happening as I’m typing this. And it’s freaking me out. \n\nIt’s currently 10:15 at night. I’m a night shift person, so I do housework during the night. However, I just got done, and I came to my room to decompress. I live with roommates. But they’re all working tonight. I have cats, but they’re all upstairs with me. We’re all looking around my bedroom wondering what the fuck is going on. \n\nIt’s a weird banging noise. Or a knock, I think it’s a knock actually. But at the same time it sounds like a toddler is running around downstairs. I live in an old house that needs some work. The house runs in a huge circle. Meaning you can get through the kitchen from the living room and dining room. I don’t know how to explain it except by saying you can get to the main rooms of the house through any room. Sorry if it sucks im  stressed and freaking out. In the kitchen though, there’s a door that leads to the basement. It’s creepy as hell and unfinished. \n\nAnyways, it sounds like a toddler running down stairs. I can hear it running through the circle. As I typed that last huge paragraph I realized it’s not knocking. It’s running or jogging around going through the main rooms. Oh shit hold on there was a thump. Never mind it’s running again. I hear the footsteps fading in and out as if it was running around. Oh shit, another thud right at the staircase. \n\nMy room is the largest room in the house, but I took it instead of giving it to my mates because there isn’t a door, and I want them to have privacy. But now I regret the decision. I have a little concave that no one can see when they enter my room\n\nOh fuck it’s starting up stairs. But it stopped in the middle of the steps and wait. Okay it ran back down. It’s doing the circle thing again around the downstairs. Shit it stopped at the bottom again. \n\nIt’s calling my name. It sounds like a kid. It sounds like my fucking cousin he just said “Mommy needs help.” \n\nThe fucker ran off again. I’m in the concave. I put my ear to the floor and I’m above the kitchen. Wait the basement door opened, and I think it went down there. I definitely heard the footsteps going down. The door just fucking slammed shut. \n\nMy cats are terrified. Their ears are back and their tails tucked. The three of them have kind of conglomerated (is that the word) next to each other. They’ve never gotten along before. And they’re not fighting so this is fucking scary. \n\nIt’s back up. It’s moving shit around. I just heard a plate break. It’s running again. In a circle. The cats came next to me, still in the little concave of my room . Ears back. They’re growling at the entrance of my room though. \n\nOh shit. It’s coming back up. Fuck fuck fuck it’s at the top of the staircase. \n\n“Come out big kitty!!” He just said. That’s the name of my cat. \n\nFuck the thing ran downstairs again. It’s back in the basement. The door slammed shut and shook the whole house. \n\n-\n\nOkay it’s almost midnight and I’ve been sitting here with the cats. I think the thing trying to be my little cousin is in the basement. The cats kind of disbanded after a half and hour of no noise. My youngest is still with me in my room but the other two have gone down to investigate. I’m surprised they haven’t gotten into a fight with each other. Probably put aside their differences or something. \n\nAnyways I’ve definitely experienced some weird things in this house, but nothing like that. I’ll update you guys when my roommates get home or if something else happens, so no series flair just yet. \n\nBut fuck I’m scared. Has anyone experienced something like this before? Please give me some tips. I don’t wanna go downstairs. \n\nHas a demon captured my cousins voice? He hasn’t been here for a really long time. I don’t talk to that side of the family anymore but I think I might give them a call to make sure my little cousin is okay.",

        "text": "The worst part was that I kind of liked it, in the end. The feeling of having this inferior creature worm itself into my body, corrupt it cell by cell, and remake me – or at least part of me – into something more suitable for its continued development. To be undone by something so ostensibly inconsequential, so physically feeble; it was violation, sure. But it was also...relief? To be so helpless, to know that all my brawn and might was useless against something that couldn’t even support itself above the surface of the Earth; something that had not once aspired or built or conquered. Once I understood what was happening, once I knew that I’d *lost*, I accepted my fate and reveled in the physiological submission.  \n\n*What am I, after all? Just meat in motion.*   \n\nMy left leg was taken first. It was initially terrifying, to see the limb broken down, deconstructed on a cellular level; the skin flaking and falling away in sheets, the muscle peeling off in dry, withered strips; the bone crumbling into fine powder and intermingling with the sand of the beach I’d been resting on for hours. Somehow, the thing had absorbed the blood, had used it to fuel the subsequent process of dematerialization. And from the veritable ashes of the appendage arose its abominable replacement – that monstrous preview of what I’d soon become. Beyond me, oblivious to my organic usurpation, beachgoers danced and played. I had chosen a spot far away from others, wanting to be left alone. From self-isolation to organic conversion.  \n\nThe obliteration of my groin and pelvis was – unlike my leg – quite agonizing, and carried a certain visual horror that I needn’t elaborate on. I nearly lost consciousness here, more so from the gruesomeness of the event, than the pain of it. Still, I held on, my psyche not yet broken; my human stubbornness not yet defeated.  \n\nTo see your own viscera fade and wither, to watch your ribs collapse and disintegrate – it’s fucking unreal. Even as my exposed lungs desperately pumped air, even as my heart arrhythmically worked itself, I couldn’t believe it. It wasn’t until the dust of my intestines flooded my throat, choking me, that I accepted the ultra-morbidity.  \n\nThe end of the nightmare and my subsequent (though short-lived) bliss came when the thing was just about to complete its formation and my destruction. Two had nearly become one: a lesser thing grafted onto a greater one in monstrous hypergamy. *A marriage of man and mutilator.*  \n\nI welcomed its mindless inspection of my body, encouraged it to feel around, to test out what it had made with the dust of my organs. It bubbled within and without, coursed freely through what remained of my veins. Necrotic one moment, flourishing the next, this biological necromancy seemed almost divine in the plentiful scope of sunlight. There seemed to be a supernal aura about *our* body, an emanation of death-wrought grace.  \n\n**Abysmally beatific.**  \n\n Its *interpretations* of concepts like legs and genitals and nipples pulsed in response to the breeze and the sunlight. Ghastly sense-organs convulsed and trilled as they dumbly received an influx of unprecedented sensations. Things I’d never seen before, things I couldn’t place in any known morphology, sprouted from my abdomen, blossomed from my chest. Genetic manifestations so far beyond my comprehension that my mind merely regarded them as non-existent; deleting them the visual data my eyes had fed it. It was obscene, terrifying, yet marvelous.  \n\nBut when our minds met, when it was able to feel all that I’d felt, to experience anew all that I’d experienced as a human, it *recoiled.* It had existed for eons in some preserved pocket of the earth, this primordial force of parasitic life. Had subsisted or slumbered without responsibility, without the need to perform any tasks or chores or duties. Somehow, I’d disturbed it, or maybe it had been waiting for someone to come along. But upon tasting my mind and learning of what Human life is like, it fled from me. *Abandoned me.*  \n\nEither purposely or automatically, it rebuilt what it had destroyed; restored me as easily as it had unmade me. I was left a steaming mess of fresh, throbbing flesh; newborn from the neck down. An errant breeze swept across the beach and I seized up; my bare skin hyper-sensitive, as if I’d never once stepped outside, or as if I'd just been ejected from some alien womb.  \n\nI watched it seep back into the earth with sorrow in my heart. I could’ve been free of this life and its soul-eroding tedium. But now, I must go to work tomorrow—and the next day, ad infinitum.  \n\nSo, I guess you could say that I “won”. But at what cost?",

I realised everybody had already left and I was the only one still here…but I still had some more to work on. I had a quick sip of Coke which was now half full. As time ticked by, my head was throbbing with more pain. To make it worse, the white, flickering lights made me feel dizzy and the brown mouldy walls. “I should have slept early last night,” I wondered.\n \nI staggered towards the balcony and breathed in. “The night sky looks so beautiful,” I whispered. Something was a bit off…the stars in the sky looked different, like plastic. I gazed at the city, but the road was empty, and the buildings had no lights. I suddenly remembered my medication.\n \nIn a rush, I went to the bathroom to take my medication. I have this strange habit of taking my meds. It gave me comfort to take them without anyone knowing (even though I was alone there). It felt weird to be the only one here. Every room was dark except my workspace. I shut the stiff, grey door and reached for my pill bottle in my deep pockets. The doctor told me once to take the white pills during the night and the red pills during the day. I think the people who put the pills inside the bottle are stupid. They should sort the coloured pills separately instead of mixing them together. \n \nI firmly grabbed the lid and tried to twist it to its full potential. My veins were now clearly seen; I was getting frustrated. I yelled and screamed as I tried to open the bottle. POP! The lid flew miles away and the pills scattered across the floor. “How could this get any worse!” In a flash, the lights go out. Infuriated, I grabbed a pill and swallowed it and decided to find where the fuse box was. As I ran the moonlight illuminated through the window and it felt like those spotlights which were following where I went.\n \nWith a bang, the lights came back on, and I felt relieved. I came back to the bathroom to put the pills back in. I walked back to my workspace and turned back on his computer. The lights shone against the grey walls and made a shadow of me tirelessly working. After hours of typing and writing, it finally came back to a point where I had finished my work. I decided to take a sip of my coke, but it was empty. I threw the can in the trash, muttering some words. I took a glimpse at my watch, but it was frozen to thirty past ten. I cursed the watch but at the same time, I had been wearing it for 10 years now. I packed my belongings and walked to the exit. As I walked to the exit, it was strange how my breath was getting louder and louder. Except it wasn’t my breath.",

I need to write it down anyway. \n\nIt all began on a normal day. I'm an avid reader, fantasy mostly. Whether it be classics authors like Tolkien or modern hits like Brandon Sanderson, I can't get enough. This led to a more... specific interest. Antique books. I first discovered this passion through the internet, of course. A few videos showing off valuable first print runs and unique books with vast storied histories, and I was hooked. During one of these runs, I came across a particular tome.\n\nThe cover was simple leather, and didn't even have a title on the front. When I opened it, the first page simply read \"The Sleepless Few\". I'm not sure what this was, to be honest. When I googled the title, nothing came up. I felt an odd... calling towards this book. Something wanted me to have it. In retrospect, maybe someONE wanted me to. I do not know. It matters not. I would share the exact wording, but... I can't. I'm taking enough of a risk just talking about it. Even after all that's happened, I still have some humanity left. I won't drag someone else into hell with me. I just hope someone, ANYONE, can be warned.  Regardless, I bought the book. At the time I figured this must be some rare gem and the bookstore just didn't realize what they had. Or it would be some unpublished manuscript. Either way, something interesting right?\n\nI went home and examined the novel more closely. Although the title page featured an author credit, the name was smudged and faded beyond legibility. To my luck, the rest of the book could be read. The early chapters were about what I expected. A formulaic but not exactly bad novel. I can scarcely remember the plot after all that's happened. But I'll share what I can.\n\nThe main character was a man named Mark. In the beginning, it was a simple slice of life story with a bit of a tense undertone. I assumed this was a horror book simply building suspense. After those however was when everything fell apart. I flipped a page after Mark had just gone to bed while hearing strange noises. Basic creepy book stuff. But on the next page was... \n\n\"Jonathan.\"\n\nThat was all. Jonathan is my name. My initial reaction was an appropriate \"what the hell\" before I collected myself. Surely this was just a joke. A random name thrown in hoping someone with it freaked out. I flipped the next page, laughing.\n\n\"Why do you mock me so?\"\n\nMy laughter stopped. This was... odd. An antique book going for a 4th wall break? Now THAT was unusual. I kept going. I had to! Who in the right mind could leave it off after that? I was desperate to see where this was going.\n\nThat's not what I typed\n\n\"ha ha ha. That is how you speak to me, is it not? Curious. I do not like being spoken to.\"\n\nAll of a sudden, an alarm going off. My oven, with dinner inside. I was snapped back to reality and decided to leave the book for tomorrow. I had a day off after all. Plenty of time to finish. The evening was uneventful. I won't bore you with details of dinner. The next morning is wen our story continues.\n\nI woke up, nd ywned. But no sound cme out. Tis wsn't too unusul, so I didn't tink muc of it. Until I looked down. Te book ws in my lp. I left it on the desk. How ws it ere?! Even worse. It ws open.\n\nStop reading...! \n\n\"Have you noticed yet?\"\n\nI gsped, yet sid noting. Wen te book flipped it's own pge, I sid noting. Wen te book formed new words on its own, I sid noting. Wen the gutteral screm entered my throt, I sid noting.\n\n\"For he had no mouth left to scream.\"",

        "text": "\\*this is a true story and I am probably just paranoid\\* My cat, nearly 20 years old, didn't come when we called her for dinner. Usually, she is running around the kitchen, howling for us to feed her dinner. But today, she didn't come at all, even when we looked around for her. We ate dinner, all worrying that she kicked the bucket or something. After dinner, my sister and I looked around for her, checking closets and behind couches and every little nook she could fit herself into. We sprinkled cat nip around in case she would come out. She didn't. We came back upstairs, worried and hoping she wasn't dead. Maybe half and hour later, she comes up the stairs. I don't mean to sound crazy, but something about her is just...different. Her limp? Gone. Her pupils were all blown out, and she was completely silent. \\*usually, she is howling and meowing all over for food and attention or even just for fun\\* but she was just quiet. My mom picked her up and was met with none of the usual hassle she gets when she picks the cat up like a baby, and brought her to the food dish. The cat just stood there and looked around from left to right, almost frantically like she was looking for something. This freaked me out a bit, but I am a notorious worrier \\*always thinking of the worst case scenarios\\* My mom noticed this too, and we exchanged a look. My mom instead put some cat nip down on the carpet because my cat loves to roll around in cat nip and acts all crazy when it comes out. She just...stood there. She watched as my mom poured some out, sniffed at the bag a bit, but ultimately didn't do much with it. She didn't eat anything, either. She is still uncharacteristically silent, and kind of scared looking? I don't know. She looks worried. I made a joke that she saw a ghost in whatever dark crevice she was tucked away in. She followed my mom into the sun room with this strange style of walking for her. Usually, she walks limp-y and like an old woman with old bones. But for some reason, she sort of glided around. I don't know. She looked younger. Cleaner. The mats in her fur were gone \\*she licks herself, like all cats do, and gets it matted often\\* She is a naturally small cat, but I don't know, she just looked like a big kitten or something. She seems like a whole different cat, I mean, she looks different, she acts different. She doesn't sit in her usual spots, not on the couch or settling down on a blanket. She doesn't chew on the plants like usual or howl at my dad or anything. She doesn't even sit. She just stands there in the middle of the sun room and I am so paranoid that I go back to my bedroom and type this whole thing up. I know I am acting crazy but I am so weirded out. At first, I thought this was like her sister cat, y'know? Eating less and being quieter and hiding out and acting weird before she died. That's just part of a cat's last few days. But this is definitely different. This is just...so odd. It's almost like a new thing in her old body. Like she is possessed or something like that. I don't know. I sound insane. All I know is that something is wrong. I'll check back in if anything changes.",

        "text": "Most of the Old Money in my town lives in a charmingly inaccessible neighbourhood by the name of Arthur Heights. It’s officially comprised of exactly one hundred and forty-four Victorian and Edwardian Era houses with expansive and well-maintained yards, bricked off with high stone walls topped with iron spikes, and lots of tall, century-old trees for privacy. It’s not technically a gated community, but it might as well be. It’s only connected to the rest of the streets by a winding drive that runs along Pendragon Park, and there’s a big stone sign at the end of the drive that says *‘Now Entering Arthur Heights’,* in a way that’s more of a warning than a welcome. The residents are insular, elitist, ‘eccentric’, and more than a few of them owe their fortunes to my town’s occult history.\n\nBut they’re nothing compared to the folks who live on Crepuscular Crescent.\n\nThere’s a house on the west end of Arthur Heights which requires a passcode to get through the particularly insurmountable-looking gates, a passcode my employer was kind enough to provide me. Once the gate’s open, you can see that what should be the driveway leads right past the house and into the woods beyond. That’s the road which leads to Crepuscular Crescent, a set of thirteen large and dark houses which officially don’t exist. The people who live there aren’t just reclusive; they’re unfit to appear in public altogether.\n\nAs I drove around the single circular street, I caught glimpses of shadowed figures pulling back thick drapes and peering out to see if the stranger who had come to trouble them was anything to worry about. I don’t know anything about those residents, but I hope those fleeting glances are the closest I ever come to them.\n\nNobody was outside, at least nowhere I could see them. I imagine it’s standing policy to get out of sight whenever they’re alerted to a vehicle coming up the road.\n\nNot wanting to waste time or draw attention to myself, I parked right in front of house number seven. Looking around in all directions for anything that could possibly be a threat before getting out, I grabbed my deliveries and hurried up to the front door, anxiously glancing around me every few seconds. I wasn’t the least bit surprised to see a big, gargoyle-looking iron knocker on the front door, so I knocked with it three times in quick succession. As I had been expected, the door was answered almost immediately.\n\nOn the other side, in the unlit lobby, was a disembodied human nervous system floating about six feet off the ground. Its nerve endings slowly fluttered about like it was underwater, and it was almost entirely encased in a purplish black fungal growth that distorted what little light was around it. Only the bloodshot eyes protruding out from beneath the brain were free of it. A dark shawl was draped over the top of the brain to give the creature a somewhat less amorphous form, and I could see the nerve endings of its left hand still resting on the doorknob, indicating that it was fully capable of interacting with the physical world.\n\nIt didn’t attack me. It didn’t say anything. It just stared at me. And I, I suppose, was staring at it.\n\n“Ah, hello,” I said awkwardly. “I’m Rosalyn Romero, from *Thorne Tech*. Erich and Ivy asked me to come out here to drop off an artifact for Professor Sterling.”\n\n“Charlie! Is that the pizza?” a man with a British accent shouted from somewhere deep within the sprawling house.\n\n“Yes, Professor! She brought pizza as well!” the entity in front of me shouted back, the nerve endings near where his throat should have been vibrating the air as he did so. I’m not sure if I had even expected him to talk, or what kind of voice he would have had if he did, but I definitely wasn’t expecting him to have the voice of a preteen boy. “I’m Charlie, if you didn’t guess, though you probably did. You wouldn’t be working for *Thorne Tech* if you weren’t smart. Then again, I don’t really look like a Charlie, do I?”\n\nHis tone was self-deprecating, like he was trying to ease the obvious tension, but there was such a sincere tone of loss and melancholy to his question that it was genuinely heartbreaking.\n\n“That’s because there are so many other Charlies in the world it’s impossible to say what a Charlie is supposed to look like,” the Professor said confidently as he sauntered into the lobby. “I on the other hand definitely look like a Lucretius Sterling, because no one else would ever dare to pull off such a preposterous-sounding name.”\n\n“Lots of people around here have preposterous-sounding names,” I reminded him. Unlike Charlie, Professor Sterling was a perfectly normal-looking person at first glance. He looked more than a little bit like David Tenant, truth be told. He was wearing a leather apron over a tweed waistcoat, a paisley tie, and a vintage, puffy-sleeved dress shirt. He also had a pair of black and gold goggles strapped to his forehead, nearly identical to the ones I’d seen Erich Thorne using on numerous occasions.\n\n“Oh, don’t be so hard on yourself. Alliterative names were perfectly respectable until Stan Lee got them associated with all his comic book nonsense,” he joked, I think. “That’s our pizza then, is it?”\n\n“From *Stygian’s Classic Pizzeria*, just like you wanted,” I said with a reticent sigh as I handed the boxes over to him. “But you know that’s not really why I came –”\n\n“Oh, bloody brilliant! Thank you!” he said as he opened the top box and eagerly grabbed a slice. “The staff at the front house are the only ones allowed to directly order and receive deliveries, and *Stygian’s* is on their blacklist for some reason. They think it’s a front for a paramilitary shadow cabal or some nonsense like that. They didn’t give you any trouble, did they? Erich called ahead, and I confirmed it, but sometimes that’s not even enough for them. It makes it so difficult to entertain company sometimes! Hmmm, please, take a slice while it’s still warm!”\n\n“Thank you,” I said as I politely accepted his offer. “Look, I didn’t mind picking up the pizza since it was on the way, but I’m not a delivery driver… anymore. I’m a paranormal anthropologist, which is why Erich and Ivy entrusted me with the artifact they want you to examine. Do you want it, or do you just want to tip me and send me on my way?”\n\n“Yes, yes, of course I want it,” he said, ripping off another bite of pizza. “Which, incidentally, is why I won’t be tipping you, just so that we’re clear. Charlie, get the door, won’t you? We don’t want any nosey neighbours peaking in on us, now do we?”\n\nCharlie diligently obeyed, gently pushing the door shut with a quiet creek, then turning the deadbolt shut.\n\n“I wish that lock wouldn’t click so ominously,” Charlie commented.\n\n“It’s a deadbolt; the very name is ominous. You want it to click in place with a pronounced sense of finality so that you know that you’ve barred the gates and the way is shut!” Lucretius rambled. “Plus, it’s mainly just the echo that makes it sound so foreboding. Everything echoes in this house. Echo! …Damn. I’m standing in the only bloody spot in the house with bad acoustics.”\n\n“You can set the pizza down in there, Ms. Romero,” Charlie said, extending his limp nerves in a gesture towards what looked to be the main living area.\n\n“Thank you, Charlie,” I said appreciatively as Lucretius did a few vocal warmups to test the acoustics of his own house. “I know it’s probably none of my business, but is Professor Sterling your… creator?”\n\n“No, just caretaker. My creator was… not nearly so affable,” he replied, his tone making it clear that the matter was a sore topic. Not wanting to upset him, I set the pizza boxes down on a coffee table and decided it was time to get on with business.\n\nReaching into my jacket and unzipping the inner pocket, I pulled out a small, metallic specimen box. I promptly handed it over to Lucretius, who accepted it with his free hand, his right hand adamantly refusing to forfeit the slice of pizza.\n\n“Heavy for its size,” he commented as he appreciated the box’s heft. Using only his thumb, he flipped open the lid to unveil the artifact I’d been sent to give him.\n\nInside was a small, spherical stone like a pearl or a marble. It was a clear bluish-green, beating with a soft pulse and shrouded with a nebulous aura. Inside was a small pupa of an insect that I had never seen and that neither Erich nor Ivy could identify, and it had some kind of elaborate sigil marked upon its back.\n\n“It’s Ichor,” Lucretius said softly, pulling down his goggles to examine it more closely, waving Charlie in to get a close look at it as well. “Crystalized, solidified Ichor; the vital fluid of a god incarnate. Haven’t a clue what the little guy inside it is, though. Where did Erich get this?”\n\n“He, Ivy, and Envy had a run-in with the Darling Twins the last time they were at Adderwood,” I answered.\n\n“What?” he asked, abruptly turning his attention away from the Ichor and towards me at the mention of the Darlings. Even Charlie seemed to recognize the name, his eyes shooting towards me as his pupils constricted to pinpricks. “Dear God, they didn’t steal this from them, did they?”\n\n“No, don’t worry. You’re not in any danger. They gave that up willingly,” I assured him. “I don’t know all the details, but from what I understand, Mary had some kind of an outburst, and afterwards she put that up as a peace offering. She said they had plenty of them and that we’d probably be able to make more sense out of it than they would.”\n\n“And did she say where they got it from?” Charlie asked.\n\n“Something about a Realtor. That’s all I know,” I said with a shrug.\n\n“Hmmm,” Lucretius murmured as he finally set the pizza down and fished out another pair of goggles from his apron pocket. “Do you know what these are, Ms. Romero?”\n\n“Yeah. Orville over at the *Oddity Outlet* calls them Opticons,” I replied.\n\n“No, Orville from *Orville’s Old-fashioned Oddity Outlet* calls them the Ophion Occult Order’s Omni-Ocular Opticons,” he reminded me. “He and that Circus he used to work for definitely had a hand in making alliteration seem silly. Anyway, put these on. Just be careful not to change the setting! These little beauties can show you some things that are best left unseen if you don’t watch yourself.”\n\nI nodded in understanding and pulled the goggles over my head. Everything immediately became monotone and desaturated, but bathed in vibrating, fractally branching emanations that quickly dissipated into their surroundings. If I focused on them, I realized that I had some kind of intuitive understanding of their meaning, like how you know what a pictogram is trying to communicate.\n\n“Trippy,” I said as I examined my right hand trailing through the air. “Is this clairvoyance?”\n\n“It’s as close as a non-clairvoyant can come to it, yes. Like an infrared image rendered into the visible spectrum,” Lucretius explained. “Now, look at the Ichor and tell me what you see, but look away the instant it becomes too much!”\n\nTurning all my attention to the little orb in the specimen box, I saw that its emanations were not only far denser and more complex, but had a harsh dissonance to them that clashed jarringly with everything else. It fundamentally didn’t belong in our world. Every particle of its being was burned by the fabric of our reality, and its every particle burned back in return. As I read deeper, I began to visualize what I was reading, visualizations that soon became so vivid I was completely lost in them.\n\nI saw a god become incarnate, manifesting himself into a colossal body of cold, alien flesh. I saw a head with a yawning and singular orifice, an orifice which I am compelled to describe as a god-shaped hole, a cyclopean sphere of holy light burning deep within it. A pair of fanged tentacles, flanked with prehensile tendrils and perforated with wheezing spiracles hung from his face down to his waist, and he was enshrouded with a medusa’s head of wriggling, semi-corporeal tentacles bursting out of his hunched back. He had seven spidery, clawed fingers split unevenly between each hand, and he stood upon a pair of theropod-like, digitigrade feet, with a semi-erect reptilian tail for balance.\n\nThe story I saw unfold was, at first, familiar. He was an angry god who had become disgusted with his own creation. Their decadence, their depravity, but worst of all was, of course, their hubris. His people had turned away from him, believing that not only did they no longer need their god, but that they no longer needed to fear him, either.\n\nAnd so, he descended down to their world to wipe them out. Maybe he would spare a handful of repentant followers to revive their race, or maybe he would start from scratch, or maybe not even that. He was so full of rage and hellbent on Armageddon, I don’t think he even had a clear plan for what came after.\n\nBut this is where the story diverged from an Old Testament-style parable. When the colossus appeared on the sprawling bismuthine badlands beneath a vortex of airborne quicksilver, his people were ready for him, having perfectly prophesized the precise instant and location of his manifestation. Made in his own image, I beheld ten thousand tentacled thaumaturges chanting dreadful incantations in perfect unison, resonating with one another to increase their power ten thousand-fold.\n\nOutraged further by their defiance and lack of repentance, the god howled a spell of instantaneous putrefaction at the magical army, only for it to be reflected back at him. The spell that was meant to lay waste to ten thousand wizards at ten thousand times their normal strength was still not enough to slay the god, but it was enough to leave him weakened and dazed. A thousand great ballistas of flawless spellcraft fired a thousand mighty spears of sanctified silver, each one hitting its target without fail. Each pierced a vein or artery, and the god’s Ichor gushed forth like a fountain. Each wound was still insignificant compared to the titanic scale of the thing, and once the god had regained his bearings, he charged forwards with the intent of simply flattening his apostates.\n\nHe managed only a single step before the ground gave way beneath his feet, and sunk waist-deep into the bismuthine soil like it was quicksand. The ballistas fired another volley, each spear succeeding in drawing out a little more Ichor.\n\nOn the rare occasions that the god had made himself incarnate to his people before, he would part with only a single ounce of his Ichor in exchange for a costly sacrifice. But there were millions of gallons of Ichor flowing in his veins, and now his followers meant to have it all.\n\nThe god brought down lightning from the quicksilver clouds to smote the infidels, but such a cliché tactic had been anticipated. The thunderbolts were drawn away by brazen lightning rods, which redirected the electrical discharges back towards the raging god. Another volley of spears penetrated his flesh, and now at last enough Ichor had been spilled to flow into the great spell circle that the thaumaturges had carved into the surrounding rock. The Ichor began to flow through the mote of its own accord, rendering the warding spell that the mages had been casting not only self-sustaining, but a thousand times stronger as well.\n\nAnd it only grew stronger the more Ichor flowed into it.\n\nThere was a perceptible shift in the morale of the heretics, as this marked a clear tipping point in their favour. Despite their alleged hubris, they had not truly been confident that their defence would be successful. It had been a Hail Mary at the most, and at the least, it was a way not to go quietly into that good night. The was a great sense of betrayal among them at their god’s decision to wipe them out, and they would neither apologize for nor forsake their civilization just because their god was jealous. Rather than grovel on their knees before him, they stood shoulder-to-shoulder with each other. Whatever flaws they had that their god had deemed so abominable, they also had a great ‘humanistic’ love for one another and a meritocratic pride in everything they had accomplished. They would defy god almighty, if only so that they could say they had not forsaken each other.\n\nNow they found themselves locked in mortal combat with their god, and they were winning.\n\nCries of ‘no gods, no masters!’ rang out across the battlefield. Another volley of spears was fired, another round of stolen lightning unleashed. The ground shook with the agonized tremors of the trapped god, and yet he could not break free. Several hundred of the boldest and most powerful thaumaturges apparated onto the hide of their god, their claws digging into his flesh and the fangs at the end of their facial tentacles impaling his veins and extracting the precious Ichor for themselves. Each time the god swatted at them, they just apparated again and appeared somewhere else, maddening him with frustration.\n\nWhile he was distracted, the thousands of other heretics flocked to the mote and lapped up their share of the Ichor, several pints each at least. Once they were empowered with the blood of their god, they began chanting a new incantation, one filled with self-righteous anger at the treachery of their creator. They slammed their tall sceptres into the ground, sending thunderous waves of sound through the soil, and luminescent beams of light through the air, each penetrating deep into the god’s flesh. As before, the more mages who joined in their ritual, the more powerful each became, ten thousand times ten thousand, and now ten thousand times again. They became stronger as their god grew weaker, and once the last drop of Ichor had been drained, they turned their heads skywards and converged all of their incorporeal tentacles into a single mammoth medusoid. It reached for an equally colossal scimitar forged by the Machine god, one of many cosmic weapons that littered the alien landscape from some long-ago Titanomachy, and pulled it free from the crystalline hill.\n\nHolding the scimitar aloft took all the warlock assembly’s might, and so with one final war cry, one final curse, they brought it down upon their god, impaling his heart and pinning him to the ground.\n\nThen the mummified, desiccated body of the god fell still and limp. The burning orb in his orifice exploded into a gentle snowfall of wisps, and everything went impossibly silent.\n\nAnd then; rapture.\n\nThe thaumaturges all broke out into unrestrained ecstasy, weeping in joy, howling with relief or screaming in triumph. They hugged, they danced, they fell to their knees, all grateful just to be alive as they tried to process the fact that they now had so much more than that to be grateful for. They had faced Armageddon, and achieved apotheosis. They had slain their god, and now his powers were theirs to do with as they pleased. Immortality was theirs, the cosmos was theirs, and there was no longer anything to stand in their way.\n\nGod was dead, and they had killed him; they had the corpse to prove it.\n\nI sat up with a sudden jolt as I was violently thrust back into reality. I had been laid out on a sofa by the fireplace, and sitting across from me were Lucretius and Charlie.\n\n“I said to look away when it got too much,” Lucretius reminded me in a stern tone as he poured tea from an antique tea set, a tea set that contrasted ludicrously next to the pizza boxes I had put on the coffee table. “How are you feeling?”\n\n“How am I feeling? If I had a nickel for every cyclopean cosmic entity I’ve come into contact with, I’d have two nickels; which isn’t a lot, but it’s still weird it’s happened twice!” I shouted facetiously, throwing myself back down onto the sofa and screaming into a cushion. “Tell me that wasn’t real!”\n\n“Oh, it was real, Ms. Romero. Ichor doesn’t lie,” Lucretius said as he pensively held up the orb and examined it once again. “The god you saw, this is his solidified Ichor. His people got it by murdering him, and the Darlings got it by murdering one of them.”\n\n“The Professor’s just speculating about that last part,” Charlie said as he passed me a cup of tea.\n\n“Bloody Hell I’m speculating! Everything the Darlings have they owe to coldblooded murder!” Lucretius objected. “If the Darlings have made themselves an enemy of the race that made this orb, we could have a very serious problem on our hands. The last thing we need right now is to draw the attention of a god-slaying race of thaumaturgical planeswalkers. Not that I can think there’d ever be a better time for that, mind you.”\n\n“Hold on. Hold on. What about that bug or whatever it is in the middle of the orb?” I asked as I reached for the cup and saucer that had been offered to me. “I didn’t see anything about that in my vision.”\n\n“Hmmm. Neither did I,” Lucretius nodded in agreement. “I suspect that’s a secret this little nugget won’t part with as easily, which is why Erich sent it over to me. Did he happen to mention if I’m authorized to conduct destructive testing?”\n\n“They both did. Ivy wants a full spectrum of tests run on that pupa. Do what you have to to get it out of there,” I replied.\n\n“Brilliant!” he beamed as he snapped the specimen container shut and stuck it into his apron pocket. “Thank you so much for bringing this over, Ms. Romero. Go ahead and help yourself to another slice of pizza, if you like.”\n\n“Pizza? How can you still be thinking about pizza after all that?” I asked in dismay.\n\n“*Stygian’s* is good pizza,” was his nonchalant reply. “It’s not every day that divine revelation and gourmet pizza are delivered together, and if we were meant to take any sort of moral from that cosmogony, I’m pretty sure it was that we shouldn’t let even the mightiest of gods keep us from the things we love most [about](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheVespersBell/) [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/) [world](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/).”",

        "text": "I am a man with many faces, and my mind is a battlefield. I hear the screams and cries of my own soul as it's torn apart by the war within me. Each of my personalities is fighting for control, and it's a constant battle for power. I never know which one of us will take over next.\n\nBut it wasn't always like this. There was a time when I thought I was in control of my own mind. I thought I was normal, like everyone else. But then, I started to hear the whispers. The whispers of my own past, the whispers of the person I used to be. And then, the screams started. The screams of my past, the screams of the person I used to be.\n\nI remember the first time I heard them. I was walking down the street, minding my own business, when I heard a scream. It was a bone-chilling scream, the kind of scream that makes your blood run cold. I turned around, but there was no one there. I thought I was going crazy. But then, I heard the scream again, and again, and again.\n\nThat was the first time I realized that something was wrong with me. That was the first time I realized that I was not alone in my own mind. That was the first time I realized that I was a prisoner in my own mind.\n\n**Listen, reader, do you hear that? The scream that echoes in my head? It's not just in my mind, it's in yours too. You can hear it, can't you?**\n\nI can hear the laughter of my past, and it's a sickening sound. It's the laughter of a monster that I have become. I used to think that I was in control, but now I know the truth. I am just a puppet, controlled by the voices in my head.\n\nI started to see the signs. The signs that I was not in control. The signs that I was not the person I thought I was. The signs that I was not alone in my own mind. I started to see the personalities, the different faces of myself, fighting for control. I started to see the fear in their eyes, the fear of losing control.\n\nAnd I started to feel the fear too. The fear that I was not in control, the fear that I was not the person I thought I was. The fear that I was losing my mind. The fear that I was becoming the monster that I used to be.\n\nThe fear consumes me, and I can feel myself losing control. The personalities are struggling for dominance, and I can hear their voices getting louder. I can hear the screams of my past, and I can feel the cold fingers of death reaching for me. I can feel the fear, the fear of the unknown, the fear of the things that lurk in the shadows of my mind.\n\n**You should be afraid, reader. You should be afraid of what you don't know, what lies hidden in the depths of your mind.**\n\nI started to investigate, to try to understand what was happening to me. I went to see a doctor, but they couldn't find anything wrong with me. I went to see a psychologist, but they couldn't help me. I started to feel hopeless, like there was no escape from the war in my mind.\n\nBut then, I had a breakthrough. I started to see patterns in the way the personalities took control. I started to understand what triggered them, what made them take over. And then, I started to take back control. I started to fight back, to reclaim my mind.\n\nIt wasn't easy, but I was determined. I was determined to find the truth, to find out what was happening to me. I was determined to break free from the grip of my own mind.\n\nAnd then, the day came when I discovered the truth. It was a truth that was both shocking and haunting. It was a truth that changed everything.\n\nI was not just one person, I was many. I was not just a man with multiple personalities, I was a man with many lives. I had lived many lives before this one, and each life was controlled by a different personality. Each personality was a different version of myself, each with its own memories and its own experiences.\n\nAnd then, I realized something even more terrifying. The person I used to be, the person I thought I was, was not real. He was just another personality, another version of myself, created to hide the truth from myself.\n\n**Don't you see, reader? The person you thought you were, is not real. You are just another personality, hiding the truth from yourself. You are just like me.**\n\nI heard the screams of my past lives, and I knew that I had to face the truth. I had to face the truth about who I was, and what I had become. I had to face the truth about the monster that I had become.\n\nI had to let go of the person I thought I was, and embrace the truth of who I truly was. And then, I finally found peace. I finally found control over my own mind.\n\nBut the truth still haunts me. The truth still makes me question who I truly am. And it haunts you too, reader. The truth still makes you question who you truly are.\n\n**You are not alone, reader. You are just like me. Together, we face the truth. Together, we face the fear.**\n\nThe fear still consumes me, and the screams still echo in my mind. But now, I am in control. I am the master of my own mind. And you can be too, reader. You can be the master of your own mind.\n\nBut be warned, reader. The truth can be a cruel and haunting thing. The truth can be the source of your greatest fears. But it can also be the source of your greatest peace.\n\nIt's up to you, reader. It's up to you to face the truth. It's up to you to face the fear.\n\nThe screams still echo, and the fear still consumes me. But now, I am in control. And so can you be.",

        "text": "\nThis was a conversation between two dominant people who we all know.\nThe content was caught on tape by a wire tap. It was inserted into the room that the conversation took place in. \n \n   The room is very small to make the setting intimate. One steel table welded to\nThe floor. Two steel chairs one welded one not.\nOne dim light in the middle of the table. Four walls painted dull grey no windows or outside light.\n\nThis  conversation reveals very important and sensitive information. \n\nPerson 1 is here blind folded from a maximum security facility. But will be unmasked when the conversation starts. \n\nPerson 2 is a part of the cause to help fight crime. This takes place in a undisclosed location deep underground. This has been pulled from the ears of the public for both parties protection. The contents on the tape goes as follows.\n\nPerson 1 : Finally were here me and you. I’ve waited for this moment for a long time.\nI can smell the rage, smell the hate and sense the pain. It’s euphoric to my senses.\n\n   (Threw a deep whisper) Person 2 : Stop playing games, you went threw all this trouble to get me down here. What the HELL do you want, you sick twisted maniac. \n\n(In a hearty laugh) \nPerson 1 : Always the big brave hero. I know what drives you, I know what makes you tick, I know why you cannot sleep. I know why you love the dark.\n\nPerson 2 reaches across the table and punches person 1 so hard you can hear bones crack on the recording.\n\n\nPerson 1 blows the blood from his nose and laughs and says :\n\nAwww that’s more like it. Blood bullets and wrath of GOD. Come on one more punch. This time Give me a Displaced jawline.\n\n\nPerson 2 : if you don’t stop wasting my time, I’m gonna \nRip out the top of your mouth and Snap your neck. \n\nPerson 1 : Yes Yes Yes the rage,  it’s only in the face of danger that we know who we truly are. \n\nPerson 2 brings his arm around the small table and punches his knee and dislocates it. The snap was loud, it was sick. Person 2 begins to breathe heavy and growl.\n\nPerson 1: Oooo that’s it, I love when you break the rules. See me and you aren’t so different. You love to inflict pain the same as I do. But I can admit it. See how excited you or now that you know I’m hurting. And the fact that it was you that caused it. Makes your heart rate go up makes your, blood boil, it takes you to a pain driven paradise.\n\n\nPerson 2 screams : WE OR NOT THE SAME. \n\nIn rage person 2 reaches out and grabs person 1’s arm with both hands and pops his shoulder out of place. Person 1’s arm is know dangling as he laughs and winches in pain.\n\n\nPerson 1 : The Dark Knight strikes again. A spoiled rich boy wit a pre-disposition for pain. They never found out who killed your parents did they.\n\n\nPerson 2 stares with intense eyes threw his mask. And says:\n\nStop telling me what I already know. Start making sense know.\n\n\nPerson 1 laughs while poking his now dangling arm with his finger\nAnd says :\n\nBruce I have cancer. I am set to die In six months. My whole crime career, I made crime a literal joke even pain is funny. But hear this, the night your parents where shot, You said the perpetrator had a slight limp in his left leg. The police report says they found white hairs at the crime scene.\n\n\nWell let’s examine, who do you know that has had white hair this whole time and has a slight limp if you pay attention close. \n\nPerson 2 : It can’t be no, Not\n\nPerson 1 : Your lovely Alfred.\n\nPerson 2  Vomits all over the table and his black suit. The room won’t stop spinning. His eyes or full of rage , blood shot he doesn’t want to believe it. \n\nPerson 1 continues : Alfred and your father were best friends but a women can cause wars. Alfred was engaged to your mother but\nYour father Mr. Wayne being the billionaire business man play boy, had to have here. Alfred wasn’t as nearly as rich as your father. So there was party at the Wayne mansion. Of course he gets Alfred to invite his wife. \n\n\nYour father flaunts his wealth in ways you wouldn’t believe. As the saying goes everyone has there price. \nHe woes her behind Alfred’s back. They begin sleeping with each other. Alfred was to busy and tired to realize his wife was weary of him. Between the long ours and heavy task your father gave him. \n\n\nSo he finally convinces here to leave him. Well your father promised Alfred a life long job with no risk of being fired with double his salary and know he can live at the mansion and have access to anything he wanted. Your mother left Alfred and married your father.\n\n\nPerson 2 : Get to the fucking point Asshole.\n\n\nPerson 1 : Awww patience O Dark One. So they got married within two months. But what old Mr. Wayne didn’t know was His new wife was three months pregnant. She hid it for as long as she could. But she was torn because around the time she conceived, even though Alfred was tired he would make love to his wife from time to time. Mr. Wayne would do it to. \n\n  So when she tells Mr. Wayne he loses it. He slaps her,roughs her up a little. Alfred heard the whole ordeal. Well He tries to take here to a abortion clinic by the time he does it’s to late. So when the baby comes, good old Mr. Wayne has an adoption crew on stand by. \nThey did a in home birth so no one knew but is home servants. \n\nAlso in the stages of her pregnancy when she started to Show. He hid her inside that mansion for 7 months. She didn’t even get to hold her baby. When she gave birth, Mr. Wayne had specific instructions for the doctor. He said take the baby wrap it up and give it to the adoption parents and see them off quickly. They didn’t even wash it off.\n\n Well  just so happen the adopting parents where teachers. But the parents were very abusive. They would starve the child. Beat him and put all kinds of unidentified pills in his food. \nIt made him laugh a lot. The lines between insanity and reality blurred. \n\nBruce this child followed you your whole life. When you where in grade school all the way threw. Know this is how we relate. After Mr. Wayne thought the smoke had cleared he made a son of his own. Alfred stayed by playing the part of a good servant and best friend to Mr. Wayne, all the time plotting his revenge. It took 12 years. \n\n\nHe finally found the right time. Your father thought he was untouchable, why would a billionaire who has shady dealings, walk his family through an alley late at night after a show. Instead of having the car pulled to the front. They would still be alive if your father wasn’t so prideful.\n\n\nSo Alfred waited till they left. Dress hisself as a street thug caught a cab and waited in that alley. The pistol he used was a six shooter. He sat in that dark alley for 2 hours waiting and when your family to came out he let you guys get half way and you know the rest.\n\n\nAlfred started putting medicine in your food to make you have Hallucinations. He knew you were afraid of the dark. Why do you think he never put lights on in that big mansion at night and made you sleep in the pitch black dark.  Do you know what that stuff does to a 12 year old mind. You start to build fantasy’s and see things that aren’t there. So the bats you saw when you fell in a hole and had to be hospitalized. Was actually caused by you slipping on a wet floor in that dark house and hitting your head on the edge of a big wooden table. \n\n\nSo know you think bats or apart of you. As far as the kid he grew up troubled. He was thrown in a insane asylum at 13 for killing his parents. For making him drink cleaning products to get him to sleep. But Mr. Wayne’s  wife some how tracked him down for a DNA test. She  used your fathers toothbrush and had the boy swabbed for his spit. When the results came back she couldn’t look.She just left the paper with the boy in the mental institution. \n\n\nPerson 1 takes his good arm reaches in his pocket and takes out a old dirty yellow paper. \n\nPerson 2 reads it and starts to cry.\n\n\nPerson 1 : I thought it would be a cold day in hell before I saw a big black bat cry.\n\n\nPerson 1 : Hello brother this is why we or the same we or alike. You can’t kill me because apart of you would die also and you can feel it.\nWe both or connected not only by blood but by pain.\n\n\nPerson 1: THIS IS A HEAVY CONVERSATION\n\nPerson 2 walks behind person 1 and puts his hands around persons one head and snaps his neck.\n\nPerson 2 tells the facility burn the body and any evidence that person 1 ever existed. \n\nPerson 2 goes back to his family mansion. Kills the butler and stuffs him in the furnace and burns the mansion down and disappears.\n\n\n6 month later we received a very disturbing letter from person 2.\n\nTo: whom it may concern\n\n\nMy life is a lie, I have nothing to live for or be proud of. My family fortune was stolen from honest hard working people. I fought in the dark, to shield the enjoyment on my face when I caused pain to criminals. inflicting pain and fear. I have exiled myself to a undisclosed location and after going back and viewing my life. It suddenly became uncontrollably funny. I cannot stop laughing.\n\nTHIS WAS A HEAVY CONVERSATION",

        "text": " \"*The way back home is southeast.*\"\n\nThe monotonous tone combined with the expressionless face of the innkeeper gave way to an almost indescribable feeling. One that's hard to place. Perhaps akin to the feeling you get when you're standing on the brink of a place you're never supposed to go. \n\nSurreal. That's what I was feeling.\n\n\"Come again?\" I asked, the wind whipped my face so hard the words felt like they were inaudible as they caught in my throat.\n\n\"*The way back home is southeast,*\" he repeated in the same robotic voice, unblinking.\n\nI cleared my eyes with my near-numb hands, to get a closer look at him. He was an older man, with swarthy dark skin and slicked back white-black peppered hair. He didn't look like he was from the area, given the tan of his sunkissed skin compared to the chill of the rural Oregon winter, but he had the look of a kindly grandfather, which made the prolonged, lifeless stare feel even stranger.\n\nHe never blinked at all. He was still as a statue, his right arm to his side and left arm holding the door knob. The stillness was inhuman.\n\n I shuddered involuntarily, most likely from the chill outside. \n\nSelf-consciously, I looked down at my clothing to see if some thrifted item I was wearing invoked the response he was giving. Maybe he was quoting a reference to some old sitcom I had never seen that was somehow related to my hoodie. But when I looked down, I was just wearing some jeans and a ratty *Salem Red Sox* hoodie that was three sizes too big for me.\n\n*Did I look like I was a homeless guy from Salem or something?*\n\nI composed myself.\n\n\"Hey sorry, if I came off the wrong way. I was just wondering if I could get a room for tonight. I'm from Atlanta. I'm traveling up to Alas--\"\n\nMy off-beat ramble was cut short by the heavy door slamming in my face. The volume and complete abruptness of it made me jump back, and I almost tripped on the icy steps below in the process. But I quickly regained my composure. \n\n*The fuck.*\n\nI started walking back to where I came from; thouroughly confused, and even colder than I was before. The hair on the back of my neck stood up too, probably from the freezing air around me.\n\nI trudged down the dark road, the one I took from my rental car to the strange little Inn. The dimlit was surrounded by thick groves of pine trees taller than most houses; really signifying that I was in the middle of nowhere. \n\nThe entire walk back, I replayed the short \"conversation\" in my head, trying to find some explanation for the man's behavior.  Although it was strange, I eventually came to the conclusion that he must have been drunk or high on something. I mean, who could blame him? I would've drunk too if I were forced to run a lonely hotel in the middle of nowhere for a living--especially in a winter like that.\n\nAt some point, after what seemed like hours of walking, I saw the dull-gleam of my red Subaru glint off my phone's flashlight which was illuminating my trek. I unlocked the car and got in, shivering many for minutes, even long after the heat started running.\n\n I contemplated driving down the road awhile longer. Now that I knew the Inn wasn't an option, I wasn't held back by sleeping locations. But after some deliberation, I decided that where I parked was as good a place as any to get some rest.\n\n*At least I'm not gonna freeze* I thought *but still, damn everything.*\n\nFortunately, the car I rented was pretty nice for sleeping in, at least as far as cars went. Although, I will admit, a real bed sure would've been nice in the rapidly dropping 15-degree weather. \n\nMy flight to Fairbanks, Alaska was already scheduled at 5:00 pm sharp the next day, so driving farther away to find another Inn was practically a non-question. Even if there were any remotely close.\n\nI sighed as I reluctantly reclined my seat back until I was almost parallel to the floor. My back hurt, and I silently cursed whatever drug was making me wake up to sores for the second night in a row instead of a warm white sheet and pillows. Whatever it was, I vowed to myself that I would never take it.\n\nThe soft light of the car illuminated the surrounding area pretty well, but it was not bright enough to obscure the dazzling stars overhead, whcih I looked at through my sunroof window. I admired the beauty of it for a few moments, watching the view slowly get covered up by snowflakes piling up on it. The soft pitter-patter of the snow falling, and the quiet ambiance of the surrounding woods eventually lulled me into a short-lived, but deep and peaceful sleep.\n\n.\n\nWhat seemed like mere minutes later, I was loudly awoken by the screeching, the crashing of some vehicle outside. Startled, I quickly jumped up. \n\nIt sounded like it came from the front of my car. I squinted hard and scanned outside the windshield for the cause of the noise. But it was pitch-black, and my half-asleep brain couldn't make out anything beside softly falling white snow.\n\nI attempted to adjust my eyes to the darkness, but the car was too bright; it was like staring outside into a forest after sitting near a campfire for too long. I quickly turned off my engine, and with it, the lights.\n\nMoments later, after several seconds of squinting and scanning, I could faintly make out something far ahead, to the left of the road. It was a blue blob, a car, I assumed, that was half on the road, and half buried in a cluster of pine trees off of it. A wreck.\n\n*My God.*\n\nWith bated breath, I frantically switched my car back on, and drove the distance between me and the wreckage, but slowly. The ice had grown thicker since I fell asleep, and I didn't want to meet the same fate as the car ahead of me.\n\n As I got closer, I  quickly came to realize the severity of the crash. The car, some kind of off-road vehicle, was almost completely obliterated in the front. Everything up to the frontdoor looked like it had been crushed by a hydraulic press, folded like an pancake. It was a horrible wreck, but I still had baseless hope that whoever in it survived.\n\nAs I pulled within twenty feet of it, I still couldn't make out a body. The windows were heavily tinted, and the car was a foot and a half off the ground, making the angle nearly impossible to see if a someone was slumped over inside.\n\nI turned off my engine and hopped out of my car. I knew I had to be quick. I'd heard horror stories in the past of cases where people in car wrecks, who typically would have lived, died from the surrounding people now knowing how to perform CPR.\n\n*Do I even remember how to do CPR?*\n\nAs my door flung open, the absolute chill  instantly hit me.  it was probably well into the negatives at that point. I shivered uncontrollably as I pushed through toward the wreck.\n\n\"HELLO?\" I shouted against the cold as I got within a few feet. \"ARE YOU ALRIGHT?\"\n\nWhen no answer came, I stopped.\n\nDespite the dire situation--the pressing needs of whoever might be in the car, I couldn't bring myself to get closer. Something I can't begin to describe had hit me. Something just felt *off* about the whole scene. The wreck, the dark road, the still and silent forest surrounding it. \n\nSomething I couldn't quite place made me want to run back to my car and leave this for someone else to stumble upon. But I couldn't just leave someone here, potentially dying without any help.\n\n*You're selfish--and a bad person to boot, Marcus* I told myself *just open the damn car door and find out what the hell is going on, then you can leave.*\n\nMustering my remaining reserves of willpower, I marched up to the front of the car and attempted to open the door. \n\nThe latch was colder then I expected. Much colder.\n\nOpening the door was much harder than I expected, something must have been jammed in it--despite the fact that the door was relatively untouched by the wreck. \n\nExerting all my force, I swung the damn thing open.\n\nThe first and only thing I saw was a body. Lying in the front seat was a young woman with pale skin and brown hair, maybe 20ish. She was slumped over on the now inflated airbag, completely unconscious. I rubbed my hands until I could feel them again, then rapidly checked her pulse. \n\nI breathed a huge sigh of relief when I found out she was alive.\n\nAfter rubbing my arms together to stave off the piercing cold, I pulled out my phone to call 911. But there were no bars. No service at all, even for emergency calls, which shouldn't have surprised me, given where I was.\n\nLooking back at the slumped over girl, I cursed under my breath, realizing that I was gonna have to carry her to my car and then drive her to a hospital, or some kind of civilization with reception, at least. \n\nI looked back at my car, estimating the distance I would have to carry her when suddenly, I heard quiet movement behind me. \n\nI whipped around, not processing what I was seeing for a moment. \n\nThe girl's pale, motionless face was now mere inches from mine. She was standing in the snow, right in front of me, in bare fee. The suddenness and speed at which she was able to get out of her seat, after being unconscious, then stand on the road *in front of me* made me jump back in a mixture of surprise and fear.\n\n\"What in the hell-\" I began.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" She asked in a dazed voice. Her tone was so even that it didn't even sound like a question, more like a command.\n\n\"I don't understand-\"\n\n\"Where are you going?\" She repeated, motionless.\n\n\"That's not important, you were just in a fucking wreck lady.\" Something in her voice made me answer her, though. \"I'm heading up to Alaska, I can give you a ride to a--\"\n\n\"*The way back home is southeast.*\" She cut me off, repeating the exact same lifeless mantra as the innkeeper.\n\nMy blood completely drained. I knew, at that moment, I wasn't dealing with some ordinary wreck. And this time, instinct won.\n\nI turned back around like lightning and took off in the opposite direction of the girl, towards my car, running faster than I had ever run in my entire life. I'm pretty sure more adrenaline pumped through my veins than blood did.\n\nWithin seconds of my feet pounding across the ice-laden road, I reached my car door.\n\nI jumped inside, fear taking over me as I fumbled with the keys for a second before igniting the engine. I jerked my car into reverse, not checking to see if the girl was following me. I manage to spin my car around, barely missing the surrounding grove of trees, before speeding off 40 MPH faster than the speed limit to get the hell away from whatever just happened.\n\nI didn't think or breathe much the entire drive. I have no idea how long it was. All I could remember was the swishing of my window wipers fighting the wind and snow, as I gripped the steering wheel with white knuckles and tried to comprehend what the hell was happening to me.\n\nEventually, I sw lights ahead of me on the road. A sign ahead told me I had made it to a small town of about 300 people. Isped through it, and quickly found the small police station, which I breathlessly banged on until an officer let me in; ignoring the extreme cold I was constantly feeling outside.\n\nThe conversation I had with the police was a blur. He was obviously annoyed at having to file out paperwork at 3 am, right before his shift ended, and I don't think he exactly believed my story, either, but he was obligated to listen.\n\nI probably rambled for over thirty minutes to him, detailing the whole night, even the strange things that happened to me that I wasn't completely sure were related. But I told them anyway.\n\nThe whole account I gave was longer then necessary, but I needed him to know I was telling the truth by going over every detail of the night. There was still a car out there that had crashed, which had to count for something for the police.\n\n*But the thing that made my blood run cold, the reason I'm spending the time to write this to you all as I sit in my car, far away from that God-forsaken area, was what the police officer said to me after my testimony concluded.*\n\n\"Where are you from again?\" The officer asked, getting up from his seat with a slight groan.\n\nSomething started churning inside me, I wasn't sure why. It was a pretty standard question as far a I was aware.\n\n\"I'm from Atlanta, but I'm making my way to Alaska for--\"\n\nHis expression went totally dead, and his head locked with mine, and dread filled me beyond anything I had ever felt before.\n\n\"*The way back home is southeast.*\" he said.",

        "text": "\\[[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zi266u/i_own_a_restaurant_that_caters_for_unusual_clients)\\]\n\nThe hour was late, and a blanket of silence had fallen over the restaurant. Elsewhere in the city, the nightlife continued in all manner of bars and clubs, but here the din of cutlery and plates and late-night conversation had ended, and I was left to clean up.\n\nThe room was dark, but a candle burned with a flickering golden glow on a nearby window sill. The fumes of a faintly lemon-scented cleaning solution hung heavy in the air, and the calm chords of a piano trickled quietly from speakers overhead. They were my only companions as I worked. That suited me just fine. I'd sent my employees home early for this exact reason; I needed some time to think.\n\nI wiped down the final table and pushed it up against the wall with the rest. As I did, I took the opportunity to peek out the window at the silver VW Tiguan parked across the road. It had been sat out there all day, and though the lights were off, I swore I’d seen movement from inside once or twice.\n\nI withdrew from the window, my breath coming a little shallower than before. I’d been confident I’d be able to handle the Rat Trappers if they arrived, but as time went on I'd found myself less and less sure. After all, if Ashton was right, they were far more capable now than before. Over the past few days, I'd been able to think of little else, and I worried my paranoia was getting out of hand. I forced myself to calm down. I was overthinking this. A parked car wasn’t a sign of anything. I took a deep breath and took one final glance out the window.\n\nThe door to the Tiguan opened, and a figure stepped out.\n\nThe figure closed the door, unhurried, and turned to face the restaurant. I found myself frozen in place. My heart stopped as I saw their gaze linger a moment on the window I was looking through. They paused, hidden in shadow, and began walking towards the entrance.\n\nMy heart leapt into my throat, and I tore towards the front desk, diving behind it as the figure approached. I fumbled beneath the desk, my clammy hands failing to grip the shotgun taped to its underside. My breath came ragged, the air catching on my dry throat painfully. I blinked beads of sweat from my eyes and spared a frantic look at the front entrance.\n\nThe figure had reached the doors, and their face was bathed in the glow of a street light. Their grey eyes met mine, and I realised to whom they belonged. My pulse didn’t slow at the revelation - in fact, it may even have quickened - but I left the gun in its place. This wasn’t a Trapper; it was a customer.\n\nColette Boulier threw the doors open and stepped inside. She tossed her silver hair back and made for the front desk, not breaking eye contact for a moment. Colette was tall, with a striking glare and a casual grace. Other than that, she looked completely different to when I’d last seen her. My stomach turned. She’d done it again.\n\n“Ms-Ms Boulier!” I stammered, trying and failing to hide my nerves behind a smile, \"My apologies! I didn’t recognise you.\" Colette smiled humourlessly.\n\n“Good evening, Monsieur. Do not worry. It is no problem,” Colette tapped her cheek with a slender finger, “The look is new. Early-morning jogger, yesterday. The skin fits well.”\n\nIt was true. Colette’s skin usually had a slightly puffy quality, but this set fit like a glove. I only hoped it might convince her to wait longer before the next one.\n\n“I-Indeed,” I said. “Ms Boulier, you know my services are always available if you find yourself in need of… a new look.” I hoped Colette would take the hint. I was already driving myself mad looking out for the Rat Trappers; the last thing I needed was a police investigation nearby.\n\nColette wrinkled her nose. “Agh! I tried your services once. That freezer of yours, it dries the skin too much. It does not fit.” She glided past me, “I presume we are safe to remain upstairs? You do not appear to have many customers.”\n\n“The speciality drinks are all downstairs, Madame,” I reminded her, but Colette pulled out a table and chairs and sat regardless.\n\n“I do not need speciality, Monsieur. I just wish to talk. Your regular bar assortment shall suffice.”\n\nNot a little confused, I selected a bottle of Grenache from behind the upstairs bar and joined her at the table. I poured us each a glass, and Collette drank deeply. She gave a slight nod in place of thanks and levelled her eyes at me, setting her hands on the table. Beyond her gracious appearance, I caught in those eyes a glimpse of the scruffy serial killer who’d darkened my doorway all those years before.\n\n“I am grateful for your hospitality, monsieur. These are difficult times, as I am sure you are aware. I know your remaining open is a comfort to many of our kind.”\n\nI took a slow sip of wine, my unease lessening a little. That was about the closest thing to a compliment of which Collette was capable. She was in a good mood. I smiled modestly.\n\n“I’m glad to hear of it. Business still isn’t the same as before this Trapper situation started, but I’m sure before long this place will be as busy as ever.”\n\n“You are not afraid?” Colette mused, raising an eyebrow. “The Trappers are no joke anymore. Have you not heard about Dalton?”\n\n“You know I’ve heard about Dalton,” I replied coolly.\n\nI would normally never talk to a customer like that, much less Colette, but something about her tone irked me. It was like she thought she was above it all, and not, in all likelihood, at the top of the Rat Trappers’ hit list. Collette’s gaze hardened, and she spoke with a deliberately measured tone.\n\n“Indeed. I suspect a great many people know. I suspect a great many people know quite a lot more than they should.\" She cocked her head. \"I never thought our existence would remain a secret forever, but you were far from the one I expected to start blabbing.”\n\nColette took her glass in one hand, swirled its contents for a moment, and then downed it. She set the glass back upon the table, then knocked it off with a swift backhand. It smashed against the nearest wall in a delicate tinkle of glass.\n\nI didn't say anything, fearing I’d lose more than a glass if I did. Many of my clients are boorish, violent, or damn-near murderous, but I can control them. I'm the keeper of their haven, and that's a position of power. Colette was a different case. I knew she wouldn’t hesitate to shred me to pieces if I upset her, and it seemed I was already proving an annoyance.\n\n“Madame Boulier. I understand my decision may seem unwise,\" I chose my words carefully, \"You’re certainly not the first to tell me so. But please understand, I carefully considered the risks. My message contained no identifying information. No dates, no places, no names the Trappers didn’t already know. It gave nothing away, and it scared them off for a while. What’s the harm?”\n\nA pulse of air tore through Colette’s throat, then another. Then another. At first, I thought she might be choking, but I soon realised she was chuckling to herself.\n\n“Wrong on both accounts, monsieur. You may have given little to the Trappers, but what about the others? Your little message is publicly available, is it not? Any one of those cattle could stumble across it as they graze their feed. Did you not think of that?”\n\nI shrugged.\n\n“It’s the internet. Everyone believes and disbelieves everything they read. It’ll blend right in with the rest.”\n\nColette twirled a finger across the table, only half-listening to me.\n\n“My, my, monsieur. You really have thought of everything, haven’t you?”\n\nShe stood, bearing over me with towering grace. Slinking over to the front desk, she took two new glasses from the back shelf. I didn’t object, worried I would be signing my own death warrant if I did, but noted that the glasses Colette chose weren't meant to be used. They were old and dusty, part of the first set I'd bought after opening the restaurant. They’d been through a lot, and were now chipped in half a dozen places, so I’d left them to enjoy their retirement at the front desk as mementoes. It seemed they were coming out of retirement though, fittingly at the same time I might be entering a permanent retirement of my own.\n\nTurning her back to me, Colette made for the bar and selected a bottle of Smirnoff, a dash from which she emptied into the two glasses. She then drew a small metal hip flask from her coat and drizzled an unknown tonic into one. The mixture fizzed as it hit the surface of the Smirnoff, refracted into a million pieces through a chip in the side of the glass. Colette caught me watching and snapped the flask shut in a flash, hiding it back in her coat pocket.\n\n\"Something to take a little more edge off,\" she commented dryly, \"A need I can thank you for, Monsieur.\"\n\nColette set the second round of drinks down, gliding back into her seat. A sculpted nail tapped the side of her glass. I kept my eyes on it, not wanting to meet hers.\n\n\"Do you know your problem, Monsieur? I do. It is one I do not deny possessing myself, though I certainly handle it better. Pride. You think yourself so clever that you can taunt those who would see you dead and see no consequences. You think you can expose us, and that we will go quietly along with it. It will catch up with you, this pride. One day. Perhaps not so far away.\"\n\nI listened with rapt attention, keeping my eyes on Colette's metronomic tapping. Her words were not spoken with anger, or even especial annoyance, but I felt the subtle acid laced between them. My mind raced, praying I could still salvage the situation, when something caught my eye. Colette's glass.\n\nMy mouth, already dry, was reduced to sandpaper, my saliva recoiling in terror. My eyes darted across the surface of her glass, hoping, praying I was wrong. I wasn't. Her glass was unblemished. Not a fingerprint on it. Nor a hint of lipstick. Nor a chip through which I'd seen Colette add an unknown substance to one of the drinks. I slowly traced a finger over the edge of my glass, and felt the rough texture of the chipped surface. My breath caught in my throat, and the night's events played out in montage in my head. The Tiguan parked outside. Colette rushing to hide the hip flask from view. Something she'd said earlier: *Wrong on both accounts, monsieur.* The Rat Trappers hadn't been scared off. They'd just been smart enough to recruit someone on the inside.\n\nMy mind swam with realisation, and my wild eyes met Colette's. My horrified expression immediately gave me away, and I saw her composure shift, her own eyes widening for the first time since I'd met her. Her hand dove into her coat pocket, but I didn't give her the chance to find whatever it was she planned to kill me with.\n\nI leapt from the table, throwing my chair back and grabbing my glass in one motion. With a mad speed possible only in life-or-death situations, I hurled the glass - as well as whatever was in it - into Colette's face.\n\nHer screams were hideous.\n\nA banshee's howl erupted from the monster opposite me, her hands racing to cover her face. I saw smoke rising from beneath her fingers, and could only imagine what I'd come so close to drinking. I wasted no more time, and bolted for the front desk. I heard Colette fly from her chair, a mass of screaming rage barrelling after me, but I refused to look back. My feet pounded against the thin carpet. Only a few more metres. Only a few more seconds and the gun would be in my grasp.\n\nA clawed hand bit into my ankle.\n\nI screamed as Colette dragged me to the floor, blood running from my leg in a steady stream. I hit the ground hard, and rolled over, fighting to regain my breath and get the creature off me. I finally saw Colette's face, and had to fight not to scream again.\n\nThe poison had burned right through Colette's fresh layer of skin - exposing the countless other skins still present underneath. The first few layers were translucent and crisp, encasing her head in a crinkled mass reminiscent of spider webs. Below that, the decay had set in. slabs of congealed skin, grey and diseased, peeked through the gaps in the spider web, gristly and gleaming with an unknown fluid. Her screams whistled through the countless cracks in her face, which even now was shedding great pale flakes as we fought. I managed to get my feet under her and pushed her off me with surprisingly little effort, as if she were a paper doll. As I felt how light she was, it dawned on me how wrong we all were about Colette. I and the other patrons had always assumed she was some kind of skinwalker. In truth, she was skin all the way down.\n\nSeizing the opportunity, I rose shakily to my feet, tumbling over the desk and grabbing the barrel of the gun. I tore it free from the tape binding it to the table just as Colette scrambled to her feet and tore over the desk towards me. I turned the shotgun on the disgusting creature and fired just as it was about to sink its claws into me.\n\nA few dozen puffs of skin erupted across Colette's chest, the old layers bursting out like straw from a torn scarecrow, and she was thrown to the floor. She tried to get back up, but I didn't let her. I unloaded shot upon shot upon shot into Colette's body until I was out of ammunition, by which point much of her body had burst open, revealing insides that looked like a mass of tissue paper. Skin covered the floor like new-fallen snow, and yet the chest of the monstrous thing on the floor continued to rise and fall with wheezing, shuddering breath.\n\nI collapsed against the bar, my own breath barely coming easier. I couldn’t act. I couldn’t think. The adrenaline had guided me to the gun, but now I had no idea what to do. I gripped the gun so hard my knuckles shone white, never taking my eyes off Colette. As we sat there, her breathing began to slow. At first, I thought I was imagining it, but soon it was impossible to deny. Colette’s breaths grew more and more laboured, each one a shuddering performance that sent yet more of her body scattering to the floor around her. Soon, she gave one last gasp, and was silent.\n\nI didn’t dare move for a few moments, but eventually I forced myself to my feet. Somebody would have heard the gunshots. The police were likely already on their way. A story of a faulty alarm system and late-night nerves would have to suffice, but only if Colette was hidden.\n\nI shuffled slowly over to Colette, peering down at her still form. A single eyelid somehow remained intact despite the poison and the shots; its smooth, delicate appearance a reminder of the beauty that had once disguised this face.\n\nIt twitched, and the eye opened.\n\nI stared, horrified, for a moment too long.\n\nColette hissed, and pounced, colliding with me. I vainly tried to bat her with the empty shotgun, but Colette deftly twisted around me, wrapping what was left of her legs around my waist and securing herself to my back. I tried to buck her off, but without her weight working against her she managed to  cling on, reaching around my neck and beginning to strangle me. Her grip wasn’t strong, but it was enough. I uselessly clawed at the arm around my throat, tearing away flakes but doing nothing to weaken Colette’s hold. My mind swam for the second time that evening as my brain was denied oxygen, and I struggled to maintain my footing. Desperation rose inside me, and I raged against Colette, but I just couldn’t dislodge her. She cackled breathlessly as I slowly weakened, whispering in my ear in a rasping, hateful voice.\n\n“Pride, pride, *pride*! You think you can do this to me? Take it away from me? You are wrong monsieur, wrong! I will get it back. The Trappers say to me. They say I can have fresh skin often. Just have to do a little job for them first!”\n\nI swayed, my vision blurring. She was right. Did I really think I would be able to beat a monster like Colette? Even now, with most of her body gone, she was going to kill me. Even with her most of her scattered on the floor like so much tissue paper.\n\n*Tissue paper*… *tissue paper*… *tissue*\\-\n\nPaper.\n\nA ghost of an idea came to life in my head, and with the last of my strength, I began staggering to the window where I’d first seen Colette leave the Tiguan. Colette didn’t try to stop me; why would she? Each step was slow as I walked. Each moment was agonising. Each second the throbbing in my head grew more painful. Yet eventually we reached the window, Colette’s choking laugh still bouncing off the walls. My head was pounding. My vision began to blur.\n\nThe world outside the window was pitch black, only a few metres illuminated by the candle still burning on the window sill. I turned to it. Colette realised what I was about to do a moment too late. She tried to let go, a scream gurgling up in her throat. It never reached completion. Mere moments before I would've fallen unconscious, I turned and collapsed into the candle, the flame striking Colette on the small of her back. The dry skin of her insides was ideal kindling, and I was hit with a wave of heat as she went up almost immediately.\n\nColette screamed louder than ever before as the flames consumed her, and she went down. I managed to get away from her as she burned. She rolled about on the floor in a desperate attempt to smother the fire, but the monstrous torch only grew brighter, her screams steadily rising in pitch until her throat burned away, suddenly silencing her. With no more fuel to sustain them, the flames died quickly, luckily without spreading. Soon, a patch of burnt carpet was all that was left of Colette Boulier.\n\nI stumbled to my feet, the feeling slowly returning to my extremities as oxygen flooded my brain. Putting a hand on the window sill to steady myself, I looked out over the restaurant, its floor still covered with bits of Colette. A small smile spread across my face. My work wasn't done. The police would still be on their way. Colette would have to be swept up and disposed of, and my half-cocked excuse would have to be used. Yet I had won. The Trappers had come for me, had sent one of the country's most prolific serial killers after me, and had failed. Retrieving a broom from the cupboard in the back, I set about removing any trace of my latest customer. This wouldn't be the end, of that I was sure. The Trappers would doubtlessly send somebody else after me. They had chosen a war, after all. A small thought occurred to me though, as the last of Colette was swept into a black refuse bag, and my smile grew into a grin.\n\n*I might just be able to win it.*",

        "text": " The following accounts were found in the back of an old rusted 1992 Toyota pickup truck. Inside the truck was an old yellow notepad. This is what it contained. \n\nThe winter had taken a toll on business. Like it always does. Landscaping is pretty much dead in the winter here in Arizona. \n\nA wave of loneliness washed over my home. \n\nI stare outside my window, and all I see is the oak tree’s branches dancing along with the wind, rocking back and forth. \n\nOn the dinner table sits a cold cup of coffee. Folgers. Black. I like the cheap stuff. Plus, during this time of year, I get to practice on my frugality skills.\n\nI got an email notification from Google my business on my iPhone.\n\nThe quote request said the following from Charles Raskin:\n\nI need a quote ASAP, we are out of town for the holidays, and the neighbors informed us of a broken pipe that is leaking into their backyard. We forgot to turn off the sprinkler system before we left. Please respond quickly.\n\n\\- Charles\n\nThe quote lead contained the following information: \n\nName: Charles Raskin\n\nEmail: C\\_Raskin1930@hotmail.com\n\nAnd the phone number\n\nI jumped on it immediately, I texted Joe, I preferred texting since I was always awkward on the phone, plus everyone prefers texting now. \n\nI texted the following:\n\nHey Joe! Oscar here from 88th St Lawncare I got your quote via google. Following up to see if we can visit the property and identify the issue with the broken pipe.\n\nCharles responded:\n\nOscar!! thanks for the speedy response, here is my address: 8882 Song Sparrow Way in Sedona.\n\nI replied:\n\nOK, I will be there around 2:00 PM. I am assuming there’s no dogs in the backyard?\n\nCharles replied:\n\nThank you very much!!!! The code to the backyard gate is 1217#. Please leave the backyard locked.\n\nI started to load up the old, work truck with my tools. Shovels, rakes, and pickaxes haven’t been touched, since the end of the season back in fall. A little bit of rust covered them, but not enough for anyone to notice .. but me.\n\nIt felt good doing something with my day. At this time of year, my days usually consists of  watching old westerns and tinkering with old lawn mowers in my garage. Mowers I find free on craigslist or on the side of the road. \n\nIt felt good firing up my work truck, Johnny Cash playing on the radio, and the mood felt right. It felt like a workday. The best kind of days.\n\nThe woodsy air from the trees always made me feel like I was in tuned with mother nature. I was able to think clearly. I loved the outdoors this is why I choose this line of work.\n\nI arrived at the property around 1:45 PM. Overgrown rose bushes and tall grass filled with weeds started back at me. The urge to want to just clean it all up and leave it looking tidy gnawed at me. \n\nFocus, Oscar, I told myself. I made my way to the backyard, punched the code on the keypad of the gate and voila the key popped out on the back part of the keypad. It was one of those fancy new gate locks, I had seen them before at some of properties I serviced in gated communities. \n\nI took my pack of Newport’s out of the main front pocket of my Carhartt Bibs and took a drag from my last cigarette. Irrigation work and cigarettes were a good combination kind of like coffee and donuts.\n\nA typical breakfast of mine consisted of a cup of coffee and a cigarette. Gas station coffee hits different in the morning a blue-collar worker.  \n\nThe backyard was your typical suburban backyard.  All the properties in this suburb were the same cookie cutter models. The lawn was a medium sized overgrown lawn with some dead bushes, and an orange tree full of oranges. \n\nThe *tree, dappled shade and warmth – with oranges ready to be munched.*\n\nI opened to valves to identify the leak of the pipes. I turn the valves clockwise. \\*hiss\\*..\n\nBam! I saw the fucking leak; it wasn’t a pipe it was a riser from one of the sprinklers that busted.\n\nI took a picture of the broken riser, and texted Joe.\n\nHey Joe, looks like we got a broken riser. I can replace it with a new one. It’ll be $85 with materials. Once the job is done you can Venmo or Zelle.\n\nGreat! Get it done said Charles \n\nI started digging and that’s when it all started. This fucking carousel of confusion. The moment I knew that my life as I knew it had changed. Like an awakening. A FUCKING AWAEKING.\n\nIt all started when the shovel opened the earth, and I started working. \n\nWhat was supposed to be a 20-minute job turned into complete chaos.\n\nAs I was digging towards the riser. I noticed something else in the dirt. Then I knew something was off. You see a year ago I had lost my keys. My keys consisted of the following items: a keychain of a small rubix cube, a cheap multitool from China, and a mini flashlight.\n\nIt felt like Daija vu.\n\nI put the keys in my pocket, and I sat there for about 10 minutes just wondering how the fuck my keys could end up there. Was my mind playing tricks on me.    \n\nCuriosity got the best of me, so I started digging. Something kept telling to dig.\n\nThe next thing I found was an old game boy color I lost when I was kid. How did I know it was mine? Well you see, the back case where the batteries go had an old faded Super Mario sticker I placed there when I was a little kid. I remember getting that sticker for my cousins’ birthday.\n\nThis felt wrong, I felt weird. I felt unnatural; however, a weird part of me wanted to keep on digging. What I found next screwed me up in so many ways. I felt like my mind was breaking. Kind of like a static TV with no reception. You smack the TV a few times, and you get signal.\n\nBut my case was different.\n\nI dug a little bit more, and I found the cadaver of my dog that went missing when I was 14. The cadaver of my dog looked fresh. Cisco was a good dog. A pit mix with something else. Cisco found us. One day he shows up to the front door and puts his paw out. We have no idea where he came from, we asked neighbors, called shelters, the whole 9 yards. Nobody knew anything about him. So we kept him. \n\nHe went missing one day after the stormy season from broken fence picket that led to the street from my backyard. My knees hit the ground and I cried. I realized Cisco was the only true friend I ever had. We were bonded together, and he always protected me from bullies, and creeps. \n\nCisco once saved me from getting kidnapped.\n\nAs Cisco and I walked from the park one evening. A white ice cream truck pulls up next to us. \n\nAn older Hispanic in his 60’s grinned towards us. He carried himself with his busted-up smile and senile energy. An old diamondbacks baseball cap covered his face, he wore a grey hoodie with holes in it that read *MOJAVE DESSERT*, black faded jeans and old white nike sneakers that had turned yellow over time. Air force 1’s I believe. \n\nOut of nowhere his friend jumps me from behind and tries to put me into the man. I couldn’t remember how his friend looked all I remember was he was short and stocky. Built like a tree trunk. I wanted to scream but I couldn’t. His dirty oily hands covered my mouth.\n\nI was almost in the van and taken to god knows where; however, Cisco came to the rescue. Cisco goes straight for the guy’s leg, and his jaw locks in on the guy. Cisco is not letting go. Cisco is shaking this creep’s leg ferociously and violently back and forth. \n\nAfter what felt like a few minutes the dude finally breaks through.\n\nThe kidnappers manage to get away. And speed off after the entire neighborhood came out. \n\nIt was common in this area. Human trafficking was real, and it was unforgiving. Any kid in the area was target. Many kids went missing. Never found. Families mourning for years never getting closure.\n\nMy stomach twisted, my head spinning. My breathing was getting shallow. I felt like I was going to puke. I’M I GOING CRAZY?! I said to myself. \n\nI dug from the next few hours with tears rolling down my cheek. I found more and more missing toys, collectibles, and random things I lost throughout my life. \n\nThe time was now 4:30 PM. It started to get dark. \n\nI grabbed a bucket and put all my old shit in it. I held his dead body for a while and thanked him for everything.  I buried Cisco in my backyard and held a little memorial for him. I texted Joe telling him the problem was fixed. \n\nJoe replied: Thanks Oscar I just Venmo’d you I gave you a little extra for coming in such short notice. Please lock the gate. Thanks!\n\nI texted Joe back.\n\nHey Joe, your lawn is overgrown. I suggest that we mow the lawn, trim the bushes, clean up the leaves and clean everything up.\n\nIn reality I didn’t want to do the job. I wanted to come back to the yard and see what else was here.\n\nI was getting obsessed with the yard. All I wanted to do was go back and dig. Perhaps id find other things that I had lost in the past. I don’t know. \n\nIt was a strange phenomenon. \n\nJoe replied: Thanks Oscar, we will pass for the moment. I am looking forward to doing it myself when I get back next week. Thanks.\n\nOkie doke. I responded.\n\nI didn’t care I showed up the next day and I started digging.\n\nI dug about 5 feet deep, and I couldn’t find anything.\n\nI dug a little more, and what I heard messed me up. \n\nOscaaar!! Help!! Oscar Help!! It hurts!! I didn’t see the truck!\n\nIt was my aunts voice.. she had a tragic accident that killed her on the spot. \n\nHere’s the story of my aunt’s tragic death her car slid on snow causing her to go under semi-truck. She died on impact. Her life was lost withing seconds. The truck driver was fucked up after that he blamed himself even though it wasn’t his fault. I had told him I had no ill feelings towards him; however, that did not stop him from taking his own life. What fucked him was seeing everything firsthand. He saw the whole mess. It was a blood bath. It was dark and tragic accident.\n\nMy aunt raised me like a son. My mother was a crackhead and never gave a shit about me. Aunt Krista was all I had. Her ashes of what remained of her sit on a mantle top of my fireplace. \n\nSo, when I heard her voice. I kept digging. A light shuns from under the dirt.\n\nThe more I dug the clearer I heard Aunt Krista’s voice. It was started to become clearer to me. \n\nIt wasn’t a voice anymore, but more like cries and horrific deadly ear piercing screams. So bad that my ears started to bleed.\n\nI dialed one of my workers Manuel. \n\nManuel! Come here I need help with this job! Manuel I think I am going crazy.\n\nOrale, I’ll be right there carnal. Manuel said.\n\nI thought I was going crazy. I need somebody else to see this. Manuel had worked for years for me. He was more like family to me. \n\nManuel arrived 30 minutes later and found me crying in the corner of the backyard near the fence line.\n\nQue paso? Manuel said.\n\nLook over there in that hole, and tell me you don’t hear the voices. All the voices they are driving me crazy!! I said.\n\nAs Manuel walked over and looked down to the hole I dug. He went into a trance. He got the shovel and started digging saying “Papa! Papa! My sweet padre! I’m here Papa!”.\n\nManuel started digging aggressively. A maniac look took over his face. Manuel’s eye grew darker as the light in the hole grew lighter. \n\nManuel stop! Manuel snap out of it! \n\nI looked down to the hole, and I knew that we had undiscovered something dark.\n\nA portal to another world? Or perhaps a portal to a dark and twisted word? The world of the dead? Hell? The upside down? The fuck I know!\n\nI ran to my corner in the fence line and started crying. This is when I started writing everything that happened. I wrote everything down on an old yellow notepad. \n\nHowever, I don’t know what will happen next.\n\nManuel is gone. POOF he disappeared into the portal. I know I’m next.\n\nThe light keeps calling my name, and the euphoric feeling I have when I look into the light makes me like I am having a rebirth. Like a cleanse. Deep down I know it’s dark and evil, but my short term pleasure is taking over. \n\nSo, this is my advice to you. Don’t ever visit the property located at 8882 Song Sparrow, and for crying out loud don’t ever dig in the backyard. Somethings are not meant to be uncovered. Hold your pets and loved ones close to you, and don’t come looking for me.",

        "text": "My name is Alexandra, I am a 16 year old girl, I still live with my parents. I love both of my parents dearly, but someone in my family was always there for me when others weren't. Someone who was the apple of my eye, a family type of bond that I cannot explain how strong the bond was. A soulmate. His name was Kodiak, he is a big fluffy love-able Newfoundland dog, his fur is a beautiful brown just like the Kodiak bear. I basically grew up with Kodiak my entire life, including my childhood. He was like a brother to me, except my bond between him and me is stronger than my actual brother. I believed our souls were related and meant to be.\n\nI cried my eyes out when the veterinarians told me he wouldn't live any longer than 2 years, he had a Cardiac Tumour growing onto his heart. I had booked an appointment with a different veterinarian who had told me that he would heal my dog, at first I thought this was too good to be true. He told me a herb that can \"apparently heal\" the Tumour and reverse it. I trusted him. I trusted the veterinarian. I don't know what kind of idiot I am. I am depressed, I breakdown every time I think about my dog. I betrayed my own soulmate by a stupid foolish trickster. I am sorry, Kodiak I love you. I would've never let anyone hurt you. I am scared. But you aren't here for me anymore, Kodiak where are you. I don't know if I can move on without you, I want to be with you forever. Just me and you, nobody else here. That sure sounds great, I love you Kodiak. I can never forgive what I have done to you.\n\nKodiak was taken from the veterinarian, I never got him back. What the veterinarian told me was clever lies disguised as a gift. I contacted the veterinarian, his name is Alfred, I took my dog to this veterinarian. The animal hospital was unique, the capacity only allowed 2 dogs max and the treatment was extra special and all professional. Alfred took classes for 10 years, mainly studying the dogs anatomy and the way the dogs bodies work. His vet office was mainly for dogs, I heard many great reviews from there. People told me their dogs were never so healthy before, one of the dog owners had even claimed he cured cancer. I was convinced and made a mistake because all humans do. I let him \"temporarily\", according to him. Alfred took my dog because I thought he would fix him. It's been 3 months without my dog and no information from Alfred, I was worried. But I thought \"maybe this treatment takes a while\". I told myself everyday that there is nothing to worry about and Alfred wouldn't hurt my dog. I thought at least.\n\nThe thing I found strange about Alfred was his obsession with my dog, he would always draw pictures of my dog's anatomy, he even talked about how he knew how to skin wolves. He joked about skinning my dog and wearing his skin, who would've thought that wasn't a joke. Tell me, who. Am I just an idiot.   The weirdest thing he told me about is the science behind knotting in dogs, I never wanted to know. He even had a real dog's skeleton, with a dog's skin on top of the skeleton acting as a cloak. The veterinarian told me to wait, because he needed to go downstairs and nobody is allowed down there except him. I found this odd, really odd. Maybe that was his space where other dog's files were. Maybe to protect the privacy of the owners. Not to mention, he would also take strays or dogs with rabies, and he would claim he would heal them or just send them to dog shelters. Nobody ever heard from the dogs he would take, nobody even knew the shelters or where the \"cured dogs\" went, they've just assumed he gave them away for new homes.\n\nMy dog came back after 4 months, he was cured and healthy. I was so happy to see him, my eyes were pouring happy tears. But something was off about my dog, instead of being the happy energetic dog he used to be, he would rather sleep all day. He would avoid humans, and he didn't even like his favourite foods anymore. This wasn't Kodiak at all, I just thought he was depressed from not being at home for so long. Maybe he and Alfred weren't getting along that well? But my dog also looked different, his eyes were more.... Human. His fur was not as vibrant as before, it looked like a tanned pelt. His paws, were oddly shaped. His snout also had a weird shape. He hated dog food, he refused even his favourite dog food. I gave him a plate of peas and mashed potatoes, he was starving and he never devoured food so fast. So I made a recipe that was safe for dogs to consume, he was no longer refusing food. He had no energy as he used to, but he was up walking around and barking. His barking sounded very off, although. Kodiak never wagged his tail, the tail was stiff. I got pissed at my dog for the first time, he would refuse my love and he would growl and run away. I wasn't only just enraged, but I was also heartbroken to see my dog this way. I've tried to contact Alfred, but the number was apparently out of service, I've tried to find the location of the office. It was still there, I've even gone to the office. Alfred wasn't there, the other veterinarians had claimed they never knew \"Alfred\". Nor have they ever heard of him. So I screamed at the veterinarians because I knew something was always off about this \"Alfred\" guy and threatened to even burn their place down, and call the police on them. I was dead serious, I grabbed my phone and lighter. You should've seen the look on their faces when I stabbed one of them with my pocket knife, I knew that Kodiak wasn't my dog. I was 100% positive. The police were called on me, before I could even take a look downstairs. The police were already there, I had told them about my dog. They let me go, but they didn't check the office because they had other \"duty\". \n\n* I got home, there was Kodiak sitting on the couch staring at me with his unsettling human-like eyes. I went to the couch to sit beside him, he was making weird whimpering noises. A noise that I've never heard a dog make. His crying was getting louder so I went up to Kodiak and started to pet him, I scratched his belly and I felt something on his belly. I looked under his tummy, I saw a zipper and I was confused. So out of curiosity, I unzipped his zipper. I saw human skin, it looked like a human stomach. I saw that my dog's skin was literally sewed onto the person. I panicked and started to question the human inside of the dog, he was whimpering and struggling to speak. I remember. When the human inside of the dog stood up on his hind legs, his paws and feet were oddly shaped. His legs and arms were human. He didn't even pretend to act like a dog anymore. He started to walk on his hind legs, he started to mumble things. I asked him if I could take a look inside of his mouth. I think he agreed because he sat down and opened his mouth. I look inside of his mouth. There was a man inside of my dog, my dog's jaw was attached to his so when he barked, the mouth would move. My dog had been skinned and his face had been turned into a taxidermy so I wouldn't suspect a thing. When I say his eyes were human, his eyes didn't have any dog features. I didn't know how I thought this was normal, I went crazy. The human-dog now lived with me, he would play his role as a dog when visitors came. But with just me and him, he walked around like a human. Eating, sleeping, drinking and watching T.V as a human. Keep in mind that it was horrifying, I saw that other brown Newfoundland dogs had been sewn onto my dogs skin so that a man could fit inside. He was now my new companion, he would listen better. He would even still play fetch and play card games with me. Alfred called me, he told me that this is what he'd done, he knew I wanted my dog to live longer. So Alfred said, \" I thought, why not make him live as long as human\". He had told me he skinned and tanned my dog, and got a taxidermist to do his face. He drugged a man, and sewed the dog onto him. He told me the man wanted to become a dog, so he told the man he would make a realistic suit for him and find him an owner. Basically he just did what both of us wanted, except not in a way what we wanted. So I decided to go along with it and accept the fact that this human-dog is now my companion. I fed him, I played card games with him, I treated him like a dog and a human being. He still ate out of a dog bowl, he would sit with me and eat meals at the dinner table. Basically, because Alfred wasn't his real name and Alfred kept his identity a secret. The police couldn't do anything, if they tried taking the suit off of this man, he would die. My dog's skin is becoming infused with his skin, I couldn't do anything and the man had told me he is pretty happy with his new life. He had his own dog house outside, and had his own dog bed. \n* Basically, I have my dog but forever, basically this man got his dream but also forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBe careful of what you wish for. It may not be what it seems.",

        "text": " \n\nI was there when he bought the damn thing. We went to a garage sale just out of town; an old woman’s house that had the driveway filled to the very edge with hand-me-downs and knick-knacks. My sister Angie and I were waving through a selection of old dresses when he surprised us with it. \n\nHe was just standing there, staring at us behind the eye-holes of that hideous thing. I’ll never forget that thousand-yard stare, coupled with those unsettling lips and wispy strands of hair. I nearly jumped out of my skin, and my sister screamed, one that drew the attention of everyone else browsing the drive.\n\nIt was just a prank, something Tom was known for, but there was something so awful about that mask. It looked like a human face.\n\n“You’re such a dick!” Angie said, flailing at his chest. He laughed for a second, extending his arms and acting like a zombie, cheesy moans and all. He kept laughing as he pulled it off, the stretch of the thin rubber elongating the nose and cheeks.\n\n“I’m sorry! I couldn’t resist. I mean, *look* at this thing!” Tom said as he hugged her around the waist playfully, holding it out for her to see. She was flustered and holding back tears, but she tried to play it off.\n\n“*Thanks.* I hate it.” Angie said, pushing it away.\n\nI knew then she *really* didn’t like it. Angie was sensitive to pranks like that. Even when we were kids she would bawl every time I would hide somewhere and scare her, crying long after our parents would comfort her. It was something that stuck with her even into our college years. Angie *hated* to be scared. \n\nTom stopped laughing, sensing he had clearly hit a nerve.\n\n“Alright babe, I’m sorry. *Sorry,* okay? I’ll put it back.” He said, attempting to sooth her with a caress on her cheek. One she didn’t give into until after he tossed it back in the box he found it in. It rolled sloppily over some old VHS tapes, coming to a flattened halt on its side. The empty eye holes stared innocently at Angie, and she shuddered as they went back to browsing.\n\nThe mask seemed to have a personality of its own. It was fucking creepy, plain and simple. I knew the thing was going to be a problem, so as they walked away I tried to hide it.  I covered it up with another box, one filled with weathered basketballs and old tennis rackets. Tom was smart, even going to college to be a doctor. But he was a natural prankster. If he found it again, he wouldn’t be able to stop himself from buying it.\n\nNot long after, we concluded our day at the garage sale. We got a pretty good haul, I found a few old sweaters that would look good with some shoes I had, and Angie got a pair of platform boots, as well as an old vinyl of *Purple Rain.* \n\nTom got a haul of his own, clutching an old paper grocery filled with jeans and a 90’s version of the *Ab-coaster.*\n\nTogether we left the garage sale and headed back to town. I drove, and Angie sat up front with me. Tom sat in the backseat, rifling through his bag to inspect the jeans he bought, mumbling something like “you have to pay to get them like this now.”\n\nWe drove for a while, taking back roads on our return to town so we could enjoy the sun and the weather. Things had gotten so busy as we got older, it was nice to just drive around like we did when we were teenagers. Looking back, I wish I had taken more time to enjoy Angie’s company, and make more effort to hang out outside of work.\n\nBy the time we got to town, we decided we would grab something to eat. We pulled into a burger place, intending to get some food and eat outside. As I swung into a parking spot, Angie unbuckled her seatbelt and swiveled in her seat. I saw it coming in the rear-view mirror, but it was too late.\n\nThe scream that followed could’ve woken the dead.\n\nTom was sitting perfectly still in the backseat. Stretched across his face was the mask from the garage sale.\n\nAngie ran out of the car, screaming bloody murder. Tom took the mask off immediately and threw his hands up in surrender, but Angie was *inconsolable*. \n\n“I didn’t actually buy it, it was just there in the bag.”\n\n“I don’t know how it came with me, *I swear.*”\n\n“You saw me buy my stuff! I didn’t buy it. I didn’t even know where it was!”\n\n“I don’t know why I put it on. I just thought I’d get you one more time. I’m sorry. I don’t know why I did it.”\n\nTom pleaded his case, but ultimately it was his fault for buying it, even more so for putting it back on. I didn’t actually see him buy it, but he was smart enough to figure out a way to hide it.\n\nIn the end, I was the only one to calm her down. Sprinkling some of that older-sister charm, in the midst of the shitty looks I gave Tom.\n\nHe gave me the mask, and I threw it in the trash. I told him I’d kill him if he scared my sister like that again. He apologized several times, most of which fell on deaf ears. He said the same thing over and over again.\n\n*I promise I’ll never put the mask on again. It’s gone, okay? It’s over. I promise.*\n\nI could hear the sincerity in his voice, he understood he fucked up.\n\nBut all I could see was the unsettling look of his eyes behind the mask in the rear-view mirror. I wasn’t easily scared, but there was just something not right about that mask. It made me think of a woman's face. \n\nAngie came around, eventually. Tom paid for our meals in an attempt to make amends, but it was pretty clear he was in the doghouse for the rest of the day. We ate our food in silence, Angie sniffling while she chewed her cheeseburger. Tom tried joking and turning on the charm. It worked a little bit, but you could tell she was still wounded over the ordeal. \n\nAfter we ate we decided it was time to call it a day and return home. The two of them had school in the morning, and I had to work the next day. I made an effort to check the garbage before I left. The mask was still there, quietly watching underneath burger wrappers and fountain cups. It stayed there as we pulled away. Tom didn't even look at it.\n\nThey sat together in the backseat, and Angie warmed up to him again. They talked about school, trending shows, and current events. They laughed. Tom was funny when he wanted to be, and he could be really sweet when he wasn’t fucking around. I don’t think I’d ever fully forgive him for the second scare. You don’t quite forget something like that.\n\nBefore I got to the campus they were sweet on each other again, and I had to tell them to “get a room”.  They laughed a little. It seemed like they had gotten past it.\n\nTom’s dorm was a couple miles away, and my sister’s apartment was only a couple blocks down the road from there. It was dusk by the time I dropped them off. We said our goodbyes and made plans to get together again when things got less busy, on the condition that we wouldn't go to any garage sales next time.\n\nOn the way home I thought of that horrible mask, and how bad it had scared Angie. There was something about it that I just couldn’t shake. The way its dingy locks felt like human hair. The way the rubber felt like *real skin.* \n\nEven as I dozed off to some Netflix, I couldn’t get the image out of my head. It made me want to drive back to that burger joint, dig it out of the trash and set it on fire.\n\nIn the middle of the night, I woke to the sound of my phone going off. Through the fog of sleep I checked the time. It was shortly after 2am. Angie was calling me.\n\nI answered immediately, thinking something was wrong.\n\n“Hey, Ang. What’s going on?” I said through a yawn.\n\nThere was nothing on the other line for a time, and I wondered if she had called me on accident.\n\n“Ang? You there? Hello?” \n\nThe only response was rapid breathing, like someone was running in the background.\n\n“Hello? *Angie,* you there?”\n\nShe hung up. I immediately called back.\n\nThe phone just rang on the other end, over and over until her voicemail picked it up. I left a message telling her I was worried, and for her to call back.\n\nI was just about to set the phone down and go back to sleep, when I realized I had some unseen notifications. Like a lot of them.\n\nAngie had texted me several times, more and more frequently leading up to her call:\n\n**Hey, you up?**\n\n**I know it’s stupid, but I keep thinking about that mask**\n\n**You guys threw it away right?**\n\n**Right?**\n\n**I called Tom, but he’s not answering. Probably playing cod again :/**\n\n**You guys threw it away right?**\n\n**Sorry, I can’t stop thinking about it. I know it’s dumb**\n\n**Wtf**\n\n**We lost power, weird**\n\n**Tom’s not answering, would you mind picking me up? I can’t sleep**\n\n**I guess I’ll just try to sleep. It’s fuckin creepy here though**\n\n**I think there’s someone in my apartment**\n\n**Oh god**\n\nThe last text was an attachment, and image that hadn’t downloaded yet. My heart raced as I stared at the screen, waiting for the Wi-Fi to do its thing.\n\nWhen I opened the image, I wanted to scream.\n\nThe picture looked like her living room, the center of it illuminated by the flash of her phone’s camera. Tom was sitting on the couch in the dark, staring blankly at the turned off television. He was only wearing a t-shirt and boxers, his feet covered in dirt.\n\nStretched over his head was that horrible mask.\n\nI called Angie again, and when she didn’t pick up, I called the police. I reported a break-in, and started getting dressed to head over there myself.\n\nBy the time I arrived, the entire apartment complex was lit up. Four squad cars, a firetruck, and an ambulance. No sign of Angie, or Tom. Neither of them answered the phone.\n\nPeople were standing outside in their pajamas, looking terrified, pointing their fingers. I had to push past the group to see, and when I did, I felt a knot forming in my throat. Everyone was looking at the same thing, despite the policemen’s efforts to keep them back.\n\nThe stairs leading to Angie’s apartment were covered in blood, a trail that continued onto the sidewalk and into the grass. The messy drag mark kept going until it reached the woods, where it seemingly vanished.\n\nIt took two weeks before the police would give me any details, aside from what I already knew. They can’t really explain what happened, they don’t really have a straight answer. There’s obvious suspicion of foul play, but there’s no witnesses. With the power being out, there’s no eyewitness statement on what unfolded. They suspect the blood spatter started in the bedroom, but there’s no murder weapon to clarify exactly what happened. There’s dozens of handprints on the sheets, stained in blood. All Angie’s, because they're simply too small for a man’s hands. There were muddy footprints all over her apartment, but only an adult male’s. Angie didn’t take another step after what happened in the bed. They searched the woods for her, but the trail went cold immediately. No blood after the drag mark… nothing. Like they just disappeared.\n\nTom didn’t have a car. That night, he had left his phone, wallet, and dorm key on his nightstand.\n\nThey said they’ll keep me updated, but I can see it in their eyes. They have nothing. It’s already over.\n\nI went back to that burger joint where we tossed the mask and went through the garbage. I checked the bin we tossed it in, even cut open every bag in the dumpster behind the building. The mask wasn’t there.\n\nI went to the old woman’s house and questioned her about the mask she sold us, but she had no idea what I was talking about. She remembered us quite clearly, but she said she never sold us a mask. She never *had* one in the first place. \n\nBoth Angie and Tom were never seen again.\n\nTheir disappearance and the cause have shaken our little town to its core. I don’t understand. Nobody seems to understand. The news can speculate, people can form their “theories”, but it doesn't really matter. \n\nThe lack of reasoning behind this isn’t what keeps me up at night. It’s not the fact that the trail goes cold. It’s not the fact that we combed the woods and found nothing. It’s not the fact that the burger joint was three and a half miles away from the dorms and her apartment. It’s a little detail in the police report, one that was left out of the press. \n\nTom’s muddy footprints were all over the crime scene. Up the apartment stairs, heavy imprints outside the door before they let themselves in. They led from the front door to the couch, where he sat in the same spot of the picture Angie sent me. A single path leads to the bedroom, presumably following her to the bedroom where she ran in fear. The mud tracks don’t follow her to the bed, though. \n\nThey go up the wall, and onto the ceiling, where they stop. Directly above her bed.\n\nIn the exact spot I see them now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[—AHS](https://www.reddit.com/r/HawaiianShirtFiction/comments/s1rwfv/online_story_archive/)",

        "text": "I’m not sure how or why it happened, *but it did.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI still see it as a distant memory. Details of that night still creep into my nightmares. I know what\n\nall I experienced, *the three of us do*, and yet, no one is left to truly recall the tale but me. Would\n\nthose who I was with wish me to just forget about that night, or would they want me to share\n\ntheir story? The truth is I have no idea, but I do know that I am going to type my story out here.\n\nWhether I share it with others, I have no definitive answer yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Halloween night, 2022.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was a junior in high school, at West Arrow High School. As part of the student council,\n\nI, along with a few others, had been tasked with overseeing this year’s Halloween Dance event\n\nthat the school puts on every season. Well, turns out no one wanted a dance this year, more so\n\nthey wanted a festival or a place to goof off and do all sorts of edgy things; the life of a high\n\nschooler, I suppose.\n\nI joined a small subcommittee to help in organizing the Haunted House attraction that\n\nwould be set up in the gym. A general haunted house doesn’t quite describe it. What it more so\n\nwas, was the gymnasium full of fog with a few obstacles and actors chasing you around as you\n\ntried to find objects—just basically your average horror experience.\n\nNow, I was never into dressing up or chasing down other people—acting, I suppose. Thus, it was\n\neither that or helping the hot dog vendor outside in the chilly October air, so thus, I chose the\n\nactor job. I tell you; schools just think they can get away with telling students to do things for no\n\nreal cash, just hours of “volunteering” that will ultimately become useless down the road.\n\nStill, I was surprised when the teacher overseeing the Haunted House came to me asking\n\nif I wouldn’t be an actor anymore, but instead would be the guy who rehides the found items at\n\nthe end of every round. Needless to say, opportunity only knocks once, and so, I took it in a\n\nheartbeat.\n\nThen again, there were some hidden disadvantages. I helped in setting up tables and\n\nfolding chairs, the “obstacles,” and then it was lights out and fog machine on. The attraction\n\ndidn’t open for another hour, as planned, giving the gym ample time to fill up with the nontoxic\n\nfog.\n\nEach of us, the five actors dressed as monsters, the teacher, and me all acquired\n\nflashlights to which we used to navigate to our starting locations. It might not surprise you, but\n\nthe cheap dollar-store flashlights provided essentially jack-shit for vision, though I could only\n\nimagine how sight was for the actors, being behind their masks and such. Honestly, it was a bit\n\ncomedic the first time one of them ran into a metal chair and a loud bang echoed around the gym.\n\nThe laughs of the others and myself followed.\n\nI found my way to the far end of the gym surprisingly fast, mostly just relying on\n\nmemory at this point. Truly, the gym really looked transformed, serial even. Oddly enough,\n\ncynical old me had to admit, it was creepy to see the distant glow of flashlights dancing about in\n\nthe mist. Adding to it, the fog machine didn’t even turn off, and the gym would only become\n\neven more foggy throughout the night.\n\nThe teacher, Mr. Strauss, announced for us to all get in our starting positions, and with\n\nthat, he left the gym, closing the door behind him, and beginning his telling of the rules to the\n\nkids eager to play outside. He passed out flashlights that the players themselves could use, but to\n\nwhich we’d previously taped over with parchment paper to dim the luminescence.\n\nIn truth, it took him around ten or so minutes to explain those rules and whatnot, so for\n\nthe time being, I just sat, crouched behind a desk where I wouldn’t be seen until the game ended.\n\nFor those wondering, Strauss instructed me to stay inside the attraction to lessen my back-and-\n\nforth through the doors which would let out fog. Troublesome, seen as I already felt the urge to\n\npiss.\n\nI checked myself over. That morning I hadn’t worn a costume to school like I was\n\nsupposed to, but instead, opted to continue my fashion sense with a white button down and a\n\npumpkin-patterned tie, all tucked into kakis. Well, crumpled beneath a desk nor only made my\n\nware worse.\n\nThe silence was then interrupted by the doors to the gym opening, and thus, the first\n\ngroup of ten players stepped inside. I peeked out from behind the desk, knowing that being at the\n\nfar side of the gym in the thick fog, I wouldn’t be seen. Their flashlights were pretty dim, but\n\napparently worked as intended. They’d be able to see the items they needed to collect, but also\n\nlure the “monsters” closer.\n\nTheir laughs turned to silence, and pretty quickly it was clear as the lights dispersed that\n\nthey were going in five teams of two. Smart. Then, the screams started as the silhouette of one of\n\nthe seekers charged into the students, immediately getting one out and causing the rest to run for\n\nit, turning off their lights and blending into the dark.\n\nI twisted myself back under the desk and gripped my flashlight tight. Moments later, a\n\npair of footsteps passed by the desk, and I heard two voices.\n\n“Found another item,” one whispered.\n\n“I’ll hold it. Should we turn on our light?”\n\n“Are you crazy?”\n\n“We can’t even see where we are! Turn it on really quick so we can…”\n\nThe voices faded away. I peeked back out from my hiding spot, and for a brief moment,\n\ncaught sight of the couple turning on their flashlight which instantly revealed a seeker right\n\nbefore them. They screamed, and as one was caught, the other turned to run, but tripped over a\n\nchair, alerting the other seekers to come over and get her out too. Both of them walked to the\n\nentrance, then they waited till the ten minutes were up or all the items were found; however and\n\nwhenever the game would end.\n\nIt was then I felt a hand on my shoulder, and I’ll admit, I screamed, though to most\n\neveryone else it probably just sounded like another player was eliminated.\n\nA familiar laugh followed. It became louder as the monster mask was taken off. Though I\n\ncouldn’t see her, and I was told not to turn my light on during the game, I knew who it was.\n\n“Alice? That’s not funny!” I threw a punch in her general direction but missed.\n\n“Yeah,” she laugh-whispered back, “it *was* scary. Gotcha though.”\n\n“Aren’t you supposed to be out there hunting people?”\n\n“Am I? I can’t see shit through this mask. I’ve already run in to three tables. My waist is\n\nso sore, and it’s just the first round! Besides, figured I’d check up on you. So, how are you\n\nanyway?”\n\n“Crouched behind a dirty desk. But I mean, at least I’m not running into shit.”\n\nShe laughed again, then her footsteps carried her away. By the sound of it, she caught\n\nanother player only seconds later.\n\nWhen the ten minutes were up, Mr. Strauss opened the door to announce the end of the\n\ngame. I sprung out from my hiding position, and met with all the remaining players and seekers\n\nby the main entrance.\n\nAll our flashlights combined; we could see the results of the game. Three players\n\nremained, with six out of ten items found. I took the oversized Jenga blocks we called “items”\n\nrespectively, and jogged off, making sure to hide the blocks in different spots than before, some\n\nharder and some easier. I checked to make sure the other blocks were still hidden, then unclipped\n\nmy walkie talkie from my belt.\n\n“All clear.”\n\n“Good,” came Strauss’s voice. “Before we start the next round, we’re going to make a\n\nfew changes. First, there should be a Bluetooth speaker in that desk at the far end of the gym.\n\nThe actors have all agreed you should play some spooky ambience through it; help set the mood.\n\nAlso, I’m here with Cameron. He’s gonna take over when you need a break, but he’ll also radio\n\nyou. He’ll wait with the players who get out, and collect all the blocks when the games up and\n\ngive em’ to you. He’ll have this radio now.”\n\nCameron was one of my best, and only high school friends. To keep it short, we met\n\nfreshman year, and instantly were like Yin and Yang. All the same interests, clubs, honor\n\nsocieties--we shared in pretty much everything the other did.\n\n“Hi.”\n\n“Cameron, you gave up on running Balloon Pop?” I gave a sarcastic reply. “Or was it\n\nDuck Pond?”\n\n“Oh shut up, I got lightheaded. Plus, this looks hella cool in here.”\n\n“Everyone, get in your starting positions,” Strauss’s voice echoed before the door shut.\n\nVery quietly, I could hear him explaining the rules to the next group outside in his same boring,\n\nmonotone voice he aways spoke in. The actors’ voices came from out in the fog as they laughed\n\nand made comments to one another about how the previous run had gone. I could hear Alice to\n\nmy right and Cameron was by the entrance. It’s funny, without being able to see it, my mind\n\ncreated a somewhat mental map of the gym and where the actors were.\n\nI found the speaker as instructed, hooked it up no problem, and played the first hour-long\n\nsoundscape I’d found on YouTube with crickets, owls, rusty gates, and howling wind; pretty\n\nmuch stereotypical Halloween soundtrack. Again, you wouldn’t know it entirely unless you\n\nwere there, but in the increasingly dense fog, the gym really was really unsettling.\n\nI heard Strauss’s warning knock followed by Cameron ducking behind his desk. The door\n\nopened, and the next ten entered as Strauss attempted to be more efficient by staying outside and\n\nreadying the next group.\n\nRinse and repeat. Flashlights were instantly turned off to hide their locations, the players\n\ndispersed, and every now and again when someone would run into an obstacle and the noise\n\nwould echo, I’d give a slight chuckle.\n\nTen minutes later, we all met and I rehid the blocks while Cameron tallied the winner.\n\nNeedless to say, no more changes were made this round, or to the three subsequent games that\n\nfollowed.\n\nI suppose I was getting a bit bored, and feeling a bit mischievous, I started peeking out\n\nfrom under the desk and briefly turning on my flashlight to troll the seekers. When a group of\n\nplayers would walk past, I’d bang on the desk and snicker at their screams of “holy shit!”\n\nOnce, Alice thought my light was a player and ran into my desk. She instantly knew what\n\nI did and all I said remarked in a quiet voice was, “Karma’s a bitch.”\n\nAnother round and my jokes were already growing old. Then sparked the urge; I want to\n\nsee what it would be like out there actually playing as a player.\n\nOf course, I already knew where the blocks were hidden, but that wasn’t necessarily the\n\npoint. If I could get away with sneaking out into the fog and pretending to be a player, no one\n\nwould know the difference. None of the seekers could see me through their masks, and any other\n\nplayers would just assume I was with them.\n\nSo, with the fog growing impossibly dense by now, so much so that my light, which was\n\nnot hindered by tape and parchment paper, couldn’t even see more than a few feet in front of me.\n\nTruly, I was surprised they let the fog get this thick, and it didn’t seem to be dissipating in the\n\nslightest.\n\nAs soon as I was up and moving, the loudest scream I’d ever heard bounced off the walls\n\nof the gym. I flinched to cover my ears. Now I can understand it might have been scary to see\n\nsomeone dressed up as Slenderman emerge from the fog and tackle you, but why high school\n\ngirls feel the need to burst a lung, I’ll never understand. Heck, I would’ve thought they were\n\ndying.\n\nStill, the scream did enforce the idea that I should probably turn off my own light, and\n\nthus, I did.\n\nI moved slowly with my hands reached out into the pitch black. The air felt heavier. The\n\nblackness consumed all my rational thoughts. It felt as though I was suddenly a child again,\n\ncrying for my mother when the nursery went dark.\n\nMy foot collided with something on the floor, and I nearly tripped. Unfortunately for me,\n\nwhile steadying myself the flashlight slipped from my hand. I heard it land on the floor not far\n\naway, and as I crouched down in an attempt to retrieve it, my hand touched an unexpected\n\npuddle on the floor. I pulled back like I’d been bitten, quickly wiping my hand on my pants.\n\nThe thought of having actually just infected my hand with someone’s piss repelled me;\n\nrepelled me enough to give up on finding the flashlight. To hell with it anyhow. My eyes would\n\nadjust soon. I figured I’d either make my way to Cameron or back to my desk, but it was only\n\nthen that I realized I had absolutely no conception of direction.\n\nA few lights danced about in the distance, and so with no other reference point, I\n\nstumbled toward them. While my eyes may have adjusted in normal darkness, my eyes could see\n\nthrough fog. Of course as I did move to chase the other flashlights, the lights went out and more\n\nscreams came. This group in particular, was by far the most easily frightened. I’ll admit, their\n\nscreams legit sounded real and frankly, out of pain. But then again, I couldn’t imagine Alice not\n\nbeing a bit rough with her jump scares. Thus, I gave name to this group: “The Screamy Bunch.”\n\nStill, it was an eerie break in the silence that followed, and maybe it was just the fog, or\n\nthe subconscious need to fill the silence that urged me to cough, basically announcing myself.\n\n“Nick!” Cameron’s voice was in my ear before I felt his hands on my back.\n\nI spun around. “Yeah?”\n\n“We need to stop the game. Do you have your light?”\n\n“No, I lost mine. Don’t you have one?”\n\nHe spoke fast with an edge to his voice. “No. I wasn’t given one.”\n\n“Why do we need to—”\n\n“Because, something happened to Alice.”\n\n“Huh? What? Did she scare a--”\n\n“I found that I forgot to give you one of the blocks, so I nonchalantly started looking for a\n\nplace to hide it and tripped over Alice. She was lying on the floor just moaning, barely even\n\nconscious. She couldn’t say anything coherent.”\n\nI felt a deep pain in my gut. Truthfully, I knew it was a stupid idea to have people running\n\naround in the pitch black in masks with obstacles. Just another thing to add to the list of death\n\ntraps this school has accumulated over the years.\n\n“She must’ve tripped over a chair or something.”\n\n“You think? She’s probably got a concussion! This is too dangerous.”\n\n“You’re telling me! I nearly slipped in someone’s piss!” I demanded.\n\n“We can worry about that later. How much longer do we have till this round ends and\n\nStrauss comes back in?”\n\nTruthfully, I didn’t know, but I did know we couldn’t wait till then. Maybe it was just a\n\nminute more, or it could have been nine minutes.\n\n“Look,” I pointed towards a distant light, though it was mostly useless for Cameron to\n\nsee my hand, we need to go get that guy’s light and then find a wall, and follow it till we find the\n\nexit.”\n\n“Brilliant.”\n\nCameron and I dashed a bit faster than we ought to have in the dark towards the last of the lights.\n\nThis, in turn, caused the friend by my side to trip and fade away into the inky darkness. I would\n\nhave stopped to help him, but ended up running into one of those wood cutouts you put your face\n\nin at carnivals before I could do anything. I got my arm stuck in the hole where you put your\n\nface, and as it toppled down on top of me, I struggled to get it off.\n\nUp to this point, the night was seemingly just rather normal, apart from the attraction\n\ngoing to shit of course, but that notion didn’t stay long. Cameron screams came, loud and gut-\n\nwrenching. They lasted for no more than a few seconds, then came to a startlingly abrupt stop.\n\nI had either the choice to continue for the light or help Cameron, and I chose to dash for\n\nthe light. Hear me out, aiding Cameron would have done nothing in the dark, but if I could get to\n\nthe light, then I could help both him and Alice. Plus, that also meant shutting down the attraction\n\nand preventing everyone else from getting seriously hurt.\n\nI shimmied towards the light, now calling out that the game was over and there was a real\n\nemergency.\n\nHalfway there, I started hearing footsteps behind me. Not fast, but rather slow and quiet,\n\nlike someone was trying to sneak up on me. I picked up my pace, not wanting to play any more\n\ngames.\n\nI reached the light, and found it lying on the ground. I reached to pick it up, and again felt\n\nrepulsed that it too was slimy and wet. I went to wipe it on my pants, but the light revealed the\n\nother substance that I’d wiped there earlier.\n\nFor a moment I found it odd. The school certainly didn’t allow fake blood to be used; that\n\nwas a question Cameron had asked just yesterday. *Then the pieces clicked.* I dropped the\n\nflashlight from my hand.\n\nThen came the question: whose blood, was it? Alice’s? Maybe it was all just a really\n\nmessed up prank. *Yeah, a prank on the socially awkward kid who only wanted to hide under a*\n\n*desk for the night.*\n\nAnother scream came from not too far away, and I realized that it wasn’t the scream of\n\nhaving a good scare, but rather a real, life-threatening last exhale of breath.\n\nI wasn’t having any of it now, and as luck would have it, I backed up against one of the\n\nwalls of the gym. With one hand on the wall, I jogged the length of it, hoping to find the exit.\n\nFirst however, I found the ninety-degree corner of the gym; the corner that just so happened to\n\nhouse the lights. For once, things looked promising, but of course, nothing good lasts forever.\n\nWith one flick of a switch, the overhead lights filled the gym, but my vision stayed just as\n\nuseless with the fog. The light reached the floor, but the fog was so built up and dense that my\n\nhand looked ghostly, even right in front of my face.\n\nNot knowing what else to do, I continued racing the wall towards where I knew the exit\n\nwas at this point. Need I say, I did eventually make it, but not before witnessing the limp body of\n\na girl I’d hardly known from homeroom, propped up against the wall; eyes rolled back and\n\nlifeless, mouth hung open at an offset angle, and blood stains turning her Casper the Ghost\n\ncostume a deep shade of crimson.\n\nI reached the door, and while at first, I imagined it had to be locked, (because really, in\n\nthis situation it always is), but again, as luck would have it, the door screeched open. One look at\n\nmy stained clothes and Strauss showed the most expression I’d ever seen in the old man during\n\nmy four years at that school.\n\nThe rest is a blur. Tens of police officers showed up in minutes. The gym was aired out, though\n\nthe police wouldn’t even enter until around an hour later when the far wall was visible.\n\nThe last thing I remember was the awful, unimaginable horrors in the fog. All ten players,\n\ntwo seekers, Alice, and Cameron were sprawled out around the gym, *like ragdolls in a daycare.*\n\nThe two remaining seekers were found hiding behind the same desk I used as my initial\n\nhiding spot.\n\nIt was quickly determined that I, nor the two others, were in any way responsible for the\n\nmassacre, and we were directed to go home. No gun, no knife, *no human* could have done that.\n\nThe corpses…they were torn apart and mangled in a way not even the most mental of crazy\n\npeople could possibly conceive. My heart goes out to those families that suffered the loss of a\n\nyoung life. That night, I too lost many things: my two best friends, my childhood, and the spirit\n\nto celebrate Halloween ever again.\n\nI don’t remember what the official reports were for the cause of death of the victims, but\n\nlet me just say, I count my stars at night. Running with Cameron; that very well could have been\n\nme who could have tripped and been taken. Often, I wish it was. Other times I don’t.\n\nI think it can be fun sometimes to take one of your senses away for a fun spooky game.\n\nBut when does the game stop being a game? When you as the player can’t just restart with a new\n\nlife? Maybe, but all I can say now is, don’t go into the fog, because you can’t even begin to\n\nimagine what else is in there with you.",

        "text": "Not gonna lie, I am totes weirded out that I am writing this, but ready to bounce, nonetheless. Ok… for real though, as the title suggests, I have quite the unique life compared to you humans. Now before anyone scrolls down on this post to call me a cringy hack, I want to mention that you have no proof of such things; it’s typical of you to quickly judge. To help you out as you read this post, I ask that you remember that you think that your life is normal. Correct? Well, I see mine in the same light. And that’s all you should need to know to understand me. \n\nGoing over it quickly, I’m known as a “Lateovorus,” or, for familiarity reasons, what is commonly but incorrectly titled as a “Vampire.” We’re not exactly like what you monkeys assume in your books and movies; we don’t hate the daylight but we do hate garlic, though only for the taste. And Bats? I don’t want those winged rats anywhere near me, especially my legs. Lateovorus, you see, are descendants of an ancient species of what you call a “spider” and have learned to both look and communicate in the exact same way as you creatures. And with our knowledge of the cosmos and its connections to consciousness, no human knows of our existence. So why am I writing and sharing this post? Well, because I’m over 3,000 years old at this point and am apathetic. Lateovorus only need 4 hours of sleep every 24 hours (ugh). We only eat once every few months. And, besides those two things just mentioned, we spend all our time blending in. Oh! And we’re immortal, to add to the boredom. \n\nBesides reproducing and raising the youth, we have no reason to care about one another, in truth. The life of one of my kind is dull whenever we’re not messy eating, like I’m going to share with you readers. I think you’ll be quite surprised with what I am about to describe and you may even lose your faith in this world being one of overall good. But that’s life. So let’s begin with my own life as the blonde, gorgeous high school girl that makes men drool as she “picks them up throughout the generations.” The first thing to know about seducing a human male, or prey is to remember the number one rule that my parents taught my brother and I - everyone is in a subconscious hierarchy. By that they meant that every human is always doing things to try and prove themselves and blend in with the culture that they find the most desireable and makes themselves most desirable. On a deeper level, it’s different reasons for men and women to climb the hierarchy. But the basic motivation of climbing to fit in is always identical. \n\nThink back to your time in school (maybe you’re still in classes?). Who did anything and everything in order to be desirable? Did they blend into the culture or did they maybe even form the new, suddenly desired way to thrive? Now think about how others responded. Did some try to follow in the alpha’s footsteps? Did some show signs of disgust or lack of care in following? How did the latter showcase it? Who did they hang with, instead? Remember that what is cool and desirable is always subjective. But with that stated, the masses will always flock together, even when some leave or are abandoned by the greater group. That’s just how trends work, especially in today’s age of internet culture.\n\nNow I want you to think about which type of group you choose to identify yourself with. The jocks? The goths? The nerds? Which group touches you? Does anyone in there touch you on a stronger level? Maybe they’re even outside your desired group? Who makes your jaw want to drop and leaves your stomach gurgling to be closer to that person? Who makes you want to make them yours so that you can be with them for as long as required? You’re doing good; I’m confident that’s the case. Lateovorus feel all the same emotions, although in different ways. Nevertheless, we all can agree it’s a magical feeling to find someone that you can love. For the sake of this post, I’m going to tell a story about one guy who I crushed on and eventually scored the big win with. He started out tall, slightly muscular and clean-shaven. I know, I understand. “So cliche,” I can hear you shout. But, listen, I can’t help it. I’m a girl who loves guys that I can temporarily fantasize about as my guard in shining armor. A girl’s gotta have her fantasies met. Otherwise, where’s the motivation? Do we have the green light to progress? \n\nSo back to this guy, I won’t lie that I had feelings for him for years. I was a very pretty girl and he was a very pretty boy. I was a curvy cheerleader and he was a hunky football star. Again, cliche, I understand. But just because it’s cliche doesn’t immediately make it boring. And he had just broken up with his cheating ex too. Towards him, I had affection. And love me back he could very easily undertake. It was obvious that fresh meat was at the market, even though I had just finished my last meal at the time I began this new pursuit. One night, after a long football game where he scored the winning touchdown, I approached him on the brightly lit field, with pleasantry. Despite the cold wind, his presence, I swear, made me feel warmer. And despite some lasting darkness, I swore I could see every detail of his perfect face all the while his muscles bulged and sweat-beaded hair gently danced in that now cooling breeze. I pity my brother every day for not being able to see human men how I see these things. \n\n“Nice to see the D1 star hasn’t lost his edge.” I leaned in and pointed at myself. “Don’t think you’ll be going pro though.” He scoffed at me, body upright and voice burly. He soon also gave a cocky smile while folding his arms tight. “Oh!? So you really will just assume that!?” He sounded passive aggressive. “Well I don’t think Cheerleading will get you far in life either.” Despite the response, I knew that I could manage him. Skipping all of the boring details, besides the seductive touching on my end, we soon after went on our first date. Then the second one. And you know the rest; we both fell madly in love. And by a month's time, I had solidified my spot as one of the top girls in the female hierarchy. The football star, whose name was Kevin, had grown so close to me over that timeframe - we were almost literally inseparable. By the end of our first, incredible month together, I knew that I had found my next buffet. Now it’s time for the next step in the process. Let’s go back a little bit first though and give you a tip on how to pick up your stud muffin. \n\nYou appeal to their fantasy. That’s it, pretty human females. You want a man? Suck it up and just be his puppy. It’s easy these days and all the smart ladies, with similar motives that I am about to share, are picking this tactic up. What’s going on is we’re going to play a game of driving a man into desperation to keep you, his trophy, even if it means him unknowingly bending his back for you until it breaks. Most men just want symbols of success in order to feel better than the rest of them, and you’re going to satisfy this necessity. And if you want to be something other than that then I suggest you either leave or keep reading for whatever you're trying to get from this; I welcome any aim. \n\nNow with that said, I in no way support doing things that go against your ethics because it’ll only result in failure. Remember, what you see and what I see as ok to do are different and I’m, again, really just writing this out of boredom. I’ve known many capable human females who I’m sure would have said “no” to my advice, had I ever provided it. But for the sake of my wants and needs, especially as a Lateovorus, I’m going to get who I want, through my methods. Now, after you get close and comfy with your man, the next step is to showcase admiration and imply loyalty. Compliment him, lean on him and let him lean back. You should listen to as well as obey everything that he says - request or not - so long as you’re comfortable. A puppy with a collar around their neck should listen and love regardless of who their owner is. But never forget that you’re silently a fox. Kevin and I started out a little awkward, to be honest. Especially because he had just gotten his heart broken. But there’s nothing a little empathy, a good hair day and white teeth can’t fix. Within days, his persona had already begun to slide off as his desperation for human love continued to shine more and more; body relaxing but voice becoming weaker as he became more and more attached to me and what I represented.\n\nAnd I soon knew that I actually had the collar already on his neck; he was my puppy. I felt naughty and heartless. But dinner, for me, makes the heartache all worth it in the end. I will never say that Lateovorus don’t feel empathy. We do feel for others. But we are able to suppress our empathy in order to get what we want, and enjoy a delicious meal. We usually only pick those we love anyways and this is how we communicate that to them. Again, our lives are just as normal as yours, so long as you think outside of your own fictional world. With my influence over Kevin gaining, it was time to prepare him. Although first, the friends had to vanish. The men were all “dude, bro” types. And the women were all just there because those men, including my man, were hot and comforting. \n\nNothing is more important than connection, for humans. Studies I’ve read are beginning to confirm that loneliness kills as quickly as smoking and obesity, combined. Loneliness can even cause the same effects as pain, as shown through studies on brains. Even with these sad facts in mind, it’s unfortunately important to separate prey from all their loved ones, as much as possible. And no, I do not resort to killing them. If you aren’t on the menu then we want you to stay both off our matts and out of our hair. Of course, there was one exception around 50 years ago, when one toxic ex wouldn’t stay away from who I was trying to make my next masterpiece. But I thankfully had my older brother do me a solid and take her under his wing, for the last few months that she was alive and remembered. That “masterpiece” was not so satisfying, thinking back on it. Continuing to be open and honest, I actually much rather prefer turning older and dining on the flesh of men that are around the age of 40, so long as they’re flesh is not too chewy. However, ruining their children’s lives does take a greater toll; as if meeting humans to eat them wasn’t enough. But I’m getting distracted. \n\nBack to instructions, the goal is to remove the boy from his loved ones. So long as you are close to him, you need only a tongue and a brain to execute this step. It starts with a small negative opinion you have about his friends and/or family. And then another opinion. Keep saying negative stuff about them, but get progressively more worried about these people over time. Eventually, your man will begin to believe his friends and eventually family are actually a negative influence towards himself. It will hurt his perception of the hierarchy. Other loved ones, trends and even morals and values will dissipate and you will remain as the only one who sees the tragic reality. Your man will slowly conform to your standards and listen to all of your words. By this point, their loved ones may realize what’s going on and try to take your prey away. Twist the narrative to make them sound petty and unable to understand the connection you share with who you chose. You’re also going to want to text and call your man more and more often, during this time. Get more aggressive when they talk to other girls and are not around you. Lean on them, kiss them, do anything you can to keep them in your web. If they have a certain fetish, try and appeal. You become their world. You control them. They’ve been reprogrammed after weeks or maybe even months of you working your magic. It is worth noting that because it can take months, as just said, it’s widely recommended among Lateovorus that we find our next bag of meat even when we are on a full tummy. That gives us more than enough time for conversion. And it’s become so easy in the last few decades for females like me due to the explosive growth of hookup culture and men’s growing fragility. Life just gets easier as you humans get both weaker and stupider. Not to mention the trivial, overexaggerated dramas. \n\nKevin was pathetically easy. No father was ever around so he, to his lack of awareness, played the illusion of Mr. Unbreakable. Everything was done to release hidden aggression as a result of having no one to help him control it. Most men I’ve met with this issue cower in the corner, so to speak. But Kevin trekked on. And to be honest, I respected the hell out of that soldier. But he was still a victim to his inner demons. Before I became the picture, everything, even all his clothing, had to reaffirm that he was strong and independent. He was broken and nobody noticed. No human ever really notices this stuff though. But to be fair, humans have always been the worst offenders of this, especially in recent times. Yet still, I do believe that every creature’s mentally ill, albeit to varying degrees. This includes me, of course. And now with his demon’s strings being mine to pull and yank, if need be, I could now introduce Kevin to a lifestyle of complete isolation from anything related to self care.\n\n“You’re beautiful the way you are,” I said as I slowly convinced him to drink more and more, eat more high calorie foods and to watch more and more shows with me, on the couch. He only had one person to please now and thus that person was his life force. If I didn’t care that he was drunk, fat and unshaven then why should he? Kevin, like you all, only lived to impress. And if you don’t want your man to look and act like mine then just have different demands for him to follow. If you can do this to your man, then your puppet is basically complete. But this next part is the best. He’s become stuck with you to the point of never being able to break free; he’d never even debate what seems like such a curse. He’s isolated from everyone else and now he’s so obese and fat that he doesn’t even look like the same soul. And here, my readers, is how I did the last step with Kevin and ate him. I invited Kevin over to my big house for the night. Of course, my family was made aware of the purpose of his arrival days before and were told to leave the house half an hour early because I like my privacy. \n\nA half an hour after they left, as expected, Kevin waddled in, all smelly and sloppy looking; a far cry from the man I once loved, may I add. But it didn’t matter and I’ll tell you the reason. Because while my eyes and nose were far from being well-fed, Lateovorus’s taste buds always respond positively to high fats, high calorie humans. This made my last time with Kevin appear like it was going to be a memorable experience. To me, it was even set up to be romantic. Before he had time to react, I got a chloroform rag over his saggy mouth and, with all the strength of a few thousand year old teenage girl (I say partly joking), I dragged him into the kitchen and onto the mat I had laid out earlier. With the hard work done, it was time for my victory meal. My muscles, skin, bones and other parts inside and around my mouth began to crack and pull as they reformed to allow my jaw to lower to the bottom of my chest. This makes room for my real teeth, you understand. I should mention that drool habitually pours out of my mouth upon seeing the meal prepared. At the same time, and speaking of seeing, my eyes also go back to their pitch black selves. The veins on my back slide away to make room so that my eight legs, identical to that of a black widow’s, can erupt and hold me far above the ground as my human legs and arms also shrivel back inside my body; my elongated tongue and webs protruding from my mouth are all I need for gripping and subduing Kevin upon his eventual awakening. Most Lateovorus, including almost all the males, like to go fast. But I think to really feel the love for your prey, you should eat them as slow as possible. Ignore the screams and peel skin, remove flesh in chunks or even lick a vein until it slows down in its useless exertions of blood. Compared to earlier in the day, he was so much more attractive after I began my feast. I just loved it when he was more open. And I worked way too hard to gobble up this delicacy like a pig. With that said however, I do make sure to be a pig when it comes to how much I eat of my prey. \n\nIn four to five hours, Kevin, bones and all, was inside me. His thick, sludgy blood, texturally speaking, was licked off from the musty kitchen and my body was also licked as clean as attainable. After catching my breath, I transformed back into my more convenient human form. A nice, long shower and proper dental hygiene must be taken in order to clean off all of the hard to remove stains and, especially, the remaining flaps of body parts crowded in between one’s teeth. After you’re all done though, take a few days to rest; you’ve earned it. And of course, if you’re human, like most, if not all of you, then skip the eating part.\n\nI know that what I wrote may sound disgusting and you may be wanting to call the police, but I have one more thing to share. Kevin does not exist anymore, in any way, shape or form. Upon finishing my ingestion, I used my knowledge of and from the cosmos, as mentioned in the beginning, to change the human consciousness and erase all ability to have memories of the victim. Any object that was specifically related to Kevin disappeared as well, after this process, with the help of other forms of manipulation that all Lateovorus share. That’s what my brother did to that pesky ex and that’s what I’d done to Kevin. Report him if you desire. But no one can even tell whether or not I’m just shitposting. You believe what you want to believe. But regardless, I appreciate this time to write about myself to those who now see me for what I really am. Again, I know many who believe will feel powerless and may lose faith in this world being one of kindness. But please attempt to understand that this is only nature taking its course and we are all simply a part of something beyond any of our control. Desperate male’s gotta appeal and empowered female’s gotta choose and control, especially in this day and age. It’s you humans who are at fault for believing that there’s something more to that relationship.",

        "text": "Last night before bed, I dictated some notes about a project I’m working on into my voice recording app. When I got up in the morning, I realized I’d never turned it off; there was a seven-hour, twenty-one minute long recording waiting for me.\n\nLater that night, as I was cooking dinner, I decided to have a listen. Did I still snore? Two years ago, in my last serious relationship, my boyfriend said I did. Or did I sleepwalk? One time I found my salt in the middle of the counter, without any memory of putting it there. Maybe I was one of those people who could cook a whole meal in their sleep without ever knowing about it.\n\nCurious, I tapped a random spot in the middle of the seven hours and hit ‘PLAY.’\n\nQuiet white noise played through the phone’s speakers. Then the soft rustling of blankets, as I rolled over.\n\nI finished cooking my chicken, pulled the Brussels sprouts out of the toaster oven, and plated everything up. I ate for several minutes, listening, but there was only more white noise. *Maybe I should just put on the TV. This is getting a little boring.*\n\nBut just as I reached for the phone, I heard it.\n\n*Creeeaaak.*\n\nThe unmistakable sound of a door opening.\n\n*Huh. I don’t remember getting up to use the bathroom*. Knife poised over the chicken breast, I listened closely, for footsteps or a toilet flush or anything else.\n\nBut there was only more white noise.\n\nI shrugged and cut into the chicken. Took a bite. *Too dry. I’ll have to brine it longer next time.* I lifted my fork over a roasted sprout—\n\nI froze.\n\nThere was a sound coming over the white noise. So quiet it was almost inaudible. But I could hear it, because it was irregular—a *sshhh*ing or hissing noise coming through at odd intervals. I paused, tilting my head, holding my breath as I listened.\n\nThe sound grew louder. I turned the volume up on my phone, holding my breath, straining to listen. I couldn’t quite make it out… but it almost sounded like…\n\nWhispering.\n\nThe sound then faded away, and the uninterrupted rush of the white noise took over. I let out the breath I’d been holding and slumped back in my seat.\n\nI listened for the next several minutes as I finished dinner, but it was just more white noise and rustling. *I guess I don’t snore anymore,* I thought. I picked up my plates and got up to bring them to the sink—\n\nAnd then I heard it.\n\n*Shabantemetashabantemeta*\n\nWhispering.\n\n*Loud* whispering.\n\nAs if, whoever was saying it, was right next to the phone.\n\nAs if they were *right in my bed.*\n\nI dropped the plate. It shattered on the floor. But I couldn’t move. Couldn’t breathe.\n\n*No. It has to be me. I must be sleeptalking.*\n\n*There’s no way it could be someone else.*\n\nI collapsed back into the chair and stared at the phone. At the jagged soundwave on the app. The whispering continued, a string of indecipherable syllables.\n\nAnd then it stopped. I grabbed the phone and rewound it, playing the whisper again. But I couldn’t make out any individual words. Just the same sounds over and over: *shabantemeta, shabantemeta.*\n\n*What was I trying to say?*\n\nI paused the recording and whispered the syllables to myself. *Shabantemeta.* But I had to admit… the way I whispered them didn’t sound at all like the recording.\n\n*Was someone… actually in here?*\n\n*Should I call the police?*\n\nI shook my head. I’d watched too many true crime shows. There was absolutely no evidence of a break-in. I locked the place up like a fortress at night. It had to just be me, sleeptalking. My mom told me I sleeptalked once or twice as a kid. I must do it all the time, without realizing.\n\nSighing, I finally got up and cleaned the shattered plate.\n\nThat evening, as I went about various chores, I kept the recording playing in the background. I thought I heard the whispering a few more times—but it was so quiet, it very well could’ve been my imagination. Other than that, there was just white noise and occasional rustling. Finally, at around ten PM, I reached the end.\n\nI got settled in bed, pulling the covers over me. For a second, I considered turning the app on and recording my sleep again; but I decided against it. It would only bring more stress. So I cuddled against the pillow and closed my eyes.\n\nBut as I drifted off into sleep, a horrible thought occurred to me.\n\n*Before the whispering, I’d heard the door open.*\n\n*But I never heard it close.*\n\n*If it wasn’t me, whoever it was—*\n\n*They’re still here.*",

        "text": "Have you noticed that r/nosleep engagement has been dropping over the years? It’s only a slight downward slope. Almost imperceptible. It’s not that Redditors have been engaging any less frequently with the subreddit. It’s simply that there are fewer members *alive.* And I just found out why.\n\nThe moderators have been eating them.\n\nI don’t know how many of you will have a chance to read this post. A few hundred. A few thousand. Likeliest scenario, the mods denounce me as a liar and swiftly delete this evidence.\n\nThey wouldn’t stop there. I can already picture hungering eyes poring over every word I’ve typed. In fact, I think what scares me most is that the moderators probably *won’t* delete this. Nobody can stop them. They’ll maliciously grin at the screen, preparing for their next meal.\n\nI already know that they’re coming for me.\n\nOn Friday evening, I received a horrifying document from my friend on Reddit. Let’s call him Joe. He said that he’d received the document from a once-prolific poster on this subreddit. I won’t name the user. I’ve messaged the aforementioned user repeatedly, but there’s been no response.\n\nThe document included a list of Reddit usernames, and there was a message at the top:\n\n*The moderators aren’t human. Your time has come when you receive the purple notification.*\n\nI snapped my neck around to face the open bedroom door behind me.\n\nI live alone, and my hauntingly-hollow house often plays tricks on me, but I know what I saw. In the reflection of a pitch-black segment on my screen, I caught a ghastly glimpse of a twig-like man on the unlit landing. He had been standing in my doorway and watching me. His form flitted from view before I had the chance to look directly at him.\n\n*Ping*.\n\nOn my desktop monitor, there was a new Reddit notification. The message came from the r/nosleep moderators, but the username wasn’t green. It was purple. As if that weren’t horrifying enough, the message read:\n\n*Nosleep fear tastes so sweet.*\n\n*Your haunted brain is what I’ll eat.*\n\nA melodic humming sound echoed around the vast nothingness of my grand, cavernous home. The twisted tune of whatever was watching me.\n\nBody twitching, I tried to suppress my fear and compose myself. I wanted to believe Joe had orchestrated the masterful prank, even though I knew he was far too serious a fellow for anything like that. I messaged him, seeking reassurance that nothing untoward had occurred. He replied:\n\n*Are you shitting me? Come over to my place. I just received the same message. I don’t know whether we’ve been hacked by someone, but it’s given me the heebie-jeebies.*\n\nThe last thing I wanted to do was venture to my friend’s house at a quarter to midnight, but I was far too frightened to stay in my house of horrors. Besides, Joe only lived a few minutes away on foot. Not that a pitch-black walk really appealed to me, either.\n\nShadows danced along the walls of every alleyway I passed. Anyone else, in an ordinary circumstance, would have chalked that up to trickery of the light. But I know it was the same insidious, inhuman figure that I saw on the upstairs landing of my house. It was following me.\n\nI hurried to Joe’s apartment building and frantically hammered the buzzer. He didn’t respond. After ringing desperately for several minutes, somebody finally appeared in the lobby and opened the door for me.\n\n“Hi, Paul. Are you here to see Joe?” Mrs Callander asked.\n\nI hurriedly nodded my head and slid past her, sprinting up the stairs to Apartment 11. Joe hadn’t answered his buzzer or my numerous phone calls, so I was fully prepared to kick down his door.\n\nNo need. It was ajar.\n\nLightly pushing it open, I gazed into my friend’s dark, eerily-still flat. As I tiptoed inside, I breathlessly observed my surroundings. I didn’t want to announce my presence. Joe wasn’t a prankster, and if he were, he still wouldn’t have done something so elaborate. I knew it wasn’t a game.\n\nThen, I heard a looping hum. That same melodic medley from my house. A foreboding arpeggio.\n\nThere was a squelching sound from within the kitchen. My head told me to run, but my legs were guided by some external force. I was unable to resist the siren song.\n\nWhat I witnessed in that room fundamentally broke me as a person.\n\nJoe lay on the kitchen table, sprawled out like a slaughtered starfish, and he had been scalped with maliciously-meticulous precision. Above him, a shapeless shadow munched merrily on the grey matter sitting in his fractured skull. The inhuman Reddit moderator was devouring his haunted brain, as it had promised.\n\nHorrifyingly, Joe was *still alive*. His teary eyes locked onto mine whilst his limbs were seizing.\n\n“Flesh in the grape tower,” He stuttered, losing his brain function. “Yes, eleven times.”\n\nThe shadow had no discernible form, but I know its shadowy head turned to face me. It developed an opening that vaguely resembled a crooked smile. I wailed internally, too stunned to speak, and fled the kitchen.\n\nThe thing pursued me. I didn’t have to turn around to verify that. I bounded upstairs and barricaded myself in the upstairs bathroom.\n\nThat’s where I’ve been hiding for the past day. I can’t stop thinking about Joe. I’m plagued by the horrific sight of him lying there, losing his brain piece by piece.\n\nHow does it feel to lose one’s brain so *slowly*? I don’t want to imagine. Perhaps I’ll die of thirst before the shadow breaks inside. I hope so.\n\nJust heed my warning and leave this subreddit before it’s too late.\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle)",

        "text": "Two years ago, I spent a few months in a homeless shelter. It was a low point for me like it was for so many people. My job as a line cook at a fine dining restaurant was a casualty of the pandemic. My savings dried up quickly. The people who I would usually rely on during hard times weren’t fairing any better than I was.\n\nBefore I knew it, I was on the streets. Eviction protection came too late for me. I shuffled aimlessly from place to place trying to stay warm. It was the most difficult four months of my life.\n\nJust as I was at my wit's end, a lady directed me toward a long-term shelter where I was lucky enough to get a bed. It was a godsend. Reliable housing and food were something I took for granted for so many years.\n\nMy time at the shelter made me grateful for the life I had and made me look forward to a day when I was secure again.\n\nDuring my time there, I worked as a custodian. All of the jobs in the facility were staffed by other residents of the shelter. It put a little bit of money in my pocket and helped pass the time. Most importantly, it gave me a sense of purpose again.\n\nNot everyone there worked, though. There was a dormitory for men and women who weren’t well enough to work. Some of them had physical limitations while others suffered from mental illness. They remained in the dorm most of the day and I got to know quite a few of them as I would clean the common areas.\n\nJames Hartman lived there. He was about my age, thirty-seven or thirty-eight if I recall correctly. \n\nYou wouldn’t have known it by looking at him, though. He was skeletally thin with sparse wisps of iron-gray hair. His gums had retracted from the base of his teeth and all of his joints protruded horrifically under his skin.\n\nHe was nice enough but off-putting. It wasn’t just his unhealthy appearance that you could get used to.\n\nHe never left his room and rarely had visitors, but he would talk nonstop. It wasn’t like mad rambling. No. It was more like half of a conversation.\n\nWhen you looked into his room, he was always alone.\n\nI would go to his room twice a week to clean up. James rarely got out of bed. The desk and bedside table in his room always held the mostly untouched remains of meals the other workers brought to his room. Almost none of the food from the plate would be eaten and I would throw the molding plates into my rolling garbage can.\n\nWe would make small talk sometimes while I cleared away the waste.\n\n“How are you today, James?” I asked one afternoon. Smells of molding food and spoiled milk drifted through the air. “Feeling alright today?”\n\n“About the same as usual,” he said quietly “How about you?”\n\nI droned on for a few minutes about my work at the shelter and told him I was looking for a full-time job and an apartment. He would nod his head weakly and smile, showing his elongated teeth. I knew he was trying to be pleasant and I hated myself for it, but I always felt so uncomfortable when I was in his room.\n\nIt was like talking to a living corpse.\n\n“James,” I said. “I hate to be nosey, but are you sick? You never eat and it looks like you’re wasting away. Has the shelter taken you to the hospital to get checked out?”\n\nHe laughed weakly which morphed into a heavy, wet cough.\n\n“I’m not sick,” he said in a matter-of-fact tone. “They’ve taken me to the doctor but they all say there is nothing wrong with me. Just can’t eat. When they put in a feeding tube, I pull it out. Makes me sick.”\n\n“That’s rough, man,” I said, finishing up my tasks. Having gathered up all of the old plates of food, I turned to leave. “I hope you start feeling better soon.”\n\n“I won't get better,” he said without emotion. I’m being punished.”\n\nI stopped cleaning the room and turned to look at him. The smile had faded from his face. As unhealthy as he had always looked, at that moment he looked as though he was near death.\n\n“Being sick isn’t a punishment,” I replied with sympathy. “You’ll get better.”\n\nHe rolled over and faced the wall.\n\n“I’ll be dead soon,” he responded.\n\nHe was right. James died the following week. To the surprise of no one, the cause of death was starvation. He was six feet and two inches tall and only weighed eighty pounds at his death. His autopsy revealed no issues.’\n\nJames starved himself to death.\n\n…but maybe not.\n\nShelter staff asked me if I would clear out the content of James’ room after his death and I agreed. I knew it wouldn’t take much time as he never held on to anything. There were only a few changes of clothes, some ratty paperback books, and an old notebook on his bedside table.\n\nI’m not sure why I did it, but after I boxed up his belongings, I sat down on his bed and flipped open the spiral-bound pages. The first few pages were filled with flowing cursive but as the writing went on you could see the delicate letters begin to deteriorate. On the last few pages, it had devolved into hard-pressed block letters.\n\nLook, I don’t know if any of it was true, but I’m going to share part of it with you. I can’t make sense of it. Maybe you can.\n\nEverything beyond this point is James’ own words. I’ll leave them just as he wrote them.\n\n\\* \\* \\* \\* \\*\n\nThis isn’t a journal. No need for times and dates. I’m just going to write out, to the best of my memory, how I ended up this way.\n\nThe thoughts in my mind are hazy now\n\nMy stomach grumbled so severely I could feel my chair shake. I looked around the conference room to see a few of my coworkers stealing glances at me from the corners of their eyes. There was no sense in pretending it wasn’t me. It was an everyday occurrence now.\n\n*Do you think everyone heard it this time?*\n\nMy attention drifted to a huddled mass in the corner of the room. The corpse acknowledges me with a slight nod as my eyes meet with the hollow sockets of his face. One side of his jaw dangles to the side, disconnected from his skull. A bloated, black tangle flops lazily over his chipped teeth.\n\nHis mouth used to move to the sounds of the words in my head, but in his advanced state of decomposition, his detached jaw no longer allowed him to complete the illusion. He just stared blankly as he mocked me. Maddening words echoed in my head.\n\n*How much longer do you think you can go on, James? It’s been at least three days since you’ve eaten. Maybe four. What the hell do I know? Time doesn’t mean as much to me anymore.*\n\nNo one else can see Robert as far as I can tell. \n\nHe follows me everywhere now. \n\nWhen I first started to see him, I went to countless psychiatrists and therapists. All of them listened to me as I described in detail the rotting homeless man that followed me everywhere. Talked to me constantly. Woke me up in the middle of the night.\n\nNo matter how many professionals I talked to, none of them could find a diagnosis. A few suspected schizophrenia while others were concerned I had a brain tumor. More than one assumed I had a drug problem I couldn’t come to terms with.\n\nIt was a fruitless effort and I gave up after six months.\n\nI came to terms with the horrifying truth.\n\nI wasn’t sick.\n\nI was haunted.\n\n\\* \\* \\* \\* \\*\n\nI’m not exactly sure when I met Robert for the first time, but he was a regular fixture in my day even before he began to haunt me. The investment firm I worked for was in the heart of downtown in a major metropolitan area. It was only a short walk from my highrise apartment so I traveled on foot unless the weather was bad. The fresh air and exercise were nice.\n\nThe constant barrage of homeless people begging for money, not so much.\n\nFor my first few years working for the firm, I usually carried spare change in my pocket. As I made my way to work, I would give a few quarters to each homeless person that asked as I went. Growing up in a small midwestern town, my parents instilled in me a sense of charity. They always seemed grateful for the few coins I gave them each day and it filled me with a sense of satisfaction for helping them in some small way.\n\nRobert was one of the homeless people I saw on my walk to work each morning. He always sat on the stoop of an abandoned apartment building, backpacks and plastic shopping bags behind him filled with his possessions. We didn’t talk much at first, but he would toss me a wave and a friendly smile as I passed by.\n\nHis appearance was well kept for the most part. Neatly cropped gray hair and no more than a few days of stubble. All of his clothing, while well worn, was in reasonably good condition. The only sign that he lived on the streets was all of the bags of property sitting behind him on the porch.\n\nHe was the only one who didn’t ask me for money.\n\nOne morning he spoke to me. Just a casual conversation.\n\n“Mornin’ sir,” he said cheerfully. “How are you doing today?”\n\n“Not too bad,” I replied. “Just heading to work. How are you?”\n\nHe smiled and gave me a thumbs up. I waved in return and continued on my way. It wasn’t an earth-shattering conversation, but it was the start of daily small talk. He had a kind way about him. As the weeks turned into months, our conversations grew a bit longer and I started to learn more of his story.\n\nRobert had been a construction foreman for many years until a workplace accident put him on medical leave. A scaffolding he had been standing on collapsed and caused damage to his spinal cord. He spent several weeks in the hospital followed by physical therapy. Slowly, he was getting back to normal.\n\nThe pain medication became problematic.\n\n“Couldn’t get the monkey off my damn back until it was too late,” he told me one day. “Don’t mess around with that shit if you don’t have to, James. It’ll sink its claws into you and take everything away. I’m clean now, but hell, I lost everything in the process.”\n\nHis story struck a chord with me that day. It occurred to me once again that Robert had never asked me for money. I had never seen him ask anymore for money. There was no cup for change and no cardboard sign asking for help. He just sat and waved at everyone passing by on the sidewalk.\n\n“Why don’t you let me give you some cash, Robert,” I said as I pulled my wallet from my back pocket. I pulled a few bills out of my pocket and extended them toward him. “Maybe it will help you get a little closer to getting back on your feet.”\n\nRobert smiled and pushed the money back toward me.\n\n“I appreciate it, sir,” he said. “You just hang on to that for now. Day labor isn’t too hard to find around the city and I manage to make enough to keep my stomach filled up. It’s a kind offer, but maybe you can keep it for me for a particularly bad time.”\n\nI stuck the cash back into my wallet, assured him I would help if he ever asked, and said goodbye to Robert.\n\nHe never did get any money from me.\n\nI offered dozens of times but he always said no.\n\nUnfortunately for both of us, the only time he ever asked for money, I said no.\n\nNow I’m paying the price.\n\n\\* \\* \\* \\* \\*\n\nAfter a few years of seeing Robert on his stoop each morning, suddenly he was gone. All of his belongings were gone. Another man huddled in a sleeping back was stretched across the old apartment stoop.\n\nFor a few weeks, I wondered if Robert was okay. I asked some of the people I gave change to each day if they had seen them. Some shrugged and said they weren’t sure while others said they didn’t know Robert.\n\nI hate to admit it, but after a month, I didn’t think of him anymore. It wasn’t as though we were best friends, but I feel guilty now for forgetting someone that was at least a small part of each of my workdays. Object permanence took over. I didn’t see him, so I forgot him.\n\nMy walk home saw much fewer unhoused people. I worked long hours and the evening dark had usually set before I left the office. It didn’t take long for a chill to settle in outside without the warm rays of sunshine falling on your shoulders. I guess most of them were busy trying to find a warm place to sleep for the night.\n\nStill, I saw one or two. A few quarters in every cup. Some kind words and well wishes. Then off to my apartment.\n\nAbout halfway through my walk home, I saw a shabby man in a long coat holding a coffee cup. He was extending it toward passers-by, largely ignored and staring at the ground. As I drew closer to him, I dug a few quarters from my pocket in preparation to drop them in his cup, but he shuffled into the alleyway to his side, looking dejected.\n\nWhen I reached the alley, I saw him picking up a tattered backpack and slinging the straps around his shoulders. Reluctantly, I walked toward him with my quarters in hand. It wasn’t much, but I hated seeing how everyone else had ignored him and wanted him to have some cash to grab a bite to eat.\n\n“Excuse me,” I said to him. The man looked up at me, concern and distrust painted on his face. “I have a little bit of money for you if you need it.”\n\nThe man smiled at me as he readjusted his backpack. He slowly walked toward me and extended his coffee cup in my direction. I reached out and dropped the coins.\n\n“That all you can give?” he asked, sounding irritated. “I figured if you followed me in here, you were going to be able to give me more than a couple of quarters.”\n\nHis response confused me at first, but it quickly evolved into anger. For years, I had made a point to keep enough change in my pocket to give everyone a little bit each day. People had always been appreciative of it. That was the first time anyone had scoffed at what I gave them.\n\n“Yeah,” I responded curtly. “That’s it. Have a good night”\n\nI turned to walk away but a hand reached out and grabbed my shoulder. The force of the tug spun me back around, causing me to stumble to the side. A sneer curled the man’s lip toward his nose and we made eye contact.\n\n“That ain’t even enough to get a damn sandwich,” he spat. I began to back away from him but he stepped forward to keep pace with me. “Dig a little deeper, man. That suit and nice shoes gotta mean you got some money in your wallet. Why don’t you just hand it over?”\n\nI turned to run but the sound of footfalls erupted behind me. \n\nThe last thing I remind was a pair of hands gripping the fabric of my coat and throwing me to the ground. My head bounced against the concrete. Everything went black.\n\n\\* \\* \\* \\* \\*\n\nThe next few months were a rollercoaster for me.\n\nI woke up in the hospital. Someone had called the police when they found me lying unconscious in the alleyway. A mild concussion and a dozen stitches were my rewards for trying to give the man some change.\n\nTurns out he wasn’t even homeless.\n\nHis name was Tyler Hilton. He posed as a homeless person and begged on the street each day. The cops told me they had arrested him on an unrelated assault later that same night and found my wallet in his backpack. He did a few months in jail and paid my medical bills.\n\nI was grateful that the justice system came through, but it didn’t give me back my previous sense of security.\n\nWhere I had walked to work and back for years, now I was too anxious. It was expensive, but I took a taxi each morning and each evening. My anxiety about being in public was crippling for months. On the rare occasion when I did have to walk somewhere, I avoided getting close to any pedestrians and would cross the street not to walk in front of an alley.\n\nTherapy helped, but it was a slow process. I started out taking short walks during the daytime hours on the weekend close to my apartment building. After a few weeks, I made myself walk a bit closer to other pedestrians. Eventually, I was even able to walk in front of alleyways without having a panic attack.\n\nI know it sounds trivial, but I had lived a fortunate and secure life. The thought of being assaulted seemed like something that could only happen to someone else. Maybe I hadn’t handled it well, but we all have different struggles.\n\nIt took almost a year, but I finally resolved to start walking for my daily work commute again. I carried a can of pepper spray in my pocket to help alleviate some of the anxiety. Amazingly, the small metal tube didn’t have fingerprints indented on it. I squeezed the damn thing like a stress ball for my entire commute.\n\nI stopped carrying change in my pocket too. The thought of going back to that practice was more than I could stand. Even though the man who attacked me hadn’t been homeless, I couldn’t break the association between giving out change and having been attacked.\n\nIt seems heartless, but I was consumed with fear.\n\nAfter a few weeks of walking to work, I was surprised to see Robert for the first time in ages. He wasn’t on his usual stoop. Instead, he sat with his back resting against a brick wall. A tattered duffle bag sat beside him on the sidewalk and he stared down at the ground.\n\nHe didn’t look well, either.\n\nWhen I had last seen him he had still been neatly shaven with a close-cropped haircut and a fairly neat set of clothing. Now shaggy whitening hair dangled in front of his eyes. A matted beard fell onto his chest. His clothes were filthy and riddled with holes.\n\nFor a moment I considered passing him by since he hadn’t seen me, but something made me stop.\n\n“Robert?” I questioned. “Is that you?”\n\nHe looked up at me, eyes sunken into his thin face. While he had never been a large man, when he looked at me I could see how much weight he had lost. The muscles danced and rippled under his skin.\n\nBut he smiled and waved. \n\nFor a moment, he looked like the Robert I had seen so many mornings.\n\n“James!” he exclaimed, voice hoarse. “Where have you been? It’s been a long time.”\n\nI hesitantly walked closer to the man.\n\n“I… had an accident,” I stammered, pointing to the scar on the side of my head. The wound had healed well, but a delicate line of scar tissue still ran across my scalp. “I’m doing better, though. You were gone for a while too. Is everything okay?”\n\nThe short-lived smile melted away from Robert’s face. He pulled up his left pant leg revealing a gruesome field of scars. I looked on in horror at the patchwork of pale, mended skin.\n\n“Got hit by a car,” he muttered. “Broke my leg pretty bad. Spent a while in the hospital. I was doin’ better, but that damn monkey crawled back on me.”\n\nI looked at him with a puzzled expression and he realized I didn’t understand what he meant.\n\n“They had to give me narcotic painkillers after surgery,” he said. “Got hooked on ‘em again. When they released me from the hospital I couldn’t get anymore. Did some… things… that I ain’t so proud of to try and get ahold of some.”\n\n“Shit…” I said weakly. “Robert, I’m so sorry.”\n\nHe waved a hand at me and smiled again.\n\n“No sweat,” he said with a bit more vigor. “I’m clean again. It’s been rough, but I’m off the junk. Trying to get myself back together.”\n\nI stood in silence, wanting to comfort him but failing to find the words.\n\n“Say,” he said. “I hate to be that guy, but you made a kind offer a long time ago. Think you could help me out with a little bit of that cash? As I said, I hate to ask, but I’m kinda in a spot.”\n\nMy heart raced when he mentioned the money. Suddenly my mind was filled with memories of the man in the alley that had assaulted me. I couldn’t open my mouth to answer.\n\n“Just a couple of dollars would help,” he said, pushing his wiry frame from the ground and stumbling toward me. “Nothing much. Just maybe… whatever you can help me with. I haven’t eaten in days”\n\nI panicked and ran. All logic had left my body. Internally I knew Robert probably wasn’t dangerous, but my mind couldn’t keep itself under control. My legs didn’t stop until I made it into my building.\n\nMy daily walk to work was a thing of the past. I started taking cabs again. That morning on the sidewalk was the last time I saw Robert.\n\nAlive, anyway.\n\n\\* \\* \\* \\* \\*\n\nIt was already dark when I got home to my apartment from work. Four months had passed since I fled Robert on the sidewalk. Putting the key into the lock and pushing my apartment door open, I was hit with an overwhelming stench as though food had spoiled on the counter.\n\nConfused, I slapped the light switch to illuminate the entryway of my home. Dull white light washed across my sterile apartment. Nothing in view would have caused such a terrible odor. I turned to lock the door when I heard the voice behind me.\n\n“James,” said a familiar voice. “You couldn’t have helped me out with a few bucks?”\n\nI turned in a panic and saw Robert standing before me in my apartment. He looked… worse than the last time I had seen him. His skin was stretched even more tightly over the tight muscles of his body. Both of his eyes were milky and his clothes were in shreds.\n\n“What the hell are you doing in my apartment?” I said in shock. “Get out before I call the police!”\n\nRobert laughed, expelling a noxious odor that drifted across the space between us.\n\n“Call ‘em,” he said calmly. “I’m dead, buddy. Starved on the street. You said you’d help, but the one damn time I asked, you said no.”\n\nI turned back toward the door to unlock it, but the latch wouldn’t turn. No matter how hard I struggled, the deadbolt wouldn’t budge. Hot bile was building up in my throat as I scrambled to escape. Footsteps padded up the hallway toward me as I struggled with the lock.\n\nTurning back around, I was horrified to see Robert standing only feet away from me. The stench of rot was overwhelming. He opened his mouth to speak and I could see the writhing maggots crawling over his tongue.\n\n“That’s okay, though,” he said, cold breath blowing out of his mouth. “Soon you’ll lose everything, too. You’ll know what you denied me.”\n\n“Robert… please…” I begged.\n\n“You’ll lose it all.” He said before fading from my vision. “Just like me.”\n\n\\* \\* \\* \\* \\*\n\nAfter seeing Robert’s phantom for the first time, I made appointment after appointment with mental health providers. They questioned me about my “hallucinations” but never found a diagnosis. I did my best to explain to them what I was experiencing, but they were at a complete loss.\n\nRobert followed me everywhere, slowly decaying. Sometimes he talked to me, while others he just watched silently. It was maddening to be pursued by a walking corpse, but oddly, I became used to it.\n\nMy acceptance of his constant presence only caused Robert to double down on his efforts. I sat in my apartment eating dinner and watching television one evening. The rotting man sat in a chair a few feet away from me, watching me eat. He hadn’t spoken to me in days and it was clear to him that I had grown reluctantly used to him being there.\n\n“How’s the food, James?” he asked in a wet, heavy voice. “Looks pretty good! Steak and potatoes, is it?”\n\nI ignored him and kept my eyes on the television.\n\n“Ya know, one of the worst parts about my last few months was not bein’ able to get fresh food,” he muttered. “Had to eat out of the garbage can most days. Spoiled food. Tasted awful. Constantly had food poisoning.”\n\nI remained silent.\n\n“I think that’s what’s next for ya, Jimmy,” he stated. “No more fresh food for you.”\n\nThe mouthful of steak I was chewing suddenly shifted flavors. All of the savory taste vanished and was replaced by the sharp tang of decay. I had never tasted spoiled food before, but the taste in my mouth matched the smell of every past-date item of food I had ever smelled.\n\nI retched onto the table in front of me. Chewed food and spittle covered the plate. I looked down at it to see all of the food looked perfectly safe to eat, but the acrid smell of rot filled my nose.\n\nFrom that day forward, every piece of food I put in my mouth tasted like it was expired. My weight dropped rapidly as I was unable to stomach more than a few bites a day of the rancid-tasting stuff. My energy dropped just as quickly. Patches of my hair began to turn gray and my skin began to develop flaky patches from the malnutrition.\n\nHe took away my ability to sleep, too.\n\nDuring the nighttime, Robert’s decaying frame sat in a chair in the corner of my room. His eyes were almost completely gone now, turned to a disgusting grey jelly. His jaw was beginning to sag as the muscles holding it in place began to disintegrate. \n\n“Hard to sleep on the streets, James,” he said in a garbled voice. “Constantly noisy. People screaming. Car horns honking. Rats crawling all over you. Damn near impossible to stay warm. I think it’s time for you to enjoy that as well.”\n\nBefore I could respond, the left side of his jaw detached from his head and flopped against his chest. From the gaping maw in his face poured the nighttime sounds of the city: screaming voices, car horns, and the scurrying of vermin.\n\nTucked under my thick comforter, suddenly all warmth left my body. It was as though I were outdoors during December in shorts and a t-shirt. I shivered deeply.\n\nNo matter how many layers of clothes or how many blankets I put on the bed, I never had a warm night of sleep again.\n\nI tried using earplugs, but the overwhelming sound from Robert’s rotted maw filled my ears.\n\n\\* \\* \\* \\* \\*\n\nThings fell apart rapidly from that point.\n\nMy lack of sleep, malnutrition, and unhealthy appearance caused my job performance to drop. I couldn't keep my work done and clients no longer felt comfortable meeting with me. The firm fired me. I tried to find a job… any job, but my poor health and appearance kept anyone from hiring me.\n\nAll of my savings had vanished rapidly during my attempts to find medical help.\n\nI ended up on the streets.\n\nLuckier than Robert had been, someone from a shelter in town found me near death in an alleyway. They’ve tried to nurse me back to health, but I can’t explain to them why I can’t eat. They even tried taking me to the hospital for IV fluids but I pull the needles out. The injection site burns as they try to pour the life-saving fluids into my body.\n\nRobert just watches me from the corner. I didn’t help him so he won’t allow me to be helped. There is no bargaining with him.\n\n*This is all going to be over soon,* I can hear his voice say in my head. *You’ve just about paid the price, James.*\n\nI would like to think that he means he will leave me alone, but I know he won’t.\n\nHe said I would lose it all.\n\nI’ve lost almost everything I had, just like Robert did.\n\nThe only thing I have left to lose is my [life.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gtripp14/comments/uyezti/making_it_easier_to_keep_track_of_my_new_releases/)",

        "text": "It was a dark and stormy night, the perfect setting for a good scare. I had always been fascinated by the paranormal and the supernatural, so when I stumbled upon the old abandoned mental hospital on the outskirts of town, I knew I had to explore it.\n\nI had heard the stories, of course. People whispered about the strange and terrifying experiments that had been conducted within its walls, and the unspeakable horrors that had taken place there. But I was determined to uncover the truth for myself.\n\nAs I approached the building, I could feel the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. The windows were boarded up, but I could still make out the eerie glow of something lurking within. I pushed open the door, which creaked loudly on its hinges, and stepped inside.\n\nThe interior was dark and musty, with the only light coming from the beams of my flashlight. I could feel the weight of the silence pressing down upon me, like a physical force. I walked down the hall, my footsteps echoing through the empty building.\n\nSuddenly, I heard a faint whisper. It was coming from one of the rooms at the end of the hall. I cautiously approached the door and pushed it open. The room was empty, but I could still hear the whisper, growing louder and more urgent.\n\nI followed the sound, my heart pounding in my chest. It led me to a room at the very end of the hall, with a sign above the door that read \"Experiment Room.\" I pushed open the door, and the whisper became a scream.\n\nThere was a figure standing in the center of the room, its eyes glowing red in the darkness. I could feel its gaze upon me, and I knew that I was in grave danger. I tried to run, but my legs wouldn't move. I was frozen, completely paralyzed.\n\nThe figure began to move towards me, its eyes never leaving mine. I could feel my heart pounding in my chest, and my mind racing with fear. I was certain that I was going to die.\n\nBut then, something strange happened. The figure stopped in its tracks, and its eyes faded back to their natural color. It was as if it had suddenly realized that I was not the person it was looking for.\n\nThe figure turned and disappeared through the wall, leaving me alone in the room. I was still paralyzed, but the fear had dissipated, replaced by a sense of unease.\n\nI left the hospital as quickly as I could, vowing never to return. But the experience had left me shaken, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and I found myself being drawn back to the hospital. I couldn't explain why, but I felt like I had to return. I knew that it was dangerous, but I couldn't resist the pull.\n\nWhen I arrived, I found that the building was no longer abandoned. The door was open, and I could hear the sounds of laughter and conversation coming from within. I cautiously approached, and found a group of people gathered in the main hall.\n\nThey were laughing and joking, seemingly oblivious to the dark history of the place. I tried to leave, but one of them called out to me.\n\n\"Hey, you're just in time for the show,\" he said with a grin. \"We're about to reenact the famous experiments that took place here.\"\n\nI tried to back away, but they grabbed me and dragged me into the experiment room. I was terrified, but I couldn't resist. I was tied to a chair, and the lights were turned off. The group began to recite an ancient chant, and I could feel the room growing colder. Suddenly, the same figure appeared, its eyes glowing red once again.\n\nI realized that they had summoned it, and I was their sacrifice. The figure moved towards me, and I could feel its breath on my neck. I closed my eyes and braced for the end.\n\nBut then, something even stranger happened. The figure spoke to me, in a voice that seemed to come from the depths of my mind.\n\n\"You are not the one I seek,\" it said. \"But I will spare you this time. Leave this place, and never return.\"\n\nThe ropes that bound me fell away, and I stumbled out of the room and into the night. I ran as fast as I could, not stopping until I was far from the hospital.\n\nI never returned to the abandoned mental hospital, but the experience stayed with me. I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched, and the whisper that I had heard that stormy night continued to haunt me.\n\nWas it all just my imagination, or had I truly encountered something beyond this world? To this day, I still don't know the answer. But one thing is certain, that experience changed me forever, and I am now a true believer in the supernatural and the paranormal.",

        "text": "Now this is something I really want to talk about to be sure that everyone is cautious and stays level headed at all times. Now for context, I lived in the middle of nowhere in Canada. It was an old town that had quite a few abandoned buildings due to absence of residents. Me and many friends were tired of the lack of entertainment options for us, so what we did was explore these abandoned buildings.\n\nPrior to the experience I am about to talk about, we never had anything too crazy happen to us. Occasionally we'd see a small bit of blood like liquid and we did see a pentagram on the ground from someone who went to a house previously, but nothing too bad. Until the last time I had gone exploring abandoned buildings.\n\nNow when I was younger I used to go to a day care that was part mental hospital. Weird combination I know. It closed down due to a lack of patients and lack of children at the daycare. I decided to go back there with my friends a few years ago. For context I was 15 when this happened, most of my friends were the same age.\n\nWhen we did get there it was rather cliché. There was fog, it was rather dark and there was a light drizzle of rain. We went to the main gate which was padlocked shut. We decided to help each other hop over it and made a ton of noise. We were laughing and giggling the whole time, unsuspecting of what was to come. We looked around the small play-place/park with flashlights we had on our person. Even with our somewhat powerful flashlights our visibility was rather limited. We decided to enter the decaying building. Glass and dirt crunched under our feet as we stepped into the daycare section of the complex. There were still old legos, wood chips from previous furniture, old torn dolls and toys strewn about. The further we walked around the daycare section, we naturally became more and more silent, until all we could hear was the crunch of the dirt under our feet. I found some crayons in a plastic container in the corner of the room. I walked over to pick them up, when all the sudden we heard a loud crash coming from behind a metal door leading to the psych ward part of the building. My friends and I all looked at each other. As a whole, we were a group of five, most of them were very bold and cocky. We all looked at each other when my friend 'Brian' suggested we go and look to see where the sound came from. Personally I was not to fond of the idea, but with my group of friends there was no way anyone was going to decline such a thing.\n\nWe all stacked up on the door and opened it. It was rusted to the floor and we heaved to get it open. As we walked in, the metallic smells and must became stronger. With a hint of something else which I couldn't put my finger on at that moment. We walked in, our flashlights pointed in every direction with Brian leading the group. The hallways were tight and to the left and right were the occasional metal doorway, some with doors open. I felt slightly claustrophobic and it felt a little hard to breathe. As we continued, Brian shone his flashlight into a room and recoiled. We all stopped walking as Brian slowly entered the room. \"What is it?\" I asked him. \"I thought I saw someone here. It seems all fine now.\" To be honest I thought he was just messing with us to increase our anxiety. But looking back I think he was completely honest.\n\nHe backed out of the room and we continued walking deeper into the psych ward. When another friend swiftly told us to stop. We came to a halt and all listened. In the distance ahead of us we heard the subtle pitter patter of footsteps echo through the hallway. We all looked at each other, fear in each of our eyes. Brian continued walking toward the sounds, we considered turning back for a second without Brian, wondering if some ghost or something was in the building. But we couldn't do that to him. the closer we got the more I felt like I was being watched. When finally we entered a room on the right which had the smell of rotting meat. In-front of us was a dead deer. Its innards were spilled all over the floor staining the concrete. A friend of mine had a very weak stomach and vomited all over the floor. That's when we heard whispering from somewhere. Brian shone his flashlight to the corner of the room where a man with short hair was standing with his head down. He wore a bright green T-shirt stained with what I assume was blood, and torn beige pants. He did not have any socks and his feet seemed damaged. He was twitching sporadically and continued to mumble even after we saw him. We stared at him for a solid thirty seconds before he made his first true movement. He looked up at us with a haunting grin that sent shivers down our spine. \"You guys here for the feast?\" he said each word with varying inflection and energy. This kicked us over the edge and we bolted out of that room all the way back to the daycare centre. The door was still open and we decided to try and slam it shut, but the rust and pure weight of the door almost kept it open. It took three of us pulling with all of our strength to close it. And just before we did I could still see the silhouette of the man watching us, his white teeth being the only other human feature I could see.\n\nAs we sat behind the metal door catching our breath for a second all looking at each for confirmation that we all saw the same thing. After a little bit of laboured breathing from each of us, we heard a light tapping on the door. Thats when we decided that it was time to leave. We booked it out of the vicinity completely and ran home.\n\nA year after we visited that spot, police went back to do a routine search of the area and found the man. It was stated that this guy used to go to the psych ward before it closed down. He escaped the facility he was transferred to and lived off of the wildlife around the complex. When the cops brought him in, he had a series of diseases and sickness from eating raw meat. His mental condition was much worse than before. There were future rumours that he did kill someone in the forrest while searching for food, but nothing has been confirmed.\n\nIn the end guys. Be careful! Especially in dangerous areas such as abandoned buildings.",

        "text": "I wouldn’t go to sleep right now, even if it were possible. I’m sharing all of this because I don’t know what else to do. Staying awake indefinitely is obviously not sustainable, but I’ll fall off that cliff when I get there. \n\nI woke up in the middle of the night two nights ago to tapping on my window. It’s creepy enough to hear that while living alone, right?\n\nWell, I live in the third story of an apartment. I have no balcony. \n\nThere was no point in calling the police, because they can’t arrest flying people or ghosts, and I would undoubtedly be told that it was all in my head. \n\nSo I wrapped the pillow around my ears and pulled a blanket over my head. It muffled most of the sound. \n\nThe tapping instantly switched to the window on the other side of the room. Like – immediately, as though the person could teleport. \n\nOr if there were two people. \n\nI didn’t sleep that night. \n\nWhen the sun finally rose, I told myself that I’d had an hours-long series of fucked up dreams. I crawled out of bed, not wanting to look at the windows, but knowing that it would ease my mind when a smiling man *wasn’t* hovering thirty feet off the ground. \n\nThere was nothing but the street below. I breathed a sigh of relief.\n\nThen I looked up. \n\nThe pane was covered in fingerprints. Most of them were concentrated around the latch, as though someone had been pushing in their fingers inside, trying to open it up.\n\nI dozed periodically at work. Every time I drifted off, though, I started dreaming of tapping on the window and snapped wide awake. \n\nI told myself that I was going to sleep through the night last night. Hell, I was tired enough. I was out as soon as I hit the pillow. \n\nThe tapping woke me instantly. \n\nI told myself that it was just a series of nightmares. But when it bounced from one window to the next and then back again within a two-second span, enough adrenaline pumped through my chest to assure me that I was not, in fact, sleeping. I peeked my eye over the blanket.\n\nA long, pale finger was squeezing its way through the windowpanes.\n\nI leapt out of bed and slammed the window firmly shut. The finger pulled itself back outside.\n\nI didn’t sleep that night, either.\n\nOnce again, I got braver with the morning light. Once again, I checked the windows.\n\nOnce again, I regretted it.\n\nA streak of blood sat on the pane, shining a dull red in the rising sun. I wanted to puke.\n\nI stumbled to my phone. Police could take a sample, right? As long as I had physical evidence, I could call. I looked down at the screen.\n\nThat’s when I saw the blood on my finger. I raced to the bathroom to wash it off, disgusted that I’d gotten some of it on me after being so careful. I shoved my hand under the faucet, watching the red swirl down the drain. \n\nThe blood didn’t go away.\n\nThat’s because it was *my* finger that was bleeding. \n\nIn the exact same place that I’d slammed the intruder’s finger between the panes.\n\nI wracked my brain, trying to figure out how I could have gotten such a deep gash, but there’s no other explanation.\n\nAnd now it’s nighttime again. I have nowhere else to go, because I have no friends in this city, and earning $19.13 an hour means I cannot afford a hotel.\n\nTyping it all up makes me feel slightly saner, even with an injured finger, because I have no one else to share it with.\n\nAnd I desperately want to distract myself from the knocking sounds [outside my window](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).\n\n[BD](https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/)\n\n\n\n\n[W](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcn_pa1QfNMRzbTuJqXSoRQ)\n\n[E](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/)",

        "text": " I was driving on I-90 through Ohio on my way to visit family in New York when I realized I was almost out of gas with no exits in sight. I sighed, turned off the AC, and started looking for the next exit while praying that God would let me make it to the next gas station.  My car had just started beeping at me because the gas gauge was under the empty line when I saw an exit. It didn't have one of those signs telling me that there was gas, lodgings, food, etc but I didn't have a choice. \n\n  \n  I drove up the exit ramp and turned right toward some cornfields. I finally found a little town with a beautiful BP sign right in the middle and I coasted in on fumes. I'm one hundred percent sure that I used up the last drop of gasoline getting to the pump. It did seem weird to me, though, because I usually get about 350 miles on a full tank of gas and I was sure I hadn't driven that far so I filled up and asked the cashier if there was a mechanic near by. There was: his shop was directly behind the gas station.   \n\n  \n  After a brief conversation with the mechanic, I handed over my keys and went off down the block to the local mom &amp; pop restaurant where I had a delicious meal and sat reading for a while. The mechanic had told me that it would be a few hours before he would know anything, so I had plenty of time. It was such an idyllic little town that I decided to see if there was a park within walking distance. I was thrilled when the waitress told me that there was a playground with some shade trees a few blocks to the east. I picked up my book and the Styrofoam cup she'd put my iced tea in then headed to the park. I smiled and turned left as I passed a sign saying “caution: children at play” and another one saying “par closes at dusk” looking forward to spending some relaxing time before paying a bunch of money and getting back into my car for a few more hours. \n\n  \n  It was a beautiful Saturday afternoon so I expected to see kids playing when I got to the playground and I wasn't disappointed: when I got there, I saw all the typical equipment ringed with benches and surrounded by a chain link  fence. There were probably fifteen kids running, climbing, and swinging inside the playground so I sat on one of the benches under a tree and watched the kids play. I watched as one of the girls ran up to a little boy, tapped his shoulder, and yelled “You're it” before running off in the opposite direction. The boy screamed with delight and ran off after the other child. The whole scene made me laugh along with the kids until the boy caught the girl and the game came to an end.   \n\n  \n  After a few minutes of watching, the little girl came over to me and grinned, showing me her adorable dimples as she did. “Hi, lady.” I greeted her back and laughed as the kids came running over to crowd around us. “Do you want to play with us?” The children all clapped when I nodded and stood up. Their excitement was contagious, and we had the best time running and chasing and laughing until I was out of breath and needed a rest.   \n\n  \n  I made my way over to the bench and took a drink while I pulled out my phone to see what time it was and figure out how much longer before I could go get my car. I was surprised to find that over an hour had passed and then I realized that the sun was low in the sky; it was getting close to dusk. I wondered how strict the town was going to be about the park closing, then quickly dismissed that thought: I didn't even remember there being a gate on the fence. \n\n  \n  After my rest, I jogged back to the middle of the playground to get back into the game just as one of the boys tapped another and yelled “You're it!” By the time that kid tagged a red headed girl, the sun had set and the streetlights were coming on. I took a step back, intending to get my stuff and head back to the mechanic shop as I hear her shout “Here I cooooooome!” I paused for a second because that didn't sound like the voice of a little girl at all. After a glance back over my shoulder confirmed that nothing seems to be unusual, I continued on my way to scoop up my things and then I heard a scream. I immediately turned toward the sound and I saw the red headed girl on top of a smaller boy, her face pressed to his neck. I ran over to try to break them apart and was shocked when I saw blood on the boy's shoulder and the girl's mouth. I yanked the girl away from the boy scolding her, asking what on earth she was doing. As I picked her up, another kid ran close to her and I saw her hand flash out as she grunted “You're it!” The grin on the face of the other child was wrong; very wrong. It was too white and too pointed and too predatory. I dropped the girl who ran away laughing and turned to run to the fence, hoping I could make it to the exit fast enough to avoid getting tagged by the boy with the shark smile. I don't know why I thought getting out of the playground would make me safe, but that's where my mind went, so my body followed.   \n\n  \n  I weaved around a few children on my way across the playground, almost falling over when one of them ran into me, and then I tripped on a stone and crashed into the fence near where I had entered the playground. I was shocked to find that there was, in fact, a gate and it was locked. I couldn't get out and I didn't know what the kids might be capable of if they tagged me. So I ran.   \n\n  \n  I followed the perimeter of the fence, hoping for a way out: an opening in the fence or a hill where the fence wasn't quite so high or something like that. I could hear another child screaming and then there was sudden,deafening silence. When I looked over my shoulder, the children were nowhere to be seen. I picked up my pace, grateful for my years of daily running which kept me from being out of breath because panting would prevent me from hearing the occasional skittering behind me.   \n\n  \n  As the stars came out, I heard a chorus of “Tag! You're it” as the children tagged each other then screams. Another glance over my shoulder showed me that the kids were tackling and biting each other. The tacklers were lapping at the blood from the wounds until the tackled kid escaped and chased down another kid. I made it back around to the locked gate and I thought that the kids had forgotten about me until I saw the kid with the shark smile running my way, still grinning. So, I tossed my bag over the fence and started climbing. It shouldn't have taken me as long as it did to get over a playground fence but it took long enough that the kid was able to grab my ankle and bite my calf. I screamed and kicked downward, dislodging the teeth and feeling a chunk of flesh rip away. I was glad for the lock on the gate when I flipped over the top of the fence and dropped to the ground.   \n\n  \n  When I made it back to my car, the mechanic tended my wound and tutted at me, “Stayed in the park after sunset, didja? You're a lucky one. Next time, pay attention to the signs, jackass.” \n\n  \n  It's been a couple of weeks since then. Of course, no one believed my story. I have a plan, though: I've invited my sister to visit me for a while and we will be driving back through that little town. I'm going to definitely pay attention to the signs and be outside the park before the sun goes down.",

        "text": "It happens mostly at night. I can hear the sound of their skin peeling off their teeth as their lips curl. I don't know what they are. But I know what they sound like. I've seen them. Standing in the corners. Where it is dark. It almost looks as if it is facing backwards. And maybe it is. Or maybe it has mouths on both ends. I never found out. But I know that there's a sound they make when they do smile. I hear it. I even saw it once. These........Mimics.\n\nIt was in my room when it happened. \n\nStick thin and hugging my coat rack. I could hardly make out its shape in the dark. And when I looked directly at it. The Mimic smiled. It sounded like a door creaking. They would usually do this for several minutes. Smile. And then watch me until I fell asleep. But this time something was different. My fire detector blinked red three times and beeped. It was the first time I ever saw one of them move after smiling. \n\nThe Mimic tilted its head and stopped smiling. We both waited without moving again. Not until the alarm beeped again. This caused the Mimic to smile, except this time as its lips spread. I heard a beep. The sound was wrong. And I think it knew this because it suddenly stopped smiling, and we waited again. \n\nThe smoke detector beeped.\n\nThe Mimic smiled, \"Beep.\"\n\nIt sounded closer this time.\n\nWe waited.\n\nI could hear the air in my room.\n\nThe red light blinked. One. Two. ~~\"Beep.\"~~\n\nIt then got close to my face. Closer than any of them had before. And it beeped again.\n\nI could hear footsteps coming from outside in the hallway. I only took my eyes off the Mimic for a second to look. But it was gone as my Mom threw open my door. I started crying before she could yell at me for not hearing that noise. \"What? Did you want to die from getting burned up?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the most part. The Mimics go away if I can find other people. Though sometimes they have gotten close. They also don't like the sunlight, even if there are enough shadows for them to hide in. And it seems like no one else can see them.\n\nBut then something changed. I don't know if it came from our side or theirs. But one of them started behaving differently. Broke all the rules. If there were ever rules to begin with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt started one day when I noticed a Mimic standing near my school. I watched it walk into a small gap that was between two temporary classrooms that had been setup. We weren't allowed to squeeze through it, but most of us did anyways. The old pop up buildings had been there for ages. And it was the fastest way to get through campus, without having to go all the way around. Some of the younger teachers even admitted to doing the same thing when they were students here. So that rule of keeping out, wasn't exactly enforced. Not until what happened.\n\nThis one kid. Reggie. I didn't know him too well. Was up first. I tried to warn him. Tell him not to go. But he didn't listen. I even threatened to tell the teachers on him. But all that did was turn everyone against me.\n\nSomeone pushed me down. And yanked on my backpack.\n\nI was picking the small rocks from where the ground scraped up my hand. Some of them were stuck against the pieces of dead skin that made it look as if I were peeling. There was blood forming in the deeper layer. I could see it. And then a breathing. Except the breathing wasn't mine. I could hear the panic when Reggie called out, \"Hey.\" Hear him struggling. \"I'm stuck.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What?\" \n\n\"Come on.\" \n\n\"Hurry up.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReggie flailed his arms. I could hear his elbows striking the hollow wood buildings.\n\n \n\n\"What are you doing,\" someone else complained.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReggie's head turned as far as his body would allow. I could see him finally realizing the situation he was in. The Mimic was pressed against him. Not letting him through, or back out.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" The others asked in confusion. One of the girls near the back of the line left.\n\n\"Come on,\" a tall curly haired kid said. \"We're going to be late for class.\" He pushed forward and cut the line. \n\nThe other kids crowded around the opening in a half circle as the curly haired boy disappeared inside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Hey! Let me go man!\"\n\n\"Get out of the way,\" the taller kid complained. \"I said move!\"\n\n\"I can't! What the hell is wrong with you,\" Reggie screamed. \"I told you. I'm stuck!\"\n\nThe taller kid pulled on Reggie's leg. \"Get down you fucking dipshit.\"\n\nReggie yelped.\n\nI could hear the two of them struggling inside. By now more kids had come. From the distance I could see Ms. Marin come rushing over. More kids following behind her.\n\n\"Put your hands down,\" the taller boy yelled at Reggie.\n\n\"I can't!\"\n\nThere were so many people now that I couldn't see inside the gap anymore. Especially not when Ms. Marin finally came over and tried to reach her hand inside. She kept yelling, \"Give me space.\" As the other kids swarmed her.\n\nShe didn't have to say it for long.\n\nBecause someone screamed. And then everyone ran.\n\nMs. Marin was the only person left standing there, and she was covered in blood. Her entire blouse was a bright red, and all the color was drained from her face as she pressed her cheek against the side of the building. Her arm still halfway in it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen the police finally arrived. They were able to pull out the bodies. Reggie wasn't dead. But he might as well have been. The way he looked. The way he hasn't talked since.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've slept with all of my lights on for weeks after that. Terriffied; I hide a flashlight under my pillow. But perhaps I wasn't scared enough. Because I let it catch me in the dark.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy cousin had invited me to a sleep over. It was only the two of us, and she was a heavy sleeper.\n\nMeanwhile I woke up at every sound.\n\nAnd it was some time past 2 O'Clock when the TV is still, and the screen asks in a lonely glow, if we wanted to play the next movie. When I saw it standing in the corner of the living room. It wasn't my house, but I was familiar enough ' to know that there was suppose to be nothing in that corner. But it wasn't the surprise of seeing a Mimic that made me wish I could die. No. That already terrifies me. It was seeing the One from school.\n\nI recognized this One immediately. How wouldn't I? Its image has been permanently scarred into my brain. Every side eye. Creature hurry. Parent doorway standing. Younger sibling sneaking. Shadow. Reminded me of this particular Mimic. And I knew it was this one. Because the way it moved. Its size. It was much wider than any of the others. And the feeling of dread that locks me in place. Too afraid to move a muscle. Waiting for me to run out of air until my lungs gasp like an inaudible scream.\n\nThe Mimic looked at me. It opened its mouth. But it didn't smile. Instead a low hissing returned. And I knew. That must have been what I sounded like.\n\nAll I could do was beg when it came toward me. I must have screamed loud enough because it woke up my cousin. This mimic didn't even care. It threw her aside. She hit the wall. I could hear her skull crush. It was so loud that I heard my uncle getting out of bed. The light clicked on upstairs. The Mimic froze\n\n\"What are you girls doing down there?\"\n\nI wanted to scream.\n\nThe Mimic tilted its head a little towards the stairs. And in my cousin's voice it said, \"Nothing daddy. We're just getting ready to go to sleep.\"\n\n\"Alright. Now. Get to sleep. Don't make me come down there.\"\n\nThe Mimic smiled, \"Don't worry! We won't make a sound.\"\n\nI heard my uncle talking. But my eardrums were pounding in my head. I couldn't hear what he said. The light clicked off, because suddenly it was dark again. And the Mimic just looked at me the entire time as it backed away. Smiling. Slowly going back into a corner. Further. Until its mouth closed.\n\nI was afraid it would come back if I didn't keep its word. If I made a sound. So I crawled back into my sleeping bag. And laid there on my side. Awake the entire time. Even as the sun came up. My aunt coming down the stairs. Bacon. The dog licking the side of my cousin's bleeding head. And the screaming. When they found my cousin dead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that night. The One from school would come to my room. Every day. Locking me inside as much as it could. Isolating me in my house. Keeping my parents on the other side of the door. Smiling the entire time they tried to talk to me. \"I don't want to talk. No! I'm fine. I said I was Fine,\" it would say in my own voice. Things I never mean.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst the Mimic spread a rumor. My dad was the only one who heard it. \n\n\"Uncle Jonnie came downstairs that night.\"\n\n\"Yeah. He came downstairs to check on you. Honey. Can you open the door?\"\n\n\"Yeah. He came downstairs to yell at us.\"\n\n\"What? Honey. Come on. Open the door.\" He paused. \"Yelled at you guys for what?\"\n\n\"That we had to keep his secret.\"\n\nI could almost picture him on the other side. The way the words rolled slowly out of his mouth. \"What secret?\"\n\n\"That he came downstairs twice.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen it made me sound as if I hated my parents. For weeks. Cursing at them through the door. Blaming them. Laughing, and screaming. Smiling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd then it did something to me. In the morning. Months after our family had begun tearing apart. Nothing but yelling and arguing. So much that when the Mimic did let out me out of my room. I couldn't stand it anymore. And started doing it all back. Like my mind had become so consumed by the Mimic's sound of my own voice that I started speaking the words it had been saying. And that's when the Mimic knew it had me. That's when it knew to pick up the phone and call my mom one day when no one was home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I'm sorry mom. Good bye.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was all it said before I blacked out. \n\nWhen I woke up, the doctor said I had incredibly long lacerations up my arm. I had missed major arteries but I still lost a lot of blood. \n\nAnd when they asked me what happened. No one believed a single word. They all thought I was crazy. Several times in fact, I tried to show them the Mimic responsible. Tried to explain to them that it wasn't me who said any of those horrible things. Or did anything to myself. But none of it worked. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShortly after my hospitalization, my parents had me admitted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was some weeks inside. I can't remember it's difficult to track time here. When I finally saw one again. It moved slower. And was smaller than the the One from school. But there was a girl nearby. Sitting in a rounded loungers that caught my attention. She was staring directly at the corner where the Mimic was standing. Staring it right in the eyes.\n\nI turned to her and asked, \"Can you see them too.\"\n\nShe looked around, almost as if shaking her head. \"Yes.\"\n\n\"You can see them,\" I almost cried. \"How long have you been able to see them?\"\n\n\"Years.\" Her head jerked erratically as she tried not to concentrate on them in the corner.\n\n\"What are they? Do you know?\"\n\nHer head kept shaking.\n\n\"Have you been able to figure anything out? Do you have any advice?\"\n\nAnd for the first time since the Mimic appeared. This girl stopped moving. She turned to look at me and said, \"Don't smile back.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[s](https://www.reddit.com/r/CornerCornea/comments/u6rx8n/subscribe/)",

        "text": "After a long day of school, a part-time job, and Trigonometry homework, I laid down in bed to rest. I went on TikTok to scroll for some entertainment before I put my phone to charge and went to rest. Most videos are the same; People talking about their boring lives, a police officer committing murder, a Chinese spy balloon in the sky, but there was one specific genre that always made me instantly scroll away. Reddit stories that are horribly captioned over gameplay clips.\n\nThey are truly the most mind numbing forms of content on the app, purely designed to engage viewer time and comment activity. After six consecutive videos, just like every other reddit story video, I put my phone on my desk and plugged it in. I closed my eyes and tried to think of nothing. Nothing. That's all I thought of when I fell asleep, but my brain has whirred up a nightmare that it will not let me wake up from. I slowly opened my eyes and looked up at the night sky; It was dark, but the sky was littered with stars. I lived in an urban setting, so this startled me. I had never seen this many stars in the sky.\n\nI slowly stood up and took in my surroundings. I was on a train track. Three tracks parallel to each-other sat on a sandy strip of land that seemed to stretch to infinity in both directions. On each side of the track were buildings so condensed that there weren't even alleyways between them. Each track was completely empty, no trains in sight. I stared down the hypnotizing infinity of the tracks and realized I had to be dreaming. One, two, three, four, five. I counted my fingers, they were all there. I had learned of techniques of lucid dreaming, I'd often try to lucid dream before but nothing ever worked. I immediately burst with hope, trying to control my surroundings. Nothing worked.\n\nNo matter how hard I tried to fly, or explode something, or even just wake up, nothing happened. This setting looked oddly familiar to me, but I couldn't quite place my finger on it. After maybe 10 minutes of waiting, which honestly felt like an eternity, the sky lit up. The sun immediately appeared in the sky, forcing me to shield my eyes from it's brightness. There was no sunrise, it was just there. I felt the tracks start to vibrate. Music began to play, soft, calming music, that sounded very familiar to me. I had heard this music just minutes...or hours...before I woke up here. It was on my phone. Suddenly, a monochrome robot voice boomed from the sky. \"After a long day of school, a part-time job, and Trigonometry homework, I laid down in bed to rest.\" I shielded my ears from the sheer volume from the voice, but it didn't matter. \n\nIt continued, \"I went on TikTok to scroll for some entertainment before I put my phone to charge and went to rest.\" I immediately realized what was happening. This dream was the last memory I had before falling asleep, a mind numbing social media video from my phone had manifested into this hellscape of a dream. My thoughts were cut off by the blaring horn of a train. Right in front of me, a bright light was rushing towards me, a train. I jumped to my left, narrowly dodging it, but I could hear more coming. I ran.\n\nI ran as fast as I could, but it didn't seem to matter. The trains kept coming, the music kept playing, the monochrome description of my life...even to the position I'm in right now...continued to play. Wake up, wake up, wake up, I racked my brain for anything about waking yourself up from a dream, but nothing changed. The voice had began to narrate events that hadn't even occurred to me yet. Something it said interested me: \"I finally found it. After hours of running on this goddamn track I saw the red door. I ran for it, but a train was closing in behind me, just like the voice had told me hours ago. I narrowly opened the door and dove in. The phone was sitting on the table in there, my salvation.\"\n\nI immediately began scanning my surroundings for a 'Red Door,' but nothing matching that description was anywhere near me. Only monotone yellow concrete houses, with windows glowing a light with no diminishable source. I kept running. Exhaustion kicked in, I got tired, if this was a dream then why would I get tired? More importantly, if this is a dream....could I just let one of the trains hit me, and then I'd wake up? It did make sense, but I'd rather not test it. The monochrome voice continued to repeat the same story on loop, my story.\n\nMinutes turned to hours. I couldn't take it anymore. The concept of letting a train hit me became ever-promising. Just when I lost hope, I saw a tiny dot of red in the distance. Amongst the insanity of those concrete houses, I finally found it. After hours of running on this goddamn track I saw the red door. I ran for it, but a train was closing in behind me, just like the voice had told me hours ago. I narrowly opened the door and dove in. The phone was sitting on the table in there, my salvation. I picked it up, just as I was foretold many... many times. I opened the only app in the phone and made an account. I went to the place where I knew these bot accounts got their stories from, and I began to type. \n\nTikTok Reddit videos are ruining my mind.",

        "text": "So I've been married to my husband (let's call him Charlie) for a year now. Charlie is an amazing husband, but he's not the man I want. This all started when I started reading again. Like romance books. And EVERY SINGLE guy in those books is my dream man. I've only met 3 men like that in my life. Everything that I've ever wanted in a man I put into a list. It's all little things like dancing in the rain or teaching me about his hobbies or wearing matching pajamas at Christmas time. It's little things. But as I've written that list, I came to realize that Charlie does none of the things on that list.\n\nHe forgot about our 1 year anniversary. He didn't acknowledge valentines or Christmas last year. He forgot about my birthday. He only remembered because he heard my mom say it to me over the phone. If I try to learn about his video games, he gets frustrated because I don't understand certain things and then proceeds to say \"forget it\" or \"whatever\". He doesn't communicate properly and just shuts down but will get upset if I shut down.\n\nI've tried talking to him and he says he hates (his words) all that romance stuff. And I feel like our relationship is purely sexual. He complains when we don't have intercourse for two weeks and then I feel like I have to give in. He's called me annoying at times too.\n\nIt feels like he doesn't care about the relationship emotionally, and it hurts me. I've communicated all of this with him and all he responds with is \"idk what to say\". He barely shows emotions too. Im not sure if this is a result of him being in the army or not but it hurts. Also, I've met army men (same MOS and everything) who are literal sweethearts and actually give off emotions.\n\nMy ex (let's call him James) was an amazing person and still is. The reason I broke up with him is because he is 10 years older than me and I got a lot of hate for it.\nWe are still friends (Charlie knows. He's says he doesn't care). He and I dated for a year before I broke things off. James has most of not every single one of the traits I want in a man. He's stated before that he still loves me but he's respecting my relationship.\n\nThe reason I haven't left Charlie is because:\n1. I do love him. I really do.\n2. I'm a housewife who stupidly didn't sign a prenup and had no where to go. No money or anything.\n3.

        "text": " A few days ago I purchased a new phone at the Best Buy near my house. I’ll admit, I’ve never been a connoisseur when it comes to buying new gadgets; not because I’m technologically illiterate, rather I just never cared to keep up with what was “in style.” That’s why when I entered the store, I headed straight for the cheapest phone I could find—a Samsung Galaxy A13—and brought it to the counter.\n\nThe nice girl who was helping me check-out asked if I wanted to upgrade from 32 gigabytes to 64 for an extra $100, and I declined. I’m not hurting for money—I have plenty saved up from years of working as a private home inspector—but nearly doubling the sale price for some extra storage seemed a bit ridiculous. I picked a case off the shelf and added it to the receipt, then left satisfied that I no longer had to type around a black smudge that was pinned to the bottom of the screen of my last phone.\n\nAnyway, A couple days passed before I started the routine process of purging all the sponsored apps that come pre-installed on the device. I was actually about to head out for a coffee run when I felt the urge to purge, so I started thumbing through each of the square logos and clicking “uninstall.” I made it through the majority of predictable offenders: Bubble Pop, Chess Lite, Facebook, when I came to one that didn’t have an uninstall option. Now, I know there’s some apps germane to the OS which can only be force-stopped and not uninstalled, but I didn’t think an app with the name “Lucky Day Bingo,” would apply.\n\nI did some Googling, but I couldn’t find any information on the game anywhere. Then I searched the App store but also had no luck. It was like the game was solely created for my phone.\n\nNow, I know this all screams “don’t play the weird game,” and it may even warrant a, “return that phone right now!” but I’m a curious guy, and really, what harm could some random app on my phone cause? So, as I laced up my boots and threw on a coat, I navigated back to the app page and clicked on the image of a golden crown on top of a 5x5 bingo board.\n\nA terms of service file popped up, and under any other circumstance I would have blindly pressed “Accept,” but this wasn’t any other circumstance. I read (okay, skimmed) through the ToS and couldn’t find anything alarming or malicious, so I accepted and continued to the game’s home page. \n\nThe game’s design was fairly simplistic. Actually, even though I’ve never been into mobile games, nor any video games of any kind for that matter, I could still tell that the graphics were old. It had all the hallmarks of a 2010 cliché: The big, bold title at the top of the page reading “Lucky Day Bingo,” around which the jaws of a treasure chest opened and closed while leaking gold coins down along the sides of the front page’s option bubbles like something you might see in an old casino or a Chuck-E-Cheese. \n\nI couldn’t help myself from smirking as I thought about how goofy the game looked. What would my wife think if she saw me playing something like this? Probably nothing, but I suddenly felt a bit of shame, as if I was doing something wrong. Like I was a kid looking at something I shouldn’t. The feeling was so sudden and intense, I actually considered closing the app right then and there, but I had read over the three options and was curious about the one labeled “Rules.” I clicked it, and the following popped up in a box similarly styled as the front page.\n\n*Welcome to Lucky Day Bingo! It’s Your Lucky Day!*\n\n*The rules are as follows:*\n\n*The user (you) will begin with a standard 5x5 bingo board. Each of the board’s 25 spaces, except for the center “Free Space,” will be covered to hide the prompt. The user will then click “Toss” to flip a coin randomly onto one of the covered squares. That square will then reveal a task and a reward.* \n\n*The user will be responsible for completing the aforementioned task within the allotted time window. If the user completes the task, he/she will earn the posted award. If the user fails to complete the task, the reward will be deducted from the user’s balance.*\n\n*The user may also “Skip” a task. However, in the same way that failing to complete a task within the allotted time window will result in the reward deducting from the user’s balance, skipping a task will meet with the same penalty.*\n\n*The game is won when a player achieves Bingo, or completes 5 spaces in a row or 4 plus free space.*\n\n*The prize for Bingo is $100,000,000*\n\n*Happy Playing! :-)*\n\nI read over the rules several times while cruising toward Starbucks (only at stoplights, of course.) The game seemed simple enough; although, I was concerned with what it meant by “tasks.” Would the game ask me to perform real-life actions? Because I wasn’t willing to do that. Or so I thought.\n\nI returned to the home page and clicked on the only other option beside *Play—*at the bottom of the list was a bubble which read “Contact Us.” However, when I clicked it, a blank page popped up. What’s the point of having a “Contact Us” tab if you don’t want anyone to contact you? Dumb.\n\nAt this point I was rapidly losing interest in what seemed like a total gag, but I decided to click Play anyway and see what would happen. Worst case, I’d have a story to tell this weekend at the family get-together in Utah. A little filler conversation between the bouts of wisdom my in-laws would so graciously impart to me.\n\nThe board popped up, and I was immediately reminded of online Chess. Only instead of two colors, this board was completely black except for the center space which read: *Free Space* and contained another creepy smiley face. In the top corners it read, “Toss a coin to receive a task,” and “Complete the task to win the prize!”\n\nA bubble popped up which read “Do you want to toss a coin? Yes / No.”\n\nI hesitated for a few seconds. I felt that shameful feeling again, like I was doing something gross, and I felt the urge to conceal my phone from whoever was in the back of the car, watching. I spun around, checking the back seats, but no one was there. I took a deep breath and calmed my rapidly beating heart.\n\nI arrived at the Starbucks and parked near the front. It was only 8AM, but the drive through line was packed. I idled for a couple minutes, thinking about whether I should press “Yes” or not. I couldn’t define where the paranoia was coming from, and that made it worse. *It’s just a dumb game*, I told myself, but that didn’t make it better.\n\n“Ugh!” I groaned and clicked “Yes.” I watched a thumb stretch out across the screen and flip a golden coin. It bounced a couple times on the board before landing at the top-most center space. The black tile removed itself from the board and spun around, revealing black letters on a golden background:\n\n*Task: Order a Grande White Chocolate Mocha from Starbucks using the Starbucks App!*\n\n*Time: 1:00:00*\n\n*Reward: $500*\n\nI blinked.\n\nThen it all clicked. I sighed and rubbed my face. This must be like one of those targeted ad things. They keep track of all your data and get you to patronize certain stores or buy things online. Companies pay a premium for these kinds of services. This app must just be a more sophisticated form of that concept. A game that’ll reinforce your purchasing habits for points. Probably there’s some redemption on these points, too.\n\nBut there was something else. How did the game know my drink of choice? I haven’t used my phone to purchase it yet. Hell, I haven’t even downloaded the Starbucks app. Voice recognition? No, because I never said it out loud. Maybe it got the data from . . . my bank account? No, that’s impossible.\n\nRegardless, there was no “completed” option on the screen; therefore, there was no way for the game to know if I actually followed through. I closed the app and started toward the store, intent on finding some way to delete the app later. I was approaching the cashier when I stopped myself and backed up to one of the seats. It’s completely idiotic, but I actually went ahead and downloaded the Starbucks app. What can I say? I was curious. And I was going to download the app anyway, so it might as well be now.\n\nI loaded up my drink, a Grande white chocolate mocha, as well as my wife’s nitro cold brew and checked out. Then I waited. Part of me wanted to see what happened in Bingo, but another part of me didn’t want to know. After all, if the game really did register my purchase, what did that mean? That it had access to my phone? To my Starbucks app? What else did it have access to?\n\nI was in the middle of pondering when I felt my phone buzz. I looked down and saw five numbers flash across the screen, beneath which was a message which read:\n\n*You completed the task! Your reward has been added to your account.*\n\nThen another message from the same number:\n\n*It’s time to flip a coin! Log in to see your next task.*\n\nWhen I clicked on my messages, I saw that below the second text was a link to the game. I clicked it and the familiar 5x5 Bingo board appeared, but this time the space I had completed was right-side up and a golden coin lay shining on top of it. The familiar prompt reappeared in the center of the screen: “Do you want to toss a coin? Yes / No.” I tried to click out of the prompt and see where my points had been tallied, but it wouldn’t let me. The screen was frozen on the prompt.\n\n**Barista:** Online order for Matt!\n\nI looked up, shaken at the sound of my name. Then I relaxed, realizing it was just my drinks. I got up and grabbed the two cups, thanking the barista in the process, and returned to the table I was seated at. I was curious about something.\n\nI clicked out of Bingo and loaded up my banking app. I was about 95% sure I was crazy at this point, but it didn’t hurt to look. I signed in, then navigated to my checking account. \n\nI froze.\n\nIn the latest category it read:\n\n*Lucky Day Bingo                   $500*\n\n*Deposits*   ***\\[redacted\\]***\n\nI was completely dumbfounded. Somehow this game had not only known I had purchased the Starbucks drink, but it was also able to deposit money directly into my bank account. *Which means it can withdraw money, too.* The implication hit me so fast I nearly started dialing my bank’s fraud line right then and there. This was completely absurd.\n\n*But . . . I did just make $500*. \n\nThe voice inside my head didn’t even sound like my own. But, still, it had a point. After all, what really happened? Let’s go through the facts. First, the game had some pretty simple parameters. Toss a coin, complete some tasks, make some money. Second, the tasks didn’t seem to be harming anyone. In fact, it was basically something I was going to do anyway. And third, *I just made real money*. I couldn’t deny the logic was pretty sound. *And if it does ask me to do something bad, I’ll just call the cops*.\n\nSo, I loaded up Lucky Day Bingo and clicked, “Yes.” \n\nOnce again, I saw the thumb stretch over the board and flip a coin onto it. This time, the coin landed directly below the free space. *That’s three in a row, already.* Then a new task appeared:\n\n*Task: Pay it forward. Offer the largest bill in your wallet to a Starbucks cashier and tell him/her to use it to pay for the next customers’ drinks.*\n\n*Time: 00:30:00*\n\n*Reward: A special gift just for you*\n\nI can’t deny that I frowned when I saw this wasn’t a cash reward. Instead, the reward sounded more creepy than anything. A special gift just for me? What the hell did that mean? Still, it was another benign task—helpful, actually—and I figured giving a little back to the system might be in order. I took out my wallet and thumbed through the stack of bills. After making sure it was the largest, I removed a 50 and returned the wallet to my pocket. Then I got up and approached the barista. I could tell he was nervous at first; probably he was afraid that I was disappointed with my order. But that changed when I started talking.\n\n**Me:** Hey, this is probably going to sound weird, but I’d like to give you this to pay for the next customers’ orders. You know, until it runs out. Do you think you could do that?\n\nHe stared at me, astonished.\n\n**Barista:** Um, yeah. Absolutely. Thanks.\n\nHe took the folded bill from my hand.\n\n**Me:** Don’t mention it.\n\nI walked away, offering my best “it’s alright, I swear” smile, then grabbed my drinks off the table and got back in the car. After turning it on and getting some heat flowing, I checked my bank account. No new activity. Then I opened Lucky Day Bingo and saw something new. Instead of the usual prompt asking if I wanted to toss a coin, the screen was dimly locked, and a new box had appeared in the middle with an active countdown which read:\n\n*Time until next toss:*\n\n*10:32:44*\n\nI turned off the display and tossed my phone in the passenger seat. Then I headed home, spending most of the drive mulling over everything that had happened.\n\nWhen I walked inside, I was nearly trampled by our dog, a St. Bernard named Jerry, and my two kids, Vincent, age 9, and Olivia, age 11, who were playing a game of chase. I feigned being angry, then grabbed them both up and spun them around while they laughed and yelled for me to go faster. \n\n**Me:** You don’t want to throw up, do you?\n\n*We do!* They both yelled in unison. \n\nFortunately, there was no need to bring out a mop, and a couple minutes later I was instructing them to go finish their packing before breakfast. Then I brought the drinks into the kitchen where my wife, Rebecca, was cooking up some eggs. I gave her a kiss, then watched her take a sip of the cold brew.\n\n**Rebecca:** By the way, a package came for you.\n\nMy heart sank.\n\n**Me:** Package?\n\n**Rebecca:** Yeah, something from Amazon. You didn’t order anything?\n\n**Me:** Where is it?\n\nRebecca pointed directly behind me where an average sized box was plopped on the center of the counter. I looked it over, and sure enough, my name and address was on the label. Rebecca must have noticed my unease, because she asked,\n\n**Rebecca:** What’s wrong?\n\n**Me:** Oh, um—when did this arrive?\n\n**Rebecca:** Literally five minutes ago.\n\n**Me:** Did you see who dropped it off?\n\n**Rebecca:** No, they rang the doorbell and left it there. I only saw the Amazon van as it drove off. Why? What’s the matter?\n\nI walked over and grabbed a pair of scissors from the arts and crafts jar, then cut open the Amazon tape and opened the cardboard flaps.\n\nNow, I should mention that I have many hobbies: fishing, hiking, language learning—and photography. I was actively involved in the school paper as a photographer growing up, and the passion extended to sports photography in college, and nature shots in my adult life. However, ever since my wife and I had Olivia and then Vincent, the amount of time I’ve been able to dedicate to the craft has significantly diminished. Additionally, I am still using the same decade-old camera that I got as a gift just before Olivia was born. Around maybe two years ago, I created an Amazon wish-list and started adding things I thought would be fun to get after the kids fly the nest. One of those items was a Canon EOS R6 Mirrorless camera.\n\nI lifted the box from the packaging and set it on the table.\n\n**Rebecca:** You ordered a camera?\n\nI didn’t respond. Couldn’t respond. I left the box on the counter and ran to the front of the house and looked out the window. My wife called after me but didn’t follow. I moved to the front door and walked outside, looking around. We lived in the suburbs in Wisconsin—a nice area. The sun was up, but no one was out. I went back inside.\n\nHow in the hell did they order and deliver a package within ten minutes? It’s impossible. They either ordered it preemptively, days ago, or delivered it themselves. *Which means they’re out there*. I peered back through the windows venetian blinds. My heart was like a thirty foot tall metronome in my chest. *No.* It couldn’t have been ordered preemptively. The timing is too perfect. Down to the minute. I hardly realized I was grabbing one of the blinds and it bent in my hand.\n\n*Just calm down.*\n\nI collected my laptop which was nearby on one of the family room tables, then returned to the small couch in front of the window and logged on. Fortunately, our house had a Ring doorbell, so I was able to log into the application and view the recording of the drop-off. I watched anxiously as the van approached and parked alongside our driveway. Then a young man, no older than 25, stepped out of the van with the box under his right armpit. He jogged up to our door, left the package on the step, rang the doorbell, then returned to the van and drove off.\n\nI replayed the video twice, but I couldn’t find anything suspicious. Still, it’s saved in case I need to bring it to the authorities later. Which brings me to what I should do now. As I write this, I’m only an hour away from embarking on a 2 day road trip to Salt Lake City with my family. I’m actually glad to be getting out of the area now. I feel tense. Still, I’m not sure what to do about the app. A part of me wants to go to the cops, but what would I tell them? Some omniscient app is paying me cash and buying me gifts to buy Starbucks drinks? I’ve considered telling my wife, but I still feel that shame from before. And then there’s the part of me that wants to keep playing. To see where this all goes.\n\nLet me know your opinions and I’ll try to keep you updated on what happens.\n\n*P.S. In the box with the camera was an envelope with an enclosed piece of cardboard which read the following:*\n\n*Enjoy :-)*",

        "text": "The warm glow of the campfire shimmered off of Lake Deerhead’s surface, providing the only notable source of light on an otherwise overcast August night. A few feet away, back towards our cabin, I could see fireflies buzzing listlessly through the air, flickering in and out of sight. The woods surrounding us were alive with the noise of crickets chirping, frogs croaking, and owls cooing. A perfect, peaceful, and relaxing evening with nature.\n\n“I’m. So. Bored!” Mia yelled, kicking over the three cans of hard seltzer at the foot of her lawn chair, getting a chuckle out of me, but eyerolls from Andrew and Kelly.\n\n“And what do you want me to do about that, Mia?” Andrew asked, tilting his head back with a sigh. \n\n“I don’t know. Something?” She replied.\n\n“I already started this stupid fire, which again, is banned in the leasing agreement. What else do you want?”\n\nKelly gave her boyfriend a worried look. “Yeah, actually, should we be concerned about that at all, or…?”\n\nAndrew waved her off. “It’ll be fine. It said something about fire disturbing the wildlife, but that just seemed like some bullshit to get out of paying the license fee or whatever with the fire marshall. I can sweep the ash into the lake tomorrow morning. No one will be the wiser.” \n\n“Sure…” Kelly nodded, clearly not reassured\n\n“Guys, I think we’re missing the bigger point here. Which is that I’m bored. Let’s do something,” Mia continued to prod.\n\n“Mia, it’s 11 at night and we’re in the middle of the woods. What else is there to do besides drink and stare at the fire?”\n\nI decided to jump in at this. “We could do ghost stories. Unless L’il Andwew is afwaid of ghosts.”\n\nHe glared at me. “Stop dating my sister.”\n\n“Make me,” I replied, flashing a smirk at Mia. She rolled her eyes, but I could see a blush forming on her cheeks. We’d been dating for a few months at this point and even though Andrew had come to accept it, I could tell the idea of his best friend dating his younger sister irked him to no end. My opinion was, if he didn’t want this to happen then he shouldn’t have such a beautiful sister and such a charming friend. What else could he expect, really?\n\n“Ghost stories could be fun,” Kelly said, trying to keep the conversation light. “I don’t know any off the top of my head, but it’s a good night for something like that. Julia, did you have one?”\n\nHer agreement caught me off guard. “Oh, um… No, I was just messing with Andrew because he always gets scared when we watch horror movies around him.”\n\n“I don’t get scared, I just prefer comedies.” Andrew replied. “Anyways, I got nothing for ghost stories. There were some murders and shit that happened in this area that I know about, but not like supernatural stuff or anything.”\n\n“Murders?” Mia asked, suddenly perking up.\n\nAndrew shrugged. “Yeah, guy who’s renting this place to me mentioned something about it in his emails. I ended up looking into them a little.”\n\n“And?”\n\nHe shrugged again. “About what you’d expect. I found articles from a few years back that talked about it. 5, maybe 6, years ago or so. Something like 14 bodies were found, I think.”\n\n“Jesus...” Kelly muttered. I stared Andrew dead in the eyes, looking for any cracks or hints to betray his serious tone. There was nothing.\n\n“Yeah, it was some pretty gruesome stuff from what I read. Torture, dismemberment, some stuff about ritualistically arranging the bodies. They actually found the first victim at this lake. Some couple had been out kayaking one evening and saw a foot float by them. Game wardens swept the lake and found the rest of him in about 12 different pieces. Everyone thought it was a mob hit or something, until a month later when they found the second body in the woods by that general store we passed. Same deal, 12 different pieces, but this time they were arranged in a circle around a tree.”\n\n“Oh God…” Mia whispered. I could feel the air around us grow colder and the noises of the forest grow louder. I leaned in closer to the fire, now fully drawn into Andrew’s story.\n\n“Pattern kept going for months. New bodies chopped to bits were found all over these woods. Some were men, some were women, some locals, some tourists. The cops were useless and couldn’t find any pattern or reasoning behind the killings. Just the ceremony stuff. It got so bad that a bunch of locals started moving out of town. Everyone that stayed loaded up with guns and ammo, just waiting for the guy to strike. Then, about a year and a half in, the killings just sort of stopped. No more people went missing and no more bodies were found. Poof. It’s like the guy who’d done it all had just up and disappeared without a trace. Nothing happened after that, no more killings here and they couldn’t find any similar crimes happening elsewhere. It all just stopped.”\n\n“Wait, so did they ever catch the guy?” Kelly asked, seemingly terrified of the answer.\n\n“Nope. Never even released an FBI profile like they do with some serial killers. There are a couple of theories floating around out there about it. Mostly dumb shit, like it was a vengeful spirit or a top secret government experiment running amok. Like I said, pretty dumb shit. But one of the things I read actually stuck out and got me interested\n\n“Yeah…?” I asked, now leaning so close to the fire my hair might singe. \n\n“The owner of the place actually put me on to the theory. See, because the first body was found in the lake, people assumed that the guy had to be from this area. Might even live on the lake. This cabin was actually abandoned at the time of the killings, the current owner wouldn’t buy it for another few years. So like, an abandoned cabin in the middle of nowhere? What better place to go on a murder spree. No witnesses, no paper trail tying you to the place. And it makes sense how he could just up and leave without anyone noticing. Besides, when the heat dies down and people start to forget about you… Makes it all the easier TO COME BACK!”\n\nHe screamed the last part while kicking one of the bottom logs of the fire, sending a plume of sparks dancing into the sky. I yelped, leaping back into my cheap lawn chair and almost falling over. Across from me I could see Kelly doing the same, barely catching herself before tipping over. Andrew threw himself back against his chair, laughing like a maniac.\n\nI sat bolt upright, almost leaping across the fire at him. “Fuck you! God! Was any of that true?”\n\n“Not a fuckin’ word,” He said, trying to stifle his laughter. “Why would a landlord tell me his cabin had a serial killer squatting in it? What kind of marketing is that?”\n\n“God you’re such an asshole,” Kelly replied, playfully punching his arm.\n\n“You guys were the ones saying you wanted a ghost story. Well I’d say that worked pretty well.”\n\nI steadied myself in the chair, letting out a long exhale before responding. “It was ok. Ending was a little rushed.”\n\n“Come on, that was on the spot. You try ramping up to a decent reveal like that.” \n\nKelly continued to punch and prod at him, turning his attention away from me. Not interested in their flirting, I glanced back at Mia. She was ignoring all of us, instead staring out across the water towards the far shore of the lake. I followed her line of sight. Our cabin was situated on a small cove along the southern portion of Lake Deerhead, making it possible to see clear to the otherside, at least during the day. A thick cover of clouds had kept the moon and stars hidden all night, and the fire’s reflection off the water’s surface could only illuminate so much at that distance. Trees mostly, with some rocks by the water's edge. Nothing of particular interest.\n\n“Hey Mia, what are you looking at?” I asked, stepping towards her and putting a hand on her shoulder.\n\n“I, uh… I’m not really sure, but… Does that look like a person to you?” She said, pointing across the lake. “Like, right up by the edge of the water?”\n\nI squinted in the direction she was pointing. At first, the only things visible were the shadows of pine trees clustered into thick rows, and the thin rocky shore that lined most of the lake. As I continued to stare and my eyes adjusted to the faint light, a separate shape came into focus. A silhouette stood out just above the rocks, smaller and less fuzzy than the outlines of the trees. I couldn’t tell exactly how tall, but definitely in the ballpark of human size. The shape looked right, at the very least.\n\n“Hey, Andrew, Kelly?” I asked, still squinting towards the horizon. “Does that look like a person to you guys? On the far side of the lake?”\n\nThey both raised an eyebrow at this, but looked out all the same. The four of us stared out across the water, everyone waiting for someone else to confirm what we all thought we were seeing. Finally, Andrew spoke up. \n\n“I don’t know, I can’t really see anything,” He said.\n\nKelly continued to stare hard at the far shore. “I mean, I think I see what you’re talking about. It’s really hard to tell, but… Yeah, no definitely, that could totally be a person.”\n\n“Hey Andrew, maybe it’s that serial killer you were ‘making-up’,” I said with a smirk.\n\n“Ok, but like, what if we didn’t joke about that?” Kelly responded.\n\n“I still can’t see what any of you guys are talking about,” Andrew continued.\n\n“Well, whatever it is, I’ve officially got the creeps,” Mia said, while getting up from her chair. “Anyone else want to head inside?”\n\nI nodded at her, “Yeah, sure, we can head in.”\n\n“Sounds good to me,” Kelly replied, looking as unnerved as Mia.\n\n“I suppose it’s getting to be about that time,” Andrew agreed.\n\nHe doused the fire with a bucket of water he’d been keeping by his chair and the four of us walked back to the cabin. The cool air from the window unit AC hit us the second we stepped in, blowing away the stale humidity of the lake and woods. After closing the backdoor, Kelly made a beeline towards the main bedroom while Mia and I flopped down onto the couch in the living room. Andrew hung back in the kitchen, emptying the remains of his PBR tallboy into the sink. The cabin had a cozy, one bedroom layout with a combined kitchen/living room and a loft up above the ground floor bedroom. Mia and I had graciously agreed to give Andrew and Kelly the private bedroom, after a brief fight during the car ride up earlier that day. Martyrs, the two of us. \n\nThe interior was what you’d expect from this kind of rental cabin. Wooden floors and walls, a few pieces of hand-carved furniture, one nice throw rug in the center of the living room, and a small stone fireplace with a neat pile of logs stacked next to it. Just about every inch of the walls was covered with some sort of knick knack, mostly paintings of the local wildlife or photos of the lake itself, with the big standout being a large, 8 point bucks head hung above the fireplace. We’d taken to calling him Deerick as a joke, after Kelly vetoed the name Bambi for being ‘too mean’.\n\nI’d been staring off into space for a moment when I noticed Mia playfully nudging me with her foot from the other side of the couch. Egged on by the admittedly fair amount of alcohol in my system, I returned fire by flicking at the tops of her toes. She giggled and kicked harder at my leg. Finally, with no options left but to end this assault once and for all, I stood up over her, pinned her legs with both hands, and gave her a quick peck on the cheek. She grabbed the back of my head, cutting off my retreat, and with a coy smile pulled me in for a longer, more passionate kiss. \n\n“Can you two throw a tarp over yourselves if you’re going to do that?” Andrew asked from the kitchen. “Just for decency's sake?” \n\nWe both looked up and Mia flipped him off with her free arm. “Eat shit and die, asshole.”\n\nKelly poked her head out of the bedroom, eager for a front row seat to this new round of sibling bickering. Andrew stepped behind her and wrapped her in a bear hug.\n\n“You see? You see how they treat me?” he asked, kissing the top of her forehead.\n\nMia gagged and yelled back, “Oh so you get to do it, but we don’t? Hypocrite much?” \n\n“It’s cute when I do it.”\n\n“It’s sick and perverse.”\n\n“Can you two please stop fighting in front of Deerick?” I butted in, wanting this to end before it ramped up. The joke seemed to work, getting both of them to pause for a moment with a laugh. I even managed to get a chuckle out of Kelly. I usually couldn’t even get her to crack a smile.\n\nWith the pause in the conversation I noticed a new noise. A small rhythmic thumping, coming from outside the cabin and growing steadily louder. Everyone else seemed to hear it as well, keeping quiet and trying to make out what exactly it was. As the noise continued to grow, I heard it wasn’t just one singular beat, but several, galloping rhythms all out of sync and crashing over each other, with a faint crackling sound following the thumps. The realization came to me suddenly. Something, or rather several things, were running towards the cabin. Very, very quickly.\n\n**BANG!**\n\nSomething smashed against the outside wall of the cabin, shaking the knick knacks and sending a framed photo of Lake Deerhead crashing to the ground. A whining, piercing screech followed the crash, burrowing like an icepick into my ears and drowning out the thumping noise. It stopped and started in fits, a shrill, bleating wail, growing softer and softer each time it returned. I frantically looked around the cabin, trying to take stock of everyone else. Mia and I held each other's hands in a death grip on the couch, while Kelly and Andrew stood in the doorway to the bedroom, Kelly’s face buried into Andrew's chest. A moment passed and the noise quieted to almost a whisper, while the galloping noises now seemed to be fading in the opposite direction they had come from..\n\n“Holy shit! Was… Was that a deer?” Mia asked, a little bit louder than necessary.\n\nAndrew looked at the two of us. “I mean… It’s gotta be, right? Like that or a moose or something.”\n\n“Do you think it’s still..?” Kelly asked.\n\nWe all exchanged looks, no one wanting to volunteer for the obvious task. Finally, with a sigh, Andrew spoke up.\n\n“I’ll check.”\n\nAs he moved for the front door, my guilt got the better of me. I stood up and chased after him. “Wait, wait, wait… I’m not gonna force you to do this by yourself.”\n\nHe smiled gratefully at me and the two of us exited out the front, while Mia and Kelly gathered together in the living room. As we stepped out onto the porch, the rhythmic pounding noise came back, now quiet and far in the distance. We’d left the front porch light on earlier that night, but the two bulbs on either side of the door were on their last legs, barely illuminating 10 feet past the railing. It didn’t even reach the bumper of Kelly's car. Despite this, I still tried fruitlessly to peer out into the woods after the noise.\n\n“That had to have been, like, a whole herd of them running by,” I said off-hand. “Deer or whatever.”\n\nAndrew nodded beside me. “Must have been deer. We saw like 5 on the drive up today. Whole area is full of them.”\n\n“Do you think they got spooked or something? It sounded like they were sprinting.”\n\n“I guess? Can’t really imagine what else it could be,” He replied. The two of us stood there for a moment, both dreading the inevitable task of seeing whatever poor creature had been left behind. After taking a second to resolve our nerves, we stepped off the porch and walked around the corner of the cabin, where I could just barely hear the sound of ragged breathing.\n\nThe deer laid in a heap next to the wall, its neck clearly broken and bending at a harsh, unnatural angle towards its body. The left antler dug into the animal's side, plunging deeper with every feeble, shuddering breath it took. A pool of warm crimson had formed on the fur surrounding the wound, trickling down its body into a small puddle on the ground. The deer kicked weakly into the air with its hindleg as it continued to struggle and wheeze. For a split second our eyes met and I could feel every bit of pain and desperation this creature felt. I turned my head away, only to spot the large red splatter on the wall where it had made contact.\n\n“Jesus Christ….” Andrew muttered under his breath.\n\nI swallowed hard and could feel a few tears forming in the corners of my eyes. “Should we… You know...?”\n\nAndrew sighed. “Yeah, I mean, it’s the least we can do. Jesus… I’ll… I’ll do it, just help me find a rock…” \n\nThe words were hard to hear, even though I understood it was the most humane thing to do. Turning on our phone flashlights, the two of us began scouring the woods for anything big enough to do the job. After a minute or two of searching, I heard Andrew call out from a few yards away “Found one!” \n\n“Ok!” I replied, before turning and jogging back the way I’d come. The deer had stopped kicking by this point, instead focusing all of its remaining energy on simply drawing breath. I slowed as I approached the animal and saw Andrew emerge from a thicket of trees carrying a football-sized rock with both his hands.\n\nHe looked up, evidently seeing the grimace on my face from the sight of the deer. “You can, uh, you can head back in if you want to. I can do this by myself.”\n\nI considered this for a moment. Andrew, for every bit of bravado he put on, wasn’t some unfeeling machine. I still remember back when we were kids and had found a dying rabbit out behind his parents house. We’d put it in a shoebox and tried to nurse it back to health, only for it to die later that afternoon. Andrew had been inconsolable for the next two days.\n\n“No…” I said, putting a hand on his back. “I’m here with you.”\n\n“Thanks, Jules,” he said with a smile, before turning back towards the deer, squatting down, and raising the rock over his head. I looked away, closing my eyes and waiting for the crunch to tell me the job was done. It came a second later, brief and sickening, followed by silence. Opening my eyes again, I saw Andrew breathing heavily and staring blankly at the now motionless animal.\n\n“You ok?” I asked.\n\nHe nodded absently at me. “Yeah… Yeah, I just need a second. I’ll be inside in a bit.”\n\n“You sure?”\n\n“Yeah, don’t worry. I’ll just be a minute,” He said, waving me along.\n\nFiguring it’d be best to give him his space, I began walking back towards the front of the cabin. Right as I passed the railing of the porch, I caught sight of something out of the corner of my eye. Out past the gravel driveway, at the edge of the dirt road that surrounded the lake, I saw a shadow. A human shaped shadow.\n\nI leapt back behind the corner, barely managing to suppress a scream of surprise. Andrew heard the sudden movement and turned in my direction. I put a lip to my finger while waving him over with my other hand. \n\n“What’s up?” he whispered as he approached.\n\n“There’s a guy,” I answered, just as quietly.\n\n“What?”\n\n“A guy, there’s a guy standing out in the middle of the road.”\n\nHe arched an eyebrow, before peaking around the corner and immediately whipping his head back, “Holy shit, there’s a guy right there.”\n\n“It’s almost fucking midnight, what’s he doing just standing outside our cabin?” I asked, not even trying to conceal the note of panic in my voice.\n\n“I don’t… “ Andrew started answering, pausing as if to catch up with his own thoughts. “Shit…. Ok, ok, ok, I’m gonna go see what he wants. Just stay behind me, and I don’t know, back me up or something.”\n\nI stood a full 6 inches shorter than Andrew, not to mention about 40 pounds lighter, so I had no idea exactly how I’d be “backing him up”, but I nodded along to his plan all the same. He shot me a thumbs up, before abruptly stepping out around the corner, hand raised in a wave.\n\n“Hey there! Something we can help you with?”\n\nI followed behind him, hanging back by a few feet. The man hadn’t moved, still standing motionless at the edge of the road, his arms resting at his side and a long, skinny object dangling from his right hand. He looked to be about average height, with the object in his hand probably being a meter or so long. Once again, the porch lights failed to reach far enough, leaving the finer details of his appearance obscured behind a sheet of darkness.\n\nA moment passed from Andrew's first question before he spoke again. “Ok, look, if there’s something you want to-”\n\n“You folks might want to turn off your porchlight,” the man suddenly spoke up, his voice rough and gravelly. ”Tends to spook the wildlife out here.” \n\nAndrew glanced down at his pants, now stained with a streak of blood and gore from the deer. “Yeah, no, definitely. We’ll definitely do that.”\n\n“Just a suggestion,” the man said, shrugging. The object in his hand shook with the shrug and I could see a second part of it had been hidden behind his arm, fatter and with a different shape than the rest of it. Before I could even think to categorize it, his hand turned again, hiding it away.\n\n“Right, yeah…” Andrew replied.\n\n“Are you, um, are you staying on the lake too?” I asked suddenly, hoping to keep him around long enough to get a better look at whatever he was carrying.\n\nThe man tilted his head towards me, but didn’t respond. I continued to stare at him, trying to make out any identifying details I could. A beard, hair color, a stain on his shirt, anything. Finally, after another period of  uneasy silence, he nodded at the two of us.\n\n“You two be havin’ a good night now.”\n\nAndrew and I exchanged a look, but before either of us could respond the man turned down the road and began walking away. As he did, I briefly managed to catch another glimpse of the back portion of the object in his hand and a sudden flash of recognition fired in my brain. It was the shoulder stock of a rifle.\n\nThe second his footsteps fell out of earshot I grabbed onto Andrew’s arm. He looked to be as unnerved as I was.\n\n“What the fuck was that?” he asked, still keeping his voice low.\n\n“Did you see that thing he was carrying?” I whispered back.\n\n“Yeah, was that like a walking stick or something?”\n\n“I think it was a gun.”\n\nAndrew’s eyes bulged at this. “What?!”\n\n“It looked like a rifle.”\n\nHe looked back at where the man had been before turning back to me. “You’re sure?”\n\n“I mean, it was dark, but like he wasn’t using it as a walking stick. It looked like a hunting rifle. I don’t know what that guy’s deal is, but I really don’t like it.”\n\n“Ok, Ok. Fuck, um… Look, let's just get back inside. We can talk it over with Kelly and Mia.”\n\nUnsure of what else to do, I followed Andrew back inside through the front door, taking care to flick off the porch lights as we did. Mia and Kelly immediately rushed us as we stepped in.\n\n“Were you guys yelling about something out there?” Mia asked, putting a hand on my shoulder. “We heard you guys yelling.”\n\nKelly reached out for Andrew’s hand, but he brushed past her while gesturing at the stains on his clothes. She stepped back at this, “Oh God, what happened?”\n\n“It’s just from the deer.”\n\n“A deer did that to you?”\n\n“What, no. I got it when I… Look, let me just wash off first, ok” Andrew said while moving towards the sink.\n\n“Seriously guys, was there someone out there? Why were you yelling?” Mia asked again.\n\nI gave them a quick summary of what happened. The deer, the guy, the maybe-gun. Andrew remained silent the entire time, furiously scrubbing at his hands in the kitchen sink.\n\n“That’s really fucked,” Mia said after I finished.\n\nKelly had her arms crossed while standing next to Andrew in the kitchen. “Yeah, actually, I really don’t like that. Was he trying to be threatening?” \n\n“I don’t know,” I said, shaking my head. “It was just… It was definitely a rifle. I’m like, 100% positive.”\n\n“He could be a hunter, or something,” Andrew offered.\n\nKelly looked at him doubtfully. “Just wandering around a dirt road in the middle of the night? No. It’s August, nothing’s even in season right now. \n\n“Could be poaching. Might be trying to slip past the game wardens by going at night.” \n\n“Then why would he be doing it right by a bunch of occupied cabins? And walking up to people to talk? Nothing about that makes sense.”\n\n“Do you have a better idea?” Andrew asked.\n\n“I do,” Mia spoke up. “He’s a fucking psycho with a gun. Why are we discussing this? Let’s just get in the car and leave.”\n\n“And go where?” Andrew asked incredulously. “We’re like an hour out from the nearest town with a motel.”\n\n“Well, I’m not spending a night in this place while some lunatic runs around and threatens people with a gun. Seriously, what are we still doing here?”\n\nAndrew sighed. “Look, obviously we’re all on edge right now, but I think-”\n\nThe lights cut out before Andrew could finish the sentence, his words drowned out by the shocked screams of everyone else. On my left I felt Mia’s hands shoot up and grab at my shoulder, almost knocking me over as she did. From the kitchen came a loud banging noise and string of furious cursing. \n\n“Andrew!?” Kelly called out in the dark. \n\nI heard Andrew groan a few feet away. “Goddammit… I’m good. Just got startled and smacked my head on a cabinet…” \n\n“What the fuck!?” Mia screamed, her hands trembling as they gripped my arm.\n\nI instinctively pulled her in closer, just then noticing the lack of a once omnipresent background hum. “AC’s out too. I- I think all the power’s out.”\n\nMia and Andrew both started shouting at once, each trying to yell over the other while Kelly weakly attempted to calm them down. I could feel my breathing grow short and a pit form in my stomach. Whatever calm, rational thoughts I’d had left went out with the lights, now replaced by an all-consuming panic. As suddenly as the lights had gone out, a popping noise came echoing in from outside, immediately quieting everyone. A gunshot.\n\nMia and I both dropped low, and I could hear Kelly and Andrew do the same. A moment of almost unbearable silence passed before a second shot rang out, this one sounding closer then the first.\n\n“Andrew, I’m dead serious, we need to get the fuck out of here,” Mia said in a trembling voice, clutching my hand harder then I thought possible.\n\n“The keys,” Kelly whispered from across the room, followed by the sound of jingling metal. “I still have the keys in my pocket.”\n\nAnother shot echoed, growing still closer.\n\n“Shit, shit, shit…” Andrew muttered. “Ok, but we need to fucking run. Kelly, when we get in there, you gotta floor it.”\n\n“We have to go right,” I said, only now regaining some of my composure. “ The gunshots are coming from the left, we have to take the road right, up the northside of the lake.”\n\n“Got it,” Kelly said, her voice resolute.\n\nWith everyone in agreement, we began a slow crawl towards the front door. The clouds outside had started clearing and now faint shafts of moonlight came in through the two front windows, casting the cabin interior in a silvery glow. Not much light, but enough to navigate around the furniture in the living room. Enough for me to see the looks of fear and anxiety on everyone's faces as we crowded in front of the door. Andrew stood up first, placing a nervous hand on the wooden door handle. The rest of us crouched down next to him, making sure to stay out of the window's line of sight. We stood still for a moment, everyone steeling their nerves for the run to the car. \n\nWith one final look at the rest of us for reassurance, Andrew nodded, flung the door open, and sprinted out into the night. Kelly went next, the car keys clutched tight in her right hand, with Mia following close behind. I brought up the rear. As I rounded the door frame, I saw Andrew and Kelly had both cleared the porch, now almost to the car, with Mia’s front foot right at the edge of the front steps.\n\nA fourth gunshot pierced the air.\n\nMia jumped at the noise, her foot slipping from the front step while her body continued forward. She hit the ground hard and skidded along the gravelly driveway, barely getting her hands up in time to shield her face from the blow. I forgot completely about the car, instead leaping down and crouching by her side. She groaned weakly and managed to push herself up onto all fours, wincing as she did. Cuts and scrapes covered her arms under a thick layer of dirt, but those looked to be the only injuries. Gingerly, I reached for her hand, motioning for her to grab my shoulder to help her stand. She looked up, only for her eyes to move past my face and go wide at whatever she saw behind me.\n\nI turned my head and my heart stopped. Sprinting towards us from out of the woods, came the shadow of a man holding a large rifle across his chest. The same man I’d seen before. My legs refused to move and my mind went blank with fear, caught between fight or flight and settling on neither. He ran to the edge of the driveway, only 10 feet away, before stopping and leveling his gun. Behind us I heard indistinct screams from Kelly and Andrew. Timed seemed to slow as the man steadied his aim in our direction, before slowly lifting the barrel up over our heads and firing.\n\nI clutched my ears as he pulled the trigger, anticipating the explosive bang of the gunshot. What I didn’t anticipate was the deafening, ungodly growl that followed. Coming from behind us, it echoed through the woods, rumbling deep and low. I looked out across the dirt road, towards the forest spreading out beyond. The tops of trees bent and swayed to an invisible force, the growling accompanied by the groaning of branches and the rustling of leaves. As the roar subsided, two loud thuds followed, the trees moving in sync with the noises.\n\n“STAY DOWN!” the man screamed.\n\nClutching his rifle with one hand, he reached down at his side with the other and pulled out what looked like a bulky pistol from a holster. He aimed high and fired, sending a bright red flare arcing into the sky before coming down towards the opposite side of the road, casting stark shadows against the treetops as it did. Behind the trees, at least 30 feet off the ground, two bright circles reflected the light, with dark, narrow slits at their centers. \n\n*Eyes.*\n\nThey shimmered for a brief instant before the flare fell too low and the dark again overtook them. The growling returned as the flare died, quieter than before, but with an undercurrent of unmistakable fury.\n\nThe man raised his rifle again, as he stepped past Mia and I, roaring as he did, “GET INSIDE AND KEEP THE LIGHTS OFF!”\n\nWe didn’t need to be told twice. Mia and I both scrambled to our feet and up the steps of the porch, before sprinting through the still open front door. Andrew and Kelly came in close behind, Andrew slamming the door shut as he did. The four of us ran to the corner of the bedroom, as far away from that *thing* as we could possibly get. The sounds of gunfire  and growling continued for the next several minutes, growing slowly quieter until a total silence overtook the night. We stayed in that corner until the morning, nobody daring to move until the first beams of sunlight came creeping in through the windows.\n\nWith some lingering fear, the four of us stepped outside to survey the damage. A few trees had fallen on the other side of the road, but both the cabin and car were untouched. We drove about 3 miles up around the lake, until Mia’s phone picked up a strong enough signal to call the local sheriff's department. They’d been scrambled all night with reports of disturbances and power outages, but invited us to file a report at their main office all the same. The officer we spoke with clearly didn’t think much of our story and I’m not sure how much he actually recorded. We returned to the cabin after that, staying only long enough to gather our things, before reembarking on the five hour journey home. \n\nThe sheriff's department never followed up on our report and no stories came up regarding anything similar to what we’d seen. The only communication we ever received regarding that night came from the owner of the cabin. A week after we returned home, Andrew received an irate email from him saying he’d found the ash from our fire still piled on the beach and that the security deposit was forfeit. \n\nWe decided not to fight the charge.",

        "text": " \n\nThe waiting room was about the size of a small bedroom. There was one large plant in the corner and a framed poster on the wall. Besides the door to the office beyond, that was it. The carpet was worn and stained here and there with all manner of once gooey substances. There was even a comically large wad of gum that had been darkened and flattened over years and years of foot traffic. Some kind of big band music was coming out of a rusty speaker in the wall. The volume was pleasant, but I wouldn’t have said the same about the music. \n\nI had been staring at that poster for around twenty minutes. The style was some kind of colorful expressionist thing, I think. There was a woman lying supine with her arms extended over her head at the foot of a bridge. There was an old street lamp, and crouched under it was a ghoulish looking man dressed in black. He was staring at the woman and he had a menacing arm on her shoulder. The writing on the poster was something in german. It gave me the creeps. \n\nI was beginning to think this was a mistake. This was my new therapist's office afterall, and the waiting room wasn’t giving me a whole lot of confidence that this would be worth my time. I had already tried so many different people and I took a chance because it was a free assessment.\n\nI looked at the time on my phone and shook my head before I stood up. It was now almost thirty minutes past my appointment time, and this guy didn’t even have a receptionist to let me know what was going on. There had only been a bell that had a quiet jingle when I walked through the door. I should have figured it wasn’t going to work when I pulled up to the strip mall. His office was sandwiched between a Hawaiian BBQ and a UPS office. What could I have expected from a therapist in Austin?\n\nIt was worth a try, but it was time to leave. Before I could make a move, the other door opened.\n\n“Mr. Todd?! How the hell are you?!” He thrust out a hand with shiny manicured nails. He was wearing a white t-shirt, floral board shorts, and he had neon green flip flops on his feet. He was a wispy little guy with a full mane of gray bed head. I was stunned by his appearance, and there was nothing I could do to hide that.\n\n“I’m not what you expected?” He asked, but he already knew the answer to his question. He seemed happy that it was indeed the case.\n\n“Not exactly.” I shook his hand. His teeth were perfect and just as white as his shirt. His accent sounded like he was originally from the midwest, and the cadence of his speech was off. He tended to emphasize his words in the oddest ways, as if every syllable was a savory morsel that he was determined to enjoy. \n\n“I’m Benny. Come on in.” He waved me into his office. I checked my watch and hesitated. “I tell you what Mr. Tood, I’m very sorry about making you wait so long, but you’re already here. Obviously there’s something telling you in your brain that you should leave, but just give me a few minutes and if you still feel that way, you can go. No big deal.”\n\nI was desperate. I had been experiencing debilitating panic attacks and I’d been to the hospital several times because I was convinced that I was having a heart attack. No therapy had been helping at all. I wanted to leave, but I kept asking myself, what if? What if this is the one guy that can help, and you’re about to walk because he was fifteen minutes late and creeped you out a little bit. And again, it was free. I was defeated. I nodded and walked inside his office.\n\nInside was the same poster hanging on the wall behind his desk next to a strange looking cuckoo clock. There was a small table with a small fountain on top of it and a large plastic fern in the opposite corner. On the other side of his desk was a tacky plastic pillar of white and gold. A brass bust of a chubby man with multiple chins sat on top of the pillar and it was adorned with a small plaque that simply said, “ Dr. Bob.”\n\nHis desk was bare except for a brand new legal pad, a bic pen, and a rotary phone. There were two ratty but comfortable looking arm chairs on either side of the desk.\n\n“Come on in and have a seat.” I sunk down into the seat. It felt as if the springs had gone out sometime in the eighties. The cuckoo clock went off, and I realized that I recognized it.\n\n“That’s an interesting clock. The Scream?”\n\n“That is exactly what it is. Good eye Mr. Todd. Our very own Dr. Bob also makes very unique handmade clocks.” The clock itself was a background of Edvard Munch’s painting and there were two tiny doors that opened in the middle of it that allowed the little screaming man to emerge and give a mechanical screech as it counted off the hour. By my count of the awful noise, his clock was three hours and twenty minutes off.\n\n“I think your clock needs some attention.”\n\n“Oh, what does time really mean Mr. Todd? I don’t really worry about it.”\n\n“That’s also… very interesting music you’ve got playing.” \n\n“My favorite band, The Squirrel Nut Zippers. This is the Hot album. I try to get my clients comfortable the second they set foot inside the lobby. Are you comfortable Mr. Todd?”\n\n“Sure.”\n\n“The only way there can be trust between us is if I’m one hundred percent myself right from the beginning. Completely honest. There should be no pretense between a therapist and their clients.” I couldn’t exactly argue with that. He plopped down in his chair and scooped up the pen and pad.\n\n“What uh…what’s that poster from?” I motioned to it.\n\n“The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. Yeah… that uh… that movie is an important part of my technique. Well… it’s not my technique… it’s Bob’s technique.” He motioned to the bust. “That movie put the idea in his head for a new kind of therapy. The Process.”\n\n“What kind of therapy is that?” \n\n“The only one that works Mr. Todd. Thank you for answering the online questionnaire by the way. You were very… thorough in your answers.”\n\n“Kind of odd questions for a therapist.”\n\n“Yeah, I can see why someone like you would think that.” \n\n“So… I guess I should ask what kind of insurance you take.” He didn’t answer my question. He just smiled at me with those perfect teeth. The silence was awkward, and after a while I had to say something. “Hello?”\n\n“We don’t do insurance, and by the time you actually go through the process, you’re going to want to give us everything you have because you’re going to be so thankful with your new outlook. But don’t worry, we won’t take everything. Just your first born.” \n\n“No, seriously. What insurance…”\n\n“Did I stutter, Mr. Todd?” I exhaled. This was a mistake. I figured this guy would be some kind of snake oil salesman, preying on people like me, but I just had to give it a chance. I decided that I was done. \n\n“Uh…Benny. I think I’m going to see myself out.” I stood up, but he stayed seated. I turned toward the door and I saw that up in the corner behind me was a small video monitor. It showed a black and white image of the waiting room. I wondered if he had been watching me the whole time I sat out there? I turned back toward him.\n\n“You watched as I sat out there for almost half an hour? What the hell kind of therapist are you?” He waved off my question.\n\n“Let me ask you something Mr. Todd, you called me because you got a flier on your car while you were at another therapist's office, correct?”\n\n“Yeah.” I was shaking now. His tone was almost accusatory, but he was doing it through that smile. I wanted to yank his skinny Tommy Bahama ass out of that chair and stuff him inside of his desk.\n\n“It’s the only way I advertise. Lucky for you, I’ve expanded down to Seguin. I’m going to make a random guess that the hack you were seeing before you came to see me was probably around your fifth try. Five therapists before me, and that doesn’t count those ridiculous counselors that your parents made you see in school. You don’t have to answer me because I know I’m right.” He was right and that bothered me. \n\n“You know the type of person who would even look at that flier to begin with? The type of person who’s at the end of their rope. The type of person who’s desperate. Whether it's anxiety, some kind of trauma, death, hereditary mental whatcha-ma-jigits, you name it. The only type of person who would even walk into this fly by night looking shithole really needs help, and that type has been looking for it for a very long time and nothing works. Not talking, not drugs, not radical acceptance, nothing. How close am I getting?” I didn’t answer him. \n\n“I know something inside your brain is screaming at you to run out the door, but there’s something else in there too. Something else in there that knows life isn’t supposed to be this way. I obviously read the questionnaire you emailed my office. You have a lot of problems Mr. Todd. This assessment isn’t really you seeing if I’m the right guy for you. It’s more seeing if you’re the right guy for this kind of therapy, and I think you are.”\n\n“Well that’s too bad Benny. Have a nice day.” I stormed out to the parking lot and drove away. I had quit smoking almost a year ago, but I accepted the fact that I was going to backslide today. I promised myself that I would at the very least smoke only half of the pack. The whole scene was just a little too ridiculous and off putting. At least it was free.\n\nI couldn’t stop staring at my children during dinner. I said a silent prayer begging God to spare them from the confusion and mental anguish that I had. I watched my mother suffer with it and we lost my Grandpa to it almost twenty years ago. I just wanted to be better.\n\nMy wife caught me staring and I gave her a smile and wink across the table. I’m usually very good at hiding my mood, but I wasn’t going to get anything past Sarah that night. Of course she didn’t bring anything up in front of our kids, she waited until after she put them to bed. \n\nShe found me on the porch having a cigarette. I wasn’t even going to try and hide it this time.\n\n“Rough day?”\n\n“Well… you know.” I held up the cigarette. She had quit after she found out she was pregnant with Lucy, our oldest. That was seven years ago. “I hope you’re not too disappointed in me.” She took the cigarette out of my hand and took a deep drag and then handed it back to me.\n\n“I’m not disappointed in you. I just wish there was something I could do. How’s the anxiety today?”\n\n“Uh…strangely not bad. Haven’t had any problems. It was something else that was different today.” I went through the whole story with her while we shared the cigarette. She laughed a little, shook her head, and offered to kick Benny’s ass. I love my wife. I love my kids. I should be calm and happy.\n\nShe made me come inside and then offered to end my night in the best way possible. I gave her a kiss and oddly enough, I declined her offer. Instead I sat on the couch and looked for the movie Benny had told me about. I made myself a drink and sat down to watch it.\n\nIt was boring, it was old, and it didn’t make a whole lot of sense to me why anyone would waste their time watching it. Which is probably why I fell asleep halfway through it.\n\nLater that night, I woke up from a terrible nightmare. I was still on the couch and it was almost three in the morning. My television was still on and it was playing that movie again. I couldn’t find my remote, so I struggled to my feet and walked over to turn it off, and that’s when I saw that my front door was cracked open.\n\nI closed it and locked it, and then I had a panicked feeling that someone was in our home. I ran to check on my kids and found that both of them were sleeping in their beds. I went into my bedroom, and my wife was softly snoring on her back, but there was a bottle on her nightstand that I didn’t recognize. It looked like an old glass medicine bottle, and the top was open. I grabbed it and gave it a slight wave underneath my nose. Whatever was inside made my head swimmy, and I immediately put it back down. I had intended to grab my baseball bat and do what my children call a “monster check” of our home, but someone was behind me. They must have been hiding behind the bathroom door, waiting for me.\n\nI felt a damp cloth pressed against my face from someone behind me. I struggled the best that I could, but within seconds, everything was dark and I fell.\n\nWhen I finally came to, I was naked and tied to an old creaking chair. Tape was wrapped around my face, and it was hot. So hot. I struggled against the ropes, but the more I jerked, the more the knots bore down on my wrists and ankles. I was in a shed that reeked of cedar and motor oil. Sunlight came through the plank siding and that’s when I realized where a lot of the heat was coming from. There was a hanging work light above my head.\n\nThere were nightmarish cuckoo clocks lining the walls of the shed and all of them were set to different times. One would go off at a new hour, and then five minutes later, another would go off, and so on and so forth. One of them was identical to the one I had seen in Benny’s office. A work bench was in the corner. The only things on top of it were an old CD player and a bundle of red cloth that was tied up with a strip of leather. Next to the bench, there was a white plastic utility sink mounted on the wall. It was filthy with dirt and grime and unmistakable streaks of red down the sides of it. The last thing I noticed before the door opened behind me was a tattered leather apron hanging from a hook.\n\n“My God! We have got to get some air freshener in here or something. Texas in August, what should I expect?” Benny walked over and stood in front of me. I raged against the ropes. I wanted to kill him. “Are you ready to start? I hope so. Dr. Bob has a couple of propane heaters that are piping it in right now. My goodness, you’re sweaty. We’re going to have to let you cook for a little bit, and then we’ll start. Good luck Mr. Brennan. I hope you’re one of the lucky ones. Some people don’t make it.”\n\nThe skinny bastard gave me a wink and then he started to walk out, but then turned around and faced me again. “I should let you know that your family is safe. We put them to sleep just in case there was a struggle. I left a note for your wife that said you needed some time to think. So…you’re welcome.” He walked out and shut the door behind him.\n\nI sat in that shed for hours. The sounds of the clocks were maddening. I continued to try and free myself for a while after Benny had left, but one of the knots on my left foot tightened into my skin so much that I stopped trying altogether. My foot had started to turn purple, and it was getting darker and darker as the hours went by.\n\nI could see through the cracks in the shed that it had gotten dark outside and it was some time after that when I heard the door open behind me. A small, chubby, middle aged man walked around and stood in front of me. I recognized his face instantly. It was the same as the bust in Benny’s office. He was wearing nothing but a crusty pair of white briefs that sagged over his ass and white Crocs on his feet. He was covered in sweat and the hair on his arms and shoulders were weighted down by it. He was holding a round metal handmade device with a crank on the side of it in one hand and a gallon jug of water in the other.\n\n“Mr. Todd, I’m Doctor Bob. It’s nice to finally meet you. Benny has told me a lot about you.” He put the jug down and then reached over and placed the device around my head like a halo and he gave the crank a few turns until it was tightened around the top of my head. Then he stood back and stared at me. I could hear him breathing and it sounded like he was slurping in air through buttery lungs. He wasn’t saying anything. He stood there for another three minutes before one of the clocks went off, and then he reached over and gave the crank a quarter turn. The halo tightened. He stepped back again, grabbed his jug of water and gulped deeply from it, and continued to stare at me and breathe. Another clock went off five minutes later and he gave the crank another quarter turn. It felt like the device was about to start crushing my head.\n\nThis went on, over and over and I eventually lost count of how many times it happened. My head was pounding from the pain and I was tired from trying to beg him to stop through the duct tape. Every once in a while, Dr. Bob would look into my eyes and mutter something under his labored breaths, until finally he must have seen something that satisfied him.\n\n“Alright Mr. Todd. Sorry, but I had to drive it out of your brains. All of us have suffered from the same malady from the time our ancestors crawled out of the muck. They grafted themselves onto us before our first breath of air. What plagues you is no different from what plagues everyone. This next part is up to you. Separation is the most dangerous part. You’re fighting for your life. Don’t misunderstand the danger it’s putting you in. Only think of all the good things, and I’ll take care of the negative. Bear with me for a moment.”\n\nThe ugly little man grunted as he scratched his ass and walked over to the sink. He grabbed the butcher’s apron from the wall, and after he put it on, he grabbed the grimy bar of soap from the sink and washed his hairy arms and hands. I started to think of my wife. I started to think of my kids. This was it. I had no idea what he was going to do, but I was sure it was over.\n\nHe walked over to the work bench and untied the leather strap around the red bundle. When he unrolled it, I saw several crudely fabricated metal instruments.  He pushed the play button on the cd player and it came alive. He turned the volume as far up as it would go. After that, Dr. Bob grabbed one of his instruments, shoved it into the already stressed waistband of his briefs, and grabbed another one from the red bundle. It looked like a cross between a scalpel and a rusty ice cream scoop. He started moving his hips to the sound of the building music and began to slowly dance in front of me. \n\n“The music helps to keep it out of your head. I can’t tell you how happy I was when I read from your questionnaire that your least favorite music is Bjork. It’s not every time I get to work to some of my favorite music. This is her version of “Oh So Quiet”. I put it on a loop for two hours. Hopefully this won’t take that long, but you never know.” Just as he finished his speech, the music exploded into the chorus and he began to swing to it. His steps were far too fluid to have been improvised. I had the feeling that he had danced to this specific song many times before.\n\nI have to admit, for just that moment, I had forgotten about the pain in my head. I had forgotten about my throbbing foot that was losing circulation. I had forgotten about the fact that I was going to die. All I could think of was how bizarre the whole thing must have looked. \n\nI was naked and tied to a chair in a wood shed wearing some kind of torturous metal halo while a rotund man covered in body hair and sweat danced in front of me in his underwear while he was wielding the weapon he was going to kill me with. It was a redneck version of Reservoir Dogs that could only happen on a hot August night in Texas, and I laughed at the absurdity of it all. For just that second, I felt no pain. But then it all changed when Dr. Bob stopped dancing and started to cut.  \n\n“It skitters along the bones. Fast little boggers.” He shouted above the music.\n\nHe mouthed along with the music while he dug into my skin over and over again with that awful tool. I was breathing hard and screaming against the duct tape, but the music was so loud, there’s no way anyone could hear me.\n\nHe made a long cut along my shoulder blade. My body was slick with my sweat and my blood, and I kept thinking about my family. I couldn’t help but think these sick people had taken them as well, despite what Benny had said. They were going to hurt them when they were finished with me. I needed to get out. I needed to make sure my family was safe.\n\n“There you go Mr. Todd. You’re doing great. Happy thoughts.”  He was slicing along my ribs.\n\nThe chair creaked and groaned against the bolts that were holding it onto the wooden floor. My wrists were soaked, and I felt that the rope on my right wrist had shifted slightly. I knew I could overpower him if I could work at least one of my arms free. My chest and stomach were a mess of fluid and agony from all of his cutting.\n\n“I’m almost done. I can’t believe how fast this is going.” He buried the tool deep into my right thigh and I almost passed out, but I kept thinking of my family. I kept thinking of how much better life was going to be if I could just break free.\n\nThe rope slipped again on my wrist, and I realized that I could pull it free. I knew that I only had one chance. I waited until he started in on my chest again. He was close enough for me to grab him, and I yanked outward with my right arm. I could hear a bone pop as I ripped my wrist free and clamped my fingers around his throat. I was going to get out of this. I started to squeeze as hard as I could.\n\nDr. Bob calmly grabbed my wrist and plucked it from his throat as if I was no stronger than a child, and he smiled as he jabbed the scalpel into the top of my offending hand.\n\n“I know what it’s making you think Mr. Todd.” He bored into my hand with his instrument. “It’s making you think that all of this has given you a new lease on life if you can just get away, but that’s simply not true. That’s not why we’re here. If you were to escape, your mind would eventually revert back, because it's not truly yours. You would continue much the way you have, and you would die without ever being free.”\n\nHe let go of my wrist and grabbed me below the elbow and slammed it down on the arm of the chair.\n\n“Look down Mr. Todd. Do you see it?” I looked down and saw that something was moving underneath my skin. It was trying to move back up my arm past the vice-like grip of Dr. Bob, but he was pressing down so hard that my forearm was beginning to turn red. Whatever was moving in there, it was trapped below my elbow. My head was spinning and I knew I was about to lose consciousness. I began to laugh through it all. “It’s trying to hide again. The pain you’re feeling. The trauma. We’re told it can cause euphoria and sometimes hallucinations. A release of endorphins that acts just like morphine on the brain. That certain parts of the experience aren’t real. That’s not true. It’s because you’re finally starting to see. Embrace the process.”\n\nDr. Bob carefully cut an incision down my forearm and began to dig into the inside of my arm. I felt as if something vital was being taken from me and I began to wonder if I was starting to die. \n\nHe dropped the instrument he had been using and grabbed the other instrument from his waistband. It looked like a pair of small Barbecue tongs. He jammed them beneath my skin and I could feel them hunting for something inside of me. I thought of my Sarah. I couldn’t give up. Iwas going to live through this.\n\n“I got it!” He smiled and pulled the tongs up with a jerk. Something made a popping sound as it was removed from under my skin. I looked down and writhing there between the tongs was a small creature with many legs all around its plump little body. Something more aquatic looking than insect-like. It was spitting out a needle-like tongue and it was staring at me with six blue eyes. I could hear it in my head, or rather feel it, pleading with me to put it back inside where it’s lived our whole lives. Pleading with me not to let the fat man kill it.\n\n“Don’t listen to it Mr. Todd. It can’t control you anymore. You’re free.” I was still in pain, but it was different; somehow manageable. There was a sudden peace. I tore my eyes from the thing that was taken from inside of me and I looked at Dr. Bob.  He looked different, as if kindness could be embodied by a human. His face was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen with my own eyes.I looked around the shed and everything seemed more alive. I realized that I wasn’t hearing, but feeling the music coming out of the cd player, and I was experiencing all of the passion that had been put into it. Everything around me felt so new and I had never felt so awake.\n\nAfter I watched Dr. Bob drop the thing on the floor and stomp on it with his crocks until it was mush, he untied me and carried me outside to a new life. There was a large crowd of men and women who were all smiling and clapping. They were there for my new birthday. They were all so beautiful and vibrant.\n\nIt’s only been a few days since I woke up. Since I was freed. I’m one of the lucky ones, and I have decided to dedicate my life to helping the cause of waking up humanity. That’s why I’ve decided to write this. I’m now standing outside of the shed, and my wife is inside with Dr. Bob. My new family is smoking a brisket in the meadow, just a stone's throw away from the shed. They’re just as excited for our new addition as I am. It’s taking longer than it did with me. I’m concerned that she might be one of the unlucky ones that don’t make it, but no matter what happens with my wife, I’m just happy to have this new life. It’s impossible not to be happy. Confusion, anxiety, anger, it’s all gone. They’re alien concepts to me now.\n\nI’m sure my wife will survive and when it’s all over, we’re going to have to have a discussion about our children, and when they’ll be going through The Process.",

        "text": "One afternoon while browsing a second-hand bookstore, Derek happened upon a novelty item which caught his eye. The ‘deluxe edition’ of ‘The REAL LIFE Horror Movie Survival Guide’ was presented as a serious work of non-fiction, but the silly ‘rule book’ style narrative strongly lent itself to tongue-in-cheek territory. The oddly-titled self-help encyclopedia was heavily smudged and dog-eared from previous misuse but that didn’t matter to him. It just gave the book character. It was exactly what he was looking for. A fun little read which would help pass the time until the approaching storm ended. \n\nBack at home, he poured himself a cool drink and settled into his favorite recliner. Thunder roared and clapped violently. He’d arrived back at home, just in the nick of time by the looks of things. The front and back cover were illustrated with cartoonish murderous scenarios, while the foreword extolled the virtues of absorbing every single word, lest a cliché death befall the reader. How else would a person fend off various forms of ‘evil incarnate’? \n\nIt was hilarious to Derek how utterly serious the mood was maintained throughout for the parody advice offered on its pages. In spite of the gravely straight writing style, he had to grin from ear-to-ear. He removed the dust cover to spare it any further damage. A handwritten note was scribbled on the back of the paper but he didn’t pay it any mind. He assumed the hastily-penned missive was the previous owner’s mindless graffiti or addendum notes. ‘Haunting mystery, blood-curdling excitement, and white-knuckle adventure’ surely awaited.\n\nThe opening chapter title didn’t disappoint. It was a doozie. It warned: “Always assume you are living in a horror movie. Yes, you! The signs are there. You may deny it, but it’s true.”\n\nThe paranoid sounding idea was both ridiculous and over-the-top, but in the cooperative spirit of playing along, he threw himself into the role of ‘horror movie victim’. It would make the imaginary excursion more enjoyable. The wind howled as night fell on his rural estate. More than a few times, the power flickered off and then back on during the fierce tempest. The serendipitous coincidence of which, readily added to the ominous mood. When the power went completely out, Derek wasn’t even surprised. It would be quite a while before the electrical crew could repair it. Most likely they would wait until the torrential downpour ceased.\n\nHe stumbled through the darkness until he made it to the kitchen. There he located an old flashlight which had languished in the junk drawer for years. After smacking it violently a few times against his palm, the dim bulb flickered until the ray it cast was satisfactory. The batteries were ancient. He also had candles he could light… somewhere. In the living room, he picked up his home phone receiver to call about the outage. The sooner he notified the authorities, the quicker they would be dispatched. Oddly, it too was dead. It might have passed as foreshadowing of trouble, if he didn’t know better.\n\nHis cell phone remained in the car because the reception was nearly nonexistent in the remote countryside. It was going to be a long weekend. The emergency candles were supposed to be in the junk drawer too but he couldn’t initially find them. They had probably been pushed all the way to the back of the drawer until they fell over the top and tumbled underneath; way down to the unused storage area below. He figured they were buried in that pile, along with the lost treasures of the Inca. He was right. Many other lost things were sequestered in the overflow pile of miscellaneous debris.\n\nWith four candles and a lighter, Derek managed to create enough ambient light in the living room to continue his reading. The next chapter: ‘Never back into a darkened room’; seemed more like practical, common-sense advice for everyone. Nevertheless, with full-blown suspense the book cautioned the reader that, ‘Evil is always waiting in the darkness’. It explained that It’s best to enter dark rooms facing forward, so you have a slight chance of fending off the merciless axe or chainsaw attack. \n\nDerek smiled at the familiar themes and wondered if anyone actually took the book seriously. It was very clever. Unfortunately his amusement was interrupted by the discordant sound of breaking glass near the back of his house. The frequent thunderclaps drowned out most other noises from outside but this one was very clear. It caused a moment of doubt and genuine concern when he heard the invasive crash. “Probably a limb from the old oak tree has fallen against the house and smashed the window.”; He nervously theorized. \n\nDespite his running hypothesis, he didn’t immediately rise to verify it. “Whatever it is can wait until I’m good and ready.”; He justified with a shaky sense of false bravado. The candlelight illumination remained fairly consistent but the shadows at the edge of the room seemed to be shifting and moving. It had to be his imagination. The old homestead was definitely spooky with the power out but he was a man grounded in reason and scientific logic. \n\nThe third chapter was aptly titled: “Trust your instincts.” It discussed the importance of listening to your inner voice and being self-aware. Naturally that depended on the reality of the situation. Derek THOUGHT he was ‘self-aware’ (of life in general) but he still struggled with clarity issues. Not the least of which was, he didn’t have the courage to investigate the serious mystery transpiring in his back room. He was much too afraid to investigate the cause of the unexplained noise and just tried to avoid it entirely. He hoped it would go away on its own. If anything, that was the opposite of ‘self aware’. It was denial in the truest sense. The book deeply discouraged that sort of illogical behavior. \n\nNext came the chapter: “Don’t call out ‘who’s there?’ in a darkened room.”\n\nAgain, the guide made perfectly good sense. He knew he was alone in the house. If he wasn’t anymore, the human intruder or malevolent entity lurking in the dark wasn’t about to truthfully answer, were they? It was an exercise in pointless futility but Derek’s fragmenting imagination automatically went for the least malicious possibility. That illusion offered the most soothing peace of mind. \n\n‘Maybe the shattered glass sound was only a lost child seeking shelter, or a raccoon frightened by the thunder?’; Or, ‘Maybe, just maybe it was a knife-wielding lunatic who’d escaped from a nearby asylum!’ Either option was equally possible. The ‘happy’ outcome was no more likely to be true than the other scenario but he desperately clung to the ‘safe’ one like a flimsy styrofoam life preserver bobbing on an angry sea. He’d spooked himself into a veritable froth of fear. The novelty volume Derek originally thought to be laughable and absurd, was rapidly becoming his only source of clarity.\n\nWhile the raging storm had abated significantly, the unexplained noises around him were definitely increasing. The glass chandelier rattled and shook menacingly. It was as if an unknown soul was in the room above him stomping around, in the otherwise ‘empty’ house. Then an echo of heavy footsteps resonated in the air, as the staircase leading downstairs began to creak. Their burden unseen in the dark. “Who’s there!”; He demanded. His voice was shaky and uneven. He ignored the important rule he’d only recently read about not addressing the unwelcome presence. Fear will make you do that. \n\nImmediately, he regretted calling out. It only demonstrated where he was in the room to the intruder. The guide book was correct. No one responded to the pointless query, and now he was a sitting duck in the recliner. Lightning from afar temporarily illuminated the living room. Nothing visible descended the staircase, yet the planks continued to creak. The terrifying footfalls grew nearer. \n\nWhatever unseen thing invading his country estate was actually close enough to smell. A foul, acrid stench filled the air and the temperature dropped significantly. Derek imagined the vapor of his own breath lingering in the darkness like a rolling fog. Heavy, measured breathing beside the recliner first mirrored his own labored gasps, but then lost its synchronistic cadence as his terror level increased. As much as he wanted to be alone, he was not.\n\nShaken beyond words, the ‘man of science and reason’ leapt up and ran through the nearly impenetrable pitch for his front door. Derek collided with the oak threshold and nearly ran it through, cartoon-style. His scream would’ve been evident from three miles away as he fumbled with the knob. He finally accomplished the everyday task and flung it open in an absolute frenzy to escape. He left behind the guide book but it hardly mattered. He was far too rattled to follow its step-by-step instructions. \n\n“Make sure you have your car keys before fleeing the scene of an active haunting or massacre.” That’s the information the book would have covered next if Derek had kept his cool a little longer, as well as “Always look in the back seat before getting in the car.” Those are highly pertinent details that would’ve saved him a great deal of grief and despair. \n\nUnfortunately he was waist deep in the middle of a supernatural crisis and unsuccessfully dealing with the sobering facts. He absolutely WAS living in a horror movie and had just reached the predictable scene where the clueless main character realized his car keys were not in his pocket. Just when he needed them most. \n\n“Damn it to hell!”; He cursed while fumbling with his pants and coat pockets. He already knew the ugly truth. His keys were in the decorative bowl on the foyer table. That’s where he always tossed them when he got home. The thought of having to go back inside filled him with the deepest sense of dread but it had to be done. The storm was still in full force, and he was a half dozen miles from town. \n\nHe bribed himself with the knowledge that they were JUST inside the front door. He could dart in and grab them ‘in a flash’. That optimistic plan sounded vaguely doable in theory but the actual practice of re-entering ‘spook central’ was infinitely harder to justify. He stalled and agonized for a while but time was on the side of the evil, unknown entity waiting for him within. Derek had to bite the proverbial bullet and get it done. \n\nAt the threshold, all appeared quiet. There was surely something in the book about dangerous situations appearing harmless and safe from the outside. Derek’s muscles tensed as he tried to psyche himself up. Was something really waiting just inside, or was it merely a figment of his imagination? Getting drenched, he felt silly. It was his home for Heaven’s sake. Nothing even remotely supernatural had ever occurred there before. Why now? He was actually ashamed of being afraid of a storm and a handful of spooky noises. \n\nAll he had to do was go in and wait for the power to return like a rational adult. There was no logical reason for him to cower outside like a small child terrified of a boogeyman hiding under his bed. The problem was, disembodied footsteps and rattling chandeliers can’t easily be explained. Rational or otherwise. Derek struggled with the strength of his convictions when he stepped into the darkness of the hall. \n\nBlindly, he searched by fanning his hands for the edge of the table and the fancy bowl. The first few swipes came up empty. Nothing but air. Then he made contact with the corner of the table. The bowl rattled from his heavy-handed search in the dark. As he zeroed in on the keys to his freedom, his naive optimism briefly returned. It seemed like things might just turn out ‘alright’. \n\nThen, an unholy ‘witch’ screeched at him from close proximity. The low hiss sent shivers down his spine and when her cold, very dead hand grabbed his in the black abyss of the foyer, he let out an inhuman shriek which surpassed the previous one. The difference this time, was that he possessed the wherewithal to also grab his keys from the bowl before tearing out of there like his soul depended on it. Perhaps the ‘REAL LIFE horror movie survival guide’ had left its mark on him after all. \n\nDerek committed the cardinal sin of not checking the back seat first, but as far as he was concerned, anything back there couldn’t be any worse than whatever he’d left behind in the house. After the requisite fumbling with the door lock, and then again with the ignition, he peeled out of his driveway as fast as he could go. The relentless downpour continued with no end in sight. His windshield wipers struggled to offer a clear view of the winding path forward. A couple miles down the road, the danger appeared to have abated and he started feeling more at-ease. \n\nDerek hardly noticed when a solitary figure in black partially blocked the roadway up ahead. Who would’ve expected such a unusual thing in the middle of a dark, stormy night? Well, he would have, if he’d just finished reading the instruction manual. The dual chapters: ‘Never pick up mysterious hitchhikers on the side of the road”; and “Never accept a car ride from a maniacal psycho” were crystal clear about the dangers of those two polar opposite (but equally dangerous) behaviors. He swerved at the last possible moment, and luckily managed to avoid the ‘careless pedestrian’ and the ditch.\n\nGlancing in the rear view mirror after correcting the car, the robed phantom vanished from the roadway! Duh! The incident might’ve passed in his head as merely a weird coincidence, but the diabolical face of the same hitchhiker now stared at him from the back seat. The sadistic specter wasn’t done with him yet. Not by a long shot. As is often the case in these real life horror movie scenarios, the evil soul had attached itself directly to his skin, and stuck to it like glue. \n\nDerek didn’t stop until he reached town. It would be daylight in a few hours and he hoped he’d find some peace. As much as he tried to resist, he occasionally eyed the corpse laughing at him from the back seat. Reality hit him. There was no place to go. ‘She’ would follow him wherever he fled to. That being the case, he needed to find a way to exorcise the entity mercilessly taunting him. \n\nHe hoped to locate another copy of the guide book. With any luck, it might have the answers he sought. In less than 24 hours it made a believer out of a previously hardcore skeptic. Fitfully he tried to sleep in the front seat until the store opened but it wasn’t easy. She kicked the rear of his seat and cackled every time he nodded off.\n\nUnfortunately, the used bookstore didn’t have another copy, but it was a moot point. The curse was upon HIM, not his HOME, so he might as well just return home and finish the copy he already paid for. With the storm finally over and the warm rays of sunshine changing his somber mood to hope again, much of the past evening felt like a fanciful nightmare. A sunny day can absolutely improve one’s gloomy perspective but the grinning ghoul glaring at him in the mirror reminded him she was indeed, very real. \n\nAt home, he noticed the power was restored. The upstairs bedroom window was shattered with the glass littering the floor of the room. His uninvited guest probably flew in on her broom to make a grand entrance. He swept up the loose shards and encased the broken window in plastic. His house might’ve been haunted by an ornery poltergeist from Hell, but that was no reason for his floor to get ruined from rain damage. All chores completed, Derek sat down to finish the book. \n\n“Mirrors are the sinister gateway to dark realms.”\n\nHe read the relatable title of that chapter and sneered. He’d already learned that little factoid the hard way. If only he’d gotten further into the guide before all hell broke loose, he might’ve been better prepared. The simple truth was, Derek had been in full-blown denial. Most people are when faced with distasteful facts.\n\nThings were different now. With the incessant laughter in the background and sharp objects levitating nearby as a vivid reminder of her evil presence, pretense was over. He accepted that his life was fully immersed in a real-life, horror-film level extravaganza. Hopefully the manual had practical and effective methods to vanquish the supernatural chaos he’d fallen into. Unfortunately, the next few chapters focused more on homicidal lunatics of the still-breathing variety. \n\n“Never accept a drink from a stranger.”, “Never mock a psycho.”“Never trust a clown.”, “Resist the urge to make out with your girlfriend in an abandoned building / haunted house.”, “Never split up your group with a killer nearby.”, “Don’t put down your gun / knife / hatchet / chainsaw / hedge trimmers.”, “Don’t assume the killer is actually dead / Don’t stop hacking up the psychopath before he’s in tiny pieces; then burn the remains.” \n\nIt seemed like the book had all the cliché bases and horror film tropes covered. Derek decided to skim through those unrelated chapters to be fully thorough. There was definitely practical wisdom which could be cataloged for the future, in case his next misadventure followed those predictable genre lines. If any of that happened, he’d be fully prepared. \n\nThe thing was, there was a much more pressing, real-life concern waiting; or more specifically hovering directly above him and stinking up the place with her ‘odeur du rot’. In deference to solving his current crisis, he searched the table of contents. There he hoped to find the answers he desperately needed immediately, and was greatly relieved to spot the very chapter to assist him. \n\n“So, you’ve got a Demonic Beast / Cackling Witch Ghoul / or Undead Fiend terrorizing you, non stop? Turn to page 274 for a failsafe solution.”\n\nDerek rapidly flipped to the end of the guide but was infuriated to realize the whole chapter was missing! Upon closer inspection he noticed it had been torn out. He couldn’t believe his eyes. “You’ve got to be kidding me!”; He shouted angrily. The answer to his ‘little haunting issue’ had been crudely removed and discarded by some sadistic prankster. \n\nHe scrambled to pick up the dust cover in hopes the missing section’s pages had simply fallen away from the binding and were loosely enclosed there. To his furious dismay, they were not. As he turned over the dust jacket in bewilderment, he finally read the aforementioned inscription; which had been penned by his uninvited guest. Her restless spirit was bound to the accursed book. \n\n“The missing pages are always the most important ones.”\n\nSigned;\n\n\\-‘The Witch’",

        "text": "The voices are getting louder.  They have been there for my whole life, talking to me, keeping me company, offering me comfort and advice.  They have been incredibly helpful. They gave me words to speak when I just couldn’t find the right ones.  They have given me answers to questions that I couldn’t figure out on my own.  And they . . .how do I put this?  They . . . tell me things that nobody should know.\n\nI’m not psychic at all. I have no idea what the voices are or where they come from. What I do know is that if they tell me to cross the street right now, I do. I have. In fact, it was just in time to get out of the way of a couple of gang members shooting at each other through a crowd of pedestrians. A lot of people got hurt. Some died. Not me though. The same goes for when they told me not to get into the cab that first responded to my hail. Turns out that driver was looking to get revenge on the world before going out in a blaze of glory. He picked up four fares that day and killed every one of them before getting into a shootout with the police. He was killed. As for me? I would have been his third fare.\n\nI think that’s enough to give you an idea of my relationship to the voices in my head. I don’t think you want to sit though some long, drawn out story about the financial decisions they guided me on, or the relationship decisions, or the career decisions, the scratchers to buy, or the deep secrets that no one should know and I often wish that I did not.\n\nLet’s jump into my present situation.\n\nThe voices have never told me to kill anyone before. I don’t know why they want me to do it now. I don’t even know who the person is. Well, I didn’t know. The voices have told me everything there is to know about him. I know his name. I know where he lives. I know exactly what he looks like, his schedule, the name of his goldfish, his favorite food, the shows he watches. Heck, I even know that he rubs one out every night before bed. I really didn’t need to know that.\n\nI’ll call him Glenn. Not his real name, but I don’t think that using his real name would be a very good idea. He lives two states over in a smallish town. Nice house. Paid for it with the life insurance money from his wife that he murdered. Me made it look like an accident. Used some meth cooking methods to extract the epinephrine from a bunch of decongestants and injected it all into her while she slept. It gave her a massive heart attack. He jabbed her in the armpit, where it’s super easy for the coroner to miss a tiny needle mark. No one ever suspected a thing.\n\nBut I know.  I know because the voices know.\n\nOh, he hated her so much. What began as a marriage of love became a marriage of convenience that became a marriage trap. They fought all the time for years. Their hatred for each other grew by the day until one day he snapped. No, that’s not the day he killed her, but it is the day he decided to. He’s smart. He knows that the first suspect in any suspicious death is the husband, especially when he is always fighting with his wife. That’s why He stopped fighting with her and went out of his way to be super good to her.\n\nI know what you’re thinking. That’s the near-universal cure for a bad marriage. It makes a woman fall in love all over again and makes her putty in her hubby’s hands. You’re absolutely right about that. Even if it starts as a sham, you would think that the way the wife responds to the husband would soften his heart and the love would blossom between them. It wasn’t that way for him. His hatred was too deep. His resolve was too firm. All he cared about, all he wanted, was the illusion of being a loving husband so that he wouldn’t fall under suspicion.\n\nHe invested two whole years into his plan. She was so happy. All the while he was slowly obtaining the meds, making it a habit to go hiking or hunting in the woods so his final trip, the one where he would create his poison, wouldn’t look suspicious.\n\nShe never saw it coming. He injected her. He watched her die. Then he got in bed with her and went to sleep. When he woke up, he pretended to panic. He called 911 with fake tears and choking in his voice. When the paramedics declared her dead and carted her away, he broke down in a flood of crocodile tears. When the police took his statement, he wailed and cried that he loved her with all of his heart.\n\nHe went through all the right motions, playing the part of the grieving husband to perfection whenever there was anyone to see him. In private he reveled in his newfound freedom, loving the peace and the lifting of the burden of treating the woman he hated like a queen.\n\nThat’s the short version of his story. Of course, no one on earth knows this but him, the voices, me, and now you do too. He never told anyone. I have no way to know this. It’s the voices.\n\nI don’t like the idea of offing a man based only on what the voices tell me, but they voices have literally never been wrong. Never. Been. Wrong. Not even once. But this is a whole new level of demand from them. This isn’t life advice or protecting me from harm. This is murder. Or maybe it’s justice. If he really did murder his wife killing him would be justice, wouldn’t it? The cops can’t do anything. There’s literally no evidence of foul play. He had her body cremated, so they couldn’t exhume her and test her for an epinephrine overdose based on an anonymous tip. Everything he used in the murder, what little there was, was destroyed long ago. There is literally no way for the law to serve him with a big helping of justice unless he confesses to the murder. \n\nHe will never do that. His conscience doesn’t bother him in the least. He thinks it’s the best thing he ever did.\n\nNo one will ever believe me either. They have no reason to. I have no evidence but the voices in my head. That’s the kind of evidence that gets you locked up in an asylum for the criminally insane. It’s the kind of evidence that guarantees that you will be kept a drugged up, drooling mess in a straitjacket and a padded room.\n\nI have been telling the voices no. I can’t do it. Justice or not, it’s still me taking another human life without the support of the law. I can’t be judge, jury, and executioner.\n\nThey tell me that they are the judge and jury, and I am merely the executioner.\n\nI have never had any reason to doubt the voices in my life. I doubt them now. I doubt them because killing is wrong. But then again, he’s a killer, isn’t he? Is he really going to just get away with it and live a long and happy life? Could I live with myself if I do what the voices tell me to do?\n\nI need to stop. Maybe take a sleeping pill. The voices are screaming at me. It’s so loud. It hurts. It hurts my head. It hurts my ears. It hurts my eyes and even my body. They are so loud. I don’t think they will stop unless I do what they say. I don’t know what to do. Do I trust them like I always have in the past? Do I do what they say whether I trust them in this or not? Do I continue to resist?\n\nHelp me. Please. I don’t know. I just don’t know.",

        "text": "A tiny little shithole of a one-bedroom apartment. That’s what my life has been reduced to. Two months ago I had a farm, a girlfriend, dogs, horses– all gone now.\n\nIt’s my own fault, really. I’d neglected her for years. Chased business idea, after business idea, and they all led to, well… not much.\n\nAnd before that, a six-figure job and a trajectory up the corporate ladder. I threw it all away.\n\nBut I still have my writing, the only thing I’ve ever been good at. But I can’t even take credit for that. As soon as my fingers hit the keyboard (as they are doing now), my muse appears and whispers things to me that can only be born out of darkness. I call him Dennis.\n\nI suspect Dennis can take the form of anything he chooses, yet he has revealed himself to me as an immense, albino python, with the face of my dead grandfather, who killed himself when I was in high school.\n\nShot himself with .22 caliber revolver that I would use to go hunting with whenever I would stay with him and help him work his farm in the summers as a kid. I’d always thought it was a tiny round to shoot yourself with. And right in the side of his head. I suspect it wasn’t an instant death.\n\nAnd I can’t forget the chair, oh that sanguine chair from which he always sat and ate his butter cookies. I helped move the furniture from the house and the deep red of the cushions had been sprayed with an even deeper red liquid that had since dried even deeper still; almost black.\n\nCuriously, none of It ever troubled me much. I loved him in my own way, mainly for showing me the value of a day’s work, but he was a lost man and had his demons, and I don’t think he saw a way to overcome them. To be frank, I didn’t see a way for him to overcome them, either.\n\nSo why does he slither along the cheap laminate flooring of my apartment? The dead orbs in his sockets are wall-eyed and clouded and still. The little lead bullet must have severed his optic nerves, but his mouth still flaps very much alive and well -- as he whispers to me. His mustache is as well-groomed as it always was in life, and the reluctant strands of his combover rest neatly over his bald head.\n\nHe told me to write this: “It’s time you tell them about me, boy.”\n\nThe words crooned into my ear just this morning. And so, I did. And so, I am.\n\nWhy is it he that inspires? Why is it he that calls on my fingers to dance? I type the words of lonesomeness, despair, and dread, just as he asks. He then offers a watery smile and slinks away.\n\nI asked him if he’s in Hell for the life he lived. He assured me, “Hell is a state of mind, boy,” and left it at that.\n\nI write at the behest of Hell, the incomprehensible void of all things lightless.\n\nAnd Grandpa Dennis is, as usual, right.\n\nFor the tales spun from words on the pages are real if they’re true in the heart, are they not?\n\nWords are powerful things; sacred things. You build worlds and universes with them and the reader lives there for a time.\n\nOf course, a serpent with the head of my dead grandfather can’t be real, yet you still see him, white and shining scales that house a long, rippling tube of flesh as it winds its way throughout my small apartment. You see his dead eyes and sinister smile as he reads the words I type from behind my shoulder. And those eyes still see, somehow.\n\nYou’re reading the words *with* him, in a sense. A shared moment with a monster. He’s *my* monster, but he’s yours now too.\n\nI’ve lost everything by my own doing, just as he did, and when I look in the mirror I see his face above all others. I see my own doom.\n\nCan you feel it now? What’s in the darkest corner of your own heart? What have you done that’s too painful to think on, and only catches you while you’re in bed at night? Who have you loved that looked at you with cold eyes and disappointment, or worse yet – indifference?\n\n“Hell is a state of mind.”\n\nDo you see? Dennis is right.\n\nAnd Dennis is pleased.\n\nOnce he’s done with me, he’ll eventually coil his body around mine, squeeze until my guts spew from my mouth, and open his own, gaping wide to consume me, and smiling all the while. And I’ll be gone. But for now, he allows me to use him as my dark muse, so I can share this with you.\n\nSo I can plant this idea in your head and let it grow until you’ve got your own ghost.\n\nWell, you already do, don’t you…\n\nIt might not have taken form just yet, but deep down you know it’s in there -- in you.\n\nMaybe it’s a dying aunt you didn’t see near the end. Maybe it’s a friend you betrayed, maybe it’s a parent that didn’t love you, but it’s in there.\n\nAnd the worst part of all of this?\n\nYou don’t even know how much of this is true. It seems like a real-life story, doesn’t it? Maybe it is.\n\nMaybe I’m just writing this to make you feel a sense of unease.\n\nBut the point is, is that it doesn’t matter.\n\nYou’re beginning to form your own ghost; your own serpent. Just like Dennis wanted.\n\nAnd it may give you power, but it will also almost certainly destroy you, for the darkness is beautiful and all-consuming, and we can’t embrace it for long.\n\nBut you’re here on this thread, reading the darkest of the dark you can find, so you’re already halfway there, aren’t you?\n\nSo, tell us:\n\nWhat does it look like?",

        "text": " Hey reddit, little bit of context here. I, 16F, go to school with this other boy, Bryce, 17M. We both go to one of the most prestigious highschools in our home state. The admissions here are really tough, and only the most talented kids make it. That’s how I ended up at this location. I am (according to my teacher) one of the smartest kids he’s ever seen. I am a straight A student, and have never gotten lower than a 95 on a test. Bryce, on the other hand, is not the sharpest tool in the shed. He really only got into the school because hes good at sports. And I mean REALLY good at sports. He’s our football teams star quarterback, and already has multiple D1 offers (which is something that he really likes to boast about, to the chagrin of me.) Bryce is your stereotypical high school jock. He always wears a satin sports jacket and the new jordans, and he can often be seen shoving the “nerds” into lockers. Basically, all this is to say that hes a big asshole. Hes always getting into trouble for something, but he’s also extremely sleazy and very good at getting out of it. \n\nBryce really seems to hate me in particular. I cannot tell if its because I am the smartest, or if he just decided on me as his own personal punching bag, but I always seem to be the target of his harassment. Many times over the years he has stolen my lunch money, or dunked my head into a toilet. Anything you’ve seen in a movie he’s done to me. Yesterday this reached a breaking point. Bryce pinned me down on the ground and stole my homework, replacing it with his. Like I said prior, Bryce wasn’t a very smart guy and never really did well on tests or work. I really didn’t want my grade to go down any lower, especially considering I wasn’t doing that well in math this year. I decided that enough was enough. This dickhead Bryce was not going to get away with this any longer. \n\nI hatched a plan during lunch. To get rid of Bryce was my ultimate goal. I originally thought that my plan may be too drastic, too severe, too likely to get me in trouble. But I didn’t care. The thought of the torment I had to endure over the years at the hands of him were enough to drive me to madness. \n\nIn hindsight, it was easily traceable. Who else would do it? Everybody loved Bryce. He won us a state championship last year, and was the greatest athlete in our schools history. All the teachers kissed his toes. I was the only one who had outwardly projected my disdain towards him. The detectives still took a while to figure out who had done it. After all, I was quiet and reserved, and didn’t submit to a search at first. But when they found the bottle of rat poison in my locker, they immediately knew who it was. The warrant for my arrest was released the next day. But it was worth it. \n\nSo reddit, I’m starting to feel bad about what I did. The charges are not helping my family at all, and my parents are angry at me. But I feel like I was justified. AITA?",

        "text": "My wife and I were on our way home. We'd gone to dinner to try and work out some bubbling problems that we had ignored for too long and tried to see if there was a way to salvage what was left. It didn't go great, and the ride home was uncomfortable. As we turned into the carport, my wife asked what have we decided, but before I could answer, the headlights illuminated a woman standing in the corner. Our carport is framed on four sides. There's a fence to the left, a shed wall in the back, and the house to the right. The only way in is through the driveway. This woman stood to the left of the carport in the corner between the fence and the shed. She looked frozen in time. Her hands her up, almost like imitating a cat scratching at the air. Her head was slightly tilted, her eyes wide open, and her mouth ajar in a snarl. She looked like she was wearing a nightgown. Her age wasn't imminently apparent. Her hair was gray, and her skin gray, but it didn't seem particularly wrinkled. \n\nAs the headlights shined in her eyes, she had no reaction. She didn't blink or turn her gaze. She just stood there. My wife hits the brakes, and we both stare at this woman. We don't say a word to one another as we focus on this strange woman. \n\nHONK\n\nBreaking the silence, my wife lays on the horn. I jump a little from the sound, but the woman, the woman, never moves a muscle. We look at each, neither of us knowing what to do. My wife tells me to get out and see if she's all right. I'm all for chivalry and being a man's man, but at that moment, I knew a stupid idea when I heard it, so instead, I rolled the window down and asked if she was okay and needed help. No response. My wife hits the horn again, and nothing. Neither of us wants to get out of the car, so my wife takes out her phone and dials 911. The operator asks for a description of the woman and our address. The operator tells her to stay on the line till the police arrive. \n\nThere's a knock on the window, and my wife and I both jump. It's the babysitter. She asked why we were blowing the horn and did we need something. I tell her to run back into the house and point toward the woman, but she's not there. The woman is gone. I asked my wife if she saw where the woman had gone, but she didn't. We'd both turned our attention to the babysitter and didn't see where she went. I tell the babysitter to get back in the house and lock the door. The 911 operator asks if everything is okay, and my wife tells them the woman has gone. The fucking operator asks if we still need the police. Of course, we do. Just cause we didn't see her move doesn't mean she's gone. My wife doesn't want to get out of the car, and neither do I. \n\nI try to look around the window to see if I can spot her, but it's too dark. My wife asked if she went inside while the babysitter was out here, and we weren't looking. Maybe she ran inside the house. I think about it, but it seems impossible. There's no way she could have moved that distance without being seen. My wife thinks I'm being dismissive and gets pissed. I'm trying to maintain, but I lose my temper as well, and before I know it, we're having a full-on fight about the plausibility of if the woman is inside or not. My wife says to call the babysitter to check and make sure she and the kids are safe before the police arrive. \n\nI call, and the babysitter doesn't answer. I try again, and still no answer. I send a text and get no reply. Now, my wife and I are getting nervous. I say fuck it. I'm going in to check. My wife doesn't want to be alone in the car, so I say to come with me. She's not sure about leaving the car either. I tell her I'm going in the house, and she can come or stay. It's up to her. She asks the 911 operator how far the police are, and they say maybe five minutes, which sounds like an eternity given the situation. So we both decide to get out and go inside to make sure everyone is okay. \n\nI tell her I'll get out first to unlock the door, and when it's safe, she runs for it. Great. I get out, reach the door, get the key, and open it. I glance inside and yell for the kids and the babysitter, but no one answers. I turn back to the car, and my wife is gone. I shout her name but hear nothing. She's gone. The car door is still closed. It looks like she vanished. I yell inside for the babysitter and the kids one last time before I go back outside to check the car. I don't see anyone in the car. I turn around for the house, and in the headlights, I see my wife in the corner of the carport.\n\nSame frozen pose as the woman. Same body language same expression. I say her name, but she doesn't look at me. She doesn't flinch, nothing. I step closer to her, and there's still no reaction. I grab her arm, and she lets out this horrible high-pitched scream. I say \"let out\" 'cause that's the only way to describe it. The sound sort of just emirates from her gaped mouth. Her face doesn't move. Her mouth doesn't tremble. She's still as a statue, with this horrible scream echoing out of her throat. I stop my hand and pull it away, and the screaming stops. I don't know what to do. I don't want to leave her alone, but the thought of the babysitter and kids not answering is at the front of my mind. What might have happened to my wife if this had happened to them? I tell her I'll be right back, the police are on their way, but I have to check on the kids. I turn and run for the front door and go inside. \n\nIt's dark, with only a few lights on here and there. I shout for anyone to answer me. Where are they? Are they okay? But get no response. I try the babysitter's phone and can hear the ringing upstairs. So I run to the sound. \n\nAs I get to the top of the stairs, all the bedroom doors are closed. Behind the kids' bedroom door, I can hear the babysitter's phone. I open it up, and my two sons and the babysitter are in the corona of the bedroom. My two sons crouch on the ground, and the babysitter sits with her arms around them. They don't move, these faces of terror frozen in place. I shout their names, but they don't respond. I follow their eye line to the far side of the room, but I don't see anything. \n\nI run over to them, but before I put a hand on them, the same scream that emanated from my wife's throat comes from theirs. I stop, pull my hands away, and they stop screaming. I turn to follow their eye line, and I don't see anything, only an empty corner. I hear the sirens outside in the distance. The police are almost here. I don't know what they can do, but at least there's help. I look back to the empty corner, and there she is, the woman from the driveway. She doesn't move, same frozen expression and the same pose. Nothing has changed. It's as though someone picked her up from downstairs and carried her up. \n\nI stand and approach the woman. She doesn't seem to react. I notice my body tremble as I get closer to her. Everything in me says to run and get as far from this woman as possible, but I keep walking closer. I match her eye line as I move toward her. I look directly into her dark black eyes. Inches from her face, I raise my hand as I did to my wife and children. I expect to hear that same guttural scream, but nothing happens. I grasp her arm. The woman's face doesn't move, but her body leans forward, and her head stretches toward my ear. It seems like everything is in slow motion, and I can't let go of her arm. I can't escape that snarled mouth as it leans beside my ear. I don't feel breathe when she speaks. Her words come out as if from a single, long exhale. She says, \"my family now.\"\n\nI couldn't move. I looked into those cold, dead eyes, and the snarl on her face stretched and popped as it agonized from that stiff snarl to the worst smile I'd ever seen. She let go, and the room went black as I fell to the ground. I woke up to an empty home. I've been over every inch and can't find any sign of them. I've called my wife and the babysitter's phone, but it goes straight to voice mail. Right now, the police are around pulling up outside, and I'm not sure what I will tell them, but I know they won't believe me.",

        "text": "\"Yo, Johnny-boy!\" My head snaps over to Zander. I wouldn't have even heard him at all if it weren't for the fact that he was literally only a foot and a half away from me. Even still, I only barely heard him over the cacophony of hammering guitar riffs and howling vocals engulfing the room in an adrenaline infused chaos. It also didn't help that when he spoke, the fucker's nose was buried in a set of double-D cups from one of his little groupies who was dry-grinding on him. \"Yo!\" he called out again.\n\nI slumped out of the LazyBoy I was vegged out in and stumbled my way over to him. I remember I was about five or six drinks in, along with about 8 or 9 shots of Jack, so I was at a point where my legs felt like spaghetti noodles, but could still walk without busting my face on the first step. \"What's up, dude?\" I slurred.\n\n\"Johnny... Johnny-boy, my bro...\" He giggled before having the girl's boobs pressed in his face again. He pulled his face back out and said, \"Dude, you gotta try those brownies in the kitchen. They're fuckin' *fire,* man!\" I looked toward the kitchen.\n\n\"Really?\" I asked. \"Who made 'em?\" He didn't hear me, his face being submerged again. I clapped, \"Yo, Zander?\" The girl shot her head over to look frightened at me before pulling back off of Zander. She got up then and walked off.\n\n\"Wait, what the hell, where you goin'?\" He looked over to me and was like, \"Dude, the hell? What'd you go and scare her off for?\"\n\n\"The brownies, dude,\" I replied, ignoring his annoyance, \"Who made 'em?\" He started giggling again.\n\n\"Oh yeah, man, those fuckin' brownies are on *point!\"* He did a \"Chef's kiss\" gesture and added, \"Yeah, Aaron made some the other day when he was over here and made a whole bunch of the shit. Dude, when he told me this shit will taste like they were baked by fuckin' angels, he wasn't capping. He said you'll feel like an angel too, like you're leavin' your body, man.\"\n\nI stared intently at the large baking pan sitting on the counter in the kitchen. \"I'm telling you, you *gotta* try at least one!\" I exchanged glances back and forth between him and the brownie pan.\n\n\"They taste that good, huh?\"\n\n\"Bro, I promise you, try one, and you'll be fucking set.\" I looked at him again. His face was lost in a giddy haze.\n\n\"You eat one tonight?\" I asked. He nodded gleefully before holding up four of his fingers. *figures*, I thought. Dude never could stop at just one or two pot brownies. Some people just can't help themselves, can they? Of course, I guess I don't really have room to talk, now do I?\n\nI shifted my focus back to the pan in the kitchen. The brownies admittedly *did* look delicious. I had a thing for fresh brownies, minus the sweet leaf. See, I wasn't one for weed, or any other stuff like that. Not for any real reason other than I'd never tried it before, and I preferred to stick with my usual method of losing myself -- drinking myself into a stupor until my body feels like a brick of lead and everything that comes out of somebody's mouth is the funniest thing I'd ever heard.\n\nThat and, thanks to every experience I'd ever had trying to smoke cigarettes ending with mee puking after only a few puffs, I wasn't real big on the idea of having to smoke anything, either. Again though, I'd ever *tried* weed before, and I wouldn't have to smoke anything, so...\n\n\"Yeah, okay.\" I said, still eyeing the pan, \"I think I'll try one.\"\n\n\"Attaboy! Yo, hold up before you do, though, let me grab a couple more before you do.\"\n\n\"Bro, I thought you already had *four* of 'em. Leave some for someone else, ya fuckin' pig.\"\n\n\"Bro, they're gonna be gone once you dig into 'em.\"\n\n\"What? Bro, I'm only having one, not the whole fuckin' tray.\" He started cackling wildly.\n\n\"Oh trust me, you ain't gonna stop with just one. Not these. I swear, I think Aaron put crack cocaine in these things or somethin'.\" I frowned and looked back at the brownie tray.\n\n*Great, so there's probably crack in 'em, too. No wonder Zander pigged out on 'em.* He bounded up from the chair he was in and darted for the kitchen, pushing his way past the crowd of people clustered together in there. Funny enough, regardless of how \"heavenly\" these brownies were, no one else seemed interested in them. I'm guessing that Zander was the only one who'd even attempted eating one, probably by scaring off anyone else that dared to try. Who knows?\n\nAnyway, so I make my way to him to find him grabbing four or five of them before scurrying off, shouting to me, \"They're all yours, bud!\" I looked down at the pan. Almsot half of the pan was gone. I looked in the direction he ran off in. *Only had four my ass. fuckin' hog.*\n\nLooking back to the brownies, I picked one up to find that it was moist, yet firm. Spongy, just like the way my aunt used to make 'em when I was younger. *I wonder if they melt in my mouth the way hers used to?* Without thinking too much more on the subject, I popped the brownie into my mouth.\n\nNow, bear with me because one thing was certain, this didn't taste much like a normal brownie. Yeah, yeah, it's a pot brownie, but... I don't know, it just tasted... *off.* It wasn't bad or anything. Quite the opposite actually. It was delicious. It tasted sweeter than a normal brownie, yet with an equally strong sort of savory taste to it. Imagine, I guess, if someone put sugar into a juicy filet mignon and somehow turned it sweet -- and somehow made it taste good. It makes absolutely no sense, I know, but it's the only accurate way to describe what this \"brownie\" tasted like.\n\nAnd yeah, surprisingly enough, it *did* melt in my mouth like my aunt's used to. I savored the brownie as best I could, even going so far as to draw out each bite. *'Kay... Well at least it doesn't make me wanna vomit.* Thing was, I wasn't exactly feeling anything from it yet either. Granted, again, I didn't know really how it worked with pot brownies, meaning I didn't realize the effects weren't automatic. *Maybe I have to eat more of 'em?*\n\nThat made sense to me, I mean, Zander *did* say that \"You can't just stop with one\". So I grabbed another and crammed it into my mouth. Once again, this one tasted just as delicious, as well as just as odd, as the last one. Now, one thing I noticed at this point was that, despite these things being pretty sizeable, at least the size of my palm, if not a bit bigger, and as thick as they were, it didn't *feel* like I was getting any fuller. It was like as soon as I swallowed them, they just evaporated or something on the way down my asophagus.\n\nI remember burning through about two or three more before I noticed a sort of tingling sensation pass through my body. It sort of tickled while also muffling my nerves, making my body sort of feel limp. Unlike how I was used to with the liquor, the way I was feeling now was a lot more numbing, almost paralyzing, in fact. What I mean by this is that, though my arms were still there and would even start to twitch a bit, I could just barely even feel it. My arms may as damn well have not been attached to my body at all.\n\nThe same was trued with my legs, too. My limbs, the muscles in my face, everything started to go numb while my tongue became dry as a damn bone. Now, I know you're thinking \"Yeah, big deal, you scarfed a few pot brownies for the first time and you're wigging out cause it's kicked in\", right? Well, here's the thing, while everything I've described thus far may be \"normal\" when it comes to edibles, or just weed in general, but I'm pretty sure we'll all agree that what happened next *wasn't* \"normal\".\n\nNow by this time, I'm of course starting to wig out mentally a bit, wondering what the hell's happening to me. *Why can't I feel anything? Why's my mouth so dry? Why do I feel so light all of a sudden?* I realized quickly exactly what the word for what I was feeling was. Ironically, the word would be \"emptiness\". I was essentially hollow. An empty shell, standing in the kitchen. I moved my eyes around. Everything still *looked* normal for the most part. All except for one thing, that is.\n\nIt was when I looked over to the living room again that I saw it for the first time. What to call it and what it is are two questions that neither I, nor anybody I know of, could ever hope to answer. In the far corner of the living room, somehow standing completely unnoticed by the throng of people who were gathered around the area, was the tall, blackened shape of a man, standing at least my height, 5'9\", with this extremely demented, toothy, straight up wolfish grin on its face, staring dead at me. My heart immediately began jackhammering in my chest.\n\n*The fuck is that!* I blinked rapidly a few times, believing that the weed was just feeding off of my paranoia, you know? Basically, I went in with anxiety, and so the weed would basically amplify that. That was my understanding at least. That is, until I quickly realized shadow man in the corner *wasn't* going away. Not only that, but correct me if I'm wrong, aren't you still supposed to be able to actually *move* parts of your body while you're under? I know it's supposed to be able to relax you and all, but you should be able to do at least simple movements such as, say, moving your arms to try rubbing your eyes to make sure whether or not you're just seeing shit?\n\nYeah, well, not me. My body was a marble statue or a mannequin, perfectly still and lifeless, seemingly cut off from my own consciousness. I know, it's weird to explain, but basically I could see and hear everything happening around me just fine (though admittedly, I noticed that everything seemed to move a bit slower than I thought it should've), but I couldn't actually interact with anything. My mind was somehow disconnected from my body. Internally, I was screaming, crying out both for someone to help me -- somehow -- as well as for someone to watch out for the shadow figure who, at this time, I started to notice was creeping closer and closer. I could hear myself as well trying to shout at it directly, wondering just who and/or what the hell it was and what it was doing.\n\nThe shadow came closer and closer, slowly creeping. It's stride toward me was like that of a spider, with long steps across all four extremities. The whole time, neither I nor it broke eye contact. It smiled deviously, ravenously, at me while I stared back in nothing short of sheer terror. Once it'd closed about half the distance between where it was before and where I was in the kitchen, I watched its mouth open, unnaturally distending almost to the point where its bottom jaw was actually touching the floor. In a voice that was distorted like someone had gone and chucked one of those toy voice changers down a flight of stairs, yet also strangely familiar, I heard the shadow say, \"A new vessel. It's been so long...\"\n\n*What the... \"vessel\"? What is this thing, some kind of demon?* I could feel my brain start to pound in accordance with my heart beat. I was about to be possessed by a fuckin' demon!\n\nI felt myself try to struggle again, but to no use. Part of my brain, of course, was still screaming at me that this wasn't real, that there wasn't a demon coming for me and that I just needed to keep my head about me and everything would be fine. Then the shadow figure decided to abandon its little \"creepy crawly\" gimmick in favor of just rushing me for the kill. If I'd had any sort of control over my body, I'd have seized up, throwing my hands in front of my face while screaming.\n\nOf course, thinking back, I probably wouldn't have even had the chance, regardless because of how fast the thing bum rushed me and the next thing I know, I'm having what feels like a needle-studded brick if iron get stuffed down my throat. Somehow, don't ask me how, but *somehow,* despite not being able to feel any part of my body only a second ago, I spent the next thirty or so seconds in excruciating pain, pain that I couldn't even react to, outside of my inner consciousness, as the shadow thing wormed its way down and throughout every part of my body. I guess, thinking about it a bit more, it felt like whatever this thing was, wasn't just taking my body, it was trying to assimilate *me* as well. It wasn't just gonna stop with my body, it would've taken my soul too or something.\n\nThat's the best guess I've got anyway, because, unlike what the movies show with this sort of thing, its not like there were flashing lights, freezing air, shit floating around the room, or my head spinning 360 degrees like an owl. No, it was just me, standing there in front of a tray of brownies, probably looking to everyone else like a goddamn statue, like I just had an aneurysm or something. No, everything that was happening to me was real, but I was the only one that could see or feel it.\n\nThere weren't any sounds, either, not even from the space around me. That much, I didn't even notice until after the thing had wormed its way into me for a good fifteen or twenty seconds. Everything was on mute for me and the only thing I could, I guess \"hear\", was the sound of my inner consciousness screaming bloody murder while the thing started moving parts of my body around, having completed its little hijacking process. It took a second to move my arms and shit around, checking itself out like it was in a fitting room, before looking up ahead into the living room to see everyone gathered round the area me and Zander were in just before coming into the kitchen.\n\nNow, I couldn't hear anything, but from the looks of panic, with people's hands covering their mouths, I could sort of guess that the thing's attention was snapped by the sound of someone screaming. Something was wrong, but what? At first, the thing stood still, not wanting to investigate apparently.\n\nEventually, the crowd began parting and I saw that they were all gathered around Zander, who, for no reason (that I knew of anyway), was hammering some poor dude's face into the floor. I remember seeing this and wondering *What the hell is he doing!* Then he rose up and I saw that his eyes were now cherry red, with these white slits in the middle of them, making them look like the eyes of a snake. He was staring dead at me, stretching his mouth in a demented sort of grin like I was about to be the next poor bastard to get their face smashed into the floor. I wanted to start running, but of course, I couldn't.\n\nHe rose from the floor slowly, eyes still trained intently on me. Everyone that'd gathered around him began trying to back away, looks of horror chiseled on each and every one of their faces. He began walking toward me, grinning wider and wider with each step. About a foot and half, maybe two feet away from me, his arm stretched out to me and I heard him say in this weird, sort of soothing voice that sounded like the combination of a man and woman's voice, \"Brother...\"\n\n*\"Brother\"? The fuck? What is he talking abo--*\n\nMy inner voice was silenced when Zander's hand rested on my forehead, looking like something from some Native American tribal ritual or something. Then, from *my mouth*, I heard the same type of voice reply with, \"Yes, we are here, it's time.\" That was the last thing I saw or heard before everything just went out like a light. I couldn't see anything, feel anything, or hear anything. I was gone.\n\nHow long it was exactly that I stayed like this, I couldn't hope to tell you. Honestly, I was pretty sure, in some way shape or form, that I wasn't *going* to come to. I figured, whatever had just happened, that was it. I was done for.\n\nHonestly, I kind of wish that were true. When I *did* come out of the darkness, I was in a room I didn't at all recognize. Instead of either Zander's kitchen or his living room, both of which being littered at every corner with trash and scraps of junk food and reeked of weed fumes and alcohol, I was in a clean, warm, cozy looking room that looked a lot like the one at my grandparent's old place from when I was younger. I looked around, at the corners of the room, and then at myself. Slowly, I brought my hands up to my face, realizing I had control of my body again.\n\nWell... Sorta...\n\nMy eyes doubled in size when I noticed that my hands weren't *my* hands. The skin on them looked older, like the arms of say, a 50-55 year old, as opposed to the arms of a 27 year old natty like they should've been. I felt across the top of my head to realize that, in place of my raggedy lion's mane hairdo, there was nothing! I sprang up out of the bed I found myself on, where I quickly discovered that doing so apparently resulted in sharp pains shooting up and throughout my body from the small of my back. As quickly as I could manage, I zombie-walked out of the room to find the nearest mirror, where I damn near had an instant heart attack.\n\nIn the mirror, instead of seeing me, *my face,* I was looking at the face of some dude who had to have *been* around 55 or so. Wrinkles and fatigue lines creased the bottoms of my eyelids, my cheeks were beginning to shrivel like a dead prune, and when I opened my mouth, I found several teeth missing. I wasn't even me anymore, this was somebody *else* that I was now somehow *inside of.* After taking a minute to let the immediate shock die down, I began to move throughout the house I was in, looking for some kind of explanation.\n\nLooking out of the window, I found that I was on a beachfront property somewhere. People in bathing suits were out walking to the beach with various items like surf boards and things like that. I made my way to the door and went out to talk to one of them. I stopped the nearest one, a young kid and his girlfriend, and asked them where I was. At first, they stared at me, confused, but I guess they just took me for an old fogie who was already experiencing the onset of dementia or something and told me I was at Myrtle Beach.\n\n*How the hell did I get here? Why am I here? Why do I look like an old man? WHERE AM* ***I***\\*?!\\*\n\nFrom that point to now, about a week later, I have been searching desperately for an answer to all of this. Obviously, I haven't gotten very far, though, just two days ago, I saw on the news in this condo how two people in Gastonia, where I'm from, were gunned down in a police shootout at a bank. When it showed the faces of me and Zander as the perpetrators, I vomited right there in the living room.\n\nAs far as what *actually happened* to me or him, the *real* us, I have no clue. At this point, the best guess I've got as to what's going on is that, somehow, probably because of what's in those brownies, our spirits somehow detached themselves from our bodies, leaving us wide open to get hijacked like that from those shadow things. Of course, why that very moment, only after *I* ate a few, that they decided to sprig their attack, I couldn't tell you. Maybe it was some sort of reunion or just convenient timing. Though, being completely honest, I feel like it was part of something bigger, like there're more of them, waiting to surface like that and assume people as hosts to do God only knows what.\n\nRemembering that Zander had told me that it was our old buddy Aaron that baked the brownies to begin with, I started searching for his address on the internet until I found an article similar to the news report about me and Zander, with him being shot after supposedly attacking and trying to eat three people at the park, killing one and seriously injuring the others. This article, by the way, was just two days after I woke up here in the beach house.\n\nAgain, so much of this, I couldn't hope to wrap my fucking head around. All I know now is that, now I'm forced to live the rest of my life as a 50-something year old man with the consciousness of a 27 year old, two of my friends are out there, somewhere, *also* trapped in bodies that aren't theirs, and so are those things; those shadows. Oh, and one more thing, I know that no matter how normal, how delicious, how \"homemade, just like how my aunt used to make\" they are, I will *never* eat a fucking brownie again.\n\n*EVER!*",

I’d once walked away from that house, leaving an empty yard behind. Now the house just stood there, like I’d never left. A few steps down the driveway, I could see a shadow in the guest room on the second floor. Could it be? Of course it was.\n\nEvan came out to greet me. He’d assumed the shape of an average brown-haired Caucasian man in a black shirt and dark jeans. Even though I knew he wasn’t fully human, it was hard to see through his camouflage.\n\nAnd yet, I wasn’t afraid. Evan wouldn’t hurt me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI stopped a few feet in front of him. For a moment, we just looked at one another.\n\n“I thought you were dead,” I said.\n\n“I don’t possess the strength to die,” he muttered.\n\n“I’m not going to pretend to understand that.”\n\n“I don’t expect you to.”\n\nHe stepped aside, letting me in. Looking at him a bit closer, I could see the tiny hairs of shifting colors that made up his ‘clothes’. I could see the seams in his face where his membranes could break apart. I saw the pouch on his back, where folded cockroach-wings rested.\n\nI’d missed him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI sat down in the kitchen, and he handed me a sandwich. I told him about the past few months. The various monstrosities that’d tried to kill me. Everything from Saint Gall to Hatchet, and everything in-between. Headless victims, escaping from time itself. A sadistic, bloodthirsty monster, trapped in the body of a child. But it was when I came to speaking about Uncle John that I stopped myself.\n\nThere was no way he’d still be alive. He’d been, at most, hours from passing when I left him. Now it’d been… what, days? Weeks? Being stuck with those Blameless freaks out in the Hatchet grounds messed up my perspective of time.\n\nEvan wasn’t the reactive type, but he seemed regretful.\n\n“There is no suffering to that passing,” he said. “Your kin were strong. Only the weak resist oblivion.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile I got a chance to rest up in the bedroom, Evan went to check on John; just to make sure. Despite being exhausted, I couldn’t help but to lay awake. I was so anxious that I couldn’t stop my leg from shaking. It took me half an hour just to yawn, and another half before I lost my train of thought.\n\nIt felt just like the blink of an eye. I woke up to Evan standing outside my door, looking at me.\n\n“The proprietor laid him to rest,” he said. “It is done.”\n\nI didn’t know what to say. It felt like a rock dropping straight from my brain into my stomach, pulling the light in the back of my mind along with it. This dark, sinking feeling. It physically hurt me, and there was no going back now. I curled up, devastated.\n\nEven sat down next to me, placing a chitin-covered hand on my arm in a mimicked gesture of comfort.\n\n“You are almost finished,” he said. “You may stay here.”\n\n“I barely even… even know what this is,” I sobbed. “I didn’t… I didn’t mean for any of…”\n\n“You called upon the attention of a being,” Evan said. “That attention is important. And if you walk one year under its’ gaze, it can see your devotion. It rewards. It forgives.”\n\n“See, I don’t… I don’t even know what that really *means.*”\n\n“It means great change,” said Evan, feigning a mechanical smile. “And change is good.”\n\n“Change is good,” I repeated. “Change is good.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I woke up, Evan had already gone down to his basement. He’d left a box of tissues, two tuna sandwiches, a coke, and an entire bag of lightly salted tortilla chips. It was all set up on a neatly arranged tray, right next to my bed.\n\nBut something was wrong. I tried to turn, but my arm wasn’t responding. There was a deep, pulsing pressure reaching all the way from my neck down to my fingertips.\n\nNo pain, but… nothing else, either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI looked down at my chest. I remember that one of the Blameless freaks had stabbed me with a needle. The puncture wound wasn’t healing properly. It looked like little black veins were spreading throughout my torso. One particularly large vein reached all the way into my left arm, stopping at the stump of my ring finger; where a little metallic growth poked out of the skin.\n\nI’d seen that metal before. It was the same kind of metal that’d killed Uncle John.\n\n“Evan?” I called out. “Evan, are you there?”\n\nIt took a moment for a speaker in the corner of the room to come to life.\n\n“Yes,” a set of voices responded in unison.\n\n“I think… I think there’s something wrong.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt took him a few moments to come upstairs and examine me. A cold stethoscope against my chest, a few blood samples, and a scraping of the metal stump. A few minutes later, he came back. While Evan didn’t have the facial structures to look grim, I could tell he didn’t have good news.\n\n“Yes,” he said. “Something is wrong.”\n\n“Is it what I think it is?”\n\n“An infection. A refined, concentrated dose of an organic metal.”\n\n“Same as Uncle John had.”\n\n“No,” said Evan. “His dosage was about a hundredth of what you have.”\n\n“A hundredth?”\n\n“It is a concentrated dose. Your uncle had mere shrapnel.”\n\n“Yeah, but he had it in his *brain*, I just-“\n\nI was so frustrated. I was so frustrated that I couldn’t find the words, and Evan just handed me the tissue box. Maybe he knew this was coming.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver the next few days, Evan tried to slow down the infection. We tried the same dialysis-technique that Uncle John had helped me with, but it just wasn’t enough. It was like using a spoon to drain a sinking ship. I was deteriorating, fast. To Evan’s credit, he stayed true to keeping me as his guest.\n\nAt first, it was small things. Losing the sensation in my arm for a minute. Having a weird headache. Tasting copper. It was all little symptoms, nothing major.\n\nBut it got worse. One of my strands of hair had turned into a sharp, solid, metal. I accidentally punctured my thumb with it once. Days later, I lost all appetite. The only food I could keep down was either heavily salted or high in capsaicin. I could drink hot sauce straight from the bottle. Suddenly the tortilla chips started to make sense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe calendar crossed into December. One of my eyes had gone grey, and I couldn’t keep my back straight. I’d hear this awful feedback sound whenever I tried to listen to something through headphones. One of my teeth turned black and fell out. It was all one thing after another, and I started dreading waking up. I mean, what else would I find? Every trip to the bathroom was a horror show.\n\nBut I was comfortable, all things considered. Evan did his best to help. He made sure I had what I needed, and he gave me whatever kind of pain meds he found appropriate. Vitamin supplements, routine check-ups, and a mild exercise regimen. Evan had this vast collection of encyclopedia-like information stored in the back of his mind, and he could use it without a second thought.\n\nBut I couldn’t help but wonder; if this was just a *part* of the “Pacifier” I’d been struck with, what would a full dose do to me?\n\nAll in all, I was lucky.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn’t get to see John’s grave. Leah and Roy were nowhere to be found, and Evan wasn’t to keen on looking for them. He told me the Babin family was not only vicious and vindictive, but numerous. There were dozens of them, and people who went looking for them usually disappeared. He could fend for himself, but he saw no reason to push further.\n\nI couldn’t blame him.\n\nI just tried to focus on the next day, and the next day, and the next day. Not my hair falling out, or my left eye going black. Not the twig of metal growing from the stump of my ring finger. Not my teeth turning dark, or my tongue orange. I tried to put it all aside, and just focus on making it to the end of the month.\n\nMaybe I could wish it all away. I’d do anything for a clean slate. Just like my dad had wanted.\n\nI barely slept, ate, or drank. Days started to meld together. What day was it? When was the last time I ate? I started forgetting and found myself disoriented regularly. How John’d handled it was a mystery. Maybe there was a trick to it, or maybe it worked differently when it pumped through his system over a longer time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI remember one night in particular.\n\nMy feet were cold, and I was rolling a little white feather between my fingers. I was so focused on it that it took me seconds to realize I wasn’t even inside the house anymore. I was standing in the back yard, barefoot, in the middle of the night. And as I rolled that little feather between my fingers, I saw little sparks. My fingertips were coated with metal, and rubbing them made sparks fly.\n\nI hadn’t been outside much. The first snow had begun to fall, and among the snowflakes I could see white feathers. All over the night sky, they intermingled with the snow, and danced their way to the ground. It was so serene, in a way.\n\nWhen I looked down, I could see the sparks had lit the feather on fire. The ashen remains fell apart in my hand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nComing back inside, Evan gave me a blanket and a glass of salt water. I mentioned the feathers outside and chugged the glass.\n\n“Then it’s almost over,” Evan nodded. “That’s the last sign.”\n\n“Sign? What signs?”\n\n“There are several signs that indicate its’ presence,” he nodded. \n\n“Such as?”\n\n“The sunflowers,” Evan said. “Have you never questioned the sunflowers?”\n\n“The blue ones?” I chuckled. “No, those things are everywhere.”\n\n“They are where they need to be,” he said. “They are the only thing that can grow anywhere, and anywhen. Winter, summer, spring, and autumn. They can grow here, on the other side, and at the bottom of the sea. They grow where one thing crosses a line. Where a rule is broken, and where intent is foul.”\n\nI just looked at him. It was like listening to a robot reading slam poetry. A strange, machine-like staccato, forgetting to sound human for a moment. But Evan quickly corrected himself and continued.\n\n“But most of all, they can grow in the back of your mind. That’s where they stay untouched the longest.”\n\n“You mean… it’s bad to think about them?”\n\n“And to *not* think about them.”\n\n“That doesn’t leave me with a lot of options.”\n\n“Why would you have an option?”\n\nI didn’t have a response. I just looked at him, dumbfounded.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy joints started locking up more regularly. Some days, I’d have such an ache that I could barely walk. At one point, Evan had to carry me to the bathroom. I slowly lost my sense of taste and smell. I had to concentrate to focus my eyes, leaving most of the day in a vague blur. I would hear things with an echo, and my skin started to flake; revealing a subdermal layer of metal.\n\nIt got worse, and worse. Quickly.\n\nI started having these dreams. White feathers, landing in my hand. Looking up into the clouds, and feeling myself looking back. I’d wake up with this sudden sense of awe, like the universe was calling out to me. Like someone was waiting to see me.\n\nEvan found me outside two more times. Once when I’d fallen asleep in the bath, and a second time when I’d woken up in the middle of the nigh. He stopped me, every time. He had more than repaid whatever debt was between him and my uncle, but he didn’t seem to mind the company, or the hassle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDays turned into weeks. I celebrated a meager Christmas, watching old movies on VHS in the guest room. Evan got me a little plastic Christmas tree as a gift. Battery-powered, with all kinds of lights and a little angel on top. It wasn’t much larger than my hand, but I appreciated the gesture.\n\nBy then, I could barely move. I shuffled about on crutches and had to transition to a wheelchair after a few days. I counted down the hours until the end of the year, and whenever I lost these big swathes of time to my fading grip on reality it was just more encouragement. Like falling asleep on a plane; it gets you there faster.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, it was the night before New Year’s Eve. A thick layer of pristine snow outside. And by then, I could barely move. That night, Evan helped me get to bed. He had to speak up, so I could hear him through my rattling lungs. I could taste rust.\n\n“Your journey ends tomorrow,” he said. “But it requires an effort.”\n\n“To… walk. Around the church,” I wheezed. “I-I… I can’t do it.”\n\n“No,” Evan said, shaking his head. “It is not about walking. It is about a journey.”\n\n“Will you… help me?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nThat was it. Matter-of-fact, straight to the point. Of course he’d help. He’d done nothing but help.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat night I finally slept. I dreamt of Uncle John, finally free of his sickness. I dreamt about a field covered in white feathers and a warm summer sun. I dreamt that I saw what would come next. A benevolent eternity of never-ending excitement, love, and youth. All I had to do was stay a little longer. Then I’d be welcome to join him, and so many others. Countless others.\n\nBut I didn’t. I tore myself awake. \n\nIt was New Year’s Eve.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEvan prepared a wheelchair for me and a jar of salt water with a straw. He bundled me up in winter clothes and blankets, making sure a woolly hat fit snug around my ears. It wasn’t until he rolled me out of the house that we spoke.\n\n“It’ll take hours,” I coughed. “You sure about this?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nAnd that was that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt would take hours to roll me around that lake 12 times. Evan had considered the pacing and calculated how long it’d take based on the amount of snow and the rigidity of the wheels. He’d checked weather reports and scouted ahead. Luckily, the road was salted, to stop people from slipping. That made things easier.\n\nIt was afternoon when we left his house for Frog Lake. The snow reflected the rays of the sun, casting a mirror-like sheen on every flat surface in town. The wind stood still, and I could hear every rustle from every winter bird in the forest.\n\nOnce we got to the edge of the lake, a sinking feeling came over me. I remembered the brisk walk I’d taken one year prior. I thought about what John had taught me, and how my view of the world had so drastically changed. Still, the path around frog lake was the same. Broken streetlights. Names carved into trees. Hell, even the same abandoned bike at the side of the road.\n\nWhatever happened to me, the town would live on. Nothing would change that day, but me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI drifted in and out of consciousness. I could feel Evan’s hands pushing me forward, and the rhythmic clunk of the wheelchair lulled me in and out of sleep. I wasn’t even tired. Maybe it wasn’t sleep; maybe it was just my body shutting down.\n\nOnce, he poked me face to wake me up. Turns out I’d forgotten to breathe. I had to start forcing air into my lungs, consciously. It felt like doing a sit-up with my organs, and it was a nightmare.\n\n“You are doing well,” said Evan. “Breathe.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn’t even count the laps. All I saw was the sun moving from the top of the sky to the edge of the horizon. The wheelchair kept squeaking, and I could see we were following our own tracks in the snow. For a while, I could almost imagine me and Evan on the path in front of us, like we were having a slow chase with ourselves.\n\nOnce the sun started to set, the fireworks started. Just like last year. I heard people cheering and music bursting out from passing cars. Even then, barely conscious, I recognized the melody to ‘The Final Countdown’. I chuckled at how appropriate it was.\n\n“Good,” Evan said. “Make noise. I need to hear that you live.”\n\n“It’s… it’s hard. To laugh.”\n\n“Think of something humorous.”\n\n“It doesn’t… I can’t just…”\n\nI sighed.\n\nMoments later, Evan took a deep breath, and gave me the worst acapella rendition of The Final Countdown I’d ever heard. It was like listening to a sick child trying to sing through a broken kazoo. It was so awful that it came back around to delightful, and even in my decrepit state I couldn’t help but to chuckle. He really was giving it his best to keep me sharp.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe sun had set and the streetlights (that still worked) came on. We started seeing people on the side roads rushing off to their parties and dinners. I was still sipping my salt water. I couldn’t taste it anyway, and I needed every little boost I could get to make it through the next few hours.\n\nI must’ve nodded off, as once again, Evan woke me up.\n\n“One more,” he said. “You are almost done.”\n\nI tried to respond, but I couldn’t. My jaw had locked up and my tongue wasn’t moving. I grunted so he knew I was conscious at least.\n\nI focused on every breath, on every blink of an eye. I listened for my heartbeats, and I held on to whatever life I had left in me. I could do one more lap. I could do a little more. I could make it to the end of the year.\n\nAnd as we came back around, my heart sunk.\n\nThere was someone blocking our path.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nComing closer, I could see his black hair and a childlike physique. A pale kid, about eight to ten years old. I’d recognize him anywhere. \n\nFred. The result of a Yearwalk from another person, at another time. I’d gotten away from him once back in July, and I had the image of him drinking from a decapitated head seared into my mind.\n\nMaybe I was imagining things. I wasn’t all there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Hi there!” Fred called out, waving at us. “Hey, mister!”\n\nEvan stopped and stepped forward. He wasn’t easily intimidated.\n\n“I suggest you leave,” said Evan. “This is a private matter.”\n\n“Nah, I’m good,” smiled Fred. “I’ll stay right here, buddy.”\n\n“What do you want?”\n\nFred thought about it, tilting his head in an exaggerated fashion.\n\n“Nothing,” he smiled. “I just don’t want you to have anything.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was a sudden rush of movement. Fred cackled, but Evan wasn’t backing down. I could hear the flutter of insect wings and the clamp of a pincer. Little steps in the snow. Laughter and punctured skin.\n\nI saw nothing. It was too dark, and I couldn’t keep my eyes focused.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen, movement.\n\nAt first I thought I was being sucked in; but I figured I was being pushed.  Fred was keeping Evan busy, while someone pushed me forward. A well-manicured hand patted me on my shoulder, as a whisper sunk into me like an icy dagger.\n\n“Now now,” Leah Babin whispered. “How about you come with me, and we’ll leave these boys to play, hm?”\n\nI couldn’t say anything. Do anything. I was being pushed forward, one high-heeled step at a time. I tried to scream for help, to move, but my joints were all locked up. I tried to force my mouth open, but I couldn’t. I was trapped inside myself, and no one was coming to help me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLeah pushed me forward, away from Evan and Fred. She rolled me down to the edge of the lake. The fireworks from downtown bathed the snow in waves of red and gold. Leah leaned in close.\n\n“If you don’t mind, I think I’ll take that wish,” she whispered. “If you mind, just say no.”\n\nIt was cruel. Nothing but cruel. And with a chuckle, the world started moving.\n\nShe’d pushed me, and as I rolled into the icy waters of Frog Lake, I saw Leah and Roy smiling at me from the side of the road.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy body was so heavy from the metal that I couldn’t do anything but to sink. Deeper and deeper into the lake. There was no light, and barely any sensation. I couldn’t even feel myself drowning. Just this all-encompassing, complete darkness.\n\nNo touch. No taste. No sight.\n\nAnd finally, no thoughts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n. . .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut somewhere, in the dark, there was a voice. It was like hearing something through a door; near, but still far away. A mumble coming into focus.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Leah Babin is a fucking idiot.”\n\nI opened my eyes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA beach of black sand, overlooking a still ocean. A red sun sinking over a white horizon. My feet were warm from the glow.\n\nUncle John handed me a cigarette.\n\nThere he was, just off to my left.\n\nHe looked at least twenty years younger, and without a single stray metal hair. Clear green eyes, and with a pair of smile dimples that I’d never seen before.\n\n“Technically, she didn’t kill you, so she doesn’t get a wish,” he said. “It was either the lake that got you, or that metal shit in your veins.”\n\n“I suppose,” I nodded. “So… what, does the lake get a wish?”\n\n“Nah,” he smiled. “No one does.”\n\n“So then what? We just… sit here?”\n\n“I suppose so.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe shared a cigarette, looking out at the still ocean. No waves, no wind. Nothing but the shifting sand under our feet, and the shadows cast from the red glow of the sinking sun.\n\n“Why are you here?” I asked.\n\n“Not sure,” John shrugged. “Maybe as a comfort.”\n\n“A comfort?”\n\n“It’ll get real dark, real soon,” said John, nodding at the horizon. “It’s scary.”\n\n“Evan said it takes strength to die.”\n\n“Then I guess we’re heavyweight champions.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs the sun sunk towards the horizon, we got up. It was a nice view. I could do worse.\n\nBut there was something off.\n\nThe sun stopped moving. Moments later, it changed direction; going back up.\n\nIt shifted. It changed size. And finally, I could see it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt wasn’t a sun.\n\n**It was an eye.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI could *feel* it; a being beyond my understanding. A guiding voice behind the curtain of my world. It had watched me all year long. It had waited for me. And now that I was here, it wasn’t sure what to do.\n\nJohn looked at it, then at me. Then back at the eye. His jaw drop in recognition.\n\n“Hey!” he shouted at me, grabbing my shoulders. “It’s… it’s still watching!”\n\n“So? What do you-“\n\n“It’s not over!” he laughed. “It hasn’t stopped watching, so it… it’s not over! It can’t be!”\n\nIt wouldn’t watch a corpse. But it would watch the **Yearwalker**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly, a darkness. My eyes opening under water. Something pulling me forward. Something else on the bottom of the lake; someone who had been dumped there, just like me.\n\nUnder water, a silhouette of a metal skull with a red eye.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI blinked, and I’m back on that beach. Feeling the sand sink into my feet. Uncle John rustling me back and forth.\n\n“You gotta make your wish!” he screamed. “You gotta do it!”\n\n“I-I… I don’t know!” I gasped. “I don’t know what… how…”\n\nI grabbed him back and looked him in the eyes.\n\n“You should go back,” I said. “You shouldn’t have died.”\n\n“**No!**”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI’m back under water. The decayed corpse pushes down on me, hands closing around my throat. Crushing my windpipe. I feel my heart beating harder, but slower. Fading. Panicking.\n\nDying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJohn is hugging me. Crying into my ear.\n\n“I’d planned on doing this,” he admits. “I wanted to take it from you. I wanted it all along.”\n\n“What are you-“\n\n“*I’m taking* *your fucking wish*.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd simultaneously, my eyes see the red eye of Uncle John’s decaying corpse, staring down at me.\n\nAnd beyond, the eye of a red sun.\n\nAnd as they blink, my world goes dark.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n. . .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWaking up from unconsciousness wasn’t new to me. It’s just like blinking. One moment you’re there, one moment you’re not. I was lying on my back, floating in the ice-cold water. I must’ve gotten lighter; there was no metal to sink me anymore. I could taste dirt, and feel mud under my fingernails.\n\nThe fireworks were still going strong.\n\nSomeone in the distance was wishing everyone, everywhere, a ‘Happy New Year’.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUncle John had taken my wish, to make sure I wouldn’t waste it on him.\n\n*Motherfucker*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI turned around and crawled out of the lake. Freezing and shuddering, I stood back up. Leah and Roy were long gone. Fred too. All that remained was Evan, standing on the side of the road, trying his best to stay upright. He was exhausted and bleeding.\n\nWe weren’t okay;\n\nBut we were gonna make it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo why am I writing this?\n\nWell, perhaps I just don’t want people to throw themselves into something they don’t understand. Maybe it’s just a metaphor for appreciating what little you have. Maybe it’s the pain and process of change, or the dangers of the unknown.\n\nHonestly, it could be all of it. It could be neither. An experience is an experience, it doesn’t have to have a point. Some things just happen to you; not everything is commentary.\n\nThat year was the most horrifying of my life. I wouldn’t wish it on anyone. It has changed me in ways I can’t even imagine. My past self is barely a memory. How the fuck do you see what I’ve seen and not break? How do you live, knowing there are so many horrors that can end you, at a moment’s notice, without any choice or input?\n\nAnd yet, I’m still here. You are too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUncle John left me a sizeable inheritance and royalties from some of his apps. I’m finally going to culinary school. I’m not staying in Tomskog, but I’m not moving back home either. I think I’ll settle in Michigan; I know people there.\n\nI think Evan still lives in that house, back in Tomskog. God knows what he’s working on, but I have a sneaking suspicion I’ll never truly know.\n\nAnd for the time being, everything will be as normal as I can keep it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I know, in my heart of hearts, that this won’t be my last Yearwalk.\n\nI know I’ll see Uncle John again.",

        "text": "Have you ever felt like you’re being watched, then you look around and no one’s there. Have you ever felt like there was just someone peeking around the corner at you and then when you go to check, nothing.\n\nThe reason I say this is because of my recent experience at my new job. My name is Robert and I’m a subway maintenance repair man. I have never really liked the job, but based on my current life circumstances, I couldn't afford to quit. After high school I really didn’t know what to do. I passed through many jobs working at fast food places, then ended up at a hardware store.\n\nAfter 4 years of rotating through jobs I made my decision to go to college. After getting my degree I started getting minor work at different factories and ultimately settled at the subway station.\n\nI usually just do maintenance checks in the more populated area but recently there have been a few workers who have quit, so now I have been bumped up to do their work. My boss was confused and wondered why 5 workers quit in the past week. I was about to find out why.\n\nIt was early one morning when I got a call to repair a leaking pipe. I had never been somewhere that deep before to repair and I was going alone. I was always paranoid about going into deep dark places alone so I really wanted to get this over with.\n\nI arrived at the entrance early in the morning, like 5:30. It was still dark outside. There was a door beside the subway entrance apart from the entrance for the general public. After fiddling around with my thousand keys I opened the large, heavy door. It squeaked as I looked down the grimy stairs that led to the blackness that laid under the city.\n\nThere were small lights on the wall. I walked down the stairs and closed the door behind me. I also had a light on my hat just in case I went into a darker area. I slowly crept down the stairs. The stairs were moist and the air was very thick in this area. After my trek down the stairs, I made it to the bottom.\n\nThe hallway was very thin at the bottom and it was dead silent, except for the sound of dripping water. I took a look at the map. I hadn’t looked at it in a while but right now the subway lines looked huge. I didn’t realize there were so many paths in the subway. I saw where the pipe was and I wasn’t too far.\n\nAs I approached I heard the sound of a subway passing by. The hallway started to shake, as I was just under the tracks. There was some dirt falling from the ceiling and some of the lights started to flicker. After about 30 seconds it stopped. I stood there in silence. Some of the flickering lights stayed off. I waited for a second and then decided to continue.\n\nAfter a few more minutes of slowly walking through the path, I made it to the spot where the pipe was. I took out my flashlight and started the inspection. After a few seconds I discovered the problem. It was nothing too hard, just a crack in the pipe. I grabbed my walkie talkie to report the problem to the maintenance office.\n\n“There seems to be a crack in the pipe.” I said into the walkie talkie.\n\nI heard the static noise through the walkie talkie. No response?\n\n“Is there anybody there?” I tried to get a hold of someone.\n\nI decided that no one was going to answer so I marked it down on my clipboard and marked off the pipe. I would come back later anyway to fix the pipe which I was already dreading.\n\nI started to walk back when I realized that there were 2 paths.\n\n“What the fuck?” I muttered to myself.\n\nI don’t remember 2 paths when I came down here. The darkness had to blame for this. I didn’t see the path beside me when I came down, now I didn’t know which exit was the right one.\n\nI stood there looking at both paths. Then I remembered that map. I could use it to see which one leads up to the exit. I reached in my pocket. Where was it? I looked around me to see if it fell out of my pocket. I started walking back to the pipe where I had been working to see if I had dropped it there. I shined my light around and there was nothing.\n\nThen suddenly I had a feeling. It was a feeling I dreaded ever since I was a little kid. I had a feeling that there were eyes on me. I know it might be hard to explain but my heart just dropped.\n\nI tried to calm myself down. People do this all the time. There's no one in here, the doors are locked from the outside unless you have a key.\n\nThe sound of the ambience and lack of movement made little noises very loud. Could it be a rat? It was the subway after all and there’s always rats and other things living down here.\n\nJust as I composed myself and was ready to walk back I heard it. It was a slight footstep. I could hear the slight splash of the moist dirt ground. I looked left and right but the lack of lighting made it really hard to see. I slowly walked back to the 2 paths. I told myself there was nothing there and it was just my paranoia playing tricks on me.\n\nWhen I arrived at the paths I looked at both of them and realized something. I came down from the stairs and neither of these 2 paths had stairs, they just went straight in slightly different directions. Maybe one of them led to the stairs and when I was coming down I didn't realize because I was tired or scared.\n\nWhatever the reason I had to get out of there. I chose the left path. I walked down it at a moderate pace hoping it would lead to stairs. I walked down the path for almost five minutes before I met the end.\n\nIt was a big black door with a padlock on it. I knew this wasn’t the way and I had to turn back but then I realized the door was unlocked. Did I unlock this when I came down? I couldn’t remember. As I approached the door there were scratch marks on the door. It almost looked like long, sharp fingernails were digging into the cold steel of the door. There were also blood marks all over the door and the surrounding walls.\n\nI slowly opened the door. Then a sound was heard as I jumped in fear. A chain had fallen off the back of the door and hit the hard concrete ground. The sound echoed through the hallways. I went into the room and saw blackness. The room was so dark that I couldn’t tell if my eyes were open or closed. I turned my light on the hard hat up to a brighter mode almost blinding me.\n\nIt was a giant room. There were about 4 or 5 desks in the corner with a bunch of papers on them. What the fuck was going on? The room was very big but also very empty. Other than the desks there was nothing in the room except for one thing at the back.\n\nI walked up closely to it to take a look. It was a metal outline of a man almost like someone had laid in a body in something to make a cast of their entire body. But it was metal and if this was something someone laid in they must have been 8 feet tall.\n\nThe outline looked very skinny but tall. There were also blood stains on the wall. After examining the wall I walked slowly over to the desk. There was an abundance of papers there all folded and wrinkled up. I picked one up to see what it had on it. There was a diagram of the subway system. Fuck, I had gone the wrong way.\n\nThen I flipped the page and saw a news article. It was mostly ripped up but I could see the head line in bold. It read *Doctor At Lastberg Hospital Arrested For Murder.* What the fuck? I looked at the paper more but couldn't find the name of the doctor.\n\nI was about to leave when I noticed a television on the desk. In front of the television was a VCR player. I looked in the VCR and there was a tape that read, *September 23rd.* It looked like it said a year after that but it was crossed off by black marker.\n\nI made a decision then and there that changed my life forever. I pressed play and it showed a cameraman outside in the forest. He was walking at night and the sounds of the leaves crunching were loud. There was a narrator's voice, very deep, talking over the video.\n\n“Here we are in the woods. It is about 1:46 in the morning and it’s almost time. I’ve been waiting for this for a long time.”\n\nThe voice spoke in a deep yet somewhat calming tone.\n\nThe camera looked around when it spotted a tent in the woods. There was a small light in the tent with the silhouette of 2 people. I slowly approached the tent.\n\n“Tonight is the night I’ll make history. After this nothing will ever be the same.”\n\nThe camera slowly walked up and then stopped in its tracks. The camera slowly turns around to face the camera man. I jumped in fear.\n\nHis face. It was the most terrifying thing I had ever seen. It was almost distorted in the night but he was wearing a crooked grin. He let out the most sinister laugh I had ever heard. I ripped the plug out of the wall at the sight of this.\n\nI thought this was way too weird for me so I started to leave when I heard a sound. It sounded like breathing. I stopped for a second. This I could hear. The footstep earlier might have been nothing but I stood there listening, making sure I was not dreaming or making this up. I could hear heavy breathing like a bear.\n\nThis was it, the worst of my fear actually coming true. I stood there hoping it would go away, hoping I would wake up and find out it was all a dream.\n\nI decided to slowly walk out of the room when I hit something. It was the chain and it was connected to something. I looked at the door and the chain had been cut from a metal pole beside the door.\n\nI then heard a footstep. The same one as before. I didn’t even look back. I started to run as fast as I could down the hallway. I could hear the footsteps coming up behind me. I finally got to the section where the hallways part. I went the other way, the way I should have gone the first time. I ran up the stairs.\n\nI could hear the sound of something running fast up the stairs behind me. The metal from the stairs clanged together and it was loud.\n\nAs I was running I reached for my key. It was in my pocket and was hard to get when running, but I couldn't stop running. After struggling with my keys I finally stopped for a split second to grab them. I took them out of my pocket and started to run. My foot slipped and I fell on the stairs.\n\n“Fuck!” I yelled as I smashed my elbow on the steel stairs.\n\nMy hat had fallen off and the light broke as it hit the ground. It was completely black.\n\nI had dropped the keys and I couldn't find them. I flashed my light around looking for the keys and then suddenly stopped. I heard the footsteps stop. There was a heavy breathing sound as I heard the footsteps slowly approach. I just laid there not even breathing.\n\nThen I heard the sound of the breathing getting quieter as the footsteps walked away back down the stairs. As soon as the footsteps got far, I moved my hand around on the ground looking for the keys. Luckily that didn’t fall through the metal holes so I picked them up and slowly headed for the door. I reached it and as quietly as I could and unlocked the door and left.\n\nIt was very bright outside. I was there for about an hour. I went back to the maintenance office to notify my boss of the pipe issue. Should I tell him about what happened? Would he even believe me?\n\nI decided not to tell him because thinking about it there was no logical explanation. I entered his office to see him sitting at his desk.\n\n“Hello, sir.” I said to him,\n\n“Hey, Robert. Come on in and take a seat.” he replied.\n\nI walked in and took a seat on the one chair that was in his office for visitors.\n\n“You look warm. It’s not very nice down there. Would you like some water?” he said.\n\n“No thanks,” I replied, “I’m fine.”\n\nI really just wanted to go home and forget this ever happened.\n\n“What seems to be the problem down there?” he started.\n\n“The pipe cracked.” I said hesitantly.\n\n“Oh, not too bad I hope. We’ll order one and replace it in a few days,” he said, “It’s not causing that much damage so we can afford to wait a bit.”\n\nI looked at him to consider whether I should let him know about what just happened. He looked at my elbow.\n\n“Hey son, what happened to your arm?” he inquired.\n\n“Um, I tripped. Hey, what’s down their other than the pipes?” I quickly changed the subject.\n\n“Nothing really.” he replied, “why do you ask?”\n\n“I was down there and I took a wrong turn and ended up in a large room with lots of chains in it and a desk.”\n\n“Wait, what,” he replied, “what are you talking about, there's no room with a desk and chains.”\n\nBased on his reaction here I decided to leave out the part about the thing that chased me.\n\n“Alright never mind, pretend I never asked.” I said.\n\n“Hey, watch out down there, it might be dangerous,” he said, “stick to the path.”\n\n“Yes, sir.” I replied.\n\nWe sat in silence for a few seconds when he decided to speak.\n\n“Hey, I’ll send Bradley with you to change the pipe, right?”\n\nMy heart dropped. There was no way I was going down there again, but I had too. He was my boss and I couldn’t tell him no. I needed this job or I would have no money at all.\n\n“Alright” I said.\n\nI walked out of the office and went home. I sat at home wondering what to do. After days of thinking about it I did nothing until today. \n\nThe new pipe came in last night and in a few hours I’m going to go down there and change it.",

        "text": "My dad said I was never supposed to amount to anything. He said I would never find love, or family, and that I was meant for the gutter. He was a real piece of work, and then he died. He got into a stupid fight that ended with a knife between his ribs. After that, I was on my own. I dropped out of high school while he was alive, washing dishes to pay the bills for our shitty, cramped RV. So, a year after he died, I worked on getting my GED. \n\nThat’s when I met Martha. Martha was the exact opposite of me. I was an awkward loner with a chip on his shoulder, she could win over an entire crowd with a beautiful smile. I fumbled my way through a conversation with her, convinced I was missing my shot in real time. But I guess awkwardness was Martha’s thing, because that conversation turned into a date, which turned into a relationship and finally marriage. I worked as a bartender while she continued to study for her computer science degree. Yeah, kind of obvious which one of us was the smarter one.\n\nBeing a bartender was sort of a blessing in disguise. I was able to talk to people, make friends, and improve my social skills. That’s how I became friends with Rob. Rob was a real estate agent a few years older than me, and it was thanks to him that Martha and I were able to eventually purchase our house. We ended up being Rob’s next door neighbor, the two of us sharing a cul-de-sac that sat atop a small hill. Behind the cul-de-sac, a patch of woods stretched out over a mile or two. This was a very popular spot for the neighborhood kids to run around in, and Rob assured us that if we decided to have kids, it would be safe to let them play in the woods as well. \n\n“It’s a very safe neighborhood,” Rob told me after he invited me over for a barbecue. “The kids are smart enough to not go out too far, and these woods aren’t big enough for them to get totally lost in.”\n\nWhen Bruce was born, things changed. Martha had by now graduated and was focused on her career, so I became a stay at home dad. I didn’t mind at all, I was proud of Martha for pursuing her dream, and she always made sure she spent enough time with Bruce after a long work day. \n\nI loved Bruce from the first moment we brought him into the world. He was the biggest middle finger to my piece of shit dad, proof that I proved the old man wrong and that I was worth something. Being a stay at home dad let me bond with Bruce in a way my dad and I never could. He was so cute, following me around and trying to copy everything I do. After his eighth birthday, I finally felt confident enough to let him play in the woods. I would watch from our backyard as he scampered off into the line of trees with his best friend Daniel. Daniel was Rob’s second son, his first being a teenager named Mark. Mark was a good kid, even if he sometimes fell into typical teenage quirks. But Bruce and Daniel were inseparable. Daniel was a year older than Bruce, and acted as an older brother for him. He was a bright, adventurous kid who looked after my son, and I felt safe letting the two boys wander off together.\n\nThis was our life for a long time. It was good, great even. I was happy, I felt like I finally found my place in the world. I had a beautiful family that loved me, I had friends and I was a much more confident man than I ever was before. \n\nOf course it couldn’t last.\n\nI had gotten up one early Saturday morning to treat my wife and son to a big breakfast of French toast and eggs. Martha came downstairs, lured down by the tempting smell, and smiled that gorgeous smile as she sat down at the kitchen table. I laid down a plate in front of her and she grabbed my hand.\n\n“It looks wonderful,” she chirped. “Thank you, honey.”\n\nJust then, Bruce, freshly turned nine a few months ago, came down with an excited grin on his face. I knew immediately he had something on his mind, so as he sat down for his breakfast I asked him what he was going to do today. \n\n“Daniel and me found a door in the woods yesterday!” he announced whole wolfing down his food. He gave me a giant, syrup smeared grin. “Me, him, and the others gonna open it today!”\n\nHis words gave me pause, but Martha beat me to it. “A door?” She asked. “What do you mean, a door?”\n\n“I mean a door!” Bruce repeated. “We found it on this big tree, with a doorknob and everything!”\n\nThis…was weird, to say the least. I wanted to tell Bruce that he wasn’t allowed to investigate whatever he found, but he had explored the woods for a long time so it couldn’t be that dangerous, right?\n\nI left my family to their breakfast as I entered the living room, pulling out my cellphone and dialing Rob’s number.\n\n“Y’ello,” came his voice.\n\n“Hey, Rob, did uh…” I hesitated, then took a deep sigh. “Did Daniel tell you about a door the boys found in the woods?”\n\n“He did, as a matter of fact,” Rob confirmed, with a casual tone. I immediately felt myself relax. I trusted Rob, and looked up to him. If he wasn’t worried, then there wasn’t any reason I should be. Rob cleared his throat and continued. “I asked Mark to keep an eye out, make sure they stay out of trouble and all that.” He chuckled and I could imagine him shaking his head. “Boy wasn’t doing much anyway, at least this way he can spend more time with his brother.”\n\n“So you don’t think anything is cause for concern?”\n\n“It’s just boys being boys, Rick!” Rob confidently exclaimed. “Do you actually think there’s some door attached to an old tree? They’re just letting their imaginations run wild, makin’ up adventures and actin’ them out.”\n\n“Yeah, yeah you’re right,” I agreed, letting out a deep breath. “Thanks for the vote of confidence, Rob.”\n\n“No problem-o, bud.”\n\nFifteen minutes later, I watched as Bruce and Daniel gathered the neighborhood boys, seven in total including themselves, and enter the woods through our backyard. I saw Mark sigh in exasperation and trudge after them, hands buried deep in his pockets and audible heavy metal blasting through his headphones. When they finally disappeared from view, I exhaled a deep breath I didn’t know I was holding. I felt Martha squeeze my arm and took comfort in it. \n\nThey would be fine, I kept telling myself. They go out into the woods every day and nothing bad has ever happened. You’re overthinking this. And yet still, I couldn’t shake the feeling like something different was in the air. A slight dizziness swam around my head, my lips were dry, and a small dense marble had lodged itself in my chest. Martha led me back inside the house and sat us down on the couch. She had been given the day off, meaning we were allowed a rare day of relaxation. She cuddled against me as she absentmindedly scrolled through Netflix, asking for my input on what we should watch. I half heartedly suggested a romantic comedy I knew she liked, but my mind was still on our boy and his friends. \n\nI must’ve fallen asleep in the couch, because I awoke to a high pitched scream. It jolted me out of my slumber, immediately sending me into a panic as I frantically looked around. It was now late afternoon, and Martha was nowhere to be seen. I called for her, but all I heard was a loud sobbing. Where was it coming from? The backyard?\n\nI stumbled towards the sliding glass door, noting the pink sky caused by a setting sun. It was late afternoon already? How long had the boys been out? The cool summer air brushed past my skin as I stepped outside, and I found the source of the cries. Bruce was standing there while my wife wrapped her arms tightly around him. His face was comforted into one of pure terror, tears streaming down his cheeks with snot covering the entire lower half of his face. Behind him, currently throwing up in my flowerbed, was Mark. I walked up to him and hoisted him up by his hood. I recoiled in shock when I saw him.\n\nMark was covered in blood.\n\n“Jesus Christ, Mark!” I gasped, fumbling back. “What the fuck happened to you?!”\n\n“I…I…” Mark was staring vacantly past me, trembling like a leaf. He was pale, and his eyes bulged out of his skull. Blood dripped off of his face, pooling around him while his clothes were stained a deep crimson. He took a deep breath and shook his head. “N-Not my blood, Mr. Bennett!” He collapsed onto his knees, dry heaving as he kept repeating “not my blood…not my blood…”\n\nFootsteps thundered behind me, and I turned around to see Rob barreling through my backyard door, followed closely behind by a few of our other neighbors.\n\n“We heard screams!” he wheezed, clutching his chest as he gulped in big breaths of air. “What the hell is-“ He saw the state of our sons and cried out. “Lord almighty! What’s goin’ on?!” He pushed past me as he grabbed Mark’s shoulders, inspecting him up and down. The others turned towards me, a few stepping forward to ask me where their children were.\n\n“Anthony never came back!” Bernie hissed, his bald, pudgy face growing red as a tomato. “He went out with YOUR son, Rick! How come he ain’t here?!” Other parents nodded along, glaring at me.\n\nI raised my hands up defensively. “I don’t know! Bruce just came back like this, I don’t know what happened, I swear!”\n\n“You were supposed to look after your brother!!” We were all taken aback by Rob’s sudden outburst. We turned around just in time to see Rob practically throw his son to the ground. “WHERE IS HE, MARK?! YOU COULDN’T DO THIS ONE FUCKIN’ THING RIGHT!!”\n\nHe raised his arm to strike at the boy, but Bernie and I rushed forward to hold him back. “Stop it!” I yelled into Rob’s ear, yanking him away as Bernie helped Mark to his feet. I was shocked. The Rob I knew would never raise a hand to his family, and yet here it looked like he was about to kill his son in a mad fury. “Christ, get ahold of yourself!” For good measure, I slapped my best friend across the cheek, and with a painful gasp he backed away.\n\n“S-Shit…” he murmured. “Shit…you hit like a fucking semi, Rick…”\n\nI ignored him and glanced towards Martha. She beckoned for me to come closer and I did, kneeling next to her to get a better look at my son. Bruce’s clothes were also covered in blood, but when I checked under his clothes I was relieved to see it wasn’t his. That relief was quickly stamped out by a wave of dread, and I cupped his face in my hands and forced him to looks at me.\n\n“H-Hey, little guy,” I said, trying my best to keep my voice calm. “It’s gonna be okay, you understand? It’s gonna be okay, can you repeat the back to me?”\n\n“I-It’s…going t-to be okay,” Bruce hiccuped, his voice barely audible. I nodded and gave him my best smile, which in this situation probably didn’t seem convincing.\n\n“That’s right, that’s right,” I cooed, leaning in to peck his forehead. “But you need to tell me what happened, okay? Can you tell me where Daniel and the others are?” Around me, the neighbors stilled and leaned in, everyone hanging off of what would come out of Bruce’s mouth.\n\n“A…a…” A haunted, weary look passed through Bruce’s eyes. A look much too old for such a young boy. He began to tremble, but Martha and I kept him steady and waited patiently for him to speak. “A…a knight ate them, daddy…we opened the door and a knight came out…and he ATE them!”\n\nA knight? My brow furrowed in confusion, and as I glanced around I saw much the same for all my neighbors. I turned towards Mark for clarification, but he refused to meet anyone’s eyes. I turned back towards Bruce and asked him what he meant, but he wasn’t in much of a state to talk anymore. He went back to sobbing into my wife’s arms, and Martha was quick to scoop him up and carry him back inside the house.\n\nIt didn’t take long for the adults to spring into action. Within the hour, we got in contact with the local authorities, and a search party was formed. We all stood there, lined up at the border of the woods. I saw Rob a few yards away, shaking furiously as his face twisted into a mixture of distraught and rage. With a deep breath, I stepped into the woods with everyone else. Immediately, I felt it, and I wouldn’t surprised if so could everybody else.\n\nThe air had shifted, and everything went silent. Around me, the sound of forty people walking became faint and muffled. I could hear my own heartbeat echoing in every tree I passed. I let out a shaky breath and a fog of air formed in front of me. It was the middle of summer, yet it was freezing in these woods. My legs numbly carried me forward as I tried calling out for Daniel’s name. The sound became lodged in my throat, and try as I might I couldn’t even utter it. My eyes darted from side to side and I realized I lost sight of the other search party members. I was alone, the woods were rapidly growing darker and darker and the flashlight I was given seemed unable to pierce the surrounding black. All I could do was keep walking, my legs seemingly acting of their own accord while I tried to will myself to turn around. I was trapped in my own head, and it was terrifying. I felt like I was being guided somewhere and I didn’t want to see the final destination. Around me, amorphous black shapes stretched in the corners of my vision, almost like they were alive and taunting me. I shut my eyes to keep them away but that only drew them in closer. Now I was certain they were only inches from me, I swore that something cold and wet brushed against my cheek. My eyes shot open in fear but I saw nothing. I tried to turn to look around but my head was fixed forward. I was trapped, and all I could do was continue to be led along against my will. How long had I been walking by this point? The woods couldn’t possibly be this deep!\n\nEventually, the blackness surrounding me parted, and I could finally see again. I stumbled forward as feeling returned to my legs, collapsing onto the forest floor. I laid there on my hands and knees for a minute, before I finally lifted my head to see where I was. My blood turned to ice as I saw what stood before me. It was a grand oak tree. And built within its bark stood a door. A beautifully, hauntingly polished wooden door, with giant iron hinges clamping down on its side. It was dark in color, much darker than the oak that surrounded it. A intricately crafted doorknob stared at me. The knob was a beautiful, unnatural silver. The silver knob was molded into a grotesque, monstrous face that I couldn’t bear to look at. It felt like it was alive, and I didn’t want to gaze upon it any longer.\n\n“…good God…” I choked out, pushing myself back, trying to get away from this thing. \n\nThe doorknob slowly, horrifyingly turned. With an ancient bellow, the door creaked open. It swung with such a great weight I thought the entire forest shifted with it. Something…something stepped out.\n\nI scrambled to my feet and sprinted away as fast as I could. Behind me, I heard the entire forest mock me with an evil chuckle.\n\nI don’t know how long it took me to make it back home, but I quickly found that sleep wouldn’t be coming to aid me. I sat at my kitchen table alone, Martha having taken Bruce to the hospital due to his shock. The only comfort that my home could provide me was a bottle of wine. I downed glass after glass, with a little part of the back of my mind telling me how much I must’ve looked like my old man. I sighed and pushed the alcohol away, grimacing as I allowed the memories of what happened a few hours earlier to replay in my head. I still wasn’t sure what Bruce saw, whether it was truly a “knight” or not, but it was real, and it was dangerous. It was in those woods, I don’t know when it first arrived but the forest wasn’t safe anymore. I wasn’t even sure if this house was safe anymore. I could feel dozens of eyes burning into the back of my head, laughing at me cruelly. \n\nWas I about to lose everything? I had spent years digging myself out of the aftermath of my father’s abuse, and one terrible night in the woods nearly sent me spiraling back. I felt so small, so pathetic…\n\nA sudden knock on my door startled me. With a gasp, I nearly fell out of my seat. I glanced at the wall clock and was surprised to see it was one in the morning. Had I really being drinking for that long? Who would knock on the door in this late hour? With a deep sigh, I cautiously approached the door. I checked the peephole and relaxed when I saw Rob on the other side. I opened the door, trying to give him a friendly welcome but failing terribly. He noticed.\n\n“How’s Bruce?” he asked me quietly. \n\n“In shock,” I replied, “he’s in the hospital with Martha right now.” I flinched as I remembered that it was my son who made it out, not Rob’s. Daniel was still missing, and I morbidly wondered how much of the blood on Bruce and Mark was his. “Shit, Rob…listen, I’m so sor-“\n\n“Don’t.” Rob cut me off with a growl, holding his hand up. He took a deep breath and shook his head. “I don’t need that right now.”\n\n“Yeah…of course.”\n\nRob looked me in the eyes, my frightened, tear stained eyes. He saw something in them, I knew, because he nodded to himself. “You saw something out there, didn’t you?” he guessed. I hesitated, then nodded reluctantly. I was shocked and a little disturbed to see his mouth twist into a snarling grin. “Good,” he hissed, before he beckoned for someone behind him. For the first time, I noticed that Mark had been behind him. The teenager looked terrified, but approached us anyway. In his hands he held two handguns, and he slowly handed one to me. I took it gingerly, looking down at it like it was poisonous. \n\n“Rob,” I began, “what…what is thi-“\n\n“We’re going to kill it.” Rob growled, taking out his own handgun and waving it around. “You, me, and Mark are gonna go out there and kill the son of a bitch.” He leaned in, and I saw a manic desperation in his eyes. “It took my son, Rick! And it nearly took yours too! It’s our duty as fathers to put this monster down!” He began walking down the street, turning back to glare at me. “Now are you in? Or out?” His eyes narrowed dangerously. “Don’t let me down, Rick.”\n\nI didn’t want to go back into that forest, I wanted to run away and hide like a scared little kid. But deep down I knew Rob was right. It was my job as a dad to do what was best for my family, to keep them safe. And would they ever truly be safe if this creature remained? I was scared, so scared…\n\nBut I was scared of losing my son more. \n\nWith a deep gulp of air, I nodded and followed the father and son. Rob grinned and slapped me on the back, while Mark remained deathly quiet. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw frightened tears roll down his cheeks.\n\nWe entered the forest behind our neighborhood, and immediately that cold, dead feeling returned. It felt like the three of us were prisoners marching towards our execution. I clutched my handgun tightly, trying to take deep breaths to keep myself calm. I was barely doing better than Mark, who began to sob quietly to himself when Rob pushed him ahead of us. \n\n“Lead the way, boy,” he demanded. “You and the kids knew where the door was, didn’t you?”\n\nMark nodded, and we began our trek at a snail’s pace. It was obvious to me that Mark was forced to come along, and every noise the woods made had him scrambling backwards like a mad deer. The poor boy could barely keep hold of his gun, but despite me bringing this up to Rob, the kid wasn’t allowed to leave or even walk behind us.\n\n“It’s his damn fault this all happened,” I heard Rob mutter under his breath. “The boy needs to make it right.”\n\nIn that moment, my best friend almost reminded me of my father. Or maybe he DID remind me but I was trying to ignore it at the time. \n\nMy stomach lurched as the door came within our sight. It was wide open, and Mark fell to his knees in pure terror. He began muttering things under his breath, but Rob yelled at him to get up. As for me, the instinct to turn tail and flee was so close to taking over. My legs felt like jello and my arms like lead. My heartbeat was pounding so loud it drowned out the entire world around me. God, I wasn’t supposed to be here! Rob nudged me forward.\n\n“Let’s head inside,” he said. I stared at him like he was crazy, but he seemed eerily calm. Was he truly not feeling the same fear as Mark and I? Or was he just better at hiding it. With a throat as dry as the desert, I gulped and nodded. The three of us filed into the door, our flashlights illuminating the inside of the oak tree.\n\nThe space was much bigger than the tree could possibly allow, I noticed. We found ourselves in a large circular room that was much better off than one would’ve thought. Grand tables and chairs littered the sides, with beautiful paintings depicting strange, alien creatures adorned the walls. I looked up and noticed an unlit chandelier now swaying with the breeze we let in. A single hallway led into a deeper part of the tree, shrouded in a darkness our lights could not penetrate. I was convinced that’s where the creature laid, and it seems Rob was quick to agree. \n\n“Let’s go,” he whispered, thankfully taking the lead. We trailed behind him, and I placed what I hope was a comforting hand on Mark’s shoulder. I knew the poor kid shouldn’t be here, I wanted to tell him to turn back but my own fear held me back. Mark turned towards me and chewed his lip until it bled.\n\nI’m scared, he mouthed.\n\n“I know,” I whispered. I didn’t offer him comfort. We were in the belly of the beast, and all comfort was left at the door. \n\nThe hallway was much less fanciful than the grand room, the walls were composed of dirt with tree roots jutting out of every direction. At one point we needed to bend down at an awkward angle to progress. None of us uttered a sound as hours, days even, seemed to pass us by. Finally, there was an end, and we spilled out into another room. The room was smaller than the first, but who cared about that. Because standing in front of us, was the knight.\n\nI don’t know if “knight” was truly the correct term, but I could see why Bruce would mistake the monster as such. Gnarled bark and mossy stone covered its true body like a mockery of medieval armor. Through the gaps I could see what looked like charred and emaciated flesh. The knight was at leave seven feet tall, but it looked even taller with the large sticks on its head, twisted and shaped to resemble antlers of a great stag. Long, black, spider like fingers slithered out of the bark and stone, grasping a jagged, pitch black…sword. I had no idea what the weapon was made out of, the thing didn’t even appear to have a hilt or handle. But it was darker than anything I had ever seen, and the longer I stared into it the more I saw those familiar, amorphous black shapes. They were twisting and dancing madly, beckoning me to become one of them. I stumbled back in fear, and drew my eyes anywhere but that sword. My eyes fell on the creature’s face, and I broke down into pathetic tears.\n\nThat thing…that knight had my father’s face. His bushy, crumb infested mustache perched on top of a menacing, evil sneer. Black eyes that pierced straight through your soul and left you feeling like nothing. I dropped to my knees and begged God to get me out of this place.\n\n“Jesus fuckin’ Christ!” Rob swore, the first sign of fear breaking through his tough exterior. “What the fuck is that thing?!”\n\n“I-It’s him…” Mark whimpered. “It’s the knight…”\n\nThe knight let out a deep sigh, almost like we were simply pests to it. It’s soulless eyes scanned each of us, lingering a bit longer on Mark. I saw the thing lick its lips like Mark was a juicy steak, and Mark broke into a loud wail. The knight tutted at the noise and frowned. \n\n“I…have had my fill,” it said. My God, it’s voice was unfathomably deep. I felt the entire earth shake with each word it spoke. My brain could barely comprehend what it was saying, so deep were its titanic rumblings. “I hunger no more. If you wish to leave, I will allow you to do so just this once.”\n\n“Like hell, you sick fuck!” Rob shouted, raising his gun at the knight. “Where’s my son?!”\n\nThe knight’s eyes narrowed. “Your son…” it rumbled. “Your son…is no more.”\n\nA moment of silence passed, but it was quickly filled with the loud CRACK of a gunshot. The knight’s head snapped back, and for a moment I dared to believe that Rob had killed it. \n\nBut then the whole room began to tremble. It felt like we were experiencing an earthquake, and with a furious roar the knight snapped its head forward. Its black eyes were gone, replaced with the red fires of hell itself. Its face twisted into demonic malice, and it seemed to grow larger as it hurled hatred towards us.\n\n“You damn, pathetic knaves!” the knight roared. “I will personally drag you to hell for daring to strike me! I will have monsters you could not fathom tear you apart limb from limb, until you beg me for death!” It raised its sword high in the air. “Mercy will not come to you! Now prepare yourself!” \n\nThe knight lunged forward, and in an instant Rob’s hand was gone, with only a stump remaining. Rob stared at it in shock, before he let out a bloodcurdling scream as this…as this black sludge poured out of his bloodied stump. It wrapped itself around his arm, oozing upwards towards his face. Rob fell to the ground and rolled around in pure agony, and I saw the black fumes of smoke bellowing out from his arm. He was being burned alive, with a fire more furious than anything on earth. Mark screamed for help as the knight targeted him next. The blade pierced through his stomach and he was pinned to the wall by the knight. \n\n“I remember you…” it hissed, an inch from his face. “You ran away as your brother begged for his life. You ran away as he turned towards you, pleading for you to save him. You left him to die like a coward, boy, and you will join him in eternal torment! Perhaps there you can beg for his forgiveness!”\n\nMark sobbed as the sword was wrenched out of his stomach, and he collapsed like a puppet with cut strings as the black ooze began to pool around him from his wound.\n\n“R-R-Rick…” I heard Rob wheeze in indescribable pain as his frightened, bulging eyes turned up towards me. “H-H-Hel…p…us!”\n\n“Yes, help them,” the knight taunted, lowering its sword as if daring me to approach. “He is your best friend, is he not? He helped you, didn’t he? You, who was nothing before, and who will become nothing again. A pathetic, weak man born to an equally pathetic father!” The knight, in my father’s image, grinned sadistically. “But you won’t help him, will you? Because deep down you know you don’t deserve whatever good this world decided to hand to you. You know you don’t deserve your wife, your son, and you know that you should’ve died instead of your father!”\n\nI was pulled back into that final night with my father. I remembered the shock on his face when I stuck the kitchen knife into his heart after he tries to burn my face with a boiling pot of water. I knew it was a fluke. He was always much stronger than me, he kept me weak so I would stay in line. And when I murdered him I knew it would only be a matter of time until the world came to collect what I owed it for allowing me my one chance to escape. This was that time, this was the world taking back every bit of good I thought I deserved. \n\nBut…I didn’t want to die yet. I looked down at Rob and Mark, and begged them to understand. I had to do what was best for my family, it was my duty as a father to protect them.\n\nSo I ran.\n\nThe knight’s uproarious laughter echoed after me as Rob screamed curse after curse towards me. His curses turned back into screams as he and Mark were tortured by the knight, while I would run through the hallway, crawling through the narrow sections like the pathetic worm I was. I burst into the first grand room, and watched in terror as the alien monstrosities tore themselves out of the paintings. I tore my way past them as they clawed at me, begging for me to stay and accept my fate. But dammit, I wanted to live for just a little bit longer. I wasn’t ready to pay my dues just yet!\n\nI should’ve died. Instead, I’m alive one year later. Martha and I took Bruce and moved out into the city, far away from anything remotely similar to a forest. Bruce…I wish I could say he’s gone back to being a bright, cheerful boy but he hasn’t. Every night he has night terrors, and he doesn’t have friends anymore. He doesn’t tell me about his day and he barely touches his food. We’ve tried therapy for him but it isn’t going so well. The stress of it all has put a strain on my marriage, and Martha has rightfully called me out on my pathetic parenting these days. She’s threatened to take Bruce away from me, only to immediately break down afterwards. We’re talking about couple’s therapy, but I wonder if it’s even worth it. I think I was supposed to stay in that tree, I was supposed to let the knight kill me like he killed Rob and Mark. Instead I ran, thinking I could escape and everything would be okay again. But instead in here watching my marriage and my family fall apart, and I fear there’s nothing I can do to stop it.\n\nThe knight is still there, I reckon. He waits for me, because he knows I don’t deserve any good the world throws at me. I can hear him in the back of my head, whispering to me that he’s hungry once more.
