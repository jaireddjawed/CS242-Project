        "text": "Me and my gf go to a pub quiz regularly. It is on every week and we like to go once or twice a month. The quiz is always themed so it's nice if it's something we both like but even when it is something only one of us likes it's still a fun night since we really like the food and drinks from the bar.\n\nThis means I've gone to quizzes with my gf that I know nothing about but that she loves and vice versa. This week was the quiz I had been looking forward to the most since it was on something I love but had never seen a quiz about before. As soon as the quiz was announced last month me and my gf made plans to go. The bar recently updated their food menu so we were also looking forward to trying that out. Alongside the quiz we made plans for a day out and to go to mini golf on saturday.\n\nLas week my gf made plans to meet up with her best friend last weekend. The day after she had met her friend she told me she couldn't afford the quiz since she had spent too much with her friend. I pointed out that I always pay for the food and her first drink anyway so since it's only a couple of hours she could just make the drink last if she had no money at all or only get one drink if she still had some money. I also suggested pushing our Saturday plans back a few weeks instead but she said no.\n\nShe knew how much I was looking forward to us going and at short notice I couldn't get anyone to go with me. The night of the quiz I was disappointed that I wasn't there and my gf kept asking what was wrong despite me telling her i was just disappointed we were missing the quiz. She then proceeds to sit on her laptop and spend over £30 on clothes. When she told me what she'd bought I mentioned to her that her excuse for not going to the quiz was a lie then. She disagreed and said she couldn't afford it but couldn't answer when I asked how she had the money to spend on clothes when she didn't even have the money for a drink at the quiz.\n\nShe said I was out of line and was being unreasonable and I told her she shouldn't be lying to me and she knew how much I was looking forward to the quiz. She just repeated that she couldn't help it and called me an AH for questioning her. Does anyone have any advice?\n\ntl;dr my gf cancelled plans because she couldn't afford them then spends money on clothes and got defensive/annoyed when I called her out for lying to me. Does anyone have any advice?\n\nedit: I posted this earlier but it got removed for being too vague/unclear so I have added more info and hopefully made it more clear.",

        "text": "We'd been dating for 5 months, got together and stayed a couple for 2 more months before I fled. Every damn time it’s the same process, only now there was something different. This time I REALLY felt the butterflies and I was so sure of her. But as soon as it became “official” I started panicking. \n\nHere’s the process:\n\n**Persuit**.I meet a girl, I become smitten and I pursue. \n\n**Honeymoon**. This phase is all good, we are planning vacations. I imagine my future with her, and it makes me happy. Hell, I can even imagine getting married to this girl and starting a family. \n\n**The Turn**. It's not sudden, its gradual, but there's definitely a point where I peak, commitment-wise. I go from being the happiest boyfriend in the world, to the beginning of the decline. \n\n**Decline**. This can be days/weeks or months. Eventually I get to the point where making any type of future plans gives me anxiety and I avoid any type of relationship talk. The more she pushes for commitment, the more I pull away. \n\n**Breakup**. My commitment phobia is at its peak and I view our relationship very similar to how a claustrophobic person would view an elevator. At this point I have completely disconnected from the relationship and I just want out. I look for problems/reasons to break up without them being an actual problem.\n\n**Aftermath**. (Mostly, not this time) Immediately following the breakup I have an immense sense of relief. My anxieties are now gone. \n\n**Rekindled love.** With my commitment fears gone, I now look at my ex like I did when I was pursuing - what an awesome girl she is, what was I thinking! She’s perfect! Maybe I should go back to her! (I never do because I can’t risk hurting them more than I have.)\n\nIf there is anyone out there that has successfully made it through their commitment issues or experienced this first hand, please share. I welcome any tips, tricks, insights or questions.\n\nTL;DR: I broke up with my girlfriend and I’m really worried that my commitment issues will screw me over in the long run, I could use some advice.",

        "text": "Do go into detail I've been dating this girl for a little over 8 months. She is a very type A extrovert, while I am more introverted yet it is a good balance and she is a good-hearted person. However, lately a few close family members of here have been having some medical problems that could be potentially life-threatening. Pretty much everyday day she calls me after work and unloads just about every new detail of their current mental/physical state (never good), diagnoses, and other intimate information that her family members haven't even told some of their immediate family about yet and likely wouldn't feel comfortable with me knowing. I'm talking as soon as test results come back she sends me a screenshot from her family group text.\n\nMy issue is that this is a daily thing and I don't know how to respond besides the \"cliches\" you know? I know some of it is just venting but it is starting to feel overwhelming for me because all I have the ability to do is \"be there\" for her. I also feel like at this stage and not even knowing each other for a year yet that it may be a boundary that I am not quite ready to cross.\n\nI have no problem letting her vent to me, it's what you sign up for in a relationship but is it wrong that it makes me a bit uncomfortable? Like I now have to bear this burden on a daily basis as well. Hope you all can view this through my lens and/or offer some insight from experiences you may have had.\n\nThanks so much!\n\nTL;Dr: My GF tells me intimate details of her family's recent medical struggles and I don't know how to feel or react.",

        "text": "I (M30) thought it would be a fantastic idea to surprise my FWB (F40) with breakfast, flowers, candy and a card. She just finished a huge transaction at work that she’s been building up for months. So I figured a surprise congratulations and some loving was in order. \n\nNow we are just FWB. We kinda have an unspoken exclusive thing but nothing concrete. I know she goes on dates and I caught her with a hickey once and she apologized for what she felt was  “disrespecting” me. So I felt like we had a sort of silent understanding. \n\nSo I wake up at 5am and get all dressed up. I shower and shave before slipping on my short sleeved, ocean blue, slim fitting button up shirt that she loves on me. I buy a bouquet of flowers, a card, candy and donuts before heading over to surprise her. I even stopped and wrote a bunch of cute and cheesy shit in the card with a couple of dirty inside jokes for a laugh. I know she heads to the gym around 8am everyday. It’s 745 when I pull up out front and see a strangers car in the driveway. \n\nI leave the stuff in the porch and get back in my car and text “Are you awake?” She responds, “Yes, But I have company”.  My heart sinks into my balls and I feel like a complete fucking moron as I drive home flushed with embarrassment.I text back and said “Sorry to interrupt” and left it alone. She text back a little later and said thanks for the stuff but no mention of anything else. \n\nMoral of the story, you should definitely text/call before just surprising a FWB. Might end up being the one surprised. 🤡\n\nTL;DR?\n\nTried to surprise my FWB by showing up early in the morning with gifts. I looked stupid af as I interrupted her and her “company” enjoying their own morning festivities.",

He hasn’t had that much time for himself in awhile. He lets a lot of his emotions build and doesn’t tell me when he needs time, until he bursts. I always have told him I will support his decision and be here for him. Yet, he still won’t tell me till there’s an argument or he shuts down. I admitted and apologized to him for adding to his plate. I know that sometimes I have. We’re supposed to see each other tomorrow. I’m not sure how to address him if we really are going to see each other. Yesterday, i texted him \"Good Morning, i love you\" and he said it back, except this text was very dry. He usually uses emojis and shows a lot of affection over text and in person. i understand why he didn't and i know he doesn't always have to. Well, he's been being hot and cold. When i started not responding and giving myself more attention, he texted me apologizing. As soon as i responded, he started getting slow to respond and ignoring me again. He randomly called me last night at 1AM. He asked me what i was doing and then got off. He didn't say 'i love you' so I feel very confused. This morning, he finally responded and I'm not sure If I should respond. I respect the time apart and need for space, but he has been very hot and cold and it's confusing me on how to handle this. Also, right after I posted a picture of myself, he liked it and immediately said my name over text, to apologize. I’m just very confused on the whole situation.",

I still get really frustrated when I’m the one who does a majority of the cleaning, laundry, cooking, shopping, and overall upkeep of the house and managing bills. We both work full time in stressful jobs, but because of their health issues that’s really all they have the energy for. They also severely struggle to do adult life in terms of taxes, bills, etc. Our sex life is non-existent at the moment as well as a social life. Most nights after work we stick around the house doing nothing but watching tv. I’ve communicated my frustration in the past and it gets better short term, but long term it doesn’t. They do not do a very good job advocating for themselves and actually telling the doctors what’s going on out of fear of being dismissed. They have been dismissed in the past by doctors, but they’ve kind of given up. They don’t practice the things they need to keep their condition in check which turns around on me because I have to pick up the slack. I’m just so frustrated and I don’t know what to do. Any advice?\n\nTL;DR: Spouse with medical condition doesn’t take care/advocate for themselves so that they feel/get better, leaving me to pick up the slack.",

He was a sweet kid, and didn’t act the way that he does now. The last couple years he suddenly gained this patronizing superiority, as if he’s just smarter than you and better than you, even if he has a better phone than you. Growing up, he got bullied a lot in school, made fun of, and had very low self esteem and was insecure. Weird part is, he was actually a much nicer guy during his insecure years. He claims to be confident and happy with himself now, but this new personality is just mean as shit. A couple years ago, he built his first PC all on his own, it’s a great PC, and pretty much like half a year after that, he gained the patronizing superiority that I had mentioned. Personality had completely changed. Its almost as if his self worth is literally tied to his damn computer. He’s literally been a different person ever since. Basically, when we’re talking, I will show him something that is of interest to me, such as a game or a movie. He completely ignores it, as if he didn’t even hear it, but whenever he says something he likes, he expects you to be all ears and always agree with him. I literally showed him this house I built on sims that actually took months, and his response was “good job?” If you don’t say anything that is of direct interest to him, he completely blows it off and ignores you, and changes the subject. I got a new puppy recently, and he also completely ignored that as well, then proceeded to send a picture of his steam profile. If I bring up a game he likes, he will sit there and talk about it for awhile, but the moment it’s something that I wanna speak about, i get absolutely nothing. Also, he is always obsessed with correcting me if I say something wrong. I can spell something wrong, get a word mixed up, and he will literally act as if I’m dumb without straight up calling me dumb. He’s so condescending. It’s almost as if he gets off on correcting me and telling people how wrong they are. If you call him out genuinely, and nicely, about something he does wrong, he makes so many excuses and pretty much denies that he did anything wrong. He does all this same stuff to my boyfriend too, but it’s way worse with me. I think he sees me as the dumb one of the group, so he treats me as the target. I pretty much feel like I’m never allowed to be wrong around this guy. I’ve considered not being friends with him anymore, but damn, 10 years is a long time, especially when I remember how much more awesome he used to be when we were younger. \n\nTL:DR. Friend gets off on correcting me, friendship feels very one sided, because he talks only about himself and his interests, but ignores me when I try to talk about something, unless it’s something he absolutely is interested in.",

While I was there he offered his bedroom for me and her to sleep in and said that he didn't have any condoms but that I could have sex with her there if I wanted to. He paused for a second to think about it and than said that I could. I took this remark to mean that this was something he was 100% okay with. After the party/club me and the girl get extremely drunk and go back to the room and had sex. The next day I see him is siting in the living room full on sobbing saying that I betrayed him and used him and cuckolded him. I was for some reason not expecting this in fact I was expecting high fives. I apologized immediately while also crying washed his sheets, I seriously tried to convince him to let me to buy him a new bed he declined but he is allowing me to buy him new sheets. I realize I was wrong I should have at the very least asked him right before starting if it was okay or understood social ques to the extent where I should not have done it. I was extremely drunk and riding off the high that the girl that I liked asked me to be her boyfriends right before the sex happened. It did not cross my mind in the slightest what I was doing was bad which does not make it right but that was my mind state at the time. I really really really want to be friends with him again however he has not budged whatsoever he says I am dead to him and it was worse than when he got physically assaulted and possibly the worst thing that has ever happened to him in his life. It's only been 24 hours so is still fresh in his mind but man do I really regret the choices I made. Does anyone know how I can continue this relationship with him? His girlfriend has also been texting me insults telling me to never go near him again. Also as for the remark he made about letting me do it he claims he was not serious about it but I really did not feel like it was a joke at the time. I messed up major and seriously need advice!\n\nTL;DR: Had sex on friends bed while staying over, it hurt him really bad. I want to fix things",

It hurts because now hes come around and claims he supportive and wants me to do what i want but I'm having a HARD TIME forgetting ALL that nasty stuff he said (called me a h03, said he didn't want to be with someone like that, i feel ashamed for wanting to do it and because according to him it was wrong and he didn't approve of i felt bad for wanting to do it eventually he saw the toll it was takin on me not going to the gym that he was \"enforcing me to go\" but it felt strange bc at one point i got called out my name, got made a suspect accused of flirting around and wearing revealing clothing, and i have done all this before this relationship and i never once hooked up with anyone from my gym\n\nTakes me back to this point : its feel like it always on his time, i hate answering \"what do you want to do\" bc once i mention will get turned down until he is ready to do it (watch a certain type of movie, go on hobbies i like, hanging with my friends its always like pulling a tooth to get him to join in on my activities\"\n\nhim he quit his job (not with his parents) to go back to school bc he wasn't getting paid enough at the job that wasn't with parent I'm sure they were not as flexible\n\ntoday we are both unemployed he saying he doesn't have time for a job bc of school i get it but we DO NOT have time to go out with friends he doesn't want to join me in anything i want to do unless its playing video games with him and I'm starting to recent him bc I've given up alot from the gym to my friends to hobbies to goals just for him to not put in his effort after s###ting on my dreams and making it hard for me to enjoy working out again...... he will make me feel like I'm not inviting him or like Hes left our but once i invite him its no not right now etc.\n\nyet I'm unemployed setting up job interviews since i got fired and also trying to help my friend with her online business while he just plays fornite and gets high and tell me how much this country sucks because we depend on money but yet his parents paid for his house his college and they stay giving him money when he asked. i HATE that he ruined what i had going on and he him self is still on childish stuff. all he has time for is class and fornite with his brother (Hes telling me how he might get out of college after 6 weeks back to \" help his parents start another business\")\n\nbut I feel like I'm looking at al l this wrong i know Hes very caring loving and communicate i just feel like he inexperienced in life bc of his upbringing but i hate how its holding me back from growing into the man i know i can be I'm not Faul or want anything crazy if anything i want to work hard so i can take care of my family the way his parents can look after him and his siblings\n\nmaybe its just my head or me not being able to let go\n\nI'm not even sure if any of this makes any sense\n\nAM i wrong for being upset? he claims I'm upset for nothing and that he is supportive but honestly idk if i can rely on him Hes not stable i don't want to invest time into another hobby to do what i want just to have more issues\n\nin the last 3 months he went from having a job to quitting the job so he can go back to college bc he realized not working with his parents sucks and you have to do more to get paid less\n\nto working part time after school\n\nto not working at all bc school takes up to much time but some how we still don't have time to go and enjoy our self's just time for fornite and getting high\n\ni feel crazy i hope this makes sense\n\ni recent him for being lazy and for ruining what i had going before him however i appreciate everything else like i always say if it wasn't for needing money we would be perfect but right now we cant survive off love with both of us jobless and him not in a rush to get a job or anything hes fine with what little his parents give him\n\non the other hand I've been applying for jobs since i got fired while trying to help my friend with her social media account for her business\n\ni hate how this dynamic works\n\ndo you think it will get better if we talk about it more? is it even worth talking about again?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n TL;DR :i feel like we dont understand each other. need advice on how to get over arguments that ruinned my personal goals/hobby while they aren't doing much for them selfs it feels. college is hard but to not have time for anything besides fornite, and getting high",

He asked for my number right away as he wanted to plan a first date; he suggested hiking and I told him perhaps we could do something else instead as I'm currently injured.\n\nWe moved the conversation to whatsapp and he told me he was going abroad for his friends wedding but that we should try to meet up once he's back - I told him to let me know once he returns and we will meet. That was 2 weeks ago and I've not heard anything from him since then. I understand he is/was away busy with festivities... but I'm not yet sure if he has returned and I am keen to see him. In a way it's worked out well since I'm still recovering from an awful injury, but I would like to get the ball rolling now. He seems lovely.\n\nWhat shall I do?

        "text": "Myself (F25) and my boyfriend (M26) have lived together for 2 years now, and been together for 3. I love him deeply and we are a good team most of the time. However, we do have some issues that we have not resolved. I have a lot of resentment from our first year of living together particularly due to our household management and responsibilities but also to do with his effort levels in general.\n\nI have spoken about this many times and he knows I have resentment for it, to the point where we agreed we’ll attend couple’s therapy. Before that though - he would like to begin his own therapy journey which I found totally reasonable and fair. In the mean time I’ve been more honest about his short comings in the moment to try and prevent more disappointment.\n\nI was happy to leave everything there, we wait for him to feel comfortable, then go to couples therapy. However, it’s now made me lose sexual attraction towards him. At first I thought it was a libido issue on my part, but it isn’t. I just don’t feel it towards him at the moment. I still think he is beautiful and all the things physically that attracted me to him are still valid but I don’t have “it” whatever it is. I don’t want to let this go too far to the point where I love him like a family member - but that’s my fear. \n\nAfter reflecting, I do think this backed up emotional clog is to do with it. But now I’m not sure what to do. I believe in transparency, so I do think I need to tell him, but it is such a painful thing so say I don’t even know where to begin?\n\n\ntldr: I’ve lost sexual attraction to my boyfriend due to resentment, how do I move forward/tell him?",

        "text": "Hi everyone, I've (m27) been in a relationship with my girlfriend (f26) for about 6 months now and things are relatively good. \n\nOne issue I've noticed is that with most choices or actions I'm taking when she is near (What groceries I'm getting for example) I end up having to \"JADE\" (Justify, Argue, Defend, Explain) and it can get exhausting. \n\nI've spoken to her once about this before 3 months in but it seems like it's still an issue. \n\nFrom talking to family, therapist, and reading online it seems like the way to go is by saying things like 'I just wanted to do it this way' and avoid having to do any JADE. However I think this will cause conflict when I deny giving her any Justification or Explaination. \n\nI mention something I find to be an issue in a relationship to someone up to three times before deciding that the relationship will not last. It seems like the advice I'm getting is to let fights happen. \n\nThe way I see it this is trying to implode the relationship by causing fights and seeing if we can work through them. \n\nTL;DR:\nAfter you state your boundaries a couple times should you overtly call the other person out when they cross them and cause conflict? Or should you covertly monitor and decide if the relationship is over and avoid conflict?\n\nI'd like to hear someone's experience doing the overt method.\n\nThanks for your time.",

        "text": "My boyfriend and I have been dating for under a year and both of us have had experienced dating with multiple other partners/arrangements. \n\nFairly early on into our relationship I shared with him that due to an adolescent eating disorder and some negative experiences with past partners that I am particularly sensitive about body-related jokes. Additionally since we’ve started dating I’ve struggled with acne which has made me very insecure about my appearance.\n\nHe started making passive jokes about these things that were funny, but slightly rubbed me the wrong way. He also made comments about me being masculine and about my genitals having an abnormal appearance (I’m a cis woman). He insisted that these were meant as compliments, but they made me feel badly about myself. I brought these things up a handful of times and asked him to stop. He argued that he didn’t intend to hurt my feelings, but agreed.\n\nOver the next few months he made a few comments here or there which culminated in him mocking my smile (my front teeth stick out a bit). I broke down and told him it feels like I can’t be comfortable around him and I’m constantly concerned with how I look. He was very apologetic and insisted he doesn’t think I’m unattractive and the jokes about my appearance subsided for awhile.\n\nHe’s more recently taken to a bit where he pretends he doesn’t like me at all (Answering my phone calls with “What do you do want?”, blankly staring at me when I try and joke with him, and pulling away when I try to hug him.)\n\nEarlier this week we were hanging out with a group of both of our friends when it started.\n\nFirst he made a joke that he likes “big girls” (I’m taller than him and a healthy weight, I work out multiple times per week). Then I was trying to get his attention and he intentionally rolled his eyes at me which multiple of our friends seemed shocked by. Finally, when the group was discussing someone who claimed to be a doppelgänger for a well known overweight celebrity he looked at my me and said “You look way more like x, than she does”\n\nAt that point I was quiet until the rest of our friends left. Once we were alone I blew up on him and told him I felt embarrassed and disgusting (I know I shouldn’t have acted in anger). First he tried to brush me off and when he realized I was really upset he told me that he makes jokes like that because he doesn’t want anyone else to do it. I told him I don’t feel comfortable being naked or without makeup around him and he got really upset by that.\n\nWe decided to table it for the night and the next day he made a comment about how the only thing he missed about dating small women was eating their leftovers while eating lunch. I completely lost my appetite and now I don’t even feel comfortable eating with him. A couple of days later he told me he would leave me if I embarrassed him the way and ex did at a work event and I told him it wasn’t fair to create rules for me and he accused me of defending her.\n\nEvery time this happens I have a more extreme reaction to it and I feel like it’s making me an angry person. He doesn’t understand where I’m coming from and has accused me of punishing him for my past trauma. I asked if we could discuss things later today and I need advice on how to proceed. How do I convey to him how I’m feeling without him getting defensive and asking if I’m trying to break up with him? I’m not sure if I’m more upset by the jokes or the fact that he doesn’t respect me enough to stop.\n\nTL;DR My bf makes frequent comments about my appearance and me being annoying and I don’t know how to address it with him.",

        "text": "So i’ve been dating this girl for a while and at first things were great. But over time she got more and more.. selfish about things. When we first started dating there was an equal effort going into this relationship but over time the effort from her side has clearly diminished. She always asks me to do things for her, as in big long tasks that cut into my free time and even my time with classes and school. I’d be fine doing these things from time to time but it’s practically a daily thing at this point. These things include driving her to class, going out and getting food for her, and other things. The main reason these things are an issue is because on a college campus it can take me hours to get her to class and then take her car back to its parking spot. i’ve asked her to stop asking me to do these things all the time but she doesn’t have the self control to not beg me to do them for her every morning and I usually just cave so she’ll stop begging me to do them.\n\nIt also makes me mad because there have been times where i’ve been seriously sick or too busy to take her to class and she’ll still beg me to do it, like it honestly feels like she has no consideration for me. And the main thing that bugs me the most out of all of this is the fact that she never returns the favor for anything. She never does anything for me. And she has taken notice to this because she’s told me before that she feels guilty for never doing anything for me but it honestly really feels like she doesn’t because 30 minutes after that conversation she asked me to go get food for her across campus. \n\nNo I haven’t had a conversation about this with her and I realize it’s bad to not do that and then break up with her over something she can fix but I honestly have had enough. I highly doubt she’ll fix her behavior and the fact that this was even an issue in the first place has turned me off of liking her at all. Because she’s also stated that she plans on not working in the future while I work and pay for everything, like that shit really makes me feel used. Like I honestly just see this as a character flaw and I can see her lounging around the house while I clean up and work 2 jobs while taking care of the kids in the future. \n\nTl;Dr: Girlfriend is lazy and selfish and I’m going to blindside her after 5 1/2 months together",

I wouldn’t have told them that if I thought it would be a problem.\n\nI’m trying to pursue something with him but he want be in a relationship that causes family drama, so unless my sister is okay with he won’t consider anything more than a platonic friendship until my sister is cool with it.

        "text": "We’ve been together for about a year and a half now. Six months into our relationship, I was over my boyfriends house and I got a call. I saw it was a guy I had met on Tinder over a year prior. To preface, this Tinder Guy and I shared no emotional or physical intimacy (aside from a peck) what so ever. I knew quickly I didn’t want a relationship with him and I told him that to him. Tinder Guy said he wanted to stay friends. I was cool with that but then he tried to kiss me several times the next time we hung out, I rejected him several times. This made me uncomfortable and at this point I didn’t want to even be friends with him. I’m not good at confrontation, I was too scared to tell him that I didn’t want to talk to him and too afraid to block him. Instead, I thought a better idea would be to slowly stop talking to him. It came to a point where I was completely ignoring him. I thought he would’ve gotten the hint… but sometimes he’d call me out of the blue after months of us not speaking. I didn’t think much of it and would always just ignore it. He stopped trying to contact me by the time my boyfriend and I got together… But then out of the blue, he called me when my boyfriend and I were together. My boyfriend heard the call and asked who it was. I went into full panic mode and all rational thought left me. I was terrified of a confrontation. I know how it would’ve sounded if I said “a guy from Tinder”. I was terrified he would assume that I was cheating on him or something. I didn’t want him to worry. So I lied to him and said it was a friend from school thinking that he would leave it at that. But he felt suspicious and asked me again later on. I panicked even more because I already had lied and I felt like I had to sell it. So I picked out one of my guy friends from school, said it was him, and gave him more details about this friend. Everything I said about him is true but he wasn’t the one that called me. Tinder Guy has since been blocked on everything. I lied to him again when I texted him apologizing for seeming suspicious. He even apologized to me for seeming jealous. \n\nI’m so ashamed, disgusted and angered by the way I lied to him. I’m in awe at myself. I haven’t lied to him about anything since. The guilt has reached a point where it’s eating me inside. I’m not sure if I should confess the truth to him. After being with him for so long, I’ve come to understand how open, transparent, honest and communicative he is with me… and I’m ashamed I couldn’t do the same for him in that moment. How can I genuinely say that he can trust me when I’ve lied to him? I don’t want to feel like I have something to hide from him. I want to strengthen our relationship and show him I’m capable of owning up to my mistakes… but I’m afraid telling him will do nothing but just hurt our relationship. I’m afraid I’ll plant doubt in his mind. I don’t want him to question every aspect of our relationship. Plus it’s been so long since I’ve told the lie. I’m terrified he’ll break up with me. I love him beyond words and don’t know what I’d do if I lost him. Is it better to let sleeping dogs lie? Is it better to come clean? I don’t know what to do.\n\nTL;DR: Last year, I lied to my boyfriend over who was calling me. Should I confess?",

        "text": "Not sure if this is the right place to post this, but my boyfriend has a habit of saying \"Don't do this!\" or \"Don't do that!\" - for context, if I put something on the counter where it shouldn't be (very minor example) or if I do something that is perceived as \"wrong\" in his eyes, he will say \"Don't XYZ...\" When he uses the word \"Don't\", I will literally immediately get triggered and cry. It's embarrassing because it brings me back to my childhood.\n\nGrowing up, my parents and the adults around me would do the exact same thing and always phrase things like \"Don't do this!\" and \"Don't do that!\", which I feel like has made me believe I am doing something wrong in that instance. Saying the word \"Don't\" has a negative connotation to it. Instead of saying \"Don't\", I asked my boyfriend to say, \"Hey, can you do this instead\" or instead of saying \"Don't put that on the counter\", I would prefer \"Hey, could you please move that somewhere else on the counter?\"\n\nI've heard with children that instead of telling them to not to do something, you should give them an alternative solution and phrase it in a positive way. I asked my boyfriend to use this approach with me instead because it is more effective and doesn't trigger me as much.\n\nAm I being too sensitive? I was looking into rejection sensitivity and this kind of sounds like it, but I'm not sure. I'm just tired of crying every time the word \"Don't\" is thrown at me.\n\nTLDR: I get triggered when my boyfriend tells me \"Don't do this\" or \"Don't do that\"",

But today i started getting dms on her instagram (we have each others accounts) with some guy. Around an hour back she was texting a friend of hers about how she doesn't wanna \"come off as desperate\" and that she \"wants him to text first.\" Almost exactly then, the guy, let's call him MF for obvious reasons, messages her saying \"finally got to text you\" and what follows is about 80-100 messages about them discussing go karting terminology and whatnot (im a sci student, not very into sports so i have no clue what the fuck they were speaking about) and he invites to her to some karting event on sunday. Then she texts her friend saying OMG HE TEXTED FIRST and then shares a post of his (im not gay but this guy is hot as fuck and like the complete opposite of me in terms of looks). They continue going back and forth and i think? the guy flirts with her but imns im dense when it comes to this.\n\nThis whole time i had messaged her an hour back and she hadnt responded. I texted her while she was dm'ing him and she ignored his text. I messaged her that i need to ask her smth but at this point i got annoyed and said fuck it and deleted the messages. After MF goes offline she finally messages me asking what happened. I asked her who on god's green fucking earth is MF and she's like he's a guy i met in the pool and he's a friend of mine. I asked her why was she scared of coming off as desperate and she just ignores the question and asks me why was i reading her messages. i told her bluntly that if i get 26873 fucking notifications from a dude who looks like he was casted to play Bruce Wayne i'm obviously going to check what's happening. Then she explains she's not into him and was trying to set him up with a friend of hers. So why the messages? Why was SHE so scared of coming off as desperate? Why was SHE agreeing that he looked hot and if she wanted to set him up with someone else why was SHE sending 5000 fucking messages back and forth without even BRINGING HER FRIEND UP IN THE FUCKING CONVERSATION.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: I think she's catching feelings for this dude who is ridiculously good looking, shares similar interests, is funny and is ridiculously good looking.",

When we got back home, he was going on and on, very emotional about a lot of things. He was telling me he has always worried I wished he made more money. (I never have, I’ve never said anything like that). He talked about his family and some of the regrets he had regarding his relationship with his siblings (his mother was very abusive and put the blame on him). He talked about how tonight was one of the best nights of his life because of how much fun we had dancing together for hours. \n\nThen he turns to me and says “I think you love me more than I love you, but I need you more then you need me.” And I legit don’t know what to think of that. I always sensed he loves me equal. We match each others effort and ways of showing it. I will admit, I look for more physical affection than he does, but he has his moments of “neediness” too, so it’s never been an issue.\n\nWe talked about it the next morning, sober and hungover. I told him I always thought we loved eachother equally. He said what he said the night before was stupid, and he came across in the wrong way. He’s tried to reassure me in many ways since that he loves me dearly. I just feel a little thrown off and taken for granted.\n\nThoughts? Is my ego just hurt or should I feel a certain type of way about this?\n\n\nTDLR: my bf said things during a drunken rant and now I feel strange",

At first I rejected him when he asked me out and he was very interested (asked me to give us a chance, go on one date at least, etc).\n\nI then became interested in him after spending more time with him. We spent lots of time together, kissed, cuddled, etc. One night he said something about something he had done before, and I kind of became judgmental which turned him off. He said \"this makes me wonder if we are a good fit. we need to go on a date\".\n\nWe went on a long date and had a great time. He then became distant for a week (would take +8 hours to respond, seemed annoyed when I talked to him in person, etc). The last day before break I was hoping to spend time but he ignored me. Even though this was immature, I removed him from social media.\n\nHe then sent a long text apologizing for being distant and saying he wasn't sure what he wanted to do moving forward after the date and he really enjoyed it and apologized for not spending time with me. I told him it's fine and I enjoyed getting to know him but it seems we're not on the same page. His next text had a very different tone, ad he said he didn't feel a romantic connection developing (then why was he so sweet and nice?).\n\nIt's been a few months and I have started dating someone else who I click with and have a great time with. However, since I live in the same building as that guy, I see him almost everyday. He Is also dating someone new. I have not talked to him since (even though we said we'll stay \"friends\" - I honestly didn't think I could be \"just\" friends with him). Sometimes when I'm walking by with my friends, my friends say he stares at me (which probably doesn't mean anything).\n\nI think I haven't moved on from him completely and was wondering what I should do?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: I saw this guy for two months and he was very interested.

        "text": "I’ve been dating this boy for almost a month. Something that bothered me was that he has kissed many girls before me (7) and parties a lot. He is normally really extroverted, but with me, he is really shy. I’m his first girlfriend, and he really seems like someone who never talked to a girl with me lol. He is shy, introverted, nothing from what I thought he was before meeting me. He is a virgin, and said that he wanted to keep his first time with someone he loved. We did it together for the first time, and looking at his behavior, I think he is in love with me. I met his mother, he shows me off to his friends and talks wonders about me when i’m not here. He treats me like a queen, and even injured, he takes care of me everyday. No one has been so kind with me in my whole life. He has a lot of female friends. \n\nThe problem is his past bothers me. My friends tell me to beware of him, because they think he can’t be trusted. I usually snoop through his phone, and he lets me. One day I found that he had liked the photo of a bikini girl that we both knew, he told me he did it a because she liked his photo when meeting. I don’t know what to think of it, but he tells me he doesn’t give a f about other girls and I can snoop every time i want. \n\nBut that’s not the worse. He still goes to a lot of parties. He invites me every time, but i usually decline. He talks to me all night long til i go to sleep. \n\nLast week, we went to a party with his friends. I talked to some of them, and they told me they never saw him like that with a girl. \nYesterday, he went to a party with the same people but i couldn’t come. We talked all night as usual, but this time he drank a bit. \nHe has a broken arm, and a cast, so he had to sleep over there. \n\nWhen we saw each other today, he told me two girls had flirted with him, and blocked one of them because she tried to force him to kiss her, one he knew since he was 13. \n\nThe problem is, while i was looking at his phone, he received a message from someone saying that he flirted with one of those girls. I confronted him about it, and he told me it wasn’t true, that she had flirted with him. He then told me that he had done a mistake. He said that because there was nowhere to sleep, he had to share a couch with one of the girls that flirted with him, in a room with 5 people. He said he didn’t know what to do because he didn’t want to sleep on the floor with his broken arm. He tried to go back driving to his house but his friends didn’t let him because he had drank alcohol. He told me he didn’t tell me sooner because he was scared i would leave him. He said he understood if i wanted to breakup with him, but he promised me he didn’t flirt with anyone and that he would never cheat on me. He said he felt really bad for his mistake and that he understood if i couldn’t trust him. \n\nI’m thinking about what to do. He is naturally a friendly person with everyone but with me he is really shy. \n\nWhat should i do ?\n\nTL;DR : I don’t know if I can trust my boyfriend.",

        "text": "This week, my girlfriend (together 5 months, official for 2 weeks) went to Berlin for her senior year spring break trip. She spent the past summer there abroad and became fluent in German, to the point where she can get around the city efficiently. \n\nFor our relationship, I’ve gone with the “don’t ask, don’t tell” approach just to avoid learning something off putting by accident. I know she has a trauma influenced sex life prior to us meeting, and I don’t judge her for anything that happened before our relationship. I’m no saint myself either. We have a great and very healthy sex life, and our relationship beyond sex is healthy as well. We often share past experiences as well as our trauma to try and give the other context to our respective issues/insecurities. We have slightly different political beliefs, (she is quite progressive whereas I’m socially progressive but overall more of a centrist) but despite this we still have very productive conversation. I for one have been cheated on multiple times throughout my dating history, which unfortunately takes a toll on my confidence level when she’s out and about overseas.\n\nThe problems arose this week when she began going out clubbing in Berlin. I informed her prior to going out that it does cause me some stress knowing that she has no phone service in a foreign city with only one other girl in her program. She acknowledged that my concern was valid, and quickly name dropped the club they were going to before heading out. I googled the club out of curiosity and saw that it was a techno/sex club. I trust her not to do anything jeopardizing to our relationship because she’s given no indications of not being faithful to me. Despite this my anxiety rose. She got back late, we talked on the phone for a while and she ended up apologizing for not giving me enough info on the situation before leaving. She promised to get me any information that would make me feel more comfortable before she goes out again. \n\nFast forward to the next day, she does the same thing as the night before, leaving before giving any details. They’re going to another club, and all went well that night until she told me that they tried to get into a different club (which is a full on sex club). At this point I quickly told her that that idea makes me feel very uncomfortable, combined with the fact that on that night and the night before she was wearing a top which was revealing enough to where her nipples were visible. She admitted that she was using her outfit as a tool to convince the bouncers to let her into the clubs more easily, and to help her get more free drinks from people in the clubs. \n\nAt this point, after I fully expressed my discomfort with the situation. She voluntarily told me that she would wear a different outfit, and not go a sex club from then on. So far, I think she’s kept her word and stuck to the plan. \n\nDespite the compromise and generally happy ending, it still leaves a bad taste in my mouth that she would do the things she did with no second thoughts. She admits that it’s been a long time since she was in a serious relationship, and she (paraphrased) said that she was subconsciously acting single on the trip.  \n\nAm I wrong for thinking the way I do? I’m not as accustomed to the life of clubbing and sex clubs as most of Europe is, but I try my best to be sex positive and support bodily self expression. For some reason all of this makes me second guess the relationship. \n\nTLDR: I’m (24m) having doubts of my relationship after GF (22f) went out clubbing in Berlin in very revealing clothes, while trying to get into a sex club. Am I wrong or am I overthinking?",

His colleagues even (when he showed me his office). Again, i was sad to leave.\n\nHe never texts me unless it is for e.g. to send me a pic that he is hanging out with my friends. I, on the other hand, use to text him to ask him how he is doing etc. He knows im visiting in 2months. But im very sad because ive never felt this with anyone but i imagine my entire future with him.\n\n**Anyways last time we texted was a month ago!! I guess he forgot about me. Is it too pitiful if i text him? I dont want him to take me for an obsessive crazy person. If i text him itll be smthg like \"hey how are you?

We messaged casually for maybe 2 weeks and he was very nice, even replied to my IG stories but he was just nice, that's it. Then he started getting more playful, jokingly fighting and patting my head.\n\nRight after that, I went away for like 5 days and suddenly he barely looked me in the eyes during a conversation. He was clearly avoiding me. I think he caught on that I was interested in him, I kinda feel like I made a fool of myself. Later we had a short conversation about politics and I jokingly said that at our group dinner that night he should explain the topic to me. That night I asked him about it and he was like \"hahaha it's too late to talk about that right now\".\n\nAfter that, I really felt like I should stop thinking about him or pursuing him. Literally one day after that, he started texting me at midnight saying \"oh I'm sorry I couldn't explain the topic to you!\", and after that, he started texting me most days of the week. I try to not continue the conversation for too long and keep it fun and nice but that's it. He even started being more flirtatious and direct, but never too much to make a clear statement. He even suggested we celebrate our birthdays together since we are both born in March. He even double-texted after that (to which I didn't answer). But the day after (actually yesterday) was my birthday and he didn't even say happy birthday.\n\nIt feels messy. He is fun and nice and smart but I feel like he is playing push and pull. I don't care if he wants something serious or not, but I do wanna know if he is actually interested in me or not. Every time I brainwash myself to stop thinking about him, he texts me. I also don't know if I really like him that much or if it's this pull-and-push game that's making me think of him 24/7.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:** I kinda like this guy but every time I wanna stop thinking about him he starts texting me all the time.

        "text": "My wife and I have been married for seven years and have two kids, both under age ten. She's always had issues with stress and anxiety, but over the past few years, they've been getting worse and worse. She won't seek help. She's tried medications, she's tried online therapy. Nothing seems to stick and there are always downsides that outweigh the benefits to her. Cost, side-effects, scheduling, etc. She works from home full-time and rarely leaves the house unless it's with me. This is her choice.\n\n\nShe wants to get out of the house more often, which I do my very best to accommodate, but we're parents. We can't just pack up and leave when we feel like it. Sometimes we can't get overnight childcare. I tell her, often, that she's free to go out as much as she likes with her friends and I'll gladly hang with the kids. Shopping, the gym, vacations, whatever. I love my kids and have no problem being with them for however long she needs. We do nights out as often as possible, take trips without the kids as often as we can. I try my best to schedule regular date nights.\n\n\nThe issue is that she refuses to do almost anything without me. I'm like her comfort object or service animal. It's to the point that she can't even go shopping without me being there. Frankly, it's almost like having a third child that needs constant attention. Any in-person social interaction seems to be incredibly difficult unless I'm there to mediate. And it seems to only be getting worse. I feel incredibly guilty spending time away from the home without her unless it's a necessity. I don't go out without her. And yes, I know that's not healthy. \n\n\nI completely understand how stressful work can be. How stressful kids can be. How stressful maintaining a home can be. We split our duties at home fairly evenly. But there's a lot of anger. A small setback ruins a whole day. A kid throwing a tantrum leads to an anxiety attack. If I bring it up, it usually leads to accusations of being judgmental and the silent treatment.\n\n\nIt's hard to watch. It's hard to live with. It's hard knowing that my kids have to see it and live with it. It's heartbreaking that I prefer spending time with my kids alone because I know I won't react to them with panic, anger and frustration. \n\n\nI often find myself in the car wondering how far the money in my wallet and gas in my tank can get me if I just run. But then I think of my kids and it brings me back to reality. I'm not a therapist, I'm not a counselor. I feel helpless, constantly on eggshells or trying to put her into a better mood even if I'm not in one myself. How can I overcome this? How can I help her? How can I make her see that she needs to help herself?\n\n\nTL;DR: My wife's anxiety is getting worse and I feel like a comfort object. Happy times are few and far between right now.",

        "text": "So I know this girl. Was always into her but wasn't sure if she liked me back. Slowly we got close and soon enough I would be talking to her all the time, texting each other all night until one of us just fell asleep. She finally told that she liked me back too and wouldn't mind giving us a shot. I finally got the courage to ask her out and she said she was busy for the next few weeks and that we should go out after that. Anyways, I understood and nothing changed much between us. We would still talk a lot and it felt that we were just getting closer than ever. But suddenly she changed. She stopped responding to me like before. Would take hours to reply (nothing to do with her being busy as she would be online), and when she would reply it didn't feel like before. Like something really felt off. She just became cold and a bit distant. I tried asking her about it, if she was doing well and that if there was something bothering her, but she said it was all fine. She stopped sharing details about how her day went, and well the flirting stopped too. And when I tried to flirt, she would just talk about something else instead of flirting back like before. \n\nWell, I knew I got the hint. Maybe she just doesn't want to go out with me. It was sad. Felt really really bad for days. It was like all those things she used to say just didn't even mean anything. The \"you're my favourite person\", \"I miss you\" , \"I wish I could just be with you and only you 24/7\" were nothing. It hurt because everything I used to say to her, I meant them. And after all those things and leading me on, she was probably never into me and just killing her time on me. \n\nI tried moving on but I just can't. I miss her. And I love her. And it really hurts when she talks about other guys. And I don't know what to do about it. I still talk to her, only because I still want her to be a part of my life even if it's just as friends . But everyday it's becoming more and more difficult. I really love her, I want her to be happy, but I can't pretend to be interested about the guys she likes. And sometimes it feels like she just talks about those things to hurt me. Because I have told her, even recently, that I still like her no matter what she feels about me.\n\nAnd it's affecting my daily life. Haven't talked to her in 6 days, after she told me about a guy she's talking too, and these have been 6 very bad days for me. I kinda want to text her, but at the same time I don't want to. I'm just in a state of confusion. \n\nTl;dr: A girl I like pretended to like me back and kept leading me on, and I still can't move on from her",

        "text": " \n\nFor context, I lover her parents. They're wonderful, stable, accepting people who have done everything they can to include me in the family. They've really gone above and beyond making sure I feel included- I think SO highly of them. My GF and I really have an EXCELLENT relationship. She's an amazing partner and we have so much in common- similar life goals, interests, healthy communication, stable jobs, etc. We're both previously divorced and know what we want and what we won't stand for.\n\nI made a childish mistake recently that damaged the trust between my gf and I. I hid something from her and lied about it. I don't want to say it was \"small potatoes\", because I realize how huge trust is in the relationship- but it was nowhere near the magnitude of infedility, drug use, gambling, etc. Still- I'm not minimizing it. I made a mistake and I breached the trust between us, We're working on repairing things right now and we have some work ahead of us to start rebuilding the trust. What I did was downright immature, but that's between my partner and I to figure out between us. I effed up, and I'm owning it.\n\nWhen all of this went down a week ago, I asked her not to tell her parents about it, and she did. I know that her parents are her biggest confidants, so I'm not entirely surprised.... but I'm feeling embarrassed and ashamed. This isn't the first time she's told them about our issues. I'm worried that my mistake is going to paint me in an unflattering light in their eyes. Perhaps I care a little too much of what they think about me, but this is really rubbing me the wrong way.\n\nAm I right to be upset about this, or do I just need to take this one on the chin and learn that actions have consequences? Sit down and color, because I'm in the wrong? We have a trip coming up to see them and I'm already thinking about sitting this one out- mostly due to embarrassment and being uncomfortable. Maybe that's just my pride talking. Any advice on how to navigate this?\n\nTL;DR: I lied to my gf and she told her parents when I asked her not to.",
