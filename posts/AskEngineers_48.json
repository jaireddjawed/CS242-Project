This is where I'd like your help.\n\nIn my 2nd year, I realised that I wanted to work on \"*Brain to Computer Interface (BCI)*\" and \"*Virtual and Augmented Reality*\".\n\nI am interested to work heavily on the programming side of things, particularly software but I also wish to work on hardware if it so requires. I am interested in Haptics but I wish to turn this into more full body/neural interface.\n\nMy final year dissertation was on me designing a wireless motion capture device so I have and am interested to work on circuitry and hardware design just as much as I enjoy working on the programming aspect.\n\n**Here's the tricky part, now that I am about to start Master's I am confused if I should shift to Mechanical Engineering or Robotics or stay in Electronic Engineering with a side leaning on Computer. Since I intend to eventually be working on BCI devices with implementing them to both Robotics and entertainment fields (VR/AR), I am confused which direction I should go to since** ***I don't really know which Engineering would deal with BCI. Is it EE or Mechatronics? Or perhaps an entirely different Engineering?***\n\nI was curious and interested to try Mechatronics but realised Mechatronics deals with more industrial automation, basically the field that combines Robotics and Mechanical Engineering more actively, so Idk if Mechatronics would be the right fit if I want to work on BCI.\n\nAny ideas? Ik I don't want to study Robotics because I am not interested in building automata. Rather I'd pretty much want to work in developing the BCI sector and using it in preferably build the interface to control robots or exoskeletons and other purposes. Thank you again.\n\nTL;DR Electronic Engineer wishes to work on BCI and wondering which field deals with said topic/research.",

Everyone around me is 10-15+ years older than me. At first I thought it didn't bother me but it has been over 6 months and I am finding it really hard to acclimate. There is too much of a generational gap. The work content itself is fine, but I seriously cannot gel with the rest of the team- we get along somewhat well but we have very little actual chemistry.\n\nAnother issue I have is there are individuals doing the same job as me with no ABET engineering degree. This is probably going to sound pompous, but it is starting to weigh on my mind. They have a different life mindset, and often talk down to me which bothers me because I feel extremely qualified with the credentials I have worked hard for. I interned at this place for 2 years so it has been almost 3 years with this company. \n\nSorry this reads like more of a vent, but I am considering jumping industries or looking for an internal change within the next 6 months - 1 year. What do you recommend in this situation? is there a more clear-cut entry level industry I can move into that actually uses things I learned in my degree with people my age, that pays well?",

Todays ULSD NWE Platts price is approx $1100 USD, whereas the futures price is approx $845. \n\nBasing the decision on a 12 month futures price seems arbitary to me, why not 24 months?

ESPECIALLY love the challenges as it involves a bit of everything, from project management to technical writing. I can also see why it has a reputation for being stressful, however.\n\nNow, my question: the grading criteria is a little... arbitrary at times, but the gist of it is that more details are generally better. I'm in a firm that bids on projects that range from software and IT to structural engineering. For some of these, I'm a little out of my depth but I've been managing pretty well by relying on the internet. Are there any resources/books that might help? Handbooks for engineering processes, general best practices in some of these fields, etc. \n\nI'll give you an example of what I struggle with: Client A for bridge design -&gt; proposal needs to have a \"Project Understanding and Methodology\" section -&gt; I'm left relying on Google Fu to find information, scouring through irrelevant links, and re-wording the scope of work (a typical practice). As much as I love this part, I could definitely use some direction (for the IT ones, for instance, we rely on Agile-Scrum and I can usually talk about that in the context of whatever the client needs). \n\nAny tips or resources for me? I'm in Canada, if that helps. Thank you.",

I'm sure I should be able to simulate the conditions in software.

Many of you are aware of zipper merging and other driving techniques to make roads safer and reduce traffic. Sadly, there are countless road users who are not. I decided to raise awareness on [zipmerge.org](https://zipmerge.org/). My goal is to make roads safer through education, awareness, and working with local authorities. Zipper merging is not something I invented, but I wish to teach others about it. In the long run, we will be working on larger and more diverse methods, but zipper merging is a start. I would appreciate your support as we try to tackle this problem.",

However, my boss is actually a pretty reasonable guy and also offered to hear out my ideas of how would the development of our department look like.\n\nThat being said, since I've been working on a lot of financial planning and mostly ROIs to justify our production development plans, I feel like there's a solid necessity for a position which would be a mix of financial and technical planning and controlling.
