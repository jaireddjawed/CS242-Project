I was looking at UCI's CS grad program and realized that it would take me four years rather than three years compared to other schools I am looking at. (I am planning on taking a CS minor at my school and taking 2 classes at community college to fill up some pre-requisites, then the first year should be taking a mix of pre-reqs and grad courses, and my third year should be taking the rest and finishing it all). Is there anyone who was in the same boat as me who would be willing to assist?",

And to top it off, we’re only graded on 3 big reports, but the thing is, the professor doesn’t grade them until the end of the semester….so we literally have no idea how we’re doing in the class until it’s over. I’ve been working hard and submitting my work on time, but I guess I’m just afraid it’s not good and I’m starting to doubt myself. I’m working on our second report now and I’ve had literally no idea how to even approach it, I’m just throwing ideas on the paper hoping they stick. Professor says there’s “no wrong answers” for the reports, so is the prospect of failing just for those who don’t do the work? Is a capstone grade more so just a grade of putting in the effort and attempting to do the work?Just stressing and could stand to hear some opinions/experiences—thanks!",

I am in Maryland, and currently the State of Maryland does not recognize graduate students as employees.   However, the push goes on at the State level. \n\nI hear different things about unions at other universities, and it is rather confusing.  it seems that at some schools, the union only covers TAs while at others it is for TAs, RAs, and/or GAs.  Yet, still, at some schools the union is graduate student only while at others they also represent undergraduate workers.  So how does it work at your school?\n\nI am asking because as far as I am aware the group pushing for unionization at my institution are TAs, and I am unsure of how this will affect the rest of the graduate student body?  I would imagine, and hope, this would branch out to also include RAs and GAs and all student workers.  So, if it is a TA union, would the bargaining unit include all graduate student employees, or just TAs?  I ask because due to the nature of my program, few TAships are available; most students in my program work as RAs, GAs, and sometimes with other part-time work off campus,  \n\nIf my school does unionize, and I am still here, how would this effect me assuming it goes through as a TA union?",

My PI is at another institution and is no longer the head of my committee. They are notoriously a horrible manager anyway and I can never seem to get a genuine answer from them. I do not feel valued or respected by anyone in my group that is still on campus. My group mates that I did like moved away to write or joined my PI. At this point, I just want to go cry in the office of the new head of my committee, but they don't and have never paid for my work...\n\nLong Version:\n\nSo I want to defend in May and at this point I don't know if I can. I'm wrapping up my sixth year. I have one primary paper that is almost done, a published secondary paper, and two tertiary papers. I have one project that seems to be wrapping up, but my advisor doesn't seem to think so. I have another project that has been delayed so many times idk when it will wrap up, but I just need three solid replicates. \n\nMy mental health is in the toilet and I'm seeing a therapist. I do not feel valued or respected in my research group. And all of my friends in the lab have moved. Idk what to tell my advisor about why I'm so burnt out. I just am. My lab group is very confrontational right now and it feels kind of toxic at times. \n\nThis environment and my mental health has been having me miss work more often than I should and I cannot seem to relax. Right now I am kind of freaking the F out.\n\nI am applying to be a post doc at a national lab and they want to write an F32 with me and I have a solid draft, but my motivation is shot unless I know I'll get an offer from them. \n\nI think my biggest problem is that I am not happy with my dissertation at this point. I mean I do not like that I have done so little as far as publishing. I could do two more \"baby\" papers that would actually solve some problems in my field. BUT, that project that is experiencing delays threw a monkey wrench in my thesis. It was not in my candidacy and one of the PIs on the project had me chasing rabbit holes the first year I was on it. Idk what to do, my PI is not a good manager and seems to give no good direction anyway. BUT, my PI has recently moved to another institution, so they are no longer the head of my committee. The new head of my committee is amazing and has always had my back. \n\nThat's it. Goodnight!",

        "text": "This is probably going to sound silly or menial compared to some of the other struggles shared here, but I'm feeling really isolated and could use some outside perspective. \n\n\nEssentially my question is whether it's a \"bad\" thing for me to be taking longer than my peers on my PhD. I'm in a social science PhD program where the \"ideal\" timeline for somebody who entered with a BA is to spend your first two years getting your MA (done), then spend at maximum three years getting your PhD, summing to five years total. I know the average time to get a PhD is MUCH longer than five years, but my advisor is making me feel a bit like garbage because of me falling behind this extremely tight timeline. \n\n\nI'm currently in my fifth year (third year on the PhD side of things) and have yet to defend my dissertation proposal, while all others in my cohort have defended theirs already either over the summer or earlier this semester. The way our timeline works is that you have to continue taking courses until you defend your dissertation proposal, and my proposal looks like it may take until mid December to be done enough to defend. However, I'm also writing a \"long\" proposal, where I'm essentially writing the entire intro/lit review/data/methods/table shells for my whole dissertation, leaving me with only results/conclusion/implications to address after the defense. Because I know that a \"long\" proposal is uncommon in my program (others only write a brief overview of each component, usually ending up with a ~30 page proposal compared to my ~100 pages), this whole time I've been okay with where I'm at progress-wise. However, my advisor has lately been making me feel like there's something wrong with me for being \"behind.\"\n\n\nLast week I had a meeting where she continuously berated me, asking me questions about why it's taking me so long (because you asked me to add more things??), what else can I shift in my life to prioritize my dissertation (I'm already working 60+ hour weeks considering my assistantship duties), and things of that nature. She told me multiple times that my delayed timeline is causing strain on my committee and that I'm going to be in jeopardy of losing funding because of this. I just feel like I'm doing something wrong by taking this long to complete the proposal at this point, considering what she said to me. I even mentioned how I was considering taking a leave of absence because of how bad my mental health is at this point, to which she told me to finish the dissertation proposal first and then we can talk about me taking a leave of absence. \n\n\nI know logically that this is an absurdly fast timeline, but it's so hard to get that through my mind when it feels like everyone else around me is telling me the exact opposite and that I'm behind and somehow defective because of that. I guess I just wanted to know y'all's perspective on whether this timeline sounds reasonable or not. For reference, I have written over 100 pages on this dissertation proposal since I first began it in Fall of last year (2021). This whole situation has also left me questioning whether length of time to get a PhD is something that people care about in general. As a side note in case this is of relevance for anyone reading this, I do not plan to go into academia afterwards. \n\n\n\nTL;DR - Is it \"bad\" that it's going to take me more than five years to get my PhD? Because my advisor thinks so and it's making me feel like I'm being gaslit.",

My dad knows a professor there that will offer me an RA position which means I will only have to pay in state tuition along with a stripend. However Virginia Tech doesn't give credit for research which is what I hope to do. In addition, since it doesn't offer a thesis option I'm worried that it won't look as good to schools for PhD which is what I hope to do. I can however do research internships during the summer and the RA position might help with that. For Penn State, I like their research much better and overall like the school better. It is also possibly cheaper than VT if I can get a TA or RA position. However, I don;t have a guaranteed RA position like with VT and in addition, the thesis option might take up to 3 years which would raise the costs. Basically, Virginia Tech is cheaper and I can get it done faster but I'm less inclined to take it because the Masters of Engineering degree isn't as great in my opinion but for Penn State it costs more money, possibly much more if I can't get a TA or RA position or have to take 3 years, but I am more favorable to the program. Currently I'm leaning more towards VT but I'm kind of stuck either way. Thoughts?",

I feel like I have no motivation anymore, and the thought of having to complete my dissertation, apply to internship/residency, and do a year of internship/residency is really weighing on me. Based on other people in my program, I’m still going to have to do almost 4 more years before I’m totally done with school. I know I’m not alone, because other people in my cohort are feeling the same way. But I don’t know what to do anymore. \n\nDoes anyone have words of encouragement to keep going, or are there people here who were in that slump and got through it?",

I know my odds aren’t necessarily great, so I’m also applying to some MS options. However, I’m running into some issues writing my SoP. I no longer have a career councilor since I graduated, so I have nobody to help me revise what I wrote. Having majored in math during undergrad, I’ve genuinely no clue if what I wrote is any good.\n\nIs anyone here willing to help me out, preferably someone who has already made it into a STEM PhD program? If not, is there some paid service I can use to get professional help?\n\nThanks in advance for any suggestions!",

        "text": "I recently completed my B.S. I've been working full-time for the full course of study for a tech firm, and it's all been paid by the company. I got the promotion I was hoping for (into frontline management) almost immediately after I added the B.S, but I have my eyes set on continuing my education in some capacity even though my upward movement potential probably won't be much in the next few years since I'm already a manager. That's fine for now - but I'm 25. I have a long career ahead of me and I figure I should get all the formal education out of the way now in case I ever get busier.\n\nWhat I don't know is how a formal Masters program will really help me. My own boss has one but admits it really didn't help him do much more than open the door to the company we work for. Several other managers around us do as well and share the sentiment. It seems to be true at my company that advanced education will open the door, but moving up the ladder is much more related to performance and tenure than more degrees. I suspect this isn't the case in certain fields, but it is in mine. This is why I doubt the value of a postgrad degree in my case. \n\nMy ideal career goal is to land a Director or similar role in my industry. I don't ever plan to go into professional academia. I just want to shore myself up with enough credentials to make it to where I eventually want to be while I still have the time and energy. \n\nMy company will pay, so I won't be taking on debt or paying out of pocket. I just really don't know if the path I want to take really justifies another 2ish years of school. If it will help me, I'll do it - but if it'll just give me another very expensive piece of wall art, it seems wiser to just stick with my B.S. and do the best work that I can for a while. \n\nThoughts?",
