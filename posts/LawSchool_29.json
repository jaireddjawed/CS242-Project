If she were to match somewhere else, say New York, Nashville, or Atlanta, what could that mean for me?\n\nThese cities are of particular interest to us, and the firm I’ve gotten experience with has offices in all three. Are mid-large firms usually open to office-transfers in situations like this? The thought of having to choose between a job I’ve worked so hard for and being with my lovely partner is stressful, although the decision would be easy - I’d go where she goes. \n\nThe school I’m at has a great reputation in our city, but not nearly the portability of, say, a UT-Austin. \n\nI know no one can give me a concrete answer, but I really appreciate any and all perspective here.",

I'm assuming most easily attainable 1L immigration gigs are in public interest. Don't really know how I could be expected to have immigration experience since it seems all in-school programs such as immigration clinics etc only come into play as options in 2L, so short of that just really don't know where to start to get my feet wet in the field generally, let alone business immigration in specific. \n\nMy grades are also average, so idk if I have any clout on those grounds. \n\nIk it's a rather niche field so haven't seen much discourse on it on this sub for instance, but any advice and I'd really appreciate it!

        "text": "I’m currently in my frist year of undergrad as an undeclared major. I have been thinking about what to do for my future. Yeah yeah I know the whole ”you have your whole life to think about your future“. I do know the big picture but I need to work on the small details. I want to go to law school to do something along the lines of international, criminal law, human rights,etc. However I don’t know what to major in while in undergrad, I know you can get into law school with any degree but I want a major/degree that allows me to get expose to the type of field I want to go into and get a decent salary while in law school. I was thinking to do dual degree of business and journalism because I can go into journalism to learn about different cases and have business as the “stable“ part but I fear that I won’t get enough exposure. However if I major in journalism with minor in criminal law, human rights, or something along those lines, I will get exposure but to make decent salary is hard especially since I am not very serious journalism. Any advice or suggestions on what I can or should do???",

I got one of those conditional, kinda predatory, scholarships where I need to maintain a 2.6 gpa. In general, for my school, first-year classes have a mandatory grading curve such that the average grade for each first-year course must fall between a 2.25 and 2.5. \n\nThat being said, I did good my first semester! I managed to end with a 3.9 gpa and I'm definitely not letting it get to my head because the competition for this semester already seems much more intense. Hopefully, I'll do well this semester too and I was wondering if anyone had some advice as to how I can ask for a full ride scholarship or if I should look into transferring or just make the most out the school I'm already at. \n\nLet me also add that I'm a first-gen law student and I'm just feeling very lost in general. I'm not sure what I want to do and maybe I just need to find a mentor or something lol. I'll appreciate any advice or guidance anyone has! Thanks",

My school is rather small and doesn’t have a proper pre-law program. I’ve also had trouble finding internships for undergraduates as well. Does anyone have any advice on how to get experience in the field of law so I can determine (before it’s too late) if that’s something I would actually like to pursue? Any answers are much appreciated 🙏",

I came into law school not feeling great, and that feeling has only gotten stronger and stronger. My mental health has been completely wrecked by school to the point that I’ve genuinely considered suicide on multiple occasions. I am struggling really bad with the concepts and I don’t see that improving. I don’t know what to do and I’m terrified of leaving because I feel like I’ll let my family down. This is not how I thought my life would go and this is definitely not something I’m happy with. I don’t even get along with my classmates which just makes everything worse. I have to remind myself every single day that I have an undergraduate degree and that I’ll be fine. It’s likely that if I stick out the semester I’ll get academically dismissed, and I don’t know if I want to put myself through that.
