        "text": "**Monday, 1 Month Ago...**\n\nI'm back, after a short, glorious vacation, and I might have missed The Coworker just a little. I was a bit late today (stupid time zone change), so this is a short one for you.\n\nI got a letter from school saying my student financial aid application has to be reviewed and I may have to pay $6k per year out of pocket. CW was trying to help me look up some grants and scholarships but unfortunately, as an adoptee, I don't know my heritage and a lot are based on that. She suggested I might be part American Indian because of my dark hair (um, no. I could be a body double for Casper the Friendly White Girl, though). I told her I didn't think that was in my genetic cards, and she mumbled \"well, I could have gotten grants, but the white man took my tribe away.\"\n\nI left some fruit in the fridge here last week and today it was gone; I asked her if it went bad. She said yeah, it started looking puny, so she ate a kiwi out of the mix and couldn't stand the taste so she spit it out.\n\n(Two weeks ago she told me she hates the taste of kiwi. She wouldn't have been able to stand the taste anyway.)\n\nWe have a client that is being funded by her pastor, which, as you can imagine in this line of work, leads us to believe the worst possible thing: this woman is sleeping with her pastor (although we don't know this to be true, it's happened before). The Coworker called the lady and gave her the amount owed, telling her, \"Just be careful honey, sometimes those pastors come asking for favors for Jesus.\"\n\nI brought her Burger King today (chicken sandwich with extra extra mayo). She left her Spark energy supplement and her hyper makers here today.\n\n**Tuesday**\n\nThe Coworker's husband asked her to go camping this weekend. She told him no, she has to do her taxes, and asked him when he intends to do his. He told her he wasn't going to worry about it. She explained that when they got married, she had 5 years of unpaid taxes to fix for him, and now that they're separated, she \"ain't doing it again. If he wants to skip the tax payin', let him. He can get one of his girlfriends to pay em.\"\n\nThe family drama story of the day was her son sleeping with his best friend's girlfriend. The two got in a huge fight (this is over one of the girls she dumped ice on last week) and aren't friends anymore. She had a lawnmower that belonged to the guy, and when her son went to return it, the guy came out with a baseball bat and smashed in the windows on his truck and banged up the doors before going after the son. He managed to get away, they called the cops but declined filing charges because, as CW said, \"he knew what he was getting into, ain't nobody to blame but him and his pecker.\"\n\nThe girl is still staying at their house, and CW is more than ready for her to go. She told her son to pick a whore and stick with her.\nI haven't heard too much more about the cats lately; the one that was so sick did end up living and she's now nursing it back to health. Here's to hoping they're all alive and well.\n\n**Wednesday**\n\nYou guys, I'm not even sure where to begin today. The Coworker and I were both out yesterday. Me, for personal reasons. Her, because her family is batshit insane.\n\nSo remember that CW's son has a baby and is on-again off-again with the baby's mama (who lives in the house with them). He recently had an affair with his best friend's girl (who is sleeping on their couch), which caused all kinds of drama. Apparently her son was fighting with his baby's mama, when the baby's mama took off.\nIt was early morning and raining, and CW was yelling at her son because she loves the baby's mama like a daughter. She said her son is a screamer, he should have been born a woman. Anyway, after the two fought for a good long time, the girl left. CW made a Facebook post about this, tagging every one of her neighbors to be on the lookout for this girl. The post said \"my daughter in law is mentally unstable and is wandering around town. She is on meth. She shoots up. If you see her, don't approach her, just call me and I'll come get her.\"\n\nAfter about 7 hours, CW found the girl on her family's porch (the girl's dad is in prison and her mother is abusive, which is why she's staying with the Coworker). CW took her warm clothes, shoes, and took her out to dinner. She talked to the girl about getting help for her addiction. Then she took her home and let her sleep in a warm bed while she had a come to Jesus talk with her son about the situation.\n\nMeanwhile, the girl her son had an affair with shows up and tells them all...THAT SHE'S PREGNANT. The Coworker says, and I quote, \"I will shove my hand up her vagina and pull that damn baby out. She better NOT be pregnant with my son's child, that trashy whore! She better pray God takes that baby 'cause if he don't, I will.\"\n\nAt this point in the day, CW told me she needed to go outside and smoke a cigarette. \"Hell, I should probably just eat the pack, with all this stress.\"\n\nShe's taken it upon herself to mentally fuck with the girl her son had an affair with. She's been sending her texts telling her if she stays in the house she's going to take legal action, and that she has contacted the woman's husband (yep, she had 2 boyfriends and a husband when she slept with CW's son) and DFCS and is gonna get her other 2 kids taken away.\n\nShe's having some issues with zits nowadays (I'm sure it's stress) but she says when she pops them she feels like she's squeezing a tooth or a little bit of brain out of them because they just ooze and ooze and ooze.\n\nWe're getting new offices next week, and moving into a bigger place that isn't right next to the bathroom. When I mentioned how happy that made me, she said \"every job I've ever had, I've been right beside a bathroom. I can hear every fart, every grunt, every smell.\" I gagged a little when she said all that.\n\nShe watched the made-for-tv movie \"Strays\" from 1991 (it's on youtube) today. The movie is about a woman who moves into a home that's taken over by stray cats. The cats start killing people and taking over the home.\n\nSo basically, it's based on her life and is probably foretelling her eventual downfall at the hands of the cat society she's built.\n\nHer stepdaughter also learned she was pregnant recently, and today she learned the baby is not her boyfriend's because they've only been together 3 months and she's 5 months along. CW's opinion? \"I love her but man, she's a bitch, and he's a big pussy for putting up with it.\"\n\nA picture of one of her grandkids was posted online from Easter. He was in a little pink button up with a bowtie and khakis, probably about 8 years old. She said \"Man, if that's what he wore for easter, no wonder he acts like a little [insert homophobic slur here].\" I asked her not to use that word in front of me, and she apologized profusely, and instead called him a little queen.\n\nMuch better, lady. Much better.\n\nToday we ate pizza, she had her Spark and her hyper makers and apparently something else because she was WIRED.\n\nIt was a long day.",

        "text": "*I write down my ridiculous interactions with my coworkers. Here are a few from the last month...*\n\n**On a Tuesday...**\n\nI was late for work due to a dentist appointment. When I got here, *** asked me what I had done and she knew a whole lot about it. It turns out she used to be a dental assistant, before degrees were needed to be such a thing. She told us a story about being on call one weekend and having a client with a crown that fell off. He called her (because she was on call...) and she answered and said \"sir, I'm currently drinking a beer, smoking a cigarette, and playing poker. You sure you want me to come in?\" He said yes, so she had someone drive her to the office where she reattached the crown in a drunken stupor. When I asked how she was allowed to do this without the dentist being present she said \"baby those things weren't important back then. He sucked on some nitrous, I fixed it, finished my beer, we were all happy.\"\n\nWe updated some client lists today and one of our client photos (we have pictures beside each so we know their names when they show up) was taken from Facebook. It was the client and his new girlfriend, who *** says is a cam girl and a stripper. Sure enough, she logged on to the girl's Facebook page and she was actively recruiting new girls on her Facebook page (so classy, I know). She had a number of very revealing photos up, so basically I looked at not-great boobs all morning. She said I should apply; I could pay off my student loans in a year. \"It wouldn't be worse than anything I've ever done to make money, and with your tits you should at least make some money off of 'em.\"\n\nFinally, *** has some squatters living in her house. They're girlfriends of her son, and apparently she woke up this morning to find one in a haze on her couch. She woke the girl up by dumping ice water on her (better than kitty litter, I suppose) and kicking her out. As she was walking out the door, another one of her son's girlfriends came walking up the driveway with a key to ***'s house in her hand. *** flipped out, snatched the key, told the girl to mooch off someone else, then went inside and dumped cold water on her son too because \"he needs to cool off. He's like a damn cat in heat having all these trollops over.\"\n\nI was late so I'm not sure what she had for breakfast, but she still hasn't washed out the ranch pasta cup from yesterday and I'm worried it's going to start growing things in it.\n\nShe did bring two boxes of Pop Tarts though; I'm thinking she's leaving the honeybuns behind.\n\n**That Wednesday...**\n\n***'s neighbor's house caught on fire last night. She said when they saw the smoke they grabbed their water hoses and tried to put it out, which makes me wonder if this was a grease fire like stated or if the cops weren't wanted there for a reason. Anyway, they weren't able to get it out with the water hoses but the fire department was able to get there before it became a total loss. \n\nShe spent the day on FB flipping through pictures, showing me before-and-after photos of each room. Now, I don't actually know this person, but I do feel bad for them, I just don't really care to stare at pictures of a house on Facebook for an hour. Every one she clicked she said \"that's gone. Gone now. Gone. Gone.\" or if it were only partially damaged, she would describe it in great detail. \"It was amazing though, because the pan they said started it wasn't melted or anything but stuff like the microwave and cabinets were destroyed! It's just amazing how stuff burns.\" \n\nI look at the picture. \"Dear, it's a cast iron pan. It's probably not gonna melt.\"\n\nShe got pretty mad at a pen today that wouldn't write, she slammed it down on the desk in frustration and it burst everywhere.\n\n*** did a lot of talking today. It was basically her rambling for 45 minutes about filing insurance and working for a dentist and her car and how much she loves to hate her husband (it just makes things spicier, according to her). \n\n[Here's her tramp stamp](http://i.imgur.com/B6EhcZm.jpg). \n\nHer son's girlfriend is back squatting on their couch. This morning she said she didn't have time to dump ice on her so she left the front door open and put a can of cat food beside the couch. \"Maybe one of the ferals will attack her and she will get out of there and not come back.\"\n\nShe pulled forward a little too much when she came back from lunch today and hit the brick wall outside our office in her mustang. \"Just a little scratch, no problem a little nail polish can't fix.\"\n\nShe said one of the other girls living with her is spray painting a bike pink in their front yard. \"I'm pretty sure it's stolen. And it's about to get stolen again. By me. It was a nice bike and she's giving it a new paint job! My house, my bike.\"\n\nHer husband has been giving her most of their work load yet he takes in most of the profit for it, in regards to her night job. She spent a good 45 minutes trying to figure out how to get revenge on him. Then he called and told her he bought a camper that he put in HER NAME and she got really excited and forgot all about the work issue.\n\nShe spent the last bit of the day laughing about how destructive her grandkids are and discussing her inability to buy them anything without it becoming trash immediately. Since they just go this new camper they have a pop up trailer for sale, and I suggested she turn it into a playhouse for the grandkids. \"They'll burn it down in a heartbeat.\" I laughed and said, \"surely you're exaggerating.\" No,\" she said. \"They'll really burn that shit completely down if they get the chance. Destructive little fuckers. I don't know where they get it from.\"\n\nShe sent me to the store to get her a Coke today because her Spark energy drink and her hydroxycut just weren't giving her enough energy. She didn't eat anything.",

        "text": "OK, here's the story. \n\nI go into a interview and I get offered the position and the hours are 9 to 6 Monday through Friday and I am a Lead Teacher. For those who do not know what a lead teacher is; I am responsible for everyone and everything in the classroom. Decisions are made by me and me only.  With that said. \n\nMonday,  first day- I go in fill out necessary paperwork, make small tslk, go over procedures and what not. I take a full tour of the building and I see the room that will be mine. I go back to the office and I get to how a teacher and a assistant teacher list their credentials from not following protocol with regards to a child, however,  the situation has been handled and it's all good. \n\nTuesday- in office again doing paperwork over heard director if the program talking about the incident that she told me yesterday.  A boy fell and hit his head, neither the teacher nor assistant teacher notified the parent nor the director at the time. Later on in the day the kid hits his head again yet no one is notified. Later on in the day that same boy begins to seize. Instead of clearing the area THEY FUCKING MOVE HIM  and bring him to the then director and the parent has finally been notified. The father got a lawyer who got a judge to issue a subpoena as to what happened that day. As a professional that is insanely scary to hear. The place is under a legal investigation and the two morons who caused all this are still employed their hence being a liability.  The director knowing that I heard clarified that I was hired to clean up the mess. \n\nWednesday- as if the crap from the day before wasn't enough to send me running..... I'm in the office again doing paperwork and I ask do I get a I-9 form. The director said that I would. Then she tells me that she can't hire me as full time and only part time, yet my hours are 9 to 6, 5 days a week. She said in order to be full time I must average 30 or more hours a week for 2 months before they can change my status. Here's the kicker;  part time does NO benefits. \n\nThursday- I take off and go on two interviews.  (Wish me luck). \n\nFriday- I ask when I will be able to get into my room. I get told once I'm credentialed. I asked how long that would take and I got told from a week to a few months..... I go into the classroom where I thought I was just learning the ropes and the lead teacher in there tells me that she went into my room to get more bibs the day before. When she opened the sliding door rat shit fell out. And there were blankets with bite marks in them. Then she said that someone has to clean that up!!!! The ship was sitting in a classroom a whole day with people knowing already. \n\nThe best is my classroom and this classroom are separated by a baby gate and we have infants on the floor.... \n\nNeedless to say that I quit the job. \n\nBut was I right to leave?\n\nEdit: I called the NYS Department of Labor and they said essentially an employer can lie to you and there's nothing that they can do about it. I got a little smoking gun in the fact that I was hired for full time hours, yet receive a letter from the parent company advising me to go get ObamaCare through the NYS Marketplace.  What bs.",

        "text": "First post here, discovered this sub today and read most of it already. Decided to share a little story that happened last week.\n\nSo, I work at a film school's sound department. We have special sound rooms to finish student short films and rent equipment for second year students that have been through the sound course, with permission from administration. That being said, we can't let people take anything without papers. When you take something out, you have to check it before leaving so both parties know that everything is working fine, and we can charge if anything's not working when it comes back. \n\nAfter sending off three people the same day because of the aforementioned permit policy, enters a girl saying she needs two lavalier mics and a recorder to record an interview with a big shot director. This is highly unusual. We can't let her have equipment without permission, though. She says she has talked to the headmaster, and he gave his ok. Now, the headmaster is not easily available, so it sounds a little fishy. My boss isn't there, he's teaching a class. I have strict orders to only give stuff to people with papers. I ask her to talk to the headmaster again and call our department so we can believe her. She leaves, and we get a call. The headmaster confirms that the director is downstairs waiting to be interviewed by the student. Cool. I just had to follow protocol. I fill in the forms and prepare the equipment. She doesn't check if it's working, she's in a hurry, takes everything and leaves. My supervisor makes a joke that she would be back ten minutes later asking if anyone could help her.\n\nTen minutes pass, she's back. She asks if anyone could help her with the mics. I'm not busy that day, and my supervisor lets me leave to help put the mics and come back. We get to the room they're recording the interview. The 90+year old big shot director is there. I know him by name but have never seen any of his movies. As I'm setting up the mics, he's talking about the time he met Federico Fellini, and Glauber Rocha, and almost worked with Orson Welles.\n\nI'm stoked. I imagine how many stories the guy has to say, and I have to listen to them. I see the girl is alone and would operate camera, sound and interview at the same time. She's hopeless. She has no idea. I suggest that I could stay and help monitor sound so that everything ends up ok. The interview lasts a little bit over an hour, we shake hands and I get back to my department with the equipment. My boss is a little pissed off, tells me I shouldn't even went to set up the mics. That was strike one. But it was fine. Later that day, I get an email from her asking if I could help her interview other big heads from the industry. Oh hell yeah I could.\n\nThere's no pay off to this story. Just a cool thing that happened.\n\nTL;DR: Hopeless girl comes to a sound department asking for mics to interview a film director. I get to help and listen to a man almost older than cinema itself talk about legends.",

        "text": "Hey guys and gals, [this is me](https://redd.it/46ubrs). Ok, did you read that? Cool, we're all caught up. Today is Monday morning and as usual, I was the first one into the office...weird since I also live the farthest but hey, that's always been my experience. \n\nAnyway, I was off on Sunday (if you read my previous post, I don't live in the US so working days are Sundays through Thursdays. Our weekends are Fridays and Saturdays...just...go with it) because it's Palm Sunday for us Greek Orthodox Christians and so I came into work this morning....at 8am...and found an email from my boss saying that I had to go to a workshop being held by one of our most important donors....at 9am. Gee, a whole hour to prep. I was home yesterday, I wasn't travelling in outer space. Executive Director Dick (E.D.D.) could have sent me a text, could have sent the actual email (which I would have seen on my phone), could have even....gasp....called me to let me know ahead of time, but that's not the worst of it.\n\nSo he actually forward'ed (is that an *actual* word?) the email from the donor this morning and added a nifty little message to me saying *\"Sorry for the short notice but I just found about about this. Are you aware of it? Did you talk to the project team yet?\"* \n\nExcept well, he hadn't just found out about it....because all I had to do was scroll down to the original email from the donor and see that they had sent it on APRIL f*cking 12th and his name is one of the recipients in the \"to\" section. It sat in his inbox for over a week until on a whim he decided to open it. Oh and today is the 25th, so he's also full of sh*t and probably just doesn't feel like going. But alas', he never actually checks his email so it's possible that it could have been sitting in limbo in his inbox waiting for someone to actually click on it. `Hard work, I know...what with all that time spent at his desk rummaging through the photo albums of random jail bait on Facebook all day, chain smoking like a champ and going back and forth to the kitchen every 10 minutes for a cup of coffee. What does he actually do around here again, nothing. \n\nBtw, this whole affair wouldn't have been so bad if I DID NOT HAVE A JOB INTERVIEW FOR A BETTER MORE PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATION AT 10AM....which I pretended was a \"meeting\" with some random potential stakeholder. Seriously, that was my cover. Who cares? He's not going to ask anyway. This is sort of an update to the previous post. I did manage to postpone my job interview until 2pm so that I could go to this stupid workshop this morning...and impress my (hopefully) new employers....and wholly crap did I f*cking nail that interview. Seriously, I didn't just kill it. I brutally murdered it in the most awesome way possible. So I expect to hear from them by Thursday and then I can give E.D.D. and his team of drama queens the ol' heave ho!",

I will be me, and we'll call her CL for crazy lady. \n\nI'm having a nice, peaceful afternoon when I see her shambling up the walkway and my heart sinks. I know that she is going to be difficult because we have had past encounters. To begin with, she opens the door and then sits down at a table not far from the front desk. I observe her opening a brown paper bag, which is filled with multiple ziploc bags filled with leaves. She begins taking the leaves out one by one, admiring them, and placing them back in their bags. \n\nI happily leave her to this, because at least she is not bothering me. I should have known not to let my guard down. She approaches the front desk and looks around for my co-worker, who has helped her as well in the past, and she is convinced that he is the answer to all of her questions. \n\nCL: *looks around* Where is my research assistant?\n\nMe: I'm sorry? (I honestly have no idea what she is talking about at this point.)\n\nCL: The boy who works here! HE always helps me. *leaning over the desk to look behind it* where is he at?\n\nMe: He's not here today. He'll be back tomorrow. Is there anything I can help you with?\n\nCL: Well I just don't know. I have SEVERE arthritis and I need something that will help me when I am in my car. But I'm sure you have no experience with that.\n\nMe: Actually my grandmother has arthritis and uses a lumbar support for her back while she drives in her car. I can look up where you can find those if you would like.\n\nCL: Where are they?\n\nMe: (I begin looking up the price of the item at the closest Wal-Mart to our library, and show her on the computer.)\n\nCL: Those are for your back. My arthritis is in my hip. I need something that is hard, like a block of wood, that I can place under my hip while I drive.\n\nMe: *frantically trying to think of anything I can search for that fits that criteria* (Finally I come up with what is essentially a seat cover that has built in lumbar support with a firm bottom to it that I felt like would support her hip while she drives) I triumphantly display this to her on the monitor, and the item is titled, \"Sacro-Ease Seat Back Cushion With Adjustable Lumbar Support\"\n\n\nCL: I said my hip hurts and this has the word \"back\" in the title! It is not my back that hurts it is my hip!! The word Sacro means back! But I wouldn't expect YOU to know that. \n\nMe: Ma'am nothing is going to specifically say \"hard hip support for driving car\" I am trying to search for things that would actually help your hip. Your back and hips are connected. \n\nCL: my back is not connected to my hips. Find me something that is only for my hips. Like a block of wood. \n\nMe: You want me to search for a block of wood that you would put in your car seat? \n\nCL: No no no, just something like that.\n\nMe: I'm not seeing anything that fits those parameters ma'am I'm sorry. Perhaps you could ask your doctor for recommendations?\n\nCL: What's your name? \n\nMe: (I give her my name)\n\nCL: *scribbling frantically in her notepad* How long have you worked here?\n\nMe: I've been here for a year. \n\nCL: That's why you are no help! I am going to the lumber yard. I'm sure they can build me a support that is for my hip and my leg! \n\nAnd she walked out the door and went back to wherever it is she came from in the first place. I'm sure I don't want to know. ",

        "text": "Yay throwaways!\n\nI figured there had to be a sub for this kind of thing and man, I wish I had found it earlier. \n\nSo I started working at this place about a year ago and let's say things have drastically changed from what they were, which has impacted everything, because the office is crazy tiny. We're talking patchwork family-size.\n\nThe staff who trained me promptly left after I was able to pick up most of the work in theory and I was thrown into some major responsibility by necessity. A temp staff was promptly hired to help me do the amount of work which was absolutely meant for AT LEAST two full-time staff.\n\nNow maybe we could've pulled this off somehow if the temp staff was quick on the uptake, but obviously that didn't happen. No, the LITERAL OPPOSITE OF THAT happened. The boss's friend's wife who hadn't been employed since the pleistocene needed some occupational therapy so that's what I got.\n\nWe deal with a slew of PDF and excel files everyday. A lot stuff is manual entry, so lots of room for mistakes and there's some technical understanding necessary (read, experience with how to handle certain inquiries). This woman needed help on how to update her Thunderbird, but \"she can do e-mail\" so I guess that was good enough.\n\nMy life since she has become part of the 'team' has consisted of trying not to kill her. I'm a shy person, who abhors violence, but I have violent fantasies of killing this person in multiple different ways. Since she started working here, I come home enraged many days a week. Now, incompetence is one thing, however in this case it comes with a KILLER combo of *incessant* and I mean *INCESSANT* talking and asking and disrupting my work flow. Again. Again. AND AGAIN.\n\nI cannot escape this. She just never shuts her stupid mouth. The reason I cannot escape it is that for every 10 inane questions or remarks she has, there's ONE question that is actually valid and important that I answer. And for every 10 inane work-related questions there's double that time in completely random, forced smalltalk chatter she tries, because she seems to be allergic to quiet work.\n\nI could go on forever. She's completely unable to prioritise. She'll ask me about stuff that doesn't fucking matter, when I know she has stuff on her desk that needs to be managed urgently. She comes to me to have me make decisions for her, because just taking some goddamn responsibility for whatever it is she does at a complete snail-pace would be asking too much.\n\nTo be fair, she tries and I guess she's not a bad person, but FUCK. That doesn't make me NOT want to rip out my ear drums when for the fifth time in five minutes I am assaulted by her Police-Academy-style high-pitched voice saying \"Can I just ask one question...\" and I'm just not allowed to say \"NO. NO YOU CANNOT. JUST STFU FOR ONCE AND DEAL WITH IT. THIS IS NOT ONE QUESTION AND WE BOTH KNOW IT.\", not only because she's the boss's friend's wife, but also because she doesn't even wait for an answer she'll just interrupt me anyhow, sidle up to my desk and blabber away. Usually by asking something, that she's asked at least five times in the past week, which I've answered in an increasingly short and hostile way only to be told \"Aw why are you so down all the time? Do you not get enough sleep?\". And I swear if she tries to hug me again, I WILL either have a panic attack or a complete rage-blackout. It's not a question of if, it's a question of when.\n\nThere's days where I feel like I just can't take it anymore. I'm thinking about quitting and changing jobs, because I just cannot come home every second day and feel like cutting the next bitch that looks at me funny on the bus or asks me something dumb and trivial. I already have a therapist for different issues, I really don't want to add this to the pile...\n\nSay what you will, advice, comments, whatever... I just needed a place to tell this (other than my poor SO, who has had to listen to me rant in frustration so many times now).",

We are contracted to spend 4 man hours \"servicing\" every 2 weeks.  Normally it's 2 men for 2 hours each.  Easy.  \n\n2 x 2hrs = 4\n\nI am currently expanding so have to fit more jobs in per day so we took somebody else on. So now there are 3 of us. So, 4 man hours ....\n\n3 x 1hrs 20 min = 4 hours.  Basic maths it would seem. But no, this guy worked out 1 hour 20 for 2 men and paid that amount as I was \"leaving early.\" So I have basically had a pay cut. But it's still too big a job to lose, just less profit. \n\nNot to mention, as we arrived a company was just leaving and he told me \"they aren't coming back, they have an offer on where the first call is free.\"  Now, there's nothing wrong with what he did, it just doesn't sit right with morals. It's also apparent this guy is all about exploiting the system...i suppose it would explain the mansion and garage this guy has. \n\nIt sounds trivial compared to some stories here but it's grinding my gears, I leave the job and spent 2 weeks thinking about going back.

We have a large number of special needs patrons that come in with their individual case workers to use the computers and read books, etc. \n\nWe also have a no cell phone policy, due to people trying to study, read, just find peace and quiet in this loud busy world. \n\nOn the day in question one of my favorite special needs patrons came in. We'll call her Alicia (not her real name.) She is absolutely hysterical, she always has a story to tell me and is always rather loud about it, but she's special needs so I'm not going to ask her to be quiet. Alicia is very particular about library rules and our schedules and always wants to know why my car is parked in a different spot if it is not where I usually park and why we haven't rolled the trash cans out to the curb yet, that sort of thing.\n\nSo on this day, her and her case worker were using our computers when another patron comes in the door. We'll call him big surly man. He asks to borrow a computer. I log him in and he immediately pulls out his phone and starts having a loud conversation with his friend about his weekend plans. \n\nI go over to him and whisper kindly that there is a no cell phone policy thinking that maybe he had missed the signs. Well he hadn't. He throws a fit about it and storms out to the vestibule to continue his conversation. Whatever, I'm used to it. Then he comes back inside and continues his computer use once he is done.\n\nAlicia watched this exchange and continued to stare this man down since she does not like to see patrons act unkindly towards the staff. Well, about that time his phone rang. He picked it up. I honestly really don't like having to tell patrons not to do something. I want everyone to enjoy the library and not feel like we are overbearing with our rules. This time I didn't have to tell him. \n\nAlicia immediately stands up from her computer and begins yelling very loudly to her case worker, \"MISS BOOKSANDPITBULLS ALREADY TOLD HIM TO GET OFF HIS CELL PHONE AND LOOK MRS CASE WORKER HE'S ON IT AGAIN! SHE TOLD HIM ALREADY! SHE SURE ENOUGH DID! UH HUH!\" and starts pointing her finger and waving it in his face. \n\nHis face turned so red. He immediately snapped his cell phone shut and walked out the door. We haven't seen him since. \n\nAll in all I think it went really well.  ",

        "text": "I am the office manager of a large (10,000+ graves) cemetery. It's the kind of cemetery that has full time grounds keepers and gardeners and [flat grave markers](http://www.obmemorials.com/portfolio/marcadores-sepulcrales-de-bronce/). The vases on these headstones are solid bronze and removable. They can also be inverted into the ground. We keep them inverted when there aren't any flowers in them. It helps protect them from our equipment, but also it keeps thieves from stealing them. About 10 years ago, we had some guy come to the cemetery and steal about 50 vases in the middle of the night. He tried to sell some of them to a scrapyard a few days later, but the scrapyard knew better than that, so he was arrested and we got 30 or so vases back. The remaining vases were never located and the families were responsible for replacing them.\n\n\nEvery spring, our staff does a huge clean up. We discard all the crappy looking silk flowers so the families can replace them with fresh flowers, and we clean and invert the empty vases at the same time. Even though we've done this around the same time of the year, every year, for the last 70 years, it still confuses people. We put ads in the newspaper, post on our facebook and website, and put signs up in the cemetery advertising our clean up dates. We don't allow little trinkets to be placed on the markers, so anything we pick up goes to a designated spot. We hold the trinkets for about a month and then dispose of them. The cemetery rules are given to each grave owner and family several times and they are posted around the cemetery, so these people know the rules. They just choose to ignore them most of the time. \n\nA lot of people don't realize that the vase inverts, so when they come visit a grave and don't see the vase, they immediately remember that ONE TIME the vases were stolen and start freaking out. Because of our recent clean up, I've been getting about 15-20 calls a day about \"stolen vases.\" I pretty much repeat this same speech about the vases and then all is well. Every once and a while, I'll get someone who doesn't believe me so I have to go to the grave and verify that the vase is, in fact, not stolen. \n\nRight before lunch, this older lady found one of my groundskeepers and started ranting about the vase on her husband's grave not being there. He went with her and verified that it wasn't there and said to go home and find her paperwork so we could order a replacement for her. Instead, she went home and collapsed out of grief in her front yard. A neighbor was outside and heard her wailing and moaning and thought she was dying and rushed over to help. This lady was so upset, she made the neighbor drive her back to the cemetery. On their way here, they called me and gave me the location of the grave. I gave them the usual speech and said it's extremely unlikely that the vase was stolen, especially because this grave was in the middle of thousands of other graves. It doesn't make sense that someone would walk around the entire cemetery and pick 1 vase to steal. The neighbor said she would come check it out, but said the lady was like seriously about to go to the hospital over it because she'd gotten herself so upset. I thought that was a little dramatic, but whatever, people do weird things when it comes to death.\n\n\nA little later, here they come into the office. This lady is making a freaking spectacle of herself. She is throwing herself on the floor, moaning and bawling and screaming. She was threatening to call the news, and the police and the governor and her lawyer. She said I probably took it just to spite her. I couldn't even get a word in to tell her that if it was stolen, we replace it for free most of the time. She was in my face and threatening to have me arrested. She was gasping for air and grabbing her chest. The whole nine yards. Then, she said her husband's name. I finally got a word in and said, \"Mrs. Crazylady, the local florist just picked up his vase. They said they needed to pick up Mr. Crazylady's vase because his wife had ordered a spring arrangement. It was like 45 minutes ago. Did he have another wife or someone else that would have ordered an arrangement for him?\" \n\n\nShe immediately cut off all the theatrics and went back to a completely normal human and said, \"Oh. That was me. I called them this morning, but I didn't think they'd get here that fast.\" And then she just turned around and walked out of the building. The neighbor and I just kind of made some faces to each other, he shrugged and left. \n\n**CASE CLOSED**",

She spent the day telling me (again) about being locked in a closet with her favorite cat and her son. I asked her how bad her damage was, and she said not much other than a few trees but that she got a friend to go up and tear a chunk of shingles off her roof so she can get a new one.\n\nShe went fishing Saturday with her husband, who is apparently nautically challenged. He got their boat stuck on a bank in the lake, and she got out to help free it. Well, so did he, and they freed the boat, but had to swim to it to get back in. Once they got in he decided to see how fast he could go.\n\nTotal count of items lost on the boat ride from hell:\n\n- 1 hat (\"my FAVORITE hat. He got it for me at Margaritaville when he was too drunk to stand.\")\n\n- 3 wine coolers (\"I was able to save the one between my legs but two flipped out and one busted in the boat.\")\n\n- 2 fishing poles (\"We fished one of 'em out using another pole but the second one is at the bottom of the lake somewhere.\")\n\n- Almost a bathing suit top (\"Every time he took a corner or hit a swell my boobs went flying up to my ears!\")\n\n- A bucket of minnows (\"It flipped over and those little boogers started flopping everywhere. I started grabbing 'em by the tail and tossin' 'em in.\")\n\nShe did, however, manage to hang on to her Cheez-it's and her other wine cooler (priorities, guys.)\n\nI sneezed and asked for a tissue and she tossed me a container of Clorox bleach wipes.\n\nI made pasta primavera last night and brought some in for her to try. It was a normal recipe, veggies and noodles with chicken, but she freaked out because she thought the chopped asparagus was green beans and when she bit it, she was surprised it was crunchy. \"I don't like asparagus, it makes your pee smell funny.\" She told me the one thing that would make my dish better was a heaping of ranch, cheddar cheese and some bacon. She doused it with ranch dressing and ate the rest. (For reference, the recipe had aged parmesan and organic chicken, squash, zucchini, mushrooms, asparagus, peas, carrots, tomatoes, garlic, and a ton of spices. I'm trying to be healthy, not make my pasta into a baked potato.)\n\nToday she had some ranch covered pasta primavera, a honey bun, and half my coca cola.\n\nI am glad she's okay after the tornado, though, and I hope she can handle things while I'm out of the office Thursday and Friday.",

        "text": "The Coworker Chronicles: What the Fuck? Wednesday\n\nToday's conversations with *** were lengthy and plentiful, so I handpicked the best for you fine folks. To start us out, she went on and on about how thin the walls are in her house and how the sound of her son having sex with his girlfriend kept her up all night, so she was grumpy.\n\n3 of her cats are now sick. She says she has to chase them around the house daily to administer their antibiotics. Two have escaped and are living under the house \"with the ferals\" (she has about 2 dozen feral cats that live beneath her home).\n\nShe had a bunch of mysterious bites on her arm (spoiler alert from a former medical professional: they're flea bites) and she was scratching all morning; she said she needed to go pee on them to for some relief. I gave her some tea tree oil and lavender. Fortunately she didn't have to pee on her arm after that. She asked to smell the rest of my oils so I gave her some peppermint oil and strict instructions to keep it away from her eyes. So naturally, 5 minutes later, she rubbed her eyes. She spent about an hour cursing and crying. I told her water would make it worse, but she tried to wash it out anyway. It made it worse. I gave her some milk (actually it was half and half but who's counting?) and helped her wash her eye out. It was quite an ordeal.\n\nOnce that ordeal was over, she was amazed that the oils actually took away the itching, and asked if she rubbed peppermint oil on her lady bits would provide an arousing sensation (IT WON'T DON'T EVER FUCKING TRY THIS OH MY GOD NO). I said \"remember what it did to your eyes? Okay imagine that in your vagina.\" She asked if any oils did work as aphrodisiacs, so I referred her to Google and moved on with my day.\n\nSomehow while googling oils she discovered a trailer for the movie Spring Breakers, and wanted to know who Riff Raff was, so after a youtube tutorial, she spent the day replaying his videos and laughing at him (between the beibs, Nikki Sixx, and Riff Raff, what can I say? she likes trashy white guys.)\n\nThe other cat tales I heard today included one about Rusty the congested cat eating his snot rockets (again. EW EW EW). The other story was that if one of her cats throws up she yells \"HOT MEAL!\" and waits for the other cats to come clean it up. By eating it, of course. (I just threw up in my mouth typing that. HOT MEAL, GUYS)\n\nShe has somehow acquired a small dog, I'm not sure when she got it but hey, now she has a dog. She said it has shit in her bed every day for the last week. I explained that if you take time to house train a dog, it won't shit in your bed, and she disagreed vehemently. \"I swear! He was trained when I got him he just lost it and wants to shit all over my bed now!\" When I said this could be a result of staying at home without being walked for 10-12 hours at a time, she said \"well, it doesn't bother the cats!\"\n\nShe's trying to keep her grandson from cursing (because he hears it a lot living in that environment) so she has started giving him \"replacement\" curse words. Instead of Goddammit he can now say Beaverdamit. Rather than shit he can say pushit (anybody else get a Salt N Pepa flashback just then?). For fuck he just says duck.\n\nShe's been arguing with her husband about their night business a lot lately so she blames herself for her grandson picking up these curse words and she's been praying nightly for forgiveness. She said when she was little, her mom told her God had a big poster with everyone's name on it and if you were bad you got a black star and if you were good you got a gold star. She went into this lengthy description of how she still thinks of that to this day, and she's worried she's got a black star now for the cursing. I assured her that her teaching the boy that it was wrong and trying to work on it was surely enough to turn the black star gold but she swears once the star is there, it can't change color. You just have to do more good stuff to get more gold stars.\n\nShe ate a honey bun today, and drank a Coca Cola with Spark in it.\n\nShe started to leave at 2:14 and got out at 3:38.\n\nThank you for reading the Coworker Chronicles.

        "text": "3.28.16 \n\nThe Coworker Chronicles: Monday, Monday, Can't Trust That Day\n\nToday when I got to work, Google Calendar was giving *** fits. She's convinced someone is moving all her scheduled appointments or that they're just disappearing.\n\nOne of her cats, Grace, has a uterine infection and she's very worried she won't make it. She left today to take her to a vet, but if it spreads to any of the other cats she's gonna end up with 36 dead cats at her house.\n\nOn Easter, her step daughter-in-law (I'm still not sure how this family tree branches) robbed a house with her father, and they're still on the run. \n\nShe went fishing this weekend, didn't catch anything, but had a good time. She spent about 30 minutes describing the fog on the lake and how they got lost in it. She thought she was going to die (on a pretty small lake in a very public area). Fishing is really helping her marriage, though.\n\nAnother of her cats has been acting depressed and has run away recently. She thinks he's going outside to die.\n\nI asked earlier if she found her gun, she said no, but went outside to smoke a cigarette and apparently found it in her car.\n\nShe told me again about the cat pissing on her clothes. I'm not sure if this is the same incident as Friday or if the cats are staging a revolution and peeing on her clothes every day.\n\nHer son's baby's mama is supposedly running an illegal daycare. *** has been Facebook stalking her, collecting photos to take to the cops. She's keeping 4 kids without a license and isn't reporting her income to the child support office, which is costing her son a lot of money in child support monthly, and she's trying to get that number dropped. She said her son never gets to see his son, but that the child is pretty ugly so she doesn't think it belongs to her kid anyway.\nShe went to the courthouse with our client's mother to file some papers. The client's ex wife is now stalking the client and his family, trying to get him arrested if he comes into town. He wasn't with *** the other day, though. The woman followed her instead. She documented all this and is now trying to file stalking charges against the woman on behalf of our client (who is banished from the county).\n\nShe asked me if I liked Justin Bieber today, then spent the afternoon playing his music videos.\n\nShe didn't eat today, other than a handful of chips from my desk.\n\n3.29.16\n\nThe Coworker Chronicles: Tuesday's Gone With The Cat\n\nI really don't have a whole lot of insanity to share today, she was pretty quiet because her cat is still sick. She said she has to get her fixed within 48 hours or she may die. (I don't have cats and cannot verify the accuracy of this statement. I didn't even stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night.)\n\nShe did have a lot to say about her husband today, though. She and Mr. Coworker own a cleaning business, and after hours they go to doctors' offices and clinics and clean up (hence the biofreeze from last week). It's her and her husband, and they've hired another girl to help them out. I hear stories daily about how her husband doesn't do much work and leaves it all to her, but this time he's apparently crossed a line. He left and went home, leaving the entire office for *** and the new girl to clean. She's pissed, and plotting his death, I think.\n\nHer phone isn't holding a charge. \"I took it to the lake and got it a little wet but that shouldn't kill the battery should it?\" I recommended she take it to the store and see if they could figure out what was wrong. \"They'll just disconnect everything and I'll end up having to buy a new phone that they've put a bug in.\"\n\nShe told me another story about one of her 48 cats but I'm not gonna lie, I zoned out and missed about 89% of it. Gist: She thinks the cat wants to be an outside cat now because he clawed a screen off a window to get out. ",

        "text": "3.23.16\n\nThe Coworker Chronicles: Why Did I Come To Work Wednesday\n\nI was out yesterday due to a pinched nerve and a lot of sedatives, but don't worry, *** made sure to [text me](http://i.imgur.com/nbRElMn.png?1) her daily drama.\n\nToday's conversations were just as entertaining. She has decided she can get an exemption on her taxes because she's \"American Indian\" (she's about as Indian as the Land 'o Lakes butter lady). \n\nWhen we were talking about my back injury, she mentioned she was in a minor accident when she was 16 that didn't show symptoms until she was in her late 30's, so this might really be pain from an accident I had when I was 16 (it's not).\n\nHer hand is still swollen though she is on antibiotics now. She's begun tracing the swelling just in case the doctor gave her something to make it worse instead of better, to get more money out of her.\n\nShe's inventorying everything in our office (holy cow I didn't know inventorying was actually a word) by taking photos of the labels and making an MS Publisher file. Remember, *** and I are literally the only two people in this office besides our boss, who paid for all this shit in the first place, and has all these numbers on file already.\n\nThen she got on Facebook. She showed me her son's girlfriend, who she says sells drugs and needles, she swears. She flipped through each picture of her going \"don't she look like a whore?\" \"Can you believe that skank?\" \"What trash.\" Then she stumbled upon a picture of her mother's car, a c28, that she intends to make hers (she loves muscle cars).\n\nFinally she went onto the client's page that she's so attached to. Yesterday she went to the courthouse on his behalf, because down here we still do things like banishment for certain crimes, and he is banished from the county his daughters are in. She pulled up photos of his daughters and cooed over them, then pulled up a picture of his ex wife and talked about what a heinous bitch she is.\n\nBefore she left, she told me if I need any painkillers for my back she will get me the hookup. She also offered to steal BioFreeze and deep tissue massage oil from the orthopedic office she cleans. I said no to the pills but that biofreeze shit is expensive. May take her up on that one.\n\n3.24.16\n\nThe Coworker Chronicles: Traffic Court Thursday\n\n*** had traffic court today for a speeding ticket. She decided last minute not to fight it, pled guilty, and came out better than she should have. This is good, because we were literally expecting a call from someone asking us to bail her out. She threatened to \"give someone a reason\" to give her a traffic ticket, presumably by mowing down the judge in the middle of town square. But she didn't! Good job!\n\nI bought her a celebratory lunch at J. Christopher’s today; she was very confused by their To-Go Menu (“Why does everything have eggs on it?” “Because it’s a breakfast place.”) Before I left to get it, she regaled me with a story of once getting a sandwich with so much white sauce she named it a “cum sandwich.” Great way to whet the appetite.\n\nShe did, indeed, steal me some biofreeze, but it's not in the [container](http://imgur.com/a/V7VZV) I expected. (The pill bottle has massage oil inside.) \n\nToday, she watched videos on youtube with groups of rednecks fighting and lamented the fact that they \"looked like some of her people.\"\n\nShe did, however, help a client out of a bind today. For all her faults, she knows our state's divorce and custody laws like the back of her hand. The attorney is out, she got the client hooked up with the information needed and sent him on his way, without having to think twice about what he needed. It was actually kind of impressive and melted my cold, dead heart just a little.\n\nThere may be more to add, I've got two hours of *** left, but I'll most likely add it on tomorrow, because I don't want to make her more paranoid than she already is.\n\n3.25.16\n\nThe Coworker Chronicles: Go the Fuck Home Friday\n\nToday, upon my arrival, the coworker asked if she reeked of cat piss. I reassured her that no, she didn't, but she went on to explain that her cats had pissed all over a pile of clean laundry, as well as the boots she was wearing today. She already washed them once in the work sink but wanted to make sure another round wasn't necessary.\nWe listened to a lot of country music in the office today, and she watched a lot of car videos. She was disappointed when they didn't wreck. Aren't we all?\n\nShe was complaining about getting calls from the Red Cross too often, and said she's not going to donate blood anymore because their telemarketers won't stop harassing her.\n\nI got another Cat Tale from her this morning: Rusty, one of her 43 cats, has sinus issues and sneezes a lot. Well, this morning he was sitting on her table and he sneezed a huge snot wad into her coffee then tried to eat it.\n\nExtra special quote of the day: \"My underwear has done slid down my butt crack again.\"\n\nWe ordered a pizza today. She was very happy about the chocolate lava cake I surprised her with. So happy, in fact, that she ate mine as well as hers. (“Oh, I thought both of these were for me…”)\n\nShe went on a crazy cleaning spree before she left. She began leaving at 1:54 PM, but got distracted 3 separate times and didn't make it out until 2:17 PM.",

        "text": "Hi everyone! First time posting here - found this subreddit by way of /r/TalesFromRetail.\n\nI'm a recruiter for an international big-box retailer and work in our Canadian Headquarters. Since today is Easter Monday, a lot of people either took today off or booked off a full week of vacation to extend their long weekend (smart way to maximise vacation use). Ironically enough, I was on TFR and looked back to me computer to send an email to a hiring manager. Candidate is from one of our stores and is interested in a corporate position - my job is to connect the two client groups and develop our internal talent.\n\nAnyways, this email was to forward the store candidate's resume to the hiring manager for review. Outlook nicely tells you when a contact has an Out of Office message set so you can adjust your expectations of a semi-prompt response. This particular hiring manager has the following OOO message currently set:\n\n\"I am away from the office Thursday March 24th - Friday April 1st and will not have access to my email. I will be back in the office Monday, December 14th and will respond to your message then.\"\n\nBlack Friday/Christmas season/Boxing Day is naturally our busiest time - guess she needs a few months to prepare for the chaos? I'd love that much vacation time.",

        "text": "3.17.16\n\nThe Coworker Chronicles: Hey, Don't Eat That\n\nToday *** was drinking her Spark energy supplement when she mentioned she sometimes likes to sprinkle a little on whipped cream and eat it for dessert. I told her that was probably not healthy, she giggled and said she'd die happy cause it was delicious. (Look up the ingredients. It's not delicious.) \n\nHer knee is bothering her today. She checked the weather and it's supposed to be raining tomorrow so she warned me she will most likely call in because if it's raining she wants to stay in bed. Her grass is still not cut, and she's running out of cat litter for her 27 cats.\n\nShe told me she had to pee 8 times today, and is pretty much in a constant state of hot flash as of late, so my office is about 45 degrees right now. \n\nAs far as St. Patrick's day...she wasn't wearing green but had on green mardi gras beads that looked...well worn. She told me 3 times she was wearing green underwear (twice upon coming back from the bathroom, I guess she forgot?)\n\nShe spent today scouring Google Maps, finding out if there were satellite cameras in her trees (not a thing) and wondering how they got the street view (if you think I'm about to show her that car and have her hunt it down and drive it off the road you're crazier than she is).\n\nI learned today that she has a \"pet cemetery\" in her yard. Not sure what to do with this info yet.\n\n3.18.16\n\nThe Coworker Chronicles: A Visual Tour\n\n*** is out of the office today. [Here is a visual tour of her workspace.](http://imgur.com/a/WF6iv)\n\n3.21.16\n\nThe Coworker Chronicles: Just Another Manic Depressive Monday\n\n*** wasn't in the office for very long today. As a matter of fact, I got called in early because she got attacked by one of her 32 cats. I received [this text](http://i.imgur.com/uhYx2YU.jpg) this morning. \n\nShe said when she goes to the hospital she's going to see if they'll give her a prescription for anxiety (that she doesn't really need) so she can pass it along to the client mentioned previously. When I mentioned the illegality of that, she said \"hell, if people in [the town where she lives] bought pills legally every time, half the trailer parks here wouldn't have renters because they wouldn't be able to afford it.\"\n\nToday for breakfast *** had a honey bun with Spark energy supplement sprinkled on top. For lunch, she had a handful of Lortab.\n\n",

        "text": "3.14.16\n\nToday, *** was very upset about her son. Her husband gave him $300 Friday to give to her, and she hasn't received it yet, she is certain he has stolen it and is smoking it away. \n\nMeanwhile, at work, she has taken a personal interest in one of our clients to the point she's given him her cell phone number and has bonded him out of jail using her house as collateral. Yes, the guy's ex wife is batshit insane and keeps having him arrested on trumped up charges, but again, he is a client that she met through this law office. She's currently researching the law to see how she can get the guy's ex wife arrested. She has somehow gone to the courthouse and passed her personal phone number along to the ADA, and is now sending emails to me and the lawyer regarding the case and how we can help (we have 93 clients. This guy is one, but he hasn't paid us in 6 months. She has been covering his tab.) \n\nToday, she ate a honeybun for breakfast and had a cigarette for lunch. She's currently reading the Official Annotated Law Code for the state.\n\n3.15.16\n\n*** has become so enthralled with the case of the client mentioned yesterday, she took it upon herself to schedule a telephone conference with the ADA (this is NOT something part time legal secretaries do). She confessed to me that she's got a side account and is saving up money in an effort to make sure he has enough money to skip the country \"if shit gets bad\". \n\nShe got an animatronic dog yesterday (think Teddy Ruxpin as a dog who runs off bluetooth) and today she played praise and worship songs through it all day. She bought an extra one of these for the daughter of the client mentioned above. \n\nI offered her a chicken salad croissant today. She said yes until she realized there were no pickles in the chicken salad, and that it had grapes. \"I only like grapes in liquid form. Heh heh.\"\n\n3.16.16\n\nToday, I arrived on time, to hear *** yelling \"dangit!\" at her monitor. I sat down and offered her a strawberry, but she said her teeth were hurting (she has a lot of dental issues) and she was trying to only drink Spark energy supplement (look it up, it's terrible) and not actually eat. \n\nShe said her husband wants to go fishing this weekend, and she knows she should go with him because his birthday is some time this weekend but she can't remember which day (they've been married for 10 years). She also said she needs to stay home and mow the lawn because nobody else is going to do it and they lost a kid's toy somewhere in the tall grass last week so she knows it's time to cut it.\n\n\n*** also lost her gun. She said she hopes it's hiding under the massive pile of clothes in her closet but if it's not in her closet or her husband's closet or her bathroom cabinet or her dresser then her son stole it, and that's the last straw, she's kicking him out and pressing charges.\n\nShe said our client that she's so involved with (who she spent the day researching for) just needs to take a baseball bat to his ex wife's head, and that she would be happy to do it for him.\n\nFinally, she asked what would increase her libido because she would rather vomit spaghetti than have sex with her husband (all said while I was eating lunch). She then started researching various herbal remedies to put her in the mood, giving me a graphic description of how quickly her vagina dries up at the thought of sex with him.\n",

This is after the Vice President's 25 minute explanation of why their company does not do citizens arrests and the base of all we need to be... are good witnesses.   \n\nWhile the VP moved topics and discussed 401k, benefits, breaks and etc.   Another guy interrupts him halfway with a story about how his neighbor would get into fights and call the police and he asked the vice president if he can make a citizens arrest in that case.  After which story teller gets cut off by an older middle aged woman who mentioned she thinks she knows the answer but pulls out her phone and begins quoting state laws about speed zones.  \"Colonel Militia\" man cuts her off and they start a heated argument, I was tuned out but phrases of \"Obama needs to be impeached today\". . . \" I'm not sure who I'm voting for yet\". . . \" I still think we have the right to use pepper spray and take people to the ground\". . . \"I baby sat a dog\".  \n\nEnd of the meeting, the VP asked if there were any more questions, everyone said no.  Then as he's giving his closing remarks 12 hands go up with very irrelevant and ignorant questions. \n\n\n\nThis whole meeting could have been done and over with in 20 minutes.  \n\nI was amazed several of these people were never asked to leave.\n\nNeedless to say myself and one other were the only one's given tax paperwork to fill out at the end of the night.\n\n",

        "text": "I had to make a large (50L) solution of 0.1% Trifluoroacetic acid. Really nasty stuff.\n\nThe way to make this (and ANY acid solution) is to fill up the container with water, usually about 10-25% of the total volume of the solution. The acid is then added to the water, and the solution is mixed thoroughly before being diluted to the final volume.\n\nThe reason for adding the water first is to prevent the acid concentration from being too high. When mixing water with acid, the solution will generally heat up and give off fumes, so adding a small amount of acid to a larger amount of water minimizes the effect of the heat and fumes.\n\nAs I was filling the 100L container with the preliminary water, my supervisor walked by.\n\nS: \"So you added the acid already?\"\n\nMe: \"No. I'm just filling it up a bit before I do.\"\n\nS: \"What?! Why are you doing that?! You're just wasting time!\"\n\nMe: \"… What do you mean?\"\n\nS: \"You always have to add the acid to the container first! That way, when you fill it up, the solution mixes! It saves time since we don't have a stirring system for the 100L containers.\"\n\nShe stops the water flow, and then takes me to fill up a 50mL tube with the concentrated acid. She fills it up, doesn't cover it, and runs back to the container, pours it directly in, STICKS HER HEAD IN THE TOP OF THE CONTAINER, and swishes it around before turning the water back on.\n\nShe chastises me for not thinking how to save time and energy, and stops me from telling her it's flat out dangerous, then goes on her way.\n\nThis woman is in charge of an entire science department, but lacks any scientific training or background.\n\nI'd complain about her disregard for safety, but given the company's lack of interest in safety in general, I'd probably be told to shut up.",

        "text": "Today's tale just happened, and it about the most unreliable company I have had the *ahem* pleasure of working with.\n\nA short preface: I work for a real estate agency, 99% of our clients are foreigners buying a place in the sun, exclusively newly built or still under construction. All communication between client and constructor goes through me (at least, it is supposed to).  \nYou want to make changes to the house? Contact me, and I inform the builder to make up a quote.\n\nOn to the story:  \nThis particular construction group, lets call them ShittyBuilder ($SB), do not answer emails or are \"out of the office\" when you call.  \nIt has gotten to the point that my manager ($M) has gotten involved with several cases, as well as our general manager ($Boss).\n\nAside from not answering questions, giving wrong prices for additional works, wrong dates for completion of build, etc, $SB is unable to get a bank guarantee from their bank. This is not entirely uncommon, so we weren't too worried, builders can also get a financial guarantee through an insurance company.  \nIn June 2015, we requested the first bank guarantees, and were met with silence. We keep emailing and calling, by September they finally tell us that they should have them by November.\n\nNovember comes around, of course they have nothing. They inform us the bank will not give a guarantee, but they have a financial insurance company coming to give them financial guarantees.  \nWe check again a few weeks later, they still have nothing. By now they have started building, two months behind schedule, and we can clearly see they will not receive any kind of guarantee. We inform our clients to hold payments until they have a guarantee, or until their houses are completely built.\n\nOne of my more vocal clients apparently went this weekend for a meeting with $SB without informing us (no problem, we don't work weekends anyway).  \nAside from price differences between what they initially signed and the current price given for some tiles and modifications around the house, $SB gave them the \"bank guarantee\" with a signed date of 2015/11/30 (November 30th), telling them that they had informed $Boss and our Legal department.  \nThat paper is merely an affirmation that $SB has a bank account with $Bank, signed by the manager of that office.\n\nWe have gone out of the \"incompetent\" region, all the way to \"lying to get money from clients\".  \n$Manager is out, so is $Boss. Tomorrow is going to be one hell of a day.",

        "text": "I'm a PR/Communications expert that was hired to stabilize a struggling NGO in the MENA region. They basically hired me to come to the Middle East and pull them out of a financial crisis caused by reduced funding. Within 2 years, I managed to raise $6.8 million dollars in funding through various projects that I designed and that were greenlit by foreign donors, among some other spiffy little accomplishments. I'm basically the organization's Swiss Army Knife...since I have very many roles (most of them unofficially).\n\n**The Executive Director:**\nHowever, despite my best efforts, this organization is ultimately fucked....because the Executive Director is an uninterested idiot who doesn't care about his job as much as he does playing around on Facebook and chain-smoking like a champ (I keep the windows open...even in dead of winter b/c otherwise this place would reek like a giant ashtray). He only cares about money, the organization's money, and is too fucking cheap to approve of simple expenses that could really help out. Like buying real office chairs for all the staff (I went through 3 that broke and now I'm sitting at my desk on a metal folding chair). We had a meeting once and he told all of us, \"I'm not complaining about *my* chair. You shouldn't complain about *your's* either. If you're not comfortable, we'll get you a new chair but it'll come out of your paycheck and when you leave your job, you can take it home with you!\" (He has a big comfy leather reclining office chair). My job also entails working with the Finance Officer to make a budget for the projects and as soon as we're satisfied that we've made an appropriate budget within the donor's guidelines, he comes in like a bull in a china shop and demands to change everything to his liking, \"You have some good ideas but I'm the Executive Director and at the end of the day, what I say happens.\" Then a couple months later, we receive a letter from the donor saying that our proposals unfortunately was not approved...and guess whose fault it is? Mine! After all, I wrote the proposal! \n\n**The Staff:**\nAs for the staff, they are all locals and 99% of them can't complete a sentence in English, despite the fact that the biggest donors of this office are from the EU and the UN and all of their communications are in English.....\n\nWhich leads me to my biggest problem. Because I'm a native English speaker, I have become (against my better judgement) the organization's English/Arabic translator. When I'm required to write quarter or year end reports for our donors...you know, so they know where their money is going....I ask for data in the form of internal reports from the actual staff that do the project activities. They ALWAYS send me these reports in Arabic, which I end up wasting weeks on end translating into English. Also none of the staff members know how to use Microsoft Office.....in 2016....so they always call me to teach them how to do stupid things like...change the document size in Word, or create a column in Excel, or add a contact to Outlook. And God forbid the internet goes down or their computers aren't picking up a wifi signal, I'm also the de facto IT specialist. \n\nThe other day, one of our staff called me down to her office because she had a problem with the internet. It wasn't working and she couldn't log into the organization's website to update the news section. So, I dropped everything I was doing and went to see what the problem was. It turned out that WiFi button on her laptop was turned off. Another time, another staff member called me to his office and asked me to write a response...in English....to an email invitation asking him to attend a conference in Geneva, Switzerland. Only the invitation was in English, the conference most certainly will be in English...and he is asking me to write a reply to the email in English because he can't speak English! What's he going to do when he gets to Geneva and has to make a presentation on the work of the organization....in English?? BTW, I can guaran-damn-tee you that I'll be asked to create his presentation for him because I KNOW that he doesn't know how to use Powepoint....and...yeah, the presentation needs to be in English. I also love when they rely on Google Translate to create their own English-language reports, and when they send me the draft, I can't understand what the hell it says! So not only do I need to translate from Arabic to English, but I also need to decipher what that crap they cut and paste into the document in really bad English is *supposed* to say. \n\nThe staff are also very unprofessional and dramatic as hell. They can't take criticism without resorting into a bunch of immature babies. On any given day, someone will get into an argument with another and you can hear them yelling and cursing at each other down the corridor. It's embarrassing. One time we had a representative for the United Nations waiting for a meeting with the Director, while he was yelling at the top of his lungs at the secretary for fucking up the printing order on some of his papers. I swear, that sometimes I feel like I work in a Daycare center. If one person get's a raise, the entire staff get jealous, pissy and hostile. They all feel like they're the best employee, they all feel like they're better than everyone else but...I'm the eyes and ears around here and I know that they're all full of shit. I know what they're doing when the  boss isn't around and I know what websites they're visiting when they should be working (like I said, I'm the de facto IT guy).\n\n**Edit:**  *for those not familiar with the lingo, an \"NGO\" is a non-governmental organization (aka: a non-profit) like...Amnesty International, or PETA or The Red Cross.* ",

Production people - especially those that showed up after he left - weren't really in his field of vision.)\n\nKeeping our CEO's request in mind, most mornings I walk into the Rock Factory thinking about anything but the customer. On the chance that I accidentally do, my mind usually wanders to wishing that I'd offered \"safety\" as my opinion of what's most important. I could only imagine the CEO backpedaling after saying that the customer was more important than our safety.\n\nAs I walked deeper into the factory towards the time clock, I hear someone come enter the factory behind me... stomp. stomp. stomp. It had been a cold day, and at first I thought their stomping was just because they were trying to clean the snow off their shoes. As the stomping continued, I started wondering about it... it was cold, but there hadn't actually been snow on the ground. And they were still stomping. As I neared the office, a giant window was directly in my path. I tried to look at the reflection to see who was behind me. I wasn't sure, but I thought I recognized it as a guy with an anger management problem. Apparently, one time he \"went silverback gorilla\" at the factory. I don't know what that entailed, but I heard it was just in response to someone playing music too loud.\n\nI kept progressing toward the locker room, and the stomping followed. In fact, it was intensifying; they were gaining on me. STOMP. STOMP. STOMP. I kept thinking about it... Mr. Silverback didn't come into work for probably two hours after the current time. It had to be someone from my high-speed work area... which probably meant it was someone messing with me. I tried to keep going without giving him the satisfaction of me laughing, but eventually I couldn't, and just stopped and doubled over laughing. It was just too good. He'd gone for almost 100 yards, stomping as loud as he could.\n\nI turned around and saw it had been Redwood, the high speed area lead. We laughed about it for a bit before we went into the break room. He turned toward the locker room while I went for the vending machines. After I had a drink and clocked in, I went to go change, following Onions into the locker room. When he saw me, he held his fingers up, cocked his head back, and said \"Sup xuol\" in a unintentionally but severely douchey way. Redwood was coming out of the locker room as we headed in, and he rolled his eyes at Onions as I smiled and nodded. \n\nAs we started changing, of course Onions decides to have a conversation. \"Hey man,\" he says, \"what are you doing for the holiday?\" \n\n\"Hell, probably sleeping,\" I say, since I usually go to bed unfashionably early.\n\n\"Well, I'm going to a party, you wanna come?\" \n\n\"Hell, probably not. What's going on?\"\n\n\"Well, my buddy Bob inherited this house, and he made it a party house. It's AWESOME, it's just this huge, empty house. I mean, it smells like dog shit, but... [that's okay, because] PARTY HOUSE! Last time he had a kiddie pool full of Natty Ice, and people would stand on opposite sides and try to knock each other in with this one guy's crutches. Then the winner of the championship got to fight Bob, who was drunk, and he ended up just getting naked in the pool of Natty Ice. The Natty Ice wasn't in cans or anything. Just liquid. Wanna come?\"\n\n\"Hell, probably not.\" By this time, I'd changed clothes, and could flee Onions. The only other person on the way to the factory floor that I pass is Vinnie, this little Laotian dude who always throws his arms up and yells my name whenever he sees me in the morning. Today is no exception; we usually don't have anything to talk about aside from the meta of working at the Rock Factory, and aside from his excited greeting, we really don't interact. But he always greets me so enthusiastically... it never fail to put me in a good mood.\n\nIf there's one thing that's true of the Rock Factory, it's that the people keep it interesting.",

        "text": "The title says it all. It couldn't have happened in any worse of a way. I feel terrible because of how it happened and I guess I just need to vent a bit. So work with me a for a little while, and be my Oprah for a moment Reddit.\n\nI'm a fucking great guy and simply put, I love my job as a software developer. I strive to do the best at my job that I possibly can. I am constantly educating myself on better ways to do my job. But the best thing about my job is that I don't have to interact with people all that much. Not that I don't enjoy company and good conversation, nor do I have a problem talking to my boss about requirements and upcoming projects; but I have a problem when the conversation or subject matter is specifically about me. So you can understand that when I had the task of quitting my job set upon me...I freaked out a little bit.\n\nTo set up the story: I am/was a contracted developer to a startup company. To get from my parent employer to the company I was working for, I have to go through 2 different consulting companies. This means, that for the time I've been here, I've had to file a time sheet to 4 different companies every week. Needless to say, I'm not a big fan of micromanagement, and being under the gun of multiple companies at once is a pain; so a few weeks ago, I got an offer from the company I've been working at to quit my current employer, and work directly for them. I was ecstatic. Not only would I be getting less attention from people and still do what I love, but the money they are offering is fantastic. \n\nThere was a slight problem however: my contract. It states very clearly that I wouldn't be able to be hired by customers of my company and that upon termination of my employment, would owe a pretty hefty sum to my parent company. This meant that at some point in what was to come, I would have to stand my ground and defend my actions against blatantly stated rules/conditions; I was fucking nervous.\n\nSo I started the string of phone calls to all those companies that I have been reporting to for months. First phone call happened without a hitch. I think that it happened that way due to the fact that it was the first one in line and I was so relaxed and ready for it. No bridges burned, and everything was golden. \n\nThen came the second phone call. Now, everything went just fine, until I made the DIRE mistake of saying something along the lines of \"I never said I was going to work for 'Insert Company Name Here'\". Big fucking mistake. The person on the line (who will remain nameless, as well as all companies involved) automatically assumed \"Oh, your not working for them?\" and the conversation went on without incident. Now did I realize that they made the assumption? Maybe. Did I correct it? Hell no. I was nervous, and once you fuck up mid-conversation, you can't just halt that train mid-trip. That's how derailments happen, people die.\n\nAnd then finally the third phone call happened. I was more nervous than ever. I knew I just fucked up the last one, how can I fuck up this one too? I'm pretty sure I was sweating. So the CEO of my parent company answers the phone and I state that I was formally submitting my resignation to move to another company. \"Great, what company are you going to?\" they asked...Immediately I panicked. \"I can't tell them I'm going to work for a customer, that's against the contract\", \"I cant say 'I'd rather not say' cause I have no balls\", \"Fucking say something!\" All these thoughts happened in a matter of milliseconds in my social anxiety cursed mind. \"I'm going to work for 'Insert company here who I am in fact NOT going to work for'\"....and thus, fuck up number 2 happened. And the conversation went on without a hitch while I stayed very very quiet as I knew what I had done. Following the phone call, I submitted my resignation letter and then went immediately home for the weekend and laid in bed for 2 days straight and felt terrible.\n\nIt is now the following Wednesday. Needless to say, information went up and then back down the food chain and got back to me. I knew what I had done. I was nervous. I've never quit a job. I'm not a liar, its not in my nature, but when the conversation is about me, myself, and I...well I don't know, I freak out. Today I got a text from the second person I had called. It said that they were very disappointed in my actions and that I was being released from their employment and to have a good life as they want nothing more to do with me. I let the company thats hiring me know the situation and the truth of what I had done, and they didn't seem to mind as long as I learned for future encounters like this. Even if I'm still going to the company that wanted to hire me in the first place, I still feel terrible about all this. Thanks for reading Reddit.",

        "author": "ISometimesCrit",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/42tnda/stories_from_hospital_security/",
        "text": "So, I've been doing Security for about ten years now, and am now the Manager of a Security Department for a small hospital in a major city. I've been reading work tales here and there, and figured I'd share some. Obviously names and locations will be changed to protect patient privacy.\n\n**Ike:** I was working at my first hospital with this company, and had stayed at the hospital through Hurricane Ike to properly secure the facility. Mostly, this consisted of us evacuating as many of our patients as we could, and riding out the storm in relative comfort. We had massive generators, plenty of food stocked up, and comfy beds, so it was a relatively easy way to earn Disaster Pay and all the overtime I could handle. \n\nFirst day after the storm, the entire city is flooded, we don't do much at all. No visitors, only a handful of patients. \n\nSecond day, the waters start to recede, still not doing much. A few patients come in by ambulance, but we're still turning away visitors and outpatient appointments.\n\nThird day the people in the city find out that we have not only air conditioning (due to the previously mentioned generators), but also dry floors and power to charge their cell phones...\n\nAll hell breaks loose. We quickly have 1500 people outside our doors, demanding to be let in. The city Police stationed a bunch of officers outside, along with our Security, and some armed contractors we'd hired for the emergency, and for the most part, the crowd just mills about. \n\nThere was this one guy, though, that I'll never forget. \n\nHis underage girlfriend had come into our Emergency Department, in labor, and not having an easy time of it. We had her covered, no worries, but we weren't allowing ED visitation, since we were inundated with patients. \n\nSo this guy comes in, demands to see her, and when he's denied, he starts threatening my ED nurses. He's gonna find their homes, he's gonna come back to the ED with his boys, you get the drift. \n\nWhen my partner (a tiny 35 year old housewife) and I (an average sized, if a little big, 25 year old guy) approach him, he demands we let him see her. We explain the situation calmly, and then he tells us he needs to go back to give her his phone number. \n\n\"Your girlfriend is having your kid, and she doesn't have your number?\"\n\n\"Nah. I keep my bitches separate.\"\n\nWe offer to take the number to her, and ensure that she has it, but explain that we can't force her to keep him updated, and as he's already threatened people, we are certainly not going to let him back in the building.\n\nHe says the following:\n\n\"Man...muh fuckin' bitch ass nigga white people runnin' this muh fucka'.\" \n\nAnd he storms off. To this day, it's the most creative set of words I've ever been called. \n\n**The King:** About three years ago I was working as a Security Officer in a large hospital in our division, and I'd been there for a few years. One of our duties was to sit with disruptive patients for safety reasons, whether it be for the patient's safety or for that of the staff.\n\nSo, I'm working day shift, and get a call to go to the building across the street from the main hospital, which is a part of our six building property, to sit with a violent patient, who we'll call \"The King\". \n\nHe's got a patient sitter, a buddy of mine, who stays with him 24 hours a day because he requires that much attention. This patient is mentally deficient in some way (not sure why). He's got the mentality of a toddler, is non-compliant, and is almost completely non-verbal. Yes, no, phone, go...that's about the extent of his vocabulary. Mostly it's just gestures and grunting.\n\nBlah blah blah, problems with his home situation, but no medical problems to speak of, so we can't transfer him to another facility. We've gotta take care of him until Adult Protective Services and the courts can work out where he's gonna go. \n\nSo me and my buddy, who we'll call \"Batman\", are hanging out in this dude's room, which is right off of the Nurse's station. The nursing staff have had it up to here with this guy, because he's smart enough to demand things, but not smart enough to understand why we can't comply with his demands. He demands to leave by gesturing at the door, and when told that he can't leave, he screeches and throws things. \n\nHe's also built like he was carved out of rock. Seriously. Dude didn't skip leg day or any other day. Strong as an ox, this guy.\n\nSo we're well into day two with The King. We've explained over and over and over that he can't leave, because the doctor says so, since that's the only explanation he'll semi-accept. He's had breakfast, and he is sitting in his bed, eating powdered creamer packets like they're ambrosia. No coffee, no liquid, just creamer powder. \n\nBatman and I are talking about gaming, and The King gets up out of bed and slowly approaches, listening. Wary, since we'd had to go hands on to keep him restrained before, we pause the conversation. He looks at us, a sly look on his face, and I take a step back to make sure I'm out of his reach. \n\nHe grins, and launches a gob of half moistened creamer at me, spattering my all black uniform with foul smelling milky liquid. Then he utters the only multi-syllabic word I heard him say during his entire stay.\n\n*\"Nigger!\"*\n\nHe grins even wider, and shrieks with delight, clapping his hands, as Batman quickly escorts him back to his bed. He starts singing the word, over and over. \n\nMost patients that I have to deal with either have some sort of psych problem, or have something in their system that doesn't allow them to control their behavior, be it drugs, or alcohol, etc. I can deal with that all day. No problem. \n\nNot this. This guy knew. He knew exactly what he was saying, or at least, the response it was designed to provoke. He did it specifically to get a rise out of me. \n\nIt was one of the very few times I had to walk away to keep from losing my cool with a patient. \n\n**First Night:** So, my first night at the previously mentioned large hospital, I was training with another officer when we got a call for Security assistance in the Emergency Department. We went running down the hall, and could hear the screaming from the moment we entered the department. It was like a banshee was being held captive. We found the off duty PD Officer that works in the ED standing outside the door, and he nodded me in. I pushed the doors open, and found the source of the screaming. \n\nA skinny girl, in her early twenties, was arched up on her shoulders and heels, bending her spine in a way spines shouldn't bend, being restrained by several nurses and techs and shrieking about people wanting to touch her inappropriately.\n\nNot complaining about it, mind you. Demanding. Demanding that someone...assist her. \n\nI should probably mention that she was completely naked, hence the closed doors. \n\nMy partner and I closed the doors again, catching the PD Officer chuckling at having let us just walk right into that with no warning. We grabbed gloves, donned them, and approached the bed. We replaced the nurses holding her arms, and our uniforms apparently caught her eye. \n\nShe fixated on us, and started demanding that we assist her in achieving fruition, shall we say, with our batons. Which we didn't carry. She screamed at us, demanding we comply. She managed to kick free of the nurse holding her ankles, and rolled her feet up towards her head, forcing her pelvis over her head, closer to us, as we stood at the head of the bed. \n\nWe managed to put her in soft restraints, cover her with a sheet, since she clearly wasn't going willingly into a gown, and the nurses gave medication to help her calm down. She eventually went to sleep, though she kept humping the air, the blanket, and the bed rail whenever she could. \n\nWe never did find out what was causing the behavior, but it made for an interesting first night...\n\n**Shopping for a husband:** So, about a year after I started at this large hospital, I got a call to assist with an unruly patient. Most of the time, if I can, I'm going to try and de-escalate the situation. I might be able to take a patient in a fight, but I might not, and I'd rather not find out, so I try really hard to talk people out of fighting. \n\nThis patient was a woman in her forties, with her husband and teenage daughter in the room. She was fussing about something that I don't even remember, but wasn't violent or aggressive. Just fussy. She refused to listen to the nurses, the techs, the doctor, so they called me. \n\nCool. Sometimes a person with a badge, even if it's just a Security Officer badge, can calm things down just by showing up. \n\nSure enough, that's what happened. Her whole demeanor changed. She was polite, calm, and chatty. We talked for a bit, and I came to understand that she was having problems with perception. She thought she was backstage at the Rodeo concert, and her husband told me they were in the nosebleeds. She was best friends with a celebrity, and I was informed that she'd met the person once. \n\nShe turned to her daughter, who was probably 14 or 15, and said *\"Sweetie, this is the kind of man you need. Good job, very nice manners...why don't you date him?\"*\n\nThe daughter was absolutely mortified. \n\nI thanked her for the compliments. \n\n**\"Well, I appreciate that, you're very kind. My wife would probably have a problem with me shopping for her replacement while I was at work, though. Also, it's kind of frowned upon when a 28 year old man takes a girlfriend that young.\"**\n\nShe \"Pshaw\"ed me, and suggested that age was just a number. \n\n**\"Yeah, but there's still that whole wife thing.\"**\n\nShe rolled her eyes. \n\n*\"Well, if that doesn't work out, my girl just broke up with her boyfriend, and I'll make sure she stays available.\"*\n\nI thought the daughter's face was going to catch fire, so red it was. The situation apparently calmed down, I told her and her visitors to call if she needed anything else, and thanked her for her time as I left. \n\n**NOT MY GUMDROP BUTTONS!!!**: So, I was sitting in the ED with Batman one day, on a patient that had been violent, but was now asleep. From the next room, we hear a voice that I swear came directly from the Gingerbread Man from Shrek.\n\n*\"I'm just...I'm just so bored I wanna die.\"*\n\nDude came in because he was \"suicidal\", though he later informed us it was just for attention. But I swear, he sounded just like the Gingerbread Man. \n\nSome of the more memorable things he said:\n\n*\"I have a plan on how, too. There's a fake plant at my grandma's house. I'll probably eat that till I die.\"*\n\n*\"I don't want to cause problems. I just want to eat that fake plant. It probably tastes fake too. I wonder if hot sauce would make it taste better.\"*\n",

        "text": "Introducing LazyAss. This co-worker of mine is the cookie-cutter textbook example of a lazy a**hole who brown noses and gets by with the bare minimum of work.  How he got hired as a low-level manager is beyond me as the guy is completely inept at everything except getting his reports in on time and ordering others to do his work.  He's got just about every \"office\" character stereotype rolled into one douche-bag.  \n\n* If upper management requests a task, he delegates out the entire workload so he's left with nothing to do except claim the credit for the work.  \n* The reflection from his computer screen on his back office window shows he's playing facebook games or some sort of browser game nearly all the time.  He ALT+TAB's the moment someone walks in his door.  \n* Doesn't know how to use even the most basic of Excel functions so he gets me to do all the calculations he is supposed to know given he's got a business degree.  \n* When LazyAss was hired, he had our company purchase a Keurig coffee machine along with the K-Cups just for his office so he could entertain clients.  In a years time, he's used it a grand total of 3 times for guests, but nearly every day for himself. The rest of us have to use the office coffee pots in the breakroom. \n\nNow to the story:  \n\nSo I am the Reports/Forms/Analyst guy at my company.  My actual title is very different from what I do because I work in the IT department.  This is important because LazyAss considers me his Go-To-Guy for just about everything technical.  My duties are to do reports and coding projects for 4 other departments but my Projects list is nearly 75% him making requests.  \n\nA few months back, I was assigned a rather lengthy \"urgent\" project from the Sales Department. It was to launch just after Thanksgiving and it was already the first week of November.  It was estimated and budgeted for at least a months worth of work and I had less than 2 weeks to get it done.  \n\nLazyAss was not accustomed to me being unavailable for his petty day-to-day shit and had nobody else to turn too.  I was the only one who knew how to do his job so he requested upper management to assign him 2 hours of each work day ON TOP of my month-long project.  All so I could do the stuff he should be doing normally that he's too lazy to do.  \n\nI was stressed out beyond belief for those 3 weeks.  Went home every day with splitting headaches and neck problems from being so tense.  We ended up launching the project a week after Thanksgiving (not due to me, but I needed the extra time) but that didn't stop LazyAss from trying to pawn off odd jobs and weekly reports onto me outside of the allotted two hours each day I was assigned to him.  \n\nI've got more stories on LazyAss that I'll share another day.  The thing is, I actually like the guy because he's funny, secures my job position because he speaks well of me in nearly every company meeting, and he gives me free range on company credit to make purchases for anything I need.  I've got the best company computer, best chair, lunch delivered to me twice a week... I totally see through his ruse but damnit... it works on me.  @#$%^@ found my weakness...",

        "text": "My company deals with large volume and we signed on a new client and with it, a bunch of new forms and PDF documents our asset managers have to use.  I'm directly in charge of Reports and Form creation... specifically the PDF's our asset managers and client asset managers use on and off-site.  One of the key functionality requests is that these PDF forms can be filled out from mobile devices.  In fact, its THE #1 reason our clients like us, continue to use us and its why they request we re-create their forms in our PDF format because the Form Fields are so mobile device ready. ** [SEE FORM FIELD EXAMPLE](http://foersom.com/net/HowTo/data/OoPdfFormExample.pdf) of what I'm referring too **  \n\nThis new client we signed on has a bitchy client relations manager who doesn't know jack and shit when it comes to technical stuff.  In fact, she's got zero knowledge of forms and electronic paperwork outside of Excel.  She's on the low end of the totem pole and was pretty much handed our account after all the CEO's, Sales Reps, VP's and lawyers from both sides had shook hands and signed contracts.  Having never met her during any of the negotiation meetings nor communicated with her via email, her first request was to make these 6 new forms in Excel.   Wait.. what? \n\n&gt; \"*I want the form fields to be locked down so the mobile asset manager can't edit any cell but the one they are told to fill in.*\"   \n\nI immediately protest as excel spreadsheets are not mobile friendly to use and their Security Protection isn't widely recognized with all apps. Doesn't matter as she's the client and in charge of our account.  She wants it her way because she's unfamiliar with PDF form fields and she uses Excel exclusively in all her other accounts.  \n\nI get all the other VP's, sales reps and CEO involved in this new form development process and they reach out to her to clarify that she wants Excel and not PDF.  They pretty much tell her that there are going to be drawbacks and technical problems in using this format as apposed to PDF.  I'm included in these email conversations and conference calls (mainly because I know these things and they don't) but we told basically that if the client wishes the forms in Excel, she's the client so \"*make it in excel*\".  I spend the next few weeks creating this elaborate multi-page excel spreadsheet for the 6 forms. Each with anywhere from 60-300 form fields (reason why it took so long and testing reasons too).  I lock them down and each form works Perfectly on the PC/Mac version of Microsoft office.  On the one app I used for my tablet, not-so-much. Every Cell could be edited even though the workbook was protected. But, doesn't matter... client wants what they want!   \n\nWe send over the 6 excel spreadsheets per exact specifications in the contract (No where does it state that the forms are to be Mobile device protected, just readable and usable which they are) and we wait.  Sure enough, 3 weeks later our VP's and Sales staff get the call that the forms *Don't Work* on mobile devices as requested.  \n&gt; *\"The on-site asset manager's can edit the fields they aren't supposed too\"*.  \n\nMy company was prepared for these questions because I told them exactly what was going to happen with functionality.  None of which would have happened had the bitchy client relations manager actually listened to me in the first place and gone with PDF.  \n\nOur company got the full brunt of the clients accusatory blame and a meeting was set up.  Our VP, CEO, Lawyer and myself met up with their main guy in charge to \"fix this\". We handed over all our email conversations, transcripts and contract negotiations that pointed the finger entirely on the bitchy client relations manager.  It showed she was aware of the potential functionality problem, made fully aware that this was going to happen but chose to ignore the issue so she could \"have it in a format I'm familiar with\".  The client rep in the meeting was left speechless.  As a peace token, we handed over the working \"corrected\" PDF's that we had originally talked about and negotiated with.  I had recreated them during the 3 weeks wait for the problem to arise (per CEO's orders).  The entire mess was brought about by one person and our client now knew about it. She was immediately pulled off the account and the new guy is actually good.   \n\n**TL:DR Bitchy Client Relations manager requests forms be created in a format that is not mobile friendly because she's unfamiliar with PDF versatility. She get's her company to blame the entire mobility problems on us. My company backs me up with proof. **",

Fortunately, we're on different shifts now, so I barely have to see him.\n\nIt's all well and good to say, \"here's this guy we all don't like\" and just let you all accept that he sucks. So, here's some stories before we get to the pizza story:\n\n- One day, I stayed late to finish up an order. His shift was after mine, so he came in, starts doing his start of shift stuff, but then decides to come over and \"help\" me. Now, I've worked here longer than he has, so this was all really annoying as he told me what I needed to do to set up a job that I already had running perfectly. After his third time coming over to my machine, I finally just take the time to stop and make his little changes so he leaves me alone. The next day at work, the lead in my work area comes in and asks me why I set up so damn weird. The answer, \"To get Harry Potter to leave me the hell alone\" was accepted without question.\n\n- I'm walking back to my work station after preparing up a big old cup of chemicals. I come around a corner, and there's HP, riding a pallet jack, coming straight for me. I react by stepping back, accidentally spilling some of the chemicals on me. He mumbles out \"oh, sorry, man\" as he flies by without stopping. In hindsight, I wish I would've stuck my steel toed boot right under his front wheel.\n\n- When he's setting up a job, he'll ignore the specifications on which parts to use to make sure the setup is done properly. He likes to grab the wrong part because \"it looks better to me if we use this gear instead.\" He's the only one who believes that his changes look better.\n\n- He loves trying to fix things himself when the machine breaks. Even though his \"fixes\" have caused hours of downtime, even though we have a dedicated maintenance department whose job it is to fix this stuff, *even though the plant director has told him to stop it*. \n\n- Recently, he finally got suspended for a day and removed from our high-speed work area. This was because, on a ~3000 piece order, he decided to just sort of Frankenstein the chemicals together without looking at the proper ratios. In the end, the chemical test for the order showed not only were the chemicals wrong, but as the order went on, they stopped even being consistent with each other. 3000 pieces, four different chemical mixes, all of it we had to scrap out.\n\n- Not only did he decide not to use the recipes in our database. One day, we can't get a certain mix right, despite following it perfectly in the recipe. After checking the database, it turns out that about 30 of our most critical mixes had been \"fixed\" by HP in one day. Needless to say, this threw a wrench in production that we're still trying to iron out.\n\nAlright, hopefully you find this guy annoying enough that what I'm about to say will come across as really funny, instead of only really mean. This takes place a while ago; most of the stories I've told didn't happen by this point, but HP was still generally disliked in the factory. He thought he was hot shit, though, and of course decided to try and fill an opening in one of the most brutal positions in the factory - high speed machine operator. On HP's first day, the operator on one of the other lines decides to be a huge troll. The other op walks up and starts talking to him, shooting the shit about how HP's working in the area now. Right before other op goes back to his own machine, he says, \"Damn, with you over here, it's gonna be tough to get that pizza party.\" HP frowns, \"Pizza party?\" Other op, in master troll mode, makes up this story about how, every week, the best high speed machine operator and his crew earned a pizza party for themselves.\n\nHP is pumped. Not only does he get to show off how great he is and win something, he also gets a pizza party. That first week, he hit the ground running. While he didn't break any records, he still came in first that week, and was super proud of himself. His smug grin as he saw the performance chart was all too temporary, though. He found the shift supervisor and walked up, feeling like hot shit, and just said, \"So, my line got number one this week.\" The supervisor sort of frowns like 'why are you telling me this?' but says, \"yeah, you did, good job!\" HP goes on, \"So, then, uh, how does this pizza party work out?\" The super frowns again and just asks, \"What pizza party?\" It was about then that he finally realized he'd been had.\n\nAnd of course, management made sure to let him know that he needed to keep those numbers up...",

        "text": "So I just got home from work and need to unload this insanity which is a little long, but I think totally worth it. \n\nI work at a homeless shelter that serves the most stereotypically homeless folks you can imagine. These are mostly people that have major drug/alcohol addictions or people with heavy mental illnesses and no way for anyone to get any help for them other than a roof over their heads and a hot meal at night so they don't freeze/starve to death. We are lucky enough to have our cities' church congregations let us rotate between their facilities while providing home-cooked meals on an almost nightly basis. Because the buildings are not made to house tons of people in a comfortable way we just throw everyone in the same room, give them a cot and a sleeping bag and once lights-out happens at 10 pm we have to stay awake and monitor them to ensure there are no fights and that no one stops breathing from an overdose, etc...\nTwo nights ago I came in and was told that there was one guy who was on his last warning about disrespecting staff and would have to leave if he did so again. He seemed fine the entire night other than randomly laughing to himself (which happens, and if the people who do that keep to themselves and don't become too loud it's usually pretty easy to let them do their own thing) until about 2 am when he got up and sat at a table by himself. This wouldn't have been a problem except that he started drumming his fingers on the table loudly and disrupting other people's sleep and was generally being super lame. I went over to ask him to knock it off and he immediately sprung into defensive asshole mode and loudly asked if I had a problem with him, or if I was racist (I'm white, he was black), if I wanted to fight, etc...Luckily for me there was another staff member who is 6'3\" 200 who was able to help me calm him down and ask him to leave. Nothing ended up happening but I was a little on edge and had to work the next night (last night) with not enough sleep.\n\nI came in last night and found I would be working with a new guy who was a shy college student that would be helpful in terms of filling out our paperwork, serving the meals, and checking off their morning chores but was not the type of personality that would be able to help if something major went down. The other guy there was in his mid-50's (we'll call him Jim) but seemed fairly confident in what he was doing and was very friendly and gregarious with most of the residents and had the kind of vibe that told me he'd done this kind of thing before. Right away Jim started to take charge of everything and was delegating our staff responsibilities, helping people set up for bed and generally taking some things off my plate. While I was technically the supervisor because he was just a volunteer, I was more than happy to not have to do quite as much and just sit back and read some super misogynistic James Bond novels. There were two families that had recently lost their homes and he was helping the older kids with their math homework and teasing the little kids and while most everyone turned in early for sleep, the ones that stayed awake seemed generally low-key and I was prepared for the chillest night ever. \n\nThat lasted until about 11pm when Jim took one of the residents (we'll call him Steve) outside to talk about something. Steve is the kind of guy who would have been the stereotypical jock/alpha/douchebag type if he had grown up with a rich family, but instead had spent most of his 28 years on the streets directing his braggadocios-nous outwards in the form of loudly swearing and generally creating ruckus. He's a nice enough guy when he's calm and he doesn't ever attack anyone physically or verbally, but he'll let you know reeeeeeal quick when he thinks something is bullshit with lots of colorful language and a voice that can carry for miles. Jim and Steve come back in after about 15 minutes and Steve goes back to his bed while Jim motions for me to come outside and talk. He lets me know that he caught Steve in the bathroom doing Crystal Meth which is a huge problem because having drugs, alcohol, or weapons is the one sure-fire way to get yourself kicked to the curb. We don't care if you come in intoxicated as long as it doesn't spill over onto anyone else, but doing that in the shelter is a major no-no. I immediately told Jim that Steve would have to go and Jim let me know that he thought Steve was a good guy, that he hadn't actually caught him smoking the meth (just hurriedly shoving the contraband down his pants), and that he had talked to him about God and told him \"Jesus loves you man, and so do I\". Right then I realized that this guy was sort of a hippy-dippy, love everyone and give everyone a chance type of person which was great for patience, but rules is rules and we had to kick Steve out and let the big bosses who run the shelter figure it out tomorrow. Jim kept pushing me to let him stay but I wielded my authority after about 6 tries and he relented. We wens inside and I brought Steve out by myself and told him the deal and he immediately started yelling about Jim having it out for him, that he \"knew all about Jim and the shit he's done\", and that he was innocent and that he didn't do shit, etc, etc...\n\nI've been through this same song and dance about a million times and in this situation the resident will do anything they can to try and stay but I firmly let him know I didn't care and he needed to go. Steve escalated his words against Jim and started saying that he had hit on him and that he was a pedophile (which, dude, you're  almost 30. Maybe he's gay, but why the hell would you call him a pedo unless you don't know the difference?) and I gave him one last chance to get his stuff and leave before I called the cops. He calmed down real quick and pulled out his phone and I told him to hurry up, but he pleaded with me to let him show me one thing before I made him leave. Since it wasn't 2 in the morning like the night before I relented a little if only to placate him and after a minute of typing some stuff he handed me his phone. \n\nOn it was a picture of a disheveled looking Jim, obviously in a mug-shot situation with the words Registered Sex Offender printed underneath. Below that was his offense which read: Continuous Sexual Abuse of Child. I was stunned. Did Steve somehow make this up? I pulled out my phone, quickly googled Jim's full name and the name of our city, and sure enough, the first 2 links were to Sex Offender sites that listed his full name with the same mugshots I had just seen. I stood there for a second as my brain re-booted itself to reality, before the image of Jim laughing and joking with the kids earlier popped into my brain. I rushed inside, shoved my phone in Jim's face and gave him the most disgusted, questioning look I could muster. Immediately his face dropped and he collected his things and left as I shuffled myself in between him and the place where the kids were sleeping. Luckily Steve seemed to understand how pissed and confused I was so he didn't try and confront Jim on his way out the door and create any more trouble. I called my boss and let them know the deal before calling the police and letting them know exactly what had happened. I have no idea what repercussions he will face, but I do know that it freaked me the hell out.\n\ntl dr: Worked at a homeless shelter and the scariest guy there wasn't a homeless person.",

        "text": "I've been at this job for a month and I think my family is going to put me in an institution.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI worked at an office supplies store (yes, that one) for 3 years. Miserable years. Working there is a whole other post. I really loved my job at one point, but eventually, the love of retail fades away. I was getting tired of the shitty pay for everything that I did, so I started looking for a new job.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI was pretty much sending out my resume to any and every job that wasn't fast food/retail/hospitality. I'm a pretty fast learner and I'm pretty good with computers and people, I feel like I can honestly succeed at anything because failures not an option, and all that.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThere was an ad on my community's website for a Leasing Consultant. Basically, a rental community. Apartments, townhouses, whatever. I was like oh cool, let's just throw my resume into their hat and sure enough I got called in for an interview. Cool beans.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI go in for my interview and the property manager starts asking the typical questions. We're getting along well and I'm like yaas I am killin' it. Well, then she tells me that she's decided to leave her job. The whole time she's talking about quitting (because she talked to me about it for about 15 minutes, honestly my actual interview was like 5 minutes long), it reminded me of the scene from Office Space where Peter's talking about how he doesn't like his job, and he's just not gonna go anymore. But imagine a woman who looks like a witch (and is, in fact, a fucking witch) saying it with no happiness at all, just completely miserable. She informed me she made her decision on that like 2 minutes prior to me getting there and I was the first person to know (woo?).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI thought she was a crazy person, honestly, so I was like whatever. Well, she offers me the job and I'm like yeah that's cool. She informs me that she is not leaving after all, has been promoted to corporate offices, and will sometimes come back to our office to help train people and stuff.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo she was moving on up and considering they will no longer have the \"President Property Manager\" (yeah, they made a title for her because, from what I've heard, just being a \"property manager\" wasn't good enough... [not her actual title btw]) and Property Manager, they had to promote someone to Assistant Property Manager.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo. That's me being new and this other girl who's been here for 3 years but doesn't shit about what she was promoted to. The Property Manager and this girl used to work together at our sister property. So Assistant Property Manager was transferred to the office that I would be working at.\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nRemember when I said the President was going to be coming to our office to help? The reason that was was because no one had taken their vacations. We were in November and no one had taken their vacations. And the President decides to quit for reals this time. Like, 2 days after I started.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEver since then, I have not been trained properly and things that they assume is common sense because they've been doing it forever, is actually not common sense. How am I supposed to know that I'm supposed to write up an acknowledgement for people turning in notices when you're never here to go over protocols with me.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDid I mention that I've been by myself 75% of the time since I started? Because Assistant Property Manager is always at her old office (which is our sister property), because she cares more about that one cause that's where she worked for 3 years. I understand that, but I never have a manager in my office. I'm not being taught anything and I'm basically just figuring shit out on my own. The few times they've been in there, they will gaslight the shit out of me. \"Well, Property Manager said not to update the status until I have their move in money\" \"No, I did not SAY not to update the status\" Her exact words were: \"Don't put them down on anything until we have all of the money, and then put it in the report\". I took anything as don't fucking put them on anything! I mean...duh? They do this to me every fucking time one or both are in the office. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI've been winging it since I started and Assistant Property Manager left me an email last night that really ticked me off. She decided to make a very long list of things that I'm doing \"wrong\". There was a lease that was signed that was missing some initials in some spots. I've been calling that motherfucker for a WEEK to get him to come in and I've been notating every time I call him (we all have to leave notes in a fucking composition book which sure is good for some things, but if you're not even going to go back and read the amount of times I've written that I tried calling, leaving him voicemails and emails, etc. than what is the fucking point of it?) And she had the nerve to say \"There is a lease that was missing spots and it is unacceptable that there was no follow up to him about it\" Bitch, WHAT? And of course, he came in as soon as she called him yesterday when I was off. I've left that motherfucker 4 voicemails and 2 emails, for fucks sakes.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnd then there was \"I noticed there were many notices to vacate this week but I haven't seen or reviewed ANY acknowledgement letters.\" What the fuck? I didn't fucking know I had to write acknowledgement letters and I told her EVERY fucking time I got a notice and she NEVER mentioned any kind of acknowledgement letter. I get that she's learning a new job too, but fuck off, lady. And she said that I'm supposed to update the resident cards despite the fact everything we do is logged in the program we use, and if \"the owners were to see that, it would look negatively against you.\" FUCK YOU. YOU DIDN'T FUCK TELL ME I HAD TO UPDATE THE GUEST CARDS! ONLY THE SHIT ON THE COMPUTER. FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU. I seriously took this as a fucking threat. If any of the shit going on currently negatively effects anybody, it's dumb and dumber who can't seem to get their shit together. I had no fucking idea I was supposed to update the fucking pieces of paper when everything I do is ONLINE.  Good fucking god.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n            \nSimply put, they don't give a shit about my property and my residents. Whenever I see them, it's always \"Oh, sister property would NEVER do that! OUR residents don't act like this!\" etc. It's fucking crazy to me. I get it, President Witch had her way of doing things at this property, and I have a feeling they do this shit with me because I was hired by President Witch. I feel like they're intentionally trying to confuse me and fuck me up because I'm basically what is left over from President Witch.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI don't want to be a job hopper as I've only been here for a month, but I can't imagine being here for another year, honestly. Whether I quit out of frustration or get fired because I don't \"get it\". I get the job just fine, it's the protocols that I'm struggling with because they have never been explained to me. Instead, I'm left to die in a sea of whale shit.\n\n",

        "text": "I've worked at several front desk/reception areas in a college setting. This particular event occurred when I was working in an Admissions Office.\n\nAs some general background: people of all ages, situations, and degrees of schooling would call this office. Besides high schoolers and their parents calling about the application process, we'd get calls about financial aid, signing up for classes, living on campus, etc. \n\nRecently, the college started making the switch to having most of its \"heavy duty\" materials (like the course catalog) moved to online-only formats. This resulted in mass confusion for parents and students alike who insisted they wanted a hard copy mailed to them (a huge no-no for our office) or thought that an online version wasn't reliable (um.).\n\nThe following is a conversation I had with a middle-aged woman (we'll call Ms. Doubtsmuch) over the phone about this course catalog:\n\nG: Admissions, this is GingerontheRocks speaking.  \nM: So... can I have one of those class book things mailed to me?  \nG: Unfortunately, we do not have any copies we could mail to you as the whole course catalog is online.  \nM: *pauses* What do you mean \"online\"?  \nG: They're only available on the website.  \nM: *pauses again, slight anger in her voice* Well, that seems impractical. Are you sure you don't have any books that you're hiding?  \nG: I'm pretty sure.   \nM: *scoffs* Well, I bet you wouldn't tell me because it's company policy to upset the customer.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe rant continued a bit longer until finally, Ms. Doubtsmuch gave in and asked for me to help her find the webpage.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nG: The url is really long and kinda complicated. It might be easier if I just email you the link. Could you provide me with an email address?  \nM: And get a virus from your mailing list? HA! No, thank you.  \nG: *starting to get a bit impatient* Alright. Type the following into the address bar-  \nM: Address bar?  \nG: It's up near the top of your internet browser window.  \nM: I clicked on the \"E\". Now what do I do?  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt took me a good thirty seconds to give her the basics of a browser window which was thirty seconds to wonder what kind of s*** I had committed in my last life that induced such karma. Once we had established \"the internet's window\", I started to read off the url.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nG: So, it's university.edu-  \nM: What about the \"www\"? Websites don't work without that!  \nG: Well, it's not necessary to type that, but if you want to...  \nM: So, what comes after \"www.\" again?  \nG: University.edu/ (At this point, I literally said \"forward slash\")-  \nM: Now you're making things up.  \nG: *laughs*  \nM: Excuse me. What part of this is funny?  \nG: *realizes she's not joking* Um, sorry. Forward slash?  \nM: Start talking in layman's terms because I'm not getting it.  \nG: It's just to the left of the shift key; it's on the same key as the question mark.  \nM: Where's that?  \nG: *starts to short-circuit*  \nM: I found it! Okay, continue.  \nG: /education- (*Hyphen*)  \nM: *silence*  \nG: Ma'am?  \nM: English.  \nG: Excuse me?  \nM: Speak. In. ENGLISH.  \nG: I'm sorry, I guess I'm confused.   \nM: What's this \"happen\"?  \nG: Oh. Hyphen. You know, a dash?  \nM: A dash.  \nG: Yes.  \nM: *silence*  \nG: *struggling to think of another word* Dash? It's two keys away from the \"Backspace\"?  \nM: *scoffs, then laughs* Oh. You mean the line.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSomething inside of me died that day. I'm not sure I've ever recovered from it. I don't remember much of the phone call after that, other then her complaining a bit more about the college not being very helpful, as the major she was interested in wasn't even offered at the college I worked at.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTL;DR: If you call a hyphen a line, prepared to be punched in the throat.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\nedit: formatting",

Fred was two years out of school and had doubled his salary by joining us.  He was single, living with his parents, and the sudden salary increase meant he was effectively living in luxury.\n\nMy wife was taken ill suddenly - one of these strange skin diseases that manifests every other symptom except the one that matters.  She was rushed into hospital and pumped full of antibiotics and was told afterwards that she had come within 30 minutes of having her leg amputated.\n\nMy boss was understanding.  He was a new father and the work policies allowed for flexible hours for family emergencies at managers discretion.  He agreed, and I worked from home for half the day after I had collected the children from school.  This lasted five weeks, with the last week being solely being based at home.\n\nShe came back home, legs still attached and forever needing to wear compression stockings (super sexy stockings as she calls them) and not being allowed to wear heels or run / play sports.  \n\nDay 1 of a normal working day, and Fred mutters the words...\n\n&gt;... I wish I had a wife and kids so I could work from home when they were ill.\n\nHe couldn't understand why I was upset or why the boss had to calm me down.\n\nThe happy ending of this is that he manipulated himself into a job role that was cut six months later.",

        "text": "Last week, I interviewed a ton of people for a groundskeeper/maintenance position. During this one guy's interview, I could not get him to stay on topic. He told me all kinds of sob stories about how he was a pizza delivery guy for years and he got laid off and now his kids are hungry and he barely gets any food stamps. He tells me he's started his own business and then immediately says, \"Oops I shouldn't have told you that. I'm doing a bunch of illegal tax stuff. Don't tell.\" He also had no skills relevant to the position we were trying to fill. I told him I would let him know on Friday either way about the job, but I already knew he wasn't a good fit for us.\n\nFriday, I called a ton of people to let him know the position had been filled. Almost all of the numbers I called went to a voicemail that hadn't been set up and there was no way to leave a message. I could've sworn I called this guy back, but it's possible that I missed one.\n\nToday, he comes in the office and asks about the job. I said, \"Oh I'm sorry, I thought I called everyone. We filled the position, but thanks for your interest and best of luck to you!\" His face instantly turned to rage and he yelled, \"OK WELL CAN I AT LEAST BORROW A PEN TO FILL OUT ANOTHER APPLICATION!?!?!?\" and I was like, \"uhhhhhhhhhhh sure buddy. No problem.\" So he took the pen and left. He came back inside about 30 seconds later and said \"This is a blue pen and I need fucking BLACK INK!!\" and threw it at me and left. We had a gravel parking lot, so when he peeled out of the parking lot, he sprayed rocks all over the side of the office building and the windows. I ran outside to see if any rocks scratched my pretty new car, and I saw a huge scratch on the back bumper. It's about a foot long and I know for sure it wasn't there when I got here this morning. He's also been the only other car in the parking lot today.\n\nMy groundskeeper called and asked if I was ok, and he said he saw him get out of his car and walk over to my car. They made eye contact and that's when he came back in the office and then left.\n\nWell, dumbass, I have your freaking resume with your name, address, phone number, driver's license number and social security number. The cops have already come and made a report, and even though they said they wouldn't be able to press charges since THEY didn't see him, he noted in the report that all evidence points to this guy. They are turning the report over to the city attorney's office in a few days to see how they want to handle it.\n\nI'm so mad. And sad. I worked and saved so hard for this car. It was my first \"adult\" purchase and I've babied it. I've never had something so nice before and then this asshole just decides to scratch it because he didn't get the job. ",

Sweet potatoes are low carb, so it’s healthy, right?”\n\nThird place goes to a comment made by a disgruntled old coot on the telephone Monday morning. “Why can’t ya’ll just fix all my broken shit for free? I paid ya’ll good money for this house 22 years ago and now it looks like crap!”\n\nSecond place was taken by Duchess Marlena Brittany Manicure Parker Von Bitchface of Hipsterville-on-Statfordston, nearly tying for first with the gem, “I want, like, everything on your menu for a party, and do you guys like let people borrow your employees so I can have servers?”\n\nFirst place, though nearly overtaken by Duchess Von Bitchface, was a clear winner, going to Mr. and Mrs. I.

        "text": "I own a tailor shop. When I first started there 10 years ago as a mere employee, the owner told me that we only did prepay because he had way too many instances of people leaving their stuff with us, then never coming back for it. Meanwhile, he'd have to pay employees to work on it, but then never get paid himself. He had no exceptions and everyone had to pay when they dropped off.\n\nOh how people complained about it. Most backed off when we mentioned how people never came back for their stuff and how they ruined it for everyone. Some still complained. But the boss never backed down.\n\nA few years later he sold the place and the new owner was mostly the same, but she'd let it slide for new customers who didn't know the policy. We still had some people that would abandon their clothes. We'd try calling them and their numbers wouldn't work. We had some stuff for several YEARS (we had the room to hold onto it). Some would drop off their things and ask for it to be done same/next day (our usual time was 3 days to a week) which incurred an 'urgency fee.' Then they'd come back a week later and say \"Well, I didn't pick it up the next day so I don't want to pay that extra fee!\" as if that was okay.\n\nAnyway, I eventually bought the place. I had to move the shop over a couple doors. Despite advertising, business dropped off by half. So I relaxed the prepay policy even more just to get the work in. Yeah, that was dumb. I think I am going to go back to the way it used to be and only relax it for my few loyal regulars whom I know are good for it.\n\nRight now I have two unpaid for orders that I think are abandoned. The first is 6 pairs of jeans. She came in several weeks ago to ask about my prices. At the time she asked if she left them with me, could her mother (who lives a couple of provinces away) phone in and pay with her credit card over the phone. I said no, that my POS wouldn't allow that (though now I have figured out how to do it, I feel it is too risky) and that I had to have the card present. She was like \"Oh, okay! She is coming for a visit soon, so I will just come in a week before that and drop them off. When I come pick them up she will be with me and can pay for it then. Is that okay?\" I said it wasn't something I liked doing, but that was better than paying over the phone.\n\nTwo weeks ago she came in and tried on all the pants (she had to admire her bum in the mirror EACH time) and I pinned them all up. To get my 'jean hem special' they had to be left with me for a week, it was a Friday. The next Wednesday I was preparing garments for sewing when she called up. She said that she was going to be \"going to [province her mom lives in] for good\" and could she possibly pick up her jeans a day early. Since they were cut already and it was easy to add them to the next days work, I said okay. ... She never showed up. So now I have a stack of 6 jeans and I bet I won't see that $47.\n\nThe second one I am sure is abandoned is a winter jacket that needed a new zipper. He was just visiting and lives one province over. He brought it in on Tuesday, when I said that it would be ready next Tuesday he said that he was leaving on Monday. I said no problem, I would make sure it was ready on Saturday (I work alone so I am closed Sun/Mon) and told him that I am open from 10 until 3 on Saturdays and it would be ready FIRST THING. New zippers in jackets was a very pricey thing to do under the previous owners. At least $35 for the labour, plus $6 to $10 for the zip itself if you didn't provide your own. I had so many people whinge about the cost that when I took over, I lowered the hoodie and 'easy method' (cutting out the old zipper with a razorblade instead of picking the outside/lining apart, and just putting the new zip on top or underneath) to $19.99 for labour. At least this way I would get -some- money instead of the customer walking out.\n\nAnyway, I told him that if I do this the easy way it would be $19.99 for the labour, and an extra $9.99 because I would have to clip off all of the snap pieces on one side and then replace them because they were in the way. He brought his own zipper. So his total was $31.48. I had to repeat it a few times because he was astonished that it cost 'so much.' Then he said \"Is $30 okay?\" I said no, sorry but we have to pay the GST (man, I am already charging way less than he would have had to pay a couple of years ago!). He was like okay and as I was entering the details of his job into the computer... he walked out. Left the jacket though... so I figured he just thought this was a 'pay at pickup' sort of place.\n\nI got the jacket done a day early...  but couldn't even call his cell 'cause he left before I could ask for the number. So I waited all day on Saturday... and yeah of course he didn't show up. I bet that if he came it would have been at like 4:30 or something and was all pissed that I wasn't open. But because my Saturday hours are different than my weekday hours, I always tell people to make sure they come before 3pm.\n\nSo now I am out that $31.48. But in both cases, even though I know the customers are living in other provinces and most likely will not be back... I have to wait 60 days until their items are considered abandoned. Then maybe I can sell them on CL or something.\n\nIt is people like that who ruin it for everyone. :C I need to pay my bills too guys. I can't do free work all the time!\n\n___\n\nedit: The guy with the jacket picked up! Strange that he is still in town (it is Thursday now and he was supposed to pick up last Saturday) when he said he was leaving several days ago so that is why I had to do it early. Oh well. I got my $31.50 so I am happy about that!",

Since the flooding one of our schools is non-operational and had to be squeezed into another so they can have school as well.\n\nI had been looking for work for two months. ( I am in college but took a year off because my step-father broke his foot and has been out of work. He ran out of sick days and we got behind. I also need to save for a vehicle.) Anyways I searched and got to just about everyone within reason that I could apply to. I finally got an interview at a local school district for janitorial. Well once I got the interview everything went great! She even said there was a full time position open since I made it clear that I REALLY needed full time. She asked me if I wanted part time (at school A) or full time (at school B). So I said \"I really would prefer school B since I need full time!\" She said \"Fantastic well we need to do some paperwork, SLED background, and you need a TB test.\" All is well and I go get my TB test and turn it in 3 days later. She takes it and slips it past me at the last moment that she gave away the full time job and is giving me part time working at the \"new\" school location as a temp. So I'm a bit disappointed but go on about my day. Go back to the office, finalize paperwork and was told to start last Thursday. Finally everything clears and I start. Not only has my official boss never heard of me, neither has my unofficial one who is in charge of said \"new school.\" So now I'm stuck at a different one (the one mine was merged into) doing different work there until the district manager is back (she just started a week long vacation). So I'm in some limbo where I'm doing a job that wasn't supposed to be mine (floor tech), at a different school than i was supposed to be at,  and am working for someone who had no idea any new employees were coming. \n\nI guess the $11.07/hour starting pay is the only redeeming thing this situation has.",

Basically, I watch people work and tell them they are doing it wrong.  Lately, we have been having a pretty dramatic uptick in warranty replacement for one of our products, like 1 in 5 is coming back not working.  \n\nObviously, this makes some people in the company a bit edgy.  Specifically, both the president and CEO of the company are alarmed at this issue.  Meetings are had, problems are discussed, and finally it is decided, maybe someone should go to that plant and have a look.\n\nMy boss tells me to go over every aspect of [PRODUCT] to see if there is a reason we are having this very specific problem.  Now, our relationship with the managers in this plant are tense at best.  The manager is the son of the owner's best friend in the whole wide world, and 4 generations of this family have been working here since the dawn of time.  \n\nSo, as the duly appointed King of the Universe, he doesn't see a real need for things like, specifications, work instructions, measuring equipment, etc.  He has begrudgingly accepted these things into his world, but only after much sturm and drang, and only in very limited quantities.  \n\nAll of his minions, sub-minions, and lackeys are in lock step with him on this.  Even those steeped in the traditions of design and engineering, defer to his god-like power and authority.\n\nI make my way into the dragon's lair. My only weapons are a pen and a ream of printed copies of the work instructions, and a faith in ISO:9001 to guide me.  \n\nNow, in all modesty, I know what I'm doing, what I'm looking at, and how it all is supposed to fit.  You aren't going to baffle me with BS to excuse bad practice.  I try to get along with everyone, and I explain to the workers I am not there to get them in trouble, just see how the process is done, and make recommendations to correct bad practice, or bad process.  \n\nHowever, over the week, I began to see that words like \"practice\" and \"process\" were words for elite, ivory towered, eggheads and here in the real world, shit gets done how we see fit.  \n\nWorkers were not inspecting key features, not using the right tools, not testing for proper alignment, or making sure it actually even ran correctly.  \n\n*[INTERNAL SCREAMING INTENSIFIES]*\n\nSo, after a week of observing this process, getting push back from engineers on simple issues, while ducking questions from Manager-God, I am having to write a flowery verse describing these sins in detail without directly implicating M-G, or his holiest of kingdoms.\n\nThe write up took several days of rough drafts, amended filings, and tequila to finally submit an audit finding that was bullet-proof, but still doused in enough perfume to cover the smell of crap.\n\nFast-forward to a meeting had yesterday, RE: The Problem.  M-G is asked point-blank about the issues regarding the audit, and with some deft hand waving, dismisses the entire finding and attributes the problem to a vendor.  Pres. and CEO seem satisfied with that observation, meeting ended.  I wasn't in the meeting, but was stationed outside the meeting just in case, and I swear I heard my boss's jaw hit the table.  \n\nTL;DR - Sent to see why all hell is breaking loose, devil calmly explains why it's the rest of the world not working correctly.\n\n[This is the mantra.](http://imgur.com/NPxmw3Q)",
