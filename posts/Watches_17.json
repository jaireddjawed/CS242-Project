I'm planning to extend the work trip and make it a vacation, and I started thinking that it would be nice to buy the orient in japan as a souvenir of the trip, after all, orient is a Japanese brand.\n\nSo I suspended my researches waiting for the trip to happen, but while browsing this subreddit I saw a couple of posts about watches purchased while on a trip, with foreign days name, and I thought I'd love to buy the orient with the names of the days in kanji!\n\nSo I started browsing the internet looking for the right product code for an asian market Orient mako 2 blue but I couldn't find any picture of this watch with kanji day name.\n\nSo I'm here asking the fellow japanese redditors, does the orient mako 2 exists with the names of the days in kanji?\n\nif it doesn't exists, what watch brands, in the orient price range, can you tell for sure make automatic watches with dates in japanese?  \nThey don't have to look like the orient, I just need the brand names to browse for some model I may like.\n\nThanks in advance for your help!",

However, it's generally a good idea to start by doing some research on the product's average selling price and any ongoing promotions or sales.\n\nOnce you have a good understanding of the market, you can then begin negotiating with the seller. You could aim for a discount of 5-10%, but keep in mind that the seller may not be willing to go that low. Ultimately, the key to successful negotiation is to be prepared, remain calm, and communicate your needs clearly and respectfully.",

Yes, I realize that Max Bill's are entry level, but we're not talking about $50 either.\n    Don't want to be stuck with a dud and fighting to get my money back should that happen.\n    \n    Or am I better off just waiting until I go to on a holiday in Europe and getting it there in order to avoid paying the VAT and duty (I live in Canada) and ensuring that the watch works?\n    \n    Also is the black Max Bill (without the date window), not available in 38mm with a manual wind?
