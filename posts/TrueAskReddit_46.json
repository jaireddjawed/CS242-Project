But obviously without tax revenue and a healthy GDP, governments would cease to function. Money is their lifeblood just like it is for any companies.\n\nIt's been a long while since I read books such as Snow Crash by Neal Stevenson. My recollection is hazy but I think in that world governments had ceased to exist and in their place were giant corporations that openly ruled the world's geography.\n\nWe've already kind of seen this in the real world, in history, when the British East Indian company took over the rule of the Indian subcontinent.\n\nCould the same effect apply across every continent in the future?",

I was very into religion, and I was very meek and clueless about the world - a bit sheltered. I went to college, learned about more complex topics and had professors that challenged my way of thinking. I begin to have some doubts. My whole worldview came down around me, and it was quite painful. On an emotional level, it's very difficult since my whole family is still quite conservative and they love to attack me during get-togethers. \n\nNow, I find myself stuck. I'm trying to make informed opinions about what I believe, but it seems like even credible sources state opposing conclusions. If a political discussion does come up, then I usually just clam up since I feel like I'll never be informed enough to make a decision on certain topics. I also have that whole childhood experience thing mucking things up.\n\nTLDR: How do you cut through all the crap and get to the facts? How do you know your source is being as unbiased as possible? How did you form your political views, and how can you be confident that what you're saying is based on sound logic?",

        "text": "I noticed a lot of overlap in what a sniper does in the army and what drones do.  But there seem to be a lot of advantages drones have that snipers don't.\n\n- The most important: drones are expendable machines.  Snipers are irreplaceable humans.\n\nWhen a sniper hides in concealment, observing an area, he can still be targeted.  Countersnipers, artillery strikes, mortars, all sorts of things could still kill him, even in concealment.  With a drone, even if the worst happens and it is shot down, it's still just a machine, significantly less costly to replace, and more importantly, no lives are lost.  Unless we're starting a new #DroneLivesMatter campaign.\n\n- Drones are machines, snipers are humans.\n\nI know I said this already, but this time I mean in the sense that drones don't get tired.  Drones don't get sleepy.  Drones don't get hungry or thirsty, and they have no bodily functions like needing to pee or to poo.  They can loiter for many hours, and they don't even blink.  Now snipers are awesome, but they're still humans.  As such, they very much need to do all those things.\n\n- Drones have an aerial view, humans are terrestrial\n\nA drone can hover above a target, which often grants a significant tactical advantage.  Having a bird's-eye view of a battlespace is huge.  Now a sniper could hide in a tree, but I've yet to see a tree that can move.  A drone can have a similar aerial view as a sniper in a tree, with the added advantage that it can relocate if necessary, while remaining airborne.  It can also follow a target much more easily.\n\nA sniper trying to track a moving vehicle would have to attempt to keep it in his sights at all times, and if it goes behind a building, over a hill, or other such obstacle, could lose sight of the target entirely.  Meanwhile a drone could simply follow it from the air and keep an eye on the target at nearly all times, unless it were to move into a cave or building (at which time it would have been invisible to the sniper as well).\n\nNow, perhaps there are a few places where snipers could have an advantage.  For example, a sniper can carry a lot more than just two rounds, whereas the payloads for a predator drone is up to four Hellfire missiles (and my understanding is that it doesn't usually carry quite that many).  So one could argue, a drone is a remote-controlled sniper rifle with only four shots.\n\nBut my counterargument is that most snipers are reconnaissance anyway.  Firing their weapon often means giving away their position, so my understanding is that they avoid doing so unless there's a particularly important target to shoot at.  In terms of recon, would not a drone be superior to a human sniper in nearly every way, for all the reasons given?\n\nAnd when a shot needs to be taken, how is a Hellfire missile worse, exactly, to a sniper's bullet?  In fact, if I'm not mistaken, the operator of the drone can actually change the trajectory of the Hellfire even after it is fired, to follow a target if necessary.  This is something a sniper cannot do with his bullet once it has left the muzzle of his rifle.\n\nAlso, Autonomous Rotorcraft Sniper System: http://www.sdl.usu.edu/programs/arss\n\nWe will soon have a sniper rifle mounted onto a rotorcraft drone.  All the benefits of having a sniper, with none of the drawbacks (pretty much).  The way I see it, a sniper can kill someone at 1000 yards, and yet technically still be in danger.  A drone operator can kill someone at 100 _miles_, and be in no danger whatsoever.  So why, again, do we need snipers?  In what situation would a sniper outperform a drone?",
