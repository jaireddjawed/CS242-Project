        "text": "I moved to Argentina a few months ago and I signed up on some \"expat\" forum to seek advice etc. I already had a bad impression of most 'expat' communities, as I found from experiences in Asia that they're mostly sex tourists. I figured Argentina might be different, as it's basically a third-world white majority nation, so no one's going to come here to satiate their racial fetish or abuse white privilege. But nope, still full of weird ass creeps.\n\nHere is a post from yesterday on a forum I've been reading. The OP is 60 years old:\n\n&gt; I have been in Argentina since 2004 and have noticed huge social changes in just 14 years . When I came **I noticed it was a very romantic city with passionate couples kissing openly on the streets and park benches** . This was a very common sight . Now in 2018 there seems to be very little romance in Buenos Aires and the roles of men and woman seem to have changed dramatically **In 2004 men were quite masculine with long hair , facial hair, and a more aloof onda . Woman were more feminine with more self respect for their bodies and very well dressed compared to 2018** ( there was certainly more anorexia as well back then) Nowadays the youth seem to be very overweight and boys and girls seem to look similar . Something drastic has happened to the food supply as **men and womans body shape has been transformed for the worse.** In Starbucks when I look at the students inside they seem very unhealthy and z88I hardly see one young couple making out** . It seems that the pick up culture of quick sex is huge here judging by the lack of couples on the street who are in love with each other .\n\n&gt; I love to hear others expats opinions on this interesting subject\n\nLiterally no one saw anything wrong with this post. This old man is talking about how he doesn't approve of the \"body shapes\" that he oogles in the street, and that he wishes he could see more young people making out. But apparently this is a very normal post for these guys.\n\nThe first reply, from another old turd named \"earlyretirement\":\n\n&gt; I agree with this. It's true. I've been in Argentina for 16+ years. I do think that there used to be more \"romance\" with people in parks having picnics and kissing, holding hands walking down the street. You still people drinking mate in the parks but it's a lot of friends vs. couples. When I moved there people dressed better. People definitely were romantic.\n\nAnother old fart weighs in:\n\n&gt; All true. Fewer displays of affection in public. Lots of overweight people. Slovenly appearance. It's all changed. Have dating apps played a role? Easy pickups, quick sex and no commitments? I suspect STD rates have also increased.\n\nOP responds, lamenting the lack of anorexia:\n\n&gt; Anorexia was commonly seen in the streets back then and obesity was rarely seen. Nowadays I have not seen a anorexic person in three years and most people are overweight and many obese. Argentina has the fattest people of Latin America nowadays\n\nHe weighs in again later, to complain about feminism and the \"manspaying movement\" (??)\n\n&gt; Many people here on this forum and in the modern world have noticed this huge social change. Im sure you are aware that Argentina has one of the lowest marriage rates in the world and people are not forming families. Ni una menos is honorable in the context of protecting all females from violence in relationships but as you are aware there are extremes in the feminism movement that has painted men as inheritely agressive and murderers. Now we have the manspaying movement taken hold all over the world. Do you not think this is too extreme? Im all for equal rights but with mutual respect\n\nThat's just one post. They're pretty much all like this.\n\nI'm purposefully going to avoid white, English-speaking expats from now on and avoid calling myself an expat rather than an immigrant. Fuck these people.",
