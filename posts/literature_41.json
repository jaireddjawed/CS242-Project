        "text": "I just read 'How the Dead Live' by Will Self and didn't much get on with it. In fact, I'm surprised I managed to force my way through to the end. I kind of like the concept of it, but Self's prose style grates with every sentence. It seems clear he is emulating his modernist heroes like James Joyce (even his protagonist's surname is 'Bloom'), but unlike Joyce, Self's impressive vocabulary and love of wordplay feels, to me at least, strained and contrived more than anything else.\n\nI'm a huge fan of Nabokov. Nabokov wrote in a bombastic style, with synaesthetic imagery, thesaurus-spanning lexis and peppered every sentence with punning wordplay. But whereas with Nabokov's writing I feel nothing but the warmth, humour and wit his erudite playfulness exudes, with Self all I feel is irritation. I guess the difference is that both men show how educated and talented they are, but only one of them, in my view, has a style that makes for good fiction.\n\nAlso I just couldn't stomach all the nastiness. I appreciate that the narrator in How the Dead Live is *meant* to be a ratty and aggressive old curmudgeon, but unlike something like The Catcher in the Rye or American Psycho I never really got the impression that Self was distancing himself from the views of his character. The cheap shots at everything and everyone became tiring without being given any sense that this constant hostility existed for any deeper narrative or thematic reason. It wore me down.\n\nThoughts?",

It is quite genius in the way it distills the English language into its purest, rawest form, sound, assonance, dissonance, rhythm, rhyme. Indeed, as well as being a fine piece of imaginative literature, ‘The Globgogabgalab’ also demonstrates a central principle of language: what linguists call productivity or open-endedness, namely the phenomenon whereby users of a language can endlessly create new words or phrases. As Noam Chomsky has shown, users of a language demonstrate an innate linguistic creativity from a young age, and this is how children are able to pick up a new language relatively quickly: they learn not simply by acquiring knowledge, but by using an in-built talent for spotting how words are put together to form meaningful utterances. It can be considered a form of satirical verse, even, prompting the reader to question the nature of language and meaning and how they are interlinked. We are able to discern the central thrust and sluggish, bloated nature of the Globgogabgalab even though we do not know the meanings of the words specifically. It is this that the genius of Franke as a linguistic master shines through.",

        "text": "It's only a few years after I became an avid reader of fiction. I never really disliked reading but only until recently I took and read books of fiction seriously. I even started going to a book club and realized that there were so many books out there that neither them nor me were really interested in going back on our readings. However, it's also true that people forget plots, forget stories, even book titles they've actually read.\n\nI guess you've heard or even believed that 'reading books make us better people' and phrases like those but if you pay attention to reading conducts across people they vary wildly from people who read classics to people who read YA novels or best sellers for a good plot. There are readers of all different kinds and every reason to read is valid but if what we want is to make the most out of our reading and learn about them and even become better people perhaps we should pay attention to the way in which we read. \n\nI don't know if this resounds in other people here but I was an evangelical Christian and I remember very well that they always encouraged reading the scriptures again and again, even the same passages (if you think about it churches like these they are like a book club that only reads one book) and the reasoning was something like: The Holy Spirit will enlighten your understanding and He will speak to you through it. Actually what happened was better described in philosophy, for instance by Kant when he talks about the subject and the object. We talk about a subject and an object but the object (the story) exists in relation to the subject (apart from its existence as an object in itself) so what we perceive is the relation to ourselves. When we read a book we do it from a perspective which is made up of our experiences, our previous knowledge, our current emotions, etc. and that's what we apply when we read a book or watch a movie because we experience objects through our subjectivity. So when we read a book when we are 12 or even in the past year it's not just a possible new experience, it's DEFINITELY a new experience. It's not just an experience, though. You can learn from a reread because you're not just \"reading\" you are reviewing yourself while you appropiate this foreign object: the story.\n\nThis becomes even more important in my view because currently reading many books is an encouraged achievement. (Think about Goodreads and booktubers and their \"hauls\"). It's true, there's a lot of really cool stuff out there yet to be read but there's a huge pressure over readers to consume books as a product. All in all, this is an industry and not a small one.  Also many of us have books in our shelves that are gathering dust and are left completely forgotten. I've had the chance to see some initiatives to share books that people don't read anymore. \n\nIn my presumably pretentious view there are at least two ways to read a book and they also depend on the book you're reading. One of them is experiencing the plot. The other one would be a slow read where you take care of the characters, the plot, the author's biography but also what relates to you. As I said it depends on the book, so for instance, when I'm reading a book I believe has some complexity I take notes and pay more attention. Other books I just read for fun. Still I think that good literature, even in 'lighter stories' should support a second read and even better if they deserve a deeper interpretation. based on what I said above, interpretation (maybe because of my upbringing) doesn't just mean getting to the author's intention but also feeling free to apply it to my own life if I find a pattern that I find useful or at least interesting to keep thinking about and that happens when I read more carefully. \n\nI'm aware of this [column on The Guardian against rereading](https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2007/jul/03/whyrereadingisacrime) and the people who use rereading to brag about their culture but it's not this what I mean. What I do believe is that we can read a book more than once and have a meaningful experience that even goes beyond knowing the ending. Loving books doesn't mean being subjected to the novelty and adding up titles.\n\n",

        "text": "Started it an hour ago and it’s blowing my mind. I’ve been in a real funk for a while and it’s seeming to blast me right out of it. I love with Miller how he can make you exult in life when you have nothing. Read Tropic of Cancer a few times and Black Spring and loved them; but this feels even more masterfully refined. Consider this passage:\n\n“To write, I meditated, must be an act devoid of will. The word, like the deep ocean current, has to float to the surface of its own impulse. A child has no need to write, he is innocent. A man writes to throw off the poison which he has accumulated because of his false way of life. He is trying to recapture his innocence, yet all he succeeds in doing (by writing) is to inoculate the world with a virus of his disillusionment. No man would set a word down on paper if he had the courage to live out what he believed in. His inspiration is deflected at the source. If it is a world of truth, beauty and magic that he desires to create, why does he put millions of words between himself and the reality of the world? Why does he defer action - unless it be that, like other men, what he really desires is power, fame, success. ‘Books are human actions in death,’ said Balzac. Yet, having perceived the truth, he deliberately surrenders the angel to the demon which possessed him.”\n\nI feel like this is one of those rare moments when something I needed to hear/see/experience came along at exactly the right time. Glad I started reading it.",
