Shouldn't it be opposite, like fair skinned people in equator, so that body absorb some sunlight and darker skin towards poles so that what little sunlight they get will be easily absorbed?\n\nSorry if this question feels dumb ^-^",

        "text": "The explanation I’ve always heard for both how hard drives and floppy disks (as well as other magnetic media), is that they write and store data by magnetizing small parts either North or South, and then are able to read the differences in magnetic polarity on the disk. To me it seems like both hard drives and floppy disks were working on extremely similar concepts and technology, however hard drives have always been able to store many orders of magnitude more data than any competing magnetic storage media. \n\nFor instance (according to Wikipedia) in 1987 the High Density floppy disk had 1.44MB of storage, while hard drives in the mid 1980’s (like the IBM 3380) had 2.52GB of storage, nearly 2000 times as much, for 2 things that are relatively similarly in size. \n\nWhat fundamentally distinguished these 2 types of magnetic data storage? \n\nIn my mind it either had to be the precision of the reader, or the “magnetic density” of the disk. If it was the former, why didn’t manufacturers just make floppy drives with readers/writers similar to hard drives? If it was the latter, why didn’t someone make a thick steel floppy disk that could hold 100X as much.  For that matter, why hasn’t anyone made a hard drive reader with interchangeable disks (like CD’s or floppy disks) thus allowing cheap, interchangeable terabyte storage? \n\nThese seem like relatively simple concepts, and I’m sure engineers would’ve implemented this at the time if they could’ve, so what am I missing? Essentially what EXACTLY distinguishes hard drive technology from floppy disk technology, and what factors led to the former being able to store 1000X as much data as the latter?",
