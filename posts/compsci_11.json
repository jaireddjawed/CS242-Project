(I feel like this could work in game dev but it seems a little primitive)\n\nProject 2: NFA generator, using a hashmap of a hashset we give the program a string of 0's and 1's with concatenations, union, star, and plus, to generate an NFA, then give it test strings to see whether they will be accepted in the NFA generated.\n\nProject 3: Creating 4 algorithms, inexact vertex cover, exact vertex cover, inexact independent set, and exact independent set, and for the algorithms of the inexact the nontrivial recommend solution was taking the set to test and removing one index testing if that set is a vertex cover and if it is then it will add the array index in then move to the next index (independent set is complement of vertex cover so similar logic applies to the inexact IS) which would work in O(n\\^2), and for the exact we would generate the powerset of the set given and test each set as a vertex cover and it works in O(n\\*2\\^n) and isn't largely usable above 20 or 30 nodes (30 nodes takes about \\~8 minutes). I asked the professor about what is usable from this project and he said the power set would probably be the only thing that is used for larger scale application.\n\nThe class is theoretical computer science so I guess these projects would deal with just proving the proofs in class but I'm wondering if any skills developed in these projects would help in real world application development?",

        "text": "I'm trying to learn a little bit about Predicate Transformer Semantics (PTS) as part of a quick exploration of [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3).\n\nI'm reading the [wikipedia's article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_transformer_semantics) about PTS and I have some doubt about the [first wlp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_transformer_semantics#Partial_Correctness) for the *while loop*, i.e. the one ignoring termination.\n\nFirst, I would replace the *if* in the formula with an *and* as I don't think the formula is syntactically correct the way it's written.\n\nSecond — this is my main doubt — I don't understand how we can be sure that the precondition, P,  given by that formula is still valid when we loop many times. Let's consider the forward direction: P makes sure that the INVariant is true, and that if the loop condition is true then, after we perform one iteration, the INVariant is still true. But how can we be sure that P is still valid for the next eventual iteration, though?\n\nI also found a more hands-on article about PTS. The author relies on Z3 and defines the statements as functions which return the associated wp functions. For instance, `if_(b&lt;a, stmt1, stmt2)` returns the function `lambda post_cond: wp(if b&lt;a then stmt1 else stmt2 end, post_cond)`. This way, by combining these statements, we can build the wp function for a whole algorithm. For instance:\n\n    def twosort(a,b):\n        if b &lt; a:\n            temp = a\n            a = b\n            b = temp\n        else:\n            pass\n        return a,b\n\nbecomes\n\n    a, b, temp = Ints(\"a b temp\")\n    prog = \\\n    if_(b &lt; a,\n        begin(\n             set_(temp,a),\n             set_(a, b),\n             set_(b, temp)\n             ),\n        skip\n       )\n\nHere's the important bit. The author implements the while loop as follows:\n\n    def while_(cond, inv, *body):\n        def res(post):\n            vs = list(get_vars(post))\n            return And( inv , \n            ForAll(vs, And( Implies( And(cond, inv), begin(*body)(inv))\n                            , Implies( And(Not(cond), inv), post) )))\n        return res\n\nThis seems to agree with wikipedia's formulation except for that `ForAll`. I suspect the reason we might need that `ForAll` is connected with my doubt... or maybe not?",

        "text": "Hello,\nI am new grad with a degree in bio and have taken CS related courses. Recently (3-4 months), I’ve been studying comp sci material for jobs. Essentially, I’ve been doing leetcode, learning some new technologies, and making projects. I’ve been applying for jobs (last 1-2 months) and have been getting a couple of interviews here and there, but I’m still waiting to hear back. I’m assuming I’m unable to get more interviews due to a lack of a cs or other related degree, the current job market, and the current time of year. I’ve talked to some people who have swe roles. Some have recommended to look into cs boot camps or a masters degree. But others have recommended to wait until Jan/Feb for hiring to pick up again. The issue I have with masters degree is that I would now have to wait until fall 2023 or spring 2024 to be admitted, but I know that with a masters degree I’d be able to easily get a job. And an issue I have with boot camps is that most of the material can be done by self learning. I feel like I could get a job around Jan/feb but I’m not exactly sure which route I should pick. Any advice on boot camps and masters degree would be helpful. And also just swe advice.\n\nThank you",

But since I’m only on my second semester of college, and only know C++, I don’t know what projects to include. The only projects I have are from my Computer Science lab class. An average project we usually make in that class is something like “create a linked list, and have the user enter some name, or number, and check if that name/number is in the linked list, and then name how many times that name occurs(if any)” Is a project like this too simplistic?

I have no idea of the feasibility of doing one remotely but after my masters I really want to do my own research on a specific type of software I want to make. However I would need to do it online. I'm comfortable with UK/US/Canada and Europe, NZ, Australia as well as potential places to study with. However I'm not even sure if doing a PhD online is possible or advised in computer science. It seems logical to me. My area of expertise is software development and nothing hardware or similar where I'd need access to a lab or any specialty hardware. But I know academia and at this level many argue for in person for various reasons, even though teams/zoom make meetings/attending lectures remotely very easy. \n\n\nSo any thoughts, suggestions, experiences are welcome. I'm really in the feeling out the situation phase. I know I love writing code and working on software, and I would really like to get a PhD, but where? And costs? What about grants etc? Really I just don't know where to start.",

Using logic gates make the adress decoder,draw it and determine the space which is occupied by the memory module.\n\nI dont necessarily need the solution but i just would like a website or a video where i can understand this better.

I give two different interpretations of this algorithm. One is based on Follow the regularized leader and the other is a kind of Bayesian update.\n\nI implement it for the case of two stocks.
