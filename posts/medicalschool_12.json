I was also accepted to a southern California T20. My SO wants me to attend the T20 and I also think I would be most happy living there for family reasons and because weather/outdoor hobbies are important to me. \n\nI am not interested in any extremely competitive specialties at the moment but I am interested in academic medicine. If I do receive financial aid that makes the T20 financially similar to my other acceptances I am leaning towards going there. I’m wondering if I am “giving up” a career opportunity by doing this?  As med school students I am wondering if any of you have perspective on this. Sorry if this post is tone deaf in any way but I feel like my viewpoint on all of this has been warped by the past 2 years of applications and internal/external pressure to go to the “best ranked” school (even though I know prestige and ranking are bs).",

I'm not sure how I end up in such scenarios, but I'm \"unintentionally\" the clown in the story, which is fine by me because that's quite hilarious in social life, but I'm so scared of what will happen in my future career.\n\nI'm happy with what I am honestly, but I'm afraid that my current self won't be enough for my future patients, and might end up messing things up.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n- What's the best specialty that might work out for me?? \"not too much stress/work-life balance/ not too competitive because I will be out of the competition the second their eyes land on my scores &lt;3\"\n\n- What are some things that I could do to improve myself as much as possible before graduation?\n\n- How can I make up for the lost knowledge in the past years? \n\n- I still haven't taken any of USMLEs exams yet, but I'm scared to do so, any tips?",

        "text": "Greetings everyone,\n\nI am a former data scientist/developer who recently embarked on a new journey by joining medical school. Despite transitioning into a new field, my passion for technology and data analytics never wavered. In particular, I have been captivated by GPT-3 and OpenAI.\n\nRecently, I undertook a project that involved collecting, cleaning, and wrangling a sizable medical dataset. I subsequently utilized the Davinci engine to explore the impact of finetuning on the dataset. The results were fascinating, as evidenced by the attached images:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Davinci engine finetuned with 170,000 Tokens. ](https://preview.redd.it/d5aj6qmb70ma1.png?width=942&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d27438d00a9215f9a3838863bed53c432b7f5bce)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Davinci engine fine-tuned with 17000 tokens. ](https://preview.redd.it/bd8lrl1y70ma1.png?width=813&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=eaeb0bf1086d4da8f9e778b6e984b13397e0a34c)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Davinci engine fine-tuned with 1500 tokens. ](https://preview.redd.it/i0zdifbb80ma1.png?width=1658&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=173ddfe1623a16c47c68ce091e9768edf313d4be)\n\nCurrently, my dataset consists of around 250,000 tokens, and I am in the process of gathering additional validated and clean data. After performing an appropriate randomization and validation process, the final model will be fine-tuned using a dataset of approximately 2.5 million tokens. This includes roughly 500,000 tokens from the original data, as well as an additional 2 million from randomized validation sets.\n\nIn light of these developments, I am curious to know whether anyone is aware of a grant or credit program that OpenAI offers to help offset the costs associated with finetuning. My ultimate aim is to employ this model in developing a medical application for students. If you have any suggestions or leads, I would be grateful to hear them.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.",

I like looking at imaging here and there, but I don't know how I'll feel about interpreting scans for the rest of my life lol. \n\n\\- I enjoy doing extensive procedures and radiology doesn't have many opportunities for that (unless I go do an IR fellowship, which I don't know how easy that is to do nowadays)\n\n\\- Lack of patient interaction. I enjoy talking to patients briefly, but not to the extent of specialties like family medicine.\n\nGeneral Surgery\n\nPros:\n\n\\- Again, I enjoy anatomy a lot\n\n\\- My surgery rotation was where I felt most engaged and I honestly enjoyed being in the OR.
