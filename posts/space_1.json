The narrator mentioned that this one particular megastructure engine which scoops a bit of material from the sun as its fuel, can actually extend Sun's life since it will reduce the Sun's mass therefore making it burn slower. Is that true? Doesn't that mean that we can actually extend any star's life if we're ever capable of building a megastructure that drains a star's mass sometime in the future?",

Antimatter spacecraft would be a massive leap. However, it does take a lot of energy to make. Assuming that antimatter containment is figured out, I have a plan right here.\n\n**Step 1: Capital,**\n\nAnybody involved in space exploration and physics would line up The key is that antimatter can be used a triggers for nuclear bombs, and could also power very fast planes. Thus, we get the militaries of the world to invest. Hopefully this would be enough money. The dam would also provide electricity to Alaska and Siberia, and bring massive investment to these places, which would \n\n**Step 2: Dam the Bering Strait,** \n\nA dam across the Bering Strait would be one of the few options of great enough scale to provide power to make it practical to produce antimatter on a commercial scale. It would hopefully provide vast amounts of electricity (I just guessed 0.5 terawatts )to power the particle accelerator. It would also provide power to Alaska and Siberia, and would be augmented by a 6 gigawatt nuclear power plant. I did some napkin math based on the cost of the Three Gorges Dam, and I estimate around 3 trillion dollars.\n\n**Step 3: Particle accelerator,**\n\nBuild a massive particle accelerator across Alaska. The cold and uninhabited environment would be a challenge. Whole new towns would have to be built to accommodate the workers.\n\n**Step 4: Enjoy,**\n\nNow with the whole thing built, we can get to the business of sending men to Pluto on torch ships. Hypersonic planes would also be powered by antimatter, as would nuclear bombs. The biggest barrier is cost. I just guessed 5 trillion dollars for the project. It would be owned by the UN, so no one nation could monopolize antimatter.",

        "text": "Yknow, going to the moon is a crazy achievement in its self. But, I had a dream the other night, one of those dreams you have and can remember the majority of it. I was on a ship travelling through space with people I didnt even know and randomly the ship stopped. I asked why it stopped and was told to come round a corner and look, the minute I got to that corner I woke up, as if I was never meant to know. \n\nNow this seems just like an ordinary dream at first, but when I woke up and reflected on it, it was quite deep. \nI realised that when it does come to outer space travel, we will never know if that person made it to their destination and for the person who's on that ship, they will always be risking never making their destination as like in my dream, if something went wrong, there's no where to go to get fixed. It's literally game over. \n\nScary thought is planning a trip to somewhere you cannot guarantee making and no one ever knowing if you made it. It would be like saying goodbye for the last time as depending where you're going and the how the space time is manipulated in that journey, you may never see that person again. Or if some rogue astroid or particle struck your ship, it could be the last thing you ever see. \n\nSpace is a terrifying place. Like beyond scary",
