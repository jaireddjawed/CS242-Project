        "text": "I recently got my eyes checked and it turns out I  have astigmatism. I went in to get a checkup after two years from another doctor who prescribed me glasses. I wasn’t a fan of wearing glasses and didn’t feel like I needed to wear them because I could still see fine, so I opted not to get them. However, this decision bit me in the ass because I can’t see as well anymore. Every time I look up I see a faint of blurred text and colours even on white surfaces. In lighted rooms or malls, the astigmatism gets triggered when I pass by people and stores. My astigmatism has triggered my migraines and vice versa, which leads to a constant cycle of misery and pain. I’m waiting to get my prescription glasses next week, which will take a couple weeks from there to get adjusted. The whole ordeal has costed me $450 between the appointment and prescription glasses (thanks to insurance it’ll cost me $150 in the end, so not as bad). \n\nThe lesson here is when your optometrist prescribes you glasses, don’t skip out on the advice even if you think you’re young, think glasses look bad on you, and can see mostly clearly. Also, wearing glasses makes you a better candidate for laser eye surgery years down the road. I thought I could just walk in and ask for one if my vision got really bad as was in my case, but that’s not how it works here (Canada). \n\nLastly, the two year rule is for insurance coverage so it doesn’t cost you a fortune, but everyone’s situation and insurance company is different, so read through your insurance policy and understand your financial situation to decide what’s right for you.",

I know that life can be so much harder that you can imagine but we have to take care our core. \n\nSome people will never appreciate us, all our efforts and generosity, they don’t appreciate us genuinely. \n\nSome people might secretly hates you because you have all the things that they don’t. Maybe you are very intellectually vocal yet they are silent and all they have to do is observe and play it safe. \n\nThey will talk behind your back until they created a pandemonium of false stories just to let them feel good and look good. Negative people need that negative energy to feed their insecurities and envy. \n\nAlways be careful to people who smiles at you yet stabs you at your back, be mindful of people coming into your circle. Be smart enough to set your boundaries to people whose very egocentric, presumptuous. People who only knows your existence when they need something in you. Address their attitude immediately and in that way you are giving them the superiority to know their limits. \n\nThere’s nothing wrong of setting your boundaries, it is very important for us to have that limit. Always set your mind with your goals and keep going, —Try not to care about other people’s comments, their judgements. Set yourself to achieve your dreams and give them your achievements.

For example, when I upgrade a camera or phone, I usually sell the old one (but if you keep it for a long time, it might not be worth reselling).\n\nWarranty - If something stops working or breaks and it's better to ship it in the original packaging. For example, a small appliance or a printer. Once the warranty is up, out with the box/packaging.\n\nTransportation - The original box/packaging protects and makes it safer/easier to transport. For example, if you move a TV or computer monitor to a new home (or somewhere else).\n\n\nEven if it fits into a category and you keep it, always go through them again in the future to make sure it still fits (if it fits it sits).\n\nObviously YMMV but it works for me.",
