        "text": "So I work at a larger 3rd-wave coffee company, and our beans use “service ranges” — corporate’s way of ensuring we wait until the beans adequately offgass before they go into service. However, my manager is not the best at ordering so we oftentimes end up having to use beans that aren’t in the “service range”, or offgassed enough to serve (at least according to company standard). \n\nSo the argument lays here: my store manager’s solution is to open the bags and let them sit open on the counter for hours before service in order to “speed up” the offgassing process. I strongly disagree with this practice and tell them I feel that the coffee already offgasses as fast as it can using the valve in the bag, at least without oxidizing. My stance is that it is probably better to serve coffee that is like 3 days off roast that was just opened, as opposed to coffee that is 3 days off roast but has also been exposed to oxygen which could have made it more stale tasting. \n\nObviously the best solution is for them to get better at ordering in the first place, but who would you say is in the right here?",

The results have been really good compared to Brita filtered tap water. However I have read there are benefits to adding a little bit of calcium in the mix too, but not too much, according to Johnathan Gagne. I have ordered some anhydrous Calcium Chloride and would like to make a similar concentrate to the ones Barista Hustle has on their website, but I can’t really find any information on how much of the Calcium Chloride to mix in with 1000ml deionized water to get a 1000ppm solution.

These processes can still give access to fruity, tasty beans at a much cheaper price, and for less risks of climate related quality issues on the farmers‘ side.\n\n\nWhats our opinions?",

        "text": "Like many of us, I watched James Hoffmann's recent videos on brewing a 1-cup v60, including the Q&amp;A in which he suggests preheatung ceramic v60s in the sink or upside down over your kettle as it heats. I'm definitely not comfortable setting my brewer in my kitchen sink, and my kettle isn't able to stably hold my v60 in the recommended upside down position. I wanted a better way to get the brewer properly preheated, so this morning I put it over the kettle right side up (as if I were brewing into the kettle), placed a small saucer that I rest the v60 on after brewing on top as a sort of makeshift lid to trap the steam. By the time my water was boiled and my coffee ground, the v60 was very well preheated, and I didn't have to boil and waste extra water to achieve this. Hope it helps if you, like me, have been struggling to find a way to preheat a ceramic v60 with a kettle that can't accommodate it upside down!",

In theory this is quite a straight forward present but the catch is that we are hoping to move house soon and will be going from a gas hob to induction. I’ve seen that Bialetti make an induction moka pot but the reviews are terrible. Is the better option to go with a gas one that will be induction compatible with an induction plate rather than buying induction specific? (I’m thinking long term if we had the induction hob, not just because we currently need something that works with gas). Also if I were to buy a 3-cup pot could that also be used for a single person? We drink coffee together and separately so ideally would like something that can be used for both but understand that might not be ideal. Sorry for the basic question, my areas of (moderate) knowledge are espresso and cafetière, the moka pot is unknown to me!",

Never seen or used a SMEG, but we are considering picking up a few of their products for the kitchen (based primarily on written reviews). Primarily because of SMEG sleek design, performance, and the ease of use (very simple buttons and levers, almost no annoying touchscreens).\n\nBut if these two grinders are similar, we may junk the whole idea and just get some basic, quality replacements for the kitchen, instead of the splurge (for example, just the coffee grinder alone is a \\~$450 swing, cost of new SMEG grinder plus disposing of kinda new OXO). Affordability isn’t the issue, but wasting dollars with no appreciable performance return is always top of mind.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/10h9i8e/question_about_ratios_coffee_grounds_to_water_in/",
        "text": "This has been bothering me a lot more than it should. Particularly as I'm fine tuning a couple of spreadsheets so I can quickly work out weights for pourover, Aeropress etc.\n\nWe obviously talk about ratios of coffee to water. Espresso may be 1:2 and pourover may be say 1:16. When we're talking about espresso, we're definitely talking about &lt;weight of coffee grounds&gt;:&lt;weight of coffee out&gt;. This makes sense as it's difficult for most people to tell how much water has gone in to an espresso. However when we're talking about pourover in all cases I've seen we're talking about &lt;weight of coffee grounds&gt;:&lt;weight of water IN&gt;. Hoffman's recipe for example (and I know it's not the only one, it's not the be-all and end-all) very specifically talks about measuring the total water in and working out the ratio based on that. However the we know, and Hoffman himself regularly mentions, that the coffee out will be less than water in, by approximately twice the weight of the grounds.\n\nThis makes a small but significant difference to calculations. So what is it? Do we simply calculate differently for espresso and pourover? In which case, where does Aeropress sit for example?\n\nApart from the principle, it's causing me pain because I like to have a spreadsheet (for pourover) where I can input a desired quantity out, and it will tell me how much coffee grounds I need, having selected my ratio. If we're treating it like espresso, this is easy:\n\na = volume of coffee out in ml (inputted by the user, i.e. me)\n\nb = ratio (i.e. 15, 16, 17, 18 etc, selected)\n\nc = grounds in, i.e. a/b\n\nd = water in, i.e. a + (2\\*c)\n\nThis works beautifully except it's not quite correct. In the case of pourover, with the large quantities involved, it doesn't make too much of a difference. But with an Aeropress, the difference becomes noticeable.\n\nI can't at the moment (although I'm sure I will do) work out a way to create the above spreadsheet where the ratio is calculated on the amount of water in (i.e. the correct way for pourover?), and I'm still able to input the desired coffee out. It may seem easy:\n\nc = d/b\n\nHowever d references c so it's a cyclical reference or whatever it's called. Anyone who can work this out for me would be saving me a lot of time and sweat!\n\nAll of this is confounded by the fact that I still don't *know* what the correct way of doing it is for pourover. Do we calculate the ration based on the water in, or by the coffee out?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n.....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs an addendum, I know it's not really about religiously sticking to ratios and recipes, it's all about starting from something fairly standard and working out what you like. And I know there are many, many other factors (grind, temperature immediately come to mind) which I haven't mentioned that make a huge difference. I do experiment, but if I make the perfect coffee I want to note down the ratio, and I want to be doing it properly.",

Before that, I was using a Bonavita drip coffee maker with a Baratza Encore, which has served me well for producing reasonably tasty coffee. Obviously, the general consensus is that the Encore is not sufficient for espresso, so I'm looking for a new grinder and primarily considering the Niche. My hope is that the Niche can replace my Encore as well for drip (one less appliance taking up counter space), but I've heard it can produce a high number of fines making it less suitable for drip/pour over. For someone who plans to primarily drink espresso and sometimes drip, would the Niche suffice for both jobs? How does the Encore compare to the Niche for drip? Is it an upgrade? Downgrade?",
