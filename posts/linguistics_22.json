        "text": "I have this name and found out it can mean a number of things in different languages as words. In Latvian it can mean \"hook\" which is a way also to represent \"hidden intentions\" (ƒÅƒ∑im m dative singular form of ƒÅƒ∑is, \"hook/occult intentions)\", but in Karamojong, it can mean \"Fire\", while in Turkish it can either mean \"Streamflow\" or \"Electrical current\" (akƒ±m) or even \"I am clean/white\" (Wikipedia Usage Notes: When this word is pronounced, the stress is on the last syllable: akƒ±m. The pronunciation with stress on the penultimate syllable, akƒ±m, means \"I am \\[a(n)/the\\] clean or white.\")  but is also an African denomination of the Akan people of Ghana naming one of their member or cities as \"Akim\" such as Akim Oda and Akim Swedru while for what I've searched Akan means \"Thousand People\" or something similar, but in Arabic, it means \"Ruler\" which correlates with Russian's meaning of the name signifying \"Established by God\", but is also a verb in old Norse correlated with Aka, which means \"To Drive (plural in the case of Akim), but in Kashmiri means ‡§Ö‡§ï‡§ø‡§Æ (akim, ‚Äúfirst (in a series)‚Äù), but in the Chuuk language of Tobi Island in Palau it means \"Rainbow\", and that's all I got.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat inspired me to write a poem about the meanings of my name, correlating Chuuk and Turkish to talk about Newton's discovery that all colors of the light spectrum (rainbow) form white, a rainbow born from the streamflow of a river's reflection after a storm with electrical currents, and along those margins walks a Ruler lighting a campfire after the storm, the first among his thousand people established by god, with hidden intentions to drive them all towards... Well, That's All I got from now, but I was wondering if I could find other possible meanings in other several languages or maybe get some help with the poetics of my name, but still, any help is appreciated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for your time and have a great day!",

Some people, including Stephen King ([http://www.people.ku.edu/\\~cmckit/TechComm/362/handouts/Stephen\\_King\\_on-Passive-Voice.pdf](http://www.people.ku.edu/~cmckit/TechComm/362/handouts/Stephen_King_on-Passive-Voice.pdf)) seem to have a very strong opinion about it and I could have never guessed how controversial it actually was. I, personnally, study how one can translate passive from English to French and how the passive voice can affect style in a novel. Do you know of writers who use it a lot, and do you think they use it because \"passive is safe\" to quote King, or for specific stylistic reasons?   \nI apologize if my question is not in the right sub, but I had no idea where else to ask it.   \nThank you so much in advance!",

        "text": "Do you have a question about language or linguistics? You‚Äôve come to the right subreddit! We welcome questions from people of all backgrounds and levels of experience in linguistics.\n\nThis is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.\n\n**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**\n\n* Beginner questions ‚Äî if you‚Äôre looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we‚Äôll ask you to move it here.\n\n* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search ‚Äî you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it‚Äôs sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.\n\n* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature ‚Äî unless it‚Äôs a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it‚Äôs a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.\n\n* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature ‚Äî remember to link to audio examples.\n\n* English dialect identification requests ‚Äî for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.\n\n* Questions about prescriptivism ‚Äî such as whether it's good or bad, when it's appropriate, whether something \"counts\" as prescriptivism, etc. These questions usually need the same general answers clarifying the role of descriptivism/prescriptivism in linguistics, so please post them here.\n\nWe‚Äôll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You‚Äôre free to post your question here.\n\nIf you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don‚Äôt get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it‚Äôs already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.\n\n**Discouraged Questions**\n\nThese types of questions are subject to removal:\n\n* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you‚Äôre not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.\n\n* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you‚Äôve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won‚Äôt come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.\n\n* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice ‚Äî basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.\n\n* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list ‚Äî follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",

terms peaked on the first half of the 1990s. That could represent the last peak in efforts to engage people in the middle, or even on the other side. Another group of more medicalized terms used by the \"pro\" side peaked in the aughts. That they are going down now corresponds with a decrease in reliance on medical authority and an increase in social media. The terms peaking recently, or still increasing represent attempts to rally others of the same side in a more polarized, less lukewarm social climate. Most writers today are using some terms which are falling in use. This could indicate an ongoing paradigm shift. Most people grew up with terms that are different than the ones being used now.\n\nThe most powerful, present-day upward spike is \"abortion pills\". \"Unborn child\" has the most consistent upwards momentum over the centuries.\n\nI used this paper for background information when looking into this: ‚ÄúI am not pro-abortion; I am pro-choice‚Äù: How euphemisms shape political discussions of abortion.

That could represent the last peak in efforts to engage people in the middle, or even on the other side. Another group of more medicalized terms used by the \"pro\" side peaked in the aughts. That they are going down now corresponds with a decrease in reliance on medical authority and an increase in social media. The terms peaking recently, or     \n\nmost writers today are using some terms which are falling in use. This could indicate an ongoing paradigm shift. The most powerful, present-day upward spike is \"abortion pills\". \"Unborn child\" has the most consistent upwards momentum over the centuries.",

Could it make a subbranch of its own like insular romance? Or would it be a peculiar version of Northern Galloromance, since (afaik) Gaulish and Brythonic were on the same subbranch of the Celtic family?  \nHonestly, \"new fundamental branch\" sounds fun but it'd probably be easier to do the other one.\n\nI'm obviously asking for opinions that, while necessarily highly speculative, reflect the degree of abandonment by Rome, the degree of connection to fellow \"left outs\", and start with the fantasy assumption of a higher latinisation of the common folk and an adoption of Latin as an official language by the Anglosaxons.",

        "text": "Something I've noticed when I'm speaking/thinking in english is that I basically never use the right third person singular pronouns. For reference, my first language is cantonese, which has no gender distinction whatsoever. I'd say that my english is already pretty good, but I've always struggled with this. \n\nThis also happens in written mandarin, where I use ‰ªñ (masculine) for everyone, instead of Â•π (feminine), Áâ† (neuter), ÂÆÉ (inanimate), or Á•Ç (higher powers, don't know the word for it). That's probably because they're pronounced the same in both cantonese and mandarin. (/t ∞aÀ•/)\n\nIn english, it's basically 33% each with he/him, she/her and they/them when I first start a conversation. But if I've consistently used one of them for the last minute or so, then no matter what pronouns the next person uses, I'll still use the same pronouns for them.\n\nSay I was referring to alice (she/her) in a conversation with catherine (while gendering Alice correctly). When I start talking about bob (he/him), it's almost guaranteed that I'll use she/her, because that's what I was using.\n\nI usually notice it almost immediately and correct myself when I use the wrong pronouns, but there are times where I realize that I'm about to use a pronoun, and I'll stop and think about which one I should use. This active correction takes a lot of brain power, and can take upwards of 5-10 seconds.\n\nIf I can judge what pronouns a person uses, then it typically becomes less of an issue. Although even if I know how they look of the top of my head, as long as I can't see them, it'll have no effect (like with my parents).\n\nI wonder if there are any papers studying this phenomenon?",

Latin, Polish, and Finnish are all highly inflected languages.*\n\nWhat does this mean exactly? Can anyone provide examples maybe for a better understanding? \n\nThanks in advance!",
