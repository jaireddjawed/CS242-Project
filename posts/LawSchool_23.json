We had an incredible amount of evidence in our favor.\n\nSince, I've learned that the Construction Arbitration Associates (CAA) business that handled our arbitration appointed an arbitrator that actually founded CAA and was its ceo for over 20yrs. We initially were told that he was from out of state etc. But we come to find out he lived and started the business in '82 in the same suburban city as our builder's home and work address since before the 80's. Only in recent years had he relocated out of state.\n\nWe were under the impression the appointed arbitrator was appointed and brought in from out of state so there would be clearly no bias or unfairness.\n\nBuilder was also allowed to break rules and pay retainer fee on the day of arbitration rather than about 30 days prior like we did in accordance with notice that said both parties had to pay by certain date. \n\nBuilder also paid final fees before award would be released about 6 weeks late. \n\nWould this constitute enough bias (clearly evidenced an overt favoritism toward one of the parties) for an appeal?\n\nThanks!",

Pros of staying are that it doesn’t seem to make sense to uproot my life only to have to move again in a year or two for law school, I’m familiar with the work environment/the job is relatively lax, and I’m passionate about the organization’s mission. The city I’m in also has a low COL, and the pay for this position is pretty on par with similar positions in higher COL cities, so it seems to make more financial sense too.\n\nBut I don’t have much of a support system in my college town, there’s not a whole lot of opportunity/ things to do here, and it’s not as diverse as I’d like—it’s also a painful reminder of my lonely college experience and I’d like a clean slate. wondering if it’s worth it to look elsewhere even though the job I’ve secured checks a lot of my boxes. I know everyone emphasizes making the most of your time before law school, and I’m not sure I can do that in my current city—but I also don’t want to pass up a good opportunity out of wanderlust.\n\nSo for those of you who took gaps years, where did you spend them, and what factored into your decision?",

I was considering looking at LLMs but now I assume they'd be super expensive and I don't feel that qualified.",

        "text": "Hi, \n\nSo broader context: I took a course and paid attention to it throughout when no one else in the class did. The prof liked me, and I genuinely enjoyed his teaching. When the time for the take-home exam came: I was anxious because although I had paid attention, I wanted to do well, and during that time I had other commitments as well. I plagiarized. The Prof found out. He didn't take any official action (although, he very well could have). He just called me and told me to not do it again in the future,  expressed disappointment (and surprise) that I would take this step because I had been doing well in the course throughout, and emphasized the importance of integrity in the professional world. \n\nNow, more context to me (and my problem): I had wanted to reach out to the prof regarding an opportunity that *only* he can help me provide. *I don't know whether I should still proceed with this given that my plagiarism has been detected.*\n\nNow I *need* that opportunity because it is an important step towards the career I would like to build. But, how would it look? Would it piss off the prof more, and make me appear entitled? If I am to do this at all, how should I address the plagiarism? Should I give up on this opportunity (and my future career plan) at all?\n\nMy take on what the prof thinks of me: I think that the professor still thinks I am smart and competent. I don't know what to make of him not resorting to official action.\n\nI am deeply and terribly confused over this. Any advice would be helpful.",

        "text": "This is not meant to be a brag. I was obliterated my first year. I was a B- average student, which landed me in the bottom middle of my class. I got my first Cs and I lost my scholarship. I knew I couldn’t quit because only being a doctor or lawyer would pay the student loans I already had, but I had no motivation and was dreading the next two years ahead.\n\nI had my first summer job, doing juvenile appellate work in the city I wanna practice in. I loved it, and re-fell in love with why I went to law school in the first place.\n\nI took a test and bar prep class last semester as a 2L. That professor saved my legal education, and put me on track to pass the bar. I made Deans List, top 10% of my class for the fall semester of 2022.\n\nNow I’m officially in my second half of law school, and I just got offered a Public Defender internship in a major California city - my ideal location for when I practice law. They had a large applicant pool, and even with criminal law being my worst grade of my life, they still gave me a chance.\n\nExtracurriculars matter, prior experiences even in undergrad matters, student leadership matters, and persevering when most people would’ve quit or dropped out matters. It’s more impressive to many employers to see you go from doing bad/average to killing it or even improving later on, than to see someone staying stagnant. I took hard classes last semester, and had a 4.11 GPA. You can absolutely improve, your 1L grades are only 1/3rd of your law school GPA and career. The bottom 90% of your class will still be lawyers. You will find a great and enjoyable summer internship, and you will have job prospects when you graduate law school. Promise.\n\nI know a lot of you might still be bummed by your fall 1L grades like I was. Don’t be. It’s your hardest year, but take a breather. Second year is more work, but more rewarding because you will know so much more than you did on your first go!\n\nGood luck to everyone in each phase of law school this year. It will get better AND easier as time goes on!",

Wanted to run it by some members of the community and get some opinions from people with more experience than me. Thanks in advance! \n\nSo I'm currently a 1L. I have an offer to work at a firm that sounds like it would be a really great opportunity (paid, thankfully). I also have the opportunity to intern for a judge doing legal research and writing which also sounds like a really amazing opportunity (but not paid, of course). I also have some more judges/firms that I'm waiting to hear back from but right now let's just assume these two positions. Here's a bit of my thought process: both places have told me that they are really flexible with the hours/days that I'd come in. Even the judge was offering 2-3 days a week before I even brought anything up! I'm thinking that I work with the judge in person two days a week and offer to do legal research and writing outside of it throughout the rest of the week/weekend. Then I go three days a week to the firm that pays. \n\nWhat would you do in this situation? Is it best to stick to one place five days a week? I have an internship for the spring semester and I Have it in my mind that by the end of my summer as a rising 2L, I'll have 3 really solid things on my resume that might give me a really big boost as opposed to my peers. \n\nI appreciate all your help!",

The truth is also that other students are adjusting how they are approaching exams with more serious motivation.\n\nNow, you likely won't trip and fall and do extremely bad, but you may plateau -- you might go from As to mostly Bs, and that is the difference between a 4.0 and closer to a 3.0.
