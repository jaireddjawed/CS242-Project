With that though, I feel like the same problems would end up arising anyway. Parents who care enough would take their kids to the ‚Äúnice schools‚Äù and then they would fill up. Then, once the nice schools are full, the only options left are the bad schools. \n\nIf they did it in a way that kids could test into the ‚Äúnice schools‚Äù, then the population wouldn‚Äôt change much anyways because those schools have the kids with supports at home who can afford a tutor and whose parents are involved. So they just test into their already nice school and the poor kids get stuck in lower schools anyways. \n\nI feel like what happens in any scenario I can think of is an education system with really high highs, and really low lows (even more so that we have now.)\n\nSo I guess what I‚Äôm asking is, how do vouchers create a system that is optimal for all students, or even a majority?",

That being said, I saw that as a Colombian I don't need a visa for the European union and most other LatAm countries, for example. \n\nBut I need a visa for some countries like South Africa, Afghanistan, Angola and other countries that are very far away from here and aren't precisely popular tourism destinations for us. I get we need visa for the United States or Canada for the proximity to us and they don't wanna be overflood with ilegal immigrants.\n\nSo I wonder how are visas selected between countries to make its citizens need them or not? Political reasons or the lack of them? i.e,Nicaragua only lets us stay for 30 days because some political tensions between us, but what about countries on the other side of the world?\n\nI don't pretend to cause a political debate or something like that here, wholeheartedly, I am genuinely curious.\n\nThank you.",

But I've been naked for hours on end, many times before, and I'm just fine. \n\nIt honestly seems more like a social thing (e.g. public nudity is a social taboo) than anything that is scientifically linked to survival.",

I mean the lottery can grow to billions with people just pitching in 2 dollars at a time in only a few months. Why can't we just pay a save the world tax on everything and it be like a $.5 charge?\n\n School taught me that the world is a delicate ecosystem and it seems like we've tipped the scale into a snowball effect of doom. Is civilization not in as much danger as it seems? Is funding recreational projects a cog in the machine to end up fixing everything? I don't understand why people don't pay more attention or care",
