        "text": "I am currently in the process of writing a philosophical essay in which this question is one of the premises, specifically regarding performance arts. As intuitive as it may initially seem, the more research and thinking I do regarding both concepts, the more confusing it gets.\n\nI read David Best's paper [Art and Sports](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3332478), where the author brings up the idea that no sport can be considered art, due to philosophical misconception between the *aesthetic* and the *artistic*. Yet, I find myself to be confused by their conclusion; why would an *aesthetic*, or even a *purposive* sport not have an element of contemplation or art? If one refuses to consider the immediate decision-making, rhythm, structure and prowess of a hockey team as contemplative or artistic, then one should not consider theatre troupes or orchestras as such. Indeed, both groups meditate on their practice, contemplate ways to extract a greater and more successful performance, examine and seek an understanding of every minor adjustment that could be made to adapt to unexpected situations. The final product attracts hoards of people seeking an Aristotelian *catharsis*, which is easily met in both practices, leading to an immense release of emotions from both the performers and the spectators, as well as discussion regarding performances. In many ways, the Olympics are a Dionysia for an alternate form of performance arts.\n\nI would be interested to learn about other users, philosophers and writers' stances on this subject, as, should my thesis be true, it still does not define either practice or classify them in any meaningful manner.\n\nLooking forward to reading your thoughts.",

        "text": "When I compare different bad things, it is not difficult for me to construct an ordinal hierarchy of badness. For example, here is a list of bad things:\n\n* Stealing a car\n* Murdering another human for no reason\n* Stealing a candy bar from a grocery store\n* Lying to a friend about why you can't come to their party\n* Spending $1,000 on a vacation instead of donating it to charity  \n* Committing an infidelity\n* Bullying the same defenseless person for years\n\nIf I were to rank these things from least bad to most bad, I would probably say something like:\n\n1. Spending $1,000 on a vacation instead of donating it to charity\n2. Lying to a friend about why you can't come to their party\n3. Stealing a candy bar from a grocery store\n4. Committing an infidelity\n5. Stealing a car\n6. Bullying the same defenseless person for years\n7. Murdering another human for no reason\n\nI have pretty strong intuitions about most of these. I asked two friends to rank these same items, and their rankings were almost exactly the same as mine. So it seems very tractable to me to come up with a somewhat agreed-upon hierarchy.\n\nAssigning numerical badness weights is more difficult. After a quick attempt, here's what I came up with:\n\n1. Spending $1,000 on a vacation... (1 bad)\n2. Lying to a friend... (2 bad)\n3. Stealing a candy bar... (10 bad)\n4. Committing an infidelity... (500 bad)\n5. Stealing a car... (2,000 bad)\n6. Bullying the same defenseless person for years (5,000 bad)\n7. Murdering another human for no reason (50,000 bad)\n\nI'm much less confident in these weights than I was in the ordering. However, I feel like, if I really worked at it, I could come up with some pretty good weights. For example, I could do surveys to identify areas of strong consensus. When possible, I could numerically assess harms (e.g. maybe a $20 theft is roughly twice as bad as a $10 theft). Then, I could quantify the difficult-to-quantify harms based on their ordinal placement between more-easily-quantified harms. I'm sure people could up with a million clever ways to make good progress on this problem.\n\nTo me, it would be really valuable to have an ethics dictionary, where I could look up a bad thing and see the relative badness. For instance, I could use this to audit my life, and identify the behaviors that I should invest the most energy in trying to change. Or it could be used to verify that criminal sentencing guidelines are proportional. Or it could be used to devise fair thresholds for who is undeserving of public respect (e.g. who should be cancelled).\n\nI can think of some objections to this. For some things, the badness is going to be dependent on context. Maybe there are certain classes of bad things, and you can't compare bad things across classes. For example, the relative badness of murder to stealing a candy bar might be infinite. Maybe this is all too uncertain to try to quantify.\n\nI agree that these are limitation, but I think they are easily-addressed. For example, you could make the master list of transgressions more granular, such that context can be specified in greater detail. Or you could include badness classes, and advise against running quantitative comparisons across classes.\n\nSo here's my question... has anybody made a systematic effort at creating a product like this? If so, can you point me to it? If not, why not?",

Hoping someone here can help. 🙂\n\nFrom my direct experience I feel comfortable with the notion that i see other people moving about the world and that i can have a conversation with another human and they appear to have thoughts and responses of their own. Whether these thoughts and responses they generate are seperate from me or not is not really the question. If i see a cat walk past, or hear a sound, or notice a thought, they are all arisings in my direct experience, coming out of Awareness and receding back into Awareness.....and most likely made of Awareness. The fabric of the direct experience is all the same thing regardless of what the arising is.\n\n\nMy sticking point is that I can only verify what i see through my individual point of view. The visual field i see looking through my eyes, the sounds i hear, the entire experience of existence or reality that i am witnessing as appearing to me as \"Jack\" is the only thing i am able to verify. I am unable to verify whether other humans have the same experience that I have of \"looking out\" at the world so to speak, or whether other people exist simply as arisings within \"Jacks\" experiential point of view. I suppose another way to frame it would be that if my experience of reality is a dream, are the people i interact with in the dream having their own individual experience of the dream from their individual point of view or are they more like Non Playable Characters (to use a video game term) who are appearing in my dream as an extension of me as the Dreamer.\n\n\nI hope that i am being clear with my line of thought but it is difficult to crystalize the concept. I feel that it is unverifiable because i cant experience anyone else's reality or know anothers thoughts\n\nBe great to get a discussion going on this topic. Thankyou",

No different than our BMI or Blood Sugar, no different than the reaction of baking soda and vinegar being an objective property, no different in nature only in level of complexity?\n\nBut then on a strict deterministic naturalist worldview would that not mean subjectivity itself is a myth, and in fact everything is objective?\n\nOr is there some key nuance to the concept I’m completely overlooking?",

This maximised utility is a number in my head, or someone else’s head. It is a result of a conceptual framework that spits out a number. In some cases, like gambling with money problems, it may be quite accurate. That doesn’t mean it is always, or even generally, reliable.\n\nMy idea of what is good, or has positive utility for me, may change over time. I may believe it is good for me to increase my opportunities to talk to a girl I like. Later on I may overhear her laughing with a friend about how desperate and lame I am. Now I will hate being around her, and avoid conversation with her as much as possible. I could argue that I followed decision theory principles but wound up more miserable than ever. \n\nI could strive all my life to gain entry to Heaven, but then discover for me, it is a type of Hell. Extreme example perhaps, but not contradictory with facts of nature. \n\nReally I am asking, what confidence should we have in the style of argument of Pascal’s Wager, or any argument that makes assertions about future happiness based on decision theory?",

In regard to Parmenides, the seeming/being distinction can be drawn between illusory sensory perception and how what-is really is. For Plato, it plays an important role in the theory of the forms. The seeming of things can be equated to the faulty sensory perception of the body, and the imperfect world of imitations of a higher more true reality, the realm of the forms. The realm of the forms represents the being of things, the way that things are. The forms are that which what we perceive are merely faulty and imperfect imitations of. Philosophers strive to get at the the truth and 'being' of things rather than the seeming, at least that is how I understand it.",

I'm not talking about heavy topics here racism or something, but things on a smaller scale like a habit of someone you don't like. You aren't going to their face to tell them to stop doing that because it bothers you, but I feel like simple accepting the fact that you don't like something about someone to yourself is much more liberating.\n\nSame thing happens with situation on a moral scale. Many people tell themselves and others that they care about other wordly problems like climate change, corruption etc. But in reality they don't even take small steps to combat it. People are selfish, as long as anything doesn't affect them they couldn't care less to take action, but to pretend to be the catalyst of justice according to me is just straight hypocrisy. \n\nHumans are imperfect beings with their flaws and feelings that not everyone might agree to, and to pretend that you are righteous and convincing you are a good person for something you barely care is just a consolation to yourself that you fit in the criteria for being a good person.",

        "text": "An interesting conversation I had with chat gpt, we must all stand up and unite if we truly want our freedom!\n\n.Why Does the government use divide-and-rule tactics to subdue the working class \n\nDivide-and-rule tactics refer to the strategy of dividing a group of people into smaller factions in order to prevent them from uniting and challenging those in power. Governments may use this tactic to weaken the power of working class people and maintain control over them. This can be done by pitting different groups of workers against each other based on factors such as race, ethnicity, religion, or gender, or by creating divisions within the working class based on skill level or job type. This can make it more difficult for workers to organize and advocate for better working conditions and wages, and can make them more reliant on the government for protection and support.\n\n\n.And why are people blind to this \n\nThere are a few reasons why people may be blind to the use of divide-and-rule tactics. One reason is that these tactics are often subtle and can be difficult to detect. They may be disguised as efforts to address legitimate differences or to promote diversity and inclusivity. \n\nAnother reason is that people may not be aware of the historical context in which these tactics have been used and the long-term effects they can have on society. They might be convinced that the status quo is the natural order of things and any attempt to unite and challenge it is an act of rebellion. \n\nAdditionally, media and propaganda may be used to shape public perception and obscure the real reasons behind certain policies or actions. People may be fed a certain narrative that aligns with the government's agenda and does not expose the divide and rule tactics. \n\nLastly, people may be more focused on their individual concerns and struggles, and may not see how these tactics are being used to keep them and their community in a weakened state. They may be too busy trying to make ends meet and may not have the time or resources to investigate and understand these issues.",

Or from a biological perspective, lovers need the dopamine, serotonin, and oxytocin from their partner.\n\nFor a parent-child relationship, the child seeks a domicile and life expenses; on the other hand, parents want to impose their unfulfilled dreams onto their children, or pessimistically, they simply raise their children as an \"old age ensurance\".\n\nThese are just the questions that have been haunting me for almost a year.

Especially in the past few years it seems, society (with good  and bad intentions, I think) seems to be moving in a direction that states that we have to consider, acknowledge and sometimes accept the subjective interpretations of reality that people have (this ofcourse is tied in with our rejection of collective subjective truths esp the harmful ones). My gut reaction is that this is noble and humanizing but dangerous. \nFor example someone could claim that they were abducted and abused by aliens in dead of night, there could be zero objective/material evidence to support this claim, but at the same time a psychologist might also conclude that such a person is in fact exhibiting behaviour patterns that are consistent with what a victim of abduction and abuse would show. \nIn handling this example, I’ve been coming across narratives that may argue that, since we cannot completely rule out the persons claims, we should meet them where they are, accept their understanding of reality and provide assistance. From a simple perspective of empathy, I can understand why someone would make this argument, but I also suspect that allowing a lie to fester only causes more suffering in the long run.\nInterpersonally, I think this would also cause more needless conflict as well.\nMy questions then are; \n\nIs it correct to say that truth telling is necessary for individual and societal health?\n\nSince we are all subjective individual observers, how is it fair to the individual that we require external consensus in order to validate their own experiences? Wouldn’t this just further perpetuate their internal suffering?\n\n(Also would really appreciate readings on and around this topic pls)",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/10a2iyg/is_the_coastline_paradox_also_true_of_ordinary/",
        "text": "As far as I understand, the coastline “paradox” (not really a paradox, but that’s what it’s called) basically says it’s difficult — perhaps impossible — to know how long a land mass’s coastline is because the answer depends on how fine-grained your metric is. If we use a rougher metric, a nation’s coastline might be, say, n miles long. But with a more fine-grained metric that better takes into account all the nooks and crannies of a jagged coastline (assuming we even know where ‘the edge’ of a coastline is at any level of specificity), the coastline may be significantly longer than n miles.\nMy question is this: isn’t a similar thing going to be true about measuring the perimeter of any object (of any size) with imperfect edges? And as far as I know, every physical object has imperfect edges — at least, at some fine-grained level. If we were to use an über fine-grained metric (i.e. a very small unit of distance) to measure the perimeter of such objects (where “fine-grained units of distance” might range from the molecular level to atomic level to subatomic level perhaps even down to the Planck length), wouldn’t we run into the same problem as we do measuring coastlines? If we take into account (or try to) all the “nooks and crannies” of the edges of a physical object (assuming we know where those edges are at the required level of fine-grainedness), then won’t the perimeter of a physical object depend on the metric we use? And on maximally fine-grained metrics (maybe using the Planck length for measurement), wouldn’t the perimeters of ordinary, every-day physical objects end up being massively (approaching infinitely) long?\n\nI tried to ask this in /AskScience but the question was removed. I was interested in their perspective because I figured, if I were to ask here, I’d mostly get epistemological answers. I’m interested not just in epistemological questions but also how a practicing scientist would be able to describe standard measurement practices and so on. Bud anyways, my question was removed there, so here we are. It would be great not to just get “how do we know anything, man?” or some such as an answer.",

If anyone has done anything like this, I want to see it!\n\nSome context on what I mean:\nThe idea is to start have a philosophical system as a starting point and 'improve' from there. The iterative process for improvement needs to be refined, but I do have some barebones ideas. I mentioned it would be democratic. If someone has a proposed amendment, they would submit their formal argument. The author of the original rule (or some sort of anonymous official) would then respond, and a philosophical debate would commence. The debate would be unlike today's democratic debates, and more like a game of correspondence chess. Several days could go by to ensure a proper philosophical response. After some time, voters could read the transcripts and choose a side. Ideally, votes are cast by independent and anonymous individuals, hopefully certified in logic in some way, but voting is meant to be accessible. It's clear this could all blow up way too fast, resulting in an always growing queue time, but amendments would still happen, and I would be very curious to see the direction the system would head In. \n\nIs this unique?

        "text": "This should get cleared up pretty quickly. Stambaugh's translation (or Schmidt's authorized edits, which are in the version that I'm reading) leaves all original Greek, with added context as footnotes, Heidegger's own given translation of the Greek text, *or* with only context clues to figure out the meaning. \n\nI'm not experienced nearly enough to read the Greek, and one particular context escapes me. The quotation in question is from \"Plato, *Sophist* 242c.\" I'm not going to write the Ancient Greek here, as I don't know very well how to write the characters on mobile. The quotation reads:\n\n&gt;What is *asked about* in the question to be elaborated is being, that which determines beings as beings, that in terms of which beings have always been understood no matter how they are discussed. The being of being \"is\" itself not a being. The first philosophical step in understanding the problem of being consists in avoiding the [Ancient Greek text], in not \"telling a story,\" that is, not determining beings as beings by tracing them back in the origins to another being - as if being [Sein] had the character of a possible being [Seienden]. As what is asked about, being thus requires its own kind of demonstration which is essentially different from the discovery of beings. Hence what is to be *ascertained*, the meaning of being, will require its own conceptualization, which again is essentially distinct from the concepts in which beings receive their determination of meaning.\n\n(Note: all is transcribed exactly as in the text except for the Ancient Greek text)\n\nOne more part:\n\n&gt;Insofar as being constitutes what is asked about, and insofar as being means the being of being, beings themselves turn out to be what is *interrogated* in the question of being. But if they are to exhibit the characteristics of their being without falsification they must for their part have become accessible in advance as they are in themselves. The question of being demands that the right access to beings be gained and secured in advance with regard to what it interrogates. But we call many things \"existent\" [\"seiend\"], and in different senses. Everything we talk about, mean, and are related to is existent [seiend] in one way or another. What and how we ourselves are is also existent. Being [Sein] is found in thatness and whatness, reality, the objective presence of things [Vorhandenheit], subsistence, validity, existence [Dasein], and in the \"there is\" [\"es gibt\"]. In *which* being is the meaning of being to be found; from which being is the disclosure of being to get its start? Is the starting point arbitrary, or does a certain being have priority in the elaboration in the elaboration of the question of being? Which is the exemplary being [Seiende] and in what sense does it have priority?\n\n(pp. 5-6, *Being and Time*)\n\nMy question: what's the importance and meaning of the part about telling a story? As in, he seems to suggest that the discussion of being must always be done in some way with relation to beings, which exist in objective reality. He then goes on to say that there is maybe a central being, so to speak, which is the origin of beings? Maybe?\n\nBut the first part separated out into distinct phrases gives me these sentences: \n\nThe first philosophical step in understanding the problem of being consists... in not \"telling a story,\" \n\nThe first philosophical step in understanding the problem of being consists in not determining beings as beings by tracing them back in the origins to another being - as if being [Sein] had the character of a possible being [Seienden].\n\nIn the forward, the translators hint at some sort of incompletely fulfilled goal, as if (to co opt Derrida here) Heidegger tried, and failed, to establish being as the stable center toward which his philosophy points. I'm not sure if this is what they were referring to in particular, but in previous passages Heidegger also maintains the separateness between beings and being, that in some way beings seem to belong to being or vice-versa, but that being itself needs to be discussed in some forgotten way (and that we've even forgotten about forgetting about being, further obfuscating the answer to the question of being). \n\nIt seems to be problematic according to the second paragraph - I think he means there that to discuss being we must discuss the beings that are (that be); and, that the discussion of *anything,* philosophical or not, must refer to beings. I'm guessing this is, or is exemplified, by a language problem where the discussion must be about real things that exist, as language regarding purely abstract ideas always-already requires some sort of reference to things like trees, oceans, or cheese, that can be felt - what are essentially nouns referring to physical objects.\n\nSo is this like a linguistic double bind? As in, Heidegger from the outset is suggesting that pure abstraction is not going to be enough for illuminating what he wishes to illuminate (or problematizing what he wishes to problematize), but that he must refer somehow to things without simply using them to tell a history about those objects?\n\nThis might be clearer later on, I mean this is in the introduction. But here I'm very interested in understanding at least some of his method in order to more fully comprehend the book. Thank you!",

In the last couple of month's I've been trying to get my shit together and fix my life somewhat. (fitness, trying to be more social, health etc.)\n\nI've been hitting the more political side of YouTube recently and in turn some philosophical channels and it's got me really thinking about ethics and morality and how the world works somewhat. Learning the massive amount of exploitation that happens all around us, to people and in what we engage in really kind of angered and upset me. I've been really empathizing with the less privileged and fortunate as of late.\n\nSo for the last week or so I've just been ruminating and exploring and trying to rummage through my brain about how to live ethically in modern society and I can't really seem to find a satisfying answer. It's gotten so bad I've basically stopped doing anything and i'm just stuck in my head all day and night trying to go through every action and trying to figure out whats ethically right or not. But at the same knowing I enjoy some of the fruits that come from that exploitation (gaming/tech/cars/clothes etc.). Same thing when it comes to money, I'm not that interested in amassing wealth and money isn't an obsession of mine at all, but I enjoy spending money on things every now and then on myself and tend to feel shame and a sense of wrongness when I do even though I live pretty frugally . I've also wanted to return to school to get a degree and choose a career path for myself, (I didn't continue my education after high school) but this also has got me thinking on what careers are ethical or if any are at all. How are you meant to live ethically in a system that's whole design is unethical. And this question of ethics carries on over to every little thing and it's just overbearing.\n\nI feel like I'm frozen in place and stuck and just exhausted from trying to figure this out and have just continued my life on auto-pilot at the moment while dealing with this mental strain. \n\nI guess i'm seeking some guidance on how you guys dealt with this. Or offer a different perspective on the subject or some philosophers works that I can read that might help on dealing with this ethical overload. 😔",

Utilitarianism says that one should act in a way that generates the most good for the most people, i.e. so that their actions maximize societal utility. Most people find this statement sensible. But what is the basis for it?  \nTo me it seems clearly wrong. The answer to the question A. is that they should act in a way as to maximize utility over their personal preferences, not societal preferences. Why should they care about maximizing utility over societal preferences? To me conceptually this seems to be similar as saying that the answer to question A. is that one should act in a way as to maximize the number of blue houses in the world. Why should we care about maximizing number of blue houses in the world? **What we do care in life is our preference.** Acting in a way as to maximize utility over personal preference therefore makes sense. Of course, due to evolution, because humans are hyper social creatures, it so happens that near at the top of our preferences is societal utility, we happen to really dislike other people suffering. But the notion that we should act in a way that is better for everyone then arises not because it is relevant in itself to act in a way that is better for everyone, but because we like acting in a way that is better for everyone. If we were aliens, which were completely asocial, born alone, die alone never see other creatures, they could have preference where they care about minimizing other people's suffering as much as they care about max the number of blue houses in the world. If maximizing societal utility is irrelevant to their preferences why should they act in a way as to maximize it? It seems that the way they should act is so as to maximize utility over their own preferences.",

Their father asks you \"did \\[son\\] drink alcohol last night?\"\n\nBecause, using the universal principle formulation of the categorical imperative, there is a perfect duty to not break promises as it leads to a contradiction in conception, and there is also a perfect duty to not lie as it also leads to a contradiction in conception, it seems to me that this is an example of unavoidably clashing duties, so what would Kant say that a moral agent should do in this dilemma?",
