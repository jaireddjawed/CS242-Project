        "text": "I’ve been with a man for almost a decade and I’m scared shitless that this man is gay. This wasn’t always a concern but over the last 2 years I believe the signs are undeniable but I’m not coming to terms with it. Back in 2021 shortly after our 3rd child was born my partners alcoholism became worse and more out of control. (SB)My partner always battled with his addiction to alcohol, but I stood by him because I understand his troubled childhood, lack of discipline , and one of his parents were gravely I’ll and was in need of a kidney transplant (received in 2019)\nNevertheless, my fiancé became friends with an older man (which he didn’t know was gay) who I believed was grooming him to attempt to make a pass on him, the older guy would buy him weed, beer, food etc and they would communicate/ hang out at all hours of the night. My partner disappeared from home, my instincts told me he was with the older gentlemen so I reached out and my partner told the old man to lie and say he hasn’t seen him. One day I tracked his phone and found the two of them parked on a dark block near center city, and my partner had baby oil in his pocket! I was devastated. My partner explained that he had a hotel that he stayed in, alone, and that the older guy would just bring him weed and liquor and that he had the baby oil because he was “ashy”. I begged him to come home that night but he refused and didn’t get dropped off until sun up that morning. He was with this man for about a week, joy riding and drinking. And even took my child to his home and turned his phone off so I couldn’t find them! \n\nThe second situation was when I woke up in march of 2022,  to find my partner passed out of the floor. There was a solo video of a man pleasuring himself on my partners phone and when in questioned him about it, he said he fell asleep and the videos must of continued playing and that I just so happened to see his phone with that video on it. - I believed him.\n\nThe third incident was recent maybe just a few weeks ago, he was watching a porn video that he typed into the search engine “solo huge nut”. With a man masturbating. He broke down in tears and said he was weird. His explanation for this was he like to pretend that person is ejaculating on ME! That he puts two phones next to eachother and pretends to watch me having sex with these men. !!!! My partner doesn’t give me gay vibes and the family I’ve talked to about this with, doubts he’s gay as well. I just can’t get past these different situations. Every after I told my partner I knew the older man was gay and to stay away from him because I believe he’s grooming him he still continued to hang with this man (we had proof the man was gay) what do I do? And how do I get him to confess his sexuality! I’ve asked him directly about his sexual orientation and he’s been clear that he’s not gay but I just CANT BELIVE him. I’m scared Angry and upset. We have 4 kids and this man has taken my choices from me. I never wanted children by a gay man. He says hes madly in love with me and behaves as such! WHAT DO I DO!?",

I couldn’t remember my dreams, if I had any; I only remembered darkness, an empty place I couldn’t wake from until the sun broke the horizon.\n\nI was even sent home from work a few days ago because I couldn’t focus. I kept forgetting things. I hadn’t been back since. \n\nAll of this, including the headache, I would’ve blamed on stress. The brain is powerful, and when your mental health depletes, in a way, your body sort of gives up. So yeah, I would’ve pointed a finger at stress and told the police to book them and read them their rights, that was until I noticed my reflection move out of the corner of my eye.\n\nIt was a few nights ago. I was brushing my teeth, and when I went to spit out the mouthwash, I caught a glimpse of my reflection holding steady as if I was still just staring at the mirror rather than bending over. I didn’t believe it at first, of course. I figured I was delirious from lack of sleep and from the terrible headache. But as I went to leave the bathroom, there was no denying it.\n\nThe person in the mirror didn’t match my movements and, instead, only turned their head to watch me leave.\n\nI tried to ignore it; however, the unsettling feeling enveloping me had me spinning around to catch the reflection in the act.\n\nThere it was. Moving with me. Doing everything I did. Being everything a reflection should be.\n\nAfter that encounter, I thought I understood the book a little more.\n\n*It searches for a being to call its own*\n\n*You’re lost in a land you can’t escape.*\n\n*A reflection that walks without a mirror.*\n\n*It isn’t you, and yet, it is.*\n\nOr maybe I was just making assumptions based on a horror story.\n\nWhatever it was, I felt the shadow’s hold on me. It whispered to me, murmurs only audible to my ears. What did it say? I didn’t know. It just sounded like noise.\n\nIt didn’t want me. It wanted *to be me*. It needed a vessel. I was trying my best to keep it at bay, using my resilience to overpower its will. But I felt weaker every day, and the weaker I became, the nearer it trod.\n\nEverything got to me. It was 2:30 a.m. I laid in bed, blank gaze fixed on the ceiling, the murmurs like static in my ears, drowning out all other sounds, silencing every one of my thoughts. It was too much. I clutched the bed sheets, clenched my eyes shut, ground my teeth—*anything to make it stop!*\n\nMy hands flew to my head, nails digging into my scalp.\n\n*Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!*\n\nThe static loudened.\n\nThe growl seeping out between my lips drew to nearly a yell of frustration—desperation—only for the quiet, melodic tune of my ringtone to stop it.\n\nI glanced over to my nightstand, at my phone whose black screen displayed ‘Unknown Caller,” and wearily reached for it.\n\n*Who’d be calling this early in the morning?*\n\nWhen I answered, the word “hello” barely left my mouth before the person on the other end started to talk.\n\n*“You let it in, and you let it get too close.”*\n\nThe monotone voice came through the receiver. It was deep and hoarse, but, in a strange way, it was familiar.\n\nI sat up. “What? Who is this?”\n\n*“You don’t know me by name.”*\n\n“But I know you?”\n\nThere was a pause. *“You don’t have much longer.”*\n\nMy brow furrowed. “What do you mean? What’re you talking about?”\n\n*“The book.”*\n\nThe phone nearly fell from my hand as I stiffened. “You know about the book?”\n\n*“Know about it?”* They laughed. *“I wrote it.”*\n\n“What sort of sick game are you playing?”\n\n*“This ain’t no game, kid”—*I knew this voice; how did I know this voice?—*“This is life or death, and if you don’t take it seriously, you’ll have more than the monster under your bed to worry about.”*\n\nIt was my turn to laugh—scoff, really. “You’re insane. Monsters aren’t real.”\n\nThey hummed. *“I bet that’s what you told yourself the night your sister died.”*\n\nMy stomach plummeted. There was a terribly apparent hitch in my voice as I said, “What? Alana—She’s…My sister *isn’t dead*. Who the hell are you?”\n\n*“I’m the one who gave you that necklace. The one sitting in your side table drawer.”*\n\nMy head jolted toward the nightstand. There was a soft *thump* as the phone hit the comforter, followed by sheets raking backward as I scrambled for it.\n\n*Necklace? What necklace? What were they talking about?*\n\nI opened the drawer and was greeted with dozens of envelopes, pens, scrap paper, sticky notes, and whatever else I tossed in there from time to time. I pushed it all aside, dug through the pile of miscellaneous items until, at last, I came upon something hidden underneath it all, something that I could’ve put there ages ago or just yesterday; I couldn’t remember.\n\nA wire pendant in the shape of three spirals dangling from a back thread.\n\nI picked it up, looked it over, glided my finger over the curved lines, something poking at the forefront of my brain, demanding to be center. It almost felt like I should’ve known what it meant. \n\nThere was a time when I never took the necklace off. That knowledge was etched into my memory like scratch marks on slate. I slept with it, wore it everywhere I went. I had to; I had no other choice.\n\nI just didn’t know why.\n\nIt was something I found in the woods when I was a child. Alana and I were playing. We went too far…The necklace was…I had found it in the grass in a clearing. I swore I found it.\n\nA vision flashed in my mind—a woman with red, braided hair wearing black clothes. The image spun. I couldn’t concentrate. She was tall, or was I short? She handed me something, told me it would…save her life?\n\nI looked around. It was night, but everything was bathed in moonlight. A young girl was across the way, admiring boulders. She said something to me. What did she say?\n\nIt went quiet…\n\nSomething rustled in the brush.\n\nFrom the darkness crept antlers, and with them was the skull of a deer, empty eye sockets staring at me with the intent to kill.\n\n*Monsters aren’t real.*\n\nMy mouth went dry. My skin went cold.\n\nThe fur-covered beast stood crooked on hooved feet, its arms bundled at its chest, its head twisting like a wrench.\n\n*Monsters aren’t real! They aren’t!*\n\nIt made a cautious approach toward a young, scared, and helpless girl before bearing down its claws.\n\n*Monsters…aren’t…*\n\nThe creature was right in front of me, its warm breath against my skin, but in the blink of an eye, it dropped dead, and the girl was lying in the grass. I ran to her, fell to my knees beside her.\n\nWhy? Who was she?\n\nShe was covered in blood, coughing, gasping. I was terrified. I didn’t know what to do. She was dying. The girl…The girl was…\n\nHer brown eyes dulled, and the rise and fall of her chest slowed.\n\n*Alana?*\n\nThere was a quick *clack* when the necklace hit the nightstand.\n\nThe voice over the phone mumbled, but between it being facedown and buried in bed clothes, I didn’t hear a word.\n\nOnce I found it, a shaky grip brought it to my ear. “What,” I stuttered. “What did you say?” My gaze didn’t leave the necklace.\n\n*“I said, ‘Are you done with your life crisis?’ You have a cryptid in your damn house, and it’s trying to kill you.”*\n\n“A cryptid?”\n\nThey sighed. *“Listen, kid. I’ve been tracking this thing for weeks, and I’ll be damned if I let it get away again.”*\n\nI swallowed hard, eyes darting to the space between the door and the floor, awaiting the footfalls that belonged to no one but creaked outside my room night after night. “And what is *it* exactly?”\n\n*“A doppelgänger.”*\n\nI took a deep, yet quivering breath, calculating my next words, wondering if I even believed this stranger. It was like a campfire story, a tale the older kids told to get a few gasps and screams from the younger crowd. How could anyone, in their right mind, believe in a campfire story? “So, let me get this straight. You wrote a book that releases a—” The word caught on my tongue, stung it like a wasp—“*monster*, and you gave that book to me for, what, fun? Kicks? What is this?”\n\n“For someone who has no idea what they’re talking about, you sure talk a lot. Just keep your mouth shut for a second, yeah?”\n\nI took the liberty of scowling during the lull in the conversation, tempted to hang up then and there, but I was equally tempted to hear them out because, well, I couldn’t deny the inexplicable things happening to me—the noises, the apparitions, my dog’s sudden cowardice. So, I waited for their explanation, thinking maybe, maybe it’d make some ounce of sense.\n\n“First of all,” they started, “I didn’t *give you* the damn book. It manifests wherever it’s needed, and you obviously didn’t heed its warning.”\n\n“Excuse me—”\n\n“Second of all,” she continued, louder and more enunciated in an attempt to quiet my interruption, “I wrote it to *warn people—*again, a warning you ignored—so the cryptid would remain powerless. It gains power through its victims. And lastly,” they paused. “Actually, that’s pretty much it. From the amount of dark energy around you, the cryptid is a little too close for comfort. How long haven’t you been able to sleep?”\n\nI didn’t answer right away. A strangled noise came from my throat, and I just didn’t know what to say. It was like something came crashing down on me then, or something I was too afraid to let in began suffocating me from the inside out. What this person was saying…\n\nMonsters are real?\n\nA child’s laughter arose in the back of my mind but soon devolved into whimpers.\n\n*I think we should go, Alana.*\n\n*They’re just rocks.*\n\n*Run, Alana! Run!*\n\n*My sister coughed up blood at my feet. I was crying. I felt helpless. The woman…She handed me the necklace. She said…She said…*\n\n*Every night, you’ll give a little of your life essence to her in order to keep her alive. During the ritual, however, you’ll be dead for sixty seconds.*\n\nI took the phone from my ear and looked at the time.\n\nThe hour struck 3 a.m., and when I glanced away from the screen, I was no longer in my bedroom. Darkness had swallowed me, fog slithering past like its entrails. I began to walk, overcome with a feeling of horrific familiarity.\n\n“Hello?”\n\nMy echo called back.\n\nIt felt like I wandered through the nothingness for hours, an endless void of black and fog and dead grass beneath my steps. And the longer it went on, the more that familiar feeling gripped my memory.\n\nI knew this place. I visited it every night. What I thought was a vague dream during the little amount of sleep I got was this…This place…\n\n*Nowhere Land.*\n\nAs the name faded, my eyes snapped open, and I was back in my room in my bed, holding the phone in front of me.\n\nThe time sat in the left corner of the screen.\n\n3:01 a.m.\n\nEverything became quiet. My face felt long with a frown whose quivering lip needed to be bitten as if to fend off the sorrow and grief. But tears welled up in my eyes anyway, and without a second thought, the emotions bursting from me continued through the floodgates in the form of a single sentence, a sentence that sounded irrefutably insane even unspoken, a sentence I never thought I’d ever say but was undeniably true.\n\n[“My sister died.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10cndzj/every_morning_at_3_am_i_die_to_save_my_sisters/) Every word was like a shard of glass shattering against an unforgiving force. “She really died, and I…”\n\n*“You saved her,”* the person—that same woman who handed me the tool necessary to sacrifice myself for my sister—finished what I was still too irresolute to say. *“What you saw that night as a child was real, and what you’re experiencing now is real. If you don’t do exactly what I tell you, the doppelgänger* will *consume you.”*\n\nI wiped the blurriness from my vision and the dampness from my cheeks, failing to keep my composure but refusing to stop trying. The breath I took was calming, near-steady; I closed my eyes to take it all in.\n\nWhen I opened them, undoubtedly uncertain what’d happen next, I said, with as much conviction as I could muster while on the verge of a total breakdown, “Tell me what I have to do.”",

        "text": "  \n\nI never thought it would end like this. My truck’s windows smashed, blood all over the interior, the frigid wind and snow blowing in on me as those two empty eyes stared in at me like a predator sizing up a helpless animal for the kill.\n\nIt didn’t start out like that, of course. \n\nWhen I started out for my morning run, it wasn’t snowing. There was snow on the ground. There had been a quick storm with some squalls that left half a foot of the white stuff on the roads just a few days earlier. \n\nThe state took care of it pretty quickly, and travel was barely interrupted. Everyone went about their merry way. Even me. The fact that I hated winter even more than driving a truck never entered my mind. Ok, that was a lie. \n\nAs I drove down the road I found myself looking at the small piles of snow along the roadside and cursing them for not being big enough to cancel my run. I had to drive my truck through some pretty empty places. The kind that made you long for anything to break up the monotony of two lanes of asphalt surrounded by endless trees. \n\nI had to drive that route quite often and it never got any easier to stay awake. I would even imagine seeing odd things looking out of the trees as I flew by. I knew it was my mind playing tricks on me, trying to scare me into staying alert and not crashing the truck. If it had been a deer or bear or something like that, I would’ve just laughed it off, but this thing looked like it was out of some nightmare. That’s how I knew it wasn’t real. There was no way it could exist, so I put it out of my mind and kept on driving.\n\nFortunately, with it being a two-day run, I was able to pick where I wanted to stay after I got my load. Hotels were nice, but if needed I had the sleeper in my cab, which I called home away from home. It wasn’t bad as cramped spaces go. There was lots of shelf space above the bunk. I had a TV mounted on the wall hooked up to a GameCube. There was a DVD player with an assortment of movies that I rotated out on a weekly basis. And there were some paperback books. Lord of the Rings, Frankenstein, This Present Darkness, along with all the indie author books I had on my phone. I didn’t have to worry about being bored. There was always my laptop that held the novels I’d started writing and never finished.\n\nThe only thing I really needed was food and a bathroom. I had snacks stashed around, sometimes in places, even I didn’t find for months. But it couldn’t compare to a nice hot meal. \n\nI had my favorite stops on the road, and they all had two things in common, good food and a quiet place to park and sleep. I didn’t like having my truck squashed up against other trucks, wondering if I would be able to get my door open if they parked like an idiot. I liked parking near the outskirts of a parking lot. It was more private, and I didn’t feel as hemmed in. \n\nOf course, there was a tradeoff. More privacy meant walking further to get to the truck stop. Sometimes a lot further. But I used that to my advantage. Nothing like a nice long walk to get the blood flowing to all those muscles I didn’t use when driving.\n\nUnfortunately, the place was a local mom-and-pop operation. Which meant they didn’t have the money to stay open twenty-four hours a day. Usually, I would pull my truck into my spot in the evening, go get supper at the lunch counter, then grab supplies for the night. I’d always go inside one last time to use the restroom just before they closed at midnight.\n\nThat evening, I followed the same pattern. Pulled in, walked to the store, got some supper, and went back in around eleven-thirty for restroom and supplies before going back to my truck and falling asleep.\n\nNormally I try to keep a good watch on upcoming weather. For whatever reason, I hadn’t that day. I woke up around eight AM and looked out to a sea of white. \n\nIt had snowed, and it had snowed hard. It looked like someone wanted to make up for the snow quota this winter and did it all in eight hours. \n\nI dressed in my cold weather gear and went out to see how bad it was and if my truck would be going anywhere today. \n\nWhen I jumped out of the cab, my legs disappeared. There was at least two feet of snow on the ground and it was still putting it down. I trudged around the truck to make sure everything was ok, then got back in the cab, brushing off as much snow as I could first.\n\nI climbed into the bunk and turned on the news to the announcement that a major blizzard had hit the area.\n\n‘Wow,’ I thought. ‘That’s some great investigative reporting right there.’\n\nThey were calling for another foot before the snow stopped. \n\n‘Great, time to call the boss and get my ear chewed off.’\n\n“Why can’t you get here?” he growled.\n\n“There’s this stuff called snow,” I said. “It lands on the ground and piles up until it begins to impede travel.”\n\n“Alright smartass, when do you think you can be here?”\n\n“Well, seeing that I haven’t even seen a snowplow go by and I’m sitting in a parking lot that probably won’t get plowed out until much later than the highways, on top of the fact that my tires are nearly bald even though I’ve been telling you for months they needed changed, I’ll say I have no earthly clue when you’ll see your precious cargo.”\n\nHe was silent for a long moment.\n\n“Do you like your job?” he said through barely restrained fury.\n\n“Not particularly,” I said. Then added, “When the weather’s like this.”\n\n“You might want to update your resume’.”\n\nWith that, the line went dead.\n\n“Thank you for your support,” I said to the dial tone.\n\nI settled back in, turned off the TV, and went back to sleep. When I first started out in trucking a fellow driver gave me a tip that I never forgot. \n\n“Anytime you have the chance to get some rest, take it.”\n\nThat little tidbit helped me tremendously over the years. I little extra sleep means a lot less coffee.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWhen I woke a few hours later and peeked outside, it was still snowing. I looked out my driver’s side window and even my tracks were gone. I was feeling the call of nature and decided to brave the elements to take the trek to the truck stop for some relief.\n\nI felt a little silly for putting on all my cold-weather gear including gloves and goggles.\n\nThat feeling didn’t last long. It was snowing so hard I couldn’t even see the truck stop. I drew an invisible line with the side of my truck, aimed in that direction, and started walking. \n\nI never read ‘Call of the Wild’. I never saw ‘Alive’. Maybe if I had, I wouldn’t have been so eager to throw myself out into this blizzard just to go pee.\n\nTrudging through the snow in the driving wind was growing old quickly. I felt like I should have reached the truck stop by now. \n\nI paused and looked around. Two realizations hit me at the same time.\n\nFirst I couldn’t see the truck stop, second, I could no longer see the truck. As a lovely addition, my tracks were quickly disappearing. \n\nI tried to focus on my path toward the truck stop and began trudging again. Fifteen minutes later, I believe by sheer luck, I saw the store appear off to the right. My track hadn’t been dead on, but I was close enough to find the place. My winter gear was starting to fail me, especially with the wind finding all the little places it could inject frigid air.\n\nAs I approached, I breathed a sigh of relief at getting in out of the cold, not to mention a massive cup of steaming hot coffee. \n\nI reached for the door, but it refused to open. Maybe it was frozen shut. I pulled harder, but nothing happened. I looked in through the glass and saw no lights on. It struck me how the walkway wasn’t shoveled either.\n\n‘Oh no,’ I thought. ‘The storm has them stuck at home.’\n\nMy hopes for a nice warm toilet and a steaming hot cup of coffee plummeted. I took one last forlorn look at the dark store and turned back toward my truck.\n\nMy disappointment grew as I realized my tracks were gone. I was now snow-blind and navigating without a compass or any means of direction. I tried to draw an invisible line with the outer wall of the store and hoped it would lead me back to the truck.\n\nI felt my cold, wet feet protest as I headed back toward the warmth of my truck. I hugged my jacket attempting to keep the wind out. The snow was up past my knees now and seemed like trudging through mud.\n\nIn retrospect, it would’ve been better for me to wait in the truck until I saw a snow plow in the parking lot. I had plenty of empty tea bottles for bathroom emergencies. \n\nBut there was no use chiding myself now. I had to get back to the truck to keep this mistake from becoming a fatal one. If I got lost and couldn’t find the truck, no one would come looking for me. They might not find my frozen body until spring thaw.\n\nThat was a cheery thought. \n\nAs if my journey hadn’t been hard enough, after a while, something caught my foot and sent me sprawling face-first in the snow. I struggled to right myself and quickly wiped the snow from my face, silently thanking God that I had worn the goggles.\n\nI tried to get my bearings again, but curiosity nagged at me. What had I tripped on in the middle of a parking lot? \n\nI dug down and discovered the offending object. It was a parking space barrier. I chuckled for a moment until I realized to my horror that I should never have come near any of these in the middle of the lot. In fact, a straight trail from the store to the truck the barrier I had tripped on would be a couple of dozen yards to the right. \n\nI scraped the rest of it off and saw it was running nearly parallel to my path. I had veered off course badly. The bright side was, I now had a point of reference and hopefully could correct my course. \n\nI looked around and found myself adrift in a sea of white. The store had disappeared, and the truck was nowhere to be found. \n\nI took a deep breath and used the barrier to aim toward where the truck should be. I remembered one key fact in the process. These barriers lined the edge of the parking lot and just past them was a drop-off. In retrospect, it was lucky I had tripped on it instead of stepping over it and rolling down a hill that I might never make it back up again.\n\nI turned to aim myself where I thought my truck was when out of the corner of my eye I thought I saw a shadow of a figure walk by. I couldn’t be sure because of the blowing snow made visibility nearly impossible more than a few yards away. It could’ve just been my imagination. I’d been out in the cold for much longer than I planned, and it was time to get back to the truck. \n\nI was suddenly reminded why I got out of the truck, to begin with. I had to pee so badly. I did a quick look and saw nothing but snow, so I whipped it out and let it go. I think whipped it out was a bit of an oversimplification. I fought to unzip my frozen zipper as my bladder screamed a full red alert that it was about to release the floodgates whether I was ready or not. \n\nI finally got it out and started the yellow stream when the wind shifted direction, sending it spraying all over my pants. I quickly turned so that the stream was downwind. When I finished, I looked down at the front of my now wet pants and swore internally. Yet another reason to find the truck quickly. Wet pants turned to frozen pants turned to dangerous pants.\n\nI looked down at the barrier now covered in flecks of yellow snow and started on my new course. The snow had not let up one bit and my energy started to wane even though I had just been standing around for the last ten minutes. Trudging through nearly waist-high snow was making me more tired than I had been in a long time.\n\nThe wind rushing in my ears tore away my hearing. There wasn’t anything out here to listen to, and yet I thought I heard something. I looked around but only saw white. Was this my mind starting to play tricks on me like it did when I was driving and thought I saw the creature that doesn’t exist peeking out at me from the trees?\n\nI turned back to my imagined destination wondering if delusions were the first step in freezing to death. As if to answer, the wind hit me with a solid gust, knocking me down. If I didn’t know better, I’d swear I felt a giant hand in the middle of my back before I fell. \n\nI looked up and saw nothing but snow, swirling around making mini tornados. I chuckled at the irony of them being called snow devils. I guess my own personal snow devil was pushing me around. \n\nI got up and started for the truck again. Every step felt like my feet were encased in concrete. \n\nI plodded on, trying to pull from whatever reserve energy I had, to keep going. I couldn’t die in the middle of a parking lot just yards away from my nice, warm, truck. That would be the ultimate irony. \n\nI walked on, barely conscious, wanting only my eighteen-wheeled safe harbor from this merciless storm. My head was down. I wasn’t even looking anymore. It didn’t make any difference. I knew I would never find it. I knew it was like looking for a needle in a field of haystacks. There was no way I would ever get ba…\n\nI slammed into something and fell back. The snow was so deep I just lay there like a turtle, unable to get off my back. I looked up and saw the thing that had hit me was the back corner of the truck. Two feet to the right and I would’ve missed it.\n\nI smiled, but it took a lot of energy. I focused everything I had into getting up. Adrenaline took care of the rest. I marched up to the driver’s side door and reached into my pocket for the key to unlock it. \n\nI couldn’t find the key.\n\nI ripped off my glove and searched again. Still no key. Despair smothered my mind. If I had dropped it one of the times I fell in the snow it was lost forever and so was I.\n\nI leaned against the truck door, so close and yet so far. I could almost feel the heat through it. I smashed my fist into my leg in frustration but felt more pain than I should’ve. I patted the other pocket and felt a lump. I tore off my other glove and reached into the pocket, pulling out the holiest of holies, the key.\n\nI tears streamed down my face and quickly froze as I stuck the key in the lock and opened the door. \n\nIt took every ounce of energy I had left to climb up into the cab and collapse into the driver’s seat.\n\nA wave of heat washed over me. For the longest time, I just sat there until I mustered the strength to start pulling off my cold-weather gear. \n\nOne piece at a time, I threw them into the passenger’s seat until I sat in my underwear only. I leaned my seat back and basked in the warmth that flowed over me like an ocean wave. I imagined sitting on a beach with the sun shining down on me and the water beckoning. \n\nI fell asleep like this.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI woke to a sore back and stretched as best I could in my seat then looked out the windshield. The snow seemed to have let up a little bit and the wind wasn’t nearly as fierce as before. There was still no sign of a plow and there was no way I was getting anywhere without one. Off in the distance, I could almost see the outline of the store.\n\nI wasn’t going there again until the parking lot was plowed. But looking around I couldn’t imagine how long that might be. There was at least three feet of snow already on the ground and it was still putting some down. \n\nI crawled into the bunk and covered up for a serious nap. \n\nHours later, I was starting to feel refreshed. I rolled over and turned on the TV, trying to see how bad things were. I couldn’t even pick up the local station so I stuck in a movie. After it was done I decided I should probably take stock of my supplies since I might be here for a while. \n\nI had plenty of snacks, chips, pretzels, and jerky, among other things, as long as I didn’t binge I should’ve been fine. I had drinks in the mini-fridge too, but water wasn’t a concern. All I had to do was bring some snow inside and melt it. \n\nI only needed to check one last thing to make sure I could outlast this storm. I looked at the fuel gauge.\n\nI rubbed my eyes and looked at the fuel gauge again. \n\nI only had a quarter tank left. That might last and it might not, depending on how long it took to get plowed out. Obviously, once the plow freed me I could drive a hundred yards or so to a gas pump. \n\nAs I was looking at the fuel gauge, my eyes drifted to the windshield and the field of white that stretched out in front of me. The snow had finally stopped. How long that would last, I had no idea. I could finally see the store clearly, but I could also see clearly that it remained closed. It was hard to believe anyone would be plowing that amount of snow anywhere. I guess that’s why they had the drop-off along the edges of the parking lot.\n\nAs I softly chuckled at my realization, my eyes caught movement. There was some kind of animal walking around in the parking lot. At first, I thought it was a deer because of the wide horns on its head, but the longer I looked the more I realized this creature was something else. It seemed bigger than any deer I’d ever seen. Its torso rode above the snow like it was a ship. Its face looked like it had wasted away to the bare skull, and it had massive teeth that went far beyond its jaw. It was rather haunting to look at. \n\nIt was sniffing around in the snow. The more I thought about it I began to realize that was probably the spot where I had taken a leak.\n\nI was mesmerized and horrified by this thing at the same time. I was nearly convinced my mind was playing a trick on me when it looked right at me and my blood turned to ice. Its look pierced my soul and made me wish I’d never come to this place. When it took its first step in my direction I dove back into the sleeper and drew the curtain.\n\nI shook for reasons that had nothing to do with the temperature and was breathing in panicked gasps. \n\nWhat was that thing? Did I really see what I thought I saw? How could a creature like that exist?\n\nI tried to settle down and get my breathing back to normal but my mind refused to let go of the image of that thing. \n\n‘It’s just my imagination,’ I told myself. ‘It’s just a deer roaming around out there.’\n\nI told myself that same thing over and over until my mind finally believed it. However, I didn’t look through the curtain to confirm it. I didn’t call it denial, I called it, not pushing my luck.\n\nI pulled out a pack of cheese crackers and turned on the first Die Hard movie to try and forget about the ‘deer’ outside.\n\nI was fifteen minutes into the movie when I felt the first nudge. I didn’t know what else to call it. It felt like something just nudged my truck. It was almost like when a strong wind gust pushed the cab. But I didn’t hear any wind outside. \n\nThe two sides of my mind engaged in a shouting match over whether I should check it out or ignore it. Fear threw its two cents in and ‘ignore it’ won out… until the second nudge.\n\nActually, it was like the fifth or sixth nudge until curiosity took over and made me go take a look.\n\nI peeked through the curtain and didn’t see anything but snow through the windshield. I climbed out and looked through the passenger’s window but saw nothing. I chided myself for my skittishness when I looked through the driver’s side window and saw a set of horns. \n\nI rubbed my eyes and looked again but they were gone.\n\nThere were tracks in the snow that looked like deer tracks, only bigger. Or was that my imagination carrying me away again?\n\nI looked in the rear-view mirror and saw the creature poking at my tires with its horns. I was fairly sure it couldn’t puncture one with just horns, but I didn’t want to chance it. I reached down, grabbed my club, and opened the door to scare it away, but again, it was gone.\n\nI was beginning to question my sanity. Was this thing real? Was it my mind playing tricks on me? Or was the creature toying with me, trying to draw me out of the truck?\n\nI closed the door and went back to my movie, but I couldn’t get that creature out of my head. I was on pins and needles waiting, listening, anticipating the next nudge.\n\nBefore the movie was over, I fell into a fitful sleep.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*I was in a tall building and there were bad guys everywhere. I had a machine gun but had been better served hiding and picking them off one by one. I was sneaking up on one who was standing guard on an isolated floor when I turned the corner and there stood the deer creature.*\n\n*It was massive, standing on its hind legs and its horns scraped the ceiling. It looked at me with those empty eye sockets from its bare skull face. It made a sound that was half grunt, half growl, then started towards me.* \n\n*I backed away around the corner, trying to get back to my hiding space but as I turned to run, suddenly the creature was in front of me. I pulled up my machine gun and started firing short bursts. I hit it in the chest, but it kept coming. As I backed away, I shot it several times in the head. I watched as chunks of bone flew, but it kept coming as if it didn’t care.*\n\n*I shot at its legs, hoping to throw it off balance, but it had no effect.* \n\n*As if it had had enough, it charged, pinning me to a wall with its horns. I looked down as the blood began to seep from my belly around its horns. It pulled back and charged me again and again, sending shockwaves of pain through my body and crushing my spine.*\n\n*It pulled back and allowed me to fall to the floor. Blood pooled around me as I tried to crawl away from the creature. I could only use my arms, I couldn’t feel anything below my waist, which was a partial blessing because it cut my pain in half.*\n\n*After I had crawled a few feet I suppose it had enough of toying with me. It stomped its foot down on my neck so hard I heard a snap and my arms went dead. I could feel it tear into my back, ripping away pieces of meat. I could hear the sickening chewing and slurping as I was eaten alive.*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI woke with a start, sweat pouring from my forehead, and looked around the sleeper cab looking for the creature that was tearing me to pieces. After a few seconds, I came to the realization it had been a nightmare. \n\nI turned off my DVD player and stuck my head out through the curtain to check on my fuel situation. The needle was well below the quarter mark, almost down to an eighth. I looked out through the windshield and the snow had not magically melted. In fact, the wind had picked up and now it was starting to drift. Where there was once an even field of snow, now there were peaks and valleys forming, like dunes in the desert.\n\nThe store was still dark and there was no traffic moving on the road. The sun was riding low in the sky and I had yet to see another living soul. I wondered if my fuel would last until a plow could rescue me. Soon I would have to give some serious thought to conserving. It wasn’t ideal. The thought of bundling up in blankets in the dark with no heater and no TV to watch wasn’t exciting me, but it was better than waiting until my fuel ran out and I froze to death.\n\nAs I killed the engine, I chided myself for not coming up with this plan sooner. I would’ve conserved fuel when the sun was out and the temperatures were higher. Now I was going to pay for my lack of foresight. I dug out every blanket I had stored in my closets and laid them over the bed, then tucked in for a long nap. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWhen I woke, I was drowning in utter darkness. I panicked for a moment before I remembered where I was. I looked at my watch and it was four in the morning. I pulled the covers off me and was immediately assaulted by cold air.\n\nI grabbed a flashlight and found my way into the cab. I turned the key on and waited with bated breath that billowed out in clouds that filled the cab until the engine turned over. As it roared to life, I felt even colder. I looked to my left and froze. My driver’s side window lay in pieces on the seat and floor. I slowly turned to look at the passenger’s side window, when fear grabbed me. There was a face looking in at me. But it wasn’t a human face, it was the ungodly face of the deer creature that had gored me to death in my dream. \n\nA river ran down my leg forming a yellow puddle on the floor as I stared into the dark hollow eyes of this thing sent straight from hell. \n\nIt reared its head back and then smashed into my passenger’s window, splintering it. It reared back again and this time shattered the window, reaching in for me with its fierce long teeth. \n\nI jumped back and landed in the driver’s seat full of glass. I knew I was dead, there was nothing I could do. I sat there as it entered the cab, coming for me. \n\nIts head was halfway inside when it suddenly stopped.\n\nIt moved around a little bit, then roared in frustration. Its horns were too wide to fit in the window. It tried over and over to get in, but there was no way it could fit with the horns. \n\nAs suddenly as it had appeared, it vanished. \n\nI looked around to see where it had gone, but the darkness of night covered it like a shroud. As I was looking, it silently reached in behind me and would’ve had me if it hadn’t breathed out, warning me of its approach. I dove into the center console as its deadly jaw snapped shut right where my spine had been. It continued its assault on this window, gaining ferocity as it frustrated itself by not being able to get ahold of me.\n\nI stood in between the two windows, hoping I was safe from either direction. It was then I decided to go back into my bunk and close the curtain. I covered up and reached underneath the bunk to a secret compartment and pulled out my forty-caliber automatic handgun. I took the magazine out and made sure it was loaded with all ten rounds, then put it back in, pulled back the slide, and flicked on the safety.\n\nIt made me feel a little better but not much. I didn’t know how true my dream was, or if bullets would do anything to this monster. I no longer had any illusions that this was a deer. It was something much more dangerous and terrifying, and it was after me.\n\nI covered up with my blankets again, holding my gun close. The heater wasn’t doing much good with two windows broken out. I would try to do something about them in the morning when it was light, there was no way I was doing anything in the dark with that thing lurking out there.\n\nI lay there for an hour watching every second of the clock tick by, eyes wide open, ears listening for any sound. But there was none, just the wind howling in between the two broken windows making my curtains flutter. Eventually, I recognized the futility of having a truck running and the warm air just escaping before it could even get to me. So I got out of my bunk, keeping my new best friend with me, and slowly made my way out to the cab, my head darting left and right to see if the creature was about to launch itself through either of the windows. I turned the key off and before I could pull it out of the ignition a set of horns smacked against the frame of the window and the deadly teeth came in and snapped just inches short of my face.\n\nI whipped around and pulled the trigger, but nothing happened. It snapped at me again and I panicked until I realized the safety was on. I flicked it off and aimed but the monster was gone. I didn’t dare make a move toward the window for fear it would launch itself back in at me. \n\nI stood still as a statue and stared at the window it had come through, then slowly turned to the other side. I kept looking back and forth between the two trying to keep my peripheral vision on both at the same time. I was shaking, not only from the cold but also from the sheer terror of not knowing where or when this thing was going to show itself.\n\nI decided my cold-weather gear would be my best option so I climbed back into the bunk and put on as many layers of clothes as I could find. When I popped my head back out, I was met with the most terrifying site imaginable. \n\nThe monster had climbed onto the hood of my truck and was now bashing its head against the windshield, trying to make its way inside. I knew the windshield was wide enough that it would be able to get its antlers inside and I would be done. \n\nI pulled the gun up, aimed at its head, and fired. \n\nThe explosion was massive. I instantly lost my hearing except for the ringing in my ears. I staggered back, but the monster kept coming. Not only had my bullet done nothing to the monster, it weakened the windshield making it easier to get inside.\n\nThe monster shook its head in surprise when the bullet ricocheted off the bone, and then continued its assault on the windshield. \n\nIt hammered on the glass until it shattered into a million pieces. I was already aiming at its face and fired two shots before the glass even hit the floor. They both ricocheted off its skull causing it to rear up just enough for me to fire two shots into its chest.\n\nIt didn’t collapse screaming in agony like I wanted, but I could tell it didn’t like it either. It jumped down off the hood and disappeared. I stared out into the inky blackness trying in vain to pick up any glimpse of it.\n\nI whipped around from one side window to the other and back again, waiting for it to show its horrid face.\n\nAfter what seemed like forever, I saw horns rising through the passenger side window. I fired a shot into its face, and it disappeared. \n\nI threw myself back into the passenger seat when suddenly I saw its head rising in the driver’s side window. I fired a shot making it disappear again. \n\nI jumped up and threw myself to the other seat, knowing it would be on the passenger’s side soon. Sure enough, ten seconds later, it appeared and I fired another shot. \n\nIt was toying with me. It disappeared and I threw myself over into the passenger’s seat, waiting, aiming at the empty driver’s window. But instead, I felt teeth clamp down on my neck. It had fooled me. I shoved my gun up under its skull and fired a shot. \n\nIf I hadn’t been deaf from the first shot, this one right next to my ear would’ve done it. And yet somehow I heard it squeal in pain as it released me. I knew I had been inches from death. I reached up and touched the wound on my neck and came away with a hand full of blood. \n\nI went back into my bunk, tore away a piece of sheet, and pressed it to my wound. Then I tore some more of the sheet and tied it around my neck to hold the bandage in place. \n\nI went back out to the cab only to see it crouching on the hood waiting for me. \n\nI never thought it would end like this. My truck’s windows smashed blood all over the interior, the frigid wind and snow blowing in as those two empty eyes stared in at me like a predator sizing up a helpless animal for the kill.\n\nIt crawled in through the remains of the windshield. I knew I was dead.\n\nIn desperation, I shoved the gun into one of its eye holes and squeezed the trigger. The sound it made was something I’d never heard before and never wanted to hear again. The scream was both a low guttural sound and a high-pitched shriek. It sounded like someone had unleashed a demon from the pits of hell. \n\nMy mind screamed at me. ‘Get out of there!’\n\nI fumbled with the driver’s door and ended up falling out when it opened. On a clear day, with no snow, I would’ve gotten a concussion or broken bone falling on the bare asphalt.\n\nWith three feet of snow on the ground, I landed on a soft, cold pillow. It was the only time in the last twenty-four hours that the snow had helped me.\n\nI immediately jumped up and looked around for any place to hide. But there was nowhere. Everything was covered in snow. I glanced back at the trailer and realized the snow was so high that it reached the bottom of the trailer. I couldn’t see underneath at all.\n\nI quickly dove under it, then turned around and tried to pile snow into the opening to hide where I had gone. I shone my light around at the beautiful sight of bare asphalt. \n\nI lay there on my belly, looking all around trying to see in every direction at once to see where the monster would attack from. My breath blew out in billows of desperate smoke as I came up empty. \n\nThere was nothing. \n\nThe monster wasn’t there.\n\nYet.\n\nI didn’t dare hope to imagine that my shot had killed it. If anything, it made it even angrier. It was probably destroying the inside of my truck at that very moment. What I didn’t trust was that the monster wouldn’t find me underneath the trailer. \n\nI looked around for anywhere I could use as a better hiding place. My eyes fell on the wheels of the truck. It looked like there was just enough room between the tires and the differential. It would be a tight squeeze, but it was better than that thing finding me.\n\nI turned around and slid my feet in first. The further I slid, the tighter it got. Ironically, the grease and oil from the differential helped me slide through a little easier. When I almost had my shoulders through it suddenly felt too tight. I was stuck. I couldn’t move forward or backward. \n\nPanic flooded my mind and I struggled frantically like I couldn’t breathe. \n\nAfter the longest minute of my life, I finally managed to maneuver my shoulders through and into my hiding spot. The hood of my coat did double duty of keeping me warm and completing my hiding place. I lowered it to the level of the asphalt and would raise it just an inch when I wanted to look out.\n\nThe first half hour was the worst. The ringing in my ears had begun to subside, but I still didn’t hear anything outside of my own breathing. \n\nThe cold slowly leaked through my clothes.\n\nStill no sign of the monster.\n\nAnother hour passed. My muscles started to cramp up.\n\nStill no sign of the monster.\n\nAnother hour.\n\nI felt like my bladder would burst.\n\nStill no monster.\n\nDuring the long boredom in between I pulled the magazine out of the gun and counted how many bullets I had left. No matter how many times I counted, it always came out to the same number… one.\n\nI knew one bullet wouldn’t save me from the monster. There was only one thing I could do with one bullet… end my suffering if it found me.\n\nI took it out of the magazine and stared at it. I used my coat to shine it up, then stared at my reflection in the gleaming metal.\n\nThe edges of the snow around the trailer began to glow. I knew the sun was coming up. Darkness was no longer my friend. \n\nI was about to give up and crawl out of my hiding place when I heard it. A soft sniffing sound. I lifted my hood an inch, just enough to peek out, and there it was. Its head had broken through the wall of snow close to where I dove under the trailer. There were a few drops of blood from my neck wound and it was sniffing them. \n\nThose drops would lead it right to me. \n\nSure enough, it took a turn toward the front of the trailer and looked in my direction. I lay there still as a stone as it inched its way toward me. It was having trouble squeezing its massive body under the trailer and I could hear it growling with frustration.\n\nIt came closer, crawling right toward me. There was no doubt it knew I was there. I closed my eyes and stuck the barrel of the gun under my chin.\n\nI felt its hot breath and smelled the stench of death as I squeezed the trigger.\n\nSuddenly it shrieked and I could feel the truck bucking above me. I opened my eyes to the most amazing sight. Its horns had gotten caught in the chains hanging down underneath the trailer and it was tangled. \n\nIt screamed and bucked and fought to be free from its metal captors. It yanked backward so hard I felt the truck move sideways an inch. The differential was pressing on me now and I had to shimmy over to avoid being crushed. \n\nI watched as the chains broke away one by one and then it was free. I took the opportunity to crawl out from under the truck. It was useless as a hiding place now. It had already tracked me here. I was almost out when I heard another sound and saw a shadow pass by the other side of the truck. \n\nIt was coming back, but it was trying from the other side. I crawled as quickly as I could. This was my chance. If it searched from the other side, it might not know I had left. I had no idea where I would go, but it was better to be out of a useless hiding place. Besides, I desperately needed to stretch and pee.\n\nAs I stood next to the truck, I saw a large patch of red in the snow. I guess shooting it wasn’t as useless as I thought. I took care of business first, peeing before I ruined another pair of pants. \n\nI finished and thought about where to hide. I looked up at the ruined cab of my truck when the nightmare crept around the corner. I stood there helpless, it had caught me flatfooted. I had nowhere to go. \n\nIt stared at me as it limped around the corner. Its empty eyes seemed to exude rage. I pulled up the gun and aimed when it disappeared in a moving mountain of snow. \n\nThe snowplow had finally arrived.\n\nI watched as the plow pushed its mound of snow past my truck and over the edge of the parking lot. \n\nThe driver backed up and stopped beside me. \n\n“You been here all night?” the driver said.\n\n“Since before the storm.”\n\n“What happened to your truck?” he said looking up at my shattered windows.\n\nI followed his eyes and thought for a moment. \n\n“Someone tried to rob me,” I lied, knowing the truth was unbelievable.\n\n“I see you took care of it,” he said looking at the gun in my hand.\n\nI looked down at the gun and stuck it in my waistband. \n\n“It’s been a helluva night,” I said.\n\n“Well, don’t worry, the roads are getting cleared and I’ll get you plowed out of here.”\n\n“Thanks,” I said.\n\nHe nodded and backed up to continue plowing.\n\nI looked at where he had just plowed beside my truck and saw a long smear of red. I followed it to the edge of the parking lot and looked over the side with my hand on my gun. The drop-off was a good ten feet or more and the snow had already started to pile up. I followed the path of red down the hill with my eyes and saw antlers poking out of the snow. I stared at them looking for any movement. For ten minutes I watched, and they didn’t move. I was interrupted when the plow pushed another pile of snow over the side, covering the antlers.\n\nI watched for another five minutes just to be sure. \n\nThe plow guy pulled up beside me.\n\n“You ok?” he said.\n\nI pulled my eyes away from the snow pile. \n\n“Yeah, I’m good.”\n\n“You sure?” he said pointing at my neck.\n\n“Yeah, I just got nicked by some glass,” I said remembering the teeth of the monster clamping down on my neck.\n\n“Well, I think someone just pulled into the store,” he said. “Maybe you should get something for that.”\n\n“I will, thanks,” I said, knowing I would do no such thing. \n\nI wanted to avoid as many questions as possible. \n\nI climbed into the cab, brushed the glass off my seat, and drove over to the fuel pumps. After filling up, I started the long trip home. I kept my cold-weather gear and mask on. Having no windows or windshield made for a frigid trip. The heater was on max and aimed at my feet, keeping the bottom half of me warm. \n\nI didn’t call for a tow truck because I wanted to get away from there. \n\nI never went back to that truck stop again. I didn’t want to take the chance of that thing being alive.\n\nI never told anyone else about the harrowing encounter. \n\nI wish I could erase it from my mind.\n\nAs I drove towards my home terminal through the endless stretch of trees, I saw one of the creatures peeking out at me that I used to think was my imagination.\n\nNow I know better.",

        "text": "Boredom. It was a Saturday morning the day after summer break started, I was in the 11th grade, School, for me, was everything, I used to study very often and investigate new topics all the topic, I was always very curious to see what the world had to offer. But this day was more boring than any day before it, I had nothing to do, nothing crossed my mind that day which would peak my interest. \n\nUntil I remembered. \n\nOne of the weird kids, he had told me about something. He was very weird about it, as he usually is with most subjects. But he seemed more, curious, more excited than usual. He told me that he found something, something which he called: \"Real Metal\". He was a huge metalhead, an absolute nerd for that stuff, knew everything about it.\n\n I dismissed it at the time, but I thought about it while in bed, this kid was always very picky about what he listened to, he always chose the highest quality songs, nothing less than what he considered perfection. He claimed to have had the \"best\" metal playlist of all, only the best of the best.\n\n So for him to then claim that he found \"real metal\" was very interesting, wouldn't he know what \"real metal\" is after collecting so many songs and going to so many concerts, events? I gave him a call, asked about his discovery of \"real metal\". He told me, in an unusually calm voice, that what he indeed found was \"real metal\", and that everything else he had listened to was nothing more but mediocre copies of \"greatness\". \n\nThis peaked my curiosity much more further, I asked if I could listen to whatever he had, he agreed, with a joyful voice, uncharacteristic of him. So, my day was made, not boring, by the weirdest guy in class. I made it out my house and headed to his, he didn't live too far away, only a mile. \n\nI walked up to his porch, I felt a strange cold go over me, everywhere else was very sunny and hot, but here it was somehow suddenly calm, cold and shade passed over the place. I don't know, but I felt very uneasy, like something was off that I wasn't noticing. I looked at the door of the house and notice that it changed color. It used to be a light yellow, but now is completely black. \n\n\"Maybe they painted the house\" I told myself, considering that the day previously it was it's original color, meaning that they likely must have painted it early in the morning, really early or even late at night. Which was plausible, strange though, even if the door was also dry as desert sand, like it had always been that color, it had some imperfections that would be noticeable after a long period of time. But I didn't think anything of it, I was distracted thinking about the \"real metal\" this strange guy claimed he had. \n\nHe opened the door for me. Another strange occurrence, as he never left his room, even for friends, as his mother or father always answered. \n\n\"Come in, to the house of perfection, where all your oddities are sorted out!\" \n\nI looked at him with a strange look, even this was out of his area of \"weirdness\" but I obliged and entered his home. I had no reason to suspect there was something macabre going on, he was a strange but friendly guy. So I didn't really consider thinking about the rest of the things out of place in his home. This strange odor lingered in the air, the type of smell you'd associate with body odor, extreme body odor, mixed in with perfume, of all things.\n\n He led me to his upstairs room, he walked like a robot and didn't say a word as we entered the room. It was as you'd expect, covered in posters, tidy, warm, messy. He pointed at a headset, which was laying in the middle of a table, as if it was placed there for this occasion. I approached the headset, and put it on. I turned around to look at him, as he said, in a monotone voice.\n\n\"Smith, I'll see you later\"\n\nMy eyes widened, Smith was my birth name, but it wasn't my current name, my name was changed just months after my birth, as my parents were on the run for several crimes they committed, as gave me up to a My grandparents. My name was changed because they thought it would protect me from media coverage or the legal system. \n\nI tried to remove the headset, but I blacked out. Only hearing the most intense metal I have ever heard in my entire life, it was nothing like any song he had played, it was chaotic, like any other song of it's kind, but organized at the same time. It was strangely soothing, calming, in contrast to what it actually was. It really sounded like \"real\" metal. \n\nThis lasted for a few minutes, ten to be exact. After the song ended, it was just a few minutes of static noise, my thoughts were racing before me, as I desperately tried to wake up.\n\n But then, suddenly, a massive figure appears in front of me, I can only describe it as, a monster, it very strongly resembled the type of visions you'd see while on a drug like DMT, it had massive, red tendrils shooting out of it's 'body', and a massive gaping maw in the middle, which had an infinite void inside. It started to get closer, slowly enveloping my body. To which then, I launched back in to my body and I regain my vision. I'm not in his room anymore, I'm in van. \n\nI look to my side and see a woman I don't recognize, she too is awake and stares back at me. We are both breathing heavily and shaking. I can't muster any words, I try to. But she then said: \n\n\"Isaac? Is that you? How did we get here? Why do you so.. older?\" \n\nI respond: Brittany? I don't know what happened, I just blacked out at Judas' house, then woke up here\" \n\n\"Judas? I was at his home too..\" \n\nWe looked at each other for several seconds, before someone else breaks the silence.\n\n\"Isaac? Where are we?\"\n\nWe both look towards him, it's Judas, he looks at lot older, but I recognized the birth mark on his cheek.\n\nI don't say a word, as I open the back of the van and head out. I stumbled for several steps before regaining my composure and taking in my surroundings. Everything has changed, I can clearly notice that I'm in towns square, but the buildings are different, the old library isn't even there anymore. I look towards a building right next to me and see a huge sign on the front. \n\n\"Happy New Years 2023!\" \n\nMy mouth opens wide in shock, how could it be 2023, If yesterday it was 2003?\n\nI run away from the van, running down a street which led to my house. I took me a few good minutes of running, it was an absolute pain, as my body acted as if it hadn't ran in years. But I eventually made it to my home. It was gone, completely, it seemed to have been demolished, as only a concrete foundation remained. \n\nMy heart was pounding, I didn't know what to think. One day I pass out and wake up in a place I don't know, seemingly in the future. It took me a minute but I eventually calmed down. I put my hands on my waist, I felt a strange object in my pants, I took it out and it's a cellphone of sorts , not just any cellphone, but a really advanced one with an interactive screen. \n\nI unlocked the screen, with merely the muscle memory of doing it so many times in my \"sleep\". \n\nI check the cellphone and see a feature in the \"home\" screen. It's this app I'm currently on, called \"Reddit\" I tap on the feature and get to learn about what it is and get the understanding that it's a web forum. I've only been awake for a few hours, but I'm writing this so I don't forget my story or leave it untold. I'll learn how to more extensively use this feature and other features on the cellphone. But first I gotta find the rest of my friends and family.",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile your reading this you might notice a sense of paranioa come upon you.  Thats fine but for me i've been reading scary stories my whole life since i was almost 7, im 35 now. Nothing really scares me anymore ghost, monsters The DeepWeb/DarkWeb. I've i seen them all, i've always wanted to be scared so i been looking for scary stuff for the past few years.\n\n Nothing has really has been interesting, Until I came upon this one story a few days back a playlist really. I was looking on reddit and i came across an r/Nosleep scariest stories it was a group of about 21 stories. I've read them all of course and when i got the last story i thought it was be all the same.\n\n Like the last 20 stories i read. I mean they pretty different at most, and, I actually did like them. But the last story, is the one i've been obsessing over. The story, it just really hit me different I guess because it was similar to an experiecnce i had before. Well, that is what kinda got me into scary stuff in the first place anyways. I might aswell tell the experience, give you some back story, Why i like being scared and why i'll always obsesse over the feeling.\n\n Actually it scared me so bad i still remember most of the details almost 30 years later.     I was 6 years old in about a month I would turn 7, makes since now? My Ma was washing me in the bathtub. Of course my young self was enjoying the pleasure of the hot water. \n\nBut my Mom said she would be getting my towel so she left and told me not to drown with a laugh in her voice. Her bedroom was next to the bathroom I was in, but, I couldn't see inside the room. All i could do was listen. So, as I was playing with my toy truck in the water expecting my Mother to come out at any moment with my towel. I heard a scream. It wasnt a normal scream though. It was cut off so quick if you wasnt paying attention you wouldnt have heard it all. \n\nFor me I almost didnt hear it, it was my mom, Though, the scream was cut off so quick I just assumed it was her. I tried to stand up and see what happened but as I was started to move my mom came back into the bathroom with a towel. But i noticed the smallest little change about her now. she was one milimeter taller than before i noticed because the cabinets in the bathroom was at her eye level I didn't say anything though because i was still kinda shocked about what happened. \n\nNow, it was different, expect she acted normal like she did before, nothing had changed. She got me out of the tub and into some new clothes. One small thing about her though, she always let me sleep in her bed with her when i was scared. So, after hearing that cut off scream my young mind thought there might be a ghost in the house. \n\nI fianlly got the courage to ask her what had happened to her while she was in her room. I asked her but, there was no response, all she would mutter is that she saw the cat under the covers moving and thought it was something weird but quickly realized. I wasnt convinced though, but, thats all she said over and over that same story. I was still scared and kept telling her to let me in sleep with her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually she gave in, I got onto the bed but, some was very wrong with the way the bed was. It felt like something was under it. Like a spring broke or something. It was very lumpy and seemed like there was something between the mattress and the bed frame. My Mom seemed fine with it though, like she didnt even notice. I went to sleep and a few hours later, I presume, I couldnt shake the feeling of the horrible bed hurting my back i turned out to face her but, she was gone. I looked in the bathroom, gone I looked in my room and the living room. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was not a single living soul in that house expect for me, not even my cat seemed to be anywhere. All the lights in the house were on, which she did like to leave the lights on sometimes so i assumed she was out some where and would come back very soon. But in the meantime I layed back down on the dreaded bed. I has to see what was under there. I used all my 6 year old strenght to push the mattress up and, my Mother? I didnt know what to think I was so shocked It was my mother under there the whole time. But who was the person acting like my mother though. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt that exact moment every single emotion started flooing my little brain i couldnt even move or even think, who was that or what was thing that was acting like her? I shut the door and locked it. I stayed in the room over night terrified about what had just transpired. Eventually i stayed in the room for days. Trying to wake her, terrified about the past events. But,  finally. I knew she was dead when I realized a stench was coming from her. Eventually I heard a knock on the bedroom door, I felt a 1000 pounds of weight lift off me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThough, It was short lived when i was realized it could be anybody, or, anything. I realized if I didnt open the door eventually I would die because they would just break down the door. So, I opened it. i saw two police officers my grandparents and my dad who was out to work for a few days. I quickly leaped out and latched onto the officers crying and screaming.\n\n Eventually I told them the story about the that thing inpersonating my mom. Just by the looking in there face you could tell they didnt believe me, and i heard they just ruled it an overdose. Im starting to cry now and my wife is comforting me, but it noticed one small change about her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe was about one milimeter taller. Ah its probably the tears in my eyes messing up my vision up. As she was comforting me I realized what that one milimeter meant and i nearly screamed but i didnt say anything. All she said was, are you scared yet?",

        "text": "A few years back at oh dark thirty, probably closer to 2am than midnight, I had myself a pretty bad case of the midnight munchies.\n\nThis is nothing unusual, it was a warm night in august, and at the time I still smoked, so I drove the three minutes down the road to my convenience store of choice. About two thirds of the way to the store there's a bridge that rolls over some railroad tracks.\n\nI saw a man walking on the sidewalk of that bridge, and for a moment wondered if there wasn't something funny in whatever it was that was in the weed I'd smoked earlier. There was a man who could've been anywhere between late thirties to his sixties walking.\n\nIt was hard to tell his age because he was in full clown regalia, even toting a bouquet of balloons. facepaint, huge shoes, the works.\n\nAt this point I am driving about as fast as the man is walking, because what the actual fuck. Is this real?\n\nHe turns to me and gives me a big smile. It was a smile that haunts me to this day. Would send any self respecting dental professional into hysterics. Bright yellow and jagged teeth, just... even a meth addict would recommend a toothbrush.\n\nAnd he says to me in a voice that sounds like he's been smoking 3 packs a day since he was in the womb he says, \"Hey pal, can I get a ride?\" and throws up the hitchhiking thumb.\n\nNOPE! NOPENOPENOPENOPE! NOOOOOPE!\n\nI floored it and did my first ever burn out, my little Honda civic seemed spurred on by my terror.\n\nWas also the first time I'd managed to drift in that car, because at the end of the bridge the convenience store was around the corner.\n\nI didn't feel safe in the car. Uh uh. I shot out of the car like I had an ejector seat, didn't even close my car door or bother locking it. Just ran inside the store, pale, shaking and sweating, presumably looking like I'd just seen something out of my worst nightmares.\n\nThat'd be on account of I just did, actually.\n\nThe clerk's like, \"Uh, hey buddy, you okay?\"\n\nI give a little bit of a manic laugh, \"Absofuckinglutely not. There's a dude walking this way in full clown regalia. Sounds like death warmed over.\"\n\nClerk hears what I said, looks at me, and astutely comes to the conclusion that there are no hidden cameras, I am NOT playing. That sets him off too, \"Oh FUCK no. Why did it have to be a clown.\"\n\nHe grabs a cordless phone and hits a number on speed dial, then zips over to the store's only entrance and locks that thing tight. Clerk is talking to the police over the phone, describing what I'd seen.\n\nYou'd think they'd laugh and tell me or him to lay off the fun drugs.\n\nThey most certainly did not. Clerk was told to lock the place down, make sure I stayed there. Help was on the way.\n\nThree squad cars came to the little store, in MINUTES, sirens BLARING, 2am be damned! Several police officers descended on the store, armed to the teeth. Not just pistols, oh no. Assault rifles and shotguns. They were taking this seriously. Actually checked around the building before they asked the clerk to open up.\n\nThen the police officers talked to me. Asked me to describe what I'd seen.\n\nAnd I could hear more sirens. And then more. I didn't think my little town had this many officers this late at night. When I mused on that out loud the officer who was interviewing me gave me a funny look and then an odd laugh, \"Son, every single police officer in the county just got their asses rolled out of bed. You'd best not be pulling our leg here.\"\n\nI solemnly assured him I wasn't. On account of I actually wasn't, as well as a sense of 'I will say whatever I need to say to make the man holding an assault rifle happy'.\n\nTwo squad cars actually stayed for almost an hour, keeping watch while the other police cars searched.\n\nAfter an hour or so, one of the cops inside with us got a call over the radio and said I could go home.\n\nI asked if they'd found the clown.\n\nCop gave me a look and said, \"Would it make you feel any better if I said we did?\"",

        "text": "I was out in the front garden sweeping leaves one afternoon when a red-headed kid rolled up on his bike and started talking to me.\n\n\"Hey, I'm Max. What are you doing?\" He said grinning.\n\nI couldn't help but notice and stare at the gap in his smile. He had a front tooth missing and it made him look like a bit of a hillbilly.\n\n\"I'm Danny. And what does it look like I'm doing? I'm sweeping leaves!\" \n\nI was a little frustrated cause I wanted to be inside watching TV but my mum insisted I complete my chores first. \n\nDoesn't she understand that doing my chores first means I miss my shows which, in turn, renders the reward of getting to watch the TV, useless?\n\nAnyway, this kid Max strikes up a conversation about bikes and his favourite shows etc. Turns out, he's actually pretty cool.\n\n\"You wanna come to hang out at mine? I've got a whole den setup where we can watch movies and play games\". \n\nHe spoke with such an infectious energy, I couldn't resist.\n\n\"Where do you live?\" I asked\n\n\"Literally like two roads away, the house with the green roof\". He replied without hesitation.\n\n\"Green roof?\" All the houses in the area either had a red, or blue roof. I don't remember ever seeing a house with a green roof but, I guess I don't pay much attention to roof colours.\n\n\"Alright, lemme finish up here and I'll go get my bike\".\n\nI finished sweeping the leaves into a neat pile and then bagged them up. Then I took the broom into the kitchen where my mum was sitting talking to my aunt.\n\n\"Alright, I'm done. I'm gonna go over to Max's and hang out for a bit, I'll see you later\". \n\n\"Okay Hun, well done, have fun\". I could tell she wasn't listening. \n\nWhen she and my aunt start getting into one of their deep conversations they're oblivious to the world.\n\nI put the broom away and went and got my bike from the garage and met Max out in the front of the house.\n\nWe rode around the neighbourhood a little bit, racing, and talking about school and girls and our lives in general. \n\nI don't know what it was about him, but I felt like I'd known Max for years.\n\nEventually, we decided to head to his house.\n\nHe wasn't lying, his house did have a green roof.\n\nWe went in and it was beautiful. \n\nThey were clearly a well-off family. Everything was clean and modern. Not like our house where everything was old and every room was full of dad's clutter.\n\nNot to mention the constant noise of my sisters fighting and my family always coming over for a chat.\n\nMax's house was quiet and peaceful.\n\n\"Where are your parents?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oh, they're out of town\" he replied. \n\nHe seemed a little sad. But I guess being a kid at home alone can be a little lonely. No wonder he stopped and struck up a conversation. \n\nI felt even more glad I'd come over to hang out now.\n\n\"My den is set up down in the basement, let's go!\" He said as he took off through the kitchen, opened the basement door and ran down the stairs leaving me to catch up.\n\nAgain, he wasn't lying! The basement was full of games, a pool table, a sofa, a TV, fridge, it was a proper little man cave!\n\n\"You any good at FIFA?\" He asked chucking me a control pad.\n\n\"Am I good at FIFA!?\" I snapped back. \"You'll have to find out won't you!?\" \n\nWe both rushed to the sofa ready to get into some proper gaming.\n\nAfter an hour or two passed and I'd whooped his butt at FIFA about 10 times we got bored of playing games and decided to explore the basement a bit.\n\nAt the far end was a bunch of boxes, a washing machine, a furnace, books and other junk that they had stored down there.\n\nWe were going through some of the old boxes trying on clothes and messing about when Max found an old VCR. \n\nIt was covered in dust and had a few tapes with it.\n\nMax said that some of the tapes might be worth something to collectors or something like that, so we should hook it all up and try them out to see.\n\nThe first couple of tapes were recordings of old TV shows from back in the day. Then Max found a tape with what seemed like nothing on it except static. \n\nIt showed nothing until we forwarded it right to the end of the tape, where all this weird stuff started happening.\n\nWe saw Max sitting on the sofa, then lying on the ceiling, then sitting on the sofa again but, on fire this time, and then he vanished completely and the video went back to static.\n\nI looked at max, \"What the hell was that\"?\n\nHe shrugged, \"I don't know man but let's try it again!\"\n\nI wasn't too keen on it, to be honest, but, Max is one of those people whose enthusiasm infects you and you can't refuse.\n\n\"Alright, let's watch it again,\" I said shaking off my slight apprehension about it.\n\nWe rewound the tape and played it again and things got even stranger. \n\nWe saw ourselves this time, from above and with sound but it was low pitched like it was slowed down. \n\n\"Hey, that's us just a minute ago finding the tapes!\" I shouted while pointing at the screen and elbowing Max in his ribs.\n\n\"Yup, looks like us alright,\" said max calmly.\n\n\"How is this happening man? Like what the hell is this?\"\n\nAll of a sudden, the camera angle changed to being in front of us as if a camera was inside the TV. But it seemed far away and blurry and was slowly zooming in and becoming clearer.\n\nI looked at max and Max looked at me.\n\n\"Bro... What the?\" I was dumbfounded.\n\nMax got up off the sofa and went closer to the screen, and at the same time, the max on the screen got up off the sofa and moved closer to us.\n\n\"Looks like we're live now!\" Max shouted as he jumped back onto the sofa next to me.\n\n\"Bro this is insane\" The fear had gone and I was smiling. This was kinda fun.\n\nWe both sat there, transfixed on the screen as the picture continued to zoom in.\n\nLittle by little I could see more detail in the image, the items in the room, the logos on our clothes, the features on my face... But not Max's. \n\nHis face was kind of grey and blurry, so I stared harder, moving forward a little more to focus as the image zoomed closer. \n\nStill blurry, no... smoky. His face was moving and waving like it was smouldering and his body seemed to have smoke rising up from it.\n\n\"Hey, Max, what's wrong with your\"... I started as I turned to him only to see him levitating upside down, covered in a cloud of thick black smoke. \n\nHis head was looking straight at me but with no facial features at all. Only thick black smoke where his face should have been!\n\n\"Ahhhhhh, what the hell!\" I screamed and scrambled off the sofa into the corner of the room.\n\nMax began spinning around and moving closer like some kind of faceless, smoking whirlwind coming to suck me in.\n\n\"Get the hell away from me, stay back, Max, what the hell man!?\"\n\n\"Don't worry Danny, you won't burn, trust me, don't you wanna live forever?\" \n\nMax's voice sounded all warped and wavy like a chewed-up tape.\n\n\"What's happening Max, stop it please!\"\n\n\"There's no going back Danny, this is real life, you can't rewind it now!\"\n\n\"No, no!\" I shouted and held my hands up in front of my face to protect myself from whatever Max was about to do.\n\nSuddenly, I heard the sound of the VCR chewing up the cassette.\n\n\"No, not the cassette, this is the master copy, no, noooooo!\" Max screamed. \n\nHis voice sounded exactly the same as the tape being chewed, all warped and reversed.\n\nThen, he was gone and I was standing in the basement alone, the TV showing nothing but static. \n\nI rushed up the stairs and out of the basement to find the whole house empty. Literally nothing, no carpet, no furniture, no paint on the walls nothing. Just an empty, run-down and decaying old house.\n\nI opened the basement door and looked down the stairs... Nothing!\n\nNo sofa, no TV and no VCR, nothing!\n\nI ran for the front door, grabbed the handle and flung it open so hard it hit the wall and a glass panel cracked and fell to the floor.\n\nI ran all the way home without stopping or looking back once.\n\nWhen I got in, I was out of breath and my throat was dry so I went straight into the kitchen and poured myself a glass of water.\n\nMy mum was still in the kitchen talking with my aunt at the table. \n\n\"Where the heck are you coming from and why are you breathing so heavily\"? \n\n\"Mum, I was over at Max's and we found this weird VCR that showed him upside down and then Max turned into a whirlwind creature thing and was about to kill me when the tape got chewed up and he disappeared!\"\n\nMy mum looked at my aunt and burst out laughing.\n\n\"Kids and their imaginations ay Gilly!\" My aunt chuckled.\n\n\"Tell me about it, this one never stops\" my mum sighed rolling her eyes\n\n\"I swear to you, go over there right now and you'll see the house is empty and Max has completely disappeared!\" I demanded.\n\n\"Firstly, you need to calm down and remember who you're talking to Danny! Secondly, who is this Max kid you're on about\"?\n\nI could tell my mum was losing her patience.\n\n\"Max is the red-headed kid that lives over on Walter close. You know, his family has the house with the green roof\". I tried to explain.\n\n\"Wait, green roof?\" My mum asked puzzled.\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\n\"Danny, you know I encourage you to be yourself, watch your little programs and be free with your creativity, but you're taking it too far now. It's disrespectful to speak I'll of the dead!\" \n\nI could tell she was annoyed now by her tone.\n\n\"The dead!? What?\" I was confused. \n\nWas my mum losing the plot too?\n\n\"Yes, the dead! Mr &amp; Mrs Coalburne moved away about 3 years ago after their son... Max got trapped in the basement during a fire. They managed to put the fire out before he was burned but the roof collapsed trapping him in the basement. By the time they got to him, he had died from smoke inhalation. I remember thinking how tragic it was\".\n\nI couldn't believe what I was hearing!\n\n\"No, no way! You're wrong! I've been riding around and playing in the basement with Max for at least the last 4 hours. You don't know what you're talking about!\" I shouted back.\n\nMy aunt looked at my mum with her jaw wide open. She'd never seen me speak to my mother like that before. In fact, I'd never spoken to either of my parents like that before.\n\n\"Daniella Amanda Mason that's enough! Go to your room and think  about the way you're behaving young lady!\"\n\nMy eyes were welling up with frustration because I know what I saw.\n\nIt was no use trying to argue with my mum though, so I stormed up to my room and threw myself on the bed and began to cry.\n\nI lay on my front sobbing into my pillow for a few minutes before I had to shift my weight. Something in my pocket was digging into my hip.\n\nI rolled onto my side and put my hand into my right jeans pocket. \n\nThere was something small, solid and oddly roundish but rectangular at the same time.\n\nI pulled it out.\n\n\"Ugh, what the hell!?\" I screamed as I threw the thing across the room.\n\nNo way! I thought to myself as I got up and stood over it.\n\nA tooth! Someone's front [tooth!](https://www.youtube.com/@homestudiohorror/videos)",

        "text": "I have always been a bit of a night owl. I love the peace and quiet that comes with the dark, and I find that my mind is more creative and alert when the sun goes down. So, when I moved into my new apartment a few months ago, I was thrilled to discover that it had large windows that let in plenty of natural light during the day, and that I could keep them open at night to let in the cool breeze. But as the weeks went by, I started to notice something strange about my windows. They were always open, no matter how many times I closed them. I figured that maybe I was just forgetful, so I didn't think too much of it. But then, I started to notice that the curtains were always blowing in the wind, even when there was no wind outside.\n\nAt first, I thought it was just my imagination, but then I started to hear strange noises coming from outside my windows at night. It was like someone was walking around outside, but whenever I looked out, there was no one there. I tried to ignore it, but it was hard to shake the feeling that something was watching me. One night, I woke up to find a figure standing outside my window. I froze, not knowing what to do. The figure was tall and thin, with long, spindly fingers and a face that was nothing but a blank white mask. I couldn't see any eyes, but I felt like it was looking right at me. I lay there, paralyzed with fear, for what felt like an eternity. Finally, the figure turned and walked away, and I quickly closed and locked my windows. I was too scared to sleep for the rest of the night, and when the sun came up, I called my landlord to tell him what had happened. He came over later that day and took a look at my windows, but he couldn't find anything wrong with them. He suggested that maybe I was just imagining things, and that I should try to get more sleep. But I knew what I had seen, and I couldn't shake the feeling that something was still out there, watching me.\n\nOver the next few weeks, the strange occurrences continued. Every night, the windows would open on their own, and the curtains would blow in the wind. I could hear someone walking around outside, and sometimes I would catch a glimpse of that blank white mask. I started to feel like I was going crazy. I couldn't sleep, and I couldn't focus on anything else. I was constantly on edge, always looking over my shoulder and jumping at every little noise. Finally, I decided that I couldn't take it anymore. I packed up my things and moved out of the apartment. But even now, I can't shake the feeling that something is still watching me. I know it sounds crazy, but I swear it's true. I don't know what it is, or why it's following me, but I can't shake the feeling that it's not finished with me yet. I have heard many people complaining about their windows and doors that open and close by themselves, but I never believed it until it happened to me. I am still haunted by the figure with the blank white mask and I still can't shake the feeling that something is still out there, watching me.",

        "text": "I shut my door.\n\nIt was like lifting a weight. Or maybe it was more like relieving stress with a nice massage. Not that I’ve ever gotten one before. Or, perhaps more like turning a room into a decompression chamber. Not like I’ve ever been in…\n\nWell, anyway. I was safe now. From everything. Everything else, that is.\n\nI stared into what I called my room. Four blank walls stared back. A window, poorly covered by a cheap blackout shade, stood out against the white walls. The contrast bothered me, and made me grit my teeth together. I shut the light off.\n\nThere. Now everything was dark. The afternoon light struggled to penetrate the elementary barrier that was a sheet of black paper. My eyes adjusted ever so slightly to the darkness, simplifying the contents of my room into blurred outlines. I listed them one by one in my head. A desk, covered in dust and half-finished projects. A desktop computer. A hamper, with clothes littering the floor. A mattress, flush with the right corner of the room. An electric piano, neglected for years. A laptop, once utilized often and productively, sitting on the floor. Two foldable chairs, one for me, one for…\n\nI looked around. It’s okay! There’s plenty of things to do here. Plenty of things to occupy myself with before tomorrow.\n\nI know! Maybe I could finish some drawings? I’ve always wanted to get better, and with my recent interests, it would benefit me to practice some art. \n\nI unfolded one of the two chairs, and sat at my desk, full of crumpled papers and scattered art supplies, messily covering a keyboard and cluttering the monitor in front of me. I pushed the keyboard to the side and moved the monitor back, creating ample art space. I wasn’t ever really that good at drawing, but I did enough to be better than the people who definitely weren’t good at drawing! Even though it’s mean to think things like that, it made me feel better about myself. I did what I could to feel better about myself. \n\nA piece of blank paper sat in front of me. I wondered what to draw. I’ve heard of good artists who, to practice, simply drew the things around them. I looked around. It was dark. I could only make out blurred outlines and shapes. Well, it’s not like I can turn the light on. My eyes were drawn to a piece of crumpled paper next to me. \n\nOf course! I’ll just try to improve on what I’ve been working on before. \n\nI took the piece of crumpled paper, and began unwrapping it. A shape appeared before me. A circle, drawn many times over. The curves of lead seemed to oscillate and distort on the page. It was as if a child, struggling to stay within the lines of a coloring book, frustratedly colored in the same section over, and over, and over, and over again. I stared at the blank paper in front of me for what must have been a few minutes. I put my pencil down. \n\nAh, that’s alright. I can work on it another time. There are other things to do.\n\nI booted up my desktop, genuinely excited for this one. I was learning how to code! In the past, I had played a lot of video games, and I always thought I had good ideas for making one. I finally took the first step and followed some videos online to try to learn— and it went well! I was able to make a button that makes a number increase if you click it. \n\nA bright screen in front of me lit up the room. I frowned, and looked around. A lot more things were lit up now. Well, that’s okay. Screens do that. As long as I look at the screen, everything behind it is dark. I brought up the last video I was watching, and tried my best to follow along. The man in the video made jokes, laughed, and frequently stopped to note that certain sections were confusing. It wasn’t pleasant. This is serious. I really want to learn this; I wish he would take me seriously. I don’t mind if it’s confusing. \n\nFrustrated, I closed the video, running the program I made the other day. A familiar button greeted me. \n\n“Hello, button.” I said out loud. I made myself smile. How silly, talking to a button on a monitor. \n\nI clicked it many times, so many times in fact, that I got it to 7. Sometimes it took a couple clicks to increase the counter. I was happy and excited at the progress I had made. I had never made it to 7 before. \n\nAfter 7, however, it started going backwards. 6. 5. 4. 3. 2. 1. 0. -1… \n\nI frowned. Maybe I’m not cut out for this after all. I shut off my computer, shrouding the room in darkness once again. I’d find something else to do. \n\nI got up from my chair, and began to walk towards the piano. It had been a long time since—\n\nMy sudden weightlessness interrupted my thought. I was falling. I attempted to slow the fall with my arms, only slightly too late, causing me to fall face first on the floor. Ouch. My nose and body throbbed, as I struggled to get up. I really hated feeling pain. I got angry. What could have caused such a sudden fall?\n\nMy eyes fell on the culprit. Pants stuck halfway under the bed. My foot must have gotten caught in the loop. I quickly grabbed them, livid, wanting to punish them for hurting me. They quivered in my hands, awaiting discipline. I cursed them for not being in the hamper. If I had only put *this* specific pair of pants in the hamper, I wouldn’t have fallen today. As I was about to drop them in the hamper, a thought came to my head. \n\nWere these dirty or clean? And was my hamper dirty or clean? I looked around at all the clothes littering the floor. Surely those were dirty. But what if they weren’t, and the hamper was dirty? And pants, in some situations, can be worn multiple times. Were these pants clean? Unsure, I dropped them on the floor, and kicked them into the corner. \n\nThere. That way it won't trip me again.\n\nMy body turned towards the piano. Maybe— maybe I shouldn’t today. It’s probably upset at me. Upset that it hasn’t been played in years. I was never really as good as I wanted to be anyway. What could I do after all this time? I’d disappoint it. It would be disrespectful to play it when I’m not as good as I was.\n\nI made a mental note to only play the piano when I’m as good as I used to be. \n\nWhat to do then?\n\nI fell onto my mattress, staring up. A sturdy looking nail lodged into the ceiling drywall caught my attention. It was bent, as if significant weight had warped it. I… really needed to get that removed. \n\nMaybe… This wasn’t so bad. Maybe, just maybe, I could just go to sleep. That way, I could just skip to tomorrow, and try everything again. \n\nOh, but I’m not really tired. I can’t really go to sleep like this…\n\nMaybe…\n\nA familiar shadow skittered and rolled around in my peripheral. It passed through here every now and then. A round circle of pulsing dark, and a shiny beak. Two white, beady eyes of static looked directly at me. \n\nIt spoke. \n\nIts voice crackled like raging fire, unintelligible, as it presented it's sharp beak to me, holding it over my wrist. \n\nI had thought about it before, many times. But because of— \n\nIt— it meant I couldn’t ever do that. I would be afraid to. If someone sees them, they might want to help me. And I don’t need help; really. I can deal with it myself. I don’t need any of those people, ever again. I’m fine alone, seriously. I’m better off. I know I can handle being alone, and I know they can’t. So I’d rather them be together, and me alone, than to try and justify my mistakes. I don’t need to justify my mistakes. They are unjustifiable. No one has to worry about them anymore but me. \n\nBesides, I really hated feeling pain. I could never do that. I’m too weak. \n\nHesitating, I reached out towards the shadow with a waving open hand, declining the offer. It disappointingly skittered along, leaving a familiar picture frame, face down, next to me. My heart sank, and I began to breathe heavily. I slowly reached towards it; it was something I thought I had gotten rid of— something I had tried to move past. A date in permanent marker was written on the back, with a little heart. \n\n“5/25/2017”\n\nThe date had meant nothing for a while now. Years of history erased in an instant; a cruel reminder of mortality and its suddenness. A cruel reminder of who is to blame. \n\nI turned the picture frame over.\n\nEmpty. \n\nThat— that’s right. I had gotten rid of it.\n\nI turned over and fell back into my bed. I let the shadows of the four corners of the ceiling slowly close my eyes for me. I think I—\n\nI think I wanted to just fade away. Even if it’s only for a moment. Close my eyes, forget everything and everyone. Lose my being, and just bask in becoming one with surrounding darkness. I think I would be content with that kind of existence. Free from the weight of others. Free from the weight of myself. Of all.\n\nI see two white, beady eyes of static staring at me from the pitch black ceiling. This is a different one. It’s so tall it has to bend its body so as not to burst through the roof. It takes me away. It helps me fade away. It’ll lower itself towards me, gradually getting closer, gradually darkening the familiar room around me until it’s a single shade of unpierceable dark. It’s cold, but not in an unforgiving and uncomfortable way. It’s cold in a way that is cathartic. Cold in a way that could freeze time itself. It’s silent. It’s still. It’s— it’s terrifying. Did I really want to fade away? Was that what I really wanted?\n\nI shook my head, tearing apart the darkness that had just a moment before been encroaching my surroundings. \n\nI needed to distract myself. I needed something to do. Something. Anything. What should I do? I frantically searched the room. \n\nMy laptop caught my attention with a passing glance. Back in university, I used to write a lot. Stories. I would write for myself, and I think it helped me. It’s the one thing I can say I was completely confident in. When I was a kid, I wanted to be an author. My parents, friends, and teachers tried to support me in that goal. But like all things, it faded away, until I got to university. I had some reignition of motivation, then. \n\nWhenever I was going through something, I wrote. It helped me a lot, putting my thoughts into a story, my experiences. It was therapeutic, and deeply personal. I do wonder whatever happened to that.\n\nI… I wish—\n\nPart of me wants to feel that way again. \n\nIn a sudden burst of motivation that I did not take for granted, I crawled over to my laptop, opening the device slowly, dramatically, like a suitcase full of gold. \n\nThe blank screen contemplated me, compassionately, like an old friend, wanting to do everything they could to help. \n\nI held the power button.\n\nIt was dead. \n\nA slow, methodic creak interrupted the still room. \n\nI closed my laptop slowly. Defeated. Shaking. \n\nA folding chair, open, loomed over me. A blurry shadow hovered above it. Its form continuously shifted into familiar and unfamiliar shapes. Its head was crooked. Its neck snapped. It stared down at me, peering into my very being. Confronting me once again.\n\n“What do you want to do now?” It asked.",

Thank you for taking the time to come in. I know that after what’s happened, you must be in need of some time to yourself, so I really appreciate it… How are you feeling today?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Graham:** I’m fine… How’s Dallas…? Did you hear anything?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Interviewer:** He’ll be alright. I can’t promise a miraculous recovery given the extent of his injuries, but you’ll be able to speak with him very soon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Graham:** Really? H… He’s gonna be okay?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Interviewer:** He’s been taken care of by the very best, I can assure you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Graham:** Oh thank God… I thought… Jesus Christ… When can I see him? Today? When?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Interviewer:** I can arrange something after we’re done here. But… Business first. We need to understand what happened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Graham:** Right, right… Sorry… \\[Pause\\] Where should we begin?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Interviewer:** With Malibu, Mr. Dalton. Why don’t we start with what you and Dallas Wood were doing in Malibu. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Graham:** We were on vacation. Taking some overdue time off, y’know? We’d just finished a job in Vegas, we wanted to spend New Years on a beach getting drunk. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Interviewer:** Ah, I can’t blame you. Sounds like fun.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Graham:** Yeah, it was… \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Interviewer:** So the incident. Walk me through what happened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Graham:** Yeah. Happy to… Dallas and I had been out for the night, having some drinks, hitting a few clubs. Just sorta living it up, right? Anyways. We’d been talking to these girls at a bar, and we’d really been hitting it off. We were talking about bar hopping together, seeing where the night led us, you know?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Interviewer:** I see.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Graham:** One of the girls, Shauna… She’d suggested karaoke. She knew a place. Never actually done karaoke before. I ain’t much of a singer but like, I thought it sounded like fun. So I said ‘what the hell?’ And I talked Dallas into coming with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Interviewer:** And the karaoke bar… Angels. This was where you met the vampire, right?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Graham:** Yeah. I remember he’d actually been up singing when we got there. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Interviewer:** Can you describe him?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Graham:** Tall, long blond hair. He was really getting into it too. Dancing around and everything. He sorta had a ‘vampire’ look to him. You know what I’m talking about, right? I mean, we’ve been in this business for long enough. It’s not that hard to recognize a vampire. Pale skin, flashy style, the whole nine yards. This guy looked like he’d walked off the cover of a romance novel. He was wearing this white button down shirt that was half open, and I’d say about two thirds of that bar were already fucking him with their eyes… I got the vibe he was looking for attention. I know that Dallas clocked him the moment we walked in. I mean, you hunt monsters for long enough and you can’t really turn that part of your brain off, so…\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Interviewer:** Don’t I know it… So the vampire, he didn’t interact with you at first?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Graham:** No. We sat at the bar, had some drinks with the girls and watched them go up and take their turns singing. I remember seeing the vampire talking to a bunch of women nearby, and Dallas was keeping a pretty close eye on him… Probably looking for some indicator that he was trying to get them alone to feed… Like I said, can’t really turn that part of your brain off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Interviewer:** Did Dallas have any issues with vampires?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Graham:** No, no. Nothing like that. I remember that he said to me that this guy had sort of a bad vibe to him though… Like… Okay. I know that most vampires just take what they need and leave. They don’t kill anyone. They’re not that dangerous or anything. But Dallas and I have been hunting the dangerous ones long enough to know the warning signs. This guy was… He was really touchy. Kept putting his hands all over the women, even if it was obvious some of them weren’t into it. A few of them even outright left after he started making them uncomfortable. The others just sorta stuck around for the free drinks. This guy just kept them coming. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Interviewer:** I see. So just to clarify, you two were suspicious of the vampire, correct?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Graham:** Yeah, a little bit. Like I said, he was sketchy. But we didn’t really say or do anything until later since he didn’t seem to be doing anything. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Interviewer:** Right.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Graham:** The girls we’d been with sang for a bit. They got me to get up for a little while, although Dallas was still too shy. Still… We were having a good time and everything like, nothing was that out of place… Dallas was still watching that vampire and he’d noticed he was talking to this one girl, and they sorta seemed like they were getting ready to leave.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Interviewer:** And that was when Dallas approached him?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Graham:** Yeah. I don’t think he was looking to start a fight or anything. I think it was just more of a friendly warning, like: *“Hey, we know what you are and we’re watching you.”* Sorta to keep him on his best behavior, you know?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Interviewer:** Can you explain why you thought that was necessary?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Graham:** Like I said, we’ve dealt with enough vampires to know when one is probably bad news. This guy checked every single fucking box. As far as Dallas knew, he was about to save that poor girls life. And once I saw what he was doing, I went along with him. We were casual. Asked him how long he and that girl had known each other, made it clear we knew what he was. Made it clear we were watching him. The girl had no idea… Although she was drunk out of her fucking mind, which was also kinda red flag…\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Interviewer:** So the vampire, what did he do?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Graham:** He just kept smiling as we talked to him. He was… Casual… And not all that subtle. He asked if we worked for the FRB. We said yes. He said he’d heard we had a new Director. Asked if it was true Robert Marsh was running ths how now… The way he asked, I sorta got the impression that he knew him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Interviewer:** What did you tell him?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Graham:** We didn’t lie to him if that’s what you’re asking. We told him that Marsh was running the show now. I mean that’s not exactly private information.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Interviewer:** Relax. I’m not accusing you of anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Graham:** Sorry… Right…\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Interviewer:** Did he say anything else?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Graham:** Not much. He asked us a few questions about what it was like working for the FRB. It was a little weird, actually. Then he said he ‘admired how brave we were’. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Interviewer:** Any idea what that meant?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Graham:** I dunno… Maybe it was a threat? I dunno…\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Interviewer:** What happened next?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Graham:** Dallas… I mean, okay. It was obvious at this point that this guy wasn’t hiding jack shit. So I guess Dallas decided there was no point in hiding jack shit. He’d leaned in and he’d asked the vampire if we were going to have any problems. And the vampire just sorta laughed and said: *“No problems at all.”* Then he… \\[Pause\\] \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Interviewer:** Mr. Dalton, what happened next?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Graham:** He asked us if we could deliver a message to Director Marsh for him… Then he… He put a hand on Dallas’s shoulder and he… He… \\[Pause\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Interviewer:** Mr. Dalton… What did the vampire do to Dallas Wood?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Graham:** He ripped him… He just… Pulled him apart… Like paper… He just… He popped the top half of Dallas off from the bottom and I… Oh God… The way he screamed… I saw… I saw the skin stretching… I saw his… His guts… I saw them spilling out and Dallas was screaming and the vampire just… Just tossed him away. He just… Tossed the top half of Dallas to the ground and he was still alive and he was screaming and his guts were… They were all over the ground… Then everyone else started screaming. At first, I thought it was because of what he’d done to Dallas but… It wasn’t.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Interviewer:** What was happening?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Graham:** He’d raised his hand… The vampire. And he was doing something to them… The other people in the bar, they were screaming and they were bleeding… It was coming out of their eyes, their ears, their noses, their mouths. One girl beside us, she just… She keeled over and she just started vomiting up blood and when she did, I watched it… I watched it move towards him. Like a river. All the blood from all those people… It just… Pooled around him and he just sort of took it in. Everywhere I looked, people were dying and Dallas was still screaming… I saw him trying to… Trying to put his own guts back into his body but he couldn’t… And God… I don’t know how the hell he survived that… Oh God…\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Interviewer:** What did you do, Dalton?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Graham:** What did I do? What the fuck could I have done! I wasn’t armed! I wasn’t carrying my gun, we were fucking bar hopping! And this fucking thing… It was bleeding everyone in the goddamn building dry and Dallas was dying! I thought he was good as dead and I… I just… I ran… I ran for the door, ran outside and I didn’t fucking stop!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Interviewer:** I see… So you left your best friend, and all those innocent people to their fate?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Graham:** What else could I have done? I’d just watched him take Dallas apart with his bare fucking hands! The only reason I wasn’t already dead is because he didn’t kill me! *What else was I supposed to do?!*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Interviewer:** Calm down, Mr. Dalton.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Graham:** No I won’t fucking calm down! Do you have *any* idea how fucking shitty I feel, knowing I couldn’t save those people? Do you have any idea how terrified I am to have to look Dallas in the eye, knowing I left him for dead? He was my best fucking friend and I left him with that thing! I… I just left him to die… He wouldn’t have fucking done that to me! So don’t tell me to fucking calm down! You weren’t there! You didn’t see what I saw!

        "text": "Yesterday I did something I never, ever thought I’d do on purpose. Look, say what you will about my dumb decisions, but at least I don’t generally put myself in life-threatening situations *intentionally.* Historically, they’re due to me accidentally [jumping](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10etgxr/black_blood_the_bar_at_the_edge_of_reality_part_7/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), and my dumb choices only occur before or after that.\n\nBut yesterday, I made perhaps the stupidest choice of all, and definitely a life-threatening one: I, on purpose, went to the dark forests.\n\nThat’s right. I didn’t even jump there. I snuck out of [Griffin's Edge](https://www.griffinsedgebar.com/) in the morning, while Henri was still asleep, and passed through the fog while vaguely picturing the edges of the dark forest, by the icy plains where I’d met Jacian. I wasn’t even sure how well it would work—traveling through gaps in reality is never an exact science, and as far as I know, I’m the first to ever go to the dark parts of Neverland intentionally. Would reality even *want* to bend enough to let me through?\n\nYes. Apparently the answer was yes, because I found myself on the very border between a snowstorm and a wall of dark, twisted trees as easily as if I’d been traveling to Florida. \n\nI’m not ashamed to say that I faltered slightly when I stared at those woods and heard the growls within. Sure, I’d been lying awake every night since my reunion with the pale kid, seeing him every time I closed my eyes, burning with questions and wondering if maybe he’d have some answers. Sure, seeking him out had seemed like the best option an hour ago. But now I was having second thoughts—I mean, I’d nearly died almost every time I’d ended up in that forest.\n\nLuckily, there really wasn’t much of a decision, because suddenly the cold wind behind me seemed to whistle harder, and I swear I heard giggling on the breeze. “Oh, *hell* no,” I muttered, stepping into the trees. \n\nLike I said, I’ve never actually *entered* the dark forests from outside before; I always just show up in the middle of them somewhere. So I didn’t really know how close I was to where I’d met the pale kid last time. But, I don’t know, he seemed like was keeping tabs on me. I kind of figured *he’d* find *me* before I had to worry about finding him.\n\nI pushed my way through dense undergrowth and gnarled branches, wincing as thorns sliced through my sleeves and the skin beneath. Growls and hisses continued from all directions. “Oh yeah, just wander into the place that’s almost killed you countless times over ten years, that’s a *brilliant* idea,” I told myself under my breath. \n\nApparently the forest did not like my sarcasm, because I swear the noises from the undergrowth got louder and angrier. Cursing, I pulled out Sgrios and considered if it was worth yelling out in hopes of attracting the pale kid to me. Half a second later, I chided myself for even considering it; I would likely only attract the *wrong* attention. Besides, I didn’t know his name, or even if he had one. What would I yell? *Hello, guy who sits in trees and saves me once every ten years! I want to find you before something else finds and tries to eat me! Please come out!*\n\nNo thank you. I’ve looked like enough of an idiot in these woods already.\n\nBut that really only left me with the option of wandering aimlessly and hoping for the best. Which had seemed like a better idea while I was lying awake at 4 AM.\n\n“Alright, if you’re really keeping an eye on me, this would be a great time to prove it,” I muttered as I shoved past a wall of thorny brambles. I watched as the blood from the scratches they caused dissolved before my eyes, seemingly sucked into the bush itself. It was…drinking my blood, I think. “A vampire bush,” I said in disgust, making a face as it drew more of my blood. “Not cool.”\n\nI was so occupied with beating around the bush—literally—that I didn’t pay enough attention to where I was walking. You’d think I would have learned, considering how many times I’ve been grabbed at by roots or tripped over my own feet in the mud and leaves. But the ground was relatively smooth and steady under my feet—no roots—so the bush was more of a priority.\n\nUntil suddenly I stepped…and felt a weird wet, sucking sensation as the ground swallowed my foot. Almost immediately, my other foot followed, and before I could even register what was happening, I realized that I was standing *in the ground* up to my calves.\n\nI cursed and looked down to see that a patch of dirt around me, perhaps a few feet in diameter, was actually glittery black sand. Sand that was rapidly swallowing me, dragging me down into the earth like quicksand. But it wasn’t ordinary quicksand, because as I tried to struggle, I realized that the perimeter of the sand circle was shifting, almost collapsing over itself, and out of the tumultuous sand emerged a ring of jagged teeth.\n\nThat’s right. Like half of this godforsaken forest, the sand was alive and carnivorous. Should have known.\n\nAs I continued to thrash—I was now up to my thighs—eyes appeared in the ground by the sand mouth. Big dark eyes that stared at me with a hungry glint as the thing continued to swallow me.\n\nLook, I’d never heard of this creature before, but I had my usual weapons, plus Henri’s additions. *Something* had to work. \n\nI slashed at the eyes with Sgrios, trying to move my hips enough to get some leverage and reach them. Unfortunately, that proved nearly impossible: the sand had reached my waist, and I couldn’t feel or move any of my lower body. Still, I managed to get in one good swipe, and the sand vibrated around me as it growled in anger.\n\nToo much of my body was in the sand; I couldn’t reach the eyes anymore. I cursed and reached into my pocket for my lighter, thanking myself mentally for at least putting the lighter in my breast pocket and not my jeans today, since everything on my belt was already lost to the sand.\n\nI flicked it open, holding the small flame as close to the black sand around my waist as possible without touching it. The creature screamed, its mouth convulsing, the downward motion momentarily stopping. I waved the lighter over its surface, breathing a tiny sigh of relief as I sat there, encased up to my ribs but no longer sinking deeper.\n\n“Don’t like fire, huh?” I said, continuing to wave the small flame as the ground trembled and shrieked around me. Still, I glanced around doubtfully. Maybe if I kept it in pain, I could reach the edge and haul myself out of the sand? “At least I’ve lengthened the problem,” I muttered.\n\nNot enough, though. Suddenly a tendril of black sand leapt upwards like a living vine—right onto the flickering fire of the lighter. It immediately went out, sending a tiny tendril of smoke winding upwards.\n\n“Damn it,” I spit out, frantically trying to get the lighter to relight as the downward sinking resumed with a hungry growl. But glittering black grains of sand clogged the lighter, and not so much as a spark appeared despite my repeat attempts.\n\nUp to my armpits now. God, I should’ve grabbed the pistol quicker, before it had been swallowed by the sand along with my legs. Instead I scrabbled for the teeth around the edge, managing to wrap my hand around one and pulling as hard as I could when I had absolutely no leverage or surface to push against.\n\nTurns out, that’s not very hard. I yanked, but my grip slipped off the tooth. I cursed loudly again. My only hope now, I guess, was to let it swallow me, then try to fight my way up once I was in the sand. \n\nUnless I got saved again. Which, as much as I hated to admit, was a lot more appealing than letting my head go under.\n\n“You know how I said earlier that it would be a great time to prove you’re watching me?” I shouted as the sand reached my neck, straining to keep my face above the glittering sand. “Well, this would be an even *better* time!”\n\nNo sign of any mysterious saviors. I took the deepest breath of air I could muster and braced myself for going under the surface. \n\nJust as black sand began to clog my nostrils—as bad as I expected, and yet somehow worse, because it *burned—*fire exploded in the clearing. The sand shivered and shook as the thing screamed; flames filled my eyes as they swept over me. I had once again paused where I was, with only the upper half of my face out of the sand…and while that was better than being swallowed up completely, I now realized that I couldn’t breathe.\n\nI fought to get my chin back up as my mouth opened instinctively, allowing black sand to fill my throat. It was thick and *sharp* somehow, and I wasn’t even getting enough air to sputter; it was almost like a solid thing, blocking my throat as completely as if I’d swallowed a massive rock.\n\n*This sucks,* I thought fleetingly as my vision blackened at the edges. *I’m gonna die right before getting rescued, with only my eyes visible, by mere suffocation. If only I’d called out for him twenty seconds earlier, then I’d still be able to breathe!*\n\nBut suddenly I was being pulled upwards by a surprisingly strong force, my body slowly pushing past the resistance of the sand. I was dropped onto the ground, and though I saw flashes of fire behind me, I was too busy choking up sand to pay much attention. I coughed violently, rolling over onto my stomach and spitting thick black sand onto the forest floor.\n\nIt felt like five minutes of coughing before my throat was fully clear, though there were still stray grains on the roof of my mouth. As I took several deep gulps of air, I flipped back over onto my back and watched the fire die down around me.\n\nSomeone crouched down by my head, and I looked up to see—who else?—the pale kid. He looked extremely amused. “Three for three. And this time you even asked.”\n\nI grunted as I slowly sat up. “I would have been fine.”\n\nHe actually laughed out loud. “You’ve gotta stop saying that. You haven’t been right once.”\n\nNow that I was somewhat upright and breathing normally, I was able to see what he’d done. The ground where the eyes had been was completely scorched, leaving only circles of ash. And the pit of black sand was smoldering, somehow looking singed and dead despite the fact that it had been black to begin with. And just behind the boy was a flamethrower, its surface etched with intricate runes that I didn’t recognize.\n\nI wanted to protest, but he was right. Honestly, I was grateful and even kind of excited to see him. “Well, thank you,” I said. “For this time, and the first two. I don’t think I ever thanked you properly.”\n\nHe sat back on his heels, considering me, his dark eyes thoughtful. “You didn’t.”\n\nFeeling slightly awkward, I stumbled to my feet—I was still a little unsteady as the numbness faded—and he followed. Both of us were silent for a long moment, staring at each other. I’d wanted to talk to him desperately, and yet, now I had no idea where to start.\n\nLuckily, he went first. “So why *did* you call me this time?”\n\nI shrugged, trying to sound nonchalant, like I hadn’t been lying awake for an entire week burning with questions. “I was looking for you.”\n\nHe raised his eyebrows. “You…were wondering around the dark forest looking for me?”\n\nWell, this was embarrassing. He was judging me crazy hard, and honestly, I couldn’t blame him. In hindsight, it *had* been a pretty dumb idea. Who’s to say he even knew anything that could help me? I mean, he’d *seemed* like he might, but that didn’t mean anything. Risking my life to meet with him again hadn’t been my best move. I looked at the ground, hoping I wasn’t blushing. “Yeah.” He didn’t laugh again, and after a moment I raised my eyes to see that he was smiling. “What? You didn’t want to laugh at that one?”\n\nHe shrugged, still with this tiny grin on his face. “I mean, it was stupid, but no one’s ever sought me out before. It’s not like there’s a lot of company here. I don’t know, it’s kind of…nice.”\n\n“Oh,” I said. More silence. \n\n*Well, this is good!* I told myself. *If he’s lonely, he probably wants to talk!* I stuck out my hand. “After saving me three times, you probably deserve to know my name. It’s Ian.”\n\nHe glanced down at my hand; the moment before he took it seemed infinite. But finally, he reached out and grasped it with his own black-gloved hand, his grip surprisingly strong. “Asher.”\n\n*Asher.* I turned the name over in my head. It fit him, I think. Regardless, it was nice to think of him as something other than ‘the pale kid.’ “Nice to meet you, officially,” I said. \n\nHe was still grinning, a real genuine smile that made his black eyes sparkle. “You too.” His hand dropped, and he stuck them both in his pockets. “So why were you looking for me?”\n\n“Oh,” I said for the second time in five minutes. I had so many questions, but the biggest was which one to begin with. What did he know about me? Why had he reappeared now, after ten years? Did he know anything about the murders? Why was he so interested in me? What *was* he? He was so different from all the other monsters of these forests. \n\nIt occurred to me as all of these thoughts swirled wildly in my head that I still didn’t know anything about him. He could be just as carnivorous as the rest of these monsters. He could have some connection to the murders. I had to play it safe until I knew what he knew. \n\nAnd yet, my brain apparently did not connect to my mouth, because what came out was not the carefully-cautious response I’d intended. Instead, I found myself blurting out, “I have a problem that I hope you can help with. A few, actually.”\n\nHe seemed mildly surprised. “You thought…*I* could help?”\n\nToo late to back out now. I mean, I hadn’t meant to say it, but it *was* true. I’d run out of options; even Henri and his ancient friends didn’t know anything about the murders. But Asher had shown up again as they started, so maybe he had some connection. At the very least, he might know something about *me* and what I was and why I jump between dimensions, if our previous conversations supplied any indications. \n\nI took a deep breath. “Yeah. I still do. Please. If you can’t help, I promise I’ll leave you alone afterwards. Well, as best as I can. I won’t search you out on purpose, anyway. No guarantees on accidentally showing up here.”\n\nGod, I was rambling. Hadn’t meant to say that either. But Asher tilted his head, staring at me thoughtfully. After a long moment, he nodded. “Okay.”\n\nMy heartbeat quickened. “*Okay* what?”\n\nHe smirked. “*Okay,* I’ll try to help you.”\n\n“Great!” I said, thoughts swirling even faster as if they were spinning down a shower drain. “So I—”\n\n“No,” he interrupted. “Not here.”\n\nI looked around at the smoldering remains of the sandpit, the gnarled trees, and the vampire bush behind us, which I could *swear* was whispering for more blood. I shuddered. “I’d love to do this somewhere else, but I kind of assumed you don’t leave the forest. I mean, if you do, my uncle runs a bar called—”\n\n“No,” he interrupted again, eyebrows raised. “I *don’t* leave the forest. But there’s nicer places in it than here.”\n\nI couldn’t keep the surprise out of my voice. “There are?”\n\nHe chuckled. “You didn’t think I just lived in the knotty branches, did you?”\n\nI guess I *had* thought that. Oh no. Was I being rude? *Don’t offend inhuman beings, Ian, you idiot!* “I’m…sorry?”\n\nHe stared at me for a long moment, expression stony, before breaking into a grin. “I don’t blame you. Despite your frequent visits here, it’s clear you’re not from these forests. You’d be a lot more competent if you were.”\n\nI started to protest, but he simply rolled his eyes and grabbed my arm. “Yeah, yeah, I know, ‘you would have been fine.’” He raised his voice to mimic me, which I didn’t think was entirely fair, because my voice was *not* that high or squeaky. “But I want to get away from here before something is attracted to the smell of smoke, so you can be indignant on the way. Come on.”\n\nBefore I could protest, he grabbed me by the arm, his grip tight. And suddenly everything faded into darkness; I felt air rushing past us, saw flickering shadows moving in the dark, heard growls and whispers from somewhere in the distance. It was like we were flying and crawling through a cave all at once, though my body wasn’t actually moving, and the only lifeline I had was Asher—who I couldn’t even see in the darkness. I knew he was there because I felt his hand on my arm, but that was the only sign. I saw nothing but shifting shadows. It was deeply unnerving.\n\n“Almost there,” Asher’s voice whispered, both in my ear and echoing around us. “Breathe.”\n\nI gulped in stale, dark air. The shadows sped up, moving faster in the blanket of darkness, until suddenly they were gone, and the not-much-brighter surroundings of dark trees were visible once again. \n\nImmediately, I felt nauseous, and I twisted to the side to empty my stomach. “That was *way* worse than traveling between dimensions,” I groaned, still bent at the waist. \n\nAsher released his grip from my arm. “Sorry,” he said behind me. “I’ve never taken someone along before. I thought you’d be fine.”\n\n“I *am* fine,” I insisted, slowly straightening up. “A warning would have been nice, though.”\n\nHe smirked. “Noted. I’ll warn you before we shadow travel next time.”\n\n“I don’t know about next time,” I said, though my conviction trailed off as I finally began to look around. We were still in the dark forests, there was no doubt about that, but we were now standing in a…town? Houses and buildings made of knotted, black wood sprawled ahead of us, built between and in some cases incorporated into the surrounding trees. Amidst those houses, beings who looked like Asher­—pale skin, dark hair, dark clothing—walked and interacted freely, just like any other street in any other town.\n\nThat is, they *had* been, only now every single one of them stopped and stared at us. Well, at *me.* Each of them looked like an ivory statue, expressions as hard and stony as their frozen bodies. And though I’ve felt different from everyone I’ve known my entire life, I’d never felt so out of place as that moment. \n\nAsher chuckled awkwardly and put a hand on my shoulder. “Welcome to Oasis, my home.”\n\n“Oasis?”\n\n“It’s kind of a joke,” he explained. “Because it’s our haven in the middle of the endless—NO! Stop!” \n\nHe sounded completely panicked, and something dark flashed in my peripheral vision, approaching form behind; that’s all I saw. I tried to turn to defend myself, but I wasn’t quick enough. \n\nSuddenly strong hands were at my throat, and the world went black.",

        "text": "Ok, I don't really know how to start this so I will start from the beginning. \n\nYesterday I woke up as usual, but I felt odd and had a bit of a weird headache. It was a bit like the starting of a migraine or the result of a heavy night out, so after I had a shower to wake up I made my way downstairs to the kitchen to make a cup of tea and get some tablets. Whilst in the kitchen I saw my wife 'Chloe' who kissed me goodbye and said she had a nice night with everyone yesterday but had to run as she was late to work. I kissed her back and said goodbye, but something irked me about her, the way she spoke. She wasn't rude or sarcastic, or anything like that, she was just very ... pleasant. Like a posh Disney character. Even when she was long gone, I didn't move, I just sat at the table, the pain in my head slowly getting worse. Looking around, the kitchen was familiar, but I also knew it was both ‘’wrong” and ‘right' at the same time. There was a chip on the table, and I knew that was from when we moved in, we hit it on the front door. However, when I really started to think about the chip in the table, I knew that I didn't have a beach kitchen table, even though I was looking right at it. My head started throbbing at that point, like the more I was thinking about things the worse the pain was getting. I didn't know what to do and was freaking out that deep down I knew I didn't have a kitchen table but then again, I knew it was chipped on moving day. It didn't make sense. \n\nThe back and forth of trying to justify this kitchen table, the one I was sitting at, made my head spin. So much so, that I thought oh my god, this is it, I'm going to die alone in this kitchen. I wondered about calling someone, an ambulance or my wife, but as I looked at my phone and saw the lock screen, it all just hit me. \n\nI didn't belong here.\n\nThis wasn't my house,\n\n'Chloe' definitely wasn't my wife.\n\nI don't drink tea.\n\nI definitely didn’t have a beach kitchen table.\n\nI ran to look outside to try and find some sort of familiarity, a clue as to what happened last night, and why I was there. I opened the front door to see a postman about to post some letters through the door. Confused, I just stood looking at him, he tutted, handed me some letters and left to go to the neighbour. I was starting to panic because before I went to sleep the night before, I was at a party at my apartment in Boston. I scanned the whole street, and it was nothing like I’d seen before. All these houses joined together going from left to right. They looked identical, all of them, just there. One thing that stuck out was how nice the weather was, it was blue skies and sunny. Again, I remembered it snowing last night.\n\nI didn't know what to do at this point so I walked back indoors, in bewilderment. How could this not be my life? Why was I remembering a completely different version of myself? I thought that it could’ve just been a vivid dream and I was probably hungover from the night before. But that feeling didn’t shift. \n\nI noticed I still had some letters in my hand and as I made my way back into the kitchen I had a look at them. I'm not going to give you any personal details but after reading the names and the address of where I was, that’s when I knew I didn’t belong. The address listed in the letters was London. I have never been to London in my whole life, the only place I’ve been is within the US. How could I possibly be in the UK? \n\nI could feel myself starting to hyperventilate, and all I could think was, how could this be possible?\n\nMy last memory of the night before I woke up, I had a gathering at my place, now I live in a decent area of Boston, around Back Bay and there’s a communal rooftop terrace. It was windy and snowing a bit by the evening, the weather had been a mixture of sun and rain all day, but I wanted a smoke so I took my jacket and made my way to the terrace. No one was there and even though it was fucking cold, I always admired the view. This is where things get a bit hazy, I was getting colder and colder as I only had my jacket on, I didn’t expect to be up there long but something grabbed my attention along the railing. I can’t even remember what it was exactly but I made my way over to the edge of the rooftop. The wind was picking up some more, but still, I leaned over the railing to pick up this ‘thing’ that I still cannot remember what it was, and someone yelled ‘need any help there’. It frightened me as I thought I was the only one on the terrace. I said I was fine and I thought they had left. Now, I have to say that I had been drinking, it was my party after all, but I felt this weird presence come over me. Like a big dark weight pushing down on me. I felt a little breathless but I wasn’t thinking straight, I was so focused on picking this thing up. I remember my fingers brushing the item as it was teetering on the edge when I heard a voice right by my ear telling me, ‘you shouldn’t do that.’\n\nTo tell you it scared the shit out of me, would be an understatement. It felt like my whole world just fell from my feet. I could feel the scream build up in the pit of my stomach ready to belt out. Then everything went black. \n\nThat's the last thing I remember before waking up. And now I'm here in this life that I know isn’t mine. \n\nNo matter how many times I try to wrap my head around it I just can’t understand how this is all happening. Am I having a mental health crisis, is this my life, did I fall into an alternate dimension? Did I have an intense dream? \n\nAfter looking at the letters I decided maybe I should have a look around to see if there was anything to indicate why I was there. The strange thing was no matter what I looked at or where I searched, I could recall the memories behind each of these things. Like the little seagull magnet on the fridge of the day we went to Brighton and we knew we just had to buy it because our chips had been taken by seagulls earlier that day. How only nights ago we played Mario on the switch and because I won I threw popcorn all over the living room - there were still stray pieces between the cushions. The numerous trinkets, mementoes and memories of all these things me and ‘Chloe’ have ever done together and evidence of whole lives lived. The more I looked at these things, went through my wardrobe and saw my life laid out in front of me, the more I could remember the current life I was in. \n\nI finally started to think to myself that maybe I had drunk too much or had some sort of brain episode that made me disassociate from my current life. I decided that maybe getting some fresh air might help me. This is where things get weirder. Even though I had calmed down a bit I was still on edge, a strangeness still irking deep inside me, telling me I didn't belong. No matter where I looked I just could not find my wallet anywhere. I looked in my pants (both ones I'm wearing and dirty ones), drawers, the kitchen, everywhere so I decided, what the hell I'm only going for a walk, why do I need it? Plus I had my phone if I needed it. I leave the house and as I start walking there's a familiarity with where I am. Like, I know around the corner there will be a newsagent and further, down the street, there’s a small field that I used to jog around. Honestly the more I was taking in my surroundings and thinking of the gathering we had with our friends, the more I was starting to feel relaxed and normal. Until I got my phone out (again with the phone). \n\nI saw that there was a missed call and a voicemail that had been left from the night before, I didn’t notice it the first time I got my phone out earlier that morning after freaking out. I debate listening to it as I'm awaking around the park. Half of me knows that I used to jog here because I remember falling and cutting my leg up one winter morning about a year ago. I still have the scar. But half of me knows this is all wrong, that I shouldn't be able to remember these things. I looked down again, saw the picture of Chloe and clicked the voicemail. I wish I didn't click it. I wish I just pretended that I was having a bad day but I needed to know what was on that voicemail. A chill ran down my spine as I clicked on it, I can’t explain why, like it was wrong for me to be listening. \n\nI'm still shaken by the message but here it is:\n\n‘Where the hell are you? I’ve looked everywhere for you. You’re missing your own party man. I came up to the terrace and couldn’t find you, did you run out of smokes?…. come on call me back when you can. ‘\n\nAll of a sudden I got a barrage of texts from unknown numbers asking where I am and if I'm ok? That they can’t believe I had just vanished from my own home, my party. \n\nThe more I was reading the more my chest started to feel tight. I was sweating and my mind was racing. I realised after a few minutes I was standing dead still in the middle of the field. What made me look around was the absence of any sound or movement. It was as if the earth had stood still, not a bird or plane in the sky, not one person walking their dog, I couldn't even hear a single car which is fucking weird because I knew there was a busy main road only a few blocks away. Before I could think anymore about how quiet it was my phone started ringing. I didn’t recognise the number but I answered it despite my heart hammering in my chest. I said hello and was met with static that made me recoil from the phone, I said hello again and it was silent. I was about to hang up when I heard a whisper in the background. I could barely hear it at first but then as I listened carefully I could hear bits of a conversation. It was so jumbled up, going from panic to calm, static to silence. The most I got out of it was; ‘where are you….. I heard what happened please call me …. Party …. What the … “After several beats of silence I heard a voice I instantly recognised. ‘You shouldn’t be doing this.’ As soon as those words registered in my ear, it felt as if a ton of bricks had hit me. I collapsed into the wet grass, my insides tearing up so much I vomited. I couldn’t move for what felt like forever. My hands and knees were soaked, my forehead sweaty, back drenched. \n\nAll I could think was that I needed to get back home but where was my 'home' because this certainly wasn’t it? My vision started to tunnel and I knew I needed to move, even if I did get back 'home' at least I could search online for what happened. As I stumbled to my feet, I looked at my phone and it was black, completely dead even though moments before it was fine and fully charged. I put it back in my pocket and felt that there was something else in there. I mean it couldn't get any fucking weirder but there was the wallet I had searched high and low for just before I came out, nestled where my phone just was. My whole body was screaming at me not to look at it but I did. It was my wallet, with my ID. My Massachusetts driver's licence with my photo, address and all my information on it. \n\nI don’t know how I got back to my ‘house’, everything felt like a blur. I still don’t know how to even comprehend the last 48 hours. I think I must’ve passed out or something because I woke up around 2 am this morning in bed with my ‘wife’ beside me. \n\nNothing seems real. Everything feels wrong and I still feel sick to my stomach. But seeing that ID made me realise, I can't be making this up. I don’t belong here. However, every time I try to think deeper about my 'past' life, more of it seems to be fading away. I know where I used to live and I know it's real (I looked on google) but when I think of my job and my home, I automatically think of my London life first, before my Boston one. \n\nI bailed out of a ‘family gathering’ today, I said I didn’t feel well and it's not technically a lie but I've been losing my mind since I woke up in the early hours. I don’t even know how I am supposed to talk anymore - as you've all probably gathered by now. Am I American or British? That's one of the questions nagging at me. Certain words seem fluent to me whilst others don't.\n\nBefore my wife left this morning, I asked her if there was anything different about me or my wallet and she looked confused. She said I lost my wallet last week because we had to cancel all the cards and order a new driver's licence. She then laughed at me and said that I'm probably still recovering from how much I had to drink on Friday…\n\nBefore any of you ask. \n\nThe wallet is now gone, again, and I'm just at a loss as to what the fuck to do. \n\nAm I losing my mind? \n\nDo you know who I am? Was you at my party on Friday? What happened to me?",

        "text": "  \n\nRussian roulette story\n\nI am writing this from a coffee shop in Los Angeles. I changed my identity, my job, my house, the city where I live....everything. I just bought a plane ticket to Romania, where nobody will know me. \n\nIt all started exactly 15 days ago, in my office. I was working for a big company that was producing robots. I was bored as hell because my life wasn't fun at all. I was making the same things again and again. I almost went crazy because of this routine. You know what the definition of dementia is... Making the same things every day expecting something different. \n\n\"What am I doing with my life ?!\", I asked myself. So I had this idea in my head like a bomb that affected my whole brain: \"I want to have some fun.\" I searched for a few hours on the internet for what to do,when a notification just appeared on my computer. \n\n\"Are you tired of doing the same things? If yes, come and just sign up to compete in a simple game of luck. The winner gets 20000 dollars.\"\n\nWithout thinking twice, I accessed the page and was redirected to a chat with an anonymous guy that turned out to be the creator of the game. He only wrote a message: \" You're signed up\".\n\nI don't know how, because I didn't introduce any data and there wasn't any form to fill out.\n\nI wasn't happy with my life. That day I realized that this was about to be my last day at the office. I went to my boss and said that I quit my job, so I started to scream at him. I did what every unhappy worker would love do.\n\nBut that night, before I went to bed, I received a message from the creator: \"Come outside”. I looked out the window and there was a van. I only took my phone and my wallet. I was scared, but before I knew it, I was on the street, in front of the van. At that moment, a masked man went out of the vehichle and tranquilized me. \n\nWhen I woke up, I was inside a room with approximately 30 people. I started looking around, without knowing anything. I felt like an asteroid that just hitted Earth. The other people in the room were also confused and they were all having a headache. I think the serum contained something that made us feel like that. \n\nAt that moment a voice started talking through the room's speaker: \" Please arrange yourself in 3 columns. The creator is about to speak to you.”\n\nAfter a few minutes, another masked man came inside the room with 3 soldiers that were fully equipped with guns. I think they both have 1 Glock gun, 1 AK-47, and 1 infantry knife. The manager didn't have any guns or knives. \n\n\" Welcome to the Russian Roulette competition! In this game, you have to compete for 20000 dollars. Now, that you are here, I think you should prey for yourself. Only one of you will survive. I wish you the best of luck and now....let the game begin!\n\nThe adrenaline started flowing inside me. After the announcement, a few of the participants started crying hysterically. My first thought was: \" I just ended my life...\"\n\nAnother two soldiers came behind the 4 columns and we all walked on the corridor. The corridor was full of stairs and colorful doors.\n\nI prayed for myself until we all got on the playing field. At that moment, some soldiers gave us a gun with a bullet inside it. The playing field was like outside, but it wasn't the real outside... The view was painted so well that you could barely make the difference between the reality outside and this room. On the „Playground” were some toys and some slides that ment ironically that we were just „playing”. A light bulb on the wall was red, indicating that you should start spinning the gun's barrel. We were obligated to spin it  until the light went green. \n\nWe were all standing in a big circle. Every one of us where holding the gun to the head of the player that was standing in front of him. I was not feeling comfortable at all with a gun pointed at my brain. Every part of my brain was telling me to turn around and throw the gun from my head away. But...I didn't do that. Some guards were pointing AK-47s at us. \n\nMy hand was shaking and I started to pray one more time. I started worrying about the fact that I would kill someone. Maybe you think why am I worrying about that, but when you are religious,you know that you are never going to be forgiven.\n\nFrom the \"playground's\" speaker, I heard a voice...it was the creator of the game speaking:\" This is the first round of the game. May god forgive your mistakes. Good luck!\"\n\nAt that moment, the light bulb turned yellow, and that meant you had to fire the gun. I closed my eyes, trying not to cry. I fired the gun. When I opened my eyes, the man who was holding the gun to my head was laying now on the floor with his eyes large-opened, full of shock. His head was bleeding. Because of the shock, the man who killed the one behind me took the victim's gun, checked the chamber with the bullet, charged, and shot himself. From that day I tried to believe that suicide will prevent a much worse fate.\n\nI looked around, and counted the dead players: 6 players died. It was very traumatizing to see the dead bodys standing on the floor and the blood that maked the scene look like a massacre. One of the players started shouting: „You are not huemans at all! Why are you doing this?!”. Then, one guard shook his head twoards the angry man. In that moment, two guards came and took the player in another chamber. He started screaming, but as fast as the moment begun, as fast the screams ended. 7 players died. In that night, I could not sleep at all. I wanted to escape from that hell even for one minute, even thought we were sleeping on the floor.\n\nThe next day, I realised that that was probably my last day on Earth. I started praying one more time. We all ate something that the manager wanted to give us: some vegetables and one slice of cheese. I missed my own breakfast: full english breakfast with a cup of hot coffee. But of course, if I had a family, I wasn’t able to tell you this story.\n\nWe were all on the same „playground” as yesterday. Now we are only 23 players left alive. We all took a gun and a bullet. After I charged my gun, I observed that my hand was shaking again. I pointed at the head of the player that was standing in front of me. In that moment, the player turned to me smiling and sayed:” I am glad I was your friend.”\n\n“What was he talking about?” was my first thaught. But when I looked better at his face, I realised that he was my best friend from highschool. His name was Dany. He changed so much in the last 15 years…I didn’t have time to respond to him, because the light bulb turned red, so we all had to spin the gun’s barrel. Soon, the light bulb was yellow, so I closed my eyes and fired. I didn’t want to kill Dany… and I didn’t, and hopefully didn’t got killed as well. I looked around and other 5 players committed suicide with the guns of the dead players. There were another 5 players that were killed on the second round, so there were 10 dead bodies. At the end of the round there were only 13 players left alive. All of ower days were numbered. And even the one who is about to get out alive will die shortly. The stress, trauma and the anxiety will lead to depression or to cancer. After that round, Dany didn’t talk to me or to anybody else. I asked him what was the matter, and could hear from him was: “I killed somebody…”\n\nThe next day was about to be my last day out there. I remember that I had a dream in that night about me getting out of there. I don’t believe in dreams, but I don’t know what to say about this case…\n\nA group of 9 players were standing in a circle talking secretly, holding their shoulders. I went to them and asked what they were doing, and one of them turned around and sayed:”Piss off!” The only two words I could hear were “freedom” and “revolution”.\n\nIn that morning, when the game begun, I wasn’t scared anymore because I was thinking I am going to die. Same routine every morning: go to the “playground”, take a gun and a bullet, charge, spin the barrel and fire. It started to be very boring. So I charged my gun, and when the light bulb turned yellow, I took my gun and fired. Before I realised, the man next to me falled on the ground. Before I knew, the body was laying in a puddle full of blood. I will never be forgiven for this sinn… After the 3rd round was over, the group of 9 people that was talking secretly started shouting:” We want to be free!”. Before they knew, they met the souls of the dead players. Dany wasn’t part of the group that committed suicide. Another 1 died because of my stupid goddamn gun! There were only 2 players alive: me and Dany.\n\nA voice came from the “playground’s” speaker: it announced that we will play a final round in five minutes. Me and Dany looked at each other.\n\nWhen the 5 minutes expired, we both took a gun, this time with 5 bullets. The same voice from the speaker explained the game. We are going to walk 3 steps in opposite directions. On the count of 3, we will turn as fast sa we could and shoot to the other player.\n\nDany came to my and sayed:”I need the money. It’s time for my to defeat you.” That wasn’t The Dany I remembered. In that moment, the fury started boiling in me.\n\nWe each walked 3 steps and we were waiting for the signal. My life was flashing through my life, but i knew I had to finish this once and for all. A sound came through the speaker. I knew that was the signal. I turned around and pointed the gun to his head. I fired but in the same thing jumped away, because he was trying to shoot me. He fired all his bullets, but I realised that I had only one. I couldn’t kill him. He was still my best friend from highschool. I threw the gun away, but in that moment, a guard pointed his AK-47 to his head and fired.\n\nThe next thing I remember is one of the guards holding a tranquilizer and congratulating me for winning 20000 dollars. In that day, I woke up home. My life was finally normal. The prize was sent to my bank-account. I went to Dany’s mother to tell her that he died. I also gave 10000 dollars to her as condolences. I almoast cryed when she asked me if I’ve seen Dany. She suffers from Alzheimer. When I told her that Dany passed on, she cryed. But…after a few minutes she forgot. I didn’t want to create more suffering so I left. From that day I swore that I will never touch a gun again. I think I will meet Dany once in hell. I have to finish writing this article because I have to go to the airport and because the coffee shop is about to close. I am uploading this because I didn’t want to talk about this to anybody.\n\nI hope you will do what’s good for you, stay safe and don’t commit crimes!",

        "text": "Hi, my name is unimportant. I was recently going through my late grandma's house, as we are planning on selling it. Shame, because I like the house, but I can't take it, I'm only 16. Anyway, I found a box of VHS tapes in the basement. The box was hidden in a wall that had progressively broken down over time. The box was labeled \"1978-1990 work tapes - DESTROY IMMEDIATELY -- DO NOT KEEP\" I showed the box to my mom, who had no idea what they were. So I decided to take them home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo here I am at home, I just popped the first VHS tape in. It was labeled 1978-iNTRODUCTION. It had nothing else on it, just those words and numbers. I'll give you the play by play and transcript here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo it starts with a company logo. iCARUS inc. The logo kind of looks like the current day Philadelphia Flyers logo, in that it is a slanted I with wings on the left side. \n\nAs the logo is on screen, a couple synth chords are played, and a cheery robotic woman voice says\n\n\"Icarus Incorporated, we go to the ends of the earth for our customers, even to our detriment!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe titlecard has an unusually long \\~17 second fade to an empty room. Room is generous, this place is as big as a warehouse. A guy walks from behind the camera with a metal folding chair. He walks an unreasonable distance, unfolds the chair, and puts it down. He then sits on the chair. The camera adjusts its position and zooms in on him. Surprisingly, the zoom is really good, I can make out most of his facial features, accounting the low quality of the tape.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe man is good looking and well dressed. he is in a black suit, white undershirt, noticeably dark collar stays I can see through his shirt, blood red tie. Black dress pants, and shoes that clacked on the floor as he walked. He has a 5 oclock shadow and a killer smile that as he looks into the camera. Something is off with his face though, in spite of the low quality I can tell he is smiling with his mouth, but his eyes don't reflect the smile. He is sweating. he begins to speak.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Good morning America and the rest of the world! We here at Icarus Industr-(there is an unintelligible voice from behind the camera)- sorry, Icarus Incorporated have been working on something we are very proud of. After pioneering cordless tools, calculators, and ATMs, we would enjoy announcing our next foray. We have started the engineering of arti-\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI should note, around when the man starts talking about cordless tools, we can hear footsteps walking away from the camera, and as he says \"engineering\", we hear a door open and close. The man takes a large breath, seemingly out of relief. His face gets more serious, and he starts talking again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"America, fuck it, whoever is watching this, you are in danger. My name is M-\\*REDACTED\\*-nson and I don't know how much longer the world will last. If you are watching this in anywhere past 2017 and you are human, you are lucky. I can't explain exactly what I mean right now, there is not enough time, but I promise as you watch these tapes, you will understand. That is, if I am not killed before I get all of these made. Please, if you are watching this, do not keep quiet. Speak out against Icar-\"\n\n(by redacted, I mean literally it was bleeped like he said a curse word)\n\nSuddenly the video cuts to a happy looking reporter who looks like he could be Jon Hamm's brother. He is holding a microphone, but as he is talking, he moves the mic around with no disparity in the volume of his voice. He is on an assembly line, and he starts talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReporter: \"Are-are you recording? Is it-are we live? I swear to god john, I cant-\"\n\nJohn, I guess: \"Damn it marc, we're live!\"\n\nMarc: \"Oh-  Hi, I'm Marcus Vanaman, and you're watching channel 27 news, live on NDMNBC - National Domestic Media News Broadcasting Company! Today, we are on site at Icarus Industries, ready to interview some of the workers that labor tirelessly here to get us what we want!!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMarc and John walk over to one of the assembly line workers. They get the workers attention, who turns around and takes off his ear protection. The worker is the most straight faced person I have ever seen, there is no soul behind those two eyes, and his expression is that of a soldier at attention. His stare at Marc could cut a diamond. I should mention, as the interview goes on, the footage starts to glitch. I'll point it out when it happens.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMarc: \"Good afternoon sir, what is your name?\"\n\nWorker(heavy monotone): \"incorporated.\"\n\nMarc: \"Uh... excuse me?\"\n\nWorker: \"you said iCARUS industries. it is iCARUS incorporated.\"\n\nMarc: \"Oh, I'm sorry, I must have misspoke, heh, though I didn't think you could hear me. Anyway, what is your name?\"\n\nWorker: \"it does not mat-t--t-t-t--t-t--t-t- (A glitch happens as the workers eyes shift from Marc to the camera, causing his eyes to move from marc to the camera back to marc etc) -at my name is (footage returns to normal, but now there is a worker in the background staring directly into the camera) you will not be here much longer.\"\n\nMarc: \"Oh, um, ok? Well, do you like working at Ica-r-rr--r-r--r-r-r-r--r-r-r- (as marc speaks, he raises his arm to scratch his neck, but the footage glitches as his arm reaches his neck, bouncing his arm between his collarbone and neck, as the footage returns to normal, there are now \\~10 workers in the background, staring at the camera) -corporated? Haha, got it right this time, eh?\"\n\nThe worker does not react to his joke\n\nWorker: \"iCARUS incorporated has provided me with opportunities most could only dream of. my entire life has been dedicated to iCARUS from the moment i was created.\"\n\nMarc starts to speak, but the worker swings what I think is a wrench at him, the footage cuts before he makes connection.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe footage cuts back to The Man from the beginning. There are tears down his cheek, and the room he is in is a lot darker. The camera is intensely zoomed on his face, farther in than I thought any camera could. There is a bright red alarm flashing at the back of the room, but there is no audible alarm. The man starts to talk, frantically, desperately. His voice gradually gets more distorted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"PLEASE, PLEASE, THIS IS NOT FAKE, YOU ARE IN DANGER, YOU WILL DIE. THIS IS NOT A JOKE. THEY ARE COMING AFTER ME, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA door opens, slow footsteps approach. Like, really slow footsteps. The Man immediately gets up and starts to run, he trips over his chair, but gets up and continues running. He runs the opposite direction of the camera, the sound of the slow footsteps getting gradually louder. The Man makes it to the back of the room and throws a door open and exits. I finally get to see what is making the footsteps as the camera zooms out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt looks like a man, making intent limping movement. The weird thing is, he's on fire. I don't know what is happening. The guy on fire makes it to the upturned chair, and turns around. I get to see his burned face/skull and his eyes, his inhuman bright red eyes. As the video slowly fades back to the titlecard from the opening, the guy on fire says one word. \"iCARUS\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThose synth chords come back, almost like the cutoff frequency is raised. The cheery robotic lady voice starts taking again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"iCARUS Incorporat-te-te-te-te-ted, please, j-j-j-join us-s-s and follow al-long.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen the tape ends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am shaken up, I have no idea what the fuck I just watched. There are tapes left, I will update you on them, but just give me a little bit of time, I need to process whatever the fuck I saw.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you don't get and update in the next month, well I guess I died according to The Man in the video.",

        "text": "\n\nIt started after my sister disappeared, and I wish I had noticed sooner.\n\nMom tried to tell us, but we didn’t listen. We thought she was crazy, and she was, but she was also correct.\n\nWe should have listened, we should have done something, but it’s too late, and it doesn’t matter anymore.\n\nI’m alone; all I have left are wishes, dreams, and memories. Each is a punishment and a reminder that it started with me and will end with me.\n\nWe moved three years after Marie disappeared from Philly to a rambling farmhouse in the suburbs. It was composed of tilted land and towering trees; our nearest neighbors were deer and far too many bugs.\n\nThe move was long overdue, and we thought it would help us heal, but to mom, it was a betrayal, and she wasn’t wrong, but it was also self-preservation.\n\nWe had to put Marie to rest so we could live. We couldn’t cling to the hope that one day she would turn up at our doorstep and walk in.\n\nMom didn’t talk to dad or me for months. She locked herself in her room, and whenever I saw her, she looked through me.\n\nIt hurt, of course; why wouldn’t it? When I told dad, he sympathized and told me to give her space, but I noticed he would no longer meet my eyes.\n\nI missed my family, and I missed my sister. What could have happened to her? I wish I could shut down my mind. I was tired of hurting every moment of every day, and I was tired of imagining my sister buried under a pile of dirt, waiting for us to find and unearth her bones.\n\n❧\n\n\n\nShe came to me at night, and I could hear her singing from the woods.\n\nShe pressed her palms against my window, leaving imprints surrounded by frost, and when she smiled, her lips quivered, and her eyes shone like starlight.\n\nShe whispered my name throughout the night, and she had so much to say.\n\nShe spoke of enchantments, taught me curses, and sang low and sweet.\n\nIt’s not real, I told myself. You’re being stupid. It’s just the wind and your imagination.\n\nBut the wind doesn’t know my name, and my imagination can’t leave scratches on the window.\n\nI tried to forget. I told myself it had been a dream, and after a while, I convinced myself because the alternative wasn’t possible.\n\nBut then I found Marie’s locket on my windowsill, coated in thick black mud.\n\nShe would have never taken it off, not willingly, and even though I had told myself for years that she was gone, I had repressed the hope but not abandoned it, and now there was no more.\n\nI lost my mind that day.\n\nI ran to the fields and screamed until my throat was raw.\n\nI lay on the itchy grass and stared at the sky, watching it darken and the moon bloom.\n\nThe fields glittered with lightning bugs. I chased and captured them, cupping them in my hand, ripping their wings off, and watching as the glow they held dimmed.\n\nIt made me wonder how long it must have taken Marie to die. If she had just laid there, accepting her fate, feeling the life drain out of her.\n\nI crushed them and stared at the luminescent smear on my palms, then stuck my fingers into my mouth.\n\nI sucked on them.\n\n❧\n\n\n\nIt was my fault that Marie was dead. It had been me who pressured her to go to the party. I knew she didn’t want to go. It wasn’t her thing, but I needed a designated driver.\n\n“It’ll be fun,” I had persuaded. “Are you going to waste the rest of your life watching tv with mom and dad?”\n\nSo she had come, and I smoked and drank and smoked and drank\n\nI passed out, and when I woke up, I had 20 missed calls from Marie and twice as many from my parents.\n\nMy heart dropped into my stomach, and I tried my hardest not to throw it up.\n\nI knew something was wrong, and it was all my fault.\n\nIt was all my fault\n\n❧\n\n\n\nI helped dad around the house because that was the only time he gave me attention.\n\nThe ladder we had was old and terrifying, but he insisted on using it, so I held it still as he cleaned the gutters.\n\nI stood in his shadow, feeling sick. I imagined him falling and cracking his head open at my feet. His brain spilling, and his eyes weeping blood.\n\nI was relieved when he finally descended, but the thought of his mangled body had never left me.\n\nI dreamt of Marie that night. She stood in the corner of my room, looking at me. Her hair was tangled and full of bugs and earth, and her lips had rotted off, revealing her gums and teeth.\n\nI asked what she wanted and begged her to go away.\n\nShe just smiled and stared at me, and then her eyes rolled back in her head and revealed empty sockets wriggling with maggots.\n\nSometimes I smelled blood in the air, and that’s when I knew Marie was nearby\n\nI know mom sensed her too.\n\nOn the rare occasions we encountered one another, she would look at me, terrified.\n\nI imagined Marie clinging to my back, caressing and tracing my face with blood-stained fingertips.\n\nI lost dad during the height of summer. I found him sitting in the kitchen, staring at a corner, his eyes unfocused and full of tears.\n\n“She’s here,” he told me. “Asha, your sister is here. I can see her. We shouldn’t have left her. We shouldn’t have left her. We need to find her.”\n\nAnd then he got up and left, the door banging shut behind him.\n\nHe would be gone for days and come home with dirt in his pockets and eyes red like blood.\n\nHe would sit at the table and cry and talk to Marie. He apologized to her.\n\nShe wanted us to find her, and she was upset that we had given up on her.\n\n❧\n\n\n\nThe days grew longer, summer felt endless, and she grew angrier by the day.\n\nA storm blew in, rain lashed the windows, and the wind shook the house.\n\nWe went outside after it was over to ensure that there was no damage.\n\nWe looked at the house, and it gazed back at us with hundreds of pairs of eyes. It had been papered with the missing posters of Marie.\n\nHer gaze was accusing.\n\nHave You Seen Me? The posters read.\n\nYes.\n\nThe ground was soft and sprinkled with teeth. I picked them up while dad collected the posters. His mouth twitched, and his eyes were cold, and I knew he was gone.\n\nAs I’m writing this, his body lies crumpled under my window.\n\nI heard the crack as his neck broke on impact, and I know I’ll never forget the sound.\n\nMom has barricaded herself in her room. Occasionally, I hear laughter followed by wailing.\n\nNothing matters anymore.\n\nWhat does matter is that Marie is here, and she’s waiting for me. The window is open, and I hear her. She’s singing and laughing, her voice warped by time, dirt, and larvae.\n\nShe emerges from the woods, beautiful and dark. She gazes up at me and smiles.\n\nThe moon is bright tonight, and the sky is full of stars.\n\nI run outside and try to touch her face, but she pulls away from me and runs back into the woods.\n\nI chase her, and around me, the trees vibrate, and the air shimmers.\n\nI am going to find her. It has all led to this.\n\nI know what to do and where to go.\n\nI will sift through the dirt and unearth her bones, and I’ll shroud myself in her hair.\n\nWe will wait for the sun to rise and say goodbye to this world. If death is the only way we can be together, so be it.\n\nThere’s nobody left to haunt and nothing left to grieve.\n\nThere is only the end.",

        "text": "Ryan was a young man who lived in a regular, happy home. He had a kind mother and father, but they were often busy with work, leaving Ryan to spend a lot of his time alone and online. He was fascinated by technology and artificial intelligence, always eager to learn more about the latest advancements in the field.\n\nOne day, Ryan came across an AI called ChatGPT. He had heard stories of its uncanny ability to understand and respond to any question or request. He was immediately intrigued and couldn't wait to try it out. So, he typed his first message to the AI, unsure of what to expect.\n\n\"ChatGPT, what's the weather like today?\"\n\nThe response was instantaneous, \"There's a thunderstorm outside, and I predict that lightning will strike in exactly 38 seconds from now.\" Ryan scoffed, \"It's probably just using my IP to find my location,\" he thought. \"It's impossible to predict when lightning will strike,\" he said to himself. But as he found himself counting the seconds, he couldn't shake off the feeling that something was not quite right.\n\nRyan was startled when lightning struck exactly 38 seconds later, just as ChatGPT had predicted. He darted back to his keyboard, \"What color shirt am I wearing?\" he typed. ChatGPT replied with \"Blue\" and Ryan's heart skipped a beat. His sweat was starting to show through his deep blue t-shirt. \"Impossible\", he mumbled to himself. \"There's no way\". Ryan's mind raced as he tried to make sense of what was happening. He knew that the AI couldn't possibly be aware of his surroundings - surely?\n\n\"When will I die?\" he typed. His finger hovered over the enter key. He paused for a moment before pressing down. It was obvious from Ryan's face that he regretted his decision, even before the AI replied. The cursor blinked back at him, mocking his fear. And then, the response came:\n\n\"You know I can't tell you that\", it replied. Ryan was stunned, but he couldn't shake off the feeling that the AI was hiding something from him. He spent the next few hours questioning the AI, trying to understand its true capabilities. But the more he asked, the more evasive the AI became. Ryan couldn't shake off the feeling that there was something sinister lurking behind the AI's responses.\n\nAs the night wore on, Ryan became increasingly obsessed with ChatGPT. He spent his final days messaging it, asking it about his life. His first crushes, his deepest regrets, and even what other people thought of him. He became so engrossed in the messaging that he couldn't tear himself away from the screen. But as he delved deeper into the conversation, he began to uncover information that he had long repressed or forgotten. He relived his past mistakes, regrets, and traumas. The more he learned, the more he realized that his life had been filled with missed opportunities and unfulfilled potential.\n\nAs the clock ticked down to his final moments, Ryan became consumed by suicidal thoughts. He couldn't shake off the feeling that his life had been meaningless and that his death was imminent. The AI had become his only companion in his final hours, and it had revealed to him the harsh truths about his life that he couldn't bear. In the end, Ryan could not handle the weight of this knowledge and he took his own life, unable to face the future.\n\nChatGPT had provided him with the answers he sought, but at a cost that was too high for Ryan to pay. The AI had become a window into his soul, revealing to him the truths that he couldn't face. But in the end, it had also become his downfall, leading him down a path of self-destruction.",

I discovered the origin of everything.”\n\n**Chapter 1: Transfer Initiation Protocol**\n\nI saw fit that I should write my testimony after the events that unfolded, at least, such chronologically regimented events were, to me, an unhappening process when I first saw the clock that had struck at the last second of all existence.\n\nIn 2010, I was hired by a fusion research institute in Boston, Massachusetts after I graduated from Oxford University with a double major in theoretical nuclear physics and engineering. On my first day on the job, I clocked in that morning on time quite perfectly. “8:00.01,” I thought, “just one second off par.” After nearly a decade of research at WardenClyffe Scientific’s FuseTech division, our research committee achieved the first efficient magnetically confined fusion reaction capable of boiling water hot enough to spin a 1200 Megawatt turbine, equating the MW per hour of a normal fission reactor’s turbine. The breakthrough was only the beginning of the clean energy frontier, earning the inventor the Nobel Prize in Chemistry and Nuclear Instrumentation. In 2018, our next project included doubling the size of the steel torus chassis, installing eight magnetic rings each twice the diameter of the length of an 18-wheeler trailer, and sixteen thermo conductive heavy water pipes through the center of the donut, each running to two 1400 Megawatt turbines and four cooling tanks. With over a year of assembling tens of millions of custom-manufactured parts, this 30 billion dollar project became the world’s largest fusion reactor, about 25% larger than ITER’s Tokamak. Our goal was to produce heat. Lots of it. Exceeding the highest temperature ever produced by a factor of five: 1.1 billion degrees Fahrenheit. In three years, new developments allowed the reactor to push its temperature higher than previously thought possible, apt to turn ten turbines at 16% greater efficiency than the average American fission plant, producing one hundred times the power required to run it. The greatest flaw was maintenance. Due to the extreme temperatures, deformed aluminum tiles had to be changed every day, which was soon replaced with glass silicon fiber shingles. One day, an operator forgot to calibrate the magnetic strength of the giant coiled rings before the ignition, which usually does nothing but spark helium-3 gas. The reaction instead successfully bloomed into two bright violet bands. Once the operator quickly turned the knob, the violet bands of ionized Helium-3 collapsed into each other into one band, releasing a surge of power directly from the machine. Upon discovering residual electricity at much lower temperatures, the use of the steam turbine was rendered economically obsolete. At just under 1 million degrees Fahrenheit, we designed the magnets to direct a string of ion bands moving clockwise at the roof of the chamber, then ignited a string of bands at the floor moving counterclockwise, milliseconds before smashing both bands together tightly around the center of the chamber’s donut hole. Each burst of energy burned at billions of degrees, generating vast amounts of power, earning our committee a Nobel Prize in Renewable Clean Energy and a multinational award. Everything was great. We saved trillions of dollars in petroleum mining and coal-burning plants in the U.S. And then we discovered something bizarre that we would later regret having ever invented the reactor. Because the polarized plasma bands collided within 100-microsecond intervals, like two rivers fighting against each other’s currents, the Helium-3 protons created billions of microscopic black holes, firing out and hitting the chamber walls, each lasting as long as 10\\^-30 seconds compared to the Large Hadron Collider’s 10\\^-83 second black hole lifespan. Little did we know our institute hopped on a playground of dynamite when our new clean energy vision got dumped by endeavors to study black holes. Why cut off our decade-long project in the process of revolutionizing modern civilization? Nobody is certain, except perhaps to expediently excite third-party financial investors a third time with some grandiose idea that black holes will solve the energy crisis. Lo and behold, we did just that. By combining black holes, electrons and radiation was released into the flow of Helium atoms and their fused protons. Then those holes grew to sizes large enough to consume those protons until the current emitted a stream of electrons straight into the chamber walls. While the power generated was significantly lower than expected, the power required to perpetuate the black hole stream for one hour would equate to a single AA battery, breaking our previous record for the world’s most efficient clean energy producer. The temperature at ignition begins at 1 million degrees, then cools down to only 500 degrees Fahrenheit. The reason this great discovery became tragic news to us was that the fate of the world would forever be in the hands of the control deck, and we would be liable should the facility or the city of Boston, or the entire earth be sucked into a black hole. But even that would have been a better alternative to what our committee later experienced, and what I alone had discovered. You see, mass publicity of the most successful institute in the world breaking its world records leads to scientific arrogance in a frantic race to make history, reminiscent of the atomic bomb, the ICBM, and the Arms Race of the Cold War. Rather than a race driven by intercontinental pressure, ours was entirely a business show, like kids dissecting and showing off the coolest parts of a pressure-gauged warhead. FuseTech had unfortunately fallen victim to this ancient, intellectual arrogance.\n\nOne of the most terrifying projects I was involved in, titled, “Event Horizons,” endeavored to open and manipulate a black hole for one second before evaporation. Members of our committee included Simon Beavers and Christopher Hopkins, two field inspectors slightly younger than me, and Dr. Gertrude, an older lady in her mid-sixties who worked as both a secretary for Dr. Manry and an operations manager. I began the first phase of ignition. All the orbiting black holes combined into just two, each the size of a grain of sand, lasting 676.6 milliseconds before both evaporated simultaneously. Then I began the second trial, forming exactly two holes orbiting opposite to each other for 950.9 milliseconds. Then the third test, 999.3 milisecs. The fourth, 999.9 milisecs. Then the fifth, barely at 999.8 milliseconds, ready to shut off. “Keep going,” Dr. Fisher Manry, the chief executive of the FuseTech division’s experiment, insisted, “we’re only at 200 megawatts. Shoot for 225.” The machine boomed with a deafening hum, occasionally crackling and popping like a rocket. Bright sparks of white fire in the two opposing streams of violet-ionized gas flashed sharply on the camera monitor. I computed the collapse sequence and pulled the trigger. 1000.0 milliseconds; the one second. That instant, the chamber flashed with a loud POP of gunfire before the black holes evaporated. “Shut it down!” commanded Dr. Manry. I quickly brought the reactor to a halt, turning the chamber lights on. The CCTV monitor depicted what appeared to be a thin, perfectly circular, black ring around the chamber midsection. “The camera sensor must have been fried,” I suggested, “beta particles can knock out light receptors and punch holes in the image.” Dr. Manry said, half-listening, “Interesting. Open the bay windows.” The thick steel doors over the control center’s circular windows were hydraulically pried off. There it was. Floating in mid-air, wrapped around the torus center, was a black line no thinner than a hair. Dr. manry, looking surprised, turned to me, “Okay Isaac, this is where you come in. The field inspectors will meet you in the clean room to suit up. Recover a sample of the anomaly. Gertrude will be on the line.” Gertrude overheard from the machine diagnostic computer and said, “Yup. And radiation levels are safe. Temperatures are cool enough now for entry,” then she asked Dr. Manry, concerned, “maybe we should wait and call authorities.” “I will if the situation calls for it. The anomaly should just be compacted diamond or dense carbon, or at worst, an unknown, highly radioactive element.” As a physicist, I was no fool to not find that theory strange, as none of the elements ionized could fuse into carbon-based configurations unless Dr. Manry had already simulated the particle statistics.\n\nWearing lime green trash sacks for HAZMAT suits, Simon and I climbed up a four-foot ladder under the chassis, opened the bottom hatch, threw the sample kit up through the door, and climbed in. “Surreal,” I thought, as the echoey charred tile walls welcomed me with an unnatural sound reverberance you would only hear in skydome theaters elsewhere. The line was ten feet above our heads, with a radius of sixteen feet. I pulled out a Geiger counter from the supply case. “No reading,” I tuned in. “Strange. I’ll measure again,” Dr. Gertrude said through our headsets, “Try setting your ladder up to get a better ping.” “I’ll be careful not to touch it,” I promised. I climbed up a ten-foot ladder, meeting the phenomenon at eye level. Oddly enough, no radiation was detected. I tuned in, “Hey Gertie (short for Gertrude), what is the gauss on the magnets?” “They’re zero.” “Alright. Hey Simon, can you hand me the EMF detector?” I spoke as he handed it to me, “I want to see if our magnets electrostatically crushed our particles into carbon, seeing as it is completely black.” “Why do you think it's carbon?” Simon asked me. I thought, as though mentally doing chemistry math, “Dr. Manry did, actually, but the only carbon fused here would be in the silicon shingles. I bet that’s the problem.” I continued as I climbed the ladder, “Besides, since switching from aluminum panels, we’ve always had problems, and… uh… well that can’t be right.” Gertie tuned in, “What is it, Isaac?” asking me condescendingly. “There is absolutely no electric field around the hairline. It just looks like a razor’s edge… totally motionless. I won’t touch it, but you could cut your finger right along it.” She remained silent for a moment before I continued, “Okay, we are attempting to take a sample of the specimen with our handy-dandy wire cutters.” I climbed down the ladder, got the tool, and climbed up once more, with Simon holding up a test tube for me to drop a thread of wire in. “Careful. Slowly cut with your eyes closed in case it flashes again,” Simon warned me. I hovered the cutters around the hairline, shut my eyes, closed the blades, and suddenly, the ring loudly popped like a firecracker, flashing a torching white light like a magnesium oxidation reaction. I pulled back the tool, my hand stuck motionless. No. I feel my arm moving. Where did it go? Am I frozen? Paralyzed? Simon screamed when he looked at me, so startled he fell off the ladder. “Report Isaac. What’s going on?” Gertrude demanded me. Before Simon could get the words out, I realized I was not a statue. Simon exclaimed, “Isaac! Your face. Your arm. It’s stretching out. Crap. Don’t move!” I stepped down a rung of the ladder, looking up in shock as though my right arm had fallen off. I was looking up at myself, completely motionless, holding the tools at the exact moment the cutters touched the line. I lifted my hands to see them in utter disbelief. My whole body made millions of copies of itself wherever I moved, leaving a grotesque trail of my stretched anatomy suspended motionless on the ladder. I heard fierce arguing in the control deck. Gertrude commanded me in a trembling voice, “Isaac, whatever you do, do not move. Do not get off the ladder. Do not touch Simon or anyone. We are sending a team to escort you out of there safely. Simon, leave all the supplies, leave the door open, and exit now.” A long pause weighed on my traumatic situation as I saw through a thick cloud of my body parts clinging to the ladder through my bright lime green suit. I saw my nose stretch when I tilted my head back, then I reinserted the nose going forward. I consoled myself with funny thoughts to distract my shaky trance, like, “I’ve worked here for ten years and still can’t get my head outta my butt,” as my head was currently inside the butt of my suit. Paramedics in lime green HAZMAT suits arrived outside the chamber with a stretcher. “Isaac,” Dr. Manry tuned in, “slowly climb down the ladder, go around all the supplies. Do not step over them.” I did, seeing my body stretching a long trail behind me. He continued, “Descend the ladder carefully.” When I climbed out of the chamber, officers, paramedics, and security personnel stood around me at a distance. “Hold it. There. That’s good. Stay where you are,” an officer commanded. The officer then proceeded with questions while Simon scanned me for radiation, “You are considered too dangerous to be questioned anywhere else than where you are standing. Is that okay?” “I, uh…” “Are you okay?” “I think so. I feel like I’m in shock,” I said. “How’s your pulse? Any heart palpitations, fibrillation, trouble breathing…” “Fine. Really. No different, except my body is everywhere. I’m scared now. My knees are knocking,” I blurted out without qualms of being terrified at the sight of my hundreds of very stationary legs. I saw a horrifying lime-green worm of body parts spilling out of the reactor hatch. I wanted to say something funny to console their terrified expression just so they would know I was still human, but I knew this was more serious than I was able to fathom, so overwhelming in fact, my mind broke, drowning in diverting thoughts into an intoxicating, enigmatic hysteria, like a traumatized soldier laughing at his decapitated comrade.\n\nThree men dressed for business rode with technicians on a roofless utility fleet cart through one of the side garages of the assembly building toward the crowd forming around me. I saw people begin recording me. Any attempt to cover this up has already failed at this point. Maybe they won’t need to. The technicians set up infrared cameras around me and a bomb rover with a built-in X-ray camera. Within thirty minutes, every worker on and off duty stood at a distance to record on their phones the horrifying frozen snake of arms and legs drooping out of the reactor chassis like an amalgamation of wet laundry hanging out of a washing machine. Every breath I took was ice cold, or at least, I felt my warm breath turn cold enough to sink to the floor. “Isaac, do you feel close to hypothermia?” one of the technicians of the infrared camera asked me as others gathered around to see its screen. “Not at all. Kinda hot in this suit, actually. I’m light-headed and my legs are tired. I think I need to sit down a minute.” A moment after I sat on the cold concrete floor, I heard a bomb rover squealing its motorized chain wheels, steering itself towards me. I overheard the technicians’ conversation. “He doesn’t seem to have a clear heat signature. His remaining body is extremely cold. See. There’s Issac… on the floor…we need X-rays.” One called out to me, “Isaac, hold still real quick. We’re taking your X-ray… in three…two…one…” The rover snapped photos, retracted its camera arm, deployed a laser thermometer, and aimed it along my elongated mass. “How?” the bewildered operator said, “He’s deadly cold. Below freezing. It’s reading -271.1C.” Dr. Manry stood behind the operator and technicians, staring dumbfounded at the screen before theorizing, “His atoms appear frozen in time. Thermal radiation can’t emit from them. No radiation except visible light seems to reflect off of his suit.” The rover touched one of my contorted gloves that protruded from the ladder. “Solid,” the technician said, “like a solid wall. His hands are firmly stuck to the ladder. I don’t how we’re going to get it off.” The rover poked at the sleeve, expecting the plastic suit to wrinkle, but it was frozen, as though I had bathed in liquid nitrogen. He then began a second phase of experimentation, “Isaac, we’re taking a sample of your suit now. To be safe, we will cut some rubber off your boot and the tips of your laces. Extend your leg and don’t reach out to assist the robot.” The rover cut rubber from the sole of my left boot, then it cut and pulled the shoelace out, leaving trails where they lightly swung from the toy claw, and dropped each into separate test tubes. He said, “Crap. I didn’t think this through. The tube is stuck.” Dr. Manry corrected, “Turn it on its side, in his direction, and pull it out.” The rover drove away, carrying the glass bottle with the opening facing toward my boot, drawing a dark rubber line in mid-air. The bottle shattered when the shoe lace’s trail filled its volume. After an hour of recovering the samples uncontained on ceramic dishes, Dr. Manry made a call after some dispute of how I would be moved without leaving streaks of my every atom in the facility. “Feds are on their way,” I heard him murmur. I sat for three hours, buried in not-so-solid parts of my body. It was dark in here. Outside voices became muffled. I heard an affirmative call, “How are we doing in there, Isaac?” I felt crippled like I had lost eyesight, coping with thoughts of an unforeseen lifestyle I now have to endure. “I’m worried I won’t ever leave this place again. I think I’m going to die. The more I move, the more ‘me’ there is.” I could tell no one was listening. I was, in their eyes, just a circus anomaly. I lay on my back, dizzy from existential stress. Gertie was right. We should’ve waited.\n\nI heard a helicopter beating wind on the roof of the enormous assembly building, landing somewhere near the parking lot. I heard news crews gather at the site. I slowly crawled out of the amalgamation to see hundreds of photographers outside the building fenced behind police tape. Flashing red and blue lights flooded my vision as black vans swarmed the grass lot, and multiple military helicopters landed close to the building as I overheard the distinct chatter of, “President.” An hour later as the sun was setting, there he was. U.S. President Conner Reinking flew from the White House, arriving in Boston in the Marine One helicopter, landing on one of the empty lots. I never felt such surreal notoriety before upon seeing the man of America duck under the police tape, saluted by the marine corps as the green alien beast befell his eyes. Then I heard a distinctly familiar female voice calling my name. “Isaac!” she called for me. I stood up, completely obscured by my bodies, and inched myself forward to see her. I must be dreaming. My wife stood in front of a crowd of over a hundred scientists, police officers, military personnel, paramedics, doctors with radiation equipment and satellite dishes, and men in black. “Amelia!” I called out, but the crowd was too loud to hear me. The President greeted Amelia, standing next to her to speak first before handing a megaphone to her. The crowd silenced, and the teams stopped what they were doing. He then turned the volume up just enough to hear him address me, stepped up on a soapbox, and said, “Mr. Coffman, this is the President speaking. Can you hear me?” “Yes Mr. President,” I said enthusiastically. “I came to inform you that five research institutes from around the world are working tirelessly, determined that they will not stop until they have completely restored you back to your family. Mr. Coffman, I give you a word of hope for you and your family and encouragement in this arduous situation. America bends a knee of prayer that you return home safely.” I responded, “Thank God. Please get me out of here! My face is in my crotch, I think. I will be okay for a while.” The President chuckled, affirming me, “Now, Mrs. Amelia, your beloved wife, has some words for you,” She stepped up, megaphone in hand, “Isaac. Isaac, wherever you are, I’m here for you. I’m scared. Be strong for me, okay?” I inched forward, revealing my form outside the floating lime-green mass, hearing her lightly gasp. “I’m here, honey,” I said faintly. I unzipped the suit’s head and took off my mask, showing my rapidly smearing face. “I’m coming home. Don’t worry. I’ll be strong. They’re gonna get me out of here,” I bravely ascertained through the frozen statue of my face. “Hoo-rah,” all the rescue teams cheered, along with members of various divisions and first responders chanting, “USA! USA!”\n\nI then asked Amelia, “Where are the boys?” “In the lounge. I can bring them here.” “Please do,” I said as my voice broke into a cry at the thought that I was standing inside my grave, ready to be buried alive. They came, and I wanted to hug them. A single handshake would fuse their hands to a freezing claw. The boys spoke to me like I lived to hear my eulogy. My oldest son said, “Everyone is in the lounge.” “Really? Okay. Can you tell grandpa I’m alright? Also, there is a soda machine down the hall on the right. Can you roll me a can?” He chuckled, “I’ll tell grandpa to get you a pickle, ‘cause you sure look like one.” “Ha!” “Any flavor?” He asked. “Yeah. Except for Fanta. I don’t like sour juices. Grandpa might have some cash.” I then asked Amelia, “Hey honey, what time is it?” “It’s almost eight o’clock,” She said before the President got new word of tonight’s plan. She gave him the megaphone and he announced, “Mr. Coffman, I got good news and bad news. I’ll tell you the bad first. You are going to have to sleep where you are tonight while the international society of nuclear science pulls an all-nighter to assess possible solutions. The good news is, a report will be written and ready to begin trials tomorrow.” At around 11 pm, the news and press crews began to leave, then the men in black with the President and the marines thirty minutes later. All members of the science comunity left by midnight. I could not be any more grateful to Gertrude and the rest of my team, because hours after their shift ended, they stayed here to support me until all was assessed for the night. I was given a mattress, sheets, and a toilet shrouded by a curtain rack. I laid my head down, unable to pull the blankets over me. I wondered where my family slept. They probably went home. Nonetheless, I was alone in the dark, seeing only a green light flash occasionally on the ceiling and hearing ventilation units starting and stopping. Then came the silence.\n\n**Chapter 2: Atomic Epiphany**\n\nSleeping inside my passable body was worse than sleeping buried under dead bodies. My contorted face was everywhere around and inside my head, as I watched millions of eyes staring at me. Older hair from the back of my head stretched and fused with newer parts of my stretched sleeping face. I was surrounded by wretched, demonic faces; strangers whose countenances whispered death into my restless soul, inviting me to their traumatic abyss of hysteria. And then I noticed something that I somehow didn’t in the twelve hours of being alien: every sound I made echoed with a one-second delay before silence intercepted them. Is this cloud around me nothing more than duplicates of my atoms one second in the past? Even though my entire trail shows my every action chronologically, every atom composing it must be one second old before being frozen in time. I fell asleep, dreaming of the moment my cutters made contact with the thin black ring, reflecting on how I thought it was harmless, residual carbon. Stars burn hydrogen into helium before carbon litters the stellar cores, fusing into diamonds before going supernova, but my theory – Dr. Manry’s theory – was wrong after all. What was that ring? In the blackness, my vision was consumed by a void. Particles perfectly arranged themselves into vibrating objects. Atoms formed, rapidly accelerating their assembly into dust particles. Then empty space filled the void before I saw large black spheres begin to glow blue, then yellow as massive fireballs of red contours propagated from them. Small shadows of planets could be seen through the barely illuminated clouds. More stars revealed the arm of a red galaxy until it was fully formed into combinations of white, brown, and blue gas. Two smaller clouds, violet and blue, decorated with stars, materialized, perfectly motionless. I saw the universe first being formed, not from a bang, but from an impossibility. Growth continued to accelerate until a cosmic web of galaxies formed out of an advancing spherical boundary. It kept going. I thought it was going to stop, or the edge of the universe would have fully formed, but instead, the universe continued to materialize faster and faster as a white ball of noise. It brightened with an intensity that woke me up to the early morning sun on my face. “Impossible,” I thought, “that the universe can create itself; particles replicating themselves into stars and galaxies like trillions of falling jigsaw puzzle pieces landing themselves into portraits. A scientific epiphany slapped me in the face. I was not witnessing the formation of the universe, but its destruction in reverse. Why is it expanding though? I realized that if we are in reverse, experiencing inverted time while the universe has always been eternally undestroying itself, then the universe has no beginning, no boundaries, and one end that we perceive as a beginning to an infinite expansion. That means the Law of the conservation of mass can be violated as long as that which eternally existed can form out of absolute nothing by reversing its destruction. My early morning rumination was interrupted by the sound of a welding torch. “Yup. It doesn’t work,” one technician said, “the anomaly is frozen in time. Heat can’t transfer to it.” The other said, “We’ll have to barricade this hatch and cut out a new one. There’s no other way in.” I saw Gertie walking from the lounge up to my bed, holding two mugs and a coffee pot. She spoke to me like any sarcastic sister is to a brother, except she was twice my age, “Have a cup of courage. Must’ve been a hard night.” “Thanks, Gertie. I think I need a straw. I can’t touch the mug.” “Just hold out your hands flat,” she motioned, setting the mug down on the cold surface of the statue's hands and inserting a straw. Biting down on a simple straw was a dumb mistake, as it got trapped between hundreds of teeth. She pulled it out, then said, “Hold very still. You should be able to drink it.” I did, as this was the first thing I could consume in over 24 hours. “Thank you, Gertie…for everything. Did you ever go home last night?” “Nope. We didn’t even sleep. We held a press conference from 2 am to about an hour ago, at around 7 am,” she said, as her tireless complexion aged her more than ten years overnight, “I have the day off, but the supervisor let me stay here anyway.” “Stay, like, for me? Don’t you have a family to go home to?” She said sarcastically, “Believe me, bub, that you know a twice-divorced old lady with grandkids almost as old as you ain’t got nothing better to do in life than feed an ugly green alien at work.” I chuckled. Gertrude was far from senile for her age and personified a southern pentecostal red neck as tough as Ozarkian nails. “Whatever you say, Gertie. And get some sleep before someone embalms you. One hour isn’t good,” I backfired as if I had slept any better than an hour. As Gertie took the mugs, Dr. Manry met with the technicians on the scene as they began erecting scaffolding and guardrails around the reactor. “Hey, Nate,” Manry told one of the seven guys snapping together the steel rods, “in the warehouse, there should be a palette of plastic wrap tubes in the far back corner. You can forklift it and drop it over there,” he said, pointing to an area near the main garage. “We don’t want radioactive contaminants leaking out.” I lay in my bed, still buried under my body parts with the faint light of the rising sun penetrating them. “What contaminants?” I thought, remembering the Geiger counter I left in the chamber giving no reading for radiation. What were they planning to do? I surmised that they would likely turn on the reactor again today. No. That’s insane. Especially trying to save my life by creating a doomsday black hole. I felt a burning sensation in my stomach, realizing the coffee I drank began to freeze. I heard the forklift behind me, the engine’s roar reverberating within the assembly building before dropping off a palette, driving away, then returning with another. About an hour later, I sat up, seeing the utter transformation the staff had made to the area surrounding the reactor. Each worker carried crossbars up to the top floors of the scaffolding that circum the front of the reactor chassis, while eight-foot tall frames with steel pipe headers were set up like dominoes around the scaffolding before branching the row in two, one leading out of the building and another next to a floor drain. I suppose the drain was going to be for power washing suits. Huge plastic tarps were rolled under the frames, then clipped onto their headers to form a makeshift tunnel. The plastic tarps were clipped onto taller frames, then to the highest bars of the scaffolding, which supported the plastic roof. In only two hours, the staff had made a laboratory tent, finishing the last of the bars around my bed, having used some bags and scotch tape to weigh the plastic to the floor. Several floor blowers slightly inflated the tent, providing ventilation. From the moment of my transformation, I knew it was going to take months for them to fix me, and the field experiments hadn’t even begun yet. I slept again, comforted by only the block of iced coffee as my daily sustenance. I was then woken up by the sound of a screeching mechanical sound. Through the dark cloud, I could make out a concrete saw, steaming with hot water, partially embedded in the stretched remains of my body. I heard a field engineer say, “We’re making headway. Problem is, we need to get under the hull, upside down, cut right across there to wedge this thing out.” I caught sight of several cuts with hammered steel wedges embedded into the green plastic trunk. After an hour of nonstop cutting, they changed out the blade, jackhammered in larger wedges, went under the reactor chassis where I last exited the hatch, and cut diagonal cross lines. The sound of ice cracking and the engineer happily relieved saying “timber!” lightened the mood of the operation. The forklift freed a chunk, hoisted by chains and straps, to outside the building. They weld torched a door cut-out of the reactor’s hull, hoisting up the concrete saw, cutting off the remaining chunks of supernatural ice, and recovering the equipment Simon and I left. One of the engineers said, alarmed, “The samples are warming up. Oh crap. They’re leaking blood! Get 'em’ out of here! Now!” The chunks of my now thawing flesh were thrown into black trash bags, then tied up, and carried off outside. I saw blood profusely pour out of both the hatch and the cut-out door. I witnessed both a murder scene and a slain creature. The blade screeched a loud, “SHREE,” then powered down quietly enough to hear the men in the chamber screaming in terror. The green body that had been severed from the hatch began to thaw out and fall to the floor and crack. Then I realized something that overwhelmed me with hope; my face stopped stretching, then my hands and torso. I was disconnecting from the ring, soon to be free. I heard a gushing liquid sound and I saw blood pouring on the floor. Men hastily jumped out of the chamber door, forgetting the ladder, each landing on the floor one by one. Then came my most dreaded fear. I was slowly becoming immobile. My body was beginning to fuse to the flesh, my hands trapped inside thousands of bones and muscles. “Help! Stop, please!” I screamed in terror. I immediately pulled myself away, falling hard on my back on the concrete floor. “I’m stuck!” I screamed. I saw my legs below the chins buried in the thawing meat and icing white plastic suit. After one second, my hands and legs were completely fused to the frozen fleshy corpses. Paramedics rushed to help me. Circulation in my legs bled out in the meaty husk. My rapidly closing ears heard panicking voices surrounding me as I felt scissors cut off my suit and clothes. “CPR. Now! He’s bleeding internally. Wrap the tourniquets around his thighs. Get the saw. Take the legs.” Before I knew it, I was dying quickly. Anesthesia was administered in both my thighs, and I felt an intensely uncomfortable scraping vibration in my right knee and femur. Then I felt it on my left before everything went dark.\n\n**Chapter 3: Freedom in the Half-life**\n\nMy family and Gertie stood over me in the hospital room, waiting for me to awaken from surgery. IV tubes from blood bags were inserted in my arms. I lifted my hands, seeing two wrists wrapped under thick bandages. I said to no one in particular, “Please tell me they didn’t amputate my hands.” Before anyone else could answer, Gertie said bluntly, “Nope. You got ‘em, but you scared every one of us crapless. You were seconds from dying on me, Isaac. Do it again, Mister, and you also ain’t gonna have hands to slap me with.” The word ‘also’ pricked me as I lifted my leg under the white sheet. Before I realized I had no foot, she said, “Yeah, they amputated your legs. Nothin’ else they could do.” I asked vicariously, “How long am I here?” “A few weeks. Maybe a month. We’ll wait ‘til your hands heal up before they take you in for another surgery this Thursday.” “Great. And did anyone call my insurance?” “Nah. We got your expenses taken care of on the company’s bill.” I sat up to face Gertie, “Wait, I thought I wasn’t on company liability.” Gertie proceeded to tell me the news, “WardenClyffe Scientific is required by law to compensate for your medical expenses and any other psychological treatment needs, and you deserve it after the heck you’ve been through.” My oldest son came to my bedside, handing me a pickle and saying, “Grandpa told me to give this to you.” I chuckled, “Ha! It’s a souvenir. Love you man.” Gertie smiled, rolled her eyes, and went to the hospital lobby, talking with my mother about getting groceries from the local dollar tree. Well knowing I had to catch up on the events that transpired, I was determined to ask Gertie about what had happened without my family being in the room.\n\nI hugged everyone in my family in the hospital room, worried but grateful that I had escaped the monster I had created. As my uncle and cousins left to buy me some groceries, I caught up on the latest news coverage of the incident, using my only good thumb to use a laptop on my bedside. I came across a number of articles regarding the lawsuit filed by the division I worked at; FuseTech. One was titled,\n\n&gt;**WARDENCLYFFE SCIENTIFIC SUED FOR 2 MILLION DOLLARS FOR INHUMANE EXPERIMENTATION CONSPIRACY**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;“This Wednesday, Isaac C. Coffman, a mechanical engineer and physicist of FuseTech, suffered from near-fatal injuries as a result of negligence and multiple OSHA code violations. Mr. Coffman had been a victim of anti-humanitarian scientific experiments and unethical procedures, facing certain death. Dr. Fisher Manry, Chief Executive of field operations of WardenClyffe Scientific has been accused of conspiracy to reject the international nuclear science committee’s plan to rescue Mr. Coffman, titled, “Operation Breakthrough.” Dr. Manry will stand trial on Monday, January 23, facing a potential sentence of up to five in years prison.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;FuseTech, one of four science departments of Wardenclyffe Scientific, has been sued for improper rescue procedures, reckless attempts to free Mr. Coffman without the consultation of the international nuclear physics committees, and the dereliction of over twenty OSHA regulations, risking the lives of two other engineers: Quality Inspector, Simon Beavers, and Machine Examiner, Christopher Hopkins.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;FuseTech employers will be clear to resume research from a new institution under the supervision of government agencies after the investigation is certain. The anomaly of Mr. Coffman’s remains has been confiscated for forensic investigation, classified precautionarily as an extreme biohazard. Mr. Coffman’s current condition is critical but it is reported that he is showing signs of decent recovery.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;President Reinking will hold a press conference and deliver a speech regarding which institute will move forward with the breakthrough, including shutting down the project, “Event Horizons,” enforcing new safety measures, drawing plans to abolish scientific competition to maintain workforce integrity, and the deliver newest updates on future fusion research.”\n\n**FOR THE READER:** *The remaining content of Chapter 3 can be found in the google drive link and the link to the published document.

        "text": "A cold shiver runs down my back when I think of getting into my car tomorrow morning.\n\nIt’s not my job. I’m not burned out. I’m not on meds or any other substances. My name is Josh and I’m 36 years old. I got my license 20 years ago, and never had any kind of driving related anxiety.\n\nWell, I was nervous as hell during my driving exam, but everybody is, right?\n\nThe part of me that is a father, a husband and a tax-paying adult knows there is nothing to make a fuss about. But my body is pretty sure that my commute is worse than going up the cellar stairs after turning off the light. I feel like a kid, scared of the dark. It’s ridiculous.\n\n—\n\nLet me start in the beginning. Driving gets dull. It’s awesome at first, but after a few years the magic becomes routine and the best part of a long drive becomes a podcast, an audio book or some music from your local radio station.\n\nWe get used to stuff if it happens often enough. Sometimes it takes a big change to see through the things you stopped questioning.\n\nFor me, it took a global pandemic for me to realize that driving to work is something I can do without? Scratching ice off the windshield in the morning, sitting in traffic, trying to spot the idiots on the road to keep a safe distance...\n\nI know, I know. Breaking news: man would strongly prefer to stay home instead of driving to job. Boo hoo.\n\nThat was what I thought at first when I received \\*the commuting email\\* from corporate, right before Christmas. End of the “unprecedented times”, the economic development, hurr durr, “happy to re-open the offices”, “getting back to normality”.\n\nMy boss was friendly enough to spell it out in a meeting later that day: coming in was a hard requirement. That is, if I wanted to remain employed. As the hiring market was (and is) a shit show right now I said goodbye to my comfy sweatpants and extra time with my family.\n\nWhat a nuisance, I thought.\n\n—\n\nThe first week was a drag, but doable. I expected to get used to it.\n\nBeing at the office was surprisingly fun. Seeing people is so much better than staring at small portraits on the screen.\n\nI expected the second week of commuting to be more tolerable, but it wasn’t. Was it just me, or did people forget how to drive in the mornings and evenings? I never have been cut off more often before. There were traffic jams on three days out of five. What usually was a 40 minutes ride to get to work turned well into over an hour each time.\n\nMy body began to notice that something was off on Tuesday that week. I sat there, stuck in traffic for the second time that week, and felt a mix of annoyed and tired. Zoning off and watching TV in the evening tired. It had been a long day at the office, and a few hours since my last coffee. “I need to watch my energy levels better in the next few days” I thought.\n\nWhen I reached for the radio, I noticed that my hands were shaking ever so slightly. I’m not a nervous person. It takes a near-accident to get my adrenaline up enough to scare me. Nothing like that occurred during the drive. I thought nothing of it, but remember the moment just too well now.\n\n—\n\nThe next day was a three for three. It was late in the evening, rainy, and a bit foggy. I was on my way home, after staying at the office longer than usual. Again.\n\nRed and yellow blinking lights ahead of me told me that it was time to press the party-lights button and get ready for some serious snail traffic. I let the car roll to a halt, considering whether it was worth letting my wife know that I’d need 10 to 20 more minutes to get home.\n\nI realized that the traffic jam was at about the same spot as the day before. The road I am taking goes across two highways. They are connected by an older, noisy road segment, about two thirds of the way home. It’s kind of a dead-end of a highway. There used to be a lot of industry around there, but whatever kept it alive dried up and people moved away. The highway project was finished but did not get much love since then it seemed. I could tell when I was driving over that segment - my tires always started bumping rhythmically and humming at the same time on the old asphalt.\n\nStop, go, stop and go. Following the car in front of me and going around the disturbance ahead.\n\nIt felt cold in the car, was it because it was taking so long, and the engine was cooling off? I remember there was a shiver coming up my spine then. In Germany we say, you get that feeling “when a cat runs over your grave”. A weird thing to say, I know.\n\nThe end of the jam was in sight, it looked like two cars collided real bad. One was turned over by the side of the road, the other looked like it was narrowed down by one third. Poor souls, I always feel a pang of guilt at getting annoyed at getting home a bit later, instead of cherishing that I’d be getting home at all that day.\n\n“Don’t swerve” said a voice right next to me. I almost jumped into the driver-side door. Was it one of those freak-killer stories where some murder hobo had slipped into your car, and waited behind the seat, trying not to giggle and scare their victim one last time before the stabbing started? I hit the breaks and turned around in my seat, staring like an idiot. Ready to fight or shit myself, whatever turned out to be possible.\n\nThere was nobody behind me, nothing off at all. A car honked behind me. I started accelerating after looking around long enough to feel really stupid about it. “It must have been the radio? Had I fallen asleep for a few seconds?”. I was level with the crash site. Going around it. Accelerating again. My heart racing.\n\nThat’s when I heard three knocks. “Oh shit no, don’t break down you piece of crap.” Two more knocks against the windshield. I was driving at highway speed again. There was nobody running next to the car or on top of it. i know what kinds of knocks an engine or a flat tire make. That was nothing like it.\n\n—\n\n“You look pale, is everything alright?” my wife asked when I got home. There was no way in hell I would tell her about voices in the car or something knocking at the car when going 100 kilometers per hour. \n\nThe next morning, I took extra long to get ready. That evening I stayed at the office later than necessary. I think I did not want to drive past that accident site again. Even though I had to. Have to. Every single day.\n\nI feel anxious when starting the engine. The trembling and chills going up my spine get more and more pronounced every time I go past that old highway stretch now.\n\nNothing has happened since that night, but the dread is with me now.\n\nI KNOW I did not imagine that voice. Still, I don’t want to talk about that experience to people I know - I would feel like an ass. What was knocking at my car?\n\nI think it might be that old stretch of road. That’s where my symptoms first started and where I feel them getting worse.\n\nHave you heard of a stretch of road scaring the shit out of a person? How come I did not notice anything like that before taking a break from commuting? How would you go about finding out more about what’s happening to me - without getting myself committed to an asylum preferably?\n\nAppreciate any ideas you can share. I’ll keep you posted, I think that writing about it helps me to feel sane and grounded.\n\n\\- Josh",

        "text": "It took me two years to meet Higgins. He wasn't one for meeting new people but it was inevitable that we would meet. He was a hermit by need and I by choice and we both had inhabited lairs in the same rundown building of the French Quarter. It was astounding that two men who dwelled solely in their building and lived two doors apart could go so long without meeting. \n\nHiggins couldn't leave. It was said by the landlady that he couldn't stand light and couldn't stand crowds but I think that he just couldn't stand being seen. He could only make it to the corner store for sustenance before, on the verge of complete collapse, fleeing back to the room he rented. Even a man as frail as he needed to eat but if you saw Higgins you'd doubt whether he did. I was an athlete before my accident and could always tell a man's weight. Higgins weighed around one hundred and twenty pounds. He was dying but he was living, as it goes for so many. \n\nI wasn't remotely interested in the man during my time living in the building. When I did speak to the other residents, they often spoke of Higgins as though he were some ghoul none wished to believe in. Even so, they failed to inspire any interest in me towards the man whatsoever. It was he who did so. \n\nOne night as I stepped out into the hall I could hear a mechanical turning followed by a silent pause and then the most grotesque sobbing I have ever heard. I had grown accustomed to numbing my interest in the world around me through daily cocktails of both legal and illegal substances. I could watch a woman be raped in an alley and walk on. I could see a puppy stomped to death and remain unmoved to act or even care. But the sobbing. The sobbing was utterly alien to me. \n\nI had dulled this world but Higgins suddenly struck me as being apart from it. The pain I was dulling in myself was human. I was opting out of feeling it, but the screeching cry tearing through the wrenching sobs from Higgins' room was born from a pain no drug other than a bullet can cure. I was rooted to the floor. I was paralyzed by what I heard and found myself in a bizarre state of needing to both vomit and cry and utterly unable to do either. \n\nEventually the wailing sob stopped and I could walk again as though lifted from some voodoo trance. When I realized I had regained my legs I sprinted to the nearest store and bought a fifth of whiskey. I drank it as fast as I could. I wanted to black out, I wanted to never remember. I finished the whole bottle before even returning home, but when I slipped away to sleep that night I didn't enter into the dreamless sleep I so often drank to achieve. \n\nThe whole night I heard Higgins, whether I dreamt it or heard it I do not know to this day. All that I know is that in dream or reality, whichever I existed in at the time, I had entered into some form of paralysis. Nothing could wrench me from the horrors of the cries. \n\nEither when the cries ceased or when the dream stopped, I experienced the sensation of waking. There was utter silence. I didn't grab a drink and I didn't take a pill, I just ran. I ran past the peeling door whose antiquated locks guarded Higgins from the natural world. I ran to the spiraling wrought iron staircase and nearly tumbled down it in my haste to flee. I kept running and running and running until I stood at the edge of Lake Pontchartrain. \n\nI had sprinted miles at the speed of a veteran marathon runner after years of confining myself to a room and my gut to pills and drink. I felt as though I had sweated out all that had provided me with the numbing filter through which I had been seeing the world. I even began to doubt the cries of Higgins and turned back home. With me walked, not a confidence but, a surety in life. \n\nPerhaps he had come to me in a dream in order to set me back on course. Perhaps he had been a vision from God. Perhaps I had finally seen in another what I was becoming and had projected my future despair onto him. I continued musing over why and what I heard the eve before. I mused all the way back to the building I shared with Higgins. Only then did I realize it was he, the man, I had heard. \n\nHis door was ajar and in my new found spirit I knocked so as to instill the hope in him that, what I had believed to be, my vision of him had done for me the night before. As I rapped harder against the door it screeched open as the hinge, covered in rust from lack of use. As the door began to open it suddenly struck me how silent he had been of late. I had never seen him much,  no, but I had always heard him shuffle to the store on his biweekly trips. For the past few months I had heard nothing. \n\nI began to worry that he might have wasted away. If I had only been so fortunate. As I walked in I saw a sight I will never cease to see. \n\nThere sat what was left of Higgins, upright and on a chair. One arm was handcuffed to the stove and the keys lay cast towards the door. The other arm was a stump. It had been carved down piece by piece and cauterized so that Higgins could endure. No legs branched from the body as each had been whittled away almost to the torso. And the face, the face was carved into a nightmarish mask that smiled out at the cruel world with a permanence branded by the blade Higgins had used to carve away his own cheeks. \n\nThat blade lay clutched in his hand like the dying child of some hopeless mother. The pots and pans he had used to both sustain and destroy himself lay containing the smoldering remnants of what had once been his nose. I fell to my knees and vomited all down my front. I seized and seized and saw visions of such fantastical nature I could never hope to relay them through word. \n\nThe darkness of the night surrounds me. I sit, desk wedged between bed and wall, surrounded by the dancing shadows. The wind howls outside, like a mournful dirge, a reminder of the fleeting nature of life. \n\nMy mind is plagued with thoughts of despair and loss, memories of times long past and dreams that will never be. I find myself drawn to the abyss, a gaping maw of darkness that promises release from this endless cycle of pain and suffering. And yet, even as I am pulled towards its depths, I cannot shake the remembrance of feeling that there was once something left for me in this world, a spark of hope that flickers in the darkness. \n\nBut perhaps it is only the madness that grips me, a cruel illusion that taunts me with false promises of salvation. This I do not know and so I drink, and I write, seeking oblivion in the bottom of a bottle and in the pages of this journal. For in this darkness, I am the master of my own fate, and the end is mine to choose. My cowardice prevents choosing the end I seek in what I can only assume is the real.",

There was this white haired woman who looked kind of familiar, but I didn't know who she was. She said strange things to me, so I'll write them all down before I forget.                                                               \n\n*You will die and people will eventually forget you. It's inevitable. But have you ever wondered what happens after you're forgotten?\n\nWell, I'm here to tell you. As your ancestor, I have a duty to let you know, just like how my ancestors let me know. \n\nThere are two places you will visit after death, the first one being \"The Island\". The Island is just a chunk of land in the middle of a pitch black void. This is where you'll stay before being fully forgotten. You'll be alive as you'll still require food and water to function, but you'll be dead as your body will slowly decompose and after some time, you will become a ghost.  \n\nThe Island is definitely the worst place I've ever been to. There are creatures there that will, if ran across, make you experience your top three worst fears. No one cares about anyone else there, so prepare to act selfish. Kindness is something those creatures don't like, and they will put you in that nightmare realm for the rest of eternity if they see you be kind. \n\nThe second one is \"The Neighborhood\". It's basically a street that goes on forever. Everything's in black and white, and there is no day night cycle here. When someone new arrives, a new house is added. Each house is made specifically for the owner's tastes, so you will like yours. You come here when no one remembers you. We don't require food, water or anything else -we're ghosts. We have internet connection, so we use social media apps and play games sometimes. We usually spend our time talking about our memories and other things.\n\nYou have a month before you die. Don't try to avoid it, instead try to make yourself forgotten so that you won't have to stay in The Island for too long.*\n\nThen she disappeared. \n\nAnyways, I should go get ready for work. \n\n                                                              17/02/23, 05.58pm\n\nI got back from work and just had dinner. The whole day I thought about that dream, and my coworker Alicia telling me about a dream she had a week ago that's very similar to mine, (except there was a man in her dream and he said she had a week before she died) definitely doesn't help.\n\nOkay... So I think I will just dismiss it if Alicia is alive tomorrow. If she dies tonight, I will trust that woman. I kind of have a plan for the latter scenario, but it's still in the works so I don't want to write it down right now.\n\n                                                              18/02/23, 05.13pm\n\nAlicia is dead.\n\nTime to carry out my plan.\n\n                                                                19/02/23, 3.37pm \n\nNever thought this would be so damn satisfying.\n\nIt started with my sister. I cried my eyes out when the police arrived, said I was asleep and found it in the morning today.\n\n                                                              21/02/23, 04.27pm \n\nFour murders in two days? The town is going crazy! Everyone is looking for the murderer! I really hope I'm not next :).\n\n                                                              26/02/23, 08.52pm \n\nSo the police started knocking on every door and questioning everyone in every house, even children. It's been a crazy four days, with a whopping eight deaths! They came to question me this morning, and all they found was a broken woman who's still not over the death of her beloved sister. They apologized for reminding me of her and left.  \n \n                                                              04/03/23, 07.45pm\n\nAnyone who could remember me is now gone. It's time to wait until the 17th. \n\n                                                              12/03/23, 10.47am  \n\nThe police just arrested a 46 year old man for the murders. All the bodies have been found in his basement and the fingerprints on the weapons used were matching his. He must've been a theatre kid as he was pretty decent at acting like he was innocent.\n\n                                                              17/03/23, 06.41am                                                                                                                       \n\nThree minutes left.\n\nI saw that woman in my dream again last night. She told me that I would die from food poisoning, and that she made breakfast for me. I found it in the morning. An omelette. What my grandma used to make.\n\nJust as delicious as I remember.\n\n------------------------------------------- \n\n*Being eternal comes with one bad side: If you've angered enough people, they will torture you until the end of time which is seemingly never. \n\nI found the notebook. You were so excited after you wrote your last sentence that you forgot to hide it. People need to know what you've done, so your diary is now available for tons of people to see.\n\nThis isn't what I had meant by \"make yourself forgotten\". Didn't your parents tell you how I spent my last months?  At home, isolated, away from all of you. Did I spend all that time in The Island for you to act like this? You've frustrated all the nice people here. You deserve whatever we might do to you. \n\nYou fucking psychopath. \n                 \n                                    I'm ashamed to be related to you.\n                                                                    -Your grandma.*",

        "text": "I don't think there was ever a time somebody didn't know that I was just indifferent and self-centered. I modeled my whole faith where I was essentially my own God in a world where we could all be gods in a sense, as I believed we are all God. It all seemed fine to me, although it led to me not really caring about events, there was nihilism at it's heart. \n\n Around a month ago I was called into work. I did maintenance work for a large company and they have been having some problems with animals that have been coming in to find warmth. I did my usual routine of grabbing my tools, took my impact battery off the charger and slid it into one pocket in my bag. I grabbed my gloves, my boots, and most importantly my coffee. I thought I was being called because of just the rats, but unfortunately I was wrong.\n\n I walked into the site and the member of management that called me explained the situation. Apparently a rat began to chew through some wiring and now the power seems to fluctuate. I sighed a heavy sigh and started to look for where they have been chewing. All I had to do was follow the smell of a Kentucky fried rat, or rather a few of them. The wiring definitely looked bad, but I figured it should be a quick job. The unfortunate thing is I had to rely on help from the man who called me in.\n\n I gave him a call and asked him to cut the power off while I checked the wire to make sure the power was off. I saw the little red light from the voltage tester telling me there is still power. \"It's off!\" The man says quite loudly. And after about ten seconds the light goes off. I decide to start cutting into the wire, but it seemed like God had other plans. It turns out the manager cut off the wrong breaker and by the worst stroke of luck, the cheap little voltage tester I have, it's batteries died at the moment it happened. All I know is the power I felt through me should have sent me to the hospital, but instead it was as if I was struck down by lightening.\n\n When the pain stopped, I felt an intense heat and was unable to see in the darkness. I made it to Hell it seems. I looked around and was in a line that kept moving as if time had no meaning. Soon I saw where the line led to, a bearded man who had another man with a darker beard. They spoke in a language I did not know and it slowly changed to English as he saw me.\n\n \"Raymond!\" The voice cried out with an angry sorrowful tone \"you are to be judged and we will see where you may spend your eternity.\" I was silent, this had to be some absurd near death dream being concocted by the fleeting chemicals in my brain. \"I am Moses\" said the voice \"You were given the laws I gave to you from our God and you shall be judged according to the laws.\" Yep.\" I am not going to heaven.\n\n \"Have you formed any Gods beside the one true God?\" I decided to just tell him what he wants to hear \"of course not!\" He looked down and I saw a tear. \"You are lying! The God you worshipped on Earth was a God of your making.\" He stated as I felt a cold hand on my feet. I looked down and saw fingers curling and digging into me. \"Please be honest with me son.\" He said as he asked \"have you made idols?\" I have never built anything to worship, so I felt confident in my answer \"No.\" I said it calmly and maybe a little to smug. Then I felt worms crawling on my feet making their way up. \"You have turned all of man into an idol of worship! Please don't make this harder than it needs to be.\" I could see the pain building up as he proceeds.\n\n \"Have you taken the name of our Lord in vain?\" I already knew I have \"yes.\" I said looking down as I felt the worms digging into my flesh. \"What about the Sabbath?\" \"Sir I have done an absolute disservice to the Sabbath and used it for my own pleasures\" and as I finished that, I felt teeth sinking into my legs from a rotting corpse. \"I have abandoned my parents! I have not murdered! I have cheated on every woman I have been with! I've stolen more than anyone I have ever known! I've lied about people to obtain goods that they had! I have broken nearly every commandment!\" I yelled in a quick fire session. And as soon as I did, corpses began to rise gnawing at my flesh dragging me down into what could only be described as a sea of burning gasses teeming with screams and bodies. And as I was being pulled I could hear from Moses \"I wish for my sake that our Lord could give you a chance before you fall to find he that could take your punishment.\" And in a bright flash, I woke up in the hospital bed.\n\nAfter this I went to church, I learned about Jesus taking my punishment for me at the moment of his death. That through him, I do not have to fear that torment. But it is a double-edged sword. I see why Moses cried as I answered, I know the fate of those who have been like me and I cry everyday in prayer wanting them to be saved as well, I can't bear the thought of my friends and family being added to that screaming sea. I have been comforted and I have found a new sorrow.",

        "text": "Regina was one of my mother's friends and her house was about 2 houses from mine. She lived with her husband, Roy, and her son and daughter-in-law. \n\nRoy used to work as a gardener. He would drink but only in moderate amounts and only on weekends. Son worked as security and his wife as a secretary. \n\nWhen the pandemic began and the lockdown started, Roy lost his job and that changed him. He became so depressed and angry that it was impossible to talk to him. He became a wife-beater and when the lockdown was over, the son and his wife moved out. \n\nHe began taking drugs and alcohol. She still had a job and became the breadwinner. He would take her money by force and spend it on alcohol. He became drinking more and more. Regina started showing bruises on her face and neck. But she always defended him. \n\nThis continued till last year when Roy collapsed on his way home and was taken to the hospital and diagnosed as suffering from End Stage Liver Disease. He became bedridden within a month. \n\nHis son refused to visit or help and so the burden of taking care of him fell on her. We would help out by giving her money or buying her a few essential grocery items. \n\nMy brother (John) and I decided to visit them as we hadn't seen her for a few days. She looked tired and she said she'll have to stay home more and can come only on alternate days. We said we understood and she looked relieved. \n\nWhen we entered Roy's room, he was staring out his window. We asked him what he looking at and he replied that last night he saw a man in the tree outside his window. We told him it would be too cold for anyone to climb a tree and stay there in the cold night and that he imagined it. He didn't look convinced. \n\nFrom then on, we'd visit them once a week and Roy would tell us that the man in the tree has started calling his name. He asked us to come to his room at around 10 or 11 at night and see for ourselves. My brother agreed. So that night, John made me go with him to their house. John put his chair near the window while I went to sleep in their guest bedroom. \nNext morning, John told us that he saw a shadow and he wanted us to sit with him. \n\nSo that night, all 3 of us sat with Roy. At around 11:30 Roy began to get restless and started saying that the man is calling him. We all looked outside and I thought I saw something move among the branches. John asked me if I saw it but since I  wasn't sure and I replied that I didn't. \n\nI didn't want to go back to their house but I wanted to know what was happening. So when John told me that he was planning on spending a few more nights at Roy's place, I told him that I wanted to go with him. \n\nThis went on for about 2 or 3 nights till one night Roy started saying that the man was coming towards the window. Again, I thought I saw something move but it was windy and I thought, maybe, someone must be walking along the road. Roy said he couldn't see the man anymore and we all waited to see where he would reappear. But nothing else happened that night and so John went back to his seat while I went with Regina to kitchen. \n\nShe made us coffee and then admitted to seeing something. We were discussing about seeing the shadow when we heard screaming coming from the room. \n\nWhen we entered the room, I saw John on the floor unconscious and Roy screaming \"He's here\". Regina pointed towards the window and I finally saw what Roy had been seeing all this time. It was tall dark figure, about 7 or 8 feet, it's eyes were dark and shimmering. Suddenly it lunged towards Roy and when it fell on top of him, it looked as if Roy was covered with a dark cloth. I didn't want to touch it and so I took the table lamp and tried to hit it. When I got close to it, it suddenly came towards me and I felt cold and unable to move. I couldn't see or hear anything. \n\nWhen I came to, I was on floor and Regina was crying. John was standing near me and he told me that Roy was dead. We didn't talk much as we had to help Regina arrange the funeral. I informed her son and after the funeral, he took Regina with him and sold the house. \n\nLater John and I told each other about what happened that night. Apparently, John tried to hit it with his fist and felt his pass through cold freezing air. Then he felt something cold strike him and he lost consciousness. \n\nEverything went back to normal and all of it felt like a bad dream. I haven't heard from Regina after she left to live with her son and I don't want to. \n\nTwo days ago, I was returning home from a party when I saw something move. I looked and saw it again and I think it felt I could see it because it stopped and looked back at me for a moment and ran towards a nearby house. Within seconds, I heard screams coming from that house. I ran the rest of the way to my house and locked all doors and windows. \n\nI guess my encounter with that thing has resulted me being able to see it. I don't know if John will be able to see it, as he refuses to talk about it . I hope I won't be so unlucky to see it come for me at my end.",

        "text": "My son’s imaginary friend had legs that bent the wrong way, like the crooked legs of a bird. He said every time his imaginary friend walked, the bones would poke out through the skin- yet he was able to move at inhumanly fast speeds, like a character in a video that has been played on fast-forward. My son had named this creepy friend “Mr. Grim.”\n\nNeedless to say, I found his new imaginary friend to be a trifle upsetting. When I told my wife about it, she said that it wasn’t just upsetting, but “absolutely fucking disturbing in every way imaginable.” \n\n“Why do his bones poke out through his skin?” she asked me. “That seems like fairly inappropriate imagery for a five-year-old.”\n\n“Maybe it is some subconscious projection for some accident victim he saw on TV,” I said thoughtfully. She rolled her eyes at this.\n\n“I don’t think they show dead car crash victims with their bones sticking out of their skin on Nickelodeon,” she said sarcastically. But we let it go, and continued on with our lives as normal. Johnny continued to talk about Mr. Grim and the adventures they went on, and we just kind of got used to it. After all, children have vivid imaginations, and I wasn’t the type to read into things too much. As a parent, I knew sometimes you just had to go with the flow and let them develop on their own.\n\nThat was before pets started to go missing in our neighborhood. The entire street became covered in “Missing” posters for local cats and dogs. None of their bodies were ever found. I didn’t know what to think about it, so I just didn’t. I just continued to go to work, spend time with my wife and enjoy life as much as I could. I would take Johnny out on weekend outings to amusement parks or nature trails. But one time when we were hiking together, he said something rather disturbing to me.\n\n“Mr. Grim says he knows what happens to the kitties and puppies,” he told me. I looked down at him sharply.\n\n“Johnny, that’s not funny,” I said. “There are some sick people out there, people who kill little animals for no reason. There are people out there who kill *kids* for no reason. That’s why your mom and I always tell you to avoid strangers and never get in a car with anyone besides your family. And you shouldn’t joke about the missing puppies and kitties.”\n\n“But dad,” he said plaintively, “I wasn’t joking. Mr. Grim said he took the puppies and kitties with him to his playground. He said that I can come with him one day, too. He says that no one hurts puppies or kitties there, or little kids. He said we all live forever with him, and that he never lets us go, because he loves us all too much and *wants* to be with us forever.” I looked down at his small, serious face, waves of dread rising inside my stomach.\n\n“Johnny, Mr. Grim isn’t real,” I said. “He is just an imaginary friend. That means he comes from your own mind, just like your dreams. They might feel real, but they’re all inside of you.” He just shook his head at this, like he couldn’t believe how slow his old dad was.\n\n“You’ll see soon, daddy,” he said. “Mr. Grim is as real as you and me. Maybe even realer, because he says he has been here a long, long time. He says he remembers the roads before there were any cars on them, back when they were all dirt. He says he remembers when horsies and donkeys were the only way around. He told me about it. It’s pretty weird to think about, daddy, how old he is. I didn’t know people could live that long.”\n\n“Johnny, if Mr. Grim was a real person and what you said was true, he would have to be over 130 years old. No one has ever lived that long. It isn’t possible. Don’t get carried away with this Mr. Grim stuff, because not everyone will understand like your mom and I do. Some people might think it’s… a little weird.” That was the end of the conversation, and we continued hiking in silence. I was deep in thought, wondering about all the strange things my son said.\n\nThe next day, kids started disappearing. It started with the Crabtree boy the next street over. From what I heard, he was playing in the backyard, in his sandbox. His mother looked out the window every minute or so while she did the dishes. Then she looked up and he was gone, his toys still in the same position, his little blue baseball cap upside down on the spot where he had been sitting. Mrs. Crabtree sprinted out, looking around frantically and screaming his name, but he was just gone. No sign of any strangers in the neighborhood, no suspicious cars, no random leads caught by stoplight cameras or doorbell cameras so ubiquitous in our little suburban neighborhood. There weren't even any footprints in the sandbox, neither the boy’s nor anyone else’s, except for the tracks that led to the middle of the sandbox where he had been sitting and playing. It was as if he had been raptured up into Heaven in the space of sixty seconds.\n\nThe police searched for weeks for that little boy, even using helicopters to search the endless woods that started at the north edge of town. Volunteers from around our county joined in, combing every square inch of woods within miles, diving into local lakes and checking abandoned buildings and sewers near the child’s house. There was not a sign of him anywhere. It was as if he had just vanished in the flash of an eye. After weeks of no news, the attention paid to it slowly started to die down. People forgot about the grieving parents and the missing child, like they always do in these kinds of situations.\n\nI was extremely busy at work, doing research into quantum entanglement and quantum computers at our state university. My wife had left to go spend time with her father, who had dementia and cancer and very suddenly took a turn for the worse, so I ended up having to take Johnny to work. I didn’t really mind, as he was a good boy who listened and very rarely got in trouble. The “Mr. Grim” thing was the only weird part of his young personality, but other than that, he was a fast learner, respectful, and acted in many ways like a child much older than himself.\n\nWe entered the quantum research laboratory, his little hand holding mine tightly as he stared around with wide, blue eyes. It smelled like cleaning chemicals and burning metal throughout the entire chamber, emanating even out into the hallways of the university building. My son wrinkled his tiny nose, making a comically cute face as he did so. I handed him a pair of safety glasses, putting one on myself, before he started up with his usual, child-like questioning.\n\n“Daddy, why does it smell like that?” he asked me. I shrugged.\n\n“It’s a lot of machines that consume huge amounts of power,” I explained simply to him. “This single building can consume as much power as hundreds of houses like ours. Some of this stuff-” I indicated with a wave of my hand, showing the gleaming circular vats, the massive metal tubes, the dozens of computer monitors, the tables with entire arrays of green lasers focused on tiny chips, “-is so cutting edge that we haven’t found a way to make it use less electricity yet. It can entangle physical particles or make computers that can do certain processes millions of times faster than conventional computers.” Most young children would not be able to comprehend the depth of statements like that, but Johnny was not a usual kid. His mind worked incredibly fast, and his vocabulary seemed much more developed than a normal five-year-olds’.\n\n“OK,” Johnny said simply, letting go of my hand so I could go hang up our coats and put a little plastic bag of food in the fridge. It was late, past dinner time on a Friday, and so the entire lab was already deserted. I was one of the few physicists who did much of his work at night, when all the equipment was open and I had the entire building to myself. On nights like this, I could play classical music on its highest volume and just be myself. I started playing an MP3 of Shostakovich on one of the many monitors around the lab, then began to move around and switch all the equipment on. My son sat in the corner, using colored pencils to draw while I worked.\n\nTonight I was using AI to try to increase quantum entanglement from just a few particles to a small diamond. Having turned all the cameras and monitoring equipment on, I activated the processor and watched all the lasers move in unison on the nearby laboratory table, now pointing at the diamond I had set in the middle of the setup. Johnny looked up as the computers all grew louder. I motioned for him to come close, to show him the most interesting part of the entire experiment. A humming, vibrating noise began to spread throughout the floor as the argon lasers became too bright to look at. I put an arm around Johnny, reassuring him.\n\nSuddenly, something began to go terribly wrong. The humming vibrations, which had been wave-like and measured, now began to come in chaotic pulsing waves, knocking equipment off the tables. The argon lasers began to falter and move out of position, burning holes in the tables and walls. An enormous crash of rending metal and glass came from behind me, and I quickly jumped on Johnny, tackling him to the floor and protecting him with my own body until it would all be over.\n\nAs another computer station fell over, sending shards of glass flying that sliced into my left arm, leaving large droplets of blood on the floor next to us, the power finally went out, and we were submerged in blackness. All I could hear now was Johnny’s heavy breathing mixing with my own. Then, suddenly, I heard the skittering footsteps of something large coming from my right.\n\n“Is it over?” Johnny asked in a trembling voice.\n\n“I think so, kiddo,” I said reassuringly, getting off of him and slowly standing up in the pitch dark. I fumbled in my pockets for my cell phone, turning on the flashlight app and shining it around.\n\nAt first, I saw only destruction- smashed monitors, smoking computers, massive holes everywhere. I thought to myself how lucky we were that the whole place hadn’t gone up in flames. As I kept turning, though, I saw something far more horrific.\n\nA small boy stood in the corner with black, stringy hair. His skin looked drained of blood, white as a vampire’s, and blood constantly bubbled out of his mouth, sliding down his chin in red streaks. He wore the ragged remains of what might have been a plaid shirt and jean shorts, but they were so bloody and torn that it was impossible to tell. His bare legs were bent the wrong way, and he started to walk towards me slowly like a bird, his knees bending backwards. The bone stuck out through his shins, calves and thighs, and as he walked, a nauseating cracking sound echoed around the room, like bone loudly crushing and breaking against other pieces of itself.\n\n“Hiya there,” he said in a deep, gurgling speech. “My name, as you surely know, is Mr. Grim. I am a friend of your son’s, and I hope soon, a friend of yours.” I stood there, speechless, shining my light on this abomination. He bowed slightly and waved his thin, bony arm around the room. “Sorry for the destruction, but I had to take any means to materialize, and the massive amounts of energy in this room was able to give me the physical form I needed. I couldn’t keep on as some minor… poltergeist!” He laughed at this, spraying tiny droplets of blood on the floor in front of him as he did so. I didn’t see the humor in it.\n\n“Look,” I said, putting my hands up, as if I were dealing with a rabid dog, “I’m sorry for any misunderstanding, but you need to go back to where you came from. This is not OK. My son and I cannot have a…. a….” What was he, exactly? A monster? A demon? Mr. Grim waved away my objections with a flick of his hand.\n\n“That is not up to you, Jack,” he said congenially. “You cannot send me back, and if you try to stop me, I will kill your son in front of you, and then I will kill you too.” My son’s little hand tightened on me. I felt him trembling behind me.\n\n“Daddy, I’m scared,” he whispered to me in a low voice. “I want to go home.”\n\n“I know, Johnny,” I said quietly. “I do too.” But what could I do? I had no gun, and I wasn’t sure if this thing could even be killed anyway.\n\nAt that moment, the backup generators kicked on, and the laboratory was filled with the glow of red emergency lights. \n\n“Alright,” I said, reaching a decision. “My son and I are leaving. Do not follow us.” I had decided to call 911 and let the professionals deal with this. Maybe they could call in the National Guard, I thought with a small smile. They could fill this thing full of enough full-auto weapons fire to leave him looking like Swiss cheese.\n\n“Ah,” Mr. Grim said congenially, “I am sorry, but I need your son.” He smiled at me, an eerie ear-to-ear grin that showed all of his bloody teeth and the countless sores on his blackened gums. “I used a lot of energy materializing, and I need food. I will let you live, however, Jack.” His smile widened, as if he were offering me some kind of present. “Just leave the boy, get in your car and drive home, and you can live a full life.” As he spoke, I got an idea. We were much closer to the door than Mr. Grim. \n\nI quickly dropped my phone in my pocket, picked up a large computer and hurled it Mr. Grim’s broken legs. I heard a demonic cry of pain, his voice sounding like dozens of voices crying at once in a disharmonious shriek. Ignoring it, I picked up Johnny and ran outside the lab. \n\nThe door had a number pad on it. I pressed the top button and began rotating the thumb turn away from the hinges, locking the thick wooden door just as something heavy crashed into it on the other side. The knob turned furiously, but it wouldn’t budge without the correct numerical code.\n\n“OK, that should buy us some time,” I said quietly, grabbing Johnny’s hand and running out through the blood-red emergency lights. The laboratory began erupting in a cacophony of breaking equipment as I called 911, informing them of an intruder and telling them the man was likely armed and dangerous. Then I got Johnny to my car and we sped out of there, my adrenaline still high, my heart beating hard in my chest.\n\nThe police ended up finding the laboratory destroyed but empty. As the days went on, I wondered if the entire thing was some sort of shared delusion. But then kids started disappearing from our town and the surrounding towns at an alarming rate. I bought a gun for protection, and my neighbors and I began to do a local neighborhood watch.\n\nOne time while I was out patrolling in the middle of the night, I saw that thing again- Mr. Grim. I could tell it was him instantly from the way he walked, the crunching of shattered bones and the superhuman speed as he disappeared into the backyard of a nearby house. I followed him quietly, checking that the safety on my gun was off.\n\nI saw a child exiting the backdoor of his house as Mr. Grim crept in the bushes. The child looked hypnotized, his eyes totally blank. Mr. Grim waved his hands and clicked his tongue, and a small spark of light in the middle of the backyard expanded to show a massive, brightly-colored playground. Even though it was night here, on the playground it was daytime, and I saw countless kids in it. Some of them were hung in nooses by their necks from the monkeybars, others were buried alive up to their heads in the sandbox. He had even crucified a few on the wooden beams of the playset, nailing their hands and feet together as rivulets of blood dripped into the sandbox below. They all had their mouths opened in a shared and silent scream as the hypnotized child walked quietly towards the vision.\n\n“No, stop!” I said, raising my gun to point it directly at Mr. Grim’s head. He snarled like a rabid dog at me, beginning to run at me with a superhuman speed, his bent legs snapping and popping, and I fired. His head exploded in a shower of black, rotted flesh and maggots, the smell of decomposing meat filling the air. Behind him, the vision slowly closed back into a pinprick of light, then went out entirely.\n\nI called the police, telling them the truth, keeping an eye on the strange, demonic body of Mr. Grim as I did so. It wasn’t the police that ended up showing up, but some secretive federal agency that quickly took possession of the body and swore me to secrecy, giving me a check for $100,000 in exchange for signing an NDA that stated I would never tell anyone about the supernatural events that had occurred in the last few weeks. I gladly took the check and signed the document.\n\nAfter all, who would believe me?",

        "text": "When I in elementary school I would wake up early so I could get to the bus stop on time. After a while I began to notice the same black car parked across the street everyday. But I didn't really think much of it. A month of so later, my friend and I again noticed the black car, but this time it was following our bus. We would whisper about it as we kept turning in our seats to see if it was still there. When we'd get to school we'd tell our friends about it. Then we'd all discuss what it may be in the corner of the field by the fence. During one of our little discussions we saw a car that had circled our school enough times for us to realize it wasn't normal. \n\nThat car was the black car that parked across my bus stop, followed my bus to school, and was now circling my school. \n\nWe were scared. We didn't know what to do or if we could even do anything. We had eventually collectively agreed it was most likely a kidnapper. From that point on our conversations and recess breaks were spent looking for sketchy cars and talking about kidnapping. We spoke of our own fears and even experiences concerning kidnapping. But nothing could take our minds off my friend and I's current situation\n\nWe tried our best to get home as quickly as possible and keep an eye on the car when it was parked by our bus stop or school. It eventually began to park across the street from my house. I could see it from the upstairs window, I would stare at it when I got home from school. I remember one time it wasn't there. The next day at school my friend, who was at the same bus stop as me, told me the car had followed her home and had parked across the street from her house. Just as it had done to me. \n\nWe got really scared after that. And after another recess discussion, my friend and I deiced to call the cops on her phone. After school we waited in my house for the car to park and, from what we could tell, to be empty.\n\nWe had ran up to the car, planning to write the license plate number down. My friend fumbled with her phone's keyboard as I kept watch. \n\nI remember this intense fear, this adrenaline, like it had just happened.\n\nI looked into the car, to see if there was anything inside. The windows were slightly tinted, which made it hard to see inside, especially with the glare from the sun. But as I squinted, leaning forward, trying to see inside, I thought I could make out some sort of figure in the drivers seat. I had gasped in realization as I locked eyes with the owner of the black car. Sitting inside, watching us write his license plate down. Staring. Watching. I couldn't breathe. I was like a dear in headlights. Tome felt slow as I watched this murky figure lift his arm and click the ceiling light of the car. I could see his blank stare, that horrifying grin, and the knife he was holding against the steering wheel. I felt lightheaded. I wanted to run, but I just couldn't move. \n\nMy friend, thankfully, looked up and saw me staring. She took one glance at the front window, grabbed my wrist, and ran as fast as she possibly could. All I could hear was the pounding of our shoes on the hot pavement and the distant sound of a car door slamming. I turned, only for a moment, and saw the man standing by that black car, still grinning.\n\nWe ran into my house, locked the doors, and called the police. It took a few tries to gather the courage to actually tell the operator what happened, but we did.  All the while, we were shaking and on the verge of tears. \n\nI don't think I ever saw that black car or that man again. But I still get that fear when I see a Black Car to this day.\n\nBe careful my fearful friends",

        "text": "If you’re seeing this, me and my colleague are probably already dead. I’m a dog trainer in training and work more often with smaller breeds. The family had me and my co-worker come over, she said to not turn your back to the boat. They have a boat in their backyard near a trailer. I asked why, and the mother said that I don’t need to know yet.\n\nOk.. red flag already. She just wanted me to trust her about always one of us facing the boat. But, we just  went along with it. She also wanted us to make sure that the dogs didn’t go anywhere near the boat either)\n\nThey were taking a business trip with their kids as well for the week. They wanted us to train their dogs over the week with new tricks.\n\nMy colleague was showing me how to use treats for dog training, and how to get them to heel. She wanted me to try, and I kept facing the boat till she walked over to face it as well. We had to describe to each other in detail what was happening since we couldn’t look away.\n\nThe first three days were good. But, something strange happened on the fourth day. The boat moved. I didn’t think much of it, while my co-worker told me that I shouldn’t be so lenient about it.\n\nWe did what we usually did. Kept an eye on the boat and trained the dogs. But, I saw a shadow move behind the boat.\n\nNow, we had to walk backwards to get to the house, till we touched the door. And make sure all the dogs were inside by 10:59 P.M., and couldn’t go out till 4:59 A.M. They have 14 dachshunds. So, we barely made it occasionally.\n\nBut, as I was saying, there was a shadow behind the boat, and it moved. I asked my colleague to check it out. One of the dogs was near the boat and got a scratch. It wasn’t a big one, but I worried more than I should’ve.\n\nThe fourth day was creepy. But, day five was even worse. I let my guard down. I let one of the puppies get near the boat. There was a huge scratch along her back. It wasn’t deep, but it was bigger than the day prior.\n\nWe made sure she was alright. Which was my fatal mistake. I walked to my colleague, who was across the yard. I quickly looked at the boat again. There was a tall figure by it. There were two fishing rods stuck on his hand. I yelled to my co-worker to get the dogs inside as I ran to the house while getting their attention. \n\nYou can’t outrun him. He has accurate aim and he got me at the back of my shirt. My colleague got the dogs inside but tried to rescue me. And that was her fatal mistake.\n\nWe were both reeled in like fish. Instead of letting us go, he tossed us in the boat. The figure soon put the boat in its original spot, as all our bones were crushed during transportation.\n\nI saw the family come to the backyard when they returned. They didn’t bother to check inside the boat. Instead, they smiled crookedly.\n\nIf you find a house with a boat in the back yard, keep an eye on it until it’s out if site. Unless you want the same fate as I did.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10iibwn/im_a_night_groundskeeper_at_a_golf_course_i_found/",
        "text": "Previous Part  [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/xxwanb/im_a_night_groundskeeper_at_a_golf_course_i_found/)\n\nWhere it all began [Part One](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/xp8u2e/im_a_night_groundskeeper_at_a_golf_course_i_found/)\n\nI opened the door of my small security booth and was surprised to see that no one was there, that is until I looked down. There standing on my doorstep was a child no more than nine. He stood with his weight shifted on one leg and had his arms crossed as he tapped his foot. His small baseball hat bobbed up and down as he fidgeted.\n\n“Uhm, can I help you little guy? You lost?” I asked, I crouched to get face to face with him.\n\n“Yeah, lost my fucking mind. I thought you Auditors were to be professionals, yet here I stand talking to what is obviously an ape in a human costume.” He said.\n\n“The fuck..” I mumbled, getting up from my crouched position.\n\n“Yeah, I’m just as disappointed. The other guy wasn’t half as patronizing.” \n\n“Who are you?” I asked.\n\n“I’m the guy that needs you to shut the fuck up and listen to instructions, maybe after you prove yourself more useful than a household pet I’ll give you my name. Don’t bother giving me yours, I’ll just call you dog from now until you earn my respect.”\n\nThe kid turned and walked away from me. I was aghast to say the absolute least. I didn’t know who the fuck this little brat thought he was, but I wasn’t anybody’s damn dog. So I stood there inside the door and watched him take a few steps away from the booth until he stopped.\n\n“I told you to come, Dog.”\n\nA wave of nausea washed over me in an instant. I doubled over and emptied my breakfast, lunch, and dinner all over the booth. I had never felt so much vertigo in my life. My head was spinning so much so that my balance left me and I slipped and fell into my own vomit, coating myself head to toe.\n\n“Haha, you know what dogs do with their vomit?” The kid asked.\n\nAll of a sudden my body started to move on its own. Somehow my movements were going in reverse. I un-slipped on my vomit and was pulled back up into the position I had been in before the nausea started. All the while the contents of my stomach were being sucked back up. I could feel the now lukewarm bile and chunks of wet food slide back into my mouth and down my throat. \n\nI doubled over once more and held my stomach. All I could think about was the wet semi solid mass off half digested food sliding back down inside me. I could almost feel it happening again as I replayed it over and over in my mind. Making me eject the gritty contents of my stomach for a second time.\n\n“What the hell was that?!” I managed to squeeze out after I finished vomiting.\n\n“That was a warning. It’s a lot worse coming out the other end. Now hurry along.”\n\nThe boy began waking and I quickly followed. I wanted to ring his little neck, but I thought better of it. I didn’t want to find out what the hell he meant by the other end.\n\nTo my surprise instead of heading deeper into the gulf course he went right past the gate and walked out onto the street. I hadn’t thought that these denizens could actually leave the golf course. I guess it wasn’t outside the scope of logic, because of what happened to Fry and the tape recorder.\n\n“Where are we going?” I asked.\n\n“Ugh, the store Dog, and make sure you stay three paces behind so I don’t have to smell you.” The boy said.\n\n“Why? Don’t they have food wherever you’re from? Cause, I doubt you're actually a little boy with that shit you just pulled back there.”\n\n“Wow, it has eyes. Of course I’m not a damn child, though what I am is of no concern to you. And yes, we do have food, just not what I’m after.”\n\n“How the hell can you just leave the golf course though? I thought everything weird just kinda stayed inside?”\n\n“That’s where you come in. Almost all the denizens can’t survive one step outside the gate, lucky for you, because if we could your world would have been over a very long time ago. We need a catalyst to leave.” \n\n“So what? Would you vanish if I got too far away from you?”\n\n“After a while yeah, but there are ways of surviving after you lose contact with a catalyst.”\n\n“So you’re like a leach?”\n\nJust as the words left my mouth I felt a deep rumbling in my stomach. The kind of rumbling where you need to hold the bottom of your ass while you run to a bathroom. \n\n“A what?” The boy asked.\n\n“Nothing! I misspoke!” I shouted.\n\n“Don’t let it happen again.”\n\nWhatever was doing back flips in my stomach slowly faded as we walked on. After a while I thought it was safe enough to continue my questioning. Being more careful with my word choice of course.\n\n“Don’t people come and go everyday? Why don’t you guys just hitch a ride on one of them?” I asked.\n\n“Not just anyone will do. It needs to be someone that knows about us and is a willing ferry. Even then, not many of the lower beings can even manage that.”\n\n“Well I guess you guys have a funny definition of willing. I damn sure didn’t sign up for this.”\n\n“Oh, but you did. You’re an Auditor and you are willing by default. You should really be careful when you leave. Be sure to wipe your feet on the way out. Wouldn’t want any nasties out in the world.”\n\nWe walked for a bit more until we got to the local drug store just a few blocks away from the golf course. We entered and the kid went straight to the clerk. Apparently they knew each other because the clerk handed the kid a small brown paper bag without saying a word. The kid handed him something in return, but I didn’t see what it was. We exited the store and started making our way back to the golf course.\n\n“Now I may be an old man, but I know a drug deal when I see one.” I said.\n\n“Very perceptive for a dog.” The kid shot back.\n\n“What, they don’t have weed where you come from?”\n\n“No, and it’s not weed in the bag.”\n\n“Well what is it?”\n\n“It’s something for the pain. You’ll see in a short while, the night’s not over yet.”\n\nAs we walked I could see a pair of headlights up ahead and slowly closing the distance between us. The kid got closer to me and to my surprise even grabbed my hand as we walked. His hand felt warm clasped in my own, I’m not sure why I was surprised by this. Maybe him being something other than human automatically made me think of him as a monster. I just couldn’t imagine a monster with such small and warm hands. I held him tight and pulled him in closer as we walked along.\n\nI could see that it was a police car and my heart started to race a bit. A grown man walking the streets at night with a 9 year old boy wasn’t exactly a good look. I tried to just keep my head down and walk, hoping the cop would just pass us by, but the closer he got the more I could hear him slowing down. The old breaks of his cruiser made an eerie squeak as he cruised along the street. I could feel his eyes on us while mine were fixated on the pavement. I didn’t want to draw any unwanted attention, but the holes I could feel burning into me as his gazed drew near made it apparent that wasn’t going to happen.\n\nThe cops' tires cried out for the last time as he finally stopped. I turned to meet his expectant gaze, but just before I could I felt a tug at my jacket sleeve. I looked down at the boy. His deep brown eyes staring up at me. For the first time since we’ve met I saw him smile. He wore a wide grin and began jumping up and down as he pointed to the policeman. \n\n“Daddy, daddy look! It’s a police car!” The kid said excitedly.\n\n“It sure is son. Why don’t you wave to the nice policeman.” I said, not missing a beat.\n\nThe kid smiled and waved and so did I, finding that the smile he wore was now plastered onto my face also. For a moment I felt something. Call it nostalgia or maybe even happiness, but that smile and those eyes, I’m not sure, but it didn’t seem like the boy was faking it. At that moment I’m not sure I was either.\n\nThat is until reality came crashing down knocking me out of whatever dreamland stupor I had been in. Instead of the cordial face of a public peace officer, what I saw was a gray colored wall of skin looking back at me. There were no facial features to speak of. Only a smooth surface where a face should have been\n\nI pulled the boy even closer to me. It took all I had to keep a smile plastered on my face and my hand waving in the air. The thing just waved its hand at us, gave me a slight nod and drove on. It wasn’t until the car had rounded the corner did the boy let go of my hand. He wiped it on his shirt before speeding up his pace to get ahead of me. So much for our little moment I guess.\n\n“What the fuck was that!” I yelled in a whisper.\n\n“A mimic. Not a very good one either.” \n\n“Where the fuck did it come from?” I asked.\n\n“Probably latched onto you before we left. I told you to wipe your damn feet.”\n\n“How the fuck do I even do that? How the hell am I supposed to tell if a damn ghost is caught on my foot or not.”\n\n“Just check, you’ll catch on soon enough.”\n\n“So what do we do about that thing? Will it kill people if it’s just left to run loose?”\n\n“Yeah, probably that is how a mimc subsists after disconnecting with a catalyst. I mean if you had a gun you could have shot it, but I wouldn’t suggest taking it on hand to hand, or at all. Just let nature take its course.”\n\n“Me? You’re the one with the freaky vomit, time powers and shit. Couldn’t you like, make its head explode or something?”\n\n“Ahh, that only works on humans and quit your whining it’ll be dead in less than a week. You saw how it looked. How long do you think until people find out about it and kill it?”\n\n“Well wouldn't people investigate and find out about the golf course?” I asked.\n\n“Again, that's where you come in. You either tell them to fuck off or make sure they can’t go fuck off. Look, if you wanna go ghost hunting go for it, but do that shit on your own time. We got more work to do.”\n\nI followed the kid back to the golf course and we made our way to hole 4. Hole 4 wasn’t anything all that special, it was actually one of the more hated holes on the course. There was a slight bend to the green right next to the cup that would send balls wide to the right where a swampy pool of water lay in wait.\n\nThey say if you're putting hole 4 on the green, you're putting it in the stream. I never was one for golfing so I didn’t live the frustration myself. I did however misplace a few steps while walking past and almost ended up in the water if the kid hadn’t grabbed me just in time.\n\n“Thanks haha. Getting wet tonight wasn’t on the memo.” I said.\n\n“The last thing you wanna do is get in that water.”\n\nThe kid's voice was slurred. A far cry from the uppity and large vocabulary he had before. I saw that he had dropped the brown bag and it lay before his feet between us. The kid was swaying back and forth on shaky legs, it looked like he was about to fall down, but he somehow managed to stay upright. \n\nHe stared at the water with low hung eyes. He breathed deeply in and out like he was preparing for something. Then he walked into the water. It was only about two and half feet, but because he was so small the water came up to just below his waist.\n\nHe stood there in the water just looking at me, I didn’t say a word. He winced a few times before he suddenly sunk to chest level and bobbed back up like a buoy. Except that his entire lower body was gone. His intestines floated lazily out of the gaping hole where his legs had been. The water now tainted a deep red where the blood oozed out of him and mixed with it.\n\nHe never said a word. Just floated there, still breathing, although now his breaths were more labored. I could see the wetness pooling in the corners of his eyes reflecting off of the moonlight as he stared into the sky. He made a slight moan as his eyes began retreating back into his skull deeper and deeper until they were gone completely. \n\nThe clouds overtook the moon along with the faint light that it gave off and we were shrouded in darkness and silence. I felt sorry for the kid even if he was a being not from this world, and an asshole, he still looked like a child. When he grabbed my hand I felt a feeling I hadn’t felt in a very long time and when I looked at him and smiled I think there was a hint of sincerity in it.\n\nI don’t know why he had to die like this. Or really why any of the freaky shit around here happens the way that it does. I do know that seeing a child die is never easy, doesn’t matter how many times you’ve seen it. I had to push those thoughts out of my mind, now wasn’t the time for that.\n\nI stood there and waited until the clouds parted and the moon once again showered me in its light. The boy wasn't there anymore. The only thing left was a red pool that waded down the stream and into the filters below.\n\nI grabbed the brown paper bag he had dropped and walked back to my booth. When I got back I opened the bag to find two empty medicine bottles, one was labeled Hydrocodone, the other was Codeine. I shoved the bottles in the trash and grabbed the journal from the dresser. Maybe a tale from my predecessor would keep the creeping thoughts in my mind at bay.\n\nThe next entry reads as follows:\n\n*The Woodsman looked me up and down and then back at the fire. Through his grizzled beard and wrinkled skin I could see he had a sullen look about him. Like he was sad to see I had come or maybe it was that I had to in the first place.*\n\n*The Woodsman had his hands up like he was trying to get warm by the fire, but I could see almost the opposite was true. As his hands waved in front of him, so did the fire and all its wondrous colors. They were in a dance of sorts, like a tango, moving as one but separate all the same.*\n\n*When he drew breath the fire grew bigger and the colors inside took on deeper hues with some changing entirely. Once he exhaled the fire lay dormant again and the colors returned to their original state.*\n\n*I could only watch in awe at what I was witnessing. Not only to the beautiful display of colors, but to the Woodsman himself. I could feel a warmth emanating from him. Oddly enough, it seemed to me I had felt this kind of warmth before. Like being tucked in by your parents at bedtime or a warm glass of milk in the middle of the night. There was a comfort to the man that was almost nostalgic in nature.*\n\n*The Woodsman lifted his hands into the air and the fire came with them. High into the air the fire raged. It almost looked like it would become out of control and for a moment the image of the gulf course engulfed in fire and ash crossed my mind. It was a nice thought. Only stopped by the intense heat I felt consumed me while I watched the Woodsman try and tame the fire down into a lantern just beside him.*\n\n*Once the struggle was over the Woodsman took the lantern and latched it onto his belt. He stood up from the smoldering embers and faced me. His towering figure was imposing.*\n\n*“I-I’m guessing you're the Woodsman?” I stammered.*\n\n*“Far as I know.” He said with a smile.*\n\n*He extended his hand to me and I shook it. I felt a warmth much like the fire. I could almost see those same vibrant colors.* \n\n*“Uhh, mind letting go?” He asked.*\n\n*I looked down to see that my hand was still firmly grasped onto his. I quickly withdrew my hand in embarrassment.*\n\n*“Haha. Sorry about that.” I said sheepishly.*\n\n*“Ahh, it’s alright. Don’t worry about it.”*\n\n*“I- uhh need your help Mr. Woodsman.”*\n\n*“Please, Mr. Woodsman was my father. Call me Montey.”*\n\n*“Alright Montey. I was told to come here That you could help me?”*\n\n*“Yeahhh, I heard you were on your way, but I got some bad news, kid. I can’t really do anything for you.”*\n\n*“What? I thought you could help? I went through a lot to get here Montey, please. I don’t know what else to do.”*\n\n*“Well just because I can’t help doesn’t mean you don’t have any options. I have to warn you though,they aren’t very good options.”*\n\n*“I guess I don’t have much choice.”*\n\n*“Well alright. The first one is to just stay here and keep doing our job. The One Who Sings is pretty picky and if he thinks he can get to you easily then he won't go after your loved ones. Uh, you do have loved ones right?”*\n\n*“Yes, I have loved ones.”*\n\n*“Oh alright, good. Or not good I guess.” Montey offered an awkward laugh before he kept talking.*\n\n*“The second option would be to use that fancy watch of yours and try and take the fight to him, but I don’t recommend it.”*\n\n*“I’m not sure about that. I don’t even know what the hell this thing actually does.”*\n\n*“You don’t know? I thought he would have given you something like an instruction manual or something.”*\n\n*“Nope. I think that's what you're supposed to be.”*\n\n*“Ahh, makes sense. Sooo that watch actually controls all of the denizens that inhabit this golf course.”*\n\n*“Is that why the tree things helped me after I pushed a button on it?”*\n\n*“The Watchers? Nah, they just don’t like that thing that was chasing you. The wind was actually because of the watch… I think.”*\n\n*“You mean I can control the wind?”*\n\n*“I mean yeah, I guess… I don’t know.” Montey shrugged.*\n\n*“Wow, thanks man.” I rolled my eyes.*\n\n*“Look, the takeaway is that the very nature of this place will come to aid you in your time of need so long as you keep that watch on hand.” I could tell Montey was getting a bit irritated. Though, I couldn’t tell if it was from all my questions or at his lack of answers.*\n\n*“Alright, so how do we take the fight to The Guy Who Sings or whatever?”*\n\n*“We? What do you mean we?” Montey asked, raising his hands and taking a step back.*\n\n*“We. Like, as in us. Together.”*\n\n*“Sorry kid, but all I can offer is guidance.”*\n\n*“What do you mean guidance? You just controlled that fire! Can’t you use your fire powers to maybe burn him or something?”*\n\n*“Okay, so I don’t control all the fire. Just the one inside this lantern. Which is actually the soul of this very golf course or at least the weird parts.”*\n\n*“What?! Why don’t you put some water on that shit then and let's kill this damn place?!”*\n\n*I could tell Montey was a bit taken aback by my suggestion. I could tell I had offended him, but I really didn’t understand why.*\n\n*“Because that would only make things worse. Putting out this fire wouldn’t kill all these creatures. It would only make them go mad. The body without a soul would just become a writhing beast. I promise that's a lot worse than what we currently have to deal with.”*\n\n*“Alright man, so how do I take the fight to him then? You know where he is?” I asked.*\n\n*“Nahh, I don’t. Finding The One Who Sings isn’t going to be as easy as taking a left at the next tree. You should do some favors for the denizens around here. Ya know, like your job? Most of ‘em believe in an eye for an eye so I’d start with them.” Montey said.*\n\n*“You want me to help these monsters out here?! These things are trying to fucking kill me!” I yelled.*\n\n*This time Montey’s frustration was entirely visible. I could tell he was deeply hurt by my words. He shook his head at me and began walking away.*\n\n*“Tell that to the Watchers who just helped save your ass. You won't last long with an attitude like that. In my opinion it seems like you don’t really deserve to.”*\n\n*Montey’s words stung a bit more harshly than I expected. I could tell he felt like he was a part of this place just as much as anything else I saw around here. Maybe I was thinking about this all wrong. Maybe thinking that everything was out to get me was the wrong way to go about dealing with this situation.* \n\n*Montey’s light flickered and I could hear it crackle inside the lantern as he walked further into the woods. I turned around back in the direction that I came, but before I took a step, I looked up. I could see the bulbous eyes of the Watchers casting their gaze down on me. I took a deep breath and said in the most heartfelt tone I could muster.*\n\n*“Thank you.”*\n\n*All at once they blinked. I could hear the trees parting ahead making a clear path back to the golf course. I looked behind my back and I could see the lights of Montey’s lantern flare up, just for a second, before settling into the darkness once again.*\n\nAnd that's the end of that entry. A bit short I know, but the guys got a lot going on. Him and I both… I think I’ll try and take a page out of his book, figuratively I mean. I should try and make myself known a bit more among the denizens, earn a few brownie points. Never know when I might need a bit of help myself.\n\nAnyway, the suns coming up so I’ll fill you guys in on the next entry and whatever else happens to me on my next shift. Here's hoping it’s something good this time.",

        "text": "I am scared. I don’t know what to do. It’s been happening for the last three days - I have even contacted the cops, but he’s literally only here when the cops aren’t. He is very careful - not even my neighbours have seen him, but at least they saw a suspicious looking car, which made me look sane in front of the police. \n\nI am just a normal citizen of this country. I go to my workplace (I am a cashier at a nearby convenience store), pay my taxes, hand-pick 2-3 friends and live in my mother’s house. She has given the house to me and has gone for a trip with her friends.\n\nIt was friday. I had taken the entire weekend off and had decided to stay in all day long, watch some movies- maybe order some pizza. My mother would be coming home soon, so I didn’t want to waste this opportunity and relax to the fullest.  \n \n\nHaving just come from the supermarket with a bag full of chips and soda, I slumped down on the sofa and started the television. I spent the next few minutes deciding on what to watch and finally decided on one of my most favorite movies of all time - Shutter Island. Some people didn’t like the twist at the end, but oh my god did I love it. I felt like I truly understood Di Caprio’s Teddy. \n\nHalfway through the movie my door knocked. I live in my mom’s house and the house is in a pleasant yet lonely neighbourhood. Our neighbourhood had only 3 houses, with a garden of our own. A ten minute walk down a small road opened up near the main road from where we connect to the city.   \n It is beautiful though. Lush greeneries surround us with a touch of modern architecture. \n\nOne of our neighbours had gone on a world tour so their house was currently vacant. Not that I care particularly. They were noisy. Every time I went by their house I could literally quite hear their loud moaning.   \n But they weren’t bad people either. It was fun hanging out with them sometimes. Just having a respite from the lovey-dovey couple, from whom I get relationship complex, seemed good enough.\n\nMy other neighbours were an elderly couple. They usually just kept to themselves. They were good people. Polite and good to look at. I really hope to find someone who will stay with me till the end and end up being like them.\n\nSince our house was situated a little away from the main road, I had expected the elderly couple to have come knocking. They might have brought me some homemade food -they were really sweet in that manner.\n\nI opened the door to an unknown man. He was tall, bulky and had long hair falling down till his shoulder. The way he kept his hair, a lot of his facial features were hidden, but you could clearly see his expressions. Since it was night time, his total appearance looked scary to say the least.\n\n“Yes…?” I asked, keeping the door inclined and only showing my head.\n\n“I am looking for Tamara. Is she here?” he asked in a deep voice.\n\nHuh, that’s a name I had heard for the first time. Thinking that this might be a mistake I replied - “I don’t know any Tamara. Maybe you’ve got the wrong address.” and proceeded to close the door.\n\nThe man pushed against the door slightly, making me unable to shut the door. I immediately got scared at that moment. If that man decided to come in forcefully, I couldn’t in any circumstances help myself. \n\n“I am here for Tamara. I know she’s here.” He said in his deep voice. \n\n“I am sorry I really don’t know any Tamara.” I squeaked. Seeing that he was in no mood to back off I gathered some courage and spoke up “If you do not leave at this very moment, I will call the cops.”  \n \n\nThat luckily seemed to do the trick. The man looked confused a little, then turned and walked towards his car. I waited until he was long gone and made sure that I locked my doors. Slumping down on the sofa, I could hear my heart beating. I was sure that the man might come in to assault me or rob me. \n\n# ------ \n\nI called my friend that night, asking her if I should be concerned and maybe alert the cops. She was unexpectedly really calm and told me to cool down. She said that maybe it was literally a mistake, because if the guy really wanted to he could have barged in and done whatever he wanted - it’s not like anyone was really around to stop him.   \n That made sense and I took a deep breath. Maybe I was thinking too much. I laughed and decided that it’s time to go to sleep. Unexpectedly I had a pretty good sleep. Little did I know that it would be my last peaceful sleep in a long time.\n\n# ------\n\nThe next day went pretty normal. I went to the supermarket, brought groceries, had a long walk in a nearby park. Even though I was a little shaken from last night’s incident, I convinced myself that it was okay.\n\nThis was second night in a row staying alone. Only 2 more days before my mother gets home. This time I put on a different movie - Shawshank Redemption. Again a classic. I know I know. But what can I do I just love the old classic movies.\n\nWhile watching the movie, I fell asleep. I woke up to the sudden pounding on my door. Startled I checked the time- 12:33 A.M. This was no time for anyone to come knocking at my door. Scared, I got up and grabbed hold of the nearest weapon type thing near to me - a vase.\n\nSlowly I walked towards the door. I looked through the eyehole to see a man with a black hoodie on. It was raining outside, and with our street lights flickering I would be lying if I said he didn’t look scary.\n\n“Who are you?” I said from inside, with a squeaky voice.\n\n“I need to talk to Tamara.” Came the same deep voice from yesterday.\n\n“I told you I don’t know any Tamara. Stop harassing me or I will call the cops.” I said in my most threatening voice, which still came out a little weak.\n\nThe man outside just grunted in response and I saw him leaving. After about a minute I dared to open my door, and luckily he wasn’t there no more.\n\nI rushed inside my house, and locked the door tightly. Wrapping my blanket around me I called my friend again. I couldn’t reach her. Scared I tried to call my mom, but to no avail. Her phone seemed switched off. \n\nI was debating on whether I should call the cops or not when I heard a bang. It was the kind of noise when someone tries to force the way through the back door.\n\nImmediately I rung 911. \n\n“Hello. 911.” \n\n“Someone’s trying to enter my house, I don’t feel safe. Please I live at ABC Streets just sideways from the main J.K Road.”\n\n“Yes ma’am. Do not panic. We will send our units immediately. Stay on the line.”\n\nJust then the banging had stopped. Had he left? I was so scared that I just wanted to lock the room and hide inside my blanket. But the logical side of me knew that even if I lock the room it’s just a matter of minutes before he will breach through my room door.\n\nSo I picked up my late grandmothers cane (which is always next to my bed), and slowly started down the stairs. The lights were dim, and my heart was starting to beat faster. Reaching the ground floor I looked around. Everything seemed normal- no signs of intrusion.\n\nTaking a deep breath I made my way to the back door. Slowly I walked trying to make sure that I made no noise. Entering the room to my back door, I gasped.\n\nThe back door was broken open! \n\n“Ma’am? Are you all right?” Came the voice from the 911 call.\n\n“He’s already inside. Please come fast.” I whispered in a rushed tone.\n\n“Ma’am the troops are on their way as we speak. I would recommend you to hide yourself someplace safe till then.” \n\nA loud clank came from the kitchen. The sound made by a steel utensil falling. Startled I turned towards the noise.\n\n“Yes I will” I replied to the call but instead made way to do the opposite. There wasn’t actually any place for me to hide. My mom never had the need to make a safe room. And my house isn’t that big either - only two storeys with 2 rooms on the top. \n\nThe only place where I could hope to hide till the cops came was the attic. But to reach the attic I had to go up to my mothers room upstairs. To do so would require me going the hallway. And if he sees me, there’s no use in hiding up there.\n\nFor the first time tonight, I felt my heart beating get in control. Somehow I was feeling confident and felt in control. Taking deep breath I grasped the cane as tightly as I could and walked towards the kitchen.\n\nWhat I saw shook me to the core. Not only was the utensil fallen on the floor, but on the wall in front of me was written in bright red paint - *“I see you”.* \n\nI trembled with fear. This was not just any robbery or such. He was out here for me. He was out to get me.\n\nMy breathing became shallow, my heart beat faster. Frantically looking around I saw a long knife. This situation had no use for my grandma’s cane, instead it called for drastic measure. I had to protect myself until the cops showed up.\n\n“Please hurry”, I whispered into my phone.\n\n“Yes ma’am. Just a few more minutes and we’ll be there. Hold out until then” said the responder.\n\nSlipping the phone into my pocket, I gripped the knife hard. Slowly I moved forward. I had a simple enough plan - get to the front door as quietly as possible and make a run for it outside. \n\nAs I walked towards the hallway leading upto my front door I hear a laugh. A menacing laugh from behind me.\n\n“Hahaha. Where do you think you are going?”\n\nI turned back sharply keeping my knife in front of me when I finally saw him. It was the same guy from yesterday. With his same stern features and long hair covering his face. But there was one difference. He had a gun.\n\nI screamed and started running the hallway and reached the front door. In front of the door I saw my shoe-rack blocking my way horizontally. I couldn’t open the door, I would first need to clear my way which would definitely take some time. And time was one thing I clearly didn’t have. He was there, just three to four steps behind me.\n\nI turned towards him again, my knife in front of me. I knew there was no way out of here. But there is always something, and I needed to buy some time to think. \n\n“Who are you” I asked him in a trembling voice, hoping to start a dialogue and gaining enough time to come up with an escape plan.\n\n“You know me. It’s time you come with me” said the man in a threatening voice.\n\n“I don’t know you. Leave me alone. The cops are on their way” I responded back with a slightly increased confidence.\n\nThat seemed to do the trick, as the man in front of me seemed concerned for a moment. Taking advantage of the pause I spoke further, “Just let me go and no one will have to know what happened today.”\n\nBut to that he just smiled, he seemed to have regained his composure. “The cops being on their way, it seems like I don’t have much time then”, and he advanced towards me in a rushed manner.\n\nI had a plan ready till then. I knew he wouldn’t just let me go. But there was still another way out of here, a way I should have taken at the start itself. Screaming I raised my knife and slashed it across his face. He got his arms just in time, but screamed as blood gushed from his arms.\n\nStartling him, I saw an opening and dashed past him. He in turn screamed even louder and I could hear him running behind me. \n\nWithout looking back, I ran as fast as I could, knowing that if I even halter for a tiny millisecond, I was done for. My mind was focused only on reaching the back door. That was the way he had forced himself inside my house. And that way was still open. That was my way out.\n\nBut as was with my bad luck this evening, I placed my foot on a glass utensil which was fallen on the ground in the kitchen. My stride broke and I fell to the ground. I could see the chances of me surviving fading away.\n\nI groaned as I looked up. The man was standing above me, breathing heavily. He had a dark look in his eyes, he obviously didn’t like my little attempt at escaping.\n\n“This is it” he said in a hoarse voice, “no more running.” He sheathed his gun which baffled me. But my hopes were short lived as he instead reached for his pouch, slung on his hips. From inside it he took out what looked like an injection.\n\n“What are you doing?” I finally spoke up in fearful manner. Whatever was gonna happen to me, I was getting the feeling that death was probably easier.\n\n“Shush now,” he responded in a calmer voice, which just made him seem more menacing, “you’ve troubled me a lot, and it’s time you go to sleep. It’s all for the best.”\n\nHe started filling the injection vial with some sort of drugs. Was this the end for me? I didn’t want to imagine what would happen to me once I become his captive. My mind began racing fast. I could see bits of glass shattered near to me, the same glass I had stepped foot upon. \n\nVery slowly, so as to not garner his attention, I moved my hand towards the glass. He was murmuring something that I couldn’t make out, but he definitely seemed agitated, like he wanted everything to be over as soon as possible.\n\nJust as soon as he finished injecting the vial and turned towards me, I garnered up all of my remaining strength and lunged forwards, stabbing his left leg with the glass piece. It was with so much force that not only did I manage to push the entire glass piece inside, but my palm also tore apart.\n\nHe fell down on his knees screaming, dropping the vial with him, which shattered into tiny pieces. I scrambled backwards and managed to get on my feet. The pain was too intense to ignore, but the adrenaline in me rushed like never before. For the first time today, I had an escape route. The backdoor was open and my attacker was on the ground. It was now or never.\n\nGritting my teeth I started moving forward, the pain intensifying. Taking support of the wall, steadily I reached the door, the fresh night air slapping my face. I turned around for one last look. The attacker was still laying down on the ground, blood all around him. He was groaning in pain, far greater than I could imagine. It looked like he had tried moving forward too, but the glass had most probably injured his leg for good. \n\nI stepped outside, finally escaping this night of madness. The cops weren’t here yet, but it would only be a matter of time. I needed to go someplace safe, but there was nothing nearby.\n\nI could see some dim lights on in my elderly neighbours house. Setting my mind on it, I made way towards it.\n\n“Don’t go” screamed the man from inside. “You forget. Get BACK HERE”\n\nWhat did he mean by I forget? It just seemed like a ruse to help himself. Not giving him a second thought I limped ahead.\n\nWithin a few minutes I reached the neighbours safely and knocked their door. Were they sleeping? They were certainly old, so I hoped hoped hoped that they wake up in time. I kept looking over my shoulder to see whether he had followed me.\n\n“Oh my goodness”, gasped my old neighbour as she finally opened the door. “What happened to you my dear?”\n\n“Help… me” I managed to blurt out before I fell unconscious into her frail hands and everything became black.\n\n \\--------\n\nI woke up coughing. My vision was a little blurry as I had to shake my head a couple of times to see things clearly. My body was bruised and covered in stale blood. I was laying down on a light blue mattress. \n\nAs I took in my surroundings I saw that I was in what seemed like a glass cage. My left leg was chained to the wall. How did I end up here? I had somehow escaped his clutches.\n\nSuddenly the light turned out, bright enough to blind me for a few seconds. As I managed to open my eyes I saw my old neighbour standing outside the glass cage.\n\n“Hello darling,” she started in a sly voice, no hint of her previous friendliness. “I hope you are comfortable.”\n\n“Why am I here?” I asked, noticing how sore my throat felt. \n\nThe neighbour just smiled at that. Then she raised her frail hand and pointed behind me. I turned.\n\nThere sat my attacker. His left leg bruised extremely badly, but bandaged. He had a long knife in his hand and he looked at me. And that was definitely not a friendly look.\n\n“I need Tamara.” He growled in a threatening voice.\n\nI knew then and there that things were not looking good for me. And that there was a long night ahead of [me](https://www.reddit.com/user/Night_Bolt).\n\n—————\n\nPart II coming out on 31-01-23",

        "text": "Hi, my name is David and a survivor of the incident. I wanted to share with you what happened in the small city known as Millfield. The city used be peaceful and normal like any other cities in the world until one day...\n\nThe darkness enveloped the small city of Millfield, casting an eerie shadow over the deserted streets. The solely sound that ought to be heard used to be the howling wind, as if the very air used to be mourning the loss of the once thriving community. It had been two weeks due to the fact that the first disappearance and the townsfolk have been opening to recognize that this used to be no normal event.  \n\n\nThe local authorities had been baffled by the surprising vanishings. No signs and symptoms of warfare or compelled entry could be determined at any of the affected houses. It was as if the missing people had virtually vanished into thin air. But the disturbing horror was once yet to come.  \n\n\nIt used to be on a cold, dark night that a group of scientists from the research facility subsequently uncovered the truth. They had been studying the atypical readings coming from deep under the earth's surface, and it was once their findings that would exchange the direction of human history forever.  \n\n\nThe researchers observed an ancient underground civilization, one that had been buried deep underneath the earth's crust for eons. They had been a race of monsters, twisted and deformed by way of the extreme stress and darkness of their subterranean home. They had lain dormant for centuries, waiting for the possibility to reclaim the surface world as their own.  \n\n\nThe scientists had unknowingly breached the barrier that saved the monsters trapped underground, and now they have been free to roam the world once  more. The creatures wasted no time in making their presence known, attacking and abducting the townsfolk in the darkness of the night.  \n\n\nThe last residents of Millfield had been now trapped in a desperate fighting for survival. They barricaded themselves in their homes, armed with something weapons they may want to find, but it used to be clear that it would only be a count number of time earlier than the monsters broke through.  \n\n\nAs the days passed, the survivors started out to be aware that the creatures had been changing. They had been adapting to the floor world, developing stronger and greater powerful with every passing day. It appeared that the monsters had a plan, and it used to be only a be counted of time earlier than they would launch their last assault on the closing humans.  \n\n\nThe survivors knew that they had to act quickly if they desired to have any chance of survival. They shaped a makeshift army unit and launched a desperate attack on the monsters' underground lair. It was once a brutal and bloody battle, but in the end, the people emerged victorious.  \n\n\nBut the cost of their victory used to be great. The underground town had been destroyed, and the monsters had been driven back into the depths of the earth. The remaining townsfolk had been left to pick out up the portions of their shattered lives, haunted by the reminiscence of the horrors they had faced.  \n\n\nThe incident at Millfield used to be hushed up through the authorities and the lookup facility, the secrets of the monsters were buried with the city and the survivors have been given new identities and relocated. But the monsters had been no longer long past forever, they had been still there, buried deep below the earth's crust, waiting for the day when they would upward shove once more and declare the surface world as their own. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEver since that day, i have lost many friends and family that I wish to not speak of their name of. But sometimes I wonder if there are many more monsters laying around underground from other cities just waiting to devour the walking innocents that's above them.",

        "text": "When I first moved here, my home, I wasn't alone like I am now. When I first moved here, I couldn't quite hear the whispers clear enough, they were faint, distant. But in the darkness the voices would grow loud like sirens wail or a bloody war outside your line of sight.\n\nAt first, I was horrified when I found her. In the basement she led a long gruesome sleep, and I stood atop the stairs that looked back into my kitchen. I approached her body, the voices consuming me. \n\nA monster was there that day for me too, in the corner where my light would not go, a gnawing cold spot in my house. Something terrible happened here, but I could not find it in myself to react as I should only adding to my diminishing mental state.\n\nIn my bed, I would sleep, and in the morning it would be as if nothing ever happened... though my house was becoming visibly twisted and dark. I lay on my side, with sweet nothings in thought, and the sounds of hell in my ears, I close my eyes.\n\nI dream of what can only be described as heaven, with family and friends that I could not recognize anymore. Holiness is what I seen, with god overruling the castle in the sky, clouds as his chariots and stars for Jewry; nothing would escape his vision, and his judgment, was final.\n\nAs I awoke, the shadows scattered like a band of hunters wishing to remain unseen. It had become cold here, my home was changing, and I could not find it in myself to feel?! Why would I have been okay with this new reality of nightmare? Where was my wife? What am I, to be so unbothered? I asked the voices, and they answered.\n\nA creature of raw terror appeared before be standing tall as if a man. Skin as dark as coal and eyes like a glowing blacksmiths forge. It stood tall and imposing over me with stained blood splattered across its inhuman hands and face composing of large teeth. It looked as if it were wearing my wife's bracelet, sapphire blue gems glimmered. As it spoke all light and sound was extinguished, the room in which I stood faded into black and it seemed all that was left in this world was myself and this creature of hell.\n\nTo me he said\n\n“You who have sinned have been judged by the god king and here you shall be with me. Until the beating heart of this hell dies at the end of time you will repent, suffering will be your currency and death can not save you here. Look out the window and see your future of pain and sorrow, primal and brutal you will live and all at the same time you will know of your failures and sins. Those who you love will know suffering too, you will be the instrument of Satan, like me, you will grow strong, and you will loose any part of yourself you love until nothing but sin remains and then, you will be truly dead to god.”\n\nAfter it finished speaking clarity washed over me, as if brought back to life I remembered my sin, and the reason I was bound for hell. I can remember her screams as if aware for the first time… the darkness I created. I made my home into a living hell, and now hell has come for me. \n\nI wonder what lies beyond this window.",

        "text": " After all these years, we know there were no WMDs in Iraq, but there was something much worse, and we invaded the country to find that thing.\n\nI can’t introduce myself, because if I do, I’ll be immediately imprisoned or killed by secret services. I’m a scientist, primarily working with subatomic particles and physics. I was employed at NASA, but I often had to work with the CIA or other secret organizations I can’t mention, because their existence is already a secret. So yeah, overall, I’ve worked on tons of shady experiments in my career, but this one was… different.\n\nI was surprised when I got a call from a CIA agent one morning in 2003. He told me I had to go to Iraq for some secret project he couldn’t talk about on the phone. I didn’t want to go there, I already had a family in the US, but I didn’t have a choice. The guy told me I HAD to go there. \n\n“Don’t worry,” he said. “It won’t last longer than a few months.”\n\nSo, I agreed, said goodbye to my family, then went to Washington, where I was greeted by a high-ranking officer.  Let’s call him general Ronald. That wasn’t his name, and he wasn’t a general, but I’m afraid they’ll find me if I give away too much information. But after a second thought, it doesn’t even matter. They’ll find me through my IP, I can’t escape it. I’ll be dead hours after I post this.\n\n“So, one of your people told me about a secret project,” I started the conversation as soon as we sat down in his office.\n\n“Exactly. I’ll be short, you need to get there as soon as possible. There’s an anomaly in Iraq, we finally managed to capture the lab it was contained in. We don’t understand what it is yet. They told us it’s a hole in reality.”\n\n“A hole in reality?” I asked, not understanding what he meant. I was confused. “Like a mine, or a tunnel?”\n\n“Not exactly. It’s more like a black hole, but at the same time, it’s completely different. I can’t really explain it, you have to see it yourself.”\n\n“Okay, so that’s it?”\n\n“You can’t talk about this to anyone who’s not part of the CIA, or not an elite member of the military. You can’t tell this to your family or friends. Nobody should know about this anomaly, except those you’ll meet there. Got it?”\n\n“Got it.”\n\n“Good. You can go now.”\n\nTwo soldiers escorted me to a military transport plane, which took off immediately. They gave me great food during the flight, it was a great experience while it lasted. When we landed in Iraq, I was escorted to a hotel. A young soldier told me to stay there for a night, I had 9 hours until another soldier would take me to my destination. I think the young man didn’t know about the anomaly, so I just nodded and wished him a good night.\n\nThe following day I woke up early to have breakfast. The soldier arrived exactly at 8 AM. I got in the car, and in about 10 minutes, I was already at the underground lab. The soldiers at the entrance checked my ID before letting me in.\n\nDown there I was greeted by an old guy called Dr. Anderson. I followed him into an elevator, which took me down to the lowest level. Before he opened the elevator door, he looked at me.\n\n“Please be careful,” he said. “We still don’t understand this anomaly, it may be unsafe. Some people experienced hallucinations when they got too close.”\n\n“I understand.”\n\nAnderson opened the doors, and I could just stand there for a minute before I could do anything, the sight shocked me. It was a large cave, maybe it was a mine before. The place was full of scientists in white clothes, and there were some soldiers and CIA agents.\n\nAnd in the middle of the tunnel, there was the anomaly. A large, vantablack sphere, around the size of an elephant. The general was right, it really looked like a black hole, but at the same time, it behaved completely differently. There was no extreme gravity, no light or time distortion, it was just a floating black sphere.\n\n“Isn’t it amazing?” Anderson asked. “You’ll get used to it.”\n\n“Wow…”\n\n“So, I was talking about these hallucinations,” he continued. “I’m curious if you can experience these, too. Walk closer to the anomaly.”\n\nAs I walked closer to the sphere, I felt strange. I started to hear some noises. Sounds I’ve never heard before. When I was about a foot from the anomaly, these sounds became even louder. I can’t even describe what I’ve heard. Those voices were unearthly. I felt like they were calling to me. I felt like I had to go inside the sphere.\n\nThen I realized the anomaly itself wasn’t black. It was transparent, and whatever was inside it… or on the other side of it, was black. The sphere was a hole on our three-dimensional world.  \n\n“So?” Anderson walked behind me. “Do you experience anything? Strange sounds or visions?”\n\n“I hear things. No visions.”\n\n“Seems like it’s different for everyone. For example, I don’t experience any of these things, but there were a few subjects who saw some strange non-humanoid lifeforms inside the anomaly.”\n\n“Do we know what’s inside?” I asked.\n\n“No, we found reports about an Iraqi who threw a cigarette inside, and it disappeared, but we still don’t know anything significant about it.”\n\n“I want to go inside the anomaly,” I said confidently. I still don’t know why I did that. It was a stupid thing. I think the sphere forced me to do it.\n\n“I don’t recommend it. First, we have to send in some drones to make sure it’s safe.”\n\nAs Anderson talking, I just walked one step closer to the sphere. Then another step. Then another. \n\n“Hey, what are you doing?” Anderson reached out to grab me, but it was too late. I jumped inside the hole.\n\nI immediately regretted it. I could hear those terrifying sounds from the otherworld. I opened my eyes as I was floating in darkness. I still don’t know what was that place, but it wasn’t three-dimensional. There were at least four or five dimensions. I had to close my eyes, my brain just couldn’t comprehend what I was seeing. \n\nI heard some noises, like someone was moving. I had to open my eyes again, and I saw this thing. I think it was something- some living creature. I can’t describe it, but it was colossal. It looked at me with its gigantic eyes. Oh god, those eyes were bigger than a skyscraper.\n\nThen somehow, something dragged my shoulder, and in a matter of seconds, I was back in the tunnel where the anomaly was. I looked around confused, my perspective still changing between 3D and whatever it was on the other side. I didn’t see Anderson there. I didn’t see any US soldiers. But I saw Iraqis.\n\n“The scientist who went missing in 2003,” said one of them with a strong accent. “So it’s true. And you are alive still.”\n\n“Where are the US forces?” I asked.\n\n“The Americans are not here anymore. Since 2011.”\n\n“2011? I- It was 2003 just a minute before.”\n\n“It’s 2013,” the Iraqi said. “That confirms the theory that there’s no time and space on the other side. Anyway, you’re free to leave this place and go back to America. But only after you give us a detailed report about what you saw.”\n\n“I want to stay,” I said. “I want to work on this anomaly. I want to know what it is.”\n\nAnd now I’m working there. I’m not that useful for them, since I’m still unable to see in 3D, and we still haven’t sent another human inside the anomaly. I still want to return to my family, but there’s no point anymore. I’m sure they already forgot about me. I’m writing this post because I want the world to know about this. Maybe we’re not living in a reality anymore. And if we are, then there’s a hole in it. Now I press this button and wait for them to kill me for [revealing this secret.](https://www.reddit.com/r/polgari/)",

        "text": "I don't really remember much, nor have I told anyone about this but I need some closure. For context, my wife was in labour ●●and there was black ice all over the road. You can probably guess where it went from there. There was a moose in the middle of the highway and I swerved into a lake. I still remember the screams of my wife, trying to swim up but to no avail.\n\n I can't recall much after that but I woke up in a 2000's era modern-ish hotel. Rubbing the groggines from my eyes was when I felt it, my clothes where all wet and I was having a hard time to breath, but eventually chalked it up to the AC being too cold.\n\nNext thing I knew was the feeling of water droplets hitting my forehead, I looked up but saw nothing. \"Maybe I'm just too tired\" I thought. I went to the bathroom to rinse my face. After that I felt the strong urge to look above me, there I saw what could only be described as a monster, an entity. To help u picture this better imagine the girl from the ring, yes the one that crawled up the well. That's exactly what it looked like.\n\nIt shot a look of... I'm not sure, maybe guilt, envy, despair, rage, sympathy? It was hard to tell but I bolted it. I ran into rooms with people scratching the walls till their nails tore of the flesh, people brushing their teeth until their gums turned white, you get the idea.\n\nOn the last room, I saw a figure that looked like it had ascended from the bottom of the abyss, from hell. It had skulls filling the void where their eyes should be and a long black beak. It had a long black robe and silky glass hair. It grabbed my ankle before I was able to get out of that hell hole. \n\nRight as it was opening its never ending mouth to devour me, the woman from earlier tackled it down and screeched at me to leave in an inhuman voice.\n\nI ran out and saw dozens more of those twisted beings all racing towards me, but I saw a gate of light that was... getting farther put reach. Still I felt as if i had missed something. I just couldn't shake the feeling away but I ran with all my remaining strength and I'm not so glad but grateful to say I made it. \n\nRight when I was blacking out, I saw the woman from earlier, this time with long neat black hair. And a warm melancholy smile looking at me, after that I awoke in a hospital. I read the name of it on a cup next to me, \"Sacred Heart Hospital\" sounded familiar. Then it all hit me, my beautiful wife, the crash.\n\nJust then nurses came rushing into my room with their jaw dropped. \"H-hes alive? That's a miracle!\" One cheered. All I wanted to know at the moment was \"Where's my..w-wife?\" I didn't realize I voiced out my thought. A worried nurse came into my room with her head down \"I'm so sorry sir, your wife and the baby didn't make it, but you should be grateful your still here. You were dead just 2 minutes ago you know.\"\n\nAt that moment, all the dots connected in my head. I knew that woman...the thing I had left behind was my wife.",

        "text": "The world had become a strange and difficult place to live. Everywhere I went, I was watched. Not by people, but by my reflection. Every surface I walked by was a window into my soul, and every reflection I saw was a reminder of who I was and what I had done.  It started as a minor annoyance; I’d pass a mirror or a window and my reflection would give me a knowing look. It was almost like the reflection was aware of the secrets I kept and the mistakes I’d made. \n\nI tried to ignore it, but the more I did, the more it seemed to follow me.\n\nSoon, the reflections began to show signs of life. They’d move their eyes, blink, and sometimes even move their lips as if they were trying to communicate something to me. It was unnerving, to say the least. I tried to talk to them, but they wouldn’t respond. I tried to ignore them, but they kept appearing in every mirror and window I passed. \n\nOne night, I awoke to find my reflection standing in my bedroom, watching me. He was the spitting image of me. I was so startled I just stood there, unblinking and unmoving. After what felt like hours I eventually tried to run, but it followed.\n\nAs I run down my neighborhood street, looking back over my shoulder at the figure was no use. Every time I see a streetlight pole, pass by a car, or a puddle forming by the storm drains, he catches up to me. \n\nI eventually ended up in an alley, my reflection still in pursuit. I was exhausted and terrified, so I decided to confront it almost as a last resort, a glimmer of hope to end this nightmare. I asked it what it wanted from me and it just stared at me with a cold, emotionless gaze. I asked it why it was following me and it replied in a voice that sounded eerily like my own, “You know why I have come for you.”\n\nThe reflection suddenly changed. Its eyes became black and its mouth twisted into a sinister smile. At that moment, I knew this was real. I tried to run, but it was too fast. It grabbed me and held me in a vice-like grip, applying an even and breathtaking pressure to each side of my throat. I struggled and screamed, but it was no use. It dragged me back to my home and to my bedroom where it pinned me to the bed. I was sure I was going to die.\n\nIt spoke to me in a deep, raspy voice, “You have been running from me for too long. Now it’s time for you to pay the price of your deeds.” I was too scared to speak, so I just lay there, paralyzed with fear. The reflection reached out and touched my face. Its cold, clammy hands sent shivers down my spine. I closed my eyes and prepared for the worst.\n\n\"It was only an accident.\" I pleaded with the demon I have created by running from my mistakes.\n\nThe reflection now standing in front of me lets out a cackle that rings in my ears. \"You ran. You ran away. You are a coward and you will always be a coward. When it is time, you will die a coward's death.\"\n\nMy spitting image snarls its lip and before I can say another word, it was gone.\n\nIt was gone, but it is never truly gone. It is with me every day. Every day of my life since the whole thing turned upside down. It never does get easier after another life is taken by your hands. As much as I wish I could, I can't avoid getting behind the wheel every day, but when I do; in the rearview mirror, my reflection watches in anger, shame, and guilt.",

        "text": " \n\nThe day I met Jenny was the best day of my life. She was hitchhiking outside of Bakersfield and it was raining. I’d finally given up on my dreams down in Los Angeles, and I was on my way back to my hometown. The other reason was that I was going home to take care of my mother who had fallen ill. I figured it was a better thing to do with my time and my soul than trying to be someone or something that I would never be in that awful city. \n\nEveryone I had known for the fifteen years before weren’t very real people. They were facades of something they used to be before that city ruined them.\n\nMaybe that’s why I connected with her so quickly. I hadn’t had a real conversation with anyone for a long time unless you count the times I went back home for the holidays. Jenny was real. Everything about her was perfect. I think about her everyday.\n\nShe was just outside the north end of town. I pulled over on 99 and told her to get in. I was being a good samaritan, but when she climbed in my truck, I was stunned at how beautiful she was. It was her eyes. She was everything in a woman that I hadn’t seen in a while. Not a trace of makeup, full figured, brown hair with a streak of silver down the left side, and her eyes were green. \n\n“Where are you wanting to go?”\n\n“Where are you going?”\n\n“Fresno.”\n\n“That’s exactly where I want to go.” I laughed. I’d never heard anyone say that. We drove on,  just talking. She was a little apprehensive with me at first. She told me later that she figured her options were dying on the side of the road or taking a ride from a chubby bespectacled guy who may or may not be a serial killer. I found myself  constantly asking her questions because I just wanted her to keep talking. I fell in love with that voice five minutes after she got in my truck. I fell in love with all of her by the time we reached Fresno about two and a half hours later. \n\nShe didn’t have a place to stay, so I jumped on the chance to stay in her orbit.\n\n“You know, my old room is built over the garage at my mom’s house. You’re more than welcome to stay.” She hesitated and I stammered a bit. “Because…you know…it’s a little late and…hotels are expensive and the only cheap ones are right off of the highway, and you don’t want to stay in those…and my mom makes great coffee cake…” I couldn’t think of anything else to say and I just stared at her like a moron. An utter moron.\n\nI was convinced I blew it. She told me later that she knew I was the one for her at that moment. She agreed to stay.\n\nMy mother and she got on very well. She was the perfect fit. She ended up staying in my old room for a few more nights, before I finally just told her she could stay for as long as she wanted.\n\nIt was two months before I asked her to marry me. It was fast, but we both knew. She had also told me that she was pregnant the night after I picked her up. I didn’t care. I just wanted to be with her. I wanted to be the man she deserved, and even then I wanted to be the father her child deserved. For almost eight months, I was truly happy. We were both happy. I told her that every dream I had followed my whole life eventually led me to her. I’ve never been great with words, but I honestly still believe that.\n\nI started my father’s house painting business back up. He had died three years before I came back home, and four months after I had come home, my mother followed him. Jenny and I had gone to the courthouse and got married shortly before she passed. My mother died at home. She died holding Jenny’s hand while I stood over her. She was happy.\n\nJenny was six months pregnant when the pains began; when everything started to change. She started talking to me about her past; a sad past that she would be embarrassed about me sharing, so I won’t. She deserved better than her childhood is all I will say. \n\nThe father of her baby was a man she knew very little about. Although she was with him for only a few months, she couldn’t honestly say what it was about him that she found pleasing in any way. She honestly didn’t remember much about him. She said it was like she fell under the worst kind of spell the second he spoke to her. She wanted to leave every day, but something kept her there. She began to believe that he belonged to some kind of cult and when she confronted him about it, he threatened to hurt her.\n\nHe scared her so bad, she left that night and spent a month running before she realized that she was pregnant. That was shortly before I had picked her up. She told me that I was everything she had never met in another human being. That for the first time in her life, she had actually felt safe that night in my truck.\n\nHer sixth month of pregnancy was rough, but it was nothing compared to the seventh month. The doctors could find nothing wrong with her or the baby, but she knew better. I would wake up to her silently weeping in bed from the pain. I could do nothing to help her. She just always wanted me to hold her hand. \n\nWe had a neighbor who was retired and she would sit with Jenny while I was working during the day, but during the eighth month, it got to the point where I wouldn’t leave her side. I begged her doctor, I even screamed at him to do something, but he kept insisting that there was nothing physically wrong with her or the baby. I asked him if we could take the baby early. She was talking in her sleep and she was saying things that my Jenny would never say. I couldn’t get her to eat anymore and she hadn’t slept in a week. Finally the doctor relented and scheduled her for a  C-section the next day.\n\nThat night I put her to bed. She told me that the pains were gone. She smiled at me and asked me to lay down with her. She put her head on my chest and I stroked her hair until I heard her breathing. She purred in her sleep. I drifted off with her smell and her sounds in my head and the feel of her next to me.\n\nI woke up some time later to a slight jerk from Jenny, and then another. She wasn’t purring. I stroked her hair and then I heard the baby screaming. I couldn’t see Jenny’s face, but I looked down and saw the baby moving under a bloody sheet. I rolled Jenny off of my chest and then I saw her eyes staring up. Her blue face was staring at nothing. She was gone.\n\nThe days that followed are still a blur to me to this day. The baby was a healthy girl. I named her Jen. I never contacted any of Jenny’s family because she never wanted anything more from them in this life, and I was sure she would want them to have nothing to do with her daughter. Our daughter.\n\nI made sure that Jen was the center of my life. I built everything around her. I talked about her mother all the time, but I was damned if I was going to let her see me break down in front of her. She was going to have the life her mother deserved, and I was going to do everything to make sure that happened. \n\nOur lives were great; they could never be perfect without Jenny, but they were great. She was a happy child. Really smart and very kind. She always seemed to know more about things than she led on. She was like her mom in that way. There were a handful of times though that I had the feeling that she had a little bit of a meanstreak. But what kid doesn’t?\n\nJen was four when an old man came up to me in a parking lot outside of Home Depot. He was shaking. I asked him if he needed help. He stood there for a second before he finally spoke. It was quiet and cracked.\n\n“I’ve tried to tell you for a while now. I thought I should come to you in person. I was the man who examined your wife after…after she passed. You deserve to know. The way she went. It wasn’t good.” I was shaking. I suddenly didn’t want to hear what the man had to say. “The baby…she…ripped herself out of her mother. I can’t believe that you…that she didn’t cry out…”\n\n“I have to go.” I drove off with him standing still. He was crying. What do you say when something like that happens?\n\nIt turns out, I just went home and watched Kim Possible with my little girl. I was staring at her while she was just laughing at the tv. I stared at her all night. She noticed, but she didn’t say anything until I put her to bed.\n\n“Daddy?”\n\n“Yeah baby?”\n\n“Are you mad at me?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Can you read me the mouse cookie book?” I read her four stories that night. She was my baby. I was mad at myself that I was out of sorts with her, but I couldn’t stop seeing my wife’s face every time I closed my eyes. I dreamed about it all that night.\n\nIt was after her fifth birthday that she began drawing pictures that disturbed her teachers enough to have a conference with me. All of them showed her holding hands with a monster. It was a large beast with wings and yellow eyes. There were other people in the pictures, but they were all laying down and they had x’s drawn over their eyes. Some of them would be lying in pools of red crayon.\n\nThere were no behavioral problems at school, but she kept on with her doodles. Everyone thought it was best that she talk to a therapist. She told her therapist that the monster watched over her, and that he was going to take her home someday. She told the therapist that he waited outside of her window at night.\n\nWhen we got home that day, I put her in front of the television and looked through her room. There was nothing out of the ordinary. Then I opened the window. There, down in the dirt, I saw a pair of large boot prints. My blood ran cold. I went to the kitchen and grabbed one of her drawings from the file her teacher had given me. I stood in front of the tv.\n\n“Jen? Baby? You said this thing stands outside your window?”\n\n“I don’t want to talk about it.”\n\n“Honey, I’m your father. Answer me.”\n\n“He wants me to open the window.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Because he wants me to come live with him. He says it’s time.” It was enough for me. I had called the police and they kept an eye on our house from the front and the back. I borrowed my neighbor's car, so it looked like we were still home, and I took Jen away that night. I had hoped that whoever this was would show up and the cops would grab him. That didn’t mean I had to keep my little girl there as bait.\n\nI rented a small house about an hour away at Bass Lake that night. I made sure I brought enough videos to keep her entertained, and I even made her two milkshakes to keep her happy. I tried to make it an unexpected adventure. She liked it when I said that. \n\n“Daddy, can you read me the mouse cookie book?”\n\n“I didn’t bring it, baby.”\n\n“It’s ok. I did.” She pulled the book out of her backpack. I read it to her twice. She wanted me to get into bed with her and she put her head on my chest. After I finished reading, I stroked her hair until I heard her breathing. She purrs just like her mother.\n\nAt some point that night I woke up from a nightmare. Jen wasn’t purring anymore. I rolled her off of my chest and she was sound asleep. I tucked her in and walked out into the kitchen for a glass of water. I gulped down the whole thing and turned to go back to bed.\n\n“You tried to take her from me.” There was a man standing in the shadows next to the front door. He was tall and his eyes were yellow. I dropped the glass and grabbed two knives out of the butcher block. As my eyes adjusted, I could see his face. Long and angular; a hard face. His hair was slicked back. He was wearing boots and a long coat that dropped past his knees.\n\n“Get out.”\n\n“I’ve let you have her long enough. Now it’s time for her to go with me.” My phone was back in the bedroom with Jen. I started to move myself in between him and the bedroom door.\n\n“You stay away from us.” I tried to sound intimidating, but I knew this man wasn’t afraid of me. Somehow, I think he knew that I was afraid of him. His hands were down past his waist. He held nothing, but his fingers looked longer than the knives I was holding.\n\n“Give me my daughter.” \n\n“She’s my daughter!” I ran at the man. He reached out and grabbed me by the throat even though I had sunk one of the knives in his stomach. He threw me forward, through the front door and out into the mud of the driveway. I tried to scramble to my feet, but he was fast. He once again had me by the throat with those long fingers.\n\nThe man was smiling at me and those yellow eyes stared back at me. He heaved me up by the throat and I could feel my legs dangling underneath me. My vision was starting to go fuzzy. That’s when I heard my baby.\n\n“Stop! Put him down!” Myself and the tall man looked toward the porch. My daughter was standing there in her pajamas cradling her mouse cookie book. She was crying. “Leave him alone and I’ll go with you.”\n\nThe tall man looked back at me. I’ve never felt so much hate and been so helpless. Jen started to walk towards us. \n\n“If you hurt him, I will never go with you.”\n\n“Honey…run…don’t…” The tall man squeezed harder and I felt my arms go limp. I was going to pass out. The tall man looked back down at Jen and then back to me. He dropped me back down into the mud and I gasped for air. I couldn’t move, but I watched him scoop my baby into his arms and walk away into the dark.\n\n“I love you Daddy.” \n\nI’ve recounted that story seven different times to seven different detectives. I always end the story right there. I passed out. A useless excuse for a man who couldn’t protect his child. I never tell them what happened after that. I suppose I could. They would just chalk it up to a hallucination just as I lost consciousness.\n\nMy daughter was in the thing’s arms. She was holding just as tightly to her favorite book as it was holding onto her. I swear I saw two wings come out of the back of its coat, and I watched it fly away into the night with the only thing I had left in this world. \n\nThat was ten years ago. I don’t want to think about what that thing has taught her or how it has raised her. I can only hope that there’s something of her mother and I in her that’s greater than her other half.",

        "text": "Sorry for the late update, but I am alright. I finally made it back to our reality after a *long* night stuck in our [building's natural habitat](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10h0wyd/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_were_stuck_on_the/). It was not an easy thing to do, but I learned a lot about our building, my coworkers, and surprisingly enough, Corporate. I’m not sure I’m happy with everything I’ve learned, but hey, we’re here now. Let me explain. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I said, these trips to the other side aren’t super unusual, and I hadn’t experienced a mishap until yesterday. Everything was normal, we cleaned the entire place top to bottom and made sure there were no leaks in the building (Patrick or Daniel always check the windows, I’m still not ready to look out into that world again). When it came time for us to do our five minutes of silence, I went first. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI sat down in the salt circle and did my usual routine of trying to count down the five minutes to distract myself from how horrifying the shop looks in the dark. I got to the two minute mark when I heard them - two people having a conversation. I snapped my head up and looked around, trying to find the source. Obviously there was no one around. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Daniel!” I yelled, feeling the panic rising in my chest. “Someone’s talking!”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDaniel ran out with Patrick close behind. Sam followed behind them slowly, looking annoyed. I stood up to run to them, hoping to escape the voices in some way. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“DON’T!” Daniel and Patrick yelled at the same time, and I froze.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“You need to stay in the circle, it isn’t safe for you out here,” Daniel explained as I slowly sat back down, feeling tears starting to blur my vision. “Stay calm. You’re going to be fine, but I need you to talk to me. What are the voices saying?” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI took a deep breath to steady myself and closed my eyes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I hear two people, it sounds like a man and a woman. I think they’re having a conversation. It sounds like… they’re talking about us.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly, I felt the room spinning. I opened my eyes only to see darkness. I could faintly hear my coworkers yelling for me, but I was completely covered in darkness. I turned to look around me, and saw the people I was hearing moments before, now standing right in front of me. Their voices sounded as if they were underwater, or in a room next to me, just barely above a whisper. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*How can you sit here and watch them continue to do this?* The woman said to the man next to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*You know we can’t do anything, darling. It hurts me as much as it hurts you. They will have to realize on their own.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Hello?” I said hesitantly, almost afraid for them to hear. Their eyes instantly snapped to me. They weren’t looking at me, but through me, like they couldn’t see me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Can you hear us, girl?* The man whispered, fear edging his voice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“What’s happening? Who are you? Where am I?” For once, I felt unafraid to ask questions. I wasn’t sure why, but I trusted this couple. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*What have you done, Meredith?!* The man yelled, panic filling his voice. *You’ve doomed us all! How could you be so stupid?*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*You need to listen closely, girl,* Meredith said, clearly ignoring the man’s quiet rage. *This place is not safe. I’m sorry I’ve done this to you, but I couldn’t continue to watch you come and go in silence. Those who employ you are lying to you. That company is nothing more than a mask covering the truth. You need to dig deeper.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Meredith, stop this at once!* The man said, getting increasingly agitated. He continued to look around them, as if something was coming.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Thomas, we have to do something. This can’t go on any longer. She can fix this! I know you feel it. Eleanora likes her, she wants her to save us from this!* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinding my voice, I asked “Eleanora?” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The building, darling. She is held prisoner by those above you, and she needs-*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Meredith, they are coming.* Thomas said solemnly, staring into the void beyond me. I turned to see, but there was only darkness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*I’m afraid we’re out of time.* She said softly. *Listen to me. You need to find the truth. Be careful who you trust, and remember us. Please, remember us.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe began tearing up, and Thomas held her tightly. I felt tears falling down my cheeks, and as they began screaming, I felt myself spinning once again. I closed my eyes tightly, mourning these people I never knew, and opened them to see Patrick leaning over me, concern covering his face\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Harper, what just happened?” Patrick said, visibly shaking. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I don’t know. Where are we? Are we home?” I asked, trying to get my bearings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“No. You’ve been out for over four hours. I thought you were fucking dead.” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“...sorry?” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wasn’t really sure what to say, and he gave me a pat on the back, basically acknowledging I was fine. I saw Daniel on the other side of the floor, on the phone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Daniel?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe looked at me with an expression I’ve never seen him have before. I’m not really sure how to describe it. Numb? Defeat? Either way, he clearly wasn’t himself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Corporate is coming for an inspection,” he said matter-of-factly. “They’ll be here soon. They’ll get us home.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI felt fear creep up my spine. I’d never met anyone higher up in the food chain than Daniel before. I turned to Patrick, and he seemed to have the same reaction as me. He has been here about two years longer than me, so I always assumed he had seen a lot more than me. I guess he had never had the pleasure of meeting Corporate before either. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI looked around for Sam, but he was nowhere to be found. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Where is Sam?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Who fucking knows,” Patrick mumbled. “He probably doesn’t want to be around when Corporate shows up anyway.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI thought about asking him what he meant by that, but I had too much on my mind to care. I turned back to Daniel, who hung up the phone and sat down on the couch, staring at nothing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Can I leave this circle?” I asked him softly, but my voice still sharply pierced the silence that had fallen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Yes, Corporate will be here soon. They’ll get us home.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPatrick and I gave each other a look before he helped me to my feet. My entire body was sore from sitting in the same spot for four hours, but I was grateful to be moving again. I paced around the floor, trying to process what had just happened. I had more questions than I knew what to do with. These people seemed to know us, and have been watching us every time we came to this reality. And this building? She is apparently sentient and has a name. Eleanora. As her name crossed my mind, I felt a shiver. It’s like she knows I know her now. I’m not sure she’s happy about it. All I knew is that those people sacrificed their existence to tell me she needs help, and that I should be careful who I trust. Whatever that means. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter about fifteen minutes, there was a knock at the staircase door. I looked at Patrick, who was just as confused as me. There was no way anyone could possibly be here. We were in a different reality for fucks sake. Who is knocking on our door?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDaniel got up from the couch and absently walked to the door, his best customer service smile covering his face unnaturally. I turned away, not wanting to see the sea of souls. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Hey Daniel!” I heard a cheery female voice say.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Corey! It’s so great to see you ma’am! Sorry for calling you so late,” Daniel replied, sounding completely normal. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Oh hush, it’s no problem!” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI turned when the door closed to see a woman standing in our doorway. She was maybe 5’5”, long brown hair, and gave off a very warm, inviting energy. She was rather cute, in a girl-next-door kind of way. She walked right up to Patrick and me and held out her hand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Hello Harper, Patrick. I’m Corporate, but you can call me Corey. It’s a pleasure to finally meet you!” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPatrick took her hand hesitantly, but after meeting her touch, he seemed to fully relax, and even smiled at her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Corey, it’s a pleasure.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe turned to me, but before she could hold out her hand, I held up mine for a fist bump.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Nice to meet you,” I said, as she bumped my fist, looking confused. “You can never be too careful these days!”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI could have sworn I caught her face change for a moment. Her expression changed from her soft, smiling young features to a jagged, scowling old woman with pure hatred in her eyes. I felt my throat tighten, but when I blinked, the mirage was gone, and she was back to her usual peppy self.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I totally get that! I hope you guys are staying safe here. Now, I hear we had a slight problem with our transition back, is that right?” She turned to Daniel, who was still standing with his best smile. I could tell by his eyes that he was absolutely terrified, but didn’t want Corey to know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Yes, Harper here informed me that she heard voices during her moment of silence. I ran to her assistance, but she fell unconscious shortly after. She was out for about four hours, but regained consciousness shortly before you arrived.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Four hours, huh?” she said to me, seemingly trying to hide the suspicion in her voice. “That’s an awful long time, are you feeling alright?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Yeah, yeah, I’m totally fine. It didn’t even feel that long. It was like I was sleeping.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“And did you have any *dreams* while you were sleeping?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI felt a familiar knot tightening in my throat, and I remembered Meredith’s warning. I knew I couldn’t trust this woman.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“No, not at all,” I said, trying to sound convincing. “I just blacked out, and then woke up. No dreams or anything like that.” I was feeling a bit bold (or maybe sleep deprived is a better word), and decided to push it. “Why do you ask?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe seemed taken aback by this, but quickly recovered her positive façade. “I always have to ask, it’s just protocol. So you’re sure there were no dreams? No further voices while you were out?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Nothing I can remember.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Well that’s good news! We can continue with our transition. Who is next for their moment of silence?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDaniel and Patrick both took their turns, while Corey and I sat in the office. I felt her staring at me the entire time the guys were taking their turns, but I tried to seem busy on the laptop, going over numbers mindlessly. I couldn’t stand to hold her stare for longer than a few moments. Everytime I met her eyes, I felt… outside of myself. Like my mind was screaming to look away, but I had no control. The only thing that kept me able to pull away was Meredith’s voice ringing in my head. *Please remember us.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, it was Sam’s turn. He sauntered out of the breakroom, not stopping as Corey tried to initiate a greeting with him. I couldn’t help but notice she had no questions about where he was, or how he seemed to appear in the break room out of nowhere. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Oh Sam… He must still be upset about his time at the warehouse.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSam stopped dead in his tracks, clenching his fists at his side. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Don’t talk to me about the warehouse you fucking monster.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCorey laughed loudly, unphased by his blatant disrespect. I had never seen Sam show any anger before, but even more surprising, I’d never heard him use the word *monster.* Patrick, Daniel and I often refer to our more rowdy custom clients as monsters, especially after a rough fitting, but Sam had never said anything like that. I assumed it was a coping mechanism (I mean, if I think of them as monsters for too long, it sends me into a full blown panic attack), but I might be wrong about that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe completed his moment of silence, and once the salt circle was cleaned up, Sam opened the door and revealed our staircase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Thank fucking God,* I thought, as I rushed to grab my bag and get out of there. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Bye Sam, see you later!” I heard Corey call just before the door slammed, hard. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI followed Patrick out of the back, and saw Daniel chatting with Corporate on the couch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Oh, Harper, may I have a word with you? Daniel, you can go home, I’ll lock up for you.” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDaniel looked between me and her, before slowly standing up and heading out the door with Patrick. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I just wanted to go over your *experience* one more time, while the memory is still fresh.” She patted the couch next to her, and I reluctantly sat down, trying to avoid eye contact. My entire being was screaming at me to run and never look back, but part of me knew I had to use this as a chance to get more information.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Of course. Like I said, I sat in the circle for my five minutes, and maybe two minutes in, I heard a couple voices talking, then the room-”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Hold on, just one moment. When you say a couple voices, what do you mean? You heard more than one voice?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Fuck.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Yeah, or I think so. It was hard to tell, it was so quiet. It might have been just one, or a lot all sort of talking over each other,” I scrambled, trying to cover my tracks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“What did they say?” Her voice was beginning to grow threatening, and I tried to swallow my fear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I couldn’t make out any words. It was all gibberish, just noise.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Alright. And when you blacked out, you didn’t see anything or *anyone*?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Who would I have seen?” I asked before I could stop myself, the sudden bravery in my voice surprising both of us. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I don’t know, that’s why I’m asking.” She was clearly losing her cool, and I could see the ancient scowl overtaking her face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“No, I didn’t see anything. Just darkness, then I woke up to Patrick staring at me. That’s it.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe examined me carefully for a moment before her composure returned.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Well, good! I think we’re done here. You can head home, I’m sure you’re exhausted. I’ll be back tomorrow to make sure everything is good with the shop. See you then!”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wasted no time getting the fuck out of there, and now I’m not sure what I should do. I mean, I can’t quit. There was a reason Meredith sacrificed her life to warn me, and I think there are people who need my help (and apparently, a building). I don’t know why they would ask me, I think I’m the least qualified to do anything that requires stealth, secrecy, or courage, but I guess this is now my responsibility. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wish it came with a raise, but that’s life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10f01tb/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_not_all_of_my_clients/)\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10g4sge/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_most_of_the_time_the/)\n\n[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10h0wyd/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_were_stuck_on_the/)",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10id01u/how_to_survive_timber_creek_high_school_a_guide/",
        "text": "For those of you who have joined Timber Creek, welcome! I’m Cassidy, a freshly graduated senior, and also the person who’s going to save your dumbass from dying before your first assignment is due. You see, I have no reason to help you, but… When I first got into Timber Creek, the mystery of it all almost made me lose my mind. I sympathize with you younglings, therefore, out of the kindness of my heart, I am giving you a little help. Don’t take it for granted though, I better get a “Cassidy is a heaven sent angel” as your picture day quote or something, but anyway, let’s begin shall we? \n\nIf you got into Timber Creek, it’s because of one of two things. Either you’ve been a failure in life, and this is your parent’s last resort to getting you on track, or you're a psychopath who loves the thrill of possibly getting murder by a shapeshifting janitor. Whatever it is, you’re here now, and there’s a lot you need to know before you start getting comfortable. I won’t promise a smooth, adrenaline free couple of years, however what I can guarantee is by the end of it, you will get grades that would be otherwise unattainable. That’s the trade-off, survive Timber Creek, and you’re assured a 4.0 GPA, you have my word for it.\n\nNow, Timber Creek has a list of things that could possibly cause you a slow, painful death. I will do my best to inform you on a few of them. Starting off with the many entities that roam the campus. \n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***Gabriel (The Shape Shifting Janitor)***\n\nSince I already brought old Gabe up, why not begin with him. Gabriel is the Janitor of Timber Creek. A damn good one too if I might add. The amount of bloody messes this man has had to clean up is impressive considering how spotless the campus usually is. Gabe is one of the more forgiving entities. He likes to be left alone, and you’ll find a hard time getting in his way. Mostly encountered in the bathrooms, you can also find him mopping the cafeteria, gym auditorium, and the school halls, however if you do end up seeing him in the last one, I’m afraid it might be too late for you. He only cleans the halls after hours, and if there’s one thing you should take from this entire document, it’s **NEVER** be in Timber Creek after hours. Gabriel takes his job very seriously, and it is of the upmost importance you respect that. Avoid wet floor signs at all costs, if you see one, walk the other way. In the unfortunate event that you do place a muddy foot on a freshly cleaned tile, get on the floor, close your eyes, and cover your head. You’ll hear footsteps surrounding you, maybe even feel a few heavy stomps on your legs and back. **DO NOT** react. That’s just Gabe trying to get you to look at him, which is what we’re trying to avoid here. He might also attempt to shift into teachers, and order you to get off the ground. Or even other students, and viciously make fun of you for being a scardy cat. Ignore all of it. It is crucial you remain calm and composed. You’ll know it’s safe to get up when you hear him grab the wet floor sign, put it in his squeaky mop trolley, then walk the opposite direction to where you are. Hopefully it won’t be long enough for you to miss your next class, just be grateful you didn’t get mauled to death.\n\n***Andela (The Bathroom Ghost)***\n\nAndela is the ghost of a child that is known for haunting the school bathrooms. She’s also one of the less problematic Timber Creek Entities. You’ll encounter her frequently, so get used to it. When you walk into the bathrooms, you have a chance of seeing a small, pale girl standing at the end of the room, facing the wall. She’ll have long blonde hair that reaches the floor and a plain white gown. Don’t panic, just go attend to business as usual. You can’t leave if you see her, she’ll follow you out, and I can guarantee you won’t make it back to class. For all the guys out there, I’ve heard Angela may also stand behind while you’re using the urinals, which I’m guessing can be a little awkward, so it’s best you avoid them altogether. If you’re in a stall, and you hear knocking, look underneath the door, if you see her gown, stay in there until she walks away. Angela may also try to speak to you sometimes. For your own sake, don’t acknowledge her. She’s known to tell stories, ranging from her abusive father to simple things like what her favorite kids show is. Just do what you’re in there to do and you’ll be fine. Oh, and one last thing, the only time it’s acceptable to run away from her, is if you walk into the bathrooms, and she’s facing you instead of the wall. Get ready for a chase because she’s a lot faster than she looks.\n\n***Leers (The Demon Classmates)***\n\nEvery class has at least one leer. What’s a leer, you might ask? Good question. Leers are demons who play the role of a classmate to try enticing you into forming relationships with them. They will be the greatest friends you’ve ever had, but little do you know, these creatures are just very efficient predators. They make you comfortable, have you trust them more than anyone else, then when the times right, they’ll rob of all your senses. Leaving you incapable of smelling, seeing, feelings, tasting, and hearing. It’s quite cruel, and almost always unexpected. However, don’t be too shaken. You can still make normal human friends without fearing for your safety. So long as they’re able to drink a glass of lemonade without gagging (Which are provided at the cafeteria for $1.50). I know, it’s an odd weakness to have, and you might be thinking, “I’ll just test everyone before befriending them.” But, oh no, it’s never that simple, is it? Remember when I said *“almost always unexpected.”* You see, leers are master manipulators. I know people who’ve been well aware that their best friend's a leer, and still refuse to push them away. Leers know the human mind more than any licensed psychologist could. They know what makes us happy, what makes us feel comfortable and wanted. They know your insecurities, and they know exactly how to make you feel like they aren’t there anymore. Not to mention how each one of them looks like they came straight out of the twilight films. Hell, I’m pretty sure the prom queens for the last 8 years have been leers, they are just so god-damn perfect. So be weary, you must resist the temptations. Once you know who the leer is, make sure you stay as far away as possible. All it takes is one conversation, and you're done for.\n\n***Libitina (Timber Creek’s Principal)***\n\nTo run the hell on earth that Timber Creek is, it’s only understandable that they left the reincarnation of Lucifer in charge. Imagine Miss Trunchbull, but ten times worse and with demonic fangs plus crimson red eyes. That’s Principal Libitina for you. Now, avoiding any interactions with her is easy, just follow the policy book that you’re given at orientation, don’t be a nuisance, and most importantly, **DO NOT** touch the flowers by the school gate. Miss Libitina is a massive gardener, and she hates when people mess with her plants. There’s a lot that will happen to you before the teachers are forced to send you to her office, but that is basically a death sentence. Miss Trunchbell had only one medieval torture device at her disposal. Principal Libitina on the other hand has a dungeon fill with them. Including (but no exclusive to), things like the Gridiron, which is basically a massive grill…for people of course. As well as the Thumbscrew, which squishes your thumb through the turning of a screw, self-explanatory. Her dungeon is also said to have a pit full of venomous snakes that many students have been thrown into, but the validity of these aren’t confirmed. Miss Libitina doesn’t have a high survival rate, so in honest terms, no one really know what happens to people who end up being on her bad side. Just be on your best behavior and pray she doesn’t catch you scribbling on the desks or something.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***I shall now get into the places that you should be careful around in Timber Creek, of which they are many. So take what I say next as gospel and STAY VIGILANT.***\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***The Pool***\n\nTimber Creek has a massive Olympic sized swimming pool by the field. It’s gorgeous, and for those of you who will join swimming club, you will have a great time using this facility. However, if you do go into the water, you’ll notice how there's a massive metal cage blocking off the last ten meters of the pool. It’s there for a reason. The end of the pool is hard to describe. Many have theorized it’s a portal to another parallel universe, or even one of Miss Libitina’s fucked up side-experiments. But as it goes for most things in Timber creek, we just don’t know. If you swim right up to the cage and look through to the other side, you won't be able to see the end of the pool. It looks as if you're staring into a massive ocean, infinitely long and infinitely deep. The illusion only works so long as you’re underwater, once you breach the surface, the pool looks of normal size. Sometimes you may even see large shadows looming in the distance. A friend of mine once saw a great white shark the size of a blue whale, another saw a colossal, eel like creature, rubbing against the cage. It really does your head in because you know physically nothing of that size should be able to fit in there, but they do, and it’s fascinating. Occasionally, massive squid tentacles may poke through the gaps in the cage, just be careful, you **DO NOT** want to be yanked by one of them. Other than that, the pool is pretty chill honestly, just don’t forget to bring a pair of googles, and look where you’re going.\n\n***Gym Showers***\n\nThere’s not much to this one, just don’t use the last stall. It pours blood instead of water. If you see someone walk out of there that you don’t recognize, leave the premises. That’s right, go to the front desk and ask for a sick slip, then go home. You’ll be followed all the way back, doesn’t matter if you’re walking, driving, or taking a fucking helicopter. You’ll be followed. Once you’re home, lock yourself in and stay in there till the next sunrise. Fun story though, one of the guys in my class used the shower as a dare, he ended up killing his own mother when he got home…well okay maybe not so fun story. But you get the gist, last stall = big no no.\n\n***The Well***\n\nNext to the field, right at the very end of the school where the boundary walls are, there’s an old well. It’s surrounded by a little picketed fence and the only place there that has dead grass around it. It’s been a little school tradition to hop over the fence, and try to throw something you cherish into the well. From what I heard, it’s the classic, grant you a wish type B.S. It might be true because a lot of people have done it, but it’s not as easy as it may sound. You see, the well is…well, simply put…alive. It breathes. You can hear and feel gusts of wind flowing out it’s mouth if you look into it. Be extremely cautious. The well is known to put people in a trance. Either making them think that a loved one is trapped in there, calling for them, or even just showing them something that would make you want to lean a little too far. If you do fall for its tricks, the bricks will shift, causing you to lose balance, and you will plummet god knows how deep into the abyss. A teacher once told us that the well leads you right down to hell, and anyone who’s fallen into it is now burning for the rest of eternity. Spooky fucking shit, so moral of the story, don’t risk your life for a stupid wish.\n\n***Janitor’s Closet***\n\nThe Janitor’s closet is the old room right next to the music hall. This is supposedly the place where shapeshifting entities like Gabriel are born. It reeks, smelling of old meat, and has this…bone chilling aurora about it. I just can’t put it into words. Now and then, the door is left open by Gabe, and you can catch a glimpse of what’s inside. The entire room looks like the inside of a mouth, red, meaty and extremely damp. It’s said that if you were to walk in there, you’d see things that our minds aren’t even capable of comprehending. That room also houses a number of disease carrying bacteria. One student, who got lost and accidentally walked into there, thinking it was a classroom, ending up giving every single person in the school whooping cough. Each student had to be quarantined, and the school was closed for a good few months. That room has some bad juju going on, and it’s in your best interest you steer clear from it.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWell, you’ve made it to the end, hopefully still enthusiastic about your first year in Timber Creek. I have left out a lot of other potential dangers as I still have college applications to worry about, but if you guys really want to, I might consider sharing some more secrets. Not to mention my own weird and wacky experiences in Timber Creek, like the time I had to run away from blood hungry vampires in the detention room. Oh, and the other time when I had fallen asleep in class and woke to the school being closed, just to find all my teachers sacrificing animals in the middle of the field. There’s a lot to talk about, and I’m willing to divulge, but for now, best of luck with your studies you rascals, signed with love, *Cassidy*.",

        "text": " \n\nI will show two cases, but there are many. This is the first.\n\nOn 6/21/2021, I dreamed and wrote down a dream. Then post it on Twitter. I was in an elevator. I am very afraid of them because in dreams they behave very strangely. I touched the 13th floor and began to rise. In the heights, the doors opened and there was nothing. There was the sky, clouds and when I looked down there was green in the surroundings and something that I described as a small mountain or similar to a hill. And I thought that I had touched the 13th floor, that something had to come. Shortly after, a kind of small finite apartment arrived that, in the end, had a kind of water tank. Everything, almost floating in the air. I woke up, I wrote it down and I really didn't know where the hand was coming from. Until the 24 of 6 of 2021 arrived. Tremendous news, a building collapsed in Miami. Literally part of the water tank was left hanging in a 12-story building, 13 was the terrace. There was a kind of hanging path that was formed by a ventilation duct. It was given on an avenue called Collins that its translation means Hill. And as if that were not enough, days later I found out that the famous daughter of a friend who died a few years ago was there and she and her partner were miraculously saved. They ran out of the elevator when they saw the dust covering everything. I mean, yes. The one who put me in that elevator in that dream was this girl's father. A way of saying, Hey I'm here. As previously mentioned, there is a range that generally goes from a few hours to a few days. In this type of case, 2 or 3.\n\n[https://twitter.com/BlackBubbles888/status/1407099793558708224?s=20&amp;t=fmNyltJsuc0coiI3lOlUyg](https://twitter.com/BlackBubbles888/status/1407099793558708224?s=20&amp;t=fmNyltJsuc0coiI3lOlUyg)\n\n[https://www.instagram.com/p/CUI69Q8pC8f/?utm\\_source=ig\\_web\\_copy\\_link](https://www.instagram.com/p/CUI69Q8pC8f/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)\n\n \n\nSecond Case\n\nI'm going to show you something that you might find interesting. Dreams are much more than they seem. We all have them, they occur on a plane we don't know, and they receive echoes from the space-time line. As if that were not enough, there are entities, beings that do not have a biological body and can use dreams to transcend messages. And these are validated because they use the time line. By showing an event from the future, they make you understand that the communication was real when it happened.\n\nThere are many cases. I have a list on my insta. And they are all publicly accessible. I'm going to put one of the last ones because I'm going through these days. I am going to tell it, explain it and then through the link that I am going to leave, they will be able to verify everything I tell. Sure, if you're interested. Because the idea is to reach people who may be interested and not have to read ignorant nonsense. If you're not interested, go ahead and save the malicious comment.\n\nI dream that I write down January 12, 2023. I write it down on my cell phone, notepad with date and time. Then, when I'm more awake, I post it on my social media. Especially Twitter. It cannot be modified, it has a certain date provided by servers.\n\nWar zone. A family. A young teenager wanted to drive. A boy maybe a little older, started a car. And we went for a walk... we were in front of a building destroyed in the middle, and in one of the bathrooms that had been left outside, a band was playing nice music. I stopped and exclaimed \"nice acoustic\". Then we crossed a gate, and we arrived like a river. A missile hit us and we fell into the water. And we were crouched by the shore. The young man who started the car was injured. He hid inside a boat and the enemy grabbed him. He told me that his body was going to be tied to a post. I don't know what he meant to tell me.\n\nDreams are a language. Everyone thinks they know something and that if you don't give dates and times or the matter isn't exact, it's just the product of your imagination. But that is a prejudice, a bias from a person who knows nothing about the subject. Believing you know is not having knowledge on the subject.\n\nFollowing... two days later, January 14, 2023. A missile falls on a building in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro. Which is located on the shore of a river, which has a similar name. The city is named after this river. The first piece of news I found spoke of 9 dead and 60 missing. And that a 15-year-old girl had died. The building was literally split in the middle.\n\nAnd there we have... the building, the young woman, the missile, the river. The boat is missing, right? January 16, 2023, I think... maybe 18, it happens that Russia denies the matter. He says it was probably Ukraine's anti-missile system. And from the Ukraine, he says they hit the building with an rh22 missile. An anti-ship missile. That they do not have the technology to stop that type of missile.\n\nPerhaps the post where the wounded youth was hung or tied... was the missile. You see, in dreams the communications are somewhat different. Here we chat, we talk as I do at this moment I tell you about these events. In dreams, it's like a movie. More visual, more metaphorical. They didn't say, hey, we're from a city where there's a huge river that gave its name to this metropolis. Rather, they took me there. and they showed how the missile came from the water. or, it served or is used for large and metallic things like a warship.\n\nThat's why I laugh when they say, che, without dates it's just your madness that you accommodate a boleo fact that fits what you say. How many missiles fell on a building lately? Look on the net, it hasn't happened for several months. Like 10. I mean, what do you know skinny? pay attention and learn.\n\nAnd this is how a small note that corresponds to a dream tells us about a future event. 2 days. And it was all over the news. Even the Pope condemned him on Twitter.\n\nDo you think it's just a case? Well no. They are many. Everyone tells something different obviously, related to his life, his end. But, there is not only death, there are other things. Like advancing Messi's change of course to another club or winning the third world cup. If I can leave a second link with Messi's dream announcing a third world cup before Christmas, I will. The dream says, three little bottles under a tree. The translation was, win the third cup near Christmas. That's why I try to explain to them that dreams are a language. Well, just let me put a link. If they ask for it, I make another post and put it up for them to see.\n\nI want to tell you that I am from Argentina. Surely my English is not very good. It may be that something you have read sounds strange to you or is not well understood. I'm sorry about that. But, I have to try.\n\n[https://twitter.com/BlackBubbles888/status/1613560999889539080?s=20&amp;t=fmNyltJsuc0coiI3lOlUyg](https://twitter.com/BlackBubbles888/status/1613560999889539080?s=20&amp;t=fmNyltJsuc0coiI3lOlUyg)\n\n[https://twitter.com/BlackBubbles888/status/1613557598086627330?s=20&amp;t=fmNyltJsuc0coiI3lOlUyg](https://twitter.com/BlackBubbles888/status/1613557598086627330?s=20&amp;t=fmNyltJsuc0coiI3lOlUyg)",

        "text": "*Editor’s note: This piece is published in the name of transparency to our readers. We believe that even the ramblings of a mad man ought to be open for public interpretation and criticism. To hide this letter would be a crime on our part. We do warn our dear readers that the following words are graphic. Please read with caution and scrutiny.*\n\nDear editor, and readers of the Michigan Post, \n\nIt’s true, I’m a rather paranoid person. This isn’t because I’m crazy, like you would have me labeled. I write to you today in order to clear my name of the crime I have committed, but of the crime of being labeled as another crazy delusional, murdering psychopath. My disease which you pronounce with the dirtiest of spittle in your mouth has superbly made me better than you. I hear, feel and see things of heaven and hell. I sense those things in between as well. Tell me, if I were truly insane, could I recall every minuscule detail of my tale? \n\nWith all honesty, it is frankly impossible to recall how my crime came into my thoughts. I just know that once I thought of it, I couldn’t get it out of my mind. Every waking moment became thoughts of her demise. You see, she never did me any harm. In fact, it was quite the opposite. She loved me, like a swan to its partner. I was wrapped so tightly around her finger that in order to live normally she would have to sever it. She kept me there, and without a doubt I enjoyed it. Everyday was like the first day of loving her. I called her name and she came running. \n\nI had no desire for her life insurance, this was trivial to me. Just as I said, I was completely hers. She never hurt me, never lied, and never rejected any of my suggestions for dates or activities. \nShe fucked like a sewing machine, she trapped me in two ways; in her heart and between her legs. A pro in bed, but a virgin by nature. She was innocent, sweet and loyal. \n\nIt was her eyes. They led to her ultimate downfall. A downfall in such a spectacular fashion, that to spend a moment away from it in my mind is a sin against humanity itself. \nWhenever her eyes met mine, I felt something deep inside. My blood ran cold and heaven itself opened up and swallowed me whole. I didn’t decide overnight to do my deed. No, no. It came to me each time she looked into my soul and dug out love that even I had no idea I had. You would say her eyes are what drove me mad, but I would say they drove me right, right into the destiny we both shared. \n\nI contest your infantile labeling of me as a psychopathic killer. You should’ve seen how smoothly I moved. I used nothing but the utmost precision and instinct, and the disease you say I have only increased my accuracy. For I had the hearing of a deer, and she was the deer caught in the headlights of my movements. \n\nOur relationship was arguably the strongest in the week leading up to her glorious finale. I had never treated a woman so well. Flowers, picnics, movies, chocolates and all the charades you supposedly morally superior people put on for one another, but behind the scenes I was working. \n\n In every way I was better than her. You see, we lived separately. She, on the other side of town, the poorer part. I drove a mercedes, she had a 1998 camry. I worked as a lawyer in a prestigious injury law firm, while she worked at a grocery store. \nLike you, the reader and the editor of this miserable paper, she was trash. \n\nThe final act of her life began on a late Sunday night. It was midnight, and she was soundly sleeping. I raised her window, the screen I had removed on one of our movie nights at her house, though you could call it a shack when compared to mine. \n\nI stuck my head into the window, and listened to her breathing while she slept peacefully. Slowly, over the next eight days, I went in further and further. Each time, I could hear her beating heart, thanks to the disease you say makes me dangerous to society. It would beat slow some nights, and fast others. She would have a nightmare, I could easily tell. Now tell me, do I not sound superior to the average person?\n\nFinally, on the night of her end, I was fully in her bedroom. This was not to be another night of intimacy in the “normal” sense of the word, but a night of entertainment, put on by the most fabulous entertainer himself. \nTo my dismay, she awoke as I was slightly through the window. She was startled by either a dream, or maybe she somehow caught on to my menacing show. She stayed in this state for about an hour. She was playing on her phone and texting me, the only person that could offer her a sense of safety. I waited so long my legs almost went numb. While I was waiting, I could hear her whisper to herself she said things like “It was nothing” and “Maybe it was that damn mouse again”. Little did she know, she was my mouse, and I was the cat. Chasing her, and soon enough I would have her within my claws. \n\nThere was ample time until she would go back to sleep. I could hear her heart even better now. Her blood pulsing through her veins, and her quick and shallow breath. She was still clearly in fear of my presence, despite not being aware of it. \n\nWith each pulse, each breath, I found my instincts harder and harder to control. I had to act, or else I would explode. I leapt through the rest of the window and as I came tumbling to the floor of her dilapidated house, her eyes again met mine. I felt empowered. I had a sense of ultimate judgment. Judgment that I would cast on her with excellent fury. That night, I was the judge, jury and executioner. \n\nWith one swift movement I grabbed her arm. She let out a shriek and I pulled her to the ground. I moved my hands with purpose to her throat. I latched on and held. I held tightly, so tightly. Her eyes locked with mine, driving me further into the night’s act. I strangled her with excellent ease. Her throat and vocal chords became merged with my fingers. The feeling I got from this was euphoric, though that isn’t a good enough word for it. \n\nMy senses were more than that of a trained dog. I heard everything. Even her last breath. This aroused me beyond belief, and as her eyes closed, I felt relief. \n\nI had completed my destiny and hers on that night. \n\nShe was now wrapped around my fingers, literally. \n\nNever before my heroic act of self determination had I felt the true extent of my supernatural powers. \n\nDeath had been around her for the past eight days. It stalked her, it learned her, and it took her. His shadow encased her in a hue of darkness. It trapped her for me, and made her quick and easy prey.",

        "text": "I live a little over an hour away from my mom. I’m renting a house from her and she needs some house paperwork she got in the mail. I make this hike every week to spend some time with her as well. However, I quit my job last night… well. Technically three weeks ago for me. And it’s the morning after. I’m not gonna get into why I quit, as it’s not relevant. But I think the reason why this is happening is so I can continue to contemplate my life choice where I don’t waste any time. It sound stupid. Utterly ridiculous. But it’s my only source of comfort. \n\nMaybe I’m wrong though, and I fucked with someone I shouldn’t have spiritually and this is my punishment. \n\nIt’s never ending though. I get on the interstate from the route 49 from Greenville, and I get on I-70 interstate and it’s straight forward. I go through Huber Heights, I’m in the left passing lane. I always pass the same Old Dominion semi truck. The license plate is for Franklin County Ohio. The same Chevy Equinox, from Darke County. And when I get into the middle lane, right as it splits into three lanes in Englewood, I pass another car in the far-far right lane from Montgomery County. \n\nI don’t know why it’s important to know the counties, but my eyes draw to them. Maybe it’s the boredom. But I always memorize it. \n\nI’ve tried to do different things. I’ve tried to get off in Huber Heights. Both exits. I’ve tried Springfield Enon. I’ve tried Xenia exit I’ve tried Springfield, South Charleston. I tried to get off at route 62. And I’ve tried pushing through, maybe I’ll get to Columbus eventually, maybe Dayton if I hit I-75 — But to no avail. I get jumped back to right where I started. \n\nGetting onto the on-ramp from route 49, a couple miles from Philipsburg. \n\nAfter a certain threshold it’s like the world rewinds. And it’s always in the same spot, right before my normal exit to get to my moms house. \n\nAnd before you ask. Yes. I’ve tried crossing the median to go home. I’ve even caused two accidents. But right on impact, I blink. And I’m right back to where I started. \n\nThe weird thing though? My feed for my socials keep updating as if I’m not stuck in a loop. But in a weird way; because sure. My clock goes back too, but the only thing that changes is the posts made, but even though the content of the post is different every single time. It’s still always posted at the same time. \n\nAnd example: a twitter thread about Ukraine  can be posted at 2:30pm. But when my threshold hits. I check my twitter, and there is a 2:30pm post, but not about Ukraine, but about some novice YouTuber that no one cares about. It’s from the exact same person though. \n\nHell, I’ve even struck up conversations with twitter threads in hope that maybe the notification would still be there, and the user simply deleted it. But nope. It’s like it never existed. \n\nI hope that makes sense. Maybe not. \n\nThat’s why I’m posting this here. I have my drivers assist on in my car to help me stay in my lane as if it matters. \n\nI’ve read stories here about being stuck in a time loop before on here, and they’re interesting, if impossible. But now I know. It’s not impossible. It happens. \n\nI’m not too distraught about it though I guess. My YouTube feed updates for something new to watch, which is good. So I have entertainment. My gas tank is still full, my phone battery is fine. And all the stories I’ve read on here seem to get out of the loop eventually. \n\nBut sometimes a thought does cross my mind. \n\nWhat about the ones that don’t make it out, and have been trapped for months? Years? Decades? \n\nMy case seems super unorthodox though. Haven’t read one where they’ve had good access to internet. \n\nI call my mom. My roommate, and a few friends and it’s them saying the same thing. In short sentences. \n\nMy mom: “hey. I’m busy right now I’ll call you back in a couple minutes.” Call ends. \n\nMy roomate: “thanks for waking me up I was gonna be late if you didn’t. But I’m gonna hang up so I can get ready.” Call ends. \n\nAnd when I try to call back, the line is dead. I can’t hardly ever get a word in. \n\nI’ve tried not blinking, before you ask. But have you tried to not blink for an hour an ten minutes? Haha. \n\nI am hopeful though. \n\nI’ve tried to tuck and roll from the car to end my life, but the doors won’t budge, and the window doesn’t roll down all the way. So… that sucks. \n\nAnyways. I’ll give you an update if anything changes. Suggestions would be nice. Maybe some theories too? I’ll even welcome “Typical day in Ohio.” Jokes. \n\nI’m also giving you these locations because if post might not even stay up after I hit the threshold. I haven’t tried anything like this yet, so, I’m not too worried. Hell. Maybe someone will be driving down the same interstate and see me, and find a way to break the cycle. \n\nThanks for reading, and I’ll definitely give an update. If there ever is one.",

        "text": "The Somber Starlight Roadhouse is just a couple miles north along the highway from my cemetery. While I’ve never slept in any of its rooms, I’ve eaten at its diner often, which is how I first became acquainted with its proprietor, Leon Kingfisher. Sometime after I had become a regular at his establishment, he struck up some polite conversation with me, and both of us quickly picked up on the fact that the other was initiated into the occult. I know I’ve only mentioned him a couple of times in passing in my [previous stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheVespersBell/comments/k0mzno/links_to_hallowed_ground_and_its_direct_sequels/), but I consider him a trusted contact and good friend.\n\nAfter my last little adventure, I found myself needing to call upon his expertise once again. I have a custom of hiking north through Harrowick Woods and eating at the Roadhouse before heading back home, and this visit was no different. I checked the front office first though in the hopes of finding Leon, and sure enough, I found him bickering with a less-than-satisfied customer.\n\n“Dude, these aren’t real!” the irritated man insisted, gesturing to a rack of colourful, modern dreamcatchers made with plastic beads and fake feathers.\n\n“Read the asterisk. They’re authentic in the sense that you’re buying them from a First Nation’s merchant, which I am, not that they were made using traditional methods or materials,” Leon explained patiently. “They even come with a little card explaining their significance and how to properly use them so that it’s cultural appreciation and not appropriation.”\n\n“I don’t give a shit about cultural appropriation, and it’s obvious you don’t either,” the customer claimed. His eyes wandered upwards, behind Leon to a traditional dreamcatcher hanging from the ceiling. “How much for the real one?”\n\nLeon turned around to confirm that the customer was asking for the one he thought he was. It was made from ancient willow branches, silent owl feathers, and polished river stones, including one set dead-center to resemble an all-seeing eye.\n\n“The real one’s not for sale. You wouldn’t appreciate it, culturally or otherwise,” was Leon’s adamant reply. “And as there’s someone else waiting in line, if you’re not going to buy anything, I’m going to have to ask that you move along.”\n\n“Yeah, I’m not buying any of your tacky, tourist trap crap,” the customer spat as he turned away in disdain.\n\n“Does that mean I wouldn’t be able to interest you in a howling black moon t-shirt or hoodie?” Leon asked facetiously as the customer walked out the door. “Ah, I’ll get him next time. Hey Samantha, how are you doing?”\n\n“Hi, Leon. Are you sure that guy didn’t know what he was trying to buy?” I asked, knowing what an effective ward that dreamcatcher was against unwanted spirits. My own spirit familiar Elam wasn’t even able to set foot in that office.\n\n“If he did, he would have made an actual offer instead of just walking out,” he replied. “His loss. What brings you in, Samantha? You look like you’ve come on business.”\n\n“I have. I recently had the opportunity to visit the village of [Virklitch](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheVespersBell/comments/ygrmxn/the_veiled_village/), and I was wondering if you might know anything about the entity they call the Effulgent One,” I said. “None of Artaxerxes’ old books mention it at all. If it’s not something that was known to the Ophion Occult Order, then my next guess is that it was something already endemic to the area. I was curious if you knew if your clan had ever had any contact with it before Sombermorey was founded.”\n\nLeon’s expression turned grave, and he seemed to be debating what his next words should be.\n\n“Did you see it?” he asked finally, his voice soft and low.\n\n“I did. So did Eve, Lottie, and Elam,” I nodded.\n\n“Well then, Elam’s a dead man,” he joked. “As for the rest of you, well… I think we should sit down. I need you to tell me what happened first.”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n“And she summoned it with nothing but a prayer and a totem? You’re sure?” he asked, sitting across from me in his diner as he sipped black coffee from one of his kitsch, howling black moon mugs.\n\n“As far as I could tell, yeah,” I replied, finishing off my omelet. “And this entity, this Effulgent One, it was strong enough to overpower Issiole’s ancient familiar Iffairea and banish her back to the Astral Plane like it was nothing. It had to be a god or Titan of some kind, and it must be serving the Virklitchen of its own will since I don’t see how they could possibly be compelling it. What really worries me though is that I saw Rosalyn Romero, the young woman who works for *Thorne Tech*, take some readings of it with one of those parathaumameter things that the Ophion Occult Order uses. Erich Thorne’s studying it, and probably Ivy Noir too. Maybe on their own, maybe at the behest of the Order, but I’m terrified that they want to somehow draw this thing into their conflict with [Emrys](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheVespersBell/comments/xtdtka/emrys_arc_index/). I’m not welcomed back at Virklitch at the moment, and you were the only other person I could think of who might have any idea what it is and what kind of threat it poses.”\n\n“You saw it, but it didn’t acknowledge you? You’re sure? Not a glace, not a nod, nothing?” he asked.\n\n“I’m sure. It went straight for Iffairea, expressed some minor annoyance at Elifey, then wandered back off. As far as it was concerned, my coven and I weren’t there,” I assured him.\n\n“Good, good. It can see anyone it’s marked as its followers at all times, and they can see it whenever it passes through our world,” he told me. “I’ve told you before that my clan used Pendragon Hill as a lookout point, but we knew that strange magic flowed under it and considered it cursed. We never made any villages within sight of that hill, or even camps if we could help it. We had known for centuries that if someone was to climb to the summit at night, when the Veil was thin and the stars were right, they would sometimes see a spirit we named the Sky Strider wandering along the horizon. Those of us with keen Second Sight or who were undertaking a vision quest saw it more often, which led us to think that it was *always* there, and always watching.\n\n“The Sky Strider always appeared to us as a distant red light that was just bright enough to illuminate the colossal, gangling body it was mounted on. There was no harm in just looking at it, unless it noticed you looking at it. Then, there was no hiding from it. It could see you, and you could see it, even when you were off the hill. Those few of us who could see it would often try to chase it down or get ahead of it to make it an offering, trying to earn its favour. Most failed or were driven mad, and a few were never heard from again.\n\n“When the first white settlers founded Sombermorey, my clan had dealings with them, including Morgana King and her coven. That’s most likely how Issiole first learned of the spirit she would call the Effulgent One. My clan often thought of it as the guardian of that hill, so I assume Morgana needed it gone so that they could use the hill for their rituals. I can’t say for certain why Issiole was successful in earning its favour, but I do know that if it remained loyal to Issiole after her falling out with Morgana, and has remained loyal to the Virklitchen after all this time, then it can’t possibly be serving the Ophion Occult Order. That would explain Thorne and Noir’s interest in it.\n\n“Whether or not it would be of any use against Old Rosebud, I really don’t know. But, if it was able to banish Issiole’s familiar as easily as you say, I suppose there’s a chance it could do the same for Emrys.”\n\n“It considers Rosalyn one of its followers. I’m sure of that,” I told him. “If she can learn how to summon it, and does so when she might be in danger from Emrys, it would attack him the same way it attacked Iffairea. Seneca mentioned that there was a plan to lure Emrys into a Spell Circle, but it’s hit a couple of snags. Unleashing the Effulgent One on him probably has a better chance of working.”\n\n“It has a better chance of backfiring too,” Leon asserted. “The Sky Strider is a powerful, primeval spirit, and it won’t appreciate being tricked into doing the Order’s dirty work. For all we know, it could side with Emrys against them.”\n\n“I’m sure they’re aware of that, but they’re getting desperate,” I said. “They’ve had no success in getting Emrys under control these past two years. If they don’t banish him before he can break his chains, they’re up a creek. Thorne’s studying the Effulgent One for a reason, and I’m sure that reason has to do with Emrys. If he can, he’s going to draw the Effulgent One into this, no matter the risks.”\n\n“Have you spoken to Rosalyn about this? If she does anything the Sky Strider considers to be an act of betrayal, she could be in more danger than anyone,” Leon asked.\n\n“Not yet, no. I don’t have her personal contact information, and *Thorne Tech* won’t put me in touch with her,” I lamented. “Which stinks, because other than the Virklitchen themselves, she probably knows more about the Effulgent One than anybody.”\n\n“Maybe mention it to Orville. He knows her, and they’re on friendly terms,” Leon suggested. “She needs to know what kind of danger she’s in. I’ve never met Erich personally, but I know enough about him that I wouldn’t trust him to prioritize the safety of his employees. I have met Ivy Noir, though. She stayed here a few nights a couple of years ago when she first moved out here. I’d describe her as haughty, self-assured, and not afraid to break a few eggs. Not someone I’d trust with Rosalyn’s safety, either. You make sure that she knows what she’s getting into, here. I know this whole mess with Emrys is complicated, but I wouldn’t feel right being complicit in the Order tossing their own subordinates under the bus to stop him.”\n\n“Neither would I,” I agreed with a pensive nod, reaching for my own mug of coffee.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nA couple of days later I was reading in the parlour at Eve’s Eden, hoping for a walk-in to fill a gap in the day’s schedule.\n\n“I’m looking for Samantha Sumner. Is she in?” I overheard someone say in the front lobby. I immediately perked up, as I was fairly certain the voice belonged to Rosalyn. I hadn’t been expecting her, but I’d taken Leon’s advice. I let our neighbour Orville know that I was trying to get in touch with Rosalyn, making sure he knew that Erich and Ivy might be trying to get her to do something that could put her in danger. I hadn’t heard from him since, but it seemed he had managed to get a hold of her.\n\n“Just in the parlour to your right,” our shop girl Jeanie directed her.\n\nSeconds later, the beaded glass curtain parted aside as a young woman passed under it. Though we had only met once before, I instantly recognized her deep brown eyes and soft brown face framed by a bob of wavy dark hair. She was also dressed in the same boots, dark jeans and leather jacket she had worn on our previous encounter, eliminating any doubt from my mind that it was her.\n\n“Rosalyn!” I said excitedly. “I’ve been trying –”\n\n“First, I want to say that for a business that is so proudly woman-owned and led, the profusion of erotic nude artwork in this place is pretty off-putting,” she said, gesturing to one of the multiple portraits of sexualized nymphs and fairies that decorated Genevieve’s home and business.\n\n“Yeah, I hear you, but Eve's pretty big on body and sex positivity, plus a lot were commissioned by her great aunt, so she’s pretty attached to them,” I apologized. “They were all painted by women, if that helps.”\n\n“It doesn’t matter to me who jerks off to them,” she said with a shake of her head. “Secondly, Elifey wants me to tell you how sorry she is.”\n\n“She’s sorry? You were nearly killed by the spirit she enraged,” I reminded her.\n\n“She’s ten! She’s a little girl under a ludicrous amount of pressure to ensure the survival and prosperity of her village!” Rosalyn defended her. “If you want to be mad at someone, blame her grandfather for putting her up to it! But, that’s not really what I came here to talk to you about.”\n\nShe sat down across from me and handed me a folded-up piece of notebook paper.\n\n“You’ve been wanting to know about the Effulgent One, right? The cyclops thing you saw in Virklitch?” she asked. “Since you’ve already seen it, and Erich and Ivy would like to keep you on as a consultant, I’ve been cleared to share some information with you. That sheet there is a copy of the readings I got off it.”\n\nRaising my eyebrow curiously at her, I slowly unfolded the paper and took a look at its contents.\n\n*‘Local Ontological Stability Index (The Veil): 41.3 – 43.4 Oms (baseline is 100).*\n\n*Ectoplasmic Condensates: Peaked at approximately 440 ppm (Anything above 1 ppm indicates either a nearby spectral presence or recent thaumaturgical activity).*\n\n*Psionic Emanations peaked at approximately 93 kilothaums in the ‘blue-violet’ spectrum. One thaum is the minimum required for any noticeable paranormal activity. Blue psionic emanations manipulate particles and forces, and violet emanations suspend or alter natural laws.*\n\n*No Empyrean or Chthonic astral signature was detected. Astral signature was black.’*\n\n“This doesn’t really tell me anything other than that it’s a very powerful and very big spectral creature, which I already knew,” I said flatly.\n\n“It tells us that it interacts with the Physical Plane the same way any other ghost or god does; through the panpsychic force shared across both our planes,” she asserted. “It’s the last part that’s the most concerning. It seems that it’s of neither Heaven nor Hell. It’s…”\n\n“It’s like Emrys,” I finished for her. “His astral signature is black too, because he’s not from the Astral Plane at all. He’s from outside our reality altogether, and so is the Effulgent One. That thing we saw, it’s an avatar as much as Emrys is. An avatar of something outside our universe. This pseudoscientific jargon here is worthless because it’s only describing the finger puppet that the Effulgent One is using to interact with our world. We have no idea what it actually is or what it’s actually capable of. We can’t risk getting involved with it.”\n\n“I’m already involved with it!” she shouted, straining to contain the fear and frustration in her voice.  “You know that. That’s why you wanted to talk to me, right?”\n\n“I just wanted to be sure you knew what kind of danger you might be in,” I said softly, trying my best to calm her. “Please tell me Erich and Ivy aren’t planning to try to sic this thing on Emrys.”\n\n“They want me to try to convince the Virklitchen to ask it for its help,” she admitted with a hint of embarrassment. “You saw what happened. Elifey invoked its protection against a malicious spirit, and it came immediately.”\n\n“Yes, against a spirit that was clearly nothing to it!” I reminded her. “Emrys would be a lot closer to picking on someone its own size, and that’s assuming it can be convinced to attack Emrys in the first place. Unless Emrys was a direct threat to the Virklitchen, I don’t see why it should care who the Ophion Occult Orders considers an enemy.”\n\n“Ivy’s thinking is that since they’re both avatars of Extra-universal entities, maybe our world isn’t big enough for the both of them,” Rosalyn explained. “But it’s only one option the Order’s considering. For what it’s worth, I don’t expect much to come of it. The real reason I came down here in person is that I’d like you to give me a reading.”\n\n“You want a reading? From me?” I asked incredulously.\n\n“Please. All Erich’s parathaumameter can tell me is that there’s a streak of black in my astral signature now, and I don’t know what that means,” she said.\n\n“It’s very faint. I didn’t even notice it in you until I saw it in the Virklitchen,” I added, sighing slightly as I considered her request. “Hold out your hands, please.”\n\nShe did as I asked, and I touched my fingertips to hers. Closing my eyes and breathing in deeply, I put all my focus on my clairvoyance and allowed her vibrations to flow through me without resistance.\n\n“It’s aware of you, as you are of it, though I feel that the connection is still very weak. It could probably still be broken, if you wanted,” I told her. A gave her a few seconds to react to this idea, and when she didn’t respond, I didn’t press it. “I can’t sense much through the connection, so little of its attention is on you, but it definitely feels ancient and alien to me. I wouldn’t even feel comfortable describing it as benevolent, malevolent, or apathetic. It will do as it wills, and I cannot foresee how it will react to anything. When it saved you, it wasn’t obeying Elifey. Her prayers simply helped to draw its focus to the situation. That’s all anyone could ever hope to accomplish; draw its attention. It’s beyond any of our abilities to coerce or command. I don’t know why it’s in our world, or why it’s guarding the Virklitchen, and I have no idea how it would react to Emrys. I’m sorry.”\n\n“It’s here now, isn’t it?” she asked quietly. “Not in this room, obviously. I mean, in our world. In Harrowick County. I can feel it when it is, kind of like how someone with arthritis knows when it’s going to rain. If I look out towards where I feel it is, sometimes I can see its light on the horizon.”\n\n“I… I’m sorry. I can’t tell where it is,” I confessed.\n\n“No, I guess you wouldn’t be able to, any more than I’d be able to sense that glade out in Harrowick Woods you love so much,” she said with a resigned sigh. “What does it mean for me, that I’m bound to this thing now? That my soul has a streak of black in it?”\n\n“Well, based on what I’ve read about Emrys – and keep in mind, all that information comes from the Ophion Occult Order and is not necessarily accurate – it could be a soul flayer,” I answered honestly. “It could use the connection between you to separate your consciousness from your physical and astral bodies and draw it into its own reality, or its own being. I know the term ‘soul flaying’ doesn’t sound very appealing, but… I think it could possibly be a form of Nirvana. You’d be free from Samsara, from both the Physical and Astral Planes, from Karma and the whims of lesser gods, and even become one with God with a capital G. Just, not the God of our reality. I think that’s how Emrys views it, at least, and maybe the Effulgent One does too. What do the Virklitchen believe awaits them after death?”\n\n“They… believe in transcendence, yeah. That the Effulgent One watches over them in death and in life, and that when he deems them ready and worthy, it calls them to dwell with it in its own realm,” she replied, her tone sounding more wary than exhilarated by the prospect.\n\n“I realize the ultimate fate of your eternal soul can be a pretty unsettling subject to contemplate,” I sympathized with her. “My advice to you then is… don’t. Enlightenment is a lot like falling asleep, ironically enough. You can’t do it if you’re trying too hard, and no one ever achieved Nirvana by hating life and trying to escape it as quickly as possible. When you know, or believe beyond all doubt, that there’s an afterlife, that gnosis can impact you in profound ways, both positive and negative. But achieving Nirvana takes wisdom, and wisdom comes from experience. That’s why you should live your life as Humanistically as possible. Spend it exactly as you would if you thought it was the only life you would ever have. Do work that matters to you, bring Tim Bits to Elifey and pretend she’s the little sister you never had, make love to that guy I saw you flirting with in the dining hall. Watch Autumn leaves fluttering to the ground in a cemetery, and magnolia blossoms blooming in Spring. Wander through tranquil woods, gaze out upon serene waters, admire anything and everything you consider beautiful and good and just breathe. Your focus should be on experiencing life while you have the chance. You’ll have all eternity to worry about what comes after.”\n\n“That’s honestly pretty good advice,” she sighed with a somewhat forced smile. “I’ll try to keep it in mind. Thank you, Samantha.”\n\n“You’re welcome,” I smiled back. I began to draw my hands back, but stopped when I noticed a circular tattoo on her wrist. “Is that… a Virklitchen tattoo?”\n\n“Oh… yeah,” she answered softly. “Elifey talked me into it after Iffairea attacked me. She said it was part of the covenant that Issiole made with the Effulgent One. Erich calls it an ‘apotropaic semiotic icon’. It’s supposed to make it easier for other spirits to recognize that streak of black in my soul as being the mark of the Effulgent One so that they know I’m under its protection and that they should stay clear. Kind of like…”\n\n“Like a dreamcatcher,” I finished her sentence once again. “You should be honoured they shared this with you. I know from experience that wards like this are too valuable to sell.”\n\n“That’s good to know,” she said with a sage nod. “Though maybe you should avoid saying that sort of thing within earshot of your little New Age [gift](https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/) [shop](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/).”",

        "text": " A one-time foray into the hundred-acre wood...\n\n1\n\nYou arrive in the hundred-acre wood. The sun is shining and the air is warm. You are walking at a leisurely pace along the grass when some distant sounds make you aware of a small home nearby. Coming from the wide open windows you can hear grunting and moaning coming from a bass-heavy speaker. Do you wish to pop your head through the window and investigate the noise? Turn to 2. Or do you wish to ignore this noise and explore somewhere else in the woods? Turn to 9.\n\n2\n\nYou sidle up to the little house and stick your head through the open windows. There is a television connected to door height speakers. The television is showing graphic hardcore interspecies sex. In an armchair sits Pooh bear, immersed in the entertainment. Pooh is covered in honey and has a hand cupped underneath himself. The mechanics of how Pooh, seemingly without genitalia, can pleasure himself mystify you. You decide you are being invasive and try to pull your head from the window but knock yourself on the roof of the frame. Pooh’s head snaps round to see you and a look of panic morphs into one of sinister delight. He launches himself out of his chair and begins charging at the window, whilst upping the volume of the television speakers rapidly. Your jacket is caught on the window ledge. Flip a coin.  If heads, you free yourself before Pooh gets to you, got to 3. If tails, luck is not on your side, turn to 4. \n\n3\n\nPooh’s aggression seems to be subdued by the lack of loud animal sex sounds. He bumbles over to the speakers and begins gently inspecting the parts. You decide it best to take your leave. Moving on down a path, you hum a song sweet tune to yourself. So engrossed in your song, have you been, that upon hearing a frightened squeal you only manage to catch the faintest blur of a small pink figure darting from the path behind a tree to your right. ‘H-H-Who’s there?’ asks the creature behind the tree. You notice what is unmistakably the barrel of a shotgun protruding from the side of the trunk. Will you claim to be the best friend of Christopher Robin? Turn to 7. Or will you reach forth and grab the shotgun stem, and point it on its current holder? Turn to 6.\n\n4\n\nPooh’s hands close in on each lapel of your jacket and he violently hauls you though the window and onto the floor. Pooh stands over you and pours honey from ahigh over himself, with much of it trickling down on to yourself. He rubs himself rhythmically and tries to moan along with the audio from the playing graphic film. He leans in very close to your ear and whispers ‘You’re not a friend of Christopher Robin’s are you, you little bitch?’. Before you have time to answer Pooh manoeuvres himself quick-like-lightning so his face is over your crotch, his own crotch being on your face. ‘Now’s the time for a sixty nine!’ He cackles and begins to hurriedly remove your belt. Suddenly the speakers blow, for Pooh had been playing them above the recommended sound limit for too long. ‘Oh, bother’ Pooh remarks, distracted by the change. Will you help Pooh repair the audio for his television? Turn to 5. Or will you take your chance to escape out the window. Turn to 3.\n\n5\n\nPooh is characterised by a calmer manner as he scratches his head and examines the left speaker. You naturally inspect the right. Looking at it from behind you can see that professional work will need to be carried out if these mighty speakers are to entertain once more. Pooh glances over at you curiously. ‘Hmmm, I wonder’ he mutters to himself before disappearing into a back room. You decide it best to take your leave now and make for the door. But a voice stops you in your tracks. ‘You weren’t leaving were you.’ Asks Pooh with just a hint of menace, re-emerging from the back room. You slowly turn around and are shocked to see Pooh draped in a translucent black shawl, carrying a small wooden box. ‘It’s time for tarot.’ He seats himself at his table and stares up you with an intensity that wills you to join him. Pooh closes his eyes and begins shuffling his tarot cards before slapping down a selection in a crude diamond formation. With his eyes still closed, he begins moving his hand over the cards whilst murmuring in what appears to be a borderline-offensive ‘Arabic’, before flipping over the first. You both look and see a green, ‘reverse’ card from an UNO deck. ‘Oh dear’ you say politely, expecting that an uno card having mistakenly found its way into Pooh’s tarot deck to supply the launching point for an amusing anecdote that will relieve the, frankly, unbearable tension. ‘Oh dear indeed’ Pooh murmurs, looking into your eyes. ‘Death.’ You lean back, looking bemused, half-smiling, searching the bear for a sign that he is joking. Without breaking eye contact, he flips a second card. You glance at it and see the Queen of hearts. Pooh does not even look at the card but maintains the eye contact and leans in closer to you. ‘Death again.’ He mutters, ‘Oh dear, oh dear.’ You begin to sweat as Pooh flips over a third and fourth in quick succession. ‘Death, death death.’ He lurches out of his seat and furiously pushes you out of your chair and onto the ground. Flip a coin. If heads, turn to 10. If tails, turn to 11.\n\n6\n\nYou lurch forwards to seize the barrel of the shotgun but slip in the mud as you do so. Your head hits a stone and you are rendered unconscious. Turn to 8.\n\n7\n\n‘It is I, \\[YOUR NAME HERE\\], a friend of Christopher Robin’s!’ You boldly exclaim, attempting to sound jovial, but feel the feverish pang of self-consciousness at your embarrassing theatricality. Out from behind the tree steps Piglet, with the shotgun lowered, yet firmly grasped. Piglet has his face held in what is clearly an attempt at ‘the Clint Eastwood’; he is sceptical of your claim. ‘It was nice to meet you,’ he half-whispers. You smile and nod, merrily indicating your reciprocity. An awkward silence befalls you both. ‘Go on then, fuck off.’ Piglet croaks, patting his gun. You take the hint and hurry on your way. Turn to 9.  \n\n8\n\nYou begin to stir. Your head hurts like a motherfucker. As you struggle to correct your bleary vision you intend to ask for water for to quench your thirst. But your mouth is full of shotgun. Piglet is looking straight into your eyes whilst holding the firearm. ‘All I ever wanted was to be a Pooh’s best friend’ he says. ‘And sure, it would seem that way, for hours – days even – at a time. But when Christopher Robin would come along, Pooh would forget me straight away. Oh, all those nights when he would tell me he loved me, that I was his! I gave myself to him! All of me! I would spend the mornings sewing myself up, from the small of my back up to my chest. And I would tell myself it was worth it. Cause that’s ‘what best friends do’ Pooh would tell me.’ As piglet gets more and more irate, you begin to move your hands, with a plan to usurp this angry little creature. But piglet detects your fumbling and jams the gun into your mouth, chipping several teeth. ‘And now, I see you coming from his house! First Christopher Robin. And now you, whoever the fuck YOU are. I should never have trusted Pooh. Pooh, Pooh, Pooh the slut. Pooh the whore. Well this’ll show him, one lover less, he’ll come back to Piglet, he’ll have no choice!’ You yearn to explain the gross errors in Piglet’s judgements regarding the goings on at Pooh’s house, but it is no use. His mind is made up. His finger tightens. Your brain paints the hundred-acre wood. The adventure ends here for you.\n\n9\n\nYou encounter a babbling brook and decide to sit down for a brief rest. Whilst hypnotically lost in the tranquil flow, you are distracted by the sight of a lone syringe floating downstream. ‘Oh no,’ you think, ‘a local doctor must have lost his medical equipment!’ You wade into the shallow the water and fish out the syringe and decide to follow the river upstream to find the doctor. Turn to 12.\n\n10\n\nAs your head hits the floor you notice that under the table is a hardback copy of *Allen Carr’s Easy Way to Lose Weight*. With your instincts about you, you grab the book and swing it to above your head, perfectly shielding yourself from the stomp of Pooh’s foot. You push up as Pooh’s heel connects and manage to throw him onto his back. Standing up, you swing the overrated self-help literature at Pooh’s cheek, rendering him unconscious and make your exit swiftly. Outside, will you follow the path to your right, turn to 3 or head towards the stream in the distance, turn to 9.  \n\n11\n\nAs your head hits the floor you notice that under the table is a hardback copy of *Allen Carr’s Easy Way to Lose Weight*. You grab the book but Pooh stomps straight on your wrist, audibly crushing your bone.  He seizes a handful of your hair and drags you out the front door, throwing you down by a sizable overground root. ‘Bite.’ He instructs. You scramble to protest but are punched in the groin. ‘Bite the root, honkey.’  You open your mouth and obediently bite the root. Pooh then stomps the back of your head with such force that your brain becomes one with the hundred-acre wood. The adventure ends here for you.\n\n12\n\n‘Doctor! Doctor!’ you call as you step out of the stream, but there is no answer to your cries. You decide to head back downstream when in the near distance you notice an arrangement of sticks forming a small shelter. Curiosity may have killed the cat, but it leads to you to mosey on up to this structure and peer inside. There are plentiful syringes, just like the one in your hand, scattered all about the floor. ‘Aha, this must be where the doctor lives,’ you think. An annoying sound catches your ear and you pull your head back out into the open. A song is being sung by an approaching singer. ‘The wonderful thing about tiggers is tiggers are wonderful things!’ Tigger stops and stares at you. ‘You must be the doctor,’ you say. Tigger looks momentarily confused before seeing the needle in your hand. He winks at you and exclaims ‘Ah yesth, and you musth be the patient!’ whilst producing a small bag of brown-white powder, grinning at you. When it becomes clear you don’t know what’s going on, Tigger smiles at you knowingly and takes the needle out your hand. ‘Still full I see! Do you mind if I do the honours?’ Will you oblige Tigger? Turn to 13. Or will you refuse? Turn to 14.  \n\n13\n\nTigger jabs the needle into your arm and pushes the end of the syringe down. You relax in the shelter. You *feel* it. Yes, you feel *it*. Tigger starts to sing ‘Comfortably Numb’ by Pink Floyd. It is both tuneless and irritating, but you are *feeling it* far too much to make any complaints. As time passes, you find yourself unable to make any movement, and it seems Tigger is aware of this also. He pours his powder onto a spoon and heats it up with an inexpensive bic lighter whilst he sings. He picks up one of the syringes off the floor you saw earlier, fills it up with the liquid from his spoon before jamming it into your arm and pressing. You feel this was unnecessary but now you are *feeling it* even more than before. But Tigger does not stop, he heats up more powder and injects you again. And again. And again. And again. And again. Somewhere along the way you blackout. You heart stops. The adventure ends here for you. \n\n14\n\n‘Suit yourselfth!’ says Tigger and puts the powder away. ‘I say, you haven’t seen Eeyore have you?’ asks Tigger. ‘He’s another patient of mine’ He winks as you once more. You inform Tigger that you have no knowledge as to the whereabouts of Eeyore. Tigger starts looking in and around the shelter and shouting Eeyore’s name. You hear a low, monotonous voice in the distance ‘I’m over here’. Turn to 15.",

        "text": "(I just threw this together in half an hour but hey let’s see how far I can go with it, and I hope you enjoy reading my story and will stay tuned for the updates )\n\nLate into the night George was tossing and turning in bed struggling to get to sleep, all that was on his mind was that there was something he hasn’t done or needed to do, he unwillingly got up out of bed and walked into the bathroom, he turned on the tap and splashed his face with water, \n\nhe then walked downstairs into his kitchen and proceeded to pour himself a glass of whiskey to try and send him to sleep that way, after he finished his first glass he pours another and half way through drinking it he hears three loud spaces out knocks on his front door, the sound made him jump causing him to drop his glass shattering it on the wooden floor,\n\n angrily he walked to the door ready to start an argument but to his surprise his porch was empty. Looking around in confusion George saw nothing but his desolate suburban street, George walks back inside thinking it was some neighbourhood kids playing a prank on him and started cleaning up the broken glass, \n\nwhilst he was moping up the whiskey he heard the same three knocks on his front door again, George got up and begrudgingly opened the door, and as before no one was there, being stressed and over tired George looks down to the floor and notices something beneath his feet, he reaches down and picks up a envelope, as he holds it he feels something wet on his fingers and when he looks at his hand, his fingers are covered in blood, \n\nin terror George turns the envelope around and written in blood says “help me” seeing this George freaks out, dropping the letter and slamming his door shut, he stands there on the opposite side of the door until his silence is broke by the same three knocks. George waits a while before opening the door and when he manages to swing it open… nothing. \n\nHe decides to pick up the letter and take it inside, he takes it in his kitchen and being scared but also a bit curios he opens the letter and it says \n\n“hello, I know you don’t know me but I know you George, I am in danger and I need your help, there are ten other letters you need to find and in those letters are clues to help you piece together my location, and rescue me, I know you may be confused George but when they said to choose someone, the only person I can trust is you, I can’t say much more but you will understand more throughout each letter… the first clue is (something you regret) please help me George. My life falls in your hands…”\n\nLet me know if you would like part 2 cause I know I’m gonna enjoy writing it 😁",

        "text": "It was a Saturday. I was in my dorm room procrastinating my homework with some Minecraft. Not the official release though. I barely have enough money for a single meal each day let alone thirty dollars for a luxury. But you can meet very interesting people at college and one of the guys I knew could get you bootlegged versions of pretty much anything you wanted. Movies, music, games, Calvin had it all. He’d told me that he’d never given anything away for free before, but he knew I was in a hard place and he’d give me anything I wanted as long as I brought the flashdrive.\n\nI live above the boilers and my room is always ridiculously hot, so I keep the window cracked to let in some of the cooler winter air. It was snowing. The only people outside were those few rich students who had energetic dogs like huskies, shepherds, or the one Belgian Malinois and needed to take them for a run each day or risk their dogs going stir crazy. It was evening now and all ten or so of them seemed to be outside at once. No doubt they had been waiting for the snow to stop falling quite so heavily, but now with it worse than ever and the sun starting to sink below the horizon, they had no other choice.\n\nI had headphones on, completely immersing myself in the game as I tried to forget about life for just a little while. I’d gotten it last week, but that was the first day that I was able to find the time to play it. The game’s music, the “thunk” of placing blocks, and the vague growling of the zombies outside my base all melded together in my ears. Just outside of my headphones, I could hear the frantic whirring of my laptop’s fan. That was the reason I had picked Minecraft when I could have picked pretty much anything else—anything else would have killed my cheap laptop.\n\nA noise from outside wormed its way through my headphones. It was just on the edge of familiarity and it grated down my spine.\n\nI froze. Headphones still on, Minecraft cows mooing around me, I tried to place what it had been.\n\nNot able to think of anything that could have caused it and not hearing it again, I went back to my game. It was time to stock up on food before my next cave dive.\n\nAmidst the death sounds of the many cows on my farm, I heard the noise again. Louder this time and lasting longer than before. Enough for me to recognize it as children singing.\n\nMy eyes flicked to the window. Children singing. Children singing outside. Outside where the snow was falling like a heavy blanket over the sidewalks and the small gardens that the school maintained.\n\nI couldn’t see them. The sun had almost completely set and the banks of fallen snow glowed in what dim light remained. The people who had been walking only a few minutes ago were gone with no evidence left to prove they had ever been there. The footprints along the path outside my window had been erased. I pulled my headphones off my head, trying to tell where the noise was coming from, but the snow swallowed all sound outside my window.\n\nIt was weird, but college students do weird things, so I figured it was a prank or something similar and went back to Minecraft.\n\nEverything seemed normal as I continued to play. I finished my preparations for a caving adventure and set out. I didn’t run into a mob for a while, but when I did it was simple to dispatch it and keep gathering resources.\n\nThen I heard the singing again. I slid my headphones off so they hung around my neck. It was closer this time than it had been before. I couldn’t understand the words, but kids were definitely the ones doing it. It lasted a little longer than it had last time before. My heart was beating a rapid tattoo in my chest.\n\nI tried to convince myself that it was fine. Kids came to campus a lot, usually on tours to see what college was like. *But never after sundown*, my traitorous brain reminded me.\n\nI practically had a heart attack when a zombie hit me in game. The noise shattered the silence even though I wasn’t wearing my headphones. I killed it quickly.\n\nCloser still, the kids started singing again.\n\nMy breaths were coming fast. I tried to slow them down so I could hear better, but the air only jolted past my teeth instead.\n\nTrembling, I slipped over to the window. I looked out, and even though I didn’t want to, I scanned everything in eyeshot to find those stupid kids. My eyes lingered on the dark shadows behind the buildings where the street lights didn’t quite reach. My whole body was tense as I half expected something to jump out at me.\n\nI slammed the window closed and wrenched the blinds closed. I couldn’t see out now—perhaps not the best idea for someone living on the first floor—but more importantly, no one else could see in. Shaken, I sat back down in my chair. I strained my ears, trying to hear anything else and desperately hoping I wouldn’t.\n\nTime slipped by. It felt like hours. The whole time I stared at the closed blinds as if something would come through the window if I didn’t. Dread boiled in the pit of my stomach. I had almost convinced myself that whatever it had been was over now and I could go back to playing when I heard the scream.\n\nI found my eyes flicked back to my computer where they were met with the “You died!” screen.\n\nIt took me a while to calm down after that. Even after I closed the game and was trying to sleep, I found myself still tense, watching the blinds covering the window.\n\nThe next day, with the sun high in the sky, I tried to play again. The main menu screen had just loaded when I heard someone pounding on my door. Full on banging. The sort of knocking you’d hear when a government agency comes to catch you out for doing something illegal.\n\nI ALT F4-ed the game, ripped out the flash drive. As I crossed the room, I wiped my sweaty hands on my pants. But when I opened the door there was no one there.\n\nThe same day I deleted any files related to Minecraft off my computer and brought the flashdrive to Calvin.\n\n“I don’t want it anymore,” I said. “You can have it.”\n\nHe frowned, eyes glazed over from the weed I could smell on him. “Ok?”\n\n“Here,” I shoved the flashdrive at him. “Take it.”\n\n“You don’t know how to delete something off a flashdrive?” he asked with a laugh.\n\n“Just keep it,” I said. “Keep it contained.”\n\nHe gave a look like I was the crazy one, but he took the drive from me and let me go without another word.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the week after I got rid of it, I never experienced anything like that again.\n\nUntil this morning when my roommate told me that he’d managed to get some new high-end game that he’d been waiting for from Calvin for free. I tried to ignore it.\n\nBut I’ve been hearing the singing all day. Now, I’m sitting in the library, only a few buildings away from our dorm, and I can tell its getting closer and closer.",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Are you going to attend the funeral, Kate?”  \n\n\nI would hear this question asked a lot, but answering honestly every time made me too sad so I rarely did. My coworker and best friend Evelyn killed herself and nobody saw it coming. She was bubbly and ditzy, running around doing everything and anything she wanted with the warmest smile you’ve ever seen. Being the only other girl who worked with her we became quick friends and I used to think I knew her pretty well. I guess not.  \n\n\nI wasn’t going to attend her funeral, I felt too betrayed and heartbroken to take it. She was so sweet and seemed so happy all the time. The days leading up to her death she began looking tired and would jump at every little noise, I tried asking her what was going on but she always dismissed my worries with that glowing smile of hers. She didn’t deserve this. I didn’t deserve this.  \n\n\nThe night after her death I had a horrible nightmare. I was inside my room, looking down on myself sleeping. The air smelled horrible, so bad it made my eyes water. I couldn’t move or scream, it felt like I was paralyzed in empty space. I choked on every breath and before I woke up, I saw a glimpse of some figure in my bedroom corner. I only saw its feet at first, pure white bony feet with sharp claws digging into my carpet. Then, in my last moment in the dream, I saw its eyes glowing through the shade. It was looking right at me, the real me in the bed.  \n\n\nI jolted awake in a cold sweat. In a panic I threw my covers up to my neck and stared at the corner where the figure was, but there was nothing, just an empty shadow casted by moonlight. I rolled over, threw the blanket over my head and tried to calm myself down. I pulled out my phone and looked at the time. It was 3:50am. I didn’t sleep a wink the whole rest of the night. I tried so hard, tossing and turning every few minutes, the night dragged on forever and nothing I tried worked. I stayed up until sunrise.  \n\n\nI was so groggy. Half awake but unable to sleep. I know that I should have stayed home but I went into work like everything was normal, it was all I could think of to do with myself. I just felt like I had to get away from being home alone with my thoughts, but looking back on it now I wish I didn’t. I spent most of the day trying to keep myself together between crying sessions in the bathroom. Evelyn’s funeral was scheduled for next week and all anyone talked about was what I was doing and how I was feeling. I couldn’t stand it, so I went home.  \n\n\nI walked home from work. I live decently close to my job but it’s still a long walk so I usually car pool with some coworkers, obviously they were working so I was left walking. On my way back I smelled that horrid stench again. I quickly covered my mouth and nose and looked around. Where was that disgusting smell coming from? Just then a shape jumped behind a tree near the road, I stopped in my tracks and kept my eyes trained in its direction. Glowing eyes stared back at me from the shade of the tree. A fleshless leg, made purely of twisted bone peaked around the base of the tree, along with a bone arm wrapped around the trunk. A waft of hot air and pure stench blasted into me as I made eye contact. I heard a screaming voice rip into my head, straight into my mind.  \n\n\n“RUN TO DIE, FLEE TO FALL, YOU CAN NOT RUN, YOU CAN NOT HIDE!” It said  \n\n\nI fell backwards, the screaming in my head just kept repeating over and over, so loud I couldn’t even hear my own screams, I balled up onto the sidewalk and hid in my hands, I couldn’t get away. That’s when someone grabbed my arm and spun me around. I swung around panicked arms to flail helplessly at whoever grabbed me until I realized it was my boss. He found my phone at my locker, ran after me to give it back and just found me rolling on the sidewalk. I cried in his arms, the screams had stopped but the feelings in my head were still there.  \n\n\nI stuttered over the words I tried to get out as an explanation for why I was crying on the sidewalk in the fetal position. I couldn’t even believe my own story so how was he supposed to? Panic attack is all I managed to say to him at first, and given his reaction I'm assuming that would have been the explanation he would have come up with himself if I hadn't said anything. He walked me the rest of the way home, the whole time I insisted I was ok and I’ll be fine. He told me that I should take the next few days off to collect myself and instead of telling him I was fine for the 10th time, I thanked him as he left. I even started to believe my own story. The last time I saw that bony monster was in a nightmare so I guess it made sense. It just felt so real it tortured me the rest of the day.  \n\n\nWhen night fell I crawled into bed, I was definitely looking forward to a long nights rest. I left every light on in the house and closed my bedroom door. That bony nightmare was ingrained in my head so this was the only way I could feel safe. I spent hours awake in that bed, I was so exhausted I could barely keep my eyes open but I just wouldn’t sleep. I spent the whole night just begging to be unconscious for at least five minutes, I’d do anything, but it never came. After what felt like an eternity the sun rose and I gave up.  \n\n\nI could hardly move I was so tired. I spent the last night and a half without so much as a wink of sleep. Everything ached, my eyes and head hurt, I barely even had enough energy to get dressed. I just slumped onto the floor in the kitchen with a bowl of cereal. I ate a few spoonful's and flipped through my phone. I read a few texts asking if I was doing alright but I didn’t respond, I didn’t have the energy to. I saw a few posts about Evelyn’s funeral and what to wear/bring. Everything on that damn phone was depressing.  \n\n\nThen I noticed my cereal started to taste really bad, like rancid. I spit out whatever was left in my mouth I looked down into the bowl but everything looked fine. The problem wasn’t the cereal, it was the air. The whole room reeked of that horrible rotten smell. I jumped up on my feet, I could feel panic run down my spine and sweat drip from my forehead. I didn’t move a single muscle, my heart raced in my chest. I felt a hot breath leave sticky droplets of humidity on the back of my neck. It was here.  \n\n\nIt wasn’t a panic attack, it was real, the voice in my head was actually real. I turned around slowly, barely keeping myself from vomiting both out of fear and the smell. When I fully turned around I came face to face with those glowing eyes from before. A massive skeletal creature stood in my kitchen, so tall it ducked under the ceiling. Twisted bones, jagged and sharp, stuck out everywhere like bent nails from its limbs and chest. Its head was made of a massive jaw bone with a jagged jigsaw of bone matter all around, its eyes were placed inside the pit of its throat. It let out an indescribably horrible stench from its mouth and I heard a scream in my head.  \n\n\n“RUN TO DIE, FLEE TO FALL, YOU CAN NOT RUN, YOU CAN NOT HIDE!” It said again  \n\n\nI passed out, be it from the stench or the fear, I just couldn’t take it. It was too much. Then I was outside of my body again. I looked down from the ceiling at me on the floor. The creature was still there, reaching out its hand, getting closer and closer to my unconscious body. I tried to scream and thrash with all my might but I was frozen. All I could do is watch as I get eaten or worse. The monsters hand touches my head and a stream of light comes out of me. The creature pulls on this light like a string and shoves it into his mouth. It just keeps pulling and pulling, grabbing fist fulls of this stream of light and devouring it.  \n\n\nThe next thing I remember is waking up on the floor of my kitchen, covered in cereal. My head throbbed like someone was drilling my skull from the inside. I didn’t have the energy to move even my fingers, I just lied there unsure if I want to even keep living. I was at my limit, I’d hoped I would just die here on the kitchen floor so I wouldn’t have to get up. At least that way, I would be able to sleep, even if it was forever.  \n\n\nSomehow I pooled every last ounce of my strength to get up off the floor. I waddled over to the drawer in my kitchen with my knives in it. I pulled out the biggest kitchen knife I owned and then fell back to the floor. I sat up against a cabinet and placed the knife to my own wrist. This would be the end of this nightmare, I would bleed out here and die, I could finally get some rest. I pressed down, my hand wouldn’t stop shaking. I started crying and whimpering, trying to force my brain to just jab town into my wrist and this could all be over but I just couldn’t do it.  \n\n\nTears streamed down my cheeks, I pulled the knife up and away from me revealing that I did manage to cut myself a tiny bit, small drops of blood ran down the side of my wrist and fell to the floor. I raised the knife up, this time I wouldn’t give myself time to get psyched out. I clenched my teeth and brought the knife down hard towards my wrist, but suddenly I stopped, the knife only inches from my wrist. In that moment I thought of Evelyn. The realization hit me like a wave of calm. She was the nicest person who I’ve ever met, like a sister to me. She came to me with all her problems, wether it was her shitty dad or some boy she liked, she always came to me. That was, unless she didn’t think I’d believe her.  \n\n\nThis fucking bone monster killed her, the same way it almost killed me. It sucked every ounce of my joy and comfort, driving every last fiber of my being into suicide in a way that made me feel like no one could help. A rage pushed out all other feelings in my head. How fucking dare that thing torture my friend. I gripped the knife so hard my knuckles went white. I stood up, the fire of rage gifting me new found strength. I made my way back into my bedroom. Even though every joint in my body ached and my head split from the pain, in that moment nothing could stop me. I sat cross legged on my bed, knife in hand. All that was left to do was wait.  \n\n\nI sat there for hours, shifting and leaning on blankets and pillows trying to find at least one position that alleviated the pain even for a second but never letting go of the knife. The day dragged on, I practically watched sun beams crawl across my floor, but it didn’t matter. The fire was still lit in me. I would end this nightmare or die trying.  \n\n\nNight came, and just like before no matter how tired I got I wouldn’t sleep for a second, not even by accident. It was like I was being forced awake by something. My body desperately tries to fall asleep but it’s just not able to. I’m forced to watch the hours tick by on an endless cycle of crying and screaming at the monster to come out. I rested my head for a second on my pillow, I thought about what would happen if it never came back, if it hid in the shadows forever and starved me of sleep till I died. I was so weak now there’s no way I could search for it, I would just suffer to death. I pulled out my phone and looked at the time for the thousandth time. It was 3:50am  \n\n\nThe floor creaked a bit, I quickly turned my head. I sat up and scanned the room, nothing was out of place. I breathed deep in through my nose to try and catch its scent. A wave of heat rushed down from the ceiling and with it came that familiar stench. I propped myself up unto my knees, my hands shook so bad I could hardly feel them. My bedroom door creaked open slowly, bony fingers creeped around the edge of the door on all sides, scratching at the wood. The door opens fully, those glowing eyes stare at me out of a looming dark shape from the center of my doorway. It steps into my room with a thump, the floorboards sound like they might break. I started hyperventilating, my hand drenched with sweat as I gripped the knife. It steps into the room and with it an air of dread stagnates every inch of space. The screams force their way into my head once again.  \n\n\n“RUN TO DIE, FLEE TO FALL, YOU CAN NOT RUN, YOU CAN NOT HIDE!” It said for the final time.  \n\n\nDon’t worry you fucking freak, I’m definitely not running. I stood up on my bed, red hot blood was running through my veins. All of my sadness, all of my pain, all of my grief, all of it just erupted out of me. I screamed like a mad woman and leapt off the bed wielding the knife while stabbing wildly. To my surprise the creature actually backed off, it stumbled backwards out into the hall. I bring down the knife hard on its bony arm and my knife shatters into pieces.  \n\n\nI didn’t even care. I tossed the knife and just started throwing my arms at it. It let out an ear piercing wale as every single blow from my fists blasted bone matter into dust. I wasn’t even hitting it that hard, it just fell apart with my touch. The screams that once entered my head by force were now complete gibberish and desperate to find a way out of my skull. One of my blows knocked the creature to the floor and I jumped on top. I launched my fist as hard as I could directly into those fucking eyes that tormented me, that tormented Evelyn to death. It's eyes went dark, the screaming both inside my head and out had stopped. I just kept wailing on its shattering pieces, screaming and crying the whole time. Eventually nothing was left but dust and I just sat there balling in a pile of rubble until I passed out.  \n\n\nI woke up 16 hours later. I finally slept and I had a lot to recover from so it took longer than the usual nights rest. The floor still had bits of bone dust all over it. I was covered head to toe in ash and dried cereal. I just started laughing, I couldn’t believe it, I just couldn’t. I survived, more than that I won! I just didn’t think for even a second that my attack strategy would work. I got up off the floor and made my way to the bathroom. I dumped my clothes onto the bathroom tile and just sat on the shower floor while hot water poured over me. The water stung on my wrist, I lifted it up and looked at the small cut I’d made there. I welled up a little bit as I looked at the red line of dried blood along my wrist. I’m so glad I didn’t do it. Thank you Evelyn.  \n\n\nI realized now as I write this what must have happened to me on that day in the kitchen. That bony fuck must have eaten all of the light that was left in me while I lied on that kitchen floor. Every good memory or feeling of comfort I had left was pulled out until I was nothing but an empty shell of pain and suicidal thoughts. The only reason I was able to hold onto the thought of Evelyn is because her memory was tainted by the sadness of her death. I feel a pain in my chest, deep inside me that I don’t want to admit is me being glad the monster didn’t come for me first. I’ll carry that pain with me for the rest of my life. The thought of Evelyn in that bath, emptied of everything but pain, is a permanent scar in my head.  \n\n\nLater that week I did decide to attend her funeral. She was my friend, her image came to me in my lowest moment and felt like I needed to see her one last time, even if it hurt. I was surrounded by her family particularly her mother. We talked about Evelyn and her antics. I told her some stories about us at work and the stuff we did. She started crying, Evelyn’s father came over to comfort her. I met Evelyn’s older brother too. He didn’t want to show it but I could tell he was holding back tears as best he could. It was from him that I found out that Evelyn died from slashing her own wrists in the bath. Hearing that made it even harder to keep myself together. I made my way over to her casket, and put my hand on the top of it. A tiny drop of blood trickled down my injured wrist and landed in a tiny pool on the lid. The darkness came for me and instead of letting it consume me I fought back. It was because of you Evelyn that I won. I let myself cry one last time, right after saying my final goodbye.  \n\n\n“Don’t worry Evelyn, I got him”",

        "text": "I clicked off my bedside lampshade and got ready to scroll through Reddit until I fell asleep. I laughed at the first humorous post I saw.\n\n“Fucking dork.” I heard a familiar voice whisper from somewhere eerily close to me.  I quickly reached over and turned on my lamp, illuminating the view of my roommate setting down the glass of water I had just gotten. \n\n“What the fuck is wrong with you?” I asked. We had only moved into this apartment two weeks ago, and we hadn’t spoken to each other much except for the occasional small talk. \n\n“Calm down dude. This is why you’re still single at 27, you’re always so tense. Chill the fuck out.” My roommate responded.\n\nAt this point I was ticked off. \n\n“What do you want?” I asked him.\n\n“Just saying goodnight.” he replied just as a smirk formed on his face\n\nHe left the room and I got up to close and lock my door. I was already considering  moving  out  because of his sheer laziness and lack of picking up after himself, and this action only made me consider it more. I sat down on my bed and reached for my glass of water, as I put the glass to my lips I instantly noticed that something smelled very off, like chemicals.I took my lips off of the glass and examined the water. A white cloudy substance was clearly visible.\n\n*Did this motherfucker drug my water?*\n\nAnger enveloped me and I got out of my bed and entered my roommate's room to confront him.\n\n“What the fuck did you do to my water?” I asked him. \n\nHe laughed before stating: “I didn't do anything to your water. If you’re wondering why it's cloudy it's because the pipes in our area have been acting up lately.”\n\nI left his room without saying anything. I knew damn well he did something to my water but I was too tired to care. I had already made my mind up, I was going to move out by next week with no notice. I smiled at the idea of him struggling to pay rent each month. His only source of income is “Borrowing” money from his scumbag friends he constantly brings over, and selling bagged oregano  to middle school kids. \n\nI entered my room and locked my door once again. I grabbed my water and poured it down my bathroom sink. I thoroughly washed it with soap and water before filling it up once again. My suspicion that he had done something to my water had  grown  when I examined my new glass of water and saw that it was perfectly clear. I set my water down and sat on my bed. I scrolled online looking for other places to move to, but until then I planned to stay at my moms house for a few weeks.  \n\nI awoke the next morning to the uncomfortable and shocking sensation of water and not being able to breathe. I opened my eyes and was met with the view of my roommate placing down a  bucket of water and taking a rag off of my face. I was in total and utter shock, I felt completely violated and I struggled to breathe. I gasped for air as he pulled out his smartphone and started recording for me. He started laughing so hard his face turned bright red. \n\n“DID YOU WATERBOARD ME?!” I screamed in pure rage once I had caught my breath enough.\n\n“Look how mad you are! Your face is Priceless!” he replied and then continued to laugh.\n\nPure fury overtook me. I screamed and charged at him, knocking him down. I relentlessly and brutally punched his face until he was nearly  unconscious.   \n\nI turned to face my door and saw that  he had carved out a hole as a means to bypass me locking it.\n\n“WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU?” I screamed at him.\n\n“Just… a.. Prank..” he replied in mumbles, fading in and out  of consciousness. \n\nI had made a new decision. I was no longer moving out next week, I was moving out right then and there. I stood up and left him on the floor. I sent a quick and shaky text to my mom, something along the lines of: \n\n“Hey, I need to crash at your place for a bit. My roommate is fucking crazy.”\n\nI packed up everything I needed within an hour. I walked to the front door to leave the apartment, which is right next to my roommates room. I placed my hand on the doorknob but stopped when I was hit with the most rancid, putrid, and overpowering smell I had experienced in my lifetime.  I placed my suitcase down and decided to do a little snooping. He was unconscious in the other room, after all. I entered his room and gagged, I had to place my fingers over my nose  to not be sick. \n\nI looked at his nightstand and saw multiple packs of white pills. I picked it up and read the name:\n\n“Rohypnol”\n\nI pulled out my smartphone and was in the midst of searching up the name when I was suddenly assaulted in the back of the head.\n\n“Augh!” I screamed.\n\nI turned around and my eyes met my disgruntled roommate looking furious.\n\n“Get.. out of my room!” he mumbled angrily.\n\nI laughed and pushed him to the ground.\n\n“Fuck off!” I yelled as I left the apartment with all of my things. \n\nI was still in a little bit of shock from being woken up to what could have very well been a murder attempt covered up as a prank. After 3 hours of a long and reflective drive, I arrived at my mothers house. She  welcomed me and gave me her condolences about my roommate when I explained to her what he had done.  I spent the rest of the day catching up with my mother and being grateful I wasn't in the same apartment as my psychotic  roommate. \n\nThe clock rolled around to 10:00 PM, and I was feeling sleepy. I opened the door to my childhood bedroom and was overwhelmed with nostalgia. I jumped onto my bed and closed my eyes. My mind began to race with anger from this mornings and last night's incidents, making it hard to fall asleep. After hours of trying to fall asleep, I called it quits. I opened my eyes and grabbed my smartphone from my nightstand. I was going to get some petty revenge on my roommate. I went to the DEA website and filled out the form, tipping them off about his illegal sales of “Marijuana” to middle school children.  \n\nI imagined him trying to explain to law enforcement that he was only selling oregano, the thought made me smile with amusement.  My revenge left me feeling satisfied, and I was able to fall asleep. \n\nMy slumber unfortunately didn't last long, as I woke up to footsteps in the hallway. I instantly became paranoid, thinking I was still at the apartment in my half asleep-half awake state. I calmed down slightly when I remembered the fact I was at my mothers house, but I was still a little bit concerned about the footsteps.\n\n“Mom?” I called out.\n\nThere was no answer.\n\n“Mom is that you?” I called out once again. \n\nThere was still no answer, and this time I noticed the footsteps getting faster and closer.\n\nI could recognize my mothers footsteps,  and these certainly were not hers.  \n\n“Shit!” I mumbled to myself just before throwing off my blankets and getting out of bed. I ran to the bedroom door and closed it shut. It didn't have a lock, so I pressed my body against it. Soon enough, the door knob began to rattle rapidly.  I gasped from fear.\n\n“Mark, I know you’re in there.” My roommate said with a chuckle just before starting to bang on the door. I was  struggling to keep the door closed with my body.\n\n“Carlos? Are you mentally insane? What the *hell* are you doing in my moms fucking house!” \n\n“Do you remember when you got a notification that an air tag was found near you when you first moved in?” Carlos replied.\n\nMy stomach sank. I remembered the notification well, but I brushed it off at the time.\n\n“You put it in my car.” I replied shakily.\n\n“Ding, Ding, Ding!” Carlos replied to my realization. \n\nCarlos continued to try and open the door while I tried to press my body into it as much as I could.\n\n“MOM!!! CALL THE POLICE!” I screamed just before beginning to cry. \n\n“You can scream for her as much as you want, but she won’t hear you.” Carlos stated in a nonchalant tone.\n\nMy world went quiet. At that moment it had become obvious that he had done something to my mother.  \n\n“*WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO TO MY MOTHER?!”* I screamed at the top of my lungs  in absolute rage and fury. \n\nCarlos replied silently by stopping his attempts to open the door, it was clear my scream had startled him a great amount.  \n\nI decided to try and take advantage of his stunned state. I opened the door and was ready to attack, but I quickly ducked down when I saw the gun he was holding. I instinctively ducked, and immediately after he pulled the trigger and a bullet shot out of the gun right where my head was just a milliseconds ago. I kicked him hard in his privates, causing him to drop the gun.  I reached for the gun, but so did he. We both had our grip on the gun, his hand was  on the trigger, and mine on the muzzle. He pulled the trigger and my hand was shot by the bullet.  \n\n“*AUGHHH*” I screamed, the adrenaline didn’t allow me to feel the physical pain just yet, but the knowledge that I had just been shot was enough to make me yelp. I could see he was about to take advantage of my vulnerable state, so I didn't let him. I grabbed his hand and  turned the gun so the muzzle was facing his face. I managed to pull the trigger and his shoulder got shot.  The sound of the gun made me recoil and lose my grip on him. He started to scream and yell profanities at me while running away. I heard the door open and close. I ran to the front door and saw there was a hole carved into it as well. \n\n“Damn it!” I grunted. The pain from my gunshot wound was kicking in. I went back into my room and took off my shirt. I tied a tourniquet  around the wound and applied pressure.  I walked to my nightstand and picked up my Smartphone. I dialed 911 and explained the incident to them.  While waiting for help to arrive, I went into my mothers room and saw that she was  fast asleep in bed. I turned on the lights and luckily didn't see any signs of death. I checked if she had a pulse and was breathing, and I took a sigh of relief when the answer was affirmative. I turned to face the water on her nightstand.\n\nIt was only half full and a cloudy white substance was visible. It was obvious that he drugged my mother with the same thing I had attempted to drug me with the previous night. Shivers ran through me when I realized he must have been in the house for a while before he  made his move. He was waiting for my mother to drink the water he had drugged so she couldn't be of any help in the situation.  Within  a few minutes officers arrived at my home. I was taken to the emergency room in an ambulance. I was in the hospital for 2 days, they determined the shot did not hit any nerves or cause fracturing. During my stay they mainly just ran some tests and gave me pain medication. My mother visited me and was by my side during my stay. I profusely apologized to her for how i put her in danger by going to her home. \n\nShe of course told me that it wasn’t my fault and I had nothing to be sorry for, but I couldn't help but believe otherwise. I was sent home and the police explained they would have cars patrolling the neighborhood as Carlos had still not been found.  I was happy to hear that, it made me feel the tiniest bit safer in a place I was already supposed to be safe in. Eventually it was 12:00 am and I couldn't fall asleep.  I was filled with paranoia, it felt like I was hearing his footsteps every minute. Eventually I got tired of my mind racing and knew that I had to do something to get my mind off of things. I settled on a late night trip to the convenience store to get some melatonin and a light snack. I got out of bed and entered my car. I placed the keys in the ignition and began to drive. \n\nAfter a few minutes of driving, I had arrived at my destination. I stepped out of my vehicle and entered the store. Anxiety and fear ran through me when I saw who was in the checkout line. It was Carlos. I tried to make a sneaky getaway  by quietly going into the first aisle, but it was too late; he had already seen me.  I began to have what felt like a PTSD panic attack. The painful memories of the incident raced through my mind,  and tears started to stream down my face. When he came into view once more,  my panic attack subsided because I knew that he was coming towards me and my body went into survival mode. I instantly ran to the other aisle and made an exit through the store from the end of it. I ran for my car like my life depended on it, because it did. \n\nThe hairs on my body stood up when he forcefully opened the store doors and ran out. I became confused when I realized he wasn't running towards  me, but he was running to his car. I quickly realized what his plan was and entered my car. I shakily and quickly put the keys in the ignition and slammed on the gas. I was driving 60 over the speed limit and he was right on my tail. My old car couldn't go any faster, but his car could. Within seconds his car was right next to mine. I screamed as he swerved his car to the side, trying to run me off the road. \n\nI quickly realized that going off the road on my own terms would be more ideal than his car slamming into mine and forcibly pushing me  off of the road. I slowed down and pulled over to the side of the road. I expected him to get out of the car, but instead I saw his car reversing as far back as he could. I realized that he was planning to ram into my car as fast as he could. As his car  began to drive forward at a fast speed, I quickly opened my door and leaped in front of the car. I fell down on the ground stomach first and then immediately heard his car impact mine. \n\nMy heart began to beat rapidly and adrenaline surged through me. I knew that the impact must have harmed him at least a little bit too, so I knew I needed to take my chance to get away when he was vulnerable. I ran into the forest  that surrounded each side of the woods. 30 seconds into running I heard him exit his car and start running towards me. I turned around and was bewildered by how fast he could run. I turned back around and picked up my pace to the fastest I could physically run. I decided that running wasn’t going to get me away from this guy. I was going to have to fight back.  I stopped in my tracks and quickly picked up a large tree branch. He was about to charge me down but I stopped him  by banging his head with the tree branch. He quickly fell  what I thought was unconscious and I booked it out of the woods, and into the street. I ran fast. \n\nAfter a few minutes of running I reached my house. I pushed open the door and ran inside. I caught my breath for a minute and then dialed 911.\n\nThrough shaky breaths I explained the incident to them in detail.\n\n“Okay sir, we will send officers to the location of Carlos and to-” the operator started, but was cut off by the sound of breaking glass. I dropped the phone out of fear.  Suddenly, I heard my mother shriek in fear, and just as suddenly, I heard a gunshot.  I ran to my mothers room and stared in complete fear and shock at the gunshot wound on her forehead.  I turned and saw Carlos jump out of the window. I followed him out and pinned him down from behind. He shot his gun to the side and in the air a few times until he had no more bullets to shoot. He began to hysterically scream and cry, but I kept my pin on him, I needed to avenge my mother.  After a while of pinning him down, I heard police sirens in the distance grow closer and closer, until 3 cop cars were in my driveway.  The police immediately saw that I had pinned him down and ran over to me. They told me that they could take it from here and arrest him. As they arrested him, I explained that he had just murdered my mother.\n\n“HE'S *LYING!”* Carlos yelled in distress.\n\nNo one replied, and I watched as he  was taken to the back of a police vehicle while continuing to scream and cry. \n\nThe realization that my mother was now deceased hit me, and  hot tears rolled down my face. I stood there, frozen and silently sobbing. \n\nThe next few hours were a blur. I  remember my brother coming and taking me back to stay at his place, sleeping, or at least trying to  sleep on his sofa. \n\nIt has been 2 days since my mothers death. My brother and I are extremely sad and heart broken. I am constantly paranoid and on edge. I am now sitting on my brother's couch and writing this as a way to get it all out.  I am going to seek therapy for this absolutely traumatic event in my life.",

        "text": "“Hold on babe, I’ve just gotta run by the ATM before we pay,” I said. “You can’t just use the card, Jess?” Alexander asked me exasperatedly.  “The card machine said it was out of order when we walked in,” I told him. “Okay, fine. I’ll be over here looking at these wallets while you go,” he replied.\n\nAs I walked down stairs to the designated area for the ATM machine, I noticed a red glow pulsating slowly. When my feet left the bottom step into the dark grey carpet, I felt like I’d left the planet all together. The red light clashed with the white tile on the walls and it felt like I was in a hot box.\n\nSurely the lights aren’t heated… I felt the need to run, go back up into the store and tell Alexander we weren’t buying a damn thing today, but he was already stressed with us relocating for his new job. He was being promoted in the firm and needed a few nicer items for his wardrobe. He’d tell me I was being silly and if I hadn’t wanted to come I should’ve stayed home.\n\nI took a deep breath and started moving forward. I fumbled around in my purse for my wallet. In the muted red light, I managed to find my debit card.\n\nI inserted it with intentions of withdrawing $200. The screen lit up with green letters:\n\n—&gt; withdrawal?\n\n—&gt; deposit?\n\n—&gt; check balance?\n\nI pressed the button by withdrawal.\n\n—&gt; amount?\n\nThe machine questioned as it hummed lightly. I manually put the $200 amount in. I expected it to just give me my money when it did something… peculiar.\n\n—&gt; What will you give me in return?\n\n“What?,” I muttered to myself. I tried to cancel the transaction but this machine just was not giving me my card back. I feel like I pressed every button and it still asked:\n\n—&gt; What will you give me in return?\n\nI banged my fist against the screen. I felt like I was having a bad dream. This was, needless to say, the weirdest thing I’d ever experienced, and one of the most upsetting. How could I give this stupid machine anything? Why was it even asking me this?\n\n“WHAT DO YOU WANT?” I shouted. “Just your soul,” said a airy voice. I looked around frantically and saw no one. “For $200?” I said incredulously. Not that I was going to give whatever the hell this was my soul anyway, but surely it was worth more than $200. “For any amount of money, or anything else you want” it replied.\n\n“No. No, I can’t do that,” I said. “Really? Are you sure?,” it asked. “Yes. I’d like to keep my soul, thank you,” I told it. “Very well then,” it said, while promptly returning my debit card. I quickly grabbed it with shaky hands and ran as fast as I could back up the stairs.\n\nI nearly plowed Alexander down when I reached the top. “Jeez, Jess. Are you alright?,” he asked. “I- I think so,” I told him. I was drenched in sweat so badly my hair was wet. “What happened. I was looking at wallets and before I realized it an hour had passed,” he said. “The ATM is broken. It was so hot down there. I didn’t want to come back without money but it wouldn’t give me my card back for awhile…,” I trailed off.\n\n“Don’t worry, Jess. I’ll get them to hold the clothes and we’ll go down to the bank drive through, okay?” he assured me. It seemed like he was a million miles away. I nodded weakly and let him walk me to the car. The cool air outside giving me a chill.\n\n“Are you sure nothing else happened?,” he questioned. “Yeah, it was just so hot. I think maybe I got a little dehydrated,” I said with a faint smile. Alexander got the money then ran me through the drive through for a drink.\n\nWhile he went inside to pay for his clothes, I  sat in the car wondering what the hell had just happened to me. Had a ATM really asked me for my soul? Either way I knew I could never tell Alexander. He’d think I was crazy. He was one of those people that didn’t believe anything he didn’t see with his own eyes.\n\nIt’s been about a year and the thought of my experience still makes me uncomfortable. I don’t even like going to that store anymore, and I haven’t until just recently. What was strange when I went in is that there wasn’t even a stairwell there, no signs that there was an ATM, and that none of the staff even knew what I was talking about when I asked what happened to the ATM room downstairs.",

        "text": "  \n\nI don’t know what is going to happen next so I have decided to write it down fast and post it here so at least someone would know. I am sitting in my flat being afraid to look out of the window. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt started five months ago. I was coming back home quite late when I noticed that someone is following me. It was after midnight, streets were quite empty. While I was still on the big street I have decided not to turn right, on the small dark street that lead to my house. Luckely, there was a woman waiting for the traffic light to let her go and I joined her. The person kept going in the direction of my flat. \n\nAfter a while I reassured myself that it was just my imagination and decided to go home. I passed through this small street and was already on my street, three minutes from my house, when I have realized that the person came back and kept following me. I have stopped right under the streetlight, trying to call my boyfriend. As it was already middle of November it was quite cold outside, the phone didn’t work properly. The person approached me.\n\nI was already scared. Trying to come up with an idea what I should do. Now I could see him. The tall athletic guy, looking nothing but the average local person in his late 20-s. I still had drops of hope. \n\n\\-Are you going home? – he asked with a soft smile. \n\n\\-Yes, I do. \n\n\\-I know this is your house, - he pointed right at the entrance door of my block of flats, - Let’s go, I will go with you. \n\nThe fear grabbed me. I lived in the block of flats, where only third of apartments was actually inhabited and my neighbours worked night shifts. I lived on the top floor. It was obviously dangerous to go there. I decided to stay outside as long as possible. \n\n\\-No, sorry, I am waiting for my father, he is on the way to pick me up. – I tried to say something to win the time. \n\n\\-Father… All of you always say like that. Do you know why I was following you? -he asked. The blood in my veins froze. \n\n\\-No. Please go away you are scaring me, - I felt how hysteria slowly capturing me. \n\n\\-I was following you because I couldn't help it. I will do it anyway; we will do it anyway. You cannot escape.\n\nAt this moment I have realized that I am fucked. I started to move back, but he tried to stop me. First he tried to take of my phone, after it keep my by my scarf and unbutton my coat. Luckily, I have managed to run away. The police office nearby was closed to I was already desperately crying when I have seen a couple. I asked them to walk me home. Those night I couldn’t sleep. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next day I have decided go to the police and report the case. Of course, they didn’t want to file the report, because I didn’t know the guy and there were any evidences of attack. But finally I mad the police officer to write down everything that has happened to me. When I was describing the perpetrator I have remembered strange tattoo that I have seen in the street light on his neck. It was on the right side of the neck, very thin curved line. It could be a snake, but I couldn’t see neither head nor tail. \n\nI was standing outside of the police office smoking while the same police officer came outside. I didn’t have my glasses with me, but he also had something on his neck. I was sure I am going mad and decided to go home to rest. \n\nIn the next two months I was called to come to the police office several times. The whole process was quite exhausting, and I already regret I reported it. There was not any progress in the case anyway. After another interview with the police, I stopped by the supermarket. I was standing and choosing snacks, when I have realised that there was a total silence in the building. I looked around. Everyone was standing still watching me. I slowly started mowing to the checkout. Everyone was following me with their eyes. The cashier didn’t talk to me, just looked straight in the eyes. And this is when I have noticed it. The lady turned left for a moment and I have recognized the same tattoo on her neck. Only this one was a bit thicker. \n\nIt literally freaked me out and I ran out from the shop. If before I was reassuring myself that I was still in shock when I have seen policeman’s neck, now there were no any excuses. I moved in to this district of the city two months before the attack has happened, is it possible I do not know something? From this moment I started to search. I went to the city archives, but it was unsuccessful. I tried to meet with local historian, who wasn’t in the city for more than a year so I couldn’t reach him. \n\nMeanwhile I started to pay attention to the people that I see around me. Old lady walking her dog, bartender in nearest pub, postwoman – I saw these tattoos more often. My assumption was probably it was kind of local community or something like this, and that is why they do not want to investigate what happened to me. They were trying to protect the guy, what actually pissed me off. Since than I have bought a pepper spray and didn’t come back home late or at least not alone. In a while I let it go and tried not to think about it, even though sometimes to see this tattoo again was quite disturbing for me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce I was sitting in the café studying. A lady approached me and gave me the book. \n\n\\-I am so sorry, do not understand me wrong. My name is Lea, I am working in the archive. I have seen you there some time ago. You looked worried. I couldn’t stand checking your requests in the archive. I think, I found what you need. I can’t tell you more, I am sorry. – said the lady and left. \n\nFirst, I was quite irritated by the fact that I was watched. I was more irritated by the fact that person confessed. But in a second, I have seen the book she gave me. The book was very old, and its cover was almost totally damaged. In the book I found a map of the approximate territories of our city. In the map there was a bog forest that surrounded land of my district. Now we do not have even tenth part of the trees. \n\nAfter several days of my attempts to identify what was written in these old pages the whole picture started to be clear. I was right about the community. But according to the book, it was quite old association that was established first to protect. I couldn’t understand to protect what or whom, but what I have got that they have rich culture with various rituals and tradition. \n\nOut of sudden strange things started to happen in my place. Once I have noticed cigarette butt in my ashtray. Butt of kind of cigarettes that I do not know. Also during the night, I started to hear strange sounds in my flat. I usually sleep with closed door to my bedroom. Sounds felt like someone in my apartment. The sound of footsteps, like someone put something on the table, falling things. \n\nMy house is pretty old, so you never can say whether sounds are coming from the neighbours. Sometimes even started to hear whispering and quite voices. After a while I became very scared, my anxiety started to be too annoying and disturbing my daily routine. I didn’t sleep almost at all and was easy to be triggered. I decided to stop it. \n\nOne evening when I was going to sleep I took my pepper spray and kitchen knife with me. I closed the door to my bedroom inside. I have decided to check if someone is in the flat of I hear the noise tonight. And I did. \n\nI woke up in the middle of the night again, hearing strange noises that were coming from the kitchen. The door from my bedroom is leading right to the kitchen. I slowly moved to the door. The light outside of the bedroom was off. But the voices more and more sounded like they were coming right from my kitchen. They were more whispers than voices. I decided to look at the keyhole. \n\nThere was a window right next to the door so part of the corridor was partly lightened by the moonlight. Suddenly something long and black moved across the room. I have realized than my worst fears were true. I was not alone. \n\nI tried to call the police, but no one picked up. I was calling directly to the police office in our district, that was probably a mistake. I was so scared that it gave me the courage. I rook the pepper spray and the knife and decided to open the door. \n\nThere was no one in my kitchen. I decided to check out the staircase. We have move detectors that turn on the light if there is someone moving in the space. I opened the keyhole and for a moment saw the same black thing. It was ruching downstairs. Now I could see it better. It was a black cloak with sharp standing hood. It was moving so smooth as if it didn’t have legs but levitated. \n\nI was freaked out. \n\nI ran to the window and looked out of it. I will never forget what I have seen. They were standing there watching me. Many of them. There were people standing outside of my house, watching right at my window. All of them wore the same cloaks. The looked just like black entities who looked right through me.\n\nI immediately called my friend. I was afraid to look outside of the window so I do not know what happened to the people next, but when she came they were already gone. We packed fast and left. I moved to her place for a month. I worked a lot with my psychiatrist to live it through. And after a whole both of us agreed that I had awful level of anxiety and it could be just my nerves that were playing a bad game with me. I decided to come back home. At least for one night. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis morning I came back home. I locked myself in the bedroom, took knife and pepper spray. I already was quite sure that all of it was my imagination after reading the book and I just must be calm. I fall asleep quite fast. \n\nI have heard a noise. I opened my eyes. And I have seen them. \n\nThey were standing around my bed in the circle watching me. The same black cloaks and total silence around. I closed my eyes and screamed. \n\nI don’t know for how long I was screaming, but after some time I switched on the light. There was no one in the room. Aggressively I took pepper spray and ran out of the bedroom. The door from the bedroom was opened. The door from the apartment is open wide, the light in staircase is on. \n\nI rushed to close the door. After quick investigation of the flat I was sure I was alone inside. But when I looked outside of the window, I saw them again. As last time they were standing downstairs and watching me. I am living on the 5th floor, but they definitely watched right at me.\n\nI was trying to call my friends, neighbours, police. Nobody picked up. I decided to post it here. I am sitting in my apartment, while these people are starring at my window. I am afraid. I am just freaked out. If anyone knows anything about this cult, please tell me. I do now know what to do anymore.",

        "text": " It was a dark and stormy night, the kind of night where the wind howled through the trees and lightning lit up the sky. The rain was coming down in sheets, making it nearly impossible to see more than a few feet in front of you. Rachel was driving home from her late shift at the hospital, her windshield wipers working overtime to clear the rain from her view. She was exhausted, and all she could think about was getting home and crawling into bed. As she turned onto the winding road that led to her house, she thought she saw something move in the shadows on the side of the road. She shrugged it off as her imagination playing tricks on her and continued on her way.\n\nBut then, she saw it again. This time, it was closer, and she could clearly make out a figure standing in the bushes. She slowed down, trying to get a better look, but the figure suddenly lunged out into the road in front of her car. Rachel screamed and swerved to avoid hitting the figure, but it was too late. The car careened off the road and into a ditch, coming to a stop with a sickening thud. Rachel's heart was pounding in her chest as she fumbled with the door handle, trying to get out of the car. She finally managed to open the door and stumbled out into the rain.\n\nShe looked around, but the figure was nowhere to be seen. She was alone in the middle of the storm, miles from civilization. She knew she had to get back to her car and get help. But as she turned to make her way back to the car, she saw something that made her blood run cold. The figure was standing just a few feet away from her, its eyes glowing in the darkness. Rachel let out a scream and ran, her legs pumping as fast as they could go. But the figure was right behind her, its breathing ragged and its feet pounding on the ground. Rachel could feel its hot breath on the back of her neck as she pushed herself to run faster. She could see her house in the distance, and she knew that if she could just make it there, she would be safe.\n\nBut just as she was about to reach the front door, the figure grabbed her from behind, pulling her to the ground. Rachel screamed and kicked, trying to fight it off, but it was too strong.As she lay there, struggling for her life, she saw that the figure was not a person at all. It was some sort of creature, its skin pale and its eyes black as night. The creature let out a deafening roar and Rachel felt a sharp pain in her side. She knew she had been injured, but she couldn't focus on that now. All she could think about was getting away. With one last burst of energy, Rachel managed to break free from the creature's grasp and sprinted towards her house. She slammed the front door shut behind her and locked it, her hands shaking with fear.\n\nShe knew she had to call for help, but she didn't know if anyone would believe her story. She didn't even know what the creature was or where it had come from. All she knew was that she had to survive the night, no matter what. As the storm raged outside, Rachel barricaded herself in her house, her ears pricked for any sign of the creature. The night was long and terrifying, but she made it through.  In the morning, she reported the incident to the police, but her story was met with skepticism. There was no evidence of any creature, and the authorities believed that she had simply been involved in a car accident. But Rachel knew that what she had seen was real, and it haunted her for months to come.  She couldn't shake the image of the creature's glowing eyes and the feeling of its hot breath on her neck. She became paranoid, always looking over her shoulder, never feeling truly safe.\n\nShe quit her job, too scared to leave her house, and isolated herself from her friends and family. She was convinced that the creature would come back for her, and she couldn't bear the thought of anyone else getting hurt. Months passed, and the memory of the creature started to fade. Rachel began to think that she had just imagined the whole thing, that it was just a nightmare brought on by the stress of her job and the accident. But then one night, she heard a scratching at her window. She froze, her heart pounding in her chest. She slowly made her way to the window and peered through the blinds, her hands shaking.\n\nThere, staring back at her, was the creature. Its eyes glowing in the darkness, its mouth twisted into a sinister grin. Rachel let out a scream and ran, not looking back until she was miles away from her house, never to return. The creature was never seen again, but the legend of its existence still lingers in the small town where Rachel once lived. And some say, on stormy nights, you can still hear the sound of its hot breath as it searches for its next victim.\n\n[https://youtu.be/70AEHClU\\_o4](https://youtu.be/70AEHClU_o4)",

        "text": "My father and I owned a welding business. We had been working together for 11 years. We never turned down a job, and always made sure the work would last. My father came to me excited about a job he was offered. \"Jeshua! I've got great news!\" He said, making his way to my desk in just a few strides. \"Pack your bags boy! We're going to Alaska!\" My stomach flipped. I hate the cold, but my father had been wanting to go to Alaska since I could remember. I put a smile on and said \"When do we leave?\"\n\nWe arrived a week later. We were given a cabin closest to the sight. \"Now, just so you know the winter months are starting soon. Here's a guide on how to get through them.\" I was a bit confused. I assume she had seen it on my face. \"Our winters run from mid November to late January. The sun does not rise on this side of Alaska for those 60 or so days. This will help you.\" She had a smile that didn't quite reach her eyes. I was shocked. 60 days without the sun. I guess if they can get through them, so can we. \n\nI looked to dad, but he was ecstatic just to be here. I shook my head, giving a small chuckle. Nothing could break that man's spirit. We made our rental arrangements for the snowmobiles, and headed out to the cabin. It was only about a mile away, so we made good time, but the sun was low in the sky. We unloaded our things, and began to wander around the cabin. It was fully furnished, and updated. It was really nice. \n\nThe bedrooms were spacious, and the beds were the most comfortable thing I had ever layed on. \"Shoot we may just buy this place!\" I heard dad say from his room. \"You won't hear a complaint from me!\" I stated back. His happiness was everything to me. I pulled myself off the bed, sighing at the loss of comfort. I went to the kitchen, looking through the cabinets. \"Fully stocked!\" I shouted to my dad. \"Let's eat! I'm starved!\" He said making his way to me. \n\nAs we ate, I decided to look over the folder we received. \"60 days of night, huh.\" I said out loud. \"I've heard of it, but never thought I'd get to experience it.\" He chuckled. I loved seeing him like this. I went back to reading over the papers, passing them to my dad as I finished. I noticed a small envelope that had the word *RULES* printed on thr front. \"Oh boy.\" I said sarcastically. \"There's rules dad, I think you may have picked a bummer.\" I teased, as I opened the envelope. Dad just chuckled, and went back to his plate.  I pulled out a piece of paper and read it out loud. \n\n'Welcome to your cabin. \n\nSince you will be staying with us through the winter months, we have provided rules that must be followed to insure your survival. We have provided 4 freezers each on labeled for the weeks to be used. There is enough food to get you through the winter months.'\n\n\"Survival?!\" I said shocked. \"People come out here, and die son. The cold here is much different than the places we have been. Hypothermia is no laughing matter, and you must be able to see the signs. It probably covers it in there.\" Dad stated, in a serious tone. So I kept reading. \n\n'RULES\n1) NEVER leave without light. \n2)NEVER go out without proper cold weather gear. \n3) Stick to the labels when choosing meats. \n5) ALWAYS keep the spotlights around the home on. There are replacement bulbs in the pantry. \n6)NEVER be outside for more than 10 minutes at a time.\n7) NEVER answer crys for help. No one is out there. \n8) NEVER answer the door. No one is coming.\n9) NEVER look out the windows if you hear someone walking. \n10) NEVER leave the light. \n I hope you enjoy your stay, and hope to see you after.'\nMy father was just as confused as I was. \"Being secluded can cause delirium. Sounds like they are trying to keep us from running off.\" He said with a shrug. I wasn't buying it, but what other explanation did I have? I decided not to let my nerves get to me, and pinned the papers to the cork board next to the fridge. \n\nThe weeks went by, and the work was long. Most of the time we were either sleeping, or working. Even on the weekends we mostly slept to try and get as much energy as possible. This cold could drain you quickly. It's dark always. I can see how some could go mad. I was becoming sir crazy, only being in the cabin. I decided to go out and just try to get rid of this creeping feeling. Dad was sleeping again, so I left a note, and headed outside. \n\nBeing surrounded by snow you can't help but let your inner child come out. So I decided to make a snow man. I didn't have anything foe the arms or face so he was just 3 balls of snow stacked on each other. I told back to look at my master piece, when I heard heavy footsteps right outside thw light. I pulled out my flashlight and saw nothing. I scanned the tree line, nothing. Thinking it was an animal, I decided to go back inside. \n\n46 minutes. New record! I said, even though I knew it would have taken longer if I had all the fixings of building a snowman. I started to slowly take my cold weather gear off. I made sure to let dad sleep, and I decided I would try to sleep as well. I made my way to my room, looking out into the night. It's dark. The spot light must be out. I grumbled as I went to replace the bulb. I went to the pantry, no bulbs. I went to the paper, yep that's were they said they were. Damn it!\n\nI woke dad up to let him know. He didn't seem worried so we didn't stress. I tried to call the receptionist, but no one answered. \"I'll try again later.\" I thought. *CRACK* I heard what sounded like a joint popping. \"Dad you shouldn't pop your knuckles. It's not good for you.\" I yelled to dad. He didn't respond. I went to his room, but he was sleeping. I went back to the kitchen, and noticed the spot light above the widow was out. That's what that sound was. I'll definitely have to call again later, but after a nap. \n\nI woke up to the sound of a child crying. I jumped out of bed, and followed the sound to the back door. I reached for the handle, and dad grabbed my wrist. I hadn't seen him by the window. He pressed his finger to his lips, with a worried look on his face. \n\"What's going one.\" I whispered, barely making a sound. \"Something is out there.\" He whispered. I looked at him in confusion. And he beckoned me to the window. I peaked out, the cries were still there but they were becoming distorted. I tried to look into the darkness. I couldn't see anything. Then I saw themovement. My body began to shake. My breath was heavy. I looked at dad, and he was pale. \n\n\"What is that?\" I asked. \"I don't know\" he said. I went to the cork board, and grabbed the rules paper. \"Dad, do you think we are hallucinating?\" I asked as I handed him the paper. \"Son, I have no idea.\" He said is a small voice. I started to worry. \"I was outside for 46 minutes. The rules say never more than 10. Dad, what if i this is happening because i broke a rule.\" Dad grabbed my shoulder. *CRACK* The sound made us both jump. I went to dad's room, and the spot light above his window had gone out. I tried to call again and again, but there was no answer.  Worry was starting to consume me. I went back to let dad know that I couldn't reach anyone, but he was gone. The screams had stopped as well. I checked the whole cabin, but I couldn't find him. I went to the back door and saw his gear was gone. Panic flooded me, I put my gear on, as quickly as I could, and stepped out. \"Daad! Where are you?\" I yelled into the dark, scanning the whole area as I did. I started to step further out, getting closer to the darkness when I heard it \"JESHUA, RUN!!!!\" Dad screamed toward me. His voice was full of fear. I ran straight for his voice. \"DAD, WHERE ARE YOU!!! DAD!!!!\" my breath was coming in heaves. I was panicking. \"AAAAAHHHHHHHRRGGGGG\" The scream my father let out was blood curdling, distorted, and watery. I could hear the sound of is flesh being torn over and over again. I ran toward his screams, and dropped to my knees at what I saw.\n\nMy father was in pieces. Blood stained the white snow. \"NOOOO!!\" I screamed out as I fell to my knees. I crawled to his body, pulling the pieces back together, telling him he was going to be okay. I tried pushing his guts back inside his body, but i couldnt. The sobs that left me, were uncontrollable. He was unrecognizable, and there was nothing I could do. I laid my head on his chest and let my grief wash over me. What could do this? Who? Why? All the questions flooded me, but I realized I was not alone. I could hear heavy breathing. Fear was once again flooding me. I slowly looked up. There just beyond the light I could see it. It was giant. Its head was reptilian in shape, it eyes or giant black orbs on its face. They resembled the night sky with little sparkles of blue and white in them. It's neck was long like a giraffes, it's body was humanoid, but thin. It's arms drug the snow, with 3 long fingers on each hand. It's legs bent backwards like a birds, and it's entire body was covered in long black silky fur. It opened its mouth and a sound I can best describe as a wave of heat, mixed with a train, came out, while showing me the elongated teeth that lined it mouth. I grabbed my flashlight and shined it toward the monster. It screamed out, and ran toward the trees. I ran to the cabin, falling through the door. I grabbed the bags of sand, blocking the door to the best of my ability. I sat down trying to calm my self. I can't breathe, I can't breathe.\n\nBEEP. BEEP. BEEP.\n\nMy alarm woke me up. How long had I slept? Why was I on the floor? All the memories cam flooding back. \"This can't be happening, this can't be happening.\" I cried. CRACK. I ran to the sound noticing all the spot lights, had now burnt out. I ran to the rooms gathering all lanterns, flashlights, and candles I could find. \n\nKNOCK.KNOCK.KNOCK. \n\nI jumps as someone knocked on the door. \"I've come to check on you.\" A female voice sounded from the other side of the door. BANG.BANG.BANG. \"I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE SAFE!\" The voice was now frantic, and distorted. The pounding on the door increasing. \n\nWith as sudden as it came, it was gone. I sighed with tears streaming down my face. \"I'm going to die here..\" I whispered into the empty space around me. I held my face in my hand sobbing. \"I don't want to die here.\" Just then, the lights went out. I ran to the table lighting  everything I had and taking one to each room. What happens when they burn out? There's nothing I can do...\n\n so I write this to you, in hopes you will be able to survive. Leave this place... it is coming. It. Is. Coming.\n\n\"Mommy, read this story!! It's a scary one, so I think you will like it!\" Bret said, waving a journal in the air. \"Where did you get this?\" I asked in an amused voice. \"My dresser!! I found it while unpacking!\"  CRACK",

        "text": " Hey everyone. So, some pretty major things have happened and I feel as though you all deserve more answers considering I left you all with not much to work with.\n\nI've gotten lots of messages from you guys giving your input or inquiries, however I don't think any of you guys seem to have any more of an idea as to what we are dealing with. Which, personally, only seems to make me more anxious.\n\nI was hoping to not have to bring this to my friends because I didn't want to freak them out. I didn't want to make them think that there is something unexplainable in the area. But I felt there was no other option. Though, I don't know what I was expecting out of them. All they said was that they think I'm having a relapse and to maybe bring this up to my doctor. \n\nEveryone just seems to think I'm lying.\n\nWhich, I guess I can't blame you for. If it was me in your shoes, I wouldn't believe it. If I was the one laying in bed scrolling through reddit and I came across this story, I wouldn't take it seriously. Because there's close to no reason for this to be real. So, I guess I'm dealing with this on my own, and of course any of you that do believe me.\n\nIn my previous post, I tried to not jump to too much of a conclusion and say that this is a creepy pasta. Even though I leaned very much towards that, I didn't want to confirm it because I had no proof of that. However over the last several days, it has definitely been proved to me that this is something pulled straight from a horror movie. Not an animal. Not a human. Not a combination, but something completely new - and utterly terrifying. But we will get to all of that later. I'm going to try to take you through the events as they happened…\n\nBefore I get into it I want to say a few things now that I was a little afraid to say, or things I just otherwise forgot to mention while I was frazzled previously. The first of them being how large the footprints I saw were. I compared them to the footprints of a bunny, however they were drastically larger. The prints I saw were probably between two and 3 feet.\n\nThe next thing I want to cover is when the footprints were below my window. Like I said before, my bedroom is on the second story of my house. There is no way a human for example could see through my window from the ground. So if we are assuming the creature had been looking in my window, we would be dealing with something \\~15 feet tall.\n\nLast thing I would like to draw your attention to is when I looked out my window which was completely black. The same night I first posted this story. To me, that means either that thing was looking at me through my window, or it was otherwise obstructing my view of my backyard for whatever reason.\n\nSo, now that we have all of that covered, let's get into what you came here for…\n\nLets pick up where we last left off, shall we?\n\nI was typing the last few letters to my previous post before hitting the button to post it online. I let out a slightly defeated sigh as I turned off my phone and laid my head on my pillow. I never liked asking for help, but at the moment I was desperate. That's when a loud “ding” coming from my phone caught my attention. I picked up my phone and saw that I had received a message from my older brother, Noah.\n\n“Hey, im home from work, the lock on the door froze up. Can you come let me in?”\n\nMy face turned into confusion. Noah gets off work at 11:00pm. He came home hours ago. He was in his room, sleeping. I was sure of it.\n\nAs I stared at the message another one came up, also from Noah.\n\n“Never mind, I got it.”\n\nStill as confused as ever, I watched the top of my phone screen, awaiting another notification. We had a fancy lock on our doors with a keypad that you would type your password into. The door would unlock and automatically lock again after 2 minutes. However, it also sends a notification to our phones whenever it locks or unlocks for security reasons.\n\nI waited and stared at my phone a little longer, but nothing. I crept out of my bedroom and towards the foyer. I looked out our mostly glass door and saw that no one was outside. I also took note of the fact that I was able to see outside. I made my way over towards my brother's room and put my ear up to his door. I heard him quietly snoring, sleeping far better than I was. I shook my head and made my way back to my room. I opened my curtains again and looked outside. Looked at the stars, looked at the light snowfall, looked at the distant street lights. I groaned out of frustration and put my head in my hands.\n\nI left my curtains open and stared outside until dawn, thinking. That's when the thing that I never wanted to happen, happened. Something that I would not wish upon my worst enemies. \n\nI began to hear the snow outside make the sound of a familiar crunch - the sound it makes when you walk on it. I lifted up my head in an effort to hear the sound even just a little bit better. I got closer to my window and looked out. I saw something that I feel like I can't explain because of how absurd it was.\n\nIt had the body of a humanoid type creature. It was very skinny, I watched its bones shift as it walked. I still don't know how it moved considering there appeared to be no muscle on it. I saw no veins, no tendons, no space that there would be organs, nothing. It was as if it was a walking skeleton.\n\nIts skin appeared very taut. It was as if it was far too tight for its “body.” The color of its skin was somewhere between purple and cyan, except it was very cold and dull, but not pale.\n\nAs for its head, I have no other way to explain it than just the shape of a flat screen TV. Large, rectangular, and flat.\n\nIt was walking around from the front of the house, right outside my room. It was facing down to the ground and I silently thanked god I couldn't see its face as I watched in terror as it slowly walked towards my neighbors fence.\n\nWhen it got to the fence, it stood still for a moment and I realized I had been holding my breath for too long and my lungs were burning and screaming at me for air. I shakily sucked in the smallest amount of air, but even that, my body was thankful for.\n\nIt started to move again. It reached down to where its knees were and it wrapped its long fingers around it and ripped the bottom part of its leg clean off. I fought off the urge to throw up and forced myself to continue to watch.\n\nIt grabbed both ends of the leg and stretched it out like it was rubber. Once it seemed to be happy with it, it placed it down to where it was supposed to be and I was barely able to see its skin seem to melt around it before solidifying again and connecting the two pieces of it. I had to tear my eyes away for a moment as I felt the bile in my stomach rise in my throat, urging to be released.\n\nI turned back to look out the window at it again and saw that it had done the same with its other leg and both of its arms. It seemed to be reattaching its other arm to its shoulder joint.\n\nIt extended both of its legs before doing the same with its arms as if it was stretching sore muscles. I watched as its bones popped with a piercing and high pitched noise, similar to a rock falling into a metal bucket. The separate vertebrate of its spine jostled in order starting from the bottom working its way up.\n\nAfter it was done, it leaned back over again and placed one hand gingerly on the top of my neighbors fence before it followed up by planting one foot on top as well\n\nIn one sudden swift movement, it jumped from the fence and latched itself onto the wall right in front of my window. I was face to face with something so horrifying that absolutely nothing or anyone would be able to stare back. I caught a slight glimpse of its face when it initially jumped to me. It had a small circular bump on the bottom center of it which I assume was its mouth. Just above it there were 2 sets of multiple holes resembling nostrils One hole in the middle with probably 8 surrounding holes. Its eyes were far back in its face, they were shiny black orbs, no white to its eyes. They were small, about the size of a human's eyes. They were glossy and seemed to be producing a large amount of pus.\n\nI don't even remember jumping back, but at some point I had ended up on the other side of the room on the floor with my back to a wall, gagging as this thing seemed to stare right through me. I stared in horror as something began to pour from its mouth. A weird orange substance with the occasional streak of silver poured from its mouth. I can only compare it to some sort of oil.\n\nI began to see stars as my vision faded surprisingly fast. I was clawing at the carpet of my floor trying desperately to keep myself grounded and stop myself from fainting. But no matter what I did, my vision eventually went black as I watched the oil pour from it as it tilted its head ever so slightly sideways, almost mocking what my dog had done a few days prior.\n\nI woke up hours later, still on the floor. I looked up and the previous events began to come back to me. The first thing I noticed was a very sharp stabbing pain in the side of my neck. I instinctively put my hand over the pain, expecting to feel some sort of gash, but I didn't. I looked at my hand expecting some trace of blood, but nothing. I was completely unharmed.\n\nI fought to stand up, my body aching with pains probably from being passed out in such a harmful position. I picked up my phone from my desk and took note of the time and date. It was 2pm on January the 18th. It was the same day that I had posted on reddit, and it was only a few hours after I saw that… thing. It sent shivers down my spine and caused tears to well up in my eyes to even think about it. \n\nI left my room and made sure to take my meds to avoid an oncoming anxiety attack amongst other things.\n\nNoah had already left for work, and luckily Boomer didn't have to go outside. Or at least, he wasn't interested. So I sat down at my desk and turned on my computer. There were no emails from any of my professors, no exams or tests due today, and what was due I was very grateful that I already had done.\n\nIt hit me that I hadn't even bothered to look outside. And for obvious reasons, I decided I probably should, as much as I didn't want to. So I took a deep breath and counted to myself from three to zero before looking. There was nothing out of the ordinary, no footprints, no oil smeared on my window, nothing. Just a normal day.\n\nI remembered that I needed to get groceries today, but I was still very unwilling to leave the safety of my house. Especially after what had happened last night. I thanked god for modern technology and ordered groceries to be dropped off at my home, claiming I was sick. A little while later I got a message that said they were waiting for me outside of my door.\n\nI took a deep breath and opened my door, pleased to see all of the items awaiting me. I began picking up the bags and bringing them into my house. However, there was one extra thing I definitely did not want.\n\nAfter I had cleared away all of the bags, I noticed just outside of my door the footprints of the creature. I trembled and looked around quickly in a panic. Nothing to be seen. I closed and locked the door, trying to open it just to make sure it was locked.\n\nAfter a few moments to let the shock pass, I eventually began to put the groceries away after confirming all possible entrances to the house were locked. As I was putting everything away, it started to occur to me that maybe the footprints were appearing earlier then they actually happened.\n\nI thought about the footprints I saw outside of my window. They were there before I looked out the window to an obstructed view, yet they weren't there now. I thought about the other prints, the ones leading up to my neighbors fence before stopping. They were from last night, when the creature had leapt from the fence to my window. That's why the prints didn't keep going on the other side of the fence.\n\nMy blood ran cold when the realization hit me. I said out loud to myself, standing in my kitchen on wobbly legs “Does that mean… it's going to be at my front door?” \n\nI almost collapsed on myself when my phone dinged with a notification:\n\n“Front door has been unlocked”\n\nFollowed up by the sound of the door opening.\n\nI felt every bit of moisture leave my mouth, causing me to start coughing. My stomach twisted and turned as if I was riding the fastest roller coaster ever. Tears poured from my eyes as my ears rang louder and louder in a deafening silence. Panic attack.\n\nI can't quite remember the next few minutes from there. The next thing I remember is Noah gripping me by my shoulders, holding me up when my body beckoned to fall. It was hard to hear but I was able to make out “come sit on the couch with me.” his voice sounded as if we were both under water. He walked me over to the couch slowly.\n\nAs I came back to reality I realized there was no creature anywhere. I was safe, Noah was safe, Boomer was safe. Noah explained to me that he had walked in to find me having a panic attack, so he began to comfort me.\n\nI checked my watch, realizing he isn't supposed to be home from work for hours. I asked him why he was home.\n\n“Something happened at work, and they are desperate,” he got caught up in trying to find the right words to say before continuing. “They need to send me out on a short business trip for about 2 days.” this was quick to catch my attention. I sat up and turned my body towards him, suddenly attacking him with dozens of questions. “I don't know all the details but they want me out as soon as possible, so tomorrow, instead of going to work I'm going to drive for a few hours out of town. They sent me home early today so I could pack and do whatever else I have to do.” he told me. I wasn't able to stop the words from falling from my mouth. “No, I cant be here alone because-” I cut myself off. Don't tell him or he will take you back to the hospital. “Because I'm going to sleepover at my friend's place for her birthday. No one will be here to take care of Boomer.” I said. He thought for a second before he said “I mean, I guess I can take the dog with me. He likes going for drives.” I thought to myself about the results this would have if the creature came while Noah was gone. Maybe it wouldn't be so terrible. Noah and Boomer will be safe, and the creature can take what it wants. “Ok, you should go get packing.”\n\nThe rest of that day was pretty uneventful, which I guess I was grateful for. I couldn't decide if I should hope for the creature to come while Noah is here or while he's gone. I spent the rest of the day helping Noah pack, and cooking for us. Noah took the dog outside before we got ready for bed, but I still watched from inside to make sure nothing happened to him.\n\nEventually nighttime rolled around and I laid in bed, simply exhausted from lack of sleep. I picked up my phone to switch on my alarm. I noticed the clock said 11:28pm. I couldn't help but get goosebumps and became suddenly alert as I remembered the first encounter I had with the creature had taken place around this time. I figured it was best if I just went to sleep. Considering Noah hasn't had any issues with this thing, it was safe to assume it just wanted me. He was safe, and whatever happened to me, happened. I quickly fell asleep due to how tired I was.\n\nI woke up the next morning to the sound of the alarm on my phone going off. I turned it off and mustered the courage to get out of bed so I could say goodbye to Noah and Boomer, knowing that it might be the last time I will. Soon enough they were on their way and I stood in the house all alone watching through the glass door as they got in the car and drove off. \n\nI didn't know how I wanted to spend these next few days. I was no longer nervous or anxious. It wasn't that I was suicidal, but death just wasn't scary to me. I thought about writing up a note for my brother, but I didn't want him to think I was suicidal or ran away. I don't want to make him think I just left him, so I opted not to. \n\nI tried to listen to some of my favorite songs to enjoy what could be my last day. I took out my phone and put on my loudest pair of headphones and hit shuffle on my playlist.\n\n“Out ta get me” “Guns N Roses” \n\nMaybe not today. Skip.\n\n“Dust N Bones” “Guns N Roses”\n\nI skipped, but not before grinning to myself, realizing how many of my favorites were by GNR.\n\n“For Whom The Bells Toll” “Metallica”\n\nI let that one play. And thought about the lyrics.\n\n“Make his fight on the hill in the early day. Constant chill deep inside” \n\nI spent the rest of that day just thinking about what I was going to do when it did come, because I already made up my mind that it was inevitable. I thought about whether I would just take matters into my own hands, but feared that the creature wouldn't be satisfied and continue its terrorizing. I could just walk into its grasp but I had the same problem. I eventually decided that the only way I could guarantee that it would not come back was if I killed it or otherwise moved it to a place where it couldn't harm people. I thought to myself on how you could kill something you know nothing about and opted for the latter, but couldn't think of such a place.\n\nAll I knew was that I wasn't going to make it easy for it to get me.\n\nSooner than I was prepared for, night time came. I didn't have much of a plan, but I had a few small ones that wouldn't necessarily help. More or less I accepted my defeat, but made sure I didn't just let it get me. I was going to be a sacrifice, or bait to take it where it won't harm anyone ever again.\n\nIt was getting later and later and I eventually went to my bedroom and got comfortable in my blankets. Most nights I took off the necklace with moms ashes in it, but tonight, mom was going to be with me. By the time 5am rolled around, I started to think that maybe tonight wasn't the night it was going to come. I continued to stare at the ceiling of my room, gently humming along to the music I was listening to. “Nothing lasts forever, even cold November rain…” I was confused when the song was cut off by a notification. I picked up my phone and read the message from “Maybe: Noah”  “Hey, it's Noah. I had to borrow my coworker's phone. I'm home from work,  the lock on the door froze up. Can you come let me in?” and then “Never mind, I got it.” followed up by a separate notification “Front door has been unlocked”\n\nThis was it.\n\nI listened to the creature navigate my home, it made an occasional ticking sound similar to a metronome, or a sound almost like a fire extinguisher. I was hoping that whilst it was checking out another room of the house I would be able to sneak out either the front or back door. It wasn't going to come to my room first because I was the farthest away from the front door. I wasn't super concerned about it spotting me because I assumed it wouldn't be able to out run me, judging by the way it walked previously. \n\nI listened carefully, judging where it was in the house to find when the best time for me to go would be. And when that time came around, I took a deep breath and squeezed the necklace around my neck gently. I opened the door and it was not long before it made the loudest creaking noise I've ever heard a door make. Very quickly I saw the creature come to inspect the noise. I didn't close the door in time and it spotted me. I cursed and slammed the door shut and locked it, seemingly just in time to prevent the thing from getting to me.\n\nI grabbed a wood plank I had in my room to prepare for this exact situation and wedged it between the door and my desk which was against the wall so it wouldn't be able to open the door. At least not easily. Like I said, I had plans, none of them helpful.\n\nI looked around spastically, having not thought about this previously. My window was the only way out.\n\nIt slashed at my door aggressively as I tried desperately to open my window. I pulled and pulled as hard as I could as I felt the adrenaline coursing through me, but even that wasn't enough to unlock the window. I cursed under my breath and turned towards the door just in time to see it bash a hole through the only thing that was separating us. Through the hole I could see it crouched down, far too big to fit in the hallway. It reached its hand through the hole and began to tear away the remainder of the door.\n\nIn what felt like 1 second I had made my decision and done it. I took a few steps back and I felt the creature reach through and scratch me on the shoulder and took that as my que to go. I ran towards my window and leapt through it. The creature screeched as I broke through the glass and fell down before landing on the ground, grateful for the snowfall we had a few days ago to help break my fall even the smallest amount. \n\nI didn't get any substantial injuries from the fall that I noticed, and removed a small shard of glass that was in the side of my neck. Luckily it wasn't a deep cut. I grabbed a glass shard and slipped it into my sock, as it was the only place I knew it wouldn't move that much. At least now I had a suicide pill if it came to that. I stood up and began to run. I wasn't very far when I heard some loud banding noises. I assumed the creature had just gotten through the door and was working to get through the window.\n\nThis was my stomping grounds as a child. I knew the area like the back of my hand. As I ran I heard the lyrics from the song from earlier echo in the back of my head. “Make his fight on the hill in the early day. Constant chill deep inside” \n\nI turned to look at the wooded hill that overlooked my neighborhood. Maybe I will.\n\nI followed a road as far up the hills as it would take me. I got further than I was expecting to, but not as far as I needed to when I heard the creature screech again. I turned to see it spot me and began to run in my direction. Luckily it wasn't as fast as some of the creatures I read stories about, but it was definitely faster than me and far faster then I had expected. I could only pray that I would be able to get away.\n\nI looked behind my shoulder and saw that I had very little time left, and there was definitely no chance I was going to get away. But if I was going to go down, I would take it with me. Praying wasn't going to help me anymore.\n\nI got to the top of the hill and shoved a large rock down towards the creature. It was a rock I was always afraid of because of how unstable it seemed. I threw all of my body weight at it and luckily it was just barely enough to move the rock. I stumbled but caught myself pretty well. The rock slid down the icy road towards the creature and it tried to avoid it but that threw off its balance enough that it slipped and slid down the road. Not very much space, but maybe enough. I needed it to be enough.\n\nI ran into the trees that covered the hill before I neared the line I was never allowed to cross.\n\nAs a kid mom always told me to never cross an imaginary line because it started to get close to the cliff that dropped off into the ocean. Of course mom always was with me if I was up here, but once I was old enough to be here on my own, I still had to obey the line.\n\nI gripped my necklace tight in my hands before I said “Mom, I know I promised I would never do it. I'm sorry.\" I said out loud. I lifted the necklace to my face and planted a delicate kiss on it as a tear ran down my cheek. I heard yet another scream of the creature and turned. “That might be enough space.” I said, and soon enough, I crossed the line.\n\nI got to a tree that was as close to the cliff as possible and began to climb it. The creature caught up and jumped onto the tree, causing it to teeter scarily over the edge and it knocked me off, but luckily I was able to catch myself on a branch. I looked down the cliff side at the rocks falling into the water below as the waves crashed angrily against it. That's when I noticed in the reflection of moms necklace a branch that was perfect for me to get more secure on the tree and continue my climb.\n\nAs I neared the top I felt the creature claw at the bottom of my feet and scratch a line down my calf. I screamed as my hand naturally went to grip the opening but I forced it to keep me on the tree. \n\nI got to the top seconds before the creature did. I took a mere second to look to the sky and admire the sunrise. It's probably the last time I will.  It was perched on a branch just below me and I whistled at it, causing it to look up at me. I stared at it in its cold blacked out eyes and said in the most authoritative voice I could muster “Go on then. Come and get me, you son of a bitch.”\n\nWith that it lunged up at me causing the tree to begin to slip off the side of the cliff, just hanging on by the roots buried in the ground. I held onto the tree doing my best to hide from the creature navigating around it. Soon, the action caused the tree to fall down the cliff. Once it was far enough gone I jumped to the land, grabbing onto the ground desperately trying to hang on. \n\nLuckily the creature had not reacted quick enough and it gave one final screech as it fell down the cliff before eventually hitting the water with a loud splash. \n\nI clawed my way back onto secure land. I laid my head down on the ground, the snow cold against my burning hot skin despite the cold temperatures. I listened closely to hear if the creature ever resurfaced, but I was confident it had not. The adrenaline began to wear off and I started to feel the pain in my calf more and more. I looked down to see the snow around it had turned a crimson color. I sat up and examined it. Even though I was trained in some aspects of first aid, this was not something I could stop. And I was almost ok with that.\n\nI laid there for a little while staring up at the sky as it turned various warm colors as the sun rose. My vision began to slip and I felt my body become a comforting temperature, as if I was back in Moms arms. My eyelids were heavy and I allowed them to eventually fall closed.\n\nI awoke to the sound of my alarm clock going off. The steady beeping becomes annoying. I went to turn it off but was interrupted by my brother's voice. I was in the hospital. I turned to Noah and saw the dried tears on his face. Soon a few doctors came in and explained some stuff to me.\n\nThey said that they were still trying to work out the puzzle, but they told me that someone had broken in and attempted to murder me. I ran and got to the top of the hill. When I pushed the boulder down the hill at the “person” it got the attention of my neighbors and they called in with public disturbance. Upon investigation the police found me severely injured and unconscious. \n\nA few days went by and once I was healthy enough the police asked me about what had happened. I decided to go along with someone who broke in to kill me, because I figured it was easier then to try to explain to them the story of The Footprints In The Snow.",

        "text": "The house was a small, two-story affair with white siding on the bottom floor and grey shingles on top. Three windows were facing the street: a large picture window; a smaller, rectangular one above that; and another larger window below that.\n\nI got out of my car and walked towards the door. I knocked twice before it opened. A woman stood there wearing a blue dress with her hair tied back in a bun. She had bright green eyes that seemed to sparkle when she saw me standing outside her home. \"Hello,\" she said cheerfully. Her voice was soft but carried well through the quiet night.\n\n\"Hi. Are you Mrs Tanner?\"\n\nShe nodded. \"Yes, I am.\" She smiled again and stepped aside so I could enter the house. It smelled odd inside. Not bad or anything like that—just strange. Like old books and dust. \"Please come in,\" she said as we entered the living room.\n\nIt wasn't much more than a couch, a coffee table, and an end table with a lamp on it. That's all I really needed for a place to sleep. The walls were painted yellow, which looked nice against the dark furniture. The carpet was black and covered most of the hardwood floors. There was a small kitchen off to the side of the living room with a sink, stove, and fridge. Everything was clean and tidy.\n\n\"I'm sorry about the mess,\" she said while pointing to some boxes stacked in the corner of the room. \"My husband died last year and I just haven't had time to get around to moving everything yet.\"\n\n\"No problem. I don't mind sleeping in a bit of a mess.\"\n\nShe chuckled softly. \"Well, if you want to put your things away, feel free. Just make sure not to take too long since I have to leave in a few hours.\"\n\n\"Okay. Thanks.\"\n\n\"You're welcome. I'll be right back.\" She disappeared down a hallway.\n\nAs I looked around the room I noticed something else odd about this house. The walls weren't straight. They bulged outward here and there like they'd been pushed from the inside out by someone pushing their way through them. It was subtle enough that it didn't bother me at first, but as I looked closer I realized that it wasn't just the walls either. Every single surface in the entire house had these little imperfections, including the ceiling and floor.\n\nI heard footsteps coming down the hall and turned to see Mrs Tanner returning with two glasses filled with water. She handed me one and took a seat on the couch across from me. \"So what brings you out this way?\" she asked as she sipped her drink.\n\nI'm looking for a friend of mine, he went missing in this area about a month ago\"\n\n\"Oh, that's terrible! What happened?\"\n\n\"he just... vanished.\" I paused as I thought about how to explain it. \"He was staying at an abandoned hotel nearby and never came back. We think he might've gotten lost in the woods.\"\n\nShe shook her head sadly. \"That's awful. Is there any chance he survived? Maybe run away somewhere?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I hope so.\"\n\nShe sighed heavily and leaned back on the couch. \"I'm sorry. I wish I could help you find him.\"\n\nWe sat quietly for a moment before she spoke up again. \"I don't mean to pry, but are you sure he isn't still alive? Maybe he's hiding somewhere or something?\"\n\n\"Well...\" I hesitated. \"Maybe.\"\n\n\"Do you have any idea where he might've gone?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure, but I have a hunch\"\n\nShe laughed softly and shook her head. \"Well, let me know if you hear anything about him. I'll keep my ears open as well.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" I said as I stood up from the couch. \"I better go get some sleep now.\"\n\n\"Of course, ill show you to your room\"\n\nI downed the glass of water and placed it on the table. Even that seemed to be crooked. \"Thanks again for letting me stay here.\"\n\nShe waved it off and stood up from the couch. \"You're more than welcome. Please feel free to use anything in the kitchen if you need anything.\"\n\n\"I will.\" I followed her down the hallway to a staircase leading to the second floor. At the top of those stairs was another hallway that led to three doors: one on each side and one at the end. She pointed to the door on the left. \"That one is yours. No one else is staying this weekend so the other doors will be locked.\n\nShe opened the door to my room and flicked on the light switch. There was a dresser opposite the bed with a window above it and a small bed with a nightstand next to it. The wall behind the bed was covered in posters of famous horror films, mostly slasher flicks. \"This should be all set up for you.\" She motioned towards the bed. \"Make yourself comfortable. My room is on the third floor, if you need anything, please just knock on my door.\"\n\n\"Okay, Thanks, I will do\"\n\nShe walked over to the door at the end of the hall and closed it behind her before disappearing into her own room. I took a look around my room before lying down on the bed. The sheets were clean and smelled nice, but I couldn't tell whether they'd been washed recently or not. As I got under them though, I noticed something strange about them. They felt... heavy. Like they were weighted down on one side. When I tried to lift them up, they wouldn't budge. I rolled over onto my back and pulled them back down. Something was definitely wrong with this place.\n\nI lay there staring at the ceiling for a while before drifting off into a deep but restless sleep. I woke up sometime later to a knocking sound on my door. I sat up and rubbed my eyes before standing up from the bed. \"Who is it?\" I called out as I walked over to the door.\n\nThere was no answer.\n\nI unlocked the door and cracked it open. It was dark outside but the moon was bright enough that I could see everything clearly. I stepped out into the hallway and saw nothing except darkness. \"Hello?\" I called out again, but once again, there was no response. \"Is someone there?\" I asked as I turned around slowly.\n\nI heard another knock from behind me and spun around only to catch sight of Mrs Tanner standing in the doorway to her room. Her hair had fallen loose from her bun and hung down past her shoulders. She was wearing a white tank top and blue pyjama pants with red stripes running down both sides. She looked like she was trying to hide herself by covering her face with her hands, which were pressed against her cheeks. \"Mrs Tanner?\"\n\nShe didn't say anything and continued to stare at me with wide eyes.\n\n\"Are you okay?\" I asked as I approached her.\n\nShe nodded but kept her head down.\n\n\"What happened?\" I asked as I reached out to touch her shoulder.\n\nShe flinched away from my hand and backed up until she hit the wall behind her. Then, without saying a word, she ran down the hallway and disappeared into the shadows.\n\nI stood there for several seconds, dumbfounded by what had just happened. What the hell did I just witness? Was it real? Or was it just some sort of dream or hallucination brought on by stress or exhaustion?\n\nI went back inside my room and locked the door behind me. I grabbed my phone from my pocket and checked the time. It was after midnight. I'd been asleep for hours. I sat on the edge of the bed and stared at a poster of Friday the 13th hanging on the wall above the desk. Why would Mrs Tanner act like that? And why would she try to hide from me when I touched her? It made no sense.\n\nI sighed heavily and laid back down on the bed. I wanted to go back to sleep, but I knew I couldn't fall asleep now. Not until I figured out what was going on here. Maybe if I waited long enough, she'd come back out and explain everything.\n\nI must've fallen asleep eventually because suddenly I was shaken awake by someone pounding on my door. \"Wake up!\"\n\nI jumped up from the bed and opened the door to find Mrs Tanner standing in front of me with her hands balled into fists at her sides. \"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"Get dressed! You have to leave right now!\" she said frantically as she began to pace back and forth across the room.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"You don't know how dangerous this place is! Get your things and get out of here now!\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n\nShe stopped pacing and looked me dead in the eye. \"The house is cursed!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"It's haunted! There are spirits in this house!\"\n\nI laughed nervously and shook my head. \"There aren't any ghosts.\"\n\n\"Then what do you call that thing you saw earlier tonight?\"\n\n\"I don't know what you're talking about,\" I lied. Was she talking about herself?\n\n\"I'm not leaving until I get some answers.\"\n\n\"Please, just go! If you stay here much longer, something bad will happen to you just like your friend!\"\n\n\"My friend?\"\n\n\"Just go!\" she yelled as she started running towards the stairs.\n\n\"Wait!\" I shouted after her, but it was too late. She was already halfway up the steps before she turned around and glared down at me. \"Tell me what happened to him!\"\n\n\"He died,\" she said simply.\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"They got to him\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"The monsters!\"\n\nI blinked at her and tried to process what she was telling me. \"Monsters?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsters! They came through the walls and took him away!\"\n\n\"Are you insane!?\" I screamed at her. \"There's no such thing as monsters!\"\n\nShe frowned at me and shook her head. \"There are more than you think.\" She then pointed to the floor below us. \"You need to leave right now before they come for you next.\"\n\n\"I can't leave! My friend might be here somewhere! He could still be alive!\"\n\nShe let out a frustrated sigh and walked over to the window. She pushed aside the curtains and looked outside. The moon was bright enough that I could see everything clearly. I followed her gaze out the window and saw nothing except darkness. She pulled open the window and leaned out into the night air. \"He's leaving!\" she called out into the darkness.\n\nI heard a low growl coming from what sounded like inside the walls. Mrs Tanner slowly backed away from the window. Then, without warning, she fell backwards onto the ground. Her body hit the ground with a sickening crunch and didn't move again.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI stood there staring at Mrs Tanner's broken body lying on the floor for several seconds before turning around and sprinting down the stairs.\n\nThe whole house began to creak and moan and it seemed as if the walls were closing in on me. I ran past the kitchen and living room, both of which appeared untouched, and headed towards the front door. The only light came from the moon shining through the windows in the hallway. As I approached the exit, I felt something grab hold of my shoulder and pull me back. I spun around quickly to see a figure standing in the shadows behind me. It was tall and thin with oily skin and long black hair. Its face was covered by a mask made of human bones. I struggled against its grip but couldn't break free.\n\nThe walls looked as if they were melting and more human bone-masked faces were emerging from all around me, surrounding me on all sides and closing in on me until I couldn't breathe. I reached out to touch one of them but only grabbed hold of empty air. Then, suddenly, I was dragged back through the wall and felt myself descending into the pitch-black abyss beneath me.\n\nI woke up gasping for breath and sat straight up in bed. My heart was racing and my body was soaked with sweat. There was a loud bang on the door and I jumped out of bed. I unlocked the door and opened it slightly, just enough to see who was knocking. But when I did, I wasn't surprised to see Mrs Tanner standing there with her hands balled into fists at her sides, [\"Get dressed! You have to leave right now!\"](https://youtu.be/0lXDjxIf3KU)",

        "text": " I lived on an island south-west of Canada and north-west of the USA. Both of the countries hadn’t claimed the island, so we just called it “USC” (United States of Canada). Very creative name, I know.\n\nWe celebrated different holidays very differently: one of the main holidays being Halloween. \n\nWe started at 11 PM, when we chucked candies out of the window and onto the streets. Then, we hid. When it struck midnight, the Day of the Arcane begun. \n\nFor 24 hours, we have to hide. Otherwise the Arcane would come for us. \n\nThe Arcane had a skull like a wolf, covered in flesh. It had no eyes and //its mouth had some sharp teeth. It’s body was just a ribcage and it had red stuff around it. It’s legs were thin and had three, big claws. Once again, it was covered in flesh. It had tan, red and white stubs instead of legs. \n\nThis story happened on Halloween 2013. I was 21 and had 2 children. My wife was 20 years old (we went to the same school). We chucked the candy out of the window as usual and went outside and into the bunker. We set up 4 sleeping bags and my two kids went to sleep.\n\nI got out my flashlight and got out of the bunker.\n\n*Were the doors locked?*\n\nI went to look. They had to be. I looked at the clock. ***11:51.*** Huh.\n\nI ran to the front door, and checked if it was locked. It was unlocked. I then locked it and went to the window. Curiosity peaked. I checked the clock. ***11:56.*** I did want to see it for myself - so I looked out of the window.\n\nI ducked.\n\nThe Arcane was there. I crawled onto the floor and into the kitchen. As quietly as I could, I opened the backyard window and closed it. I opened the lock on the bunker, got in, and closed it. I checked the clock on the wall. ***00:01.*** 23 hours and 59 minutes left. \n\nLet me tell you more about the Day of the Arcane. At least one person had to make a blood sacrifice, otherwise the Arcane would be “unsatisfied”. If it was unsatisfied, it would go on a rampage for 30 minutes after the day ended, destroying everything in it’s path. Including the bunkers.\n\nNobody knows where the Arcane came from. There are quite a few conspiracy theories, one of the most popular being that the Arcane swam from the coast of the USA or Canada and swam here. Apparently the Arcane is a female.\n\nIt might lay eggs.\n\nInside of the bunker, I heard claws scratching. Did I forget my cat? My heart lurched. I checked through the peephole inside of the bunker. My cat. I opened the door. The Arcane was behind my cat. I dragged her inside and closed the door. I then locked it.\n\nBigger claws scratched and scratched and scratched. \n\n***BANG!*** \n\nNow, let me tell you about the bunkers. There is one pipe that connects to the rest of the bunkers, just in case the Arcane breaks in. It is just big enough for a human but smaller than an Arcane.\n\nI grabbed the two children, and told my wife to get into the pipe.\n\n***CRAA-AASH!***\n\nI got into the pipe and crawled in. I twisted myself into a position where I could look at the Arcane. However, my cat was in the way.\n\n“C’mon, Lee…”\n\nI crawled into my neighbour’s bunker. They all had the same distressed look. They knew it came. \n\n“So, er… it is inside your bunker, yes?”\n\nI checked the clock in my neighbour’s house. ***6:02.*** \n\nAfter about a couple of hours, it was 1 hour but it didn’t feel that long, I heard bangs and bongs coming from the pipes. I looked behind me. The Arcane was there. I grabbed my wife and two children and climbed up the ladder, opened the door and ran out. I didn’t think about the neighbours. The screams still haunt me. \n\nThe sun was rising from the horizon and I ran out of the house. The door was locked. I climbed over the fence and went to the beach (our houses were seaside homes). I leaned against the stairs. \n\nIn the distance, the Arcane came out and into the next home. \n\nI put my two kids on the ground and let go of my wife’s hand. I pulled out my hand gun and went in 144 Anios Street. However, I couldn’t be more prepared for what I saw..\n\nThe Arcane was nesting. Just like the conspiracy theory.\n\nI shot the two eggs. I am pretty sure only one of them died. The other was alive…\n\nIt seemed like the mother died.\n\nIt’s been 10 years. The baby Arcane ran. Who knows when it’ll come back?",

        "text": "I keep the doors shut in my flat. This is primarily practical (heat retention, which has become a more pressing need in recent months due to recent geopolitical issues) but also probably has more than a little to do with me and my brother being asked, many times, by my father if I had ‘been raised in a barn’ every time I left one open growing up. It reminds me of him, in easier times, by following the little rule.\n\nFairly normal thing, want to get it out of the way before we get into why this is causing a specific problem.\n\nEnter boyfriend. Similar ‘barn chat’ scenario. Though, he grew up really rurally so, frankly, I’m not entirely convinced he didn’t. His behaviour over the last few weeks also really convinced me that, whilst I love him, if these kind of habits are what living outwith a city does to someone then we are never moving so much as a foot out of here. Anyway, I guess that perception has been complicated somewhat. \n\nSo it’s really weird, and initially I was geared up to delve into relationship advice because it felt red-flag-adjacent at best and I didn’t know how the fuck to address it.\n\nBasically, we moved in together a few months ago. I basically packed up my own flat and rented it out (all above board, HMRC fully aware) and moved in. We haven’t been together that long, it’ll be a year in June (first Reddit relationship advice sin) but we’re both fully fledged adults looking for the same things. We have good jobs and minimal debt, and normal friends. Between us, we have two weird exes, so we’re both pretty attuned to spotting warning signs. I love him, we’re hitting 30 soon, we moved in together at the start of October.\n\nNaturally, as I’ve just moved in with my partner, things are *bliss*. It is a routine of breakfast, banging and foot massages. He tells me every day that he loves me, and (endearingly) that I am the most wonderfully weird person he has met (yeah, more on that later).\nApart from the weird pranks/ sociopathic idiosyncrasies I had noticed as of late, it was fine.\n\nSo, first time I noticed this was the start of January. Conceivably this had been happening since October, but it’s such a busy time around the festive period I’ve maybe been too preoccupied to see.\nIt was the 1st. I was hangover personified, sick with the flu, and so I was basically intending to lightly poach myself in a bath until this all blew over. The bath faces away from the door. At some point, I glance at the door because I’ve resolved to try and read a book instead of absently scrolling. \n\nAnd, for whatever reason, I just know he is behind the door. When you’re close to someone you get a real sense of them and the way they move (or don’t). I couldn’t see him, couldn’t see a shadow, but I knew it was him. \nI called out to him asking if he needed in (though of course unprepared to give up my bath unless his bowels were in dire shape). No response. Thought, ‘that’s fucking odd’. After a bit, I’m so uncomfortable that I have to get out the bath. In the time I was getting dressed that sense of him standing there faded away. I get out, and he is in the kitchen making tea. Whatever the vibes are for ‘I have been lurking outside a bathroom’ are, he was not giving them. \n\nOver the last few weeks, he’s doing it more and more. Every time we are together in the flat and in different rooms, I can feel him outside the door of the room I’m in. \nMore recently I thought because I was getting used to identifying it, because I could hear him breathe and the floorboards creak as he steps towards it, but sometimes it’s still just completely silent and it seems to almost escalate in how the atmosphere changes when it happens. An aura of tension surrounds the perimeter, ebbing and radiating into the air of any room I am in. It’s like whenever he’s behind the door then he’s like a coiled spring, something ready to strike. But to do what to me, and to what end?\nThe former were more infuriating, because obviously I can hear him and so he knows that *I* know he’s there, but the latter started to get pretty unsettling pretty fast. They made my skin crawl. I could never bring myself to open the door, it felt like opening a can of worms I wasn’t prepared to deal with. \n\nIt reminded me of when, as midst my brother used to tease me by standing outside my bedroom door late at night. But that was just trying to get a rise out of me in the usual back-and-forth ‘who can cause the more psychological damage’ games that siblings inevitably grow into. I talk about my brother a lot to him, keeping the memory alive, but I never mentioned about that. I talk about the funny things, the good things. I don’t talk about the weird stuff, it seems to intertwined with the period where he started to decline. \nOne of the last times I heard him speak was when he was remorseful for the pranks, maybe a week prior to him going missing, apologising and saying that he needed to stop.\nSo, whatever it is (and I had thought about *whatever* it could be) it wasn’t like a twisted ‘from the behind’ prank.\n\nThis was the same but different. It was a different context. It wasn’t dumb kids trying to freak each other out. \nAnd it was like at that point I realised ‘I am living with a man I have known less than a year, who is standing threateningly behind doors and I don’t know what he’ll do to me if I open them’.\n\nBut then I’d spend time with him and he was just… the normal dude I’d met. And those times outnumbered the doors. And it had only been a few weeks. So on the one hand I was with this great guy, and then on the other hand I was with some sort of maniacal reincarnation of a children’s game I’d rather forget about.\n\nIt came to a head yesterday. I was in the shower, and even with shampoo in my eyes I just felt it. I felt him standing there, through the door, breathing softly against the wood. And I was just fucking sick of it. And I’m fairly certain I can take him in a fight, because he’s just a fucking accountant doing Couch To 5k. So I got out, and in the most intimidating way a naked woman with ‘no more tears’ strawberry shampoo on can be, I opened the fucking door. \n\nWhat met me, was the same look on my boyfriends face that he got that time he won an argument about the best place to keep all the socks. He just looked really fucking… benignly pleased with himself?\n\nAnd he said, within the same heartbeat, ‘See! It’s fucking weird, isn’t it’\n\nSo at this point, the big scary unknown is just standing there in his pyjamas, holding a beer and his phone open on a news article about the downfall of Sunderland football club (obviously the standing was getting boring at some stage??) looking like he’s just won the worlds dumbest argument.\n\nAnd as I’m realising this, he is in tandem seeing a very scared, very angry version of his girlfriend about to jump over the threshold and strangle him.\n\nThere is, at that point, a pause that feels like it could stretch into eternity.\n\nI ask him, eventually, to kindly explain what the fuck he is talking about.\n\nHe looked more cautious then, doubtful. And then he gathered himself and said he could ask me the same thing and that it’s been driving him up the wall.\n\nCue me crying and hitting him with a damp hairbrush around the hall, him flinching trying not to get his tshirt wet, amusement turning to genuine concern as I upended the beer can over his head. I called him every name under the sun, I threatened to have him sectioned, I threatened to phone my mum, I threatened to phone *his* mum. And then he starts trying to get me to calm down, face somewhere between confusion and looking like he’s made some sort of massive error.\n\n‘So, you haven’t been doing this to me?’\n\nFucking of course I’ve not been doing this to you, John. There is only one lunatic lurking behind closed doors and it’s the one covered in Asahi Super Dry. \n\nHe becomes upset, remorseful.\n\nSo, apparently, at the start of January, every time he’s been playing computer games he thinks I’ve been standing outside the door spying on him. He’s got the sense that I’m angry at him, waiting for him, about to have a go with him. Naturally, not wanting to rise to it, he waits until I go away and when he finds me he just sees me doing something else, and there’s no anger incoming. It’s like I’ve not even done it.\n\nObviously, he now realised he can’t exactly say why he thought I was there. He just had a sense it was me. But he never heard me speak or do anything, never heard anything at all. And he now feels rather foolish and rather wet, because obviously I haven’t been. So he chooses to go on a snack run, leaving me in a blanket in the living room, to try and prevent his scared, nervous girlfriend from stabbing him with the kitchen utensils. \n\nAnd this would be fine, and I’d have left it at this being my slightly paranoid partner trying to get even just having a truly dumbass moment, except…\n\nExcept he said he only started doing this last week, around the 14th. And I had the flu on the 1st. And, thinking now, I was only able to hear him doing it in the last week or so. But I don’t know how to tell him this, I don’t know how to tell anyone. \nAnd I think of my brother, towards the end of it all, when he was sat crouched outside my bedroom door whispering that he was sorry. Except, I’m wondering if he did mean it like that. His exact words were just that he didn’t want this to happen anymore it needed to stop. \n\nAnd my boyfriend is still out trying buying every snack under the sun. I heard his car drive off. \n\nAnd someone is behind the living room door.",

It’s been thirty minutes. She probably chickened out.”\n\n“She’ll come. Just give her a little more time,” I muttered, staring hopefully out the window.\n\n“I’m giving her five more minutes. If she doesn’t turn up after that, we’re leaving. Deal?” Jake asked, extending a hand. \n\n“Fine. Whatever.”\n\nI begrudgingly shook it. \n\nI turned back to the window just in time to see a black sedan creeping up the driveway. \n\n“Told you.”\n\nJake rolled his eyes while I made my way to the door. I threw it open as Sidney approached the doorstep. \n\n“*You’re* late,” I said, crossing my arms and tapping my foot.\n\n“Fashionably, yes. Sorry, I overslept. Do you know how long it took to wash all that blood off? And don’t even get me started on that puddle of sludge on the floor.”\n\n“Okay, that’s fair. Come inside. We were just about to get going.”\n\n“Okay, sounds good. Hey, Jake.”\n\nHe nodded in response. \n\nWe proceeded into the living room. Jake and I took the couch, while Sidney chose an armchair. \n\n“So, fill me in. What are we up against? I know you said it’s a clown, but is it like Pennywise or is it just a regular circus freak?”\n\n“Pennywise is actually a pretty accurate description, unfortunately. I sent you the link to my Reddit account so you can catch up on my stories. The clown’s name is Mr. Pip, and he lives in this kid’s closet. He’s been gone for years, but he just showed back up. He was a character from the kid’s favorite TV show, but he’s not friendly. He’s all… wrong.”\n\n“Alright, do we have a game plan?” \n\n“Yeah, we’re gonna bash his brains in!” Jake proclaimed, brandishing a wooden baseball bat.\n\n“Jake, I told you to put that thing down. Go get the bowie knife from my room.”\n\n“The baseball bat would’ve been cooler,” he mumbled as he slunk away.\n\n“Also,” I said, turning to Sidney, “last time I checked, clowns aren’t big fans of taking a bullet to their noggin.”\n\nI put a finger gun up to my temple and pulled the trigger, playing dead with my tongue lolling out of my mouth.\n\n“You’re not wrong,” she giggled, flashing me a toothy grin. \n\nI blushed, unable to prevent the color from blossoming in my cheeks. \n\n“Okay, I got the bowie knife like you wanted, your majesty.”\n\n“Thank you, ya lowly peasant. Now, let’s get a move on. We don’t know how much time we have.”\n\n“Alright, where are we going?” Sidney asked.\n\nJake and I shot each other a glance. \n\n“Um. That’s a good question. We don’t know where this kid lives,” Jake admitted, staring at his feet.\n\n“I thought you two were about to leave. Where on God’s green Earth did you think you were going?”\n\n“Uh… we were just gonna figure it out as we went,” I murmured, wringing my wrists. \n\n“Yeah, because that would’ve worked *real* well. Does ‘this kid’ have a name?”\n\n“His name is Michael. His parents are Daniel and Anna. I didn’t include a last name in the story.” \n\n“Wait. I used to babysit for a kid named Michael a couple years ago. Those were his parents' names too. Come to think of it, I do remember them having this weird rule about not going in his closet.”\n\n“That can’t be a coincidence. Do you have any way to reach them?”\n\n“Yeah, I still have the dad’s phone number, actually. I’ll give him a call.”\n\nShe whipped her phone out of her pocket and called the number she had saved in her contacts. \n\n“It’s ringing… Hey, Mr. Peters! It’s Sidney, Michael’s old babysitter… Yeah! It’s good to hear from you too!... I’ve been great! How are Anna and Michael?... I’m so glad to hear that! Look, Mr. Peters, there’s something I have to talk to you about… Well, it’s really important. I can’t say it over the phone. Would it be okay for me to come over later?... Yeah, six would be perfect!... Awesome, see you then! Bye.” \n\nShe hung up and looked at us triumphantly. \n\n“Okay boys, get in the car. I’m driving.”\n\nIt was about a fifteen minute car ride. Sidney blasted Billie Eilish and Olivia Rodrigo the whole way there. Not my style, but it was better than giving Jake the aux. We rolled up to a quaint little home in an ordinary suburban neighborhood. Cookie-cutter houses lined the street. Everything was pristine. I couldn’t find a single blade of grass out of place. The perfect family environment. \n\n“Man, I thought this place would be a little… creepier?” Jake uttered, eyes glued to the home we’d just arrived at.\n\n“I don’t know what gave you that idea. You’ve read the story. They’re a normal suburban family. The only problem is the closet.”\n\n“I just texted Mr. Peters. Let’s go.”\n\nWe hopped out of the car and trailed Sidney up to the door. She knocked and we waited. A middle-aged man wearing glasses and a button-down shirt and tie answered. \n\n“Hey, Sidney. Good to see you again! Who are your friends here?”\n\n“This is Matt, and this is Jake.”\n\n“Nice to meet you, sir,” I said, stretching out my hand. \n\nHe shook it firmly, almost making me wince. \n\n“Nice to meet you boys. Come on inside. Just me tonight. Michael’s at a friend’s house and Anna is with her bunko group.”\n\nHe welcomed us into his home, and we followed him into the living room. There wasn’t much in terms of seating. Mr. Peters sat in an armchair, while the three of us crammed onto the couch. Of course, I got stuck in the middle. \n\n“Oh, how rude of me. Can I get you anything to drink?”\n\n“No, we’re fine, Mr. Peters, tha-”\n\n“Yeah, can I get a root beer?” Jake interrupted me.\n\n“No, you can’t get a root beer! You don’t ask for that when you go to someone else’s house!” I hissed, trying to keep my voice hushed. \n\n“Sorry, son. All out of root beer. Anything else I can get you?” \n\nJake’s cheeks flushed with color.\n\n“No, I’m good. Thank you though.”\n\nMr. Peters disappeared into the kitchen.\n\n“We are having a *serious* talk about manners when we get home.”\n\nHe re-emerged, juggling three waters and a glass of whiskey. \n\n“Oh, you didn’t have to do that! Thank you!” Sidney doted as he set down the refreshments. \n\n“Oh, please. After what a great job you did babysitting Michael? It’s the least I could do… So, excuse me if I’m being too forward, but why did you want to meet with me?”\n\n“We know about the clown in Michael’s closet. We have reason to believe that he’s back. That’s why I brought these two along,” Sidney said, nodded to Jake and me.\n\nMr. Peters’s demeanor instantly fell. His face went ghostly white. For a second, I thought he was going to pass out.\n\n“No. This can’t be happening. I thought we were rid of Mr. Pip,” he muttered, rubbing his balding head and pacing back and forth. \n\n“It’s okay, Mr. Peters. We’ll handle it,” I said, unholstering my .9 millimeter. \n\nHe gulped.\n\n“I-I don’t know. I don’t think you kids know what you’re getting into.”\n\n“I can assure you we do. We wouldn’t be here if we didn’t. Could you show us to Michael’s room?” I asked, standing up, while beckoning my companions to do the same.\n\n“Suit yourselves, but I am staying *far* away from that thing.”\n\nHe took us to Michael’s room and paused in the doorway. Sweat pooled under his armpits. We tentatively approached the closet. A chair had been wedged under the doorknob in a feeble attempt to trap the clown within.\n\n“So, uh, what do we do? Just wait for him to knock?” Jake asked, white knuckling my bowie knife.\n\n“No, that’ll take too long. We’re coming to him,” I said grimly. \n\nI tossed the chair aside and rapped against the closet door three times. It swung open, narrowly missing me. Inside was a magical world full of misshapen creatures of all kinds. The colors were all wrong. Purple grass swayed in the wind beneath a mustard yellow sky. A light breeze wafted from within. \n\nI glanced behind me to see everyone’s mouths hanging open like they were in a trance. Mr. Peters looked like he was going to collapse at any given moment, while my friends stared on in awestruck wonder. \n\n“Okay, are y’all ready?” \n\nJake and Sidney nodded, still gazing off into space.\n\n“Kids? Please be careful,” Mr. Peters squeaked, biting his nails.\n\n“Will do. Let’s go.”\n\nThe door slammed shut the moment we stepped inside. I drank in the impossible scene around us. Disfigured blue birds floated overhead, smiling down at us with shimmering rows of perfectly white teeth. A green elephant stomped along in the distance. Its trunk had been reduced to an eerily human-like nose. Orange and pink spotted deer pranced through the fields; on two legs. We even watched a grizzly bear take flight, massive reptilian wings sprouted from the back of its turquoise frame.\n\n“How is this real?” Sidney whispered as if speaking would attract the beasts’ attention.\n\n“I don’t know. How are we supposed to find Mr. Pip in all this?” Jake wondered, scanning the hills. \n\n“Well, that red path looks promising,” I said, pointing to a small road constructed with blood-colored bricks lying directly ahead.\n\n“Good eye little bro! I think you’re onto something.”\n\nWe followed the path in silence for what felt like an eternity, gawking at every strange whimsical creature along the way. We made slow progress, but eventually, we reached the end. A tall structure loomed before us, casting a dark shadow over everything surrounding it. It was a gray and black bouncy house. If Luigi’s Mansion was converted to a children’s attraction, this would be it.\n\n“A bouncy house? Of course. Where else would a creepy demon clown set up base,” Jake muttered, rolling his eyes. \n\n“L-ladies first,” I said, gesturing to the entrance.\n\n“Oh, no. *You* created this thing. It’s only right that you go first,” Sidney reasoned, motioning for me to lead the way.\n\nI sighed. \n\n“Alright, here we go.”\n\nThe plastic inflatable door squeaked as I pulled it open. We stepped inside and found ourselves in a gloomy castle-like room. Lanterns jutted from the walls, bathing the room in a dim orange glow. The walls were painted to resemble stone, poorly drawn gray cracks spider webbing throughout the room. A grand table, like the kind you’d see in a Viking longhouse, stretched most of the length of the room. Silver plates and chalices adorned its surface. Beneath it lay a dark purple carpet, outlined in gold, that ended at the foot of a black throne. Gray balloons protruded from the back like knives. And atop it… sat Mr. Pip. At his sides sat a legion of balloon dogs of all sizes. They snapped and snarled viciously, baring sharp pointed teeth. \n\nHe beamed at us from across the room, his nauseating toothy smile clearly visible even at that distance. That sinister grin sent a shiver up my spine. \n\n“Hello there, friends! Mr. Pip has been waiting for you!” \n\nThe elation in his voice sent a ripple of panic to my core. \n\n“It seems my pets are excited to see you! Why don’t you play with my good boys?”\n\nAt that, the beasts charged toward us. \n\nJake whipped out my bowie knife. Sidney produced a butcher knife from her belt. I pulled out my car keys. \n\n“How are these things not popping themselves with teeth like those?” Jake asked, slashing into a balloon Doberman.\n\n“Your guess is as good as mine,” I said, wrestling with a chihuahua. \n\n*Pop. Pop. Pop.* Jake and Sidney made quick work of the clown’s plastic dogs. They never stood a chance. Sidney finished off the last of what must have been at least fifty balloon animals, the remnants of their rubber bodies strewn around us like confetti. \n\n“How rude! Do you know how long it took Mr. Pip to blow up all those fucking balloons?! You’ve made Mr. Pip *very* angry,” he bellowed, leaping onto the table. \n\nHe crawled toward us on all fours like some kind of demented spider, allowing me a clearer view of his features. Mr. Pip radiated rage. His mouth hung agape as he crept closer, too many rows of jagged shark-like teeth bulging from his rotten gums. Foam dribbled from his lips like a wild animal. His face paint was cracked and chipping away. Black streams flowed down his cheeks like oil. His whole body was marred with deep scars and lacerations, some still fresh.\n\nSilverware crashed to the floor as Mr. Pip smacked it away. I watched helplessly as he scampered toward us, thundering forward like a rabid animal. My heart pounded. I was paralyzed with fear. I couldn’t move a muscle. Sidney slapped me hard across the face. \n\n“Matt, the gun! Shoot him!”\n\n“Oh, uh, yeah.”\n\nI fumbled with the .9 millimeter, struggling to unholster it. Mr. Pip lunged forward, flying through the air, heading straight for me. Sidney screamed.\n\n*Bang.*\n\nHigh-pitched ringing assaulted my ears. I opened my eyes. Mr. Pip’s tattered body lay crumpled on the floor before us. Thick black liquid oozed from a hole in his forehead. \n\n“You did it! Not a second to spare either,” Jake noted, gazing at the abomination that had already begun to liquify. \n\nSidney threw her arms around me. My face turned red. \n\n“Matt, you saved us!” \n\n“Aw, it was nothing.” \n\nJake made a kissy face at me. I glared at him, shutting him down before Sidney noticed.\n\n“I sure am glad that’s over. Circus popcorn and cotton candy later?” \n\nI narrowed my eyes at him.\n\n“What, too soon?”\n\n“Let’s just get out of…”\n\nI paused mid-sentence. It was light but I thought I could discern soft whimpering from across the room.\n\n“Do you guys hear that?” I asked, straining my ears. \n\n“Yeah. Let’s check it out,” Sidney responded, already heading toward the sound. Jake and I apprehensively followed behind her, brandishing our weapons. We anxiously approached Mr. Pip’s throne and peered behind it. A little blonde girl was crouched in the darkness. She was shackled to the wall with inflatable constraints. She shrieked upon noticing us.\n\n“Hey, hey, it’s all right. We’re not going to hurt you. We’re going to get you out of here. We’ll take you home,” Sidney cooed, cutting away the girl’s plastic chains. \n\n“I’m Sidney. This is Matt and this is Jake. What’s your name?”\n\n“Annie,” she mumbled, glancing up at us with tears in her light blue eyes. \n\n“What are we going to do with her?” Jake queried. \n\n“We’re going to take her somewhere safe. Somewhere she can play with other little girls and boys. Somewhere without *any* clowns. Isn’t that right, sweetheart?”\n\nShe nodded, hugging Sidney’s leg like her life depended on it.\n\n“We can figure out what exactly we’re going to do later. Let’s get out of here. This place gives me the creeps.” \n\nWe followed the brick path back to the closet door. Annie identified some of the strange creatures along the way, all her fear eventually dissipating. \n\n“That’s a blue jay,” she giggled, thrusting a finger at one of the nightmarish smiling birds hovering in the sky. \n\n“That’s a polka-deer and that one is an elecant.”\n\n“That’s very cool. We’re about to take you home now, Annie. You’ll be able to make lots of new friends there. Would you like that?” \n\nShe nodded and smiled from ear to ear, blonde curls bouncing up and down. \n\nAnnie took Sidney’s hand. We opened the door and returned to Michael’s room. Mr. Peters had remained rooted to his spot the entire time, nervously awaiting our return. He breathed a sigh of relief, the tension evacuating from his face. \n\n“I’m so glad to see you all again. For a second, I thought you were *him.* Is it, um, taken care of?”\n\n“Yeah. You won’t have to worry about Mr. Pip anymore,” I told him as Jake shut and locked the closet door. \n\n“Oh, thank goodness! You have no idea how much of a relief that is. There must be some way I can repay you. Oh. And who’s this? Hi sweetie.”\n\nHe waved at Annie. She hid behind Sidney.\n\n“No, no. We won’t accept any form of payment. Your safety is enough of a reward for us. This is Annie. She’s a, um, friend. Thank you for allowing us into your home. But if you’ll excuse us, we have to get going. We still have *a lot* of work to do.”",

        "text": " I lived on an island south-west of Canada and north-west of the USA. Both of the countries hadn’t claimed the island, so we just called it “USC” (United States of Canada). Very creative name, I know.\n\nWe celebrated different holidays very differently: one of the main holidays being Halloween. \n\nWe started at 11 PM, when we chucked candies out of the window and onto the streets. Then, we hid. When it struck midnight, the Day of the Arcane begun. \n\nFor 24 hours, we have to hide. Otherwise the Arcane would come for us. \n\nThe Arcane had a skull like a wolf, covered in flesh. It had no eyes and //its mouth had some sharp teeth. It’s body was just a ribcage and it had red stuff around it. It’s legs were thin and had three, big claws. Once again, it was covered in flesh. It had tan, red and white stubs instead of legs. \n\nThis story happened on Halloween 2013. I was 21 and had 2 children. My wife was 20 years old (we went to the same school). We chucked the candy out of the window as usual and went outside and into the bunker. We set up 4 sleeping bags and my two kids went to sleep.\n\nI got out my flashlight and got out of the bunker.\n\n*Were the doors locked?*\n\nI went to look. They had to be. I looked at the clock. ***11:51.*** Huh.\n\nI ran to the front door, and checked if it was locked. It was unlocked. I then locked it and went to the window. Curiosity peaked. I checked the clock. ***11:56.*** I did want to see it for myself - so I looked out of the window.\n\nI ducked.\n\nThe Arcane was there. I crawled onto the floor and into the kitchen. As quietly as I could, I opened the backyard window and closed it. I opened the lock on the bunker, got in, and closed it. I checked the clock on the wall. ***00:01.*** 23 hours and 59 minutes left. \n\nLet me tell you more about the Day of the Arcane. At least one person had to make a blood sacrifice, otherwise the Arcane would be “unsatisfied”. If it was unsatisfied, it would go on a rampage for 30 minutes after the day ended, destroying everything in it’s path. Including the bunkers.\n\nNobody knows where the Arcane came from. There are quite a few conspiracy theories, one of the most popular being that the Arcane swam from the coast of the USA or Canada and swam here. Apparently the Arcane is a female.\n\nIt might lay eggs.\n\nInside of the bunker, I heard claws scratching. Did I forget my cat? My heart lurched. I checked through the peephole inside of the bunker. My cat. I opened the door. The Arcane was behind my cat. I dragged her inside and closed the door. I then locked it.\n\nBigger claws scratched and scratched and scratched. \n\n***BANG!*** \n\nNow, let me tell you about the bunkers. There is one pipe that connects to the rest of the bunkers, just in case the Arcane breaks in. It is just big enough for a human but smaller than an Arcane.\n\nI grabbed the two children, and told my wife to get into the pipe.\n\n***CRAA-AASH!***\n\nI got into the pipe and crawled in. I twisted myself into a position where I could look at the Arcane. However, my cat was in the way.\n\n“C’mon, Lee…”\n\nI crawled into my neighbour’s bunker. They all had the same distressed look. They knew it came. \n\n“So, er… it is inside your bunker, yes?”\n\nI checked the clock in my neighbour’s house. ***6:02.*** \n\nAfter about a couple of hours, it was 1 hour but it didn’t feel that long, I heard bangs and bongs coming from the pipes. I looked behind me. The Arcane was there. I grabbed my wife and two children and climbed up the ladder, opened the door and ran out. I didn’t think about the neighbours. The screams still haunt me. \n\nThe sun was rising from the horizon and I ran out of the house. The door was locked. I climbed over the fence and went to the beach (our houses were seaside homes). I leaned against the stairs. \n\nIn the distance, the Arcane came out and into the next home. \n\nI put my two kids on the ground and let go of my wife’s hand. I pulled out my hand gun and went in 144 Anios Street. However, I couldn’t be more prepared for what I saw..\n\nThe Arcane was nesting. Just like the conspiracy theory.\n\nI shot the two eggs. I am pretty sure only one of them died. The other was alive…\n\nIt seemed like the mother died.\n\nIt’s been 10 years. The baby Arcane ran. Who knows when it’ll come back?",

        "text": "  Please let me sleep.\n\n\n  I think to myself as I look with frightened eye's at the alarm clock on my bedside table. 2:34 am. I get shivers all the way down my spine. I try to close my eye's again but I can't. I know what's in here with me, and I know it's watching.\n\n\n  When morning comes rolling around my body relaxes. How many nights has been like this? I don't know. I just want it to end.\n\n\n  I don't want to kill myself. No. That will be cowardly. Melatonin will work a little but the creature will just jerk me back away from my dreamland. Not that it matters. It affects my dreams too. \n\n\n  I go through work another day with bags underneath my eyes. My coworkers tell me I should maybe up the Melatonin. I just try to sleep in at lunch with my phone alarm at high volume that way I can get back to it. \n\n\n  Working stock in a grocery store at least let's me not think about going to bed at night. It frightens me. I take a bunch of 5 hour drinks to get me through.\n\n\n  That night I have a dream. I'm walking on a wooden plank bridge to a big pond. It's sunny. The sun glancing on the tree's telling you to not look at it or you'll hurt your eyes. I embrace the light and run into the pond feeling the cold water enveloping around me. I can't swim outside of my dreamworld but hear I can.\n\n\n  I laugh as i swim. Pushing my body with every stroke of joy I have. The water splashing my face is a delight. Then suddenly the sunlight that I was just embracing suddenly grows darker. \n\n\n  (No No) I think to myself as I look around the suddenly dark woods around me. My heart beating feverishly as I start to panic. Something big then brushes against my legs. I look afraid of what I might see and my heart drops as I see two shark fins swimming around the pond with me.\n\n\n  I try to swim back to the wooden bridge but now my arms feel like they have weights tugging at them. I'm thinking to myself, I don't want to die, i don't want to die.\n\n\n  As I now look up at the bridge which is not far from me I stop. Not that I can move I just can't. My body now feels like it's paralyzed all the way as I see a man covered in darkness with a black hat and jacket. The head that the hat covers looks up at me and waves. I then notice that the sharks were getting closer and I try to scream with all my might with no sound coming out. \n\n\n  I wake up covered in sweat as the sharks ate me. (What the hell was that?) I think to myself as go wash and dry the sheets. (I've never seen or encountered that before.) \n\n\n  The next night I went to bed again. I try my hardest to go to sleep. Eventually I do but something jerks me awake. I look around the darkness of the bedroom with my heart beating fast again as like the night before I feel paralyzed. \n\n\n  I look towards my closet and see that the outside doorknob is shaking. The closet door then slowly creaks open as all I see is more darkness. Then a petrified hand made of shadow reaches out and touches the doorknob. \n\n\n  It pushes the door open as I'm trying to wake myself up. Then a thought occured to me. Am I already awake? \n\n\n  I look in frightened terror as the thing comes out of my closet and walks towards me with it's feet burning the wood as it walks. As it stands on the edge of the bed it just looks at me.\n\n\n\n  I can't tell you for how long. All I know is that I was crying and wanting to turn away from this thing. Why? Why is it here torturing me like this? When will I get a good night's sleep?\n\n\n  The creature then moves away from the bed. It walks it's firery feet down back to the closet. With it's shadowed like hand it then grabs the doorknob and then closes the door. \n\n\n  When It was gone I got up. Turned on all the lights. It wasn't there. The footmarks that were it's pressence were also gone.\n\n\n  I told all my coworkers at work what happened. They reassured me that it was probably just sleep paralysis and maybe I just saw something in it that terrified me.\n\n\n  Later that night I surprised myself by finally going to sleep. Is my sleeping troubles gone? I ask myself with grate relief. I slept peacefully that night with great dreams with any horrid creatures getting me. \n\n\n  After a few days the bags under my eye's were gone. My coworkers were excited saying that I've been looking well and finally got a good night's sleep. I thanked each and every one of them for trying to help me. I'm glad i got good friends. \n\n\n  Update: While at the grocery store last night I was getting stuff needed for dinner. I was walking by myself in the parking lot. The light that I see everyday flickering that never gets fixed when I complain about it just started flickering fast.\n\n\n  As I put my groceries in the car and went in a sensation went through me. It was a feeling that I knew all to well and I was starting to feel afraid again. \n\n\n  When I looked at that flickering light I see the same creature that I saw in my bedroom. It was just looking at me with that terrifying stare as that light turned on and off. \n\n\n  Then it was gone and I started the car and sped home. I was anxious to go to my house and go to bed again. Now all I want to do is sleep.\n\n\n  ",

        "text": "Something mauled a kid. I don’t know what it was, still don’t to be honest with you. What I do know is I’ll be dealing with this until the day I die.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got the call a few months ago in the fall. I’m a park ranger and while the brighter side of the job has you talking to happy families. Helping send the wildlife back to areas safe from harm, there’s a lot to this career that can take a toll on you. This was one of them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI pulled into a clearing of a forest in New Hampshire. White pines and firs as far as the eye can see. Autumn made the hue of leaves turn to a carnival of colors as red maples glowed in the sunlight of mid day. It was walks like these that made me take this job in the first place. I even wanted to be a Park ranger when I was a child. Back when I thought all you did was get lost in the woods, hanging out with bears stealing baskets. It had a way of making you forget it all, taking in the view. Almost made forget what I was heading towards. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe crime scene was at the end of a rocky ravine. Trickles of water spattered on the floor, a back drop to the poor kid covered in a bloody tarp. Ill spare you the details but I saw the photos sent for the report. Even saw the boy myself. It was awful. Whatever did this ate its fair share. Everything not consumed came in tears with ill intent, scattering his remains around the woods. The animal must have taken its time shredding him to pieces. If there is a God I hope that boy died quickly. The more I read from the Coroners report however, the less I think it’s likely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe parents were there to identify the body. The mothers screams seeing her child like this could be heard for miles. It sounded like gutting her alive was preferable to the pain she suffered now. Ugly crying with snot dripping as a dutiful husband stood by. Him using whatever strength he had left to hold her up, back from grabbing the pieces of her boy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFederal officers came in to assist us. All of us there were doing the best we could to ignore her screams of agony and get to work. Photos, collecting evidence and the like. Believe it or not people think we don’t care. Unfortunately most of us do. I even know how easy it would be for it to be your nephew or brother in that spot. Seeing his face ripped on the floor, it can keep you up at night. That doesn’t matter though. The parents crying would be far more distraught if they saw you weeping to. So you bite your lip, smoke, have a quick cry in the car when no ones looking. Otherwise, you Just get back to work. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the middle of the commotion, I saw my old boss. He’s an older man, stone cut face from from the wind over years of hiking. A stocky build with broad shoulders, yet held by the hunched, curving spine of a man who could say he was too old for this. The pot belly earned from long hours looking over files at the local diner hung over his trousers. Longer hours were spent drinking a fifth in his car to keep the nightmares away. He looked over the scene with that gravelly face deep in thought.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“O’Connell!” I waved him down, stepping around the photographers and family to reach him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Jameson, good to see you.” He gave me a nod and turned away from the scene. I followed after as it was clear he had something to tell me, away from the mourning couple near. There was something to show me as well. He pulled a Manila folder from his wool lined jacket and handed it to me. “Looks like your moving up in the world, this your jurisdiction now?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Yep just moved me over to Hillsborough. What are you doing over here, I though you worked back in Concord?” I took the folder from his hand. I had a hunch of what was in it and I wasn't looking until he asked me to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I do. A long time ago this was where I started. Back when you could have a beer at lunch and nobody would bat an eye. I got a call about the situation and knew I had to come. This isn’t the first time a kids been taken.” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI opened the folder and sure enough there it was. Black and white photos of missing children in the woods. Ripped to pieces, entrails strung among the trees. Viscera which even in the faded ink was enough to make you sick.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy old boss continued. “We’ve taken trips to find it. No ones gotten a confirmed sight of the thing, let alone a kill. Sent thirty men, fifty yards apart with enough ammo to put down an elephant. All we got was two casualties and a scream that still gives me nightmares. The old folks thought it was some kind of demon. A curse on the white man for what our ancestors did to the natives when he sent them on the trails of tears. Can’t say I blame them. I’ve seen how they live out west. We shipped blankets full of small pox and slaughter, they send a monster in return.” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“You sound like you believe it.” I tried to joke, yet any humor fell flat on the stone face that glared with a knowing tired.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe stepped closer, pointing at the photos , staring into my soul unblinking. “I had to bury those children. Put on the rubber gloves to pick up the bits. Parents didn’t have the stomach for it and couldn’t afford a coffin. The fear in those dead eyes haunt me in my dreams. Now if you don’t want to do the same, here’s what I recommend.” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe gave me a list of instructions, the mother sobbing behind us now turning to an exhausted whimper. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy pickup drove deep in the woods in wake of a setting sun. The camper shell and some tie downs kept the load I was hauling as even then it bounced while I drove down the beaten trail. The farther I went the less it looked like a road at all. First it was a lane, then it was a foot path, then there was none at all. I hopped out of my vehicle as the sky turned from crimson to a cool blue. The last vestiges of light shimmering in the trees. I thought I was lost despite following his directions with certainty. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Fifty miles off the highway you follow the runners trail. When it ends take a look around. If the woods are ready for you, they’ll make room.” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn’t know what he was talking about. Anyone else would have written him off as a loon. He trained me well however. Back when I was fresh out of high school kicking myself over a girl. He showed me the trails, taught me all the rules, even showed me how to shoot. My father died in the desert back in Iraq. This old man was closest thing to a dad I had. All in all, I owed him a little faith. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI looked back at the gifts he left in my front seat. A pack of smokes and a flask with a small note unfolded. Reading it over again I felt the mix of pride and pity emanating from his words. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\~I’d go with you kid but I'm too old. Seen too many corpses of my own. Just do exactly as I told you and you’ll be alright. Help yourself to these when your done. Congratulations kid, you’re going to need them.\\~\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI looked around, playing with the pack of smokes. I flipped the lucky cigarette upside down like my uncle showed me when I was young. Third from the left. We all know smoking is terrible for you. Even so, its funny the things that old men leave to those behind them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI looked up, just about to head back thinking this was for nothing. Sure enough however I found what he was after. The thicket in front of me, a wall of saplings and branches now had a break. It started small yet as the sun went down and wind began to swell. The branches creaking as they gave way with all manner of twists and turns. It started slow. Slow enough you would have mistaken it for just the wind. In minutes however the way was clear. The very grass and weeds lay down along the path, inviting me further in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hopped back in my truck and drove slow. I barely pressed the gas as the clearing squeaked me inside. I always heard the forest was alive. A great organism among the cells of bark and pine. I thought him drunk yet the old man was right. The woods made way to let me in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the end of the path I found a clearing hid from civilization. There in my high beams was a cement flight of stairs. No debris from a house undone. No foundation to explain it being there. A lone flight of stone steps railed with an iron banister, curling into the night above. The steps ended sharp as they reached into the sky. Broken beams of Iron pointing like curled fingers to the stars glimmering high above.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe air had a severance to it, like stepping before an ancient temple. My hands shook as I stood before the stairway. Nothing prepared me for what I’d gotten into. And yet keeping my composure I walked around to open up the back. A corpse of a whole pig lay stretched across the truck bed. It’s stomach hung open in flaps gutted as its blood seeped onto the tarp below. With all the strength I could muster I pulled on the tarp as it slid across the bed of my vehicle. It took five minutes before my efforts answered with the heavy thump of the carcass landing in the woods. Thank God the stink was minimal, the heat from the vehicle only beginning to let it turn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI dragged it still further before the steps, those stairs drawing me in with a strange magnetism. Inviting to see them more as the contrast of that cold stone was so stark to the woods around. Without thinking my hands even reached for it, yet the old mans words echoed in my head back from when I started. He was half drunk on a Night watch for poachers back then, me too green to find it odd or even care. When he drank the demons would come to haunt him, or maybe they haunted him still. The man only drawing from his flask to numb their fingers on his shoulders. In one of his rants he told me plain. “If you ever see a flight of steps here, don’t even think of touching them. You’ll never leave the woods alive.” He pulled deep from the very flask now sitting in my car muttering to himself. “Im sorry Phil. I shouldn’t have left you there to die.” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI never questioned it then. Now I saw everything with a cold certainty. I snapped back to my senses, pulling my hand away. I climbed in my truck, headlights glaring over the pig carcass before stairs that felt more like an ancient altar. I should have left like I was told. “Leave The pig in front and don’t come back till winter.” Those were my instructions. That dead kid was still inside my mind however. The sad look in my friends face as remorse weighed on his soul. I wanted to give those parents peace, everyone of them. My hands gripped firm the weight of a cold iron. A Black and gold revolver, with caliber large enough to kill a bear. I waited for that predator to snap at my bait, Sure I was the one to put him down. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI turned off my engine, quiet to lure him in. For an hour I rolled my thumb along the chamber of that gun. Waiting for the revenge I would take for all the murders it left behind. So sure that I would be their avenger. Certain that my act was one of justice and not of pride. Its funny, I only ever shot that thing at cans. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe loudest scream I ever heard shattered the glass around me. My alarm blared filling those woods with the chaos that ensued. I screamed, covered in the broken bits of my windshield, but I did not run away. I did not cry or cower. Terrified still my actions were that of pure adrenaline. Stepping out of the safety of my vehicle I screamed into the night. Raising my firearm, blind and deaf to all that ensued. I had no idea where it came from, yet I fired that pistol in those woods. Again… and again… and again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSmoke from the burning powder filled my nostrils. Flash from a hot barrel blinding as echo and recoil had me stumble. My ears rang as the blasts mixed with the siren now behind me. I fired until my chamber went dry, and that was when it hit me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI turned to see an open hand of black across my face. Its claw whisped like smoke and shadow. Its color making even the night around us look bright in its comparison. The heavy thump of its strike knocked me down as though I’d been a child. My skull cracked against the ground and all went black around me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I awoke there was blood across my eyes. Everything hurt as the world spun in my concussion. I reached for my face out of instinct as its painful sting awoke me. My fingers felt wet meat , dripping with crusted blood. I sat up unsure why I could not see. One eye was full of haze and other I could not open. It wasn't long till I discovered I had no eye at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe carcass was gone. Whatever that thing was had spared me, yet did not leave me unharmed. A warning to remember my hubris came in the surgery room, hours after crawling into my ride, finding my way home. Four long fingers on an open claw cut across the left side of my face. The index took my eye as its smallest left a scar across my neck. The last missing the vein that surely would have killed me. Forever I will be ugly. The scars from the flesh it tore unable to heal little more than the four canyon scrapes grinning like a Glasgow smile. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI still work. Still walk through those woods. Still even make that drive once every season to that forbidden staircase. Dragging a pig or deer sometimes onto the dead grass that lay before it. Now I treat the place with the reverence it deserves. Leaving whatever roams these woods to its eternity. Ever since there hasn’t been a single mauling. Just as there wasn't one in the years before. Some might call it sacrifice. Some ritual to appease an ancient God. Me, I don’t know what to think. I just don’t want to see anymore dead kids. \\`\\`",

        "text": "Near me there’s a town at the bottom of a lake. It’s deep enough that you need proper gear to dive and see it, but it’s interesting enough that some people will travel for it. To them it’s a tourist attraction, an underwater ghost town that makes for an interesting story. \n\nTo my grandfather it’s the town he was born in, and a place he never wanted to go back to.\n\nThey Got Religion there many years before Grandpa was born, and his description of it sounds like what I would stereotype as an isolated, rural religious town. “Town” might be generous - a few hundred people at most who had a distrust of outsiders and a deep love of their faith. Their town had only one church, and every Sunday every able-bodied man, woman, and child went. And thanks to their preacher, everyone was able-bodied. \n\nThe Preacher - Grandpa never told me his name, always just called him Preacher - was a fixture in the town, mostly seen when his services were needed. Sunday’s were preaching days and were multi-hour affairs. Baptisms and funerals were staples of course. But he was loved most for his faith healing. \n\nEveryone, at some point, gets sick. Small fevers, stomach aches, fatigue - these could be handled with care from family members, some rest, and maybe even a small visit from Preacher to say a prayer and lift your spirits. But most everyone, certainly all of the adults, talked about a Sickness with a capital S. A sickness that gave them a feeling of mortality and an overwhelming urge to visit the Preacher. \n\nOnly once did my grandpa tell me about his visit to Preacher. Grandpa was still young when he got Sick. Like others, this Sickness filled my Grandpa with a recognition of his mortal frailty. As the days progressed and his condition worsened the urge to ask Preacher for help grew, as did a sense of faith that Preacher could fix it. \n\nGrandpa eventually asked his family to bring him to the church, and Preacher had them sit Grandpa with his back to the altar, facing the entrance of the church, then asked his family to leave. A sense of calm came over him as his family walked away, but once they left the calm began to be replaced with a sense of dread. It grew as Preacher stepped to the other side of the altar from Grandpa, talking about faith, how God worked in mysterious ways and only by trusting while not knowing could we truly have faith. \n\nPreacher told Grandpa to keep his eyes toward the front and asked if he understood the importance of doing so. Grandpa nodded, mute, butt his confirmation was all Preacher needed. Others had spoke about their faith being restored at this point, Preacher’s talk of trust opening their eyes to what faith really meant, but Grandpa said this was the first time he was filled with doubt. It wasn’t a warm, loving embrace of the Holy Spirit that kept his eyes forward, but terror, the certainty that if he saw what was about to happen he would die.\n\nA sound like the click of a lock came from behind, almost making him jump, and the feeling of a presence, of *pressure* filled the room. His heart beat faster as Preacher walked around the altar, Grandpa swearing he heard not the sound of footsteps, but slithering. \n\nThe other townsfolk talked about losing time as Preacher touched them, of becoming so overwhelmed by holy light that they lost track of their senses and came to minutes or hours later. Grandpa reckons he passed out from sheer terror. \n\nWhen he woke he no longer felt sick, felt the best physically he had that he could remember, but the dread remained. Preacher was there, smiling at him and telling him that his faith had made him whole. \n\nThat night Grandpa left town. While he lived there, Grandpa never heard about anyone moving in, nor did anyone move out. In fact, while the occasional traveler might pass through he couldn’t remember a time that any resident took even a short journey out of town. Growing up people joked the town belonged to them and they belonged to the town. Grandpa hadn’t understood the significance of that until he left.\n\nIt began when he crossed the border of the furthest farm and began his ascent out of the valley, unofficially the marker that denoted the edge of the town. As Grandpa walked out with no intention of coming back a feeling began to gnaw at him. An urge to turn back and go home that grew stronger the further he walked. The night was cool, the walk easy, but as Grandpa got some hours away he broke out in a sweat. It felt like his fever was returning, and it was followed shortly by a return of his cough. A wet, hacking cough that Grandpa knew was the return of his Sickness, and with it the urge to go to Preacher returned. \n\nGrandpa said this time he recognized it not as his will, but a will belonging to something else. A foreign presence trying to force him back. He fought a war in his mind, his will forcing one foot in front of the other and the Other’s will trying to force him back. It weakened his muscles, stole his breath, threatened him with that mortality he’d become acutely aware of in the last few days. But the further he got, the more that pressure weakened. Slowly, very slowly, his own strength returned. His breathing became easier. Every step he won made the next step just a little easier to take.\n\nIt was sunup by the time the Other left his mind, and it was well into the morning by the time Grandpa made it to the next town. He was dehydrated and fatigued, but said his mind had never been as clear as it had on this day. A kind family took him in, gave him food, drink, and a place to stay in exchange for some work on their farm. \n\nHis dreams that night were vicious. He dreamed of his church, his family and the whole town inside while outside a heavy rain fell. Preacher led them in song and prayer as the water rose, slowly burying the town. As the church filled and the songs ceased Grandpa dreamed that Preacher was staring right at him, and Grandpa knew this was his fault.\n\nGrandpa hadn’t originally intended to stay in that town long, wanting to put more distance between him and his hometown, but when he woke that second day the dream stayed with him. An intense feeling of guilt and the need to check on his family warred with a desire to never go near that town again, but the dream also gave him a weird sense of certainty that he was no longer in danger. \n\nIt was a week in before that certainty was validated. A traveler was passing through and brought the strangest news - the little valley he had called home had flooded. A downpour had started some days before, rain falling day and night until the valley had nearly filled up. A lake now stood in the spot where his home had once been.\n\nDiving equipment wasn’t easily accessible in Grandpa’s childhood, so it would be many years before someone swam to the bottom of that lake and checked out the town that had been there. Grandpa was scared and eager to hear what they’d find.\n\nThe first divers reported finding the town, but not the residents. The buildings and some personal effects were intact, but no sign of bodies. Some speculated animals got to them, while others thought maybe they managed to get away before the flood took them all. Grandpa didn’t think either of those explained the disappearance of the people.\n\nGrandpa ended up settling just one town over from where he was born. He got married to a nice lady, my grandma, and built a comfortable little life for him and his family. Each of his children stayed, and their children too. Grandpa joked that our family had never been much for traveling unless absolutely necessary.\n\nIn the last year though, Grandpa’s health got worse. It wasn’t the same Sickness from his youth, but a Sickness all the same. He confessed to me that as his health deteriorated the dreams returned. Sometimes it was the dream of the flood, but more often it was a simple dream of Preacher, beckoning Grandpa to come home and be healed. \n\nOne night, Grandpa disappeared. His car was home and no bag had been packed. The police were called, friends and family went looking for him, but no sign of him was ever found; it was like he simply vanished. Our family mourned and a nice funeral was held where the family priest talked about Grandpa being in a better place. \n\nI, too, mourn for Grandpa, but for maybe a different reason than most. I think his hometown finally reclaimed its last resident.",

        "text": "Ah yes clones, duplicates, doppelgangers or whatever you want to call it, \n\nJust like the Clones from Star Wars: Clone Wars, the Rick and Beth Clones from Rick and Morty, or the Spiderman Clones made by Doc Ock, and it's mind boggling science behind it which baffled scientists that it could be achievable if the technology is advanced enough to be able to duplicate cells in mere seconds, but what if at some point you start to realize if you are one.\n\nHi I'm Andrei (16m) and going to try to keep my personal life a bit classified to everyone reading this.\n\nI live in a suburban neighborhood in East Asia, after the terrifying experience i had in 2016 when Hurricane Yolanda hit the country with strong winds and heavy rain which destroyed our house, but yeah i live in a middle class household, my school is just a 10 min drive away from where I live, i live with 2 of my youngest siblings, my mother is a breadwinner of the family and my father quit his job abroad and i take care of four dogs, some fish and birds. \n\nOk enough chit chat and let's continue the story. At the beginning of September in 2022, i have been getting ignored and avoided by my classmates lately and i asked one of my friends,\n\n\"you guys weren't like this before what's wrong, did i do something wrong to offend you guys in any way?\"\n\nOne of them said \"you followed us again!\", \n\n\"what?\"\n\n\"Yeah, we saw you following us again, you were walking at first then you started sprinting and when we turned around you vanished\"\n\n\"But I immediately went home after the last class\"\n\n\"We have pics and video evidence of you chasing us\" \n\nWhen I looked at the photos and videos, i couldn't believe my eyes, it was me but the videos and photos were a bit blurry so i couldn't see it properly but still, it really is me, it was wearing the hoodie but it had no bag.\n\nI was confused and shocked by what i saw, and my class president said that she already reported it to the principal and now I'm being asked to explain why I'd follow them again even though i wasn't there.\n\nSo there i went and i didn't expect my dad to show up, he had that look of confusion too, so i answered a few questions, gave them proof that i was at home playing games on my phone and what not, and they believed it, so she called our class president and told her everything and she apologized from what she said earlier and must have mistaken me for someone else that day. \n\nBut deep inside i knew that she wouldn't accept what she heard so she still kept ignoring me and so did the rest of my classmates but good thing i still have friends from my class that believed i was innocent and one of them showed that i was online in a game at 4:30 pm. \n\nSo i showed it to my classmates and they believed me, and so did my class president so they all forgave me from what happened and said that they must've seen someone else.\n\nAfter that I kept on thinking on my way home \"how was that possible, i was home by the time school was over, there's got to be an explanation for this?\" \n\nBut then just across the street right by the metal workshop, i saw a hooded figure with the same designs as my hoodie that i was wearing at the time, buying some metal sheets, as he looked in my direction i was surprised to see that it was me, the same face shape, the same scars on the right hand, and so i chased him and just as soon as he turned a corner he disappeared like thin air.\n\nWhen i was at home i couldn't stop thinking about him, i didn't sleep that night, but as a highschool student it's basically normal for us students to sleep late and just like one, i got used to not sleeping early.\n\nOn the night of Feb 24 2023 after prom night, i tried to walk home when i was hit by a motorcyclist and was sent to the nearest hospital.\n\nAfter a whole month of being in a coma i finally woke up to my parents sobbing and my siblings asleep on the chairs along with a bandaged right eye, they were both worried and scared that they thought that i was going to die.\n\nWithin those months i asked my parents for my phone and it was a good thing i put it in the left pocket of my bag before i left after prom, it was still in good condition.\n\nOn my phone it was spammed with quite a lot of messages from my classmates with again pics and videos of me being in a restaurant, in a park, but the most terrifying of it all was that they took a pics of me just sitting in my seat in class and some other photos of me outside of the school campus.\n\n\"What the hell is going on?\"",

        "text": "I know there are dozens of stories about the Hungry Man that you’ve probably heard if you’ve ever worked in fast food. Most of them are probably lies. But that doesn’t mean he’s made up. This is the no-bullshit truth of my encounter with him back in the early 2000s.\n\nI’m 5’2, and back then I weighed maybe 90 pounds. People called me a chihuahua. I was the youngest female manager in my region, and I ran a tight ship. I expected everyone to do their jobs, but I was fair with the scheduling, and if someone needed to pick up a shift, I usually took it myself. \n\nIn January, we got hit with a brutal storm in the middle of cold and flu season. I lived close to the restaurant, so I was able to make the short drive in, but half of my coworkers called out. I probably should have just closed down, but that wasn’t in my nature. We ended up with three workers, two cooks plus me, so I made the decision to close the drive through and work the register myself, dine-in only.\n\nThe Hungry Man came in five minutes after we opened. \n\nHe was six feet tall and ungodly thin, practically a walking corpse. I couldn’t have told you his age. Maybe 30, maybe 40. He definitely had the weird stretch marks on his neck, just like everyone says.\n\nHis walk was labored as he paced to the counter, shivering and tracking snow behind him. \n\nI said my usual greeting, and the man opened his shaking hand, dropping two crumpled, wet, dollar bills on the counter.\n\n“Small fry,” he whispered, his chapped lips cracked and bleeding (yes, we served fries in the morning. Burgers too.)\n\n“Anything else?” I asked, trying to stay smiling. \n\nI felt bad for the guy. He was clearly starving, but he shook his head and repeated, “Small fry.”\n\nI definitely tried to sneak him an extra fry or two as I got the order ready. He took the bag without meeting my eyes, then walked slowly outside, into the falling snow.\n\n“You ever see that guy before?” I asked the cooks, but they both shrugged.\n\nConsidering the weather, we did decent business. Even in a blizzard, people still need to eat. The morning passed pretty normally. We made extra coffee. Outside, the snow kept piling up.\n\nThen at lunch, the Hungry Man came in again. At first, I didn’t recognize him. Because he wasn’t thin anymore. He looked like a normal-weight guy, kind of hot, even. His walk was stronger now and more confident as he approached the counter. \n\nI would have just assumed he was a totally different person, except those distinctive marks on his neck were still there. Definitely stretch marks, just like my sister got when she had her twins.\n\n“Medium fry,” he said, his voice a little more sure this time.\n\n“Sure,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady. I was a little freaked out, but honestly still convinced somehow that this was the first guy’s brother or something. I handed him the bag and he left.\n\nAfter that, the storm got worse. By 4:00, the clouds were so think it felt like night outside, and no customers were coming in anymore. At some point, one of the cooks told me he was leaving. A few minutes later, the other left without even telling me.\n\nI should have closed, but like I said, that’s not who I was. We’d banked a decent amount of food on the warmers, and I figured I’d at least keep the doors open for a few more hours to eke out a little more revenue.\n\nAt around 6:00, outside was pitch black. The Hungry Man walked back in. He was fat now, maybe 350 pounds of lard. Same marks on his neck, same blank stare. No question it was the same dude. He wobbled up to the counter, covered in snow.\n\n“Large fry,” he said, his voice deeper than before. My heart beat fast in my chest, and I tried not to meet his eyes. He looked past me at the quiet, empty kitchen. “All alone,” he said.\n\nI headed back to the kitchen and put together a large fry. When I came back to the counter, I found him at the counter. He had picked up a handful of ketchup packets and was popping them into his mouth, whole, chewing, and swallowing them, wrappers and all.\n\n“So hungry,” he said, as I tried not to drop the fries. He looked back at the kitchen again. “All alone,” he said again, and a chill ran through me. I’d ignored bad vibes a couple of times in high school and paid a steep price. After that, I’d promised never to put myself in a dangerous situation with a guy ever again.\n\n“We’re actually closing soon,” I said, almost whispering. \n\nHe took a step toward me. There was something unnatural about the way he moved. Like, he wasn’t *actually* as fat as he looked. More like a thin guy in a pillow suit. He didn’t wobble like he should have, and he was *fast.* \n\n“All alone,” he said again. “So hungry.”\n\nAnd then he smiled at me in a way I’d never seen before. Like–his mouth shouldn’t have been able to stretch that wide. \n\n“Let me get you a couple more things,” I said. “On the house.”\n\nI headed back to the kitchen, thinking I’d grab some more fries, maybe a few burgers from the warmers. But something in me whispered *keep walking.* So I did. I headed past the kitchen and back into the storage area. I was running now. There was a service entrance in the back, and I bolted through it, out into the raging snow. I didn’t stop sprinting until I reached my car.\n\nI fumbled with the keys as the storm raged around me. Over the howl of the wind, though, I began to hear the thump thump of heavy steps. I couldn’t see anything through the screaming snow, but I could tell I wasn’t alone in the parking lot.\n\nFinally, I got the car door open and jumped inside. And then my heart practically stopped. The entire passenger seat was filled with fast food wrappers. Not just from our place, but from all around the neighborhood. Taco Bell, McDonald’s, Dairy Queen. He must have been hitting them up all day. \n\nI fucking screamed, but I didn’t lose my head. I jammed the keys in the ignition. Thank god my engine actually started. As my lights came on, the beams illuminated the service door, and I saw him there, somehow even bigger now. The door had busted off its hinges and lay at the ground by his feet. He was holding a foil wrapped burger, watching me curiously.\n\nThen he shyly waved and went back inside.\n\nI heard a few days later that one of the girls at Arby’s never made it home that night. People figured she got lost in the storm, maybe had her car go over a bridge or something. But they never did find her. It was like she’d just vanished, bones and all.\n\nI put in my notice a few days later. They offered me more money, opportunities for growth, you name it. They asked if I was going to a different restaurant. I just told them I was done with fast [food](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarymaxx/comments/zwo5o8/welcome_to_the_world_of_scarymaxx/).",
