        "text": "So, this story comes from my mother about some friends of hers in Holland. I apologize for the weakness of the maliciousness (if any), but I think the story to be a cute one and think it needs to be told regardless. Let me know of a better place to post it if need be.\n\nThey are an elderly married couple who have lived in the same apartment in Den Hague for over forty years now, and unfortunately he is now afflicted with what I would guess to be mid-level dementia. For many years now, he has routinely gone to the market to get groceries for the week, using a list that has been prepared at home for very strict menus that they live by. He has been doing the cooking all of this time, but due to his dementia he has a tendency now to forget where he is in the preparation, so food has a tendency to get burned, or not cooked all the way through. His wife just calmly eats the food regardless of how has been prepared. He is, of course, embarrassed about his situation, and gets angry when he realizes others have noticed his affliction.\n\nHe now also has a problem in performing he shopping each week for food, forgetting to purchase items that are on the list he has in his hand. As such, he is now not allowed to prepare the meals in the house or shop for the food. She does it all now. Which means a lot of the meals are quick-preparation style things that are basically the equivalent of TV dinners. However, she still lets him help out in the kitchen when she is preparing things. Which is where we get into the compliance... whether it be malicious or otherwise...\n\nThey are cooking one evening, and she realizes that one of the pans that she is cooking in needs to have the heat turned down on it. So she asks him to do so. However, apparently in Dutch the phrase she used to ask him to do so literally translates out to \"lower the pan\". \n\nSo he does.\n\nBy taking the pan and placing it on the floor.\n\nShe sees what he has done, can barely contain herself because she realizes why he has done it (literal interpretation instead of reading the expression of what should have happened), gets the pan back on the burner at a lower heat to cook, then retires to another room for a moment in order to quietly laugh to herself at the events that transpired.",

        "text": "Hello again, I [posted]( https://old.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/5zdgna/manager_overrides_it_guy_resulting_in_paid_hour/) here a year ago and wanted to share another malicious compliance at the same job; QA this time instead of management.\n\nI have to document every action I took on the machines for if the machine breaks again the next tech will want to know what’s already been tried and for tracking what I do with the time I’m being paid for. I keep these explanations technical and free from any speculation or emotion. After this method worked to get me perfect scores for years a QA guy comes and tells me that their marking down my ticket because it is “too short.” This is no good because it impacts my raise and bonuses if any. I ask him if I failed to document anything, he confirms I didn’t miss anything, if there were additional tests I could’ve run that would have been relevant, once more I did all the appropriate tests.\n\nMe, “How do you want me to expand on my tickets?”\n\nQA1, “We just need them to be longer.”\n\nMe, “Longer how?”\n\nQA1 “Just put more into them.”\n\nFuck this guy, the horse he rode in on, his team, and the horses they rode in on.\n\nThe compliance is where I take my usual quick and professional explanation of what I did that used maybe 40 words and turn it into 500+ words by eliminating all technical jargon and imagining explaining what I did to a toddler; I also add in completely irrelevant statements about how a problem is bad and when it is resolved that it’s good.\n\nA week later a different QA guy comes over to ask me what the fuck about going full baby mode with my tickets, I point out my last audit. He tells me to keep it technical which I counter by pointing out that I had been until they asked for me to put more into the tickets.\n\nQA2, “Well, can you shorten your tickets?\n\nMe, “Shorten it how?”\n\nQA2, “Keep it technical.”\n\nMe, “If I keep it technical they’re too short, you can’t have it both ways.”\n\nFrustrated, he goes away then comes back later with a reversal on the previous decision and a personal plea to go back to the original ticketing style as soon as possible. I did and I am back to getting perfect scores.",

        "text": "So this was probably 5 years ago when I was a junior in college, I was working for a big everything retailer we'll call \"Sprawl-Mart\" I was working as a \"Courtesy Clerk\" which roughly translates to cart monkey. Now I had this one manager let's call her \"T\" she was over the entire front end including the carts. \n\n\n\n\nThere was this one day in particular where I was working a 8-5 shift with no help whatsoever. I repeatedly asked for just someone to cover for me to at the very least take my lunch even if I couldn't take my 15 min breaks. I was brushed off by T \"Oh we're busy inside right now\", \" we'll get you in a bit\" etc. \n\n\n\n\nWell 4pm rolls around still no break, no help whatsoever. I go inside and tell T that I'm just going to have to take my break and leave right after since they never got anyone to cover. (At this point it was my second job with Sprawl-Mart so I'd already learned record ALL interactions with management) T tells me flat out \"Its not my responsibility to give you your breaks. You need to be managing your own\"\n\n\n\n\nAfter this talk with her that's just what I did. Every day I worked I took my hour lunch break followed by my 2 15 min breaks back to back all within the last hour and a half of my shift. After which I would clock out and go home. I don't think she ever noticed honestly and I was only there for another 2 months after that before finding a newer better job, but you best bet that I enjoyed doing my weekly grocery shopping while being paid to do it.",

So, Monday she came to my boss with a hand written resignation letter stating that she won't continue to work on her schedule(the only one she has) and her effective resignation day is Thursday (Yes, three days notice). My boss tried to explain her that If her last working day is Thursday, then she should change her effective resignation day to Friday. Before, he could finish his sentence, she interrupted him and said with arrogance \"Oh, It doesn't matter\". \n\nMy boss stayed quiet and left her mistake to run course. Tuesday and Wednesday come and she doesn't show up or call. Thursday comes in and she started to work thinking it was her last day. Two hours later, my boss sees her and ask her what is she doing there? She replies that is her last day of work. He said you are wrong, you wanted your Effective Day of Resignation to be Thursday! So Punch out and Have a nice day! (He's very polite). \n\nTLDR; Employee that never listens decides to work on her effective resignation date, her boss politely ask her to take a hike. \n",

        "text": "I used to work as a bank teller when I was 20. I hated it. Behind the counter it was me, two old ladies, and my boss we'll call Christine (more to come on her, not her real name). It wasn't a busy bank at all, so it was mostly just dumb small talk, agonizing silence, terrible coffee, and listening to the endless outdated top 40 music (think Shania Twain and Uncle Kracker).\n\nChristine was a real conundrum to me. On one hand she was INSANELY attractive. She had a beautiful face, but was attractive otherwise in kind of a superficial way as she had a tiny waist and pretty large/obvious implants for her size. I'm more of an \"au natural\" kind of guy, but she always wore intensely low cut stuff and some days it was a real saving grace to an otherwise crappy shift. On the other hand, she was horrible to us. She was only maybe 25 and had a chip on her shoulder the size of Texas. She had a kid very early on in life and seemingly had the fun sucked out of her years ago. I both genuinely hated her and was very attracted to her. The hatred tended to win most days but it was a pretty perplexing hatred. \n\nShe would often condescend the old ladies, but really liked to beat me down as her focus. Any mistake I made, she would bully me, shout at me, belittle me, anything she could to make her feel like queen bee. She was on rare occasion not so bad, but most often made us all miserable. I think she had it out for me especially because I was a 20 year old little punk and didn't mind firing back at her if I thought she was being unreasonable. The girl blew up on me 40+ times while I was employed there, always in a public fashion. After about a year of this miserable job, I told the branch manager I was quitting (it was mostly due to Christine, but I was also just bored shitless and reached a breaking point). I didn't go into great detail why, but had mentioned how Christine treated me and the others pretty poorly most days. \n\nSo I put in my 2 weeks, realized I would be jobless hours later, and immediately tried to call off my resignation after a change of heart the next day. The branch manager listened, but ultimately decided that he didn't accept my rescinding the resignation I gave him. Whatever, I was fickle, now enter that sweet sweet MC. On my last day there, there was a very palpable vibe that Christine couldn't be happier I was leaving, and that the old ladies were upset they were losing their buffer to her tyranny. With a few hours to go, the head of HR comes downstairs and motions me toward an office (idk if what I said triggered the branch manager to make the call or if this was normal procedure on a last day).  She wanted to do an exit interview. I had never heard of this, but apparently it's pretty common in offices. I shrugged and said sure let's do it. The HR lady goes in the office to sit down, and before I went in I looked back at Christine and gave her the biggest mean-spirited grin. You could tell she was worried what I was about to say.\n\nIn one final bit of hostility she told me \"you better not say anything bad about me in there, I promise I will fuck up your life if you do\". I kept smirking at her and walked in to the interview. It took me a minute to realize how I could play this; but as I got a few questions in, the plan unveiled itself. I took the most extreme high-road approach possible just as Christine had asked, and didn't say a single bad thing about her the whole time. The HR woman pressed me over and over again to be honest with her as she had heard things, but I stood my ground. I laid it on as thick as I possibly could too, using sentences like : \"ya know Christine can be tough on us sometimes, but I really believe she's wonderful at her job overall and truly cares about this branch\" and \"she always demands the best out of us, you can't fault her for that \". It was 15 minutes of pure horse shit. I gave Christine the same shit eating grin on the way out of that interview as I did on the way in to set my plan in motion. I knew when they interviewed Christine right after, her immaturity would lead her to rip me to shreds with that HR lady. That is precisely what she did. I didn't have a grander reason for why I did it other than I wanted to make her look stupid/crazy on my way out the door. \n\nApparently what she said to that HR woman about me was so bad, it left the HR woman confused. So I went home and was happy to never return. 2 days later, one of the old lady tellers calls me. She said HR had been doing an investigation into what was going on and had interviewed the whole office about our relationship. All the sales people, mortgage people, IT guy, you name it. Every single one of them said the same thing that I was good at my job and  she was unfairly hard on me all the time. Christine ended up getting demoted and HR called me to apologize for what had been going on. They offered me another job at a different branch if I was interested. I took it because I didn't wanna be jobless. I worked there for a few more months, realized I still hated banking and quit soon after. But slaying that boss with pure MC was beautiful. \n\nedit- spelling\n",

Very low pay, but the experience was supposed to make up for it, which was perfectly fine for me. I was learning User-experience design.\n\nTurned out, my boss didn't really know what my job was supposed to be, I guess it was just a cool millenial buzz-word sounding job that he could talk about to clients. But, the reality was different : I was barely practicing any of what I learned at school at my job, because there were always other priorities.I was pissed not to be able to do what I was good for, and to be assigned stupid, unrelated tasks. I had to find my own tasks, and regularly talking about my issue to my boss did not change anything.   \n\n\nOne day I was tasked to translate our software, which was all in english, into our native language, as that was the language of our clients (duh). It was a boring, tedious task that nobody wanted to do. The code was incredibly messy, translating ONE occurence of one word could take up to 20 minutes of searching.  I was just tired of fighting and the end of my contract was near so... ok I'll do it.  \nAnd I really did it. By now, you understand that my boss loves his cool buzzwords. Everything that sound english, hip, and so. But I was tasked to translate everything in our native language, so I did. I did translate everything, every single button. Our government recently created words to translate the smallest most commons english IT words like \"email\", \"spam\", \"hashtag\", \"tag\" or \"emoji\", but those new words sound weird, and almost nobody know them anyway. Well, *I* used them. Of course my boss would have wanted my to let those words in english, but, hey, I was here to translate !\n\nOnce my task was done (1 week of dull pain), our software now sounded weird, outdated, and almost unclear, although perfectly grammatically correct\n\n  \nTLDR ; my boss assign me to a boring, hellish task that was not part of my job : translating our software. So I did that using weird but correct terms for even the most common english word. Now the interface looks outdated and unnatural.\n\nThe Aftermath : After I left the job I went back to the software only to see that my translations of these common words had been reversed - and, as I said, translating even a single word is a pain in the ass as one must scour a messy code. So I guess my boss must have had to do it himself.  \n",

To preface the work place, I busted my tail there for low wages while most of the teenaged staff slacked off for most of the shifts...\n\nAnyway at some point she learned the name of the district manager who we’ll slave driving waste of oxygen, or “DM” for short.  he and the manager of the store (stand up dude) came over after her complaint one day that there was not enough butter on her recently delivered and untipped on sub.... ok...  I delivered the sandwich, I figured correctly that I was to redeliver the food and move on...\n\nIssue—I was accused of making her food wrong, but i wasn’t the original cook...she insisted that it should be remade with extra butter... I started explaining I didn’t cook her sub... but DM wasn’t hearing it.  \n\nHe berated me in front the actual employee who screwed it up and my manager (who knew better than to disagree)...  and the 3 of them were now to watch me remake “my” screw up to be sure that it was done properly.   btw i pride myself on precision (ocd) so this was pretty insulting... but i needed the job at the time...\n\nI get 95% of the way finished remaking CC’s sub when DM and my manager are called away to deal with something else (basically 3 feet off but  looking away)... \n\nWhich brings us up to the malicious compliance.\n\nCoworker who made the first sandwich watches as I’m finishing up... This sub is perfect, except... it only has a standard (1/2 oz squeeze) of “butter” (liquid margarine like substance)...  so I squeeze a few ounces on top... then whipped open the sub and added a good 6000 or so calories more... kid looks at me wide eyed, then the sub, then DM whose back is turned, then back at me again in shock.  “extra butter” i said with a shit eating grin as I wrapped her food up.  it was his turn to deliver to CC and not get tipped.\n\n2 things happened in regards to this.\n\nThe first, CC called back to tell DM that this was the absolute best sub sandwich she had ever eaten.\n\nThe second, she never ordered food from us again.",

        "text": "Obligatory long time lurker preface.\n\nI work in a certain military-industrial complex as a government employee. Since my job is relatively safe, I've had multiple MC, but this is the one I'd like to share. About a year ago, one of our senior engineers left. He got a job servicing the equipment that we (his previous organization) own. Moreover, he took a lateral in pay but got pretty bawler bennies. He was pretty chill. Good on him, but I don't think he could have imagined the storm that'd follow.\n\nMy non-engineer bosses, first line supervisor (FLS) and division chief (DC) interviewed far and wide. They do a good job at what they do. They find money in hidden places, and they generally would allow us to do our thing without pretending they were too familiar with how the sausage factory worked. They found a fellow, who on paper and in interview, seemed just right. He was also a PhD in engineering! Oh joy.\n\nNow, I don't want to dig too much on Dr. New Guy (DNG). I wouldn't go have a beer with him or anything, but he knows that really focused area that his PhD is in. Too bad for him, we have new, different tasks in multi-discipline areas every week. His old job just didn't prepare him for it, and DC is a good-idea-fairy to boot. I feel bad for the guy; he really does think that DC should always be said \"yes\" to, and DNG always has too much on his plate.\n\nI've been on the job for about 5 years at this point, and I know that it's a little math and science with a \\*lot\\* of down time. As an erst-while team lead, I let my guys get their field and office work done. As long as the numbers are right and they make productivity, then I'm happy. DNG decided we weren't efficient enough and called meeting.\n\nCalling a meeting is pretty normal, we gather in an area and discuss (while standing) what we're doing, what are roadblocks, and what help we need. These meetings usually take 10 minutes of talking followed by 10 minutes of sidebar where I figure out how to clear my guys' path so they can be engineers without madness of logistics and paperwork.\n\nDNG changed this. We met in the division conference room. DNG had PowerPoints. DNG had graphs. DNG brought up my last project, and DC - with the bad visualization of the graphs - started to ask questions. I answered, and I went to the whiteboard to write out the formula... DC stopped me. He didn't understand that. \"Ok,\" I thought, \"This hasn't been a problem in the past.\" So I tried to tease out of DC what the misunderstanding was. Turns out he really just like PowerPoints better.\n\nAbout two days later, my FLS met with me. He said, \"You really need to make sure that DNG sees everything you send out before it leaves the building.\"\n\n\"Everything?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yup, everything,\" he confirmed.\n\nI just knodded, \"Please send me an email saying to do so\". He did. MC time.\n\nI talk to an engineer, and he needs C-channel: \"DNG, please review this request.\" Read request required.\n\nI talk to a mathematician, and he needs a new MATLAB toolbox: \"DNG, please review this request.\" Read request required.\n\nI talk to a software engineer, and he has legacy code: \"DNG, please review this request.\" Read request required.\n\nI cc'd my FLS on every request - those even not from engineers. Toilet tissue, phone lines, botched computer updates - I sent DNG everything... Read request required. It took me 4-6 hours a day to write the emails as we have no formal approval system, and I charged it as overhead as opposed to customer funded. My labor plummetted. DNG couldn't keep up, but I kept sending, and I didn't act  until his blessing was brought down - he was a PhD after all.\n\nOur operations just about seized within a few weeks when DLS came into my office wondering what was going on. I showed him all of the requests with his orginal request. \"You've got to clear this,\" he said.\n\nI forwarded all of the same to DC with the note \"Pending.\"\n\nMy FLS came to me later, \"Don't worry about DNG. Make it happen.\"\n\nTL;DR: New guy decides things aren't good enough. When he has to deal, he couldn't.\n\n\\*EDIT: 1 Grammatical Error (Wher-&gt;Where). I am an engineering lead after all. Also, a clarification: My job took about 3-5 email per day before MC. I'd walk to other offices and find where to fit our work. When they were busy, I'd often buy the first round or two after work to make things happen. After MC, things went to 100+ emails per day, and now I'm not meeting step goal... but I'm thinner from less drinking, there's that.",

        "text": "So this happened about 2 years ago. I'm on mobile so sorry for any formatting errors.\n\nI was working for a hotel near my college at the front desk. You know, checking people in/out and making reservations and all that. The two owners of this hotel were just plain delightful human beings. Always treated employees with respect and often brought their beautiful golden retriever in who liked to hang out behind the front desk with us.\n\nI should also mention that this hotel has a rewards program. Pretty standard, you get points for staying and you can turn those points into free rooms or even commercial products (music, DVD players, plane tickets, gift cards, etc). Employees also earned points for signing people up for the program. We could use our points just like the customers could, which becomes important momentarily.\n\nNow, unlike the owners, the manager (call her Bee) was not delightful. See was a classic suck up to the owners, but when they were gone she adopted a struck \"my way or the highway\" attitude. She also thought she knew everything, this is also important. For example, I at the time I was finishing my senior year of a physics/mathematics double major. Any time I brought up any type of scientific/mathematical concept with a coworker (another physics major), Bee butts her head in, injecting completely wrong information, swearing up and down that she knows it for a fact.\n\nAnyway, so as manager, Bee has monthly quotas to reach. One of which was more of a team wide quota, but the reward/consequence for meeting/not meeting this quota feel to her. She needed us to get more people to sign up for the rewards program. She told me to just sign people up even if they say no. Make up email addresses for them if you have to! Now this seemed like fraud to me. I didn't want to get in trouble nor get the owners of the hotel I trouble work corporate. So I emailed her to get it in writing that it is a direct order from her. I asked something along the lines of, \"Hey Bee, just wanted to confirm that you told me to go ahead and just sign everyone up for the rewards program even if they said no.\" She responds, \"Yes.\"\n\nSo I do. I sign up every fucking person that walks through that door. Even if they call to cancel a reservation, sign up. Want to extend your stay? Sign up. Got locked out of your room and need your key? What's your name? Sign up!\n\nBy the end of that month she printed out the report. The 2nd highest amount of signups was Bee with 40 signups at a 60% email address attainment rate. In first place, me... With 390 something signups and a 98% email rate. \n\nWell corporate finds this suspicious and investigates. They contact the owners who call me in one day. I show them and corporate the email and say I was just following orders. Long story short, Bee gets fired and I ended up with 600,000 points from all my sign ups. Enough for $600 in best buy gift cards for sweet new TV. Thanks Bee!\n\nEdit: a few words.",

Customer also claims \"I have many years in programming and computers, and there's no way\".    \nGranted, she may, but technology changes and improves.  \nI tell her I just learned about it myself and she snaps at me \"Oh yeah?! Prove it!\"   \nMe \"Ok. I'll be right back\".   \n\nI start to walk away because I won't take being called a liar to my face like that. I tell her I'll be right back with evidence and proof.    \nShe starts yelling at me as I continue walking away and then starts yelling, not asking, but yelling at the top of her voice for a manager.  I can hear her from the Nerd Herd office while I'm downloading and printing the Intel Mobile laptop speedstep white sheet.  \n\nBy the time I get back to her she is riding the manager up and down telling him how much of a liar I am, I'm just trying to rip her off to make a sale for money.   \nThe manager is trying to tell her we don't even work on commission (we didn't).  \nI approach her and the manager and calmly say to the manager \"Here is the paper from the processor manufacturer itself that supports everything I was just trying to tell the customer.\"   \n\nI then hold out the entire white paper technical document to her and say \"you may read this if you want. There are some spectacular hardware changes happening right now that you may be interested in\".   \nThe customer huffs once more and yanks it out of my hand, and flips through it and finally says, still snarky, \"I'll read this and it maybe it will help me make a decision on my laptop purchase. Thanks!\"   \n\nI finally kindly reply, \"You're welcome. Please feel free to grab me and ask me any more questions if you have some.\"  \nI went to help other customers, and occasionally I could see the original customer glaring at me in between looking at other laptops.    \n\nShe didn't make a purchase that day, but according to the manager she came back and did on another day I wasn't there.  \nThe best part, the manager never once blamed anything on me about it.",

If the box was intact, the thermostat setting was correct, period.\n\nWe, the residents, wanting to assist in every way possible, all got a narrow hallway table, set a lamp on it, placed it directly under the thermostat, and helpfully installed a 100 watt bulb in it to better illuminate the area for easier thermostat reading.\n\nIt proved to be a good solution for all.\n\n\n\nTLDR:  Base Housing locked up our thermostats to prevent comfortable settings.  We installed ultra hot bulbs below them so they we're artificially heated, fooling the thermostat and allowing lower temperatures.  Ahhhhhhhhhhh..............",

        "text": "So this took place less than a year ago. I work for a premier and renowned science/technology organization. I had a super @$$hole woman of a supervisor who loved throwing people under the bus and was a micromanager. She tasked someone with doing a high-level presentation to the heads of our organization on what we are doing with education and outreach initiatives.... My coworker asked me to help her out and proof-read the document, so i did and i provided minor edits to an overall good presentation.\n\nWell... that dumb supervisor i mentioned decided she is better then all of us and felt like she needed to prove herself to all the \"head-shed\" management, so she throws out my edits (and the presentation) and makes her own at the last minute. She then tells us that we are not to communicate with her until after the meeting because she needs to focus on making a \"real professional presentation.\" Minutes before the meeting, she cc-ed my coworker and I when she sent it to the tech person who was going to be setting up and \"controlling\" the presentation. She cc-ed us as a \"HAHA! This is how you make a REAL presentation you subordinates. I'm way better.\" Well as i was walking to the meeting I decided to pull up this \"amazing\" presentation. On the TITLE SLIDE she wrote in huge font \"Education and PUBIC engagement: focussed on students.\" I walk in to the \"CEO conference room\" and decide i'll let her know so she can fix it real fast.... but then I see her standing at the podium with an outrageously smug look on her face so i just quietly sat down towards the back and followed her instructions to \"not talk to her until after the presentation.....\"\n\nOne of the head managers sat next to me and complimented my last presentation and asked if i made this one. I was too quick to say i had no part in this one, and having known the guy a little, i decided to lean over and show him the title slide on my phone. He immediately saw it and said WTF. I told him that now he is in on it, and to make sure to look around the room at all the other managers when the title slide goes up....\n\nSome people snickered, some people got embarrassed, and some just shook their head in shame. Best part was that my dumb supervisor's boss was in the room and i could immediately see RAGE fill her eyes.\n\nSorry. Not Sorry.\n\n(Note: this is my repost to protect my identity. Thank you for the good advice everyone, and thanks for your input.)\n\nUpdate 1: WHAT THE FUNK!? This is seriously my largest response ever. I've been a member for many years, and this one post is BY FAR the most appreciated one. First of all; thank you! Secondly... whaaaaat?? Why this? ",

So we definitely don’t like it when people order food not on the menu.\n\nOur menu changes daily, but we’ve never served PB+J’s. We’ve done everything but that. So when someone asks for that, we tell them we don’t do that. But no, the manager’s gotta butt in and tell us “it’s just a sandwich, you guys better make it.” \n\nSince everybody else is occupied making food that’s actually on the menu, I’m on sandwich duty, even though I’m the dishwasher, but I have plan. The dude didn’t specify what he wants on it. Nothing against the resident (yea it’s a retirement home), I just gotta take a jab at management. \n\nI look through our bread house (or whatever you call it), and try to find shit they wouldn’t like for their PBJ. I find some raisin bread and I grab the butt sides of the loaf. Then I find some orange marmalade jelly and spread that shit all over. Find the peanut butter and now we’re in business, brand new first ever PBJ to ever be served in this fine establishment. \n\nTbh, idk if that would even be a gross combo for a PBJ, I literally only know how to wash dishes when it comes to food. But dam it worked ‘cause the manager comes in the kitchen and demands to know why I didn’t just put grape jam on normal wheat bread like a normal person. \n\nThen I just tell him I only know how to wash dishes, what do you want me to do?\n\nSo he tells me to make another sandwich.\n\nMe: “‘Scuse me can you clarify that.”\n\nHim: “MAKE THE SANDWICH AGAIN.”\n\nSo I did make the sandwich again, exactly the same, just like he asked for, butt slices and everything.\n\nNeedless to say, my sandwich making career was short-lived. \n\n\nEdit: manager actually said grape, not strawberry jam\n\nEdit 2(because people think I ruined the resident’s day): the old guy ended up ordering the chicken Alfredo.

Whenever you first installed Quake II, your online player name was defaulted to \"Player\".  You could always tell when someone had first bought the game, or had a fresh install, as they were running around with the gamertag Player.  Most people would politely point out that you could change it in Options.\n\nExcept for this one kid.  We'll call him \"Q2BadAss\".\n\nSo we're playing on this public server, and every time a person joined with the name Player, Q2BadAss was the first to jump up and start with \"Player, change your name.\"  \"Hey Player, don't you know that you can change your name?\" \"Dude, change your name.\"  And if the person didn't comply, he started getting loud, ie. \"PLAYER, CHANGE YOUR NAME!!!\" Just constantly with this.  People started calling him out for spamming, and being a nuisance.  He scoffs and starts getting mouthy.\n\nSo I log off, changed my name to \"Player\" and got back on the server.  Sure enough, he starts in on me.  \"Hey Player, change your name!\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Why not? It's easy! Just got to Options and change your name.\"\n\n\"Nah, I'm good.\"\n\n\"Why won't you change your name?\"\n\n\"I like \"Player\".  I'm going to keep it...\"\n\n\"Dude, just change your name!  PLAYER, CHANGE YOUR NAME!\" ...on and on, for the next few minutes as I try to rationalize with him why I want to keep the name Player.\n\nSo I finally said, \"I'll tell you what.  If you can kill me, I'll change my name.  Deal?\"\n\nSo for the next 15 minutes, we're running around, I kill him a bunch of times, he gets a few good hits on me, but doesn't take me down.  I can tell he's getting frustrated.   I wind up getting into this one hairy fight, make it out alive, but I'm low on health.  As I'm running around trying to get my health back up, I round a corner, and there he is.  I get a face full of double-barreled shotgun, full force. Boom, I go down.\n\n\"Hahahah! I killed you!  Now change your name!\"\n\n\"Ok, you got me fair and square.  A deal is a deal.\"\n\nSo I went into Options and changed my name to:  Q2BadAss Sucks\n\nThe server chat erupts in LOL's and Hahaha's, only to be peppered with a few \"OH THAT'S REAL MATURE\" and \"YOURE A DICK\", and a subsequent logoff.

You can wait in line like everyone else.\"\n\nAt this point, the woman accepts \"defeat\" and her toddler is getting fussy. She grabs a ticket and puts her child on the ground. The kid is crying at this point loudly but I have my headphones in, just trying to wait for my turn.\n\nAnd then it happens.\n\nThis kid unleashes a torrent of shit that basically explodes his pants and gets all over the AC display shit they try to sell you on the way out. I'm amazed that much poop came out of this little boy. He's crying up a storm and his mom is trying to comfort him but it just keeps coming and coming. At the same time, he's waddling around and getting it all over the place. The entire area, myself included, jumps back and is giving this lady some space. \n\nFinally, after what seems like an eternity, it stops. The kid is crying, his mom holding him, shit running down her arms. There is fecal matter in about a ten foot radius everywhere. All traffic to the exit has stopped as horrified shoppers look on. The optical department, including OG stare at this woman. She marches herself, son in tow, up to the man.\n\nW: \"I was wondering if you could tell me where the bathroom was.\"\n\nOG sheepishly points to an area behind the registers and W walks away. I decide to come back later when the area doesn't smell like a raccoon fucking died, trying to stifle my laughter the whole way through.\n\nTL;DR: Lady took a number and it happened to be 2. \n\nP.S. Before you ask, there is no big sign pointing to the bathrooms visible from the Optical Department at my Costco. I imagine that will be changing soon. \n\n",

        "text": "So I was working at a fine dining restaurant that was farm to table and we would make an amazing amount of food from scratch. Though the operation was a small store and would on a good night do 50 covers for an 8 course meal that had various options. I had been working close to 6 months when my asshole of a boss/chef, told us he was closing the restaurant in 2 months. So I gave my two weeks on a Monday and already had an interview for my current job.  So I was going to work for two more weeks after my week that I put my two weeks. \nSo my boss “M” asked, more so told me, that the two weeks wouldn’t be the upcoming week and the one after but would start after the next week. So I would be working a month. \n\nSo as a bad employee I ignored that bs and later talked to my sou chef. She was there everyday and basically ran the place. \nNow one of my jobs was making ricotta for some pasta dishes. Which my sou chef said we wouldn’t be making anymore starting Tuesday of my first official “two weeks”. \nI had made a double batch that week already  and would certainly make it for the week. Now I told my Sou chef the situation. To which she replied bitterly that I should make more batches already because since we’re shutting down more people would feel inclined to come and eat since it would be their last chance. \nI make a double and a single batch on a regular week and usually ended up with 10 pounds leftover. \nI said fuck it okay I’ll play this game. Now a single batch produces 30-32 pounds. So these pasta dishes were not even a popular on the menu compared to others. A double batch would make around 120  orders if done properly. \nSo over the course of the week I made two more double batches through out the week.  One more on the Monday of next week and put all of the ricotta bagged dated, all on the walk in cooler. I organize it put some in the front neatly organized just to cover the other packages. \nNo one notices since I volunteer to organize the walk in cooler. \nSoon my two real weeks are up I say goodbye to the staff and my sou Chef pack up. All while knowing the still have 100 pounds of ricotta in the cooler.   \n\n",

        "text": "TL;DR: Court clerk desperately needs to either switch shifts or workplaces. Even though both are feasible, iron-fisted director states \"it's not in the office's best interests\" and sarcastically tells clerk to complain to the judge. A complaint is made to the judge... By one of the judge's peers. Director's ass is publicly chewed and he is demoted.\n\nI'm a clerk at a Civil Court in Brazil. Both my wife and I applied for a position in the same region through the same entrance examination, but since my grade was better than hers, I wound up getting the job before she got hers. The region comprises City A (larger and safer) and City B (smaller with a high crime rate), which are about 10 miles apart. I got the job at a Civil Court in City A, and I chose to work the last shift (11-19). Other shifts are 9-17 and 10-18. Most clerks choose to work the first shift, and directors tend to value clerks who work the last shift. My office had 5 clerks in the first shift, 5 clerks in the last shift and none in the 10-18.\n\nMy director was a very stern man. Our bylaws allow for a few perks which he would often forsake due to what he claimed \"it's what's in the office's best interests\". He would ask people not to take vacations. He would get mad at people calling sick with doctor's notes. We have 6 yearly full-paid absences which he would not let us take. Even though we're allowed to clock-in up to 15 minutes late 5 times a month with no penalty, he would shame people for doing it and order them to clock-out late. He never really trained or assigned someone to train me, just started shoving tasks on me. He would order people to clock-out and stay after hours so they wouldn't get comp hours. When I had my vasectomy and my doctor gave me 2 days off because of an issue, he called me to go to work in the same day  and threatened to write me up when I refused, heavily implying that I forged my doctor's note. I think you get the gist of it.\n\nWhat always baffled me is that myself, himself and every worker in the office (and we had a lot of clerks there) was being paid by the State, yet he acted like he was paying us out of his own pocket and doing us a favor letting us work under him. He also had a reputation for his sternness among his peers. Most directors are pretty chill people, since they're basically glorified supervisors. Not this one. Whatever. I kept doing my work diligently. I've worked retail, nothing scares me anymore.\n\nAbout one year later, my wife got the job at City B, and she could only do the 11-19 shift because her department had very few people at that shift. She couldn't drive (is terrified of) and busses from my house or City A to City B are sparse, have a lots of robbery reports and are basically motorized horse wagons. None of her coworkers lived anywhere close to my house or City A's Courthouse so, basically, we could either waste a lot of money on Uber, or I had to leave her in City B, go back to City A, work 8 hours, go back to City B and then go back home, wasting a total of about 2.5 hours driving in the process, which was what we were doing for two months...\n\nRight up to the point when she nearly got mugged. Clerks are not allowed to stay in City B's courthouse building after 19:00, so she had to wait for me about 40 minutes in the street, where shit almost happened if it weren't for a late leaving police officer. After that happened, I absolutely **HAD** to change my working hours to an hour earlier (10-18) so I could be there when she got out.\n\nI explained everything to my director and he scoffed. Said it was not his problem. That \"it's not in the office's best interests\" that I changed my shift, even though there were four clerks aside from me working the same shift (two are usually what most departments get, he would have double and it apparently wasn't enough) and none working the 10-18. So my wife started taking an uber back home, which was a big financial hit on us (it ate about 1/3 her incomes).\n\nMy wife's director suggested that I switched workplaces with another person from City B so, provided that the Court President approved (he always did) and that my director signed a document agreeing with the change, that person would then work at City A and I would work at City B. As luck would have it, one of my wife's coworkers has been trying to work at City A for 2 years, so I already had someone to switch places with. I talked about it with my director and, after two weeks postponing an answer, you guessed, he told me it was \"not in the office's best interests\".\n\nWhen I insisted, his reasoning was: \"You know how to work here and a new person wouldn't know, so you absolutely need to stay here\". Never mind that the new person was also a clerk at a Civil Court, so the work was basically the same. I asked him what the hell was I supposed to do since we were losing quite a lot of money and he wouldn't allow me to either change my shift or my workplace and he said, very sarcastically, that I could complain to the judge, and I was to stop bothering him with my personal drama. He knew my judge wouldn't even meet a newbie clerk, much less believe me. My wife relayed that info to her director and he was astonished. But he had an idea. \"Tell it to the judge, you say?\"\n\nSo my wife's director explained everything to his Court's judge, who in turn had a long phone call with *my* Court's judge. She politely asked him to let me switch, and told him about my director's habit of ignoring our bylaws. The next day, the judge shows up in my department. My director, ironically, is late. Judge is asking the senior clerks questions about my director. Most of them try to avoid answering. He seems to understand everything.\n\nDirector arrives, is all smiles when he sees the judge in our office instead of his own, and is greeted with a \"what the hell do you think you're doing?\". The room freezes. Judge rants for about 10 minutes about how employees should be free to do what our bylaws allow, and that if my director was so adamant about not signing the document for my switching, he would do it himself while signing my director's demotion. He **wasn't** supposed to stop people from doing what is specifically allowed in our bylaws and he has been many a time ordered to, I quote, \"stop treating court clerks as god damn retail clerks\".\n\nSome people were really fed up with my director and this public ass-chewing finally grew a spine on them, because they started telling the judge things he did. Most people quoted his \"it's in the office's best interests\" policy and the judge got livid after hearing about it for the third time. \"You don't get to decide what's better for the office, **I** get to decide what's better for the office because it's **MY** office and every single one of you works under my authority\", he yelled, his red face a few inches from my director's face. Good, now we have a power tripper publicly power tripping a power tripper.\n\nAfter some more yelling, the judge leaves. My director is floored. He basically sits on his chair and glares at me. I can see it in his eyes, he will get back at me hard. There's indistinct chatter among the clerks about filing a formal complaint. The judge, however comes back after about 10 minutes with a sheet of paper in hand and walks in my direction. If I weren't a public worker, I would think I was about to be fired. He bluntly asks me, \"Are you sure you want to go to City B?\". I can only nod. He has a very powerful presence. I later learned that he used to work in the army.\n\nHe gives me the paper. It's the document I needed a signature from my director, signed by the judge himself. It's already signed by my wife's director and the person who would switch with me. It's only missing my signature. Judge says \"Sign it and take the rest of the day off as a paid leave. You're to work in City B as of tomorrow\". I stammer \"But wasn't I supposed to wait for the Court President's approval?\", and he glares at me.\n\n\"I am a judge. If I say 'go', you go.\"\n\nYou don't have to say it twice, my lord, my liege, my demigod. I thank him profusely, say my goodbyes to my coworkers and I go to my director. I look him dead in the eye. \"You were right. The complaint thing did work to *my* best interests\". His face contorts in what some subreddits would call a \"cat butt face\".\n\nThe next day, I started working at City B's Court under what's probably the best director one could ever ask for, with the blessing of working with my wife (We're allowed to as long as we have the same job). My current director is basically the antithesis of my previous one, very reasonable and non-confrontational.\n\nA former coworker kept me informed of the fallout. He told me that 5 other people, himself included, requested to switch to other Courts the following days and the director was forced to sign for them all (no immediate switching like mine, though). Since director is an appointed position by the Court's judge, he was demoted to chief clerk by the end of that week and the former chief clerk, a lovely woman, got his job. He tried to flaunt power at the newcomers and his new director put an end to it very quickly by giving him a 30 day suspension.",

When we had customers order within the store we would just take the customers name so that we can call out their order once it's ready and usually this isn't an issue. \n\nWell an older gentleman walks in 60-70 i'd say. He waits in line, approaches the counter places his order, but when I asked this customer for his name, I realized I had opened pandoras box.\n\nCus: \"What do you need my name for?\"\n\nMe:\"its so that when your order is prepared I can call it out for you sir. \"\n\nCus: \"You don't need my fucking name\" turns to customers in line and says \" Watch out! The fucking pizza guy wants your social security number.\" \n\nMe:\" Sir if it is an issue you can just use a fake name\"\nCus: \"just put Bob on it\"\n\nand so i did\n\n10 Minutes later his Pizza is hot and fresh from the oven, i walk to the counter and yell out to the store \"pizza for bob\". The guy doesnt budge. I realize now that this man has forgotten that he was ordering under an alias and doesn't know his order is ready. The other customers in the store however knew what was happening because they just watched and heard the misery unfold, they turn to \"bob\", they turn to me, they turn to \"bob\" and I can see it in their eyes, even the customers long for that malicious compliance. \nI continued to bring the other customers their orders, some who had been there before him, and once \"bob\" had noticed that i was serving food to those who ordered after him, he  approached the counter [ at this point the pizza is getting nice and dry under the heat lamp] it's been about 20 minutes since he's ordered. \n\nCus:\"Is my food going to be ready soon?\"\n\nMe:\"Sir, it's been out of the oven for about ten minutes now, i've called for the name you gave me several times but nobody came to the counter.\"\n\nAt this point the guy is aware that he is getting his food late at his own demise. \n\nI hand him the pizza and there is no more exchanging of words, he leaves and goes on his way, the customers who witnessed the misery unfold were all snickering as he left. \n\nNot a bad gig. \n\nJust deleted this by mistake, first time on the internet.",

        "text": "I was inspired by another earlier post by someone who worked in an organization that provided free legal advice.\n\nMy law school offers a free legal advice and representation service to low-income earners in the city. We, the students, volunteer in this service and help people with their cases. Most of our cases are related to contracts, employment, tenancy, wills, or petty crime, and we are limited by our mandate to not provide support for anything too intensive (eg. jail time possibility, divorce, automobile accidents etc...). Anything we send out to clients or third-parties must go through our supervising lawyers (SL). Also keep in mind most of the students, including me, are volunteers going through full-time law school and have jobs outside of the classroom, so working on the files usually take a bit of time.\n\nOne of my clients, M, came in with what seemed like a simple case. She told me that she was being evicted by her landlord without being provided sufficient notice, and as such wanted to get compensated. A week goes by and I got working on her file, doing research on our local residential tenancy statutes and calling her a few times to iron out the details. The landlord had given the tenant notice in Nov 2017 (on a hand-written slip of paper, which technically isn't the proper way to serve notice) about the fact that the unit is needed for a family member to move in by Feb 1st. At this point, it was already mid-January and getting close to the move-out date of Jan 31st.\n\nOur local statutes provided that landlords must give 2 months notice in the proper form prior to terminating the rental for occupation, as well as 1 month free rent to the tenant. So I get on the phone with M and tell her that she can either \"refuse the notice\" and continue the tenancy since it wasn't served properly, or she can move out and we'll get her 1 month free rent for her.\n\nAt this point she completely changes her tone and demands that we ask for 2 months of free rent (apparently it takes her that long to find a new place), get her damage deposit back before moving out, and have the landlord pay for her moving fees. I told her that's basically not possible since she's not entitled to that by law, and she starts flipping out at me over the phone telling me how her landlord is a crazy person and we are totally useless if we can't claim \"what is fair\" for her.\n\nSo tell her I need to meet with the SL next week to discuss the situation. The SL essentially tells me that my assessment is accurate and that we can't make claims that run counter to the law (pretty obvious). Before I could call her in the afternoon, she calls me through our switchboard (routed through to me, it turns out she called like 4 times that day), and tells me she is freaking out because her landlord served a 10-day eviction notice on her door. The eviction notice was for failure to pay rent for January, which is a valid and totally separate eviction claim. M never told me she withheld rent for January.\n\nAt this point we were basically 3 days away from Jan 31st. Due to this new notice, we can no longer argue the tenancy was still in effect since she would still get kicked for nonpayment. The only remedy was to argue that the one month of rent was withheld because M had expected to move out by the end of January. So I tell M she needs to get out of there by Jan 31st if she wants to protect herself, and we'll help her communicate with the landlord and ask for the January withholding to be in lieu of the one month free rent.\n\nLo and behold, February rolls around and she was still occupying the unit into the first week of the month. So the landlord filed a second eviction notice for failure to pay rent for February. She is now 2 months behind rent and is facing two valid eviction notices one of which is coming up in 3-4 days, so she's pretty screwed. If she is evicted due to non-payment, she will get absolutely nothing, not even the 1 month free rent. The best course of action is that she needs to pay her January rent to satisfy the January notice, and we can continue to claim the one-month free rent for February which is already pushing it in the eyes of the law, and hopefully keep her from becoming homeless in the next week.\n\nI get onto the phone with her again to tell her that she needs to pay a month of rent.\n\nShe begins to shout at me over the phone and essentially tells me I'm crazy and incompetent and am in a conspiracy to side with the landlord. She says she absolutely refuses to pay a cent to the landlord and that she deserved 2 month rent and deposit returned immediately and moving fees covered. She said (and I quote) \"I know the laws of the place, I can read too you know! Obviously you guys don't want to help me because you think it's too hard. Don't lie to me. I KNOW WHAT I DESERVE IN THIS SITUATION SO JUST DO YOUR JOB AND GET ME WHAT I AM ENTITLED TO OR ELSE I WILL DO IT MYSELF!\"\n\nI said \"Okay ma'am, I've already told you what you're entitled to, and you don't want it. So I'm going to do my job, which is to follow the law.\" I hung up and had a quick 5 minute chat with the SL, he backed me and said that he gets at least one or two of these types of people each year, and told me to draft a letter to M and close the file.\n\nSo I drafted a short and sweet letter and basically told her \"Following your instructions, we're ceasing to provide any further representation. Our organization is mandated to comply with the law, and upon being informed of this you've elected for self-representation. Good luck on your legal issue.\" SL approved within minutes and had it sent out.\n\n\\--\n\nAbout a week later I receive an email from M, it's filled with expletive insults and one sentence that reads:\n\n\"You and everyone at your organization are useless and will never be good lawyers, I thought you all smart but tell your SL and worthless friends that they are better off planting potato because all of you can only be potato farmers.\"\n\nI had a good chuckle in class and never heard from her again.\n\nPS: *No Potato Farmers were hurt in the telling of this experience.*\n\n*PPS: \\*\\*Typo in title not intentional &gt; cannot correct &gt; oh well\\*\\**",

We live in a 2800 sq ft restored craftsman home that is amazingly well insulated. However, it can be costly to heat and cool. \n\nHe insists on 78 degrees in the summer. I managed to negotiate him down to 77 degrees for the A/C. He kept getting frustrated that I would sneak it down to 75 or 76 because we live in the humid southeast US, and it’s hella hot. He would similarly sneak it up to 78 to save a bit.  After one day of lots of silent thermostat maneuvering, he got frustrated and declared, “I never want to see this thing below 77 degrees again. “\n\nA few weeks later, our Thermostat went out and we got a new one. It is easily programmable. Now, every time he leaves the room to go upstairs or runs an errand, I temporarily program the thermostat to something around 73 degrees. It changes back to 77 before he comes back, and as requested, he never sees it set to anything other than 77 degrees. It’s quite a challenging game since he works from home and I do not!  I’m the master, now!\n\nUpdate: Spouse is on unexpected work trip. It’s gonna be 70 degrees up in here. Plot twist,  the A/C in my van went out. \n\nUPDATE 2: We moved to our new place where utilities are included a couple of weeks ago. It’s a wonderfully cool 73 in my house all the damn time. Life is great. ",

        "text": "Cross-posted this to /r/TalesFromTechSupport as I think it fits both.\n\nWarning: LONG\n\nI worked in IT for 15 years as various roles from Helpdesk to Field Technician to IT Manager, now work in telco/tech sales. I’ve had requests from customers/employers that were dodgy, illogical and sometimes illegal just to save money. This is one of the latter.\n\nAbout 10 years ago I worked for a national manufacturing company that made building products, at a plant that made Low Pressure Laminate boards of all kinds of thicknesses, textures and designs (Colours, patterns Etc.). Due to the vast array of products running through the 3 Short Cycle Laminating Lines, the lines were controlled and maintained via various Primary Logic Controllers (PLCs). 60 mins of downtime on a line meant $10,000 lost production.\n\nNow, I was on call at this plant 24/7. By myself. For five years. With a crew of over 100 plant operators who had been told to call me 24/7 if ANYTHING  went wrong on the computers or those goddam Zebra labels printers that printed stickers for each pack of board. Which meant I was pretty time-poor during the day so started working later and later to work on projects just to keep up (I was young and this was the first ‘in charge’ role I’d had, so I was keen to prove myself).\n\nOne of these projects ended up being an upgrade of the workstations that the electrical engineer and shift electricians used to program changes into the PLC logic itself when there were electrical or mechanical issues that the lines couldn’t cope with. These machines were all running software like Rockwell RSLogix and Siemens PLC interfaces. These software packages back then happened to be so old (Like the PLCs and machinery on the lines itself) that the software licenses still ran on 3.5” floppy disks. The ‘software dongles’ were loaded to each machine using floppy. In some cases they could only be activated once.\n\nAs part of this project, I encountered a critical workstation that had a dead floppy disk drive. This highlighted how dangerous this current method was, as a dead floppy disk could lose a $20,000 license (Paid to replace each time, as I was warned early on) before activating. So I quickly used a freeware utility to take a disk image of each floppy drive itself and store them as a backup on my server (And tapes). During this I also learned that I could use this method to (Illegally) ‘clone’ the licenses to multiple machines (Didn’t do so, but I proved it could be done in an emergency).\nWhere I screwed up was telling the electrical engineer how smart I was to avoid a future disaster, who then relayed this to his manager, the Maintenance Supervisor “Bill”.\n\nBill was an old school electrician, who didn’t mind making shortcuts if it got the job done. And considered himself my manager because IT should be treated like the other trades (Never mind I reported to the Plant Accountant locally, but technically was an IT department employee out of Head Office).\n\nSo Bill, having heard from the electrical engineer what I could now do, decides during this upgrade project (And without telling me) that he didn’t need to purchase new licenses for these PLC packages (An easy 15 minute online process of providing company details and a Purchase Order Number) because I could just ‘clone’ them and save us this money (3 machines, $60K) so he would have looked great to the Plant Manager.\nWhich he then tells me late on a Thursday night as I’m installing the PLC software on the new machine having deactivated the old license on the old machine (I had a network backup, which he didn’t know about) and about to license the new machine.\nWhat ensued is your typical “I’m older and wiser than you, so just do your job” inter-generational argument where both parties believed they were right and neither was backing down.\n\nAfter half an hour of me giving up trying to explain why this was illegal, unethical and not going to happen, Bill finally had enough of my insubordination and ordered me to go home to “Think about whether I wanted a future in his department” (Again, not my manager or even indirect manager). I refused, knowing that if there was an issue with the line before I finished the migration the electricians could not have fixed it and the line would be down at significant cost. But Bill was the senior manager on site, and exercised his authority to kick me off the site until the next morning. But not before I went to my office, documented EVERYTHING and sent it to my manager CC the HR rep to return at 9am. I know why Bill wanted me offsite, he thought I could figure out where the backups were stored and install the license himself. A secure, hidden share meant that he could not.\n\nI left my mobile phone off for the first night in years considering I was barred from site so couldn’t attend any issues anyway and slept like a log. At 9am I walked in to the management team in the boardroom and the Plant Manager running for me like I had the ball in a World Cup Rugby game.\n\n“WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN AND WHY WAS YOUR F*CKING PHONE OFF!!”\n\n“I was barred from site until 9am, so changed my voicemail to contact the after hours team and turned it off so it rang to voicemail immediately”\n\n“B-LINE HAS BEEN DOWN SINCE YOU LEFT!! WE ARE DOWN OVER $100K FROM FORECAST”\n\n“I’m sorry to hear that, but like I said I was barred from site by Bill. I notified &lt;Plant Accountant&gt; and &lt;HR Rep&gt; via email last night about this”\n\n“Go get B-Line back up NOW!!”\n\n“I can’t, Bill didn’t buy new licenses for the line so the new machine wont run and the old license has been deactivated”\n\n“He says you can copy them. Get the line back up and we will get it later!”\n\n“I need that request in writing. What you’re asking me to do is illegal and in breach of company policies so I need it recorded”\n\nThe Plant Manager went from red faced to white faced pretty quickly, and then returned to the Boardroom to order Bill to order the licenses ASAP (An audit could be initiated by myself, IT or the vendor at any time and penalties were known to be severe).\n\nHalf an hour later, the workstation was licensed, running and the line humming along to the despair of the plant operators enjoying an extended smoko.\n\nSite policies were also changed so that only the Plant Manager and HR Rep could kick someone off site, and Bill was reminded just who my manager was.\n\nI also learned to keep any borderline illegal/dodgy tricks I had to myself, and only use them to save my ass if absolutely needed.\n\nTL:DR - Cheap Maintenance Supervisor tries to force me to illegally clone software licenses, kicks me off site when I wouldn’t, costing the plant $100K in production.",

My brother told me the manager tried to calm this piece of trash down, but he proceeded to scream and make a mess. After he dumped out all the sauce packets the manager said “Let me make you a fresh batch of fries, and if you would like, I will upgrade them to the chili fries for free.” The customer agreed. My brother then was assigned to keep the customer occupied.

We don't offer any follow up action like legal representation, draft letters, fill in forms etc.\n\nBecause it's free so we get calls all the time and we're always fully booked. And because it's free, we get all kinds of people calling in with all kinds of cases.\n\nWe hear people trying to force an appointment or legal representation with the reason \"this is a new type of case you've never seen before\".\n\nFor this reason, our slots are on a first-come-first serve and discretion basis. Boss/Supervisor decides who get what/when.(ie. nice and polite person with urgent matter will go first, rude people with real problem will go after, terrible people will be told we're fully booked because we are never not fully booked)\n\nA short while ago, I have a person B calling in.\n\nThe conversation below is abridged for reasons that the entire thing lasted for a day, with one phone call lasting for no less than one hour.\n\nB: Hello. This is the first time I've called.\n\nMe: Okay, since it's the first time you've called, I'll need to briefly explain the T&amp;C.\n\nMe: (tells her we only give general legal advice)(tells her we don't do follow up)(tells her we're fully booked but we can document her case so the person can queue up for next round)\n\nMe: so if there's no question, you can briefly tell me the background of the case.\n\nB: I have a question.

Tell person there's nothing we can do.\n\nMe: Hi, so I just spoke to supervisor. If that is your request, there is nothing we can assist you with.\n\nB: I thought this is the place that gives free legal advice?\n\nMe: Yeah, but you insisted you need legal representation instead of advice, so there's nothing we can do.\n\nPerson B lost it, and cut off the line after threatening to contact our supervisor. I told her I will also take a note of her statement.\n\nWell. I did ask and you did insist that you don't need our service. Now you'll have to wait till the boss forgets your case before you can get another slot. Which, may be the next ten years.",

        "text": "Formating blah blah blah. \n\n\nQuick back story: I work in Firearm sales in a larger retail store setting and HQ has decided to implement a new policy regarding how cash drawers are handled nationwide. While this policy is understandable throughout the rest of the store it will end up causing a larger mess when it comes to how we sell guns.\n\n\nEveryone understands why the policy was implemented, internal theft is one of the leading causes of profit loss in the retail setting. However this blanketed policy change drastically increased the difficulty of selling and transferring firearms to our customers. The policy states that only the person who signed out the cash drawer is allowed to perform sales on the register where it is located. This causes problems in our department as we only have one register and three to four people who need to use it at any given time.\n\n\nOn a federal level anytime a person makes a firearm purchase they are required to fill out a [4473] (https://imgur.com/a/P60xHnD) on a state level, something similar is also required for the sale of a handgun. These two items are why there is a need for malicious compliance from those of us who deal with these forms. \n\n\nBoth of the forms have a section that the firearm salesperson has to sign and date when they transfer a weapon, however, if only one person is able to operate our single cash register at a time, technically only they are allowed to complete these portions of the 4473 and the state forms. If anyone other than the person doing the sale were to sign these portions of the form they would be perjuring themselves on a federal and state level. This is a really terrible idea as the [ATF](https://www.atf.gov/)  is always looking for ways to revoke FFL's (license needed to sell ammo and firearms) and get companies in trouble. Now we have essentially three people at a time who can show the firearms and have customers start the paperwork process but only one person who can actually sell/transfer these firearms at a time. \n\n\nThis leads to increased downtime between customers being able to leave as transferring a firearm requires filing out all this paperwork on a federal level and maintaining records of it on a store level in the back. After one sale like this the associate is usually finalizing the paperwork for another 5 - 10 minutes. If the firearm was a handgun it would also require finalizing paperwork for the state which adds more time onto that. \n\n\nAs for the malicious compliance there are two ways we are attempting to get this policy changed, at least for those in firearm sales. Our first attempt at maliciously complying is to simple not get a cash drawer. The manager who had us sign and agree to the new policy was asked about this and said technically anyone could use a register without cash in it. (Good guy just caught in all the b.s.). Sales can still be rung up at our register however it can only be through credit/debit. Now we sell guns and most people purchase these with a credit/debit card but we are also in charge of selling sporting goods (bikes, knives, camping gear) and a lot of these types of customers pay with cash. This first attempt at maliciously complying will most likely result in a lot of customers complaining up front at the actual cash registers and result in us having to always have a cash drawer.\n\n\nWe are attempting this first as we have a lot of loyal customers who come to us for firearm purchases and this is the least direct way of negatively impacting them.\n\n\nIf that part falls through though the next form of malicious compliance is following company policy to the letter in two ways. Only one associate will be allowed to use the register and file the state and federal forms, resulting in a lot of downtime between actually getting the next customer started on the transfer process. HQ also likes it when customers leave feedback so that we can try and improve the store. Since the gun counter is so close to the store's administrative office we are going to casually mention where the office can be located if they would like to leave a remark on their service for the day. \n\n\nUnfortunately I'm posting this without any form of result from our attempts at malicious compliance, for now. Stay tuned for updates!\n\nEDIT: Okay a lot of people are commenting and suggesting to just get another register. I did state that there is a portable register we use at Black Friday but we don't normally have access to it and it's a GM level decision to throw us another register not even including the lack of floor space we already have and having to move displays. I don't know where you guys have every shopped before [but I can't make a new register magically pop out of my ass and I'm sure you've never shopped in a store that has miraculously built a new register station right before your eyes.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl_Qyk9DSUw) \n\nUPDATE 1: Loss Prevention is trying to get us a “waiver” for this policy until something more permanent can be implemented.  \n\n\nFINAL UPDATE?: Okay so we had a new waiver policy implemented for the gun counter. It’s back to the old ways so everyone but management is happy. \n\nMy immediate supervisor (not manager) was getting extremely pissed at me and our other supervisor for following the policy as it meant he actually had to do something customer wise instead of “placing orders and doing critical inventory”. He was fine with the policy until we told him we were following it until we had a new peace of paper to sign saying we wouldn’t get in trouble. He didn’t realize how badly it would affect him whenever he was the one with the drawer. Being the only full-timer meant that was the majority of store hours. \n\nSo...\n\nMy immediate manager sent an email to the general manager that brought up points we made as employees but better worded. She also added in how having multiple associates work on one sale would lead to an increase in issues when submitting our federal and state forms. \n\nNew waiver for us and the GM said we would be getting a new register that has two drawers. However, he has also told us we would have a larger space to sell guns and that hasn’t happened. So bets are being placed on this falling through as well. \n",

        "text": "So this happened 1 or 2 years ago when I was still working for a really big supermarket chain down under. Our store was one of the most important stores in the state, especially in the department for which I was under, Seafood. \n\nThe supermarket chain was losing a lot of customers then, due to credibility, failed revamp of customer loyalty program and bad executive control over the chain. We were told to try and reduce waste as part of a program, and the food waste would be donated.\n\nThen came a new store manager. This manager works by the book, you cannot bend the rules even if its for customers. So usually in our 'fresh departments' (i.e. deli, meat, seafood, bakery) we have strict sell-by day policy (for Food Safety reasons) and also our in-store discounting/reductions accounts for this. Because this SM wanted to look good, I guess he would always yell/complain at us for reducing stuff early even if we have a huge amount of stock, for example 12kg of pre-package crumbed whitings in 400g packs, when this typically occurs we would normally excessively discount the product (i.e. 60% 1 day before the Best Before Date), but usually this SM would just mark it down himself for around 30% - i.e. the standard, we usually do this but excessive wise we usually try and sell them out so we don't have to dump them.\n\nThis happened on a day when my Department Manager wasn't in. Usually in our store, Tuesdays-Sundays are the busiest, Mondays are really quiet, well not so much (in terms of sales just the Weekend along would account for around 55% of the weeks sales). Like most \"fresh departments\", my DM usually works Tuesdays to Saturdays. \n\n**Me:** Hey SM, we have 30kg of Fresh Salmon which are about to go past Best Before Date in 2 days. Can we mark it down by 60%\n\n**SM:** Nah, they can reduce it tomorrow.\n\n**Me:** But........\n\n**SM:** No, I told you no.\n\nI thought \"ok,  have it your way'. That night after close, we had around 30kg left. I texted my DM and left.\n\nI found out the following shift that we had to dump around 20kg of Salmon, because they didn't sell out before their best before date. \n\nThe SM was slightly pissed at me \"for not following my initiative\", luckily my DM defended me saying that I told what had happened and had told the Area Manager, and it then turned out the AM got pissed at him.\n\nThe SM didn't last long after that, he left a couple of months later and transferred to the Wines stores of the Supermarket Group.\n\ntl;dr SM didn't listen to an employee who actually works in the departments, causes a large dump and gets scolded by the Area Manager.\n\nEDIT: Grammar and spelling.\n\nP.s. Wow! This post has hit 2.6k karma, never expected to gain so much traction! ",

        "text": "So I finally got the opportunity to share a malicious compliance story. This one is of the legal variety. I am a law student and had the opportunity to shadow some attorneys for a local jurisdiction (city attorney's office) in court recently. I will leave out identifying details but I can describe the situation. \n\nToday the Attorney I am shadowing who represents the city's social services department had a scheduled hearing in an adult protective services case. Basically, this old guy who has dementia and is essentially bed-ridden had been staying with his son who previously had the power of attorney (the target of the MC, let's call him C) and the family began to suspect that there was neglect, stealing from the dad's finances, and general lack of proper care. I read the report and it was not looking good for this guy, he seemed like a real piece of work. So over about the last year, eventually the family got adult protective services to step in and get the guy proper care. By all reports, he is doing much better now. However, the court still needed to decide the matter of whether to fully revoke C's power of attorney and hand it over the his sister or not. \n\nAbout three weeks ago, a Judge granted a continuance in the case (just a reason to delay the hearing for various reasons) so that the son could obtain proper legal counsel (totally fine, everyone needs good representation) and the matter had been scheduled to go to the full hearing today. Anyway, CV comes into court claiming that he had spoken with some  attorneys but for whatever reason, he was unable to get an attorney for this hearing (it can be hard to get an attorney but the guy seemed to just be dragging his feet). So the Judge begins to hear his and the city's arguments for whether to extend the continuance. This was somewhat a problem for the city because they had all the witnesses (family, social services workers) and evidence ready for the hearing today but, again, everyone is entitled to adequate legal counsel. \n\nThe Judge hears the evidence on both sides and is clearly starting to seriously consider granting the continuation. He looks at the schedule and finds that one of the only times in the near future to come back to court is about two weeks from now. Well, this wasn't good enough for C because he got all huffy and sort of had a bit of a fit over there not being enough time. He gets frustrated and finally says \"you know what? fine, just do what you see fit, judge!\" and sits down in a huff. \n\nWell, this is where the MC comes into play, because you could see the judge was full of this guys crap and he gets a great look on his face. He starts to get this really great look on his face like he's cooking up something great in his head. So he says, \"huh, you know what? I think it suits me to have the full hearing right now. Please call your first witness, Ms. City Attorney.\" He. was. livid. but he had the good sense to not get too mad and only said something to the effect of \"fine! They were just going to lie about me and say the same thing next time!\" and sits down with even more of a huff than last time. \n\nNow, this is totally within the Judge's discretion because the guy has had weeks and weeks to obtain counsel if he wanted it and all the witnesses were already there, ready to start the hearing. The witnesses are all called and C is given an opportunity to speak where he essentially calls out his siblings for trying to undermine him and that his father loves him and blah blah. Finally, the judge hears all the evidence and tell the City Attorney to hand him the order she drafted which revoked his power of attorney, gave power of attorney to his sister, and grated a temporary conservator to handle the dad's finances. It was glorious. 10/10 would court again.  ",

This poor girl had to choose between clogging a toilet with her granny sized menstrual pad, or carrying it out of the bathroom with her to dispose of at the garbage can by the register.\n\nI go yet again to my boss to try and convince him to install some sanitary bins, even showing him how cheap they can be, and he dismisses me yet again this time saying “I don’t have time to listen to this”\n\nLater as I’m about to clock out, still fuming from the fact that we can’t even dispose of our pads in a healthy manner, my boss asks to speak with me privately.\nI beamed, this was my moment, my boss was going to tell me that he put in a maintenance request. NOPE! He just wanted me to start getting more surveys filled out from the receipts\n\nSo I did just that.\n\nI asked every single woman in my line, every dad with his daughter, and just about anyone that I thought would really care to fill out a survey.\nI circled the survey url, along with my managers name and asked them to write “Why does WaySafe not care about women?” Along with an explanation as to why I was going this route\n\n1 month and MANY reviews later I find out from another co-worker that they finally ordered sanitary bins to be installed\n\nI also had the most reviews filled that month!\n",

        "text": "For over 2 1/2 years I've been the graphic artist for a small(ish) hometown newspaper. For two full years I was the ONLY artist on staff; so I handled all the advertisements and promotional material as well as doing some non-creative production work and page-setup. Some weeks, especially if there was a special-section or two in a month's time, it was simply impossible for me to get all the work done in a 40 hour week (and not because I work too slow, but because I do good work). So I used to pick up some OT, usually only 2 or 3 hours a week but sometimes an extra 8 or 10. Well eventually the publisher (who's a good guy, but a business man in the end) tells me he can't afford to pay me OT and I'll have to use comp time. Fine and dandy. Thing is there was never any time I could actually take off, in order to cover the comp time. I was the only person here who could do my job. So the comp-time built up and built up to where I had like 50 hours the company owed me. Eventually, I was finally given part-time help (15 hours a week, but I'll take it). And I SLOWLY managed to erase all that comp time. So at my 2-year anniversary, I discussed the possibility of a raise with my boss (hadn't had one yet; STILL haven't had one, and currently making at least $2 – $3 an hour less than average for my type of position). He said in the next few months he would look at the revenue and see what he could do. Well you know how far that went. So meanwhile, since I've had the extra help, the job has been far less stressful and I've had many weeks that I've actually worked only 32 to 38 hours. Almost all of them, actually. But being that we don't punch a time clock, I put 40 hours on my time sheet. Every. Single. Week. My reasoning is; if there's no over time (when it is truly needed), then there's no under-time, either.",

        "text": "Last summer, I worked as a nanny for a family that had a very...interesting living arrangement. The kids were a 6 year old, a 5 year old, and 3 year old triplets...and not well-behaved in the slightest. \n\nSome backstory: The mother and father had just moved the family in with her parents, and I was under the impression that they were in the process of building a house on some nearby land. The mother's job was an hour and a half to two hours commute and she worked really long shifts, so I hardly saw her after she initially hired me, but she was my main source of contact through texting about caring for the kids, getting payed, things that the kids needed, things she needed me to do around the house (pertaining to the kids ONLY, this is important), etc. The father worked and often went on jobs that were several hours away, too. The grandma was super sweet and I honestly loved her and felt bad that she had to put up with her monster of a husband. Grandma worked outside of the house, too. \n\nAnd dear lord, there was the grandfather. This man was the nastiest, most ill-tempered, cruel, and narcissistic person I may have ever met. Unfortunately (for me *and* the kids), he worked about half of his time from home, and would occasionally be around the house from 7am-noon-ish when I would otherwise be alone with the kids. He would constantly embarrass the kids in front of me, particularly the oldest kid. He was ridiculously controlling and would impose weird rules on the kids, such as telling them that they had to sit in a certain chair without making any noise for a arbitrary period of time. One of his favorite activities was forcing me into long, judgmental conversations in which he would ask me lots of questions and then try to make me look incompetent or stupid based on my answers. I'm talking like, the stupidest, most irrelevant shit ever. Example convo, where grandfather will be G, and I will be me:\n\nG: The lawn isn't getting enough water and you keep letting the kids run around in the yard and they're killing it. You need to leave the yard alone and let the sprinklers do their job.\n\nMe: Okay, I'll keep the kids on the driveway. I know what you mean about the grass having a hard time in all this heat, my dad has been watering our yard every day, too.\n\nG: Every day?! Didn't you know we're in the middle of a drought? Your father is breaking \"insert law against watering your yard.\"\n\nMe: Um, we have a well. \n\nSo this fuck-wad was the biggest pain in my ass, but I sucked it up and tried to just be overly polite and somewhat boring, because I was getting paid a lot to watch these kids and I didn't work for him, but I was still in his house. He would mostly bother me once or twice a day with some bullshit and I would just ignore it as best as I could. \n\nSo near the end of my time with them, the kitchen had become infested with those tiny black ants that get into everything. The grandfather had a bunch of people out to fix the problem, but nothing was working, and no one in the house was trying to keep things sanitary or clean in the slightest.\n\nI was at the sink, washing all of the kids' dishes, like I always did. Anything the kids used, or I used to cook for them, was immediately washed, dried, and put away. Everything else, I left for the other FOUR adults who lived in this house, and who created those dishes. There was tons of crap in there, plus the ants, and I was really just trying to hurry up and do something else with the kids. \n\nThe grandfather comes in and makes a bee-line for me at the sink and we have the following exchange:\n\nG: You need to make sure all of these dishes are done! I'm very busy today, and I don't want to see anything in this sink when I come home!\n\nMe: Okay, sure. \n\nI'm completely over him at this point, so I finish up the kids dishes and get them out of the way. The sink was still full of disgusting dishes with food still on them, dirty pots and pans full of water and the remains of a meal, and ants. Lots of ants. So I carefully forced each and every dirty, un-rinsed, ant-covered dish into the dishwasher. It was like Jenga in there, I mean, I put every single dish in that dishwasher, whether it fit or not. \n\nThen, the kids *really* needed me for some Very Important Reason, and I just happened to forget to turn the dishwasher on before doing my actual job for the rest of the day. \n\nI managed to get out of there before he got home from work that day, and never had a single request from him again. I only wish I could have seen his face when he realized that his dishwasher was now also infested with ants. ",

They didn't feel comfortable giving a knife of any kind to a drunk person, so refused. \n\nAfter a couple minutes of trying to order my food and being interrupted, the cashier snatches the burger in its box and hands it to the chef. 20 seconds later, after I've finally ordered, the chef reappears with her burger.

The girl stared at her burger for a minute before quietly walking out of the shop.\n\n\n*I should say, it was late and one of the few food places still open. There were only two people working, the cashier taking the orders, and the chef.

        "text": "Hello All, apologies for the absence, on the mobile between scenes so apologies once again for any formatting issues :)\n\nBack in the warehouse days, when it came to customers picking up their orders it was a shit show. \n\nIt took a lot of damages, issues and complaints, until I put it to the higher ups to actually outline on their sales dockets terms and conditions  that would protect the company and also protects us warehouse workers.\n\nWhen customers came to pick furniture up, whatever it was ( sofa, coffee table, rug), usually the warehouse staff had handled that product over a hundred times, and had figured out the safest way to go about loading / unloading / stocking said product.\n\nThis particular Thursday afternoon we had a sofa bed come in, that was scheduled for a customer pickup.\n\nI grabbed the transfer sheet, called up the customer and explained that we had their sofabed, and that as per the terms and conditions of the sales docket could the customer please bring a 2nd able bodied person to help load up the goods. \n\nI also mentioned  that unfortunately the warehouse workers weren’t covered to load up customers orders into a customers personal vehicle.\n\nLo and behold, come 3.30pm the customer shows up in a fancy black truck, with a small flat bed area, and no one to help him.\n\nImmediately this guy strikes us as an “alpha male” type. He’s going through all these theatrics of measuring his flat bed and exclaiming loudly to everyone in ear shot.... “yeah this brand new, super expensive truck is going to be able to handle this sofa bed no problem!!”\n\nI sigh and ask the customer where his 2nd person is.\n\nAlpha male - No need, one of you boys can help me lift... \n\nMe - ( almost second nature now ) sir, as per the sales agreement you signed off on:  any and all customer pickups must be done by the customer as no warehouse staff are able to help—\n\nAlpha - what are you a pussy ?\n\nI just shake my head, this guy is going to make our lives miserable. So I talk to my team, tell them to keep working through the transfer stock, and tell the Alpha douche that I’ll help him load up quickly.\n\nHis shoots me a victorious self satisfied smirk, and begins to jump up into his truck, just to make sure we all know “he’s got this under control”\nI use a flat trolley to wheel the sofa bed over and he grabs the flimsy plastic covering the sofa.\n\nHe starts giving me directions, in a loud and authoritative voice, that he wants me to kind of balance the sofa against the side of his car and then lift it up to him.\n\nI point out that it’s actually easier if we both lift from ground level, into the back of his truck, and then use the rope he’s brought along to secure the sofa bed.\n\nAlpha - bullshit, I’ll grab this plastic, you lift and we’ll lean it against the roof.\n\nI point out the sofa bed has metallic feet, and that despite that packaging, there’s a possibility it could damage his NEW vehicle.\n\nAlpha - ( with a shit eating grin ) haven’t you boys heard that the customer is always right? Just do it MY way!!\n\nMe - you got it\n\nI get the customer to sign off on the paperwork that he’s is taking his sofa, that it’s in good condition and that by picking up the sofa instead of getting it delivered he takes on all responsibility.\n\nHe jumps back up onto the flat bed of his truck, and kind of braces one leg against the roof of his truck.\n\nI start to lift slowly, but Alpha overcompensates. He yanks at the plastic, which causes the sofa to lurch up out of my hands. The plastic splits, the guy realises he now has to control this behemoth of a lounge suite.\n\nGravity takes over, as the guy tries to control the sofa which is beginning to roll out of his truck.\n\nI try and grab at it, but there’s no way to salvage this, the customer holds on as best as he can, but let’s put a yelp as his wrist turns at a strange angle.\n\nThe sofa bed rolls out of the truck, and the metal feet scrape the paint work on the side of his truck, leaving these horrendous deep scratches.\n\nEveryone is silent. The look of shock on the customers face turns to volition rage as he begins berating the shit out of myself and the warehouse guys.\n\nHe storms into the sales area and grabs the Manager.\n\nI helpfully point out the customer signed off on the delivery slip, refused to bring a helper, and when I tried to talk him out of it, demanded we do it HIS way.\n\n",

        "text": "This one isn't mine, but I watched it happened over the course of two days. I'm not all that good at telling stories so if this isn't any good I'll take it down.\n\nNot too long ago I worked for a concrete molding place. We would pour and open statuary molds and things like lamp post bases or lawn decorations. The players are Me: Me, a less physical position on the job. Boss Man: BM, ran the warehouse. And Statuary Manager: SM, handled the statue section of the wearhouse.\n\nWhile I wasn't on the warehouse floor that did the pours, I moved through there a lot and learned how it worked. Fiber glass mold shells that did the basic shape, and rubber inserts that would handle the detail.\n\nThe thing about the rubber inserts is that they were a nightmare to replace. BM (Normally a great guy, but like everyone on some days just wasn't a person you wanted to get the attention of. ) wanted any inserts with even a slight tear to be brought to him for repair so we wouldn't have to spend months and a lot of money making a new one. They would have to be handled rather roughly to get them off the concrete after it has set, clean of any clinging bits or dust and put back into a mold shell to be used again. This lead to them getting damaged some times and pulled off the line to be repaired. \n\nOne day I was on the floor talking to SM as he was reassembling some molds when I saw a small tear on of the more elaborate inserts. It was a small one, but more then enough to ruin a statue.\n\nMe: Oh, need to pull this one off the line. It's got a tear near the top.\nSM: Ah hell, I'll handle it. \n\nWith that SM quickly took the insert over to BM who unfortunately was having one of his bad days. I couldn't hear the conversation over the sound of loud music and work being done, it was a warehouse after all. But I imagine it was your standard 'I don't have time for this, just do it' conversation. That's when SM came back still holding the insert, and I was proven right.\n\nSM: He told me to use it anyway.\nMe: That will come apart the next time it's pulled off of a statue wont it?\nSM: Badly, yeah. And it will ruin the detail. But he said use it, so go and write up a loss ticket ahead of time for me please.\nMe: I'll get on that.\n\nThe next day when molds started being opened I was waiting, knowing exactly what was going to happen. It didn't take long for shouting from statuary as an insert was tore nearly in half, and a statue broke in half. BM was furious as he had to come to me to get paper work started on ordering a new insert. \n\nAll in all he took it very well when SM explained he tried to tell him and was told to use it anyway. No trouble was started aside from a sizable check having to be written.\n",

        "text": "Last summer, I was working this awful sales associate job at a baby clothes store. \n\nIt was only supposed to be a part-time gig to make some spending money, but we were very short staffed and within a few weeks I was working full-time...much to my disdain.\n\nI hated the minimum wage salary, the mundane tasks that came with my job, and my borderline unbearable boss. \n\nShe treated me with such disrespect and constantly yelled at me in front of our coworkers and customers whenever she felt that I didn't do a task up to her standards. And by \"standards\", I mean being done in the quickest way possible. She always had us cut corners with everything, even important things like cashing out the registers at the end of the day.\n\nI would have been able to deal with her hard ass attitude if she wasn't also equal parts incompetent and hypocritical. Honestly, those two words don't do her justice, but they are as close as I can come to describing her. \n\nTo elaborate on her incompetence, the first thing I realized about her was that she couldn't do basic addition. On my second day, she was cashing out the registers and became furious when she came to the conclusion that two of them were short. \n\nI got yelled at for stealing for a good 5 minutes before asking her if I could recount the money myself because I didn't think there was any way the register could be short. Lo and behold, when I recounted the money, it came out exactly to what it was supposed to be. \n\nAfter a couple more identical instances, I began to count the registers before she would do her final check at the end of the day so I could avoid getting yelled at if she messed up again. \n\nAnd then the hypocrisy...the woman who had to made sure everyone cut corners to be efficient as possible was the absolute biggest time waster. She would disappear for hours every shift using her phone in the stock room. Yet, she still had the audacity to chew me out and yell at me for taking an extra minute to restock a rack of clothes. \n\nIn summation, she was infuriating and almost pushed me to quit twice a week. \n\nBy the end of the summer, I was really done with her shit. \n\nThen, maybe two weeks before I was going back to school, the incident happened. It was a slow Sunday and I was in the middle of working a grueling 14 hour double shift.  \n\nI was sweeping the sales floor when I saw a customer run out of the store, pulling her 5 year old behind her out the door. \n\nInstantly, I thought she was a shoplifter. We dealt with a significant amount of theft so I didn't think twice about it. I just followed protocol (not trying to stop her once she left the store and notifying my boss of the incident).\n\nAfter that, I just returned to my sweeping. I didn't even give it a second thought until a couple minutes later when I came across something unexpected on the floor.\n\nSmack dab in the middle of the aisle was a MASSIVE poop. It was wet, tinged green, and almost made me throw up just looking at it. \n\nI walked to the back to find my boss...and I told her about the poop, asking what we should do about it.\n\nShe replied in a completely insidious tone. \"Well, you're going to pick it up and get it out of the store. That's what YOU'RE going to do. I don't even know why you wasted my time by coming to ask me.\"\n\nI didn't think that was fair...not at all. Nowhere did it say in the job description that I would have to deal with human feces, especially since we didn't have a restroom or materials to correctly dispose of it. \n\nI told her all of that...and it would be an understatement to say she wasn't pleased. She went straight for an ultimatum, telling me that I could either do it or I'd be fired. \n\nSo you know what I did? I listened to her. \n\n\"Okay,\" I replied. \"I'll pick it up and get it out of the store.\"\n\nI took one of our gift bags and used it to pick up the disgusting poop, knowing exactly what I was going to do with it. \n\nI was going to follow her golden rule: finish my tasks as quickly as possible, even if it cuts corners. \n\nI walked to the front of the store, opened the door, and stepped only a foot outside. Then I turned over the bag and let the gross poop fall out, right onto the welcome mat that displayed our company logo. \n\nI had completed my task, picking up the poop and moving it out of the store...in the quickest way possible. \n\nAfter that, I turned around and walked back inside. Unsurprisingly, no one else ventured into the store for the rest of the shift, clearly put off by the human feces on the doorstep.\n\nMy boss and I ended up leaving the store together at the end of the shift. She locked the door behind us before turning around and noticing the poop right beneath her feet.\n\n\"Is that...the poop from this afternoon?!?\" she stammered in a confused fit of anger.\n\n\"Yes, yes it is. I did exactly what you told me to do. I picked up the poop and got it out of the store in the fastest way possible, just how you like. Oh, and by the way, I quit.\"\n\nShe just stood there, stunned. \n\nI calmly turned around and walked to my car, not looking back. It was the greatest feeling.\n",

I know the sign and lockbox are worth a few hundred bucks at least, so I called him up and let him know he left them at my new house, said to leave the lockbox at the front door and the huge wood sign in the garage for his assistant to pick up. About a week later, still not picked up. I don’t like keeping this huge sign in my garage. \n\n I call a second time to let him know they are not picked up yet. I wait another week and still no contact. I call him one more time and let him know I am setting them out and no longer wish to keep holding them for him. He tells me he will have someone there in the morning to pick them up for sure this time at the curb.  I put both by the curb, as he requested. Now, bulk trash pick up is on Friday, it’s Wednesday. Guess who picked up his huge sign and the lock box on Friday. \n",

Think like a Subway. \n\nSo every Sunday, we have a regular couple come in and order the same pizzas. They always want triple extra of every topping they order, to the point where they have a tower of a pizza. \n\nWell, we never put enough to satiate these two, and they always complain to the manager who caves instantly and gives them a free meal. Every. Damn. Time.\n\nOne day a few weeks ago, I answer the call and the husband yells that we \"only put 27 pieces of pineapple\" on a personal size pizza. Yes, he counted just to complain.\n\nQue the compliance. For the past few weeks, I always load their pizzas up in such a way that when they go to eat a slice, everything topples off so what reaches their mouths is only crust and sauce. But hey, they get triple extra toppings for no upcharge.\n\nAt first they complimented me when I showed them, not having tried to eat them yet. So I kept adding more and more toppings over the weeks. (They still called and complained, and were generally assholes to get free food).\n\nSo today they come dine in instead of calling in, and as smiley and customer service like as I can, I ask them if they want the usual. I start loading them up, and they sheepishly say they only want the normal amount of toppings for the store. Hopefully they stop trying to get free food and yelling at my co-workers from now on. \n\nTldr, two regular customers keep asking for \"triple extra\" toppings and complaining to the manager it isn't enough for a cycle of free food. I give them exactly what they ask for and it literally falls apart in their faces. ",

It's needed.  But I hate it.)   \n\n \nThere are many rules here with perfectly important justifications  but which I detest.  Like I can't get out of a chair,  get dressed,  get a glass of water, go to the bathroom,  get out of bed,  transfer from a wheelchair to a bed,  etc. without being watched in case I fall.  I've accidentally set off alarms just from rolling over on bed.    \n\n  To get help,  I have to press a call light,  wait for help,  then get to do whatever simple thing I need to do while someone monitors me.   It's mind numbingly infuriating to lose so much independence.   I would love to ignore these rules,  but a.) I adore the people who work here and will not disrespect them b.) I have to follow the rules to show good insight so I can go home sooner.  \n  \n\n      \n\n\nSo today I was sitting up in a chair doing exercises when my pain levels decided to get crazy high.   That happens every so often.  I go from a tolerable  6/10 to 8+/10 plus sweats and shakes and all that fun stuff. I needed to lay down asap and get some break through pain meds.   And this is the one time the call light is not within reach of me,  but on the other side of the room.  So I do a half hour of embarrassing writhing and whimpering before I decide its time for some malicious compliance.  Without my butt leaving the seat (and thus setting off an alarm and getting myself and others in trouble), I very slowly use my weak ass legs to drag this huge heavy lounge chair I'm sitting in over closer to the call light wire.   From there I do a few rounds of acrobatics (all the while making sure most of my weight stays on my butt to keep the alarm gods happy)  and finally can reach the wire.  I do some fishing,  drop the thing a couple times,  pick it back up,  and finally,  45 min later I press the damn button.   \nI get the meds,  get to lay down,  and after an hour of recovering,  I'm feeling very accomplished.   I hope they don't end up having to make up any new rules because of me.      \n\n  \nTldr:  I adhere to the letter of the safety rules instead of the intent.",

        "text": "Apologize for length but the details are still fresh in my mind...tl;dr at bottom\n\nFirst job out of college (besides that 1 day I put in at a call center). \n\nIt was a small, family-owned apartment company in a midwestern city. I was hired as a rental agent. It was great. I had my own office and I kept my own schedule. Left to my own devices, I discovered that I was ambitious and loved working hard. The lobby was always full of prospective clients and I made great sales. The owners were both my direct supervisors. Both elderly and conservative but they loved me and I wanted to make them glad they had hired me. \n\nThe job was only 5 months long (during the busy summer rental season) but at the end of it, they said that they would love to have me back next summer since I had done such a good job. So being somewhat burned out by 22 years of schooling I just decided to not work again the rest of the year and live off the bundle I had made working there. \n\nI called in spring of the next year and they were glad to hear from me, told me when my start date would be and even said they could rent me a discounted apartment if I needed one. Awesome. I move and am living in one of my own buildings. Same as the year before, I am happy and ambitious. I have no commute and once again I chase every lead I can. This time I know the ropes and I become far more involved with other aspects of the business, including coordinating maintenance, delivery of post, and even fill in as the receptionist. At the end of another summer, they tell me how great I am and that, once again, I have a job lined up. \n\nOnce again I decided to just take the rest of the year off. I am thinking that it's only a matter of time before I get offered a full-time job since my boss was the only other rental agent and he was getting close to retirement. I spend the year in my cheap (but nice) apartment and even continue coming into the office at least an hour a day to fill in at reception. Sometimes I work full days if they need an extra body. Whatever they need, I was committed to them. \n\nThen came the third summer. My first day back on the job and I am in a meeting with my boss’s son, who we’ll call Chad. Chad was a fresh graduate of business school and he had started work at his family’s business.  He seemed to take delight in telling me on my first day back that he is cutting my commission by 50%. He tells me to my face that he could easily hire a new college grad to work for even less and I should be grateful they are willing to give me as much as they are. \n\nBoth of my supervisors were present at the meeting and they both looked very uncomfortable, but they didn’t intervene. I was shocked. Even if what he told me was true, there’s no way you should speak to loyal employees like that. He did say I could earn a $1500 bonus at the end of the summer, but this was not put in writing and the conditions to earn it were not defined. I just assumed I wouldn’t see it. He said that it was so they could get a better effort out of me, but I figured this was just a generic move out of some MBA textbook somewhere since I had always done more than my share for this business and he hadn’t even been there to witness most of it. Chad’s mom and uncle had both brought me back 2 times after my first summer since they liked me.\n\nAt this point, I had been waiting all year for this job and despite this ominous sign I still wanted to try and get a full-time job with them. But I was furious from the start and decided that if Chad wanted a better effort from me, he would have it. \n\nSince Chad was my new supervisor I went to work on him, sucking up to him and generally reserving myself around him to lull him into a false sense of security. Meanwhile, I never worked harder. I accepted every single appoint I could to show apartments no matter what time of day they were at. My favorite were weekends when I could book one early and one late appointment. I would sit in the vacant office all day on my computer earning overtime, even though in the past I would have just gone home and gone off the clock. \n\nMy campaign against Chad had worked and he would regularly sign my time cards without seeming to realize what was going on. But I was earning so much overtime that I was actually getting more money than before when I got a large commission for my sales. I was working 70 hours a week, but I was determined that Chad not screw me out of money I rightfully felt was mine. \n\nEventually, Chad’s mom saw me at the office at 10 pm on a Wednesday and after investigating told me I was taking way too much overtime. Things began to deteriorate at that point and at the end of the summer, they told me I had earned 0 of my $1500 bonus (even though I had literally worked every single day of the summer, including weekends and holidays) and did not ask me back again. But I had figured that in the end, they wouldn’t have hired me anyway because I wasn’t family. \n\nI still ended up making more than any previous summer and had another 7 cheap months left on my lease so in the end they still did right by me, but I felt betrayed by Chad and disillusioned that a company I had worked so hard and well for could behave so callously towards me. I had thought that all companies looked for were dedicated and loyal employees, and since they had asked me back so many times, I thought I was doing it right. I learned that hard work and rewards were not necessarily linked, a tough lesson for a kid just out of college. \n\nTl;dr: New MBA supervisor cuts my commission in half and tells me he could easily replace me and that I needed to improve my effort, so I worked 70 hours a week for several months and earn just as much. \n",

The only thing is that there are other to-go orders that I have to take care of as well, both before and after his order. So, I’m checking to make sure everything is right in his order and filling up the cups with his extra sauce.\n\nNow the then-manager and owner doesn’t like us to give out too much sauce, telling us hostess to only fill halfway. Well, I have other orders to take care of, not to mention customers waiting to be seated too so I fill them a little more, one cup with a little more than the other. \n\nThe guy comes in, pays for his food and leaves. He calls within five minutes, complaining that his food isn’t what he ordered. I tell him to come back so we can fix it. I go talk to the chef. The chef says that it’s the right food but remakes it. The guy looks at it and says that it’s not right. I go back to talk to the chef, who lets out a huff, clearly frustrated. \n\nHowever, one of the server comes in and explains that this guy likes his food a certain way, which would’ve been easier if he told me in the first place, as I still have other orders and customers waiting for a table. As I come out to explain to the guy, he snaps at me for not getting his order right. And then he complains about his sauce cups, for them not being the same amount. \n\nWell then. \n\nI open up his sauce cups and tell him sweetly that goodness me, it seems that he’s right, the sauces weren’t the right amount. I’ve given him too much than allowed and I’ll fix it right away. Without another word to him, I take the sauce cups away and come back with two cups, both halfway filled with sauce like how I’m supposed to. I present them with a bright smile to him and he’s huffing and muttering under his breath as he throws them into his bag. When his order is done the way he likes it, he doesn’t have anything else to say, though he does give me a dirty look when I tell him to have a good day. ",

        "text": "I worked minimum wage as a retail EVERYTHING. I mean, I was half manager, half cashier floor worker, half inventory... What I'm trying to say is, I did too many things. But this was a small business, mom and pop style shop. There were only three of us at a time running the whole operation. These were family friends. I felt I had a responsibility to this family. Minimum wage wasn't enough for a stranger, but it was enough for me... For a while.\n\nAfter three years, I had tripled their business profits. I know this because one of my many tasks involved balancing the books. I knew exactly what our sales numbers were. I knew our profit margins. I knew what our inventory cost. I knew our landlord on a first name basis and I knew what bills we paid. I was good at my job. This store was like my family and I made them proud. My wage had not increased in those three years, but looking at the numbers, I thought now was a good time to bring it up. So I did. It was November, entering December. I asked for a dollar more, and my boss agreed.\n\nThat December my boss \"forgot\" to pay me. I had nothing to cover my Christmas holiday. The next month he didn't mention it at all when I returned to work after the holiday... I had to remind him that he was nearly seven weeks overdue. When he finally paid me, he did not include the raise we had agreed upon, so I brought it up again to ask for clarification. He sat me down in the back room and told me he couldn't believe how demanding I was, that in all his years, he'd never seen someone act so rude and disrespectful to their elders. If we were strangers I'd have left on the spot, but we were family. I was in tears.\n\nBut I was also very, very angry.\n\nHe wanted to go on his own holiday. He wanted to go for three weeks. But to teach me a lesson in respect, he also wanted to slash my hours. What's a store owner to do? He hired a new employee to cover the hours he was cutting from my schedule. He made me train the new girl for him, to teach me \"respect.\" After this training period, my shifts went from four days a week to one day a week. This way he could give me a decent raise on paper but pay me a quarter of what he did before, and his new employee accepted the lowest minimum wage. I didn't object. As a last ditch effort to save the business, I offered to spread my shift out and come in for one hour at the end of each day to check the new employee's numbers, but he refused. He wanted me to feel bad. I felt terrible... For my boss.\n\nAs hard as I tried, the new employee had never understood numbers. I had tried and failed to teach her how to calculate her sales numbers at the end of each shift. This poor girl was straight out of high school and had too many other subjects to think about. If we'd had more time for training, she probably would have learned it, but my boss cut my hours too short for me to go in depth about it, and who was I to argue with his schedule?\n\nThat's why, when he went on holiday and I couldn't be around to check this girl's work during the rest of the week, the business lost money. On the days I wasn't scheduled to work, thousands of dollars in sales went unaccounted for. Hundreds of dollars of cash were miscounted. Numbers were typed incorrectly into our computer system, rendering our inventory counts useless. After three weeks, he returned to an absolute mathematical nightmare. The sales numbers from my three days of work were perfectly accounted for, and three times higher than what our system reported we sold the rest of the week, although who knows what the real numbers were.\n\nI think this made him angry. He really wanted to teach me a lesson in humility. In my last full shift, a customer tried to return something large, and I told them our store policy to the letter: only my boss had the power to return that item. To make sure it would be returned properly, I did write a note on their receipt that they had tried to return it to me but I was following store policy and leaving it for my boss to handle when he returned from his holiday. Apparently, according to the angry reviews left on our social media, he refused to accept the return and told the customer she was \"a stupid idiot\" for believing me.\n\nIn my next scheduled shift, I asked him point blank if the review was true, and he laughed about it. He told me he was just showing us all who's boss. He admitted to the whole thing. He also mentioned he was giving me more hours as a reward for all my hard work. He wanted me to come in every day from now on to review all the numbers. I came clean: he'd given me a lot of time off in the past few weeks, and during that time I'd found a new job. I made it clear, also, that I had never once disobeyed his instructions or broken store policy. Every action I'd taken had left a paper trail. However, he had broken every single agreement he'd made with me: my payday dates, my wages, my scheduled hours. Things that could be proven by my expert paper trail to our Ministry of Labour. And his behaviour and comments around customers were posted on every social media review, which he admitted to, so I knew exactly what he thought of me. I was only there to hand over the keys to the store.\n\nHe cried. He couldn't look me in the eyes. Part of me is sad, because for a long time, we were family. Since my departure, reviews of my old family-run shop have absolutely tanked.  Meanwhile, my new job is incredibly wholesome, my hours are solid, my benefits are excellent, and my rates are triple what I made before.\n\nAnd I wouldn't be here if I hadn't followed instructions to the letter. I've learned so much about respect.",

My co-driver, Benny, didn't like driving at night, so I generally got to enjoy an almost empty road, mostly devoid of assholes...mostly.  It was the dead of night, and I was cruising up I-5, when I saw headlights coming up the onramp.  I moved over to the left lane, so they wouldn't have to slow down at the merge, but they slow down anyway and start pacing the truck.  \n  \nIf you want to annoy a truck driver, hang out on the passenger side of their truck.  If you really want to annoy them, hang out next to their passenger door, where you can only be seen in the fisheye mirrors.  I can't see what this guy is doing, so I slow down in the hopes he will pass; he slows down to match me.  I speed up; he speeds up.  Having someone intentionally block you from changing lanes is something of a nightmare for drivers, so I'm getting concerned.  If there is a problem ahead, and this asshole is still pacing me, things could get very dangerous.  \n  \nThen he starts hitting his horn.  I crane my neck to make eye contact, worried that I there was something dragging under the trailer, or that one of my wheels was about to come off.  Nope, there is the asshole, with a big grin on his face, pumping his arm up and down, trying to get me to blow my air horn.  \n  \nNow, as I said, I drive a team truck.  That means one man drives, while the other sleeps in the bunk.  It also means that as a rule, we don't gratuitously blow that air horn.  I've had a co-driver fall asleep at the wheel.  He almost took us off a cliff (the guard rail held).  Making sure Benny gets enough sleep is way up on my priority list.  \n  \nOf course, that isn't happening anymore.  Asshole is pissed that I am ignoring him, but he perks up when Benny pokes his head out through the sleeper curtain.  He doesn't know that he has just woken Benny up.  He can't hear Benny cursing.  Asshole hits his horn to get Benny's attention, then hopefully pumps his arm some more.  Benny just gives him the evil eye.  \n  \nSomething to understand about Benny, Benny is Romanian; more than that, Benny is Romani.  He survived constant religious and ethnic persecution until his family was finally granted asylum in the United States.  Benny doesn't take shit from anyone, and he has absolutely no qualms about unleashing a 21st century gypsy curse on the poor bastard that just woke him up.  Eventually Asshole realizes that he isn't getting what he wants, flips us the bird and starts to accelerate.  As soon as he turns his head, Benny reaches past me and hauls down on the air horn cord.  \n  \nThere are, of course, two big, bright, shiny air horn trumpets on top of our cab.  They were impressively loud and probably would have made an expecting Asshole wet himself if they had worked.  They don't work; they aren't even hooked up to any air lines.  We keep them for the same reason we have [Squealy Nelson](https://www.raneystruckparts.com/productimage.php?product_id=76172&amp;current_image=0): America's highways are infested with Grues, and the only way to protect ourselves is by covering truck and trailer in chrome and chicken lights (This is 100% factual.  You can ask any trucker).  \n  \nOur functional air horn is mounted on the passenger tool box (the passenger side step).  It is there because it is not the kind of horn that goes *beep beep* or even the type that gives the full-throated honk that school children (and Asshole) always try to coax out of passing drivers.  No, this horn is there because it is the kind of massive, fuckoff aural weaponry that requires its very own air tank.  Usually we are in the right lane, and, usually, when we pull the cord, the noise blasts out over the empty shoulder.  We are not in the right lane.  \n  \nFrom about five feet away, the three-trumpet train horn howls 150 decibels of sonic surprise at an open window, and Asshole reacts like it's a wailing, rotoscoped banshee trying to give him a lapdance.  The car jerks sideways onto the shoulder, brakes hard and disappears as we round a bend.  Benny goes back to sleep, and I finish my shift without incident.  I can't be certain it was the same car, but the next set of headlights in my mirror slowed down when it got within a quarter mile of our truck and wouldn't come any closer for the 20 miles until it exited (we know it was him).  \n  \nTL/DR: Some jackass wakes up my co-driver in his attempt to get us to blow the air horn.  Co-driver waits until he isn't paying attention, then fires a 150 dB train horn, straight into his open window.",
