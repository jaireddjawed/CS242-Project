        "text": "A long post which I will probably remove tomorrow. It's the first chapter of a book I've been working on for 4 years about my marriage break-up. \n\nWe were married for 18 years and she ran off with a guy 25 years younger than me. This chapter describes what happened when I discovered she was cheating. I'm not proud of my behaviour but cannot change what I did. \n\n**Chapter 01**\n\n**08 August 2018** \n\n**Her:** Thanks for trying to understand me. You’re amazing.\n\n**Me:** Do you really mean that?\n\n**Her:** I do. Let’s take things slowly xxx\n\n**Me:** I’ll stop going through your emails.\n\n**Her:** And I’ll be honest with you from now on.\n\n**Me:** Thanks. The thing that’s held us together all these years is I still love you despite everything. \n\n**Her:** Yes. It’s an incredibly strong bond. I feel the same xxx\n\n**Me:** I hope so. These are desperate times.\n\n**Her:** Terrible.\n\n8:30am. My wife is on her way to work and already we’re texting. There have been so many texts lately. It’s been quite ridiculous. An absurd quantity. If we ever manage to sort out this mess I don’t think I’ll ever text anyone again for the rest of my life.\n\nToday I’m beginning the laborious process of removing wood chip paper from the walls of our daughter’s bedroom while she’s staying at her grandparents for the week. It’s a gesture of penance. Of self-flagellation. Whoever thought that wood chip paper was a good idea ought to be hung, drawn and quartered. I think it got its name because the only way to remove it is to literally chip it away using blood and sweat. So here I am with a bucket of hot water and a sharp stripping knife. This will be a very long job but I don’t mind. There’s music playing in the background, sunlight is filtering through the sash windows and for the first time in over a month I feel a tiny pinprick of positivity nestling away somewhere inside my sore head. \n\nThis is not to say that I am not disturbed as to the real meaning behind what I discovered on my wife’s computer two days ago. But she was so adamant that she was telling me the truth. Despite all that incriminating evidence it was obvious she wasn’t lying. Nobody is that good a liar. Least of all her. I know her too well. It’s simply not possible. So I carry on chipping away.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAt 10:30 I get another text from her:\n\n**Her:** Hi. How’s it going?\n\n**Me:** It’s exhausting but I'm really looking forward to going out with you tonight. We're going to have a great time. I promise I won’t mention anything about the other day.\n\n**Her:** Ahhh… Thanks. I’m looking forward to it as well xxx\n\n**Me:** xxx\n\n**Her:** I've just booked a counselling assessment.\n\n**Me:** I think that's very sensible.\n\n**Her:** I need help.\n\n**Me:** I think both of us do.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThere is a stubborn intensity to my efforts. I don’t even take a break for lunch. I chip away and I chip away without stopping. This wallpaper has probably been glued to these walls for two or three decades. There are several layers of the vile stuff, where previous owners have simply papered over the old wallpaper. If I can remove it all and get back to bare clean plaster it will be like making a fresh start. It’s what I’m going to do tonight when I meet my wife. I’m going to try to chip away all the crap that’s accumulated over the years and rediscover the woman I met so long ago. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nIt’s 4:00pm and my body can take it no more. Every part of me aches. My fingers are sore. My hands are so fatigued that they are no longer able to grip the stripping knife. I go downstairs and shower. In an hour I will leave the house and take a tube to London Bridge and meet my wife for our ‘first date’. \n\nI dry myself and go into the bedroom. I rifle through the wardrobe and carefully pick out the smartest clothes I can muster. I’m going to try and look my best for her tonight. I regard myself in the mirror and see a different person to who I was 41 days ago: thinner, firmer of jawline. I have lost so much weight during that time that I no longer have to hold my stomach in. I have a slight tan from sitting in the garden. My teeth are white. Despite the lack of sleep my eyes are clear. I tell myself I’m not in bad shape for a man of 56. Perhaps all this drama has actually done me some good.\n\nI go back into the living room to check my emails before I leave. As I do so I hear a ping from my wife’s laptop, signifying the arrival of a message. I know that I shouldn’t be doing this after my earlier text but I move over to her machine and take a brief look.\n\nA dozen or so emails have arrived since she left for the office this morning. I flick through them. One of them is a receipt for the Uber that she took from her work event last night. I have no idea why but I open it and read it. The temperature in the room drops and I find myself trembling. The receipt does indeed confirm that at 11:35pm my wife took an Uber home last night. The car picked her up from an address in Battersea. A familiar address. One that has been at the centre of all our recent problems: Parkham Street.\n\n“Oh my fucking God.” I speak the words out loud. I say them again: “Oh. My. Fucking. God.”\n\nMy head is throbbing. I type the word: ‘Parkham’ into the search field of the email client. The computer has a brief think and then dozens and dozens and dozens of search results appear. All of them are Uber receipts. I open a couple at random. This one is dated 02 February 2018. At 10:40pm an Uber picked up my wife from Parkham Street and brought her home to Islington. Another is dated 15 June 2017. On that occasion an Uber picked up my wife from her offices in South London at 6:22pm and took her to Parkham Street. There are probably 50 or 60 similar receipts that go back for years. *Jesus. Fucking. Christ.*\n\nI feel sick. I feel like shouting and crying at the same time. I clench my fists and my fingernails tear into the palms of my hands. I shake uncontrollably, as if I’m holding a live electrical cable. My teeth begin to chatter. I have a sudden urge to defecate. There are goosebumps on my arms. The hairs are standing on end. I try to breathe. To force oxygen into my lungs. Then my body slumps back into the sofa like a deflated balloon. For several long moments there is complete silence. I close my eyes. My brain begins to atrophy. I am no longer able to think. To function. \n\nI have no idea how long I remain in this position. Time really does stand still. My mind has stopped working. Except for the spinning beachball of death my system has crashed. My screen has gone blank. I am completely immobile. No part of me moves. And then, imperceptibly slowly, my senses begin to reboot.\n\nI phone my wife. I am put straight through to voicemail. At first I am calm. “Hello,” I say. “I think we’d better call off our date tonight.”\n\nThen there is an explosion of sound. I find myself standing in the kitchen literally screaming into the phone. “Get yourself fucking back here now!!!” The French doors are open and I can hear my voice echo through the garden. In the distance somebody slams a window shut. \n\nI hang up and call again. Still voicemail. “Come home now!” I yell.\n\nThen I have a brainwave. I return to my wife’s computer and open her Contacts app. Once again I search for the word ‘Parkham’. There is one result. Whoever this person is has no surname. He is simply listed as ‘Rohit’. What kind of a name is that? Could this person possibly be Indian? Whoever he is, he appears to reside at 33 Parkham Street, London SW9. And there is a telephone number. I call it.\n\n“Hello,” says a male voice. I cannot place the accent. It’s definitely not English but it does not sound Indian to me. \n\n“Can I speak to Rohit?” I say.\n\nThe phone instantly goes dead.\n\nI call back and leave a message on this person’s voicemail: “I know everything. Call me back you fucking coward!” My voice is trembling. It doesn’t sound like me at all.\n\nI phone my wife for a third time and once more I’m put straight through to voicemail. I hang up.\n\nThen a text appears from her:\n\n**Her:** I'm coming home now. 45 minutes maximum.\n\n**Me:** Have a good chat with lover boy on the way back because he’s a fucking dead man.\n\n**Her:** Please stop and calm down. I’ll be home soon. This is all my fault.\n\n**Me:** I'm really looking forward to hearing more lies from you.\n\n**Her:** I’ll tell the truth. I promise.\n\n**Me:** I'm building up a picture of your serial cheating. You fucking liar. \n\n**Her:** I lied because I wanted to save our relationship. Now that’s gone I can tell you everything. I even booked therapy to help me through this.\n\n**Me:** Can’t you see your insane logic? You actually think you’re a victim in all of this!\n\n**Her:** No it’s all my fault and you are the victim. Please don’t do anything reckless before I get home.\n\n**Me:** Your family and our daughter and everybody need to know what an evil fucking bitch you are.\n\nI call Rohit again. Once more I’m put through to voicemail. “What’s the matter? Too scared to talk?!” I yell. “You fucking coward!”\n\nAnother text:\n\n**Her:** I've told him not to answer. I need to talk to you.\n\n**Me:** He’s a dead man.\n\n**Her:** I did it to try and hold the family together not to cause you pain. I don’t know what else I could have done without losing you and everything.\n\n**Me:** Your way of holding the family together is to go around fucking people behind my back?\n\n**Her:** I’m really sorry.\n\n**Me:** Sorry?! I’m sure you are. How far away are you now?\n\n**Her:** Camden Town.\n\n**Me:** Are you on the phone to him? Concocting more lies? You won’t believe how much I’m going to hurt you.\n\n**Her:** Don’t threaten me.\n\n**Me:** Has he got a big dick?\n\n**Her:** Why would you say something like that?\n\n**Me:** Do you take it up the arse for him?!\n\n**Her:** I’m so sorry. It’s all over now.\n\n**Me:** He is a disgusting coward. You both are. I want you to pick up some things and move out right now.\n\n**Her:** Once you lie it’s difficult to stop.\n\n**Me:** Where are you now?\n\n**Her:** I’m walking up the hill.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI march out of the house to meet her. I don’t even bother to put on shoes. My bare feet sting on the hot pavement. Stones dig into my heels and the balls of my feet. But I feel nothing. In a month or so I will develop a verruca, presumably as a result of walking outside without shoes. I spot her in the distance. She’s talking on the phone. She stops speaking when she sees me and puts the phone in the pocket of her jeans.\n\nWe walk up the hill side by side without looking at each other. Despite everything I’m still prepared to throw her a lifeline. “It’s me or him!” I snarl. “I’m telling you right now. Me or him!”\n\nShe leads the way into the flat. As I enter behind her I slam the front door so hard that it threatens to come off its hinges. She visibly flinches which makes me feel guilty and a little sorry for her. \n\nI don’t know what happens next. Words flood from my lips in a shapeless torrent. I have no idea what I’m saying. The words have no meaning. They make no sense. They have no order. They are just sounds. My wife tries to cut across them but I won’t let her. \n\nI motion towards the bedroom. We enter and I pull out a suitcase. I open the wardrobe and point at her clothing. She ignores what I am doing and perches on the bed. She looks towards the floor, her eyes avoiding mine. “I have something to tell you,” she says. She is shaking. She is now sitting in exactly the same spot in which she made her No Power speech. 41 days ago. \n\nI stop talking and listen.\n\n“I have feelings for him,” she says.\n\n“Feelings? What do you mean ‘feelings’!? Are you telling me you fucking love him!? You’re in love with him?! You’re in love with who?!”\n\nMy wife says nothing. She continues to stare at the carpet.\n\n“You fucking love him!” I repeat, my voice raising in pitch. I stomp off into the living room. “Let’s see what your parents think about this!!”\n\nI pick up my phone and fumble to find her mother’s number. “Please don’t tell my parents!” my wife pleads. She has followed me into the living room.\n\nI find the number and dial.\n\n“Please don’t tell my parents!” my wife looks horrified.\n\nHer mother answers the phone. “Hi there!” I say jauntily. “How are you?”\n\n“I’m good thanks,” says her mother. “How are you?”\n\nMy wife stands inches away from me. *Please don’t tell my parents!* She frantically mouths the words at me. Hands pressed tightly together, almost in prayer.\n\n“I’ve been better to be honest. Just thought I’d let you know that your daughter has been sleeping with other men for years and years. Speak to you later. Bye.” I hang up.\n\nMy wife begins to sob. Her lips quiver. Then her phone rings. It’s her mother. She goes downstairs to the bedroom, leaving me alone. I’m in complete meltdown. I don’t know who I am or what I’m doing. I start to cry. A guttural growl comes from the back of my throat. \n\nI go out into the garden and smoke a cigarette. I’m shaking so much I can barely light it. When it’s finished I immediately smoke another. As I’m doing this my wife comes into the garden.\n\n“I’ve spoken to dad,” she says. “He’s told me not to leave the flat. He says it’s best that I stay here.”\n\n“You’re fucking leaving!” I insist. “Go and stay with lover boy.”\n\n“He’s worried you won’t let me back in if I leave.”\n\n“Well he's right to be worried. You’re leaving. Get the fuck out of here now!”\n\nMy wife moves back indoors. I can hear her sobbing. I throw my cigarette into the garden and follow her. I watch as she crams clothing and make-up into the suitcase. \n\n“How could you do this to us?” I say. I have stopped shouting now. My voice has become a whimper. “After everything that we’ve been through.”\n\n“I’m so sorry.”\n\n“And all this time you’ve been telling me how crazy I’m behaving. To stop overreacting. How could you do this?’\n\n“I’m sorry. It was bigger than me?”\n\n“Bigger than you? What the fuck are you talking about?”\n\nIt takes about 10 minutes for my wife to fill the suitcase. She hauls it out of the bedroom and heads for the front door. “I’m only moving out for a couple of nights,” she says. “I’ll stay at my brother’s until you’ve calmed down.”\n\nI watch as she opens the front door and leaves. At once the flat is overwhelmed by silence.",

        "text": "So last year the ex neglectful/covert narcissist somehow made Christmas all about me having to make sure he was OK. \n\nMy mum describes him as \"the patient\". I went out of my way for him and really gave him a lovely Christmas last year because he always made out that he hated Christmas and would rather be alone.\n\nYet he did want to come to dinner with me and my family and we had a lovely Christmas but there was something off, it was always about making sure he was OK, alllll the time. If you were having a good time then suddenly he was depressed or anxious, like he really seemed to play on mental health and you couldn't quite put your finger on why some holidays were crap... but when I think about it now its because even when doing the nicest thoughtful things for him, he was still \"the patient\" all my energy went out of me and onto pleasing him and making sure he was having a good time.\n\nThis year it feels so different, I feel closer to my friends and family. I feel connected again and all about loving me, my family and friends, all the energy is going onto us and our happiness rather than trying to care for someone who doesn't seem to ever get enough from me.\n\nI'm no contact with him ,my life has got drastically better since he discarded me (even though it hurt terribly). I can see how much I've grown and how different this Christmas Is in a good way.\n\nBut tonight I did something I know I shouldn't but I'm kind of glad I did, I checked his social media and while I'm having a  nice relaxed night with family and friends, guess what he's doing ?  He is online arguing with strangers on the Internet about absolute petty crap.\n\nI'm not gloating, but it's sort of proven to me that he is just still this same miserable \"woe is me\" person who takes his pain out on everyone else.\nI offered to stand by this man through thick and thin, I got him counselling and everything but nope he just wanted to continue his toxic cycle.\n\nI hope this helps if you feel like you'll never heal- you will! \n\nAlso they won't change , he is proof! But we can change for the better and things get better!\n\nMerry Christmas",

I suspect just knowing the email was opened is enough supply for some people.

        "text": "The narcissist does not know right from wrong, or better yet, doesn’t acknowledge it as a part of their own moral compass. The only thing close to morality is what they can and cannot get away with. When I confronted the narcissist in my life, the only thing she said that was even close to an apology was, “no one told me I was wrong.” Can you imagine a 33 year old saying this unironically? Can you imagine an adult thinking a harmful behavior is wrong only if someone tells you it’s wrong? I can’t, and most of us can’t, because we are mature. We have a conscience and they do not.\n\n Do you notice that certain types of narcissists always form friendships with people who seem weak or insecure? That was what the narcissist in my life did. She acted like a savior to those people because she knew those people would accept her as such. In return for her “kindness” they never questioned her or confronted her when she said something wrong. She fed on their insecurities and they fed on her attention. This works for some people. They will thrive in this organism they create. But because they are all so insecure and exist in this world, they will always be at odds against the world. They are never happy, and they show this by speaking negatively about others who are a threat to them simply by existing. A confident, independent person will somehow become a target if they notice something about them that they can feed on. This is how I became their prey. \n\nI did not buy into this image the narcissist created for herself. I did not find her funny or interesting, but instead of leaving me alone, she clung to me as if to force me to give her the attention she believed she deserved. When it didn’t work, she resorted to attempts at making me feel small. But it didn’t work. She will always and forever be less than to me. All the ways in which she craves attention and envies others make her a small shell of a person. And she did not break me. She lost the game.",

        "text": "Hello,\n\nI would appreciate some advice from you.\n\nBackstory:\nAbout a year ago I met a woman who shortly after 2 or 3 dates revealed that she had a narcissistic ex and cried about it (she had broken up 3 months ago when we met first time and her old relationship went on for 5 years). I then told her that it was best for her to process this so that she would have clarity about her feelings. We still met regularly and at one point she said she thought I didn't like her and cried. Then it was a back and forth and at some point she said that she is not sure if I am emotionally on the same level with her and then it was over between us. I'm telling you this so that have enough background information about our relationship. I don't know how necessary that is and I'm not looking for a relationship advice.\n\nI see her regularly at work and when we see each other we still talk sometimes about our lifes etc. A few days ago she said she's feeling bad about life and also about her nex. She almost cried when she talked. I told her we can talk about it if she wants and she said yes and said she will get back to me. A few weeks ago she told she's over him but I really feel like she isn't. I've read books and watched videos about narcissistic relationships when we were dating but I think this is a special case.\n\nThe point is, I also really like her as an person and I would like to support her. I wonder how I should proceed now. Should I wait her to get back to me or should I call her and ask her how she feels? I don't wanna put pressure on her but at the same time I don't wanna leave her alone with her problems. I really feel sorry for her because she is actually such a strong and successful woman.",

        "text": "I have been a person who keeps a journal for many years. I rarely go backwards and read them, but they help me sort my feelings sometimes when I’m writing.\n\nIn early 2021, I ended a relationship with a person I believe in a narcissist (but at the least, very toxic for me). After two years of trying, I couldn’t participate anymore. I remember last year, shortly after ending that relationship, I read all of my journal entries I wrote during that time. While reviewing, I could see how toxic I had been in those entries, and felt proud of myself that I could take accountability for my wrong doing.\n\nWell, I am starting EMDR and my first homework was to write down the significant bad things that have happened to me in life. To be thorough, I went back to my journals and reviewed. A year and some months after the initial review, I was shocked by my findings.\n\nIn those entries, I am *hurting*. It hurt me to read them. I can see myself unraveling for another person, desperately clinging onto the idea that I was broken, wrong, and to blame for our problems. I was not the person that needed to take accountability for bad behavior - I was a full victim. Some of the quotes I recorded were cruel. I was begging for forgiveness for asking for a minimal level of respect. I was a beaten dog. I am shocked that I reviewed those entries and thought I needed to be held accountable for bad behavior. My bad behavior was a cry for help, at worst. \n\nI will always be grateful to myself that I kept up my journals through it all. They are a solid reminder, from my perspective, what I endured.",

        "text": "It’s been a year since I was the victim of a smear campaign. To put a long story short he had feelings for me, and I told him I needed to distance myself if he didn’t work on some serious issues he had. Such as acting predatory to women, severe drug abuse issues, out of control anger management problems, etc. \n\nSo he basically projected everything onto me and went around trying to ruin my reputation. And there were a handful of people who were stupid enough to believe it, two of them were people I considered close friends at the time. \n\nWell one of them lives with him, and has nowhere else to go. And he seems to be getting abused a-lot. But we tried to encourage him to leave and he was delusional enough to think the narc and his temporary group of druggies were his friends. Now he seems to have nobody, and looks disheveled and miserable every time I see him. \n\nThe other was sexually assaulted by him for a second time, and lost a ton of friends for sticking by him for as long as she did. Now she’s traumatized and is suffering more mentally than before. \n\nOverall it took less than a year for everyone who dropped me to suffer the consequences. At first I was hurt, then appalled, then happy they were suffering, to just sad. I don’t understand why people can ignore the red flags and justify carrying out the narc’s abuse.",

        "text": "Thanks to the advice I've read in this group, I'm starting therapy in January. I was discarded in early October and it came as quite a shock because I thought we were both in love and she was just months away from moving to the new city we'd chosen to live in. (I moved, then she broke it off a few days later). There could be a number of benign explanations for her unexplained decision, but the more I've learned about NPD, the more convinced I've become that she's a narcissist.  \n\nIn preparation for therapy, I started jotting down a list of red flags I should have seen. (I've also been doing a self inventory as well). We're both older - me 60, she's 55. Early on in our relationship on our first trip together, she seemed so perfect! I couldn't help but to ask her why she never settled down with anyone. She mentioned her busy career and the need to take care of her aging parents in the mid-2000s.  That seemed plausible enough. But then she lit up and said I did have a serious boyfriend the two years I was in grad school!\" Nothing wrong with that.\n\nI also knew that 18 months prior to when we started dating she'd been in a relationship that included a live in boyfriend for around 6 months and six months long distance prior to that. So not very long in the greater scheme of things.  Hey we all have pasts. No worries there.  As time went on I heard things about her ex.  I knew his name, the kind of work he did, the general area where he lived. Most significantly, she had reconnected with her old flame from grad school.  Still didn't bother me, I was in love. One thing struck me as odd though, when I asked why she didn't break it off the first time she caught him cheating (with one of her friends!) she replied: \"I figured as long as he was playing some useful role in my life, I'd keep him around.\"  They last 4 months longer, then he got caught again and he was thrown out. (So her story goes.)\n\nAs I've been compiling my list of her behaviors, I came back to this discussion about her ex.  So out of morbid curiosity I looked him up for the very first time.  What I discovered was that he was a freshman  while she was in grad school. He was \\~18 and she was 32!  Heck when I was 18 I'm sure I would have loved to be banging a hot 32 y/o woman! So I don't judge him.  I do judge her, though. He wasn't even old enough to go to bars and I'm sure she would never have brought him to grad school parties. Imagine the control she had over the kid.\n\nOne final oddity.  I had been separated for three years prior to us starting to date.  As we became more serious, it was finally time to formalize my divorce. To keep things amicable with my now ex-wife, I asked my  GF not to tag me in the pictures she was posting of us on our adventures. This frustrated her no end!  She appears to have moved on by the number of times she's tagged her new friend (victim).  But in all the years I've known her (and it goes back a long way) she never once tagged the grad school boyfriend or his 2019 reincarnation.",

I am not bothered so much anymore with what he is up to and I guess I hope he finds some happiness in it. But still it hurts sometimes, maybe it's the holidays and still being alone I just try not to think about the good times and how it all started, and how he is probably now just copying similar tricks for the next woman, and the next, and the next... what felt so real to me, was just a total interexchangeable fake to him.",

Though we don’t directly work side by side everyday, we do cross paths on occasion. \n\nThe most recent one being our Christmas party. She seemed to constantly gravitate to where I was early in the night, trying to make eye contact and smiling… I couldn’t be fake with her. In fact, it infuriates me more when she does this.\n\nWhen I’m at work and in the same area as her, I go quiet. I don’t want her knowing any of my information… but she will talk about her entire life in front of me to others coworkers. A mutual friend constantly triangulates us knowing we are often compared which hurts so much to the point I’ve threatened to cut him off to protect myself. \n\nI’m not sure if this is coincidental or if she’s doing this on purpose… I just don’t understand how someone who can cut me off how she did can openly talk about herself in front of me like I care when I don’t give her any fuel. If I cut someone from my life, it’s for a good reason and I don’t want them knowing anything about me anymore. \n\nWhat do I need to work on in my life to fix this issue? Why am I channeling all of my pent up teenage angst of being rejected by mean girls all my life into this one girl?",

        "text": "Hey, everyone. \n\nMy initial discard was late January 2021. \n\nTo keep it short, I dated my nex Dec 2018 to June 2020. It wasn’t until after I went on her Reddit profile and found out she was posting naked pictures constantly and flirting/sexting guys only from march to June (during this time period we had a second abortion in a 7month period). \n\nOnce I caught her cheating, she immediately said we couldn’t date anymore. She said she was an evil abusive person that hides it so well that she was just finding it out. I didn’t know shit about about abuse so I said I’ll be there if she needed the help.\n\nFrom June 2020-January 2021, we were not officially dating but I told her she needed to give me an answer on leaving me or staying and getting help. I constantly told her to move on if she wanted and she would always get mad. I was so confused she didn’t want to date me but then got mad when I said she could sleep with others.\n\nI kept telling her once every week or two that she needs to make her decision. Eventually she told me that we need to stop talking because she feels like she’s leading me on. She refused to answer the simple question: Are you breaking up with me? \n\nShe yelled and shouted that she wasn’t leaving me for someone else. Even though I was practically begging her to just end things. \n\nAnyway I was glad for her to just be gone. \n\n2 weeks later (Feb 2021), I find out she’s with another guy at a party and her new supply even introduced to her to one of my friends and bragged about how he’s been hitting that one and off. My friend noted that she was wicked nervous the whole time\n\nI called her out. She blocked me and said she had no clue why I’m even hitting her up and if I had any respect for her I would never talk to her again. \n\nTwo weeks later (March 2021), I remove the person I suspect to be the new supply from my Snapchat. Within 5 minutes, she tried to add me back. I blocked her. Then my friend got a call from a person that knows the new supply saying that he’s freaking out about me and calling me a bitch. Meanwhile my Nex is blowing up my phone. I ignored her successfully by blocking her everywhere. \n\nThe next day, I wake up to an EMAIL ON MY SCHOOL ACCOUNT from her asking why I messaged her new supply. Also, my friend calls me to let me know that the new supply is now saying he’s going to come stab me and my friends and I’m a bitch etc.\n\nI finally snapped. I asked him wtf his problem was and he denied ever saying anything then blocked me. \n\nThis was all March 2021. He ended up dumping her in April 2021. She started Hoovering me again but I cut her off in June 2021 because she tried triangulating me with ANOTHER guy. \n\nShe dated this other guy from June - September 2021 then cheating on him then left him for the FIRST guy she “left me” for and now they’ve been together since. \n\nNow this stupid little prick is dating my Nex and thinks he’s the MAN because he got her to “leave” me and cheat on another guy. I wish she dated ANYONE else. I would never ever be worried about a guy like her new supply but she made it personal by going out her way to start a problem between us. I hope she cheats on him and he finds up in a fucked up way. \n\nTL;DR: My nex refused to break up with me despite me wanting to, left me, told me to never talk to her, then had some kid I never talked to ready to kill me. ALL INSTEAD OF JUST SAYING SHE WANTS ME TO GO. LIKE HOW YOU GOING TO REFUSE TO LET ME GO THEN RUN TO ANOTHER PERSON AND SAY THE OPPOSITE. How can you tell me to never hit me up again then within weeks you’re in my FUCKING SCHOOL EMAIL just to start a problem between me and this kid. \n\nAnyway, how do you move on from the Nex when you hate the new supply and want them both to fucking suffer. How do you deal with the anger afterwards?",

I was heavily traumatized.\n\nI started writing a book about what happened to me a long time ago and finally finished it this week.\n\nI shall start looking for publishers in the new year.\n\nIn the meantime, I might post an occasional excerpt from the book. This is something I wrote about the nature of betrayal and what it can do to person. Perhaps it might resonate:\n\n\"Perhaps my paranoia has reached new heights or plumbed new depths. Perhaps I’m looking for things that are simply not there. The evidence before me is no more than circumstantial. I understand that. Nevertheless, what I am uncovering has to be more than simple coincidence. It just has to be.\n\nAnd this type of reaction, I will learn, is in the very nature of betrayal. This is what betrayal can do to a person. Because after you discover that the one you trusted more than any other in the world is capable of such profound deception it is inevitable that you will seek out further examples of equivalent duplicity. And in doing so every memory that you share or have created with this person is suddenly open to reinterpretation. Every experience that you enjoyed or endured with this individual can never again be completely trusted. Meaningless incidents from your past will now be scrutinised with different eyes and from a different perspective. Your entire personal history will be cast into doubt. Every moment that you spent with this person has potential for untruth. Events which you thought were essential or inessential components of your personal evolution can no longer be taken as written. And the more that you dig the more you unearth. And the more you unearth the less steady becomes the ground on which you tread. And eventually that ground will give way and the foundations of your existence will crumble to nothing. And the hole in your life that remains is what it means to be betrayed.\"",

He’s been having a hard time lately with his life and I honestly did everything to try and ride through this period with him and he absolutely and wholeheartedly fucked me up- I feel physical pain like never before.\n\nI want him to regret the fire he set to our lives.. the complete chaos he caused right before Christmas … tell me they regret it and tell me they come begging for you back so my heart can feel calm … I feel like my mind and soul is on fire\n\nI want to live without his memories.

        "text": "I’ve essentially been low to NC with my sister for years. She has never been particularly hateful to me but because my mom is the target of her harassment. My mom has been her stepmother for 35+ years. And I’ve seen my mom try everything possible to be amicable but you know how it can be with people who have narcissistic tendencies. This last year has been especially bad to the point my father who has never really seen or acknowledged how toxic my sister is has finally noticed. \n\nThis change in realization came after my sister did something specifically designed to be hurtful that was so blatant and obvious even my father couldn’t deny it. My brother and I finally convinced my mom to grey rock her and she ramped up her antics to get a reaction. \n\nEvery year I begrudgingly buy her a Christmas gift. Because I don’t want to be rude or mean. It doesn’t feel right to buy a gift for every one in the family except for my sister. \n\nBut this year I’m feeling differently because my sister ruined thanksgiving to spite my mother. But what she hasn’t seemed to understand is that thanksgiving is _my_ favorite holiday. Everyone knows thanksgiving is my favorite holiday. I do all the cooking, I host, I doctorate my house. It is the highlight of my year and my sister ruined it to be hurtful to my mother. \n\nThis has made being generous at Christmas very hard. I picked up a flannel shirt today at the store for her and I can’t bring myself to put anymore effort into her gift. Should I just throw in a gift card and call it a day to keep the peace. Or should I just give her the shirt I bought? My goal is to avoid drama. \n\nMy gifts for the rest of the family are pretty lavish. But the rest of my family doesn’t treat my mom like crap or ruin holidays out of spite.",

        "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI grew up with 3 narcissists. My father was a malignant narcissist and my mother was a covert narcissists. I say \"was\", but she is well and alive, just not in my life anymore.\n\nMy brother has always been the main source of pain because he just loved hurting me emotionally mentally . So I cut him off as well.\n\nGrowing up , I always wanted to do something creative. But my narc mom would lie to me saying I can do it as long as I complete my next grade and it kept going on. She would lie and tell me in middle school, I can focus on music once I reach high school, and once I reached high school she would lie and tell me I can do it once I reach college and on and on and on.\n\nI even went as far as getting a stupid degree in engineering ( oh how I loathe that degree) , but couldn't hold on to a JOB anywhere because I hated it so much. Even after I was fired from my first engineering job and started doing odd jobs trying to figure myself out, my narc mom and narc bro would try to convince and almost force me to go back to the \"tech field\"! It's almost like they HATED my creativity.\n\nAnyways, fast forward to 2021, I started a creative business and now I have under a dozen clients, but for some reason I never felt fully confident, so I have my full time \"tech job\" on the side as well and lately I made a mistake in that I send out a document to the wrong person and it caused a bit of an issue . It was minor , but caused me enough stress for me to think about this deeply .\n\nDo you think I am making these dumb mistakes because of how low-confidence I have in myself because \"My own family\" didn't believe in my abilities? Since they treated me as if I am \"no good\" creatively, do you think this could also be the reason why I haven't thrived in my creative agency business either??\n\nwow. I am having all kind of revelations today! It started off a bit sad because of the file mishap, but now that I trace it back all the way to my childhood I can see how this could all be co-related. \n\nCan anyone else relate to this or see how this could be the reason why I haven't been able to reach where I wanted to reach? Because they always tried to convince me subconsciously that I am not good at this?",

My mother saw it and thought I was going to hurt myself so she screamed and grabbed it from me in a really awkward way.  This is the day I pulled a knife on her. To this day, 29 years later, she still believes I pulled a knife on her. She made an emergency appointment with my psychiatrist because again, I'm a sociopath. She went into his office without me and I couldn't have known she was lying about the knife. \n\nAt the ripe old age of 15 I couldn't have understood narcissism or projection. I didn't know there was a name for all of this until I was 33. These days it's a bad joke with friends and family. Duck is evil and has no empathy. A friend of mine tells a story about me finding a kitten in the grocery store parking lot like I'm doing horrible things to it. I took him home, gave him a bath, combed the dead fleas out of his fur, and fed him. The most horrible and evil thing I did to this poor kitten was let him sleep on my pillow. Fifteen years later and my ex husband still has the kitten. There's also the joke that I'm a cereal killer. I never let anyone get close to my Fruity Pebbles. \n\nWe joke about it now but it wasn't funny when my narc mother was making my life hell either because she hated me or because she's delusional. I'm truly sorry for anyone still stuck dealing with narcissistic abuse.",

        "text": "Something I realized after I left my narcissistic ex was that it is impossible to have a real adult conversation about boundaries or expectations. After I left him he quickly started dating a new girl he found on Tinder but he kept saying that he wanted to restore our relationship and that he missed me and loved me. Stupidly I fell for that. I wasn't sure if he was a narcissist or not, so I tried to work things out with him. I would ask him to have a conversation about boundaries but each time I would try to have the conversation he would evade it. He crossed my boundaries so many times that I realized that if I didn't set them I wouldn't be able to be back with him. I had to make it clear that I didn't want him controlling and micromanaging all aspects of my life and making me feel guilty and bad for not complying. I also didn't want him accusing me of cheating or other things without having any proofs. \n\nSo I tried. I would call him, and he would be (or pretend to be) drunk, so he would tell me he can't talk about it now because he's too drunk and this is a serious conversation. However, it seemed there was never time for him to have this serious conversation that would actually restore our relationship (in my head). Instead, he would send me \"I miss you texts\" or \"I wish I had you in my arms\" texts while dating the new girl. I was trying so hard to actually have a real conversation about the relationship, but he didn't want it. I wanted to try the \"expectations\" conversation and I told him what he expected in a relationship. He said that he expected his partner to support his business dreams because he didn't feel that much support with me. I literally help him write his TEFL course assignments, but I didn't know how to support his absolutely delusional business ventures such as creating a video game. I would never discourage him, however he found ways to make me feel bad for wanting to do my master's degree or continue studying a PhD. I realized I'll never have a real conversation about relationship boundaries and expectations with him. \n\nAt some point, I just told him I couldn't keep in contact with him while he was dating this new girl and he became extremely mad at me. He rubbed her in my face saying how better she was and how many things she did for him that I didn't do. \n\nIn hindsight, I think he didn't want to have a conversation about boundaries because that would put us both on the same level and it would take away the power from him. He said he wanted to restore our relationship to either keep me there hanging while he was dating the new girl until she was fully secured or to see if I was stupid enough to let him back in without setting any boundary. He would continuously change goal posts and having a real conversation in which we set boundaries would not allow him to change goal posts. Let's say, he would tell me to give up social media and if I did he would find another reason to control. He would then go to tell me to erase old pictures. If I did, he would go on to tell me to change my outfits. If I did he would tell me to not go to the gym. \n\nHe wanted me to respect him. He was obsessed over the fact that I wasn't respecting him enough. I agreed and said we both deserved respect. He agreed. Then, I remember telling him to specify what respect was, because \"micromanaging clothes, social media, whereabouts, friends, controlling and accusing your partner continuously weren't signs of respect either\". He started saying that we were not going to analyze what respect was because that would be a long useless conversation and that it was already understandable what respect was. \n\nSo I really don't think it's about accomodating to them or compromising. I think the whole thing they want is just having the upper hand and keep you on unstable grounds. It's not even about finding a \"compatible partner\" for them. They change you because that pleases them. They like seeing you submitting. I remember that even after submitting, he would complain I submitted because he insisted. Apparently I didn't submit due to my own willingness to please him. I remember once I agreed with something he asked me to do, he even uttered \"good girl\". I didn't know if that was on purpose to set me off, or if he was just mentally jerking off at the fact he made me submit to a new demand. But I remember hating him after he said that. \n\nThis same person I'm talking about had once an argument with one of his friends on one of his streams. They were arguing about a president. My ex was in favour of this president and his friend was against. And I remember my ex telling him to not talk like that about said president, not during his stream. Finally, his friend backed down and said \"okay, okay\". At that moment, my ex smiled, it was a miserable grin, kind of feeling good about the fact his friend submitted to him. \n\nAny thoughts on this?",

She kept asking and I teased saying no and she said “fine I’ll message other boys then”. She showed me the messages the next time we met and was saying the guy is a weirdo and says she gaslights him and messes around with him, but on our 5th date she asked me not to message other girls and she would reciprocate but clearly she didn’t.\n- Said she likes to drive because “she likes being in control” said in a sarcastic way\n- She would start to prioritise meeting her friends and I felt as though I became less of a priority when meeting\n- She started to constantly be on her phone rather than being present with me when we would go out to eat etc \n- When I would face time she was on her phone to her friend / wasn’t really engaged \n- She stopped initiating plans and it was all on me\n- She’d talk about boys she’s dated or her ex sometimes (nothing deep just about random stories if he was in there) and if I talked about girls or my ex she’d get weirded out\n- She said I was prettier than her but she’s cooler\n- Asked me about my “body count” and seemed off when she found out I’ve slept with more people\n- Has said “cheating is exciting isn’t it” when we were watching TV and I mentioned one of the people on the show was caught in a scandal &amp; has mentioned how one of her clients (she’s a hairdresser) talks about how their work mates cheat on their partners and said she never would\n- Said she made her bf cry and she has the ability to make boys cry\n- Met her best friend off bumble and she made a random new friend who she was going on holiday with and said she messaged her on insta and they became friends, seemed odd\n- Said i fancy her friend \n- Said she met lots of boys parents when dating but said it in a sarcastic way\n- Said my work schedule “is not for her” and sometimes down talked me in general, like little jabs but could it just be humour\n\nFor context I’m 23M and I run my own business / I’m a content creator on instagram with a large following but I see it purely as a job &amp; she (24F) was a hairdresser working for a salon - we are both quite sarcastic / jokey people but certain things made me feel weird as mentioned above \n\nI sent her a message saying my concerns and said I don’t think it’ll work out and she said she was heartbroken / thought what we had was special so we agreed to work through things. We met up like 4 more times but the sex felt off and she kept giving me little down talks / digs. \n\nShe texted saying she doesn’t think she’s ready for anything serious and doesn’t want to lead me on. We had a call and she spoke to work mates / my message saying what I wasn’t happy about made her realise. I said that’s all good and she asked if we could be friends. I told her politely I can’t as I’ve got romantic feelings for her and I’ve got a lot of friends already and I don’t see her that way. She said “you’re going go unfollow me / stop texting me aren’t you” and I said yes I am as I have feelings for her and can’t continue anything. She said “fine be like then” and I wished her the best and she returned the wishes then hung up instantly. She removed me as follower but didn’t block me. I said it may have been lust but she said no and said I don’t have to speak for her.\n\nI texted her to see if she was okay and she said we can meet face to face. We did this monday gone and when trying to bring up the situations she spun it saying “no that didn’t happen” and when I said let’s speak about things she said “what’s there to talk about”. She seemed a little angry, annoyed and defensive about it all. She said everything was intense these past 2 months.\n\nIf anyone can help me gain clarity that’ll be great haha, was she a narcissist or just insecure or is it me?",

This holiday season my sister reached out and told me that her health is bad but she wasn't ready to talk about it.

I started to get worried that health being bad might have been worse than I thought. I got scared and thought about calling the police to check for a very sick or dead body (catastrophizing maybe I know...) but I tried reaching out one more time.\nShe said she was well but I was still worried since I knew nothing. I pushed for more info or some clarity about the plan moving forward so I don't try to freak out and call the police again. \nBut then she asked me basically not to contact her at all while she takes some space.\nNow she's not posting anything and might have even deleted social media or blocked me. \nI feel awful because this kind of sudden disappearance is similar to what my sister and I both did to our nparents (but with valid reasons because they were dangerous to be in relationship with).\nIt makes me feel like maybe I'm dangerous and abusive and she has to get away from me.

        "text": "Man oh man, I had a wildly infuriating dream last night. After waking up though, I was so fucking relieved it was just a dream! I also want to add a trigger for implied sexual assault, but it's not a major part of the dream.\n\nThe dream was in a house, where I was living with my Emom and my GC/N Bro came back from college. The context was I was NC with him, but my mom is trying to get me to get along with him. \n\nI'm angry as is that he exists in the house. And now she's trying to mediate? So she makes me go to his room and idk, hangout with him? And she leaves us in his room and goes somewhere. I'm just trying to keep to myself and I'm on the bed and he's suddenly attempting to inappropriately touch me??? And I was just blazing mad. So I leave the room and go to my room. I lock my door and call my bf (now husband, but probably bf in dream, you know dream logic is weird) so I can tell him what's happening. As I am on the phone my brother is trying to listen to the conversation through my door!! I can see him through the crack of the door! Ugghhh!!! SO ANNOYING. Like I'm getting so upset that I am practically forgetting the most aggregious crime so far (Touching me!!) I'm so blinded by rage I can't even  remember the worst part at every moment. I want to *remember* it long enough so I can tell my mom about it.\n\nThen my mom barges in and I'm like wait...how did you open the door? I locked it? (Anger level increases) And then my mom walks over to my journal and begins to read it right in front of me??? (Anger level is hitting critical levels) I snapped and said to stop that listen to me because I need to tell her something, but now she's being snappy with me.\n\nSo I say, \"Okay mom, I'm going to hold your hand and we are going to take a few breaths and after that I need you to listen to what I am going to say\" because I **really** wanted my mom to know what my brother did (inappropriate touching) and further explaining why I refuse to talk to him.\n\nThen, as we take the first breath...my brother calmly walks into the room and sits on a chair. And I just absolutely lose it. There is no calming me now. I am yelling at him to get out of my room and he's all like, \"What? I'm just sitting here?\" And I'm so beyond infuriated that I finally woke up and physically jolted up breathing heavy from the anger.\n\nMy husband was still awake and just sees me jolt up from stillness to exasperation. I begin to laugh from the absolute relief that it was all just a dream.\n\nIt felt so real and intense I didn't go back to sleep right away. I actually got up out of bed to journal about it so I could get the energy out, it was just so fucking wild! \n\nI do love how even in my dream, I was trying to draw up on all my knowledge about trying to keep calm by doing the breathing exercise with my mom. I've been practicing guided meditation for a little over a year now, and it was kind of cool (in-hindsight) how it's integrated enough into my being that I even dreamt to bring that wisdom into the moment.\n\nThis dream was so hilarious after waking up, but definitely not fun in the moment. I just found it really interesting too because when I think about it, it's not even been 3 years since I went NC with Nbro. So I figure my mind/body is just processing every still and kind of filtering out all the bad juju. I do get these types of dreams every so often, but this last one was probably the only one that got me to laugh after waking up.\n\nAnways, feel free to share your crazy dreams!",

At least I feel in my core now that it's not him I miss, it's just the pain of being alone again now and craving a partner, realising I have craved that for a long time, and mourning the fact that once again instead of finding love I found a lot of hurt. \n\nI take good care of myself, and there are more and more moments that I kind of forget about him but still he crosses my mind every day. I cry far less but still sometimes I cry and in my very weak moments I still wish that everything would just at least be ok between us, which I know they won't. I was going to go to an event and heard he is also going so I made the conscious choice not to go. I don't want to ruin the progress I have made so far and the thought of seeing him again makes me shiver. At the same time, I sometimes still crave to be where he is and think the people that get to be there with him are so lucky. Such a strange damn irrational feeling and I hate it. \n\nI even dated twice, but none of it led to anything. Now I feel more ready for a date at least and I feel that I would be open to somebody new, whereas at first I was only thinking I don't want anybody else but him.",

        "text": "Is this true? And why do they need this level of insane control? \n\nSo, for some background info, I was in a long distance relationship with someone I absolutely think was a narcissist. The way his control over me started unfolding was very gradual. At the beginning, he started saying things like \"I don't really like you posting pictures on social media, it feels vain and you're probably seeking men's attention\". When he started doing this, I was already in love, he was so good, attentive and funny at the beginning, I completely fell for him. I accepted his demand. But it was never enough. In the name of \"I feel insecure about this\" or \"these are my standards, you take it or you leave it\" he started slowly eroding my identity. It started from social media. I made it private, stopped posting pics and erased old pics. \n\nThen, I stopped going to celebrations, and cut off any contact I could have with men. Then, he started getting mad at my clothes (I swear, I don't dress revealingly, but even a long covered orange summer dress was too striking for him and disrespectful to him). Then he wanted to ban me from going to the gym, while saying he could do it because he's a man. On top, he would tell me not to go to my work meetings if I could avoid them. Well, it became insane. If I didn't comply, I would be called selfish, unloving and uncooperative, he wouldn't see how much I already gave up on. And what I realized is that if I ever did something against his will (let's say, post an absolutely innocent picture), he would not feel at peace unless he made me erase it. I swear, just a selfie was enough. We would literally go hours arguing. He would need to constantly push his will on me. That's why I ended up leaving. \n\nThat wasn't the only narcissistic behaviour: he would constantly accuse me of trying to get even if I made him abide by the same rules he was putting on me, accuse me of cheating if I forgot to update him with pictures throughout the day, accuse me of trying to put him down when in reality I just made an innocent comment, accuse me of not caring enough about him... Like nothing I did was enough. He also used scripture and my faith, acting like a God in my life and using God's voice: \"God wanted you to work on this relationship and you failed\", \"God showed me in my dreams what we can do to work on this relationship \"... \n\nIt was hell. After we broke up, he said he didn't have control issues because I consented to these changes he was constantly asking me to make, so it wasn't control. However, if I didn't make those changes, he would threaten to leave me, start drama and chaos, and argue all the time. It was literally impossible to assert any boundary. Then he started saying he didn't have control issues with the new girl (one he found only two days after I left) because apparently there is love and respect between them, something I couldn't give him. \n\nI was loyal, committed, I was always there when he needed me, I always updated him with pictures to make him feel at peace, I literally gave up my identity for him. I never gave him reasons to distrust me. \n\nHowever, what I realized is that he didn't want me it he couldn't control me. He would even get mad if he couldn't elicit the reaction from me. Let's say if we were arguing and I was not getting crazy or crying he would say I'm a cold bi****. The moment I told him I wasn't going to give up on the gym and that if he wanted to compromise on the clothes I would wear I could do it. I also told him I could compromise and call him from the gym so he could feel at peace. Or even send him pics. No, nothing worked. He preferred to lose me, rather than accept something so small. And I think it's related to control. He said he wasn't prepared to give up control and that if I had been patient, once he would be in my country with me, he wouldn't be so controlling. \n\nWhy does it feel so insane? Why can't they be with you if you don't comply 100%? Then be blamed me for not being patient enough and losing the relationship for something so immature as the gym, and that God probably removed a woman like me from his life.",

        "text": " \n\nHey all! First, I’m a first time Reddit poster but I’ve found this group to be really insightful and it’s helped a lot. I’m hoping writing this down and your comments will help me sort things out. I’m a 60 year old man, amicably separated since 2019 and now divorced, and as of this summer, comfortably retired. (I only bring this up because many of you seem younger). She’s a 55 y/o woman, never married, with a 16 y/o adopted child, and a successful career. We moved in the same social circles in the early ‘90’s and even dated for a brief period of time. Before our child came along, she was even close friends with my now ex-wife. We’ve been FB friends since 2008 but live 400 miles apart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn Nov 2021, I saw her post something and I responded and it turned into 10 months of constant daily interaction… mostly mundane life/work things but a fair amount of flirting followed by long calls on the phone. In February 2022, she invited me to join her and her son for a week in a warm place. With much trepidation, I went and we had a magical (platonic) time. That kicked off a series of visits in March, April, May and June that were awesome and very romantic. Over 10 months, our long-distance relationship was 60% texts 30% calls and 10% visits. I tried to fill the gaps caused by distance by being as attentive and affectionate as I could (cards, flowers, gifts, spa days, meals delivered, etc.). But I was also disturbed by a pattern of very weak acknowledgement of the gifts (“hey, thanks!\") and outright ghosting of any affectionate texts. Things were perfect in person but not when we were communicating remotely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe both shared a dream of living close to the ocean. My choice was too far north for her, and her choice too far south for me. We swapped countless Zillow properties looking for a place where we could both live separately and start dating like “normal” people and if things worked out after a year, we could buy together. We settled on a town in North Carolina in early July.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis set off a flurry of activity on my part as I had to formalize my divorce and clear out my house and get it ready for sale. It was a chaotic time but I did manage a visit to her place in August which was a perfect as all the visits before it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExcept in one regard. She asked me to fly up to her place and provide child care the week I was scheduled to move to NC so she could attend a conference in Europe. She was very upset when I told her I would, but hoped she could find another local alternative. (She has many friends with kids in the same HS). She didn’t get authorization to attend the conference so the issue blew over.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn September, I moved out of my house and spent a lot of time in motels while tying up loose ends in my hometown and then looking for places to rent in NC. During this time, she continually (and generously) invited me to stay with her, but there was so much to do at both my home and at my destination!. After visiting a number of rentals in NC, I called her and told her that there was no way I could live in a sterile subdivision losing my mind until she and her son arrived at the end of the school semester without losing my mind and that I wanted to buy somewhere downtown I could live. She lost her shit! “How can you make decisions like that without taking my needs into account?” So, a few hours later I signed a lease in a sterile subdivision where I now can go for days without seeing another human being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe last two weeks in my home and the first two weeks in NC were hard because it was just me, my two dogs, a beach chair and an air mattress. One day in early October, I texted how lonely I was and how much I missed her. No response for two days until she called and told me it was over because for the last month my chaos had made her secondary to her needs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs she a narcissist? I don’t know. She moved emotionally much more quickly than I did at the start. Once I was “in” she began withholding affection (in the long-distance digital sense) until she got the reaction she wanted. She was very quick to anger, and on those few instances where we had a disagreement, she never accepted blame. She exhibited a sense of entitlement in asking me to look after her child the week I was moving when she had a support system of her own. Lack of empathy when I wanted to move to a part of town where I could remain sane until she and her son arrived. Telling me I placed her “secondary to my chaos” for four weeks while I was upending my life with the ultimate goal of being with her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo doubt, I have my faults. I wish my expectations of reciprocal affection weren’t so high. I wish my responses to her weren’t so emotional. But I loved her very much and wanted to feel the same in return. We went with no contact six weeks after the final call and I sent her a note on what would have been our first “anniversary.” She replied with a comment on being sorry but was tired of feeling secondary to my September chaos. I waited one week and replied with a very loving note but got no reply. So, when she started tagging her newest friend on social media, I unfriended her on social media platforms and changed all the passwords I’d shared with her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter years of a dissolving marriage and the peace that comes with an amicable separation, this relationship was the happiest I’ve been in more than a decade! The fact that I’m now in a strange town with no friends makes it all the worse. Queue Talking Heads’ “How did I get here?”. Everyone tells me “give it time, you’ll make new friends” isn’t much consolation. So, with apologies for the lengthy post, how did you cope with and recover from the “discard” phase?",

I have finally reached a point where I know I need to maintain little to no contact if I am to heal, regardless of what is going on.\n\nI am almost fully healed from my parents but… there is a whole other enmeshed family dynamic with my siblings (they work as a unit and play each other off regularly) that has been chipping away at my boundaries for years. They have no problem banding together when it suits them to ensure I’m the weakest link. (WhatsApp group without me in it, regular conversations where everything is already decided before I even get a say, accused of being selfish for not going out of my way to accommodate them). I reached a point a few months back where I have been strong enough to not back down when they were trying to manipulate, control me and throw tantrums and attack me when they didn’t get their way and issued me with an ultimatum. Their current narrative is that they’re very worried about me because I don’t log into social media regularly (I am genuinely very busy and also I just don’t want to). From this, I realised how my life is far more peaceful without them in it. I still will get a regular message or phone call out of the blue ‘for a catch up’ every few weeks or an unnecessary message just to see if I read it or engage. Right now it feels like a frustration rather than an intrusion. It suits their current narrative to be a united front and keep up appearances for everyone else. I am at a point now where I feel like telling them to stop sending me messages and just leave me alone. \nThat said… I have a box of stuff in one of their houses (placed there by another sibling, without consulting me first) that has some sentimental things in it. \nI feel like I would be digging up a lot of grief for myself for asking for it and then wanting to know more information about my life which I don’t want to share and them using it as a bargaining tool and there is another part of me that just wants to detach myself for the box so that I can just move on.

First thing I want to say is this, a lot of times, Cluster Bs have affairs, flaunt the other person in the old supplys face. That is wrong. \n\nPreface affair can be emotional , it does not have to be sexual. And affairs are wrong. If you are having an affair and you really love someone , you leave the other relationship. That simple. \n\nA lot of times when you found out your toxic person is cheating , they want to trangulate you with the affair partner. I cant not stress this enough, Not all affair partners , are aware of their toxic person REAL marital status. Had I known my toxic Ex, real status, it would have been over day 1 not a yr and some months later. Trangulation is about control and coercion. It does nt matter whether it’s a sexual issue or allowance issue, (I got you and my Ex want me to risk my job to do stuff together ) and on the romantic side, I got I wish my wife talked to me like you talked to me, if that was the case we might still be together. \n\nSimple , thing I learned . If they want to trangulate call them out on it, Hey babe , Can we hookup with the Ex, Sure as soon as I hear from her. Double red flag, and if the Ex agrees than they were probably bullied into or have other issues.\n\nNot proud of this, Why I stayed, I wanted to believe the lie? That someone like My Ex that wanted me felt great. Your divorced ? You say. No problem. I should have said let me see the papers, We cant do X, Y and Z because of your job no problem. \n\nAll the while , he had me and his wife on the same cycle. I remember \n\nWas I in in love with him and Am I in love with him. Yes I was in love with him. Or at least his false self. The person that he pretended to be. Am I in love with him, No I am not for several reasons, While I do not hate him. I am no longer in love with him for the following reasons. \n\n1) To have any kind of love for someone that has to be a foundation. Give and take. In my relationship, He was doing taking 90 percent of the time and only giving when a) he knew he needed to keep me enmeshed, b) and when I had reached my limit. \n\n2) No remorse. \n\n3) Our final battle, there were times when I wanted to leave but felt really guilty. He had expressed vulvernablity with me , and five minutes later was like hey babe, got to bounce out for a month to catch up with work.\n\n4) His defenses were to much , cluster B are abusive and chalk it up to defenses . Every time he was vulvernable with me, I paid for it with abuse\n\nThe difference between abuse and their defenses, Defenses hurt them, while their defenses and abuse hurt you .Not fair\n\nAs painful as that experience was plus dealing with a malignant narc father on his death bed, I learned a lot to . \n\n1) Boundaries,\n\n2) Trust my gut more if it does not feel right, than probably not right at all.\n\n3) Respect myself more\n\n4) Love myself more.",

My life became completely micromanaged by him even if we were long distance. He would distrust me all the time, accuse me of cheating at any text message I would receive, or if I forgot to update him with pictures throughout the day. His control escalated. He not only isolated me from my social life, but also didn't let me post any picture on social media saying it was vain, made me erase old pics, trashed my friends and called them untrustworthy bit***, started getting mad at my clothes (I swear, I don't dress revealingly), didn't let me go to the gym... And nothing I was doing was good enough to him. He always attacked me for not feeling loved enough or appreciated enough. He would always find a reason to create chaos and drama. I thought it might be the distance, but it started affecting my mental health. I was always the girlfriend who chased him, because he would leave me at every argument, but this time I couldn't take it anymore. He also had double standards and many things he banned me from doing, he excused himself for doing them. Only two days after I left, he found a new girl. Now they're around four months together. At the beginning, he still engaged with me trying to \"make this work\" or promising that once he would be back to his country we could make it work. But then, when I told him I didn't want to be his second dish, he started saying he had feelings for this girl and loved her.My last message to him went completely ignored for weeks. I expected not to hear from him again. But I got this to my Gmail today. \n\nThese were his literal words:\n\n\"In many ways you were a good girlfriend. It’s sad that it ended the way it did, and perhaps I really did drive you to quit. I’m not idealizing anyone or making anyone the demon. \n\nI’m not worth all of the time you’ve spent chasing me. My heart isn’t always pure, I can be extremely paranoid and fear driven, I can be prideful, I can be judgemental. I don’t have any money or useful skills. I’m an alcoholic. The list goes on. So move on. I’m not worth all of the heartache.\"\n\n\nI just wonder if this is a real confession and him realising his issues, or if in reality he wants me to prove him wrong by chasing him. He always told me he loved my perseverance and how I chased him every time he left me or pulled away. I'm not going to do it this time. I just don't understand if he suddenly started developing insight or what.",

As soon as it turned romantic, I spotted red flag after red flag after red flag. I was constantly in a state of uneasiness, just about everything felt wrong, and I couldn't put my finger on why. Only after it ended could I understand that I was in uncanny valley because this guy was a narcissist. But I didn't know it at the time, I didn't have the education to describe what I was experiencing. Because I'd known him for so long (or so I thought), I trusted this over my gut instinct. Out of everything, this was the biggest mistake I made. Now I am left to deal with the aftermath. The surreal, disturbing, life-changing aftermath. And it is ultimately changing me for the better. I am grateful for the experience since it slapped me in the face with the harsh realities of mental illness, abuse, trauma, red flags, and also myself and what I need to work on.\n\nThe biggest lesson I have learned from my experience is this - when you find yourself in uncanny valley, trust your gut! In the future, whether I can articulate why someone puts me at unease or not, I will act accordingly and get the hell out of there.",

My at the time fiancé, now husband, really encouraged me to reconnect because having come from a healthy family he didn’t quite get it.\n\nReluctantly I re-established contact, mostly so he could meet the rest of my family that otherwise would be very difficult to see otherwise. \n\nCue the love bombing. She kept trying to give gifts, which I politely declined. Eventually, sneaking one into my luggage. Which I left at the hotel for the maids, made sure she knew I meant it when I said “No, we have no room”. \n\nCue the tantrum and denying having snuck it into my luggage while simultaneously accusing me of being unfeeling and throwing away her “gift” to me. After spending time with my family my now husband admit he sees what I was talking about. Mirrors and glamour photo shots of her in her youth all over the house and demanding compliments all the time. Perfect, I got back to being No Contact with her.\n\nNow I require my naturalization documents to change my name to my husbands last name- should have just done it at the time of marriage. Turns out, she has my naturalization documents and won’t release them to my step father who lives in the same house to give to me until I talk to her. We haven’t talked because I’ve offended her by tossing her “gift” and I am mad at them for throwing a fit as well as bunch of other inappropriate shit that she’s said in our native language so only I would understand. Gifts start to arrive at our home. \n\nI thought I would have to break the No Contact and play her stupid games to get my documents. What she wants is me saying thank you for the gifts and that I was one reacting. That she’s great and I still need her. I’m 30. I don’t need her. \n\nMy step dad, a sweet but flying monkey- can’t understand why I don’t just ask her for them.\n\nWhat they’re going to be getting is a police report of her stealing my legal documents. Remember, narcs play power games- but the only power they have is the power we give up to them.",

        "text": "  \n\nHappy holidays,\n\nI hope you have a Narc free holidays and find the peace that you deserve . That being said, Becareful, out there, Holidays can be chaotic throw in a clusterB and it can be nightmare. During the holidays, ClusterBs go crazy because they hate the holidays . Because you have to think of others not just yourself and that is something that they cant do. Sometimes they strike immediately after holidays because they are like I need attention and validation ASAP , I had to mask up for the holidays and I need supply. \n\nThat being said here are some things to think about to keep you safe, hoover free and take back your power.\n\n1) Hoovers ARE NEVER about you . The Romantic hoover, I loves u baby give us one more chance. Unless there is an action plan like therapy involved this is about supply. And as soon as they get supply whether its attention , validation or sex. You will be discarded again.Juvenile hoovers Ie prank phone calls , etc are harder in my opinion to deal with because you are like damn I did not know I was in a relationship with a toddler. Best thing to do is not react.\n\n2) Bargaining and triangulation. I want to come back to you but I also in love with new supply , Can I hit that and than go back to them.My new supply lets me do whatever I want. Here is the thing, There is nothing wrong with polyamory if that is your thing, But 9/10 the new supply does not want to get with you and nex, and that this all the nex fantasy.Do not play the game ,because the toxic person is the one designing all the rules , and the rules are for them to win. Not you.\n\n3) I was on my wo/man socials last night and they looked so happy maybe I am the problem. So maybe they have changed. I am going to breakdown that down, only less than one percent of cluster Bs become aware, and once they become aware there is a lot of work to do, its not a pop a pill and no more NArc tendencies.Secondly lets say they have changed, and they have not come back to you with an apology .Than have they changed , yes they are now at least sociopaths because that means they were aware of the abuse that they inflicted on you . Here is the thing you do not know what the new supply boundaries are, and they are not going to post the bad stuff , remember you did not.\n\n4) FINAL ONE AND MOST important . Take care of yourself . Put yourself first. Leave the toxic person in your rearview mirror where they belong. I know its hard. But think of it this way, They worked to get you , and once they got you in their clutches, they stopped working. And know this, breakups suck and it would awesome if they were mature enough to give you closure . That is not going to happen because they lack introspection and will not truly give you closure unless they can get something from you one more time.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/zktr6s/difficulty_finding_the_right_therapist_to_help_me/",
        "text": "I started working with a new therapist about 6 weeks ago and initially I felt so relieved to find her, after my last therapist ended up being very unprofessional (the last therapist would vape in the sessions, constantly clock watch, called people I shared about c\\*nts, and talked about herself for about 10 minutes every session so it felt more like talking to an eccentric neighbour than a professional therapist).\n\nThis therapist doesn't do any of those things, initially she seemed warm, kind, empathetic and professional. She is trained in cPTSD and I had high hopes she could help me. However over the last few weeks I have started to have doubts about working with her.\n\nThings that have bothered me about this therapist:\n\n\\- In the last session I felt she seemed a bit annoyed and impatient with me, whereas I'd not felt that in previous sessions. I brought this up with her and she said she had 'really noticed that I was pushing back against structure.' By structure, she means that she has these meditation type stabilising activities she wants us to do every few sessions. To me, that isn't structure, structure to me is the whole overview therapy ie a plan to spend a few months on stabilisation work, a few months going into the traumas, a few months on how to reintegrate back into society, that kind of thing. In contrast, the therapist doesn't like me talking about structure in this way and wants to just go with the flow, which makes me feel a bit anxious about spending thousands of pounds and not making any progress.\n\n\\- I brought up my struggles with friendships and after initially sharing about it for one session, in the next session she mentioned three times that she'd like me to write 'a friendship framework' and mentioned about how it's not just the therapy session that helps us progress, it's what we do in between the therapy sessions too. I felt shut down by her mentioning this framework, as it felt like a way to shut me down from talking more about my friendship difficulties. She also gave me no guidance on how to write this framework, so I just wrote a list of traits and red flags for friendships. Maybe I read too much into her comment and was overly sensitive about it being a criticism, but I have always done a lot of work on myself outside of therapy with reading books related to emotional abuse, domestic abuse and now CPTSD to help me recover as well as using YouTube channels (such as Patrick Teahan) to help me understand myself better, so it felt like an unfair criticism.\n\n\\- She made a comment that the angle of my screen makes it look like she's looking down at me/I'm lower on the screen. She also brought up how a pen lid had dropped on the floor and I'd (very quickly) gone to pick it up, which she interpreted as me pushing back/resisting 'structure' because it was just before one of her meditation exercises. I feel these two things were very picky and they make me feel a bit like I'd have to watch the minutia of my behaviour if I continued working with her in case she noticed little things I did and criticised them. I understand the comment about the screen monitor and see her point about it important to have an equal dynamic, but I have a big desktop monitor hence why I look lower down on it so I can't do much about it. And the pen lid thing just felt unnecessarily critical?\n\n\\- I felt confused about the guided meditation exercise she wanted to do as she didn't explain it beforehand so I asked a question about it halfway through and she said 'I'm not finished yet' and was reluctant to answer my question, which meant I didn't know what I was meant to be imagining during the exercise (it was about imagining 'an ideal compassionate other.')\n\nI know these things are quite minor but I felt really triggered and depressed after the last two sessions. Today I felt she was looking at me in a kind of quizzical way, I think she just doesn't really understand me, and that makes me feel even more depressed and isolated and misunderstood which are things I struggle with anyway and ironically why I wanted to work with a therapist in the first place. \n\nI know Pete Walker talks bout finding 'a good enough therapist' which I think is helpful for me, as someone who tends to be a perfectionist. I don't need a perfect therapist but I feel like this therapist is probably not a good match for me?",

        "text": "Hi everyone.\n\nI was brutally discarded by the very covert vunerable type narcissist around 5 months ago now and it's been 4 months since we last spoke. I know NC means not looking at their social media so I finally felt OK enough to block him completely yesterday (I know I should have done it sooner)\n\nThere's been absolutely no interaction since the 2 weeks around discarded where I of course cried and asked for closure which I never got. It was only after a while I sort of realised what I'd been through and I changed my number and came off most social media. So basically now there's no way of us connecting.\n\nI have a few things I'm really stuck on and hoping someone can help me with some words of wisdom.\n\nThe first one is- I have this weird panic of us becoming strangers again. I know I should be glad to be away because he was abusive and my self esteem is shattered but that feeling of someone being so close then now we don't exist to each other, it kills me inside, I loved him deeply and I find it hard to be OK with knowing that I will never see or hear from him again.\n\nNext, I really have lost my confidence. I feel like I'm constantly comparing myself to other girls and sort of have this hate in me when I see girls who look like the kind of ones he used to look up online. I hate this because I was a very \"girl power\" kind of person and now I see other women as threats rather than friends.\n\nLastly, I'm 30 now and I'm damaged from this. I want nothing more than to have a happy life with a significant other. I'm so scared that I will be forever alone or destined for this type of relationship again. I have great friendships and I love my job, I'm close to my loved ones but it feels like something is missing for me. I deeply want to love someone and for them to love me back and for us to build something together. What if I never find that because I'm too broken to find healthy?\n\nI am trying hard to stay upbeat and positive but it hurts. I thought we were forever and I thought we would have the life we planned, its hard to accept that it was all lies and I just fear that I have so much work to do.\n\nPeople say \"don't end up alone, don't let him win\".... I just want to have normal love with someone genuine.",

        "text": "the story with my nex is so, so complicated. tl;dr: he is very talented at luring in women and getting them attached through pity and trauma bonding. when he discarded me this past August, he IMMEDIATELY moved on to one of our mutual friends. even before he left me, I had suspicions that he had feelings for this mutual friend. she later confirmed these suspicions. she confirmed them when I reached out to her and another mutual friend after realizing that he is likely dangerous. I'll never be able to prove what I've realized, but I'm *so* certain that he would take my belongings and hide them from me. he gaslit me, degraded me, and belittled my feelings. one time, the four of us (nex, me, and the two mutual friends) went to a park at night, and some drunk man confronted and threatened us. he chased our cars when we went to leave. me and the two mutual friends are still wondering if my nex potentially set up that situation.\n\nthis leads me to my dilemma. a friend who I am not as close with seems to be his friend now. his mother posted a picture of them on Facebook showing the two at their graduation ceremony. perhaps they bumped into each other without any premeditation. perhaps they're just friends who are now parting ways. I hope so, because I cannot bare to imagine her suffering the way that I did.\n\nI'm not sure if, morally, I should step in. I'm not really close with her, as I said, and we haven't even shared any forms of personal contact. I'm leaning toward the side of \"leaving them alone and wishing the best for her.\" I guess I just needed to let this out.",

        "text": "So me and my bf broke up the other day- I had no choice. I love him so much and he was kind and loving and my best friend about 80% of the time but 20% he was uncontrollably angry and aggressive.\n\nThe other day we went to bed at 9pm. I said I needed to tan my neck as I had my Christmas party the next day and he didn’t like me tanning so I said I’d do it when he fell asleep after we had a cuddle. 5 mins after he fell asleep I left silently and shut the bathroom door. I heard him say ‘can u turn that fucking bathroom light off you’ve woken me up’. I said sorry and went to bed said love u etc. I wasn’t tired so I got up to go downstairs. He got annoyed and said you’re a selfish bitch and you only think of yourself and you’ve woken me up when I have work and now you’re walking around. I explained I asked if I could tan and I tried to be silent. When I was downstairs I knew he was in a bad mood so thought if I re wake him up in an hour he probs will be angry so I went back up to get into bed and force myself to sleep. He said angrily why are u getting back into my fucking bed, you’re so fucking selfish, you’re keeping me awake. I said look I’m going to go home as I’m sick of being spoken to like shit but I am NOT breaking up with you. Well world war 10 happened. He came into the small box room where I was and screamed if you’re fucking leaving take everything with u. Started calling me every name under the sun, I’m a slag a bitch, a drama Queen an attention seeker. Screaming at the top of his voice and punching the door and trying to rip it off the hinges. I was crying saying please stop I’m scared please I’m leaving. Get out my space or I’ll call the police. He was throwing all my stuff downstairs and slamming the light on and off and the door completely out of control. He then went down and started throwing my Christmas presents onto the drive screaming at me and then threw the Christmas tree in a rage across the room screaming get the fuck out my house while I was crying and trying my best to pack my stuff to get out asap. He then text me awful abuse like im a scum bag a user a slag I never loved him.\n\nAnother is he asked me to put his door key back on his keys. I said where is it and he said I don’t know. He said it’s a square key. I found a square one on the kitchen side and asked is this it. He said yes. We went to the shop and came back and it wasn’t the front door key. He went crazy. Completely lost control. Screaming so loud and aggressive and thumping the door. Calling me a thick bitch and he’s sick of thinking for the both of us and I need to grow up I’m 25. Screaming at me when I asked his exact address for the locksmith. Uncontrollable anger.\n\nHe also was angry/ upset the other day that I had retweeted boys tweets on Twitter and that I still had boys numbers in my phone even though I never messaged anyone but him and would never cheat. He told me that I clearly wanted to be single and I wasn’t respectful and that I was all he wanted so why wasn’t it reciprocated. I told him of course he is all I want but Twitter is an app that u retweeted on. He was so angry and upset that I ended up deleting Twitter and every contact out my phone that was male. \n\nThere are many more examples I could list but the problem is I am blaming myself. I keep thinking I could have prevented this and asking myself if I triggered him and if I am everything he says I am",

        "text": "It's been 3 months now maintaining no contact and I'm trying to move on with my life. I applied for an apartment, and I'm looking for work in the area I'm moving to. A couple days ago, I received a denial letter from the apartment I applied for. The background check showed a theft charge dating back almost 2 years, along with a warrant out for my arrest for not showing up at the arraignment hearing. I nearly fainted. I have never been in trouble with the law. I called the county police department where the charge was filed. The report stated that a woman was detained for shoplifting at a certain store. When asked, she identified herself as -my name-, saying she did not have ID. The Officer looked up my driver's license photo and accepted it as correct identification. She was not booked, only trespassed from the store and released (I'm guessing because of it being a first criminal offense). I immediately knew who was responsible. Nex has an extensive background of criminal charges. Most of them being theft (mainly shoplifting). Her and I have the same basic physical descriptions (height, weight, eye and hair color). But, we do not look alike in the slightest. The Officer I spoke to on the phone pulled up her photo from when she was detained and compared it to my ID. He apologized and said he has no idea how the Officer on scene could think she was me. He submitted a request to the DA's office to have the warrant lifted, but as of now it's still active, along with the theft charge on my record. Nex and I were living together the whole time after she committed this crime. She knew I had this charge on my record and a warrant out for my arrest. I was paying her bills. She was spending my money. We were together for over 5 years. I feel so betrayed. Of all the awful and abusive things she's done over the years, for some reason, this one hurts the most. This charge is not going away until the courts sort it out and I know it won't be anytime soon. It's very possible that it will come up in future background checks, even when it's dismissed/expunged. This is just one last FU from her and one more reason why I will never, ever go back.",

My dream reaction was to just be annoyed why he would contact me and to just tell him to call someone that is interested. \n\nI know it's just a dream. However, I feel it shows a huge shift in how I feel about him and I feel confident that I could just shrug at everything he could say, should I run into him. Finally, I really feel free of his grip.

        "text": "If there is a N in your life, could be a coworker or a friend or a neighbor or someone you are dating, they will turn against you IME for the following reason:\n\nIf they sense that you don't find them charming and entertaining like everyone else does, if they sense that you don't really enjoy their company and aren't impressed by them, and they can't control your perceptions of them. Essentially, if they suspect that you see through their mask, they will turn against you.    \n\nYou might keep your feelings of dislike hidden and be nice and polite with them, but Ns have a radar I think for people who aren't going to be sources of praise and admiration. This has happened in my life many times, when I am the only one who sees their ugly qualities and somehow they know. Cue the smear campaign.\n\nYou will know the N has become your enemy when you start to notice other people around you acting weird and distant. You never had any problem with them but suddenly you feel shut out and unwelcome. You sense a new coolness in their behavior towards you and you don't know why. You look back and can't identify any reason for the change. Approaching any of them to try to ask what's going and did you do something wrong feels very awkward, like a door has been quietly shut in your face.\n\nThe N might become cold and distant as well in a way they weren't before. They will repulse any efforts on your part to clear the air or any general friendliness from you and you will sense hostility under the surface. They may become very passive aggressive towards you. This is when you really start to see who they are and what they are capable of and it can be shocking, even though you actually sensed all along that their charm is phony.\n\nIn my own life, I am dealing with this right now with a landlord I have had suspicions is Narcissistic. He lives in his condo with me and another tenant. He presents this very jovial, upbeat, generous personality and wants to be seen as a giving caring person. Over time however I have picked up on his dark side. He began talking in detail to me about his sex life soon after I moved and giving me excessive compliments, invading my boundaries by touching me, like giving me unwanted hugs and once he said he would like to kiss my neck but thought it prob wasn't a good idea. No, it wasn't. I realized what it feels like to be sexually harassed by someone who has power over you.\n\nHe has repeatedly made negative comments about women and seems to believe that all women are the same, while he wants to be *seen as* a supporter and ally of women. Once he was talking about one night stands and how women engage in this today as well as men. He looked at me with a sneering expression and said \"Don't you just think that's *disgusting*? I mean, have some self respect! How pathetic.\" Men, however, are allowed to have one night stands no problem. It's women's fault for not restraining themselves and saying no. I remember looking at him in surprise. I began to realize he has a dark side.\n\nHe is an everloving talker who loves to pounce on you when he sees you and trap you into listening to him, ignoring that you aren't in the mood and want space. These monologues are so draining and I have actively avoided him at times bc of this.\n\nHe will eat and drink my food at times and seems resentful that I ask that we not share food. He even blames the other tenant when I get upset that something of mine is missing. He makes little passive aggressive comments that imply I am rigid and selfish for not wanting to share. He is never accountable and will rewrite history so that he did nothing wrong.\n\nFinally one night when he threw out a container of my food I got snappy and openly upset, saying that this kind of thing has never happened in any place I've lived. It had been building up. The next morning he suddenly announced that my tenancy was always expected to be very short term and he needs me to move out as he has a family member coming to stay in my room. He insists that this was in the ad he posted but he is full of shit. I never would have responded an it if that was the case. I can't afford to move right now and it's the holidays so rentals are very limited. He has completely fucked me over but won't own it or apologize.\n\nHe has offered to return my deposit early but hasn't done so yet even though he knows I desperately need it. He is going to make me chase after it apparently. Realizing he is playing the situation this way confirms every bad impression I've gotten of him.\n\nRegarding the smear campaign, suddenly the other tenant is being very cool and distant towards me when we were on good terms before. The landlord's son is here a lot and it's the same with him. I have begun feeling unwelcome and I have no idea why. One morning the landlord and I were discussing me moving and I had been stressing to him that moving out is going to be very difficult and he was really blindsiding me and I don't know what to do. He and the other tenant are very friendly and he offered in front of me to go with her on an errand just to keep her company. He was waiting for her to get ready and I was still talking to him. He ended up sending me a text by mistake that was meant for her. They are bilingual and speak Spanish so the text was in Spanish. I translated it later and it said \"Get me out of here please.\" Wow. It showed me that he was talking about me behind my back to her. He is never going to tell me what's really going on.\n\nI believe now that the reason this is happening is bc he senses that I don't find him charming and wonderful and is offended by it. I also called him out on eating my food, openly showing my annoyance. I have tried my best to hide that I find him obnoxious but I think Ns just have a radar for that. If I am not going to be a source of praise and admiration then he has no use for me. His cold heartedness and lack of empathy in suddenly asking me to leave and not caring that he is pulling the rug out from under me is proof that my instincts about him were correct.\n\nThe biggest confirmation to me though is the smear campaign, the way the other people around us are suddenly acting distant and weird for no apparent reason.\n\nHave you experienced a N turning on you bc they sensed that you saw through their mask?",

When I look at them I sometimes feel like maybe I'm doing something wrong or missing out but then I know I'm not ready and I've a lot more healing to do. I met some genuinely nice guys (mutuals of some new friendships I invested in) who are into me but I cannot and I just distance myself when I saw that they seemed interested in me.\n\nI want to ask how long did it take most of you and what were some signs that show that you are ready",

        "text": "I've been researching a lot about covert narcissism and I feel my ex can be placed in this category. If anyone here has had experience with covert narcissism I would be happy to hear some stories or some experience. \n\nSomething I noticed a lot about my ex narcissistic boyfriend is his continuous need for self victimization. In fact trying to point out that he wasn't such a victim and that he had good things in his life would cause a great rage in him. The first time he raged and started lashing out at me and telling me I was using his vulnerabilities against me was when he started complaining about having to share a room with roommates (his friend and his mom), and I just pointed out that he had good things in his life such as being young, handsome and having family around and a good job. He took it as a personal offense and he told me I was using his vulnerabilities against him. \n\nHe always complained that the reason why he didn't have a career at the age of 26 was because his parents never showed him a direction in which he had to go. I literally never had any guidance in my life either, but I think it's my responsibility to find my career path, not my parent's.\nHe always criticised his parents and how they live, but then they would help him financially all the time. \n\nHe moved to another country because that was his dream (nobody forced him to) and he stumbled upon isolation and the cultural barrier and he started feeling really frustrated and really victimized. He then started controlling me more and more and restricting me from going to celebrations, including my master's degree celebration, getting paranoid over any text message I would receive or if I forgot to update him with pictures throughout the day, micromanaged my clothes and social media always finding a reason to accuse me. He even told me I wanted his passport or to take advantage of him, when he was the one having to come to my country to live with me. \n\nIf I pointed out how his behavior was affecting me, he would say that he was suffering more than I was. I tried to make him see he shouldn't be invalidating other people's pain, that we both may have suffered on the same level, but he kept insisting HE SUFFERED MORE. I was literally doing my master's degree and working at the same time and not having any external support and he would be complaining that I don't compliment him enough and creating drama and chaos, constantly accusing me of talking to men at my internship. It was the most stressful period of my life and he worsened it. He even told me he expected me to finish my master's degree already because I became a \"prideful bit**\" while doing it. He never understood my stress. Then, if I got angry at the lack of support or his constant accusations, he would feel victimized and start crying because \"life is so difficult in that new country\". \n\nWhen I left him, because he wanted to ban me from going the gym and I was literally going crazy, he started telling me I considered myself too good to endure his trauma. And he had the audacity to say I always needed to feel the victim and that I'll always be miserable (some projection going on here). Before this, if I ever attempted to leave, he would threaten suicide or literally punch his own face and send me videos of that. \n\nI've honestly never seen someone who enjoyed so much being a victim. It just felt he was always miserable no matter what he got in his life. According to him, his parents weren't supportive enough (they literally bought him his plane tickets), his co-workers hated him deep down, I wasn't loving or supportive enough, if I ever disagreed with his views he would see me as an opponent, if I said \"no\" to one of his restrictions he would tell me I'm defiant, uncooperative and unloving. He acted like the victim when his previous boss fired him for not getting the COVID vaccine and spent money on suing him, but no lawyer wanted to take his case. His life purpose was being a victim. I know people who literally come from real dirt, immigrants with no documents and I've never seen such level of misery and victimhood in them as I've seen in this person. \n\nAre these common patterns for covert narcissism? He still had grandiose business ideas and big entitlement and need for control, but I felt his need for being a victim was a core component of his personality.",

However, that was all he exhibited as a BPD, the rest is textbook NPD. \n\n1) He would control everything about me. My whereabouts, my social media, my clothes, who I can hang out with, male friends, even the gym, everything was micromanaged and allowed or restricted by him. He would literally throw fits, tell me it was either his way or the highway if I didn't accept one restriction. He didn't let me post any picture, not even a selfie, because it was too vain according to him. He even wanted me to deactivate all social media. Of course, he never applied the same standards to himself, he found excuses to go to parties and go to the gym, because it was a place for men, not women. \n\n2) He manipulated and gaslit me. He would use the Bible to demand submission, twisting scripture to fit his agenda. He literally called me vain and ungodly for wanting to do my master's degree, meanwhile he bought expensive phones and invested in crypto to get rich. \n\n3) He had tremendous delusions of grandeur. He thought he could be a model when he was completely out of. He was convinced he would get rich out of crypto. He was convinced he could create businesses and had a lot of different grandiose ideas that he never brought to fruition. He even believed that at some point he would become a very famous and hated public figure and that I should accept it. \n\n4) He would continuously accuse me and make me walk on eggshells. He would accuse me of cheating if the call dropped. He would accuse me of cheating if I forgot to update him with pictures throughout the day. He would accuse me of cheating if I received a text message and I showed him my chat lock and he couldn't find any proof. She would misinterpret all my actions and think that I'm out to get him or provoke him or make him mad. He never trusted my well-intentioned actions. \n\n5) He had an absolute inability to understand the damage he was causing and he would get into rages if I ever brought up the past. He would quickly apologize and expect me to never bring it up. He would deny things that happened and twist events of the past to fit his narrative of \"good guy\". \n\n6) After I left, he found a new girl in only two days, he clearly triangulated me with the new supply and tried to keep me in his life while dating the new girl. He rubbed her in my face and said how better she was. Wanted to keep me there though, and relive our relationship once he moved back to his country. \n\nI could continue. I just don't understand people who underestimate the possibility that two diagnoses could be applied to the same person. I talked to a therapist who said he was clearly narcissistic. \n\nWhat do you think?",

        "text": "If anyone tries to turn relationships/socialization into a hierarchy be very wary of them and avoid them at all costs imo\n\nSo my life is trauma in it's entirety, the earliest memories I can remember, are being chased 2 random people in my neighborhood and cornered at about maybe 4-5, followed by my landlord #1 male beating me bloody for supposedly stealing from him around the same age maybe 5-6, I didn't even really know who my landlord #1 was in my mind until maybe around 10-11 he was there but he really wasn't ig I didn't see him as a figure in my life until that age,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy Landlords were chronically abusive Narcs as far as I can tell their kin are as well, early on I was NOT the scapegoat that started when I started thinking for myself after going to school ig, then it would cycle, between me, sibling #3 and other sibling #4, usually more so me, our parents would physically abuse us for having issues with our bathroom, at least ik they did to me, and maybe my sibling #2, verbal and emotional abuse was most prominent however, I may be the only one who didn't come out with NPD, we have a bloodline of bs abuse and abusive patterns, as their parents were utterly shitty as well but the narc in them refuses to admit it\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway we used to be spanked a lot, they'd tape paddles together for twice the abuse, and use belts or switches make us pick out the switches\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I went to school I was oddly very liked and protected more so than ever before by classmates who actually liked me, which was a really nice change of pace, it would be one of the only ones I suppose, and it lasted only a year\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy siblings and parents were not I do feel sorry for them in a way tbh, they don't even recognize their brokenness\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEldest sibling was probably abused the worst after I by our parents, followed by the second eldest, and then the 3rd who was messed up a lot by me and my siblings when they were much younger, it's likely why they were a malignant narc\n\nFollowing this, following that the timeline of events isn't exact in my mind, but our Grandparents were and are scum of the lowest order, since they created this, and their parents created it, I hate them, they'd encourage more abuse while also gifting things to us but never truly loving us in spite of what family would say, I remember them talking about smacking across the mouth, and more I don't wish to get into, however the trauma bonds are strong in their family\n\nEveryone of us has tried to run away before, but one, and I did so often and was left for dead once because of it\n\nThe verbal and emotional abuse can't even be quantified but at this point it's had a severe effect on me, as with my Covert NEX I responded really shttily to them after our breakup and their reactive abuse they learned from their shtty landlords, the worst bu I ever had and one I didn't need, I honestly would've rather found out they were a narc years later, but I digress, sent them shtty emails and msgs about their character, apologized profusely and sent them a last gift and apology, ended things on a sort of good bad/note but who knows what smear campaign they've done against my character, that I can only partially blame them for at this point, as I was a pretty bad partner to them in terms of promises\n\nI just can only punch up really at this point, I've stopped punching\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI remember this memory of going to protect my sibling #2 from a neighborhood bully on my bike and failing horribly and hurting myself because, I was just that uncoordinated, crying about what happened and that I couldn't protect them, and now I don't even know how much of it is to blame for me why they acted the way they did\n\nI was a fucking tattletale when I was much younger, it was the only way I knew how to protect myself, my default, I was singled out and bullied by DARVO Tactics from them, but I didn't have the emotional nuance to just protect myself when younger ngl, it was just as much about getting even as it was protecting myself, and anyway now they're broken and I wish I could fix them, ig none of them were taught how to love, because they're definitely not aware of how to as of now\n\nProtecting myself physically speaking when I got older would be used as DARVO to pretend as if I was the abuser, self-defense is what I'm referring to, and though I had numerous recordings I deleted them out of remorse and fear, same with my nex in regards to receipts as to their behavior, I don't want to use the character assassinations tactics they'd use against me, and didn't want to turn it into, a them vs me but I guess it is at this point\n\nMy NEX cheated on me lied about it denied it, and wouldn't admit it they were my longest relationship, I lied about a lot during my relationship with their to bolster their opinion of me ngl and a ton of white lies to make them feel better about what was going on, well I guess I already did, didn't recognize the heavy mirroring behavior until after, but I also thought that perhaps they were just like me I have mild N tendencies according to an online test, and it makes sense, as I do and did have mirroring behavior myself too\n\nThe embellishing was never extreme enough for it to matter in my mind, but lies are lies, even white ones to an extent\n\nIronically however most of the truth in our relationship made it more beautiful than ever, they are sort of self-aware and I swear sent heavy hints to their covert N issues, but not to the point of recognizing it, they even think their family is ok, in spite of their being a scape goat for them sadly, I really wish I could help their and could've saved them, but I won't share the details of them that don't relate to me here, as that would be really wrong\n\nMy Landlord #1 has severe ego issues much more apparently than my Landlord #2 Female, Sibling #1 maybe a Covert Narc stolen many ideas and things from me, Sibling #3 is Malignant blatant identity theft from me and huge vendetta against me, Sibling #4 OCPD and or NPD idk but they're deluded and I wasted my time trying to protect them, well all of them I guess\n\nI remember one of the first times in which I ran away due to scapegoating returning out fear of where I'd go, shortly after the beating having my retard of a \"guardian\" #1 say the quiet part loud, \"you have any idea how embarrassing that is for me\"\n\nI remember bullying my younger sibling about their skin condition when they was younger alongside other siblings partaking in the very future that's shaped today with their absence of empathy/love\n\nI remember the few good times that were there being so nice, so happy, being happy because others are happy even\n\nI remember wetting the bed and being punished for it until I was 11-13 years old shaping part of my incontinence issues even today\n\nI remember my sibling #2 being bullied just as I, in various social circles School, Neighborhood, Family and online\n\nThe Narc Sense is unparalleled in the way it targets destroys and reconstructs in it's own image\n\nI remember learning that the most personally destructive type of personality disorder ik, is supposed to be impersonal and not about you, but only about them, in makes sense in a sort of way\n\nNot sure if I have OCD + Fearful Avoidant Attachment or BPD, or what but, I have strong abandonment issues myself, that I've even detached from at this point, emotionally detached away from everything, so if my NEX attacks me like they say is possible, and or family I'll use it, like I originally planned to when starting the relationship with them anyway\n\nI can't get into the emotional and verbal abuse, but being afraid of every new stranger, of being around your family of everyone around you, for me it's stopped at this point, but the fact that it was there for decades is woah\n\nIt's clearly not a healthy way of living\n\nI wondered about my heart palpitations realizing why I have them and - [https://psychcentral.com/health/effects-of-emotional-abuse#mental-health-impacts](https://psychcentral.com/health/effects-of-emotional-abuse#mental-health-impacts), now I get why\n\nFor so long I thought it was due to other issues because we lived in a broken down mold filled house infested with bugs and decay, that I suppose represents the decay of our character and supposed \"family\" as well\n\nI've probably had let's just say 31 beatings out of a completely random number because it's blurred as to how many occurrences there were, with tools paddles, switches, belts or hands, choked etc, etc, slammed against walls, slapped, smacked, punched in the sternum, face thrown into metal doors, organs sat on, etc, all brought on by disrespect I did start defending myself against them in time but was never the lead cause ever,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Gaslighting and DARVO is amazing how it makes you feel that you're the only crazy one, and that you are the sole cause\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSee the reason why I was originally a golden child until like 8 years old, is because landlords #1 and #2, felt the need to protect because they were singled out when they were with their siblings and still were last I was with them tbh 6 siblings for Landlord #1, and 8 for Landlord #2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe others are still under the delusion MOST of the people around them would be like 90% of both \"familial tied groups, in all 3 of them\" ex, Guardian #1 and Guardian #2\n\nI remember being told so many times about they'd kill me if I did X, Y or Z in regards to disrespect, and how their parents would've killed them if they did X Y or Z in regards to disrespect, but idc about death anymore, I care about growth and change, which is why I'll sooner go away for what I did then end my life, which I'm also unafraid of doing, and have attempted before\n\nBecause I want them to get their brain scans for NPD potentially, and I want to be away from them, at any cost beyond hurting them more, which is why I left and I will not contact them ever again, well those left anyway\n\nHaving your testicles impaled by a sibling, being turned into a perma-maid by landlords #1 and #2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll those times Sibling would run away I thought to myself why not just apologize and talk it out, then realizing why that occurred because landlords do not care, any good traits are a façade, a ploy or to minimal to matter when juxtaposed to your mental health whilst dealing with NPD\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDenial of illness for the longest time, minimization if not outright ignoring of abuse, being left for dead twice, scolded for defending yourself, domestic theft\n\nIf it's on here it happened x100+ [https://outofthefog.website/personality-disorders-1/2015/12/6/narcissistic-personality-disorder-npd](https://outofthefog.website/personality-disorders-1/2015/12/6/narcissistic-personality-disorder-npd)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSocial Isolation to the point where I and my Ex ironically can't even hold conversations, landlords and siblings had these issues to and don't even realize it or recognize it\n\nTargeted for being happy no joke\n\nI remember my sibling #1 who was one of the \"better advocates\" now I realize it's because my \"value\" not because of love apparently NPD can't love, and that explains the unchosen yet chosen abuse dealt with here, and sibling #4\n\nand Landlord #2 Female supposedly being another more so advocate,\n\nAnd Ik how my life will be cherry picked and negative actions singled out and amplified, and man have I had some shtty actions, hell I'm not even able to tell the full story myself, I just know that I don't have the agenda they seem to treating people as goals and what not or do I\n\nBecause here's what I've done during one of the points in which was the height of my scapegoating at 11-14 yrs old, looked up non legal stuff on my tablet but never actually saw anything non legal,\n\nThen Landlord #2 Parents Passed, but not before one came to live with us, I was tasked to give up my room and take care of them for the most part alongside landlord #2, landlord #2 had no problem abusing the, seldom when they wouldn't do what they wanted they had Brain neuro-degeneracy condition and couldn't think for themselves anymore at all, only got worse with time, one time I remember seeing her drag her across the floor for not doing something realizing just the scope of the unresolved trauma she had\n\nI also remember the ostracization of every social circle I got in, one way or another, some more balanced then others, but always feeling a target on my back no matter how I acted, more passive or more confident, more douche-like or more caring, etc, etc, all of my face reveals going horribly, whilst only having 3 severely impacted me so and the NEX was just the last straw not even sure she has NPD or what but she betrayed me so severely at such an important and central time apathetically as well cheating and blaming me instead of communicating not even sure if or how personal it was but wow\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBehavior is learned right, idk but it doesn't justify what I did, that learned choking and slapping I also used against the abuser of my abuser sometimes, this was a person Ik, a person I'd grown to hate, and realize what they are, but also a person who like I wasn't as aware of their issues as they needed to be and how could they be\n\nLandlord #2's parents were supposed saints yet treated their kids so badly they unmade them and I remember sitting in their car at times and they'd just criticize and chastise people walking by beyond bitter people, I remember drawing a portrait of myself for Landlord #2's parent that came to live and before her condition she couldn't even put on a false sense of happiness about it, clear apparent and evident NPD as they both seemed to have both of Landlord #2's parents, and Landlord #1's parents as well\n\nNot sure to the level my landlords had it before they passed but, it's later now and it still disturbs me to such an extent what I've done, I also searched for other damaged broken people as partners because I was that fked up at a time, I left out a lot of stuff, such as being handcuffed and imprisoned unlawfully by them\n\nThe psychological warfare is what's ended, due to my choice and that's why I'm at peace wherever I am, and wherever I'll be.\n\nRn I'm at least out of their lives, with that ever-present concern for them and their potential growth still stirring, I will no longer attempt to help or make it my responsibility any of them.",

Fortunately this worked, and I was still able to keep the small entity we work for a secret. \n\nThis made me realize that it’s not just us I have to protect from her insanity, but anyone in our proximity. So now, if I do post any details about our lives, I usually change the details just enough to protect both us and those around us. I often obscure our exact location and wait to post until after whatever life/work event has taken place. \n\nThis has led to her smear campaigns becoming so laughably grandiose and straight-up ridiculous that I feel somewhat bad for manipulating someone who is mentally ill. She’s made it clear that she won’t stop though, and after moving to another state and changing our phone numbers, I find throwing breadcrumbs off our trail to be the most effective way to keep ourselves and those around us safe.\n\nHas anyone else used similar tactics to live a more peaceful, narc-free life?",

        "text": "So I went grocery shopping yesterday and had a feeling I’d run into her. Lo and behold, guess who taps my shoulder? I turned around….saw her, and felt nothing. Not anger, not sadness, just plain indifference. She didn’t look too great. She was shooting the breeze like nothing ever happened, and I wanted to really tell her how I felt, but knowing she’d get a rise out of that, I bit my tongue. Proud of myself for taking the high road, but man was it hard. Had a 3 minute superficial convo and then I said, “I gotta go.” She certainly turned on the charm. But now, I’m at peace….she can’t hurt me anymore. And for that, I’ll forever be grateful. On top of that, I think there’s a coworker of mine who’s into me who wants to go out to dinner for my bday…and she’s nothing like the person I mentioned above. \n\nI just wanna say, if you’re out there and struggling with leaving, you’re not alone. It’s probably one of the hardest things ever. You feel like your heart and mind are gonna explode. But you can make it through, please stick with NC. It’s used because it works! Trust me, I’m proof. And just remember, you deserve someone who cares about you. You’re definitely worth it. Just hang in there, please.\n\nAll the best, \nAn internet stranger who cares \n\nTL;DR - I saw my nex yesterday and it didn’t bother me, proud of myself.",

        "text": "For context, I have been no contact for a year on next Tuesday. I was on campus with a friend going to a study room in the library when I walked into the room and he was sitting at the table in front of me, 5 ft from my staring at me. He gave me an expressionless stare and it took my brain a few seconds to realize it was actually him in front of my face. I immediately turned around, grabbed my friend and walked out of the room. My mistake I feel like is that I turned around to look back at him (he was still staring) and slapped my hand over my mouth out of pure shock. After calming down outside in the hallway, me and my friend decided to go back in and act like I didn’t know my ex. I sat a table with my back to him and refused to even glance in his direction. My friend said he continued to stare, and when I got up to draw on the whiteboard, my ex (who was tutoring a friend) would talk to his friend but began to stutter a lot and wouldn’t stop staring at my back. My ex and his friend stayed another 20 minutes and then they left, my ex passing by so close to me that he almost bumped into me. My ex tried to come back 20 minutes later but his table had been occupied so he left. I feel so strange and can’t get his blank stare out of my mind, it was so uncomfortable because he didn’t even raise his eyebrows in surprise, look angry, or look sad. It was like staring into nothingness, has anyone experienced this from their ex narc before?",

        "text": "Long backstory: \n\nMy sister and I were close, or so I thought. When my in laws passed away, my spouse and his siblings split the sale of the house and inherited money. When that happened, it seems my relationship changed and I was viewed as an ATM. My sister even looked up the sale of the home and told others that we all got over $230,000, which is not true, there was still a mortgage, hospital bills and other bills that needed to be paid. I don’t believe it matters the amount received, she wants us to pay off her car, pay her utilities and help with her bills. At one point we discussed paying off her car when the housing market was better and we thought the home was going to sell for more money, but it did not. I never promised anything. I said we will see what happens. Money was also tied up for months in probate. \n\nDuring this time, I have received multiple messages that she is going to lose her rental home, live in the dark, live in a shelter, give her baby up for adoption, give up her other kids to their baby daddy’s and even that she was going to hurt herself. \n\nOne night I received a photo of a knife and she said she was going to harm herself because she was going to have her water turned off. I messaged her ex and asked them to call 911, I’m not in the state so I get stuck on hold for hours. When CPS got involved she blamed me. She said I called CPS and reported her, I did no such thing. \n\nA few weeks ago she messaged and apologized and I accepted her apology but was treading lightly. She did manipulate me into flying her here for thanksgiving, she told me she couldn’t be alone for the holiday, so that was a 600.00 trip. I felt giving and gave her 50.00 for gas via Venmo, she told me she can’t access it at the time. She sent me photos of her accounts with shut off notices and I sent her 1000.00 thru zelle.I told her to make sure to get caught up on her utilities, apply for assistance/discounts with the companies and file bankruptcy to get a fresh start. \n\nWhile here she booked a trip for piercing her babies ears and her nose and that was about 200.00. When she went to pay, I said I would take care of it because I didn’t want to hear about her not having money for her bills. I was actually quite shocked that she’d make an appt when she has no extra money. Did she expect me to pay???\n\nAfter she left, I received some texts about how I spoil my nephew we adopted, how she can’t believe that I have purchased a new bed, nightstands and a dresser (all from Ikea. mine were all broken and my husband has held them together with screws and shims for awhile now).  She also went off about some cheap ikea bookshelves and a dining room table I bought. I’ve had the same bookshelves for 20 years. My dining table over ten years. I don’t see why it matters to her what we spend the money on, I still have financed things and she tells everyone we pay cash with all the money we are flaunting. \n\nPrior to us having a falling out I was giving her 500.00 a month to pay her bills, but she got mad when I couldn’t pay her on demand and she blocked me. I calculated it out and with everything taken from my check and her getting child support she was actually bringing in more than I did per month. Yes, I understand she is a single parent, but does that mean I need to finance her life? \n\nThe texts she sends me are so demeaning. Blaming me for giving her Covid while she was here, saying our mom would be so disappointed in how I don’t mhelp her (our mom passed March 2020). That’s a nice punch in the gut. Calling me heartless (hence the username) and selfish for not giving her more. Is this gaslighting? Narcissism? What do I do?",
