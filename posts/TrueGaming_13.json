        "text": "This makes absolutely zero sense to me. No other medium does this. A book, movie, or play analysis isn't going to stretch out to half the runtime of its subject just describing the plot in exhaustive detail.\n\nPatricianTV's latest Skyrim analysis is literally 11 hours long, but it's only got about an hour and a half of novel analysis. The remainder is just recap– as though there haven't been literally dozens of hours-long Skyrim videos that do the exact same thing.\n\nI think these people are copying Joseph Anderson, but they don't understand that (with the exception of the Witcher series, which he ran into writers block with for a reason) his super granular analysis is always focused on ANALYSIS, and recap is just there to contextualize that analysis. His videos are very dense, that's why copycats found him so inspirational. Spending an hour narrating the plot of Skyrim's thieves guild with a line of analysis every 5 minutes or so isn't the same.\n\nIt seems like game essayists always run in one of two directions– ten minute long advertiser friendly videos like GameMaker's Toolkit, or 7 hour long recaps with analysis sprinkled through. I wish they'd just assume that anyone who cares enough to WATCH their videos has played the damn game already, and just focus on the part they're actually contributing, their opinions.\n\nThere's almost no high-level discussion of game design from a critical perspective on YouTube, focused on \"how things are done\" and \"what the game accomplishes\" rather than most \"what the game is\". An hour long video on JUST Skyrim's quest design would be worth a dozen \"complete retrospectives\" that package a tiny amount of original thought in miles of ASMR recap. Or even a video on quest design across games as a whole, rather than just individual titles.\n\nI feel like game analysis YouTubers probably frequent this subreddit. If you've got one of these channels, and you see this, for the love of God stop recapping and just tell your audience things they don't already know. It's just dead air.",

        "text": "*spoilers have been hidden in case someone is still working their way through the story. I think the sentiment can still be understood even if the spoilers aren’t opened.\n\nI’ve invested money and no insignificant amount of time getting remote play to a point that it’s both comfortable and optimal. I love this technology and will continue to use it until it is no longer an option available to me. That being said, this is the first game I regret playing via remote play on a steam deck and iPhone.\n\nTo be more specific, the boss fight with &gt;!Garm!&lt; was played via remote play on the steam deck. There’s a specific scene during the boss fight &gt;!where Garm is staring you down against what appears to be a sunset in Helheim!&lt; and I just wasn’t immersed. The screen was low resolution and  lower quality compared to the OLED TV in my office and it dampened what should’ve been an otherwise epic and awesome fight. And I know comparing to an OLED is unfair and I know the limitations of the steam deck when I went in, this isn’t a slight against the steam deck. \n\nHowever a few chapters later you meet the &gt;!wolves who chase the Sun and moon!&lt; and I was playing via remote play on my iPhone with a razer Kishi attached. The phone has an OLED screen and I experienced the scene from the trailer &gt;!where Atreus fires an arrow at the sky and changes the day and night cycle!&lt;. And again I got the same feeling. Such an epic moment confined to a small screen in the palm of my hands. While the tech and ability to have this experience is awesome, i can’t help but feel like I got the watered down version. I now fully understand that commercial that plays right before the movie in theaters where they go “if you’re watching on a screen ‘this big’ you’re not having the full experience” as they play with aspect ratio to make the screen seem smaller. \n\nThere were things that I did to help the immersion , for example the boss fight was played with headphones and the music absolutely helped improve the experience and in hindsight I could’ve used the share button and recorded recent gameplay and recorded a set amount of game play to watch it back later. But that isn’t the same. Seeing an awesome scene happen as you’re playing is part of the reason why I play video games. \n\nI learned my lesson and did story missions when I had the time to sit in front of my tv and finished the game and experienced the ending of the story on my TV and I’m glad I did, had I experienced some of those scenes for the first time on a smaller device I would’ve felt like I missed out. I won’t stop using remote play but I now find myself being a bit more selective on when and what I want to play via remote play. While I don’t have an upcoming game I’m excited for that is quite on the scale as the epic that is God of War Ragnarok, I wonder if it’s a game specific issue, a me issue or a remote play issue.",

        "text": "I've always been a big story/world guy in video games. As a kid, I was drawn to open or semi-open world games like Zelda, Oblivion, whatever. After the game/main quest was over, I'd load up the save file and just hang out in the world. I spent a lot of time fishing in Twilight Princess just to have an excuse to keep being in Hyrule. But something that always bothered me is that most games like this (especially the semi-open style like Zelda, as opposed to explicit sandboxes like Bethesda games) don't have \"end-states\". I'd load up Twilight Princess to just chill out and ride Epona, and there's this giant evil black pyramid over the town, and the end of the world is imminent. I always wished more games had an end-state after you beat the game, so if you come back to do the optional stuff, the NPCs have different dialogue and the world *acknowledges* that you saved it and that everything's fine.\n\nI don't know if I can think of any games that do this, honestly. Stuff like Elder Scrolls kinda doesn't count because those games are continually dynamically updating themselves in response to your actions anyway, the game is built as a big pile of small quests rather than a single traditional static \"story\", if that makes any sense at all.\n\nSome non examples that disappointed me as a kid:\n\n- Twilight Princess and Wind Waker, like I said. Ganon is still right there threatening the world. TP I get because some of the events of the ending would actually have implications on gameplay (&gt;!Midna's gone!&lt;), but in WW all you would need is to have your boat be non-sentient and have Tetra hanging out somewhere.\n\n- Pokemon Red, the Elite Four don't acknowledge that you're the champion now. Would have been cool if you could fight them again, but the dialogue treats it like friendly sparring. Final Rival fight could just be missing, and maybe you can find Gary hanging out in the Seafoam Islands or something, Red style.\n\n- Mario Sunshine *almost* nails it. Isle Delphino is back to normal and all the islanders talk about how you saved the day... except, for some reason, the Toads, who still talk how the Princess has been kidnapped and you have to help her. So this one is weird because it's actually internally contradictory. Only reason I can think of is so you can fight the final boss again, but honestly who cares?\n\nAny games you know that have end states? Any games you always wished did?",

        "text": "NOTE: i posted this originally in the final fantasy sub, but i thought i would be able to have a more meaningful conversation in this sub instead. FF VII has some pretty ardent fans—for good reason—but i’d like to be able to discuss the game with the nostalgia goggles off and from an unbiased perspective. i don’t want people to just agree with me though; rather, i’d simply like to be able to discuss the game with as little emotional baggage as possible. that might be difficult with a game like FF VII, but i’d still like to try (:\n\nPOST STARTS HERE:\n\nthere are some things that hold it back narratively imo. namely:\n\n—the unnecessary and poorly utilized mini games\n\n—the somewhat poorly written or underutilized female characters\n\n—some truly “wtf” plot points\n\n—lackluster final boss fight \n\nThe Mini Games\n\ni won’t speak much about the mini games because that’s kind of self-explanatory but jesus were there a lot in this game and so many of them were poorly explained, poorly implemented, and mechanically clunky. i mean, i still don’t know how i saved that little girl from drowning, but at least i got some materia 🤷🏻‍♂️ \n\nThe Female Characters\n\ni often really hated how tifa and aerith were written throughout the game. individually, they’re fantastic (especially aerith imo) but whenever they’re together (especially if cloud is there with them) all of their beautiful characterization falls apart to become yet another waifu simulation. i even tried to not play the game romantically (the game does allow you as cloud to choose more platonic responses during the more romance-coded moments) but in spite of this, the game still pushes aerith and tifa onto the player and tifa still becomes endgame for cloud.\n\neven though i do think aerith and tifa are fantastic individually, there were still a lot of moments throughout their individual character arcs that kind of rubbed me the wrong way. i know that it’s probably the most iconic scene in the game but i actually hate that aerith dies. i think the game poorly explains why this even needs to happen and the whole thing with the holy materia wasn’t nearly impactful enough narratively to justify it in the end. i would have much rather have continued to explore aerith’s character and watch her grow outside of her “princess in the tower” macguffin trope. instead she just leans into that trope further, further cementing herself as little more than a plot device. if nothing else, i think her death came too  early in the game and would have felt more impactful if it had occurred by the end of disc 2 maybe.\n\ntifa constantly effaces herself for cloud and even stops trying to save the world to watch him just sit in a hospital room. does she not realize everyone, including cloud, will die if she doesn’t stop the giant meteor heading to earth? this part was especially disappointing to me because it comes soon after we get control of tifa in the story. instead of finally watching tifa be, you know, the heroine of FF VII, she gets sidelined for cid, a dude who emotionally abused his wife. i think there’s also a scene right before tifa chooses cloud over saving the world in which barrett gives her a pep talk and tries to shake some sense into her. he implies that she’s lost her focus and her fire because of her relationship with cloud. it seems like she’ll finally wake up from this kind of listlessness she’s carried with her throughout the whole game and finally have some agency in the story, but then she just continues on exactly as she was before. there’s also some ludonarrative dissonance here for me because tifa was by far the most powerful character mechanically for me in combat, so the fact that she gets into a slap fight with a weak ass business woman and just does whatever cloud wants throughout the game makes even less sense to me. \n\nthat all being said, i actually really liked yuffie. if you pick her up early in the game and use her in your party often (she took the place of aerith for me), she actually gets a good amount of characterization. and i liked the wutai stuff. i also felt pretty badass taking on all of the warriors in wutai with her. \n\nThe WTF Plot Points\n\nmoving onto the plot… this game felt like it was written by an eight year old constantly going “and then this happened and now this and this…” like, this game really relied on the factor of cool to carry it through. i mean, first there’s an evil corporation and then there’s an ancient civilization and then there’s a lifestream and now a meteor hurdling to earth and natural weapons the earth creates to protect itself (that look like transformers btw) and a rocket ship and now we’re in space and oh yeah there are clones and maybe aliens??? and i get that this is kind of a trope of the genre but i’ve played FF VI-XV, including the sequels, and i have never experienced nearly as many “wtf” moments as i did with FF VII. there was often just too much happening all at once. and i think you can feel this the most by the time you reach the end of the game and watch as several plot points are either ignored or tightly wrapped up in a neat little bow. \n\nLackluster Final Boss Fight\n\nsephiroth is fucking badass and terrifying even in his weird blocky chibi form. that is such a testament to the sound design and cinematography of the game. but then he doesn’t really do very much throughout the game. or rather, he flies in, some spooky music plays, he usually takes something from the group after they just spent an hour trekking through a dungeon to get it, and then leaves. he never even really fights you at all throughout the game, which is unusual in a series that usually pits you against the main antagonist at least a few times throughout the game. when i finally got to the end of the game, i thought i was finally going to fight sephiroth mano a mano, but instead he’s this weird amorphous blob version of himself and uh, really easy. probably the easiest final boss for me as far as my FF playthroughs go. in addition to not being that difficult mechanically, he also doesn’t bring much to the table narratively either at that point. compared to say, kuja or even kefka (who has some pretty good thematically sound monologues at the end, not to mention a badass final boss design), sephiroth goes out with a whimper rather than a bang. which, again, is a shame, since he’s so fucking cool before then. \n\noh yeah, and jenova was there for like 2 seconds. seriously, that’s all we get after hearing her name 20 million times during the playthrough??\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nthis post is already too long so i’ll just say this: i did enjoy my time with FF VII and i am so appreciative of what it did to help push games and JRPGs especially into their next evolutionary stage, but i do think the graphics and sheer scope of its narrative (which is impressive even if it doesn’t always stick the landing) overshadows some of its messier parts. i think it’s a good game and meaningful, but definitely not the best the series has to offer when you look at the series retrospectively.",

        "text": "I mean, video games are the perfect medium for this type of narrative structure and i feel it has not been exploited enough. I just feel sad that movie-like games ended up prevailing, making games feel as just interactive films, when the branching storytelling or even the game taking totally different routes depending on your action seems an alternative that can work very well in games. And i don't mean just different lines of dialogue or endings but literally the game taking different vibes and narratives depending on your decisions.\n\nIt is certainly more ambitious and difficult but it is a path that needs to be explored more. Some memorable examples to see what i mean is something like the game Star Fox 64, or The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, which had a three day cycle and on each cycle you lived different lives and adventures.\n\nThis is something where the medium of visual novels is leaps and bounds ahead, although these are closer to books than games since most of the time you just click and select lines of text. They are not very popular in the west since they are often known as cringy dating simulators for weebs. But don't sleep of them, there are truly some gems of storytelling hidden in there. I was blown away with the narrative of a game called Muv Luv, one of the most ambitious pieces of storytelling i have ever read; there is also the more well known example of Doki Doki Literature Club which pretty much became viral, although mostly because of its meta scary format.\n\nIn any case i would like to know if there are truly gameplay based games out there that take this format seriously. I have heard that the Mass Effect series is this way. I haven't played them, but does really the story and the game itself change that much depending on what you do? What examples of successful games in this format you know of?\n\nI feel there is so much untapped potential there and not even the Star Fox series or the Zelda series continued to play with the format in subsequent games. A very ambitious masterpiece can be made this way if you put the same care on every branch, in both gameplay and structure. Games have the potential to branch out (literally) from Hollywood and book type narratives this way.",

Was thinking about recent events and was capturing a valuable lesson and reminder from this recent Pokémon release: \n\nEnjoy things while you can. While you know it’s good, enjoy it. Understand that it WILL change and probably not in a way you might like. All successful things eventually get too big for their britches and eventually it’s not about player feedback anymore and it’s not about the community anymore.\n\nThe community is no longer a factor in the development of a Pokémon game anymore - it doesn’t matter what game freak makes, the Pokémon fandom IS buying it. As sure as the sun rising in the east and setting in the west - MILLIONS of people will buy literally any Pokémon game that releases. Therefore Game Freak is not required to make a game that is “good”, they are required to publish - A - game. This trend will continue for as long as pokemon fans exist which will be forever. \n\nSame thing is happening to Magic The Gathering. Same thing has happened to WoW. Same thing has happened to any intellectual property that started as a little passion project that has now gigantamaxxed into the mainstream public eye and functionally generates millions in revenue - we are not apart of the equation any longer.\n\nEnjoy the good things while you can folks.",

Elden ring just shows how well an open world can work with a dark souls games . capitalizing on this there seems to be great potential in a  medieval souls-like rpg with similar style bosses , (can be relatively less) punishing gameplay , with more emphasis on cutscenes and story , with very little hand-holding (kinda like a tutorial Elden ring gives us ) .\n\ni have a simple taste , i love elden ring and also like the last of us . taking nothing away from both of these .",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/z4qwb2/why_are_western_aaa_games_the_only_ones_that_seem/",
        "text": "Truth be told, I'm already not a huge fan of this supposed dichotomy between *\"Western\"* and *\"Eastern\"* games. Sure, there will be some cultural trends based on where media is released but I feel like it's being used less as a descriptor of these trends and more of just a blanket insult. \n\nFor instance, I've been seeing a lot of comments about how *\"western\"* AAA games are way too handholdy and explain mechanics too much. If only western developers learned from our Japanese gaming gods about real game design. This sentiment begs the question: Do you play *any* Japanese games besides FromSoft games?\n\nJust thinking off the top of my head, I think about something like Persona 4 and 5 in which the first solid 10 hours are pretty much an extended tutorial section in which the game needs to stop and explain to you the litany of mechanics you need to remember. Persona 5 Royal (my favorite of the series) has some serious pacing issues in this section too because they have to explain the mechanics from Vanilla P5 *and* the new mechanics they added for Royal. So characters are constantly halting everything to shout how the new mechanics work at you. Again, not a huge deal but it's definitely noticable. \n\nDeath Stranding is an \"Eastern\" game and an excellent one at that. Die Hardman, Mama, Deadman, Heartman, etc. call you *constantly* to verbally explain how every single newly introduced item or mechanic works. Supposed to redundancy. Die Hardman will brief you on a delivery and then call you again 30 seconds after the briefing to remind you about what he said at he the briefing. I imagine this game gets a pass because the gameplay loop itself is so freeflowing and open to exploration. \n\nYakuza is another game that I genuinely like but would sometimes find it annoying to play because there's so many mini games, mechanics and activities that are zany and not particularly intuitive. So what does the game do? It goes into a hard stop and you read text bubbles for about three minutes about how to accomplish whatever you need to do at that time. Whether it be in combat or in mini games. The game is constantly stopping to tell you what to do. \n\nOr you have something like Pokemon Scarlet where you're not even able to meaningfully explore the open world until after a 3 hour tutorial session of meaningless dialogue where you're railroaded onto a certain path and the game will literally go into a hard stop to tell the player, *\"Hey. You can't go that way right now.\"*\n\nI suppose I could go on. I don't want to bring up old shit. But, *\"Get up on the Hydra's back!\"* is still a meme when it comes to this complaint and that's distinctly from a Japanese game. But I guess I'm not seeing this dichotomy where awful Western devs think their audience is stupid but Japanese devs think their audience are geniuses. Nor am I seeing this massive chasm in between an NPC explaining some game mechanics to you vs. the game pausing and being forced to read a text box for a couple minutes. Why is the latter inherently better designed? Obviously, I do think there are valid complaints about hand holding but I also don't think  there's Western then Eastern on their respective sides of the spectrum on this issue. I think there's handholdy Japanese games and there's vague, figure-it-out-yourself Western games. To me, it just feels like everything that isn't taking a specific and deliberate FromSoft approach gets lambasted as \"handholdy\", and *God forbid*, let that game be made by people that aren't Japanese.",

        "text": "More or less just don't get what the Riot wants or doesn't want, and I'll do my best to explain. \n\nI like MOBA. I've played Arena of Valor, ML:BB and currently play Wild Rift. My concern isn't exclusive to to Wild Rift but it's the only I currently play. More or less I don't understand the stance concerning chat and in game reports. \nLong story short I HATE ML:BB, and AOV is just sub par for the most part. However they respectively NAIL two things whereas Riot has a more beautiful and generally enjoyable game.\n\nIn AOV when inappropriate chat is detected the message that says something like \"thanks for playing you make playing the game great\" or something like that. In other words I'm tilted, NOONE ACTUALLY gets cursed out AND my teammates KNOW I'm pissed on account of the generic chat message that keeps popping up. In other words It works.\nOn another note ML:BB has MULTIPLE content available by lane and by champ available to watch in game OR on YouTube if you prefer, an actual in game warning for when damage received is outlandish that basically says something like\"please learn to dodge\" and LEGITIMATELY seemed to help IMO. RIOT on the other hand has made it clear that I'll NEVER know what the results of a report (limited to 200 characters) are, BUT (for example) will also slap me with a publicly viewable tag of \"leaver\" if I'm AFK for whatever the time they deem too much. For example, WIFI decided to reset one day so I was AFK for like five minutes once. I came back and the match was still going strong, but I'd already been penalized and it made known to EVERYONE DESPITE my team already knowing I'm disconnected. I don't think my complaint is out of context and considering that they're officially leaving to third parties to run any eSports action outside of Asia just don't get what they're ACTUALLY doing anymore. It's NOT enough to make me quit either as I don't REALLY care who runs the tourneys so long as there is potential for exposure and it's competitive, but I'm just not sure what to make of it anymore. Anyone's input or feedback is appreciated.\n🖖🏿🤓\n\nhttps://www.jaxon.gg/riots-league-of-legends-game-designer-gets-banned-for-feeding-in-normal-games/\n\nhttps://esportsinsider.com/2022/11/wild-rift-esports-goes-all-in-on-asia-halts-other-official-regional-tournaments-in-2023",

        "text": "Hello, this is just a random post containing some thoughts I just now had and I decided to post them here to maybe get some discussions going and see other people's opinions. I like discussing things. For some of you, it may be a pretty long read. But for the average person it should only take like ~30 seconds to read this post.\n\nSo, there are a lot of articles that will list a franchise's games from best to worst. And I see that a lot of people will ask if a new release is better than the last release. And some people will say the previous iterations are better than the newer iterations and vice versa.\n\nBut I am thinking, are the terms 'better' and 'worse' or 'good' and 'bad' the right terms to be using? What inspired this post was seeing people discussing the Age of Empires franchise. I saw someone say AoE4 is like AoE2 but without everything that made AoE2 good. I saw people say AoE3 is just bad and even denounced it as a real AoE game.\n\nBut I don't think the terms 'bad' and 'good' are being used correctly. Because (I never played AoE1) all three of these releases are good solid games that are well made and polished nicely. They are inherently good games. /But/ each one is variably different from each other. And I think that's where people are getting it wrong.\n\nA game being different from it's predecessor and/or successor doesn't make a game bad or good. There are people who will not like the changes and say the game is bad. But they aren't talking about the quality of the game. There is a difference between a game being good/bad and just not liking a game. \n\nFranchises cannot just release the exact same game over and over again. That's what remasters are for. Each S.T.A.L.K.E.R. release had the same foundation, but featured changes and different mechanics each time. And people will be looking at these different changes when saying whether one specific release is good or bad, they aren't looking at the quality or polish of the game.\n\nYou can say that a change is bad /for/ the game and that it will hurt the franchise. But the game itself is not bad because of those changes.\n\nI believe these are important distinctions to make when publically judging video games because people often use google to look up what people are saying about a game they are thinking of buying, and they will see people calling the game bad, but what that person really means is that they don't enjoy the changes made from the last release. And it would potentially discourage people, who might've actually enjoyed the game and the changes, from purchasing the game.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Is this something you have or haven't thought of before? Do you think it is a big deal or do you think it makes little difference? Do you think I am wrong in some way or do you agree? I'd love to hear all your opinions.\n\nPlease note that I welcome opinions that differ from my own and replies disagreeing with me. But lets be civil and have a nice polite discussion. If you think I am wrong or you disagree, let me know what you are thinking. I find it fun to discuss opinions with people online so I can't wait to see what some of you have to say, even if the topic itself isn't the best.",

        "text": "I've recently had a discussion with someone who has very similar opinions on a lot of general design topics, and after talking a bit about open world games ( which I, disclaimer, am usually not the biggest enjoyer of ), we started talking about mounts.   \n\nWe ended up talking about how mounts add and detract from open world games, but also games in general. One thing I couldn't struggle to get away from is the idea that having mounts in your game is kind of like implying that exploring on foot is a waste of time, and I would really rather have a world designed to be explored on foot.   \n\nOne negative example I distinctly remember coming up is the addition of mounts in Guild Wars 2's second expansion. Basically, the open zones of the first expansion were designed to be explored at a pedestrian pace, and had lots of obstacles geared towards that. They flowed very nicely with one exception and are still very fondly remembered by us.  \nThe second expansion added mounts - and to account for it, maps had to be massive, sprawling planes that couldn't really be traversed on foot due to a massive flux of enemies. In the end, I don't remember a single map from said expansion well. Additionally, the mounts completely warp the exploration in the base game.  \n\nI'm very interested in hearing some other perspectives on this, particularly from open world fans. What games do exploration with and without mounts best? Would you like a mountless open world game as well? How do you think a game designer should approach on-foot exploration and combat versus mounted exploration and combat?",

        "text": "Civ V was the first game I ever got on Steam (well, to be precise, I redeemed a retail code on Steam, and I had to set up an account to do that). Over the past 9 years, I've poured a couple hundred hours into it. I wouldn't say it's a perfect game, but it's definitely highly addictive and well-executed. I say that 7,5/10 or 8/10 would be a fair assessment.\n\nNow, I've just started playing Civ VI. Picked it up during the sale. Wanted to share my impression.\n\nNow, first things first, this is definitely a good game, and there are many things where it's a vast improvement over V. \n\nHOWEVER, I can't help but disagree with some elements of its design. I feel that while V was definitely way less complex, it had a certain... transparency VI may be lacking. On top of that, many ideas in VI seem kind of... style over substance?\n\nFor one, I feel like the game is a bit too short. On Standard, it's about 500 turns. I feel that's somewhat little. It seems to me like the victory conditions are somewhat unbalanced. Diplomatic appears to me to be WAY easier to achieve than any of the others. Just 20 points to win? That's almost nothing. Just build Apadana + Kilsa Kilwani and you are set.\n\nThere are many mechanics that seem interesting on paper, but in reality don't seem to be THAT impactful. As an example, climate change. Really, by the time you get factories, which produce greenhouse gasses... you are already going to be about 300-375 turns into the game (on Standard speed). Most games end up with either the player or the AI winning by about turn number 450. So we've got about 100 turns for the climate change to have an effect. It really doesn't seem to be terribly impactful. It seems like a cool detail, but doesn't seem to be hugely impactful. Kind of like in Civ V BNW, where we get to choose between the 3 ideologies during the industrial era. That also seemed cool, but had nowhere as much impact as one would expect.\n\nThere are so many things that just feel a bit underwhelming to me. Like, for instance, in V, the World Congress would only start gathering once one of the players had discovered all the other ones. In VI, that is not the case. Not only is it kind of weird we are doing diplomacy with countries we don't yet know, but in V, the moment of having discovered all the civilizations actually felt somewhat important because of that. Like you were enetering a new era of global politics. Not the case here.\n\nAgain, a really good game, and I din't regret getting it on a huge sale, BUT I can't help but feel like there are some things that are either unnecessary, redundant, don't feel relevant, or felt more impactful in V. Doesn't change he fact it's a REALLY GOOD AND ENJOYABLE game, mind you. Not bashing it.\n\nThoughts?\n\nEdit forgot to add. I dislike how the game seems to discourage what I believe is termed, \"playing tall\". In V, I always preferred a more compact, smaller empire with huge cities. It seems to be highly discouraged in this game.",

Also I love non-exclusives such as Elden Ring, Dark Souls Trilogy,Sekiro, Read Dead Redemption 2, Witcher 3 etc etc etc.\n\n\nI’ve been thinking about buying a switch recently. The first game I’d play is BOTW, then TOTK at release . Then maybe try out Skyward Sword, Majora’s Mask;, Ocarina of Time.  I understand switch has a lot more games than Zelda,but those would be the gateway into Nintendo world for me,especially BOTW . It’s not enough to simply “enjoy” or “like” the game if I’m to buy a brand new system for it.  I need to be in love with it. It needs to blow me away,like RDR2, GOW 2018, Bloodborne and Elden Ring did the first time I played them. But not neccesarly for the same reasons. \n\n\nWhy I would play BOTW: \n\nAs I understand,this is an open world game in the true sense of the word. You can go almost anywhere at any time ,there is a suge world filled with content to explore,doesn’t hold your hand,and there is more than one way to acomplish a task,therefore you form a more intimate connection with the world,unlike monotonous open world  games like RDR2 or TW3. \n\n\nWhy I wouldn’t play BOTW: \n\nI need a whole new system for that. No shade to the switch,but it’s not exactly a cheap console.\n\n\n\nSo I want to ask gamers,PS fans especially if they love BOTW as much or more as the best AAA games of this era. And if they would say if it’s a top 5 game ever. Thanks.",

        "text": "Hey Truegaming, it's that time again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA new AAA game has released and it's become the focal point of discussion to a nauseating degree.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo we've decided as a mod team to put a little stop on God of War: Ragnarok (GOW:R) posts. This comes down to multiple reasons. We, the mod team, are struggling to keep up with the amount posts we receiving and have noticed an increased level of fights taking place in the comment sections of the GOW:R focused posts. This in turn has lead to you, the community, not getting the experience you would expect from this subreddit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo we decided that something akin to what we did when Elden Ring released seems fit for use. It was well recieved and improved the subreddit during that time period.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll discussion of GOW:R as standalone posts will be required to be posted under this thread. You can still mention GOW:R in your other posts as long as it's not the sole focus of your post. (For example discussing the usage of third person camera's while mentioning GOW:R is fine whereas solely discussing GOW:R's third person camera is not ok.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe rules in these types of megathreads are slightly different from the usual rule's that we have for megathreads:\n\n* **Meme content is forbidden and will be removed by automod.**\n* **Our civility rules will be enforced strictly. Any personal insults will immediately result in at least a temp ban.**\n* **Our usual rules (DAE, reviews, list posts, game suggestions) are relaxed in here and won't be removed.**\n\nOutside of the megathread, GOW:R posts will keep getting removed. The mod team will discuss further megathreads in two week's time to see if they are still necessary. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you have any feedback for the megathread, please leave it under the pinned comment",

        "text": "Just finished it today. 100%. I feel like sharing and discussing my thoughts here about the combat. How do you guys feel about it?\n\nMy biggest gripe and point of discussion here is that they barely learned anything from the combat mistakes of the last game and even doubled down on those mistakes and made up new ones:\n\n- Resetting Kratos’ moveset and making him learn old moves again.\n- No pause combos for blades and spear.\n- Gutting hand to hand/shield combat.\n- Terrible camera\n- Ganks that abuse the camera\n- Projectiles that can come out of nowhere or track TOO well making dodging useless\n- Near useless attack indicator that only tells you that an attack has initiated not that it’s about to hit you making you dodge early and get hit on recovery.\n- Forward dodging has no iframes.\n- Enemies ignoring your attacks and hitting you back as you are hitting them even with runic attacks.\n- Attacks magnetizing towards you, making positioning pointless and useless.\n- No aerial options outside of the new death from above attacks.\n- Runic attacks usage being determined by a cooldown system instead of a replenishing resource in combat.\n- Unfair and unreactable attacks with certain side bosses.\n- Item/power level determining your and the enemy’s strength.\n- An emphasis on an action RPG design with filler stats, resources and loot over tight and expressive action combat.\n- Boring companion usage in combat.\n- Runic attacks not feeling powerful enough\n- Rage is more interesting now thanks to valor but it still feels underwhelming and undercooked.\n\nAm I being too harsh? Am I misguided in wanting an action game instead of an action RPG? \n\nThoughts?",

        "title": "What do you think about the way important events were portrayed in the new God of War Ragnarok?",
        "author": "DDM08",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/z11z1d/what_do_you_think_about_the_way_important_events/",
        "text": "TL;DR: Did this game made you feel satisfied with the events it tried to portray? I have my fair amount of criticism over some choices (even though some things were spetacular), and didn't felt it completed at all what it aimed for (all of my observations can be found in the spoiler marked paragraphs). I'm not asking if you liked the story, but instead if you really felt like it showed what you expected to see from the end of an era/mythology, and if you REALLY FELT they did all that could've been made and in the best quality that it was possible to be made, considering this is the very same studio behind the spiritual and empathetic journey of God of War 2018 and the epic an chaotic ending of titanic proportions in God of War 3. To me, it was really disappointing.\n\nLong text incoming, but as someone that bought a PS5 just for this game, since I just loved the 2018 one, I was really curious to know about the general opinion of the ending product and the way it's story was told. First, since the very moment they announced that ragnarok was going to happen in a single game, I was already with incredibly low expectations, cause I always had a huge doubt that they would've made justice to all of those events in only 20 hours or so, but still wanted to play it at launch.\n\nFirst I want to start saying about the INCREDIBLE few scenes I've seen recently, such as &gt;!the touching moment of Brok's blessing for Draupnir (THEY NAILED IT SO INCREDIBLY WELL HOW A BLACKSMITH WOULD BLESS A WEAPON)!&lt;, &gt;!the boss fight against the Bear in the first hours (incredibly shocking to discover he's in fact Atreus)!&lt;, &gt;!the Valkyrie fight revealing to be Freya (I loved Kratos stopping in the middle of the fight to call her name)!&lt;, &gt;!seeing Garm for the first time (seeing him sleeping in Helheim was BY FAR THE BEST PICTURE IN THE GAME)!&lt;, &gt;!ALL of Heimdall (the guy has almost the same craziness and perfect dialogue as Vaas in Far Cry 3, and fight like Wesker in Resident Evil 5!? HOW COOL IS THAT?)!&lt; and &gt;!the visit to the nourns (who wrote this absolute piece of art? That ABSOLUTELY PERFECT SCENE FROM START TO FINISH? I couldn't help but record that whole moment on my console immediately)!&lt;, but these ones definitely look like they were written or created by completely different people than the whole rest of the game, and it's sooooo strange to me... It also has some incredible boss fights. &gt;!Garm, first fight with Thor, Heimdall!&lt; (This last one is BY FAR THE BEST in my insignificant opinion, although some people apparently didn't liked it that much).\n\nI still have my immense share of respect for the devs, for trying to make the impossible and being so brave taking this HUGELY IMPORTANT decision, but it was really a poor choice in my opinion. Even with some perfect scenes, cause the game got sooooo much wrong in all the rest, to me... Even though I'm pretty sure they really made their best and are pretty happy with the result. However, and I don't want to be seen as a jerk for saying this, I would like to understand the comparison of quality of this story to the huge and special one we had in the previous game, and this is mainly because of the TONS of strange decisions and missed oportunities that happened during the whole adventure, in my insignificant opinion. And all of them, unfortunately, made the story feel quite like a whole mess (again, in my absolutely unimportant opinion)...\n\n&gt;!Freya's entire threat made after Kratos in her last dialogue in the end of the first game is solved just by a walk in Vanaheim alongside with her son's killer. And I definitely don't think that her questline, destroying past wedding gifts, should be the reason why she makes peace with her son's killer as well. As well as I don't agree at all that Kratos, the reserved and brute God of War, would truly consider \"destroying past wedding gifts\" one of her \"biggest battles yet\", as he says while ending the quest.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Surtr's whole epic story told as you explore Mulpelheim in the 2018 entry only results in the classic problem of \"the perfect coincidence\" that every writter should try their best to avoid, where he's just found at the exact right place and at the exact right time, as a bored and depressed man, located simply a few meters after you just casually get to muspelheim through one the portals, and Atreus is like \"Oh, father! Look! It's Surtr! Let's ask for his help!\" and he simply proceeds to do so. If he's that much of a menace and just doesn't care at all to anything anymore, why the incredibly intelligent Odin left him walking around there and just killed him or locked him up somewhere? Why he, the great force capable of destroying Asgard, isn't treated as such?!&lt;\n\n&gt;!The Search for Tyr takes around 10 hours of gameplay and doesn't feel like it adds anything at all after that, only an annoying and scared man that in the end is just a twist of Odin spying on their plans (which to me was quite the frustration, cause we spent the vast majority of the game looking for someone that never added anything at all, just an incredibly long mine mase in Svartfalheim). I do question, why make such a long road if it's reward doesn't matter in any way at all for the rest of the adventure? In the previous game we go to Alfheim at the beggining hours to be able to reach the top of the moutain, and even get a new mechanic to traverse areas that we weren't able. Here we don't get anything, just a level design easy to get lost in and a huge amount of slow traversals through claustrophobic passages, one after another. Also, someone had the strange idea to make the location of the real Tyr to be an optional objective. Not everyone completes side stuff, so how are they trying to explain for most of the audience that Tyr was just hanging out on an abbandoned prison in Niflheim all this time in a future entry? This is such a strange take for such a big point of the story from here on out...!&lt;\n\n&gt;!The hateful Odin, paranoid with propphecy, who hanged himself to get many powers and immense amount of knowledge, that destroyed so many lives in the first game and was such a menace for everyone... Here he's just like a business man the whole game that simply doesn't care for prophecy anymore and wants even more knowledge from a random rift, being now just obsessed over a random mask that also leads to absolute nothing again, as every other cliche revolving \"the answer to the reason of life and death\" always ends up in any kind of story, and it takes as much focus as the search for a futile Tyr that doesn't help in anything at all, almost costing another third of the game focusing on this theme.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Thor, the huge hateful barbarian that beat one of his sons almost to death just because he was a shame as a warrior in the first game, here is a loving father that suffers from the lost of both his sons. I understand that there's a dialogue that says he and Sif apparently became better parents, but making this simply happen in the backstage while forgeting that he himself almost killed his son for calling him a failure in protecting his brother? Which was also clearly mentioned as the favorite Thor's son, so much that he didn't cared at all to almost kill the other? I feel I didn't met the Odin and the Thor I heard so much in the previous game.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!And for some reason Odin is also suddenly portrayed as a humble being in some scenes, maybe because they intended for the player to feel bad when the time comes to see him dying in his boss fight (which was really generic, I must say) that has absolutely no cool interaction at all or any epic moment. Even a random unimportant grandma giant had more care over the fight against the All Father, in my opinion. Also, if Asgard was just a village for the sake of acting as an illusion, I would've understand, so to make Odin try to fool Atreus with his fake humbleness as he goes there for the first time. But making Heimdall even mention that Odin was as humble as to work on his own lodge with his bare hands? Why are they suddenly trying to make me feel pity of this guy after a whole game making me want to hunt him down for his crimes? This, to me, only proves that both the Thor that beat his son close to death and the psycopath Odin mentioned in the first game never existed in first place.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!And then we have the Iron Wood, which acted as a corridor, that (to me) takes way longer than it should and spent too much time with \"Come, I need to show you something\" over and over again, only to make Atreus accept the prophecy and death of his father, creating a big climax stating that it WILL occur while never again making we feel that Kratos is in danger, or even worse, simply denying all that huge talk of prophecy contained in that whole interaction.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!There's a strange inclusion of the whole mission where we're trying to get the moon back at the sky so that the wolves can once again hunt, cause when the sun and the moon are destroyed, ragnarok starts. But it never happens, cause Kratos don't want ragnarok or to follow prophecy, so the wolfs never destroy any of the two. But they still go for both things, willfully and intentionally following the prophecy that they're going to save the moon, and even managing to do so, it also didn't get destroyed (What? Why? Weren't they trying to avoid it after discovering the panels?). And even before the whole adventure of trying to recover it to the sky, it still adds nothing at all to the main quest. Instead, it feels just as a secondary one that unlocks a gimmick to traverse between a few places of Vanaheim and nothing more.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Then there's the misterious stuff that never appear in the game or answers we still don't have (The huge storm in the first game while Atreus is dying? Who called Jormungandr during that moment as well in the first game?). Some of the most strange ones in the sequel is Forseti, god of justice and son of Baldur, who is mentioned multiple times in Asgard, and it doesn't even have a face the whole game. Neither a voice. He literally doesn't exist. It's like he's too busy on his office trying to fix some paper work for Odin while his home is collapsing on fire. Why even mention him in the first place? Why not just delete him from history like the many other gods that could've also been interesting to show up in an important way in the game? Hræsvelgr, Skadi...? Way more than the giant grandma of Iron Wood. Or even any of the berserker fights, cause to me It's always a shame that focus on secondary activities must interfere in the quality of the main ones. Even more if you're trying to tell a story much bigger than the previous entry.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!And what happenned to Odin's eigth legged horse shown in many panels througout the first game? The very same horse that is even shown in the Alfheim panel contained in the sequel? Did they forgot they even had Mimir telling us about it in one of his stories? Did they prefered to include the whole Iron Wood section over a more interesting boss batle of maybe Odin with his legendary horse? The All Father? Probably the most anticipated boss of the entire game? His fight doesn't even match the Magni and Modi one, honestly. Or even Thor's fight right before it, which was also way less interesting than the first fight against him in the begginning hours of the game. I still can't understand how a kids race, root and fruit gathering and some fireflies in Iron Wood deserved more attention than the fight against the greatest god of Asgard.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!And what happened to the people that created the first glimpse we had at Helheim, Alfheim or Thamur's corpse in the first game? It's so strange to me that someone decided that the best direction to make the holy city and realm of the Aesir Gods to be just a big village just like the midgardian one just outside of it... Where are the people that created the incredible architecture of all of the previous God of War games? Including the 2018 one? It's so odd to me to see them creating the whole suspense of climbing that huge wall to just see a bigger village.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!And in the end I think we don't even have Ragnarok, while a ton of stuff \"simply happens\". The army of the dead and the elfs just accept to participate in a matter of minutes in the backstage of the ending hours. The World Serpent literally disappears in the blink of an eye to the past after the \"epic\" fight with Thor, which only looked like a cat trying to get a fly in the distance. Fenrir, who in the legends kills Odin and get's killed in the process, is just a cute puppy that jumps here and there through portals and nothing more. Also, he's shown in one of the trailers as appearing in the woods, one gigantic wolf in the middle of the snow. Does this scene exist in the game? I haven't seen it. Sif is again a victim of \"the perfect coincidence\", and appears exactly at the right time, in the exact right spot with the exact random boy that became a meaningless friend of Atreus (apparently, also in the backstage) to also forgive him in a matter of seconds for being responsible for the death of her two sons. What happened to the imagination and ideas that formed the fall of Olympus in God of War 3?!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I think they also tried too hard to create a literal copy of the previous one, since they forced too much some references of the previous game, like the eternally famous \"be better\", that was just a good well wirtten scene in 2018, while here it is treated as a whole theme repeated multiple times. Also, the dialogue is quite weak as well... And many jokes were incredibly strange and off putting. Like Atreus seeing a dam ans saying \"I'll be DAMned!\" or the strangiest boat interaction in the whole game, where he starts:!&lt;\n\n&gt;!\\- Hey, Mimir.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!\\- What, lad?!&lt;\n\n&gt;!\\- You talk funny. haha!!&lt;\n\n&gt;!\\- Well excuse me, lad!?!&lt;\n\n&gt;!End of interaction.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Like... What? What happenned here? Atreus already know Mimir for 2 years, considering the amount of time that passed since the past game, and even while he was a kid, and not a teenager, he didn't made such immature speech.!&lt;\n\nThere are more strange stuff, but I don't want to make this already long post even longer. Ironically, as I've mentioned, som scenes in this game are SOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOD! But calling this game a masterpiece for it's plot? Huh... It's all so strange to me...",

I recently started out playing New World and was immediately turned off by the dialog (It’s not bad but it’s just not what I enjoy games for). But then I read online that the story is kinda garbage and the game has a lot to offer in other ways.

I think the story of overcoming oneself is enhanced by the fact that the game itself is about getting better at it by dying countless times. In chapter 8, when there's a camera pan to the top of the mountain, it feels special in multiple ways because of what it means for the story and what it means for the players. \n\nAny other examples you can think of? \n\nThanks.",

        "text": " \n\nWhen i bought the game from Steam 2 years ago i finished it first on normal difficulty, then the second time on hard. I never bothered with survival until i started getting bored, like really bored. So a few tweaks and mods later i decided to turn on Survival mode and to say that my boredom was gone wold be the understatement of the century. Survival mode completely changes the way you play, to a downright fundamental level and makes the game all the more enjoyable for it.\n\nBullets and healing items have actual weight so you can't just stack infinite stimpaks and bullets for your favorite gun and you need to ration your supplies. And if you run out of ammo in a firefight? Well better pick up that shitty pipe pistol with 20 bullets you found on the corpse you just killed and pray to God that will be enough.\n\nThe damage both you and the enemies do is doubled, making almost every firefight you get in at the beginning ass clenchingly tense. You are actually forced to pick your battles and plan attacks, not just charge in guns blazing. Even by the endgame when you have great gear and supplies one unseen ghoul pile up and you're dead\n\nSETTLEMENTS ACTUALLY MATTER. This is bar none the biggest reason as to why i initially thought that Survival Mode was built into the game on launch day. It works seamlessly with the Settlement system. Being forced to have to eat, drink and sleep in order to live (in the case of sleep even to save) makes Settlement building and maintaining fucking CRUCIAL to you prolonged survival in this mode. Take it from someone who was absolutely not interested in that system in Normal mode who became an avid city builder when faced with the danger of \"Shit, i gotta make it to Red Rocket or i'm gonna starve to death\"\n\nHow Bethesda didn't include this mode initially is beyond me. It would've done so well for the initial ratings and scores for the game",

Because fore me the best part for Elden Ring were the fights and challenges, not the story.\n\nBecause at least for me that consisted of finishing an area and not knowing where to go looking up on Google and YouTube going back to game and rinse and repeat (of course maybe you can do all that without looking it up, but I don't have the time for that in my life I have things to do except gaming)\n\nTo me, the most enjoyable time I had was when I knew what I had to do and where I need to go to achieve my goal, not when I was running In a circle on glitter hove to find some annoying entrance to a cave or where my next mission was located\n\nNow by all means I'm not saying Elden Ring is a bad game, no quite the opposite it's an awesome game, most likely one of the best that ever came out. But does it really deserve the best narrative when competing to games like A plaque Tale: Requiem, GoW Ragnarok, Horizon Forbidden West and Immortality.",

        "text": "Finally finished god of war on medium difficulty, including all the favours in around 50 hours. Just wanted to share my thoughts on the game, since I've seen quite a few conflicting \nopinions here and there ranging from \"it's mid\" to \"it's game of the decade\".\n\nObvious spoilers ahead.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nThe gameplay hasn't really changed in its core mechanics at all from the first game. Arenas have more verticality and have better flow to them and you have a few more options to kill enemies such as interactables in the environment. But it's still very much the same as GOW 2018. You're still hacking and slashing away at enemies with the axe, blades and now a spear along with bow wielding companions. The spear is a welcome addition to the game, it doesn't feel like it gets overwhelmed by the other two weapons and stands out on its own. \n\nI'm probably sounding pretty negative so far, but all this said, the gameplay is still very very fun to play in my opinion. Sure it hasn't changed much from the first game, but that's because it didn't need to. All it had to do was improve what worked in the previous game and I believe they've accomplished that. Fights are sufficiently challenging and the power scaling during my playthrough felt almost perfect. Enemy variety, was a very big negative in 2018 and it's been ramped up here quite a bit.\n\nTraversal is probably the big downside of the gameplay in GOW:R. Wall climbing, crouching through holes etc, can be used to slow down the pace, but it does feel like they overuse it quite a bit in this game and in areas that could very well do without them. However, climbing has one positive and that's using the blades as a sort of grappling hook to waltz around the world with speed. This was a very welcome addition and certainly made traversal much more bearable and provided combat sections with much more speed and flow. \n\nCertain realms in the game are definitely much more expansive and filled with more stuff to do than the others. Mainly Vanaheim, Alfheim, Midgard and Svartalfheim. ESPECIALLY Vanaheim. Muspelheim works the same as it did in the previous game. Niflheim and Asgard are probably the biggest let downs in this game. Asgard does not look nearly as impressive as one would expect it to be. It looks more like a small midgardian village rather than a glamorous home for the Aesir. And niflheim is really nothing more than a storeroom for a couple of chests. But the other realms are far, far better with a lot more to do. Goes without saying all the realms (except Asgard) have extraordinary visuals and the art design and direction in each of them is magnificent.\n\nAtreus sections are actually fairly engaging, but I'm pretty sure these sections will be a chore to get through on reruns of the game as most of the sections are really meant to advance the story and develop the world even further rather than focusing on gameplay. That said, what little gameplay there is during these sections, is sufficiently engaging and is distinct enough from Kratos's moveset and skills enough to freshen up the gameplay loop every now and then.\n\nOverall, the gameplay is exactly what you'd expect. It's the same as GOW 2018 but bigger and more polished. If you enjoyed GOW 2018's gameplay, you're bound to enjoy the gameplay here. And I for one, very much enjoyed the it.\n\n\n\nSTORY:\n\nThe story in God Of War Ragnarok, is without doubt much more ambitious in scope when compared to its predecessor. More characters, more arcs, more relationships and in the end I think it's a great story for Kratos personally but on its own, not so much.\nI'll start with the negatives first. \n\nThe first negative is the direction. What I mean is that the story often feels like it doesn't have clear sense of direction or goal. Especially during the beginning of the game. In 2018 the goals felt very clear and straightforward. Here, the story seems to move haphazardly. At the start, Atreus suddenly feels the need to find Tyr and believes he's alive. Then when we free Tyr we need to go Alfheim to see one specific shrine of Groa? And then Atreus runs away and Kratos feels the need to visit the Norns. It feels disjointed and lacks the sort of clearness present in 2018. \n\nThe second negative is the entire story of \"The Mask\". We spend a sizeable chunk of the game with it going around and collecting pieces of it, but in the end Atreus shatters it. We don't even find out what it really was or where it came from or what it actually does. It's only purpose was to be a plot device. That's it.\n\nThe third negative is the final act of the story, the battle in Asgard. It felt very rushed and lacked the scale you would expect from an all out war between the realms. You find surtur and turn him into the monstrosity that destroys Asgard in literally no time. And within that time Freyr manages to unite the Elves who have been at war for DECADES out of nowhere. The dwarves, nor the midgardians show up, and Mimir and Hildisvini talk to Hraesvelgr off screen and convince her to help out.\nAnd during the war itself our main characters manage to find time to have heartfelt moments and to stand around and talk to eachother like they aren't standing right at the gates of Asgard in an all out assault. Sif and Skjoldr just happen to be right where Atreus and Thrud are so they can have a heartfelt moment too. Sif suddenly doesn't hate Atreus for killing her sons. Freyr's death was unbelievably sudden and undeserved we barely see much of him and half of the time we do see him he's either drunk or being quippy and casual and now suddenly he's having a big hero moment where he \"saves\" everyone, even though I'm pretty sure he could've just walked into the portal with everyone else too but whatever. The whole third act just felt like a mess and almost felt like I was watching something straight out of an Avengers movie or something.\n\nHowever I truly do believe that the personal story between Kratos and Atreus is really what sells this story despite its flaws. While the first game was about Kratos learning to open up to his son, the second game is all about letting go of him and coming to terms with the fact that Atreus doesn't need him as much anymore. They both bring out the best in eachother. Learning to trust his son and his judgment allows Kratos to abandon that part of that is constantly angry and distrustful and he becomes a better person for it. By opening his heart to his son, he also learns to open his heart to the world, to all people the way Atreus does. The moments between them genuinely made me tear up sometimes, especially the ending, where Kratos finds out that salvation is possible, that maybe it is possible to finally put his past behind him and create a new legacy, a legacy of peace.\n\nKratos and Atreus aren't the only highlights, Freya is also a powerhouse throughout the game. Danielle Bisutti nails her character and delivers a marvelous performance and portrays Freya's grief and trauma realistically. Her overcoming her hatred of Odin and the trauma he caused her both personally and by assaulting her people is gut wrenchingly powerful.\n\nEven side characters like Brok, Mimir, Sindri have their own moments of weakness and vulnerability, but together everyone helps eachother overcome their issues in one way or another. And the story does all this without feeling like it's juggling too many character arcs at once which is commendable.\n\nLastly, Thor, Odin and Heimdall are definitely among some of my favourites in the game. Especially Thor. Ryan Hurst's performance as Thor is simply supreme. Thor manages to steal the show in almost every scene he's in and his very presence is a sight to behold. Odin's scheming and ultimate betrayal as Tyr was a big shock and looking back on it, the twist didn't come out of nowhere, the signs were there all along.\n\nOverall, the positives in my opinion are just too good in this game that they kinda overshadow the negatives. But the negatives definitely do stick out and can be a sort of thorn in an otherwise heartfelt story.\n\nIf I had to rate the game I'd probably give it 8/10.\nOverall, great game. And I enjoyed it thoroughly.\n\nDo you guys agree? Let me know in the comments, I would love to hear everyone's thoughts.",

        "text": "Just this generation, we've have gotten many announcements/releases of old and classic games. While I'm not personally against remaking video games, I think a question that many people ought to ask themselves when demanding a remake of a video game is what about it should actually be remade. I personally feel that a lot of the games that have gotten remade over the years still hold up quite well, sometimes to the point that I wonder what about it needed to be remade in the first place. \n\nSome might say the graphics, but let's be honest, does the retro graphical quality of a game really bother you that much? Is it the one defining factor that makes a game good? Not to me at least. People still like and play Undertale despite the fact that it looks like it originally came out on the NES, is that game that needs a remake? I don't think so.\n\nFor me, the only remakes I'm looking forward to are that of games I haven't even played, Dead Space and Lollipop Chainsaw to name a few, and that's only because I no longer own the platforms those games were originally released on. I can't say the same for something like Resident Evil 4 because I own the original on current hardware and it still looks fine and plays just fine, even more so now that the HD texture project for the PC version is now fully done and released, already making it look miles better than the various remastered versions of it that came before and on par with the RE Engine games.\n\nEven if you make the argument that we need remakes to replace the original, like what REmake 1 did for RE1, why do you want the original replaced to begin with? I mean, in the case of REmake 1, yea it's a great remake, but it only got remade because the director of the original wasn't satisfied with how the original game turned out, not because fans demanded it, even though the original game still looks good and plays just about the same as the remake. Some people even prefer the original over the remake, they're few, but they exist.\n\nHere's the thing that I think a lot of gamers demanding remakes of their favorite games don't understand; Remaking a game solely to replace the original overshadows that original game's legacy. When people think of Resident Evil 1 being the pioneer of the survival horror genre, are they going to think of the original or the remake that has the prettier graphics and more content? \n\nThe same can be asked about Resident Evil 4 and how the original revolutionized the third person shooter genre when the remake eventually overtakes it many years down the line. It's like having a younger sibling who's more popular than you are simply because they look better, taking all the glory and reward for the hard work you did, and eventually you become forgotten despite that without you, they wouldn't have that luxery in the first place.\n\nEven though I said I'm not against remakes, I would say that I'm against or at least apprehensive of remakes of games that don't really need to be remade, the only exception being if they're no longer accessible on modern hardware for some reason. In fact, why are we just remaking the good games? Why don't we remake bad games into good games? Take Devil May Cry 2 as an example, that game could very well benefit from a remake, keeping the story and characters primarily the same while fixing the combat and level design which was by far the worst aspect of DMC2.",

        "text": "_SETUP_\n\nI read that Facebook language model had been taken down. They were having trouble with the language model producing accurate results but the results were close enough to the truth that some people might not notice. It got me thinking about bot difficulty in video games. \n\nI greatly prefer to play multiplayer games over single player experiences. I've found in shooting games that use bots tend to have a M.E.T.A. (most efficient tactics available) strategy programmed into them. \n\nI'll use Gears of War for this example, I've seen bots who were facing the other way have bullets fired from their gun shoot directly out through their back and all hit me. The bots would only shoot when they were going to hit too. It's frustrating to play when even humans can't move like that.\n\n_BIG THINK_\n\nI think if AIs could \"learn\" what human players do in a match and then follow the best, mediocre and worst players as models for the AI, that would add so much to campaigns. Multiplayer often seems vastly different from single players experience. I hope this would align them more.\n\nThey could even use the AI smartness in other games.  Ex. \"This game uses the ViperX AI\" so the players know what to expect (realistic bots based on humans who have played that specific game) \n\nThis would be huge in racing games (kinda reminds me of Speed chasing his brothers ghost on the course from Speedracer) \n\nLet me know what you think of this idea. I've been thinking on it for a while too because I feel the AI models of bots is not scary and it really could be enough of a selling feature if done right. If different games keep using and building up a model (ex. ViperX) that could be really fun\n\n_COOL PART_\n\nThis also creates the ability for players to buy or build their own AI or ghost profile that watches them and learns what you do based on different circumstances the game throws at you. \n \nAssuming that machine learning comes with a cost the player has paid, then you could rent out your own personal ghost profile when you are not playing. By having it watch you it's now learned what you would normally do. Could even be 15% user, 85% ViperX. The profiles that are more learned from the user are more to rent or something. \n\nThis would be great because I could fill a multiplayer match with all bots who play based on player learning (like my favorite streamers or my bro who isn't online)",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/yzucp8/honest_question_do_you_feel_satisfied_with_how/",
        "text": "TL;DR: Did this game made you feel satisfied with the events it tried to portray? I have my fair amount of a quite bitter criticism, I must reckon, over some choices, and didn't felt it completed at all what it aimed for (some of my criticisms can be found in the spoiler marked paragraphs). I'm not asking if you liked the story, but instead if you really felt like it showed what you expected to see from the end of an era/mythology, and if you REALLY FELT they did all that could've been made and in the best quality that it was possible to be made.\n\nLong text incoming, but as someone that bought a PS5 just for this game, since I just loved the 2018 one, I was really curious to know about the general opinion of the ending product and the way it's story was told. First, since the very moment they announced that ragnarok was going to happen in a single game, I was already with incredibly low expectations, cause I always had a huge doubt that they would've made justice to all of those events in only 20 hours or so, but still wanted to play it at launch.\n\nI still have my share of respect for the devs, for trying to make the impossible and being so brave taking this HUGE decision, but it was really a poor choice in my opinion, even though I'm sure they really made their best and are pretty happy with the result. However, and I don't want to be a jerk for saying this, I can't comprehend how anyone can compare the quality of this story to the huge and special one we had in the previous game, and this is mainly because of the tons of strange decisions and missed oportunities that happened during the whole adventure, in my insignificant opinion.\n\n&gt;!Freya's entire threat made after Kratos in her last dialogue in the end of the first game is solved just by a walk in Vanaheim alongside with her son's killer. And I definitely don't think that her questline, destroying past wedding gifts, should be the reason why she makes peace with her son's killer as well.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Surtr's whole epic story told as you explore Mulpelheim in the 2018 entry only results in the classic problem of \"the perfect coincidence\", where he is just found at the EXACT right place and at the EXACT right time, as a bored and depressed hippie located simply a few meters after you just casually get to muspelheim through one the portals, and Atreus is like \"Oh, father! Look! It's Surtr! Let's ask for an autograph!\".!&lt;\n\n&gt;!The Search for Tyr takes around 10 hours of gameplay and doesn't add anything at all after that, only an annoying and scared man that in the end is just a twist of Odin spying on their plans (which to me was quite the frustration, cause we spent the vast majority of the game looking for someone that never added anything at all). Why make such a long road if it's reward doesn't matter in any way at all for the rest of the adventure? Also, who had the brilliant idea to make the real Tyr be an optional objective? Not everyone completes side stuff, so how are they trying to explain for most of the audience that Tyr was just hanging out on a abbandoned prison in Niflheim all this time in a future entry? This is such a strange take for such a big point of the story from here on out...!&lt;\n\n&gt;!The hateful Odin, paranoid with propphecy, who hanged himself to get many powers and IMMENSE KNOWLEDGE, that destroyed so many lives in the first game and was such a menace for everyone... Here he's just a business man the whole game that simply doesn't care for prophecy anymore and wants EVEN MORE knowledge from a random rift, being now just obsessed over a random mask that also leads to absolute NOTHING, as every other cliche revolving \"the answer to the reason of life and death\" always ends up in any kind of story, and it takes as much focus as the search for the futile Tyr that just cooks in the treehouse.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!And for some reason Odin's also suddenly portrayed as a humble being in some scenes, cause the player apparently needs to feel bad when the time comes to see him dying in that generic boss fight that has absolutely no cool interaction at all (Even a random grandma giant had more care over the fight against the All Father). Also, seriously, if that village that they decided to call \"Asgard\" was only an illusion, I would've understand, so to make Odin try to fool Atreus with his fake humbleness as he goes there for the first time. But making Heimdall even mention that Odin was as humble as to work on his own lodge with his bare hands? Why are they suddenly trying to make me feel pity of this guy after a whole game making me want to hunt him down for his crimes?!&lt;\n\n&gt;!And then we have fillers like the Iron Wood corridor, that takes waaaaaay longer than it should and spent too much time with \"Come, I need to show you something\" for the tenth time. Or when we're trying to get the moon back at the sky so that the wolves can once again hunt, cause when the sun and the moon are destroyed, ragnarok starts. But guess what? It never happens, cause Kratos don't want ragnarok or to follow prophecy, so the wolfs never destroy any of the two. But they still go for both things, willfully and intentionally following the prophecy that they're going to save the moon (What? Why? Weren't they trying to avoid it after discovering the panels?). And even before the whole adventure of trying to recover it to the sky, it STILL NEVER ADDS NOTHING AT ALL to the main quest. Instead, it feels just as a secondary one that unlocks a gimmick to traverse a few places of Vanaheim.!&lt;\n\nAnd then there's the misterious stuff that never appear in the game or answers we still don't have. &gt;!Some of the most strange ones is Forseti, god of justice and son of Baldur, who is mentioned multiple times in Asgard, and it doesn't even have a face the whole game. Neither a voice. He literally doesn't exist. It's like he's too busy on his office trying to fix some paper work for CEOdin while his home is collapsing on fire. Why even mention him in the first place? Why not just delete him from history like the many other gods that could've also been interesting to show up in an important way in the game?  Hræsvelgr, Skadi...?   Way more than the giant grandma of Iron Wood. Or even any of the berserker fights, cause to me It's always a shame that focus on secondary activities must interfere in the quality of the main ones... !&lt;\n\n&gt;!And what happenned to Odin's eigth legged horse shown in many panels througout the first game? Did he decided to donate it for the well being of the kids of the great and humble village of Asgard? The very same horse is even shown in the Alfheim panel contained in the sequel! Did they forgot they even had Mimir telling us about it in one of his stories? Did they prefered to include the whole Iron Wood section over a more interesting boss batle of, I dont know, Odin with his legendary horse? The All Father? Most anticipated boss of the entire game? Which it's fight doesn't even match the Magni and Modi one? Or even Thor's fight right before it? Which was also way less interesting than the first fight against him in the begginning hours of the game? I still can't understand how a race, root and fruit gathering and some fireflies in Iron Wood deserved more attention than the greatest god of Asgard.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!And what happened to the people that created the first glimpse we had at Helheim, Alfheim or Thamur's corpse in the first game? Who decided that the best direction to make the holy city and realm of the Aesir Gods to be just A BIG VILLAGE SIMILAR TO THE NEW MIDGARDIAN ONE RIGHT OUTSIDE OF IT?? Where are the people that created the incredible architecture of ALL of the previous God of War games? Including the 2018 one?? Was it really a good idea to create the whole suspense of climbing that HUGE WALL to just see a bigger village? I definitely wasn't satisfied by it.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!And in the end we don't even have Ragnarok, while a ton of stuff \"simply happens\". The army of the dead and the elfs just goes \"War? Sounds fun!\" in a matter of minutes in the backstage of the ending hours. The World Serpent goes \"PUFF\" to the past after the \"epic\" fight with Thor, which only looked like a cat trying to get a fly in the distance. Fenrir, who in the legends kills Odin by removing his arm and get's killed in the process, is just a cute puppy that jumps here and there through portals and nothing more. Sif is again a victim of \"the perfect coincidence\", and appears EXACTLY at the right time, in the EXACT right spot with THE EXACT RANDOM BOY THAT BECAME ATREUS MEANINGLESS FRIEND to, guess what? Also forgive Atreus in seconds for being responsible for the death of her two sons. What happened to the imagination and ideas that formed the fall of Olympus in God of War 3?!&lt;\n\nThere are more stuff, but I don't want to make this already long post even longer. Ironically, this game also has some of the most incredible scenes I've seen recently, such as&gt;! the Brok's blessing for Draupnir, boss fight against the Bear in the first hours, the Valkyrie fight revealing to be Freya, seeing Garm for the first time and the visit to the nourns!&lt;, but these ones definitely look like they were written or created by completely different people than the whole rest of the team. It also has some incredible boss fights. &gt;!Garm, first fight with Thor, Heimdall!&lt; (This last one is BY FAR THE BEST in my insignificant opinion).   But the plot? Huh... I don't intend to be rude, but at least, Marvel fans may be happy, I guess, since fast conclusions and grand encounters minimized by a few squares distance are alright to many of them...\n\nI may expect too much from a U$70,00 game, I don't know, but I definitely didn't felt satisfied at all with this game. I don't even care for the next entry after all this strange takes and I'm even afraid for the next sony games, if they now decide to try similar concepts from here on out, considering the extremely strange praise this one appears to be getting, in my opinion... The combat at least wast pretty fun to me, so I can't say that I threw money away. But I still can't understand how people say this game is as good or even better than the previous one.\n\nSorry for the rant, cause it was definitely not my intention to make it sound like one, but man... I expected a little of \"God of War Ragnarok\", but instead I feel I've gotten \"God of War Be Better\", because I can guarantee anyone that ends up playing this, you'll hear a lot of this famous quote of the 2018 entry. Cause why not? Players loved to meme it since then, after all... Let's try to force as many references as we can of the 2018 game then, since we can't repeat the same magic as that one now... This was how it felt to me, at least...\n\nAgain, it's just my insignificant opinion, and I'm sure the devs made their best for this game, but they failed real hard to me (besides general gameplay slightly improved, some of the bosses and incredible technical aspects). At least they're getting praise and are happy with this, and I had my share of 50 hours of cool fights...\n\nBut anyway... Was it really a Ragnarok for you? Did you felt satisfied by the answers, important boss fights, epic scenes and places you saw? Do you really think this game is on par or better than the previous one? Do you really think this was the best they could have done? I'm genuinely intrigued by all of this. Also, sorry for any mistakes, but english isn't my native language.",

        "text": "Something that terribly annoys me with rouge-like games that more and more, they're incredibly in-depth mechanics wise and require a massive time investment while also not having any sort of saving/loading feature. This is fine in a game like FTL where a run lasts an hour, a hour and a half at most, but in manys games that amount of time isn't even enough to max out a skill or complete an end-game objective (Be it missions of story lines.). Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead, Project Zomboid, Caves of Qud (You can techically enable saving/loading in dev options but that, for some reason, disables achievements.), I could go on but my point isn't to shame any specific game but talk about this awful trend. \n\nFor example, in Project Zomboid, just leveling up any one skill to level 10 is going to take anything from hours to days depending on what skill it is, and even that is assuming you min-max the mechanics to max out your skills. The developers have also talked about extending this grind even futher in the upcoming updates, yet for some reason saving and loading is a firm 'no' from the developers (Funny enough, on the ''List of common suggestions'' post they have on their forums sex is on the same rejection level as saving and loading). Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead is even worse with this, saves can reasonable go on for weeks with things like mutations and end-game threats being wholly different than anything you'd see in the early game, yet once again you can't save the game at any point. In all these examples, death is the end of that save.\n\nSee, at one hand it does add a level of danger to the game, where every death is truly death, but in the other hand I just put three weeks into a Project Zomboid run and died to a bug and it's fucking gone. I'm a regular person who works a regular job and that means my free time is not infinite, and at this point I flat out don't touch any games where you're meant to commit to a save for a long period of time but you also can't take back any mistakes you've made. As great as that game might be, I'm going to die at some point and weeks of my free time is just going to go ''poof'' and disappear into nothing. These games seem to me to be fundementally incompatible with the idea of a rouge-like game. In FTL, I can get through a run or two in just two hours. In Caves of Qud, two hours doesn't even get me half-way into the story-line of the game.",

        "text": "I haven't been interested in a game in a long time but there's a switch game that just recently came to PC and I saw it was going for $70 which is insane for a card game. What's even worse is that they're trying to push \"Featuring ranked fight!\" but the game is already niche enough japan let alone america. \n\nThe game has a small cult like following, but I don't think its big enough to charge $70 for. If anything it feels like its going to scare potential new players away with the price tag. Even free to play models don't charge that much for starter decks.",

Not that I'm a fan of any recent Nintendo games)\n\nSo I won't repackage any arguments about the decline of gaming. But goddammit, I've been so depressed about it for so long. I think in my mind, I associate it with a perceived social decline overall.",

        "text": "There were about a handful of devs who complained about mandatory Series S for xbox releases. The news a bit old now and went to bakburner but I would like to share some thoughts and grt your opinions as well.\n\nIf you went through the story the basic gist is Series S underpowered ( Mostly the limited shared RAM) system and holding the gaming from theusing the best of the powerful hardware. Microsoft naturally maintains the requirement since there are more XSS being sold than XSX. Yes there is possible to dev to do PS5 only release but considering the latest console market split  is about 60/40 and XSS more than 20% total it is big hit to exclude xbox.\n\nIn my mind MS should keep the requirement so that they dont alienate more than half new xbox consumerbase with limited library.\n\nI understand extra device will require more effort from dev and therefore bigger cost. However it is actually good that they go through the effort. Not only this exercise will help them reach larger PC market, the game will be designed better since they have to look for optimization, find bad codes and clean them up prior to release. Considering how many AAA and of couse indie games come out poorly optimized I think this barrier could be net benefit to all gaming consumers including PS5 owners.",

Who is this for ?\n\nThen there are times where I can't even interact with the game, it's like you're in a cutscene but they require player input so you can't even walk outside a small zone outside of it due to literal invisible walls forcing , you in a direction literally being rail roaded to the point where it may as well just be a cutscene because you're forced in a direction.\n\nOther times it's like the game cannot cope with a player spending more than 30 seconds after encountering a puzzle without the game just blurting out the solution. Most of these puzzles are so easy they may as well not exist or they shouldn't even be considered puzzles. I mean I'm literally looking or encountering what's clearly a puzzle to try and figure out what I'm even trying to accomplish and an npc will just scream out of nowhere , TRY THIS (INSERT EXACT PUZZLE SOLUTION)\n\nI've seen alot of complaints about AAA western game design trends when dark souls first came out people really praised the game treating you like an adult and letting you figure out things on your own. Things like witcher senses in witcher 3 where you're just following red trails instead of thinking.\n\nI've noticed more and more AAA games that simply tell what to do and practically slap your hand if you don't do exactly what's required for example rdr2 where it feels like you're playing a movie and following a script. The desire for this big budget games seems to really be affecting their game design in a negative way.\n\nSeriously this gow is a massive step up in narrative and combat, enemy variety, boss fights etc but its woeful interms of what western game design is nowadays.Sometimes it's like I'm being backseated by the game itself. Just shut up, damn.\n\ngreat game unironically.",

        "text": "Recently I have been playing a selection of story heavy games with big \"decision\" moments where you are tasked with making a decision that theoretically impacts the future in big ways. When you play through the game for the first time these decisions usually stick the landing and you feel your choice was important, and the consequences of it are just. The story feels shaped to your decision and the experience becomes truly immersive. There are certainly a spectrum of success rates across gaming but I think you'll understand what I'm talking about.\n\nHowever, most games with such moments on a second playthrough, or a curious search after the fact reveal that your choices had little to no consequence at all. Characters involved in the decision may simply not show up in later games or scenes, even if it seems obvious they should be there. People just don't mention someone who had a chance to die anymore, and many times characters involved in decisions that would lead to dire consequences are simply left on the sidelines. Consequences of your actions mostly would have happened whatever you had picked also.\n\nSo my question isn't asking about the technical viability of these choice based games and how there should be more potential outcomes - because we know thats far too much work. My question is:\n\n**How do you feel about a games story that you feel you've dictated upon learning about the full breadth of options that were available?\n**\nDoes learning you had less power than you thought spoil the experience for you?\n\nDoes the fact the game endeavours to tell the same compelling story whatever you choose make the game itself more admirable as it tells the tale it wanted to tell? Or does the fact the player has little impact make the game side of things moot?\n\nWhat are your experiences with branching path games?",

        "text": "This post is kinda related to a recent post, in wich the poster asked why optional enemy’s are often more difficult than non optional ones.\n\nIn this post a lot of people already answered with the most used argument to this question, wich is: \n“You want everyone to be able to complete the main story”. I think this is generally a good argument but why do easier difficulty’s exist, if the developers made sure that everybody is able to finish the game? \n\nGoWR’s story bosses are drastically easier than its optional ones and I think the  result is a weaker narrative. In GoWR we fight Gods and all kinds of powerful creatures and yet, gameplay wise, a draugr from a draugr hole is more danger to Kratos than a god. \n\nThe game hypes some of the gods up as extremely powerful beings, but the only time we get to see that is in cutscenes. This approach works but is so much weaker than showing me their power in gameplay. Telling me that these gods are the some of the most powerful beings in all off the realms doesn’t really work, if every realm has multiple enemy’s that are way tougher.\n\nI think this approach also weakens the quality of the main bosses. In theory the last boss should be the most epic and rewarding fight, but in pursuit of the highest completion rate, most of the “should be epic boss fights “ are pushovers.\n\nAm I alone in thinking this? Normally this doesn’t really bother me but in GoW it does, because you are fighting literal gods.",

It's great fun.\n\nOf course we were super excited to get into the latest game which is about the H.H. Holmes murder castle, which is super interesting already\n\nUnfortunately the game is an absolute mess.\n\nThe biggest problem is the characters tend to look around at things, making their heads completely spin around like they're possessed. This is especially bad when trying to use a flashlight because the flashlight aims where the character is looking. This problem on its own almost makes the game unplayable when you're exploring in a dark scary house.\n\nThen there's a bunch of little issues that just show a lack of polish. The description of a photo says the people in the photo are kissing but they're clearly not.\n\nThen theres tons of random visual glitches. Like peoples gums sometimes show in front of their teeth, a character will suddenly be wearing a hat when they weren't just seconds before. We even had one character with their dslr camera attached to the back of their head, or floating in mid-air.\n\nHopefully this stuff gets patched because the previous games were fairly solid and bug free. This is just super disappointing\n\nWe're playing on PS5. Not sure how it is on other platforms.",
