If yes to either of these questions, did you interpret Marianne's rape and the fallout as fairly realistic for a WASP American family at that time?\n\nOne thing we keep coming back to in my book club is, how was this story received at the time of publication? What did it mean to people at that time? What cultural &amp; sociopolitical contexts were the author writing in, and responding to?\n\nThis story explores attitudes about rape and sexual assault in a small United States town in the 1970s. It exposed deep cognitive dissonances about family and religion and love, etc. One thing we were remarking on as mostly areligious millennial-aged people is that this incident might have played out very differently in our day, even in the early 00's. That is, I think in many regions there would've been a bit more support for Marianne both in her family and the community, and the degree of neurosis in this story was sort of alien to us. The result for me was that, while it was a powerful story about a broken family and a rape victim, the messaging was just preaching to the choir and it felt masochistic reading it. I was young in the '90s but my impression is that even people then were pretty hip to consent and they might've felt like I do now when reading this book. If word got out about something like this in my hometown there would've been way more public backlash. But then again we didn't live through the 60s and 70s, and maybe it's books like this that normalized rape victim advocacy for my generation.",

I was 7 or 8 then and I don't remember much about it but, I very much like to find and read it now. It was written about the aftermath of a war with Martians in which they won and invaded Earth. (I already checked \"War of the Worlds\" by Wells but its not the one I'm looking for.) From what I recall the book had a male protogonist accompanied by a woman(I'm not sure) in the part I read. Protogonist was a \"spaceman\"(I am not sure of this wording because I read a translated version to my language which is Turkish.) who fought in the war. He was returning home in the first few pages then I think martians went after him(also not sure) and then he was on the run. The book was taking place at US which I am sure of beacause I clearly remember of a place they were going for as \"Duluth\" which I googled to find that it is in US. It was not a long book, my guess is around 250 pages. \n\nI would really appriciate if you could help me out I am really curious about this book.\n\nNote: I can translate back the name of the book as I recall to \"Space Wars\" but I'm very certain this is wrong because, firstly I googled every combination of this name I can think of in both Turkish and English but nothing close to what I remember came up and secondly, they translate some names very weirdly to Turkish because of marketing reasons.",

For example, one of the options could be the way measurements are shown. So, someone like me who is from a metric-using country could choose metric and all of the measurements in the book which are previously marked down with something like a special XML tag would automatically be converted to metric.\n\nOther things like automatically hiding content that some people are sensitive to, playing recommended songs for different parts of the book, etc. could be there as well.\n\nI know it sounds like blasphemy to some people, but modernizing things doesn't sound like a bad idea to me.",

The repetitiveness just kills me... Does it get better? I'm currently at chapter 823 now and am wondering if it's worth it to continue.\n\n\nBonus qn: does he only end up with Xie Huilan at the end? I don't mind spoilers... But if it's her I'll be quite disapointed tbh, Even if he only ended up with one partner, I would prefer that, er, \"special\" mayor over Huilan as her actions and words are pretty funny.\n\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "Oh my God, I just completed reading TBJ and I must say, why? Why? Why is her humour exquisitely underrated?? I have heard so much about how tragic and disturbing the book was, but honestly, not a single tragic tear did I shed. Her diction, the simplicity, and her humour, God, her humour had me rolling! The finger-bowl incident, her account about the gentleman who eats salad with his fingers, tears ‚Äúflying‚Äù out her eyes, her description of Lenny‚Äôs short friend, Esther‚Äôs mischievous chemistry class contrivance leading the professors to appreciate her ‚Äúintellectual maturity‚Äù. Even in the middle of her somber spell of psychosis she didn‚Äôt spare the opportunity to throw in a character by the name Doctor Pancreas, lmao. God, I love this woman.\n\nI did not find the book a tat bit disturbing.  It was rather adventurous. She made me feel as frustrated as her. There was a point where I began rooting for her to succeed in her attempts to kill herself. The mother was the problem. Always saving her someway or the other. Confound her! If there was a way the book could‚Äôve had a tragic turn, then it was Betsy who should have been found hanging on the tree not Joan. Joan was too marginal a character to have evoked any sense of loss. But Betsy, oh darling Betsy. Her irreplaceable puking partner.  This is why I miss Shakespeare. Elaborately constructing protagonists with such finesse and swiftly killing them without a second thought for the beauty of tragedy! Truly my type of man, if you‚Äôd ask me. But I think I know exactly why she killed Joan instead: I‚Äôd be damned if it‚Äôs not for the mere sake of Buddy‚Äôs double entendre ‚ÄúIs there something about me which drives women crazy?‚Äù Which she thought was rather clever. \n\nThe reason why the book was not disturbing for me was because she didn‚Äôt seem afflicted at all, only terribly misunderstood. She always seemed to have a logical explanation for behaving the way she did, and rather, it was the people around her that needed the shock therapy. I could only commiserate and extend my fullest support to her so that she may flourish in her desperate endeavours, be it killing herself or losing her virginity.\n\nI must admit though, there was one incident at the beach which really gave me the polar chills. The one where they were burning steak and when her friends were not looking, she quickly buried them in the sand. That was the only time a got a true glimpse of the psycho she was.\n\nI‚Äôll rate the book 7/10.",

They were supposed to be sending undiscovered books that fit in with the genres I chose. But some of what they sent me was just trash - like the screenplay of Annihilation, tacky crime thrillers - the kind of books that weren't so much 'undiscovered' as just rejected by the general public. And their customer service was shite. I liked that I could link my goodreads so I wouldn't get sent books I already read though. \n\nAll I really want is a few books a month that I don't have to choose. Every box I look at is more like here's ONE book and a few other products to fit with a theme - I don't want to pay ¬£20 a month for  little sachets of hot chocolate or bath products or wine or whatever and ONE book. So I'm hoping someone has a recommendation for the kind of service I'm looking for.\n\nHonestly it seems like this is such a gap in the market - I'm surprised publishers aren't doing subscription boxes of their own new publications.",

The main character is this dude, and at some point in the story this remote appears, and it can pause time, fast forward, go back...etc. Essentially the remote works on time just like it works on a television. \n\nThere was some sort of competition, and his, maybe?, archnemesis/ the antagonist is also in it. The competition is to eat some sort of food, I think it was like spaghetti and meatballs. And the winner was who could eat the most the most in a certain amount of time OR had a certain amount to eat, and the archnemesis dude knew about the remote, or they'd been fighting over this remote. So at some point in the book the other guy gets hold of the remote and uses it on the main character to fastforward. Here, he describes the pain of force feeding himself while not being in control. He could also have a sister. I'm really sorry for being so vague but it's literally all I can remember about this book. \n\nIf anyone could help, thanks a lot :)",

Multiple instances of missing quotation marks when the chapter is starting with dialogue. The prose is just as overwritten as usual. Piper uses 97 words when she could use 5. It comes off just as pretentious and melodramatic as it did in the last book. Everything is so over the top that I constantly rolled my eyes. She misuses words all the time and has ridiculous metaphors that you have to reread 2 or 3 times just to make sense of. Basically, everything is as convoluted as it possible could be. Maybe some of ya‚Äôll like this, but objectively this is not good writing. Sorry, not sorry.   \n\n\n**plot/characters**  \nSo at the end of book one, Amaris and Gadriel escape from a battle arena on the back of a dragon, HP style and then jump off its back and conveniently land right next to this magic academy. The book ends, and one would assume that the sequel will lead to Amaris going to the academy and learning to hone her magic. If you thought that, then you would be WRONG.   \n\n\nSo we start exactly where we left off with little to no recapping of what happened in the last book. You're expected to remember, but it's hard considering how many unnecessary words are jammed between what little plot is actually in these books. They get taken to the magic school, and everyone thinks Gadriel is a demon, and they want to cage and study him. In some supremely dramatic and ridiculous monologuing, Amaris convinces the masters of the school that he's harmless. Amaris convinces herself Gadriel(now Gad) is her new best friend, but when Gadriel says, 'we fought together in Aubade' in response to being asked ', what does this woman mean to you?' she loses her MIND. She gets so assblasted mad because she thought they were friends, but APPARENTLY NOT. It's pathetic and ridiculous, and like Amaris is so naive and has no idea how the real world works at all. She cannot conceive why Gadriel won't share secrets he was sworn to keep with her even after he explains it could mean his life. Like how is Amaris supposed to be likeable lol?? Because Gadriel said they weren‚Äôt friends, and Amaris took that shit personally. Then he blames her for his shredded wings, and as usual, Amaris can‚Äôt take responsibility, much like her author counterpart. And this becomes a recurring thing in the book. Amaris stays butthurt nearly 500 pages in all because Gadriel said that she was ‚Äòsomeone he fought together with‚Äô. Literally the entire book is them hot and cold with one another and it's exhausting. Neither of them are likable at all.   \n\n\nThey look at some books at the academy for two seconds, find zero answers and guess that this tower of magic has everything they need. And conveniently, *it does*. They climb 10,000 steps and find the hall of prophecies from the order of the phoenix (you know, the room full of shelves with glowing blue orbs well, this room also has shelves with glowing blue orbs, but the shelves are spiral-shaped, so it‚Äôs not plagiarism, guys.) otherwise known as the hall of orbs, and Amaris realizes the floor is invisible and there's an illusion cast over it. Gadriel goes to step over it, and instead of warning him like a normal person, Amaris screams wordlessly. That's it. Then she starts berating him for not paying attention to his surroundings, even though she should know by now that she can see illusions, but Amaris is too stupid to figure this out. After all, she's been aware of her powers for three years and only just started questioning their limitations and capabilities. She is literally an idiot. Gadriel asks Amaris if he can make the jump. She reads WAY too much into this question and thinks, \"oh my god, Gadriel is putting his LIFE in my HANDS. He TRUSTS me.\" And I'm like...bitch; you're the only one who can see the distance. Are you for real rn? Anyway, he makes the jump, and Amaris cries in relief. Literally cries. Imagine if Indiana Jones cried in relief every time he solved a booby trap puzzle while searching tombs. He would look like an idiot. Amaris has a full-blown panic attack, considers leaving and becoming a seamstress and then jumps, doesn't make it, and almost dies, and then Gadriel saves her. They touch some magical glowing blue balls, get sucked into a pensieve(I mean orb), and see some curses/blessings where faeries explode into golden dust. They meet the oldest man ever, who happens to show them the exact thing they needed to see, then get tossed from the Tardis Tower. (it‚Äôs bigger on the inside)  \n\n\nGadriel gets some conveniently 'manufactured' wings and can now fly again(literally has no lasting ill effects of having his wings literally shredded), and then they realize they've learned everything they needed to know and leave. (WHAT? YOU HAVE LEARNED LITERALLY NOTHING) They try to convince Amaris to stay, and she pretends like she's going to and then leaves at night, but it's the most dramatic thing ever. She tries to write it like it's something worthy of ballads, but there is no good reason why it would be. They didn't even *do* anything there. And that's it. That's all that happens with Amaris' magical boarding school plot, and that's when I realized how much of a waste of time this bullshit book is. You had a whole ass magical boarding school, and you didn't use it at all?? You could've had Amaris attend school, actually learn some things since she is the biggest idiot ever and then solve a whole mystery of how the school is corrupt and experimenting on people with unique magic while also searching for the answers to the curse. But no, Amaris learns about her powers in a different way, and WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT IN A MOMENT.   \n\n\nThere‚Äôs a line I want to point out that I found hilariously ironic, and Piper(and Amaris) should take her own fucking advice. *‚Äù Ignorance is no one‚Äôs fault, but once you‚Äôre made aware of your lack, the choice to remain oblivious is when you become culpable.‚Äù* So, if this is true, then why didn‚Äôt Amaris take advantage of the magic school so that she could not be ignorant about her abilities? Why does she continue to be ignorant of how she speaks with Gadriel by calling him terms she knows are offensive and racist? If this is true, why wouldn‚Äôt Piper fix what people have pointed in her book out as being racist, ableist and plagiarized. Why wouldn‚Äôt she do the work so she can not be an ignoramus? Hmmmm...  \n\n\nNow, the way that Amaris chooses to learn to wield her power is she ‚Äòverbally consents‚Äô to allow Gadriel to help train her. This book has a warning for consensual breathplay, but once again, Piper is full of shit and a liar. Saying, ‚Äúyes, I would like you to train me to use my magic‚Äù, does not equate to ‚ÄúI consent to you strangling me in my sleep.‚Äù Yep, you read that right. Gadriel waits until Amaris is deep asleep, stands over her in a position that will ensure she can‚Äôt fight him off and strangles her until she explodes with sonic power(much like Ciri's power from the show....god, the plagiarism just will not stop.) And when she gets upset, he berates her for not using their safe word (snowbird). Tell me, how the fuck was she going to use a safe bird when you are cutting off her airway? How is she going to speak, let alone breathe? He says that he‚Äôs doing what any general would do for his troops, but in what fucking universe does a general strangle their troops in their sleep? This is not consensual breathplay, Piper, and if you think it is, then you need to reevaluate yourself and look up the definition of the word consent.   \n\n\nNow on to Nox. Nox has been honestly just as irrelevant in this book as she was in the last book. She‚Äôs hanging out with Malik and Ash and has become a sudden Yes Man, and after literally a week hanging out with them, she decides she loves Malik. Are you fucking kidding me? This honestly makes me mad because Nox was coded as a lesbian. I don‚Äôt give a fuck if Piper says she‚Äôs bisexual. She wrote about her being repulsed by men, preferring women‚Äôs company. She literally says she doesn‚Äôt like men and prefers women, but because Piper really wanted to write some hetero smut, she forced her to be bisexual? Stupid af. Not to mention her obsession with Amaris. Has she suddenly forgotten about that all because one guy was nice to her? That‚Äôs pathetic. Stand your fuckin ground, Nox. Having her fall for Malik in this is a bad call because it nullifies the fact that she fought her way free from having to fuck men against her will just to get to the woman she loves, only to immediately fall for a guy for literally no reason. Malik doesn‚Äôt do anything to deserve being called ‚Äòpure‚Äô because he is literally no better than a sexy lamp at this point. If she had taken the time to actually cultivate a relationship here where Nox slowly learns to trust Malik, that would be a completely different story. But Piper was too eager to jump in and write smut.   \n\n\nI also think it‚Äôs a strange choice to make your ‚Äòdark fae‚Äô(which, according to Gadriel, is a racist term that has been used very freely throughout the entire book) have their powers associated with ‚Äònightlife‚Äô and then make them all dubious POC. She even made their country's flag ‚Äòbronze for the skin of its people‚Äô. That is a supremely weird thing to do. Nox literally says she is good at being sneaky because of her dark fae blood, which is also what makes her ‚Äòbronze‚Äô. Gadriel, who is also dubiously brown, is good at picking locks. Like‚Ä¶Piper‚Ä¶.what the fuck are you doing???? Stop being RACIST!!!???  \n\n\nEverything that happens in this book is pure convenience. Nox and Amaris constantly stumble upon the answers. There is no motivation; there is no urgency. Nox dallies most of the time at the Duke of Henares' house, eating a malum malus she got from the tree of life(which is called Yggdrasil because Piper can't make up original concepts, apparently, and has to steal from everything else). She sees the tree‚Äôs memories and watches this princess pray to the All-Mother for protection for her *son*. Then we find out that the priestess, who is only ever referred to as the Tarkhany woman with ‚Äòonyx skin‚Äô, was blessed by the All Mother with immaculate conception and guess who the baby was? You guessed it. Amaris. The super white snowflake was immaculately conceived by a woman with very dark skin(because Piper has a really weird obsession with the contrast of dark and light skin, I guess). This is what they say to the nameless priestess(who actually dies earlier in this book in a very throwaway scene) when she asks if she gets to raise the child she just birthed. *‚ÄùThe child belongs to everyone and no one, beloved‚Ä¶.This babe is the manifestation o the prayers of the faithful.‚Äù* So not only is Amaris literally the purest PERFECT SNOWFLAKE ON EARTH BECAUSE SHE IS A MANIFESTATION OF A PRAYER(in other words, Jesus), but a nameless black woman was used and killed off for no other purpose than to be her vessel.   \n\n\nWe later discover that Nox's pen pal from the Chamber of Secrets, aka Tom Riddle, was actually the Gray Matron all along! She gets Nox to travel *all* the way back to the orphanage and tells her the truth(even though she had a literal magic quill she could've used to save everyone some time). Ya'll are gonna love this. Turns out that Princess Daphne, Queen Moirai's daughter, had a child with King Ceres from Raascot(the dark fae king dude). Daphne was apparently already married, and so to hide her child from this nameless husband, she goes to this CHILD MILL, leaves her daughter there and asks for a baby(specifically a boy) with similar coloring to her baby's. Then she leaves Nox there with the Grey Matron and brings the boy back with her and the boy immediately gets murdered because the nameless husband knows it's not his. This has left me with so many questions.  \n\n\na) how did the orphanage/child mill have a baby of Nox's exact coloring when in TNAIM, we're told that Nox is a novelty and people of her complexion are never sold at the orphanage? She is literally put on display as a trophy *because*of her skin tone. So how did they manage to have a baby to exchange conveniently? (also, wow, way to callously kill some nameless child, Piper.)   \nb) how did no one realize Daphne had a baby girl? were there no midwives when she gave birth? this is medieval times; I highly doubt she gave birth alone because there's a huge chance of her dying. So how is it not a single soul outside of the nameless priestess and Agnes knew that Daphne actually had a girl? When Daphne went to the temple to pray for help, she asks for help specifically for her *son*. Why would she ask for help for a son she does not have? I know Piper was trying to trick us or whatever, but...that's just bad writing? Do you think the All-Mother is gonna realize you're actually talking about your hidden daughter, Daphne?   \nc)why, if Agnes never intended for Nox to be sold, did she allow Millicent to take her to the brothel? She says she didn't know how to deny her without spilling the beans, so she just....lets Nox be taken? In what world does that make sense? If she's supposed to protect Nox why did she let Nox think it was Amaris who needed to be protected? Why would she allow Nox to put herself in harm's way to protect Amaris? Why would she allow Nox to be whipped? Why would they constantly talk about Amaris being perfect and unmarred if it was truly Nox who was the important one and they knew it all along? None of this makes sense.   \n\n\nNox was named Nox, so she wouldn't forget the north. Fucking kill me. Well, she clearly knew nothing about it, so.   \n\n\nAmaris tells Gadriel that she got turned on when he choked her nonconsensually, so then he chokes her consensually(even though she freaked out when he choked her and this could easily trigger her into another panic attack, but okay.). She blows him, and he finger bangs her while choking her but won't take her virginity because it should be gentler the first time. First of all, you cannot tell me that Amaris still has her 'maidenhood' when she's been riding horses all this time. Piper doesn't know shit about horseback riding, though, and that's obvious. Second of all, I am convinced Piper has a secret incest kink. Why do you ask?   \n\n\nWell, Nox and Amaris were written as sisters, but now they're apparently star-crossed lovers? (yet they're boning random men along their journey to find one another. Makes sense.) Nox and Amaris are actually 100% based on Yennefer and Ciri from the Witcher, which is a mother/daughter relationship(Piper can say this book has nothing to do with the Witcher all she likes, she literally dedicated to this book to Henry Cavill as Geralt. We're not idiots.). Amaris calls her fellow reevers her 'brothers' and then tries to fuck one of them. And now she has a daddy kink with Gadriel(proven by the fact that Piper continuously calls him Dadriel.)   \n\n\nDon‚Äôt give your money to Piper CJ.   \n\n\ncurrently reading  \n\n\nThis is what happens when you write a book in 9 days and don‚Äôt accept constructive criticism. You get sentences like this.   \n\n\n‚ÄúShe knew she was about to watch the head of a man as it was gnawed from where it connected to his shoulders.‚Äù  \n\n\nThe whole book is like this. How did this pass the beta reading process?? This is not ready for publication.   \n\n\npre-review  \n\n\nya'll remember that time that Piper said that TNAIM wasn't even inspired by the witcher and then she went ahead and dedicated this book to Henry Cavill as Geralt? Yeah, me too.",

Without going into details and always according to Chuck's peculiar fantastic style, Caucasia and Gaysia immediately devolve into desperate and total shitshows, much like you would expect from such an absurdly tribal and silly identitarian segregation. Blacktopia on the other hand emerges as this literal utopic state filled with poets, artists and technological advancements that are borderline magic. \n\nThis total U-turn feels so out of place narratively and ethically story-wise.

Out of pure morbid curiosity, I'm going to attempt to read all of the \"V.C.

I can understand finishing the books she didn't live to complete (or even finishing the one series she was in the middle of), but continuing it beyond that just feels so excessive, and the only reason I can really understand for Andrew Neiderman continuing to do that is for the money.\nFlowers in the Attic, despite it's obvious problems in the plot and relatively sub-par writing, is a gripping and addictive story. I'm about 100 pages in (it's a re-read on this one) and it's got me just as committed as it did the first time... but I just don't think it's good enough material to justify hiring a ghostwriter to write 80+ books over 30+ years bearing her name.\nMaybe I'm just rambling, and maybe I'm the only person out there who thinks this is simultaneously odd and unwarranted, but I wanted to get it out there somewhere.",

        "text": "I just finished reading The Alchemist, by Paulo Coelho. I picked it up because it got rave reviews, but also because I read the title and thought it'd be a fun fantasy adventure with magic. While there is some magic, it mostly takes a backseat to the main character's journey in search of treasure at the Pyramids of Egypt.\n\nNow the story is good, no complaints there. It's definitely positive and uplifting. If you want something encouraging to read, I recommend it.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for a story with magic, I'd look elsewhere. Maybe it's just me, but when I think of alchemy, I picture drinking potions to turn invisible to hurling a vial at someone to set them on fire. When the main character finally gets his big chance to cast a spell (turning into the wind), he asks the sand, wind, and sun for help. Now I've read a few books on witchcraft, and none of the spells have in their instructions, 'Ask the wind.' The worst part? When he finally succeeds, it happens virtually off-screen, with another character making an off-hand comment about it. If you're doing all that build-up, at least show the character succeeding, describe him feeling like his body is lifting up into the sky, he can't feel his fingers, or something like that. Don't write several pages of his searching for the means to cast the spell and then just have someone say, \"He turned into the wind. It was amazing! you should've seen it!\"\n\nOnce again, my views on this book are based mostly on my expectations, hoping for a fun fantasy adventure. And again, I recommend this book as a well-written spiritual journey that makes the reader feel better afterwards. But I'm sure other fantasy adventures with magic exist that are far better than this. \n\nPeople describe this book as encouraging. But if anything, it only encourages me to try and write my only story about an alchemist, one with actual potions and magic.",

        "text": "Hi everyone! A couple of days I finished A little life (late to the party, I know). Of course, it is no surprise that it haunts you with a numb and melancholic feeling. I was wondering, those who read it, and maybe even reread it, would you recommend rereading it? I felt that it might give me a different perspective than the first time reading it, but I‚Äôm not sure since it will a) do what I just said it might give me or b) it will make me even more ‚Äòemptier‚Äô?\n\nI‚Äôd love to know your opinion on this subject who are familiar with it , and maybe letting me know how you found your way to fade it‚Äôs heavy 720-story? \n\nThanks! :)",

It‚Äôs been nostalgic and surprisingly engaging to revisit these books as an adult, and there have been many happy moments where I found the author wrote subsequent books that I‚Äôd missed growing up.\n\nWhat were some of your favorite books or series from your pre/teen years? Anything you reread as an adult and saw in a new way? \n\nSo far in this nostalgia kick I‚Äôve re-read series like Percy Jackson, Molly Moon, Gregor the Overlander, Septimus Heap, Princess Academy, Artemis Fowl, and everything I could find from Eva Ibbotson.",

For example, Lost Paradise by Milton is considered the bees knees right? Well‚Ä¶I‚Äôm not seeing that right now because of mental handicap. I even had the bright idea to write a poem myself in hopes of getting the rhythm to click and that‚Äôs working about as well as you‚Äôd expect if you‚Äôve so happened to read this far down.",

        "text": "I've recently been really interested in Orwell and wanted to expand my reading around him. I've read 1984 and Animal Farm, and have now been trying to buy a book of his essays - but have really been struggling since he wrote many, and I am not sure which book has the best selection. \n\nI'm currently looking at Essays by George Orwell, which has the orange and yellow blocked cover. However, I don't believe it has 'Why I write', or 'Politics and the English Language', which I'd love to read. In fact, the only copies of 'Why I write' have all been published separately, in different books!\n\nIf anyone has any insight on which book (or books - he has so many essays and I don't mind buying several) has his best essays, I'd really appreciate it. \n\n(Also, if anyone can figure out how to find out what the table of content is for a lot of these books, that would also be appreciated - I'm definitely having a hard time because I have no idea which specific essays all these books contain!)",
