        "text": "I started my journey into using Linux almost full-time 14 months ago.  I started with Mint Cinnamon and became acquainted with it quickly.  By month 4 I was pretty bored with it.  So I looked up other similar distros (I found out Mint was just Ubuntu) So I went with Ubuntu and stuck with it to the most recent 22.04LTS It's nice and all for my laptop.  To me, it just makes sense for that Distro to be on my laptop visually speaking, but it doesn't fit well on my desktop with the top bar staying there permanently.  So that is how it's been Ubuntu on Laptop and Mint on the Desktop.  \n\nUntil very recently when I saw posts with people talking about KDE and what I thought was a misspelling of Ubuntu. That piqued my interest and I started studying Kubuntu. \nI was very happy to know that it was Debian Based since I am very familiar with it.  So I downloaded the ISO and installed it, did manual so it only overwrites the Mint partition (I made quite a few mistakes while installing Mint the first time lol.) \n\nOkay, so it's all installed and running properly.  I set it up and customized it to my preferences which was fantastic as I can keep going if I want, but it was time to reset my machine and finalize everything.  Theen comes to the problem.  It only booted Kubuntu and I thought okay, that's abnormal, maybe it's just a quirk.  So to be sure I finished the setup and installed restricted extras.  I reset once more feeling pretty happy.  Everything ramps up, monitors turn on, keyboard turns purple annnd Kubuntu...  No grub.\n\nAhhh F-  okay..  okay, Let's see if my windows partition is still Okay.  Gparted up and shows Windows efi and all drives are functioning, populated and is all healthy.  OKAY! Good my projects(Game and Drawings)  are safe I don't have to fall back to my recovery drive and lose 2 months of work.\nSo I restarted and pressed UEFI button for the boot loader, Mint is gone but ubuntu is in its place.  Not a problem I switched the order for windows to be first just to make extra sure that my files are okay (They all were. And I uploaded them to my external)  But why wasn't Grub showing up? Well, this was new so I went straight to searching if others had the same problem instead of asking in forums.  Turns out it was indeed a common issue with distro hopping.  So I followed the explanation and then found the Debian based terminal commands for it, not Arch lol. It took me 2 tries to get it right from just text format instead of video tutorial.\n\nI did it! Obviously with help from the community, but I did it! \nI fixed Grub and I have a Distro that I may actually love and see myself using for a very long time. \n\nIf you read this all the way through, Thank you so much for your time and I certainly do hope to experience more of what Linux has to offer even the perceived bad ones.",

        "text": "In the first part of the series we have talked generally about what are namespace and what we can do with them - in case you want to go over it you can use the following link [https://medium.com/@boutnaru/linux-namespaces-part-1-dcee9c40fb68](https://medium.com/@boutnaru/linux-namespaces-part-1-dcee9c40fb68). Now we are going to deep dive into the network namespaces.\n\nFirst, in order for the kernel to support network namespaces we need to compile the kernel with “CONFIG\\_NET\\_NS” enabled. Overall, network namespaces can separate/isolate/segregate between the different system resources which are associated with networking under Linux. Among those resources are: firewall rules, routing tables (IP), IPv4 and IPv6 protocol stacks, sockets, different directories related to the networking subsystem (like: “/proc/\\[PID\\]/net”, “/proc/sys/net”, “/sys/class/net” and more), etc ([https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/network\\_namespaces.7.html](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/network_namespaces.7.html)).\n\nBy the way, unix domain sockets are also isolated using network namespaces (“man 7 unix”). It is important to understand that a physical network device can exist in one network namespace at a time (singleton). In case the last process in a network namespace returns/exits, Linux frees the namespace which moves the physical network device to the initial network namespace.\n\nMoreover, in case we want to create a bridge to a network device which is part of a different namespace we can use a virtual network device. It can create tunnels between network namespaces ([https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/veth.4.html](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/veth.4.html)). \n\nLastly, you can see an example of creating a network namespace in the screenshot below. As you can see an iptables rule is created but it is not relevant to the newly created network namespace. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cnlwgvnint5a1.png?width=494&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=420319c307cdd71f132c82ee3af25dfb91764213",

This will completely lock-up the dm-crypt device until queue clears.\n\n\nTo disable the work queues you can set the dm-crypt device flags with the following command\n\n\n    cryptsetup --perf-no_read_workqueue --perf-no_write_workqueue --persistent refresh cryptdevice\n\n\nWhere cryptdevice is the name of the opened dm-crypt device.\n\n\n`linux-zen` kernel should have the workqueues disabled by default but I have not verified that.",
