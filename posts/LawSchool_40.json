Someone commented that when they transferred to Harvard, 30% of the transfers came from other T14s. I was pretty surprised when I read that, because if you have the ability to transfer to HLS, you must be at the absolute top of your class. Is the boost in career outcomes really worth transferring to HLS, giving up a scholarship, and risking being at or below median instead of top of your class at a T14 (I’m genuinely asking, not implying that I think it’s odd). I know people always mention “unicorn outcomes” or whatever, like SCOTUS or academic etc, but I highly doubt that the majority of transfers are doing it for these niche outcomes. Aren’t they just gonna get the same BL job they would have gotten regardless?",

I have to finish my 1L year with a cumulative 2.0 (so basically have to swing a 3.3 in the spring) or else I fail out of my school. \n\nI struggled tremendously with a trio of ADHD, depression &amp; anxiety throughout first semester which made it really hard to stay afloat during school. I’d been diagnosed with these things on two occasions before (once in 2014 and again in 2017) but I thought I had gotten through it. Starting law school exacerbated these things in ways I didn’t expect. I have a plan in place now to do regular counseling sessions, and I’m speaking with medical professionals about medication for my ADHD &amp; depression. This plus now I’ll be working with my school’s academic success office to help me get on track too. \n\nI believe all of this will put me in position to manage the grind of law school much better and I’m hopeful my grades will reflect this. \n\nNonetheless, I still feel incredibly ashamed, sad, frustrated, and disappointed about where I’m currently at. Has anyone been through this before? Were you able to bounce back? What worked for you? Are there other things I could or should do to help me turn things around? Am I doomed? Is it unrealistic to expect to improve my grades so drastically? \n\nAny and all advice or words of encouragement would be appreciated.",

Should I apply for a judicial internship? Apply directly to firms in my area who do this kind of work? Or Is the over all bar of these specific practice areas super high and I shouldn’t aim for them because of my gpa? What does the route look like? \n\nIf you need important info to give advice \n\nMy Grades: Average at best, did well in torts but my rank is below median and has never been above.

I always have been really good at studying languages, writing etc. but my math skills are embarrassing to talk about. \n\nI studied a bit of law during high school in Europe where I am from. I always grasped the concepts quickly but since I lack logical reasoning due to my math deficiency, I was never really able to apply what I have learned and completely created a chaos when solving a case. \n\nSo I wondered how important are the writing skills in the US law system in comparison to the logical/math skills? I would like to complete law school in the US and the system seems to be completely different. Do you maybe have experience with ADD/ADHD in law school and could let me know if you can still succeed?",

It started 2 days ago, and frankly, I just don’t feel well enough to compete. The case packet is about 110 pages long and I still haven’t gotten through it yet. The competition ends early next week, but I have to send in a “grade release” form by tomorrow night to the editor in chief. \n\nI’m leaning towards just not doing journal anymore. I am already taking 16 credits next semester, (thinking about dropping a 2 credit class though), I feel like I won’t be able to effectively be part of journal with all my doctor appointments and lack of energy. \n\nWould it be appropriate to email the editor in chief saying that I am withdrawing from the competition? Or would that just be weird? Should I just wait for the deadline to pass? We’re allowed to email the editor in chief about any questions we have about the write on competition, so it won’t be breaking any rules. Thank you for all of your help!",

I'm trying to re-apply to law schools and attend law school in August 2023. \n\nAny advice/tips would be greatly appreciated. If anyone is familiar with ABA law schools that accept a dismissed student, please share this information with me because my online search was not successful. \n\nI will appreciate it if someone with the same experience as mine guides me because I feel alone in my journey.

My GPA is mediocre (will likely be about a  3.6 when I graduate), but I suspect I’ll do very well in the LSAT since the format plays to all of my autistic strengths and I’ve gotten literally every practice LSAT question I’ve seen right. I’m strongly considering UAlbany for its closeness to my support network, and because one of my friends recently got a full ride there and seems to really enjoy it. From a cursory look at the sub it seems like people tend to discourage anybody from attending anything but a top law school, and that attending a regional school essentially prevents you from scoring major lucrative jobs. I have no interest in working in corporate law or for the state, as I am a committed socialist, but I would like to make enough to pay off my loans and lead a decent middle class life (no desire to have kids). My ultimate goal is to work for a nonprofit and use my law degree to advocate for marginalized and people, although I would also be open to working in a private criminal defense practice if necessary. \n\nMy question is this: how big of an obstacle will attending a small regional law school like Ualbany be to finding a decent job that fits those parameters?",

So, I am just curious if I should be bidding broadly to every open position and taking what I can get, or if I can be more selective in applying to only paid positions that interest me, which would cut the pool by about 50%-60%. \n\nIf anyone is willing to share any of their insight or experience with OCI, I would greatly appreciate it!",

At my law school, it looks like my 2.929 GPA puts me around top 50%, probably even slightly below.  I worry that my problem is one that can't be fixed.  I'm just not built for the speed that law school exams demand.  I didn't come close to finishing any of them.  I'm a strong writer, but I'm not a fast writer.  I have an extremely hard time leaving a typo or poorly written sentence alone.  I compulsively edit as I write.  I tell myself to stop, that I can always come back to it at the end; 10 seconds later, I'm doing it again.  You can imagine how that comes back to bite me on time-constrained exams.  I'm open to strategic suggestions from others who have overcome similar hurdles, but I have a hard time envisioning future exams going any other way for me.\n\nThe frustrating thing is that this style of writing served me very well as a paralegal for the last two years.  I did tons of writing for two employers from whom I always received very positive feedback.  Both were very adamant that I attend law school.\n\nWhat does this mean for my employment prospects?  Will my writing ability be enough to draw attention away from my poor exam performance?  Would some version of the explanation I just provided be encouraging to you as an employer, or would you just assume that too slow for law school exams = unproductive in the office?",

This was literally my first semester of law school &amp; I had a traumatic injury which resulted in 4 jaw fractures landing me in the hospital for a week, followed by complication after complication &amp; a dozen of appointments. I missed a bit over the 20% of allotted absences as a result, but I guess it wasn’t an issue given the circumstances. Not only was it physically draining, but it was emotionally draining as well. I lost motor nerve function in half of my face for 3 months, which was never an anticipated complication from the surgery. I just feel at a loss because I know that I would have done better if I wasn’t put at such a disadvantage. I can’t be mad at myself because the injury was not my fault. I was literally on my way back from class when it happened. I’m honestly just sad because I anticipate it really holding me back with internships and whatnot. Obviously, If I do better subsequent semesters, I can explain this semester away. But not sure if that matters when I’m just another # to someone. My only recourse is potentially getting the school to notate the extraneous circumstances on my transcript which I know they did at my undergrad university. Not sure if there are ABA policies on this. Anyway, it was a horrible 1st semester, so I can only hope for no injuries the 2nd time around.",

The subtopic me and my grouppartner were assigned to is \"judicial activism and minimalism\".\n\nI hope this is the right place to ask this question, I don't need exact laws or anything but rather what you guys think about following questions;\n\nBasically I watched a YouTube Video from Harvard law school where some experts talked about the case. One thing that was brought up is the fact that people rely on the Supreme Court (judicative branch) way too much rather than the other branches, thus giving them more power. Would you guys think that this is true? Is that even possible, that one branch can gain more power? \n\nand also; I'm really not sure how voting in all the states work. When overturning a stare decisis decision, is it not possible for the people anymore to raise their voice and concerns to the congress? How does the legislative exactly make their decisions when making new laws? \n\nI'm also open to discussions about judicial minimalism v. activism. What are your political views and opinions about this?",

        "text": "So I’m a 1L that struggled hardcore with mental health stuff in my first semester. I got 2 new diagnoses on top of the severe depression I was already dealing with. So many times, I questioned whether I needed to take myself to the ER because I didn’t know if I could keep myself safe (which wouldn’t have at all been the first time I needed to do that in my life). I was often up at odd hours just trying to keep myself alive and safe. I had a mindset during the semester that, even if I got straight Cs, I’d be so happy and proud that I survived and stayed enrolled. And I feel like that’s still true. I am proud that I’m still standing, even when I thought I was down for good. But I just got a C- in contracts, which puts me in the bottom 10%. C- isn’t even in my school’s distribution requirement - 10% get C+ or C and everything below is considered part of that 10%|\n\nI’m in an incredibly privileged position that I’ve had my Summer job lined up for a while so I’m not worried about that. I think what I’m upset about is that the sacrifice doesn’t feel worth it the way I thought it would be. Law school is not the first time I’ve faced severe mental health challenges but I was consistently an A student in spite of it. It felt like I could justify the struggle even when people saw what I was doing and thought it was a bad idea. And now I’m staring at my first semester grades, knowing that I avoided being sent to a psych facility by the skin of my teeth, and I feel defeated.\n\nI had therapy this week and even my therapist had me explain why I felt like withdrawing was a worse idea than staying enrolled. The biggest factor is that I’m in student housing, which I would lose the second I withdraw. I have no savings, about $20,000 of debt, and no plan B. I have nowhere to go. This has to work. I don’t have a choice. But I am struggling so much. Even at home over winter break, I’ve been struggling intensely with mental health stuff. I go back to campus for semester 2 and it feels like a terrible idea and I feel like I’m setting myself up for catastrophic failure. But what is there left to do? If I lose my housing, then what? \n\nI’m committed to fighting. I would rather not. I’m beyond exhausted. I feel defeated. I feel alone. But I also feel like the only choice is to keep going. I just don’t know if I know how to do that.",

I got a D in Civ procedure (96%) of the class got a D or D- in that class. Either way im happy not academically dismissed and didn't fail any classes. Im just upset about these grades cause im trying to transfer. Hopefully this semester is better though...🙏",

        "text": "I just found out I was academically dismissed from law school after one semester. I went to a predatory school, and law school really wasn't for me anyway, so I'm glad to be leaving before wasting any more time and money. I'm now looking into getting a master's degree. Will I need to disclose the fact that I went to law school on applications? Will my low law school gpa hurt me?",
