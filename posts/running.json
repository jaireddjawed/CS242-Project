It lets the mods group posts into Collections.  We're giving it a try on posts that get good feedback that would be useful for future users.  We've setup some common topic Collections and will add new posts to these as they arise as well as start new Collections as needed.  Here's the link to the wiki with a list of the current Collections.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/wiki\/faq\/collections\/\n\nPlease note, Collections only works for New Reddit and the Reddit mobile app for iOS.\n\n\n\n__________\n\n###**Using r\/running**\n\n\n\nThe mods do their best to actively moderate this community. When posting, we expect users to make an effort to familiarize themselves with our rules and practices before submitting posts or comments. We suggest taking note of **Rule 2** *and* **Rule 7**, *since these are the most commonly broken which will result in a thread being removed.*\n\nThe mod team has tried to lay out the rules with some expected guidelines of what is or is not allowed, but there is always some gray area and posts are up to interpretation by the mod team.  We do our best to be consistent, but that isn\u2019t always the case with multiple mods or even the same mod between similar posts.  The mod team wants to make \/r\/running a resource for new and experienced runners and to build a community between all types of runners.\n\nRegardless of that fact, Moderators have the final say.  We are open to hearing differing opinions, but the mod team will make the final decision.  Visitors and posters in \/r\/running are expected to understand that the mod team are people too and doing the best they can to manage a very large sub with frequent posts every day.  If you do not agree with how this sub is moderated, we expect you to do so in a civil manner\u2026.and also know when it is time to drop it.\n\nWe are very upfront in stating that the sub is heavily moderated, but we do recognize that not every user wants that.  The wonderful thing about reddit is that there are plenty of subs to check out and hopefully find one more to your liking.  If you find the  moderation here too strict, some other related subs with less moderation are \/r\/runninglifestyle\/, \/r\/BeginnersRunning\/, \/r\/runningquestions\/, and \/r\/Runners\/.\n\n_____\n\n\n###**Recurring Threads**\n\nIn order to reduce clutter and nudge you lurkers into posting, we have created a number of daily and weekly threads for you to read, make a comment, or ask a question. Unless you truly believe your new thread will make a new and interesting contribution to Runnit, please wait until the related weekly thread rolls around and post in there instead.  A more complete description of the threads can be [found in the wiki](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/wiki\/faq\/#wiki_reccuring_threads).\n\nHere are the current recurring threads with links to the most recent (hopefully) weekly thread:  \n\n*Please note that the search links for the daily threads (Q&A and Achievement) will not work on mobile.  If you are using mobile, sort the sub by \"Hot\" and the current Q&A thread will be stickied at the top.  For the Achievement thread, sort by \"New\" and scroll down a bit to find the current Achievement thread.*\n\n* [Daily Achievement Thread (Posted daily)](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/search?q=%22achievements+for%22+author%3Aautomoderator&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all): Any and all accomplishment posts should be posted here.

In an effort to keep the front page of the sub uncluttered and fresh, we ask you post your questions, particularly those one-off questions that are potentially short and don't necessarily provoke significant discussion, in the daily General Q&A thread.\n\n* [Weekly Training Thread (Sundays)](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11io48j\/the_weekly_training_thread\/)\n\n* [Miscellaneous Monday General Chit-Chat (Mondays)](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11jy4mt\/miscellaneous_monday_chit_chat\/)\n\n* [Li'l Race Reports Thread (Mondays)](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11jp0bs\/lil_race_report_thread\/)\n\n* [Super Moronic Monday (Tuesdays)](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11l1ky1\/super_moronic_monday_your_weekly_tuesday_stupid\/)\n\n* [Run Nutrition Tuesday (Tuesdays)](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11kprv1\/run_nutrition_tuesday\/)\n\n* [Tuesday Shoesday (Tuesdays)](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11kprum\/tuesday_shoesday\/)\n\n* [Lurker's Wednesday (Wednesday)](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11lmwp2\/lurkers_wednesday\/)\n\n* [What Are You Wearing Wednesday Weekly Gear Thread (Wednesdays)](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11lmwpf\/what_are_you_wearing_wednesday_weekly_gear_thread\/)\n\n* [Weekly Complaints & Confessions Thread (Thursdays)](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11ms3mp\/weekly_complaints_confessions_thread\/)\n\n* [Photo Friday (Fridays)](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11npkka\/its_photo_friday_lets_see_your_running_pictures\/)\n\n* [The Weekend Thread (Fridays)](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11nngw4\/the_weekend_thread_10th_march_2023\/)\n\n* [Race Roll Call (Fridays)](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11nfc3e\/race_roll_call\/)\n\n* [Social Saturday (Saturdays)](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11ob9qv\/social_saturday\/)\n\n* [Monthly Updates & Check In Thread (Last Day of the Month)](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/10qm510\/january_monthly_updates_check_in_thread\/)\n_____\n\n###**Rules**\nWe have further [explanations of the rules in the wiki](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/wiki\/faq\/#wiki_rules), but as noted in the side bar, please take note of Rule 2 and Rule 7 as they are the ones most cited for post removals.\n\n **(2)** - *Posts need to generate discussion and\/or useful information that other searchers can then benefit from. Low-quality posts, recent reposts, chronically repetitive posts, posts not directly related to running, and questions that are easily answered by FAQ, searching r\/running, or Google are subject to removal at the moderation team's discretion.*  \n\nThis sub attracts a lot of beginners as well as \u201cdrive-by\u201d posting.  A major goal of the sub is to promote quality discussion and develop a community where information and experiences can be shared.  Many of the common questions have been answered, either in previous threads\/FAQ, or could easily be answered in the daily Q&A thread.  Yes, circumstances can vary person to person, but it is expected that posters make an attempt to find these answers for themselves before making a stand-alone post.   Visitors should put forth some effort in finding the answer themselves and not expect the Runnit community to do all the work for them.  If the post\/question is very specific to your situation (such that other general user won't get much benefit from the information), then it belongs in the daily Q&A thread.\n\nIf you do make a stand-alone post, please include info relevant for the community to help.  It is nearly impossible to offer any advice without sufficient background information.  Items that could be relevant:\n\n* Age\n\n* Sex\n\n* Current MPW + pace\n\n* Previous peak MPW\n\n* Workouts you traditionally or recently have completed\n\n* Goals (including specific races)\n\n* Previous PRs\n\n* Other things you think might be helpful to include\n\nBelow are some of the reason a post would be considered low-quality, thus being removed and directed to the Daily Q&A thread:\n\n* \"Does anyone else...\" type posts?\n\n* \"Is X a good time for...?\" posts\n\n* If your post is a question in the title (including \u201cSee title\u201d or \u201cTitle says it all\u201d in the body).\n\n* If your question can be asked in one sentence.\n\n* If your question is very specific to you or your situation.\n\n* If your question can be answered either with a yes\/no.\n\n* In general, it is helpful to include something that shows you made an effort to find an answer within the community and thus separate it from the numerous low-effort posts that are submitted every day.  \n\n* Additionally, as rule 5 states, make your title descriptive.  If it is not clear what the post is about or asking, then it will not be useful in later searches.\n\nFinally, while mutual encouragement and sharing of information is a very high priority of r\/running, numerous motivational-type and PSA posts are not necessary.  A larger goal of the sub is to provide information to runners, beginners and experienced, which can get drowned out by these types of posts.\n\n\n **(7)** - *Do not solicit medical advice. This includes 'Has anyone else experienced this injury?' type posts.*  \n\nWhile there is some leeway on advice for rehabbing some minor, common running injuries, this sub is not the place for a diagnosis, and especially not for advice on major injuries.  If you are hurt or injured, find a medical professional with the proper credentials to help you.  Not the internet.  \n\nThere is a big difference between \"Hey, my IT band is tight. Got any good stretches for it?\" and \"My shins hurt every time I run. If I run through the pain, will it turn into a stress fracture?\" If your question involves sharp pains, unknown\/vague pains, or injuries\/problems that have stretched on for long periods of time, then it is a question for medical professional.\n\nAlso, your doctor not being familiar with running injuries is no excuse.  Find a Sports Medicine doctor, Physical Therapist, or find another doctor.\n\n_____________________\n\n\nFinally, feel free to use this post to offer any ideas or suggestions of things you'd like to see (or not see) here.  We are open to feedback, but please be civil, constructive, and willing to have a discussion.  This is not the place to rant.\n\n###**Thank you all for being a part of this community!**","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1659838222.0},{"title":"Miscellaneous Monday Chit Chat","author":"fire_foot","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11q6loo\/miscellaneous_monday_chit_chat\/","text":"Rise and shine, friends!

Furthemore, I was a couch potato and I needed a challenge to work, just so that I had a motivation to train again. After signing up for it, I realised, that it is one of the toughest marathons in Switzerland. During the 42.195 km you have to do two laps up a hill with an elevation gain of 500 meters (~1600 feet) per lap. Before the marathon, the longest race I ever participated in was 15km with 400 meters of elevation gain.\n\nTo prepare for this marathon, I ran to a spot close to where I live to do hill sprints for 5 or more kilometers every second day. The other days, I went to the gym to build up strength.\n\nAbout 2 weeks out of the marathon, I caught a nasty cold and I wasn't able to train anymore during this time. During the days coming up to the marathon, I've tried to get myself healthy enough to run the marathon and also get into the right mindset for this race.\n\nThe marathon:\nAbout 15 minutes before the start, it started to rain, so this meant to some extra difficulty for the race, which is mostly on forest paths. During the start, the emotions ran high and I almost started crying, because I wasn't sure, if I could do it.\n\nThe first 3k were mostly going down or straight, you are running next to a river. Then, the pain started, as the long way up the hill started. You have to climb from km 3 up to km 10.7. I haven't missed any water stations, because I knew it was going to be a long day.\n\nThe way down was very pleasant, as I was able to pick up some pace again. The downhill was until about km 17.5 and then there was a steep ascend up a small hill again before it flattens out to the finish of the first round.\n\nMy first round summed up: 2 hours and 19 minutes for the first 21.1 km, I started to feel my muscles after km 10 and after km 17 I was in pain and I had to walk every now and then.\n\nThe second round starts and I knew, once I made it through this long ascend, I was going to make it. The sun was shining throughout it all and it stopped raining. A lot of people passed me, which was obviously quite demotivating for me, but I told myself to stick to my plan. My plan was to finish the race before it closes after 6 hours. The time didn't matter to me.\n\nI mostly walked the second ascend up this hill. The muddy paths were slippery and I walked through the mud ankle-deep. Once I made it to the first station, I was still able to have a nice conversation with the people, which I was very proud of. At about km 28, someone with a reflecting jacket started to be next to me. So, I was the last person right now. There were still 5k of uphill path in front of me, but I was not demotivated by it. I always told myself, that this is my first marathon and the most important thing, was that I finished the race. I tried to run every now and then but after a couple hundred meters, my muscles were cramping.\n\nThe cramping were the toughest challenge and it was incredibly difficult to not cry or quit. After I somehow made it to the top, I knew it was mostly downhill from now on. I was able to pick up some pace again on the downhill, but I had to stop every kilometer because of my cramping muscles.\n\nWhat gave me a boost of energy, was when I finally saw some other people running this marathon aswell. I even passed two people on the descend. During the last ascend, I walked it up as I didn't want to leave this race with any injury.\n\nBut, I wasn't the last person of the race for about 2.5k. At the end, the cramps came back heavily and right before km 41, I've been passed by the other person again. So, I was last again.\n\nThe last 1.2k were incredibly tough, even if it was mostly going straight. My muscles kept cramping and they begged me to stop moving.\n\n500 meters before the finish, there was a sign and I started running at this sign and I kept runnign until I finally finished my marathon.\n\nI finished the marathon in 5 hours and 25 minutes and it was the toughest thing, I've ever done! Of course I stayed last during the last couple of meters, but I was incredibly proud to have done it despite the difficulties along the way.\n\nWhat the marathon taught me:\nI am mentally so much stronger than I thought and I am able to do a marathon. I wanted to cry and quit so many times during this run, but I kept my head down and pushed through.\n\nHowever, the training needs to be improved with doing longer runs (10k runs instead of 7-8k runs) and get my muscles used to longer distances.\n\nThe altitude change was not an issue at all (which I was worried about), only the marathon distance was incredibly tough. Doing it in difficult terrain and difficult weather taught me to keep pushing through the toughest environment so far. My prior toughest experience was running on icy paths with a strongish (~60kph) wind and constant snow.\n\nHow do I feel afterwards?\nMy muscles are still incredibly sore. My knees started to hurt today, but what hurts the most are my calves. So I'm currently treating them and resting for a few days. I am incredibly proud of what I have accomplished!\n\nWhat is next for me?\nI have signed for the Zurich Marathon, which takes place in 6 weeks. It has barely any altitude change and hopefully, I can come closer to my goal of running a marathon in 4 hours and 15 minutes.","upvote_ratio":0.71,"created_utc":1678696685.0},{"title":"Best headphones to hear your surroundings?","author":"ionlyredditcasually","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11p21ic\/best_headphones_to_hear_your_surroundings\/","text":"Trying to stay safe out on early morning runs and would love to hear everyone\u2019s recommendations on beat headphones that let in ambient noise! \n\nTried the Shokz bone conduction but they don\u2019t seem to stay on my head well!","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1678586246.0},{"title":"Achievements for Sunday, March 12, 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11p5t3i\/achievements_for_sunday_march_12_2023\/","text":"Hey runners, it's another day and it is time to post your accomplishments you'd like to share - big or small.\n\nNote: No need to preface YOUR accomplishments with something like, \"this may not be an accomplishment to most of you...\".

I've found some resources already (Fleet Feet, Polar Watch, Runner's World, Runner's Blueprint, etc.) but these are fairly superficial and I'm looking for something more in-depth. I've always been a decent runner, but I want to start learning more about structuring training. Are there any major books, resources, etc. that anybody would recommend?\n\nThanks in advance!","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1678504248.0},{"title":"Gasparilla Half Marathon (Bittersweet PR)","author":"Sandstorm34","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11o11eg\/gasparilla_half_marathon_bittersweet_pr\/","text":"\\### Race Information\n\n\\* \\*\\*Name:\\*\\* Gasparilla Half Marathon\n\n\\* \\*\\*Date:\\*\\* February 26, 2023\n\n\\* \\*\\*Distance:\\*\\* 13.1\n\n\\* \\*\\*Location:\\*\\* Tampa, FL\n\n\\* \\*\\*Website:\\*\\* [https:\/\/www.rungasparilla.com\/](https:\/\/www.rungasparilla.com\/)\n\n\\* \\*\\*Strava:\\*\\* [https:\/\/www.strava.com\/activities\/8625264004](https:\/\/www.strava.com\/activities\/8625264004)\n\n\\* \\*\\*Time:\\*\\* 1:30:13\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\### Goals\n\n| Goal | Description | Completed? |\n\n|------|-------------|------------|\n\n| A | Sub 1:30 | \\*No\\* |\n\n| B | PR 1:30 | \\*Yes\\* |\n\n| C | PR 1:32 | \\*Yes\\* |\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\### Splits\n\n| Mile | Time |\n\n|------|------|\n\n| 1 | 6:41\n\n| 2 | 6:42\n\n| 3 | 6:37\n\n| 4 | 6:39\n\n| 5 | 6:39\n\n| 6 | 6:46\n\n| 7 | 6:46\n\n| 8 | 6:46\n\n| 9 | 6:48\n\n| 10 | 6:55\n\n| 11 | 7:18\n\n| 12 | 6:58\n\n| 13 | 7:10\n\n| 13.25 | 5:46\n\n\\-----------------------------------\n\n\\### Training\n\nI was in decent shape building up to this race as I was training for NYC before suffering an achilles injury 3 weeks out from the race. Which had me out for 6 weeks. I was peaked at that time at about 55 miles per week. I was diligent with my rehab really maintaining as much fitness as i could with PT, strength training and a lot of bike work before running consistently again in November. \n\nDuring this half marathon cycle i peaked at around 40ish miles with my longest run in the block being 15 miles. I am currently training to try Grandmas Marathon in June as well so my coach and I wanted to prep my long run as such to allow for an easy transition to marathon work after the half. We focused a lot on Lactate Threshold and zone 3 running work as that has been my weakness for as long as I can remember. I would tend to dig too deep in workouts and over time the compound effect took over and my recovery was not so great.\n\nTraining was great overall. I learned a lot from the injury. I was never overreaching as I had been during marathon training which potentially caused my injury. Stayed the course and really took easy days super easy to allow for proper recovery to really dial in the workouts fully. I knew there was variety in my workouts so I really focused on staying even easy splits for my easy days to just get the mileage and not worry so much about the pace. Pace work is for workout days, the rest is for aerobic development and\/or recovery.\n\nOne of my harder weeks looked like this\n\nM - 5 miles easy\n\nT - Some fartlek\/interval work usually repeats of 2-5 minute range of 5K effort with easy recovery (usually about 6-7 miles total with warm up and cool down)\n\nW- Off or cross train\n\nR - LT session or (8 miles total of Zone 3 running)\n\nF - off or cross train\n\nS - 15 Mile total with warm and cool down \\[8x 4min @ 6:40 with zone 3 semi recovery (7:45-8:00\/mile)\\]\n\nS - 5 very easy\n\n\\----------------------------------------\n\n**### Pre-race**\n\nWoke up around 4 am to have my usual pre-race meal of multi grain toast and peanut butter with plenty of nuun and water. IT was humid out as is usual in Florida so I knew I needed some hydration for the start. Got to downtown Tampa around 5 and began my usual warm up. Did 2 miles easy with some strides mixed in to wake the legs up and get a little sweat going. \n\nGot my 4 Glukos nutrition liquids in my flip belt and set out for the start line. I may have Took a little too much time getting warmed up and relaxed as I was cutting it close to getting to the start line and had to weave in between people to get towards the sub 2 hour area. Hop the fence when I found a friend who was around the same fitness as me and got mentally ready to roll. \n\n\\------------------------------------------\n\n**### Race**\n\nThe gun goes off and we set out. I tend to be pretty lax at the start letting the excited folks take off ahead of me while I calibrate the legs to the right cadence and pace. Made the mistake of being kinda farther outside of the route for the first two turns but I realized that too late and had a feeling I would pay for the lack of tangent at the end but, no matter no need to fret, just had to stay the course.\n\n**Miles 1-3**\n\nRelax and calibrate. That was the goal here. Find MY race pace and stay relaxed. Well maybe I was too relaxed but I felt really good. Passed mile 1 and my watch ticked 6:41 so i knew I was dialed in. Maybe a little quick but the weather was cooler since the sun was not up yet so the extra 10 seconds is not a bad idea. \n\nI Stayed moving strong and felt pretty relaxed at this point so I just kept going. At this point I was slowly picking people off till I found a group that I hung with. I made the mistake my first Half marathon of being in no mans land for a while so I did not want to make that mistake. Mile 3 clicks off and my watch says 6:37...ah crap! That is probably a little to aggressive. Took my first Glukos liquid and  continued on trying to relax a bit more and slow up a bit.\n\n**Miles 4-8**\n\nFeeling good still the focus was to slow the legs a tad without losing momentum. Still felt really smooth. By Mile 6 I found the perfect rhythm but began to feel a little tired like I dipped into the lactic acid pool a little too soon. I continued to dial in the nutrition and thankfully I was in the range of a few other runners that kept me motivated and strong.\n\n**Mile 9-13.1**\n\nThis is where the race starts as they say. The turn around point was surprisingly sharp and I was not prepared for it. The tried to soften it along side street but somehow I think it made the turn worse. At this point something mentally and physically cracked in me and I was fading. \n\nThe fading started to creep into the quads and hamstrings. \"Just one last 5K, we got this!\" I kept uttering to myself. I also looked at the road ahead of me, when did it get so bright? I looked to my right the sun was up. I noticed my skin getting warmer, the sweat was collecting more in my singlet. Legs were getting heavy but I kept pushing through it. Watch ticked off mile 10 at 6:55. Its okay we can still get it. We made up some time early in the race for this keep pushing. It just seemed as the miles continued the legs just got heavier. Right before mile 11 there was a water stop and I knew I needed more than just liquid energy so I briefly stopped for water to cool off as quick as I could and continued on. \n\nThe yo-yo effect began as they call it. I got a minor second wind in mile 12 when my watch ticked off sub 7 I had a new energy, but that too quickly faded as the sun continued to rise higher and my legs just kept getting heavier. Okay, One last water stop to collect the bearings and continue on. As I was jogging past the water stop to get up to speed, a women came past me and I remembered passing her around mile 7\/8 and she shouted at me \"Let's go we got this just one more mile left come on!\" Thank you stranger, that was all the motivation I needed to just suffer those last 1 and a quarter miles. I knew at this point the Sub 1:30 was off the table but I still knew I could PR pretty well. \n\nI dug in and kept moving without stopping. I could begin to hear the screams from the end line and the muffled speaker of the microphone emcee of the finish. I could finally see the corral get closer and closer. So this was it, I Kept digging and digging to garner up some momentum to cross the finish. I looked to my left to see the clock tick at 1:29 as I am passing people screaming the stands. Maybe just maybe!!! \n\nI Kicked as hard as I could passing around 3-4 people as I sprinted with everything I had left and crossed the finish line but seeing overhead the clock read 1:30:19. \"Maybe I started 21 seconds after the clock started\" I said to myself smiling.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------\n\n**### Post-race**\n\nA lot of my club mates finished well under 1:30 and were all there waiting at the line as I finished. All of them congratulating me on my final kick. I looked over to my right at my girlfriend and she smiled but shook her head knowing what the goal was but still showing how proud and happy she was. I found the race results on my phone of 1:30:13. \n\nI knew I was in sub 1:30 shape but a huge 4 minute PR is something to be proud of. I take solace in knowing I never gave up even when I really really wanted to. I trusted my coach and the training and a PR is the reward for that journey and it is time well spent. The course was a warm one and today was just not the day, well get 'em next time. I could barely run a half mile to cool down so I took the long way walking back to my car as more of a cool down for the legs. I laughed as I tried to jog knowing damn I was pretty spent so I knew I gave it all I had. Not bad for only my second half marathon. \n\nNext up is my first full Marathon at Grandma's Marathon!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMade with a new \\[race report generator\\]([http:\/\/sfdavis.com\/racereports\/](http:\/\/sfdavis.com\/racereports\/)) created by \/u\/herumph.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1678482812.0},{"title":"Achievements for Saturday, March 11, 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11ob9sg\/achievements_for_saturday_march_11_2023\/","text":"Hey runners, it's another day and it is time to post your accomplishments you'd like to share - big or small.\n\nNote: No need to preface YOUR accomplishments with something like, \"this may not be an accomplishment to most of you...\".

You are now the spouse\/partner of the year.  Taking the kid(s) out on a run during early years is the ultimate triple (or quadruple) win: You get exercise, the littles nap, and your better half has some alone time (for me it was my wife taking a nap).  Official rule of when they can start running is \"it depends on their neck strength\", but general rule is 6 months for running, 1 year for biking.  Overall the running resistence is low and the extra time added is minimal, but as they get heavier your time gets worse.\n\nSecondly: Running with kids won't make you a better\/stronger runner, it is just harder.  You will utilize some extra muscles, mostly core\/stabilization in the lower back and abs.  You'll find yourself oddly sore if these have been neglected.\n\nThirdly: Physics is your enemy, the stroller acts as a wind trap going into the wind, and a sail in the reverse direction. And the benefit on the return is nothing compared to the cost going out. Going up hills can be brutal and going down can be even worse, pulling you faster than your preferred pace, literally dragging you downhill.  Combined uphill + headwind can push your pace easily over 1 minute\/mile.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nMy kids are both late-winter babies (Feb, Jan, April), so I've broken down my experience into phases rather than years.\n\nPhase 1: 6-15 months. +10-15 seconds per mile.  This is the easiest phase, naps are guaranteed and little effort is required planning\/timing.  Bring a diaper bag and spare bottle and you can be gone for a long time.  We did dozens of half marathon+ runs.\n\nPhase 2: 18-30 months. +15-20 seconds per mile.  Naps have coalesced down to just one per day, so you have to choose to go on your schedule which will force a nap that may help or harm the rest of the day.  My recommendation is to wait until their time.  I would finish plenty of 2 hour+ runs and they would finish up napping in the stroller hanging outside within eyesight.  Started biking to day care & office frequently when not in race training season.\n\nPhase 3: 2.5 year old and Baby number 2! Double stroller! +20-25 seconds per mile.  This is peak helpfulness and peak cuteness. Both are napping, but the older one will need snacks and distractions.\n\nPhase 4: 3.5 year old and 14-20 month old. +30-35 seconds per mile. Starting to get awkward, the older may stop napping and start needing attractions.  \"The overpass\" became a major destination for us. My trail had two big highways to go over and we'd stop and watch \/ wave at all the cars.  Bring lots of snacks!  Biking to major destinations (waterfall, ice cream, donuts & coffee) became more common. You might start taking only the younger out, while the older has special \"Only Mommy\" time. \n\nPhase 5: 4-5 & 2-3 years old. Combined almost +100 pounds! +35-40 seconds per mile.  Overall Distance\/time has dropped, I capped out at 1.5 hours of running (usually less) and you will need a major destination (so total time out of house is extended).  For us there was a special \"running park\", ice cream store, lake attractions, etc. Split kids happening more often. \n\nPhase 6: Baby number 3!  Other kids (5.5 & 3.5) are bored with running by now, but getting the littlest out of the house is still a major help. From a pace perspective, a return to Phase 1.\n\nWe'll see how this year goes, but I expect they will be too cool to hang out with the baby.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1678462604.0},{"title":"It's Photo Friday - let's see your running pictures!","author":"brwalkernc","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11npkka\/its_photo_friday_lets_see_your_running_pictures\/","text":"###**Last week, on Photo Friday:**\n\n\/u\/il97le grabbed the top spot.\n\n> [Northern lights during late evening run in the snow](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/11lJ41p.jpg)\n\n\/u\/PrettySureIParty grabbed the first runner-up spot.\n\n> [One of my favorite areas to run, and it was looking pretty photogenic this morning](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/PxqIBx2)\n\n\/u\/bill--dozer grabbed the second runner-up spot.\n\n> [sunrise and waves](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/bRBjsge)\n\n###**Rules of the Road**\n\n* Post your running photos of any kind!

Due to the circumstances of life and a very hefty work schedule, I had gotten into the worst physical shape I've been in in over 10 years (m35) in 2021. In October I did a company-wide step challenge and ran as much as a could, getting 625,000 steps and losing a few pounds. I adopted this training regimen in November, beginning at about week 5 of the training program, and also began HR training. This was very frustrating but in hindsight was probably integral in getting me to the start line albeit busted up as I was. \n\n*more info* I have been running consistently for about 14 years. I ballooned to 220lbs from 170lbs during college and started running to lose weight. I very rarely actually \"train\" I just enjoy casually jogging. I have also been consistent in the gym but got up to 195lbs by December 2021. I got back down to 170 about 1 month ago and decided to quit staying in a deficit. \n\nWeek 14- didn't take a rest day for 18 days. Dog got loose and I fell trying to tackle her, busting my right hip on the concrete. Had to take 5 days off. \n\nWeek 15 and 16- ran 18 and 20 mile long runs consecutively. \n\nWeek 17- pulled my right glute med 2 days before flight to begin vacation. This was on my 8 mile TAPER run. Thankfully I got to see a PT and got needling which may or may not have helped. I was devastated and the anxiety began. This would be my last run 12 day out from my marathon. Talk about a bummer. I could barely walk the next day due to the excruciating pain in my hip. \n\nRace Week- Zion National Park. Yes, it was a dreamy idea at first. Tent camping, knocking out my taper runs in this beautiful canyon, keeping my legs moving while hiking Angel's Landing\/Narrows. NOPE. My dumb ass gets the worst shin splint of my life from hiking in snow\/water. Wednesday of race week I can barely walk, spend the day resting. Thursday I hike 4 miles upstream in water and eviscerated my leg. Flight to Little Rock Friday morning. Ride the scooters everywhere to stay off my leg. I'm super worried about if I'm even going to be able to finish this thing. I can hardly walk.\n\n### Pre-race\nLuckily I had found the best PT in the state of Arkansas at the expo. This guy was heaven sent. He spent an hour working on that leg Friday and Saturday. Problem was it still hurt like hell though, and when I woke up that morning I still had a limp but it didn't hurt as bad jogging in place. Eggs, bacon, and biscuits and gravy for breakfast, a Southern Delight. 1 large cup of coffee and water. \n\n### Race\nHoly shit here it is. What a dumb predicament I've gotten myself in. I'd dreamt of sub 4 but I'm wondering if I can walk this bitch in 6.5 hours. Race takes off and my leg feels manageable to run on. I decide I'm going to get as far on it as I can and walk the rest, I'm getting that medal.\n\nMile 1-7 - Wow! Not so bad. Shin is in a knot but lo and behold I'm running with the 4hr pacer. Neat. A lot of people are out cheering us on and it's a beautiful day. \n\nMile 7-14 - IM STILL HERE. This stupid mother fucker is going to do it. 2 more hours of sheer torture and I'm gonna sub 4 this bitch.\n\nMile 15 - NOT SO FAST. Humble hill is upon us, I'm not sure if that's its name but that's what I'm calling it as it gave me a humble reminder that I am in fact a sea creature. I climbed straight out of the swamp to run this marathon, no hills in sight, and the hill is lasting for a whole mile. It destroyed me. This is the last time I see that sub 4 sign. My legs are starting to disintegrate from running with improper form, favoring my right leg. \n\nMile 16-26 - beautiful stretch of run through the outskirts of LR. The hills don't seem to stop except for one long and hopeless out and back along a country club about mile 20-24 maybe. I maintain a 10 minute or so pace from here on out. People are dropping like flies. I moves from about 300th place to 200th in this stretch. One hill is so steep I didn't see a single person running it, but it is about the last obstacle. \n\nMile 25- The pain is there but I don't care. This is finally over. I pass some ladies handing out lipstick and regretfully didn't grab any for my wife. I could barely see and this point and honestly thought they were Popsicles. I can see my destination and finally I'm crossing that Finish line. I had to fight back the tears when I got that medal on my neck. 4:12 and I'm not even mad about it 1 bit. I'm actually pretty excited.\n\n### Post-race\nLong drive home, six hours. Every bump sends pain through out my body. Burger and shake in Texarkana for lunch and back home to Louisiana. Man it feels good to be home. I don't know what to do now and I feel kind of lost. I'm ready to move onto the next thing but my body needs more rest I know. \n\n\n*This post was generated using [the new race-reportr](https:\/\/coachview.github.io\/race-reportr\/), powered by [coachview](https:\/\/www.coachview.io), for making organized, easy-to-read, and beautiful race reports.*","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1678416092.0},{"title":"Running YouTube channels","author":"Glittering_Sorbet881","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11mu57s\/running_youtube_channels\/","text":"Can anyone recommend some fun adventure style running channels on YouTube? \nI\u2019m not after training tips or shoe reviews, I\u2019m after inspiration for adventures or cool challenges.

That's when the event ended and the finish line closed.  All I wanted to do was get to the finish line before it closed.  I made it with 53 seconds to spare.\n\n| Goal | Description | Completed? |\n|------|-------------|------------|\n| A | Don't Quit | *Yes* |\n| B | Finish before 1:30 PM | *Yes* |\n\n### Splits\n\nAlthough my finish was 6:29:08 (Garmin time, not gun time), much of that (1.78 mi) was spent either at rest (eating) or walking.  I broke out the \"running\" miles below.  The 1.78 mi of stopping \/ walking were 43 minutes of my time (43:34).  Since these lunch breaks really skew my pace times, I just omitted them in the table below.  This gives my overall \"running\" pace of 14:08 min\/mi (8:47 min\/km), and a \"non-running\" pace of around 22:48 min\/mi (14:10 min\/km).  I'm well aware that at 14:08 min\/mi I'm slower than many people's walking pace.  That became brutally apparent as the walkers began to pass me :-(.  Feel free to haze me on this fact if required.\n\n| Mile | Pace (min\/mi)| Pace (min\/km) |\n|-------|--------------|--------------|\n| 1     | 12:46        | 7:56 | \n| 2     | 13:38        | 8:28 | \n| 3     | 13:38        | 8:28 | \n| 4     | 13:49        | 8:35 | \n| 5     | 13:43        | 8:31 | \n| 6     | 13:46        | 8:33 | \n| 7     | 13:38        | 8:28 | \n| 8     | 13:44        | 8:32 | \n| 9     | 13:56        | 8:39 | \n| 10    | 12:52        | 8:00 | \n| 11    | 13:05        | 8:08 | \n| 12    | 12:37        | 7:50 | \n| 13    | 13:52        | 8:37 | \n| 14    | 13:38        | 8:28 | \n| 15    | 14:07        | 8:46 | \n| 16    | 14:23        | 8:56 | \n| 17    | 14:49        | 9:12 | \n| 18    | 14:51        | 9:14 | \n| 19    | 15:00        | 9:19 | \n| 20    | 15:17        | 9:30 | \n| 21    | 15:22        | 9:33 | \n| 22    | 15:26        | 9:35 | \n| 23    | 15:29        | 9:37 | \n| 24    | 15:36        | 9:42 | \n| 24.44 | 14:55        | 9:16 | \n\n\n### Training\n\nObviously, I didn't train much.  I started with C25K and graduated that program with a 45 min 5K.  I went ahead and did the Higdon 5K program until my 5K was under 31 min, but from then on I just jumped straight into the Higdon novice marathon program.  Things were fine at the lower mileage, but once I got past 10K runs I found I really had to relax my pace.  MUCH more than what the VDOT calculator suggested.  I would attempt the VDOT pace suggested, but was always a bit below VDOT on the longer distances.  This problem compounded until I eventually saw that my realistic goal (with breaks) was likely going to be something like 6:30, which is about where I landed.  Realizing that I was backsliding to walking speeds, I should have probably done a Galloway approach, but by the time I figured that out I was already well into my program and wasn't wanting to switch.  The two factors that likely contributed to my progressively slower paces were my weight loss and lack of cross-training.  I knew I was not following the rules on both accounts, but weight loss was the main reason I took up running, so I was fine with the trade off.  Overall I lost 50 lbs while training.  As for cross-training, I was swimming, but eventually the amount of training-hours a week I was spending (due to ultra-slow pacing) was just more than I wanted to budget, so I cut strength and cross-training from my program.  Anyone interested in actually doing well should NOT do what I did.\n\nOther opportunities for improvement would have been to try to optimize my water, food and bathroom breaks more.  But again, I cared very little about what my finish time was, just so long as I finished before 1:30PM.  Since I could never tolerate gels, and would drink (and sweat) copious amounts, I decided to just let those long breaks be.  I also had to do a full relace on my Hokas at around the halfway point which killed 5-10 minutes.\n\n### Pre-race\n\nFor the week before the race, I started waking VERY early.  Race day I woke at 2am.  Most of the time was spent making food and drink (water+juice+salt) and packing my camelbak to the breaking point.  One of the crazier things I did was to swap gear on race day.  I had terrible pinky-toe blisters with my Hokas once I got past 18 mi.  I took a suggestion and bought some Injinji toe-socks.  They didn't arrive until just before the race.  I also packed some \"conventional\" socks in my bag incase they fell apart on course but the toe-socks held up great.  What's more, they completely resolved my toe-blisters, so a total win in that regard.\n\n### Race\n\nSince I set the easiest achievable goal, there was no real hardship on course.  Things went pretty much as I expected them to go and really mirrored my 18mi and 20mi training runs.  One thing I didn't do was pack a race map.  Single piece of paper would have helped out.  On course there was a \"Detour\" sign pointing down a road with a bunch of elite marathoners pouring out of.  It was the point in the course where loop one and loop two merge.  Since I was in the back of the pack, I was getting lapped by the elites.  This made me question if I was still on course while causing me to run much faster (see mile 10, 11, 12) since the flow of traffic was so much faster.  But once I got to mile 13, I was the only one left on the course, which was actually REALLY nice.  The last 10 miles were actually my favorite part of the race.  Around mile 16 I spied another marathoner who was walking.  I managed to catch him 3 times, but he always passed again as I would slow for food \/ water breaks.  I gauged his walking pace at about 15 min\/mi (9:19 min\/km), but my walking pace was closer to 20 min\/mi.  So whenever I walked, he'd blaze past me and we'd laugh at each other.\n\nAround the last 4 miles my quitting voice got pretty loud.  Since I was doing the math in my head I knew that taking a walking break would result in a DNF, so I just allowed myself to go slow, but NOT WALK.  Perhaps I should have trained in speed walking since my slow run is slower than a fast walk, and it seems like that last hour could have been better spent.\n\n### Post-race\n\nFor the last hour of the race I was starting to feel pretty sick, so couldn't really eat or drink much.  So on the last mile or so, I was \"cramping\" pretty bad.  My hips, quads and calves were in bad shape.  I got the feeling that if I stopped moving I'd lock up, so although I had a group waiting at the finish, I had to keep walking for another mile or so before my legs felt like stopping wouldn't result in falling.  Ruined a bit of the after-party, but at least I didn't end up in the medical tent.\n\nDay 1 after race felt pretty sore, but I slept for about 14 hrs and that seemed to have helped.  Day 2 after felt like I had just done a long run, nothing too serious.  My first run will be two miles on the fourth day after the race.  Since I am at my lifetime goal weight, I won't have to train on a calorie deficit either which will likely help a lot.\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http:\/\/sfdavis.com\/racereports\/) created by \/u\/herumph.","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1678232413.0},{"title":"First trail run in the US, do I have to be careful?","author":"r3zin","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11l20n7\/first_trail_run_in_the_us_do_i_have_to_be_careful\/","text":"Hello fellow runners,\n\nI will be on a business trip in Las Vegas over the coming days.

What started out as a way to just help some weight loss turned into a passion I had no idea existed inside of me. I spent the first half of 2022 losing weight and spending time in the weight room. I started running officially on September 26, 2022. I went for a 2.36 mile run that day and from there the rest is history.\n\nThrough all the beginner aches and pains I persevered and slowly but surely got better at running. As I got better I fell in love more and more. December 3rd I decided to sign up for this Half Marathon. At the time I thought maybe I was being a bit ambitious but I put my mind to it and kept training.\n\nI followed a training plan I found online and stuck to it pretty well. 20-35 miles a week. I never let off. A lot of foam rolling and massage gun sessions to help with recovery. Kept my nutrition on point and continued to lose weight. (I was 250.4lbs on May 18th of 2022, 190.2lbs as of this morning 3\/7\/2023).\n\n### Pre-race\nI got a good nights sleep, 7 hours. Woke up feeling rested. Did my typical pre-long run routine. Hydrate. Croissant with PB and Honey and a banana about 2 hours before race start. Got to the race about 1 hr before start and did some basic mobility stretches and made sure to use the bathroom. I was feeling confident and strong that morning.\n\n### Race\nKept my strategy. I knew from training that getting 1:45 was going to happen, as long as no injuries. I knew that I could push a little harder because well It's RACE DAY! It was what I trained for so trying to start at a 7:45mile seemed good.\nAs mile one went by I felt fantastic and just kept going, now shooting for the 7:30~mile. HR was steady and I just kept running. I was zoned in. Weather was beautiful.\n\nMile 8-10 I felt like superman. I dunno. Music hit just right and the runners high came on.\n\nMile 11-13 I felt it. Legs were tired and I had to dig deep because I knew from my watch that going sub 1:40 was now a possibility.\n\n### Post-race\nCrossed the finished line and probably said a few cuss words but I was so happy with the race. Sub 1:40 was waaay better than I hoped for. I felt really good until I drove home. Got out of the car and my legs were DONE! :)\n\nI got into the Brooklyn Half on May 20. So I continue to keep the fitness up and maybe shoot for sub 1:35! \n\nI am officially in love with running. \n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http:\/\/sfdavis.com\/racereports\/) created by \/u\/herumph.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1678218793.0},{"title":"Run the Alamo","author":"PitoChueco","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11lckc1\/run_the_alamo\/","text":"### Race Information\n* **Name:** Run the Alamo Marathon\n* **Date:** March 5, 2023\n* **Distance:** 26.2 miles\n* **Location:** San Antonio, TX\n* **Website:** https:\/\/www.runthealamo.com\n* **Time:** 4:21:02\n\n### Goals\n| Goal | Description | Completed? |\n|------|-------------|------------|\n| A | Sub 5 | *Yes* |\n| B | Finish | *Yes* |\n\n### Splits\n| Kilometer | Time |\n|------|------|\n| 1 | 10:48\n| 5 | 9:23\n| 10 | 9:32\n| 15 | 9:04\n| 20 | 10:14\n| 25 | 10:59\n\n### Training\nThis was my 5th full (I run one every 5 years to make sure I don't let myself go).  During the year, I usually run around 10M a week.  Due to nagging injuries, I went into this run fairly under trained. I have a herniated disk in my back and battling some tendonitis in my Achilles and knee.  Based on some wise advice I read on this sub, my main priority was just getting to the start line somewhat healthy. That said, I didn't put in near the miles I have for past races.\n\nI ran a half at Christmas and then started my training for the full.  My training schedule is below.  No rhyme or reason other than this what fit my schedule best.\n\nMon\/Wed\/Sat: strength training\nTuesday: Elliptical or treadmill 30-40 min \nThurs\/Fri:  3-4M run \nSun: Long run.  Started on New Year\u2019s day at 16M, followed by a few long runs of 16, 18 and maxing out at one at 20M.  My last long run was three weeks before the race to try to heal up as much as possible and avoid any new injuries.\n\n\n### Pre-race\nThis was somewhat of a destination race for us (wife did half) as San Antonio is 3 hours away from home.  We got into town, picked up packets and mapped out the route from our hotel to the start line.  The Expo that was advertised with the race was underwhelming with only one tent.  No biggie for me but worth mentioning.  We then went and had a few cocktails and explored the town.  Finished the night with a pizza and a few craft beers.\n\nWoke up around 5AM, went to the hotel gym to stretch for 15 minutes or so, showered and ate a fold-over PB&J sandwich and two scoops of Tailwind and out the door for the start line.\n\nThree of my previous marathons were in the 4:30 range. One was 5 hours as I was forced to walk\/limp\/shuffle the last 6 miles due to some bad tendonitis in my knee.  So knowing I was kinda banged up, I thought 5 hour goal would be reasonable if I had to walk some.  Main goal for me is always just finish...\n\n### Race\nThe weather forecast was on the warm side but tolerable.  High around 80F and low 55F.  The start line was a bit of a cluster (as it usually is) but the cannon shot start was good to get the blood flowing.  I did not like the fact that the half started at the same time as the full.\n\nThe first few miles were mostly trying to dodge the crowd and find my pace.  I turned off my voice prompts on Runkeeper and did my best to avoid looking at distance markers.  I didn't want to know my distance until after 20M.  This was a last-minute decision based on nothing. Funny if I saw the marker up ahead, I would either turn my head 90 degrees or close my eyes as I approached to avoid seeing the number. I found a pace that felt comfortable around mile 2 or so and settled in.  The first couple of miles of the course kind of zig-zagged through downtown San Antonio and some of the surrounding neighborhoods.  Good crowd for support but the route was a bit messy and tight.  I think races should print out some basic rules of the road to put in the runner packets.  Common sense things like:\n\n-If you are walking or a very slow runner, do not line up at the front.\n-If you need to stop, move over to the right don't just stop in the middle of the course.\n-Spitting\/blowing your nose may be necessary, but look next to you before doing so.\n-It is great that you have friends and are running together.  But if there are 4 of you running side by side, it is not so great.\n\nI could go on but I degress.......\n\nThings got better once we got out of town and started running along the Riverwalk. I had been to SA a dozen or so times and have enjoyed the Riverwalk downtown with bars\/restaurants\/shops but I was unaware it also turns into a nice park system as well.  Hydration stations were frequent which turned more important as the heat started to rise.  I packed four small bags of Tailwind in my running belt and tried to ration those as needed.  This was my first experience using Tailwind during a marathon and glad I decided to pack them.  I do feel I got a bit of a boost each time I drank a water mixed with TW and my cramping was less than my previous marathons. Around 8-mile mark, there was a Mariachi band playing and a large crowd in the park which was good to break up the monotony.  Also, a lady had little shots of tequila?!  I wisely passed on this. Unfortunately my back started tightening up here.  I cranked by running belt tighter and took off my shirt and tied it around my waist for some placebo support.\n\nThe half marathon runners broke at the park with the full heading out to make a loop through another part of the park.  This is where it seems the elevation changes came into play.  Where I am from is very flat.  When I decided to do this run, I knew it was not incredibly hilly but more so than I am used to.  In training, I decided to do some hill workouts on the treadmill to prep.  This turned out to be a bad idea as it really aggravated my Achilles so I abandoned this.  With the heat picking up, I could feel my calves firing with the elevation but my pace remained steady.  One standout for this stretch of miles was the two suspension bridges we crossed coming and going (4 crossings total).  This was a very odd feeling having heavy legs and then running on a moving\/floating surface.  My knees buckled at first because I was not suspecting unstable surfaces.  Weird and wonder if anyone else had problems with those bridges.\n\nSince I tried to avoid the mile markers, I was guessing around mile 18 is when it really got hot.    It had been overcast and a bit foggy earlier in the day but the Texas sun prevailed.  I started to see a lot more people walking so I made a conscious effort to stop at every hydration station and stretch a bit.  I got a GU wafer from one of the stops and a few orange slices at another.  I also had a bag of Jellybeans in my pocket that I would snack on.  There weren't a lot of hills rather some long slow grades.  Again, calves and back were not happy with the endeavor but we plowed ahead. \n\nI finally caught a glimpse of a marker at mile 21.  I fell in with a 4:20 pacesetter led group so I knew I was in good shape to beat the 5hr goal I had.  Now that I could lift my head up without worrying about seeing the markers, I could enjoy the scenic route back into downtown.  The 4:20 group started to out pace me but I fell in with another guy running similar to my pace so we chatted a bit and pushed each other a bit when needed with freindly banter.  Around mile 25 the calves started cramping so I walked a half mile or so, stopped and stretched and then headed to the finish line.  Only bummer was the lady on the corner saying, \"good job, only a half mile to go...\".  I could not yet see the finish line but in my head, I knew I had maybe two tenths of a mile max to finish.  The half mile thing took the wind out of my sails slightly, but I had the adrenaline rushing so was near sprinting (relative to your definition of sprinting after 26M).  Turns out she was incorrect, and it was not a half mile.  A hundred yards after rounding her corner I could see the finish line. The usual mix of elation\/glad-its-over\/disorientation\/why-is-my-grown-ass-man-crying feelings, grabbed a water, medal and found my wife.  Headed to the beer line for a well-deserved cold one.  Ended up at 4:21 chip time.  Not sure if that is my PR but my 50-year-old self came in at near or better time than my 30 year old self did on my first marathon.\n\n\n### Post-race\nIt was a half mile walk back to the hotel so that was fun.  Note for future self:  When running a destination race, find a hotel with a hot tub or pool at a minimum.  Back was and still is tight.

This was my first ever running event so quite nerve-wracking! I hadn't even done a park run prior to this, which is a mistake on my part.\n\nI would not say I am genetically gifted or talented in running for a long duration. I'm far better at short bursts of high-intensity efforts. Just the way I'm built I guess! My best 1km is 3:17. \n\n### Training\nI started running in the first lockdown in March 2020 in the UK. This then lead to shin splints as I ran way too much and did all the newbie mistakes. After several months off and some new shoes and physio advice, I was back out there again but this time I slowly (probably too slowly) built up the weekly volume to around 32km a week. Mostly slow runs, 6:30 per Km pace. I would run 4 times a week (with a couple including strides) and Sunday was the designated long run day. I agreed to do this half just 8 weeks prior and only did my first 10 miles one week exactly before half marathon day. Getting this under my belt definitely helped with my confidence knowing I could do 10 miles and that the rest would have to be all heart. \n\n### Pre-race\nPlenty of sleep the three days leading up to the race with a lot more carbs 48 hours from race day. I remembered the advice given here by fellow users as to not change anything on race day, so no gels or food was consumed during the race. I kept everything the same as possible. My only concern was waking up at 0630 for the 0900 starts. I always run in the evenings and find that's when I perform best, so it was nice to know that I can perform when the going gets tough in the mornings too now! \n\n### Race\nI set off with the 3 friends I was running with, but we had all agreed prior to running at separate paces due to varying abilities. As soon as the race started I was quickly humbled by what felt like everybody who raced that day due to so many overtakes. Nevertheless, I moved to the edge and kept my pace. I was aiming for 6:05 per km but I naturally felt best around 6:00 (not a big difference but felt it mentally). \n\n0-5km: Felt fresh, some of the hills and bridges got the blood pumping around the legs and the initial adrenaline rush was starting to cool off and my rhythm was being found.\n\n5-10km: Once again, the rhythm was keeping me going at this point. It was nice to run with other people for a change. I rarely run with music, and in-ear headphones were banned at this event so it was just me and my mind. Random thoughts came to mind such as \"Oh this is a good time for highways maintenance to check the roads as they're all closed\", \"I wonder what my relative effort score will be on Strava after this\" & \"How long can I maintain this 180 BPM\"\n\n10-15km: This is where things started to get tough but were expected. The route had some nasty hills (nasty in my books, I'm sure they're gentle for what some of you guys on here run over) and I was already overthinking how my body would react to breaking that 10-mile mark and going into uncharted territory. \n\n15 - 21km: \"Oh my god this sucks so bad\" was going through my mind for the remaining 6km. It was the first time I had really pushed myself to keep going when I'm drained and exhausted. The smallest hill would zap energy from my legs and the pace naturally dropped during the last 3km due to all of this. I knew this was going to be the case though from the get-go. The last 6km were meant to be all heart. As I heard the music and the crowd at the end, I got a flashback to when I was running on a school sports day and suddenly got all embarrassed by the number of people, knowing I looked like death itself and felt quite dizzy afterwards. Dehydration. \n\n\n### Post-race\n\nDrank plenty. Downed a banana and a Mars bar. Walked incredibly slowly to the car and was driven home.\n\n\n### Takeaways\n\nI have a newfound respect for marathon runners. To think that people do twice the distance I did is just amazing (and many do ultras). Sure, they train for it and they'll often do runs longer than half marathons, but the dedication to get to that point and to run for that long has really put things into perspective. I do not plan to ever do one, half marathons are my limit...for now ;)\n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http:\/\/sfdavis.com\/racereports\/) created by \/u\/herumph.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1678126937.0},{"title":"My First Marathon - Napa Valley Marathon","author":"lxe","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11kgl3q\/my_first_marathon_napa_valley_marathon\/","text":"### Race Information\n* **Name:** First Marathon - Napa Valley Marathon\n* **Date:** March 5, 2023\n* **Distance:** 26.2 miles\n* **Location:** Calistoga, CA\n* **Website:** https:\/\/napavalleymarathon.org\/\n* **Strava:** https:\/\/www.strava.com\/activities\/8666731851\n* **Time:** 04:56:38\n\n### Goals\n| Goal | Description | Completed? |\n|------|-------------|------------|\n| A | Sub 5 | *Yes* |\n| B | Sub 4:45 | *No* |\n| C | Sub 4:30 | *No* |\n\n### Splits\n|mile|time|\n|----|----|\n|1|10:01|\n|2|9:56|\n|3|9:55|\n|4|10:17|\n|5|10:17|\n|6|10:33|\n|7|10:38|\n|8|10:19|\n|9|10:32|\n|10|11:11|\n|11|10:41|\n|12|11:01|\n|13|10:39|\n|14|11:09|\n|15|11:15|\n|16|11:31|\n|17|11:25|\n|18|11:38|\n|19|11:53|\n|20|12:02|\n|21|10:45|\n|22|11:52|\n|23|12:52|\n|24|13:24|\n|25|14:05|\n|26|14:58|\n|0.28|16:10|\n\n### Training\nTwo years ago, I couldn't run a mile. But after years of transforming my sedentary, alcohol-fueled lifestyle, I discovered a new passion: running. In November, I completed my first half marathon and felt invincible.\n\nWith newfound confidence and determination, I started training for a marathon. I knew it would be a whole another ballpark compared to the half. I increased my mileage and ran more long runs, but I made the mistake of neglecting cross and strength training. My longest run was 19 miles, and I caught a cold three weeks before the marathon, which set me back.\n\n### Pre-race\nI live an hour away from the race venue, so I soaked in the hot tub to warm up before leaving. The day of the marathon, I woke up early, had a very light breakfast (I run on empty stomach usually), and then had a friend drive me to the start line. \n\nI arrived 15 minutes before the start, and left the bathroom 30 seconds before the start of the race. Was cutting it pretty close. \n\n### Race\nThe first few miles flew by, and I felt as I usually do when running these distances: very very happy. My heart was pounding with excitement, my feet barely touching the ground. Miles 1-13 are my bread and butter, but I started to slow down by mile 13. I was pacing myself pretty normally, maybe a bit too quick, but not by much. HR was way too high, but I still felt good.\n\nI drank water and the electrolyte drinks at every station and ate gu gels every 45 minutes to keep my energy levels up. As the race progressed, I began to feel the toll that the distance was taking on my body. Miles 15-18 were more challenging than my training. I ran out of muscle energy, but my heart and lungs felt fine, and my mind was clear. It felt like I was going uphill the whole time. I missed the hail since I was pretty far behind.\n\nBy mile 20, I new my pace goals were a bust. But I didn't stop. I gritted my teeth and kept pushing, fueled by the adrenaline and whatever the willpower I had remaining. My pace went way off mark. My new goal was to try to finish under 5 hours. I ran along the 4:50 pacer at mile 21, and as you can see by the split time, the conversation actually made this much more bearable. I tried to distract myself from the pain by focusing on the surroundings and taking in the beauty of the course.\n\nMiles 22-26 were a blur of agony. My muscles started to cramp, first just a little bit, but then all kinds of muscles I didn't even know existed started to cramp. Every step felt like torture, but I refused to give up. I didn't stop or walk aside from brief moments tending to the cramps. It felt like an eternity. I managed to make it to the finish line somehow and cramped right as my name was announced. I finished it.\n\n### Post-race\nCrossing the finish line was a moment of triumph for me. I had trained hard, and despite the challenges, I had managed to finish the marathon. I felt a bit sour that I missed all my goals. \n\nI felt horrible for the entire evening. My legs barely worked. I had a fever, shivers, and cramps. It felt like one of the worst flus I've ever had. I couldn't sleep or nap, but it was worth it. I slept it off, and today, aside from super sore legs, I feel pretty great.\n\nLooking back, I realize that my training was not enough. I needed to add cross and strength training to better prepare myself for the marathon's demands. And while I don't plan to run a marathon anytime soon, I know that I will continue to run smaller races and push myself to new heights.\n\nDespite all this, I'm extremely proud. Feels pretty crazy I was able to do this.\n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http:\/\/sfdavis.com\/racereports\/) created by \/u\/herumph.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1678142370.0},{"title":"Went through hell during my first half marathon - don't follow my example","author":"gemag","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11jwwy6\/went_through_hell_during_my_first_half_marathon\/","text":"*tldr: Got food poisonned the night before the race. Ran the race anyway. I suffered from the first to the very last km. Don't follow my example, listen to your body.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Context:\n\nI am a french guy in my mid-thirties, and have been running for 10+ years, never at a very high pace though. I was not looking for performance but just a way to stay fit. Recently, a long time friend came with the idea of running the half marathon of Paris. I said yeah good idea, let's do this.   \nI, therefore, started to train properly. I was able to finish a 19km trail a few weeks ago in 1h48 without pushing too much. Not great but decent. My objective for the half marathon was sub 2h00  \n\n\nThe day before the race I took the train to Paris. We met some friends (not runners) over there. They kindly offer to host us. We all went out for dinner thay night . I was in bed around 11:30pm.\n\nI woke up a first time around 2am and I directly felt that I was not feeling that good. I had issues digesting the food we had for dinner. I tried to stay in bed but the situation didnt get better and I ended up vomitting everything. I tried to sleep again but I was not feeling great overall.   \n\n\n# The race: \n\nThe alarm was set  a 7:30m, and we were supposed to start the race at 10:13am. I don't feel great when I woke up, still having nausea. I was not feeling hungry at all but nevertheless ate a banana to get a bit of energy. Now comes the question: shall I do the race or not?   \nI was not feeling super comfortable giving up since both my friend and I did a long trip to attend the race. I was not great but I was not bedridden neither so I decided to give it a try anyway.   \n\n\nThe weather was pretty cold that day (3 celscius), and despite having several layers of clothes (much more than usual) I was already freezing when we were waiting on the start line.   \n\n\nThe race starts, and after about 300m I started to have a side stitch. I told my friend to not wait for me and I  decided to slow down, but this damn side stitch continued to bother me until the end of the race. With hindsight, I think that I was still not able to digest the breakfast banana causing a conflict between an unusual request of blood from the stomach, and an enhanced request of blood from the legs.   \n\n\nThings just got worse km after km. I had side stitch, stomach pain and I was running at a pace of around  7mins per km, well below my regular 5:40. All the other runners were overtaking me, which was kind of demotivating and reinforce the feeling of pain and distress.   \n\n\nI don't know exactly why but I didnt want to give up so I tried to set some kind of short term objectives to finish the race. Run until the next drink and food and then walk for about 2 mins. Following this strategy, I was able to finish the race in 2h28, far far beyond my initial objective\n\nAfter the race, I felt terrible for about 1h. Was pretty close to faint I think. I started to get some energy back after a good shower and a bit of sleep. I still feel a bit nauseous today but it is ok-ish.\n\n# Lesson learned:\n\nDespite being somehow proud of being able to finish the race under those conditions. I won't do this again. What was supposed to be a celebration race with lot of fun and people cheering turned to be a nightmare. 2h30 of pure suffering.   \nNext time I will listen to my body more carefully, and follow the well-known rule, **if you're stomach sick, just don't run.**","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1678103992.0},{"title":"First Official 5K - Cto5k with only 2.5 months - Complete beginner","author":"Almighti_Zeus","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11kfsrp\/first_official_5k_cto5k_with_only_25_months\/","text":" Race Information\n\n* **Name:** Chattahoochee Road Race \n* **Date:** March 4th 2023\n* **Distance:** 3.1 Miles\n* **Location:** Sandy Springs, Ga\n* **Website:** [https:\/\/www.crrrace.com\/](https:\/\/www.crrrace.com\/)\n* **Strava:** [https:\/\/www.strava.com\/activities\/8662136878](https:\/\/www.strava.com\/activities\/8662136878)\n* **Time:** 29:31 | 9:30 pace | 172 SPM cadence\n* **Goal:** Get under 30 minutes and beat my previous first time 5K ran at 34:50 on 02\/04\/23 at 10:42\/m pace and beat average cadence of  155-160 SPM.\n\n **History and experience:**\n\nI'm about 185 lbs at 5'9\". Muscular build as I used to train hard\/bodybuild about 8 years ago. Absolute ZERO cardio. I used to hate cardio and never did it even when I did bodybuilding. I despised it and hated running because the only time I was pushed to run mile in highschool one time I ran it in 18 minutes because I had horrible shin splints. Little did I know I didn't know how to \"run\" and was heal striking like mofo. The only time I ever ran before that was in elementary school for the P.E mile test and I ran a 6:50 or so. Thanks to David Goggins books and stories I set a goal to run an 100 mile ultra in 2024 and I started a couch to marathon training program at the end of December last year in 2022. Once again I started with no idea how to run and could barely run 1 minute 30 seconds without being gassed. 3 weeks ago I was constantly running into IT band issues and pain after my runs to the point I couldn't jog down the block. It would go away after a few days but it was pissing me off. I did a lot of research and decided to switch to barefoot shoes. My first run I never experienced anymore knee discomfort\/swelling\/tightness feeling at the end of my runs anymore. Not only that my calves were firing like never before and it was the best thing I ever did. I'm all in on the barefoot movement and I've been running in the Xero HFS runners. My Cto5k consisted of running 3x a week since starting in late December. Two weeks before my race I decided to spend more time in Zone 2 with a 145 BPM or less. So I began doing 60 minutes of total cardio a day outside of my runs at 145 BPM or less on the elliptical. On my run days since it would last about 25-30 minutes I would still do another 30 minutes of elliptical in zone 2. I'm 100% committed to doing an hour of cardio every single day moving forward since it's really lowering my HR much quicker than waiting to run 3 days a week. \n\n**Day before race day:**\n\nThe day before I decided to go out for a test run of a faster race pace using a metronome to try running at a 180 BPM cadence. Looking over my past runs in the months of January and February my average cadence fell between 145-155 BPM. My best run until that point was around a 155-160 cadence. I ended up going out this run and ended up injuring my lower left calf. It was fine during the run but after I stopped I felt severe tight and stiffness and I knew I had injured it. I had to stop .06 miles in because I couldn't catch my breath and I was running way too hard. I was on my way of hitting my mile PR at 8:30 had I finished one but I was so gassed and my heart rate was 175-180BPM. My prior best pace was a 9:40 so this was new territory for me. I didn't sleep the night prior and had been up all night (insomnia) and wasn't properly hydrated and I was also basically fasted. I think that had a lot to do with it. I also think the cause of my injury was leaning a bit too far forward and it cause way too much of an angle and flexion of my calf muscle. Combine this with running 180 BPM for the first time ever from the 150's I was asking to get hurt somehow. I also didn't properly warmup either. Now that I'm thinking about it I should have put in a mile warmup at the very minimum at my comfortable easy pace. This would of allowed me to have warmed up sufficiently for the new cadence and fastest pace I've ever put in to that day.\n\n**The night and morning of race day:**\n\nThe day before I made sure to eat plenty of carbs and drank tons of water. Definitely had to force more water than normal just to be safe. I ate my regular diet of normal clean food like rice, pasta, tilapia, chicken, egg sandwich. I fell asleep around 3am-ish and woke up at 5:30 to have time to eat 1.5 hours minimum and hydrate. I ate a egg sandwich with cheese the morning of and drank tons of water and had a nice black coffee. \n\n**The Race:**\n\nGot to the race, and tried to stretch as best I could prior as I could feel the tenderness in my lower left calf. Unfortunately we were running late to the start line and couldn't get our heart rate high enough. I made sure to do run in place with a metronome in my ears at 170 BPM instead of 180 BPM like yesterday and shut it off before kickoff. Race started out nicely.. But after about 5 minutes in my right front shin started getting tight. It\u2019s the same familiar tightness that had I increased my pace or happened to heal strike at any point it would be so pumped and splint up that I would have had to pull over or race in absolute agony. I unfortunately had to focus the entire race on having the upmost proper form and relaxing my lower body as best as possible to avoid shin splits. My left shoe also became untied and I ran a entire mile on it before I had to pull over and spend about 15-20 seconds tying it and getting back to speed. Surprisingly my lower left calf didn't start to be uncomfortable and painful till the last 1k stretch downhill where it was really pushed in the pain cave. I felt grate the entire race cardio wise. I was getting enough oxygen with my breaths and my breathing was pretty quick all through the mouth. Definitely hard enough to where I could only talk about 3-4 words in a sentence at a time before needing to gasp for more air. But I felt really good. To lower the stiffness in my right shin so I didn't catch a splint I consciously thought of driving higher into the air with my knees ever so slightly. This surprisingly worked and took my 6-7 out of 10 stress and effort on my right shin down to like 3 out of 10.. Almost felt like it wasn't there. However the thing about shin pumps is once you get them started its near impossible to get it to a 0 out of 10 again unless you stop and fully recover. Luckily I didn't get any worse and sat in that 5-7 out of 10 pain level.. When normally when I run properly out the gate it's just nonexistent. Landing forefood\/midfoot has allowed this to happen and I'm glad I learned proper form when I started back late December\/early January. It's a real bummer I pushed too hard the day before because I could have definitely pushed the pace into the mid to higher 8:00's but if I did I would of certainly caught a shin split in that right calf and would have to pull over. Nevertheless I sprinted down the hill which really took a toll on my injured left calf but we crossed the finish line at 29:30. Best feeling ever. I forgot to mention I clocked in new PR of 172 SPM!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Post Race:**\n\nI was limping from my left lower calf strain up until today. I've also been icing it 3x a day for 20 minutes and stretching it here and there and rolling it out. I think about a weeks rest I'll be 100%. For now I'll continue my hour of daily cardio on the elliptical in Zone 2 and I'm beginning to weight train again which I'll do before my cardio. Lesson learned is don't push pace the day before as a quick test and do it without a warmup mile at an easy pace.. and also of course eat, sleep, and hydrate.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1678140600.0},{"title":"Run Nutrition Tuesday","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11kprv1\/run_nutrition_tuesday\/","text":"**Rules of the Road**\n\n1)  Anyone is welcome to participate and share your ideas, plans, diet, and nutrition plans.\n\n2)  Promote good discussion.

This was my second time using it and I had pretty solid results the first time out. Realistically I know that if i want to get faster, I will need a more focused program. But I knew what I was using, I was able to stick with it (barring some issues with weather here in Cali) and didn't miss too many days. I had some issues with fueling during long runs and that lead to some issues on race day, another area that I know i will need to tackle if I want to get faster.\n\n## Pre-race\n\nScrewed up my hotel booking so I had to make the 90 min drive the morning of. Made it to the parking lot and onto the busses without much fuss. Then it rained. Rain was in the forecast and this race always has unpredictable weather. It rained up until about an hour before race start. Did my warm ups, dropped my gear bag and got into place near the pacers for 4:20. Then it started raining again. Fortunately I had a poncho so I slipped that on along with some gloves, and we were off.\n\n## Race\n\nThe course is a net downhill which is a phrase I hate. Its pretty much rolling hills on a downward slant for the first 20 miles. \n\nMile 1-5\n\nIt rained. I kept up with the pacers here but they were inconstant with their timing and splits. Additionally, they would stop, not slow, at aid stations. Eventually I stopped looking at the pacers and just found someone who was running at my projected pace and used them. \n\nMile 6-10\n\nRain stopped and I was able to ditch the poncho. Felt good but the air was a bit cold. More rolling hills and I felt like I was banking good time coming up to the halfway point. Given the 4:20 pacers practice of stopping at aid stations, I was now running ahead of them (except for one of them who stopped being a pacer and just took off).\n\nMile 11-15\n\nFeeling pretty good at the halfway point and comfortable with the group I was running with. The crowds come and cheer you on at intersections since that is the only access crowds really have to the course. I had a slight fueling issue where I think I took too many fluids and have to make a quick restroom stop. \n\nMile 16-20\n\nHere the course gives up all notion of rolling hills and it just feels like you run up hill from mile 17.5 through 20.1. I knew it was coming, but by this point the sun was up and I was starting to bake a little bit. Rolled up my sleeves (literally) and did my best on that climb.\n\nMile 21 - 26\n\nCresting the hill at the end of mile 20 and I hit what felt like a wall of wind. This is probably the hardest section of the course mentally. It is long, straight, flat, and unremarkable. There are a few turns onto different streets but its one section around 2.5 miles, then another section about 1.75 miles. Its hard to sight objects and between the wind and rumbling stomach (see fueling issues) I had a hard time here. \n\nJust before mile 25 there were two guys in the road, one laying down and the other trying to help him. I checked in to see if they were just having a quick stretch, but the guy on the ground was not ok. I ran back about a tenth of a mile to flag down an officer. Once the officer was able to help the injured runner I kept going. At that point I was passed by the pacers and I figured I was SOL. I made peace with that, pulled my long sleeve over my watch and just told myself I would finish as best I could. For the last mile or so I just adopted the mantra \"fuck you wind, Fuck you rain\".\n\nFinish\n\nThe last half mile or so is through a random housing area. People come out and cheer more here. It was uplifting and while I knew I wasn't going to make my time, it felt good to stretch out my legs and run a bit faster. I crossed the finish line and stopped my watch but refused to look at it for a few minutes. When I finally looked down and saw I made my goal by 15 seconds I had a bit of a laughing cry.\n\n## Post-race\n\nNot much to say here. Hobbled over to my mom who came down to see me finish. Took the usual banana and went to get my gear. My feet looked like hell but nothing unexpected (still have all my toenails for now).\n\nI've run this race before but I might be done with it after this time. The weather can be very random and inhospitable. I want to try a few different races that are in March. Hopefully I can make it to LA in 2024. Next up is SFO (again) in July. I didn't get into NYC so I will probably do CIM in December.\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http:\/\/sfdavis.com\/racereports\/) created by \/u\/herumph.","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1678134950.0},{"title":"Tuesday Shoesday","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11kprum\/tuesday_shoesday\/","text":"Shoes are a big topic in this sub, so in an effort to condense and collect some of these posts, we're introducing **Shoesday Tuesday**!

Side note: trying to BQ in New York is dumb. All my pace and HR targets were set with 3:20 in mind, the BQ time for my age group previously.\n\nUnlike my first BQ attempt I went into the plan with a much better aerobic base thanks to six months of consistent 50-60k weeks at an easy Z2 with LRs up to 24k. I rarely drop below 40k\/wk at any time during the year. \n\nRight off the bat the MP efforts during LRs were just brutal and really discouraging and recovery was a bitch. However I was doing much better at the VO2 Max workouts which was encouraging. \n\nDid a bit of injury management to deal with some niggles that I wanted to nip in the bud (getting old sucks) so had to skip a LT workout but I don\u2019t feel like it hurt me at all. Where I feel I need to do better is to do some strength training but recovery was already challenging halfway through the program. The workouts mostly seemed easier but the recovery got a lot harder. Really needed to focus on getting off my feet, easing back on  other activities and adding naps. Let me repeat, getting old sucks. \n\n### Pre-race\nPre-race got off to an inauspicious start as I got food poisoning the night before boarding a trans-pacific flight on Tuesday. By Thursday I was finally able to manage plain bread and plain rice and managed to start a proper carbo-load for Fri\/Sat. Also made the mistake of inviting the elderly parents along and spent way too much time on my feet playing tour guide instead of resting. Only managed to get in one shakeout run on the Thursday as my feet and legs were just too beat from sightseeing. \n\nDid the expo early on the second day and it was a breeze. For the organizers touting being paperless I sure ended up with a lot of junk flyers. \n\nThe start area was a bit chaotic but manageable if you left yourself enough time.  I had previously posted asking for recommendations for staying warm in the corrals which was definitely needed as despite a manageable 7c there was a cold breeze blowing through that was unpleasant. Luckily the race organizers recanted on the no throwaway clothing policy and provided bins. I ended up using an old base layer and a space blanket. \n\n### Race\nI have a bad habit of going out too fast and spiking my heart rate and never getting it back down and blowing up early. This time I really made a point to ease into it and sacrifice pace to maintain a sustainable HR. \n\nThe first 5k has a slight downhill which is nice. Crowds were thick but manageable at the start which helped keep my pace in check (my first km was 20sec off target). The next 15k were nice and easy and legs and HR felt good although I was about 3-5 sec\/km off my goal pace. Hit the halfway mark feeling the best I\u2019ve ever felt. Seeing the elites pass by on one of the out and back sections was humbling. \n\nI run fasted but for nutrition I was alternating Maurten Caf with regular Gu every 9k. Took in way more water than previous races which also helped. \n\nCrowd support was enthusiastic alongside plenty of taiko drummers, school bands and dance troupes. There were so many Mario and Luigi\u2019s on the side of the course! \n\nBy 25 some soreness was creeping in and everything started to hurt by 34k and my HR was creeping past my estimated LT. The last out and back is frustrating as you watch others on their final 5k while your own turnaround point is not in sight yet you\u2019re getting farther and farther away from the finish line. By 39 everything was on the verge of cramping and I was just holding on to try get to the finish. HR was spiking close to my estimated max too. The crowds were thick for the last km and really helped give energy for the final push. Managed to hang it out, cross the finish and didn\u2019t immediately keel over which is a plus. \n\n### Post-race\nWhile I didn\u2019t hit my A goal (my previous age group\u2019s BQ cutoff), getting older bumped me into the next age category which bought me 5 minutes so I should be good with a 2:30 buffer. Hooray for getting older! Also 11min PR!\n\nStopped off for my traditional post-race Shake Shack extravaganza (not available in my country and a fav treat whenever I travel) and stumbled back to the hotel for a much needed Theragun session, shower and a nap. \n\nTokyo put on a fantastic race and it\u2019s got its own unique vibe compared to the other majors.

Two marathons and four halfs in the span of about 2.5 years. I was confidently running half marathons in 1:53. 1:51, etc., and banging out random 10Ks in 50-52 minutes and not feeling all that winded afterwards.\n\nThat was then. This is now. Three years without running much at all \u2013\u00a0I finally got back in the saddle when my friend pinged me last year and invited me to join him in the BAA half marathon last November.  [Here's the report from that race](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/yv5lks\/race_report_baa_half_marathon\/). Was feeling a bit stoked about it and he suggested we do another half, this one in Hyannis in Cape Cod. I of course said yes right away, thinking this would be a great continuation of my return to running shape. And I had in my mind that the race would be at the end of March (see how I'm foreshadowing here?).\n\nSo... I just got right back into the normal training. Tuesdays were the hard sprints and strides. I live at the end of a cul de sac, and from my house all the way to the entrance to my neighbourhood with a minor detour is almost exactly half a mile or the equivalent of two laps around a track. So that was a perfect setup for Yasso 800s \u2013\u00a0basically run hard for .5 mile\/800 metres, bring pulse rate back down to relatively normal, then repeat for a total of six or eight times. (Mind you, I used to do TEN in one training session\u00a0\u2013\u00a0getting to six is now a real chore).\n\nThursdays would be like a mid-tempo, mid-long distance run. I've figured out a route around my area that comes to almost exactly 10K so I would run moderately hard for that whole 10K. I mentioned above how I would do 10Ks in 50-52 minutes? A 10K now would be a good hour \u2013\u00a0but I was getting that down to around 54-55 minutes or roughly 8:45-8:50 per mile. That was a good benchmark to work from.\n\nAnd then on Saturday and sometimes Sunday, I'd do my long run. Sometimes it's a broken effort of roughly 8 miles on Saturday and 6-7 miles on Sunday, or a full 10-12 miles in one day and rest up the next day. \n\nIn between all of that, I'm supposed to do jump lunges, calf raises, and other good leg and body exercises, but I didn't do any of that this time.\n\nThe training went really well, I'll tell you that. But halfway through the training, I somehow found out that race day was actually 3-4 weeks \\*earlier\\* than I had originally planned for. Why I didn't know that before? I'm an idiot, I suppose. These are things that slip my mind.\n\nAnd then three weeks before race day, my wife had to head to Canada for some immigration stuff that couldn't wait and could not be done remotely. So that was an emergency trip that meant I was home with our younger son for 10 full days \u2013\u00a0in the middle of school vacation week. Pretty much every single one of those days was just me and him. I tried for playdates but everyone was away on their own trips so I was on my own. So no running at all during this time. I got in a good 4 miler just after dropping my wife at the airport and before picking up my son at school, and then a 4 miler just after she returned, and that was already race week for me.\n\nSo... proper training regimen broken up by bad scheduling \\*and\\* three weeks of very little-to-no training up to race day. \n\nSo... let's get on to the race!\n\n\\### Pre-race\n\nI primed for the race with a massive pasta supper the night before and went to bed early. However, I couldn't get to sleep for a couple of hours, and then my son came into our bed waking me up in the middle of the night. Got up and went to sleep in \\*his\\* bed... all the usual stuff that comes with being a dad, I'm sure many of you can relate. :)\n\nHad oatmeal for breakfast (my standard pre-race meal) and then hit the road for the 1h45m trip to Cape Cod. It was my first time ever going to Cape Cod so it was kind of exciting for me. Got there well ahead of the starting time, and met up with my friend. We picked up our race packets, got primed and ready, warmed up, everything.\n\nWeather was quite optimal. Maybe a bit of a chill in the air, but gets warm when the sun breaks through the clouds. I'd say about 4-5C (or mid-high 30s for those who do freedom units!). \n\nI also noticed a huge group of young, very fit-looking runners all clad in the same red outfits \u2013\u00a0they were the Northeastern track team. I was very curious about them. Stay tuned for that!\n\n\\### Race\n\nThe gun goes off! Roughly 600-700 of us hit the pavement all psyched and everyone cheering us on. It's a nice little moment where everyone's in a great mood, everyone's excited and raring to go. \n\nYou know that feeling where you know how the race will go based on those first couple of miles? Yep. First 5-6 miles for me was fantastic. My legs felt all limbered up because we had been doing so much dynamic warming up beforehand, and my body felt strong and ready. I usually find the first mile to be the one where I'm just finding my bearings, but this time I almost immediately settled into a comfortable 8:45-8:50 mpm pace and it felt \\*just right\\*. Like, it felt really, really good.\n\nI really wanted to break that 2-hour barrier \u2013\u00a0this was a major goal of mine this time, because I was at about 2:07 in Boston last fall and wanted to at least improve significantly on that. And besides, all my halfs before this were sub-2, and I wanted to show that I could return to that form quickly. So in my mind, it was just important to stay at 9 mpm or below that for the whole race so that I could easily break 2 hours.\n\nWell... what was nice was I did not even look at the distance on my watch for the longest time. Only at the pace. Until my eyes slipped for the first time and I saw that I was already at roughly 4.25 miles \u2013\u00a0not bad. I mentally absorbed that as one third of a race \u2013\u00a0so just two more of these and then I'm done. \n\nThat's kind of how I process distances. It's easier to break it down into pieces and chapters than it is to say, \"Aw dang it \u2013\u00a0just 12 more miles to go...\"\n\nNow, it was a nice run. It took us past the JFK memorial and, I found out later, his actual house where he lived. His father Joe's house just around the corner as well. Yes, we're talking real Kennedy stuff, but you wouldn't know it from going through these neighbourhoods \u2013 they were just nice coastal hoods but not the mansion stuff that you might expect from such a highly regarded family.\n\nAnyway \u2013 back to the run: something happened around mile 7. I don't know what it was, but I started to feel fatigued. It was like one minute I was happily skipping along at 8:50 per mile, and then suddenly found myself struggling up hills and falling to 9;30 and working to get back to 8:50.\n\nAnd then the nausea. I started to feel kind of weird and running out of fuel very quickly. More quickly than it should. It was as if I went from \"easy Sunday run\" mode to \"21st mile of marathon\" mode from one mile to the next.\n\nI pressed on, feeling a little bit worried. OK, at least if I can stay at 9:10 or so, maybe I can still hit that two-hour mark. But it felt like such a struggle. I found it very daunting. A few years ago, a half was a weekend activity for me \u2013\u00a0now, suddenly, I feel like I'm at the tail end of a marathon that I hadn't trained for. I started to fall... 9:30... 9:40... 9:45 per mile. Tried vainly to pick up my pace but falling back again and again. And starting to feel that worried doubt \u2013\u00a0if I try and pick up my pace, do I crash and burn and not be able to continue? I couldn't forgive myself for that. So I negotiated in my head: maybe it's better to just try and keep a relatively comfortable pace even if it's a struggle, and finish the fucking race before I collapse.\n\nI will say there were strong moments where I felt like I was going to vomit. The sea air didn't help. The cold air was making my legs feel uncomfortably stiff. Those last five miles were just grueling. Difficult, horrible, sickening. \n\nI finally made it to the finish line, and on crossing, I just had to find somewhere to sit down. And sit down I did, my head in my hands and me panting like I had just finished a Yasso 800. Feeling very, very queasy and faint. Bright lights were far brighter than they normally should be. \n\nI don't know what it is. My stupidity, my stubbornness, my lack of training or whatever \u2013\u00a0this was not my best race by a long shot. But I will consider it a small victory that I did not stop running at all. It's like Jake LaMotta in Raging Bull \u2013\u00a0\"You didn't knock me down, Ray! You didn't knock me down!\"\n\n2:02. It's just two minutes over the two-hour mark... but whatever. It's another half for the books.\n\n\\### Post-race\n\nWell. Now it was time to get some water which I did but it's that kind of situation where you desperately need water but you're careful to drink it because you worry you'll just puke it back up. Not at all a good situation. Now time to wait for my friend... finally saw the poor bugger cross at around 2:20. He was even more undertrained than I was, and his lower back started to hurt very badly around 5-6 miles (at which point I passed him, apparently) and he had to pull over and walk a couple of miles. \n\nNow I mentioned the Northeastern track team? Turns out they were on a marathon relay, four to a team. When waiting for my friend, I saw one of them coming around the home stretch like a godamn gazelle to win the relay at 2:17. That's 2:17 for a marathon \u2013\u00a0yes, it's a relay, but still, wow. You don't really realize how fast those athletes can run until you've seen them in person running right by \"normal\" runners like us. This guy was FAST. I'm still amazed even now.\n\nAnyway, that's it. My friend and I started talking about another half down the stretch and agreed we would not even talk about it at that point. We were both suffering too much. He immediately went home, and I just drove around Hyannis and Barnstable to take in some of the sights. Got another look at JFK's old house, went to walk around the memorial, checked out a couple of the windswept beaches which were wonderfully deserted and tranquil. \n\nAnd then I got myself a blue cheese bacon burger to bring my cholesterol levels back up, and then drove home. \n\nToday, one day later, I am stiff. And I'm tired. Even just a little bit nauseous still. I have lots of IPAs in the fridge, and it feels so good to not have to stick to a training diet just for awhile.\n\nNow my friend and I have more or less agreed we're not doing any more of these stupid half marathons until the fall. But we're now talking about doing one of these relays which would be just a touch more than 10K each for a team of four.

I'm 38 years old now, have a fairly stressful and demanding job, and I guess I felt like the scale was reflecting that a bit. The question in my mind, though, was where to start? I haven't been to a gym in probably 10 years, haven't played any sports since high school. I did some hikes a few years back (maybe 2019-2020?) the longest was Half Dome in Yosemite, but those didn't really require much training other than walking local bridges here in Florida. So I wanted to do something that would help me lose a few pounds and would be convenient for me in light of demanding work and family obligations.\n\nRunning ticks all those boxes, BUT, I have had lower back pain since college when trying to run anything more than a quarter mile or so. I heard about the C25K app and thought I would just give it a try and see if I could get through it. I started the program July 6, 2022 and finished it on August 26, 2022. I am fairly amazed how it eased my body into running and helped me go from literally nothing to 5K in two months. So, I figured, why not start the C210K app, right? Well, I realized at that point you have to pay for the app so I just switched over to Strava to log runs, but wasn't really following any programs. Just running 3 times a week for fun.\n\n### Injury\nI ran a local 5K race on December 3, 2022 and really pushed myself. I finished in 23 minutes and change and it felt like an all out sprint to me. Afterwards, I had pain in my right calf, behind my tibia, sometimes to the point where it was hard to even walk. I honestly felt at the time I had stress fracture(s) because the level of pain I would experience was unbearable at times. This is where I should have taken a few weeks off and let things heal and reset. But, I didn't. I decided then F-it, I might as well run a marathon. Either I'll work through the training and finish this thing, or my leg will be amputated. If could give one piece of advice to anyone new to running who experiences an early over-use injury -- back off and let it heal -- or continue running in pain and risk further injury like me. Luckily I didn't injury anything worse, but marathon training does not allow time to heal so it was just constant pain for me.         \n\n### Marathon Training\nI used the Nike Run Club app and selected the marathon training program. It's an 18 week program but I shortened to 14 since my weekly long runs were already 7+ miles. I liked it, since it integrated with my apple watch and they have guided runs for each run in the program if you wanted that. Best of all, it is completely free -- so bonus there. It's a 5 day per week plan, which I normally shortened to 4 and removed a recovery run somewhere, since I was dealing with right-leg pain throughout most of the training. My first child was born December 16, 2022, six weeks early (she's doing great!), so that also factored into dropping runs early in the training. Originally my plan was to run a race March 18, 2023 because that's when 14 weeks were up, but there are no marathons in Florida after early March because it's too damn hot, so I would have to travel out of state. And I didn't want to do that and leave my wife and newborn for an extended period so I selected, I think, the last marathon in Florida, which was the Marathon of the Treasure Coast on March 5, 2023. This of course meant I had to cut out another 2 weeks of training, so I ended up slicing it to 12 weeks in total. My training was probably averaged 30 miles per week and my longest run during training was 20 miles.           \n\n### Pre-race\nMy brother (decided he was going to run without any real training) and I drove 2.5 hours from the west to east coast of Florida and picked up my bib and packet late on Saturday afternoon. Stopped by the local Fresh Market and picked up a few items to eat pre race, then relaxed at the hotel for a few hours, before stuffing our face at the local Benihana. We were both asleep by 10pm and then awake at 4:30 for the 6:00 start time. I ate a gatorade gel, banana, and rice cake first thing in the morning when I woke up and drank some water and gatorade. Bathroom was crossed off the list shortly thereafter (this is a necessity!). Stretched lightly, and got to the race by about 5:30.     \n\n### Race\nRace went off promptly at 6:00 AM for the full marathoners. Temp at that time was about 60F with 93% humidity. I started with the 4:15 pacer, and tried to hold my pace back with her for about the first mile but I was feeling so good from the training taper that I decided I would let the big dog eat. The race winded through some residential areas and over a bridge into a really nice neighborhood with folks outside their houses cheering, shaking cattle bells, offering oranges and water, etc. Really cool. I had to stop and pee in a porta-potty which I thought was placed there for the race but I realized after it was a construction dumper next to a house being built, LOL. Oh well. I think that was around mile 10. The first half marathon was a breeze, I flew through it no problem. When you run the second bridge and get onto the island, it's nice but you lose shade around mile 15 or so. By mile 18, the sun was really starting to heat up and we had to run on the \"un-shaded\" side of the road on the way back. Mile 20-21 I started hitting the wall and had to run the 2 bridges back which was BRUTAL. When I cleared the second bridge which was probably mile 22 I was gassed. I saw the 4:15 pacer pass me at that point (without anyone with her) and just didn't have it in me to keep pace with her. It took every ounce of energy left in me to finish it in the time I did. It was hot. Really hot. 82F and 65% humidity at the time I finished.   \n\n### Post-race\nI received my medal when I crossed the finish line. Got a cold towl and water and gatorade and sit on a nearby bench in the shade for a bit. I called my wife and my parents and let them know I was done. My legs felt like jello so I crab walked to my car and headed back to the hotel where I showered and then headed back to the race to watch my brother finish with the 6:00 pacer. Once he was situated back at the hotel, we went to try and eat lunch and have a beer, but I didn't have much of an appetite. Got in the car and headed back home across the otherside of the state. \n\n### Final Thoughts\nI think 80+ degrees is probably too hot for a noob to try and run a marathon. I think I could have finished around 4:00-4:15 had I not died in the last 4 miles or so. I think mentally I was able to get passed the wall but physically it just felt too hot. Most of the DNFers dropped at mile 18 which is where the heat became a problem. That said, I probably could have trained longer and smarter. I should have taken a break and let my body heal from my right-leg injury and started a plan from the beginning. I could have done all 5 days of the training rather than cut some days out. I'll do this next time. I'm thinking I will take a week off and then do a few 20 mile weeks of easy runs and go from there. I'm thinking of doing an 18-22 week plan starting late summer and culminating in something late next fall (Philly marathon maybe?). We'll see. I ran this marathon as a challenge to prove to myself that I could do it. I did it. You can do it too. Just keep running.       \n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http:\/\/sfdavis.com\/racereports\/) created by \/u\/herumph.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1678131160.0},{"title":"Race day live tracking","author":"ntranov","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11kj5dq\/race_day_live_tracking\/","text":"I am running my first marathon soon and would like to have some kind of live tracking so my wife knows when I'm passing a certain spot and possibly snap a photo.

Less than two hours. Completed both! 1:53:27 was my final time!! :D**\n\nTraining\n\nUsed train as one to train for this one! I run three times a week and go to the gym four times a week. Always in the morning before going to work. TAO keeped ramping up the distance and recommended tappering for the last week (this scared me to death lol). Completed the training following the plan 100% and never missed any session.\n\nPre-race\n\nWoke up at 5:00. Race was at 7:45. Took a fast shower. Then breakfast (coffe with milk and two toasts with fruits). Half an hour before the race took a 500ml bottle of Powerade to fuel some sugar. Never did that for training but decided to try it for this race. Luckily, before the race was able to go to the bathromm for number two XD so everything was fine. Warmed up a little and here we go! Was really scared about the distance since (as i said) this was my first half!!\n\nRace\n\nI did it!! And surpassed my goals for the race so I am happy!!!! Was aiming for two hours at a 5:41 per KM pace (9.8 miles seconds per mile) and finished with an average 5 minutes and 28 seconds per KM! Rounded up to a 1:53:27 half marathon!! Almost seven minutes faster than what I anticipated.   \nFirst 4 miles: started with some pain on my left shinbone that scared the s\\*\\*\\*t out of me but luckily by mile 5 it started to decrease and by mile 6 was gone.  \nAfter that I just felt great!! Legs were felling very good (tapering FTW) and overall was feeling great. Great hydration across the circuit so I took little water (weather was really hot today) but was able to refresh my self and legs every 5K. Last two KM I was feeling great so I went a little faster than the start and did 4:46 on the last one. Arrived to the goal felling tired (dah) but overall in great shape!!\n\nPost-race\n\nFamily was waiting (wife and my 6 and 2 years old) so emotions rocketed in that moment. I'll never forget this race.  \n\n\nto those that took the time for this long happy-share post, and to this amazing subreddit that helped me with doubts and recommendations, thanks a lot!!!\n\nPS: sorry if some words are wrong or miss wrote.

I only ran once a 10k, in just under 45min more than 2 years ago.\nI trained using a french app, [Decathlon Coach](https:\/\/www.decathloncoach.com\/fr\/home\/), picking their plan : 10km in less than 40 minutes, 8 weeks training with 3 runs per week. Note that a prerequisite for that plan is to have run a 10km in under 45 minutes.\n\nThe training plan was quite classical, every week :\n* 1 MAS training (2x8x200m, 10x400m, ...)\n* 1 pace training (5x1000m, 3x2000m, 2x3000m, ...)\n* 1 long easy run (between 1h and 1h30 minutes long).\n\nI managed to skip only 3 runs on this whole training plan, not an easy feat with family's life. Also, I coupled this with a bit of a weight loss (-3.5kg \/ -7lbs).\n\n\n### Pre-race\nSo I just got back from a week of vacation in the mountains with my kids. No running at all, and quite a bit of eating, and I was a bit anxious that it would have ruined my preparation. The night before, I went to bed early, slept good, woke up and ate a fruit, a small bowl of sugarless cereals with almonds and dry fruits (less than 2 ounces). 2 cups of coffee and sipped 1l of water.  Was feeling light and ready to give my best, despite the week prior.\n\n### Race\n650 people were on the start line, I managed to weave up to the 6th row or so.\n\nFirst km, as always, was a bit too fast. I managed to pace myself down and not go faster than 3:51\/km (6:12\/mi). Second km went smoothly too, 3rd km not so much. See, I still cherished the hope to get under 39'. Alas, that would have meant a 3:54\/km (6:17\/mimes) average, which I realized I wouldn't be able to keep. So I accepted it and managed to go through the 4th and 5th more easily, but still fast enough to keep my average pace under 3:58\/km (6:23\/mi).\n\nKM 7 is where it hurt, I had to struggle to keep my pace up. I still managed to trick myself in maintaining that speed by :\n- trying to double breath to keep my hear rate a bit low\n- smiling. It takes my tension away and unclenches my body. It's a good tip when you're in that painful, twitched zone.\n\nA nice stuff about this race is that for the last km, organizer have you go into a plane museum and run under wings of planes (it takes place in Blagnac, home of Airbus, so you run next to The Concorde, an A400M, ...).\nThis is where I realized I was surrounded by very good runners, as all of them seemed to hit that nitro button on the last half km. I had to dig  a bit deeper to get that sprint out, and seeing the clock at 39' xx  helped me quite a bit.\n\n### Post-race\nFelt amazing, my heartrate quickly went down, I felt almost ready to go for another one.\nThat's a bucket list item I can now bar out !\nThanks for reading me, I've spent quite some time reading race reports here, and enjoyed the tips, tricks, words and moods that I got from them.

Skipped one Easy Run leading to the final week, where I went on a ski trip and didn't train (a mistake I will not make again), overall I skipped 2 Easy Runs and 1 Tempo Run in the final week leading to the event. Came back yesterday and decided to put in one extra Easy Run the day before.\n\nAs for nutrition I didn't do anything special but after Christmas I almost completely cut off alcohol while averaging 1 wine bottle per week before that (c'mon, I'm French). I have to say I will stick to it for the future, incredible change.\n\n### Pre-race\nWoke up at 5am, since I like to take my time in the morning and not rush. Had some cereals and a banana, went out after 7am. The race started at 8am for the elite, but my time was supposed to be at 08:46am, finally my small group started 08:49am (08:46am was the start time for sub-1:45, and they were letting groups of around 100-150 runners to start at the same time to make sure there was not too much congestion). Overall making it to the race section and entering the starting area was painless and without any problems.\n\n### Race\nThe temperature at the start was 3 degrees Celsius, the weather was ugly (no sun, sky was perfectly clouded). The parts we run through were not very interesting until the final 2-3 kilometers before the finish line i.e. outskirts of Paris + the Vincennes forest. There were not that many spectators until the final 1-1.5 kilometers (again, early + cold + bad weather + people mentioned Parisians are not really big into races, although there are quite a few runners here).\n\nI was confident in the Garmin plan + had the course pre-loaded into my watch together with pacing plan taking into account elevation changes. Decided to stick to it as much as possible and don't do crazy things. After a few kilometers I saw a sub-1:45 pacer so knowing my time goal I kept close, but finally decided to leave him, since the group around him was rather large and not overtaking.\n\nHad energy gels at 30, 60, and 80 minutes to time up with drink stations (I was thinking the third station will be at around 90 minutes mark, but it turned out to be earlier). I also saw only one food stand with some sugary food + bananas. Grabbed small bottle of water at each station to make it easier to ingest the gels (as with Paris marathon next month there are no energy drinks being served, only water).\n\nI have to say I definitely appreciated elevation-corrected pacing since two ascents were BRUTAL and I think it helped a lot I saw it coming by pace suddenly dropping 10 seconds per km.\n\n### Post-race\nGrabbed the medal and a small pack with food afterwards and freezing my ass off (sweat drying out + still 3 degrees Celcius) made it to the metro to get back home.\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http:\/\/sfdavis.com\/racereports\/) created by \/u\/herumph.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1678055266.0},{"title":"Achievements for Monday, March 06, 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11jp0cu\/achievements_for_monday_march_06_2023\/","text":"Hey runners, it's another day and it is time to post your accomplishments you'd like to share - big or small.\n\nNote: No need to preface YOUR accomplishments with something like, \"this may not be an accomplishment to most of you...\".

I find Runkeeper slightly easier to use but understand why people use NRC. It's free and widely accessible to lots of runners. The week before the race I didn't have the ability to run, which I think was a small setback that eventually lead to me not hitting my goal time of 2:15:00.\n\nThe race is 47.5 laps on a indoor track which I felt like the hardest challenge would be mental. Running the same thing over and over again with nothing different to see. Having my wife, son, and friend in the bleachers would be a nice reminder of why I enjoy running and it would be a one of a kind half marathon experience because they'd get to see me several times throughout compared to outdoor races.\n\n### Pre-race\nSlept well the night before, the race started at 9:30am, so I had plenty of time to get breakfast, warm up, and head down to the track. Due to the track nature of this race there wasn't really a way to warm up at the track with the previous heat going on right before ours, so I ran a few laps around my neighborhood. Temps were in the 30F range which I found to be quite chilly compared to what the track would end up being (around 55-60F). Ate a vanilla almond Rx bar and a slice of PB toast and drank lots of water. Got to the track about 25 minutes before the race started, got changed into race gear, and got to the start line.\n\n### Race\nStarted off slower, which I didn't mind and was intended as part of my race strategy. In order to hit my goal of 2:15:00, I'd need a 10:16\/mile pace throughout the race. I tend to start off way too fast and bonk early, so I wanted to make sure that I would have gas in the tank for later in the race. \nMiles 1-5 were a breeze. I found a old guy with grey hair who became the guy I tried to maintain pace with. Honestly, they can be the best type of pacer because they are so consistent. Around mile 6.5 I really started to cramp in my right leg, and that pain didn't really go away until the end of the race. I took GU energy gels during the race, which helped dramatically with that wonderful caffeine boost. 10 laps to go, a fellow runner introduced himself and so we stuck together and chatted as long as I could. We really helped each other push through. With the cramping near the end, I decided to walk for short amounts in the final 4 laps of the race. Walk 30 seconds then back to running until the leg wasn't happy anymore, then back to walk. The final lap I really tried to push and mostly ran\/sprinted which I am very happy with. I definitely felt like I gave the best I could on the day, which, no complaints about that.\n\n### Post-race\nTook some pictures celebrating the PR and then headed over to Solly's Grill for some burgers and fries. Fun to try a new (to me) burger spot and it was tasty!\nGot home and started writing out this race report with a beer so I don't forget all of the details from the race. Upon looking at my activity on my Apple Watch, it said that I ran 14.50 miles, but I am not sure how it tracks indoor races and so that may be the reason for the overage. Additionally, I ran the majority of the race on the outer lane of the track so, possibly that would skew the result into running more? I'm not sure, but overall feeling content and happy with the race.\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http:\/\/sfdavis.com\/racereports\/) created by \/u\/herumph.","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1677967463.0},{"title":"Official Q&A for Sunday, March 05, 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11io48s\/official_qa_for_sunday_march_05_2023\/","text":"With over 2,350,000 subscribers, there are a lot of posts that come in everyday that are often repeats of questions previously asked or covered in the FAQ.\n\nWith that in mind, this post can be a place for any questions (especially those that may not deserve their own thread).

The first race was a sub 3 hours pace through 22 miles and bonked hard. Probably pushed much harder than I should have. Had difficulty walking for a full week. The second race took it very easy. About a full min\/mi slower and still had to run\/walk a lot of the final 6 miles. Lots of slow build-ups to even feel comfortable starting a training plan again. About 8 weeks from the second race.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo about 12 weeks out from the Vegas half marathon I started Hansen's method marathon training program and skipped ahead to 12 weeks left with a few adjustments. I run easy on the days off, maxed the race pace training day to 7 miles at pace, and instead of switching from speed to strength I just stayed with speed days. Training went pretty well, but could not get my speed up to where I had been last fall. Doing a lot of my pace runs around 7:10. Had been doing 10+ around 6:50 in the fall. Final few weeks it all started clicking. The final speed day did 4x1 mi repeats at 6:15. Final pace day was an easy feeling 7 miles at 6:59 (10 miles total). Almost wanted to cancel the race and keep the training going for another 2 months to really make a run for some substantial gains because at this point I had no clue what kind of goals I even think are realistic since my training paces were an ever moving target as I recovered and built back up from Fall. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEventually, I decide I am happy to just go sub 1:30 and anything else is gravy. I definitely don't feel fully trained and am not anywhere near my peak. Because of this, I am still a little heavy. Probably 5 lbs overweight since I never added in a diet (never started counting calories\/macros, never cut out junk foods and booze, just kept training and eating by feel). I don't really start tapering until 3 days out. Basically just using this race as a pace day and getting back to a full training cycle by Tuesday. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\### Pre-race\n\nDrove out to Vegas the day before. The race is in the evening so I have about 30 hours until it starts. I go to the expo, go get some dinner, gamble a little, and have 2 beers. Definitely outside my normal routine, but hey it's Vegas and the race isn't until 4:30 pm. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSleep like a rock. Probably the best sleep I have ever had going into a race. No alarm clock, blackout curtain, no cat bugging me for food. Perfect. I am super worried about what to eat on race day. I can get a little upset stomach every once in a while during evening runs, so I decide to eat a bunch of fruit, a pastry, and energy bars for breakfast and lunch and not really have a full meal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI head out to the loading area about an hour prior to the blue group (first group) loading. Probably about 1.5-2 miles of walking to get to the loading area from my hotel. I warm up for about 10-15 minutes, use the restroom and then hear the blue group loading. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I have a complaint about this race, this system is not great. Group colors are based on an honor system of \"predicted finish time\" and probably include way too many paces. First, it's like waiting for a plane to load. Even though group 8 knows they aren't in group 1 they are still all at the front clogging up the line. All different colored bibs are hovering. They let the elites through, then a few minutes later blue. A lot of non-blues easily sneak through and a good portion of the blue bibs do not look like they are going to be keeping pace near most race group 1's. (But for now, I will give the benefit of the doubt). We move to another loading area and then finally to the start line. There are bathrooms near the start so I go one more time. Bad mistake, I end up at the back of the blue group for the start. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\### Race\n\nStart through mile 2.\n\nAs suspected the blue group pace is all over the place. 10 min\/mi and slower is not rare, the majority of people near the back of blue are probably slower than 9 min\/mi, and some people are walking after 1\/2 mile. Just a completely random grouping of people. It is medium tightly packed. Not a massive race where you are completely boxed in, but definitely a lot of weaving and slowing down for the occasional time you get stuck. I got off to a pretty slow start going through the first 2 miles. It's pretty cold for Vegas, probably low '50s. Ends up being a nice warm-up. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMile 3-9\n\nI feel great after 2 miles. Not sweating, HR is low (130's), breathing is calm and through the nose. The race starts to open up a bit and after the turnaround, I realize we had a headwind and were going uphill to start. I feel confident now I can have a nice race. I let my perceived effort increase a bit. Add in the tailwind and downhill the pace falls by over half a minute. Cruise control until mile 9, the crowd is great through most of it. I do a gel around mile 4 and mile 8.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMile 9-13\n\nA few turns and eventually we are running in the opposite direction. Headwind and uphill. The wind is loud and forceful as I come around the corner. I was not expecting this strong of a wind. It is taking a lot of effort to hold pace now. At this point, I realize I was coasting too much during the middle section and should have been pushing myself more. Definitely left some seconds, maybe minutes on the table. If I want to go sub 1:30 I am going to have to work hard now. After a mile or so I feel like I am pushing a borderline 5k pace effort to keep up. Eventually, we get back to the main part of the strip and the wind is stifled a little by the buildings, but I am still drafting as much as possible. It's really dark now and I am starting to get a little cold too. I push just a bit harder and finish strong at just under sub 1:30. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\### Post-race\n\nI walked back to my hotel, warmed up, got some food and some beers. Got back to easy running 2 days later. I am burnt out from full marathons, so focusing on the half and 10ks for now. I had lost some of my confidence during this mini cycle since it took me so long to recover from my last races. Moving forward with confidence from here still feeling strong. My next big goal is to hit 1:23:00 half and qualify for NYC Marathon for 2024. Maybe get down to 1:26-27 by summer and then 1:23 by end of the year.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1677715448.0},{"title":"Achievements for Thursday, March 02, 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11ftk33\/achievements_for_thursday_march_02_2023\/","text":"Hey runners, it's another day and it is time to post your accomplishments you'd like to share - big or small.\n\nNote: No need to preface YOUR accomplishments with something like, \"this may not be an accomplishment to most of you...\".

On Saturday the temps reached 80 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n### Training\nI signed up for this race, after the high of finishing a marathon, back in December, which gave me 8 weeks for training. My marathon pace was 11:00 min\/mi, and my goal for the marathon was to finish without hating it. Once I finished I wished I had pushed harder, so I wanted to push myself on the next race. I had a solid base from marathon training, and I figured I would be good, even with the quick turn around. I also am a pacer for a local running store's half marathon training group, mostly doing 11:30 min\/mi pace.  With marathon training I didn't do a lot of speed work, but I started getting back into it in January. My legs felt really strong! Could I aim for a PR at 2:07 or even 2-hour half?! For strength workouts I used Madeline Moves Endurance Program, which I really enjoyed. 2 weeks before the race I looked up the course. 509ft in elevation gain! Oh dear! My hilliest training runs were only 350ft. I did all of my lower body workouts and long runs, and then about 75% of all the other runs scheduled.\n\nWith the training group\/Madeline Moves my training plan looked like \n\nMON - Lower Body Workout \n\nTUES - 4 mi training group \n\nWED - 3 mi easy w\/ upper body workout\n\nTHURS - speed workout \n\nFRI - Rest (or easy 3 if I didn't get it in on Wednesday)\n\nSAT- Long Run with training group \n\nSUN - Rest\n\n### Pre-race\nI had Monday off for Presidents' Day, so I did a 3 mi test run with my outfit, shoes, and watch. I have a Garmin Forerunner 245, and wanted to tryout the PacePro feature to help me reach my goal. PacePro did great on my test run, and my outfit and shoes were all good. I had a work conference to go to the rest of the week, which was great, because it meant I could leave my running stuff at home and not be tempted. However, I was tempted to have 2 glasses of wine at the open bar (oops), but mostly stayed hydrated with water all week. I was really starting to freak out about the heat, with the temps getting into the 80's but I was reading sooo many inspiring reports from the Austin races. I live in the Jackson area, and so I went to the packet pickup after work on Friday. It was only a packet pickup, not an expo, which was a little disappointing but smaller races are great for PR-ing! \n\n### Starting Line\nBecause I live close and the packet pickup implied a smaller race, I had some false confidence going into the morning. Woke up 2 hours before, started drinking coffee and water, and did some stretching. I didn't leave my house until 30 minutes before the start (not recommended) and sped down the interstate playing some hype music. Parked 2 blocks away from the starting line with 8 minutes to spare. Jogged the 2 blocks as a warmup. Temp reads 64 degrees with 93% humidity - oh goodness. I have LMNT in my water bottle, for electrolytes, and they will have water every two miles on the course. I look around for a port-a-potty, don't see any. I think about squatting in some bushes but decide against it. There aren't any corrals, so it is just me and roughly 650 people at the start. I squeeze in between the 4-hour and 4.5-hour marathon pacers. Oh crap! I realize I left my headphones in the car, which was a bummer because I made a 2 hour playlist with the songs increasing bmp from 155 to 175 (mostly taylor swift) -  oh well. Okay 2 minutes away from 7:30, time to pull up PacePro on my watch. \n\n### Race\nDowntown - Miles 1 and 2\n\nGun goes off and as I cross the starting line I press start on my watch. There are the port-a-potties, on the other side of the start line, looks like I'll use those in 2 hours. Starting to run, and look down at my watch, it doesn't look like I started it, so I start to push all random buttons for anything. OH NO blue triangle of death. Panicked, I start the run on strava on my phone, and send to my husband so he can know when to meet me at the finish line. Keeping my eye on the 4-hour pacer I take off my watch and start pressing buttons. A miracle, the watch comes back online, I fire up the PacePro 3 blocks from the start. No clue how that will impact my time, but with the heat, maybe I just focus on a PR of 2:05. The first two miles in downtown Jackson isn't bad, I'm familiar with the route. A little bit of uphill parts and lots of shade from the tall buildings. Because there weren't any corrals the first 2 miles is a lot of weaving and passing people, finding my pace, and finding others with my pace. I watch the 4-hour marathon pacer get out of my reach, as I make it to the first music group at the 2-mile mark.\n\nJackson State - Miles 3 through 5\n\nWe ran through 4 round-a-bouts on the outskirts of JSU campus. The crowds were pretty good, for a smaller race. It seemed like local crossfit or other workout teams set up cheer stations along the route. I saw a guy with a red shirt and a grey beard looking to cheer for his loved one. The hills are starting to get tougher, and we are running straight west with the sun on our back. Mile 3.6 we turn around and go back the way we came with the tough hills, but the sun in our face. The turnaround is a boost because I can say hello to some of my friends behind me. I start to make friends while running. One guy lives in a building in downtown Jackson, so he does this route frequently, but he runs at night, so he isn't used to the heat. One lady is from Atlanta, I tell her I would like to run races in a later time zone, so I don't have to wake up so early. At mile 5, we run past the first music stop again, and hit the crowds doing the 10k and 5k. Back to the weaving through the race.\n\nState Street pt 1 - Miles 6 through 8\n\nAt mile 6 we split off from the 10k and 5ks and head North on State Street to Fondren. The course wasn't the best marked and a lady I made friends with almost missed the turn. She was from outside of St Louis, and we have both done the Go! St Louis race. There are 3 awful hills, and I am trying my best to conserve energy and go up them slowly and then let gravity do all the work coming down. There is a band at mile 7, and I remember to take some gummies. Saw red-shirt-guy again! Wow he is dedicated! At this point I start to notice I'm chaffing in my armpits. Unless I am passing someone, I stay on the white line basically running in the storm drain, trying to stay in any available shade. At the mile 8 water stop I grab a cup of water; cold water is so good. Remember how I needed to use the restroom at the beginning? It all comes out on a big downhill. Can anyone notice? Hopefully not. We are all dead from those hills and maybe it just looks like sweat - fingers crossed. At this point, I forget all manors and just start playing music from my phone in my belt. \n\nFondren Neighborhood - Mile 9\n\nMile 9 we turn to go into Fondren Neighborhood (one whole mile uphill). I forgot that I know the people in the first house! The whole family is out in the driveway. It takes effort but I yell hey, but don't stop. It is taking all my energy not to stop and walk. One family has their kids passing out gummy bears - how sweet! I want the kids to feel liked they helped so I grab a pack but save it for after. The neighborhood is shaded, which is refreshing but still uphill. At Mile 10 we turn and are out of the neighborhood.\n\nState Street pt 2 - Mile 10 to Finish\n\nStill going uphill and into the restaurant part of Fondren, and we are back in the sun. Going up the hill I start to walk. I'm so mad at myself for walking. I didn't walk at all in the marathon 2 months ago, but the heat is killing me (more on this in post-race). At the 10-mile water stop I grab 2 waters, one to drink and one to pour on my head. Red shirt guy again! We have to go through the same 3 awful hills to get back to the finish. The sun is blaring down on us, I can feel my form deteriorate. I notice the ambulances are now patrolling the route, and we see one about every 5 minutes. Now my only goal is to finish (PR out of the question). I start walking all the uphills and running the downhills. I make a new friend, a girl in a grey shirt. We are too tired to talk but we run\/walk together (She must like taylor swift). I don\u2019t even remember passing the band at mile 11. 12-mile water stop, I grab 2 cups again, one to drink and one to cool me off. Surely, I can run the last mile (wrong). My husband is at mile 12.5. I am so happy to see him, but I apologize to him and start walking right in front of him. I tell him I\u2019m dying, but he is encouraging and says he\u2019ll see me at the finish. He has a cooler with a bunch of drinks and extra shorts for me waiting at the end. He really is the best. Last quarter mile of the race, I suck it up. I can hear the finish line, and see the last turn. I can finish strong! I know there is chocolate milk and cold water waiting for me. Begging for the race to be over I give the last kick everything I have. I see my husband again and wave to him. I cross the finish line and I can\u2019t tell what the clock says.\n\n### Post-race\nI immediately head for some shade, sit down. I have a mango juice, and my husband finds me some water, then after the water, I have the chocolate milk. My watch says 2:07:14, but I don\u2019t how much I missed in the beginning. The temps are about 75, and there isn\u2019t much shade. I end up taking a couple of pictures, swinging by the food tent and head home. I see red shirt guy again, he is the real MVP! As I get in my car, I tell my husband \u201cI\u2019m never running a race again.\u201d He laughs knowing it isn\u2019t true. My armpits are raw, but nothing Vaseline can\u2019t fix. Later in the day I check the official results. Official Time: 2:10:15, which is a PR for the past 5 years. Not too bad. I pull up my garmin summary and my average heart rate for the race was 190, with a max of 206! Holy Moly! It looks like every time I walked, my heart rate was over 200! Now I\u2019m very thankful that I finished and didn\u2019t have any major problems. I finished fourth in my age group, which is great! For dinner, I went to an all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant and stuffed my face. Sunday, I did what I call the \u201cexecutive workout\u201d, a couple minutes in the hot tub, a couple minutes in the cold plunge, and repeat. \n\nI will probably run this race again because it was local for me, and not super crowded. If you are looking into this race focus on hills, hills, and more hills. \n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http:\/\/sfdavis.com\/racereports\/) created by \/u\/herumph.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1677599781.0},{"title":"NYC Runs Central Park half vs Brooklyn half","author":"Automatic_Constant58","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11egrn2\/nyc_runs_central_park_half_vs_brooklyn_half\/","text":"Hello all,\n\nLooking for a bit of feedback.

During my marathon training in December, I had unintentionally set my half marathon PR of 2:09:19. This was over 10 minutes faster than any of my previous half marathon times. Until this year, I had plateaued around a 2:25 half.  I guess this new PR gave me a motivation boost, because I was ready to turn around and PR a half marathon again. I just felt like if I put in a little more speed and interval work, I could get faster. So, for the last month, I've been doing an interval day, a 5 mile day, a tempo day, and then one long run that is usually 1 hour 30 minutes to 2 hours long. I was also doing at least 2 days of cross-training on a spin bike. I tried to incorporate hill repeats, but I live in Florida. So, there's that.\n\nBecause I already live in Florida, I frequent the Disney races (not every one, but I do them often). So, since I was already signed up for the Princess Half Marathon, and since I'm used to the fanfare by now, I decided I would try to run the race for a PR. Lots of people say they don't recommend this, but when have I ever listened to what people tell me?\n\n### Pre-race\nFor those of you who don't know, races at Disney require a 2 to 3am wake up time. There are tens of thousands of people that run these races, and they start at 5am. They want you in there super early so they can get you out of their hair before parks open. The exhaustion of being up so early definitely adds to the difficulty of running a quality race. \n\nI was parked by 3:20am so I could make the long walk to the starting line, which is about a mile and a half long. I was feeling good despite 4 hours of sleep.\n\n### Race\nI started in the third corral, so I didn't have to wait very long to start. The nice thing about starting so early is that the temperature is going to go down a few degrees before it goes back up and I was going to run at least 80% of the race in the dark. I was at the front of the wave when we were released, so I found a wide open space right away. I'm not sure this was the best, however, because I went out way too fast. About a mile in, I noticed I was going 8:50 m\/m pace and I readjusted to a little over 9 m\/m. That was probably still too fast, but I was just going to give it a try.\n\nDisney races can be notorious for congestion and people pulling dangerous maneuvers. However, I didn't really have much of a problem. I spent the first 5 miles of the race passing people with almost no issue. After mile 5, I had only a handful of people around me. This was ideal because that is the time you hit Main Street USA, Magic Kingdom. It's very narrow through here. This is where the largest crowd of spectators is, and boy did they show out. It might have been the adrenaline, but I swear there were hundreds of people. Many more than I had seen last year. My main concern, at this point, was to avoid the parade tracks that are embedded in the street. A lot of people stopped for photos and to hug family members, so by the time I came around and through the back of Cinderella's Castle, I had wide open space. \n\nComing out of the back of Magic Kingdom, I realized I had waited too long to take my race fuel. I have asthma, so the minute I start to feel exhaustion my lungs want to contribute. I wasn't able to take a full breath, so I started to get a side cramp. I slowed down at the next water stop and did fuel, inhaler, and Powerade. It took me a bit to feel better, but I eventually got over it.\n\nAfter Magic Kingdom, it's all highway until the end, so I just settled in and tried to focus on relaxing and breathing. Most people that were doing my pace had dropped off somewhere in the park to take pictures (that's just the nature of the thing), so I had maybe 2 or 3 other people around me. The worst thing about these miles, for me, is actually how flat and straight the course is. It's just relentless. There's no way to switch up which muscle groups you're using, so it's just endless pounding. There's no downhill to take deep breaths on and get a second wind.\n\nMile 10, I was starting to feel the exhaustion from the early wakeup set in. The sun was starting to look like it wanted to come up, and I think my brain thought I had pulled an all-nighter. I was feeling sleepy.\n\nBy the time I got to Epcot (last mile and a half), I just wanted to finish. I was definitely getting grumpy and I kept telling myself after this race, I needed a break. I kept thinking about how much running I had been doing over the last few months, all the several-hour-long weekend runs, and I was talking myself into a nice long summer break. At mile 13, I rounded the corner with all the finisher spectators... and I just have to get this off my chest: The spectators at the finish line at Disney are the WORST. They are just sitting there silently, up in some bleachers, staring like they are at the opera. If it weren't for the announcers, you could hear a pin drop. I'm glad they're at the end. \n\nIn the end, I PR'd by 8 seconds. It wasn't as good as I set out to do, but a win is a win.\n\n### Post-race\nI plopped myself on a bench and had a beer at 7:30am. They hand out little snack boxes at the end of each race, but I can never bring myself to eat anything in it. I don't know why, but after a long run nothing is appetizing to me. \n\nSurprisingly, I'm a little sore today. I'm not sure if it was the relentlessly flat course or if it was because this race was a quick turnaround from my first marathon. Either way, I had a good time and I'll be running again next year with a POT and an earlier corral. So, that should be even better.","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1677529322.0},{"title":"Rock N Roll Vegas: Half marathon race report: Not enough training.","author":"k-to-the","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11dox80\/rock_n_roll_vegas_half_marathon_race_report_not\/","text":"### Race Information\n* **Name:** Rock N Roll Half Marathon\n* **Date:** Feb 26, 2023\n* **Distance:** 13.1\n* **Location:** Las Vegas\n* **Time:** 2:15\n\n### Goals\n| Goal | Description | Completed? |\n|------|-------------|------------|\n| A | Finish | *Yes* |\n| B | Sub 12 minute average  | *Yes* |\n| C | Sub 11 minute average | *Yes* |\n\n10:22 average \n\n### Training\nI'll keep it a bit more brief because I was a under trained. Big personal life changes meant that my run training started the final week of January(5 weeks), but in general I have done weights for a while so my fitness wasn't horrible before. My weekly mileage in training was 13-18 miles per week and top run was a 9 mile about 10 days before the race.\n\n### Pre-race\nI flew into Vegas on Thursday and spent the days exploring Vegas and the hikes nearby and the nights going out to casinos and partying a bit as the rest of my friend group showed up on the days leading up. Went out probably too much and was a pretty hungover on a few of the days leading up, but since it was an evening race I knew I had time to rehydrate. Day of we hit a big restaurant breakfast and geared up and hit the strip till it was time to head to the start village, between the flashing slots and first race jitters my heart rate was a pretty consistent 100 for the few hours leading up.\n\n### Race\nFirst 5k-34:18\nHit my comfort zone a little quicker than a normal run as there was probably close to a mile between the start area and start line to high knee and kick out. As we passed the finish line i let my friends go past me because I knew they were better trained or going the 10k instead of half. I ate one gel during the warmup pre start line.\n\n10k-1:05\nThe initial plan was to start with about 11 minute miles and positive split to ~12 minute by the end of the race but between nerves and dodging groups I found it impossible to keep any sort of speed consistency so I just started to ignore the mile pings from my watch saying I was going faster than I thought I could maintain.\n\n15k~1:40\nHere is where the race started to get tough as I left the bright lights and music if the strip to a slight lull between the strip and downtown, i considered the half way point effort wise to be at 15k because i was starting to chart new distances I'd never gone before. I ate my other gel around mile 8.5\n\nFinish-2:15\nIt was feeling kinda tough on my knee running on pavement vs. my training on dirt trails but i just held on as i was in the home stretch and on the way back into the strip. Grabbed a beer and cigarette from someone on the side of the road at about mile 10-11 and decided against them as I knew it would probably shred my stomach at this point so I dropped the cig in the pocket and held on to the beer for as a passed the finish line. Holding the beer kinda gave me a weird gait as i wasn't swinging that arm that was holding so i just kept switching the hand i was holding it. Cracked the beer and tried to light the cig as I crossed finish, but I couldn't and figured no one around me would appreciate it that much anyway.\n\n\n### Post Race\nPost race grabbed my gear, had all the free snacks and drinks they gave me and meet back up with my friends. Overall was pretty excited to run my first race and had a good time. In the future I'll put more effort in the training plan. Hope to run a full at some point but not before laying a much bigger base.\n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http:\/\/sfdavis.com\/racereports\/) created by \/u\/herumph.","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1677536928.0},{"title":"Race Report - Cowtown Marathon","author":"Dunster89","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11dn0av\/race_report_cowtown_marathon\/","text":"**Race** \\- Cowtown Marathon\n\n**Location** \\- Fort Worth, TX\n\n**Distance** \\- 26.2\n\n**Time** \\- 3:32\n\n**Pace** \\- 8:03\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Mile 1|7:48|\n|:-|:-|\n|Mile 2|7:40|\n|Mile 3|7:45|\n|Mile 4|7:42|\n|Mile 5|7:33|\n|Mile 6|7:46|\n|Mile 7|7:36|\n|Mile 8|7:46|\n|Mile 9|7:51|\n|Mile 10|7:54|\n|Mile 11|8:04|\n|Mile 12|8:07|\n|Mile 13|7:51|\n|Mile 14|8:05|\n|Mile 15|8:09|\n|Mile 16|8:08|\n|Mile 17|8:12|\n|Mile 18|8:11|\n|Mile 19|8:12|\n|Mile 20|8:02|\n|Mile 21|8:02|\n|Mile 22|8:12|\n|Mile 23|8:09|\n|Mile 24|8:17|\n|Mile 25|9:05|\n|Mile 26|8:50|\n|Finish|3:32:36.5|\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Background**\n\nI have been a runner since \\~2009.  I weighed 325 lbs my freshman\/sophomore years of college and decided to make a change after another friend lost weight.  Since my weight loss journey began I have continued running a minimum of 4-5 times a week, never really training for specific races, but doing random events here and there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've kept the weight off for the last decade+ but did gain \\~20 lbs over the COVID lockdown.  My wife having two kids and the associated shortcuts that come with some meals didn\u2019t help during that timeframe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast year I decided to train for the Boulderthon Half-Marathon and alright.  I finished and immediately began looking for a new challenge.  I wanted a Spring race in a warmer climate since we often run the risk of sub-zero temps here in Colorado in Feb\/March. The Cowtown was the perfect race!  I downloaded an 80\/20 program from Training Peaks and dedicated myself to finishing below an 8:30 min\/mile pace.  About halfway through training I realized that goal was very obtainable if nothing went wrong\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Night Before**\n\nMy wife and I arrived in Fort Worth late Friday evening and met by MIL\/FIL and BIL\/SIL and their baby at a rental house. My BIL would be running the race with me but we both had our own personal goals to finish. On Saturday evening we went out for a pre-race dinner with some friends and family.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the end of the night, after paying for the meal, my oldest son went into a seizure at the table and was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance.  My family and I were all obviously shaken. Luckily, my BIL is a paramedic and my FIL is a physician.  They immediately went into life support mode and handled the situation. My wife and I went with our boy to the hospital and stayed with him until \\~1:30 am. I had already made the decision not to run as being with my wife and kids is way more important to me than some silly race. As the tests came back and everything looked good we were discharged.  My wife told me to do everything I can to make that race. Maybe I wouldn\u2019t hit my goals bc of the exhaustion but I trained too hard not to race.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI reluctantly agreed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pre-Race**\n\nI woke up an hour later than I wanted to and barely had time to get dressed and out of the house.  My pre-race meal was a Little Debbie on the go. With 4 hours of sleep, bad thoughts racing through my mind, I made my way to corral 3 and started stretching.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Race**\n\nThe 1st 10 miles were a dream. The course was amazing, I somehow felt great and I was running at a good pace. I finished every mile before 10 well under 8:00\/mile.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust after mile 10 the course split off from the half-marathoners and I found myself catching up to the 3:35 pacers.  I knew that I had come out hot and that my current pace probably wasn\u2019t sustainable for the final 16.2 miles. So I decided to stick with this group for the remainder of the race.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere were times from here to the finish that I wanted to give up. This was definitely the hardest part, mentally, of the race. I had to keep reminding myself that if my little boy could get through his ordeal then I could get through mine. I stayed with this group until mile 25.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt mile 25 I came around a bend and saw my wife, my youngest, my friends and family, all cheering me on. Then, just behind my FIL I saw my oldest standing. He saw me and I broke off from the pack to give him the biggest hug. I stopped caring about the rest of my race.  My boy was doing better, laughing, running around, and having a normal day. I started crying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy family all told me to GO!  Finish the race. Well be here when you\u2019re done. So I started back on the course and finished the last 2 miles; not as strong or as fast as I could have though. The stop had reminded my legs how tired they really were. Those last 2 miles were closer to 9:00 pace but I didn\u2019t care. I finished my 1st marathon and I got to hold my boy who just went through something much harder than I. I was on top of the world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Post-Race**\n\nMy legs were destroyed. I could barely walk. I finished!  I watched my BIL finish about an hour later.

Began training about October \u201822. Started running doubles for the first time. \nDid about 85km at peak weeks. \n\nAverage was about 60-70km weeks. \n\nRan 5 times a week with 1 cross training day and some strength training sessions sprinkled after easy runs. \n\nHad some foot & ankle issues about 4 weeks from the race. I was able to take 5 days off and cross train and eventually things went back to normal. \n\n### Pre-race\nUsually travel with family but this time I went alone to worry about my own sleep and nutrition. Shoutout to wifey for being a trooper and holding down the fort with our 2 year old while she let me do this. \n\n**EDIT: (I live in Japan, so this was a 2hr trip) \n\nBreakfast was at 5am, Maurten solid + 4 small brown sugar rolls from 7\/11. I tried to stick to familiar foods since I couldn\u2019t find bananas at 5am. (Should have been prepared) + Maurten drink mix 320 CAF. &. 500ml of Nuun sports drink tablets \n\n### Race\n\nRace started at 9AM\nCold and rainy all morning until 11AM. Shoes were completely drenched during warmup time. I thought my goals were out the window. Snuck out to the toilet 4 mins before gun time. Was just extra nervous and didn\u2019t think it would turn out to be a good race. \n\nStarted out with the 6:00\/km crowd but tried to speed up and pass people through the edges of the street and settled into a few seconds slower than goal pace after 3km. \n\nGels at 6k\/12k\/18k\/24k\/&32k\n\nFirst 18ish km were up and down hills and eventually the elevation was pretty flat. Felt horrible stomach cramps at 30k at the verge of puking but held on and kept my pace. \nStuck around the 3:30 pace group which meant I was probably 2:28 ish in net time since my corral started 2 mins after gun time. \nWasn\u2019t too worried about the time since I knew if I didn\u2019t slow down any more I would still end up with a PR. \n\n### Post-race\n\n27min PR!!\nReflected on the race and went straight into recovery by eating and drinking all the good stuff that I could get my hands on. \nIt\u2019s been 3 days already and ate an enormous amount of wood oven pizza on Sunday afternoon. Did a mini shakeout run on Tuesday and no major pains or soreness, already feeling in the mood for a run, but going to take it easy this week. \n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http:\/\/sfdavis.com\/racereports\/) created by \/u\/herumph.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1677500471.0},{"title":"Rock n Roll Las Vegas and my first half marathon since 2007!","author":"fiskek2","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11dhsdm\/rock_n_roll_las_vegas_and_my_first_half_marathon\/","text":"### Race Information\n* **Name:** Rock n Rolle Las Vegas Half Marathon\n* **Date:** Feb 26, 2023\n* **Distance:** 13.1 miles\n* **Location:** Las Vegas NV\n* **Time:** 2:12:30\n\n### Goals\n| Goal | Description | Completed? |\n|------|-------------|------------|\n| A | Sub 2:15 | *Yes* |\n| B | No walking | *Yes* |\n\n### Splits\n| Mile | Time |\n|------|------|\n| 1 | 9:45\n| 2 | 10:01\n| 3 | 9:23\n| 4 | 9:25\n| 5 | 9:27\n| 6 | 9:37\n| 7 | 10:05\n| 8 | 10:05\n| 9 | 10:29\n| 10 | 10:39\n| 11 | 10:46\n| 12 | 10:39\n| 13 | 10:21\n| 14 | 9:25\n\n### Training\nLast year I saw a photo of some friends running the strip at night and it looked so fun! My husband had been asking me if I was interested in a destination race, so I decided this would be the one! I typically race 5ks, so this was a much different type of training for me, not to mention I haven\u2019t ran a half marathon since 2007! The runs were going well until about 3 weeks ago when my 85 lb golden retriever somehow managed to put her entire weight on my foot, and it started becoming painful to walk. I decided to stop running and focus on healing it, rather than try to keep training and potentially injure it further. Race week came and it finally started feeling good again! \n\n### Pre-race\nHaving a race that starts so late was definitely tricky for planning food. I'm used to a quick carb breakfast, so finding restaurants to eat breakfast and lunch at was tricky. When it came time for the start, the load area was king of a hot mess, with people jumping pace groups and a big chokepoint. I finally got through the load gate and was greeted with so many portapotties, which was nice to not stand in line for. The walk to the start was very long, and I was glad to have arm warmers, even though I shed them shortly after crossing the start line. \n\n### Race\nThe race was nice! Having all the crowds of Vegas made it exciting, even if most of them had no idea what was going on hah. There is the barest uphill at the start and finish, that isn't super noticeable until you head down it. That's where I found a great pace and felt great! Around mile 8 it started going back up and my pace suffered horribly. I was in a fair amount of pain at this point and decided to slow down rather than walk. At mile 11 there was a biofreeze station that if it had been at mile 9, I would have definitely used it, but I just wanted to finish. The downside of running the flat, straight strip is you can see the Mirage where the finish line is, and it looks so close, but so far away! I crossed the finish line right as the evening Volcano show started, which was a great ending for me! \n\n### Post-race\nIt is one heck of a walk from the finish line to the runner exit. I loved that they had official photographers to take a medal photo of you! There was also SO MUCH FOOD. My hands couldn't hold it all, so my running vest was stuffed full of bananas and fruit snacks. They had wine coolers for all and were very liberal with handing them out lol (I ended up with 3 somehow). The foil blankets could have been a bit larger as the wind picked up and it became pretty chilly with the sweat drying.  I ended up meeting me spouse at the fence and grabbing my coat.\n\nOverall a good race for me, especially with the circumstances. I beat my goal by 3 minutes and didn't walk (despite really wanting to at a few points). \n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http:\/\/sfdavis.com\/racereports\/) created by \/u\/herumph.","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1677519763.0},{"title":"Running while on tour","author":"bornedbackwards","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11df0of\/running_while_on_tour\/","text":"Hi, I'm looking for some advice or maybe just tips on incorporating running into a band tour.

I PRed in November 2014 with a 1:47:54 and kind of hovered in the 1:51-1:53 range until I got pregnant in 2016. I took a 3 year hiatus off of half marathons\/long distance running, and finally resumed racing in 2019, working my way back to the mid-1:50 range (though races were of course sparse during covid). I ended up getting pregnant again in February 2021, but I decided to keep up half marathon racing during my pregnancy. I ran a couple of (slow) races while pregnant, and then ultimately ran a long-deferred race in Kansas in April 2022, 6 months postpartum. Since then, I ran two more half marathons, each with a time of 1:51:19, which was my fastest time since before my first pregnancy. \n\nFor this race, I really wanted to beat that time. I trained for about 3 months, running 4-5 days a week for about 25 to a peak of 36 miles per week, and a longest run of 14 miles. For the first time ever, I incorporated tempo runs into my training and got serious about my speed work (while of course training a bulk at an easy effort). I also did megaformer (Lagree) classes 3 days a week for strength training, and I lost almost 10 pounds in January\/February. I felt like my training had gone really well, and so decided to try for ~1:50 in this race. \n\n### Pre-race\nThe one big challenge with this race is that it has a 4:30 PM start time, which definitely threw me for a loop. I decided to keep meals simple today\u2014I had a waffle with berries for breakfast at 8:45, and then had my typical pre-race banana, bagel, and peanut butter at 1:30 PM, along with some coffee. \n\nI ended up purchasing the VIP package, so got to the starting line village at around 3. The VIP area had tables with chairs, heat lamps, ample port a potties, and a huge spread of fruit, pastries, beverages, and even a bar, but I just opted for water. \n\nThe temperature at the start was around 54 degrees, and sunny, but the start village was mostly shaded, and there was a decent amount of wind. I opted for a t shirt and shorts, which was comfortable during the race, but I was freezing during the pre-race time, even with a jacket. \n\nUnfortunately, because it is a huge RnR event, they load the starting line well in advance of the start time. My group loaded around 3:55, which meant 40 minutes between gear checking my jacket and starting. I snagged some hot hands from the vip area, but I was still freezing. I wish I had brought a throwaway top layer. \n\nYou end up walking quite a distance to the start line near planet Hollywood\u2014probably close to a mile. The start line was fun though with fireworks and entertainment. They got us started pretty promptly, and we were off!\n\n### Race\nAs is the case with pretty much every big race, there was a ton of darting and weaving for the first several miles. You start out going south on the strip towards the welcome to Vegas sign. I wondered why I was struggling to hit my target pace right away, until I realized that we were actually running on a subtle uphill. Once we made the turn just past two miles to run north on the strip, the next 6.5 miles were slightly downhill and felt great. It was really cool running along the strip, and the crowds were fun! It got a bit more sparse approaching downtown, but you\u2019re rewarded with a peekaboo view of Fremont street, which was cool. \n\nAid stations were great\u2014approximately every two miles with Gatorade available at every other stop. The volunteers were great and plentiful, so the handoff was smooth. \n\nWhen we turned back to go south again, things got real. We got hit with a headwind that, combined with the subtle uphill, made for a bit of a grind. I tried to pick things up again when I had under a mile left, and was so happy to see that I was on track to meet my goal!\n\n### Post-race\n\nI ended up with a time of 1:48:31 which is my second fastest time EVER! I honestly thought that my fastest times were well behind me since having kids, so the fact that a PR could maybe still be in my future makes me want to cry happy tears. Motherhood has taken such a toll on my time, energy, and body, so it feels amazing to reclaim this part of me.\n\nMuch like the start, the finish line was long and COLD. They handed out foil blankets, but I was still shaking because I was so cold. The vip gear check was blessedly quick, and the hosted buffet and bar at the Bellagio were nice. I definitely recommend the vip package if you want a quick place to get warm and refuel\/recharge, especially given how chaotic getting around the strip is with the road closures. \n\nOverall, I\u2019m really happy with the outcome and encouraged that having kids maybe doesn\u2019t have to mean the end of achieving new personal bests :)\n\n\n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http:\/\/sfdavis.com\/racereports\/) created by \/u\/herumph.","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1677478585.0},{"title":"Garmin \"Barometric Altimeter\" elevation vs \"corrected\" elevation in calculating ascent.","author":"JordanRunsForFun","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11di1qs\/garmin_barometric_altimeter_elevation_vs\/","text":"Hello Runners!\n\nA year or so ago I upgraded to a Garmin Fenix 6S Plus. Great piece of gear in general, and one of the features on the long list of sensors is the barometric altimeter, which is able to use pressure to detect elevation changes and, according to Garmin, makes it easier to track things like flights of stairs climbed and also provides its own altitude reading. \n\nHowever, I just noticed recently that when reviewing your runs in Connect on the web, there is an option to switch on Elevation Corrections. An info pane next to the options states: \"elevation corrections are calculated with data from professional service instead of the data from your device. If your device has a barometric altimeter elevation corrections are disabled by default.\"\n\nSo, I have said feature and they are disabled by default as stated. But here's where it gets confusing. I switched from disabled to enabled and the estimate of my total ascent was basically cut in half. On a 25 km run it dropped from 231 m to 128 m.\n\nI would've expected that to mean that the barometric altimeter was wrong. After all it's a sensor trying to do the best I can with pressure data whereas the elevation corrections should be based on precise mapping. I was initially very disappointed as I've been using this metric and I've been training specifically for a long race with a giant hill at the end so I sent has been an important stat for me and learning that I only did half of what I thought I did was troubling. \n\nThey really confusing part is that it seems as though the barometric altimeter might actually be more accurate. There is at least one fairly substantial hill that was completely flattened in the \"corrected\" version. I live just north of Toronto so not in some poorly mapped distant location. \n\nI'm just wondering if anyone else has had any experience with this. I'm not sure what to trust right now. I mean I know I'm running up lots of hills so in the end it doesn't matter I should be ready for my race, but I love statistics And I'm in a bad place about this right now! \n\nThanks!","upvote_ratio":0.82,"created_utc":1677520421.0},{"title":"Miscellaneous Monday Chit Chat","author":"fire_foot","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11db7mc\/miscellaneous_monday_chit_chat\/","text":"TGI\u2026M! \n\nHappy Monday all, gather round for all the chatting, running related or not!","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1677502577.0},{"title":"Central Park Half Marathon Race Report","author":"Asuran423","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11ctbka\/central_park_half_marathon_race_report\/","text":"### Race Information\n* **Name:** Central Park Half Marathon\n* **Date:** February 26, 2023\n* **Distance:** 13.1 Miles\n* **Location:** New York, NY\n* **Time:** 1:47:12\n\n### Goals\n| Goal | Description | Completed? |\n|------|-------------|------------|\n| A | Sub 2 | *Yes* |\n| B | Sub 1:50 | *Yes* |\n\n#Stats\n26\/M\n195 Pounds\n5'11\nMiles Per Week Pre Taper: 50\n\n### Splits\n| Mile | Time |\n|------|------|\n| 1 | 8:08\n| 2 | 8:09\n| 3 | 7:49\n| 4 | 7:40\n| 5 | 8:02\n| 6 | 7:51\n| 7 | 8:17\n| 8 | 7:51\n| 9 | 8:00\n| 10 | 8:26\n| 11 | 8:05\n| 12 | 8:34\n| 13 | 8:17\n\n### Training\nMy journey to this race was a long one, but I'll try to give a short version. I was a Cross-Country Runner in High School. I also did Long-Distance Track. I loved it. I also struggled with drug addiction, eating disorders and alcoholism. By 17, I had already literally run myself into the ground. I injured my hip. Physically I probably recovered pretty quickly. But mentally my confidence was shattered. My last and only Half Marathon before this was in 2012 about a year before I got sober. I was so unhealthy and dehydrated that I nearly passed out in the middle of the race and finished in the 2:15s. That was my first big run for over a decade. I would eventually get sober at 17, but by that point I was smoking cigarettes and generally still not hopeful I could ever get into running shape. Fast forward over 8 years later to the 2020 Covid-19 Pandemic. I'm 250 pounds, absolutely miserable and also fed up with myself. So in 2020, I started walking every god damn day. I also quit smoking and stayed quit. I did this for a year, slowly losing weight here and there. By the summer of 2021, I was down to 230. I started walking more, trying very small intervals of running here and there with no structure. I ran my first mile in October of 2022. Then I ran another. Then I ran outside. My goal was simple: Get to a 30 minute continuous run until I could make that the default and then build up from there. Within two weeks, I was running a 5k Distance at around 30 minutes. By the end of October, I ran my first long run in 10 years and did a ten mile run at a 10:30 pace. By the end of November, I was up to 25-30 miles a week and was down to 215 pounds. My long runs were getting longer. By December, I had run my first half marathon distance in training and was up to 30-35 miles week. By the end of 2022, I had successfully ran 15 miles without stopping. By the end of January, I was down to 190-195 pounds in a slower but consistent slim down while being careful to cut back on running if I felt I wasn't eating enough to meet my physical needs with the extra mileage. In short, I never used a training plan, but I took a little bit out of every single training plan and life experience I had and made my own plan. By February, I had successfully done a 18 mile long run and knew that my original goal of sub 2 hours could be more lofty, as I had done 1:51 in training. During this time, I also got off of my stimulant medication I was on for ADHD(safely)and quite literally ran through the withdrawals until I could get a new baseline. I signed up for the Central Park Half Marathon on impulse because I felt I was ready to have a new, sober experience for a race that I never thought I would run again not too long ago. I did a 20-25 percent taper in the last week and a half, going down to 44 and 39 respectively from a 50 miles per week average.\n### Pre-Race\nI increased my carb-intake in the last few days leading up to the race and had my last pre-race run on Friday of this week, ending a 11 day streak. This week I focused in shorter, faster runs while maintaining the frequency, as my body was used to the 6 day a week schedule at that point.\n\n### Race\nMy goal for this race was to not start out too fast and focus on long-term survivability, not record mile times in the first 5k of the race and a massive crash later. For the most part, I achieved this. I did start out a bit fast, but I kept my slower miles at or below 8:30, even though the hill sections were super tough and made me nearly quit a couple times. Thankfully, I didn't and kept pushing through. My goal was to run fast enough to go 1:50 while also leaving some fuel in the tank to reduce the possibility of a burnout late in the race. Overall, I could have gone faster, but I broke 1:50 and I am happy with that.\n### Post-race\nI ate the free bagels, take a selfie because of course and took a glorious one hour nap before I went back to my neuroscience homework. It took nearly a decade of sobriety, every obstacle possible, but I am a runner again and I am so grateful I was angry that one night in October and went to the gym to blow off some steam. My next target: A Full Marathon.

Leading up this race I ran two 12 mile long runs, and I had no taper - the day before the half I ran my normal 7 mile base run. I could definitely tell that I was not fresh during the half but it didn\u2019t seem to impact me too negatively. More than anything this was a good test of my pre-race plan and my nutrition (which I put no thought into whatsoever, see below). \n\n### Pre-race\nI arrived in Atlanta on Friday and had a friend staying in the area who graciously let me crash in his hotel the first night to save some money. It was down near the airport so I also booked a closer hotel much closer to the race. The free hotel was a pull-out couch, and said friend had work commitments that brought him back to the room around 1 am Saturday morning. No fault of his, it was a free room and I knew the terms! That meant slightly less than ideal sleep Friday night. Saturday I ran my 7 mile base run but tried to keep it slow. That failed, I felt really good and ran about 30 seconds per mile faster than I was supposed to. \n\nThe rest of the day on Saturday I spent seeing some of my old neighborhood favorites in Atlanta since I lived here until a couple years ago. I had a huge brunch of a potato\/veggie dish and banana pancakes at one of my favorite restaurants in the city (best pancakes on the planet!) and a couple slices of pizza for dinner around 5 pm. I tried to hydrate but kept forgetting so didn\u2019t really do the best job there. Got to bed around 9:30 pm and actually slept well enough, my watch says I got just over 6 hours in total. \n\nSince this was my first big race I left *lots* of time Sunday morning to prep. My alarm went off at 4:15 am to finish the last few bites of my potatoes from Saturday brunch, and I proceeded to blow the circuit breaker in my hotel room making coffee with the provided coffee maker. The hotel reset the breaker and then\u2026 it blew again. Luckily I had lots of time and waited on the lobby coffee to be ready. \n\nI mixed up a 16 oz bottle with some Tailwind and drank it fairly slowly, including on my way to the start line. I initially left the hotel around 6:15 am and it was only about a 5 minute walk to the park. \n\nStanding around, I wanted to wait to use the porta potties until the latest I felt comfortable. I walked over at about 6:45 and the line was at least 40 people deep for each one. Did some quick thinking and decided to walk back to my hotel as there would be no line in my room. \n\nGot back to the park at 7:00 and lined up. Almost immediately had to pee again (really, bladder?) but it was too late. I decided to wait until it was really a problem. \n\n### Race\nI was in wave D so we slowly shuffled to the line as each line ahead of us went. I crossed the start line at 7:28 am. My plan was to keep the 2:15 pacer in sight at minimum, even if I dropped behind them. Well, I ended up in front of them and tried to run my first mile slow enough to let them pass. I went out a *little* too fast, but definitely recoverable. \n\nI had made a Garmin PacePro plan to take the hills into consideration and I\u2019m extremely glad I did. At the first mile I was a decent chunk of time ahead of the plan but right as I passed mile 1 the 2:15 pacers soared past me. I kept checking my watch to make sure I wasn\u2019t crazy, nope, right on plan. That\u2019s alright, pace plans can be very personal so I\u2019ll put stock in the Garmin and try to keep an eye on the pacers. \n\nThe first 4 miles were a breeze. The road was extremely crowded, seriously, I had no idea how many people there would be. I was never more than about 4 feet from another runner, usually multiple, all the way to the finish line. Even still, I could tell I started around the right group as I wasn\u2019t having to weave to pass or get passed\u2026 *yet*. \n\nBy mile 4 my bladder was telling me it wasn\u2019t going to make it the whole race. Right around that time I passed the first aid station, and it\u2019s 20 runner deep like for the porta potty. No problem, it\u2019s not that bad yet. The crowds were incredible and I just kept trying to slow myself down to my plan. \n\nBy mile 6 I was focusing more on my bladder than anything else so I decided it was time. I passed the 10k split and shortly after was another aid station. This one had a considerably shorter line, so I stopped. My Garmin said I was about 2:00 ahead of goal, which was perfect. I lost about 2:30 waiting, but that\u2019s better than becoming the new Reddit meme. \n\nWhen I left the porta potty I checked my watch and I was just over 0:20 behind my goal. Very manageable as long as I don\u2019t try to make it all up at once. *You hear that, legs? Not all at once.*\n\nThey didn\u2019t hear it. Right after the aid station was one of the longer hills and I zoomed up it. Right out of the gate I was having to pass just about everyone I came across. I later realized that after the porta potty I don\u2019t remember being passed except for by one person. Instead I spent the entire run zig zagging all over the road trying to leave people enough space but run my own pace. \n\nI continued running way faster than I knew I could sustain but it just felt *good*. By mile 9 I was back to my original crowd that I started with and showing substantially ahead of goal again. \n\nRight around mile 11, when we hit the 10th Street hill, I started to feel it. I started telling myself that I only had 2 more miles, I could push through sore legs that long. Just maintain pace, no need for anything else. \n\nAaaaand then I ran three of my fastest miles of the race. I felt like I was dragging my legs through mud and every clock I passed I did the mental math of what pace I needed to finish just in case. \n\nFinally the start area came into sight and I was pretty confident I had it in the bag. We rounded the corner to the finish line and the last 100 meters or so were PACKED. Seriously, I could barely move. I wanted to keep my own pace but that made me inadvertently cross over to the marathon side of the cones for a bit until I realized what they were. Luckily we were slightly ahead of the top marathon finishers so I didn\u2019t feel like a total idiot. Crossed the line at a 2:13:45. \n\n### Post-race\nThe park area was extremely well setup to keep everyone moving through the medals\/jackets\/water\/chocolate milk\/free food area. There wasn\u2019t anywhere to stop before then so I followed the crowd. I apologize to the medal volunteer who heard me try to thank you through sobs, hopefully something grateful came through. \n\nI got to a grassy area and stretched out some (read: laid down and starfished) and downed the chocolate milk. I can\u2019t remember the last time I had any but man that tasted good. I texted all my family and gave myself a pat on the back. \n\nBack to the hotel, shower, and straight to some favorite BBQ and ice cream spots in the city before jumping on a flight back home. \n\nI learned a lot from this race, and I\u2019m so grateful that Atlanta was my first. This is the third half I\u2019ve attempted and the first I\u2019ve even started due to injuries. This one was pain free and a blast! Now one whole day off (thanks Hal) and right back into training for the full. \n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http:\/\/sfdavis.com\/racereports\/) created by \/u\/herumph.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1677451483.0},{"title":"Official Q&A for Monday, February 27, 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11d39t9\/official_qa_for_monday_february_27_2023\/","text":"With over 2,350,000 subscribers, there are a lot of posts that come in everyday that are often repeats of questions previously asked or covered in the FAQ.\n\nWith that in mind, this post can be a place for any questions (especially those that may not deserve their own thread).

I originally trained for a Half Marathon back in November and decided that if that went well, I\u2019d train for a full. I\u2019ve wanted to do a full since I was a kid, but last time I tried to do it, I had to get my appendix taken out. \n\nMy weeks consisted mostly of light weight lifting on Mondays and Wednesdays, and running on Tuesdays and Thursdays, with rest days on Fridays, long runs on Saturdays, and usually another rest on Sundays. \n\nI typically only ran 3x a week. I got up to a 20 mile run about a month before the race. \n\n### Pre-race\nThe night before, my coach (Mother in Law) walked me through her expectations and my race plan. She suggested I hang back from the 4:00 pace group and just keep them in my sights, trying to hit 9:09 each split then evaluate my feeling at mile 10. She also warned me that I\u2019d get little niggles and rough patches throughout the race, and that I just needed to run through them, but to listen to my body. She also said something that really stuck with me \u201cseconds in the beginning save you minutes in the end.\u201d \n\nI slept horribly the night before, only getting about 3 hours, but I slept great the rest of the week, so I wasn\u2019t concerned. The weather was a little cold and rainy. I ate a bagel with peanut butter and a banana and drank a Gatorade. I hid in the bathroom for 15 minutes at the race because of the rain. \n\n### Race\nI executed the plan pretty well. I stayed with my pace group until about mile 8 or so. This race runs from the beach, to downtown, which is a cool concept, but also means you\u2019re running on the highway for like 9 miles with cars passing you at 65 mph. I held back for the first half, and after the race split, I felt good with some open air to breathe. I started passing people pretty consistently until about mile 21 then just tried to hold on to my pace from there. I wasn\u2019t racing against other people, but passing them is a good feeling haha. \n\nMy wife and her family kept meeting me on the course to give me encouragement. I was carrying an Apple air tag so they could track me. It was awesome. \n\nThe rain was off and on, but the temperature and wind was perfect. My hip flexors were nagging at me a bit, but I just pushed through and focused on my form. \n\nOverall everything went as well as I could\u2019ve hoped and I hit my goals!\n\n### Post-race\nI had a shot of Buffalo Trace Bourbon my Mother In Law got me and a Gatorade. We went to eat and then I drank more beer. Then I laid around the rest of the day. \n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http:\/\/sfdavis.com\/racereports\/) created by \/u\/herumph.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1677413435.0},{"title":"Breaking the Nine-Second Barrier: Will a Human Ever Run 100m in Under Nine Seconds?","author":"Federal_Penalty5832","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11c9e2q\/breaking_the_ninesecond_barrier_will_a_human_ever\/","text":"It's no easy feat to run 100m in less than ten seconds. However, with the [world record standing at 9.58 seconds](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3nbjhpcZ9_g), attention has turned to [whether a human will be able to run 100m in under nine seconds one day](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=SdMo9hbt2nI).\n\nBased on 20 years of investigating the biomechanics of sprinting, the answer is, \"of course they can\". There's no limit to human sprinting in sight yet. Humans have only been running competitively (with time records available) for about 100 years. In the context of human evolution, this is far too short a period to analyze to make long-term predictions for the future. Records are still being broken, and training and technology (for example, track surfaces and running spikes) are continuously being developed further.\n\n[From Jim Hines beating the ten-second barrier for the first time in 1968](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8HgYxUDk1SU) to [Maurice Greene in 1999](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=sOMb6h-0JGs), the world record improved by 0.16 seconds in 31 years, but since then, the record has been improved by 0.21 seconds in only 24 years. This doesn't necessarily imply that the development of the record is speeding up, just that we can't consider human limits in a short-term perspective.\n\nThere have always been and there will always be humans who make new leaps in these kinds of records. To develop the argument against a set limit in human performance further, why wouldn't Usain Bolt have a son who is just a bit taller, stronger, and faster than Usain himself, and so on?\n\nThe issue of improving performance is also down to better training and improving running technique. [In a recent scientific paper, the importance of powerful gluteus (buttock) muscles for the start performance in sprinting was highlighted](https:\/\/www.lboro.ac.uk\/news-events\/news\/2020\/october\/large-gluteus-maximus-key-for-sprint-speed-study\/). Athletes and coaches can then train and strengthen these key muscle groups to get out of the starting blocks better.\n\nOverall, the sprinting velocity is a product of stride length and step frequency. For a human to run 100m in under nine seconds, this would require maximum velocity to reach about 13.2m\/s, which would require, for example, stride length to be 2.85m and step frequency 4.63 Hz - just \"modest\" increases from Usain Bolt's values ([when Bolt set the world record in the 100 m sprint, his mean stride length and step frequency were 2.44 m and 4.27 Hz, respectively](https:\/\/core.ac.uk\/download\/pdf\/187761925.pdf)). But, when athletes start to increase stride length in the maximum velocity phase, it has a negative effect on step frequency, and vice versa. Thus, it will likely take time before we see that kind of performance. The main issue is how much power (large forces in the shortest possible time) humans can produce and what the requirements are to achieve this.\n\nTo produce long strides at a high frequency, an athlete has to produce a huge amount of force (approximately 4.5 times body weight) in a very short period of time (around 0.1s). [Recent research has shown that it is this difference in the forces generated in the early part of the stance phase (just after foot contact) that distinguishes very fast sprinters from the less fast ones](https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s40279-019-01138-1).\n\nTherefore, to reach the point at which enough force can be generated quickly enough to produce the stride lengths and frequencies suggested above, a combination of genetics and training would need to produce bum, thigh, and calf muscles that are a little bit stronger and faster than the current best sprinters.\n\nThe record will start to plateau at some point, and it will get harder and harder to outrun the previous record holder. But, it's safe to say that someone will break the nine-second barrier - not necessarily in our lifetime, but it will happen one day. To understand how fast a human can ultimately run, we need to go beyond the record books and understand the underlying factors that contribute to human performance, such as genetics, biomechanics, nutrition, training methods, and technology.\n\n[Scientists and sports researchers continue to study these factors in order to gain insights into how we can optimize human performance and push the limits of what is possible](https:\/\/www.scientificamerican.com\/article\/the-secret-to-human-speed\/). As we learn more about these factors and continue to innovate, it's possible that we may see even faster times than we ever thought possible.\n\nSo while it's difficult to predict exactly when a human will run the 100m in under nine seconds, there is no doubt that the potential is there. With advancements in training, technology, and a better understanding of the biomechanics of sprinting, it's entirely possible that we will see a new world record set in the near future.\n\nBut breaking this barrier won't be easy, and it will require athletes to continue to push the limits of what is possible. As the record improves, the gains will become smaller and harder to achieve, but as long as there are people willing to dedicate themselves to the sport, we will continue to see new records set.\n\nSo, will we ever see a human run the 100m in under nine seconds? The answer is a resounding \"yes.\" While it may take some time, the potential is there, and there is no doubt that athletes will continue to push themselves to achieve this incredible feat. It's just a matter of when.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1677400919.0},{"title":"Li'l Race Report Thread","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11d39ss\/lil_race_report_thread\/","text":"\nThe Li\u2019l Race Report Thread is for writing a short report on a recent race or a run in a new place.

In 2021 I had taken the steps necessary to shed weight in a major way, and to keep it off, on December 15, 2020, I weighed in at 256 lbs, by July 4, 2021, I had gotten down to 180 lbs, I have remained between 180-186 lbs since then, 6\u2019 2\u201d 37 years old as of this post, heaviest weight of my life so far was 272 lbs in 2012, I\u2019ve been a big dude just about my whole life. I was a mountain biker prior to this period and took cycling to a much more serious level, then added running and became hooked. As most cyclists do, I ended up injured over and over for just about my whole first year of running, I even took the entire summer of 2022 completely off of running and focused back on cycling, didn\u2019t pick running back up until mid September 2022.\n\nAs for training, I have been using MyProCoach for cycling and running, started with them in spring 2021 when I started taking things seriously, so I started their advanced marathon plan around November 2022, I dialed back cycling a bit and followed the plan as closely as I could with a very slow and careful ramp up to avoid the mistakes I had done in 2021, ending up with a consistent \\~40 MPW through Jan and Feb leading up to this race. Speed work, strength, etc on the weekdays, long runs on the weekend, my longest run prior to the marathon itself was a 20 mile run in early February.\n\n\\### Pre-race\n\nI live in Maryland with my wife and son, so for this race, which I signed up for completely on a whim about a year ago after my first half marathon, so we got an AirBNB a couple blocks from the finish line. We arrived the Friday afternoon before the race to pick up the packet and explore the town, which we\u2019d never been to. One thing I know from bike races and from reading everything I could about marathons is that you don\u2019t explore the local food until AFTER the race, so we brought my normal day before food and morning of breakfast, I think this aided in not having any nutrition issues during the race. I got an \u201cok\u201d night sleep, I\u2019m a horrible sleeper, even with ambien, especially in a strange bed, the night before a race.\n\n\\### Race\n\nMy goal time was 3:15, which I knew would be a bit lofty, as my running buddies agreed, but I was going to go for it. This race is a point to point, so you either shuttle to the start, or you drive to the start and shuttle back to your car. I wanted consistency in the morning, so I drove myself to the start line, the parking lot was 1 mile from the start line, so that gave me some time to make sure my shoes and everything were right. It was a consistent 55 degrees from start to finish, drizzling off and on for its entirety, winds were there, but not enough to really worry about, or to aid you. The course was interesting\u2026.as much prep as I put into this, I didn\u2019t actually look at the course even on a map until the night before the race\u2026.the first 11 miles were actually on a 4 lane divided highway, with one lane closed for our use, this boggled my mind the night before, but during the race, it was completely fine.\n\nAs for my race, I latched onto the 3:15 pacer and settled into the zone, and felt fantastic, I found the pace to be fine, my HR was where I expected\u2026.where I might have hurt myself, for the first of my 2 pee breaks during mile 10, I burned a match to try to catch back up to the 3:15 pace group, clicking in a 6:59 mile that I wasn\u2019t worried about, because I regularly hit those paces when wanted to for short stuff, but my splits started raising from that mile on. The two pee stops I did very efficiently, in aid station johns, 20 seconds combined for both stops\u2026.I didn\u2019t need to bust my tail to catch back up after the first one, I should have done that more gradually, I likely would have gotten a better overall result if I didn\u2019t turn it up so much after the first break.\n\nThe rest of the race, WOW, all I read about the mile 18 wall was completely verified, mile 18-22 was just brutal, \u201cwhy am I doing this?\u201d \u201cLook, that guy is walking, he looks so comfortable, I should walk a little\u201d \u201cNo! Keep going!\u201d Then at mile 22 it starts to set in\u2026.just over 4 miles left, you get sad when a run is that short, just GO, you\u2019re almost done! And that\u2019s what I did, I remained mindful of my gait and just got through it, I had a strong finish, I was able to hold off a few behind me that tried for a final push. My fueling strategy worked, the aid stations were water, gatorade, and GU Gels, I use GU anyways, and I fall back on gatorade frequently when I\u2019m feeling poor anyways, so I just tossed some emergency gels and salt tablets in my half tights pockets and nutrition was perfect, no feelings of bonking, my \u201cmotor\u201d was good for the whole race, it was just my legs that were like nah\u2026.this is all I\u2019m giving you, on the later parts of the race.\n\nOh, and if anyone is interested, I wore Adidas Adios Pro 3s, Nike Dri-Fit Trail half tights, and an Asics singlet I got on clearance, had no chafing issues or anything anywhere.\n\n\\### Post-race\n\nI didn\u2019t collapse across the line, which I guess is a good thing, until the end of this thing I didn\u2019t really understand the whole space blanket thing, they basically forced one on me at the end \u201cfine, go ahead, I don\u2019t know why I need it though\u201d then about 10 minutes after the race, it came off my shoulder a bit and I instantly started to shiver\u2026..ohhh, it\u2019s so I come back down to temp gradually, ok I am keeping it on\u2026.I was lucky enough to be given a second medal when I asked for one for my 4.5 year old son whom was in attendance and always wants a medal, he and my wife scrambled around to hold up signs for me at different locations and I was so glad they were there, and I was very happy to put a medal around his neck, as was he.\n\nIt\u2019s a day after right now, and I am still limping around and having trouble going up and down the stairs, I now fully understand why people talk about how hard these events are on you no matter how prepared you are\u2026..everyone was still limping around town this morning when we ventured out for coffee before the drive home\u2026.hopefully I will want to run again in a couple days, because right now, I want to do a bonfire for all my running shoes when we get home.\n\nMade with a new \\[race report generator\\]([http:\/\/sfdavis.com\/racereports\/](http:\/\/sfdavis.com\/racereports\/)) created by \/u\/herumph.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1677430664.0},{"title":"Favorite half marathons in the NE in June\/July\/August?","author":"blueviolet33","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11cgczb\/favorite_half_marathons_in_the_ne_in\/","text":"Hi guys!

However, I got the bug immediately and went to get my first real pair of running shoes the next day with the goal to complete a full marathon sometime within the next year.  As I consistently went out on runs I noticed that once I was able to get my legs under me my cardio was definitely above that of a total beginner due to my years of consistently surfing and eating a healthy diet, so I at least like to think that I progressed quickly.  My training was moving fast and as I hit mid January I completed my first 10 mile run after which I thought, it\u2019s only 3 more miles how bad can it be, so I signed up for this half marathon.  For my training I did 2-3 runs of 4-5 miles a week and one long run.  I did one more 10 mile, a 13 mile and then a 10 mile the week before to taper off.  Boy was I wrong about those extra 3 miles.  Nonetheless, I am very happy I did get a 13 mile run under my belt because I knew mentally going into the race that my legs were able to withstand that distance.  \n\n### Pre-race\nDrove to Savannah the Friday Afternoon before, had a wonderful dinner and stayed at an Airbnb with a shared guest.  When we got back from dinner we saw 4-5 cars and a bunch of 18-20 year old kids inside partying.  We walked in and the kid who made the reservation had no idea it was shared, seemed annoyed that we were there to ruin his party, and said they\u2019d keep it down but it seemed obvious they weren\u2019t gonna try too hard.  I just thought, \u201coh shit you gotta be kidding me, of course the other guests are a bunch of kids and I\u2019m gonna have to deal with them partying all night.\u201d  We couldn\u2019t hear too much from our room as it was in a totally different area of the house and I decided to give it till 10pm before I went down to tell them they gotta be quiet for the first time.  To my suprise at around 930 they got totally quiet and all their cars left.  Turns out the neighbor called the homeowner and told them what was happening as this was a strict no partying Airbnb.  The homeowner came, kicked them out, apologized to us and we slept fine.  Sorry if this was totally pointless, but I just found it really funny how they didn\u2019t read the description and thought about how just a couple years ago I would have probably been those kids getting kicked out and felt proud of how far I\u2019ve come.  \n\nAnyway, race started at 7am and after a great night's sleep I beat my alarm and woke up at 445am.  I then proceeded to take a liquid IV at 5am, pace around, then a spoonful of peanut butter, honey, a banana, and coffee around 530-6.  We then drove over to race, stretched, waited around and at 645 I ate a gel before we got started.  I tried to limit water past the IV as I hydrated plenty the day before and didn\u2019t wanna have to pee.\n\n\n### Race\nRace began at 7am sharp.  My main goal for the entire past month was to complete this race in under 2 hours.  I thought I was gonna be fighting tooth and nail to reach that goal so for the first mile I stayed right with the 2 hour pacers.  After that I was feeling good so I thought \u201cI\u2019m gonna pick it up a little bit and run a couple miles at 8:30-8:45 to create some distance between me and the pacers for later in the race when I inevitably slow down or have to take a break.\u201d  Only thing is as I kept going, I didn\u2019t slow down, I sped up and still felt fine.  I enjoyed the beautiful landscape and was feeling really good, tired but much better than I thought.  At mile 10 a cheering crowd got me pumped up and then at mile 11 I finally started hurting.  Every step I could feel my feet blister but I just told myself \u201conly two more miles, leave nothing in the tank.\u201d  At this point I knew I was gonna get my goal and thought my new goal is to run my last mile in under 8 minutes.  So once I hit mile 12 I put on the jets and dipped deep into mental reserves.  When I turned the final corner for the last push I saw the clock read 1:49 and counting.  I thought, \u201cI gotta get under 1:50\u201d so I used everything I had left and crossed the line at 1:49:31, beating my original goal by over 10 minutes.  Couldn\u2019t believe it.  \n\n### Post-race\nImmediately stopped, chugged a gatorade and walked over to porta potty to relieve myself.  After, I realized what I had just done and it truly was one of the better moments of my life.  I felt so accomplished and proud of the work I\u2019d put in to achieve this goal.  Just an absolutely amazing feeling.  I called a couple friends and my parents after to tell them about what I\u2019d just done and rode that high for the next couple hours sharing my joy with the people who\u2019ve inspired me, pushed me, and whom I care about most.  It was what felt like the first time in my life where I was the one receiving the congratulations not saying it.  Even only a year ago if you would have told me that I would be running 13 miles I would have thought that you were crazy.  Feels really good to see how much I\u2019ve grown the past couple months not only physically but as a whole person.  I still have work to do but this morning was a huge milestone. \n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http:\/\/sfdavis.com\/racereports\/) created by \/u\/herumph.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1677382455.0},{"title":"Achievements for Sunday, February 26, 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11c5v8l\/achievements_for_sunday_february_26_2023\/","text":"Hey runners, it's another day and it is time to post your accomplishments you'd like to share - big or small.\n\nNote: No need to preface YOUR accomplishments with something like, \"this may not be an accomplishment to most of you...\".

I tapered a little this week to be fit for the race. I had run a 47:07 10km a couple of weeks ago . Longest run so far was 18 miles last weekend. Fastest half marathon time was around 1:57 going easy\/moderate.\n\n### Pre-race\nI had a stressful and tiring week and slept poorly the night before. I had been quite scared most of the week of the tough sub 1:45 target I had set myself (8 min miles for nearly 2 hours sounds so tough!). I took my first gel about 30 mins before the race. It was very cold and windy, around 7 degrees Celsius. I was struggling to keep warm. Putting on my race number with safety pins was also annoyingly fiddly with cold hands. I had gone to the toilet about 40 mins before the race but started feeling the unwelcome urge during warm up...\n\n### Race\nThe course is 13 miles of a 1 mile circuit which I think was used for BMX in the 2012 Olympics. Sharp hills and turns which I would start to hate.\n\nWe started with the first 0.1 miles going downhill before the 13 laps. I checked my pace and thought \"wow I'm going so fast so easily!\" I spent the first few miles soaking in the event and weaving around and overtaking to get good racing line.\n\nOne lady I overtook sped up with me, let's call her Sunglasses. She stuck very close to me for most of the race, catching up (I could hear her ominous cadence) on the flats but I usually managed to pull away on the downhills. It was quite a yo-yo effect.\n\nNext few miles were uneventful other than pouring water down my nose and spilling some gel on my race number. The water stations were just before a downhill so I really struggled with that. I also didn't want to increase the urge for nature's call so didn't take too much. Anyway it was hard just getting enough in my mouth then swallowing without choking as I prefer sports caps and the hills didn't help. I briefly wondered if I would pay the price for my fast pace but present me felt great and thought I'd just let future me deal with that problem. I kept surging when I felt Sunglasses close by. Wasn't sure if she was getting annoyed but I don't think she ever got close enough to overtake.\n\nMy wife and a friend had come to support which was a great boost as I put on a brave face passing them each lap. I didn't want them to see me suffer. I did get a little too excited and surged when I first saw her about halfway, which I paid for later.\n\nAround mile 10 I was starting to feel fatigued with more laboured breathing and legs feeling heavier. I was getting slower despite putting in more effort. I was losing zip on the downhills, where I quite like to use the gravity to accelerate and the ascents were becoming a real pain. Sunglasses looked ready to make her move and I knew better than to go with her as now I knew I'd gone out a little too quick and would start paying dearly for it. I kept her in sight for a while but fell off the pace a little, relying on my time buffer I'd built up.\n\nIt was now becoming such a drag and was starting to need the toilet more despite everything else my body was going through. I just kept counting down the distance and laps as more runners were overtaking me. I knew I just had to hold on to get my target time, using the buffer as needed, trying to keep my form as best as I could.\n\nPenultimate two laps were very painful. Last lap seemed to not progress for a while and I knew that I'd do a little more than my watch distance measurement. The home straight is perhaps the sharpest downhill followed by an ascent. I pushed with as much willpower as I could muster and put on another brave face for the official photo as I crossed the line trying not to look exhausted. I was so glad to see my wife there for me and the end of this race. My watch read 1:44:57 - surely that would be enough. I fell to my knees to catch my breath and gather strength before collecting my hard fought medal.\n\n### Post-race\nChip time came in at 1:44:54 and gun time at 1:44:52. I really felt I'd achieved something and this was a great result of all the training miles so far. No obvious injuries yet (let's see tomorrow). Just two sore feet. I resisted having a beer to celebrate but had a nice Udon meal and Waitrose pink grapefruit juice. It's a great confidence boost for my upcoming marathon, especially after not feeling my best this week and on a tough course!\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http:\/\/sfdavis.com\/racereports\/) created by \/u\/herumph.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1677347577.0},{"title":"Can somebody please explain the benefits of plyometrics?","author":"vcuken","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11bpiyu\/can_somebody_please_explain_the_benefits_of\/","text":"I am trying to learn how to use it better.

I've never been competitive, but I don't consider myself a beginner. I've done about 10 races between 5-10k over the years, so I made my 2023 new year's resolution to complete a half marathon.\n\nI started training in early November. I didn't start from scratch; I could comfortably run \\~4-5 miles at a time, once or twice a week. I usually run on my winding, hilly road near my house, though occasionally I treat myself to a flat trail or bike path.\n\nEach week, I gently increased mileage on a long weekend run with 1-3 other runs per week. I work out 6 days a week, but I cross train a lot. Partially, that's because it's figure skating season and I don't want to miss any sessions. (I'm not competitive anymore, but I enjoy skating 2x a week and running through some drills, spins, and jumps just for fun.)\n\nI also cross trained frequently because I'm generous with listening to my body. Sore knees? Stationary bike today. Blisters on the feet? Upper body or core lifting session.\n\nOne thing I regret not training more is speed work. I can't stand that feeling of rate of perceived exertion (RPE) of anything higher than a 6\/10. I thought incorporating hills and crappy weather conditions would naturally make me faster, but I should've practiced lengthening my stride or quickening the cadence of my feet. During the race, I felt demoralized with how many people using the run\/walk technique passed my old man shuffle, even though I never walked.\n\n## Pre-race\n\nI went in full athlete mode for several days before the race. Despite my usual habits, I ate completely clean and counted some macros. 72 hours before the race I focused on carb-heavy meals.\n\nThe day before the race, I cleaned an empty gallon of milk and drank water from that all day. Dinner was salmon and broccoli linguini with decaf black tea for dessert.\n\nI was out of bed at 5 am for an 8 am start time to give myself time to drink coffee, eat food, digest, and go #1 and #2 before the race. I made two pieces of toast with peanut butter and sliced banana on top with two tablespoons of Greek yogurt on the side. I only ate one piece of the toast because my nerves made my stomach a little queasy.\n\n## Race\n\nHere's why I won't do this race again: the course was approximately 5 kilometers long. We had to run to a turnaround point, run back, run down *again*, and then come back to the finish line.\n\nThis was so demanding on me mentally. To make it more difficult, the course was a plain bike path surrounded by manually landscaped trees (not like a natural woodsy trail).\n\nI'm used to road races either through neighborhoods or in interesting places \u2014 I once ran a 5K through a zoo \u2014 so this race just lacked excitement. There was nobody along the course to cheer us on. There were no interesting neighborhoods to explore. It was just one long, plain bike path. I felt no adrenaline on this race.\n\nIt wasn't *just* us racers, though; the trail wasn't closed to the public, so we'd often have to dodge around pedestrians walking their dogs side by side. My spouse at the finish line even told us there were casual weekend runners running our course, waving aside polite applause and the finisher medals because they were just out for their Sunday jog.\n\nFinally, it was cold. I don't know what I was expecting for a race called the \"hypothermic half marathon,\" but there were less than 150 entries and barely any spectators. I'd guess there were about 2 dozen non runners at the start line, and it was hard to tell who was a volunteer and who was a spectator. The energy was low. For my first half marathon, I wanted more fanfare, but I was just felt like I had only finished a training run by the end of it.\n\n## Post-race\n\nI crashed in a way I haven't felt since I was a competitive athlete at an all-day tournament.\n\nThree quarters through the race, my stomach was *growling*. I felt so hungry in a way I never do on my training runs.\n\nI drank a bottle of water at the finish line and slowly sipped a Gatorade over the following hour. I also ate orange slices and the other half of my breakfast.\n\nWe stopped by Starbucks to get a celebratory matcha latte and cake pop, but I think eating so quickly after the race upset my stomach and I had to stop eating.\n\nBy the time I got home \\~1.5 hours later, I took a hot bath to soothe my frigid body. I should have taken a shower, because I nearly fell asleep in the tub and felt woozy. I got out, sipped more water and Gatorade, and took a nap. A few hours later, I felt more myself, but I had no appetite and had to take some nibbles of dinner.\n\nSo . . . I don't know. I was hoping to feel more celebration during and after the race, and I just feel . . . meh. I achieved the goals I set, but I didn't place as high as I expected. If I go for the marathon, I think I'll plan a fun destination race.\n\nAnd definitely not in the middle of winter.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1677186650.0},{"title":"Official Q&A for Friday, February 24, 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11aj0x2\/official_qa_for_friday_february_24_2023\/","text":"With over 2,325,000 subscribers, there are a lot of posts that come in everyday that are often repeats of questions previously asked or covered in the FAQ.\n\nWith that in mind, this post can be a place for any questions (especially those that may not deserve their own thread).

I got a couple stress fractures and this culminated in my running the second half of the NYC marathon with a broken foot. It sucked and after some medical diagnoses I decided to chill on the marathons and stick to shorter distances. In late summer of 2022, I got COVID and had a rough time. My long COVID symptoms are increased heart rate and shortness of breath, and this happens the same even when I slow my pace to 12-14 minute miles. I did get a clean bill of heart health from a physician before attempting this. I decided to try running a full marathon again since it has been several years. My goals for this were to finish, not break a bone, and have fun!\n\nI did one of Hal Higdon's beginners marathon training plans and was able to stick to it. While I did do every run, I was finding myself needing to take breaks in the middle to let my heart rate go down and catch my breath. I did run the full distances (up to 20 miles), but the breaks were time consuming. I was feeling a little anxious about the race in general. About a week before, I noticed my foot was aching in the exact place I broke it in NYC. I got an X-Ray done and they couldn't see anything, but strongly recommended I not do the full marathon. So, I switched to the half and felt good about doing that.\n\n\nPre-race\n\nDrove to Birmingham the day before the race and was pleasantly surprised that it is an hour ahead of my hometown, so we got an extra hour of sleep. I felt good, we got some dinner, in bed by 9 pm.\n\nRace\n\nMy pre-run breakfast was a banana, a protein bar, oatmeal, and a bottle of water. For the race, I wore a Camelbak with Nuun and took a Huma gel at miles 5 and 10.\n\nWhat I didn't realize going in was that this was the last year this race was going to be held. The director got emotional during her speech at the beginning and everyone seemed legitimately sad to see it end. That made me want to enjoy it even more.\n\nOk, so the actual race. I know, I know, I went out way too fast, that is very clear, but it was downhill and it felt more fun to run with the adrenaline at first. Surprisingly, Birmingham has way more rolling hills than you would think! I could not find an elevation profile for the race beforehand. Almost the entire race past like 4.5 miles was uphill. One nice downhill around mile 8. I had fun, enjoyed the college kids out already drinking and cheering us on, and got a kick out of the guys offering runners ice cold beer. The marathon winner almost lapped me, but I got to see him finish after I was done so that was cool.\n\nPost-race\n\nAll-in-all, a fun race that I finished and did not get injured during! I hope someday I'm able to run a little easier than I have been since injuries\/COVID, but until then I'll keep chugging along and doing races sporadically. I think my full marathon days are behind me, but I'm ok with that! I know this isn't your typical race report, but thanks for reading.\n\n\n\nMade with a new \\[race report generator\\]([http:\/\/sfdavis.com\/racereports\/](http:\/\/sfdavis.com\/racereports\/)) created by \/u\/herumph.","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1677186414.0},{"title":"Race Roll Call","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11aj1ag\/race_roll_call\/","text":"Good morning, Runnit!

Running is probably the only thing I've consistently loved but I've always considered myself a pretty average runner. I've ran Austin Marathon twice before. In fact, it's the only marathon I've EVER ran. The first two times were ran without following a training plan-- you see, I was a night shift nurse and I couldn't ever find a training plan that worked with my inconsistent schedule. It worked well enough somehow! I actually wasn't even planning on running the Austin Marathon again. In fact, back at the beginning of 2022, I had decided I should calm down my running efforts in favor of weight lifting. This was completely trashed when they offered a 50% off code for nurses. I signed up and spent the entire year determined to build a strong base (running about 30-35mpw up until marathon training started).\n\nThis worked out pretty well until about September when I began to develop a gnarly ear infection that just could not fixed despite multiple rounds of antibiotics\/ENT visits. Finally, I got placed on a fluoroquinolone antibiotic and I was aware that some of the side effects were joint paint\/tendonditis\/possible tendon rupture. I didn't think much of it and proceeded to go on a very late honeymoon with my husband which was basically a giant hiking trip in the Canadian Rockies. My legs began to hurt but I contributed this to the obscene amount of walking\/hiking we did, and when we returned back to Austin, I still had ear symptoms and was placed on a second round. My wrists and hands then began to hurt and it wasn't until I finished the course that I remembered those side effects. So hey, just a fyi to anyone unaware. I spent the next couple of weeks having to baby my joints and throwing my running plans away so that was a pain in the ass.\n\nI chose to run with Hanson's Beginner Marathon because somehow the idea of higher mileage weeks and a cap of a 16 mile long run sounded more appealing to me than having to run 1-2 20 mile long runs, haha. That plan was tough, though. The T\/Th interval and tempo runs were a struggle for me as I've never been a morning runner-- so having to tack on 10+ mile runs after work wasn't always ideal. I will admit that I did feel like a badass for mostly following the entire plan-- I wasn't perfect, but it didn't matter. This was the first time I ever successfully ran 50+ mpw with speed work incorporated and it was a cool little accomplishment by itself.\n\nI also just want to mention that this was the first time I ever learned about the 80\/20 rule and I am a complete convert. I was struggling with having some near debilitating calf pain early on in the training (an issue that caused my to have to switch my marathon to the half marathon a previous year) and I was randomly listening to a running podcast on a run that talked about taking easy runs actually easy. As soon as I incorporated that, my calf pain completely stopped. It also made running WAY more enjoyable. So anyhow-- my intervals were ran at 09:00-09:15, tempo runs were 09:30-09:45 and easy runs were somewhere between 10:30-11:30.\n\nLucky me, the day before bib pick up, I was taking a walk and somehow managed to completely rip open the back of my heel while wearing a pair of shoes that has never caused me any issues before. So that was cool. Thank goodness for hydrocolloid bandages and tegaderm because that shit hurt and the idea of running a marathon with a ripped up heel sounded HORRIFYING.\n\n# Pre-race\n\nMy older brother flew in from California to run the half marathon with me. He hadn't properly trained and had never run this race before, so his plan was just to try to \"keep up\" with me. I never in a million years would imagine someone would try to keep up with my marathon pace, but it was flattering at least. We had pizza that Friday night with our immediate family, and then Sunday we had ramen (literally my favorite race food!). I managed to get into bed at 9:30pm and set my alarm for 3:30am as the plan was for me to drive to my parents house so that my dad could drop me and my brother off together.\n\nMorning of I was able to down a nuun and eat a packet of overnight oats (literally my favorite long run food). We made it to the race and were able to find parking with enough time for us to warm up. I ended up running a couple of laps and managed to find a $20 on the ground at one point, lol. I gave it to my dad to hold who then lost it, so maybe it made its way into someone else's deserving hands.\n\n# Race\n\nMiles 1-3 are gradually uphill so I was aware to go out slow. My plan was 10:00-10:30 for the first 3, and then to comp some time for miles 3-6 which is mostly downhill and then settle in for my goal pace of 9:40-45ish. I remember thinking about how it was already too warm\/humid for my preferences, which was a big worry of mine the days before. My ideal running temp is more close to 40s (despite living in Texas, don't @ me, I hate it here) and it was supposed to be 50s to 60s and overcast-- not perfect, but I could cope if it wasn't ridiculously sunny at least. By mile 3 I was already sweating profusely. I had a hand bottle that my dad planned on refilling for me around mile 18-- so in order to conserve it, I decided to then hit every water station after mile 6 or so for both nuun and water. I had paid A LOT more attention to fueling in my training plan this go so I was determined to stay fueled and hydrated.\n\nBy mile 6, I was feeling mostly good but after the downhill subsided, I remember talking with my brother who remarked he was almost half way! Almost? I said it was mile 7, he was past the half way mark! Turns out I had looked at my watch, saw 6.07 and thought it was 7. Somehow that stood out to me as the part of the race where I knew I was going to get into trouble eventually, lol. Thinking it was mile 7 and it was actually mile 6 and being upset about it.\n\nBy mile 8-9 we were approaching another hill. Like I've mentioned, I've ran the Austin Marathon 2 times before and the half probably an additional 2-3 times so I'm well aware of where I'm going to suffer. I was starting to get hot and it was way sunnier than I anticipated, so this dumb hill really wasn't something I was down for this go around and I apologize to anyone who didn't want to listen to me say FUCK over and over on that hill. Normally I LOVE hills but today, I just was too hot\/sweaty to love it.\n\nBetween miles 9-12ish, my brother distracted me by randomly shouting EVERY sign we ran by, which was actually quite entertaining (including the ones that are cheering on an individual-- like GO TOM! He'd shout those, too, lol). I had set my eyes on a gal in front of me and tried to keep her pace as motivation-- eventually I caught her and was disappointed to see she had a half bib. She was super nice though and we chatted for a bit before splitting off.\n\nThat horrible hill on Enfield appeared, finally. I've run this hill so many times but had long before decided that the hill wasn't worth the energy this go around. Speed walking up seemed more efficient than running and I had to conserve energy for the second half of the race. No regrets about this. That hill is really quite evil. After we finished, I congratulated my brother and waved him goodbye and went on my merry way to run my second half.\n\nInteresting enough, I find that I do a better job of keeping myself motivated when running solo so the next couple of miles were not bad. My watch was showing me at pace or below (such a bummer-- it was obviously off compared to the chip times) so I focused on picking out individual people ahead of me to try to chase down or stay close to. That actually wasn't too bad because there were A LOT more people running the marathon this year in comparison to my previous races (they actually sold out the marathon for the first time, apparently).\n\nAfter those few good solo miles, the heat and direct sun (overcast was a fucking lie) started to get to me. I was stupid hot, completely soaked in sweat, and I didn't even want to take in my gels (I had brought huma gels, salt tabs and some sour patch kids). I managed to stomach the gels according to plan, and sip on my water bottle, but decided I needed to start walking through the water stations to make sure I got both nuun and water in and give myself a break.\n\nBy mile 16 I had started to feel like I had a rock in my left shoe near the ball of my foot. I kept trying to shake my foot around but it wouldn't move. I debated stopping to try and pull it out but I was nervous about the time that would take, so I let it go. I mean there was only 10 miles left-- I've ran plenty of 10 mile runs before so I figured I could suffer it out for 10 miles.\n\nBy mile 18 I was looking desperately for my family as they were supposed to cheer me on around there and my dad was supposed to run with me for a few miles. They ended up showing at mile 19 and it was such a relief. My dad refilled my hand water bottle and gave me some cara cara orange slices (probably the only thing that tasted remotely good at this point). I kept telling him I was dying (dramatic, but hey), it was way too hot, there was some dumb rock in my shoe. I told him I knew I couldn't PR. In return, he told me multiple times that I was so strong, I was doing great and that he was so proud of me. My dad is the best, you guys. He left me at mile 21 so they could try and catch me finish.\n\nAt this point, I knew a PR wasn't possible, so I accepted the only solution here was to just give it my all and finish strong regardless. I was so hot, it was so sunny and by now I realized the \"rock in my shoe\" was actually a huge blister forming that fucking hurt. So many people were walking around me that the idea of walking sounded so much easier, but I decided I had to run to each water station where I could walk to drink my nuun\/water, and then run some more. I knew I'd be pissed if I didn't at least do that. Shout out to the volunteers at the water stations, by the way. Many of them read my bib, called me out by name, and this somehow managed to slap some motivation into me when I really needed it.\n\nBy mile 25-26ish, you see that final hill everyone talks about. I ran this stupid hill both years before but I just didn't have it in me. People were shouting all around me things like \"you can do it!\" and in my head, I just kept thinking, \"how do you know?!\" and mouthing that I was dying, lol. I managed to run the crest of the hill and someone reminded me it was all downhill from there, so I pulled some inkling of strength out of my dying body and managed to start running.\n\nThat last part of the race is always the best. There are so many people cheering that you feel like it's all for you. I remember feeling like there were no other runners near me, so it MUST be for me and it really hit me hard. I started full on running (the downhill helped here, ha!), feeling like I had to really kick here and be deserving of the cheering all around me. I started tearing up as I crossed the finish line.\n\n# Post-race\n\nImmediately after finishing when I started walking, I started to get a calf cramp and nearly fell over but managed to catch myself at least and hobble over to get my medal. I didn't care and I was basking in glory of it all. I knew it wasn't a PR, which should have upset me because this was the first time I've REALLY trained for a marathon, but I just didn't care. I raced my own race, kicked my own ass and had nothing left in the tank at the end. That was enough for me. I was proud of myself.\n\nTurns out my family couldn't catch my finish but that it didn't matter. It was enough that they all were there (even my older brother showed up again at mile 18 to cheer for me!). My husband found me first and I immediately started sobbing when I saw him and hugged him. There is just something about finishing a marathon that always makes me emotional. The rest of my family showed up after and gave me hugs and congratulations as well, including my dad.\n\nI then hobbled about a mile to the car, drove to a coffee shop, then whole foods for beer and then home for my dad to cook everyone breakfast (even though it was 1pm at this point, haha). The rest of the day was honestly not great-- I couldn't tolerate much food after, my stomach was in knots, my quads were completely shot and I definitely DID have a huge blister on the ball of my foot...  Plus one of my toes is definitely bruised and might fall off. And then I couldn't sleep at all that night.\n\nBut despite all of that-- I'm definitely going to run another marathon. Just maybe not Austin again.\n\nMade with a new \\[race report generator\\] [http:\/\/sfdavis.com\/racereports\/](http:\/\/sfdavis.com\/racereports\/) created by \/u\/herumph.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1677127285.0},{"title":"Race Report - San Silvestre Vallecana","author":"Lurking_Sessional","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11a3qi4\/race_report_san_silvestre_vallecana\/","text":"Apologies for the lateness in posting this - it's been a busy 2 months!\n\n### Race Information\n* **Name:** NN San Silvestre Vallecana\n* **Date:** December 31, 2022\n* **Distance:** 10 km\n* **Location:** Madrid, Spain\n* **Time:** 1:11:07\n\n### Goals\n| Goal | Description | Completed? |\n|------|-------------|------------|\n| A | To finish | *Yes* |\n| B | Sub 70 minutes | *No* |\n\n### Splits\n| Kilometer | Time |\n|------|------|\n| 1 | 8:49\n| 2 | 6:48\n| 3 | 6:50\n| 4 | 6:08\n| 5 | 6:29\n| 6 | 6:50\n| 7 | 6:42\n| 8 | 6:35\n| 9 | 6:48\n| 10 | 6:17\n\n### Training\nAfter finishing an 8K in October and rehabbing my hip flexor, I thought it would be smooth sailing through to December. Then I had dental surgery in early November and caught Covid mid November. I managed a few training runs in December, but Covid did a real number on me and every run was an absolute slog. Things were starting to improve mid December, but all my training plans got tossed out the window when a snowstorm left us couch surfing for 4 days, then the airline lost our luggage (and all our running clothes, shoes). So it was a scramble to just get everything together for the race. And with 2 small kids who wanted to see and do EVERYTHING, training turned into full days walking around Madrid (averaging at least 11km a day).\n\n### Pre-race\nMy Spanish MIL made sure carb-loading was no problem. My partner and I planned to run this together, so we had a really mellow day. \n\nOnce we got to Santiago Bernabeu (where the race began), the atmosphere was amazing. Very well organized and signed. Tens of thousands of people getting sorted into their various waves. A DJ up front with a massive soundsystem. Giant beach balls, lights, smoke machine and fireworks - the whole vibe was a like we were at a rave and a race broke out! \n\nDefinitely had some nerves just before the race began. I wasn't sure I'd be able to finish it.\n\n### Race\nWith around 40000 participants this year, it was a very slow start. A gentle uphill right out the gate. Once we hit the first flat (around 1km) we came to an absolute stop. Still not sure what happened, but I think someone fell and they needed to stop the race for a minute.\n\nAfter that, it was absolutely spectacular. We weren't racing to make a good time, as there were just too many people for that, but for the experience. It was sunset when the race began and all the Christmas lights were on as we ran down Calle Serrano (fancy Prada store to one side), around Cibeles, down the Paseo del Prado and to Atocha. Every few kilometers, there was a steel drum band or another DJ. At one point, a choir singing Christmas carols. Little kids along the side of the road giving out high fives. Around the 8km mark we passed Atocha and entered Vallecas, which while it lacked Christmas lights and decorations, had hundreds of folks lined up along the street to cheer us along, which we needed because the last 2km was a slow and steady climb up a hill. When we hit 1km left, we took everything we had left in our legs and went for it.\n\n### Post-race\nA blur! With so many participants, the volunteers were very organized at getting us through the finish area, giving us a bag with food and drinks, and then we were off to the metro station. The metro car was a little rank (it was full of sweaty runners!), but everyone was in pretty good (although exhausted) spirits. By the time we got home, it was time for New Years' Eve dinner. We feasted and then collapsed as soon as we were done with the uvas. \n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http:\/\/sfdavis.com\/racereports\/) created by \/u\/herumph.","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1677174227.0},{"title":"2nd half marathon; Seaside, FL","author":"umumgowa","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/119ck3c\/2nd_half_marathon_seaside_fl\/","text":"Race Information\n\nName: Seaside Half Marathon\n\nDate: 02\/19\/23\n\nDistance: 13.1 miles\n\nTime: 1:59:20\n\nGoals\n\nGoal\tDescription\tCompleted?\n\nA\tPR from 2:15\tYes\n\nB\tSub 2hr\tYes\n\n\nMile\tTime\n\n1\t9:00\n\n2\t8:55\n\n3\t9:00\n\n4\t8:51\n\n5\t8:58\n\n6\t9:00\n\n7\t9:02\n\n8\t9:07\n\n9\t9:08\n\n10\t9:17\n\n11\t9:19\n\n12\t9:19\n\n13\t9:06\n\n14\t7:56\n\n\nTraining\n\nPrior to training I had been running exactly one year. I started in November of 2021 where I trained for my first ever half marathon the following February and I completed that in 2:16 minutes. From last February until this past November I just maintained around 15-20 miles a week running about a ten min mile for most all runs. Staring this past November I did TrackClubBabes fast half training plan to prepare for this half. I loved this plan! She really harps on no grey zone running. Youre either running really fast or really slow. It was split as Monday intervals, Tuesday slow, Thursday Tempo, Saturday long, and then an optional slow or crosstraining on Sunday. I found the speed workouts to be so challenging that I really had no choice but to run slower on slow days. Most slow days were ran around 11:30-12 min miles. \n\nPre-race\n\nPre race I got a super sweet cold which was right on track for me as I ran my first half on day 10 of a covid quarantine. I skipped my last couple taper runs in order to rest more and get better before race day. I somewhat succeeded but still had a pretty good cough on race days and my resting heart rate was still high 60s compared to my normal low 50s. \n\nRace\n\nThe race was beautiful. It was 40 and cloudy to start which I loved but it was an out and back and by time we turned around the clouds had cleared and I was running straight into the sun for 6.5 miles. Id love to say I felt great for this run but I did not.  I started with the 9:00 pacers and as I only needed to maintain 9:09 I kept track of how much time I was \"banking\" at the beginning. The first 6ish miles were pretty decent and then I started having to dig a little more and by 8 miles I was wondering if I should give up my goals and just run slower and enjoy it. I added up the time I could waste and broke away from the pacers and ran a few miles closer to 9:20 to see if that could get me through. I still felt crap by time I did that and hit mile 11 but at that point I was so close to doing it I just could not give up. I love to tell myself \"Minds the general, bodies the army\" but by mile 11 I was mostly saying \"just dont fuck this up now\". Eventually, I rounded for the last half mile and could see the finish line and all the people cheering and it was sweet relief. I finished under 2 by the gun time so it was nice to not have to wonder if I had made it right as I crossed. \n\nPost-race\n\nPost race my husband handed me a cold beer and I had quite a few with my friends on the beach afterwards. All in all, I reached my goal and had a nice day. One thing I would really change is the carbs I had during the race. I had a bar about 2hrs before and then a huma about 15 minutes before. I had always practiced taking three humas on my long runs but as I had not been racing them I didnt realize Id really want four for the half. I had my third and last huma around mile 8 and definitely could have gone for another.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1677099187.0},{"title":"My First 100km (HK100 race report)","author":"qwertyreadonly","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/118vth2\/my_first_100km_hk100_race_report\/","text":"### Race Information\n* **Name:** HK100\n* **Date:** February 18, 2023\n* **Distance:** 103km, 5200mD+ (64 miles, 17,000 feet of elevation gain) \n* **Location:** Hong Kong\n* **Time:** 21:32\n\n### Goals\n| Goal | Description | Completed? |\n|------|-------------|------------|\n| A | <22hrs (for a silver trophy) | *Yes* |\n| B | Finish! | *Yes* |\n\n\n### Training\nSince November, I\u2019ve been working with a coach who is an experienced ultra-runner here in Hong Kong, so I follow his instructions. \n\nEssentially the plan was to build up the volume of running I was doing - around 70-80km\/week , get lots of elevation in (many many stair repeats as there are thousands of concrete stairs on the course) and recce the course itself. I also did some bodyweight strength exercises for legs and core, and lots of stretching (I like hot yoga classes). \n\nI\u2019ve also done few ~50km trail races in the last 6 months, including an overnight one on the last half of this same course, where I did everything wrong and felt terrible the entire time. Lessons were learnt in the hard way!\n\n### Pre-race\nIn the week leading up to the race I thoroughly went over my strategy and made sure I had everything I needed (e.g lots of apple sauce flavour spring food energy gels!).\nOn race day I got up at 5:15 having slept surprisingly well, had some toast with PB and a coffee, met up with friends also doing the race and shared a taxi to the start line. Tried to feel positive and excited rather than nervous.\n\n### Race!\nI was in wave 2 to start (8:08am) and the beginning was very crowded, plus everyone feels good and strong at that point so wants to speed up. But I had a plan to stick to my zone 2 HR, and when my friend ran the first uphill, I just thought.. OK, bye!\nThe first ~50km has quite a lot of flat-ish runnable sections, and just a few big climbs - very tempting to go fast but I stuck religiously to zone 2 HR and ate lots of food at each check point. \nIt was getting pretty hot during the day (25C\/ 77F) and I was starting to see a lot of people looking worn down. But I can do hot weather, just kept my HR in check. \n\nI felt pretty good the whole first 50km, then there is a big climb before going down to the 55km checkpoint, going up there were so many people struggling around me and the difficulty of the 2nd half was starting to feel very daunting. \nBut then I got to the CP and got such a great boost from the energy there, that continuing felt natural. I got my poles and headlamp from my drop bag there. It was now just over 10 hours into the race with 45km and 3000m elevation to go. \n\nThere\u2019s a really big climb about 65km in where I was really struggling and doubting myself. Then I had the thought, if I DNF, i\u2019ll have to try again starting from the beginning! That did not appeal, so I pushed on. \nI was delighted to see my friend I\u2019d started with again at the next CP (70km ish in)- I realised I\u2019d been feeling lonely - we ran together for ~8km until I began to struggle at the next big climb and couldn\u2019t keep up. \nIt was a stunningly clear night and the view over the city was just phenomenal.\n\nBetween 80-85km the course is quite runnable but I was struggling to run and had to make do with power hiking. This is also a part where a lot of aggressive monkeys live (I got chased a few weeks ago!) so I had my poles at the ready for self-defence! Luckily I didn\u2019t see any, only heard creepy noises. I just focussed on getting to the next check point. Once I reached there, I was confident I would finish. (There is a very tempting road with many taxis going by at ~80km, but after that no easy exit!)\n\nBetween CP8 at 86km and the finish line are the hardest climbs - Needle hill (stairs), grassy hill (uphill road), all the way down to CP9 at Lead mine pass (stairs), then rocky\/stairs climb up Sze Fong Shan, then steep uphill road to the highest point of the course (and of Hong Kong), Tai Mo Shan at 97km. \nI was watch-checking on the final climbs, as all women who finish under 22 hours get a silver finishing trophy. \nThere is a huge rush of relief at the top, knowing it is (almost) all down hill from here.\nI tried to give it my all and run, but I was running like an elderly person, my feet could hardly get off the ground. Then after the point where my watch said 100km, there is more stairs! Some of them upwards! Then a very steep long set of stairs down to the finish line. A cruel and unnecessary route choice since there is also a road to the bottom!! \n\n### Post-race\nI thought I might cry at the finish line but I held it in. I met with the same friend again who had finished 20mins ahead of me (also her first 100km!) and we shared an Uber home. I had a lot of mud and sweat  to wash off and a very large blister on my toe so I dealt with that then slept for a few hours. \nI was definitely glad I had booked Monday off work!\nIt is now Wednesday evening and I have some residual aching and tiredness but overall I feel fine, looking forward to running again (though will hard pass on stairs for a while).  I bargained with myself during the race that I\u2019d never do another 100km but I know fine well that I will. \nI don\u2019t often feel proud of myself but I am very glad I saw this race through to the end. Of ~1800 runners starting, ~600 DNF\u2019d. My time was in the top 50% of finishers both in women\u2019s category and overall. My next target race is a road marathon at the end of May which will also be a first for me. \n\nHaving my coach give me a structured training plan and race strategy that I just had to execute helped in so many ways. It also helped immeasurably that I am familiar with the terrain (hard! Stairs!) in HK and I knew the 2nd half of the course extremely well. Also, the atmosphere was fantastic, the checkpoints and volunteers gave me such an amazing boost each time. \n\nI am happy to answer any questions about the race :) \n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http:\/\/sfdavis.com\/racereports\/) created by \/u\/herumph.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1677065351.0},{"title":"Official Q&A for Thursday, February 23, 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/119p1jq\/official_qa_for_thursday_february_23_2023\/","text":"With over 2,325,000 subscribers, there are a lot of posts that come in everyday that are often repeats of questions previously asked or covered in the FAQ.\n\nWith that in mind, this post can be a place for any questions (especially those that may not deserve their own thread).

I think I saw someone ask about it not too long ago too.  I'll start with an overview of the book, then the training plans, and finally a race report for the actual results of following it.\n\n\n### Background:\n\nI started running in July of 2022.  I maybe could have titled this something like \u201cCouch to Marathon\u201d but, in fairness to my past self\u2019s athletic ability, I did about half of Couch to 5k sometime during 2020 and go to the gym regularly where I usually do 15-20 minutes of cardio (mainly incline walking or rowing machine).  I also did sports in high school, which may be important just for injury prevention.  Anyways, some friends had run the 2022 half marathon earlier that year, and I wanted to join them for 2023.  I picked up Hansons First Marathon since I thought it might be good for someone starting from nothing but with longer distances in mind.  However, the book asserted that, by following the training plans, I could not just survive, but really race a full marathon in 26-30 weeks starting from nothing.  There were exactly 30 weeks till the Austin Marathon when I picked up the book, so I decided to go for it.  After I started training, I also decided to join the Austin Distance Challenge: a series of races consisting of a 5k, 10k, 10-mile, two half marathons, and finally the Austin Marathon.\n\n### The Book:\n\nHansons First Marathon is a book for people who are either not runners or more recreational runners that want to tackle the marathon.  It\u2019s probably targeting people who aren\u2019t into running (yet), but see running a marathon as a cool bucket list type of thing.  It\u2019s also often said that the standard Hanson\u2019s beginner plan ([on their website](https:\/\/hansons-running.com\/pages\/training-plans)) is not really for beginners, so this could be filling that gap.  It starts off with who the book is for and how to use it, the Hansons training philosophy, then goes into explaining the physiological side of running (VO2 max, Anaerobic\/aerobic thresholds, etc) and the different types of workouts needed to train these qualities.  I\u2019ll get more into the workouts later.  After that there are several training plans:\n\n* 0-5k (8 weeks): For complete beginners, basically couch to 5k\n* From Scratch (18 week): For first time marathoners\u2014you\u2019re supposed to do this after 0-5k, or if you\u2019re a beginner runner\n* Just Finish (18 weeks): For first time marathoners who don\u2019t have a time goal; there are no workouts in this plan, but you actually run a little bit more than in the from scratch plan.\n* Advanced First timer (18 weeks): For people with more experience who want to try a marathon\n* Express (12 weeks): Shorter plan for someone who has come off other races.\n\nThere are also instructions on how to modify plans for races\/injuries\/illness\/life in general.  The next section is dedicated to strategy: how to pick your goals, cross training\/strength training\/stretching, nutrition, recovery, and other extra info.  Finally, there is a section with more detailed instructions on things to do leading up to the marathon, planning for the actual race, and how to recover afterwards.  I\u2019ll get more into how I felt about the training plans and the results but some things I noted about the book in general:\n\n* The physiology parts are really nice.  Since I got Hansons First Marathon, I\u2019ve also gotten Jack Daniel\u2019s Running Formula, Faster Road Racing (Pfitzinger), and 80\/20 running\u2014all of which discuss the science of running at some point\u2014but I feel like Hansons had the most concise and readable explanations.\n* The clear explanations might be because they focus on marathons only.  The books mentioned above go over more types of running.\n* It\u2019s a little obvious where passages are lifted from the Hansons Marathon Method book\u2014if you already have that book this is probably not worth picking up unless you REALLY want these training plans.\n* The sections that really stand out to me are the ones that discuss things like modifying the plans, how to strategize for tune up races\/the marathon, fueling.  These more minute details of following plans and what to actually do on race day aren\u2019t described as much in other books, and they were extremely useful as I made my way through the races for the distance challenge.  I definitely read through these sections many times and, going over them now, wish I had looked at them even more in preparation for the actual marathon.  The detailed post-race plan is also nice.\n* Conversely, I didn\u2019t use the strength\/flexibility training or general nutrition info at all, so I can\u2019t speak to the efficacy of those.  I mostly kept going to the gym and lifting weights, though that went from 3 days to week, to 2 days, and in the last couple weeks just 1 day.  I probably should have been better about stretching.\n\n### Training Plans: \n\n*General Info*\n\n* I followed most of 0-5k (weeks 4-8), had a few weeks of building up mileage, and then the From Scratch program, so that\u2019s what I\u2019ll be reviewing.\n* Plans are based on goal pace, which is picked by comparing prior race results (can be adjusted based on races run early in the training plan).\n* There are 5 types of runs: easy, speed, strength, tempo, and long.  Everything that isn\u2019t an easy run is considered a \u201cSomething of Substance\u201d (SOS) run (i.e. a quality run).\n* Easy\/Long runs are done in the same range of paces.  There\u2019s a big table showing all the exact numbers but the heuristic they give is 1-2 minutes slower per mile than your goal marathon pace.  For example, if your goal was a 4-hour marathon, marathon pace would be 9:09\/mile, and easy\/long run pace would roughly be 10:09 \u2013 11:09\/mile.  The longest run in Hansons plans is 16 miles.\n* Speed workouts are intervals done at 10k pace with jogging recoveries.  On the standard plans they show 5k \u2013 10k pace, but the book just shows 10k pace.  Maybe because it\u2019s more geared for beginners?\n* Strength workouts are longer intervals done at 10 seconds per mile faster than goal marathon pace.  Again, for a goal of a 4-hour marathon, this would be around 8:59 per mile.\n* Tempo runs are runs done at marathon pace.\n* The program follows reverse periodization\u2014you start off with a little easy running, add tempo\/speed, then replace speed with strength.  The idea is to get more specific as you train, so the strength workouts are done at the end because they are closer to actual marathon pace. \n\n*0-5k*\n\nThere isn\u2019t much to say about it\u2014there\u2019s a million similar programs out there\u2014but a couple things I like about it:\n\n* The recovery\/walking parts are kept short.  I think the last time I did couch to 5k, it started off 1 min running\/1 min walking, then eventually get up to like, 5\/3, then 8\/5, and so on but the Hanson\u2019s version keeps the walking portions at 1 minute.  I think this makes more sense.\n* It\u2019s 4 days per week.  I think this helps getting you used to running consecutive days from the get go.\n\n*From Scratch*\n\nThis is where things get interesting.  Breakdown\/thoughts:\n\n* You run 5 days per week, peaking at 46.5 miles per week, with two SOS days.  If you want to get an idea of what it looks like, you can take the beginner plan on the Hanson\u2019s website, and replace the alternating short Sunday runs with the tempo runs, so it\u2019s something like:\n\nMon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Sat | Sun\n---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----\nOff | Easy | Speed\/Strength | Off | Easy | Easy | Long\/Tempo |\n\n\n\n\n* I picked a goal time of 4 hours, which was definitely a little spicy.  The 10-mile race of the distance challenge fell on week 3 of the program, and I told myself that I had permission to go for sub 4 if I got under 1.5 hours there.  I ended up running it in 1:29:06.  Going by the Hansons chart, an appropriate goal time would have been 4:10.  VDOT shows something like 37, for around a 4:05.  Still, I prayed for novice gains and, though I don\u2019t really trust this number, my Garmin was predicting 3:55 just before the race, so I feel like the fitness might be there\u2026in ideal conditions.\n* Paces I used: Easy 10:15-11:30, Tempo 9:05-9:15, Strength 8:50-9:05, Speed 8:15-8:30.  These are exactly what's suggested in the book, but these numbers were easier to remember and I gave myself a decent range for each category, since I still kind of suck at keeping paces.\n* I really like easy running.  Maybe it\u2019s because I started off with keeping easy miles easy in my head, but it\u2019s kind of funny when I read about people who struggle to run slow.  There\u2019s a passage in the book about how it\u2019s nice that, for a lot of your mileage you should be able to really enjoy it and take in the scenery, and I totally agree.  Anecdotally, one of the people who did the half in 2022\/2023 joined me on a lot of runs.  They are faster than me\/have been running for a while, but had some trouble with injuries in the past.  This year they didn\u2019t have any major issues and attributed it to running with me.\n* That said, the build-up in volume is not easy.  I especially started to feel it after it got past ~35 mpw.  I think this is probably why the book says \u201c26-30 weeks\u201d of training even though the 0-5k program is 8 weeks and the From Scratch program is 18 weeks.\n* Probably related is that, I definitely had some aches and pains pop up while training.  I had some foot pain around week 4, then later it was shin splints for around week 15, and finally in the last couple of weeks I had some hip pain that stayed with me till race day.  The first two issues only lasted a few days, and the pain was always the type that would go away after running a bit, so I never felt overtrained.  But having more time to build up probably could\u2019ve helped me avoid those.\n* Summing all the above, do I think this program fills the gap between the standard Hansons beginner plan and not running at all?  Yes, but it's still compromised.  If someone were to ask me now, \u201cHey I\u2019m active but I\u2019m a little overweight and don\u2019t run at all, how long should I prepare for a marathon?\u201d  I would probably say closer to a year.   But if you are someone who doesn\u2019t run at all, planning out a year of training probably seems insane, and 7 months is already pushing it.  And, while the program definitely seems tougher than other true novice marathon programs I see floating around (Higdon, Galloway), it really just means you\u2019ll be better prepared.  So whether or not this book\/program suits you depends on how much time and energy you\u2019re able to dedicate to it.\n* There\u2019s a lot of discussion about the 16 mile long run, and it seems like most people following a Hansons plan change at least one of them to be 18 or even 20 miles long.  My longest was 16.3.  The book points out that the 16 mile rule comes up because 20 is an arbitrary number, and 16 is a sort of sweet spot between the general rules of having your long run be 2.5-3 hours long and 25-30% of your total training volume.  Also, thanks to cumulative fatigue, it should really feel like the last 16 miles of the marathon.  This all makes sense to me BUT:\n* Peak mileage is 46.5 miles per week, so 16 is 35% (30% is 14 miles).  Also at my easy pace, I barely would run these under 3 hours.  It isn\u2019t that far out but it\u2019s still kind of funny that they rag on 20 being an arbitrary number then stick with 16.  Maybe it\u2019s because it\u2019s then Hansons signature long run, but it might also be an acknowledgement that at some point, you have to build up some distance.\n* Even though I would say I\u2019m cumulative fatigue pilled, and really enjoyed the program, I feel like I have to caveat this all with the fact that, to spoil the report, I really started feeling the race when I got a calf cramp at mile 16.  Later, I ended up slowing down right around the 3-hour mark.  Would having any of those runs be 18 miles\/3.5 hours+ long change anything?  Probably not, but I can\u2019t help but think what if haha.\n* I thought I did a good job at following the program near perfectly, but looking at my notes I only ran 2 weeks following the program exactly (oops).  This was mostly accommodating for races and the holidays, and I still hit 95% of the miles in the program.  The section of the book that discussed modifying the plans really helped me not stress out about these events.  The days I truly skipped (not just moved around or cut short) were either replaced with cross training or in the taper.\n* The Strength workouts kicked my ass.  I felt really confident going into where the strength workouts replace the speed workouts\u2014had some good races, felt great on tempo runs, easy pace was feeling easier.  But I ended up dreading\/modifying these workouts the most, either cutting them a little short or doing them at tempo\/marathon pace instead.  I think this is partially because it got a lot warmer when I started doing these.\n* Somewhere, Luke Humphrey (the author) has stated something like, \"If you\u2019re falling asleep into your dinner plate, you\u2019re doing it right.\"  Funnily enough, one day I actually did fall asleep at my desk for a few minutes after I had set down dinner.\n* \u201cTaper blues\u201d hit me hard.  My appetite and sleep got worse, and I started feeling that aforementioned hip pain more.  I skipped a couple of the runs scheduled in the taper.  It was probably just nerves, but intuitively I feel like this is a sign that the plan peaked me pretty well.\n\n### The Race:\nAlright, the review is over and now you can all leave this long ass post or go to the comments for questions. Here's the race report though.  I did the laps manually but didn\u2019t do a great job of it, so the paces are approximations (actual chip times on the right).\n\n* **Name:** Austin Marathon\n* **Location:** Austin, TX, USA\n* **Website:** https:\/\/youraustinmarathon.com\/\n* **Date:** February 19, 2023\n\n### Goals\n| Goal | Description | Completed? |\n|------|-------------|------------|\n| A | Sub 4 | *No* |\n| B | Finish | *Yes* |\n\n### Splits\n\n\n| Mile | Pace | Distance | Time |\n|------|------| - | -|\n| 1 | 9:48 | \n| 2 | 9:43 | \n| 3 | 9:08 | 5K | 30:09\n| 4 | 8:57 | \n| 5 | 8:34 | \n| 6 | 8:40 | 10K | 57:21\n| 7 | 8:47 | \n| 8 | 8:51 | \n| 9 | 9:21 | 15K | 1:25:36\n| 10 | 9:20 | \n| 11 | 9:17 | \n| 12 | 9:25 | 20K | 1:55:03\n| 13 | 9:36 | \n| 14 | 9:22 | HALF | 2:01:29\n| 15 | 9:33 | \n| 16 | 9:18 | 25K | 2:24:35\n| 17 | 9:25 | \n| 18 | 9:41 | \n| 19 | 9:24 | 30K | 2:54:13\n| 20 | 10:09 | \n| 21 | 11:11 | \n| 22 | 11:32 | 35K | 3:27:37\n| 23 | 15:11 | \n| 24 | 15:28 | \n| 25 | 15:28 | 40K | 4:15:30\n| 26.2 | 12:05 | **FINISH** | **4:32:18**\n\n### Pre-race\nSlept at 9 PM, woke up around 2, laid in bed till 3:30.  Over the course of the next 3.5 hours consumed: 2 cups of coffee (weak, just to help me poop), 1 sesame bagel, 1.5 servings of nuun endurance, 1 pack of gu energy chews (watermelon), and, after getting to the start and meeting my friends, an energy gel (gu roctane coffee).  While experimenting in training I have had pretty much no issues with eating and running, although I was a little scared of the sesame bagel since I had been attempting to carb load with them and suspected they were giving me diarrhea (not while running).\n\n### Race\n\n*The Plan*: The Austin Marathon is somewhat notoriously hilly\u2014a lot of people told me that it was a tough choice for a first marathon.  The elevation profile is on the website but It\u2019s basically 3 miles of uphill, 3 miles of downhill, rolling hills till 21, then flat till the last 3\/4 mile.  My plan was to take the first 3 miles slow, not go too fast on the downhill, then stay slower than 9:05 ish while keeping a few times in my head so I could calculate splits (2:00 at the half, 2:45 at mile 18, 3:12 at mile 21).  I took 7 gels with me to take every 3 miles (1x blackberry, 2x watermelon, 2x strawberry banana, 1x lemon lime, 1x honey stinger fruit smoothie), and also planned to get nuun at least every other aid station.  Weather felt a little warm and humid to me (went from about 50-70 over the race).\n\n*The First Half*: I was with my friends at the start, but I let them go immediately since they were doing the half.  The first 6 miles went according to plan.  I still had a bit of hip pain, which felt like it was spreading to my left hamstring around mile 8.  Going into the hills before where the full and the half courses split up, I was feeling controlled but unsure, like something could pop up at any moment.  But fueling was going well and, since we had started in the back, I had been passing people the whole time.\n\n*After 13.1*: I was still feeling in control after 13.1.  I was feeling okay about my time\u2014I wanted closer to 2:00 but had heard that the first half of the course was more difficult than the second half.  Looking back now, I think I subconsciously knew something was wrong here, as I started to drink at every aid station, sometimes grabbing multiple drinks.  At one aid station I dumped water over the back of my neck which felt great.  I was still passing people as well.  One woman I passed was joined by a spectator for a little bit, and I overheard some their conversation.  I don\u2019t know what she was aiming for (maybe sub 4 as well?) but I heard her say, \u201cI\u2019m just trying to keep it under 9:30 now so I can get it over with faster\u201d.  \n\n*Troubles Begin*: Mile 16 (!) was when I really knew there was trouble as, out of nowhere, the slight but lingering pain in my hamstring shot into my calf and my leg seized up.  I almost collapsed and let out and audible \u201cow\u201d, but somehow, after 15 or 20 steps of limping, it seemed to calm down and I was able to run again.  I still had a sliver of hope for sub 4, since I knew that 18-21 were net downhill going into the flatter section of the course.  As I reached those downhills though, my legs were definitely feeling the burn.  I can\u2019t really remember what I was thinking but, in mile 20, I was hit by another calf cramp, and my goal changed to just surviving.  \n\n*A Wall?*: Around mile 22, a friend of mine who lived nearby was cheering me on.  I smiled for the camera and said \u201ceverything hurts\u201d.  I discovered a new problem I had never experienced: my arms were starting to really hurt.  I could barely lift them without a sharp pain in my biceps and shoulders.  Finally, after struggling for a bit, I started walking.  From 23-25, I was like a nomad going from aid station to aid station.  I would down as many drinks as I could, then shuffle along hoping the next mile wouldn\u2019t take too long.  I still attempted to jog but my upper body was wracked with pain.  People were passing me left and right, and one woman ran onto the course to try to get me to touch her \u201ctap here to power up\u201d sign.  I was reserving all the willpower I had to lift my arms to grab cups of nuun\/water, so I said, \u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d and walked past her.  On a positive note, I walked by a local run club that I had joined a few times early in training, and it was great to see them.\n\n*The Finish*: Near the end of mile 25, another friend of mine was there.  I\u2019ve known him for a long time, but we drifted out of touch for a while until very recently.  It turned out that, during the pandemic, he had gotten really into running and had even run a few marathons already, so it was really cool to connect over that.  He jogged alongside me for a bit and, finally, I was able to start jogging again (*I know I already let you know but, if you\u2019re on reddit and reading this, once again this was so helpful*).  At least, I was able to mostly adopt the idea that while it hurt to jog, it hurt to walk too, so I might as well jog.  My arms hung stiff and useless at my sides, but my legs actually felt okay at this point, which was more frustrating than anything.  I jogged all the way up the hill everyone talks about in race reports for Austin, and finally coasted across the finish line.\n\n### Post-Race\nI didn\u2019t feel great crossing the finish line\u2014relieved, but also disappointed, and still in a lot of pain.  I grabbed my medal\/shirt\/water and (after getting stuck sitting on the ground for a few minutes) some snacks and made my way over to a chair.  By this point I had started getting questions\/congratulations from various friends, which boosted my spirits.  Also realizing that hey, I had completed my first marathon.  I even broke my calorie pr (6028!) thanks to some nachos and cookies I ate later that day.\n\n### Conclusion\/The Future\n\nI guess to wrap up this whole review\/report\/thing, I really need to answer: did Hansons First Marathon deliver on its promise to prepare me for the marathon?  On one hand, I\u2019ve already said that I personally would recommend a bit more time if you have close to no running background.  I also feel like I blew up spectacularly at the event itself.  In retrospect, miles 3-7 were a bit hot, and I could have changed my time goal much earlier, like around mile 8, or at the half.  Maybe I could have tried to get more out of the aid stations, like the early ones that I ignored because of the crowds, or I could have worked with the people running around me deeper into the race.  Maybe I could have prevented my arms from getting so messed up if I had better form or focused on staying relaxed early.\n\nBut these feel like lessons I couldn\u2019t have learned without actually experiencing my first marathon. Even though the race didn\u2019t go well, I\u2019m pretty happy with how I did for the first 22 miles, and I don't even think my legs were the limiting factor for the last 4.2 either.   I\u2019m happy at how I was able to follow my plan, control my pacing, fuel well, and keep my head in the game as long as I did\u2014in other words, I really feel like I didn\u2019t just survive, but actually raced a marathon.  I had an aggressive goal on a difficult course with not ideal conditions and if any one of those things was different the race and this report could have been a lot different.  All in all, I can heartily recommend Hansons First Marathon.\n\nAs for the future, I think my biggest weakness running-wise is that I just don\u2019t have enough consistent time running.  I have no sources for this but I suspect that, for example, 12 months of around 30 miles per week improves fitness much more than 6 months around 45, especially for a beginner like me.  So, keeping up the hobby is the first step (well, once I can walk normally again).  I\u2019ve had this race looming over me the whole time I\u2019ve been running, so I\u2019m looking forward to running just for the pleasure of it: getting in more trail running, doing more group runs, checking out new routes, etc.  It will also be nice to have more time for non-running stuff.  Race wise, I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ll aim for a half marathon as my next serious race\u2014the two I did for the distance challenge I treated more like workouts (with warm ups and cool downs), so I want to give the distance a proper go.  But then\u2026revenge.\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http:\/\/sfdavis.com\/racereports\/) created by \/u\/herumph.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1677010751.0},{"title":"Suggestions for how to stay warm in a start corral when throwaway clothing\/beverages are not allowed?","author":"mrbitterpants","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/118cejr\/suggestions_for_how_to_stay_warm_in_a_start\/","text":"Edit Feb 24: organizers have indicated they will now have clothing donation bins at the start!\n\n\nSo Tokyo marathon is coming up and Japan is still in heightened covid measures so there\u2019s some extra strict rules in place for the race. \n\n-\tno throwaway clothing\n-\tliquids must be commercially sealed and less than 250ml\n-\ttake your trash with you\n\nHistorically been in the single digits Celsius at the start and the corrals close 30 mins before gun time. \n\nI usually wear a fleece top and just dump it at the start but that\u2019s out.

More vegtables and fruit, less Chick-fil-a\n\nFirst marathon was Austin 2022 which I did in 3:59\nSecond Marathon was Houston, 5 weeks ago which I did in 3:55\n\n### Training\nI use and love Nike Run Club app and used their 20 week training plan leading up to the Houston Marathon which was 5 weeks ago\n\nThen I did a very easy version of the last five weeks of it again although did skip a run or two a week to help in recovery. Longest run in this period was an easy 18miler. I think the lack of running really helped me. I have been suffering with some plantar fasciitis in one foot but lots of calf raises, stretching seemed to have tamed it down\n\n### Pre-race\nPre race dinner the night efore was white rice with eggs, had a pretty bad nights sleep, got up at 4:30, coffee, bagel with nutella, oat bar, then drove an hour to near the start line. One thing I love about Austin marathon is the easier free downtown parking on a Sunday morning. Also, compared to Houston marathon, there's no corrals, you can easily walk up to your pacing group without much effort, nobody herding you like cattle.\n\n\n### Race\nAustin starts with a gentle 3 mile uphill and the race adrenaline and crowd make those 3 pretty easy and then you get 3 really nice downhill miles, all the way to 6 I was feeling great. \n\nRace nutrician was 4 packs of Jelly Belly running beans (100cals each with caffeine, some without) over the course of the race. The thing I like about them is you can eat them gradually over the course of several miles, plus they taste great\n\nComing up to 12 miles, really makes me want to do a fast half marathon as I was still feeling really good at this stage. If I can do a full in 3:46, how fast could I do a half? \n\n14-20miles start to let some fatigue into the legs but overall still maintaining around 8:34\/mile average. I had tried to stay with 3:45 pacers but lost them after a quick bathroom break. There were a few runners who were doing the same pace as me and we did some kind of running together, using others to pace for a while, not actively talking and agreeing but everyone around me just pushing steadily not to drop back. Very few people passed me throughout the race.\n\nAround 23 miles I was starting to feel it in my feet and calves but wasn't until the killer hill with half a mile to go that I actually walked for about a minute, just so I'd have enough to cross the finish line strong\n\n### Post-race\nLots of water and a couple of gatorades, followed by an hour drive home, PT Terrys burger and milkshake for a lunch and then back to looking after the kids and trying not to move the rest of the day.\n\nI think I'll do this one again next year, would love to do an ambitious target of sub 3:30, anybody who is approaching 50 who has shaved 30 minutes off their marathon PB?","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1677019530.0},{"title":"Achievements for Wednesday, February 22, 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/118pgw3\/achievements_for_wednesday_february_22_2023\/","text":"Hey runners, it's another day and it is time to post your accomplishments you'd like to share - big or small.\n\nNote: No need to preface YOUR accomplishments with something like, \"this may not be an accomplishment to most of you...\".

A really well organised race and a lovely day out (mostly!).\n\n### Race Information\n* **Name:** Brecon to Cardiff 70km\n* **Date:** 19\/02\/2023\n* **Distance:** 70km (43 miles)\n* **Location:** South Wales, UK\n* **Website:** https:\/\/www.runwalkcrawl.co.uk\/\n* **Strava:** https:\/\/www.strava.com\/activities\/8589051482\n* **Time:** 09:48:30\n\n### Goals\n| Goal | Description | Completed? |\n|------|-------------|------------|\n| A | Finish | *Yes* |\n| B | Finish under 10 hours | *Yes* |\n\n### Training\nSo from a recommendation in the comments (thanks \/u\/Gorrable) to my last race report, I signed up for this race in August.\n\nMy Training was not as consistent as I would have liked. This came down both to my own discipline as well as several other factors.\n\nMy girlfriend and I bought a house and moved in early October, this then immediately led to a very busy period at work, which included a lot of traveling. I then struggled with pains in my foot during early December which required some extra rest.\n\nI managed to get a lot of good training runs in during January, and I even managed my first 100 km week! All in all it was not the best training cycle, but I managed to stay free of any major injuries or running out of motivation, so I guess that is a plus.\n\n### Pre-race\nMy girlfriend and I went to Cardiff on Friday night. On Saturday we went for a walk around the city had some nice brunch and did some shopping.\n\nThen on Saturday afternoon it was off for registration and kit-check and the event base. Compared to my last race the fact that I could do the registration the day before the race was a massive stress-relief that made me much less nervous.\n\nI had a surprisingly good nights sleep after packing up my racepack and my \"drop-bag\". When I woke up, I had a cup of coffee, a bagel and a banana, and then off we went to the finish line to catch the bus to the start.\n\nI had another 30 minute nap on the bus and arrived early to the start-line. It was a little chilly standing around, and I realised I was hungry. I ate one of my flapjack bites and then soon enough it was 8 am and we were off!\n\n### Race\nSo yeah just to get it out of the way, yes I went out too fast. I got to the first checkpoint (7 miles) after about 1h10m as this was all flat along the canal. It quickly warmed up and I stopped briefly to take off my jacket.\n\nLeaving the first checkpoint we were immediately climbing. The first part was quite steep, but the remainder of the climb was relatively gentle and runnable for most parts. I was still going way too fast (about 7 min\/km) but the climb had some absolutely stunning views and the weather was amazing. Super sunny and a nice 10-12C.\n\nDuring this leg I was starting to feel the beginnings of a blister on my right foot. I stopped and adjusted my shoelaces to do up my shoe tighter. However I would find out much later that the damage had already been done.\n\nAfter the second checkpoint at 16 miles I had to stop for a toilet break and we were then running down hill towards the \"halfway\" checkpoint 3 at about 25 miles. Lots of the trail towards CP3 was paved and it felt really hard on my knees doing this in my trail shoes.\n\nAt CP3 I was met by my girlfriend, changed in to my road shoes, ate a sausage roll, restocked on Tailwind and other snacks and then went off.\n\nAfter leaving the checkpoint my mood immediately took a turn for the worse. My legs were sore and I was not really sure how I was supposed to do another 30 km and certainly had no belief that I would be finishing under 10 hours. I had a chat with another runner who wasn't feeling great either and my forced optimism of his prospects sort of worked on myself as well.\n\nA few kilometres after passing CP 4 (30 miles) I managed to get in to a good rhythm and started to recover my mood and belief that I could finish under my time goal.\n\nI arrived at CP 5 (37 miles) feeling generally ok, although my legs were still sore. I managed to have a bit of fruit and then headed out for the last 10 km. I managed to basically run the remainder with only very few walking breaks. I overtook about four people in the last kilometer and I was so happy when I went over the finish line.\n\n### Post-race\nAfter finishing I ate some cake and drank some coke. I felt really happy, and I was kind of surprised how well I was going when I came over the finish line, thinking about how bad I had felt earlier in the race.\n\n\nIt turns out the blister on my foot, which hadn't really bothered me since I adjusted my shoes, had become really bad. My knees and hips were sore, but after having my dinner and a few beers I didn't feel too bad!\n\nMaybe there will be a little pause in the Ultra runs, as the training time required is taking away a lot of time from working on my new house, but I am hoping to do another trail race this summer.\n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http:\/\/sfdavis.com\/racereports\/) created by \/u\/herumph.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1676989092.0},{"title":"What Are You Wearing Wednesday - Weekly Gear Thread","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/118pgvo\/what_are_you_wearing_wednesday_weekly_gear_thread\/","text":"It's that time of week already...the gear thread!

I usually use their half-marathon plans for a 2:10 pace. I typically run 25 to 30 miles per week, but I am not at all a fast runner, just a slow, steady, and dedicated one. \n\nWhen I turned 39, I decided I wanted to run my first full marathon before 40, so last fall, I chose Runkeeper's marathon plan with a 4:50 finish goal. \n\nFor me, the training plan built into the app kept me very consistent. All fall and winter, I stuck to the plan, only missing one 12-mile run between my 15 and 16-milers because I was traveling for work and couldn't bring myself to run on the hotel treadmill for so long! \n\nThe farthest I had ever run before marathon training was around 15 miles and crossing that threshold was a big mental barrier\u2014but I did it and felt really great! My longest run during the plan was a 20-mile run. The day I ran it, it rained on me, and I had to have my husband bring me an extra pair of shoes and socks midway through so I wouldn't wreck my feet with blisters three weeks before race day. Thankfully the rain let up and I finished the run strong near my desired race pace (11:20).\n\nBut overall, I felt really excellent about my training. I stuck to the plan, though my pace was often much slower than my desired race pace average. On my long runs, I would often start too fast and then run out of juice near the end. But I have run a few half marathons and knew that race day energy would be a huge boost, so I was hoping that help get me to my race goal of sub-5 hours.\n\nA big revelation during training was the importance of fueling. I don't remember where I read it, but I saw somewhere online that the Science in Sport Beta Fuel gel didn't upset stomachs, so I trained with that starting during my 14-mile runs and above. I also experimented with a handheld water bottle (during my 19-mile run, kind of a weird time to introduce a new thing into the mix!) and realized I didn't want to run with that for the full marathon. \n\nI also finally bought a SPIbelt and what a game-changer! I had previously held my phone while running for all these years, and now I'll never go back to no belt.\n\n### Pre-race\nIn the week leading up to the race, I followed the Runkeeper plan's taper. I ran 8 miles on Sunday and then a few short 3 and 2 miles distances during the week. I tried to eat more protein and eat overnight oats for breakfast every day during the week. My pre-race meal was some homemade pizza on our Ooni pizza oven (highly recommend! we got it as our big holiday gift and it's been amazing). Also during the week, I increased my intake of water and drank coconut waters a couple of nights.\n\nOn race morning, I woke up at 5:15, drank some coffee and ate a slice of banana bread, but no BM, which had me a little nervous, though that's been typical for me before my long runs, so I didn't worry too much about that. \n\nThe temperature started around 48F or 50F, which gave me some confidence. I tend to run much slower if it's too warm.\n\n### Race\nMy plan was to run with the 4:50 pacer group. I started around them, but with all the race day energy, I got ahead of them. I told myself if I saw the 4:35 pacer, I was going too fast and to let up. \n\nMile 1-9 were so easy and fun. I felt right in my groove and kept checking my watch to be sure I was averaging no faster than 10:35. (Got a little cocky at mile 5 and had to slow down, ha.) I knew my legs felt fresh now, but I needed that energy throughout. I ate a gel around mile 7. Up through this point, I was alternating between water and Nuun, marathon's energy drink, at every other water station. \n\nMile 10-12. This is where I started feeling it just a little. Mostly because the race planners in Austin have mile 12 go up a huge hill! I had run the half marathon a couple of times and knew about this infamous hill, so I anticipated it, but it's still really rough. I let myself walk probably the last 30 or so yards up it. I didn't want to get my heart rate too high and had already told myself there was no shame in walking if I felt I needed to. This is also where I started drinking water at nearly every race station, and Nuun at every other one.\n\nMile 13. This one was really hard and it's reflected in my time. This is about when the half marathoners split away and the ranks really thin out. I didn't realize how much I was drafting off of the energy of the other runners and I felt a little lonely out there. \n\nMile 14-21. I honestly felt so good during this time. My parents and my husband all posted up at mile 16 to see me, and I felt a huge surge after I saw them cheering for me. Another friend group was cheering me on at mile 17 and I even had the energy to give them a big hug. And then a final group of friends met me at mile 21. I cannot say enough how lucky I was to have so many people come and support me and it made a HUGE difference. I also ate another energy gel around mile 14. \n\nMile 22-25. Oh my gosh, the wall! It's real! Between the extreme fatigue in my quads\u2014which was totally unexpected! if I ache anywhere, it's usually the hips\u2014and the warming weather and surprising humidity, this was the hardest part. I won't lie, I got a little emotional around mile 23 and walked a few places. At this point, I was drinking a cup of Nuun and water at every water station and letting myself walk as I did it, but I surprised myself that I was able to keep shuffling along, mostly running. Again, the Austin Marathon designers really like those hills, and there was a final hill right in the last mile that I walked part of, but my parents were at the top of the hill cheering me on, which helped get me back in running mode. \n\nFinish. Once I saw the finishing chute, I had a surge of energy and was able to close it out strong. I was so happy that it looked like a I was sub-5, and when I checked the unofficial results, it looked like I had meet my goal with time to spare. \n\n### Post-race\nMy husband met me at the finishing line, and I hugged him and cried. I am not a crier usually, but I think being so tired and so happy just brought the tears out. I felt like a too-tired toddler who cries from exhaustion. \n\nWhen I got home, I stretched, did some foam-rolling, and took an epsom salt bath. I cleaned up, went and got some celebratory lunch, and then took a short nap. I felt a little sniffly and had a headache, which I attribute to my body just feeling really spent, but I also took some allergy medicine, which cleared it up. \n\nThe day after, my quads are definitely sore, but I don't feel as bad as I feared. The night of the race, I said, I'll never do this again. The day after has me thinking, hm, never say never.  \n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http:\/\/sfdavis.com\/racereports\/) created by \/u\/herumph.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1676950563.0},{"title":"Austin Marathon Story","author":"ttteeerrr1122","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/117opi0\/austin_marathon_story\/","text":"Austin Marathon Story:\n\nI stayed at a place close to the start line so I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about logistics.

NY is all locked down and massive waves. This was more like a local 5k race. Everyone organized themselves. \n\nRace starts with a gong and not a gun. When the gong went off. I went off. WAY.TOO.FAST.  My plan was 9:20\u2019s\/9:30\u2019s for the first three miles up hill, instead I did 8:15\u2019s. Plan was to do 8:30\u2019s on the second 3 miles (downhill) instead I did 7:50\u2019s!!  \n\nWas feeling great at mile 7 when I saw my daughters.

You don\u2019t train for it. You try to put yourself in pain with sprints and hill repeats but nothing prepares you for this level of pain. \n\nMy mind kept sayin WALK DAMMIT. I saw all these people start walking. People on the side trying to stretch out cramping muscles. One guy about to puke. And I told myself. Why walk?  I have none of these problems. Just pain. \n\nI kept that mantra from 22-24. At 24 I was DONE. All my brain did on repeat was say \u201cwhen is the turn? When is the turn?\u201d  I knew there were 4 turns in the last 2 miles. Can I just make it to the turn. \n\nAt the turn my body said \u201cit\u2019s ok to walk a bit\u201d. And I got so close to listening. But I thought \u201cNO! That will not be the story of this race how I walked. I\u2019ve worked too hard on my running and on myself. F**k no. I will keep running\u201d. I kept running.  \n\nMile 25 to 26 is the steepest hill in the race. And I somehow kept running.  VERY slowly. People were saying \u201cyou look great\u201d but I could hear the tone. They were lying to me. \n\nJust after the top of the hill I saw my parents. My mom recognized me, which isn\u2019t always the case. My dad looked worried and said something encouraging. He told me later I looked \u201creally bad\u201d. \n\nI passed them and knew the race was almost over. But it seemed to be going forever. \n\nI even said out loud \u201cwhen the f**k does this end?\u201d  \n\nThen I saw the last turn. And the crowd was there. My daughters somewhere in that crowd. I said to myself \u201cTHIS is the story of this race\u201d. \n\nAnd I sprinted. Not \u201cas fast as I can on tired legs\u201d I pushed the pain out of my mind and closed the last 200 yards as fast as I can run. \n\nI threw horns up because I could hear my girls screaming even if I couldn\u2019t see them and closed in a dead sprint. \n\nI tried to yell after the finish but just let out a croak. \n\nMultiple medical people came up to me to see if I needed medical assistance. I assured them I was NOT ok, but didn\u2019t need a doctor. \n\nMy girls found me sitting cross legged in the street confused and crying. They gave me water and a giant cookie and lots of love. \n\nI can\u2019t do justice to the pain of the last 4-5 miles or to the joy after the finish. \n\nMy goal was under 4 hours and to sprint the finish. 1 out of 2 ain\u2019t bad.

I had been consistently running for around a year before starting training, but still started with his base training program. I was living in Houston at the time, working a kind of busy job, so just needed structure. I used the novice of his base building plans. I then used his Novice 2 Half plan to get more mileage on my legs. Then I took a week off before jumping into his Novice Full plan. I trained a long time for this one!\n\nTraining didn't exactly go to plan, but now that I have typed it out, I see why I still did OK. While going through my full plan, I got a nasty cold that had me skip a week and a half of training, including a 16-miler. I did not cross-train because I was dealing with some severe fatigue and shortness of breath. Additionally, about a week before race day I got some sort of calf injury. I am not sure what it was, but it scared me and I could barely walk. I took it very easy that last week, skipping my last long run and a few of my mid-week runs. I just wanted to make it to the start. That said, I think my months of consistency paid off and overall I was in OK fitness to run. \n\nThe other part of my training was a lot of races. I participated in the Austin Runner's Club Distance Challenge, which has a 5k, 10k, 10miler, and two halves leading up to the full. This was really fun because it kept me focused and motivated while also practicing my race day strategy over and over. It gave me an overall idea of my pace on race day, but I ended a full 20 minutes later than the prediction calculators said I would. I think this is because I was overtrained for halves, but undertrained for fulls. So if I had been \"as trained\" for the full, I would have hit the 5:30 prediction.\n\n### Pre-race\nWow this race freaked me out. I was sure I would die in the days leading up! I posted here asking for help in pre-race prep because I was facing a beast I hadn't faced in any races so far (the heat). I spent a few days making sure I got lots of water and electrolytes, which helped a lot (thank you y'all for your recommendations!) \n\nMy diet is already pretty carb heavy, so I didn't really carb load. I did have a burger and fries the night before, as I always do. I also had a coffee and wheatbix in the morning (nothing better than a 4AM coffee??). Bathroom breaks all went to plan. Except the marathon organizers didn't have hand sanitizers at the potties :( Thankfully I had an emergency stash for some reason?\n\n### Race\nHardest part of this race until mile 22 was staying slow. I know how to pace a half now, but I just didn't know how to pace a full and wanted to stay slow so I wouldn't burn myself out. I also ran this half last year and somehow forgot all the hills? Anyway - it's a great course and the back half is a lot flatter. As you can guess with my time, there was some walking. I planned to walk up the hills and run the downs\/flats, with longer and less steep hills being ran 30on\/30off. I stuck to that plan and it went well. I also planned to drink electrolites at every station which really helped me. I had never done that at a race before, but I will from now on. Usually after a race, it feels like my brain is static - not this one, surprisingly! My final hydration plan was to run with my hydration pack so I could sip (I get sick when I chug at stations). That served me well I think and I drank around 2 liters of water. \n\nMy fuel plan was to eat a gu gel every 45 minutes and have a mandarin at mile 6, and then every few miles thereafter. I carried the gels and my dad met me when he could along the route with the mandarins. There's no real rhyme or reason to the mandarins, I just think they taste so good when you're running and I'm sure they provide something?? Eventually, as in training, the gels were hard to get down. But sometimes you have to do unpleasant things. So anyway, mile 1-20 are kind of a blur. I remember feeling my runners high around mile 6 and then not coming down until mile 16. My legs went numb somewhere around the midpoint. I could unfortunately feel my blisters around mile 4. That's all I have for 1-20. \n\nFrom 20 on, I walked a lot more but managed to run a decent amount. I never hit a wall, which I think is due to making sure I was very fueled. I did hit a \"it feels good to just walk\" wall. I knew the course time limit was 7 hours and I was running around 6, so I didn't stress about it. I just let myself walk when I wanted and ran every now and then. It was probably about 4:1 running:walking. Somewhere around mile 24 I passed my parents who informed me they had picked up my post-race Vegan Nom, which helped motivate me. Except I told them I couldn't stop for a mandarin or water, I just had to keep going. And I did! There is a big hill around mile 26 that I took a brisk stroll up, and then a SPRINT to the end! \n\n### Post-race\nAs soon as I hit that finish line and started slowly walking, my legs decided they didn't know how to work. In fact, I think I have forgotten how to walk still. But I got my race medal, finishers shirt, and snack. Managed to remember to stop my Garmin and to stretch. \n\nOverall, this race went better than I thought. I was happy not to hit a wall and not have to dig deep. I just kept going. I think the training plan got me over the finish line easily, but I would pick one with more speedwork for my next marathon. I need to get below a 4:50 to beat my families marathon record, so that is my next goal. \n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http:\/\/sfdavis.com\/racereports\/) created by \/u\/herumph.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1676902737.0},{"title":"Fort Lauderdale Marathon report from a first timer who just started running 16 months ago at age 41","author":"Kabong","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/117qtb3\/fort_lauderdale_marathon_report_from_a_first\/","text":"### Race Information\n* **Name:** Publix Fort Lauderdale A1A Marathon\n* **Date:** February 19, 2023\n* **Distance:** 26.2 miles\n* **Location:** Fort Lauderdale, FL\n* **Website:** https:\/\/a1amarathon.com\/\n* **Strava:** https:\/\/www.strava.com\/activities\/8588484245\n* **Time:** 5:10:41\n\n### Goals\n| Goal | Description | Completed? |\n|------|-------------|------------|\n| A | Finish | *Yes* |\n| B | Sub 5 | *No* |\n| C | Sub 4:30 | *No* |\n\n### Splits\n| Mile | Time |\n|------|------|\n| 1 | 10:50\n| 2 | 10:36\n| 3 | 10:39\n| 4 | 10:33\n| 5 | 10:32\n| 6 | 10:45\n| 7 | 10:36\n| 8 | 10:45\n| 9 | 10:34\n| 10 | 10:27\n| 11 | 10:27\n| 12 | 10:29\n| 13 | 10:23\n| 14 | 10:39\n| 15 | 10:41\n| 16 | 11:10\n| 17 | 12:39\n| 18 | 11:04\n| 19 | 13:45\n| 20 | 16:27\n| 21 | 14:16\n| 22 | 14:30\n| 23 | 12:54\n| 24 | 13:57\n| 25 | 14:15\n| 26 | 11:48\n| 27 | 10:51\n\n### Training\nI started running October 4, 2021 at age 41, about 6 months after I was diagnosed with type-2 diabetes and decided to hit my mid life crisis in stride. I did a bunch of research to understand how I got to that point in life, [decided what I was going to do about it](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/diabetes\/comments\/piqsl9\/hello\\_rdiabetes\\_i\\_am\\_a\\_40\\_year\\_old\\_male\\_who\\_was\/) and then started executing against the plan. Fast forward to 100 pounds of weight loss, [completion of couch to 5k](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/C25K\/comments\/res5hr\/started_november_7th_of_this_year_graduated\/) and a few half marathons, I decided to start training for a full marathon in the fall of 2022 with the help of a running coach. \n\nTraining consisted of running 5x weekly with 1x cross training (road bike) and 1 day of rest. A week of training typically broke down to 3 easy runs which I would do as zone 2 fasted cardio, one workout which rotated (mile repeats\/tempo runs\/intervals\/fartlek) and one long run. Running schedule was uploaded to TrainingPeaks weekly, the run scheduled for the day would sync over to my watch and I'd follow whatever the plan was for that day. \n\nFor nutrition, my general guidelines were to target 200g protein, <120g carbs per day with no set goal for fat. On workout days or days with long runs the carb limit didn't start until I got back from the run, so I could fuel beforehand and use gels as needed. In the months leading up to the race, I also started experimenting with caffeine on workout run or long run days. I started with coffee + 32mg gels and eventually landed on 300mg pre workout +  2x100mg Clif double espresso gels + no-caffeine gels for long (~3 hour) runs.\n\nMy average weekly running distance from the end of August 2022 until today was 29.1 miles, but my my weekly mileage in the weeks leading up to the race built up to 47.7 miles. The only time I missed any training runs was when I got quite sick on a business trip and was not able to train for about a week in early December as a result. \n\nAt the end of training I went into the race with a goal of running the first 10 miles at 10:40 per mile, the second 10 miles at 10:20 per mile if the first 10 felt well, and then running by feel for the remainder. Pace aside, my strategy\/hope was to run the first half of the race in zone 2 and then pick it up for the second half as I had done two of my longer training runs with similar paces\/times. \n\nMy Garmin app said my predicted best effort for a marathon was 4 hours and change and I'd run a 1 hour 59 minute half marathon in December when the weather got into the 40s. I knew 4 hours wasn't going to happen, but I was hoping to put in a sub-4:30 effort. A few days out I realized that may not happen as race day approached and the forecast called for upwards of 80 degrees with high humidity, no cloud cover and no appreciable wind.\n\n### Pre-race\nI didn't want to be stressed out about travel logistics getting to the race, especially since the event organizers warned about traffic and parking issues morning of, so I stayed at a hotel which was walking distance from the race start. This was a huge stress saver that afforded a few extra hours of sleep on race day and I would definitely do again. Grabbed dinner the night before nearby and tried to get to sleep at 9pm, but didn't actually fall asleep till 11pm due to pre-race nervous energy. Woke up at 3:45am, 15 minutes before my alarm. At 4am I ate baked oatmeal squares (~1 cup oatmeal) that my wife made. At 4:30 I started drinking pre workout with 300mg caffeine. \n\n### Race\nWoke up to clear, 73 degree Fahrenheit calm skies which sounds great except when you're in South Florida and were hoping for cloud cover and some form of breeze of the ocean. Walked to the start line from the hotel and hung out in the corral area for ~40 minutes until the race started. I got underway at 6:09am and the first 16 miles went pretty much according to plan based on target pace. \n\nMile 17 included a brief pit stop to use a roadside port-o-potty, then got back on pace for mile 18. Halfway into mile 19 I noticed my heart rate was climbing faster than I was hoping for. By this time the temperature had climbed to 80 degrees and I made a call to walk for a bit to try and bring my heart rate down and cool off a bit. At the next two hydration stations volunteers were pouring water jugs of water onto runners heads which helped a pretty decent amount. I managed some form of unstructured run\/walk intervals over the last 10k of the race. Somewhere around mile 23 or 24 I saw someone using a shower at the beach exit and quickly ran up the sidewalk to follow suit as soon as they were finished. The beachside shower was repeated again a mile or so later and felt pretty refreshing in the moment. Once I hit mile 25 I managed to run the rest of the way minus a stop at the last hydration station to pour more water on my head. I definitely had gas in the tank at the end of the race, but I am also pretty sure I would have put myself in the hurt locker if I hadn't stopped to cool down in the last 10k. \n\n### Post-race\nI grabbed the finisher medal, poured a few bottles of ice water over my head and sat down on the sea wall to catch my breath. Everything felt pretty decent post race apart from wanting relief from the heat. Grabbed a quick shower at the hotel pool, then hopped on the train home. \n\n1 day out from the race, there's some mild pain\/tightness behind my left knee and managed to get a blister on my left foot, but feeling pretty good otherwise. Definitely planning to make another marathon attempt at some point, but it 100% certainly will not be in the South Florida heat.\n\nRace details aside, I wanted to say thank you to this subreddit community as I spent many fascinated hours reading a variety of posts and especially race reports as I started running, especially in the early C25K days when I got hooked on running 5K races, wondering what it would be like to run a marathon. \n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http:\/\/sfdavis.com\/racereports\/) created by \/u\/herumph.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1676943175.0},{"title":"Achievements for Tuesday, February 21, 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/117v04q\/achievements_for_tuesday_february_21_2023\/","text":"Hey runners, it's another day and it is time to post your accomplishments you'd like to share - big or small.\n\nNote: No need to preface YOUR accomplishments with something like, \"this may not be an accomplishment to most of you...\".

This was my 2nd half marathon and I was hoping to do better than my first. My first half marathon last year, I was not able to run the whole time, ran about 8-9 miles, and walked\/ran the rest.\n\nMy training started around the end of November, but I had been lifting weights before then and trying to lose weight. Before I started training I had lost close to 10lbs so was feeling pretty confident in the goals I had set for the half.\n\nI was pretty consistent... I was running about 4 times a week up until the holidays. After that, my running dropped to 2-3 times a week. I would always get my long run and try to keep my other runs at least 4 miles or so. I had been doing that pretty consistently up until about a month ago. At the beginning of February, Austin got hit with a really bad storm. I lost power for 5 (6?) days and I'll say that just life happened and I didn't run at all for 2 weeks.\n\nI started running again about a week and half before race day. I knew at this point it was too close to try to push myself too hard, so I ran about 3 times a week and went to the gym to weight lift. I will say, during this time my diet was great. I was eating lots of protein (100g minimum a day), measuring my food, and trying to get back on track.\n\n3 days before the race was my last run and in the last few days I only went on long walks (2.5 miles) and did yoga daily. \n\nAt this point, I was feeling really nervous. My shin splints had started acting up the last week, and would get flare ups just from my walks. The pain was around a 3, not bad at all, but it worried me for the actual run since I had lost so much training.\n\n### Pre-race\nI woke up at 5am, 2 hours before the race, had a light breakfast of eggs, bread and Canadian bacon, had water and coffee, and tried to go to the bathroom multiple times (with no luck, only was able to pee) before we left at 6am.\n\nI wore running\/yoga pants, had leg compression sleeves on, a shirt, light jacket and beanie. The temperature was around 40F with light wind.\n\nTraffic was decently bad and we were running a bit late. Parked about a mile away and walked and I was able to get to the race about 5 minutes before start.\n\n### Race\nOverall, this wasn't a bad run for me. My shin splint pain went away almost immediately at the start of the run which I have had happen before.\n\nMile 1-2 was a little hard. Started super slow intentionally and was trying to get in the groove but was able to run off the adrenaline from the crowd, keeping slow pace. I had GU energy gummies that I opened and started to eat near the end of mile 2. This part of the race is uphill.\n\nMile 3-5 were fine. At this point I started to get super hot and realized I wore too much so I took off my jacket and beanie. Dropped my beanie and phone and had to pick it up. We started to go downhill for a while so that was great. My knees started hurting around mile 4 which is normal for me.\n\nMile 6-7 was good. Half way point was exciting, got to see the crowd again. The run here was pretty flat. I also was getting thirsty so I got water from the water station and pretty much just threw it on myself lol.\n\nMile 8-10 is where I started struggling. At this point, the music I'm listening to isn't doing much for me. I finished the gummies around this time and had no more distractions. And eventually we started running up hill again. Stopped to enjoy my water at one of the water stations for a total of 2 seconds this time.\n\nMile 11 wasn't bad... I was fighting it mentally.\n\nMile 12. Horrible. Worst hill in the race. It took everything in me to not stop and walk at this point. It's a solid 30 seconds to a minute of pure uphill. Horrible. Even after we got past the hill, it was hitting me pretty hard to recover from it.\n\nMile 13 The end... Realized a few minutes before I wasn't going to break 2:30 but was just glad to be over.\n\n\n### Post-race\nMy body is not nearly as sore or hurting as much from my first half marathon so I am glad. I am having some tummy troubles and walking up stairs hurts from knee pain... But I am happy to be home. Already took a decent nap and will enjoy the rest of my Sunday watching the Last of Us and doing some light yoga later.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1676844215.0},{"title":"Mitja Marat\u00f3 de Barcelona - Novice Runner Race Report","author":"doxxed-chris","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/1173j0u\/mitja_marat\u00f3_de_barcelona_novice_runner_race\/","text":"# Race Information\n\n* **Name:** Barcelona Half Marathon\n* **Date:** February 19th, 2023\n* **Distance:** 21.1k\n* **Location:** Barcelona, Spain\n* **Website:** [https:\/\/edreamsmitjabarcelona.com\/en\/](https:\/\/edreamsmitjabarcelona.com\/en\/)\n* **Time:** 1:53:00\n\n# Goals\n\n|Goal|Completed|\n|:-|:-|\n|Learn how an organised race works|Yes|\n|Avoid injury|Yes|\n|Run sub 2hr|Yes|\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Times\n\n|Distance|Time|Pace|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|5k|00:27:35|5m 31s\/km|\n|10k|00:53:53|5m 15s\/km|\n|15k|01:21:08|5m 27s\/km|\n|20k|01:47:21|5m 14s\/km|\n|Finish|01:53:00|5m 27s\/km|\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Training\n\n32M, 182cm, 70kg\n\nAbout 4 years ago, I was diagnosed with arthritis in my right knee. I am in constant pain, but over time I've realised that my joints remain capable of physical exercise (and even respond well to it). My hard-won pain management techniques are also an advantage when it comes to pushing my limits.\n\nI did very limited cardio after my diagnosis, averaging around 5000 steps a day until, in August 2022, I made it my goal to walk across Spain coast-to-coast through the mountains the following summer. Most weekends since then I've completed a hike in the mountains of at least 15km\/1000m ascent, gradually increasing the difficulty of the terrain and weight carried. A hiking partner of mine suggested we attempt the Army Ranger's ruck march as a challenge (12 miles with 40lbs in under 3 hours), and we were surprised to succeed on our first attempt. This gave me the confidence to try harder challenges, culminating in an 62km hike over 11hrs. In this long hike, I covered the marathon distance in just under 8 hours.\n\nAfter this, I undertook a series of test runs to see whether I might be able to run a marathon. The knee seemed okay and I signed up to the Barcelona half marathon and marathon events with 9 weeks available to train.\n\nI was able to complete the following runs:\n\n|M|T|W|T|F|S|S|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|15.3||4.3||9|||\n|18.3||4.9||12.9|||\n|21.1||5.1|10.9|||16.3|\n|||5.3|11.7||||\n||24.2|||||8|\n||8.5|12.5|||19.7||\n||6.1|||31|||\n|8.2||8|||||\n||12.2|10.5||||21.1 (HM)|\n\nMy training was very naive at first, basically I just went out and ran at the fastest pace I could sustain and tried to get my running volume up as much as possible in the first few weeks. My 3rd week of training had the most running volume, with 53.4km. I was able to use mental strength to complete these runs but the strain on my body was considerable. As I did more research, I learned that it's generally recommended to run slow at a lower heart rate during training. \n\nThe 24.2k run was my last \"fast\" training run; after that, I focused on staying in zone 3 rather than maintaining a particular pace. This forced me to run extremely slowly (7+ min\/km) which was very difficult for my ego, felt unnatural, and took all the fun out of training. Nevertheless, I persisted and was able to run 31k in Z3 in 3hrs 50m.\n\n10 days before the half marathon race, I had a serious arthritis flare up which left me barely able to walk. I took all sugar and processed foods out of my diet and rested as much as I could. My last two training runs were on a treadmill so that I could stop immediately if I needed to.\n\n# Pre-race\n\nI was too excited to go to bed early, and I woke up at 6:30 after a short night of sleep. Normally my knee is very stiff and painful in the first hours of the day, but it felt great as I hopped out of bed - which I took as a good omen. I drank a coffee and ate some weetabix with soy milk, then watched The Office \"Fun Run part 2\" for motivation. At 7:30, I left my home and walked 30 minutes to the starting line. There was a great feeling of building suspense as gradually more and more runners appeared around me, all of us strangers drawn to the same place for the same reason. \n\nAs this was my first organised race, I really had no idea what to expect. The beginning of the race was extremely anti-climatic as the first 20 minutes were spent waiting for everyone else to start. Despite using the bathroom before the race, I desperately needed to pee again, but I wrote off the feeling as anxiety.\n\n# Race\n\nA group of pace makers with 1:55 flags started just behind me, and I resolved to follow them as a way to achieve my sub 2hr goal without having to think too much. Everyone had told me not to run too fast at the start, so I was surprised when the pace makers set off at a speed which seemed very quick to me. It took me a few kilometers to settle into their rhythm and get used to dodging between the other runners. There were no headphones allowed in the race so I focused on counting my steps and breathing. My heart rate very quickly exceeded 170bpm and stayed high but I told myself to just let my body do its thing and worst case scenario there'd be paramedics anyway.\n\nI blinked and was at 7k. I felt hungry so decided to eat my gel, but to my horror discovered my hands were too sweaty to open it; I made a right mess of things but managed to consume what was left after elegantly spilling most of it on myself.\n\nAt 10k there were some urinals, so I was finally able to take what felt like the longest pee of my life. I was very frustrated having to pee for so long when I wanted to be running. Catching up runners that I had previously passed made for an interesting game over the following kilometers at least.\n\nAt 13k the sun came out, and the next hour of running directly into it had me wishing I'd worn a hat. I wasn't expecting 21 degrees in February, but that's Spain I guess! My girlfriend appeared in the crowd at 15k which boosted my spirits greatly.\n\nAt 17k I noticed my heart rate was 198. I thought about slowing down but I wasn't dizzy or anything and decided just to push on. So far there had been very little suffering compared to what I was used to in the mountains and I felt that it was rare for me to be able to push my limits with the chance of immediate medical assistance so I might as well go for it. The last 5k was just a case of continuously deciding not to stop as my heart rate climbed to a maximum of 205bpm.\n\nWhen I crossed the finish line I again felt a sense of anti-climax. I hadn't enjoyed the race as much as I thought I would. I was very pleased to have achieved my goal of a sub 2hr half marathon, but running with 20,000 other people through a city is just not as fun as being in the mountains.\n\n# Post-race\n\nI walked home, showered, then walked to my girlfriend's family home for a total of 10k post-race walking. My arthritic knee felt fine, but my \"good\" knee was very sore and difficult to walk on after lunch. We took the bus home - I'm hopeful that it's just a bit of soreness rather than a serious injury. Maybe I should have stretched after the race.\n\n# Lessons learned\n\nI've got 4 weeks until the Barcelona Marathon, and I'm more intimidated by it than ever. It's very hard for me to imagine that I'll be able to sustain an average heart rate of 185bpm for 4 hours, but I'm also not super excited to be running for 5+ hours at a lower heart rate.\n\nEven so, having a challenge that I'm very likely to fail is invigorating and unless I am injured or believe that doing so will cause injury, I will run the marathon. I wish I had a more experienced runner that could mentor me, as I'm sure there are a lot of improvements I could make to my technique and approach to running. I'm not sure what to think about my heart rate.\n\nHowever, running my first organised race works has given me lots of ideas for giving it my best shot in the marathon: wearing sun cream and a hat, consuming fewer liquids before the race, buying a brand of gel that is easier to open, and using a treadmill more often in training.\n\nIf you read this far, thank you!

I did a time trial on December 31st and got 50 minutes, then with better pacing I did another time trial on January 7th and got 46:43. That was the baseline of what I was working with.\n\n**Training.**\n\nDo the fact that I only picked up running again in November when I started my 10k training in January I was only running 15 miles per week.\n\nBecause of my low mileage the main aspect of my training was just making sure to increase mileage by 10% every week. (Up to 26.5 miles this week) It's crazy how much packing on the miles can help with speed. One day a week I would also do a tempo run of 2 miles. The first week in January I did a 7:00 min\/mile pace and then each week I would try to do it about 5 seconds per mile faster. Starting after this race I will try to do more varied speed work than just 2 mile tempo runs.\n\n**Race Day pre race.**\n\nCheck the temperature to see it was 45\u00b0. That's great! Then I checked the wind to see 12 mile an hour wind, that's not as great. The course was a loop so that means I would go 4km against the wind then about 5km with the wind before a final 1km against the wind again.\n\nMy plan was to do a positive split doing the first 5k at a 7:10 pace and then hopefully pull out a 7:00 pace for the 2nd half to get under 44 minutes.\n\n**Race:**\n\n*Mile 1.*\n\nHere we go the race is on. Going to go out on feel just run comfortable. Nothing too fast, I won't check my watch for a little while and if I lose some time that's ok. Not going to get caught up in chasing people faster than me or otherwise going too fast like I always do.\n\nI feel pretty good, let's check my watch, it's about 0.6 miles and crap, I'm running at a 6:30 pace. Why can I never manage to do a negative split strategy?\n\nI Immediately forced myself to slow down and ended up finishing mile 1 in 6:53.\n\n*Mile 2-3.*\n\nI promise I was trying really hard not to go too fast, but I didn't feel like I was pushing it too much when I finished mile 2 in 6:58 and mile 3 at 7:01.  What am I supposed to do at this point in a race? I just did the first 5k more than 30 sec faster than planned. Should I switch to positive split? Am I going to be super gassed and crash even if I slow down?  But then a realization hit me. Almost that whole 5k was into the wind. Now that the wind is at my back I can probably keep pace without crashing. So that's the new goal, finish under 7:00in\/mile pace.\n\n*Miles 4-5.*\n\nI pushed a bit more in order to keep my pace under 7:00 and finished mile 4 and 5 at 6:58.\n\n*Mile 5-5.2*\n\nEver try to do math when exhausted? Well that was me from mile 5 to 5.2. I was trying to figure out my expected finish time but I just couldn't so I waited until 5.2 and added 7 minutes. My watch at 5.2 at 36:18 so that's a finish of 43:18. That's so close to sub 43, what if I could just get 6:42 for my last mile. I feel good. Let's go.\n\n*Mile 5.2-6.2*\n\nI started to run faster and push myself to get down under a 6:40 pace. Was running and I was thinking of the scene from Hook with a little kid says \"you're doing it\". I was doing it! And then I hit the final turnaround to go back to the park and was hit with a big reminder, there's 11 mph wind going the other way.\n\nJust 1K to go. Starting to push harder than I had been but still every time I checked my watch my pace is rising. Pushing harder but getting slower. I am so close just need to hold on a few more minutes. Okay. I'm going to pretend that I am a knife and I'm cutting through the wind and it will not affect me! Ok final push, it's not even the distance of a full lap at the track. I can see the finish line, the clock hits 42:00 but am I close enough to get there before 43 ? Push harder, just one minute. The clock is winding down.... and I made it. I crossed the line just before 43:00.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Post race:**\n\nI am super excited about this result. I did way better than I thought I was capable of. I have a 10k again in April, then June, then September.  This is my year of the 10k and we will see what I can do!","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1676786315.0},{"title":"Surf City Marathon - First Marathon and BQ","author":"PagodaIluminada","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/115sdom\/surf_city_marathon_first_marathon_and_bq\/","text":"### Race Information\n* **Name:** Surf City Marathon\n* **Date:** February 5, 2023\n* **Distance:** 26.2 miles\n* **Location:** Huntington Beach, CA\n* **Time:** 3:08:46\n\n### Goals\n| Goal | Description | Completed? |\n|------|-------------|------------|\n| A | Sub 3:05 (Qualify for NY Marathon) | *No* |\n| B | Sub 3:10 (BQ-10:00) | *Yes* |\n| C | Sub 3:05 (BQ-5:00) | *Yes* |\n| D | Finish | *Yes* |\n\n### Splits\n| Kilometer | Time |\n|------|------|\n| 5 | 22:09\n| 10 | 22:06\n| 15 | 22:27\n| 20 | 21:56\n| 25 | 22:22\n| 30 | 22:11\n| 35 | 22:15\n| 40 | 22:43\n| 42.2 | 10:37\n\n### Background\nMale, 45. Starting running in late 2020 when I was living in NZ, so sorry for posting in kilometers instead of miles, but that's the unit I learned to run with. After running a bunch of small 10K races, I ran my first HM in January 2022 (1:35), then ran 3 more HMs in the following 3 months, lowering my PR to 1:28. At that time average weekly mileage was about 50K\/week, with a peak of 65K\/week.\n\nI then made it my goal to run all 6 World Major Marathons, so step #1 was to qualify for Boston. I had just turned 45 so I had the advantage of being in the 45-49 age group, with the qualifying time of 3:20.\n\n### Training\nI was targeting a pace of 4:27\/km (7:10\/mile) for a 3:08 marathon. Some online calculators gave me an equivalent time of 3:04 based on my 1:28 HM, but I wanted to give myself a bit of buffer being my first full marathon. 3:08 also gives me a 12 minute buffer on my BQ time, so if I faded a bit on race day I could still qualify.\n\nI followed the 18-week Advanced Plan from the Hanson Marathon Method book. Before that, I spent 4 months backpacking overseas and ran very little whenever I could (usually 2-3 a week for a total of about 25K). I also got covid during the summer and another nasty flu a month before the training block. Despite that, I was able to ramp up my weekly mileage to 60K before the start of training.\n\nThe plan has a speed workout on Tuesdays, a MP tempo run on Thursdays, and long runs every other Sunday. You run 6 days\/week, and it peaks at 104K\/week. The longest MP run is 16K (plus warmup\/cooldown), and the longest long run is 27K. I had never run this much mileage before. At times my left knee got very stiff when resting, but it didn't bother me during runs. I also developed left foot 5th metatarsal tendonitis in the last few weeks leading to the race.\n\nThe training was hard. I think more so mentally than physically. There were a lot of days when I didn't feel like running. It wasn't just the run but all the prep before the run: nutrition, putting on sunscreen, and sometimes driving to a place to run. And also the stuff afterward: stretching, icing, nutrition, foam rolling, etc). As for the running itself, I was always a little fatigued (the plan wants you to feel this way), and the first 5K of each run always felt meh, but for the most part I enjoyed the running. It was very rewarding to see my body getting stronger and more resilient.\n\nThe speed workouts in the first few weeks felt hard, but they became more manageable after a few weeks. I was feeling tired but pretty strong towards the end of the training, often running the 16K race-pace tempos at a slightly faster pace.\n\n### Pre-race\nI mostly followed the plan's 9-day taper but cut back 5K of running on race week. It still has you run about 55K leading up to the race, with only one day off.\n\nI made sure I slept 8+ hours on most nights that week. Had plenty of fluids, and started carb-loading 2 days before. Also did a lot of stretching and foam rolling. My left foot was still a bit sore, but it didn't bother me while running, so I was just hoping that it would hold up during the race. Aside from that, I felt pretty good physically.\n\nI got about 3 1\/2 hours of crappy sleep the night before. Got up at 3:30 (6:30 race start), and had a bagel with peanut butter and coffee.\n\nI took 7 SiS gels with me. One to take 20 minutes before the race, and the rest during the race at 6K intervals. I like these gels because you can take them without water, and I dislike the overly sweet thick gels.\n\nI wore New Balance RC Elite 2s. I have wider feet and these felt much more comfortable than the Vaporflys. I don't know if the Vaporflys are faster. I honestly don't feel any faster on any carbon plated shoes compared to the Endorphin Speed 2s for example, but on this race I was going for comfort.\n\nMy B Goal was to run the pace I trained for (4:27\/km) and finish in 3:08. My C Goal was to still qualify for Boston with a 5-minute buffer (3:15). D Goal would mean that something went wrong (hit a wall or something) but I would still finish. The A goal was risky. I really want to qualify for the NYC Marathon, and I thought that if I felt very very good on race day, and could maybe average 4:25\/km for the first 20K, and then speed up the second half. But having never run more than 27K and this being my first marathon, I knew this could really backfire.\n\n### Race\nIt's not a big marathon, with only around 1,400 runners. It's pretty flat and you run mostly along the beach, with a section that goes inland for a bit. Weather was supposed to be fine, about 54 F (12 C) but with high humidity with a slight chance of very light rain.\n\nI got to the parking lot early but goofed around a little too long and barely made it in time to the start line. My watch only got a GPS lock 1 second before I crossed the start line. Not a relaxing start.\n\nRight away I realized that I didn't feel as fresh as I had hoped. On my previous HMs, race pace always felt slow at the beginning, a combined effect of the taper and race day excitement. But I didn't feel that way this day. It didn't feel hard, but it wasn't easy either, and I had no desire to go any faster. My HR was in the low 160s. During the late stages of training, it was in the low 150s or high 140s at this pace. The weather also didn't feel that pleasant. I had read that a dew point of around 50C was ideal, but I could definitely feel the humidity (around 85%). I gave up on my A goal and focused on my B goal. I knew it would take some hard work to keep 4:27\/km the whole way. Maybe I needed more tapering, or maybe I just don't like running in high humidity even when it's cool.\n\nI run mostly alone the whole way. I was caught in between the 3:05 and 3:15 pace groups. The 3:05 group quickly disappeared from sight. I was a bit worried because the 4:27\/km pace didn't feel much easier than during training, and I had never run more than 16K at that pace. Now I had to go almost 3x that distance.\n\nThe inland part of the course finished at 16K and you run along the coast for the rest of the way (2 outs and back). I was feeling ok. I saw a group of 2 running maybe 2s\/km faster about 30 meters ahead of me. I thought maybe it'd be a good idea to join them, but my legs just didn't feel like catching up to them. The good news was that my left foot wasn't bothering me at all, and there were no other aches.\n\nAt 20K you turn around and head back for the first return toward the start line (there's another out and back later). The sun came out and faced me for the next 6K which made things a bit more uncomfortable since there was zero shade. There was also very little crowd support in this section. It started to feel a bit harder to keep the pace. At 24K I took the only gel with caffeine that I had and felt better after that. \n\nThe last 16K is the second out and back along the shared bike\/walking path. It's not closed to the public so you have to dodge people from time to time. But it wasn't too bad. At 27K I started to go into uncharted territory. I had never run that far. The 16K race pace tempo runs during training are supposed to simulate the last 16K of the race (because of cumulative fatigue). I remember pretending at the beginning of those runs to be at this point of the race, and here I was doing it in the actual race. I felt more tired at this point than at the beginning of those training runs, but not much more tired.\n\nAt 32K I started doing the 10K countdown in my head. It always helps me to remember how much I suffered during those first 10K races 2 years ago when I wasn't in good shape yet. They would suck from the beginning and yet I still finished them, so I told myself I could do the same today. At this point I was doing fine aerobically, but my feet and ankle started to get sore. I also started to pass a lot of runners. Many of them slowed down considerably, and a few of them were cramping up. I felt a small twitch on my left calf, what felt like the beginning of a cramp. I took some extra liquids in the next few water stations and it was fine the rest of the way.\n\nI continued the countdown. I always get a boost with 5K to go and after 4K I started thinking in terms of 400m laps left. At this point I had 2 hot spots on my feet arches, and the feet and ankle were even more sore. It felt like I was driving a beat-up car that might lose a wheel or two at any time. I was just trying to keep it together by reminding myself to keep good running form. The end was close but I still didn't know if I could keep it all together. I slowed about 5s\/km at this point. My body wanted to slow down more, but I was motivated to finish under 3:10.\n\nIt wasn't until 2K to go that I knew that I was going to finish in less than 3:10. The watch had me at a predicted finish time 45 seconds slower than the target time. I sped up with a mile to go, and ran km 42 at 4:18, and the last 0.46km at a 3:55\/km pace. The last few hundred meters felt like a vortex, with the crowd around me and my eyes fixed on the finish line. I remember looking up at the clock with 50 meters to go and thinking \"look at that time!!!\". I crossed it in 3:08:46.\n\n### Post-race\nRight after crossing the finish line, I stopped for a bit and thought about all the hard work and time sacrifices over the previous 18 weeks. I was super happy to have finished the marathon at exactly the pace I trained for. Once I started walking again my feet were extremely sore. I had a noticeable limp. I also couldn't lift my right shoulder even though it didn't hurt at all during the race.\n\nThe race was hard and easier than I thought. The soreness and joint fatigue in the last 10K is something I had never experienced before. But aerobically I felt fine the whole way. My breathing was never labored and that was easier than expected. I wonder now if I could have pushed more if I just wasn't that afraid of the soreness and pain.\n\nI was pretty sore for the next 3 days. My quads felt very fatigued. I was feeling pretty normal after 5 days. After 9 days off, I ran for the first time (a very easy 4K) and my quads were still tired so I took another 2 days off. It's been now 12 days since the race, and I'll try running again today. The good news is that there are no apparent long term injuries from the race or training.\n\nOverall I was very happy with the Hanson training plan. It does require a lot of time and dedication but it does really prepare you for the race. A lot of people are skeptical that the longest run is only 27K (16 miles) but I can say (as someone who had never run longer than that until the race), that 27K during training is enough. I would definitely use the plan again for future races, but I might cut back the mileage a little more during the taper. I still don't know what made me not feel fresh on race day, but that might have been one of the factors.\n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http:\/\/sfdavis.com\/racereports\/) created by \/u\/herumph.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1676755893.0},{"title":"Achievements for Sunday, February 19, 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/11622ue\/achievements_for_sunday_february_19_2023\/","text":"Hey runners, it's another day and it is time to post your accomplishments you'd like to share - big or small.\n\nNote: No need to preface YOUR accomplishments with something like, \"this may not be an accomplishment to most of you...\".

I do road halfs almost every weekend, with an occasional cut-back week. Most of my recent training was speed and hill work. I tried my hand at some trail running before this race, but the terrain where I live (IN) is predictably different from the Sonoran desert, so the best I could do was some limestone trails. I'm doing 50 half marathons in 50 states and Arizona is state 3 of 50 for me.\n\nIt was really hard to set time goals since all my past times have been exclusively road races, so I was just in the camp of \"finish it and I don't care if I do it slow.\"\n\n## Race\n\n* I scoped out the course map in advance and kind of clung to the elevation chart provided... I was surprised at how persistently hilly the entire course was, because it showed it leveled out the last 4 miles (on the trail portion). The road hills, I was AMPED for. I trained hard for that and, for me, was busting ass at 7:45\"\/mi pace the first 8 miles.\n* Running with the sunrise was also super pretty and it was scenic af.\n* The trail portion, I have mixed feelings about. Past race reviews warn of how narrow it is, and no kidding. There were periods of being stuck behind someone for a good half mile. Around mile 10, I rolled my ankle the first time... and desperately wanted the people behind me to pass me so I could slow down a little but they would not pass me. Which led to me trying to keep a strong pace and then... about a mile later, I rolled my ankle a second time :(\n* One part of the trail was not very well flagged--traffic was still a bit spread out when I got to it and I lost sight of the people ahead--several people kind of stopped and had to look around a bit before figuring out where to go.\n* Finishing through Old Tucson was cool.

I signed up for my first 5K in November and got completely hooked. I knew that this was going to be the last Mercedes Marathon, so I figured why not go for it and try and do the half. I started seriously training for this race in early December. Everything was going great throughout December\/January. I don't remember what specific training plan I used but it was 5 runs a week, peaking at ~37miles. I wasn't missing any workouts, and I was seeing consistent improvement week over week. Then unfortunately, in mid January I got the dreaded turf toe from probably a combination of overuse and tennis. Initially I thought it was just soreness in my toe so I foolishly did a few my runs on it which made it much worse. I stopped everything for about 2 weeks leading up to a 10 mile race that I had signed up for in late January as a tuneup. I was able to do that race without much issue to my toe. At this point a lot of the pain was gone and it was just stiff. However, I managed to tweak my hip during the race, probably from subconsciously compensating for my toe trying not to hurt it again.. go figure. So since that race I've taken another 2 weeks off as well, just trying to get healthy enough to do this race. I kinda threw any time goals out the window and I just wanted to be able to finish. Thankfully the time off really helped. Turf toe seems to only get better with rest, and my hip began to feel a lot better a few days out from this race. Being new to running, I just had to idea what to expect from injuries, how to take them seriously, etc. Looking back I was definitely overeager and in the future I will take much more precaution because I see now how they can snowball. \n\n### Pre-race\nI was very nervous pre-race since I had only been able to run < 15 miles over the past month and I didn't know how I would handle the distance. The weather was looking good though, it had rained all night but stopped just before the race started and the temps were in the high 30s\/low 40s which was perfect.\n\n### Race\nI initially went out a bit too fast. I don't have very good pace management in general, it's definitely something I need to work on. I went through miles 1-2 pretty quickly, and then started to feel a bit stretched. This course was a bit hillier than I initially expected. Miles 5-8 were rough and by far the hardest mentally. I was definitely feeling the layoff of not having run much over the last month. Once I got past this stretch I think some adrenaline kicked in and knowing that I had made it through the toughest part of the course really helped. Miles 11-13 were further than I had ever run but from here the course was pretty much completely flat and the crowd really helped to kick me on. I crossed the finish line at ~1:38 and grabbed my medal! \n\n### Post-race\nI'm super happy with my time in the end. I think had I been able to do my complete training plan I could have done a bit better, but with how poorly the last month had gone I was very thankful this race went as well as it did. I think this time will be a solid target to try and beat in the coming year. I'm pretty bummed that the Mercedes Marathon isn't going to continue, but I'm happy I got to run it when I had the chance. I have my eyes on doing a full marathon at some point down the road, maybe late 2023 or 2024. I've heard good things about the Rocket City Marathon in Huntsville so I may try to at least do the half if it works out.

I took about 2 weeks off, and jumped back into training for this race, bumping up to Hal Higdon's Intermediate One from his Novice One during my previous training cycle. I moved during this training cycle and skipped a couple of runs, and the overall training cycle was about 10 weeks vs. the full 12 week program. I felt comfortable doing this since I had been just come off a different HM training cycle.\n\nThis time, I focused more on bodyweight strength training (Runner 360), and consistent foam rolling post-running. For my cross-training I focused more on getting my heart rate up a bit higher than during my last training cycle. No major injuries to speak of - something I'm keeping an eye on is metatarsalgia (pain caused by inflammation in the ball of your foot), but going to take a couple of weeks off and see a doc if it persists.\n\nThe longest training run I did for this race was 12 miles. It sucked. Mentally, I think I was starting to feel a bit burnt out and demotivated. It also ended up being in much warmer weather than I was used to training in. Given this, I was somewhat worried about how I would hold up during the race, but turns out I didn't need to worry. Despite missing a run here and there and the stress of moving, I was overall more consistent in paying attention to the fundamentals: running easy, and doing the necessary strength building and mobility work to support running longer and faster.\n\n**Pre-race**\n\nI got about 5.5 hours of sleep the night before, and woke up at 5 to prep for a 7 am start time. Had a PB&J and some coffee. I live close to the start of the race and because of this maybe was too lackadaisical about transportation. It was a squeaker, with my Lyft driver getting me as close as he could (about 0.5 miles away) less than 10 minutes before the race was due to start. I took this as an opportunity to warm-up and jogged the distance to the start and jumped in at the back of the line of runners that were making their way over the start line as I approached.\n\n**Race**\n\nThe adrenaline of getting to the race start propelled me for a bit and the first 2 miles fly by! Mentally, I tried to segment the race into 4 groups of 3 miles, with the last mile being its own adventure. Focusing just on the three miles I was currently running made it feel easier. I learned from my past HM and hit the aid stations early. I accepted water and sports drinks early and often. I took two Advil about 4 miles in. I am very conservative in my use of OTC pain meds during training, but know that on race day I would rather be proactive than suffer through something.\n\nThe course race had some fairly gentle uphill sections interspersed with longer flat stretches, culminating in a pretty significant downhill portion starting around mile 8. It's a beautiful course, with great spectators and amazing volunteers. This was a hometown race for me, and I really enjoyed being out in this particular community of runners. Physically, I felt good. My legs and some niggling pains started to bother me around mile 8, but I only walked during the aid stations and otherwise kept up a good, steady pace. Close to mile 12, the first place marathon runner passed us and that was really cool to see and gave me a boost to carry me through the last little bit.\n\nSomething different for me this race was I didn't use gels or other nutrition. I used Honey Stingers during training and my last HM, but started to feel it was a bit of overkill for me for this distance, and also that my stomach wasn't doing great with all of the sugar intake. This race, I brought some peanuts and m&ms with me, but after a couple bites around mile 5 didn't eat anything the rest of the race.\n\nI finished with a time of 2:26:01, a full 5 minutes faster than my previous HM in December.\n\n**Post-race**\n\nI took it easy the rest of the day and started looking up HM races coming up in May and June for inspiration for what's next. My right hip is giving me a little grief, but overall I feel OK. I'm super happy that this distance is starting to feel 'easier,' but I have more work to do to get my endurance and pace up. Overall, I'm really enjoying the process of learning how to be a better runner, and am excited about continuing to improve.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMade with a new \\[race report generator\\]([http:\/\/sfdavis.com\/racereports\/](http:\/\/sfdavis.com\/racereports\/)) created by \/u\/herumph.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1676299283.0},{"title":"Tuesday Shoesday","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/111ud51\/tuesday_shoesday\/","text":"Shoes are a big topic in this sub, so in an effort to condense and collect some of these posts, we're introducing **Shoesday Tuesday**!

I had been training lightly and inconsistently without a goal for about 2 months doing only 30ish kms a week. Prior to that I'd strung together about 2-3 months of 50-60km weeks. \nMy actual home is in the remote tropics of the Northern Territory in Australia and there is basically no running events and very difficult weather for distance running 7 months of the year. So when I arrived in Dubai on 02 December and realised how great the 'winter' weather is I decided I NEEDED to race, god I missed it. I wound up on the full marathon because they didn't offer a half marathon at the Dubai Marathon. \nI had essentially time for 10 weeks of dedicated training of around 50-60kms a week, I used a Luke Humphrey Running program. I know this was quite an increase however, I've never really been injury prone and have a pretty good understanding of my body's triggers.\nI have raced half marathons before with a PB of 1:27 but since I moved to the tropics in 2021 i haven't raced. Hopefully I will be moving south back to a temperate climate at the end of the year.\n\nThe training was hard, it's the most volume and intensity I've ever done, I have never consistently run 5 days a week before. \nIt was also my first time trying the Hanson method. I've got to say it worked - after all I finished, BUT I can't say I enjoyed it and if I'd do it again. The longer daily runs really take it out of you for the rest of the working day and make it hard to be motivated because most of the workouts and long runs can end up being quite challenging due to this.\n\nMaybe If I had a training block of base capacity at 50-60kms a week before I did this program it would've been more palateable.\nI didn't have any major injuries, I had a slight niggle in my right ankle from about week 6 but it was manageable.\n\nI neglected gym work a bit during my training... foreshadowing.\n\nI did a 1 week taper and I felt that it worked for me.\n\nGoal - I wanted to run 4:30-4:40 pace and no trouble with the training programs prescribed paces based off that. The final workout of 2x10KM marathon pace efforts did however, hurt a lot.\nI realise that's pretty ambitious considering:\n\n1. It's my first marathon.\n\n2. My form coming in to it and the short window I had to prepare.\n\n**Pre-race**\n\nThe race moved to an entirely new spot 6 days out. I managed to get a hotel basically on the finish and about 1km from the start. Most of the elites stayed here too which was really cool.\n\nI ate my last big meal 2 days out and followed, had a reasonable lunch before and small dinner.\n\nI got good sleep and woke up 3 hours before to have a light breakfast of toast. Cut my water away from 1h20 out and made it to the startline hydrated, energised and with 5 minutes to spare after a bathroom stop.\n\nWhen I left the hotel the Elites were all doing drills and warming up in the foyer which was pretty sweet to see.\n\n**Race**\n\nNutrition - 1 Gu Roctane gel every 20 minutes. 1 of those with caffeine each hour (the salt chocolate flavour is incredible). I would change this to 2 with caffeine in the 3rd hour, I really felt the kick those gave me.\n\nHydration - I drank water every 5km which was every second hydration station and I aimed for around .5-.8Litres an hour, aiming for the higher side of that window once the sun rose and the temps lifted slightly.\n\n\nOverall I felt awesome, I was maintaining 4:30-4:40 with relative ease for the first 26-28kms.\n\nIt was about 16 degrees at the start and didn't warm up much (a few degrees) by the time I finished.\n\nI was starting to feel fatigued a little fatigued overall at 28km in and then BANG. Small on\/off calf cramp. From this point I had to completely change my running style to essentially heel strike the rest of the race to try and avoid using my calves as much as possible (more on this below).\n\nI managed to limp home at 5-5:30 pace the rest of the way and I now fully understand the whole \"a marathon doesn't start until 30kms\" saying I've heard before.\n\nI got picked up by the 3:30 pacer with 4km to go and the legend dragged me home, basically wouldn't let me walk and just ran with me. I got to the end in 1:29.46, 100% thanks to this mad lad. I would've been a minute or two outside if not for him. Shoutout to race pacers, you're unreal. I really wonder how many people finish the race, either at all or faster than they would have, because of you legends. I hope you know how motivating you are.\n\nI started tearing up and just got a wave of emotions with about 3km to go, never felt that before, quite a surreal experience.\n\nCourse - Very meh. About 10kms around the site of the 2020 World Expo then out and back about an 8 lane highway with a nice view of construction sites. \n\nThe original course was basically flat, all my training had been flat.\n\nWhen you drive on the highways then seem pretty flat, when you run on them it's a different story. They're a constant slight up or down.\n\nThe location change meant very few supporters were there however, the energy of the crew along the course and the few supporters riding bikes and e-scooters along the route however was outstanding and really gave a lot to the event. If anyone sees this who was one, thankyou. If you saw me after 28kms sorry I didn't acknowledge you I was in a whole other place.\n\n**Post-race**\n\nI'm stoked that I finished and almost ran the whole way. Despite the cramps I think I walked a max of about 800m-1km and I realise i didn't make my time goal but, 3:30 for my first marathon is something to be proud of. I say first because I'll definitely be doing another. \n\nI think first, I'd like to go back to the half marathon first and shoot for sub 1:20. I ran 1:27 off only 30-35kms a week and without much idea what I was doing. I wanted to challenge this with much much better training and see what I'm capable of. Sadly my work moved me to the tropics before I could - I feel like I've got unfinished business.\n\nI feel really good energy-wise. Because of my cramps I had to slow down and I got to the end feeling like I'd done an 80% effort aerobically which was frustrating. If my legs had've held up I think 3:15 was in the crosshairs. I'm taking that as a win, I've got the engine for this- I just need to make sure the wheels don't fall off. \n\nMy legs however are in a bad way.\n\nI put this down to my lack of an effective strength training program (also due to my 10 week training window). I've done a bit of reading and it seems that my glutes and core fatiguing early (I felt them both getting sore around 22kms) probably forced my body to over recruit my calves. This combined with the inclines (slight as they were) that I hadn't trained for at all, probably is what did me in.\n\nI nailed my nutrition, I've always had a pretty iron gut and gels have never worried me. I think I maybe delayed 2 total gels and hit them at the 30 min mark instead of 20 mins apart. I know that a lot of first timers really screw that up so I'm chalking that up as a win.\n\nOverall I'm happy I finished at all after only 10 weeks of prep. \nMy key takeaway is DO MORE STRENGTH TRAINING. If anyone has had similar experiences or could recommend a good strength program I'd be interested.\n\nWould I recommend it - Yes, but if it's you're only choice. Theres other races at different times that didn't quite fit for me for a number of reasons. The original course was cool, the highway slog... not so much.\n\nTime for some rest and recouperation over the next 2 weeks before I start going for another goal.\n\nP.S - I missed this. I missed racing like this so much. If you got this far thanks for reading, I did this mainly for self-reflection but also to help any other first timers or people trying this race out in the future.\n\nThis post was generated using the new race-reportr, powered by coachview, for making organized, easy-to-read, and beautiful race reports.","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1676205512.0},{"title":"Li'l Race Report Thread","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/110zya7\/lil_race_report_thread\/","text":"\nThe Li\u2019l Race Report Thread is for writing a short report on a recent race or a run in a new place.

(Video: Alexa Juliana Ard\/The Washington Post)\n\nSo-called \u201csuper shoes,\" which are high-tech sneakers that companies claim help wearers run faster, have taken over the running world. Professional and elite runners say the shoes have helped them break records, and amateur marathoners buy them in hopes of running a personal best.\nGet the full experience.Choose your plan\n\nOne of the best-known super shoes on the market, the Nike Vaporfly line, can sell for $250 or more. Now a team of exercise scientists has authored a study that aimed to answer the question: Should average runners bother with these shoes?\n\n\u201cMost of the research that had been done was on people and paces that would be relevant to people who were running like sub-three hour marathons, which is a really small fraction of runners,\u201d said Dustin Joubert, the study\u2019s lead author. \u201cAnd yet these shoes are marketed to everybody.\u201d\nRunning fast and slow\n\nSuper shoes typically have a lightweight, compliant and highly resilient midsole foam with a curved, rigid plate often made from carbon fiber embedded within the foam.\n\n\u201cA shoe with just the foam is not quite super, and a shoe with just the plate is not super,\u201d said Geoff Burns, a co-author of the study. \u201cTogether, they\u2019re magic.\u201d\n\nOr at least, it seemed that way. A Nike-funded study published in 2017 found that among 18 runners tested, the shoes improved running economy \u2014 the amount of oxygen required to cover a certain distance \u2014 by 4 percent on average. That study looked at running speeds ranging from 14 to 18 kilometers an hour \u2014 or runners who can sustain between a 5:22 to 6:54 mile pace.\n\nAn independent study published in 2022 by Joubert compared different brands of super shoes and found that the Nike Vaporfly improved running economy by about 2.7 percent at speeds of 16 kilometers an hour (or 6:02 mile pace) compared to a control shoe.\n\nBut Joubert, an assistant professor of kinesiology at St. Edward\u2019s University in Austin, hypothesized, based on case study testing on himself, that at slower speeds, the super shoes would not be as beneficial.\n\nFor the new study, the researchers tested 16 runners \u2014 eight women and eight men \u2014 at far slower paces than in the previous studies. These runners moved as fast as 12 kilometers an hour (an 8:03 mile pace) and as slow as 10 kilometers per hour (a 9:40 mile pace). (A four-hour marathon is a 9:09 mile pace.)\n\nAs in the earlier studies, the focus was running economy. Burns, a physiologist with the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee and an adjunct assistant professor of kinesiology at the University of Michigan, describes running economy as \"very similar to your fuel economy in your car.\u201d\n\nThe runners completed one set of four repetitions of 5-minute trials on a treadmill, moving at the 10 km an hour pace followed by a similar set of repetitions at the 12 km an hour pace. There was a 5-minute break between each 5-minute trial.\n\nSubjects wore either the $250 Nike ZoomX Vaporfly Next% 2, which represented super shoes, or the $90 ASICS Hyper Speed, which served as the control shoe representing a more traditional racing flat. Each runner ran twice in each shoe style, completing multiple reps at both paces.\n\nThe researchers found that the subjects improved their running economy by just a fraction \u2014 suggesting that the shoes do more for you, the faster you run. In the study, runners running at 9:40 mile pace improved their running economy by .9 percent, on average, while they improved by 1.6 percent at 8:03 mile pace.\n\nJoubert also pointed out that five of the subjects did worse while wearing the super shoes. Their running economy was worse in the Vaporfly while running at the 10 kilometers per hour speed.\n\nNike didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. The Washington Post reached an ASICS America spokesperson, who said the company did not want to comment on an independent study.\n\nBurns speculated that average runners may not be maximizing the benefits of the foam at slower speeds. \u201cThe faster and faster you run, the more force is put through the shoe,\u201d Burns said. \u201cAt slower and slower speeds, you no longer fully compress it and you\u2019re not really using the full potential \u2014 literally and figuratively \u2014 energy of it.\"\n\nHe also noted that the curved, carbon-fiber plate embedded in the foam of the shoe may not offer the same benefits at slower paces. \u201cThere could also be a speed dependency to that plate,\" Burns said. And it\u2019s possible the stiff plate may negatively impact a slower runner, he speculated: \u201cYou need to have some level of speed threshold to kind of really not be working against the plate or fighting it.\u201d\n\nBurns added that one limitation of the study is that the runners were all about the same size. It\u2019s possible that runners of different weights might produce a difference result.\n\nBoth Joubert and Burns said that they believe the results from this study would be applicable to super shoes by other brands.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t like the shoe or get on with the shoes well, it\u2019s not a guaranteed benefit,\u201d Joubert said.\nA new study suggests that slower runners may benefit less from \u201csuper shoes,\u201d like the Nike Vaporfly, than faster runners. (Video: Alexa Juliana Ard\/The Washington Post)\nA potential mental boost from super shoes\n\nWouter Hoogkamer, who conducted the 2017 study funded by Nike, called the new study \u201cvery well-executed\u201d but said he found the results \u201csomewhat surprising.\" The ASICS control shoe could have made a difference, he said. Hoogkamer\u2019s study used a different control shoe.\n\n\u201cI think at these slower speeds, the control shoe might be fine,\u201d said Hoogkamer, an assistant professor in kinesiology at the University of Massachusetts who was not involved in the recent study. \u201cSo it\u2019s not necessarily that the Vaporfly shoes are not as good; it\u2019s more that the control shoe might be enough shoe to work well if you\u2019re not running that fast.\u201d\n\nLisa Levin, a Road Runners Club of America certified running coach, said she tells her clients to get fit for shoes at a specialty running shoe store and that the most important thing is that the shoes fit a runner\u2019s biomechanics. Comfort is also important.\n\n\u201cBecause if you get injured or the shoe is hurting you or not a good shoe for you, it is definitely not going to make you faster,\" she said.\n\nLevin added that sometimes, being in a super shoe can give runners a mental boost.\n\n\u201cI would hate to say, \u2018This is only a shoe for fast people.\u2019 That feels very elite,\" she said. \"But again, our concern as coaches is, don\u2019t just jump into a shoe that you don\u2019t even know is going to work for your biomechanics.\u201d\n\nJoubert said the findings add to our understanding of the role of shoes in running performance, and shouldn\u2019t necessarily discourage slower runners from trying them. For some runners, the approximately 1 to 1.5 percent potential improvement in running economy might also be worth it.\n\n\u201cThe effects are still meaningful,\" he said. \"I think you might expect that they\u2019re not going to get as large of a benefit as some folks running at faster speeds, but if you had the money and you\u2019re looking for a racing shoe, and you liked the feel of the shoe, I think you stand to have some benefit from it.\u201d","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1675952917.0},{"title":"Official Q&A for Friday, February 10, 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/10ygrng\/official_qa_for_friday_february_10_2023\/","text":"With over 2,325,000 subscribers, there are a lot of posts that come in everyday that are often repeats of questions previously asked or covered in the FAQ.\n\nWith that in mind, this post can be a place for any questions (especially those that may not deserve their own thread).

On my third try\/application this past September, I got in! I knew I had to seek some outside council if I had any chance to finish this thing. I hired a coach who I had heard great things about and set out to try and start a build towards some big weeks in December\/early January. \n\n\nSince this race is all about pulling a sled for 135 miles, before the snow flew, I started as early as September\/October with dragging a tire behind me on a gravel hill at a dog park near my house at least once a week, and worked up from 3-4 runs per week with some bike commutes up to 6 days running a week, and sometimes even some Nordic skiing as a double or on the rest day (although I tried to be regular about one a day a week with no activity other than a light walk). Also was probably the most regular I have ever been with strength training, working in 1-2 sessions per week very regularly, nearly all bodyweight stuff. Mixed up some of the running with the sled as hiking, because I knew aside from some course record holders, a lot of the miles during the race would be powerhiked rather than ran. \nOnce the snow flew and things were about to get serious with mileage \u2013 I right away caught Covid in late November. It wasn\u2019t a serious case but decided to go the cautious route and take essentially a full week off with no running. With a re-ramping up week and rebuild from there, was able to get some big weeks in December in, peaking at around 80 miles in a 7-day period, with about 10 hours of those miles being sled dragging around a local forest with a good snowpack. Had some good -25 degree (Celsuis) weather mixed in there too, so I could practice bivvying (tucking into a cold-weather sleeping bag in a little mini-tent), as well as finding which food and water systems would work well in the cold in the sled. \n\n \n### Pre-race\nGot to International Falls two days before the race to get to gear check, where they confirm you are carrying all of the required gear for the race, like your sleeping set-up, pot and stove to boil water, 3000 emergency calories that you need to carry all the way to the finish line with you \u2013 I used a jar of that sugary peanut butter. Excitedly went to check out the start line, right in the middle of International Falls in a park by a hockey rink. Went out for dinner and ran into a bunch of other Arrowheaders, ended up sitting together and hearing some of their stories from previous years as well as about how some of them had been up to Alaska for the famed Iditarod Trail Invitational, telling tales of their sleep-deprived hallucinations and moose encounters.  \n\n\nNext day was the pre-race meeting, as well as an emergency stop for replacement trekking poles as I realised I forgot mine at home, a spaghetti dinner for the runners, and then getting back to the hotel to do a final check of the gear, pack the sled up, and try to get to bed by 9 PM for a 5 AM wakeup to start down the trail!\n\n\n### Race\nDespite any grogginess from an early alarm, the -30 degree Celsius weather was a real wake-up call. Suddenly, things seemed very real \u2013 this was actually happening. I checked in at the start line, turned on all my safety blinky lights and my satellite tracker, strapped my sled harness on, watched the start-line fireworks, and boom \u2013 we were off (\u201cRelease the hounds\u201d is the RDs traditional call to send us off). I couldn\u2019t believe the energy all 150 participants across ski, foot, and bike divisions were all giving off \u2013 it was totally electric, and all the blinky lights and reflective vests made for quite a rave atmosphere.\nThe first stretch of trail was flat, smooth, and with the rising sun and company all around, went by in a real blur. I settled into my eating and drinking routine and just let the miles go by. Saw a few people I had met before at prior winter ultras and chatted a bit, and before I knew it, the first 35 miles were nearly done! I had put earbuds in but never used them once that first stretch. The sun was getting lower in the sky when we pulled into the first aid station, which is a convenience store\/gas station called Gateway. \n\n\nAt Gateway I realised I had accidentally committed a cardinal sin of getting too sweaty during the first stretch, and tried to rectify that with a full change of clothes. I sneakily dropped trousers behind a coat rack, and then with the joy of fresh socks and clothes, spent some time enjoying a pizza slice, mozza sticks, two powerades, and a bowl of soup. I got a little bit too comfortable sitting while eating and had to peel myself out to head back into the sunset.\n\n\nThe next stretch started out great but between the darkness, the much quieter trail (people having spread out quite a bit more), and the start of the first feelings of fatigue, some of the first difficult moments of the race started to creep in. All along my plan was just to focus on not the whole race but just getting to the next checkpoint\/aid station. All I was doing was moving forward toward the second checkpoint (Mel George\u2019s Resort Cabins), not worried about the entirety of an 135 mile race. When I was about 5-10 miles away from the second checkpoint, the sleepies finally started to impact me where I would find my eyes closed on the middle of the trail, occasionally wondering off of the trail into the deep snow. I hit a coffee-flavoured maple syrup packet which perked me up enough to finish this 35-mile stretch, ending with a traverse across the frozen Elephant Lake into the aid station cabin.\n\n\nI was so tired getting into the second checkpoint I feel like I was mostly incoherent to questions from the awesome and kind volunteers trying to help. They suggested I tried to find a quieter place to sleep but I basically crawled into a corner where there was a small cot and instantly passed out for two hours, even with all of the chatter and buzz. I knew I had a good amount of time until the cutoff and thought this would be the right play for how tired I had been on the last stretch. I woke up with bad ankle stiffness but just went about getting ready to go out again and tried to not worry about it too much. I ate, drank, applied more lubrication, changed socks once more, dried out my clothes as well I could, and with as much gusto I could muster, I trundled out of the cabin and was on my way again down the trail. \n\n\nI could start to sense something was off with my shins\/ankles, but I sort of chalked it up to general soreness\/I knew it would be hard. After the nap, aside from the ankles and some minor chafing, most everything felt like it was going really, really well \u2013 I was feeling awake, consistently dry, mostly warm, eating well, drinking well, and didn\u2019t feel nauseous (I saw someone who had dropped from excessive puking \u2013 in fact, I had seen a lot of people dropping at the previous aid station). This section got very hilly and I felt like there was a bit of fun rhythm to hiking up a hill and then getting to ride my sled down it, if it was steep enough. The race had thinned out a little more than it already was, and when I did see other runners, they always seemed to be either significantly faster or slower than me, so didn\u2019t spend too much time with anyone anymore.\n\n\nI can\u2019t exactly put my finger on when it started to go south but somewhere around 30 miles after the second checkpoint, and only 10ish miles from the third and last checkpoint, the ankle\/shin pain went from bad to worse to totally untenable. I knew my pace was slowing way down each mile. At one point I stopped altogether and pulled over and tried to (carefully, cause it was getting dark and to be around mid -20\u2019s temperature again) peel down my socks \u2013 that\u2019s when I saw my massively swollen shins & ankles, and very white-looking feet. Somehow, from some combination of factors, maybe my feet swelling combined with a too-tight arrangement of long tights and socks, I feel like I had really cut off circulation to my feet. My socks had dug a deep looking impression into my shins. I tried an emergency lay-down on my sled, having shuffled around my layers a bit to try and take some pressure off, but all of a sudden started to feel very cold, lonely, tired, and generally despondent. Suddenly the next checkpoint seemed very, very far away \u2013 and I found myself turning on my phone to make the forbidden call. It was wild to even hear the words come out of my mouth \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m done \u2013 Arrowhead is over for me.\u201d\n\n### Post-race\nA snowmobile volunteer had passed me fairly recently and had offered me a ride if I quit (I guess I wasn\u2019t looking too hot) so I called them up and they came and picked me up in very short order. The volunteer crew and community at this race is totally incredible and unlike pretty much any other race I had ever done. I bundled up with my emergency clothes (my \u201coh shit\u201d jacket) and tried to start make meaning of what had just happened. I had traveled about 100 miles in a total of 40 hours elapsed. So much had gone right through hard training, rehearsal, planning, discipline, and effort, but I had made a mistake, and now my race was over, 35 miles before I had dreamed of it being.\n\n\nMy partner who had so graciously come down to the race with me picked me up from the snowmobiler and gently took me back to the room we had booked at the finish line. I barely remember anything from that stage onward aside from thinking I needed to try and have a bath, which lasted about 2 minutes before I crawled towards bed to lie down and pass out.\n\n\nThe next morning, I think somehow I found a little more peace within the DNF hangover by realising how incredibly pain\/stiff\/swollen my ankles were \u2013 it somehow solidified my decision to drop as being the right one. I guess now I want to do some more research into how & why it happened and how to avoid it for the future. And maybe start deciding if I ever owe it to myself to either try (or not try) to finish this beats of a race ever again.\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http:\/\/sfdavis.com\/racereports\/) created by \/u\/herumph.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1675795022.0},{"title":"Counter arguments to The Lost Art of Running by Shane Benzie?","author":"pjlehtim","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/10wezju\/counter_arguments_to_the_lost_art_of_running_by\/","text":"I've been reading a lot about running, running form and related philosophy.

Been exercising 3-4 times per week for 6 years now. BUT before this October (2022), could count on my fingers the number of times in my life I had run more than 5 miles. I had been running on and off for years, usually no more than 2-3 miles, and had been getting anywhere from 6:10\/mile to 8:00\/mile depending on the weather, etc. So, not terrible, but never had the energy or patience to do the distance. Then one day I committed to doing at least a half in April 2023 with a friend and later agreed to do this one I'm describing now. Started doing 3-4 runs a week. Didn't really know what I was doing while training (still don't), but eventually learned that I should do one long run per week. So I slowly increased the top distance every week, doing some 7, 8, and 9 mile runs around Christmas. Did my first ever 10-mile run in early January, along with my second and third in the subsequent weeks.\n\nOne thing I think really helped me is that because I work remotely I went and hung out in Mexico City a few weeks before and after Christmas (traveled to CA from Mexico a week before the race). It's at \\~7,300 feet (2,200 meters) So while I never really ran that fast in Mexico (most runs between 7:50 and 8:40\/mile) it must have helped, right?\n\nAnyway, based on the type of runs I was doing and how I felt (was dead after 2 10-mile runs in Mexico City at a \\~8:40 pace, don't know if I could have finished), I figured I'd have to go slower earlier on (which has always been a problem for me) and aim for 1:50-1:55. However, the two runs I did in the week prior to the race while back at sea level were two of the easiest runs I had done in my life. So I felt pretty good about finishing at least and left the door open to do better than the 1:50.\n\n## Pre-race\n\nHad pasta the night before. \\~6.5-7 hours of sleep. 5AM wakeup. Breakfast was eggs and toast. Black coffee. Could not empty my bowels at home or at the race porta potties! Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu\\*\\*! So that really worried me... had been a problem mid-run a few times in the past. Forgot about it and hoped for the best. Lined up a little behind the 1:55 pacer, and started the Spotify playlist. Go time!\n\n## Race\n\nWhen the race started I got all the fuzzies. It was awesome. Out of the 25 or so songs I had on my playlist the first one (they were in order) was a Hans Zimmer song from the new Top Gun. It was perfect. 55 degrees, beachside run, people all around. I don't know what word to give it but it was great, I just smiled and ran. It was like I was high on something. Nearly teared up! Hahaha. Unlike anything I had experienced in a while. Anyone else?\n\nImmediately forgot I had told myself to start at a slower pace (was thinking 8:30-9) and found it incredibly easy to run at about 8:00. Too easy. But I had purposely picked four longer 8-9 minute songs so that I wouldn't speed up too much, and I stayed steady. People were passing me but I didn't worry about it. I knew I needed to start slow. There were a few miles that turned into a residential neighborhood and I could see the top runners already heading in the other direction. I ooo'd and awwwwed' at their speed, damn!\n\nI had a transition song in my playlist that I wanted to use to consider if and how much I should speed up. That was about mile 5. Had some quality pop, rock, and reggaeton music I knew would pump me up (Feeling This by Blink-182 was the best one of those). Felt good and sped up to a 7:30\/mi pace for the next 4 miles. It still felt easy. I started doing more of the passing, including cruising by the 1:45 pacers, which felt great.\n\nThe course turned and headed back in the opposite direction down the beach right around the start of mile 8. It was a straight shot to the finish. I felt really really good. I did some quick math looking at my watch and thought I could book it and make 1:40. So right at the turn I said F\\*\\*\\* IT and picked up more speed. You only live once. From then on I stuck to about a 7-minute pace. Only one person passed me for the last 5.1 miles. The songs I picked for this part were the best and most inspirational for me. Kept picking up speed. Eventually started to feel like I was hitting a wall, the exhaustion set in. That last 2-3 miles was one of the hardest things I've ever done. Don't know how I kept up the pace, really have no idea. But the crowd started getting bigger and louder and the adrenaline kicked in. Strava says I ran 13.3 miles (the above are my Apple Watch splits). I bring that up because it says my last 0.3 miles or so were at a 6:18 pace. Woof. It felt awesome. During that last quarter mile or so I did what I told myself I was going to do mid-race. I zoooomed past the 1:40 pacers!!!!! And there was the finish line. Couldn't believe it when I saw 1:37 on the finish line clock. Strava said I broke my 10 mile, 10k, and 5k (5k!!!!!!!) record in that 13.1 mile race.\n\nWhat. A. Day. Straight up one of the coolest things I've ever done.\n\n## Post-race\n\nI was going to have to wait for a bit for my friend that was aiming for a 3-hour half. So I got a banana, some pretzels, took off my drenched shirt and just sat on the beach for a good 30 minutes, asking myself WHY DID I WAIT UNTIL I WAS 30 TO DO THIS! WOOHOO!\n\n# Advice???\n\nSo, if you've made it this far, then you are far too nice of a person. I ask you for some advice (though maybe I will make this a new post because I think it's an interesting and worthy question, at least the first one). If I never return to training at elevation, am I going to do worse on my next go around in April (discounting the general training I will do from now until then)? Or am I overthinking this?\n\nAnother thing, I noticed my Apple Watch saying I am doing about 150 steps per minute. I didn't know that was a thing it measured, so I looked up what it should be for a good runner, and saw 180 as a good minimum to aim for. Does the 150 mean anything performance-wise? Any advice to get to a faster SPM?\n\nAny general advice to stay motivated and get on a real training regimen? Maybe a specific website or tutorial you like to recommend (I have found a million on Google all that say something slightly different, I want to know what *YOU* have found success with). In the past I was always trying to beat my 2 mile time. I got down to 6:10 pace. I feel like it will be the same here. How can I just get faster and faster every time.\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http:\/\/sfdavis.com\/racereports\/) created by \/u\/herumph.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1675745933.0},{"title":"Best smart treadmill app for scenic runs that adjusts to your pace and doesn't force some talkative trainer upon you?","author":"Sufficient_Slice9584","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/10wimy0\/best_smart_treadmill_app_for_scenic_runs_that\/","text":"I just want to run with scenery that adjusts to my manual speed changes with either no trainer or an optional one.

It has me running 6 days a week with roughly 80% easy miles and 20% at tempo or marathon pace. Long run Sundays, easy Mondays, interval Tuesdays, off Wednesday, MP Thursdays, easy Fridays, and easy Saturdays. The standard plan is 18 weeks long and has runners topping out around 64 mpw. Having run a 3:08:59 and failing to BQ at my last race in October, I didn't have the full 18 weeks to build up for my February race. I decided to jump in around week 6 of the plan and added a bit more mileage by upping the easy run mileage by roughly 15% and doing long runs of 18 miles instead of the standard 16. That had me maxing out at 70 mpw.\n\nPart of the reason I failed to BQ (needed a 3:05) in October is that I had to take 2 weeks off of training due to a strained peroneal 6 weeks out from that race. I strength-trained 3 nights a week throughout this training block in order to keep injuries at bay. It worked! I also focused on getting quality sleep of at least 7.5 hrs every night. Despite higher mileage, I remained healthy.\n\n\\### Pre-race\n\nI drove about 5.5 hrs to Greenville, MS on Friday. Greenville is not a very big place and like many towns in the Mississippi River Delta, it's experiencing a population exodus as young people choose to leave for bigger cities with better economic opportunities. Despite all of the economic doom and gloom, everyone that we met was very kind and welcoming. Seriously, everyone seemed genuinely happy that we had come to their little town to run the race. The expo was tiny, but quick and efficient. After the expo, we went for my traditional pre-race dinner of chicken fried rice at a local Chinese restaurant. Then we headed back to our hotel, prepped clothes for the morning, and tried to get to bed by 9 pm.\n\nI woke up around 4:45 am after a night of sub-par sleep. I had pop-tarts and a tortilla for breakfast along with a cup of black coffee. We drove to the finish line at about 6:15 am where we were to board buses that would take us back to the start line in Lake Village, AR. Buses were off at 6:30 sharp and drove us out of Greenville and through the rural backroads and rice farms that dominate the landscape. It was cool the morning of the race at 32\u00b0 F \/ 0\u00b0 C with a light breeze from the south. [This](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/lFsM4is.jpg) was the view looking back from the starting area. They moved everyone over to the start line and very quickly went over safety and the national anthem.\n\n\\### Race\n\nI didn't start close enough to the front, but with a field of only 190 marathoners, it was easy to filter through within the first 1\/4 mile or so. I always run my first couple of miles a little slow and I always have to tell myself that's okay because I know I make it up in the middle of the race. This was no different with my first 2 miles above my target pace of 6:51\/mi. At around mile 3, a dog ran out from someone's house and I genuinely thought the guy 15 s ahead of me was going to be bitten, but the dog returned to its house just as quickly as he'd run out. Talk about getting the adrenaline going. By mile 4, I was starting to settle into my rhythm, but I was annoyed that we were running into a headwind. Thankfully, the course changes direction around mile 6 and I quickly forgot about the wind. I also had my first gel, a caffeinated Maurten at mile 6.\n\nJust after mile 6, the course turns onto Hwy 278, the rural 4-lane highway that runs between Lake Village, AR and Greenville, MS. I was a bit nervous about safety on this section of the course, but there were law enforcement, firefighters, and EMTs from both city and county agencies everywhere along the course. These small communities pull out all the stops for this event. The entire shoulder and the outside lane were coned off for runners. There were aid stations every mile and because the landscape is pancake flat, you could basically see from one aid station to the next. I decided to focus on each successive aid station and make sure that I was maintaining my pace. This worked well until about mile 12 where the course has runners crossing a bridge over the mighty Mississippi River. It's a verrryyy long bridge and presents the only real elevation gain, about 80 feet, for the entire course. Also, no aid stations were allowed on the bridge. Gel #2, a non-caffeinated Maurten, went down around mile 12. After coming down from the other side of the bridge, I was still feeling strong, but I had to keep telling myself that I was well ahead of pace for 3:00 and not to get greedy.\n\nI had gel # 3, another non-caffeinated Maurten, at mile 16. The miles were still going by quickly and I was still feeling good around this point, but I knew that couldn't last forever. Around mile 19, I started to feel the flame flickering a bit, but I was still able to keep churning and staying ahead of my target pace. I had gel #4, a caffeinated Maurten at mile 20.5 and hoped that the caffeine boost would keep me going for the last 6 miles. Things really started to suck at mile 22 and I had to argue with myself over and over again about how there were only a few more minutes of suffering, but that a sub-3 time would last forever. I also quit paying attention to my pace as much here and thought I was going much slower than I actually was. A runner that I had passed early in the race, around mile 6, moved ahead of me at this point and gave me a bit of encouragement. I decided to try to keep pace with him for the remaining 3 miles and that genuinely helped. Miles 23 and 24 were a mostly unpleasant slog. The same can be said for the first half of mile 25. I could see the downtown area and finish line at about 25.7 miles. I squinted at the clock over the finish line at 26 miles and could make out 2:5X:XX. I wasn't sure if it was 2:58 or 2:59 at that point, but obviously hoped for the former. As I got closer, I could see the seconds hit 00 and realized that the clock was still showing 2:59:XX. My wife and the race director were both cheering me on as I made the final push across the finish line at gun time 2:59:35 with a chip time of 2:59:25.\n\n\\### Post-race\n\nI wanted to fall over after crossing the finish line, but knew that was a bad idea. I took my medal from the race director and paced back and forth while my wife handed me water and a protein bar. I continued to pace in a state of delirium for a few minutes until my brain started working again. We headed inside to the post-race party where they had tamales, donuts, pizza, and more. I don't ever pay for medal engraving, but decided to do it this time since it was my first sub-3 and my first BQ.\n\nWe headed back to the hotel for a shower and hit the road back home.\n\nI was a little nervous about whether or not a small race in a rural area would be well-organized, but I was seriously impressed by everything. It is a well-oiled machine of a race run by a great group of people.\n\nMade with a new \\[race report generator\\]([http:\/\/sfdavis.com\/racereports\/](http:\/\/sfdavis.com\/racereports\/)) created by [\/u\/herumph](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/u\/herumph\/).","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1675704748.0},{"title":"First Half Marathon in 8 Years - Setting New Goals Mid Race","author":"StructureMotor5502","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/10vge06\/first_half_marathon_in_8_years_setting_new_goals\/","text":"Name: Best Damn Half Marathon  \nDate: February 5, 2023  \nDistance: 13.1 miles  \nLocation: Safety Harbor, FL  \nTime: 1:34  \n\nGoals  \nGoal\tDescription\tCompleted?  \nA\tSub 1:45\tYes  \nB\tSub 1:40\tYes  \n  \nSplits  \nMile\tTime  \n1\t7:32  \n2\t7:30  \n3\t7:34  \n4\t7:24  \n5\t7:09  \n6\t7:11  \n7\t7:08  \n8\t7:03  \n9\t7:07  \n10\t7:12  \n11\t7:03  \n12\t6:58  \n13\t6:56  \n\nTraining  \nI started training in earnest in October after I raced a 5 hour kayak race. I started off around 12 miles a week and built to around 25 a week. Didn't have a set plan, but I was doing averaging 1 long run, 2 easy runs, and 1-2 tempo runs a week. I kayak and bike as well so my cardio was in quite good shape before I started my training and my legs had some catching up to do. I hadn't run a half marathon or any race in about 8 years, so I had no real idea how to set a goal for the race. I knew I wanted to go under 1:45 and did it relatively easily in a long run, so my updated goal was low 1:4X. \n\nPre-race  \nThe day prior I trained with a canoe racing team for 90 minutes and played golf. Not the best prep for a race, but it was fun. I live a mile from the course start, so I had a quick bagel and warmed up on my way to the course. Talked to my wife who also ran as well as a friend who was there before lining up. They were starting the racers in waves. The first wave was anyone planning to go sub 7:30\/mile, second wave was 7:30-8:30 and so on. I decided to start with the 2nd wave and go out with the 1:40 pacer. I prefer passing people rather than getting passed. I knew some of the people in the first wave had no business being up there and would give me some targets to reel in throughout the race.\n\nRace  \nThe race went off and I stuck to the 1:40 (~7:35 target mile) pacer. Talked a bit to the people around the pacer as we went and got into a groove. I train alone or with my wife, so it was kinda odd running in a pack. We went through a couple of very easy hills and I was feeling really good at the pace we were at. As we went through mile 3, I checked my watch and my heart rate was at 153 and I knew I had more in me. I started to ease into a faster pace and moved past the 1:40 group. \n\nAs expected, people from the first wave and a couple from the 2nd who went out too hard started to drop back towards me and I was able to use them as targets to continually catch and pass as the race went on. At around mile 8 I knew I was well ahead of my 1:40 goal pace and started to do the math on a 1:35 finish. My heart rate was near 163 at this point and I was pretty confident I could hold 7:0X for the rest of the race. Decided to go for it and got through the toughest part of the course through miles 9-11. Ended up passing 4-5 more people from the front group over the last miles and put everything I had into it during the last 2. I was hurting pretty badly at that point, but knew sub-1:35 was there if I could hold on. Got though the finish line and felt awful, but I smashed my original 1:45 goal and my updated 1:40 goal. Turns out it is really difficult to set a pace when you aren't an experienced runner with recent results. With better pacing I would have had a much easier time hitting 1:34\n\nPost-race  \nMet up with a friend who was came to the race and waited for my wife to finish. She beat her 2:00 goal and we took a couple of pictures before heading home and then to the beach for lunch and laying around. Woke up today and feel positively terrible from the race and hangover from beach day drinking.\n\nI could afford to lose ~20 lbs and think with continued running I could pretty easily go sub 1:30 which is a longer term goal. For the time being I will be turning back towards kayak racing after a couple of days off.  \n\nMade with a new race report generator created by \/u\/herumph.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1675713520.0},{"title":"Tuesday Shoesday","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/10vt7qw\/tuesday_shoesday\/","text":"Shoes are a big topic in this sub, so in an effort to condense and collect some of these posts, we're introducing **Shoesday Tuesday**!

The reasons were severalfold, I was going through a major life transition that took a big emotional toll, and I just didn't train enough.

It's a lot of $ which I had already spent last year (this is an international marathon) and I will spend again. I keep questioning myself about this. I feel that I owe it to myself to complete it and I know I can do it (my first marathon was 2021, NYC). I am not a fast runner, I am back of the pack. I would like to hear from people who have had similar experiences and how you faced them. I would also like to think about giving some meaning to this, beyond myself. It is a bit of a paradox that running a marathon is so much a personal challenge, but running is also about doing something beyond ourselves.

He left behind a wife and 4 kids.\n\nThis has had a profound impact on me in a lot of different ways: most importantly in working through the sadness of his loss, but also creating in me previously unfelt existential anxieties about death, the possibility of leaving *my* children behind, the unbearable length of infinite non-existence, etc. In other words, some very heavy feelings.\n\nAnd another lingering effect, which might seem unimportant and superficial when juxtaposed against these much bigger issues, but that is nonetheless impacting my life, is the effect it's having on my running.  \n\nMy friend was a far better, more conditioned athlete than I could ever hope to be, and there's this sense in me that says \"Well if *he* could die during a workout, maybe I can drop dead at any moment.\"  And these intrusive thoughts have been popping up *during* my runs: \"What if he pushed too hard and that's why he died? Better take it easy.\" or \"Is orphaning your kids worth taking on that hill at full sprint?\"  Irrational, to be sure. But there they are.\n\nNow, I'm not out there trying to win every race for my age group. My running goals are health, stress-relief, and the overall good mental vibes and sense of both purpose and accomplishment that come after pursuing or setting a new PR, getting out there when you wanted to sit on the sofa all day, or finishing a run when your brain tries every trick in the book to convince you to stop. \n Well my brain has been winning those battles a lot more thanks to this new trick it has in its arsenal, and it's really impacting mmy joy for running at a deep level.\n\nHas anybody ever had to deal with something like this?  If so, was it something that went away gradually on its own - a \"time heals all wounds\" type of thing?  Was there a mantra or something you came up with to keep those intrusive thoughts away?

But I've wondered whether dropping another 20lbs could help towards resolving these and reducing the risk of future injuries. \n\nI have a weight lifting background and there's the obvious drawback of losing muscle if I were to drop further weight, but I think I want to focus on running going forward.\n\nI appreciate there are studies out there which say heavier runners don't necessarily suffer more injuries, but I've read the odd comment here and there which, anecdotally, suggests otherwise.\n\nAny and all thoughts would be appreciated.\n\nEdit: A massive thank you to all those who commented!","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1675359606.0},{"title":"Achievements for Friday, February 03, 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/10sbp4p\/achievements_for_friday_february_03_2023\/","text":"Hey runners, it's another day and it is time to post your accomplishments you'd like to share - big or small.\n\nNote: No need to preface YOUR accomplishments with something like, \"this may not be an accomplishment to most of you...\".

Marathon this month and missed the BQ (sub-3:00 hr) mark by 18:XX minutes unfortunately. This of course was a much larger margin than expected. I had a long and very solid training cycle leading up to it (topping around just over 50+ miles per week in the peak) with a lot of speed, threshold, and MP work layered in. The race wasn't my best effort or close to what I think my best possible day was, and I wasn't sticking on pace with where a lot of my long goal MP workout runs landed leading up to it in training. I physically felt strong through it all but I think a lot of it was due to my pace slowing quite a bit due to the late morning heat \/ humidity in the late miles of the race, and just my overall mentality during it. I passed a lot of people who either bonked or were cooked from the heat during the last 8 miles of it. With that, I'm also aware my fitness \/ endurance also needs overall continual improvement to get to that sub-3 mark of course.\n\nNonetheless, I am looking for some major redemption through another hard training cycle set to begin end of Feb \/ March 1st, after some weeks of recovery through now and early\/mid February.\n\nI'd like for this to be a BQ friendly course (mostly flat) somewhere that is in much cooler and in more bearable conditions this time around. I think that aspect coupled with another 12-14 week cycle should hopefully get me there, or very very close at least this time around. If I don't hit it again, then I focus on the next one come Fall (which I'll be doing regardless).\n\nI'd also like for this to be a fairly sizable race in a cool destination location or a big city to at least keep a solid larger race feel to it.\n\nWas looking at the Cleveland Marathon (May 21st) or the Buffalo Marathon (May 28th). Anyone who has ran either (or both) could shed a little light on the two? Also would love to hear anyone else's other recommendations!

One of the influencers that I follow is Matt Choi. Recently, Matt ran the Houston Marathon and was discovered by MarathonInvestigation.com, as well as people who were trying to follow him on the Houston Marathon race tracker, that he was actually wearing another person\u2019s bid.\nSee: [https:\/\/www.marathoninvestigation.com\/2023\/01\/instagram-influencer-runs-sub-30000-houston-marathon-wearing-someone-elses-bib.html](https:\/\/www.marathoninvestigation.com\/2023\/01\/instagram-influencer-runs-sub-30000-houston-marathon-wearing-someone-elses-bib.html)\n\nHe claimed that he had forgot to sign up for the Houston Marathon before the registration cut off, and that he started asking around a few weeks prior to the race if anyone had an extra bib. Fortunately for him, one of his friends had been injured shortly before the race, and he was thus able to use his bib.\n\nI was wondering what everyone\u2019s opinion(s) on this situation is. On one hand, Matt claims that he didn\u2019t realize wearing someone else\u2019s bib was a problem, and that he now realizes where the criticism levied against him is coming from. And for the record, he seems to be very understanding of his mistake and has publicly vowed multiple times that he has learned from this situation and will be better in the future.\n\nOn the other hand, as many people have pointed out, Matt should be an experience enough runner to realize that this thing shouldn\u2019t be allowed to fly. He has already ran a handful of marathons, and although he has only been in the running game for a couple of years, this seems like a pretty base level running etiquette principle. \n\nI definitely have mixed opinions on this. On one hand, if he wanted to get up to nefarious activities like being a bib mule for his friend, I don\u2019t think he would be stupid enough to not realize that he would be caught, given his high profile and influencer status. On the other hand, it is weird that his bib is partially tucked into his running shorts, seeming to try to evade photo capture. Ultimately, if he did truly forget to sign up for the marathon, I don\u2019t envy his position. Either he doesn\u2019t run it, comes clean that he forgot to sign up, and then is perceived to be lazy and to have misled his audience, or tries to make up for it like this and gets labelled as unethical and entitled.\n\nUpdate: I didn\u2019t expect that this post would generate this much passionate discussion! I would also like to make it clear that Choi did RUN A BQ TIME in this race. If he was a nobody and not an influencer under the watch of a large audience it is likely that this would have slipped completely under the radar.","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1675046955.0},{"title":"My attempt at making the Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 work for me","author":"kelvindegrees","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/10oovi7\/my_attempt_at_making_the_samsung_galaxy_watch_5\/","text":"I needed a watch for running.  It needed to track and display the usual heart rate, pace, distance, etc\u2026\n\nAfter looking at Garmin and Polar\u2019s offerings, I actually decided to go with the Samsung Galaxy Watch5 for its Wear OS and integration with many apps in the Android ecosystem.  I was also sold by its cell connectivity and imagined myself wearing just the watch while leaving my phone at home on runs and bike rides.\n\nWell, here is a review of all the running apps that I tried on the watch.\n\nNike Run \u2013 Doesn\u2019t have a Wear OS version.\n\nSamsung Fit \u2013 This had the best in-workout displays.  You get two, [customizable displays](https:\/\/imgur.com\/VIJQ04H) (you can have up to 8 pieces of information plus heart rate displayed at once), plus a [heart rate zone screen](https:\/\/imgur.com\/D9iFI9b), plus an [asymmetry screen](https:\/\/imgur.com\/sfZvIFi).  Unfortunately this would not work with my Polar H10 heart rate monitor.  There is no option to connect to any external device or accessory, it works solely with the watch\u2019s built-in optical heart rate monitor.  Most other apps connected easily to my Polar H10.  More surprisingly, even when going into the watch\u2019s Bluetooth settings, it would detect the Polar H10; I know the watch was able to connect to it over Bluetooth since other apps explicitly showed they were connected over Bluetooth, it\u2019s as if the watch\u2019s OS was refusing to display the H10 Bluetooth device.  This was completely unacceptable and a hard deal breaker for me.  Additionally, the Samsun Health app is very minimalist, and especially with workouts it doesn\u2019t offer a lot of long-term tracking information, though the per-activity display is not bad.\n\nAdidas Running (formerly Runtastic) \u2013 This connected to my Polar H10 heart rate monitor without issue.  Unfortunately the in-workout displays were very minimal.  You get a [single screen](https:\/\/imgur.com\/HLatQ2L) with 3 pieces of information, plus the time, you can change what\u2019s displayed in each section.  Being unable to display more than 3 pieces at once meant as a workaround I would go into the [menu](https:\/\/imgur.com\/Z1ptjQz) to edit the displays in order to read the other metrics, this was less than ideal but did work.  There is no heart rate zone monitoring or coaching.  One thing I noticed was that when I compared two runs on Adidas Running, one recorded with my phone and another with my watch, the heart rate in the watch run looked much lower resolution, like it had been smoothed; this was with the Polar H10.  This was very disappointing considering my wife uses Adidas Running on her Apple Watch and it\u2019s a completely different experience, with nice non-numeric visual indicators of heart rate zone and audio coaching.\n\nStrava \u2013 I did not see any way to connect to my Polar H10 heart rate monitor.  The in-workout displays here were surprisingly the worst of all the apps I tested.  You get [one screen](https:\/\/imgur.com\/1rSX1UL) with 4 metrics each of varying size, wasting a lot of screen real estate.  You get a second pseudo-screen whose sole purpose is to pause and finish the workout.\n\nGoogle Fit \u2013 This connected to my Polar H10 heart rate monitor without issue.  The displays here were very minimal as well.  You get two [pre-made displays](https:\/\/imgur.com\/coDFV2j), each showing 3 metrics, where only the middle metric can be changed and unlike other apps where you can choose from a list of metrics to display it simply cycles through its whole list.  I didn\u2019t test this out on a run, I only looked at this app while I was trying to see if there were any that matched my wife\u2019s Apple Watch\u2019s.\n\nRunkeeper \u2013 The pause\/finish menu is accessed by swiping down from the top of the screen.  That\u2019s so funny because the watch\u2019s own menu is accessed by swiping down from the top of the screen!  This makes it impossible to access the app\u2019s manu.  I didn\u2019t get far enough to try to connect to my Polar H10 since I couldn\u2019t find a settings menu, maybe it was further up in that menu that you access by swiping down from the top of the screen?  Runkeeper is unusable on Wear OS.  I did take some screenshots of the displays though ([1](https:\/\/imgur.com\/azANzRl), [2](https:\/\/imgur.com\/ASLvoMq), [3](https:\/\/imgur.com\/tM6Bvbq)).  You get 3 pre-made displays, they weren\u2019t customizable which is sad but they seemed functional.\n\nThis has all been very disappointing and I have returned the watch.  I really am shocked at how little attention the big apps have paid to the Wear OS platform, especially when their Apple Watch versions are so good.","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1675041989.0},{"title":"Virtual Partner Apple Watch","author":"Careless-Nose-42","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/10p3iam\/virtual_partner_apple_watch\/","text":"Are there any good running apps for the Apple watch that do virtual partner similar to the Garmin Forerunner series?\n\nI tried the pacer mode on workouts and it feels all over the place - I'm used to a reasonably reactive display of xx seconds up\/down rather than workouts which seemed to bounce from -10 to +10 waay too quickly for me to be confident that I was on-pace..","upvote_ratio":0.81,"created_utc":1675087994.0},{"title":"Training Plan Advice","author":"krispechiken927","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/10oe9ja\/training_plan_advice\/","text":"Is there an appreciable difference in working out everyday vs doing two workouts in one day?\n\nI found a training plan I feel I can manage, which prescribes running 4x a week and doing cross training\/strength 2x a week.

First time posting here hoping I don't post anything against the rules...  \n\n\nAbout Me:\n\nMy name is Richard Williams.  I am 30 years old and will be running across America coming up in March.  This has always been a dream of mine since I was pretty young and I finally have some time before going back to school to do it.  I ran D1 in college as predominantly an 800m guy, although I was pretty average.  Since graduating I have slowly gotten more and more into distance running over the years and I am excited to finally have a chance to do something truly insane. \n\nAbout the Run:\n\nI plan to start mid-march and run diagonally across America from Miami to Seattle.  The goal is to run somewhere between 35-40 miles a day (very slowly obviously) with about 20 rest days.  Hopefully finishing in about 100 days of running and 120 days total.  I have an RV that I am going to stay in and a partner to drive it for me.  I will hopefully be visiting several national parks along the way and documenting every bit of the journey that I can. (I will be documenting all of it on my YouTube channel if you want to follow along but I do not think I am allowed to post the link here. You can check my profile for the link if you want to follow along on my trip. )   \n\n\nWhy am I posting? \n\nI am posting mostly to start a discussion on how realistic it is to complete a journey like this and solicit any advice from the reddit hivemind of runners before I take off on my trip.  Major questions I have are:\n\nWhat would you all like to see in updates? Updates on how I am feeling? What am I eating? etc? I plan on posting every couple weeks when I start the journey. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice for something like this and what I should do to prepare beforehand? \n\nWhat kind of questions do you all have for me so I can learn to post something more informative on my last post before I start the run?\n\nIf you all happen to watch along on my social media, please send me any tips or advice on what you would like to see in future videos or what you think I could do better to document this endeavor.  I am mostly posting it and documenting it for my family and friends and eventual children(also its fun to learn how to edit and such) but if anyone else gets some joy out of it I would love that too! Mostly I am just looking for some support from my reddit brethren.   \n\n\nTL:DR; I am going to run across the country in 100 days and am looking for any type of discussion or advice about it! \n\nThanks for reading.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1674854421.0},{"title":"App that creates gps route.","author":"Jonny_5_alive","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/10nrrvn\/app_that_creates_gps_route\/","text":"I\u2019m looking for an app where I can upload a simple outlined drawing (ie: heart) and it will automatically draw the gps route using the streets and area where I\u2019m currently located.","upvote_ratio":0.57,"created_utc":1674945702.0},{"title":"Buffalo Marathon","author":"Best-Huckleberry-102","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/10n69ww\/buffalo_marathon\/","text":"How is this Marathon?

The theory behind this seems to be that the fulcrum during push-off is then at the very top of the foot\/shoe (before the toes), which, according to the lever rule, results in more drag force at the other side (achilles\/calves).\n\nI am wondering about your thoughts on this?","upvote_ratio":0.78,"created_utc":1674718480.0},{"title":"Official Q&A for Thursday, January 26, 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/10lk03h\/official_qa_for_thursday_january_26_2023\/","text":"With over 2,300,000 subscribers, there are a lot of posts that come in everyday that are often repeats of questions previously asked or covered in the FAQ.\n\nWith that in mind, this post can be a place for any questions (especially those that may not deserve their own thread).

I ran casually through HS relaying local marathons with some XC guys, but was mostly a basketball player. Picked up triathlon and running in college to lose weight. Burned out right before a 70.3 in 2013. I hadn't run since then. I decided after slogging through a miserable 10k in Dec 2021 that I would take running seriously and start working with a coach. Highly recommend!   \n\n\nI had been working up towards this particular race all year. I spent most of 2022 actually building 5k speed, where I saw my PR go from 25:08 -> 22:48 from April '22 to November '22. I was around 25MPW for most of the year, but built up to \\~40MPW from October '22 to race day. My typical training week was running 5x\/week - 2 easy mile days (some Z2, some strict Z1 recovery with strides), 2 speed days (hill reps, 200\/400\/800\/1600 repeats, tempos) and 1 long run, along with 1 easy spin recovery day on the stationary bike. I actually had my longest run in this block come in at \\~18 miles, which took me nearly three hours to complete. I didn't understand why I needed to be running 15-18 milers consistently in late November\/December at the time, but looking back on it, being able to be on my feet for significantly longer than the race required me to was super beneficial for the race itself. I've always run HMs just to finish, so the distance itself was historically somewhat daunting for me. Not this time around. I think I ended up logging a little over 1,100 miles in 2022 running. My strava doesn't really have all my workouts uploaded, I use TP with my coach.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI started to notice that my pacing was getting significantly faster around mid-November. The 22:48 5k I posted was actually just a progression run, with the first mile planned and executed at 8:05. I am 100% confident I have sub22 in my legs as it stands now, probably mid-21. The last few tempo runs were supposed to be around 8:30\/mi, but they were coming out more like 7:45\/mi at same effort. I knew leading up to the race that I was in great shape. My coach wanted to pace the race somewhat conservatively, knowing that I had a few races where I went out too fast and finished weak, so he wanted to target around 1:47. I knew in my gut that I could probably hang with the 1:45 pace group, and just system check every 5k, so that was the plan. It was risky, but what did I have to lose?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\### Pre-race\n\nI am not local to Austin, TX, so I decided to get into town a few days early. I have 3 small kids under 4, so it takes them a day or so to adjust to not sleeping in their room. We drove in Friday afternoon. I also had been having some less-than-pleasant issues with needing to poop on long runs (medically related unfortunately) - this is something I did a lot of experimenting with in regard to nutrition intake and timing around long runs. I decided this race I'd attempt to do more loading T-3, and T-2 from race day, and just keep it a bit lighter the day before the race. That being said, we hit up Olive Garden (tradition prerace since HS!) on Friday and I ate like a dumpster.   \n\n\nSaturday I did a simple shakeout run with some strides and felt good. Went to packet pickup - can't recommend this race enough, they really had it together at the expo. I was in and out in less than 10 minutes. Ate a lighter meal around 4p, and I was done eating around 5. I somehow magically got to bed at 8:30p. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\### Race\n\nUp at 4a, chugged cold brew, water and inhaled a PB bagel. Spent the next few hours taking care of business and getting into a good mental mindset. This was not my first HM but was the first HM I've ever \\*raced\\* in a sense, so I was not sure what to expect. That being said, I was able to poop like three times before I left for the starting line. That had me feeling confident, because it was a huge fear of mine that I would execute a great race only to be brown-walled by nature. Got to the start line, and the weather was actually a bit cold! Which is great! I spent all of 2022 racing in 70F+, 90%+ humidity, so it was so nice to have a race where I could actually breathe and wasn't drenched in sweat after warmups.   \n\n\nBecause I decided to stick with a pace that was slightly faster than previously agreed upon, I decided to latch onto the 1:45 pacers and assess how I was feeling every 5k.   \n\n\nFirst 5k: The Plan was to back off if HR was too high into Z3. That first 5k came off super easy, HR in control. By the way, shoutout to the 1:45 pacers during this race, super motivating guys, and they really cared about how people were doing. Called out water stations, restrooms, potholes, curbs..  really great guys! I didn't even get to thank them personally :( If y'all are on runnit - thank you so much!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n10k: Okay, still nice and easy. Pretty flat section here but a few baby hills. HR in control, kind of redlining Z3 but low Z4. Ate some honey stinger chews around mile 5. Alternated water and Nuun at every aid station. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n15k: Okay, still fine. HR spiked a few times up hills but I didn\u2019t back off them and just stuck with pacers. Still felt good and HR recovered nicely on downhills. Mile 10 rolls around and I just said \u201cyou\u2019re holding back. Take mile 10 to open and see how you feel\u201d. So, I ate another round of honey stinger chews and sent it. And I kind of winced expecting it to start to be painful. Except it never got hard.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMile 12: this is the part through UT\u2019s campus, and as soon as I saw the mile marker I glanced and my watch and knew I could basically jog into a sub1:45. Cried on and off the \\*entire rest of the race\\* LOL. There is something really special about the feeling of accomplishment with distance running. You can't really be told it, you have to live it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEnd: Just opened up into psycho pace. I felt my form as terrible at this point but I was really flying and the fact that I had some left in the tank for a kick was so overwhelming. All those hard speed workouts, all those shitty long cold runs, every nighttime run where I didn\u2019t see a single soul\u2026 all worth it. I looked up at the clock and saw 1:43:xx, knew I was guntime +0:30, and knew that I had crushed my STRETCH goal in a big way. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\### Post-race\n\nI have a habit of puking at the end of races, but that was not an issue here. Caught my breath, grabbed my medal and a blanket. Still was around 40ish outside, which is cold to us Texans. I was extremely impressed with how streamlined and not a clusterfuck the finish line was - hats off to race organizers. I found my family and they had parked literally right next to the finish line. Super easy exit - that's underappreciated I feel! I highly recommend this race. Great course. The hills are negligible, but I do spend most of the year racing in the hill country - like 5ks with 300+ ft of gain, so these hills were nothing in comparison. I didn't feel like there was a real climb- there is some conflicting info on the internet about this, from past runners, but let me tell you - while the race isn't strictly downhill, it's very much a downhill feeling.  \n\n\nAfter some reflection, I really feel like I had more in the tank! I probably could\u2019ve hung through with 1:40 pacers but likely would\u2019ve suffered through a lot of it. I\u2019m super proud of this performance. Sub90 is my long-term goal and is not as far off as I thought. I\u2019m more pumped than ever to get back to work and crush some more goals. I'll likely spend the majority of the spring and summer getting down to hopefully sub20 5k, and then start building towards running this race again in 2024, and hopefully getting to that sub90!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMade with a new \\[race report generator\\]([http:\/\/sfdavis.com\/racereports\/](http:\/\/sfdavis.com\/racereports\/)) created by \/u\/herumph.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1674581345.0},{"title":"Official Q&A for Wednesday, January 25, 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/10kqmeb\/official_qa_for_wednesday_january_25_2023\/","text":"With over 2,300,000 subscribers, there are a lot of posts that come in everyday that are often repeats of questions previously asked or covered in the FAQ.\n\nWith that in mind, this post can be a place for any questions (especially those that may not deserve their own thread).

She is targeted to run a season best of 5:10 for the 1600m this year. No guarantees of course but a couple of experienced coaches have said they see that being a strong possibility. She runs a 5:22 now in the off season. She currently runs in a pretty competitive district in California where many top girls run sub 5:00 by their senior year. \n\nFor family reasons, we are moving to Seattle this summer so my daughter will have to change schools. She is applying to a small private school but is also considering the local public school where our house is. She\u2019s likely to be accepted into the private school.\n\nHere\u2019s the issue: the running programs at both are mediocre. She would have the fastest time by far at both schools. The private school does decently in the preps\/small schools league all the way to state. But it doesn\u2019t have a track and it\u2019s of course very small. The public school team, while very large, has not qualified for districts, let alone state in the recent past that I\u2019ve seen.\n\nI\u2019ve looked up the coaches at both schools. The public school coach has no obvious social media presence so I can\u2019t find out her background besides the fact that her daughters ran on the team a couple years back. The private school\u2019s coach is a young man who I can see on athletic.net ran a 4:38 1600 in high school 10 years ago, was on the track roster for a CalState school but doesn\u2019t seem to have competed. He now has a day job in marketing. I figure this is probably pretty typical for most high school programs that coaches aren\u2019t full time. My daughter is very worried about her future training as she\u2019ll be leaving not only the competition of our current area but also the quality of coaching she\u2019s accustomed to (a couple of her coaches are ex-D1 distance runners and one was an Olympic qualifier). \n\nMy daughter is a very compliant athlete and is a coach\u2019s dream as she always does exactly what she\u2019s told down to the strength training and nutrition. Neither my husband nor I ran at a high level so we don\u2019t have a feel for this. Does the school matter at this point to allow her to reach her stretch goal of a 4:45 1600 by junior\/senior year? Do we look into private coaching and is that even appreciated by HS coaches? I played tennis in high school and it was accepted that you got your training at a club so you typically would negotiate with the HS coach to train outside but not so much so you would lose eligibility. If outside training for our daughter is something we should consider, how do we find one that\u2019s even good? Junior running clubs are iffy I\u2019ve found\u2014some great, others not, often shutter their doors. Would the UW coaches give us advice or is that not allowed under NCAA rules?\n\nAny advice?","upvote_ratio":0.74,"created_utc":1674588302.0},{"title":"Super Moronic Monday - Your Weekly Tuesday Stupid Questions Thread","author":"Percinho","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/10k4upo\/super_moronic_monday_your_weekly_tuesday_stupid\/","text":"Back once again for everything you wanted to know about running but were afraid to ask.\n\nRules of the Road:\n\nThis is inspired by eric_twinge's fine work in \/r\/fitness.\n\nUpvote either good or stupid questions.\n\nSort questions by new so that they get some love.\n\nTo the more experienced runnitors, if something is a good question or answer, add it to the FAQ.\n\nPost your question -- stupid or otherwise -- here to get an answer -- stupid or otherwise.

I immediately got over ambitious, started training for the full Austin Marathon and ended up injured and in physical therapy. My running journey since has mostly been a repeat of this train-injury cycle, with some thru hikes (Appalachian Trail and Pacific Crest Trail) mixed in to add to the injury. I ran my second half marathon ever, also the 3M Half, in 2019 to support a friend who was doing it, but I didn\u2019t train adequately and was just riding off of PCT thru hiking fitness. I came in at 2:20 or something like that.\n\nIn September of 2021 I turned 30 and began my most consistent period of running since I started  running almost ten years back. I set three goals for before my 31st birthday. I wanted to run a sub-30 minute 5k, a sub-8 minute mile, and run 500 miles for the year. I had never done any of these before. I\u2019ve never been very fast. That said I ran my first sub-30 minute 5k in training less than a month after my birthday. I think it was mostly mental because I dropped my time a lot after that, running a 26:30 5k just before I turned 31. I also ran a sub 8-minute mile, but ended up short of 500 miles due to COVID slowing me down for a couple of months.\n\nFor 31 I set two new goals. I wanted to run a sub 1-hour 10k and a sub-2 hour half marathon. I signed up for the Salmagundi Trail 10k in October and the 3M Half in January.\n\n### Training\nIn the summer, before I turned 31, I started to train for the Salmagundi. I had never done trail running before, but was drawn to it from my history of hiking. I downloaded a generic training plan from the Run Keeper app, which I\u2019ve been using since 2014. I did most of my long runs on local trails and added in lots of hills. I felt okay going into the race, but I hadn\u2019t done a trail race before and ended up going too slow out the gate, by the time I picked up my pace it was too late. I finished in an agonizing 1:00:14! Still I was okay with it, it was my first trail race and I had no idea how that was going to go. I definitely want to do more trail running in the future!\n\nAfter my 10k I immediately went into training for the 3M. I moved all of my long runs to the road and increased my weekly mileage. I had a few 10k runs in the plan and was able to run them in under an hour. It counts for something I guess. It\u2019s funny that from September of 2021 to September of 2022 I don\u2019t quite make it to 500 miles, but this year I\u2019m well on track. Since my birthday I\u2019ve already run 360 miles! Two weeks before the race I had my last long run, a 13 mile hybrid run with 3 miles warmup at 10:10 - 11:10 pace, 7 miles at my race pace 9:09, and 3 miles cooldown. I added in an extra .1 mile at the end to set a non-race PR of 2:08 something. I felt strong and knew I could definitely run a PR, if not a sub 2 hour race. Then I got sick.\n\n### Pre-race\nYep, two weeks before my big race I got sick. I don\u2019t think it was COVID this time, but it was something respiratory. My wife actually thinks it was just bad allergies, Cedar has been at all time highs lately, but that hasn\u2019t affected me much before and I\u2019ve lived here my whole life. Whatever it was, my running performance dropped considerably. I was tapering now, but even still, my short easy runs just felt awful. After every run I\u2019d go into these crazy coughing spells. I dropped two runs off my schedule and I cut my final long run from an easy 10 miles to 6.5. I decided it was best to taper hard and hopefully heal. The day before the race I ran 3 miles and afterwards I started coughing so hard I threw up! I was very disappointed and I seriously considered not even showing up to the race, but my wife convinced me to show up on the start line and just see what happens. Worst case I\u2019d walk it, but I\u2019d finish. I\u2019d already ran a PR in training just two weeks back. My wife gave me her inhaler which I packed in my vest, just in case.\n\n### Race\nBy the time I got done with my pre-race port-a-potty visit, the crowd in the chute was thick. I figured I wasn\u2019t going to be able to run my goal pace anyways and didn\u2019t try to push up to the 2 hour pacers as I\u2019d originally planned. I settled in near the 2:15 pacers and walked with the crowd to the start. The clock was somewhere at 3 or 4 minutes when I went through the start. You\u2019d think I\u2019d have noted the exact time, but since I had mentally given up on my goal already I barely even looked at it or my watch and let myself just fall into whatever pace felt good. I started passing people left and right, I felt alright, \u201cmaybe I can do this\u201d I thought to myself and I picked up the pace, still not looking at my watch.\n\nAlmost 5k in I passed the 2:10 pacers. I felt alright. I\u2019d gone further than my three mile training run the day before. The one that made me throw up from coughing too hard. The coughing always seemed to be worst after the I stopped running, so that\u2019s all I needed to do now, just not stop. When I passed the 5k clock, I realized I\u2019d actually been running above my target pace for sub 2 hours! I slowed a tiny bit.\n\nIn my training runs I\u2019d gotten used to carrying my own water in my running vest so that\u2019s what I did on the race. I had two .75 liter soft bottles filled with electrolyte mix. I packed two GU gels also. In my training I\u2019d just used granola bars or snickers, whatever I had around the house, but I had splurged for a few gels at the packet pickup. I didn\u2019t really have a coherent calorie plan, just figured I\u2019d eat them when it felt like I need them. The race also provided GUs at mile 7 and I\u2019m glad they did! I had one of my own at mile 4, there\u2019s at 7 and the last of mine at around mile 11. Turns out GUs are way easier to eat than snickers, especially when breathing is an issue. I\u2019m glad I had them.\n\nSeveral times during the race I started to cough, but I found I could keep it at bay by taking short shallow breaths. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not optimal not being allowed to breathe deeply, but it worked. I kept the inhaler as a backup because the one time I used it in training my performance tanked.\n\nAt around mile 10 I caught up with the 2:05 pacers. I knew they went through the start gate a little before me so if I stuck with them I was definitely on track to beat my 2:08 PR from my training run! I was tempted to hang with them, but I was still moving slightly faster then their pace, and felt alright. I pushed on.\n\nThe last couple of miles my legs began to hurt. My calves and my quads. I was pleasantly surprised because I figured my muscles were much better prepared than my lungs in their current state. I pushed it hard from the university, at about mile 11 or so, to the finish line. There was a minor annoyance as a man with a loud speaker was giving encouragement about, \u201cjust one mile left\u201d, about a third of a mile before the mile 12 marker.\n\nIn past races I\u2019ve always had enough energy left to sprint the last little bit to the finish line, but I had already been pushing it for a couple of miles. When I saw the finish I picked up the pace as best I could, but I didn\u2019t go much faster. Right as I got to the end I had a thought, \u201cI\u2019m going to be okay with my time no matter what because I know I didn\u2019t leave anything out there. I couldn\u2019t have run any harder today. I\u2019m happy\u201d. I saw the race clock at 2:04 something, but didn\u2019t take exact note of when I started so I don\u2019t know my time yet.\n\n### Post-race\nI grabbed my medal and finisher goodie packet and made a bee-line past the volunteers in the finish chute afraid I might start coughing so hard I\u2019d throw up. I went up a little ways to a garden on the state capitol grounds and stood there coughing. My light breathing technique I used on the course helped some and I finally allowed myself to use the inhaler. Ultimately, I didn\u2019t throw up which was good. A friend who had been following me on the tracker texted me my time, 2:00:41! I was okay with those 41 seconds considering I almost didn\u2019t even start and was afraid I\u2019d have to walk to the finish at some point. I met up with my sister who had also ran the race and my wife who had come out to support us and we celebrated some.\n\nNow I\u2019m resting, I\u2019m sore and I\u2019m a coughy mess. I figure if this coughing doesn\u2019t go away too soon I\u2019ll go to a doctor. The last two times I did a half marathon, each time, I thought that would be my last. This time I\u2019m already looking forward to my next and beyond, I\u2019ve got 41 seconds to beat! Hopefully I\u2019ll be at my top shape on race day!\n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http:\/\/sfdavis.com\/racereports\/) created by \/u\/herumph.","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1674573772.0},{"title":"Run Nutrition Tuesday","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/10jxodj\/run_nutrition_tuesday\/","text":"**Rules of the Road**\n\n1)  Anyone is welcome to participate and share your ideas, plans, diet, and nutrition plans.\n\n2)  Promote good discussion.

I've run a few half marathons and finally, running friends talked me into a marathon. I built from 30 miles\/week up to 50 at the end of a 16-week plan, which was my highest mileage week ever. I did battle runners knee and some heel pain near the end, so my next-to-last week I dropped to around 30 miles before finishing strong the final week. An 18 mile run was my longest training run, done about one minute slower per mile than my race pace. One week my long run would be easier miles, the next week I ran 2-3 warmup miles, then a gradually increasing number of marathon pace miles, maxing out at 13 race pace miles within a 17 mile run as my final long run before a two week taper. I felt strong and most of the \"marathon pace' miles were run 20-30 seconds faster pace than I actually intended for race pace. During the taper my legs still felt tired, I thought the taper would be more refreshing somehow lol. I didn't get any noticeable jolt of energy but I did start to feel fresher and better the final few days before the race. \n\n\n**Pre-race**\n\nA group of running team friends drove 8 hours to Houston two days ahead of the race. I slept poorly for 3 nights leading up to the race, which surely didn't help me. Nerves got me for sure the final night, and I tossed and turned, waking up with a mild headache that soon went away, thankfully. I ate steel-cut oatmeal with maple syrup 2.5 hours before race time with a bit of coffee in hopes of getting a bm going. We jogged a light 15-min warmup then walked to the convention center. The race venue was amazing, Houston was incredible. Hundreds of bathrooms but still huge lines and we were nervous but got in line with 30 min. until our corral was called. The line moved quickly and I had a successful bathroom break but our time was short. Five us us had to jog probably close to half a mile to reach corral A, which we had submitted qualifying times in order to be in. We just made it before closing - whew!\n\n\n**Race**\n\nMassive and overwhelming is the only way to describe the size of this race, by far the largest event I'd ever participated in. My friends and I found our pace slot and stayed close to the 3:25 pacer during the final ten minutes until everyone squeezed toward the start line and the gun went off. It then took about three minutes for us to finally reach the line, begin jogging, and then we were off. Everyone in the first corral seemed to cue pretty well, so it was nice to be running at pace right way, I didn't dodge too much traffic despite it being very congested. A friend and I tucked in beside the 3:25 pacer, Jon, who was extremely helpful and offering tips and course information all the way. I took a UCAN Edge gel just before the race.\n\nHouston and the crowds were amazing - so much energy on the course! I felt strong through the half and my heart rate had settled around 140-145, zone 3 for me, which was encouraging. I ate Crank sports e-Gels about every 45 minutes, which I had also used on long training runs. Because the e-Gels have electrolytes and sodium, I took only water at the stops, which I might change in hindsight \u2013 I wonder if rotating in some Gatorade might have helped me late. For my third gel I took a UCAN Edge pineapple because they are not so sweet. \n\nEven through 18 miles I felt like I would be able to surge a bit late and maybe pad the BQ time a bit, but I was about to be humbled by the marathon, lol. I stayed with the pace group through mile 22 before I started struggling to keep up. I pushed to close about a 15 meter gap and rejoin them once, and that took it out of me. Half a mile later I fell off, and by mile 23 watched them pull away, a group down to about 10 from maybe 40 we started with.  \n\nI knew the BQ was slipping away but told myself just to not completely blow up, finish strong and then retire from marathons forever. :) The course was mostly flat but a handful of small, rolling hills in the final 5k were tough. I stopped to walk for 5-10 seconds at a couple of water stations and again going up a few hills. This was it, I had heard about the wall and I had found it! Every cell in my body wanted to just lay down and rest. Inside the final mile, my left quad began spasms and I was afraid it might lock entirely. I did a full squat to stretch it out and was very thankful to be able to run the final half mile to the finish. I finished in 3:28:25, my Garmin showing 26.5 for the race, despite doing my best to run tangents in the crowd. \n\n\n**Post-race**\n\nI felt really wiped out for about 30 minutes after the race. My legs felt entirely beat up, I lost my voice a bit, and did not feel like eating at all. Finally after just moving slow and resting, I had some chocolate milk and water and felt better. Caught up with some of my team and walked around the venue a bit before heading to our car. I rolled and stretched as much as possible that night, and we all jogged a painful and slow 1.5 miles the next morning before our return road trip, which I think was really helpful. Despite moving slowly the next few days, my recovery wasn't as bad as I anticipated. My knees and quads were sore in ways I've never felt before, but I took a few days off and was able to go for several easy 5k recovery jogs later in the week. \n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nI quit marathons forever multiple times during the final 5k and the rest of race day, then by Monday afternoon on the drive home I was already thinking about how I might beat the wall next time. Not sure if I will do it \u2013 the training grind and battling my legs to avoid niggles and injuries was not my favorite thing, but who knows. Maybe there will be another shot at a BQ. \n\nI did go against all the advice and tried to race hard my first marathon. I knew the Boston time was within my reach \u2013 wasn't sure if I could get there, but decided to go for it. I felt confident but nervous, and in the end my nerves were well founded. The BQ time is no joke! My respect is even stronger for runners who can hit this mark, wow. \n\nIn hindsight, I would probably do less of a warmup and go slower the first few miles of the race, using that as warmup. Also would experiment with Gatorade in addition to water and gels. \n\nIf you read all this, thanks - you are a trooper lol.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1674420618.0},{"title":"Miscellaneous Monday Chit-Chat","author":"fire_foot","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/10jaxff\/miscellaneous_monday_chitchat\/","text":"Another Monday is upon us, friends!\n\nHow was your weekend?

[forgot to stop my Garmin]\n\n### Training\nThis is my final half before my full in a month! So my training has been very full-marathon based, with my longest run so far of 18 miles. My training pace is all easy and generally around 14ish min\/mile. I do some sort of walk\/run where I walk the uphills about 50% of the times and otherwise run. That's my plan for my full. My full is the Austin marathon so there will be hills ready for me to walk. This is my third half. My first was the Austin half last year where I came in at 2:46.xx and my second was just a month ago at the Decker Challenge where I came in around 2:40.xx. If you don't know the Decker Challenge, it is even more hilly than the Austin Half. I was very much looking forward to a net downhill race! \n\n### Pre-race\nNot a lot pre-race here. I generally have a big burger and fries the night before a race, have some wheetbix in the morning and coffee and off I go. Sadly I couldn't work up to a #2 before this race which really stressed me out, but it didn't seem to cause issues. \n\n### Race\nThis is a super fun and fast course. There were definitely some hills, but there was enough downhill to calm the heartrate back down. I did *not* walk at all during this race. I fueled every 40ish minutes with a GU and ran with a water bladder, so took small sips as I go. In prior races, chugging at water stops made me nauseous, so I bring my own water now. The race is mostly downhill the first 8 or so miles, and you can see that in my paces. Then rolling hills which weren't *too* bad. \n\nOn my prior half and 10 miler, I really fell apart the last two miles. For this race, I focused hard on staying positive. Just telling myself it'd be ok and the finish line would come. I am extremely proud of myself for just chugging along and not letting the negative thoughts get to me. It was also extremely helpful having my parents along the race to cheer me on! They said they even missed me at one because I was just too quick - oops! \n\n### Post-race\nI always forget to stop my dang Garmin. Loves this race's snacks though - some misfit bars and my personal favorite, fruit cups! At the end of my prior half, I had a ton of self doubt about my marathon. After this one, I am more confident. I am really looking forward to the full in a month. My pace will probably be closer to 13-14 min\/mile. No shame in being back of the pack, that's where my favorite people are :) \n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http:\/\/sfdavis.com\/racereports\/) created by \/u\/herumph.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1674414277.0},{"title":"Knee strengthening exercises","author":"_m0rtis","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/10ip3mc\/knee_strengthening_exercises\/","text":"Not asking for medical advice but I think I may need to strengthen my knee muscles can anyone recommend some exercises please?\n\nJust ran two 5k in two days and noticing a feeling of weakness maybe a feeling of something pulled.\n\nSomething similar happened a couple of years ago and I stopped for a while but I'm thinking I may need to strengthen the area.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1674408788.0},{"title":"How would you describe your experience of undie runs (or any costume-themed runs)?","author":"throwawaysnrn","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/10im2r5\/how_would_you_describe_your_experience_of_undie\/","text":"It's been on my bucket list for years:\n\nhttps:\/\/cupids.org\/2023-registration\/\n\nI am finally considering checking this box off.

It has the ability to use a training plan so I thought I'd give it a go. Couple of questions for anyone who has completed these plans.\n\nI randomly picked an intermediate half marathon plan that had a goal finish time of 3 minutes faster than previous ones. I've run many half marathons. So the distance is definitely not what I'm training for. More the speed \n\nI'm curious though as I'm in week 6 and it includes an almost 18km LSD.  Any other training plan I've done hasn't reached that distance til the end of the plan.  Is this pretty normal for these plans? If so what's the reasoning?\n\nNext question. I either do long runs straight through or sometimes do run\/walk. Really depends on the day and if I stop to take pictures lol. Why does the plan include scheduled walk breaks in the pace runs, and speed training but not the long runs.\n\nAppreciate any input :)","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1674352931.0},{"title":"Using Tailwind as fuel for marathon","author":"nadi755","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/10hw8qk\/using_tailwind_as_fuel_for_marathon\/","text":"I\u2019ve never used a gel for fueling.

I thought some people in here would be interested so might as well share it. To start, a quick FAQ:\n\n- Should I make this? No, probably not. The most important electrolyte in sport is sodium by far, so any drink with the appropriate amount of sodium would be fine. The others electrolyte are of dubious benefit, though not harmful, and are present in other sports drinks so they are in mine.\n\n- When should I drink this? Probably never. Most diets contain too many refined carbs and too much sodium. Supplementing these is only a good idea during a very long endurance workout, like a 90+ min run. Most races already provide sport drink but you could use it there. \n\n- What is isotonic? It means the sodium and sugar concentration match those of the fluids in your body, which is not terribly important but is a nice idea and a good starting point.\n- What are these weird quantities? You really need a gram scale to make something like this. If you don't have one, don't bother and just stick with NaCl and sugar only. If your gram scale is not very accurate, make a larger batch at once. \n\nSo, to make this recipe, I took AA drink isotonic as a starting point and slightly adjusted some quantities to match other typical sports drinks. A common theme is chloride concentration is kept fairly low, so we can't just add all chloride salts and need to be a bit more creative. I also tried to use common household ingredients that I actually have, and the drink contains excess citric acid to make it ~ pH = 4.0 and palatable. \n\nHere's the recipe, I hope I did all calculations correctly, if you or I mess up and eat 20 g of salt in one go that's your own risk.\n\nAmounts are for a mix for 1 L of water. \n\n- 0.45 g LoSalt (66% KCl, 33% NaCl)\n- 0.19 g NaCl\n- 0.99 g sodium bicarb (= baking soda)\n- 0.67 g calcium lactate \n- 0.72 g magnesium citrate\n- 2.82 g citric acid\n- 52 g sucrose or a mix of sucrose:maltodextrin\n\nUse a pestle and mortar or blender to thoroughly mix the solids and your mix is complete. Mix in a liter of water when you want to use the drink. \n\nNutrients in 1 L: 200 kcal, 400 mg Na, 150 mg K, 120 mg Ca, 80 mg Mg, 360 mg Chloride.\n\nA few tips:\n\n- Make at least 10x this amount so you can more easily measure these amounts. Add ~55 g of mix to 1 L of water.\n\n- If your 'diet salt' contains 100% KCl, substitute 1\/3 of the amount with NaCl. If it contains only 50% KCl, use 15% less and accept you get less potassium. It's plenty either way. \n- If you don't have Ca lactate or Mg citrate, either leave them out or use supplements. For example, I have 400 mg Mg supplements so I need 1\/5 pill for this recipe to get to 80 mg Mg (note I do NOT use the 0.72 g Mg citrate from the recipe in this case, but instead use the nutrient table). This will make your drink slightly white & cloudy. \n\n- This drink is isotonic and fairly low on fuel. If you want more calories you can add more sugar, but remember you need a larger scoop of powder per liter in that case (e.g. if you use 80 g sugar instead of 50, a scoop is 85 g per liter instead of 55 g). You can also add some flavour, but I think it tastes quite alright on its own.","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1674208578.0},{"title":"It's Photo Friday - let's see your running pictures!","author":"brwalkernc","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/10gxsqr\/its_photo_friday_lets_see_your_running_pictures\/","text":"###**Last week, on Photo Friday:**\n\n\/u\/bobbo2011 grabbed the top spot.\n\n> https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/jtzZXvX.jpg\n> \n> I\u2019ve battled with addiction most of my adult life.

The training for that race was just following the Garmin Training with a time goal of 1:54. \n\nI have been running regularly since the start of 2021 and had completed about ~800kms in 2021 followed by another 1120kms in 2022. Most of it was without any training plan except the HM training. The HM was mostly a step-stone to qualify for TMM since I hadn't run any qualifying races and there was a criteria for the Full Marathon in Mumbai.\n\nAfter the HM, I wasn't sure about running a marathon so close with my measly weekly peak mileage of about 30k and as well almost crashing after the HM mostly due to not eating well around, during and post the race. After a hiatus of about 20 days, I finally made the decision of running the marathon and thus started the \"training\". \n\nI only had about 65 days before the race and all plans specified atleast 18 weeks, about double that. So, I just went out and ran with a target of running longish on the weekend. \nCovered about 33kms weekly in November with the longest run being just under 13km. I had added the race on Garmin and the daily suggestions were being followed now & then atleast for this month.\n\nThe first week of December went along with a weekly mileage of just under 30k and life happened during the second week with plenty of travel allowing me only a single 6km treadmill run in a hotel. \n\nThe last two weeks were all just slow runs totalling up to about 40kms per week completely ignoring the garmin suggestions of running VO2Max or threshold runs. \n\nFor the Jan weeks, I just did regular 5k runs alternatively with no long runs but still covering 30k in the first week and just 10k in the \"recovery\" week leading upto to the race itself.\n\n### Pre-race\nUnfortunately, I had caught the flu just a couple of days before the race and did everything from medication to sauna baths to fight it but the stubborn flu remained, although no fever. \nI flew in a day early to collect the bib, experience the expo but a late flight left me stranded in the airport for most of the day. I was able to get about 4 hours of spotty sleep the night before which weirdly felt refreshing enough.\n\nOne thing I did differently this time than the HM was I ate like an animal the night before and hoped that my usual body clock will keep the food down until after the run. \n\n### Race\nThe start of a race was well organized and we were able to get off right from the finish line without any traffic issues. \nI had planned to hold 6m\/km pace throughout and the plan was going well with my mind going to questions like Why do people find this so hard?\n\nThe route was scenic with an unsually cool weather. I kept availing water and fuel (read chocalates) about every 5k from the well placed support stations and even turned off my music owing to the sponsor cheering stations and the spectators turning up at 6AM for cheering complete strangers. The energy was ecstatic and I felt like I could do this all day (ah, dumb brain on adrenaline).\n\nAbout 16kms in, the 5.6km Sea Link started and it was probably the most beautiful backdrop I have ran through. I took a couple of photos and video called my wife just to share in the moment.\nEcstatic from the scenery, I took off a bit faster than planned until about 22km entering the unknown territory and slowing down to the planned pace. \n\nI held on to the pace until about 29k where I allowed myself a breather by slowing down a bit for the next k, atleast that was the plan. After that, no matter what I tried I just couldn't get back to my pace and kept steadily slowing down hitting the first bong moment at about 34k. Even trying for a speedup, my quads would just lock up and I would have to go even slower. \nI made my peace with the crawl and painfully made my way towards the finish line 1k at a time. \n\nThankfully, this part of the track was lined up with cheery spectators and that is what probably held me away from walking the last 5k or so. \n\nI can't describe the feeling of elation of seeing first the 500m mark and then the finish line. I sprinted (5m\/k - I checked) the last 100m and immediately fought the ensuing cramp at the finish line! \n\n### Post-race\nThe one thing I disliked about this race was the medal collection being a million miles away., instead of having someone awarding it to you just after the finish. I made my way there after some icing on my legs, collected the medal along with the refreshments, basked in the sun enjoying my hardest earned orange drink ever. To my surprise, you get two medals on finishing Mumbai Marathon, the first is for you, the finisher and second, is for your inspiration. \n\nAfterwards, I hobbled away barefoot to my hotel with a promise to come back next time and do better on my goals. :) \n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http:\/\/sfdavis.com\/racereports\/) created by \/u\/herumph.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1674120803.0},{"title":"Weekly Complaints & Confessions Thread","author":"ssk42","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/10g1ybw\/weekly_complaints_confessions_thread\/","text":"How\u2019s your week of running going?

I had made the decision to take control of my fitness and joined a local running club. Despite weighing a daunting 105kg, I was determined to push past my limitations. I registered for a 10k race and with every step, I could feel the burn in my legs and the pounding in my chest. But I pushed on, determined to prove to myself that I was capable of greatness. The finish line was in sight, and I could hear the cheers of the crowd as I crossed it, with a time of 81 minutes, just one minute short of the qualifying time for the Mumbai Marathon.  \n\nBut I wasn't satisfied, I wanted more. Two weeks later, I lined up for another 10k race, the determination in my eyes. I pushed myself to the limit, and as I crossed the finish line, I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw my time: 77 minutes! I had done it, I had improved.   \n\nWith this newfound confidence, I set my sights on the ultimate challenge: a Half Marathon in January. I trained relentlessly, pushing myself further every Sunday as I increased my weekly mileage to 12-15km. But my journey was not without obstacles. A month of my training was disrupted when I contracted a viral\/COVID infection in October. But I refused to let it defeat me. I resumed training in November-End, but due to delayed recovery, I was unable to focus on strength and core training. It's possible that this lack of focus on strength training was my undoing, but I refuse to dwell on it. My journey may have been filled with setbacks, but I am determined to reach my goal, no matter what.\n\n### PRE-RACE \n\nMy fuel intake had been adequate, thanks to the pasta and rice I had consumed in the days leading up to the event. On race morning, I had even managed to choke down some toast with butter, despite my usual struggles with eating first thing in the morning.  \n\nWith a few energy gels tucked into my pockets, I joined a group of 15 fellow runners from my residential complex as we made our way to the starting line. We took a specially arranged metro train to the race location. We still had to walk an additional kilometer to reach the starting line.  \n\nAs I looked around, I could see the sheer scale of the event. There were 60,000 registered runners, with approximately 12-13,000 running the half marathon, just like me. The energy was electric and I could feel the adrenaline pumping through my veins. I was ready to give it my all and push my limits. The race was on!\n\n### RACE \n\nAs the starting gun fired, signaling the beginning of the race, I felt my heart pounding with excitement and nerves. Based on my fitness, weight and training, I had planned to run with the 2:50 HM Pacer, but fate had other plans. He was in section G and myself in F, which meant that I had to race alone. The race flagged off at 5:15am with A, B, C, D, E sections starting one by one. Eventually, our run started at around 5:35am. Compared to Mumbai Standards, it was the coldest morning of the year on 15th January and that could have made things a bit easier.  \n\nAs I began the first 5 kilometers, I was near the last wave, and my plan was to just start easy and keep energy for later. I did this easily as it was a sea of people for the first 2-3 km. So prior to the race I had worked on my pace calculations, I had planned to start accelerating after the incline between 3.5-4.5km on Sea Link Bridge. The views of Mumbai skyline and the bridge itself were mesmerizing. I took photos towards the end of the incline, but then it was time to unleash my full potential.  \n\nKM6-13: This phase was my fastest ever and I completed 10k in 75mins. Fortunately I found the much needed motivation in a hot chick running at pace of ~7. I will be forever grateful to her (and her group) for pushing me to run faster.  \n\nKM14: However, towards the end of 14th KM, blister on my right baby toe burst and felt blood like thingy inside my socks. But I refused to let this stop me. Fortunately, there was a medical station within 500m. I put on some tape and I was on my way to complete the race, pushing through the pain with every step.  \n\nKM15: 15th Kilometer was the most difficult with almost 1.3km of incline. I could barely run with the injured toe, but I refused to give up. I pushed through this phase with grit and determination.  \n\nKM16-18: I had done an 18km run during my training, so my body didn\u2019t give up until 18km. Slow and steady, I reached the 18k mark. But then all hell broke loose!  \n\nKM19-21: 19km onwards, my body had given up. It was a tough mental battle thereon until the finish line. But I was determined not to walk. The crowds lining the street, cheering and pushing me forward with their energy. Consuming Orange with Salt also helped me to push through.  As I crossed the finish line, I felt my body give way to the overwhelming emotions that had been building inside of me. I let out a loud cry of triumph as tears of joy streamed down my face. This was it, the moment I had been working towards for months. The gruelling training, the early morning runs, the countless hours of dedication had all led to this one, glorious moment.  \n\nFINISH LINE: The weight of the accomplishment hit me like a wave, and I couldn't hold back. I had done it, I had pushed past my limits and achieved something I never thought possible. The feeling of triumph was indescribable, and I was filled with a sense of pride and accomplishment. This was a moment I would never forget, a moment that would stay with me forever. I had triumphed over my fears, my doubts, and my limitations, and for that, I was forever grateful.\n\n### WIFEEEEEEY: A few minutes later, My wife completed her first 21k as well. As we hugged each other, emotions of joy and accomplishment mixed as we shared this momentous achievement. The feeling of doing something together was out of this world, one we will always cherish. We hugged each other for a minute, overwhelmed by the emotions of the moment.  We had done it. Together. And nothing could ever take away the sense of accomplishment and pride we felt in that moment.\n\n### POST RACE \n\nAs I hobble along, each step a fiery reminder of the gruelling race I just completed, I can't help but let out a grimace. Not gonna lie, it hurts. A lot. But the pain is a small price to pay for the feeling of accomplishment that comes with crossing the finish line.  Despite the difficulty in walking for couple of days, I'm already looking forward to my next race. The thrill of the competition, the camaraderie of my fellow runners, and the feeling of accomplishment at the finish line are all worth the pain and effort. This is just the beginning of my journey and I'm ready for more challenges, more races, and more triumphs\n\n### REFLECTIONS ON MY RUN \n\nAs I sit down to reflect on my run, I am aware that some may question the significance of my writing this long report as a relatively slow runner. But for me, this run marks the beginning of an incredible journey to improve my fitness. I am driven to improve my pace and stamina with every passing week, and this run serves as a reminder of the progress I am capable of making. I raise my glass to the promise of more fulfilling runs in the future, as I strive to reach my full potential. The feeling of finally reaching the finish line, of pushing past my limits and achieving something I never thought possible, is indescribable.

Once the summer heat ended I started upping the mileage to about 15-18 miles per week. Most of my running was on the weekends where I would try to either do a long run (6-8miles) or speed workout in addition to an easy run. I did one 5K race in the summer and ran a 26:38. \n\nI peaked my mileage about 6-7 weeks out doing 25 miles those weeks. Longest run I did was 10 miles @ 10 min pace. Started to taper down to 12 miles a week 4 weeks out from the half. \n\n**Event:**\n\nMy plan going into the race was to take it easy the first 5K through the biggest hills, cruise through Old Town until about Mile 9, and then push towards the finish. The parts of the race that go through Old Town are great, there's lots of people cheering and it really keeps you going. The water stations are spread out well and you can get electrolytes and energy gels at some. I'd say that the last 5K was the toughest since there isn't much crowd and by then you're pretty tired. The finish on the field of the Rose Bowl is pretty awesome though and makes for a good experience. Once you finish you get your medal right away and a space blanket. There's also some bananas, pretzels, crackers, water, and electrolytes for you to refuel. You can hang out on the field to catch your breath and once you exit the stadium, you can't go back inside. Outside the stadium is where you get your T-shirt. You can also get a massage and get stretched out by some PT students.\n\nTraffic started really early. It took me almost 30 minutes to get from the freeway exit to the parking lot. There are a lot of portable restrooms and the lines aren't too long, but there's still a line. I wore my Saucony Endorphin Speed 2 and they felt great throughout the whole race. I was contemplating wearing my trainers since it had rained the night before and the ground was really wet. In the end, I had no problem with the grip on the Speed 2s. \n\n**Results:**\n\nFinished with a time of 1:54 which is like 8:43 pace. Overall happy with my performance at my first half marathon ever. I ran the first 5K @9:30 pace and my last 5K @8:18 pace. So definitely something to think about adjusting for next time.

I ended up losing over 50 pounds, It's probably more than 50 but I don't like to use the scale because I'm happy with how I look and I don't need a measurement to tell me what I am.\n\nI have wanted to run a marathon for a long time, I've done about 6 half marathons and wanted the new challenge. I signed up for the Disney marathon after the Chicago and NYC lotteries were both \"No's\", and I wanted a big\/significant\/fun race as my first. \n\nSince I had about a year before the race I decided to split the weeks into 3 major chunks. \n\nThe First Chunk was building a solid base. I started off running 3 days a week, with a max of 5 miles\/day. Eventually, I added long runs as a 4 running day and later on added a 5th day. I was doing about 20-30 miles a week by early summer. \n\nThe Second Chunk was basically training for the race with a modified Hal Higdon Novis plan. This was set up so that I would have a Half marathon race between my pre-training and my actual 12-week training. \n\nThe Half Marathon in September went really well. I PRed at 1:51:50, my first sub 2 half. \n\nEverything up to this point had been going amazing! physically felt great, I was hitting my goals, reaching new goals, and not missing training plans. \n\nThird Chunk: the actual training for the race. Everything was pretty good. I was locked in on the idea that I could consistently run a 9:45 mile without getting tired. I was doing long runs of 15-17 miles at 9:30 and figured moving it back a little would help. And a 4:15 finish would have been amazing. \n\nDecember rolls around and my city started getting a lot of rain every single day, cold wind, and rain. I started to 'take a day off' because it wouldn't affect things too much. \n\nAnd then, 3 and a half weeks before the race. Covid. My first time being positive. It only really lasted about a week, but my lungs were still pretty rough. I was able to get one last 13-mile long run in before tapering. That last long run gave me some confidence that I could at least finish the race but I had zero expectations. I decided to stick with the game plan and my time goals and hope for the best. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRace Day:\n\nThe weather was perfect in the morning. Maybe a little chilly while standing around but once we were moving it felt great. \n\nThe first 5 miles were exactly where I wanted to be.\n\nMile 6: I needed a bathroom. I got a porta-potty at mile 7 and I only peed, hoping that any other needs could be held off until after the race.\n\nMile 8: We were entering Magic Kindom and there was an actual bathroom, not a porta-potty. I decided I probably wouldn't get another opportunity like this later and took care of business. It added a couple of minutes to my time but it was worth it.\n\nMy other problem here that I wasn't realizing until later was that I was way too focused on not going too fast and not going too slow. If my mile time wasn't around 9:45 I started to adjust, but it ended up messing up my focus on the race itself. \n\nMile 18 was the beginning of the end. I started to walk a couple of times here and there, feeling like the end was still far away. I started to get the feeling like I consumed a lot of sugar, although I always have the same Huma and Ucan gels today they were making me feel crappy. \n\nAt Mile 21 I thought to myself, it's 5 more miles. I run 5 miles 4 days a week. I can do that in 45 minutes, and even if I gave myself a full hour, I can do this. I started picking up my pace. I can do 5 miles. I started passing people, and I felt good. 5 miles is easy. About a half mile later I was not feeling so confident. My legs were fine, everything felt fine for being 21 miles in except, my lungs. When I first started to run I would stop and run because my lungs needed more air, but I haven't had that issue in a long time. I could only guess that it was a covid side-effect. My lungs felt tired, they didn't want to be overworked anymore and I couldn't push through it. So I ran-walked as best as I could. \n\nIf I was able to guess though, I don't blame it all on covid. I think if that never happened I probably would still hit the wall and end up around 4:30 time, maybe a little less, but I don't think I would have reached the 4:15 goal. \n\nIn the end, I ran past the finish line, happy about the accomplishment, and tired. The time wasn't what I wanted but I am still proud to have it. This was my first marathon but definitely not the last.\n\n**TLDR:** Training went really well until Covid f'd it up 3 weeks before the race.","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1673902806.0},{"title":"Tuesday Shoesday","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/10e3g6o\/tuesday_shoesday\/","text":"Shoes are a big topic in this sub, so in an effort to condense and collect some of these posts, we're introducing **Shoesday Tuesday**!

I began running consistently in August\/September to prepare. I built up mileage slowly with 2-3 shorter runs per week and 1 longer run per week. By December, I was doing 2 5-6 mile runs and an 18-20 mile run per week. I ran 18 miles a couple of times, with my longest run being the 20 miler. I will say my pace was kind of all over the place during training as I wasn\u2019t exactly sure what was I shooting for. My quickest long runs would be in the 9:20 per mile range and my slowest would be around 10:30 per mile. I also neglected any cross-training due to busy life schedule. Not ideal, but my only exercise was my runs.  Around a month before the race, I caught a cold and stopped running. Then with the holidays, it was all too easy to neglect running. I did a couple of 3 and 5 mile runs in the weeks before the race, but it was hardly a well-designed \u201ctaper.\u201d\n\n### Pre-race\nI woke up about 3 hours before the race and had half a bagel with peanut butter. I chose to bring my hydration vest because I\u2019m used to running with it and I prefer to sip on it throughout the run rather than waiting to grab cups at an aid station. I filled my pack with Gatorade and brought 5 Gu\u2019s. It was drizzling in the morning, but the forecast was showing that the rain should stop by the time the race started.\n\n### Race\nI had planned on running with a 4:30 or 4:15 pacer, but I ended up lining up near the front of the start and the pacers were behind me, so I decided to just run my own race. The race started in rain that was heavier than I expected from the forecast, and I was thoroughly drenched and cold by around mile 3. I had never practiced running in the rain and didn\u2019t bring a jacket or poncho. However, the adrenaline kept me going and it honestly didn\u2019t bother me too much. I noticed my socks were wet, but I never felt any friction or blisters forming. By around mile 7, the rain stopped, and I was able to increase my pace. Miles 8-13 went by very quickly with my pace just below 9 minutes per mile. I was slightly worried that I was pushing too hard on pace, but I felt good and wanted to capitalize on that feeling and bank time for later. My half marathon split was just over 2 hours which I was happy with. For a while, I deluded myself into thinking I had a shot at running a sub 4 marathon.\nMile 14 was when I first started to feel any sense of tiredness. This was the start of dealing with incline that continued with some rolling hills through about mile 17. I hadn\u2019t done any training on hills, and by this time, I started to feel cramping in my quads. I did take two 30-second walk breaks on some of the steeper hills. Within that 4-mile stretch, my pace dropped all the way from 9:00 minute miles to 10:01 on mile 18. \nThe cramping in my quads would come and go, and I really had to push myself through the last 6 miles. My pace never recovered to where it had started, even though the course flattened out. I hovered around the 10-minute mile mark and by the last mile I slowed to 11:13. There was a sharp incline and turn before a downhill straightaway across a bridge, and I had to walk the incline before jogging to the finish. \n\n\n### Post-race\nI dealt with plenty of soreness after crossing the finish line, but I was happy that I felt I hydrated well throughout the race. I finished my 1.5L pack and took probably 3 or 4 additional cups of Gatorade along the way. I ate an energy gel about every 45 minutes. Didn\u2019t deal with any GI upset, which I have felt after half-marathons in the past. \nI\u2019d love to say I would\u2019ve been faster without the rain, but it really didn\u2019t bother me. At the end of the day, I\u2019m really happy with the time I got. In the future, I need to practice running hills because I felt really caught out by that, especially by that point in the race. I also need to incorporate strength training\/cross training on days that I don\u2019t run. I did a decent number of long runs in training, but I need to figure out a way to keep my pace from dropping off a cliff. I still haven\u2019t officially run a sub 2hr half marathon, so I think that will be my goal before running my next full marathon.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1673895088.0},{"title":"Official Q&A for Tuesday, January 17, 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/10e3g7d\/official_qa_for_tuesday_january_17_2023\/","text":"With over 2,275,000 subscribers, there are a lot of posts that come in everyday that are often repeats of questions previously asked or covered in the FAQ.\n\nWith that in mind, this post can be a place for any questions (especially those that may not deserve their own thread).

(*Achieved*)\n\n***Training:***\n\nI am a 39 year old male.  I had a run streak that reached back many years.  Since this past fall, I was running 12 miles a day for a few months.  I was injured in December and, since, have been running every other day.  But, still, typically around 12 miles per run.  I log my training at\n\n[https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/bogoodskiruns\/](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/bogoodskiruns\/)\n\n[https:\/\/www.dailyrun.net\/](https:\/\/www.dailyrun.net\/)\n\nI also lift weights on days that I do not run.  I don't drink alcohol.  Not a vegetarian but don't eat much meat.  I live on carbs.  I eat a lot of oatmeal and cereal and a ton of rice.  I love rice. Lol.  The only nutritional limitation that I maintain purposefully is avoidance of white sugar.\n\nSince I began running regularly at the 12-mile distance, I have been mindful of daily stretching.  Since injuring my hamstring in December, I have been incorporating dynamic stretching.  This has been a game-changer for me.  After every run and during every stretching session, I take time to swing my legs, do high knees, etc.  Maybe it's placebo but since doing this, I have recovered from my injury completely and my legs have felt refreshed every morning.\n\n***Event***:\n\nFinishing on the grounds of the Rose Bowl was really thrilling.  Though the paint was removed, I could still see the remnants of the names of the Rose Bowl competitors in the end zones.  The grass was so well maintained; it just really sort of overwhelming me to imagine the excitement that players must feel competing there in front 100,000 fans!\n\nThe course had some hills-- for sure.  Ascents tend to be my strength and I find that I pass a lot of people on hill climbs.  And, somehow, it seemed to me that there was more descent than ascent, so I took advantage and really pushed my pace on the downhills.  The climbs were all moderate.  I felt like exactly when they were getting to be tiresome, the ascent leveled out.  So, no big deal.\n\nThere were cheering sections from all the local running clubs and they were vibrant, adding to the excitement of the event.  It had been raining in the area for the past two weeks but stopped this morning, so the weather conditions were nearly perfect.  Maybe 50 degrees.  No wind.\n\nI run in Sauconys.  My favorite shoes of all time are the Endorphin Speed 3s.  I also have a pair of Endorphin Pro 3s that I haven't ran in yet and had intended to break in during this run.  However, because I thought the course might be wet, I ran in my Speed 3s instead, saving the Pro 3s from water damage.  They'll be ready for the LA Marathon in March!\n\nI had no problem parking.  I left Long Beach at 4:30 in the morning, and arrived at the Rose Bowl around 5:30 and was able to pull right into a mostly empty lot.  There were ample porta potties set up, though queues developed as the race start neared.  Bag check was simple.  I didn't really browse the fitness expo but there were vendors and it seemed cool enough.  For what it's worth, the woman who sang the National Anthem prior to the race absolutely crushed it.\n\n***Results***:\n\nOkay, the winner was a 55 year old male, who finished his half marathon in 1:00:07, pace: 4:35\/mile.  So, props to him!\n\nI completed in 1:27:58, pace of 6:43\/mile.   I finished 107\/7,758 overall and 19\/414 of males 35-39.\n\n***Conclusion***:\n\nThis was a well-organized event.  I really enjoyed it, and would recommend it.  Though, some people might be annoyed by the hills throughout the course.  I thought they were manageable.  Pasadena is gorgeous.  And experiencing the Rose Bowl from the field was thrilling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:  \n\nI think the result about the 55 year old \"winner\" was an error in the posted results.

I'm just bad at running. Also if this makes it to a certain circlejerk, well, more visibility to me I guess. I'm only making this race report because when attempting a Pfitz plan I only saw info about quicker people, and I wish I'd seen info about slower people (like me).\n\nAbout me: 26F, 163cm, weight circa 50kg.\n\n### Goals\n\n|Goal|Description|Completed?|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|A|Sub55|*Yes*|\n|B|Sub56 (PB)|*Yes*|\n|C|Improve last year's (58:XX)|*Yes*|\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### Splits\n\n|Kilometer|Time|\n|:-|:-|\n|5|27:29|\n|10|27:06|\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### Background&Training\n\nI've been running for a couple years, and more structured for one and a half, aprox. Also I'm terrible at it, but funnily enough I enjoy it. However, after doing a half marathon in Spring in barely sub2h and a marathon \"fun run\" in almost 5h (a free bib I was given, I have no plans of training for that as of now), I realized I could actually jog for quite a long time, but I wished I could be speedier. Therefore, I signed up for this 10K race, which I had already done last year as my first official 10K. Summers in Spain can get quite hot so I spent all of it doing base training, up to some 80km\/week, unsurprisingly, I wasn't ready for that kind of mileage jump in so little time, coming from 60km\/week and unexperienced. I enjoyed it a lot, until I didn't, was fatigued all the time and developed anemia. In September I had to leave my previous city and spent a month writing my PhD dissertation at my mom's. I ditched training for that reason, and only ran a medium-easy 1h a day, & took my iron pills.\n\nIn October I moved to Val\u00e8ncia (work reasons) and began the training plan. More background info: I don't smoke, only drink alcohol on very special occasions (think NYE), eat healthy most of the time, don't have kiddos or pets, don't party that much, and don't drive (I walk or bike to public transportation).\n\n### Pfitzinger's plan (my own view)\n\nI came into this plan with running not being a priority: I had just moved to a new city, new job, was still finishing my thesis dissertation and was overall very stressed. I also stopped being long-distance with GF, which was just awesome, but an adjustment as well. For those reasons, I chose the **lowest mileage 10K plan**, which goes from 48 to 67km a week. On cross-training days I've always gone to the gym so I kept doing that. I will try and explain how it felt from an unexperienced & slow runner's view. As a benchmark, I used the 56-min 10K from my Spring half.\n\n**My difficulties**.\n\n1. I started the plan with two week's \"buffer\" in case I wasn't able to complete any week due to unforeseen circumstances. Big mistake: I feel like I \"peaked\" too early and was also kind of done with the training a couple weeks before the race. In fact I \"failed\" a couple weeks (less mileage, or skipped a run...), but I should've keep on going, not \"retake them\", I guess. I completed around 85-90% of the prescribed plan.\n2. As an unexperienced runner, I literally can't pace myself. I didn't have a solid reference, and felt like I couldn't control my exact pace. However, I figured since I'm still a beginner, whichever pace feels \"hard\" when it's supposed to feel hard will do. I didn't stress much over that. Also I can't distinguish my 5K and 10K paces. I guess that comes with more racing.\n3. The plans are obviously aimed towards faster people (even though I'm included in the charts so I don't think it's dangerous for my times), so if you're like me, you're going to feels like most runs are taking quite some time. I was running around 1h:20min each running day. At the mid-end of the plan, I was a bit tired of doing that day in, day out. I guess if you're faster, 13k isn't that much, but for me is like 95-100min maybe, and that's not even a medium long run, it's a regular run. You need to be aware of that, which I wasn't completely, because when I was doing more mileage, it was spread over more days a week.\n\n**What I enjoyed**.\n\n1. Overall, I enjoyed the plan. I need to be forced to do some speed, so as the plan prescribed it, I was obedient. I only dreaded 2-3 of the workouts in total, since they were very difficult to me and felt terrible as couldn't hit my intended paces. I wondered how the F was I going to get 55min, if I couldn't even run 2K straight at that pace... but I trusted the plan and just did what I could (I mean, I'm certainly not getting paid for this silly hobby).\n2. I could feel fitter by the weeks. There was like a turning point after which I felt the plan was actually working. I was less tired for the same paces and enjoyed cruising my \"endurance\" pace. I got to see beautiful sunsets and feel at peace, too.\n3. The plan actually worked because I ran this race 4:30min+ faster than last year. So I'm content with this.\n\n### Race\n\nI woke up at 7AM, had a tried&tested breakfast, got there at 8.45AM to take a pic with some people I met online, dropped my bag and went to the \"bathrooms\". Race started at 9.45AM for my box. I tried to maintain even splits and felt like a fish out of water, gasping for air during the last 9.5km (yes, my lungs didn't like the race one bit). Legs felt fine all the way. To my very surprise, I beat my own A goal by one minute. I didn't know, or suspect one bit, that I could make it that well. I'm quite proud of myself. For this coming season, I signed up for a 5K circuit (each month, a neighborhood organizes a 5K). Tips to train for that will be welcome in the comments.\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http:\/\/sfdavis.com\/racereports\/) created by \/u\/herumph.","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1673783179.0},{"title":"Official Q&A for Monday, January 16, 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/10d5mkv\/official_qa_for_monday_january_16_2023\/","text":"With over 2,275,000 subscribers, there are a lot of posts that come in everyday that are often repeats of questions previously asked or covered in the FAQ.\n\nWith that in mind, this post can be a place for any questions (especially those that may not deserve their own thread).

Previous to starting this, I had just been trying to increase mileage every week and was struggling intensely with it. Within weeks of starting the program, I was running better, pacing better, and feeling better. I learned so much about proper form, proper prep, good speed work, and mental state than I ever had just trying this on my own. \n\n### Pre-race\nThe week coming up to the race, I bombed the intended running plan, only getting two runs in prior to race day. I dialed in my food intake, hydration, sleep and mental prep. The night before, I had a big mac and cheese meal, did some flexibility work, and slept well.\n\n### Race\nRace day came very cold. 28F, it had snowed the night before, and the area around the start\/finish line was just a little slick. Like with my last race, I did nothing but hydrate before the race. I have never fueled before running, and as they say, you NEVER test new things on race day. Showed up at 7:30, grabbed my race packet, changed my shoes and chilled in the car until about 8:30 when I got out and did a little pre-race jog before lining up. Race started at 9am, and I was towards the front of the pack but stayed in the middle so I could let the faster runners go past me. \n\nMy previous 13.1 had come on a training run that was supposed to be 12.4 miles, but I felt good so I added to it. That run had been 2:03:54, so I knew I could do that, but I wanted to try for a flat 2 hour.\n\nThe race format was two full five mile loops around the lake and then an out and back. Aid stations were placed at various intervals, along with portapotties.\n\nMiles 1-3: I spent the better part of these miles just trying to get warm, and find the pace I felt most comfortable running. My times bounced around a little bit here as I was trying not to go crazy right out of the gate, but also not slow down so much that my sub 2:03 was in jeopardy.\n\nMiles 3-6: I started to find a rhythm here, had a group I was running with who seemed to be right around my pace. Everything started feeling good here, my legs felt good, breathing was in tune, I was paying attention to my form and enjoying the run.\n\nMiles 7-9: This is where I really hit my stride, did some quick math and realized that if I kept this up, I was theoretically in for a sub two hour run. I was so pumped, but I kept my cool, kept my head in the game, and didn't allow my excitement to push me into a faster pace. \n\nMiles 10-13.1: I passed the start life for the second time at mile ten, and this is where the shit hit the fan. I immediately started cramping in my hip flexors and calves. Muscles were twitching uncontrollably and I was in a lot of pain. I ran\/walked the rest of the race, but at mile 11, I was really starting to question if finishing at all was even going to be doable for me. I was absolutely miserable, it was snowing, and now I was getting passed by people who I'd been running ahead of. Crossing that finish line at a decent pace was one of the most painful things I've done in my time running. I cramped up completely and had to be helped to the sidelines by my partner, where I was able to walk around and slowly get my muscles under control.\n\n### Post-race\nAfter the race, I picked up my medal, grabbed a banana and a cookie and booked it home. During the drive back, my left foot cramped so bad I had to pull over and swap to my zero drop shoes. Once back home, I did a long, painful stretch session, took a shower and hit OTB (A local bicycle bar in Pittsburgh) for a big burger. \n\nSome post race research has made me realize that I may have sweat more than I thought and lost more sodium than I was replacing. I'm currently looking into changing out my Gatorade that I use to a different drink for my longer runs. I also almost immediately made the decision to sign up for the South Park half in March. With a little more training and better prep, I know sub 2 is possible and I'm looking forward to it.\n\nIf anyone has a good drink mix that ups sodium intake, I'd love some recommendations\n\n\nMade with a new [race report generator](http:\/\/sfdavis.com\/racereports\/) created by \/u\/herumph.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1673801060.0},{"title":"Cold Weather Marathon Running Advice","author":"SHoTime73","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/10ck3t0\/cold_weather_marathon_running_advice\/","text":"Hi All-  I have a very cold-weather marathon coming up in March and can use some input on what to wear.  I went on a long-run yesterday (19mi) in 37F (felt like 25 w\/breeze) and was fine except for a walking stretch (had to refill water bottles), which left me very cold and wet from sweat.  I really couldn't warm back up to comfortable and was drenched at the end.  \n\nMain challenge is that this is a hilly trail course, so I expect to be out for 4-5 hours in sub-30F weather with the potential for rain or snow and a near certainty of wind.  I'm not a speed-demon to begin with and running slow enough to not sweat is not an option for me as I just run hot most of the time. \n\nHere's my current wardrobe plan for this, most of which I tested yesterday:\n\n* Adidas Terrex Agravic shoes\\*\n* Injinji wool short socks\n* Smartwool calf-height socks\n* short tights under long tights\n* shorts with pockets (for gloves and a chapstick)\n* Tracksmith wool base (LS)\n* Adidas LS warm top mid-layer (kind of like this [https:\/\/www.adidas.com\/us\/condivo-22-pro-warm-top\/H21274.html](https:\/\/www.adidas.com\/us\/condivo-22-pro-warm-top\/H21274.html) but mine has more of a short turtleneck and a 1\/4 zip that opens to vent)\n* Adidas rain shell (really good zipper venting on both sides)\n* Neck gaitor\n* Smartwool beanie\n* glasses\n* gloves\n\nMy lower-body (incl feet) were fine.  My neck\/head was fine.  My upper body was cold about half-way through (gain, because I was soaked).  It's been suggested that I swap the mid-layer Adidas for an Arcteryx fleece thing, but I'm worried that would just absorb like a sponge.  The Adidas top is a pretty thin material (not quite sweatshirt, more than t-shirt), and I can usually run in that as a jacket in 40F weather for 10mi or so.\n\nThe course does not allow discarding of clothes along the way, though it's a loop, so I could keep a change of clothes stashed if changing out of wet into dry  midway through was the right call.  Is that the plan or is there a better way to dress that I'm missing?\n\nThis is not a PR opportunity, but rather a \"get to the finish and enjoy the run\" moment, so I'd like to not be miserable for the last hour or more of it.\n\nThanks in advance for your help!\n\n\\*I used to run with Adidas, so I'm biased!","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1673789906.0},{"title":"Electric vs. Manual Treadmills","author":"foxylobster666","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/10clbp3\/electric_vs_manual_treadmills\/","text":"I'm in the market for a treadmill, and I came across the Assault Runner.

When I realized that I was pretty good at running I decided to set a goal: I wanted to complete a half marathon. Exactly a month later I succesfully attempted this goal, I ran it in 1:47:12. Then I decided to train for a sub 20min 5km, so I did one faster run a week to improve my speed. In May I reached this goal by running 5 kilometers in 19:24. After these two goals I didn't really have any other goals so I started running occasionally for the next two years (average 25 kms\/week), some weeks I didn't run at all because I didn't have a lot of time because of university. In April 2022 I started training for a 10km race which was organized by my university, after this race I was in pretty good shape so I decided to sign up for a marathon because I dreamt of finishing one. After this full marathon last year in October (with a time of 2:54:58), I decided to start focussing on the shorter distances with my main goal being running 5 kilometers under 18 minutes. I succeeded in this by running around 40 kms\/week in November and around 60 kms\/week in December (ran 17:46 21\/12). After this I started running more with a friend that is way better at running than me. This is when I started getting my weekly kilometers to 70 kms\/week (even 80kms last week). We have been running 2 interval sessions (every Tuesday and Thursday), one longer run (every Saturday) and 3 normal runs every week. The first type of interval training consisted of 2 times 2km of 3:20 min\/km with 200 meters resting in between each rep and 2 minutes in between every set. The second type of interval training consisted of 15 times 200 meters starting at 36 seconds\/200m and ending at 34 seconds\/200m with 200 meters resting in between each rep. The long run consisted of 21 kilometers with 6km at 4:40 min\/km, 6km at 4:20 min\/km, 4km at 4:00 min\/km, 3km at 3:45 min\/km and 2km at an easy pace to cooldown.\n\n# Pre-\"race\"\n\n  I eat very healthy and only drink soft drinks a few times a week. Last time I drank alcohol was on New Years eve, some people can handle it better but it seems to affect my condition a lot. Only thing I should work on is the amount of sleep I get, most nights I only get 5 or 6 hours sleep.\n\nI ran 6 kilometers at an easy pace with 5 accelerations of 30 seconds the day before the run.\n\nThe day before the race I ate mashed potatoes with a sausage. I got around 8 hours of sleep. I ate a dish of pasta 3 hours and 30 minutes before the race and a banana 3 hours before the race. I warmed up at an easy pace for 2 kilometers.\n\n# \"Race\"\n\n  The weather was pretty good: clear sky, wind speed of 24 km\/h, no rain. We started running around 3pm.\n\nWe were running around an athletic track. I told my friend that was pacing me to run at 3:40 min\/km pace to have a surplus of 20 seconds just in case I couldn't hold the pace for the full 10 kilometers. This means we had to run every lap in 1:28, we started off by running 1:27\/1:28 each lap. During the 4th kilometer it was a little bit harder because suddenly there were gusts of wind but they were gone before we even started to worry about them. After 7kms I was still feeling good so we started running laps of 1:26. Then the last kilometer I started going full out and ended with a 3:28 km. Until the 7th km everything went very smooth, but after that my legs started to get heavy (maybe because of the high mileage). That's when the mental aspect starting kicking in and you just gotta tell yourself one kilometer more until you get to the 10km mark. My average heartrate throughout the \"race\" was 181 bpm and my maximum heartrate was 187 bpm. My all time highest heartrate is 204 bpm. GPS was a bit dodgy but we manually timed each lap. I ran with the Saucony Endorphine Pro 2's during the race and with the Saucony Endorphine Speed 3's during the warmup and cooldown. I was planning on running this race with my Vaporfly Next Percentage 2 but I don't like how they fit my feet so I decided not to use them.\n\n# Post-\"race\"\n\nWe did a 4km easy cooldown. After that we drank some sports drink, ate soup and I also ate a bag of chips (because I earned it ;) ). When I got home my parents made French Fries for me and I ate them pretty slowly because I wasn't hungry anymore, I also drank a lot of chocolate milk because it is good for recovering after a hard session\/race.\n\n# Questions\n\nNext Saturday I wanna run a half marathon, my goal was sub 1:20. Do you think this is possible or what time should I aim for based on this information? After that I am going to run a marathon in Seville and I was hesitating of going for 2:45 or 2:48, any recommendations for this race? I wanna buy the Saucony Endorphine pro 3's, are they worth it or should I rather buy other supershoes (not Vaporfly's, don't really like them)?","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1673481255.0},{"title":"Fat Dog 120: Don't Call It a Comeback","author":"IamShartacus","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/109g2ni\/fat_dog_120_dont_call_it_a_comeback\/","text":"Full report with pictures and links can be found [here](https:\/\/ryruns.blogspot.com\/2023\/01\/fat-dog-120-dont-call-it-comeback.html)\n\n----\n\n##**Fat Dog 120: Don't Call It a Comeback**\n\nOr do call it a comeback. Whatever, I'm not your mom.\n\nI originally registered for Fat Dog 120 on January 2, 2018. I was coming off the best racing season of my short ultrarunning career, having broken 14 hours at Manitou's Revenge, 20 hours at Vermont 100, and 24 hours at Grindstone, along with setting a new FKT on the NJ section of the Appalachian Trail. I was feeling invincible and was ready to take on a new level of mountain ultramarathon.\n\nFor reasons that I will elaborate on in way too much detail, that did not come to pass. If you would like to fast forward, skip to the race section below. For those of you who want to wallow in self pity with me, read on...\n\nWhat followed was a string of bad luck for the race organizers, for myself personally, and - well - for the entire planet:\n\n* 2018: Race canceled because of wildfires on course\n* 2019: Race held on a modified course. I deferred to 2020.\n* 2020: Race canceled because of Covid\n* 2021: Race canceled because of Covid\n* 2022: Race held on a modified course because of flooding\n\nOn August 5, 2022, four and a half years after registering, I finally stood on the starting line. Rather than using the intervening years to get stronger and faster, I had suffered a string of mild but nagging health issues that had slowed me down a quite a bit from my peak. I was now coming off my worst years of racing, having blown up at Manitou's Revenge, Grindstone, Hellbender, and Manitou's again.\n\nIf you've noticed a lack of activity on this blog, that's because for a long period of time, I simply didn't enjoy running any more. I kept going through the motions, hoping to reignite the flame, but my body would not cooperate. Even my easy runs were leaving me feeling drained and sore.\n\nIt wasn't until a blood test showed low levels of iron and vitamin D that things started to click. I started taking supplements and immediately noticed an uptick in my energy levels. I bought a gravel bike and a TheraBand and started doing what would have been unimaginable to a young Ryan: stretching and cross training.\n\nMy race results didn't immediately improve though. My body was recovering, but my fitness would take longer to return. Also, I was about 15 pounds over my ideal racing weight. Rather than focus on a time goal, I decided that my main goal was to enjoy this experience that I was finally going to have in the mountains. Rather than taper, I spent the week before the race exploring Banff with my wife Alex.\n\nOkay, I did have one time goal. They give out colorful buckles for a 36 hour finish. I thought that would be fun, but it seemed optimistic given all of the above. That goal went out the window pretty early on.\n\nLet's get to the race.\n\n##**The Gang Races Fat Dog**\n\nFat Dog is a 120+ mile race in the Canadian Cascades, running point to point from Cathedral Provincial Park to Manning Provincial Park. Despite being located just across the border from North Cascades National Park, these provincial parks are some of the best kept secrets in North America. The course passes through pristine wilderness, crossing alpine meadows and rugged ridgelines. In 2022 the course was rerouted, perhaps permanently, because of severe flood damage in the Skagit Valley. This added on 5-10 miles and a bit of elevation gain.\n\nI was lucky enough to be joined by my two favorite Alexes for this race: Alex T. (my wife, aka Girl Alex) and Alex G. (my running friend, aka Boy Alex). Their experience in getting my dumb ass through difficult running events is unmatched. With a little bit of fanfare at the starting line, we set off on our 120+ mile journey.\n\nThe first section was a 4,800' climb over about 9 miles on the Lakeview Trail to the Cathedral Aid station. This was the biggest climb and the highest point of the race, so as usual I forced myself to take it extremely easy, letting the more enthusiastic runners race past me while I stopped to take pictures and enjoy the scenery.\n\nThe views on the ridge were spectacular. Race weekend happened to fall exactly at peak wildflower bloom and I finally got to see why people call this the most scenic race in North America.\n\nAfter a short traverse along the chilly ridgeline, we made a 3,700' descent to Ashnola Aid station at mile 18. The weather got hotter and the trail got dustier as we descended, so I reined in my effort level. I was excited to see my crew for the first time, but I was also eager to get out of the dusty mosquito-y valley and into cooler weather. I think I got a little impatient with them as they swapped out the dying batteries in my SPOT tracker, but in reality I was only there for 5-10 minutes.\n\nThe next section was almost the mirror opposite of the first section: a 3,400' climb to Flat Top mountain over 10 miles followed by a 4,000' descent to the Passayten River. I should mention here that on paper, these climbs all max out at around 800 ft\/mi, which is not particularly steep for a mountain race. But I noticed pretty quickly that the trails were not evenly graded. Strava backs me up on this, showing that the ironically named Easygoing Creek trail maxes out around 30% grade in certain sections.\n\nOn the bright side, there was [this](https:\/\/blogger.googleusercontent.com\/img\/b\/R29vZ2xl\/AVvXsEiUyq8Iei2TkLJb5nr6mHJJE0izOoGXtLr5HcxuE3NrYQcRhD4V_IzvbQ0i6hGfFC6N7e95MK3CVG5GHL3qJoJXVZQagsMo56bjuC7C1qSf9nb5QWSGx1kDF3N_oSfhHnAG72HWbul0MeNXE8Qbxxjr45KxV16bRiJdR9Lt5b9mavXqJuvV5Ekv99C8\/s4032\/20220805_185747.jpg) to look at:\n\nI mean, just... Bruh.\n\nI'm sure I lost 10 minutes in this section just spinning in circles taking pictures. But when am I going to be back to the Canadian Cascades? Worth it.\n\n##**Wet Feet and the Search for Meat**\n\nMuch to the relief of my race time, the sun went down and my view shrunk to just the 10 foot circle  in front of me that was illuminated by my headlamp. The descent was pretty straightforward, but what I found at the bottom was a surprise: a thigh deep crossing of the Passayten River aided by a fixed rope. I had read a half dozen race reports to prepare for the race, but apparently this didn't make enough of an impression on those runners to warrant its inclusion. Canadians are a different breed.\n\nAt 39 miles into the race, I didn't expect to get stuck behind any groups of runners, but this was a major choke point since only one person could use the rope at a time. I considered charging ahead without the rope but didn't want to risk dousing myself in cold water as the temperature was dropping. Instead, I occupied myself by taking pictures and filtering water. After a 10 minute wait, it was finally my turn to cross. I wasted no time, charging ahead and presumably winning a Strava crown for that 100 foot segment (note to self: create the world's dumbest Strava segment).\n\nIn the original course, this crossing would have been followed by a 3 mile section of highway, which always sounded awful. Instead this year we followed a fire break that paralleled the road. For those of you who, like me, are unfamiliar with this term, a fire break is essentially a path bulldozed through the woods to prevent forest fires from spreading. This one was brand new, as evidenced by the fresh bulldozer tracks, and was basically a mud pit that climbed 1,000 feet from the highway. On fresh legs it might have been fun, but holy cow was this a slog!\n\nAnyway, I finally made it to Bonnevier aid station, which I had been calling Bon Iver in my head for the last few hours. It was just after 11pm and I hadn't seen my crew in over 7 hours. I asked the Alexes to see if the aid station had any cheeseburgers. I had smelled them cooking back at the Trapper Aid station four hours earlier, but someone snagged the last one and I didn't want to wait for them to make more. I had been on a mission to find a burger since that moment, but I was shit out of luck because apparently those were the only burgers in the entire mountain range.\n\nWith dry shoes on my feet and a handful of various other greasy animal products for the journey, I got back on the trail. This would be the crux of the race for me and the other runners: a nighttime traverse of the Heather Trail, 37 miles in the backcountry with no major aid stations.\n\nI started the climb with another runner who had run the first edition of Fat Dog. I had previously heard that the race was originally marketed as a 100 miler, and it wasn't until runners got close to the finish that they realized it was more like 115-120 miles. Yeesh. I learned from him that the reality was even worse. The race was marketed as \"beginner friendly\" and there were runners attempting their first 100 miler that year. As someone who came into this race having finished thirteen 100 mile races and was completely drained by the finish, the thought of doing this with no prior 100 mile experience was horrifying.\n\nI hit the Bonnevier aid station around 3am, happy to see other people for the first time in a few hours. The weather was starting to get chilly, and I saw frost forming in the grass around me. The aid station was a sullen affair with just a couple of volunteers standing shivering in the dark. I filled a water bottle and grabbed a gel and got moving. To those poor volunteers, thank you for standing on a mountaintop in the dark to hand out gels and fill water bottles!\n\nA few miles later I found myself stumbling. My mind was drifting and I suddenly had the irresistible urge to sleep. I've noticed that my ability to handle sleep deprivation has been getting worse as I get older, and for the first time in my racing career I had to lie down in the middle of the trail and take a nap. I left my headlamp on so no one would step on me, took a quick look at my watch, and immediately drifted off into the abyss. I woke up 5 minutes later, a bit chilly but feeling much more energetic.\n\nIt was now almost 5am, and I knew that the sunrise would help me wake up. I crested Nicomen ridge just in time to see the first rays of sunlight peaking out over the mountains in the distance. A short but steep descent brought me to the Nicomen Lake aid station, where I once again grabbed a minimal amount of food and water and got back on the trail. I was around the half way point in the race with just under 20 hours elapsed. A 36 hour finish was certainly not going to happen, but 40 sounded like a nice round number too.\n\nWith the sun now shining down on me, I felt a renewed burst of energy and hammered the descent to Grainger Creek aid station. Just kidding! I immediately began to feel sleepy again, and I staggered down the trail, barely managing a 15min\/mi pace on the buttery smooth single track. I zombie shuffled into the aid station, set a 5 minute timer on my phone, and immediately collapsed onto a yoga mat for my second nap of the race.\n\nOnce again, the short nap revived me (following it up with a cup of coffee didn't hurt either), and I was back on the trail. I now had a 10 mile climb on the Hope Pass Trail to get to my crew at the next major aid station. I was moving well, but this was a new section of the course, and it had clearly not seen much foot traffic. I could tell how much work had gone into clearing it ahead of race day, given all the fallen trees that had been cut. However, the trail was a muddy, mossy, brushy mess. Despite not having had rain in the last few days, I found myself constantly sidestepping puddles and creeks running across the trail.\n\nI arrived at Hope Pass aid station at almost noon, having gone 12 hours since seeing my crew. I asked if they could find me that cheeseburger, but the hot options were tater tots and bacon. Once again, not bad as far as consolation prizes go. I was craving salt and I vaguely recall saying \"Tell them to put a lot of ketchup on the tots. Like, a disgusting amount of ketchup. Fuck them up with ketchup.\"\n\n##**The Part Where I Got to Run with People!**\nNow 80 miles into the race, we were firmly in pacer territory. Boy Alex had initially offered to pace more mileage, but with the lack of crew access in the backcountry, the only other option would have been for him to start at mile 40. And while 80 miles with a pacer sounds nice, I didn't want us to both be trashed by the end.\n\nWe were back in the high country, and with the sun shining on the wildflowers we felt like we were in the Sound of Music. We had a 24 mile traverse back along the Heather Trail to the next major aid station, and Boy Alex was determined to keep me focused and motivated. Although like me, he couldn't help but stop for pictures.\n\nWe reached Nicomen Lake aid station at the same time as Lee Conner, a badass woman with whom I have shared miles at Grindstone and Hellbender. I always know I'm having a good day if I'm near her on the course, but unfortunately she was going through a serious rough patch. She seemed to be struggling to form words and her movement was uncharacteristically slow and cautious. I advised her to get some food in her system and take a nap, not that she needs my advice when it comes to finishing mountain ultras. I left her in the capable hands of the aid station volunteers and hoped for the best as I trudged onward.\n\nThe remainder of the Heather Trail was beautiful, if not particularly fast. I hit the 100 mile mark in 32 hours, which seemed respectable to me given the difficulty of the course. I noted out loud that it would have been so nice if this race was \"only\" 100 miles. But alas, my dumb ass decided that 120+ was a good idea.\n\nAt mile 103 we hit Blackwall Road, a winding dirt road that would take us down to the race headquarters at Manning Park Resort. From here we had a panoramic view south into North Cascades National Park.\n\nIt was nice to be on a graded road and not have to think about foot placements for a while, but the soles of my feet were a mess after running through so much mud earlier in the race. We got to Blackwell aid station, and the Alexes swapped pacing bibs while I did some surgery. I scrubbed the grit off my feet with a towel (a highly useful piece of race gear) and dried them off as best as possible. To add a bit of protection, I double layered my socks, which seemed to help somewhat. With Girl Alex now by my side, I got back on my feet and hobbled onward.\n\nWe had a short detour onto a rocky trail that cut a switchback off the road descent, but after that it was six miles of pavement to descend 2,000 feet. I'm typically a strong downhill runner late in races, and I managed a respectable-but-not-speedy 14 min\/mi pace on this section. But let me tell you that my hips and knees were not happy about this sudden burst of what I will generously call \"speed.\"\n\nI felt bad that Girl Alex's section with me was such a low point. She tried to distract me by talking about some dinner plans with my family when we got back, but I informed her in no uncertain terms that I was in no state to check my mental calendar for openings. In fact, I was pretty sure that we were going to have to throw my corpse in a dumpster after the race, so future dinner plans seemed pretty fuckin' irrelevant. So yeah, that's the head space I was in. Sorry babe.\n\nThe Alexes swapped pacer bibs again, and now I was back to being Boy Alex's problem. He had chugged a cold brew coffee and was determined to get me to the finish line regardless of my deteriorating state. I spent the next few miles trying to keep up with him as he went into full drill sergeant mode, barking orders to run interspersed with words of encouragement. I racked my brain for a polite way to tell him to fuck off. I considered sitting down in the center of the trail and DNFing in protest of this outrageous treatment, but that seemed a tad too dramatic. Eventually I settled on a very frank, \"Hey man, this is not working and I'm totally fine with finishing an hour later if it means not pushing this hard.\" That did the trick.\n\nWe passed by the finish line at mile 113 and still had another 14 miles left to go, which if you ask me is a pretty rotten thing to do to a runner. We trudged onwards, but for the third time in the race I was met with an overwhelming urge to lie down and sleep. Boy Alex, having been nudged out of drill sergeant mode, relented and I curled up for a few minutes until I felt a very large spider crawl up my inner thigh. Fine. Fuck. I guess I won't sleep.\n\nThus began a very slow and sullen ascent of the Skyline Trail. If you had stopped me at this point in the race and asked my opinion on the technicality of the Fat Dog trails, I would have said that it has some mildly rocky sections but nothing too strenuous. Skyline flipped this assessment on its head. Rocky ledges. Steep drop-offs, sometimes on both sides of the trail. If I had done this in the daylight on fresh legs it would have been my jam. In the dark with 120 miles on my legs, it was very much not my jam.\n\nBoy Alex did his best to distract me by practicing his Spanish. It had been freezing by the water at Lightning Lake (\"Ryan esta frio!\"), and as we climbed we hit a much warmer patch of air (\"Ahora, Ryan esta muy caliente!\") As my 20 mile miles turned to 30+ minute miles, I did the sort of mental math that every runner does at this point in the race. 40 hours had slipped away. 41 wasn't looking good either. Let's shoot for 42 then. The answer to life, the universe, and everything. It's a better number than 36 or 40 anyway.\n\nWe crested the last summit with just over 40 hours elapsed. I tried to run downhill but me feet were hamburger meat and I was losing coordination from the lack of sleep. At one point I stepped straight off the side of the trail and would have fallen 20 feet into some brush if not for a perfectly placed fallen tree that my foot landed on. Get your shit together Thorpe!\n\nI noted with surprise that no runners had passed us since the last aid station, and with that a half dozen people flew by. One of them was Lee Conner, who was back from the dead and poised to finish with her trademark sprint. I gave chase for a few seconds but had to let her go.\n\nAt long last, we reached the bottom of the mountain. The finish line came into view across Lightning Lake and we heard cheering from the small group of spectators who were braving the cold in the middle of the night. I shambled across the finish line, gave Girl Alex a big kiss, collected my buckle, and gave that a big kiss too for good measure. Boy Alex got a hug.\n\nOnly nine runners had broken 36 hours and twenty broke 40 hours, which made me feel a bit better about missing those goals by such a wide margin. Despite having almost perfect weather, the course changes certainly seem to have added some difficulty to an already difficult race. Nevertheless, I finished feeling healthy (my feet were fine once they dried out) and despite some late race struggles, I really thoroughly enjoyed the experience.\n\n* Finish Time: 41:58:36 (30th place of 130 starters)\n* Distance: 127.6 miles\n* Elevation: 27,598 feet\n\n##**Epilogue**\n\nWe couldn't hang out long because the temperature was just above freezing, but the next afternoon, after eating all the bacon and eggs they had in our small town, we returned to the scene of the crime and enjoyed soaking our tired feet in Nicomen Lake in 90 degree weather. What a difference a few hours makes!\n\nThen we had a three hour drive back to Vancouver to catch our flights home. Or rather, the Alexes had a three hour drive. I took a three hour nap and magically found myself at YVR airport.\n\nI don't know if I'll come back to Fat Dog any time soon, but I'm glad I finally had the opportunity to run this amazing race. Huge thanks to the organizers, the volunteers, and of course, my two wonderful Alexes!","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1673471413.0},{"title":"Race Report - Walt Disney World Marathon - My First Marathon!","author":"mrdeeds23","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/running\/comments\/109hkhy\/race_report_walt_disney_world_marathon_my_first\/","text":"### Race Information\n* **Name:** Disney Marathon\n* **Date:** January 8th, 2023\n* **Distance:** 26.2 miles\n* **Location:** Orlando, Florida\n* **Time:** 4:22:18 \n\n### Goals\n| Goal | Description | Completed? |\n|------|-------------|------------|\n| A | Enjoy it! | *Yes* |\n| B | Sub 4:30 | *Yes* |\n\n### Splits\n| Mile | Time |\n|------|------|\n| Mile 6 Split | 1:00:03\n| 10.1 Mile Split | 1:40:40\n| Half Split | 2:10:52\t\n| 20 Mile Split | 3:18:15\t\n\nThis is my first race report so forgive me if i'm a little all over the place here!\n\n### Training\nBit of background for me - I'm in my mid 30s and played sports and been fairly in shape growing up. Always would do various 5k and 10k's over the years and have done 3 half marathons in the last 5 years but never took running super seriously. With age I became a bit out of shape and leveraged mostly trail running, cycling and hiking to combat that. That being said, earlier in 2022 after doing my last half, something sparked in my brain to go for the full. I have a friend who works for Disney corporate and is an avid triathlete so figured the Disney one would be a good one to try with him and bring my wife to Disney for the first time which she's been wanting. \n\nThroughout 2021 and 2022, I ran typically 2-3x per week without any training regiment with the exception of the Denver half that I did earlier in the year. I also did an olympic duathlon(bike\/run) in August to challenge myself and dip my toes in the water so to speak of multisport racing. Official training for this one was a 3 month Mcmillan training plan from Strava with a semi ambitious 4hour 30minute goal in mind. Training largely consisted of easy run on Tuesdays of varying distance, tempo runs on Thursdays, long run for time on Sunday with some rough distance goal in mind. Longest run I did pre race was I think 21miles with a 3 week taper time frame. \n\nBeing in Colorado, the weather was a bit of a wildcard as training began in October so I ended up splitting a lot of time outside and inside on our treadmill (blessing to have). Some weeks I would substitute some of the recovery runs with time on the bike trainer(zwift) or some easy snowboarding but I made the effort to do something at least 3x per week. I did also strive to do most of my long runs outside despite weather and not substitute those out whatsoever. Those were also where I was testing my various in race nutrition via gels\/gummies etc. I have used gels and things on long bike rides and in past half marathons but never to this extent so I wanted to make sure I was ready for the race with no GI concerns. Chaffing was also something I had to figure out as my thighs would get absolutely wrecked in training until I found the right combination of lined shorts with no boxers and Vaseline on the thighs and bits. \n\n### Pre-race\nIn hindsight, I planned things a bit poorly in that we planned to go to disney parks 2 days before the race with my family who lives nearby. I did my best not to overdo it and limit walking and time on my feet but ended up walking around 6-7 miles per day. Thankfully our hotel had a hot tub and I was able to soak my feet and legs each night and recovery seemingly alright. Food was also shockingly healthier than I was planing for (lot of chicken\/rice\/veg meals) and our hotel even had a \"runners meal\" the night before which was pasta with sauce and meatballs with a bit of bread. All of that plus good hydration was definitely in my favor for race day. I also have read that its common to not sleep well the night before the race so 2 nights before I was able to get a good 8 hours of rest feeling good. The night before I got about 5 hours which was better than planned. \n\nRace day itself was a very early wake up call. Race start was 5AM with a manditory check in at 4am (have to have the race and get people out of the parks quickly) so I was up at 245 to ensure I had adequate time to empty my bowels, eat and get to the start. I was staying on property so I had a bus that took me directly to the area which was nice. Was able to eat a plain bagel with peanut butter and cliff bar on the way over and drink a full bottle of water. Was bummed my hotel had no microwave or source of hot water before 530am so I could not have my oatmeal which is my usual pre long run and race ritual. Never the less, was feeling good and made my way to starting corral to stretch and meet up with my other friend running with me by 430am.  \n\n### Race\nThe race kicked off promptly at 5am and being in the 2nd group (B) I began at 505am. My biggest concern for the race was the temperatures and humidity as i'm used to running at higher altitude and more dry air. To my delight it was 51F at start and only around 85% humidity so that was really nice. It was a bit tight getting out of the initial cluster but I soon found my rhythm and broke free. Majority of my long runs were at the 10:55-11:30 range during training and I was planning for 10:15-10:30 for the race itself. Given the cool temps and stoke level for the race, I found myself comfortably around the 10:00\/min mile pace and kept it around there the entire time. \n\nThe first 3 miles came and went very quickly and my pace and heart rate were feeling good. From the water on the walk to the start my bladder was full so I had a quick porta potty stop around mile 4 but was in and out in less than 30seconds. My goal was sub 4h30m based on previous half marathons and my training and I felt that was easily attainable. I passed the 4h30m pacer around mile 4 and never saw them again. \n\nAfter pacing the pacer, I was in such a good zone and rhythm I truthfully don't remember much. I was able to shoot my wife and family a few texts with updates around mile 8 and 14 and felt really great all around. The race is neat in that you run through all 4 Disney parks in Orlando and there are a ton of employees lining the parks that early. Truly a unique experience for anyone who likes Disney and very neat to see the parks at that hour. Majority of the race flew by with nothing notable to mention, just nice smooth miles.\n\nFor nutrition, I had 6 gels (Gu Roctane, 2 caffeine and 4 no caffeine) and 1 pack of scratch energy gummies with me. I had the first around 45min mark and tried to aim for every 45min. After the 2nd, I broke into the gummies as I was starting to feel a bit hungry so I would have 2 of those (~10 in the pack) every 20min or so between gels. At aid stations I would chase the gels with a little bit of gatorade (worrying about the humidity so wanted to do gato for more electrolytes) and a water. \n\nThe only noticeable slowdown and need to push was around the 20mile mark. The stories of the last 6miles being a struggle were definitely true for me. My hips started to tighten up and my calves were streaming. While my pace was consistent, the last 6 markers seemed to come very very slowly. The last 2 aid stations I partially walked through and tried to stretch very briefly but was able to still get out with good pace. My Garmin watch was about .4 ahead of the track markers so I gave my family a heads up text when I hit the 20 mile marker so they could catch me crossing the finish line which they did. Holy crap, it was pure elation as I crossed and stopped my watch to see the time. Was absolute stoked at my performance and shockingly felt pretty okay as I walked to the ending meet up area with my water and snack box to get the medal.\n\n### Post-race\nAfter a few photos with my wife I promptly sat my ass down and stretched. I had a drop bag which had a Tailwind nutrition recovery shake which I took down quickly as well. Sat for around 20 minutes or so and getting up was already a struggle. Hips, thighs and calves were screaming but managed to get on the bus back to the hotel. Quick shower and then hot tub for a bit to soak the lower body. While I was sore the rest of the day and night, it was honestly less than I was expecting. This all likely due to the endorphins from the race as on my 18 and 22 mile training runs I was destroyed afterwards. Also shockingly my feet were perfectly in tact with 0 blisters or soreness. \n\nAll in all, it was an amazing event and i'm still in shock I was able to perform so well for my first marathon. I think i'll do another at some point, but for now I plan to take a bit of time off and enjoy my Sundays with no long runs. Thanks for reading!\n\nEdit: Just learning that my watch time and race course time are different and course time is official.
