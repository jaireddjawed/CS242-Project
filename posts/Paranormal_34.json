        "text": "To preface I was raised Pentecostal Christian, I would also like to add that I am still Christian just no longer Pentecostal. For the most part that’s beside the point. However it’s worth noting the phenomenon most often referred to as “signs” or more formally, “fleeces” are characterized as ways of God communicating with you. \n\nI don’t know if I believe in coincidences anymore, or if there’s really meaning to every little thing, but recently there’s been this thing that’s been popping up wayyy too much in my life.\n\nI don’t mean to drag it out or make it excessive, as it’s not the creepy stories you guys are used to - hell, it’s really not creepy or interesting at all - but I’ve been seeing things about the Upper Peninsula of Michigan a lot. I’ve been meeting people from there, seeing things on TV, running across things on the internet (that are not ad-relative), and each time I happen across the subject I get this strong urge to move there, or just go there.\n\nI’m from Alabama, born and raised, my dad was born in Ohio but raised in Michigan. \nI have been all over the country but I’ve never been there, much less the UP.\n\nSo what’s going on? I try to make sense of it, but it’s not advertisements or one of those situations where I’m just recognizing something more. This is genuinely a lot of happenings to be coincidental. \n\nMaybe I’m being stupid, maybe it’s nothing. I don’t know. I just wanna know someone else thinks.",

I wake up, my boyfriend is next to me I can hear him breathing, at the end of our bedroom there’s a big figure standing, facing the bed, I remember I thought he was looking a bit like my boyfriend and dressed weird! He was wearing a sort of white/gray jumpsuit and the thing I can’t stop thinking about is the mask he had covering mouth and nose, like the one that the military pilot wears! My heart started spinning and he while he started to walk towards the bed he vanished like the others up in the air.

        "text": "When I was 8 years old I convinced my mom to buy me an antique vanity. I absolutely fell in love with it. After bringing it home, I constantly felt watched and a very negative, looming energy. Doors would slam and things would fall over. I kept trying to tell my mom about it but she always shrugged it off. After a few years the negative energy calmed down and I still didn’t feel alone but it was much more comfortable. Like we were friends. Once I went off to college, my mom told me that when I was 11 she went in my room and just talked to the vanity and kindly asked the spirit to move on. Apparently weird stuff was happening to her too but she didn’t want to scare me. So that explained why the weird stuff stopped but … she never left. I’m not sure if the spirit just showed empathy for me and my mother and stopped being scary or if there was two spirits? I’m not sure. While I was in college, my brothers girlfriend slept in my room when she would visit and said she felt extremely unsafe. She felt a very heavy sad energy radiating in the room. She said every time she visited she would have horrible nightmares and just wake up crying. once she was able to sleep in my brothers room, this completely stopped. I recently moved back home from graduating college and my boyfriend was helping me move back in. In the middle of us rearranging my room, he stopped and stared at the vanity and just started crying. He said he just felt extremely sad energy coming from the vanity. Similar to my brothers girlfriend. Since moving back home, the energy in my bedroom is completely off. One time I was packing to go visit my boyfriend and I had a full length mirror leaning against the wall next to the vanity that defied the law of physics and fell glass down on the floor. I mean a broken mirror?!?! cmon that’s classic angry ghost horror movie vibes. A few days later I had a yeti full of coffee sitting on my vanity. I was laying in bed doing job applications when my dog woke from a nap, raised her ears and started staring at the vanity. The yeti then flew onto the floor as if someone smacked it. right before my eyes. At this point my mom is freaked out, and a coworker of hers gave me some sage. I know I should use it, but I don’t really want to. This spirit is clearly upset about something but i’m afraid to sage the room and it only make her more upset or offended. Should I just try to talk to her? This whole time i’ve never opened a line of communication between us. We’ve just had this silent understanding as roommates. I dont want to make her more upset, and I don’t want to give her too much power either. What would you do?",

        "text": "Hello, this is my first post on Reddit and my English is not very good. I hope you can tolerate it.\n\nI want to tell you about my experience with some World Cup dreams I've had, I want to make it clear that I'm an atheist and a skeptic so I can't guarantee anything. I will only tell the truth what happened to me and... Has something like this happened to anyone else?\n\nMy first \"vision about the future\" (accuracy: 100%) was when I was 13 at school, I was playing soccer and I see the soccer goal. Suddenly, \"I see my brother banging his head hard.\" Five seconds later, \"what I saw\" happened. I took only a little importance until I remembered that event today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy second \"vision about the future\" (accuracy: 100%) was in a dream, I don't remember what football game I dreamed of but that result came true (I don't remember because I didn't care about it at the time, remember that I'm an atheist and skeptic with those things and more at that time)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy \"second dream\" (accuracy: 100%) was when the team of my country Peru played in 2019, I dreamed that Advincula scored a goal (a player who does not usually score goals due to his position). I was 18 years old, I started in the world of betting, I was tempted by the idea of betting on Advincula scoring a goal... but I was a young man with very little money at the time, so I said to myself \"what's up, it's just a dream. don't waste your money like that.\" So I didn't bet that, but I did on other things that I surely lost lmao the bets are bad. (the match occurred on the same day as the dream)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow QATAR 2022 begins..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy \"third dream\": (accuracy: 50%)\n\n  I dreamed that I went to the living room to watch football... I heard \"goool\" and asked \"who scored a goal???\" France had scored \"3-2\", in my dream England started winning 2-0.\n\nOk, this third dream I didn't hit very well. I'm being totally honest. What was right in this dream was: France scored a tiebreaker, the game was tied with goals and the goal was scored towards the same direction of the screen hehe. Well, and what was wrong: that England started winning. The truth is that at that moment I lost my skepticism a bit with these things, I was sure that it would be fulfilled 100% but it was something innocent to think that. It is difficult to be 100% accurate. (the game was played two days after my dream)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy \"fourth dream\": (accuracy: 70%)\n\nI dreamed that CR7 was angry and the cameras accompanied him to the dressing rooms (oh my god, why did I dream that? I didn't take much importance to it but I did write it down in my memory). In my dream I could also see on the screen that there were two teams, one in white and the other in red. In my dream I only saw angry CR7 and those teams. I didn't see the score, nor if cr7 was angry after the first half, the second half, the overtime, or after the penalties. I thought that this match was probably going to be England-Portugal (in my England-France dream I don't remember hearing the end of the game), I didn't think the Moroccans would frustrate cr7.\n\nWhen I finished the match (I was a bit sad because I didn't hit the France-England match). But I was moved when I saw cr7 crying and how the camera followed him until I almost entered his dressing room (I was sad for cr7 obviously) but what I was seeing on my screen was very similar to what I had dreamed of. CR7 was not angry, he was crying, maybe I dreamed that he was angry because he had never seen Cristiano crying. And then the camera focused on the teams, Morocco in red and Portugal in white... I said: \"Oh my dream was of this match, what happened here? :0\" I wanted CR7 to win (I bet money that CR7 would happen I didn't believe a lot in my dreams back then) Morocco was the one in my dreams it was England in white and Portugal in red. But no, maybe my dreams don't see very long futures now I think, only near futures.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy \"fifth dream\" (unknown)\n\nI dreamed that \"Morocco\" eliminated \"Argentina\" on penalties and that Argentina played badly. We were sad for Messi, but they didn't deserve to win the result was fair.\n\nWhen I finished my dream I said, \"this is impossible\" surely it must be Croatia. So I wrote down the dream in my memory as: \"Croatia eliminates Argentina on penalties, Argentina played badly. Fair result.\"\n\nMy \"sixth dream\" (100%)\n\nI dreamed that Argentina beat Croatia 3-0. The dream was something very quick, there are not many details and I don't remember much.\n\nThe dream ended and I said to myself: \"how strange, I had an ambiguity in my dreams, let's see what happens and I commented my prediction to my friends on wtsp (or penalties and Croatia passes or Argentina 3-0 Croatia) (I'm still skeptical, remember, no is that I am 100% sure that one of these two results would happen)\n\nThen it happened, Argentina thrashed Croatia 3-0 and I was surprised that the exact score was actually met.\n\nNow according to my dreams Morocco will win the World Cup hehe I also had a small dream in which Morocco beat France (a very small dream so I'm not sure, maybe tonight when I go to sleep I can dream something and I'll comment on it)\n\nMorocco may lose against France and I'll look like a fool hehe. In that case my previous dreams have come true, perhaps by coincidence. Anyway, I will publish any dream related to soccer, thanks for reading everything.",

        "text": "In March we moved into our house which was built in 1887. Over the last few months some seemingly harmless things have been happening with more frequency…small things falling in rooms no one is in, lights flickering, small objects moving / appearing / disappearing, strange sounds in the house (including on the stairwell) that aren’t explainable…whenever I hear a sound like that, I stop what I’m doing and listen intently to try to understand what’s causing it. Sometimes as soon as I go back to what I was doing, there’s immediately another sound. I’m starting to worry that somehow by paying attention to what’s happening I’m encouraging it and playing a role in the increasing frequency?\n\nOne other thing happened that I really hope is not related but feels worth mentioning - for context I’m an avid lucid dreamer and I’ve never experienced sleep paralysis: I woke up in the middle of the night a few months ago (this was right before the weird stuff started slowly ramping up) feeling like someone was staring at me (same way my cat can wake me up by staring at me). I open my eyes, and even in the near-complete-darkness I can see a face right in front of my face, staring at me with a huge smile; my head was on the side of the bed so he was like squatting with his hands on his knees next to the bed staring right at me, like he was watching me sleep. I immediately rolled over and tried to wake up my husband while trying to kick up blankets and pillows between me and the man, but my husband won’t wake up for anything when he’s fast asleep and it was pointless - I ended up huddling against his back under the covers and eventually going back to sleep.\n\nI’d like to write off that last part as a dream or something but I feel in my gut that it wasn’t. The “energy” I experienced from the man was not a negative nor a positive one - my sense was that he didn’t think I could see him and was not trying to scare me. I’ve also had a friend who visited the house since that incident say she feels “an energy” in the house but that it doesn’t feel malicious - this was without me bringing up anything that has happened, she said it unprompted, asking me “have you experienced a presence here?”\n\nAny help, advice, insight, or similar experiences would be helpful, thank you!!",

        "text": "One spring night when I was around 13 I was playing in my garden with a friend. I lived in a small bungalow with an overwhelmingly large garden. Large enough to house a WW2 era bomb shelter with a lot of space left over. Towards the far back of the garden were trees, bushes, and a tall metal fence backing onto the opposite neighbour's garden. \n\nIt was pitch black around 10pm when I was messing around with my friend in the garden. This part of the garden is far enough away from the bungalow that any light radiating wouldn't illuminate the area. I turn and look towards the back I saw someone standing there. About 15 feet away from me, standing 7 feet tall, black as anything I have ever seen. It was the shape of a person but something felt off - it was so black it was almost radiating darkness. It wasn't black like the night sky or a smoky apparition, but so much darker than the night around me in that I felt I could reach out and physically touch it. I felt intensely fearful, but I'm not sure if that's because I was generally creeped out or because it was malignant. \n\nI quickly grabbed my friend who was next to me and ran inside as fast as I could. My friend didn't see the same apparition as me, but he saw what he described as 'shapes' in the air right around the tree where I saw this person. Our parents immediately investigated because they thought someone might have broke in, but they found nothing. Afterwards, I had a constant feeling I was being watched until we moved out of the house about a year later.\n\nI'm 27 now and I still think of this. I don't suffer from hallucinations, believe in the paranormal or think ghosts are real. I'm very skeptical and have a bachelors of science in psychology, but I saw something that day I can't explain. The fact my friend saw 'shapes', whatever that means, suggests to me I did indeed witness something strange and didn't suffer from a minutes worth of insanity. \n\nHas anyone had any similar experiences? What are they?",

        "text": "Days ago I’m having a bad dream, realize I’m dreaming and try to wake myself up. During this time I’m thinking “is this carbon monoxide? or the chemicals I mixed?” The night before I had started cleaning, and left my sink full of water and a couple random cleaners, to drain in the morning. I wake up, grab my phone to Google the chemicals (this was my train of thought in 2 seconds and in a daze) and couldn’t see because my contacts were blurry. I type the letter k and accidentally hit enter. A song called “k.” pops up. I close the app and gather myself.\n\nThen before going back to bed, I decide to listen to the song. I’ve never heard of it before. The genre is “DREAM-pop” and I type it into Apple Music. After one big swipe on the lyrics page, I see my name “Kristen” followed by lyrics, something about “I’ve been waiting for you to slip back in bed.” Weird coincidence, right?\n\nA few days pass and I’m wake in bed, scrolling on my phone in the dark. The 2 desktop computers I have for work start booting themselves on. The screens come on, and the time shows 3:03am. I’ve only had these computers 3-4 weeks, but this has never happened. I brushed it off. \n\nA few days after that, I left my computer on after getting off work at 5:30pm. I spent a considerable amount of time in my room while the screen was black “asleep.” I go to bed, wake up the next morning and again am on my phone. I see a light in the corner of my eye and realize the screen came on, as if I clicked a button or moved the mouse. Again, something that has never happened. I freeze for a moment, it goes off in about 7 or so seconds. I check the time on my phone, 6:06am. \n\nI am referencing these times because I thought 3’s and 6’s or 333, 666 whatever were demonic? I don’t know, never looked into it. Anyway.\n\nI brush this off. A couple days later I get off work, take a shower, and go back to my work computer (I work from home if you didn’t figure that out) I look at it and decide to unplug it. I go sit in bed for a moment, and hear a loud THUD to my right, coming from my bathroom not even 2 yards away. At the EXACT time I hear the thud, my phone lights up with the suggested account Reddit: Paranormal. I look at my phone the exact second 6:05pm turned to 6:06pm.\n\nI can’t even make this shit up. Again, I brush it off.\n\nToday, the next morning, I am not thinking about it until I go to pee. I sit on the toilet and in front of me is my shower with the curtain open (like usual) and I see what fell. A bottle that is half full, a body scrub that is almost empty, and a toothbrush. I’m staring at it and ignore it. Until just now, I go to shower. There is NO WAY this shit just fell. The thud was loud, and the bottle would’ve had to knock over the other items in its way. I’ve had the same products in the same spots for a year or so now.\n\nI don’t know, too many weird coincidences. Any ideas?",

        "text": "[22F] This happened yesterday afternoon. I had just gotten through with finals yesterday morning and finished up hockey practice around 4. When I got home, I immediately went to sleep.\n\nWhen I'm just trying to nap i sleep with the lights on. It's worth noting that I haven't been sleeping much with finals going on, so this was the first time in the past week where I've been able to just sleep.\n\nI was in the middle stages of sleep and awake. I was having somewhat of a lucid dream where I was walking in a child's bedroom and I stepped on a toy. As soon as that happened, I woke up to hear a very loud hissing/growling. \n\nEven now that I was awake, I could still hear it. My body could barely move. I was ale to move my head, and then I managed to kick my leg out from the blanket. While doing this, I felt my leg make contact with something that felt like a person. As soon as I hit it, the form of a little girl (didn't see her front or any facial features), leaped like a cat off my bed and appeared to go underneath.\n\nOnce the figure disappeared, I was able to move freely again. Naturally I checked under the bed but saw nothing. \n\nCould this have been a sleep demon? Could this have been sleep paralysis that I coincidently woke up while it was occurring? Forgive me because I'm not familiar with this kind of thing.",

        "text": "There have been several instances I've felt like I'm living in a Truman Show situation, for lack of a better term. For some time there have been events in my life that just make me scratch my head and question things that lack a logical or solidified explanation. For context, I'm a man of science; I've got a bachelor's degree in comparative physiology, a masters in epidemiology, and currently am in medical school. Furthermore I have almost a decade of research experience, and have worked in the science fields for almost the same amount of time. I thrive on data, facts, and evidence and seek the sources for explanations rather than jump to something greater. Though I have many examples of these \"Truman Show Moments\", this one is the one that keeps me up the most and is likely the longest.\n\nThere was this one relative that I had, let's call her Lynn for the sake of privacy, who I had never met, yet was one of my closest relatives. Per my father, she was his cousin, but of his estranged uncle who lived on the opposite side of the country. His uncle/my great uncle, was a shifty man. He worked for the government of Virginia in the 30s through the late 60s, early 70s, but no one really knew what he did. He somehow managed to avoid the WW2 draft despite being selected, which many of our family members found strange, but didn't question it further. Anyways, Lynn was his daughter and she married to a lawyer from NY, but they never had any children and neither of them had any siblings allegedly. She never worked because he was \"traditional\" but she also didn't need to because as a lawyer, did okay for himself. The more bizarre factor here is that no one ever met Lynn, her husband, or either of their sets of parents. A lot of us think it was strange, but at the same time, it did make some sort of sense given her father was estranged from the family. The most that the family had contact with her was through the very rare letter and or phone call. Also, Lynn's husband passed away in the 80s, which has some importance, this will be brought up later.\n\nFast forward to the 90s, when I was born. When my parent brought me home after a couple weeks in the NICU, there was a package from NY addressed to me, not my parents, coming from NY, from my cousin Lynn, filled with clothes, toys, all sorts of things a new parent would have bought for their child. My parents tried to call to thank them, but couldn't get ahold of her, but was unable to. At that point, my father and or mother had not heard from her for a couple of years. How did she know that they were pregnant or I was born? There were no announcements in the newspaper, and no one had contact with her for a couple of years. That was the first odd instance that my parents will acknowledge was absolutely bizarre and puzzled them to this day.Once I was born, she sent me letters and cards with money throughout my years. It was never a significantly substantial amount, I think the biggest one I ever got was $500 for my 18th birthday, but that's not super relevant. I would also get calls from her on birthdays and holidays to wish me holiday greetings, and then I would send her flowers for her birthday, which was March 11th, but no one actually knew how old she was, we just simply knew that her birthday was March 11th and that she was allegedly older than my father, but this wasn't ever confirmed. This is also another important piece, I promise.\n\nThroughout the years I continued to get calls, cards, and letters with money and we always talked about the same thing, the weather, what I was doing, and then about her cat Callie, who always \"signed\" her card next to her indicated by a little cat paw print. We actually asked for pictures of her because we wanted to hang it in our house, but no matter how many times we asked, we only got drawings, which looked like children's drawings. We were perplexed as to why she never sent a photo, especially when we specifically asked for them. The last time we asked for a photo we got a drawing that depicted her as an angel. At this point I was a senior college and had taken some psych courses and had been deep into my studies, so I asked that if there were any developmental issues/mental illnesses that she had or that my parents or family were aware of, which no one said they thought so. She lived on her own independently, except she had a cleaning lady come once a week to do her bedding, which she hated washing and doing. Not to mention the fact that she was starting to get up there in her age since my father was and he was kind of the \"marker\" for her age.\n\nOur second to last phone call, I expressed to her that my father and I wanted to visit her. After all, after over 2 decades of sending money for birthdays, holidays, etc, I felt the need to visit her and thank her in person and learn more about her. She was unsure about it but seemed to come around to it. I said next time we talk we can work out a time that's good for all of us, just to give her some space since she seemed apprehensive to us meeting. The following month was my birthday, which she sent me a check and of course, I called to thank her as I always did. She seemed fine and her normal self. We talked about coming up to NY again to meet her and we agreed on date 3 months away. I'll never forget the last words that she said \"we're always on your side\", which I felt was a little strange because she used to say \"I'M always on your side\", never \"we\". There was no \"we\"; she lived by herself, her cat had passed away at that point, she still had her housekeeper come by, but she still never referred as \"we\".\n\nA week and a half later my dad called me saying that my cousin had passed away, this was in the summer of 2017. I felt awful that I had never met her and she was so interested/invested in my life. I was upset about this but no one seemed to be phased about her passing. When I spoke to my family member, her cousins (my aunts and uncles), they said they hadn't heard from her in decades. Now they also had kids, my generation, but she never ever took an interest in any of them, even some cousins who were older than me. Some of them didn't even know who she was, which just puzzled me even further. We don't even know what she passed from. When I asked my dad about a funeral, he said there wasn't any word on it. When I asked him how he heard about her passing, since no one but me and my parents talked to her, he said it was the hospital who called and informed him. There was no funeral, which further made me scratch my already very puzzled head, but I figured maybe because she didn't have close family, there wasn't going to be a funeral or memorial service. After a period of grievance, I didn't really think of her that much. It's tough to think about someone you've never met, nonetheless know what she looks like, and have only had phone calls with.\n\nOver a year passes by and it's now December 2018 and I get a letter from a law office in NY addressed to me. In the thick manilla envelope was a copy of her will. As I was reading the will line by line I was nodding to myself: $10,000 to her church, that makes sense, $5,000 to her housekeeper, yeah that makes sense, and then I get to the last line. She left me her remaining possessions including her house, its contents, and then there was a second address that I had never seen before. I was so flabbergasted and puzzled. Flabbergasted from the fact that she left me everything, not my parents, nor my father, her closest blood relative, me. Further puzzled, I was not only inheriting one house, but a second that I had never even heard of before. She had never mentioned them in our calls, letters, or cards. She really didn't leave much, just to go to church, get her hair done, and then to her doctors appointments. She usually had her housekeeper help her order things; groceries, household products, etc. I found the business card from the firm that sent me her will. I called the firm and asked to speak with the lawyer that signed the letter attached to her will.\n\nHe was very professional and cordial on the phone and explained that it was the old firm owner that had drafted the will with her and that he never actually met her. I glanced at the date and the will was actually written in 2003, which would have meant I was 7 or so? At that point I don't really recall talking to her. That really didn't start until I was 10, but she still sent cards and I usually wrote a horribly legible thank you card with a drawing and or a photo of me. Anyways, he reaffirmed the will contents and testament was true. I asked if he was aware of a case worker, social worker, anything that could give me more insight, which he replied he wasn't aware. I asked that he give the housekeeper my information and told her to call me and he said he'd pass things along. After I got off the phone with the lawyer, I told my dad about the will and asked about the other property. We had used google street view to see her residential property, the one that all her envelopes were addressed from. It was a nice quaint 1920s bungalow in the suburbs. There was one house across from hers, but there wasn't much else around her other than woods. We looked up the second property and it was in the middle of nowhere, but the house was massive, and according to the tax records, was estimated to be appraised at $1.2 million given it was a lakefront property with 23 acres.\n\nNot even 48 hours later, I was called by a representative from the state of NY stating that they were going to liquidate the property to cover her medical bills. I didn’t quite know how to react so I just responded “okay, let me know if you need any more information” and hung up.\n\nPart of me thinks this is part of some gigantic rouse or Truman show reality and I got too close to the truth and so they burned the ties. This is about as much as I can remember from this part of my life, and it’s still relatively fresh, but I still wonder who/what my cousin was. Was she legit or was she a part of something bigger? I fear that I’ll never find out. I tried to look into her husband; he very much so was a person and it’s well documented, but the interesting part is in his obituary, there were no mentions of his wife or any other family. There wasn’t even a “survived by” section. I feel like I’ll never get answers, but I suppose time will tell.",

I just was calm and thought to myself it will all be gone in the morning and got back to sleep, I don't remember the morning but i was ok in the morning,\nThis felt like another dream.\n\nSo what do you think happened to me there? My theory is that i almost died because like i said remember the light thing like people say the you get to the light at the end of the tunnel when you die and i really felt like dying there and i was half paralyzed when i woke up.\nDoes it happened to someone before? I'm really curious to know what this thing was",

If you aren't familiar with what this device does, it basically measures both EMF and temperature changes in the environment. It has different sensitivity settings and those are measured by a metal antenna sticking out of the device.\n\nFrom me messing with it it seems like even in the most sensitive setting, the EMF field will not be set off unless you are within 5 inches of it. I know what the different tones it makes represent, and the strength of contact is represented by different colored LEDS.\n\n\\*Now for the **WEIRD PART**. I have been able to manipulate the REM-POD on my own while being 6 feet away from it by \"dropping any and all said barriers\". I imagine in my current minds eye a giant white force field made of light that surrounds my home melting away till its gone, and it sets the REM-POD off. Usually the red and purple mini LEDS and the large green LED all at the same time go off and fluctuate for a good 5 to 10 seconds.\n\nI have been able to repeat this exercise 3 times in a row, 2 different times. One of which I demonstrated in a discord call and he said he recorded it haha idk if he did but if anyone cares enough I am sure I can repeat it again or see if he did record it.\n\nIt makes me wonder how much of these ghost investigations are being influenced by the investigators though. ;)\n\nHave any of you tried this with a REM-POD and seen any results?",

As I was trying to *actually* wake myself up, I was thinking “is this carbon monoxide? is it the cleaning supplies I mixed together and left in the sink full of water?”\n\nI woke up and immediately grabbed my phone, still in a daze. I went to Google to type in the cleaning supplies to see if I shouldn’t have mixed it (I don’t know, it made sense in the two seconds this happened) and accidentally typed the letter k. I hit enter (I slept in my contacts and couldn’t see). A song called “k.” popped up. I gathered myself and was going to go back to sleep, until I felt like looking up the song. The genre was “DREAM-pop.” I typed this into Apple Music and did one big scroll on the lyrics. “Kristen” my name popped up. There were lyrics about “I’ve been waiting for you to slip back in bed” or something. I brushed this off as a coincidence.\n\nA few days later, I am awake in bed. I wake up often. Out of nowhere, my desktop starts booting itself up. I’ve only had this computer 3 weeks, so I assume it’s updating. It turns on, the time shows 3:03am. Okay, whatever. \n\nA couple days later I decide to leave the computer on, it was “asleep” since 5:30pm. It never lights up the homepage without being touched. The next morning I am awake in bed on my phone, and see light from the screen pop on. This was for a few seconds, and I decided not to look. I then look at the time on my phone. 6:06am. Another coincidence I guess.\n\nLast night I take a shower, then decide to unplug my computer again. Peace of mind. I sit in bed and hear a loud crash. Something fell in my bathroom. The EXACT SECOND it fell, Reddit: Paranormal popped up on my phone. 6:06pm\n\nThis morning, my power goes out. I leave the closet light on sometimes and see it go out. I go back to sleep, then wake up and it comes back on. I remember thinking, “it must have only been out for an hour, check the time and it’s 7:03am. That one didn’t worry me but I figured I would throw it in there. \n\nThe dream and song weirded me out the most. Thoughts are appreciated",

        "text": "bear with me this may not be the most entertaining story but i can assure you it is my real experience and if anyone else has experienced anything similar please tell me. now that that's out of the way on with the story.\n\nwhen i was in high school i had decided to take a college course over the summer at a college in New York state for early college credits. i am an art student so i wanted to get some of my early art credits out of the way. our dorm buildings were these old looking houses with three floors. i was placed on the second floor with two other students and our RA sharing a room. for context i am a trans person so they put all the trans people in one dorm. i had noticed something was off when i opened the closet at the end of the hallway and there was a line of salt along it. my room was right next to that closet and had a mirror in it. i never liked mirrors. I've always believed in ghosts but never thought I'd experience one. \n\nlater that day we asked our RA about the salt line, and he told us that the building was haunted. He said that he had been here a week before we arrived to prepare and had heard the closet door opening and someone walking down the hallway every night so his solution was to put a salt line down in the closet. He also took it a step further and wrote \"protection symbols\" on the back of our nametags that were stuck to the door. I believe these symbols were pagan? but don't quote me on that. they pretty much roughly translated to telling the ghost to get out and it doesn't belong there. \n\nwe thought he was just messing with us because we were kids, and it was our first college experience, so we shrugged it off. That night i was lying in bed. i had the bottom bunk. and i stared out into the dark. Thats when i saw two red glowing circles that seemed to be in-between the mirror and the window outside. It scared me a little bit but i just decided to go to sleep trying to rationalize that it had possibly been a light from outside. The next morning i went to check out the window. there were only trees. there wasn't a close enough house nearby to be the neighbors and though there was a road where you could hear the cars it wasn't close enough to shine a light in. that same day my other roommate mentioned the blinds moving. despite it being 90 degrees in the middle of summer, no wind, and our fans were off, the blinds moved on their own. \n\nFastForward to Wednesday the whole class took a trip down to a haunted theater for a tour. i thought this was so cool and i recorded every room and everything the guide said on the tour. I've always been interested in this sort of thing and was hoping id catch a ghost on camera (i didn't). that night i was uploading all of the videos into a windows movie maker file. i planned on uploading the whole thing unwatched and unedited to see if anyone saw anything. This took me hours and i was still doing it once 2:30am rolled around. \n\nWhile i was uploading the videos into the file i heard what sounded like a bus stopping outside and leaving it was that sort of hiss that a bus makes when it stops. i thought nothing of it as you often heard cars all night. but the sound returned. The sound got louder and louder to a point where i felt like something was wrong. I wasnt sure what else could make this loud hiss sound so i thought since the house was old maybe it was a gas leak or something i should alert my RA for. my glasses were just out of reach so i had to get off my bed to get them. the second my feet hit the floor the hissing stopped and i felt this pressure and numb feeling kind of like when your foot falls asleep but without the pain. against the back of my legs. this scared the crap out of me so i hopped back in bed until i had the courage to wake up my roommate.\n\ni crawled in bed with her and began feeling the same pressure and numbness on my lower back. i laid there terrified until about 4 am when the pressure stopped and i was able to crawl back in my bed and go to sleep. from that point on i was absolutely terrified of being alone and it got to the point where my RA pulled me aside and told me to get over it because \"one day I'll be alone\" (thanks for fucking with my abandonment issues prick). \n\non the third week it seemed like i would end up by myself so i convinced the RAs to allow me to room with one of the girls upstairs. (they fought me on this because they insisted that if i roomed with a girl they wouldnt be keeping boys and girls seperate and they wanted to respect our gender but kept us seperate from the cis boys. it was weird) from that point on i had zero issues because though we knew the house was haunted, the girl i roomed with had been raised to respect spirits and would often ask before entering the room and thank the spirits for allowing them into the space. this is a behavior that i adopted as well and it was much more peaceful in our room. I have some other smaller additons to the story that other people experianced that i could say in other posts but thats the end of my personal story.",

        "text": "       Hello! I have been living with my dad and his fiance for about 2 months now. Where we're at, we're on native reservation up at the tippy top of the hill. Earlier this year, my soon to be stepmother's ex's daughter was living in the house, as there are two bedrooms and a bathroom down the hall. My room is the master bedroom and it is right across from the bathroom. Let's call the daughter Marie. Marie was in the 2nd bedroom straight down the hall. She was home alone one day and watched a dark shadowy, mist walk in and out from the bathroom to the master bedroom three times. \n       In October, me and my dad were in the living room when he started telling me he saw a shadow walk in my room while he was in the kitchen. I hadn't told told him about Marie's story so, of course, I was pretty spooked. My dad swears the cabinet door under the sink opens for no reason. Like he would be doing dishes, walk away, then when he came back it'd be open. I'm a little skeptical about the door, though. I'm sure there's a logical explanation for that. But two people in this house had IDENTICAL experiences with the shadow. \n       My father asked his fiance if there's ghosts here. She laughed it off then said, \"They're not going to hurt you.\" I've felt off about this whole ordeal ever since. What is the dark shadow/mist?",

        "text": "So here's the story, my husband travels for work, and our 2 dogs and I go with him. In September we moved to a hotel which is one of the best rooms we've ever been in. Like, it's a full apartment. But anyway, almost immediately, I could feel a presence. I wouldn't say I'm a medium, but i am for sure sensitive.  I found a massive portal in the room. Our closet has mirrored doors, and it's facing directly at our bathroom sink mirror, which covers the wall edge to edge. It took a few days for it to appear (the shadow person or spirit), but I eventually caught it out of the corners of my eyes here and there. But lately, it has been showing itself to me more and more. The reason I believe it's attached to my husband is because he's not as much of a believer as I am and also under much more stress (with work and being a provider to our family) which makes him an easier target. I've seen  smack marks on his chest, like deep red hand prints that actually swell, while he's asleep! I watched it appear in front of my eyes as he kind of jumped, and i looked over and noticed the fingerprints and redness show up! I've caught shadows standing over him multiple times, and most concerning, his mood has been all over the place. He can kiss me one second and be screaming the next. And it's been getting worse and worse by the day. I spoke to the spirit, very simply I told it to leave him alone and that it wasn't allowed to attach to him. But I wanted to get others' opinions. Would it be safe for me to use a spirit talker alone to figure out what or who it is and its intentions? I'm away from family and friends where we are and he's all I have but seeing as to how he isn't a believer it's hard to get him to participate, i figured id have to do it alone. Before I make any moves, I want to be sure it's safe for him and our fur babies. I don't want to open any extra doors. Please help!",

        "text": "\n This isnt a long story the whole experience probably lasted 10 minutes or so. But it happened right in front of me and 3 other friends.\n\n June 9,2000 11pm Me and 4 other friends arrived at the park pavillion to for our high school senior graduation party called sober grad night. They have it because alot of kids in our town of 11,000 at the time have died in drunk driving accidents on the highway or the country roads.\n\nThe school puts on the party and its full of teachers,parents, lots of food,a DJ, and raffle prizes at the end so you cant leave early if you want to win. It lasts until 4am. And so at 4am me and 4 friends leave.\n\nMe and another friend live nearest to the park so we drop 1 friend off. Now we are on the way to my house but its a few minutes off in the country. We are on this narrow road with no shoulders, no street lights,no houses in sight, surrounded by darkness,fog and empty fields for miles.\n\nIn the headlights on the left side of the road we see this lady. I remember a light colored shirt,long hair,and she was walking at a fast hurried pace with her arms folded in front of her. We had to pass her no matter what because my house was past her.\n\nWe were all creeped out and i commented something like is this lady on drugs, my 3 other friends were like WTF?. It reminded me of the ring lady,or the grudge. So we drive pass but we slow down a bit to look at her.\n\nI remember seeing her face and was surprised it wasnt an older grown woman at all. I saw the face of a very young girl and she seemed shorter somehow than the grown woman we thought she was.\n\nWe pass her and start talking about what we shoud do. I figured she was lost and we should at least ask if she needed help or a ride. We also were worried a drunk driver may hit her,there is no light out there.\n\nWe pull up next to her and asked if she needed help. She says she was at a party and left and was trying to get back to town. I told her she was walking the wrong way and would get lost and we could take her to town if she wanted a ride. She says yes and gets in the back. She is sitting in the middle next to me and my other friend.\n\nTown is just a few minutes away and we start talking to her. She looks about 15-16, she has long brown hair its kind of curly. She says she goes to our high school but we've never seen her before. We all have older and younger brothers,sisters,cousins and we usually know everyone or who they hang out with.\n\nWe ask her whose party she was at because we go to them to or we thrown them. We dont revognize the name she says. We ask who her friends are, she names 4 people we dont know either. The car light inside is on so I can see everyone. And what happens next it was weird.\n\nMy friend in the front passenger comments on the can of beer she is holding in her lap. I look down and she is holding a beer with both hands on her lap,it was a budweiser. My friend asks where she got it and she says her friend at the party gave it to her.\n\nThe beer can was from the late 80's or early 90's. The cans in our time the label was sideways not straight where you can read the label if the can was on a table my friend says he hasnt seen that can since he was 8. But we kind of forget about it and we are close to town.\n\nWe arrive at the first gas station we see. Across the street is an old factory thats as old as the town.Its fenced with barb wire on top and the gates are closed. The gas station is empty with no cars, the town is dead and silent. I get out and the girl gets out.\n\nShe walks past me and its like she pays no attention to the gas station or the pay phone. I call out to my friends and tell them to watch her because i didnt know what she was doing, she start walking across the street towards the old factory. She is still about 20 feet from us and she just disappears and it was instant like she teleported.\n\nI get back in the car and it is quiet, i have no idea what just happened. And my friend thats driving says \"do any of you guys remember her face?\" And Im trying to remember but i forgot already, and we all start yelling and freaking out. But it felt more like we saw a crazy magic trick or a prank or we got punked like the tv show. It wasnt too scary. I still dont know what I saw but people and high school kids have died on that road. And I remember the girls face now.",

        "text": "It's been a little while since I wrote about my house that may or may not be haunted (its haunted). And the latest incident is definitely worth writing about. What happened defies rational explanation, and what’s even better, I have a witness (fiance), so at least I know I am not losing my shit. If you want to read some earlier events, please see some of my earlier posts. In short, my current residence was formerly a bar/clubhouse for veterans of foreign wars. \r\n\nThis past Friday, I was preparing to go to a fancy Christmas party in a somewhat far away city, meaning I would be gone for a few days to enjoy my time away from home. I planned on wearing the obligatory red and black flannel shirt to keep up with the Christmas theme. That morning, I put the shirt in the wash. This act was very conscious, because having this shirt was the entire purpose of running one last load of laundry. This shirt is the focus of the story. \r\n\nAfter the washer was done, my fiance put the clothes in the dryer. When it was done, I picked through the dryer looking for my shirt. Couldn’t find it in there. Looked in the washer. Maybe it got stuck in the washer. Nope. I then took each piece of clothing out of the dryer to find it. It just wasn’t fucking there. It was as if it teleported to another universe. I was getting frustrated, not yet thinking about anything paranormal. I retraced all my steps in case I just dropped it. Right as I was beginning to think my resident ghost/ghosts were screwing around with me, my fiance came home from getting her hair done. She assured me she did not move or hide the shirt, and joined me on the search. She came up empty handed in this effort. \r\n\nBy this point, it was time to leave, and I really felt thrown off my mental balance. Even though it was just a shirt, I was feeling toyed with. Or maybe, my ghost didn’t want me to leave. When we were walking out the door, I joked that when we got back, the shirt would be folded up in plain view. \r\n\nFast forward to today. I opened the dryer door to fold the rest of the laundry that I left inside (from the load I washed before leaving on my trip). And, to my surprise, guess what shirt was sitting right on top of the pile? It was the red and black plaid shirt. In plain view. Both me and my fiance already looked in there! \r\nWhat’s more, when I took it out, I could tell that it had not even been washed! It was still dirty. This means it poofed out of the washer, didn’t even get washed, and then somehow wound up in the dryer. It vanished before it got clean, then reappeared in the dryer. This means it vanished out of the dryer, went to god knows where, and then three days later appeared in the same place where two different people already carefully looked. \r\n\r\nIf someone else wasn’t there to share this experience every step of the way, I would swear I was losing my shit. Nothing about this can be explained rationally.",

        "text": "My niece several years back when I was living in a pre war apartment always tell me about people in my apartment that I haven’t seen. \n\nOne time she’d say while eating dinner, why didn’t we prepare a plate for the man dining with us? It’s a pretty huge round table that sits twelve, that time there was my sisters family, my adopted daughter and anothe guest. There was just 10 of us. He questioning made us all look at each other while she was telling us in detail how the old man look. \n\nOne time he was talking about this little girl who looks really pale asking her to play with her. We were the only two people in the house that time since her family went out to shop. I told her that she can play with her so long as she will just stay in the living room and not go where ever the little girl is asking her to go. Years later when I left the compound and move to a house on the suburbs, I had the chance meeting with the old guard in the apartment compound and on a whim I just asked him if there’s someone who died in my particular apartment I used to live. He said two tenants before me had a child, who passed away of a terrible sickness. She was 12 when she passed away. She was the same age of my niece. \n\nI live on the top floor of the apartment complex. There were about four buildings, originally each has only three floors. They added two mor floors before the was started. I was on the goth floor. Elevators are with those safety grill gate first the you have to close them two small wooden doors that when close triggers the motor to run. It is so small that it only hold maximum 3 people. You have to hold the door the it’s lovely ng otherwise it will stop. That’s true to all elevators on all building. I think it was a safety thing so kids will not play or be able yo use it. Anyway one time there was just me and my niece inside because everyone went ahead before us, while I gather the stuff from my car. Thanks n the way up she told me middle of the trip up that there’s an old lady with us and if I should ask her which floor so she can push the button. All the hair in my body seem to be standing on its end. To be honest, I always felt that presence every time I use that elevator but I just don’t give it enough thought until that day. I ask my niece how she looks and very vividly in my opinion she did describe someone because she described even the detail of her shoes which she said had gems on it.. the the one one the left shoe is missing one piece. Who would imagine that at age12? I have so many stories about my nice and me in that apartment.\n\nWill add some more every so often. \n\nShe’s now a grown woman with a little cute young son who I think inherited her “gift”.",

Nobody would be there when I'd go check. \n\nThe television again turned on with no one around. \n\nThen, I thought I heard my wife come up the stairs and enter our nursery, which connects via a doorless archway into the master bedroom. I called to her and ran down the hall because there was something I wanted to say. I went in to the nursery, which was pretty dark as no lights were on and it was night time. I saw a person whom I thought was my wife walking from the nursery in to the bedroom. I saw their side profile, which appeared to be a young woman about my wife's size. I quickly followed in to the bedroom calling her name, only to realize there was no one and my wife was downstairs. \n\nSince this last event, there has been nothing for 2 months.

As the disclosure states at the beginning, the necklace is not loose enough to fit past his ears and forehead without squeezing his ears and eyes (while closed).  We all have pieces of jewelry that we really have to squeeze to get it on or off. The necklace was bought by his friend's mom. This is where I feel scared. Christmas is in a few weeks so I bought him a chain long before this ever began. I wrapped it in a box. And secured it with ribbon and a glue gun. Personally I thought his necklace was a little ugly so I bought him a stylish chain. The chain is still in the christmas wrapping (to my knowledge). Do yall think spirits are messing with his old ugly necklace? When he opens his gift on Christmas he might feel creeped out. 😭 Our relationship HAS been rocky. And I believe in praying to the ancestors. Sometimes I ask them why cant they guide my boyfriend to meet a new woman. I believe they know he is head over heels for me. I think they want me to give him the chain. But not after they creeped both of us out! Also, he took the (ugly) necklace off tonight and he jokingly said, \"I better not wake up with it on (the ugly necklace)\"\n\nI will update you all if the necklace is on him when we wake up.",

It’s 03:55 in the morning in the UK and I’m posting here because I can’t sleep. \n\nRecently, I’ve been seeing 11:11 everywhere I look, as well as other number like 12:12, but it’s mostly been 11:11. At first I thought it was a strange coincidence, however after doing a bit of research I seen talk of spiritual awakening, cool I thought. I’m going through some big life changes just now so could do with being more self aware etc \n\nHowever. I’ve also noticed weird things going on in my house recently. Since having our son (who’s now 5) we’ve had strange things happen, such as blinds opening themselves and musical toys going off in the middle of the night but nothing has happened in a few years. But recently I’ve been hearing footsteps and here is why I’m writing this post. \n\nThe other day whilst I was having a shower I could hear footsteps, strange I thought. Maybe my partner had gotten up to get something. Turns out she was fast asleep and messaged me in the morning when she left for work to tell me the weirdest thing happened to her, she said that whilst I was in the shower something shook her awake and gave her a fright. When I told her that at the same time I was hearing footsteps we were both a bit freaked out. \n\nAt 03:15 this morning I woke to the sound of heavy footsteps in my house, a new build, so not an old building or anything. I done a check around the house, son was asleep, cats were asleep, I thought someone had broken in but found that the smoke alarm was keeping, turns out it’s running out of battery. The thing is, my partner, who is a big skeptic and laughs at me when I tell her stories also heard the footsteps running up and down the stairs. \n\nI’m trying to take comfort from this, and hoping that the footsteps were just someone coming to tell me about the smoke alarm, which I’m thankful for. However, I’m freaked out and now can’t sleep. \n\nDoes anyone have a suggestion as to what would have caused this, or what’s going on? Is it all just a big coincidence and my mind is playing tricks on me?",

I don't usually see spirits so I said something to them. We did some divination (pendulum and cards) that gave us some ideas about him.\n\nWe've had our suspicions for a while that the upstairs neighbor is involved in trafficking. He likes to take young native girls home that are seen for a few days and then just gone forever. It's the bad side of town in a very rural state, right next to the reservation.\n\nWe found the spirit's identity in the missing persons list from a city a few hours away. When we called his name the energy became more focused and we were able to communicate with him via pendulum. We know when he died and a vague idea of how, and all the spirit's rage is pointed upstairs; he's on good terms with the members of the coven.\n\nI asked it if I could be shown where the body is and got a yes. It's on the property, I think in one piece but maybe not immediately recognizable as him. I feel like I'm in a fucking TV show; my friends are trying to hustle to move out of that house and idk whether to submit a police report or not because all I have to work with rn is \"the ghost of this missing kid swung my pendulum in a circle so now I know he's in the shed\".\n\nAll this kid wants is for his family to have closure. He still hasn't had a funeral, he's been missing for months. If any of you have some practical advice I'd appreciate it. I want my friends to be safe.",

When I first arrived here I felt something wrong with this place. First night is as usual  I am shifting my laugage and other stuff.\n\n2ND NIGHT: There is this park in front of my house the park is not very big. I was sitting there smoking the time was around 8 o'clock. I finished my cigarettes and went to a nearby shop for some snacks and returned home on my way in front of my house there was 4 chairs and a car parked in front of one chair. There was nobody around not a single soul. I saw as some grabbed the chair and moved it the movement of the chair is so smooth as someone lift the chair and the place it gentle. I don't know what thing got into me i just kept staring at it and there is like some noise in my head saying \"go sit on the chair\"\n\nNote: I live in Islamabad capital of Pakistan and the entire city is on hills and my house i like the corner of the town and behind my house is long hills with nothing but a creepy environment \n\n\n3RD NIGHT: On the third night I am just using my mobile and the time is between 1am to 2am. I am just thinking about my previous incident and in the blink of an eye i saw a black figure in the corner of my room. I don't pay so much attention to it and started using my phone. My room is pitch dark All lights are off however the figure i saw earlier was somehow clearly visible to me. I decided to go to sleep as soon as I was going to sleep I heard the sound of someone crushing its teeth the sound is so loud and clear that someone is lying beside me. The sound stops suddenly and i felt like some inhale besides me the whole night i felt the feeling of someone laying with me i was so creeped out and tell my parents as you all know they won't believe me\n\n\n\nCan you suggest to me what this thing is and if you experience the same",

        "text": "So I'm hoping to find out if anyone else has experienced this:\n\nWhen I was in highschool, I had a friend who was sensitive to spirits. I didn't take her seriously until one day I got a call from her around 5am. Her voice was shaky and short. She asked me to come over. I begrudgingly got my ass up to go see her. She sounded like something was wrong, I just couldn't tell what.\n\nWhen I got there I entered her room to find her sitting atop her bed with her back against the wall and her arms cradling her knees to her chest. My first thought was a sexual assault as I still didn't believe ghosts were real. I sat near her and asked what was wrong and she proceeded to tell me that spirits in her house wouldn't let her sleep. Usually she was able to shoo them away but that night she said that they did not stop. She told me there were multiple spirits in her house but the one bothering her was an old man.\n\nI didn't really know how to respond at first so I just sat for a while and then I realized she hadn't taken her eyes off a corner on the other side of the room and I asked her about it. She hesitated at first then told me it was still there. Well, that was it for me, if there was a ghost in the room, I wanna touch it. First I looked at the corner and was surprised when I heard movement. Like something or someone was standing right there and moving about which was impossible as I was LOOKING at the room and there was NOTHING there.\n\nSo I stood up to start walking across the room and the first step I took sent a jolt of electricity through me and all the hairs on my body stood up like when you were a kid and slid down a tunnel slide and felt all the static electricity around you. Now that's where I got a little freaked out bc it wasn't cold, I was properly clothed, I wasn't scared, nothing. It was so random and with every step closer, the feeling intensified and soon I was right in front of the spot.\n At this point I was having an internal war with my instincts bc every single alarm in my head was sounding off. The closer I got, the faster I wanted to run and as I stood there, I still heard the movement like something was trying to stay very still so as to not be detected. As I stared at that spot, I started to see something that to this day, I have only heard described the same by Zak Bagans on an episode of GA. At the time I remember thinking it looked like something out of the scene in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone where Harry puts on the invisibility cloak. Like something was standing there with the cloak on. A shimmery sort of veil. On GA it was described like the camouflage ability of Predator. Has anyone else experienced this?",

        "text": "I say it's potential because I can't say for certain if it is what I thought it was at the time. I recently wrote about this event to my college Creative Writing course, and it made me really want to get it out to a bigger audience maybe. I have other experiences, too, if you guys like this one and want to hear more.\n\nThis experience takes place in my old house about thirty or so minutes away from where I currently live. It's a small house, and at the time I shared a room with my older sister. Well, my sister had been gone that day to visit a friend and my parents had left to go shopping, so I was completely alone. It was broad daylight outside, and I had Pandora playing on the TV in my bedroom. It was possibly the least scariest atmosphere. I wasn't scared of being home alone. I was quite at peace, actually. But that's when they like to get you, yeah? When you're most vulnerable? That's when they like to show themselves.\n\nWhat I'm about to describe might seem like a simple shadow from an actual person walking by. That's what it looked like at least. My bedroom is small, and there are two windows -- one above my bed that faces the little space between my house and my neighbor's house, and the window beside my sister's bed that faces the vast backyard. Clear as day -- the visual remains as clear as that day in my head -- I see a dark shadow, shaped like a person, cross from one side of the window to the other. Both windows have blinds and sequined, sort-of-but-not-entirely see-through curtains. As a child, my first instinct had been that my neighbor had passed by. It had sort of looked like him. He had been an older, bald man. So at first I wasn't THAT scared. I simply approached my window over my bed -- we shared a trundle bed and mine was on the floor -- and peeled back the curtains, flipping one of the blind slats up so I could view outside.\n\nHowever, there was no one outside. No one in the little space between our houses. And when I checked the other window, there was no one in the backyard either, which had been the direction the shadow had been moving. \n\nThe thing about it being the neighbor is that he didn't really have a reason to be in our backyard. His own was fenced in, and it stretched all the way across the yard, and the gate was all the way at the back, near a set of small woods -- just a bunch of trees that was across from the gate and beside the house that was at the end of our backyard, up a very small hill. From the time it took for me to check both windows, he didn't have the time to go all the way across the yard and into his fenced-in yard and all the way back into his house. \n\nSo what had it been that I'd seen? A shadow person?",

But he does believe in spirits, and so he explained that he might think that something spirit wise could be the cause of the scratches. At first I thought he was joking so I was laughing and when I caught on that he was being serious, it made me kind of mad but only because that stuff kind of scares me and creeps me out. \nAnyways what do we do? He comes home for Christmas holidays this weekend and I’m now scared he could probably bring something home with him. And I definitely don’t want that. So what should he do? What should I do?",

My psychiatrist believes that they are caused by a traumatic event in the past which is kinda true , I've been through hard times recently and a while ago . You may ask what is paranormal about this? I remember every single word of my dream characters , every single movement, smell , music that I hear . places that I've been in my dream are familiar but I've never been in them in real life . Characters seem familiar but they are not even human?!! Some are even invisible and I can totally feel their existence and I can communicate with them but we don't even talk . Feelings are so extreme. I feel pain in my dreams but in a much worse way. Sometimes it feels like I've been 4 months in my dream world which is so annoying.  I see the same characters over and over and we somehow use a nonsense language and communicate.  Once I dreamed about a day of my life , it is so ridiculous, I woke up brushed my teeth checked my phone worked on my university project surfed the net etc. the next day all that happened once more and I figured that out at the end of the day . It was so strange , I an truly fed up with these dreams.",

I got a call at the police station about a nearby bank robbery, so I rushed over to the scene. But...turns out, it wasn't a human robbing that bank, it was a superhuman. pale skin that dangled from it's bones and black eyes, tentacles coming out of it's back, and that wasn't even the mysterious part. The thing started attacking all 5 of the cops on patrol. I hid behind the trading desk and signaled for backup. the thing was picking up money with it's tentacles and putting them in a duffel bag swung across it's unusually thin arm. I'll never forget what this superhuman did to the bank teller. The bank teller ran out from behind the trading desk and started calling for help, but then the thing threw its neck to the side, and the bank teller's skin disappeared in the blink of an eye! I was watching it. One second he's calling for help, next second, he's a skeleton wearing clothes. A bunch of spiders crawled out from the vents and made a web that the bank teller was attached to. Then the superhuman picked me up with a tentacle and threw me away before injecting the tentacles back into his body and grabbing a coat out of his duffel bag and wore in, drawing the hood so nobody could see his appearance. Nobody believed us, and it was announced as a bank robbery by an unidentified person.",

When I moved I took one and told my mom I don't want to take both. For the next 3 years up until I was 12 I always felt so uncomfortable and finally stuffed it in the back of my closet till one day I found it on the bottom of my closet and then decided to throw it away. Since then I never felt any bad vibrations but to this day always feel like those dolls were haunted. Even with my own play dolls growing up I never felt that way.

        "text": "I’m from a small town in rural Georgia. I grew up there and most of my best childhood memories derive from there, particularly from my grandparents house. My family and I lived behind them for all of my adolescence from the time my parents married to about 4 years ago now, when my mom and dad decided to move in to it. My grandma had long been passed on and it’s my dads childhood home and he wanted to spend the remainder of his life there, or at least as long as he and my mom can live on their own. \n\nMy wife and I don’t live in the same state but we stay there every other time we go to visit. It’s refreshing to spend a few days in that house where I did so much of my growing up. However, a couple years ago we had a very strange experience that I haven’t really shaken yet.\n\nMy grandparents moved into the home back in the fifties with the children they had at the time (my dad is the youngest of 10, and he wasn’t born yet) and even then it was an old house, so at this point it’s around a hundred years old. By the time my dad was a kid, most of his siblings were no longer living there, other than my uncle and one of my aunts I believe. He had one particular bedroom to himself. \n\nAs you walk through the front door of the house, it leads you into a hallway that goes all the way to the back of the house, and all the rooms just branch off from the hallway except for the staircase that leads upstairs to other bedrooms that haven’t been used in years other than for storage. My dads old bedroom was the very last bedroom at the back of the house, by what use to be the back door. \n\nNow mind you, this was a part of the country in an era where they didn’t really worry about locking their doors back then. My dad has told my siblings and I, along with some cousins of mine some stories about some experiences he had in that room that he’s never been able to explain. For instance, my dad has always slept with the covers up to his neck ever since he was a kid; even now as an old man. He’s reiterated that this was a rare occurrence, but as a kid he experienced having an odd sensation that someone was in there with him, even when everyone was in bed asleep. He swore that sometimes it felt as if the covers were being pulled tighter around him. There were even times that it felt like the top of the cover he kept over his shoulder was tightening around his neck. He also says that at times he felt like he could see a man standing in the corner watching him. \n\nNow as a former kid, I can rationalize how a child can think he/she might see things that aren’t there. Even as an adult I still feel like that sometimes if I’m being honest. However, my dad described these figures he’s see in his room as sometimes seemingly moving towards him while lying in bed. To add to that, he says he never could make out any faces of any of the figures, or any distinct physical features that he could remember, but he could always see their eyes.\n\nNow, fast forward like fifty something years, my wife and I are visiting from out of state and decide to stay with my parents. I believe it was spring time so it was relatively comfortable weather in the south. I bring this up because my grandparents old house has no universal heating or air conditioning, or at the time it didn’t. At that point my parents had only been living in the house for a few months and the house had been vacant for some time while they were renovating, and it can get pretty hot or cold depending on the time of year in there.\n\nThere are about three bedrooms on the ground level of the house and a few more up stairs, but only a couple are set up for sleeping in comfortably: my parents bedroom, and my dads old bedroom. We slept in there the first night pretty comfortably, no issue. The next night did not go that way.\n\nWe all went to bed around 1am that night; my folks along with us are night owls so we never rush to bed while there. Once we laid down, she fell asleep relatively quickly, while I was still awake laying there next to her in bed. For about a half hour I laid there with a weird sense of uneasiness. I can’t explain it, just didn’t feel comfortable like the night before. I rolled over and put my arm over my wife as she slept and laid there like that for a minute. It was dark but my eyes were adjusted enough and the light from the moon that night illuminated the room pretty well. We had a blanket we were sharing that was covering up both of us. \n\nNow once my wife was asleep she didn’t really move much from her position she fell asleep in originally. With eyes wide open, still pretty awake and aware, I watched as our blanket was pulled away from over top of us. It was done in a gentle but quick motion and left me not knowing how to respond. I had no words. I sat up in bed feeling around my wife thinking maybe she had pulled it in her sleep with her hand, but in the direction it was pulled (downward and away from our torsos) there was no way she could’ve done that. I accidentally woke her up and she asked me what I was doing, and I tried to tell her it was nothing, but she knew something had me spooked. I finally told her after she had dragged it out of me, and she responded saying,” I think we should get out of this room.”\n\nThe next morning we told my parents and my sister, who was not living there at the time and they didn’t seem surprised. My mom tried to rationalize it but I’m pretty certain with what I saw. It made me feel silly and I started to question the whole thing and whether or not I was just imagining it… then my sister told us of her experience.\n\nAwhile before that she was briefly living with our parents and staying in that room by herself. She had a television and DVD player set up in there (this area is out there in the sticks so no Wi-Fi at the time) and she’d just watch movies when the folks went to bed. She had a night when the tv kept shutting off randomly for no reason. This kept happening, then she felt a presence walk into the room. Now the lights were on so there’s nothing hindering her vision. She swears that on the corner of the bed, the same bed we slept in, she saw something put pressure on it as if someone sat down on it. It was only for a brief moment but it came and went. She had not told us or the folks about this until the day after our incident. These are only a few of the stories of people having strange experiences in that house.\n\nWe still go and visit while staying in the house and nothing else has happened in a few years. Hopefully it stays that way… but we have not since slept in dads old bedroom.",

        "text": "Hey guys, I had a weird experience about a year ago that I wanted to share and maybe get your thoughts from. I had been living with a friend of mine, and his step dad was supposedly being haunted by some sort of negative entity. I have always been a sort of spiritually minded person and was secretly trying to establish contact with said entity about a week (just mentally reaching out and feeling for it, calling it out- in a friendly way).\n\nOne night, I went to bed with my girlfriend and I began to fall asleep. You know how sometimes before you get into deep sleep how you can sort of dream, but still be aware? Like before fully going into rem, maybe see something menial like walking down a sidewalk and then you trip and jerk awake within maybe 10 minutes of falling asleep?\n\nWell, I saw kind of a top down view of the house- sims style, no roof. I saw a creature in the house, down the hall from the bedroom. It was pitch black, tall (8/9 ft), thin but broad shoulders. Horned. No eyes that I could see. I saw it skitter VERY quickly, up the door. I heard a knock, and I said come in. At this point I actually woke up, and saw the thing in front of me.\n\nMy mind was a bit foggy, I don't know if it actually opened the door, the door was open already, or if it phased through, but everything was blurry as I woke up right after the knock.(I said hello to it, and thinking it may be related to the haunting of my friends stepdad I was nice. Just a tad scared, but tried not to let it show. It was looking at me (no eyes) and I felt like I might be able to communicate with it and it vanished.\n\nI woke my girlfriend up by saying hello, and I explained what I saw. Anybody got any ideas as to what it could have been?? \n\n\nAny one have any idea what it could have been?",

        "text": "This story happened at one of my more recent job places. Sit tight… this one still gives me the chills.\n\nI worked at a boarding facility for dogs and cats. From day one stuff was… off. The first thing I noticed weird, was hearing a voice right behind me, and when I turned around seeing no one there. Understandable enough, with 20-70 dogs barking all around me for their lunch or play time/potty breaks. \n\nI kept discarding these things… until one day, from on top of a low kennel, a partially filled water container, like the ones you use to water plants with (and we used to fill water bowls) flew at me. No way a dog could have hit it and sent it somehow flying horizontally at me. It missed me by an inch or so… I felt the breeze of it flying past me as I walked by. And it hit the kennel across from where it was located- HARD.\n\nI knew something was up then, but still hadn’t paid it much mind. Shortly after, I noticed the metal doggy doors that lead from each kennel into an outside run would start swinging when I entered the kennel to clean. Or for anything really. I would look at the doggy doors ok both other sides- no motion from them. If I stepped out of the kennel, the door would stop swinging. \n\nWell, nothing new for me to experience weird shit, so what is one more story to add to the list, right? One day, a coworker got mad at me and called me. She said she saw me through the window, and asked why I didn’t go back and talk with her for a bit? I answered with the fact that I wasn’t, nor had I been, anywhere near work that day. \n\nShe thought I was kidding, went to the front desk to ask, and was told that no one, in fact, had been through at all for the past couple of hours. This happened 3 times, with different co-workers, where they would see me from another room or yard, and ask why I never stopped to talk. On days I wasn’t at work.\n\nThis eventually progressed. I was moved up to being the bather for our location, so a lot of dog baths and loud dryers going for the pups. And I kept seeing, every time I was bathing a dog, my manager (and then friend), and also the person whose voice I heard the most when no one was near me, standing by my side. \n\nShe would stand there, waiting for me to turn around and turn off the dryers so I could hear her. And once I did and turned towards her… no one was there. She would be busy with clients, or not even in the building. At this point, some of us girls had already been discussing the weird shit going on. One friend and I said, roughly at the same time, “oh, the mimic”/“oh the imitator?” We looked at each other and smiled nervously. \n\nWe had never talked in depth about this stuff, because c’mon. How many people would even take us seriously? It turns out 2 other girls had heard or seen me or manager more than once when we weren’t there, or it wasn’t us. \n\n2 more things stuck in my memory about this place. \n\nOne- we had a storm which lead to power flickering on and off. From reception to the back kennel area, where most of the activity seemed to happen, was visible through a large window so clients could see where their fur babies would be kept. As the lights flickered, 3 of us stood in reception past our shift in case we had an emergency. 2 of us were facing that window. Both of us, at the same time, saw a fast, non-identifiable shadow thing rush past the window even higher than the top of the kennel doors. Which, by the way… are 6 ft tall. We saw this twice during the light flickers. \n\nThe second thing that stuck was this… we had radioes. We just often forgot to use them or even turn them on. One of my co-workers was outside with the daycare dogs (dogs there just to play for the day) when her radio clicked, a voice she did not recognize say “Spots mom is here for pick-up” and cut out. She went to answer, only to realize her radio wasn’t on. She got that dog ready and took him to the front, where the receptionist said she didn’t call for him. She didn’t have any radios on either. \n\nWe still don’t know what it is or was we experienced… but we do know it was out of the ordinary.",

        "text": "Last night I was watching a movie about making the most of your life and the people who are in it with my EX (who I am friends with) at around 8AM.\n\nAround the end of the movie the lead actress was talking about how we shouldn’t be cooped up in our shallow dreams and instead concentrate on the people who are in our lives that we’re lucky to have, the accomplishments we’ve made for ourselves and that we should be grateful.\n\nAfter she finished her sentence I heard a male voice whisper “you should take a lesson from this” in my ear. My mother tongue is Turkish so I heard “bundan ders çıkarmalısın”. There is no way my ex whispered this to me because his mouth was stuffed when I heard it.\n\nI’ve been feeling kind of lost and out of place in life for a bit now, trying to find where I would fit in and which one of my dreams I should be pursuing and where I would be most happy. So its really interesting that I heard something like this, it feels as though I got in contact with some higher energy.\n\nPlus this is the first time I’ve experienced something paranormal, I know it sounds small but it had an impact on me.\n\nAnd icing on top, 2-3 minutes later my mom knocked on my door and asked me if I was the one who knocked on her door. Whilst I was in the middle of the movie.\n\nAny thoughts or comments?",

        "text": "You can check my profile for the full story, but I'll give a brief tl;dr.\n\nMy wife is having major issues with a potential spirit? Ghost? Something? Visiting her in her dreams and telling her to \"cry\", amongst other things I'm not allowed to know, apparently.\n\nMy wife recently had surgery and after that, we moved into this current house which is close to 200 years old. No Idea on the history. The house is generally very quiet and only a few strange 'paranormal' occurrences have happened.\n\nI have read online (and been unkindly told) that I should get a priest, but would that only help with the household paranormal activity? What about the stuff going on in my wife's brain? How do you stop a spirit/ghost/whatever from being in a dream? I get burning sage in a room I guess, but you can't burn sage inside someone's skull. How do you seance a brain?",

It wasn’t intentional, and I had never overslept before. \n\nOut of nowhere, I heard my dad’s voice sternly call out my first name. I jerked awake at the sound. No one was there. \n\nI should clarify that my dad is alive, but was across town from where I live. It wasn’t like a dream, the sound was external, and made me jump. It sounded like my dad was standing over my bed. \n\nI have no explanation for this. Any ideas?",

        "text": "This happened to me some years back. Before I was married (to my Christian wife) I used to be into the  paranormal and black magic and witchcraft. Still am but obviously don't do it because of my wife.\n\nI was alone in my (back then) house. Sitting on the couch in the living room reading a book about black magic. Not a spell book but a book about all different magic and rituals demons and what not. When I hear loud thuds coming from the bathroom. Of course this freaks me out and I slowly close the boom. Then think to myself it was probably just the cat. So I go look and I see all the bottles of shampoo and conditioner 3 in total had fallen or been pushed off the shelves and into the tub. I don't see the cat and all other doors were closed and I didn't see the cat run off. So this freaks me out even more and my heart starts to race. I put the bottles of shampoo back on the shelf. Close the bathroom door and go to the living room, grab the book and put it away in my room. Go back to the living room and sit there in silence wondering what had happened. Then I hear scratching at the door. This is what my cat did when he was outside and wanted to come in. Naturally I get freaked out get up, open the door. And the cat runs in the house. Now I'm scared realizing that my cat was not in the house when the things fell over. I put the book in my closet and never open it again until eventually I decide to throw it out.",
