        "text": "I saw a poster a few days ago that stated simply: War Destroys Families. Like many from her generation, my nmother was seriously impacted by WWII. I know it doesn’t excuse the way she has chosen to live her life. But I do think about how painful her childhood must have been, being emotionally and physically neglected due to her parents’ preoccupation with survival during the war and repercussions after it was over, the deaths of her brothers, the way it probably formed her view that the world is not safe. The inherent dualism of war - one up one down, Us vs. them. How she only passed along what she knew. \n\nPerhaps I’m overempathizing with her situation. It’s a tendency I have, as a codependent. But as I read the words I felt their truth. War really does destroy families. And that is a tough legacy to break. ",

        "text": "I don't really know where else to post this that anyone would understand and I realize my own lack of ability to move on in what I'm about to write.  But here's hoping that simply writing it out will bring some bit of relief.\n\nI just saw today that the major college in the small town my ex and I moved to has posted a video documentary they made about him.  He literally somehow got a fucking movie made about how awesome and happy he is in his life now.\n\nBacking up: this short interview/documentary is talking about people who have changed careers and how awesome this college is in reaching out to the community.\n\nMy anger and issue with all of this... And I realize how selfish this is for me to write... but all he fucking accomplished, I did for him.\n\nTwo and a half years ago we moved to a small town to get away from the city.  The plan was that we would get new jobs, start over, and be happy together.  What I didn't know at the time was that he was a huge narcissist using me like a fiddle and as soon as he got what he wanted he would discard me completely.\n\nSo, while this was the plan, what actually happened was he smoked weed and played video games all day while I did all the work.  The one thing he did?  Pay for the move.  He spat that back in my face several times until it was drilled in my head.\n\n\\- I searched, applied for, and got a job for myself.\n\n\\- I searched, urged him to apply for, and drove him to the job interview that he ended up getting.\n\n\\- I searched for apartments, reached out to renters, and was able to find a place for us within two weeks of accepting the job offers.\n\n\\- I made all arrangements for a moving truck.\n\n\\- I packed up all of the old apartment.\n\nOnce we were in the new place, *he quit his new job the very first day.*  He didn't consult me or give me a heads up, he literally came home and told me he had quit.  Now I was somehow supporting both of us.\n\nHe looked for jobs in between smoking pot and playing video games.  I was told to make sure not to mention it to his parents or it would make him look bad.\n\nHe found a new job after about a month.\n\nHe quit that job after about 4 months.\n\nHe \"looked for jobs\" all day while he was high and playing video games.\n\nI told him I would help him look for jobs in between working my own job \\- I found something on craigslist after awhile that sounded like he would really like: a change of pace, working with his hands, etc, etc.\n\nHe agrees and goes for the interview.  He sulks when he gets home that there's no way he would get it.  I urged him to send out a thank you letter just in case.\n\nHe was offered and accepted the new job.\n\nHe discarded me the day he found out he was hired.\n\nThat day and the past two and a half years have been literally the worst years of my life.  I was alone in a relatively new town, trying to untangle this web of manipulation and come to terms with the fact that this person I thought existed never really existed at all, I went through the worst bought of depression as a result and became suicidal for a short time.\n\nAnd now the town college literally made *a fucking movie* about his happy transition, how proud he is of all that he's accomplished, how amazing his life is?\n\nI am so fucking angry and hurt right now.\n\nI am done with this fucking universe.",

About an hour before I knew they would be close to where I'm staying I couldn't even sit still, and I knew I'd go even though my head was saying \"don't be so stupid\".  I went.  I cried, I heard things that made my heart go out to them.  I wanted to crumple and go home to my lovely home and make everything ok.\nOnly everything wouldn't be ok.  \nSo I went to collect my free table and chairs from a kindly stranger and watched an amazing sunset with my friend who had a big enough car to carry what will be the heart of my new home. \nIt is very very difficult in these early days; I'm exhausted just by living. \nI'm sure it'll get easier - probably around dessert time on my wee family's first dinner in my new home.",

        "text": "I'm need tips for no contact. Sorry the title was deceiving. I forgot the question mark.\n\nYesterday my parents have basically disowned me until further notice. We are now in NC when we were doing LC. I haven't talked to them since Easter. I called today for mother's day. That was a big mistake. \n\nMy mom didn't want to answer the phone according to my sister. She mad that I've labeled her as a \"child beater\". I mean when you go around slapping people you're not going around giving hugs. Anyway, my dad answered the phone. The conversation started normal as if nothing happened then the conversation segued into why mom isn't talking to me. Then the reason why everyone is upset. \n\nMy dad decided to gaslight me. Said that no one got hit and that my mom didn't threaten to buy a plane ticket to her home country. Why would my sisters lie to me about something like this and call me crying hysterically? That would have to be some grand master level of manipulating that they aren't capable of. \n\nI called my dad out on his lie and he just keeps going \"you weren't there\" and then the story he told me starts slowly matching to my sisters. Go figure. He then spouted some lie that my husband  said around Christmas (last day in new jersey out at dinner) that my dad would be happier if the third reich was alive. May I mention as a very side note that my dad is a closet racist. Anyway, I told this to my husband and he just laughed. This made me angry as my dad kept repeating himself and I told him that this absurd statement isn't something my husband would ever say. \n\nI told him I'm disappointed in him that he told my aunt that my husband said this, that I only call when I want money (definitely not true) and that I dress my child like a girl (which I dont understand this). I didn't let him get one word in as I progressively started yelling and talking faster. I lastly said \"call me when you're ready to apologize. I'm done.\"\n\nI was very upset, mostly furious that quickly turned into sadness. I'm pretty sure I'm disowned until they get me to apologize somehow. That isn't happening because I've done absolutely nothing wrong. Maybe this is a blessing in disguise. I just feel very empty. I thought a scenario like this I would feel more victorious or something.... :/ Hopefully I can still stay in contact with my two younger sisters that still live with them (14 and almost 17).\n\nHappy mother's day to me.",

        "text": "TLDR: Does anyone have tips on overcoming EDs that stem from neglectful/abusive childhood rather than a body issue? Or perhaps can send me over more resources as all the ones I can find are related to body image issues? I'm on a waiting list for therapy but it's free so I can't complain about the long wait.\n\nContext:\n  \nGrowing up my nParents made it very clear that we were living in poverty and every penny needed to count - we got food bank donations and only bought the cheapest of the cheap. It was made exceptionally clear to me that this was my fault - I had the audacity to be born and, according to some newspaper article, to raise a child it costs whatever thousand from a newborn to 18 and I was expected to pay that back when I grew up (nDad eventually realised that was not going to happen when I wouldn't budge from my \"you decided to have me\" stance). Of course we had all the money in the world to feed my nParents hording but what do I know about the real world, eh?\n  \nBecause of this I have a guilty relationship with food and drink and I don't even know where to begin to \"fix\" this. My nParents have a crippling sugar addiction so the only food available to me as a child were biscuits and other sweet snacks because they would only buy food that they liked so they could eat it even though it was in the kids snack shelves. My nMum has been obese my whole life and would regularly steal food off mine and my brothers plates on the rare occasion we ate an actual meal so we learnt we had to eat fast off our plates which means I never got the \"signal\" that I was full, but because my nParents would rarely actually served food any time I got to eat I had to eat everything because it may be my last meal for a few days which is an instinct I still have. Every time I binge eat I feel really terrible though because my nParents would constantly complain whenever I ate the food that they bought specifically for me and my brother and they would say now there was nothing left for the rest of the month and they would then make sure I starved for the rest of the month so that they could be right by eating all the food or hiding it.\n  \nMy nMum also told me how the tap water was disgusting and how I should never drink it because it is full of chalk and you have to chew it so I was terrified to drink tap water. They would buy maybe ten 2ltr bottles of water and some cartons of juice on grocery day and that was our drink rations for a month (family of four). This has meant that \"thirsty\" is my normal and I have literally never felt like I have drunk enough water - these days I drink 3-4ltrs of water a day and I'm still so thirsty you'd think I'd just come back from the desert.\n  \nI live very comfortably now (moved in with my BF and many hundreds of miles away from nParents) but that's a problem in of itself - when I am at work I'll have an intense craving for a food (I'll see a McDonald's ad or something) and then all I can think about is getting a burger and I will ignore my packed lunch and go buy a large meal (always gotta get the biggest one) which costing me so much money. I spend the whole day thinking about food and what I want to eat and what I have to eat and what I've already eaten and it drives me insane. I can't tell the difference between hunger and thirstiness (not many people can tbh) but I'll drink a litre of water and still have that feeling so then eat a snack (like the whole pack of biscuits etc) and then that feeling is still there so I just keep going - I think the only reason that I have only recently begun really putting weight on is because it turns out I was lactose intolerant the whole time and the bloating and nausea was the only reason I would stop eating if there was still food to eat and now that I have cut out dairy I can keep eating for longer.\n  \nBasically my point is my BMI is like whaaaat and I think I am now the heaviest out of all my friends and I am well on the way to turning out just like my mum and I have no idea how to stop myself.

        "text": "I guess that I should provide a bit of a background before I begin.  I was raised by a narcissistic mother.  My parents have been divorced for as long as I remember.  Being down-to-earth, I tend to have a better relationship with my father than my mother.  He has his faults, don't get me wrong, but he was the best that he could be and continues to be.\n\nMy mother on the other hand, we have had our share of good moments, but too many bad moments as well.  I love her to death because she is my mother and for all the things that she tried to do to raise me, but her narcissism and alcoholism has led me to keep her at arms length.  If things happen, she has a tendency to blame people.  She also presses her political views as if she has the end-all-be-all solution.  But I don't want to get into that.\n\nGrowing up, she had this tendency to be with horrible men who would treat her like shit.  Simultaneously, she would always take their side whenever they were abusive towards me.  A great deal of my childhood was spent listening to arguments that would get the cops called in nicer areas.  To escape, I focused on school and my writing.  Creativity became a necessity for me to find those moments of solace where I could just disappear.  Of course when I started excelling in my classes, she was quick to dote on herself like she was the reason I was doing so well.  This trend continues to repeat itself even to this day.  But, like all narcissists, when things go wrong in her life, she loves to point the finger at people who love her.  I got tired of the whipping post shit.  After I was physically assaulted by her boyfriend when I was 18, I left.  Guess whose side she decided to take?\n\nI've always struggled with depression, but for the longest time I didn't take medication for it - and still don't.  I joined the Army when I was 19.  I was an infantryman, an 11B.  I came face-to-face with my depression while I was in the Army by talking to who I surrounded myself with.  The quiet moments in Afghanistan also allowed for self-reflection.  I was 21 years-old and I became more introspective especially as I began to lose people close to me.\n\nI've always struggled with relationships.  Moments of self-doubt often keep me from making the first move.  I like to believe that I'm a nice person.  Yeah, I've done wrong like anyone else.  But I like to believe that I do good things and I try to be the best person that I can be.  For that, I struggle to make the first move.  I'm a hopeless romantic and I'm easy to trust people.  Not because I'm gullible, but because I'm willing to give people a chance.\n\nMy ex-wife was extremely controlling.  I don't necessarily know if she was a narcissist, but she had a tendency to tell me that everything I wanted to do was stupid.  Eventually it got to the point that I didn't want to do things.  She got tired of trying to change me and I got tired of wanting to be changed.  So we amicably divorced.  Her and I aren't on great terms, but we both care for our daughter.  She has custody and I pay child support.  I'm looking forward to seeing her July.\n\nSo when I got divorced, I moved to Florida to be closer to my father.  I ended up enrolling at Florida State University because they had the best criminological program in the nation.  I ended up moving to Tallahassee which was actually five hours away from my father.  So basically, I came to Tallahassee knowing no one.\n\nI met this girl when I was working part-time at Walmart.  I was able to receive my bachelor's degree when I was with her.  The moment I met her, we clicked.  It felt like something out of a romantic comedy.  She seemed to be so into me and we were just laughing about everything.  We connected and I wanted to see her more.  Of course I was working when I met her so I didn't ask her for her number, I didn't want to harass her.  But she gave me it anyways, and I texted her right away.\n\nShe had me wrapped around her finger from the beginning.  I was all about her.  The sex was phenomenal, the conversation was deep, and we laughed constantly.  She wanted to do things and it was all so attractive.  She had a broken past similar to me.  Her mother was a narcissist and her father was just as bad.  She was gorgeous and she gave off this sweetness that made me turn my head when she told me of the abuse she endured by her parents and her ex-boyfriends.\n\nSee I have a code that I live by: to never judge somebody by their past, only by who they are currently.  When I met her she had been sober for 6 months and clean off heroin for three years.  Some could say that a history of addiction is a red flag, I would argue that there is more to it than that.\n\nI was in love.  Jesus Christ, I was head over heels for this woman.  I wanted to start this relationship on a clean slate.  I wanted to be more honest and understanding.  While I was with her, I continued to go to school.  I didn't just learn about criminality, but I began to  take classes understanding the extent of racism.  I became a male feminist in college.  I found my love for sociology which led to a position in grad school.  She was there for all of it, and she also preyed on my knowledge.\n\nShe was a bad liar, like ridiculously bad.  The thing is that I loved her so much I was in denial and I forced myself to believe her.  Early in the relationship, she reconnected with an old friend of hers, and drama ensued.  She would tell me about how she had mixed feelings on the guy and how in a perfect world they would have a relationship.  I told her that I didn't want to infringe on her happiness and I tried to break up with her.  This was worse given the fact that she wouldn't answer my texts and when she'd call she would constantly talk about him.  I saw the signs of emotional cheating and I tried to leave.  She begged me to say and let me know how sorry she was that she did what she did.  I forgave her and brushed it away as if I was being jealous.  This became a pattern.\n\nSeriously, she would talk to a guy, if there was drama she would insert herself in it, if the dude was in a relationship she would actively try to break them up, and then play the victim.  At first I would take her side and given that I was honest with her about everything, she would use my ex-wife to explain why things were so bad in this particular relationship.\n\nDealing with her ex was worse.  I understand how abuse works.  I also understand that we should be questioning the actions of the abuser and not the one who's being abused.  But as someone who has been abused, I have had to make active efforts to completely keep the person out of my life.  Her ex would stalk her, continuously call her, or say something that would gain her attention.  She would eventually answer and tell me, \"He has changed, he seems to be doing better.\"  Then she would realize that he was doing what he did to basically get a foot in the door and then proceed to make her feel like shit.  This put me in a variety of situations where there was nothing I could do.  It also got to the point where I felt that I couldn't go anywhere with her.  Luckily, her ex and I, never met face-to-face, but I didn't want to do something to catch a charge so I had to constantly watch my back when I was with her.  She preyed on all this; used it as ammunition to keep me by her side.  If I were to leave her, she would go back to the abusive relationship and I didn't want that for her or her son.  Even when we moved in together she continued to talk to him and I felt like a doormat.  She clearly made it seem like she was settling for me causing more depression.\n\nI graduated from FSU with honors.  There was a three month period where the money was tight.  I couldn't get anything directly after receiving my bachelors because of my aspirations to go to grad school.  I kept a job at Pizza Hut to bring in some extra income over the Summer.  She miscarried prior to my graduation and during the Summer, she began drinking again.\n\nShe also began writing to a man serving five years.  She told me that she wanted to, but she wanted to get my thoughts.  Of course I was apprehensive, but I didn't have a problem with it.  It was her choice.  She played on my intelligence when discussing this.  She legitimately seemed to care about the fate of her friend and research shows that a good support network prevents recidivism.\n\nAt first, she would read me his letters, but then she stopped.  The entire time I was with her, I never went through those letters.  They literally sat a couple feet away from me, I never went through them once because I respected her privacy.  The guy got transferred to a prison that was close to where we lived, so she began to go see him every Saturday.\n\nThe next portion is something that I don't like to talk about.  There's too many issues surrounding it.  Writing this prisoner became a problem.  She began telling me that she didn't know if she could be with me when he got out.  Of course I was pissed about it, once again feeling like the doormat she made me seem to be.  We fought over this shit for the rest of this relationship, but this moment made things worse.\n\nI was working late at Pizza Hut and her and I had been fighting over shit all week.  Prior to my shift, she had called me telling me how sorry she was and that she loved me.  I thought things were okay.  So, when I was at work, she decided to go out with a friend of hers that was going through a divorce.  On the way home, she drunkenly called me telling me that she went to this bar her ex-boyfriend and his friends constantly frequented.  Her ex had been banned from this place, so she felt safe going there.  I told her to be safe, and then she spent the next ten minutes berating me about how I was wrong for questioning our relationship.  I remember hearing one of her ex's friend laughing in the background.  Fucking bullshit...\n\nLater that night, I texted her to tell me that she was safe.  She texted me a couple hours later and said that she was fine.  I remember checking Snapchat and seeing her feed where she was dancing with dudes at this club.  I remember being jealous.  She stayed at her friend's house that night because she lived closer to the prison, but they also brought her ex's friend with her.  She came home around 2 or 3 the next day after seeing the dude in prison.  She told me that the man that she hung with had raped her.  I lost my shit.  But I calmed down and we mourned.  Things were perfect for two weeks, then she started blaming me again and confiding in the guy in prison who she said was more understanding of what she went through.\n\nIt only got worse from there.  She constantly accused me of victim-blaming.  Yeah, I did blame the victim when I first heard what happened, I perpetuated rape culture by feeding into everything that I'm against.  But, she also lied and played with my emotions so much that I found myself not trusting her.  I assumed that the non-trust was jealousy and I tried to work through it.  People would come over and she would drop subtle hints on how horrible of a human being I was.  When another guy would come over, she would flirt with him and give him all her attention.  It eventually got to the point that I didn't want to see it.\n\nEnter my best friend.  He had served in Afghanistan in the Watapur Valley, the same as me.  He was there a couple years after, but it's rare to find someone who has been to a place like that.  For the longest time we didn't hang out, mainly because I didn't know what she was going to do.  He turned out to be awesome and we started hanging out more.  Eventually I took the risk and brought her around.\n\nAt the time, him and his girlfriend were going through drama.  My ex saw this, and capitalized on it.  She would flirt with him right in front of my face.  She would constantly text him.  I didn't think much of it and because I was in denial, I ignored it.  He stopped coming over to our place because he saw her for what she was.  He started texting her less and I found myself coming over to his house more often.  We study together and we keep eachother motivated.  PTSD is harsh and depressing, so it's good to have people around who understand it and try to better themselves from it.  He was also trying to repair things with his girlfriend and saw what my ex was doing at the time.\n\nWhat she and I had was toxic.  She would talk about how she wanted to marry me and when I proposed she said \"yes.\"  She would often turn a blind eye to it when it was convenient for her and would use it as something to control me.  To make me behave.  I hated it.\n\nThe last weekend I was with her.  We went out to eat.  We had a great time.  I told her that I wanted to go to a courthouse and marry her, no bullshit, just do it.  She was down for it.  She seemed enthusiastic and excited about it actually.  We were happy and were quite physical on the drive home.  Two hours later when she was drinking she made fun of me for proposing in front of a bunch of 18-21 year-olds (they were her nephews friends).  At that moment, I came face-to-face with my denial.\n\nWhen Monday rolled around, I began talking to my coworkers about everything.  I met some people who had a narcissistic partners in the past and suffered from the emotionally manipulative abuse stemming from toxic relationships.  I remember the next day, I went to my best friend and before I could say anything he told me that I needed to leave her.  He also told me that he stopped coming over because she had made unwelcome advances.  She had talked shit behind my back to other people and claimed that I was there just until something better came along.  At that moment, all the lies unfolded and the apprehensiveness was lifted.\n\nI tried to leave her before.  I tried to give her the courtesy of a face-to-face.  Every time I would try to, she would cry and beg me to stay and promise that she wouldn't hurt me again.  So instead of giving her the courtesy, I packed up my things and I left.  I originally wrote her a long letter, but one of my professors noted that it would be better to keep it for myself and to write her a shorter one.  So I left on a Sunday morning when she was off visiting her \"friend\" in prison.  I left her a six-sentence letter.  It fucking hurt, but I did it, because I had to.\n\nMy best friend gave me a place to stay.  I changed my phone number, blocked her and many people who had ties to her, changed my address, and my passwords.  My best friend kept her unblocked on his phone in case she wanted to try something crazy, the last thing we wanted her to do was come here.  She sent him messages saying that she was pregnant.  She went to Planned Parenthood where she tested positive.  I unblocked her off my email and sent her a logical message detailing what we should do.  I didn't want to see her face-to-face, she was too manipulative.\n\nWe agreed to meet with a counselor at FSU to discuss the fate of the child.  I want to avoid the pro-life/pro-choice argument, but I left the decision up to her.  Waiting in that lobby for a counselor was brutal.  She was in my ear the whole time, talking about how sorry she was, that my best friend tried to fuck her, that I would never find anyone else to love me like she did.  After the agony we finally met the counselor, but the counselor saw her for what she was as she continued to make little remarks when it was my time to speak.  I made my intentions clear that day, \"I have no interest in being with you.  The only thing that matters to me is how we are going to do this.\"\n\nShe ended up miscarrying a few weeks later.  After I left her, I began seeing a counselor.  What I felt at that moment was guilty relief.  Guilty for the fact that she miscarried, but relief that I would never have to make contact with her again.  I left her email unblocked for a while.  A few days ago, I finally blocked her off of it for good.  She still tries to get a hold of me on \"Google Hangounts,\" but I dismiss the call every time, I want nothing to do with her.\n\nGiven that this subreddit is life after narcissism, I guess I should explain where I'm at currently.  I'm still living with my best friend, my two best friends actually.  They're engaged now and continue to work on things together.  I'm still a graduate student in Sociology so my work is cut out for me.  I have an A-average in my classes.  The grief is subsiding, but I have my moments.  I continue to meet with a counselor every couple of weeks.  That has actually been extremely helpful.\n\nI've started going out a little bit more.  My sense of self-worth is increasing day-by-day.  My depression sometimes gets the best of me, but I'm trying to do things to work through it.  This could include what I do for work and my hobbies.  I've started listening to metal more and engaging in the scene.  I know how to sew, so I actually bought a denim vest, I studded it out, and sewed a bunch of patches on it.  I'm eating at home more often and I'm getting closer to the people that I work with.\n\nI'm trying to get back into dating again, but at the same time I'm trying to establish boundaries.  At one point I believed that intimate relationships had no boundaries, but that's not the truth.  We all have our boundaries.  It hasn't gone anywhere yet, but I'm talking to this wonderful woman who's a nursing student at FSU.  She's sweet, but I think we both want to take it slow with each other.  I'm still seeing what's out there, but I'm being more careful.  Yesterday, I found myself looking for signs of narcissism in people.  It's one thing if a fight breaks out in the middle of a Dairy Queen, but it's another thing when someone involves themselves in drama to not help someone, but to make it all about themselves, instead.  But it's hard to pinpoint the signs because a narcissist will always put on a face emulating empathy.\n\nAt times, I find myself questioning who I am and if I'm good enough.  I went to a bar last night, and left after finishing a drink because I felt uncomfortable talking to people.  I tend to fly solo a lot, so I feel surrounded by people who are there with their friends.  It could be a PTSD thing, but it could also be me avoiding the hurt.  I don't know.\n\nI wanted to vent.  To get it off my chest.  To try to share.  I know things will get better, but I still doubt myself.  I just hope I'm not the only one.   ",

        "text": "I feel a little bit vulnerable opening myself up like this to a bunch of complete strangers, but I figure who is going to understand how I’m feeling better than a group of people who’ve been through the same things I have? So here I am.\n\nI apologise in advance for the length of this post. I’m venting hardcore right now and I need to get this out because it’s been sitting like a rock at the bottom of my stomach for the last three days and if I don’t let it out, I’m going to explode. I can’t give a tl;dr because I don’t know how to summarise all of this fucked up shit other than ‘some really, really bad stuff happened’.\n\nTo put it mildly, I have a complicated relationship with my parents. Shockingly, I am on speaking terms with them, but I truly believe that they are both sick in the head, and I think my father in particular is a true narcissist.\n\nOne of my first truly traumatic memories is of my father picking my sister up by the throat and slamming her against the wall because she was ‘talking back’. She was 11 years old. I also remember that he used to threaten to put a padlock on the fridge because I was ‘too fat’. He emotionally, financially and physically abused us, albeit I fared a lot better than my sister because she was less afraid to stand up for herself than I was.\n\nMy sister and I are both type I diabetics. When we were around 10 years old, my mother took us to an appointment to see the endocrinologist at the hospital, and she asked my father if she could have some money for lunch. He gave her $20 and told her that he expected her to bring change back. When my mother received a sizeable inheritance, despite the fact that their mortgage was almost paid off, he decided that we were going to move into a bigger, more luxurious house. My mother didn’t want to, but one day he came home and told her we were moving—he’d put an offer on a $500,000 house without consulting her. That was just the kind of person he was. He was self-centred and egotistical, and he was insanely controlling when it came to money. He valued it above everything else. It probably didn’t even occur to him that the inheritance wasn’t his money to spend, because he felt utterly entitled to it.\n\nThose are surprisingly not the worst memories I have, not by far. I only found out this year but when I was 12 years old, shortly after we moved into our new house, my mother split up with my father. He was miserable. My mother told me that his boss would regularly call her and beg her to take him back because he was constantly crying at work. One day, she forced him to tell my sister and I that he’d been growing and selling massive quantities of marijuana since before we were born. Shortly before he moved out, he’d been excavating under the house so that he could build an enormous grow room. At this point, my parents had been married for 25 years, and I discovered that for over two decades, my mother had been slowly going insane with the anxiety she felt that one day, the police would raid our house and take everything away from us. He didn’t care. He was too concerned about the money that he was making to give a shit about her feelings.\n\nI consider what happened next to be a defining moment in my life, the day I truly lost my innocence. I wasn’t even a teenager yet. My sister and I were sitting on the couch and my mother was up the other end of the house. My father came home from work early, and he was crying. He kissed us both on the forehead, told us that he loved us and went to his bedroom. We followed him in because we were worried about him, and then we watched as he swallowed an entire bottle of pills. We saw him begin to foam at the mouth. I ran to tell my mother that he was dying, and then we watched as the paramedics carried him out of the house in his boxer shorts because he couldn’t walk. It was the worst day of my life, and even now, 11 years later, I still can’t talk about it without breaking down, despite years of psychotherapy. Neither my sister nor I like to tell people about it because it well and truly fucked us up, and it makes people uncomfortable. Some people get it more than others, but most people I know don’t know how to deal with it because they have no basis for comparison. They grew up in homes with loving parents and happy memories. They weren’t forced to grow up too soon, to have their personalities shaped by something horrific.\n\nThings got pretty shitty after that. My mother had been so starved for affection that she’d been dating a man online while they were still married, and when I was 15, she decided that we were going to move interstate to be closer to him. That didn’t pan out—he kept coming up with excuses as to why he couldn’t meet her. She was desperate to be loved, though, and she began to spend the money that she’d gotten from the sale of the house on psychic hotlines, where she’d ask a ton of different variations of the question, why doesn’t he love me enough? All in all, she spent $250,000. She might have been there physically, but we never saw her. The only emotional interaction I ever had with her was when she backed me into a corner and screamed in my face because she thought my friend called her stupid, or when she snatched my phone and went through my messages because she suspected that I was texting my boyfriend (who I’d been forced to leave behind) about how miserable I was. Other than that… she only cooked one meal in the nine months that I lived there, which was a dish that her online boyfriend had given her the recipe for. Other than that, we ate takeaway every single day. She didn’t want to drive us to school, so she’d put us in a taxi and send us on our way. We only got in her car a few times, and one day, she almost crashed it because she was distracted thinking about *him*.\n\nI ran away from home after a little while. My mother wouldn’t let my sister come with me, even when my father’s father died, she wouldn’t let her attend the funeral as she was offended that she hadn’t been invited. But eventually, she relented, and my sister and I moved back to our home state to live with our father.\n\nHe was never home. He’d met a new girlfriend and he was more interested in spending time with her than raising us. We had parties every weekend because if you were 16 years old and basically lived alone, what would you do? My sister began using drugs. She slept around a lot and cut herself. When my father and his girlfriend (now wife) finally bought a house together (another $600,000 McMansion, because he had to have the perfect house and the perfect car and the perfect motorcycle and the perfect life), we moved in. To cut a long story short, because this post is already too long, she was an alcoholic narcissist who made him look like a saint. She was the human incarnation of the wicked stepmother. To exemplify this, she used to call my sister Cindy, as in Cinderella, because she forced her to do all the chores. When my sister got a full-time job and could no longer wait on her hand and foot, she decided that she was no longer of use to her and kicked her out of the house. My father didn’t say anything, because he cared more about having the perfect marriage than he did about us. She was almost homeless, and eventually, she was raped, which caused her to spiral. She still won’t tell me how many men she slept with, but I know it was over 40. She’s doing well now—she’s the strongest person I know—but for a while there, she was on a very dark path, and it has left irreparable scars on her psyche.\n\nI don’t want to go into much more detail but it did get worse from there. Inevitably, I got kicked out too and ended up living with my father-in-law, who is an even bigger narcissist than my father was. But I’m safe now. I live with my partner, the same one who I had to move away from. We’ve been together for 8 years now, and he is my biggest cheerleader. He has been there for me through everything, and I don’t know where I’d be today without him.\n\nI know this isn’t /r/raisedbynarcissists, this is a place where people come to talk about their lives post-narcissism. But I am here to talk about that, I promise. It’s now been 5 years since I moved back down and I finally had the opportunity to recover the family photographs that my mother had kept with her, so my sister decided to arrange a viewing party at her house. I was excited at the time, but I now know that this was a huge mistake. I sat with her and we watched videos of us when we were eighteen months old, and our father was playing with us and being so affectionate, telling us he loved us and that we were his girls. We were so happy and innocent. We hadn’t yet been destroyed by everything that was to come. I am crying writing this, and to be frank, I’ve been crying for 3 days now. We sat and we looked at all the photographs of us as children and I bawled my eyes out because I knew I would never get to be that person again. I can’t even think about my childhood because all I can think about is what I’ve lost, what we’ve both lost. It brought up so many horrible memories. Last night, I started thinking about when I saw my father close to death and I began to hyperventilate. It was the first panic attack I’ve had in years. I had to take a Valium to calm down, and even then, I still felt it acutely.\n\nThings did get better for me, for us. But after seeing those pictures, I feel like a broken person, like all the progress I’ve made has been for nought. I don’t understand how he could love us and care for us so much, and then he let all this horrible shit happen to us because he didn’t care enough to stop it. I feel like I’ve been gut-shot. I know it will get better but it just hurts so much right now. I wish I had been born into one of those happy families, that I didn’t have to be hard and tough and resilient because I’d come to expect that somebody somewhere was going to screw me over or leave me. I wish I didn’t feel like I want to die every time I think about that little girl who no longer exists. I’m sorry that this was so bleak, but I had to get it out of my system. I am so sorry that you all had to go through the things that you did, and I wish it could’ve been different for all of us.",

But everything in my heart, and my intuition is telling me that this is the right time, and this is the necessary change I have to make to start anew and build the life I deserve.\n\nSo I'm thinking of forming a support group for anyone who is preparing and about to go NC, or already doing so. (Don't think this is against the rules) \n\nI envision a warm and positive atmosphere where we support each other's efforts to make the necessary changes and goals to be permanently free (both psychologically and practically) from any toxic environment. The core energy of the group would be resilience and a can-do mindset, and taking action-oriented baby steps to moving forward and creating the life we always wanted. \n\nJust message me directly if interested. Could be entirely anonymous if people feel more comfortable like that.\n\n",

However sometimes I catch my brain thinking thoughts that I'm sure most people don't think...\n\nFor instance, the things I appreciate about him are very telling.\n1. He never gets angry when I accidently wake him up at night or if im sick and am coughing too much.\n2. If takeout gets his order slightly wrong, he doesn't drive back to the restaurant to yell at them or rant that they \"are trying to screw him over\", he shrugs and says \"oh well\"\n3. If he doesnt respond to a text for many hours, it's usually cause hes busy with a work thing and not because hes punishing me for something ive done wrong.\n4. He's very comfortable saying sorry and always says it on his own\n5. If I tell him that I don't feel well, he asks what he can do and shows compassion...he doesnt imply that im a hypochondriac or annoyingly say \"ugh...you're fine\"\n\nHaha so aside from all the normal awesome qualities of my new man, there are many other things I appreciate about him because of my past abusive relationships...what are some things you appreciate after N relationships that you're sure that most normal people don't even think of?",

I've mostly come to terms with all of the nuances of that reality.\n\nBut I know she's going to feel bad on Mother's Day. And while I know that the things she'll feel are unfair to the situation, to me, she still really feels them. She does feel betrayed and abandoned, and how much of that is willful ignorance to how she treated me, I don't know. Somedays, I'm really sure she thinks she did everything perfect. And some days I'm sure she knows she did everything she could to be malicious to me.\n\nRight now I'm fluctuating between the two, and the one thing I have at the end is, I feel guilty because whether or not it's fair and right for me to do, I am the only one denying her this. It's completely in my power to give her this, and I always feel guilty when I have power.\n\nI don't need advice. I shouldn't break NC. I shouldn't feel 'at fault'. It's just a difficult thing to feel because it's so contradictory and I just needed to share.\n\n",

Apparently, he's in the starting process of blackmailing a guy. \n\nHere's the situation; there is a doctor who buys weed from him, this Dr. has been harassing 'Mark' to get him heavier drugs, take him to clubs and get him laid, and making homosexual passes at him. The doctor is also married with two kids and has recently moved to the area in order to escape his previous bad lifestyle.\n\nHere's the justification;\nMark tried to get a loan from him, but the Dr. said no. Dr. then went and told Mark's roommate that he didn't think it a good idea, since Mark only works part-time and is still in college. This, apparently, struck Mark's sense of injustice. Mark had his transmission blow out, he's between two apartments and paying for both, and just bought two puppies to breed with his dog 'eventually'. He claims \"I don't feel bad for someone like him that has so much and takes it for granted\".\n\nIt hit me like a ton of bricks! Mark has put HIMSELF in a financial bind. He's angry that another person, regardless of the Dr being a piece of shit, wouldn't fix it for him. He's now wanting to go out of his way to entrap and force the Dr. into helping him. He got a girl's number and wants her to hit on and sexually provoke the Dr, while on camera, in order to make his plan work. He called the last girl, his roommates girlfriend, a dumbass for backing out of his plan. This has all happened within 24 hours. \n\nWhat in the ever living hell is wrong with people? Why does he feel ENTITLED to this guy fixing his problem? Did he seriously act interested in me to involve me in his plan? And what, we're just going to 'ride off into the sunset' after his plan is done and he no longer needs my help?!",

The fate of an overt Narc seems clearer - they seem to be in a more complete state of self-denial, and as they age their false reality falls further away from outside reality. When they get into their 70's and even 80's do they begin to drift into a kind of collapsed state? Some of them going senile? This appears to be the accepted prognosis for overt NPD-cases. Is that right?\n\nIn the case of Covert wives - of which there seems to be a lot - what is their fate? Whether they began as codependents, and turned toxic, or whether they were toxic since their own childhoods - what happens as they age into their 70's and 80's? It seems covert Narcs are more self aware - some of them having traits of BPD, and ASPD also. But they certainly are more aware than the overt Narc - and are aware of the aforementioned doomed fate of their overt Narc partner. In the case of my mother I believe she has a sadistic satisfaction from knowing she will witness the downfall of her husband over time - for whatever reasons. That's off the point - the question is how does old age affect the Covert Narc? Do they have a more bearable inner world as the reach their Winter years? \n\nI'm glad to be out of the toxic mess that is my FOO - even as scapegoat I feel I am the only one with an opportunity to be free and, in time, my own man. \n\nDo you have one overt and one covert parent? In what ways did they fall fowl of their inner toxicity as they aged? Did they improve in any way, or continue to get worse?\n\n",

We moved in and were completely settled in 6 days. My grandparents invited us over for dinner, during dinner they told me that if we were ready we could take the cat and that they expected us to. We went out and came back to get the cat, she walked right into the cage willingly. My narcissist grandma immediately starts bawling and curls up into my empath grandpas arms on the couch screaming \"go, just go!\". I called my grandpa when I got back to my home with the cat and grandma got on the phone saying \"maybe it's just your diseased mind but I cant imagone you've missed the cat much in the 6 days you've been gone\". I went back over to talk to grandpa that night and grandma hid in her room with the door cracked so she could listen. He said that I did everything wrong, it was all my fault and that they wanted a weeks notice before I took the cat. He told me that obviously that's what I wanted to hear, that everything was all my fault and that i made a huge mistake. I left in tears. Grandma then posted on Facebook as if the cat was dead and garnered a ton of sympathy (50 comments so far) and never once clarified that the cat is safe with her owner. Then she put up a post directed at me that says \"If the only song you sing hurts people, shut the hell up and sing a new song\". Grandpa changed his Facebook profile picture to a pile of dirt and called me crying saying that hes stuck in the middle and doesn't know what to do. I blocked grandma on text and Facebook, the only problem is that the car I drive and my phone are paid for and owned by them and I currently only have $1,500. They want $3,000 just for the car. Any advice on where to go from here? I'm feeling a mixture of self hated (thinking I've done everything wrong and that the narcissist is right) or that maybe I'm better off on my own. To make things worse, my boyfriend proposed today and I said yes, but have no one to share the news with :(",

I thought I could handle my dad long enough to graduate high school(I was sixteen) so I moved in with him to get away from my moms drinking.  He ended up hitting me within a year and was charged with domestic violence.  After that, I went NC and moved in with my mom and her husband, they were hard to live with and I still feel like I have a lot of issues from them too.  Shes not an N but she has a lot of issues from her childhood and my stepdad was a retired drill sargent, so his career was literally to mentally abuse ppl.  They're not horrible ppl like my dad, but they had been through a lot and it made them kind of act toxic.  I feel like I was neglected and mentally abused by them.  I was also mentally abused by my aunt (who seems to like hurting and messing ppl up in the head, yes this is my moms sister) and ppl in the private school I went to.  Also ppl at work, first it was some coworkers and then when I moved positions I had some horrible managers directly over me who would treat me and everyone else like we couldnt do anything right.  I worked in that position for 3 horrible years.  My situations a lot better than it used to be, but its still hard sometimes.  I think I have c-ptsd and its hell.

        "text": "I feel Guilty about my ex and the way he treated me. I wasn’t great to him either and definitely emotionally cheated on him and he was hurt. But here’s my story. I feel so guilty. I also got really mad in arguments. We dated for six years. I am a 26/F and he is a 27/M.\nI would find out he lied to me about something I would get really upset and say fuck you and all that bad stuff. When he would always call me crazy when I would get upset with him for something and say I just had a shitty perception of things I would say well then if all my feelings and complaints are crazy to you, why don’t you leave and find someone who you don’t find crazy he would be like wow, you’re so unstable emotionally, why is that always your first resort? And I would be like yeah.... “we don’t agree on these issues. You’re not willing to see the role you play in it. I gladly will tell you exactly how I contribute to this bad situation and when I ask you what you do to contribute to the situation you literally say I can’t remember or I know I can do better... you literally cannot give me a concrete answer as to how you can improve and work with me on this issue because you can’t even point out what to work on on yourself”\nHe would tell me that I painted a bad picture of him to my family and friends when I went to them for advice and for validation of my feelings. He never made me feel validated. And if he did he made no changes to his behavior but I so believed that he loved me and would change. Just seem to love me. He never hit me. He was always just there. Never went above and beyond for me. Meanwhile I did his homework for him, helped him study, cleaned and cooked for him, made friends with his friends and family, made an effort to see him. Forewent my family events and holidays to be with he and his family because I wanted to see him and I knew there was no way his mom would let him be with my family for Christmas. Nor did he seem excited about the idea of it. I also tried hard to stay fit and sexy for him.\n\nWhen I would bring up something about his behavior that I didn’t like he would tel me I am too sensitive or blame me for something I did in the past that was apparently equally as shitty or even more shitty, then he would be like “yeah so basically this ain’t as bad as that so why are you upset? I didn’t get upset with you during that situation... why do you have to be such a fighter? Just let it go!!”\n\nThe issues were minor at times but they kept happening over and over and he would tell me over and over he loved me and would change. It was dumb shit. Like begging him to kiss me or hold my hand in public, or asking him to invite me to hang with his friends instead of telling me I am always invited (when he used to invite me). Or never being a part of my family or friend group.\n\nSo all this lead to me having my feelings invalidated and feeling really poorly about myself and so I emotionally cheated with my friends and family and some of those friends were guys. I could have a real conversation with them. Where we disagreed and it was okay. We saw both points of view and agreed to want to work together to understand each other. Where they did kind favors for me just because. Just because I existed. They seemed excited to have me around and would be genuinely excited for me, whereas my ex seemed to fake it. Hell I got into nursing school and graduated from a top university and it was always my dream to do that and he didn’t even plan a special dinner for us. His parents took us out to eat and he thought that was sufficient. This was six years in.\n\nI know it messed with his head and was wrong but he kept promising me things that never came and I so badly wanted him to change and just be a more present person and seem to put me first. Hell. He would make up excuses to leave my family functions early and we would have to drive back home three hours away. I would always make a point to hang with his family. I always wanted to hang with them because I knew he had a tight knit family. Meanwhile my family thought he was really fake nice. I also thought that after a while. His actions and words wouldn’t align.\n\nIt ended with him coming home at 4 am, him leaving me and calling me crazy and saying he walks in eggshells around me when I asked him why he came home late without calling and why my contact name was deleted in his phone. He told me four different stories as to why he came home so late because I found an email from the girl he went home with. I later found an email uber receipt split between two people dropping him off at the university by his apartment. He told me to move out of his place, he blocked me on everything, told me to not go to his college graduation later that week (when I helped him countless times to study and motivated him and did flash cards with him and wrote and edited his papers). Two weeks later when she dropped him he begged for me back, asked for a threesome which I declined and instead tried to be crazy sexy in bed and do insane stuff to please him (I’m his first). I couldn’t deal with the insecurity that I wasn’t enough for him despite everything I did for him. His biggest complaint was that I got really upset with him (when he lied or didn’t make me a priority). We got together to try to make things work and use this as an eye opener to work on our relationship. He promised to do therapy. He never made any effort into getting therapy. But mentioned t often.\nI left him when he started to not make an effort to see me when I had a weird work schedule and he works for his mom so I assumed she would give him leeway with his schedule so he could spend time with me. But he never seemed like that was an option despite his family loving me. He worked a very minor role at the company at this time.\n\nI then regretted my decision of leaving him and tried to get him back but he started seeing a new girl and said he wanted to give her a chance, that she and he aren’t compatible but he wants to give her a chance because he gave me so many chances. He says he would be sad to see me marry someone else. He said he just knows they won’t workout but wants to try so he doesn’t regret anything. That he ideally would be with me. I made him upset one week and all the sudden he says “fuck you, I hate you, I love my girlfriend, we are very compatible, I can see her being my wife and the mother of my children, don’t ever talk to me again, I will never see you again or be with you again, and I am blocking you on everything” then he doesn’t block me on everything.\n\nI see him showing this girl love and affection in our mutual friends social media (some of our fights were about the fact he never showed me affection in public, fuck he didn’t even give me a NYE kiss in front of his fam after 7 years).\n\nI just want to know why I wasn’t enough and what I did wrong to deserve this. And if I am the issue?\nTLDR: ex didn’t seem interested in me. Invalidated my feelings. I feel it is my fault. I did everything to make him happy. When I voiced how he didn’t make me happy he would point the finger at me. Strings me along. I feel I am a fucked up person who will never find love now and I ruined something good with someone",

        "text": "This might be a long one, sorry in advance.\n\nI thought LAN would be a perfect environment to help with this situation, since a lot of us have cut off our Ns or are at least NC with them, and are trying to live normal lives by working with whatever \"family\" connections we have left, blood or non-blood. \n\nIf anyone recognizes my posts, I'll just write a TLDR, and say that I am in NC with my Nmom for about two months now, and have been trying to fix my relationship with my Dad that she tried to ruin, this has been going on for about two years which is the amount of time that I have not been living in her house. She and my Dad are divorced and he is remarried and has a wonderful wife and kids. He left our home when I was 9 years old. He really sees my boyfriend, G, as a son, and G really loves my Dad. Me and G have been going out for almost two and a half years now. \n\nThe fact that he and my mom split up when I was 9 and that I am now almost 27 is very significant, because I feel like he still treats me as if I was that age. He can be very patronizing, condescending, and puts down my accomplishments without realizing it. It really pisses me off because I want our relationship to be good and when I express my feelings he just laughs/shrugs it off because he's an \"easygoing, Christian guy\". I feel like it kind of amuses him to see me annoyed. He also interrupts when I'm talking and doesn't really let me have a word in. He's pretty stubborn and at times childish. My boyfriend says that his dad is similar and that all Dads do this and it's just a \"Dad thing\", but I really think that it goes deeper than that and he really doesn't respect me as an adult and looks down on me. I'm starting to think that neither one of my parent's actually value me as an adult and secretly see the other one in me and as a result don't like me.  I will now go into the examples of some of the things he says and does that really irritate me: \n\nHe states I'm materialistic. I'm not even a little bit materialistic and I don't know why he loves to say it. I give clothes away when I don't wear them and I don't buy expensive things. I HATE the mall, the only time I go is when I KNOW beforehand what I need to get, I get it on sale if possible and then I bust out of there ASAP. I hate clutter and am actually very minimalist. Important fact; He lives in one state, we live in the next state over. My dad is a very successful businessman. When I was a teen and he would visit us, HE would take us to the mall, and my MOM would tell me what to ask him for. Every 3-6 months, we just became accustomed to him bringing us to the mall on his visitations. Often I didn't know how to pick stuff so I would just grab anything and it didn't even match, and I was also dealing with being made fun of at school, so he would buy me stuff at the trendy stores at the time, like Hollister and Pacsun. But I wasn't stylish or looking for popularity by ANY MEANS. And HE, on the other hand, is a total brand whore and has nice cars, nice high quality clothes and everything. He also tries to shit on me as being \"materialistic\" because when I was 18 I opened up a bunch of credit cards. But it was because I was miserable in NMom's house and she never helped me with anything! One of them was a Firestone card to do car repairs because my mom literally just asked me to ask him and he would say he couldn't!  I have since almost paid them all off. I HATE to be in debt.\n\n\nThat I'm \"complicated\": Well yes, I'm an adult female that you DIDN'T RAISE, so of course I'm complicated to you. All you ask is how is work and how is school, and label me whatever you want, so I can understand how you really have NO IDEA WHO I AM.\n\n\nThat I've jumped from job to job and have no experience really: Um ok, more like I completed my bachelor's in six years and a lot of my jobs have been internships, which are NOT permanent and have opened many doors for me in terms of experience. I have two and a half years of experience in HR, worked in one company for three years in retail before I started in HR, and worked in another company for two years BOTH as an intern and an employee. But he's mister Big Businessman and none of my effort matters. \n\n\nThat I did poorly in school and he talked to counselors about it: No I wasn't. And no you did not. I was in college and over 18, so you didn't even have access to my records. And when I called him out on it, he was just like \"Ok.\"\n\n\nThat I have a temper and I'm just like my Mom: I have a \"temper\" with him for what I wrote above. He talks to me like I'm some kind of dumb bitch, and I'm supposed to sit there and take it. And I'm NOT just like Nmom. Gross. \n\n\n\nI'm trying to remain peaceful with him. He is definitely good at sweet talking me and at least telling me that he's proud of me, but he really doesn't show it. I'm tired of calling him out just to get teased and ridiculed. I'm tired of being the family's punching bag they use to project.  I think he's just trying to make up for being distant parent. I don't really know how to deal with him. Any advice? ",

        "text": "I had been NC with mom and dad for about a year, then went back. I was in a really good place in my own life and thought I could handle it. Then it got overwhelming again because the stress of my job made me tired and I let my guard down. I was no longer \"strong\" enough, what I called being \"my best self\" to be around my crazy parents. I am now realizing that being \"my best self,\" as I defined it was letting every callous and disrespectful thing she said and did slide off my back as if I had no needs, no wants and no personality. I diffused every situation by deferring to her. I have always been her helper, the absorber of the impact, her emotional yes-man and I let her feed on me when she was emotionally ravenous. I recently said to her, \"It won't be so bad,\" to soothe her when she was saying how horrible something was going to turn out and she told me that that was the first sentence I ever said to her when I was a baby: I said, \"Be so bad,\" while stroking her hair. How's that for being assigned a role from an early age. \n\nSo NC again, and this time my siblings have also lashed out at me, sending me enraged texts and emails. I blocked all of them. I can't be my true self around them which is the real \"best self.\" [Screw the haters!](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=OFr74zI1LBM)",

He did bring up common likes, dislikes, it felt a little like checklisty. We went to lunch, he was very flirty. Then at the end of the date, he said \"well, I can be a bit of a dick, I can be heartless sometimes\" - it was said in a joking, self deprecating way, but i thought AAAAAHAAA!! I got you Narc! Caught you! Lmao! Of course I can't say whether he was an N or not, but this and the fact he blamed his ex for the marriage ending, revealing TMI on the first date was telling. They never speak well of their exes... \n\n",

I got blood tested for celiac disease (negative). I saw a specialist who was ready to do a colonoscopy (I'm 29, and obviously female).I was also weighing paying $400 out of pocket for a food intolerance test insurance didn't cover, but the scientific validity of the test was questionable. I was getting desperate though. I'd taken probiotics daily for months.\n\nAnd unrelated, I went NC. Suddenly, my \"gut health issues\" disappeared. I can eat spicy food and it's fine.

        "text": "Not so much a question or a rant as a general discussion topic. :\\~\\)\n\nI've seen a bit of advice for all of us Narc Survivors pushing to give away/destroy those things which our Narcs have left in our lives. For me, this is a *huge* selection of material objects, many of which are actually quite necessary, including books, clothing and kitchen utensils.\n\nWe have gotten rid of some! But not so much others. And it's occurred that there actually is an arbitrary line between what gets kept and what doesn't. The rule, it seems, is:\n\n* **Discard** anything which has attached to it a bad story;\n* **Keep** anything where we can use it to tell a *new* story.\n\nHere's a couple of ready examples!\n\n1. **Old Plates** \\- NMum gave these to a charity shop when I didn't immediately leap up to take them off her hands, leading to a humiliating episode where she drove us to a charity shop to buy them back. My Partner was reluctant to eat off them because it reminded her of NMum \\- until our housemate pointed out that keeping them serves as a nice \"F You\" to NMum. Every time we use them we can look at it as a victory \\- *You can throw anything you like at us, we've got your plates and you'll never get 'em back!*\n2. **T\\-Shirts** \\- almost every shirt I have was given to me by my family, very often my NMum, who has had an ongoing habit of policing my appearance. I recently splurged on some new shirts from Qwertee while culling several older ones of which I'm not fond. This felt to me incredibly empowering, despite being so mundane; because I was both rejecting that \"This is what **NMum** decided I should wear\" and embracing that \"This is what** **I choose to wear\".\n3. **Teapot** \\- we have a cast\\-iron teapot given to us by NMum for Christmas. After we went NC, my partner put it in a cupboard and decided never to use it again; its solid, heavy frame reminds us too much of NMum's stubborn, overbearing character.\n4. **Russian Wedding Ring** \\- I made this in high school as a project and gave it to NMum as a jokey gift \\- it's made of three loose interlinking silver bands. After a few months of dating my Partner, NMum spontaneously gave it to her as a gift she had been 'caretaking'; we took it at the time as an affectionate gesture, but it later occurred that the real context behind it was \"You're so useless, I even have to propose to your girlfriend for you!\". But my Partner chose to keep it because before NC she'd spent time and money getting it refitted at a jewllers, and now it would never fit anyone but her.\n5. **Books** \\- there are so many examples, but one of them was a copy of Gaiman's \"Neverwhere\" given to me by NSis. Before we went full NC, she demanded I give it back to her, as she had \"always intended us to share it\" \\(a lie\\), and didn't want my Partner to even touch it. I sent it back cheerfully, because the fact that she'd made this lying demand had devalued it for me.\n\nWhat has your approach been to similar gifts/mementos? Have you gone scorched earth, reclaimed some items for their stories, sold them on eBay?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/8gu6sy/how_do_i_know_if_i_have_an_ndad/",
        "text": "I’ve been following this sub for a short while and I’m trying to ascertain if I have an NDad. I was an absolute daddy’s girl growing up, I remember him being my favorite person ever as a small child. Then as I aged, he became mean and consistently made me feel as if I wasn’t good enough and as if my efforts were never good enough and wildly controlling. I’ll add I come from a Cuban-American household. In my home, what my dad said- went. And my mother generally followed suit. If dad said the fucking sky was yellow, you bet your ass my mom agreed that it was yellow. He always screamed and threw things; even over very small trivial things such as a single dish not being washed or a back pack being left on the couch. And that small issue became this session of telling me how terrible I was and how I would never amount to anything and how he only stays with my mother because she’s a good woman but he has other children in Cuba he can care for over me. I wasn’t perfect no but I was your average kid, and generally well behaved. As I progressed into teenagehood and adulthood, I became resilient and defended myself- which man did that send him way over the edge. My mother and sister never argued my father or defended themselves. He was right and we were wrong, even if we really weren’t. Leaving the house was a rarity, and when I found an outlet through a PC any godfather has bought me and made internet friends- my father snooped and turned mountains into molehills (ex: having a convo with a friend about stupid 13 year old things and saying “shit” or “damn”). He would lose his mind and tell me how terrible of a child I was. And adulthood it worsened, he became ill with COPD, and my mother and sister became the breadwinners as he couldn’t work. As soon as I got a job at 18, my first pay check in hand, he attempted to tell me they would be deposited into his account for his management. That was the first time I really put my foot down. “No, I worked for it, I earned it, it belongs to me.” I’ll add that my father received an $800 check in my name in addition to his disability because I was still under his dependence and in high school. He turned red in the face, starting barking that my (50yo) mother’s best friends father managed her money (who’s a fucking RN). And I use the age old phrase that he always used with me- I’m not Madeleine and you’re not her father, this isn’t their life. After that it was a constant snooping of my things, telling me every decision I made wasn’t good enough, how I was destined for failure because I wouldn’t follow his guidance, and I wouldn’t succumb to his control. My mother always and still does defend his cruel words as he’s old and just gets frustrated, now because he’s ill and frustrated. He realized I wasn’t going to allow the control so he started making me feel bad for keeping my distance and leading my own life. I’ll add that I’m a 25yo female, have a career in public safety, have my own condo, my own vehicle, never have been in legal trouble, I don’t abuse drugs or alcohol, have recently lost 120lbs, AND in a healthy loving relationship.  I call once a week, every time it’s a complaint, “well the phone works both ways, dad.” My visits are limited to an hour at most. I pay my mothers cell phone bill but he has a fit if I don’t loan him money. If his birthday gift isn’t more than $50 it’s not good enough, if my boyfriend and I go to dinner or on a night out that I post to FB and don’t bring him a plate or a souvenir- he gets upset. It’s...a goddamn lot and I guess I wanna know if I have an NDad...\n\nI should add that my sister has now become sympathetic as well because he doesn’t have much life left- he’s 70 with severe COPD and cardiac issues and for some reason that doesn’t make me want to spend even more time with him because the emotional abuse isn’t worth it. Am I bad person? ",

        "text": "I'm a regular Redditor, but posting on my main account would result in a lot of privacy invasion, so I made this. Long time lurker, first time poster kind of deal. I hate even posting about it, but not acknowledging it will keep letting it fester.\n\nIn a nutshell: I am 99.9&amp;#37; no contact, with an opening for email contact on the off chance I need some kind of information for my college scholarships. Both of my parents are full on NPD; specifically, my dad wanted to fuck me and made me his emotional girlfriend/punching bag all my life, and instead of protecting me, my mother saw me as competition and blamed me for every abuse \\(rape, manipulation, emotional abuse, doesn't really matter\\)  I've endured. She told me I didn't deserve my name, that I needed to stop using it, while my father told me she didn't mean it and they both gaslit the living fuck out of me every chance they got. There's much more to it, but I won't bore you. In terms of where I am now: I'm an extremely reflective person and see it as my duty to evolve; I've been to therapy, I've worked on myself with workbooks, meditation, journaling, you name it... and I'm proud to say that I've moved past the rage\\-fueled hot mess teenage me was, the dangerously disassociative, depressed husk of a person I was before I moved out and went NC, and I'm overall a balanced and well\\-rounded person with solid boundaries. Just to make it clear, I have legitimately diagnosed PTSD. \n\nIt doesn't exhibit itself the way it used to, but the way it exhibits now for the most part is just... extended stages of pure fucking unfeeling apathy. This is really bad considering I'm primarily self employed, and need to be self motivated to get back in school \\(I had to take two semesters off to support myself before I moved out of my Nparents'\\). This isn't 100&amp;#37; of the time; I still get inspired, do what I need to do to tend to myself and the people close to me, etc. But this stage is lasting longer than I'm comfortable with... of just not fucking caring, not feeling, numbness, going through the motions and waiting for the \"fake it til you make it\" to kick in. It's not so much that I don't care, because inside, fuck yes I do. I'm extremely ambitious, I have a path, I know what it is and what to do to get there. But it feels like an uphill journey to even reach control of my fingers to move and my body to get up and do it too goddamn often lately. I know that I'm tired... but I can't rest now. I need to make it through these next 4ish years. I should be able to snap myself out of this and I hate that I haven't yet. So if anyone is experiencing this, or has experienced it, I'd appreciate your input/insight of how you made it. ",

From 18 to 23 I was targeted by someone who has now discarded me after emotionally destroying me by planting seeds of distrust in numerous friendships and social media. Since I never participated in facebook or insta, I was completely oblivious to what was happening. \n\nI have been cheated on numerous times, manipulated to believing it was my fault, and somehow my abuser still managed to make me seem like a jealous asshole to everyone that hardly knows me, destroying my reputation which was previously something I was proud of. I have dated 3 women since I was 13 for a total of 10 years, the shortest being a 2 year relationship. \n\nThe longest relationship was the worst, and only that ever turned so terribly sour. My other two exes I ended on good terms with and have nothing good memories to speak of. My abuser created a void in my life where I don't have any memories, or none that I am fond of. Everything I can remember was stress and accusations.\n\nBut this is all ok.. I am starting to see now that this experience will make me a stronger person and even though I hurt like hell for way longer then I should have I am healing now and things will only get better without her in my life. It sounds arrogant but I am so much better without her weighing me down. \n\nShe taught me how to protect myself and my loved ones against people like her, she taught me how to prepare myself and conduct myself in a way that is respectful to me and my partner.. not one or the other.\n\nReading and learning about this has really helped me process my emotions. I have some lows but overall rationalizing the behavior with books like Psychopath Free helps me to see that Im not alone, I'm not crazy.. I can heal from this, and I can be so much stronger then I ever was... Thanks to her.\n",

She was away for close to a month out of country for one of my cousin’s weddings. I didn’t go because she will be there.\n\nShe came on the 27th and now that she’s back , I feel extreme tension and stress out of nowhere. I am 35 and she has started emotional incest with me starting with buying me slippers from her out of country trip . Slippers which don’t even fit me and slippers that I don’t need because I already have one and knows I don’t like because I told her “over and over and over” that I don’t want her buying me stuff.\n\nShe also started making me evening snacks and invites me to eat even though I have told her over and over and over that I don’t want her making me any type of food or call me to eat because I buy my own food and I cook my own food. She is doing it to gain a sort of leverage or control over me because that’s what she’s been doing her entire life.\n\nAlso , she is a very inconsiderate person. I’ll explain why. I take the garbage out every time there is some garbage to be picked up. There is some walking involved. But right after throw out the garbage, she puts another batch for me to pick up and throw out within hours sometimes. It’s extremely frustrating because she has absolutely no consideration for the fact that I just threw out like 5 mins ago.\n\nShe is disgusting. I am stuck here because I only make around $1,000 /mo right now with my freelance business. But I am starting a new web development business and I am hoping to bring in another $1,000 per month. Once that picks up , I am out of here because that should cover my rent as well as my bills .But until then I feel extreme stress especially on Tuesdays and Thursdays when she is home. I want to go out and do my work from a library, but I need my desktop computer to easily get my work done. I can use my laptop but it’s a bit slower and takes more time to complete the task. I feel like I am stuck in a prison.\n",

        "text": "In my case, it was my sister. She is five years older than me and we couldn't be more different. She's a cerebral narcissist and a lawyer, and I'm the creative child and a scapegoat. She's always been mean, but only I know exactly how far she can go.\n\n\nStarting when I was three, she physically abused me. There was no intervention because I was a boy and I was expected to fight back. But she was older, bigger, and stronger than me until I was 11 and I was powerless to stop her. More times than I can count, I was smothered until I lost control of my bladder. I believe this is what led to the bedwetting problem which persisted until my teens.\n\n\nWhen she couldn't hold me down anymore, she transitioned to emotional and psychological abuse, except for the frequent occasion when she'd try to stab me with writing implements. I was told I was worthless in every conceivable formulation of the words, and I believed her.\n\n\nThings got worse as I got older. I was underperforming in school, and nobody thought to ask about my relationship with my sister when I was screened for abuse, so there was a perception between my teachers and my parents that I was lazy and incompetent​. This did not help my self-esteem.\n\n\nWhen I got to college, I was struggling with anxiety and depression. My grades reflected this. My sister asked what was wrong and I foolishly confided in her that I was having mental health concerns. She had just finished law school, and being a naturally manipulative person besides​ this, she had little difficulty in persuading my parents to revoke my tuition. When I expressed great distress over this, she offered an alternative: she would 'mentor' me. This was a power play to bring me under her control, and after one semester she had made me so miserable with emotional​ abuse that I ended up dropping out of school. I've never forgotten this betrayal​​ because my parents helped to make it possible. You don't forget things like that.\n\n\nI hadn't maintained very many friendships. I didn't get a girlfriend until I was 21, and when I did, I made a lot of mistakes that cost me independence and autonomy. I was working low-paying retail jobs with no real direction despite lofty dreams of one day becoming a doctor. When I was 23, I met a girl who inspired me. I started seeing a therapist. I went back to community college, brought up my GPA and got into a local four-year university. My sister tried her hardest to convince me that I was ruining my life. I pressed on.\n\n\nAbout eight months ago, my therapy hit a wall. I'd been diagnosed bipolar, but I didn't exactly fit the bill. We decided to backtrack ​so​me and started with my parents' divorce. A lot of that stuff had already been processed, so we talked a bit about my sister. I didn't even know I was sharing anything noteworthy until I was presented with the full picture and it occurred to me that I was face-to-face with the source of my trouble that I could never put a name to.\n\nSince then, it's been a long, lonely, and emotional journey to establishing self-worth and independence. I can't convince my family that what happened to me is true, but that's alright for the moment. I'm doing better than ever. I'm determined not to let her control me or harm me. She's tried: whenever she perceives weakness she'll belittle me and degrade me like she used to, but I turn it right back around on her. I'm done being intimidated. I'm done being abused. I won't tolerate her in my presence any longer without letting her know what she is, and I can tell she's sensed the change in me. It's created a rift between us occupied by mental violence, and for the first time, I'm holding my ground. \n\n\nTL;DR: Sister is a Narc, beat me a lot, emotional abuse, psychological abuse, got me to quit school and turned our parents against me, I'm super salty about it and I'm getting better.",

They see the adult son leave the family and cannot really join the dots, as the Narcs play such a good game of otherwise happy families. The enabler/covert mother sticks by the diseased narritive of the main Narc father, and sibling hitch along with the diseased bullshit aswell. It can be a malignant scenario, yet the abused scapegoated sibling is painted to be the one that is 'not right ' - or however they word it to the aforementioned mutual friends.\n\nI have one friend who knows the family well asking me indirectly am I back on level terms with my family, really by asking am I back in the region at all these days. To which I simply said no. There is no value in me trying to tell him the issue in full, it just won't be correctly interpretable by him chances are. I'll just look like the one who is failing to get on with his own life, which is partly true of course.\n\nSo the question that I'm getting to is well the parent Narcs give their game away eventually - as in 5 or 10 years down the line - when it becomes increasingly difficult to hold their nasty false narrative together? I know my mother hates my father underneath, same as she hates her father, myself, and all men possibly. My father hates himself, and has failed to direct rightful hate at his own mother, and so they offset hate onto me, and whoever they can in this twisted subliminal way. I'll be honest I'm fucking sick of them. I do wonder if time will tell though - will it become apparent to mutual acquaintances just why I broke from this family system. Will the horrible dynamic become revealed to others in time? Or do I, as scapegoat, just forget about it and insist to myself on doing what's best for me?  With the attitude of who gives a flying fuck what anyone else thinks? I'm so angry at my family for their pathetic selfish contorted ways \n\nCan you relate to the frustration? Has time told a truer story for some of you? Has time shown them to others to be the cold hearted unloving people they are? ",

I have appreciated some comments I've seen recently about how traumatizing the process can be versus immediately freeing, though the relief of not having to deal because I said \"no\" has been a giant weight lifted. \n\nI feel numb often, going through the motions, but I also focus on the mundane and routine to keep my wits about me and fight off loneliness and welcome the numbness sometimes in a weird way. I work really hard to not be cynical about every bond that can be formed by engaging with positive and upbeat people whom I am thankful for being in my life. \n\nIt's still hard. I just feel a piece of me missing even though I know it's mourning for what never was and what others seem to have \\-\\- supportive, loving family. I fear abandonment while simultaneously living in a state of hyper\\-vigilance about what I share and with whom. I feel like an alien sometimes because I have no idea how to express why I am where I am in life without such family of origin ties. \n\nI plan on journaling some things just to get through painful memories that linger. I guess most of all I want to continue to love and care for others, but the damage done makes me feel distant from people in finding commonalities and trying to relate though I am a sociable, likable person judging from the reactions I receive from others in various settings. However, I yearn for that \"family\" everyone talks about forming outside one's FOO beyond pleasantries and topical conversations. In retrospect I have formed such tight\\-knit bonds before but even so it's been with people who have a soft place to fall that they seem to expect everyone to have. So a part of me has held off in naming networks of friends and acquaintances as such because I don't want to seem a certain way \\-\\- clingy or desperate I suppose. I've been searching for that for years without feeling like I'm getting any closer to really establishing that. Is it possible? Anyway thanks for reading.

        "text": "The last few years, my mother's abuse has gotten worse, but it was only a few months ago that I really realized it. My mother has always instilled in me that I am incapable of making big decisions, that I cannot tolerate challenges, and that I \"better let her do\" complicated adult things, as opposed to teaching me how to do them myself. I used to think \"wow. I really must be stupid if I don't know how to do XYZ....I guess I *should* let her\".\n\nI recently discovered that my mother stole my identity, in 2015. So I thought back to what I was doing in 2015. I was suicidal that year. I had been left by my longtime boyfriend, was drinking heavily, and had been cut out of my social circle. I was drugged and raped some time after, and was classically victim blamed by my mother. At the time, I assumed that I was just a mess, that all of these situations were really my fault.\n\nI am absolutely livid and heartbroken that during one of the worst times in my life, my own mother was opening credit cards in my name and trying to sweep it under the rug before I noticed. The same woman has suggested I marry a rich man to pay off my student debts. I feel I have been taken for a fool.\n\nI currently live with my mother and I cannot really express my rage without risking the roof over my head (I move out in September). I am starting to think of all the times I second guessed my own intelligence or worth, and realizing that I have always been a fucking adult, and that she does NOT \"know better\" about anything. I always take a passive role socially-- I won't initiate even a polite \"hello\" to my coworkers, because I feel like a child, who does not belong among the adults. I feel like I am at sea without a raft. I am a student, completely self funded, and do not have the financial freedom to explode on her and cut all ties right now. \n\nI guess I am looking for advice on how to build my self worth, now that I realize I've been molded, two timed, and swindled into believing that I am a dolt.",

Sometimes I'm feel angry about it, but the bulk of my anger I got through a long time ago. It flares up once in a while, but now I just feel really.. I don't know. Emptiness?

        "text": "Hey y’all,\n\nI haven’t talked to my mother [62F] in about 3 years, and I’ve gotta be honest, it’s been great for my mental health. She was never physically abusive, but she has a serious martyr complex, and loves to play mind games to keep people pitying her. She’s also a hoarder. My sister [28F] is very close to her, and does not seem to want a relationship with me if I don’t have a relationship with my mother, so we don’t talk much except to wish each other happy birthday and merry Christmas over text. My father passed away about 4 years ago, and my mother handled it by refusing to make any of the arrangements so that I had to do it, but also refusing to speak about what she wanted with anyone but my sister. My father had expressed that he didn’t want a funeral, but we had one anyway, complete with the playing of my mother’s favorite song because, apparently, “that’s what he would have wanted”.\n\nWhen I finally made the decision to go NC, it was after I’d already tried LC, and that wasn’t working. An example: I had traveled to another city for a multi-day job interview for a job I really wanted at the time. My sister, who I was still talking to then, happened to call me while I was there, and I mentioned where I was, and that I was going to interview the next day. Apparently she told my mother. The next day, during the interview, my mother started calling and texting me over and over, with the pretext that there had been an earthquake in California (where I lived at the time), and she didn’t know where I was or if I was ok. There had been an earthquake, technically, but it was 30 miles away from where I lived, with minimal damage in a different city and no fatalities. I had to turn my phone off during the interview, because it was buzzing every minute or so. At a break, I turned it on, texted “I’m fine”, and turned it back off again. When I turned it back on again that evening, I had several voicemails, many, many texts from my mother, and an email from my aunt saying that my mother had told her I was interviewing for a job in a new city, and wishing me luck. The second day of the interview was more of the same, including a text that said “Your mother does not know where you are. You need to tell her.” I knew this to be a lie because of the email from my aunt, so I didn’t respond, but I was distracted and anxious for the rest of the interview. Whether it was because of that or just bad luck, I didn’t end up getting that job.\n\nIt took a few more months of angst from me and manipulation from my mother before I finally blocked her and stopped responding. I still feel guilty for how I handled it, since I never explained why I just disappeared. My husband [31M] doesn’t think I should feel guilty, since I’ve been doing well in the last 3 years (overcame depression, changed careers, became a team lead at my company, started singing lessons even though my mom always said I couldn’t sing, etc.). I’ve mostly been able to live with the guilt with his support, until now.\n\nNow, I’m pregnant. I don’t want to tell her. I feel so childish for feeling like this, but I’ve felt so much better without her voice in my head, and I’m afraid of how I’ll handle it, and if I’ll become depressed again. But I also feel like she deserves to know that she has a grandchild, and my sister deserves to know she’s going to be an aunt.\n\nWhat should I do, guys? Not tell her? Suck it up and tell her? Wait until the kid is here, and send a card? Then if I do tell, do they deserve to meet the kid? Can I stop that from happening? If I don’t tell, how do I explain to my future kid why they’ve never met their grandmother?",

For a period, I was staying from my family, and it was this uncle's wife, who persuaded me to \"reconcile\" with my father even though they all knew that I ran away because of how he was treating me. \nHer stand was that I need to \"forgive and forget\" . So I did and I incurred more abuse as a result of it. Stupid me ofcourse. \n\nNow that I am talking about it, I also remember another incident when my father came after me with a knife , which was the reason for me to run away from him to an entirely different state. But that night, I called my cousin ( this uncle's son) to come over because I wanted to talk to someone . So he came over and I explained to him what happened and how he has been abusive towards me. Instead of trying to console me or helping me stop the violence, his response was that \"he's just old\" , \"he's taking a lot of medication\", so just forgive him. \n\nAnyway, I am over it. These people whom I call \"family\" have nothing but aiding my violent father and brother and mother ( who's a covert narc ) in continuing their abuse. Do I have any obligation to keep in touch with them ? This aunt calls me from time to time . Even though we talk on phone for 10-15 mins , she's mostly calling to invite me to some event and not because she cares about my life or anything. ",

        "text": "So. I've posted about this here a lot recently - and thank you so much, everyone - but I think I still need advice.\n\n**TL;DR:** I want to break NC with my Narc family members in order to explain that NC is happening and get them to back off. \n\n The Sitch Is:\n\n* On the 10th of March, under the pretence of an invitation to help them rearrange their furniture, my NMum and EDad tried for the umpteenth time to bully me into submission re: my career choices, clothing, mannerisms. As their care has given me mild anxiety throughout my life leading to severe eczema, which had recently flared up due to their tantrums, my NMum made the snide statement that \"You are more anxious since being with [my Partner]\". Eventually, I realised for the first time in my life that I could walk out - and did.\n\n* In the month+ since, I have practiced Non-Contact (with my Partner's support), and taken steps to block NMum, EDad and NSis (whose reckless actions partly caused all of this) from reaching me. This was initially met with frustration, anger and passive aggression before I started blocking them. In the same time, I have become a far more confident and centred person, accepting love and positive feelings in my life. My eczema is **gone**, and itchiness mostly reappears when I think about them.\n\n- Some of the rhetoric used by NMum in these communications has been subtly aligning my Partner, whom they initially approved of, as the family's enemy. Emails have referred to her as \"your girlfriend\"; private conversations with the Narc Ex-Friends in my Partner's life have apparently shown that she is, objectively, a liar; and yet NMum is still completely ducking out of outright saying \"This is all [Partner's] fault\", partly  because she knows this would be laughably stupid, partly because she hates being directly challenged, and partly because she's a broken little coward.\n\n- *(NB: an insight for those of you with similar NParent/Partner tensions. For the past decade+, my NMum was happy to fit into the Asian stereotype of a mother who insists that the answer to my life's problems was \"Get A Girlfriend\". Now that I have, and said girlfriend turns out to be an emotionally-healthy human being who objects to her boyfriend being puppeteered by his deranged parent, she has suddenly seen it as a bad idea. I got a perfect explanation for this:)^1*\n\n&gt; ...they will want you to do what they want because they want it and not because you want it -- and, in fact, if you actually want to do what they want, then that's too much like sharing and you wreck their fun and they don't want it anymore. They want to get what they want from you without giving you what you want from them. Period.\n\n* In the last week, NMum has changed tack: rather than fire and fury, she's attempted to sweetly undermine my confidence through fake kindness. She had NSis send in a tacky Hallmark card; bothered my Partner's Mum asking if I'm OK (she sensibly said I'm very happy); and as of yesterday, sent a text:\n\n&gt;I'm worried that you are unhappy and it's my fault. But if you're sticking within situations that are making you anxious or unhappy, there's always ways back, son: if you have any anxieties and need a way out, at any time - we are here. Unfreighted by anger or blame - we're here. Just so you know.\n\n\n* **Here's What I Think:** All of the above seems to be very quietly implying that my Partner is trapping me within the job, clothing, mannerisms and lifestyle choices of which NMum doesn't approve; surely if I were in my *right* mind I'd just do as NMum says!^2 My partner agrees and worries that this is leading to a face-to-face confrontation - and we have openly discussed it and agreed that in such a confrontation, I would fight this battle myself. \n\n* **What I Want To Do**: break NC for a single instance. My current problems are that \"The Trifecta\" (NMum, NSis and EDad) won't stop attempting to break contact; and that they are convinced that my Partner is forcing me to remain with her in anxious misery (an idea we find laughable). There is a grain of reason in this, given that the last time they saw me I was anxious and unhappy, and they've not heard anything since then; they just won't even contemplate that they caused it. \n\n* **So:** I am contemplating penning a letter to the Trifecta (with the help of my Partner and possibly a legal adviser) clearly explaining that we will not contact each other and why, and the consequences of any future attempts to do so. A sort-of Pre-Cease-And-Desist, if you will. It would very explicitly say that the terms of NC include not replying to the letter itself.\n\n* **Should I Do It?** While I've made my peace with such an action cementing me as \"The Black Sheep\" and cutting me off from even the nicer relations in my family (Trifecta are *super good* at being the victim), I fear that the reaction would be more anger - and the face-to-face confrontation that we fear would happen as a result.^3  There's not a lot I can do to prove that Partner isn't controlling me - NMum will keep projecting that on to her as long as NMum herself isn't pulling the strings. But I want to at least *try* to get the Trifecta out of my life for good. \n\n**Could this work?**\n\n\n1. *http://www.halcyon.com/jmashmun/npd/traits.html*\n\n2. *My Partner has taken a sabbatical from work to pursue her creative interests; while she has savings and is looking for casual Part-Time work, I am still working to support us both. In the mind of NMum, this probably counts as imprisonment; there have been similar arrangements in our extended family, and it is indeed that which she has had with EDad for my entire existence. Not that she'd admit to it.*\n\n3. *It does not help that the Trifecta's favourite film is 'The Godfather', nor that they have recently become fans of the odious bigoted arsewipe Jordan Peterson.*",

My husband is dropping it off today.  The second was an email to the retirement home where Nmom lives, letting them know not to contact me along with a brief explanation of why.\n\nBoth letter and email were hard to write, and I had a little cry after the letter to Nmom, but once the email was sent and the letter in the envelope, all I felt was relief.  I'm free.  Free from the lies, the manipulation, the endless circular arguments, the constant passive-aggressive button pushing, and her self-centred 'no one matters but poor me' victim mentality.\n\nI have blocked the retirement home number on my phone, so Nmom can't call me.

Sorry, it's me so and so.\"\n\nToday, I was told that he randomly contacted someone on my film crew that he claims he never talks to, that he knows he was blocked from working on the crew. He allowed me to take a photo of the message, where he's admitting that he's aware that he isn't allowed on-set, so I now have proof that he has foreknowledge of it and can't claim that he was unaware if he tries to come onto set, pretending to have been invited.\n\nI was pretty shaken up for a few hours :(  I've been feeling really good for almost a month, and then today I went right back to the ugly place and I was really sad that I could still be triggered so hard.\n\nInterestingly enough, the director got wind of what was happening because she figured out that I was performing a grounding exercise to myself. Turns out she's also a survivor, having been married to a narcissistic sociopath.\n\nIt was great that I was near someone that understood, but felt so gross that I was so transparent.",

        "text": "Ever since I seen her new victim all that seems to make me feel better is shitposting passive aggressive memes on facebook about what I experienced in the relationship. I not only blocked her, but I blocked her family, friends, and new bf.\n\nIs it normal to want revenge right after the abuse? I feel she made me out to be such a bad guy and it gives me this feeling like im crazy or no one understands. Part of me doesn't care if people understand or not and kind of wants to expose the people who are siding with her so I can also remove them from my life. \n\nI am waiting on some books to arrive that I hope will help me through some of these emotions. I am a mess right now, one minute I can be damn near tears beating myself up and the next minute Im pissed off not caring about her and wanting to cut people out of my life that side with her based on how unhealthy she has been for me and how that reflects on the people that surround her. \n\nDid you experience anger towards your abuser and affilliates? How did you deal with it, and how can I keep from making myself look like a mess without trying too hard to show out for her?\n\nI just want to be me, not her exboyfriend. I don't want to carry this drama with me so obnoxiously but I don't want to bottle it up either, it helps to get it out and share those memes, even if they are pretty much ignored or only liked by a handful of my close friends.",

An considered each other friends.\nPoint I'm trying to make here is. I didn't know her well enough to know she was a narc. Tbh I didn't know what a narc was till after we got married! We got together in 09 got married in 2011. She love bombed the hell out of me!! Lets put it this way. I knew after 11 days that I was going to marry her. Without a doubt! An I did. Well we started using a certain drug for bedroom purposes. An of course like always. When you make bad decisions bad things happen. She really messed me up emotionally! Almost to the point of suicide. It has changed me forever! I will never get back to who I was before!! We split. I got clean, an after a little over a year (an still in turmoil over this woman) I started pressing for a divorce. She says she doesn't want a divorce. That she still loves me. An that she wants to get clean an make things work. An so she got clean an we start rebuilding. Regains the trust of my family, an hers. Starts her games again messing with my head. Cheats on me blames me and leaves me high an dry!\nCome to find out it wasn't the drugs. She's a narc! She just used me to gain the trust of her family, an mine to get what she wanted and find another supply. An burned off! An now have to start healing process over. An really its even worse than before!! Knowing it wasn't real only hurts more! An I have this hate in me that I can't get rid of. I've never hated anyone. Ever!! An i feel like its destroying my soul. But i can't make it go away. I can't function at work hardly. My mom has COPD an cancer an doesn't have much longer. An I recently found out my dad has hydrocephalitus (water on the brain) an needs surgery but his heart is to weak. An she still consumes my thoughts. How can someone be so evil? I couldn't do the things she has done to someone I don't like. Sry for the rant. But this really is the shortest version I could type. ",

I've had to switch to a kid's tooth brush because adult toothbrushes are too big in my mouth and it makes me gag. \n\nI need to see a dentist because it's been too long, but I'm worried I will gag when the hygenist begins working in my mouth or that I will be triggered. Are there trauma-informed dentists out there? Any tips on how to find one?",

Anyways, she's gone, but Nex pleaded total innocent -- though he never once apologized or expressed any sentiment implying he was at least sorry for what I was going through. He also continued harassing behaviours.\n\nOur offices are in different rooms, and he would just come to the room my office was in, like all the time. All day, all night. All the time. I asked someone to warn him that if he didn't stop I'd have to make a complaint. He started doing it MORE. He also started using his work email to send private party info etc. to make sure I'd know all these details about his life. After the fourth non=work related email in a week, I blocked his work email. \n\nI also made a formal harassment complaint. And I feel like shit. Deep down I think I always wanted an apology and to recover this illusion that the guy I dated wasn't a Narc. I don't want to be that office harpy who files harassment complaints \"for revenge, jilted ex, this is why women shouldn't be allowed into offices\", etc. I don't exactly think I will \"win\" this harassment complaint. Either ways my reputation is just ruined. I also feel tremendous anxiety about \"winning\" and \"fucking up his future\". I just feel awful around. \n\nI feel I've bee holding up well until I filed that harassment complaint. Now it's like I'm drowning in depression and anxiety.",

        "text": "I posted this over in r/raisebynarcissists, but probably should have posted it here instead.  oh well.  :o\\)\n\nAsking for some  advice...  Here is the background: nMom will not email, text, or call  unless I initiate.  This means I talk to her about 5 times a year when I  call for Mother's Day/Father's Day/Birthday/Thanksgiving/Christmas.  \\(I  call because I think this basic courtesy is a decent act, but don't  always call.  Father's Day is included because e/nDad will eventually  tell me how much nMom misses me and hands the phone off to her.\\)\n\ne/nDad  is routinely hysterical, but when I stopped responding to the hysteria,  I just get some periodic guilty emails/texts about how he's sooooooo  old and inept and incompetent.  \\(He's actually in pretty good health for  his age and his incompetence is self\\-imposed.\\)\n\nSince  I started grey rocking, he now just sends stupid questions in \\(what I  think\\) is an attempt to keep me talking.  \"Whatever happened to the  Opera browser?\"  Google it.\n\nBut at this  point, I have more interactive and engaging conversations with random  people standing in queues with me, and I'm tired of indulging him.  I  think he keeps the dumb conversations going so he can feel good about  how we're still talking \\(he's such a good parent!\\) or feel normal \\(or something\\).  Of course, when he tries to tell me how much nMom misses me, he can't resist telling me that she misses my pets more nearly every time \\(oh how funny and unintentionally truthful.\\)\n\nI'm quite sure  that any attempt to discuss what's wrong with our relationship will  lead to weepy hysterics and accusations against me \\(I tried many moons  ago \\- even a basic questioning his logic leads to \"Well, I don't  understand why YOU \\&lt;blah blah blah blah\\&gt;\"\\).  This is also the  reason why I haven't written a NC/LC letter \\- it will just cause more  headache for me, and they don't live nearby.\n\nI  know the \"relationship\" is over, but maintain some contact just  in case \\(which is faulty logic in itself\\).  I don't want them closer,  but I'm also not sure I'd see them any more frequently if they did live closer.  They actually don't know the actual address of where I live, as the only address they have for me is a post office box.\n\nWe only see  each other about once a year.  There's no more family near them now.  I've been considering going VLC and just not  discussing location any more, but he will inevitably ask point blank and  I'm a bad liar who feels obligated to answer with the truth \\(another  way nRents maintained control for years.\\)\n\nBut  e/nDad is discussing more and more moving to my \"general area\" \\(he means within a 2 hr drive\\).  I can handle them at a distance but don't want them closer by.  Has anyone else had a similar situation, where  e/nRents are just mopey and passively guilty, but want to move closer to  you geographically \"to be close\" \\(to spy, control, obsess and guilt\\) ?  Did you manage to postpone or dissuade them?  How  did it end up?  I'm refusing to help them, because I suspect they won't put forth the effort to do it themselves \\(since everyone else should do things for them\\) and hopefully not move any closer.",
