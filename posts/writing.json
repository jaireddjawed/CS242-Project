I hadn't written much in years but that was the nail in the coffin. Drop me in the ground, I thought, and get it over with.\n\nMany years later after my father's sudden death and my grandmother's terminal cancer diagnosis I just put pen to paper one day and scribbled out the first pages of what would become a breezy fantasy novel WIP. I handed it to my wife for her take and sat on my hands in wait. She said \"My babe can write!\" A month later I was finished, and I started another. \n\nIt could just be me taking the advice the wrong way but I don't think I'm alone. I'm stupid, foolish, overly literal, but a lot of people share the narrow-minded focus and defeatist attitude I have, even if they're not dumb. If you devour stories your whole life like I did, you will \"know\" how to write. You gain an innate knowledge of the process when your mind alights on turns of phrase, cool words, plot points that make you go back and re-read them, all that stuff, book after book and year after year. Books themselves can be your first teachers, and you will know on an instinctive level how to fashion the words to make a readable story. Then you take it to writers groups, teachers, editors and let them critique it, tear it down, tear you to pieces, and make the story compelling.\n\nIf you're a lifelong reader then you know a lot more about writing in your favorite genre than you think. Start there, push through the block, and see what comes out. Then take it to a group and have them gently (or in my case, decidedly brutally) take apart and show you what works and what doesn't, and build off of that. You know a lot--enough for a good foundation at the bare minimum. Don't waste twenty years of your life like I did. You know a lot about what you're passionate about, so write that. Write what you know.","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1678720838.0},{"title":"Advice for Novice Writers: Let your readers be \"wrong\" about descriptions","author":"purpleplumas","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/writing\/comments\/11qmjcf\/advice_for_novice_writers_let_your_readers_be\/","text":"TL;DR not everything needs a clear description, and caring too much about description will hurt your story. Learn to leave some descriptions out so that the reader can decide things for themselves.\n\nA common pitfall for new writers (including myself when I first started) is being too obsessed with the details of the people and settings. This is because we use writing as a means to convey things we visualize in our head, even though writing is not a visual art (painting, sculpting, etc.), and we want to share what we see.\n\nHere's the thing: the readers are never going to have the same journey as you. Being a writer and being a reader are not the same thing, even for professional writers who read someone else's work. Your job is to translate your experience as the imaginator of the story into an experience that the reader can appreciate.  And the fun thing about literal language translations is that they are often not translated word-for-word in favor of capturing the artistic essence of the words being written. Similar to the \"artistic essence\", you will have to scrap things that only make sense or matter to you to give your reader the same emotional payoff that your story gives you.\n\nTo give an example, I'm going to give a lightly-paraphrased excerpt from the book I'm reading (*The Calder Range* by Janet Dailey. I haven't finished it yet so no spoilers, please). I'm going to explain why it works and contrast it a lower-quality paraphrase of my own that would reflect something I might have written at an earlier level of writing. For context, this is in 19th-century Texas.\n\n>The shop bell above the door signaled three customers. Lorna immediately recognized the heavily rouged women with their bright-colored gowns. Her reactions was an instant withdrawal of obvious interest. A respectable female didn't acknowledge the presence of \"scarlet ladies of the night.\" They dressed to draw attention to themselves--\"attract business\" was the way they put it.\n\nThe page goes on about how Lorna and her friend feel about the women. The next couple of pages don't give much more info about their appearance. We learn one of them is named Pearl and has \"henna-colored\" hair, another one has black hair but is never identified by name, and the third one is Jenny. Jenny \"didn't look any older than Lorna, even with the rouge and painted mouth.\"\n\nWe're not given explicit information on every adjective of the women's names, hairs, and dress colors. Still, it's enough info to *support* the main point of the scene, >!which is Lorna's internal conflict between her excitement to have sex once she's married and her indoctrinated belief that enjoying sex is wrong for women. This internal conflict is further fueled by a conversation one of the women initiate with her, because Lorna was trying on her veil when they arrived.!<\n\nGiven the way I used to write, this is similar to how I would have handled this scene if I were on my first learning curve:\n\n>The shop bell above rang as three women walked in, all wearing red lipstick and bright dresses. Lorna saw that they were \"scarlet ladies of the night\" and did her best to ignore them, even though she especially liked the striped lavender dress on the woman with black hair.  \n>  \n>A woman with scarlet hair ran to a display of bonnets. \"Jenny, look at this!\" she called in her sunny yellow dress.  \n>  \n>Jenny was a girl who looked Lorna's age. She had brown hair and eyes like her, too. \"Yeah, Pearl?\" she asked.  \n>  \n>\"Don't you think this bonnet would go good with your blue flower dress?\"  \n>  \n>\"I think it would,\" chimed the black-haired woman, who was tanner than the others from the Texas heat.\n\nBecause I cared so much about describing how they looked, the scene is centered around minor characters instead of Lorna. Doing so takes away the emotional significance of the scene, which is integral to the arc of a main character. Even Lorna's emotions are specifically derailed; she goes from being curious about their lack of chastity to only caring about a specific dress. Not only that, but the overinvestment made me be redundant without realizing it at first: \"red lipstick\" followed by \"scarlet ladies\", as well as the use of \"scarlet\" to refer to a job and a hair color just one sentence apart.\n\nThe readers don't need to know every dress and eyeshadow color of every prostitute that Lorna sees. The only thing the reader needs to know to keep the scene going forward is that Lorna meets a group of prostitutes in a clothing shop. She knows they're prostitutes because they dress differently from most women with heavy makeup, red lipstick, and bright dresses. We can visualizes their differences as Pearl the red head, Jenny the teenager, and a nameless black-haired one.\n\n*Anything not explicitly mentioned can be filled in with the reader's imagination, and an immersed reader will fill in the gaps without thinking about it*. It might not be the same dress colors Dailey imagined. It might not be historically accurate. But if your reader can recall the clothes that the characters wore better than what the point of the chapter was, you're not doing your job as a story teller.\n\nDescriptions supplement the story. They are not *the* story.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1678743257.0},{"title":"When writing stories, should you ever use numerals instead of actual word numbers?","author":"Funny-Ad-3194","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/writing\/comments\/11qqtue\/when_writing_stories_should_you_ever_use_numerals\/","text":"Say the MC is reading a book and they tell someone when it was written.

You can spend too much time on them and essentially just procrastinate on the story infinitely preparing your characters.

This is certainly easier than flipping through the thousands of words you\u2019ve already written that it\u2019s lost in as to remember certain aspects of a character, that is, if you have realized you\u2019ve forgotten something at all.

Ever since then, I've struggled to write even though I've been thinking about my story, my world constantly. The time I didn't write, I spent with drawing new characters, worldbuilding and other things FOR the story. I know what the next couple of chapters will contain, I don't lack ideas or my love for my world, I just can't get myself to open up my document.\n\nDo you think I will be able to go back to writing as much as I did before?

That could be one reason why I struggle. I also don't know if writing is my special interest or simply a hyperfixation, which would mean that I could lose my passion at any point. Then again, last year was incredibly hard.. I lost a family member, I relapsed in terms of an addiction, I am also depressed.\n\nThrough all of that, I've always had my story but as time went on, I started to doubt myself even more than before. Now I can't even look at someone elses work, writing or art, without thinking I am worse, my ideas are worse.. and that I should stop. But I don't want to. I just feel like I am not good enough even though I know my world is beloved, what I write is beloved by others. Instead of writing, I spent my days in my head, daydreaming what I want to write, too. Or I end up scrolling social media on hours without wanting to.\n\n\n\nTldr: I love writing, I love my story and it's on my mind 24\/7 but I can't get myself to write something down and am afraid I am losing my passion.

I already tried this a few months ago with a novel draft that I sent out to about 50 different agents. Out of the 11 who responded, not a single one of them wanted to look at any additional pages. They all rejected it and said \"the project wasn't for me... publishing is subjective... yadda yadda\".  \n\n\nI've since then kinda scrapped that project and have been working on another one. The first draft is 80% of the way done, and I think it surpasses the quality of my last project by a far margin.  \n\n\nMy dilemma, however, is once this project is done, I really don't know what to do with it. The publishing industry seems hyperfixated on being \"well-known\" even though for many debut authors, being well-known is impossible unless you're a celebrity or social media star. It kinda feels like an entry-level job that requires years of experience that's kind of impossible to get.  \n\n\nAnd while self-publishing is also a route, it's also difficult in the sense that not only do I not have funds for editors and cover designers, but again, it depends heavily on how well-known you are.  \n\n\nSo, I guess my question is, what do I do with this project? Do I try to go through a publisher again? Do I try to self-publish it? How do I gain this supposed notoriety I need to gain an agent's approval, or how would I even start to get readers on a self-published piece?  \n\n\nI'm pretty serious about writing, and I want to turn it into a career, but it also feels incredibly demotivating when I invest 100s of hours into a project and I don't have any reliable platform to get it out to readers. I really don't even care about the moneymaking aspect of writing, I just want people to see and enjoy my work.  \n\n\nIf you have any suggestions on what I can do, or maybe what worked for you, it'd be appreciated. Please don't leave any comments like \"you gotta learn to write for yourself and not others\". I've been writing for several years now and want to start working on a platform. I dearly appreciate the insight, but I'm not interested in a TedTalk.  \n\n\nThank you in advance for any responses.","upvote_ratio":0.57,"created_utc":1678506630.0},{"title":"Is there a word in English for this?","author":"culturehoe","url":"\/r\/EnglishLearning\/comments\/11o9teb\/is_there_a_word_in_english_for_this\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.4,"created_utc":1678506427.0},{"title":"Page count","author":"yarobin_","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/writing\/comments\/11of9br\/page_count\/","text":"If I'm writing a series of around 4 books, do they all have to be the same page count (or close to each other) ?

That is what I describe as fabricated drama.\n\nI've boiled the most common offenders down to:\n\n* **Nerfing** \\- Usually enacted through the delay or diminishing of a character's known and documented abilities just to create pressure when put up against a less than formidable foe. E.g. Halo Chief v Locke, most anime and Hollywood blockbuster climax battles.\n* **\"This Could Have Been Avoided\"** \\- Dramatic irony can certainly be a valuable plot device, though, this form of drama is always the product of a lack of communication where the most basic conversations have the power to prevent entire plot lines from occurring. It's the deliberate and often unnecessary extension or catalyst of conflict as brought on by illogical and nonsensical dialogue or lack thereof. E.g The entire plot of 13 Reasons Why\n* **Plot Twists** \\- While I'm usually one to defend against the demystification of lore as it often serves to devalue the ambiguity of abilities and back stories, a well done plot twist must be cunning in how it subverts expectations while being realistically explainable in the context of your written universe. A plot twist for cheap shock factor and to reveal or bring back a lazily written \"big bad\" is just that, bad writing. E.g. Star Wars \"Somehow, Palpatine returned\"\n\nI consider this to be a product of the double-edged sword that is plot armor. Where we often see plot armor used to save protagonists from dire consequence and the most insurmountable odds, plot armor also ensures that your protagonist is never 100% safe from even the most basic obstacles.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Does this \"writing mechanic\" already exist by a different name? Could the definition use more refinement? Are there other, more common methods of fabricating such drama that I have missed? What are some iconic moments in entertainment where you've found yourself dumbfounded by these very instances?\n\n**This is not a thread to bash or boast about yours or others fandoms.

I am the first writer they have dealt with so I do not have an idea of what exactly they are expecting.  They will have full ownership, full control, full commercial rights.  I will not receive royalties.  They want unlimited revisions and modifications.  I do not often charge too much for my services but this would be the first time that I am being asked to ghost write so I do not know how much my name on a project should be worth for me.  I am considering a hybrid structure  (ie. a per-word rate for the base text and then an hourly rate for any time spent revising).  They are a small company and I only have a year's experience so most amounts I've seen online seem like too much to ask for\/too far outside of my usual pricing.  I am looking for any advice at all and a general idea regarding what percentage more you would expect for ghost writing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHi, so a little bit of background, I have been writing freelance for about a year now.  I mainly write character backstories for boardgames and TTRPGs.  I am using it to fund time off from a standard 9-5 so that I have more freedom to work on my main writing projects.  Because this is more or less to break even with the cost of living (and out of pure enjoyment), I admittedly do not charge much for my services.  (\\~$50-70\/1k words wherein I maintain all commercial rights and the work still is attributed as mine.  I usually charge a flat $20 fee for commercial rights).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith all of this in mind, a company reached out and as far as I can tell they want to be the next Dimension 20.  They would like me to ghost write for them.  I would get no royalties, I would get no credit, and they would have full commercial rights.  I suppose I am now in a position where I do not know how much to charge for ghost writing.  Everything I see online is so insanely out of line from what my pricing scheme usually is that I genuinely don't think it's fair.  That being said I guess I'm trying to figure out the value of the credit-- to produce a work and passing it off as someone else's... to me... that should be worth a pretty penny.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe only information that I have is the following:\n\n* They need a series of character backstories written around provided artwork.  (They would also like some story writing and setting descriptions).\n* They average in length of about 1500 words.\n* They want unlimited revisions.\n* They get 100% ownership and all commercial rights  so once it's out of my hands, it's gone.\n* They are a small company that has not started producing content yet and are essentially getting their ducks in a row to begin creating content.  (They did say that they try to be fair but they will haggle if they don't think the work is worth the price I say it is-- but I also am able to haggle if I think the agreed upon payment is too low given any additional work I needed to do during revisions).\n* They have many good reviews (20 reviews, all are 5 stars) from various graphic artists but as far as I can tell, I am the first writer they have approached (I am better reviewed with over 50 reviews all of which are 5 stars).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I know I need to take into consideration for the project:\n\n* The number of backstories is not known but I think it will be an ongoing thing.  (Once I complete the first one and know approximately what they are looking for I know I will be able to adjust pricing however, if I lowballed them the first time then trying to come in more reasonably with the second one may be immediately dismissed so I want to try to get it at least in the right ballpark now)\n* I will have fewer small projects on the go if I take this on as this will take up more time.  It will also affect the number of large projects I will be able to take on.  On one hand this would take uncertainty out of my day-to-day a little but on the other, business has been pretty steady with two or three orders a week.\n* Unlimited revisions could lead to projects being an extra hour of work or an extra 30hrs depending on just how picky they are\/ what exactly their vision is.  While they can see my writing samples, because I seem to be the first writer, I have no idea what style they are expecting.\n* Because they are a small company I know they won't have a huge budget but if I didn't price well enough then I may may regret it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am thinking that I should set a per-word rate and then charge for my time above and beyond that when it comes to revisions.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIe. If I charged... for simplicities sake, $0.10\/ word and $20\/hr then if I wrote a 550 word piece and then they wanted revisions that took me an additional hour but technically dropped it to 500 words then I would charge them 550 at $0.10\/word + $20.  If I had written a 500 word piece and the word count went up to 550 as a result of the revisions then I would charge them 500 at $0.10\/word +$20.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nObviously these are random dollar amounts but that's kind of the idea.  Do people do this?  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn case you couldn't tell, I am completely out of my depth right now.  Finances are not my forte and despite the sheer number of projects I have worked on over the past year I still feel like a complete amateur hoping not to be caught for the fraud I am (or at least feel like).  My name feels like it should be important and giving it up feels like it should be charged as such but also I feel like my name doesn't really matter and has no weight to it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know internet people, I need advice-- what percentage more would you charge to ghostwrite something?","upvote_ratio":0.64,"created_utc":1678290505.0},{"title":"Writing \u201cfiller\u201d characters into the first chapter?","author":"Jasmine_Dragonista","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/writing\/comments\/11meamv\/writing_filler_characters_into_the_first_chapter\/","text":"I\u2019m revising the opening chapter of a book, and changed the storyline a little while ago so that the main character has an altercation with someone else. \u201cIt\u2019s for survival of the fittest\u201d type reasons.

Sometimes, we just want to get straight to the point.\n\nThat's where exposition comes in handy. It allows the writer to convey important information and set the stage for the story without wasting time on needless subtleties or leaving the reader guessing. This approach is especially effective in genres like science fiction and fantasy, where the world-building can be complex and multifaceted. By using exposition, the writer can quickly bring the reader up to speed and ensure that they are fully invested in the story from the get-go.\n\nOf course, like all things in writing, there is a time and a place for exposition. It can be overused, or drawn out unnecessarily, which can detract from the reader's experience.

Tbh at first I had no plot or characters in mind, but all I knew was that I just wanted to write something. So I created a simple character and wrote some short stories with it so that I would have time to create my world and characters while improving my writing until one day I would decided that it's time to jump into the main saga. I previously had no serious plans for these short stories but as time passed I really began to like them and decided to write them as short story collection, serving as a standalone spinoff that takes place between a long time skip in the main story, between two major events of my story. But then later, instead of one character I decided to have three and write a standalone for each one. I am planning to make it so that the readers wouldn't have to read my spinoffs to understand the main story, but I also want to include a lot of important worldbuilding and character growth for the main characters, which shows how they changed over all the years (like real life) which characters are separated and reunited after years. Oh btw, I want to start the main story after the time skip and write the second major incident first, and then include the first major incident and everything before that, later on as one long or multiple short flashbacks (I know it might sound strange out of context but it fits well in the story).\n\nI always though it would be be a good idea to publish the spinoffs between the main series, but recently I have been having doubts and wondering if I will get in troubles with publishers for this strange order of the story timeline. I would love to hear your ideas about it and tell me if I am wasting my time or not, and whether I should just forget about the spinoffs and jump in the main story.\n\nSorry for ranting for so long :)","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678199057.0},{"title":"Writing in a different language?","author":"Endeavour_Crow","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/writing\/comments\/11kymyg\/writing_in_a_different_language\/","text":"I've been working on some creepypastas to post online, however the creepypasta community in my home country is practically nonexistent.

In 3 months from this post, it will have been 12 straight years I have been linked to this purpose. What started simply as a toss away writing exercise from an English class, became a series of self insert short story's with straw characters with no purpose other than to be walls with a face to bounce dialogue off of because I was looking for a way to be distracted in my classes. Slowly overtime I had grown so attached to this small batch characters by names alone and begun to give them personality's, appearances, dreams and goals, etc. Soon enough this new direction would bump me out of the narrative entirely as my characters had a whole world to explore and were fleshing themselves out in their interactions with each other. Having begun as short story's that meant nothing at all has become a life goal that borders on obsession to complete.\n\n2-3 weeks ago I was digging through a VERY old email of mine and found the original short story by complete accident. It was tagged June\/July 2011. The narrative was sloppy, the characters wooden, and the only reason I didn't drop dead from my own past cringe was the recognition of just how much had truly changed in this past decade. Truly the only connections between old texts and the current story are the characters names and the author himself. Nothing else.\n\nOften feeling like I'm too harsh and demanding of myself to write more, this discovery has not been any less of a stressor. While I can acknowledge my journey and growth as a writer, I cant help but feel like in 12 years I should have SIGNIFCANTLY more written. Maybe even have the first of the several books coming as a series completed and published. Even when I don't write down anything my mind NEVER stops writing. With the help of a  \\*blocked VoIP and instant messaging social platform\\* that helps to keep me organized when managing any random thoughts, scenarios, lines, etc. that comes up in any moment. When I go a month to several months without writing down anything inside the draft of the book itself I feel like I can see the sands falling through the hourglass and one day ill be an old man bashing myself for never completing the story. So I don't know. Am I being just procrastinating and are actually behind my goals or should I just let things play out the way they have been?","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678051957.0},{"title":"What\u2019s your opinion on writing about your experiences vrs writing about actual people?","author":"Mysterious-Chip-1396","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/writing\/comments\/11jedlr\/whats_your_opinion_on_writing_about_your\/","text":"To explain a little more \n\nA few years ago, a friend of mine went missing.

Yes, I write for myself, but that doesn\u2019t mean reader\u2019s opinions don\u2019t matter to me, and I can\u2019t help that (to the person who said \u201csounds like a you problem,\u201d it wouldn\u2019t hurt you to be more understanding, would it?). Yes, I\u2019ll work on marketing my work; I\u2019m a very shy person, so this\u2019ll be difficult for me, but I\u2019ll try my very best. \n\nAnd to everybody who said they\u2019d be willing to read my work, thank you so much for your kindness. My story is a historic fiction set in seventh century China, but with fantasy element such as reincarnation and mythical creatures mixed in. It focuses on family and sibling dynamics, with the main love stories being observed from the MC\u2019s point of view, rather than experienced by the MC herself. Stylistically, I drew inspiration from the works of PRIEST, who\u2019s known for writing very heavy, even depressing, stories with a dash of humor and wit. I\u2019m a bit of an emotional masochist, so many of my beloved characters are fated to die (not really a spoiler, had to tag \u201cmajor character death\u201d). So yeah, I completely understand how historic fiction, with little focus on romance for the main character, and a warning for \u201cmajor character death\u201d would be a VERY unpopular read. Ultimately, my story is catered to my own very specific tastes, and I\u2019m writing to make myself laugh and cry.

I tried to write a novel for the past 4 years and recently realized that it was wasting my time- I couldn't solve the middle section of the plot, it was too out there, beyond my skill level etc. I've been taking it fairly well but its still devastating to walk away from something that you spent thousands of hours creating to watch it become nothing. I decided to try and create a nonfiction piece instead, a collection of essays, but again, I really have crumbs to work with that I think would be acceptable work. To add to that I recently got into songwriting which I enjoy, specifically rapping, but it's been difficult to make it all come to life. \n\nInsert the \"if everyone could do it that's why it wouldn't be special\" quote here but I'm really struggling on a deeper level of not making quality work. I wonder if it matters and I try not to think about the countless crumbled up works I've shed over the years. It makes me wonder if I am wasting my time and as I age and my passions are less admired by society, I feel defeated. Maybe it's our society's problem of needing to create things with the most perfect outcome.

Maybe we use that excuse to comfort the aging process. \n\n   TLDR: I guess my pain is that I don't have any tangible work of my own, that people read, reflect upon, that I can share and it's debilitating that its still the case years later.

I've been writing since I was 13, mostly fanfiction and short stories, which of course were not exactly high quality content. Now I'm 20 and while I feel like my skills have developed and my opinions on all matters have drastically changed, I'm finding it really hard to write this story that I have in mind.\n\nJust a few nights ago I had a rush of inspiration and I sat down and spent 5 hours typing on Scrivener. I had multiple ideas that I liked and I managed to pretty much get 80% of the first chapter finished.\n\nNow, today, as I was editing\u2014English is not my first language so I have a habit of nitpicking and searching for all possible mistakes\u2014I realized I hate everything about it. The more I read it, the more flawed it seems to me. Like I'm not using the right words, like I'm info dropping too hard, the characters suck or the plot is lazy. You could think of a million reasons why I hate this group of sentences I WROTE. And given the fact that I don't have anyone to check it out and give me feedback, I'm pretty much the one that has to determine if it works or not.\n\nAnd it's funny, because when I was 16 I managed to write my first full novel, and I remembered how I felt back then: I connected with the story and was able to write everyday for about 8 months until it was finished. And I loved it. I can't seem to do that now.\n\nHas anyone else gone through this? Loving your work one day and realizing that if you put it out it would be embarrassing the next? Why does this happen and how do you deal with it?\n\nI'm sorry if this seems bitchy but I'm literally on the verge of tears out of frustration. I'm frustrated with myself for not knowing what to do to do a decent job at writing and contributing to my wish of becoming an author, so I need someone else's input.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1677991318.0},{"title":"Any novel resources like this exist?","author":"labolarueda","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/writing\/comments\/11j303l\/any_novel_resources_like_this_exist\/","text":"I am an adult learner trying to pick up writing for publishing nonfiction (guidebooks for my field) and fiction for fun.

Or I thought I was finished. My agent expressed concerns that it's too long by about 40-65 pages, which had also been a concern of mine. While I wanted to get the revisions back to my agent as quickly as possible, my problem was that I've looked at the book dozens of times now, and have a hard time coming at it with clear eyes. \n\nI have an eccentric, intelligent friend who lives in a different part of the country who is well-read and had a strong sense of storytelling in general. He also happens to be on disability, so his income is often an issue. I called him and asked if he would let me come home after work and read the book to him for $20\/hr. He agreed, and we started that night.\n\nWhen my first book was published, I met with the editor, and we actually worked together reading the novel aloud to each other before it went to print. That resulted in a lot of important last minute revisions that helped the book tremendously. \n\nI've paid freelance editors in the past, but even when they're great, the whole thing can be kind of tough. They have to fit your work into their schedule, and they're often working on multiple projects at once. Plus, you don't get to have real-time conversations about the book as it's unfolding. \n\nThe experiment with my friend turned out to be a really great solution for me. I asked him to let me know anytime he got confused or bored or when information I provided seemed redundant or unnecessary, and we came up with a ton of places to cut. Plus, his input led me to make a lot of other revisions as well.\n\nThe last freelance editor I paid charged $200\/hour, and I had to audition for him. It worked out, and he did help me, but I think this process with my friend helped a lot more. It took us around 20 hours to go through the entire book.. \n\nThis process was so successful for me, it occurred to me to post about it here because I thought it might help other people. If you have a friend who would be game, it could be worth a try. I told my friend he should make a business of it himself. Something about reading a book out loud has always helped me a lot, but reading it to an active listener sort of changed everything.\n\nEDIT: Because someone messaged me about it privately, if anyone is interested in talking to my friend, you can message me and I\u2019ll happily pass his information along.

I\u2019m not considering doing this in my own writing.\n\nI\u2019m midway through *The Tale of Genji* and the characters use and quote poetry a *lot*. Love letters, private correspondences, general conversations, they often use poetry.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how common this was in regular (aristocratic) conversations in Japan 1,000 years ago, but of course nowadays people don\u2019t regularly communicate through poetry. I was thinking if a \u201cmodern\u201d example would be quoting songs and movies. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too outlandish if someone says they\u2019ll try to do something and a person (of culture) replies \u201cdo or do not, there is no try.\u201d I recall a Japanese friend in college was doing a survey or interview thing and a question was \u201cwhat is love?\u201d and they were confused at first when everyone said \u201cbaby don\u2019t hurt me.\u201d\n\n**Legal\/copyright issues aside**, what do you think of the general idea of characters using and referencing modern \u201cpopular poetry\u201d? Not saying that all of their dialogue would be like that, but it\u2019s common enough throughout that it\u2019s \u201ca thing\u201d? It might not be odd if a movie buff character often quotes movies, but that\u2019s more of a character-specific thing. In the show Skins when the characters went to Russia, there was a woman who learned English through Friends and most of her English was Friends quotes.\n\nMaybe less obvious or more natural quotes would be more palatable? Like a character getting dumped and saying \u201cI really feel like I\u2019m losing my best friend. I can\u2019t believe this could be the end\u201d might work better than a person asking for the truth and the other person saying \u201cyou can\u2019t handle the truth!\u201d\n\nIs there a highbrow\/lowbrow difference? When Amy told Sheldon to confess his feelings for her, did it matter if he said \u201cWhen I look in your eyes and you're looking back in mine, everything feels not quite normal. Because I feel stronger and weaker at the same time. I feel excited and, at the same time, terrified. The truth is, I don't know what I feel, except I know what kind of man I want to be\u201d (Spider-Man) or \u201cYou pierce my soul. I am half agony, half hope. ~~Tell me not~~ Do not tell me that I am too late, that such precious feelings are gone forever\u201d (Jane Austen)?\n\nAgain, legal issues aside, in general, do you think that there\u2019s a place for *Genji*-like \u201cpoetry quotes\u201d with songs\/movies\/TV as the modern equivalent? Or at most maybe \u201cpoetry quotes\u201d should be \u201cactual\u201d poetry and the author should create their own poetry if they want their characters to use poetry?\n\nI think readers accept that characters don\u2019t speak 100% naturally and it may be more\u2026polished and refined than would be in an actual conversation. If a character who isn\u2019t a poet, regardless if they know it, were to say to the spirit of a loved one that \u201cYou used to captivate me by your resonating light, but now I\u2019m bound by the life you left behind.

It was like a combination of email penpals and RPing or writing a particular character in a pre-constructed world, sometimes a fandom setting.  People would get a chance to practice their writing and development of  a character while also working towards building a larger world and story with other people's characters.  A server would archive these files so people could go back and read it.

I loved to read and pick up new words, and I was good at spelling and grammar.\n\nAll this, in conjunction with my creative nature, inspired me to write. I wrote for English class, and then on Wattpad when I was a teenager, and I always got lots of positive comments. One of my (awful) stories on Wattpad even got a few hundred-thousand reads before I deleted it. I won a couple of creative writing competitions at school, aced my English GCSE and convinced myself that I was\u2026well, talented.\n\nFast forward to about ten years later\u2014I\u2019m 25 and trying to write seriously now. It\u2019s one of my goals to write a novel, so I\u2019ve done it (almost, anyway. I\u2019ve written 3\/4ths of a novel).\n\nThroughout the process, thanks to some books+videos on writing and unbiased critique from beta readers, I\u2019ve come to the glaring realization that I think every amateur writer has at some point:\n\nMy writing is pretty terrible.\n\nIt hurts to say it, but it\u2019s the truth. I have potential, like a lot of people do\u2014but it\u2019s going to need to be honed for quite a while before I can create something worth publishing.\n\nLuckily, this painful epiphany hasn\u2019t discouraged me. I may have a long, long way to go, but I\u2019ve decided to just enjoy the journey while it lasts. I\u2019m going to continue to read and continue to write, with no expectations for money or recognition. I\u2019m not going to quit my day job, but I\u2019m going to keep writing and try to get better.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause I like it, and I want to. That\u2019s it.\n\nEDIT: Okay, maybe the phrase \u201cpretty terrible\u201d was me being a bit dramatic. I guess \u201cnot great\u201d or \u201cvery average\u201d might be a better description.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1677494288.0},{"title":"Editing endlessly.

I want to share an updated post, that maybe can help someone and anyone.\n\nSo here it is (i'll keep it as short as possible as I have so much to say)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWriting: DONT LOOK BACK AT WHAT YOU'VE WROTE. It wont do you any good simply because you will focus more on the story specifics and details and you'll focus more on tuning it up. Tune it up after you've written a chapter. Go back then. You can add and change and remove whatever you want. But doing that before a chapter is finished, you'll focus more on the previous parts and not just freely writing. \n\nSecond thing with writing i've learnt: Don't worry about typos (yeah, I'm making some while writing this). JUST WRITE. It'll take longer for you to write a single page with fixing this word or re-writing that sentence, and so on. If you have any ideas, you may lose them .\n\nFor this, I advise you to write down ideas. Its cliche I know. But a piece of paper or the notepad option in a laptop (idk abuot mac but i would assume there's a notepad fucntion) can be your best friend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor character bulding: I can't say much about this cause theres SO MUCH to do and so many ways (software, traditional, etc). So I will list what I do.\n\n1) I write interviews between characters or even me wth (character(s) here). I dont think, I just write. Or in my mind, again  I dont think. I just let it go like a film. When you watch a film, you dont think about it through the whole 2 hour movie. You focus on the film. Same with the interviews.\n\n2)I write dialogue (no descirption) between characters. Like they're talking to each other. Again I dont think. BE YOUR CHARACTER(S). This will help with future writing.\n\n3) I write scenes out that are important for character developement. Not ones about the story. I mean,  scenes that are just extra. You CAN write scenes out for chapter, but then you'll most likely change it when you add it to your book\/story. DONT THINK. WRITE.\n\nI know I've said 'dont think, write' a lot. But thinking will make you change so much as you write. You'll change THIS paragraph then you'll have to think of how to change THAT paragraph and so on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor worldbuilding:\n\nStart small, go big.\n\nStart with a simple thing. A house, a park etc or if you're abitious, a palace or a castle- something around those kinds of locations- or it can be a city if you feel like you can start there.\n\nAnd it cant be any specific place- it has to be the starting point of your story.  Does the story open up at a peasants house in a small town in victorian times? Or is it a skyscraper in a metropolis in 2100? If you know where to start, you know where to go from there. Build up after you've FULLY developed a starting location. Maybe for the victorian times example, there is something that is happening to the town, like it being burnt from a bakers shop. Or for the 2100 story, there is an addition to the city being built - and so on. You have to build up and up as you go. Then when your world is built up enough for you to expand on the world, then go on- side story parts, extra here, extra there etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLastly\n\nDONT RUSH YOUR STORY AND ITS WORLD. Take your time. Build the story as much as you can, with patience. If you rush your story, you'll miss opportunities for a very big chance to fix something major into an even bigger, changing event, or place etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's all I have to say here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope it helped.","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1677507936.0},{"title":"Any good places to take online writing courses?","author":"almarcTheSun","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/writing\/comments\/11dj1wf\/any_good_places_to_take_online_writing_courses\/","text":"Through the little experience that I gathered, I figures reading, discussing, critiquing or thinking about writing isn't writing.

I did not accept this contract, but out of curiosity, wanted to see if I could catch them in their own scam and asked to view the contract. Immediately, two things popped out at me.\n\n1. The contract listed my address somewhere that I haven't lived since 2020. I asked about whether they were viewing an old submission (I had done extensive edits to my work and re-submitted a query to Pegasus literary agents - *not* the Elliot MacKenzie branch, and wondered if they passed it onto their vanity press from there). They assured me this was based on my Jan 31 2023 submission, but in that submission, my old address was nowhere to be found, so I find this highly suspicious.\n2. The contract offers 50% royalties on an ebook. When I pressed that Amazon offers 70% if I were to self-publish, and it would be no cost to me, they responded that I could self-publish, but would have to take it down when they publish it as an ebook for me. Essentially, I'd have to lose 20% on royalties anyways, but hey, it's great because they would do so much more for me on a professional level!\n\nIt's definitely not worth the 2400 Euros they want to charge me. I'd rather just hire my own editor and cover artist at a third of the cost and self-publish where I can get better royalties if traditional publishing isn't an option.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nORIGINAL POST:\n\nI've been offered a contract with Pegasus Elliot Mackenzie Publishers Ltd, but their email states:\n\n>While this contract requires a share of the production costs to be provided by the author, it is otherwise no different to our traditional contracts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>There is however still some misunderstanding that surrounds these contracts. There are some strong comments to be found on the internet but these are aimed at 'vanity publishing', companies that take on ANY work and publish without any editing, any marketing, or any passion or integrity for the publishing industry. This is not us.\n\nI have not been given a contract outlining how much I would have to pay, but first need to reply to tell them if I am interested in pursuing this publishing option.

It was his time to shine, not mine. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, because I always let people know that they can share THEIR stuff too. It doesn't have to just be me all the time, I get that.

However, there was one instance where that really didn't work out. I don't even really remember where, when, and who, but a person described fiction writing as lying.\n\nThe description is technically right. When I write fiction, I am writing about things that to my knowledge didn't happen, as if they did. But I found it a description in such bad faith that it made me feel disgust. From time to time I thought about it and there are some problems that I have with the description.\n\n\\- It makes anyone who tells a fictional story liars. A lie is meant to deceive, but I am not sure I see that intention in the telling of a story. They are meant to inform and entertain, but before I saw the description, I don't think I ever went into a session of writing even thinking of deception. The readers going into a fiction book I would think also knows that the story is fiction, but they wouldn't think of it as a lie.\n\nThere are scores of questions on many writing boards about how to make prose and dialogue more authentic and realistic. Could this be evidence that we're all in on the lie? I think intention is key. I have read descriptions calling us biological robots and thought it was interesting. That too is technically true, but there isn't an intention behind it. Calling fiction a lie can also be just an observation, and maybe I've been programmed to just associate a lie with bad intentions.\n\n\\- The description's logic, taken to an extreme, can be taken as an attack on some of the best aspects of writing. If regular fiction writing is a lie, then what can be said of some of the writing techniques used to highlight or embellish the writing and the ideas contained? Metaphors? What about poetry, where some of the more extreme forms of exaggerations, metaphors, lines, and ideas are used?\n\nIn the end, this probably isn't worth the effort. However, one of the things that I am impressed with myself on with the books and stories I've read is that my comprehension for all of the various aspects of human thought and acts is and has become ever higher.

It's easy to describe extreme emotions, because their signs are very noticeable in a face. Like a red face, eyes watering or eyes narrowing...\n\nBut what about the difference between a sceptical look, a doubtful one, and a slightly confused one? What if someone only says \"I see\", but his face betrays that he doesn't really believe it? You can only write \"he narrowed his eyes\" or describe the positioning of his eyebrows so many times before it gets ridiculous. I find I'm reaching the end of my repertoire very quickly like this, and I wouldn't want to use the same description twice.\n\nYou could write \"she gave me a doubtful look\" or something similar, but wouldn't that be just like \"she looked at me doubtfully\", the typical weak verb + lazy adverb? I mean, grammatically you're not using an adverb when you say \"a doubtful look\", but it seems just as lazy.\n\nOkay, let's say someone makes a worried face. Instead of saying \"He looks worried\", you describe his face: His inner eyebrows went upwards and his lips puckered... err, no. That doesn't convey sadness, it's just stupid. Or maybe I'm inept. With some emotions this works, but with others not so well.\n\nHow do you crack the hard nuts?","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1382193615.0},{"title":"Research resources for works of medieval fantasy","author":"brightcarvings","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/writing\/comments\/gyz6y\/research_resources_for_works_of_medieval_fantasy\/","text":"A list of general resources that might be useful for people researching information related to medieval fantasy\n\n* [Comprehensive link portal of various medieval topics](http:\/\/www.netserf.org\/)\n* [Dictionary of swear words, slang and profanities from around the world](http:\/\/www.alternative-dictionaries.net\/) \n* [A dictionary of interesting words](http:\/\/phrontistery.info\/a.html)\n* [Essays on swordsmanship and medieval martial arts](http:\/\/www.thearma.org\/essays.htm)\n* [An etymology and history of first names by culture](http:\/\/www.behindthename.com\/)\n* [A dictionary of heraldry](http:\/\/www.heraldryclipart.com\/dc.html)\n* [Manuscripts from various medieval cultures](http:\/\/www.yorku.ca\/inpar\/)\n* [Duplicating medieval paint techniques](http:\/\/www.randyasplund.com\/browse\/tournpg\/tipg5.html)\n* [A database of medieval soldiers' service records](http:\/\/www.metafilter.com\/87203\/Their-balmy-slumbers-waked-with-strife)\n* [Medieval sourcebook](http:\/\/www.fordham.edu\/halsall\/sbook2.html) full text sources\n* [Collection of articles on medieval and renaissance names](http:\/\/www.s-gabriel.org\/names\/shortindex.shtml)\n* [Demonicpedia exist as a reference and educational resource for demons and demonology](http:\/\/www.metafilter.com\/113659\/Demonicpedia-better-know-your-demons)\n* [An Atlas of True Names](http:\/\/www.kalimedia.com\/Atlas_of_True_Names.html)\n","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1303959123.0}]
