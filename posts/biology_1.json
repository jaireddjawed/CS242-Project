You put the PPE straight back on. 6 hours later, you have lunch which also exposes you to 30mil virions, meaning you have exceeded the infectious dose of the virus. However, since that was over a 6hr period, does that impact on your likelihood of getting sick? If not, is it over a longer period of time? Can you get exposed to 40mil at 3pm on Monday and 40mil at 3pm on Tuesday and still be ok? Or is this an impossible question to answer?\n\nThank you!",

Why? Why not trick the cell into letting it out along with other chemicals. Let's say it's in a nerve cell:\n\n1. Cell: okay, 1 dopamine, check.\n2. Virus: umm... I'm supposed to go.\n3. Cell: no, I don't see you\n4. Virus: yes, you do. See, I'm another dopamine, and you where supposed to let 2 out.\n5. Cell: But, it says one. \n6. Virus: Really? must be a typo. I won't tell if you don't tell\n7. Cell: fine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nand, now the virus is free! (Replace dopamine with anything else. Bile, phages, other cells (such as following a red blood cell from the marrow).\n\nBy doing this, the cells won't be killed, making it much harder to detect. And, each of those cells can continue to produce more, allowing more than originaly. So, why don't viruses do that? Why do they just kill the cell when it's done?",

And what about muscle origins/insertions? In my family in particular, for the men the left pectoral has a consistent insertion whereas the right has frills and zigzags. It's most noticable in the adbominal muscles for most of the world's population, it's easy to spot the disparity between the shapes of each bilateral and where each section of the muscle is in relation to the other side.\n\nTLDR; Why do humans have asymmetrical faces, muscles, etc?",

What if the constant light harmed the plant and killed it? What if the plant required darkness and light in order to function properly? Eventually, anxiety took over and i marked alternative B, wich was wrong! that question was worth 25% of the tests grade, wich sucks. But, would plant A really be okay?",
