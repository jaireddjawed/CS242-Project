        "text": "Today is the 57th anniversary of the Adam West Batman show so it is the perfect time to explore its most egregious example of men writing women: Nora Clavicle and the Ladies’ Crime Club. It is the 19th episode of the third season and available to watch for free with ads [here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B09HYPTVZB/ref=atv_dp_season_select_s3) if you want to watch it for yourself.\n\nWomen’s rights activist Nora Clavicle convinces Mayor Linseed’s wife Millie to stop cooking and cleaning for the Mayor until he gives in to Nora’s demands and fire Commissioner Gordon giving Nora his job. Browbeaten by his wife, out of clean clothes and not having eaten a ‘decent’ meal in months, he gives in and Commissioner Nora Clavicle enters the room accompanied by a drum with WOMAN POWER written on its side.\n\nShe fires the entire male-only police force, installs Millie Linseed as police chief for a force of policewomen, and informs Batman that he and Robin are no longer needed since the women have everything well in hand. That isn’t enough to stop Batman, Robin, or Batgirl, so Nora Clavicle sends her ‘molls’ to rob a bank to attract their attention.\n\nThis highlights how ineffective the policewomen were. Instead of Billy Clubs, they carry rolling pins, not that they use them. An officer inside the bank as it is robbed is too focused on applying her makeup to stop the robbery. The bank robbers pass two policewomen discussing a recipe and distract them by offering tips on their way to the getaway car. Another policewoman refuses to chase after the suspects because it would ruin her new Givenchy shoes. The frustrated teller finally calls the police but the woman running dispatch calls all cars to inform them of a sale at a department store before mentioning the robbery offhand at the end.\n\nNora Clavicle’s ‘molls’ lead Batman, Robin, and Batgirl to a knitting needle factory where Nora subdues them by threatening Batgirl with a razor-sharp knitting needle. She ties them into a ‘Siamese human knot’ and, like any good villain, she gives away her evil plan. She’s taken out an insurance policy on Gotham City for $10 million dollars and plans on blowing up the city with clockwork mice bombs because the police women can’t deal with mice. This is shown by police chief Millie Linseed and one of her officers standing on top of their desks while the mice zip around below before they faint. \n\nBatman, Robin, and Batgirl escape, of course, and since the police force can’t handle mice, they take care of them pied piper style, leading the bombs to the docks with flutes so they fall into the harbor. Off-screen, Alfred, former Commissioner Gordon, and Chief O’Hara capture Nora and her molls fleeing town. The episode ends with Commissioner Gordon back in his old job just in time for a call from the Penguin setting up the next episode. \n\nWhat I find most odd about the blatant misogyny in this episode is that it happened in the third season after they introduced Batgirl to ‘attract new audience members, especially idealistic young girls, and less high-minded older men.’ The Siamese human knot scenes are tailor-made for the latter but the moral of this episode was women can’t do men’s jobs. That’s no way to win over idealistic young girls.",

I would cite Ōgun Hakusha (Gold Spur) as a representative title. My writing was bound to that as if it were under a spell.\n\n&gt;\"These days, the spell has finally worn off. Nowadays I would prefer to express catharsis through other means. If it was an absolutely necessary scene for the story, I would write it, but I would prefer to do that in a book that isn't a light novel.\"\n\nIt’s rare to see a author explain the reason for rape scenes and then apologize too the actresses for having to act them out.\n\n\nReki Kawahara has promised not to have any more scenes of sexual assault and has vowed to improve writing women even having a entire mini-arc from the POV of the main female protagonist Asuna as she forms a platonic relationship with another women and whose arc is about their carthesis.",

        "text": "This a throwback, a throwback to before most of the of Reddit was even born. Before the author of this post was born for what it’s worth. \n\nSo how do I know about it?  Well, VH1’s I Love The 80’s. I used to watch every chance I could get as a kid when it came on and this on segment remained burned into my mind.\n\nThe Luke and Laura storyline of General Hospital. The romance that captivated American audiences and culminated in the legendary wedding even I know about via offhanded comments from my mom, who watched it when it aired, though she was far from a soap opera fan. \n\nBut what she never mentioned and what one of the people being interviewed for the show pointed out was, the whole relationship started based on a rape. Yes you read that right, Luke catches a young Laura in her wedding dress I believe and is so dang smitten with her he just can’t help himself and rapes her. \n\nHe feels real embarrassed and guilty over it, not enough to turn himself into the police of course but still pretty guilty, and Laura being the angel that she is covers for him. IIRC, this was in 1981 and after earning her friendship and apologizing again Laura learns he’s not such a bad guy after all. This leads to love and in 1983 the aforementioned Wedding happens. \n\nThat was the big roadblock people were rooting for her to get past in their relationship and the wedding was twice as sweet because of where they came from. \n\nTLDR: soap opera in the 80’s promoted dangerous misconceptions about rapists and their victims but America loved it",
