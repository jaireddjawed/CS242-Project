        "text": "I know there are lots of annoying posts like this, but I am very very grateful for any help.\n\nI‚Äôm an MS3, and since the beginning of med school (and before) I‚Äôve wanted to do orthopedic surgery. Unfortunately, all of my experiences in ortho have been discouraging- the residents seem absolutely miserable, the residency hours seem untenable (for me at least), and the ortho environment has felt exclusionary and unwelcoming. Each time, it has felt like no on gave a damn that I was there. Which, I get it, these people are busy. But still, I‚Äôd go full 15 hour days not being spoken to even in down times.  I found myself absolutely dreading going to my ortho rotation, found myself in the OR about to SCREAM if we had to take one more x-ray of the same 3 pins for the 40th time, and dying to go home every single day. \n\nAs a side note about ortho, I have existing back/shoulder problems and I‚Äôm not getting any younger. Even in my short rotation, my back issues got much worse. I worry that a whole residency and career might actually make me physically unable to do the job. Any thoughts?\n\nOn the other hand, I‚Äôve rotated in ophthalmology and had great experiences. The people, the faculty, the patients, the residents, etc‚Ä¶ everyone just seems so happy?? The saying ‚Äútry finding an unhappy ophthalmologist‚Äù really rings true. Everyone is so nice and has shown genuine interest in me and seem hopeful that I‚Äôll choose the specialty.  It was easy to feel eager about my ophtho rotation and wake up early. \n\nThe pathology and surgeries of both specialties are equally interesting to me. Obviously they‚Äôre quite different, but patient satisfaction and outcomes are high in both fields, and it feels good to use my hands to benefit patients. \n\nI‚Äôm having trouble letting go of the ortho life I‚Äôve always envisioned for myself. It‚Äôs hard to let go of the prestige and alpha status of ortho. But I‚Äôm also realizing that I have other priorities outside of Medicine. I‚Äôm realizing that even though residency will be tough no matter what, I don‚Äôt want to spend every free moment of residency face down in my bed trying to catch up on sleep. I want hobbies, I want friends, I want to workout, and I want to take care of myself. I guess I‚Äôm looking for feedback on if I‚Äôm being short sighted? Or any comparison you can offer between the two would be helpful.  I don‚Äôt want to let a bad program or a few bad experiences shape my entire view of ortho, but it honestly feels like a place I don‚Äôt belong? Am I letting little things get to me? Am I getting tempted by what seems to be an easier road? I‚Äôm so fearful I‚Äôm going to regret either decision. \n\nAnyways, any comparisons you can provide, stories of picking between the two, or anecdotal tales would be much appreciated :)",

I have been reminded of the outside world and here in the hospital can confirm-these people are NUTS!\n\nNo, I will not pick up *extra* shifts for *fun learning opportunities*! Do you hear yourself? I'm not even going into this specialty. This isn't fun for me! So I can write your notes?\n\nNo, I do not want to eat lunch in the workroom with y'all. You have kept me every day to 4 PM against my will. These 20 minutes with my sad sandwich and reddit are all I have. Also I have listened to you passive aggressively fight with the other senior over fluids instead of using your big girl words 3x this week. Each of you have come to me to complain and gossip about how crazy the other one is as if I care. I need a break.\n\nNo I do not want to play a game of \"What's your favorite disease from the specialty you're going into?\" Huh??? You want to talk about *medicine* at *lunch* in front of my salad?\n\nI have declined coffee every day I have come in here because coffee makes me feel anxious. One day I come in with a chai latte from Starbucks and instead of being a normal person for 3 weeks you assumed I had been lying about not drinking coffee and set there stewing about how I'm a liar. Get help.\n\nThe third year has been standing up for 3 hrs and decided to sit down in a free chair. You are now whisper yelling at me about how disrespectful it is and how she is the worst medical student you have ever met and how she's a lazy fuck. BRUH. Get help.\n\nI know how to present patients. You, for some reason, have invented your own new convoluted way of how you'd like med students to present patients. I was trying to save us some time but sure I'll do it your w-oh you've interrupted me cause it's taking too long? Oh and now you're mad at me cause I didn't tell you about a detail because you told me to stop talking? Hahaha ok. \n\nI have not opened a textbook since last April. I only know medicine that pertains to my specialty and *even then*. Yes, I am getting all of your pimp questions wrong. Womp Womp. Put it in my eval I'll never read. Bye\n\n\"Why don't the med students want to stay at this institution for residency?\" Um. \n\nIt's 5 o'clock. WTF AM I STILL HERE!!!! I have attempted to disappear twice, but you've come looking for me every time. I hate you. I hate this school. I'm ranking this place 15th. Goodbye forever.",

I do like psych, however after I started studying it, I realized I liked the idea of it more than the actual thing. \n\nNow the thing is, I only pursued it because I didn‚Äôt want to go along with what my parents wanted for me. They always had this vision of me becoming a doctor and going to med school, but all throughout high school I hated the way that‚Äôs all they would focus on, and never ask me what I wanted to do. \n\nI was pretty decent at science subjects, but in my last year of high school my parents decided to pull me out of public school and put me in a private school against my will. At that point I stopped effort into school and lost all motivation to do anything, which further fucked up my grades and uni applications. Obviously i didn‚Äôt get into any health science related programs, but i did get into psychology. \n\nAfter half a year of studying (and struggling) I realized maybe I wasn‚Äôt meant  to study this after all. I feel like i‚Äôve had to learn everything from scratch, and none of this stuff was what i learned in high school. I know situation i‚Äôm in is my fault, so my question to everyone pursuing medicine is: Is it worth pursuing medicine?  I don‚Äôt want to fall victim to the sunk cost fallacy and keep going down this path just because Ive put time and money into it. I feel like with enough effort i‚Äôd be successful. \n\nTL;DR im regretting the program i chose in university bc of some poor choices I made in highschool",

(keep in mind, it does cost us money to keep this tool running)\n\nBelow is an example prompt given to the A.I\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n    Question:\n    Does ephrin type-B receptor 4 activation reduce neointimal hyperplasia in human saphenous vein in vitro? Context: Vein bypass is an essential therapy for patients with advanced peripheral and coronary artery disease despite development of neointimal hyperplasia. We have shown that stimulation of the receptor tyrosine kinase ephrin type-B receptor 4 (Eph-B4) with its ligand ephrin-B2 prevents neointimal hyperplasia in murine vein grafts. This study determines whether Eph-B4 in adult human veins is capable of phosphorylation and activation of downstream signaling pathways, as well as functional to release nitric oxide (NO) and prevent neointimal hyperplasia in vitro.\", \"Discarded human saphenous veins were taken from the operating room and placed in organ culture without or with ephrin-B2/Fc (2 Œºg/mL) for 14 days, and the neointima/media ratio was measured in matched veins. Primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells were treated with ephrin-B2/Fc (2 Œºg/mL) and examined with quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, immunoassays, and for release of NO. Ephrin-B2/Fc (2 Œºg/mL) was placed on the adventitia of saphenous veins treated with arterial shear stress for 24 hours in a bioreactor and activated Eph-B4 examined with immunofluorescence.\", \"The baseline intima/media ratio in saphenous vein rings was 0.456 ¬± 0.097, which increased to 0.726 ¬± 0.142 in untreated veins after 14 days in organ culture but only to 0.630 ¬± 0.132 in veins treated with ephrin-B2/Fc (n = 19, P = .017). Ephrin-B2/Fc stimulated Akt, endothelial NO synthase and caveolin-1 phosphorylation, and NO release (P = .007) from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (n = 6). Ephrin-B2/Fc delivered to the adventitia stimulated endothelial Eph-B4 phosphorylation after 24 hours of arterial stress in a bioreactor (n = 3).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n    Answer:\n    Eph-B4 is present and functional in adult human saphenous veins, with intact downstream signaling pathways capable of NO release and prevention of neointimal hyperplasia in vitro. Adventitial delivery of ephrin-B2/Fc activates endothelial Eph-B4 in saphenous veins treated with arterial shear stress in vitro. These results suggest that stimulation of Eph-B4 function may be a candidate strategy for translation to human clinical trials designed to inhibit venous neointimal hyperplasia.",
