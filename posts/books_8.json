The mere thought of choosing just one seems daunting.

One of the major themes was subliminal messages being presented to the characters, the most obvious of which was a soft drink company that had inserted the ‚Äúdrink me‚Äù into their labeling or advertising. \n\nI‚Äôm hoping someone has read it or knows of it so I could find it again. I got it out of the local German library in the small town I lived in. The English language section was very small, maybe one full bookcase sized part of the library. Most of the books in the section were either bestsellers like the kind you would find in an airport or books from England or the isles if that narrows it at all\n\nKind of a long shot that anyone know but if you do I would be grateful",

Are they all like this?\n\n1. Girl is deeply traumatized or has some kind of painful past (Heart bones, November 9)\n2. Meets boy that ALSO has some kind of troubled past (someone died), and makes sure to rope the girl into it and makes her suffer (Ugly love, Heart bones, NOVEMBER 9)\n3. It is revealed that boy has been lying to her or keeping a major piece of traumatic information from her, that hurts her even more?\n4. Boy reveals his trauma, some plot line about how everything he has done is actually just and okay (He was fixing their houses while living in them! He lost his child and could never love again! He was just angry that his mom was dead!), girl forgets everything bad he has ever done and they make up and everything is fine.\n\nHeart bones: Poor Beyah had an awful childhood and an abusive mother and absent father, she meets Samson and they fall in love just for him to go to jail for years after lying to her and everyone about his life, because of his dead dad. Poor Beyah.\n\nUgly Love: Tate is trying to grow and succeed in her career and meets Miles who moans his ex girlfriends name every chance he gets (even during sex??üò≠üò≠bffr), he completely rejects her and says he will never love her, terribly damaging for Tate, and then reveals his dead baby trauma, and Tate forgives him and its fine. Poor Tate.\n\nNovember 9: I just finished this one not 10 minutes ago and i'm mad. Fallon has had her life and familial relationships ruined because of this fire. Meets Ben, ben and her fall in love. Just for her to find out that he set the fire after his mom committed suicide, because he THOUGHT that her dad had something to do with it. He tells her about his dead mom and apologizes and Fallon forgives him. Poor Fallon.\n\nI just feel like everyone has traumatic things happen. These men need therapy and these girls need to make better decisions about who they allow in their lives, and once they reveal these traumatic incidents, it does not erase the things they have done to these girls. Trauma can be an explanation for actions but never an excuse. I like Hoovers style of writing, I just think that it sends a bit of a shifty message to young girls and women about the type of men they should be allowing into their lives, romanticizing damaged men and the \"they can be fixed and forgiven\" trope.\n\nThis is not hate, it is criticism. Authors will be criticized and I dont want anyone to take this personally. I would like to hear your thoughts.",

        "text": "A few thoughts since I just read this. \n\nSpoiler warnings possible ahead.\n\nAnyway, I got this book seeing it in a used book store and having seen mention of it before. Had heard about Sinclair Lewis in the past and for some reason confused him with Upton Sinclair. I saw Babbit and my curiosity was piqued and bought it for $2. \n\nAnyway, I want to mention, without getting too much into the weeds, I thought it was a great novel in the literary realism genre about the life of businessmen and American middle class life in the 1920s. Suburbs as described in the book written in the early 20s feel eerily similar to how they are today. The book‚Äôs description of the American businessman is not that of the ultra rich billionaire class we know of today, but the small-mid business men that rely on their social circles to keep their place in the hierarchy and to keep the ‚Äúmachine‚Äù overall running. I thought it was a very interesting look into the early 1920s post prohibition (just a reminder prohibition began in 1919) parties held by middle class families in their own homes in their cookie cutter suburban homes in their perfect town. It has a lot of mirrors to today‚Äôs life as well. I honestly had no idea people in that age (well, at least the middle class) had access to a lot of the luxuries we enjoy today (mass adoption of cars, electricity, electrical nick nacks that were groundbreaking in those days). Additionally, the description of the class warfare between pro-labor class (blue collar workers and unions) against business owners and freemarket conservative business men bosses and tycoons feels just as relevant today as it isnin the book.\n\nPlot: the book revolves around businessman real estate broker George Babbit. He is the archetypical businessman that lives for building him middle class dream home and family. He is successful by the metrics of his home, his family, his car, and his social connections. His deeply buried intentions however reveal that he is a man trapped by this American way of life. He is trapped in his society. He is trapped by his church. He is trapped by his social clubs. He is trapped by his marriage. He is trapped by his kids. As the story progresses he gets away from each of those aspects as dealt in separate chapters but realizes that in his attempts to distance himself from these social chains, he puts himself in great peril. After distancing himself (in various self destructive ways), he finds that he cannot break from who he is or he will surely perish. He wants so badly to be someone else but is cursed in that he can be nobody BUT Babbit. He learns this cruel lesson at the end of the book when he re-enters all of the forms of social life he tried to escape. He has one final saving grace at the end which I will not spoil. \n\nI think this book was more likely groundbreaking and ahead of its time during its release, but I can definitely see the themes of its thesis everywhere so much in our culture today that it is not even surprising in the least. The book is not surprising or mind blowing, but only because it is a very apt description of what we already see every day in the USA.\n\nI think this book is a good look at 1920s life. Not nearly as alien as I imagined. A great period piece compared with the Great Gatsby. I think Sinclair Lewis is actually a good writer and for a book with this topic, I was pretty engaged. I just purchased his book It Can‚Äôt Happen Here and can‚Äôt wait to read it.",

        "text": "tl;dr to follow...\n\nI'm talking about the books similar to \"*Sapiens*\", \"*Rubicon*\", and \"*Guns,Germs and Steel*\".\n\nBiases can be very interesting to read. It gets you to know the author's opinion. But that is only when you KNOW that the author is being biased. Take the example of Rubicon by Tom Holland (I mean when Spider-Man writes a book, you gotta read it). Rubicon is about the last years of the Roman Republic, and my man Tom actually despises Cicero (a famous orator in those days). The adjectives he uses when he is describing Cicero are hilarious: insecure, wanna-be-famous, power-hungry, egomaniac, self-indulging, whimpering, provincial (ouch); even though there far more insecure and status-seeking characters in his book.\n\nThis bias is so obvious I can't help but enjoy it, but there are some biases I'm not aware of, and now that I've read his books, I'm probably thinking those biases. His opinion on historical figures (e.g. Julius Caesar and Augustus), his reasoning on why things happen, the way he justifies or condemns the behavior of these politicians, etc. One of his less subtle biases is that he is trying to cherry-pick events to make the Roman people and their values look like that of the US citizens (are you insinuating something, Spider-Man?). \n\n**When the author is biased, the uninformed reader turns biased too.**\n\nI mean how are you going to write a single book about a 100 years of history that will change the fate of Europe forever? The fact that you have to skip discussing many political, socio-economical, and traditions of that time to fit stuff in the book introduces bias. And the uninformed reader gets this undeserved notion that they are now an \"expert\" on Roman Republic history.\n\nI've learned my lesson. As much as I enjoy the prose and style of these writers, I will not read any such books unless I'm well informed on their subjects. I need my facts and history straight. I can brush off biases in a novel, but not in these books. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you guys think about these genre of books? Are there any non-biased ones out there?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Tl;dr - Pop historical books are biased. Don't read them unless you are familiar with the subject.**",

I've never been good at it, but with audio, I fall into it. I've been listening to audio books since you had to rent 20 CDs from a library.\n\nBut if I tell a friend that I read a certain book recently, they always correct me and say \"listened.\"\n\nI get that they are probably just fucking with me but I've had more serious arguments with people over it as well. Why do people care so much? There are a lot of benefits to it. I drive a lot and have a job where I can have an earbud in most of the time, I can read entire shorter books (6-8 hours) in one day while doing other stuff. It makes mundaine tasks enjoyable. My life is tough and lonely and would be a lot worse without audiobooks.\n\nMost people don't read anything at all, why give me shit over not reading a paper book? I don't enjoy it. If you like it then fine, but I still \"read\" the book, just like you \"read\" a chart or a room or a situation.

I really enjoy the style, themes, and overall content of the book but if I jump back into it I could miss stuff, and at my pace, the book will probably last me until June/July, but I don't have the time to restart a \\~600 page book. \n\n2) How does *The Invisible Man* fit into the canon of African American literature?

I'm just having a hard time finding good lines from the book that clearly support it, and I'm not quite sure how to stretch this out into two paragraphs.

The other person... well they kinda just screamed at me, told me I was so wrong and told me to go \"educate myself\", as it was even described as a \"Gothic romance\". Aka a 100% productive debate.\n\nThing hit me in the head now yesterday: Needing to do an essay on Warpole's \"Castle of Otranto\", in which many books described it as a \"Gothic romance novel\". Except it was the same game: little love story on the side, but not the point. Like, the creator himself wanted to just tell a ghost story, basically.\n\nI already knew that an era of \"Romanticisms\" existed, but that one started at ca. 1800.

Even women that weren't sexualized were potrayed in a very bad light (little girls on the way to the artist's or Frau Grubah). Now thinking about it , maybe all characters were bad to an extent? But for some reason it feels especially jarring with women. I'd say the uncle and some of his co-workers and the fabricant weren't that negative of characters.",

        "text": "I don't quite get the attitude that one should **always** read the original if they **can(what does it even mean that you** ***can*****?)**. I want to explicitly talk about books where the content is the important part. When it comes to poetry or books which are also read because of it's linguistic style, this is a more problematic situation...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLets take English as a language. If you are proficient or a native speaker then of course one reads the original if it is written in english, thats obvious. I want to talk about the bigger group of people who are non-native speakers and are not even close of speaking on a native speaker level. Even if your english skills aren't extremely good, you surely will understand most of the easy to medium level english literature. I am not at all proficient in english but the books i have read so far were not a big problem, some words I had to look up here and there but I was mostly fine.\n\nLets say that I am someone who just cares for the content of the book. There are some books where I just care for the content and don't have any secondary goals like improving my english skills by reading it in english. The question is: **I could read it in english but should I, is this the best option?**\n\nNow often there is one argument which is always mentioned:\n\n1. Translations always add something be it positive or negative. You read an interpretation of that book by someone else...\n\nThe thing I am asking myself is: **How can you be sure that you don't miss out more by reading the original than the translation?** \n\nI myself am a german native speaker and I have read translations from english books which were done by renowned translators and I as a non-proficient english speaker would argue: **Reading the translation(made by someone who is more than proficient in english...) can let me be closer to what the author's intend is than reading the original. Your limited english skills can change the meaning of a sentence in the same way as reading the translation.**\n\nDon't understand me wrong, I can fully understand that you normally should read the original but for the non-proficient speakers out there, I just think that it isn't that simple as to say \"**Always read the original if you can understand it\"** or something along that lines. That's my limited view on this...",

This really has opened my eyes to what I can learn from the language by reading it in context. However I figured to move forward with this, I would need to find a book that I know the story behind that I can follow along with in Norwegian. The book that‚Äôll help me the best would be Norwegian translation of The Lord of the Rings, Called ‚ÄúRingenes Herre‚Äù. The problem is finding the physical copy of the book. All I find online are either the audiobook or Nordic Third party sellers that can not accept my shipping address. Any help in finding it would be much appreciated! Thank Y‚Äôall and have a great rest of your day!",

I had certainly heard about it over the years, but for me, this book should have had bold, red \"READ ME\" letters flashing over it.  First book in a long time that \"transported\" me, as only good books can.\n\nSuperb world building, some of the best I have read in ages. Each of the pilgrim's sub-plots feels like it could have been a book, universe, and story on its own, and the depth and scale of each backstory is beyond impressive. I literally laughed out loud at some of the poet's dialogue, felt deeply for Sol and Rachel, was a little spooked with Father Hoyt's story, intrigued by the mystery with Brawne, etc. And somehow they all tied together. \n\nI should also confess to consuming the audiobook that was superbly done. \n\nOne thing that puzzled me was how abruptly the book ended. I was very interested in the outcome of the pilgrimage and curious about what happens in this world.  I know there are a number of sequels. Does the next book pick up where this one leaves off? Does the story of the pilgrimage get resolved? Do we find out more about Het?  I think I will check out the sequel regardless, but I hope the answer is yes.\n\nAlso surprised this has not been adapted to the screen yet. This IP is truly top notch.",
