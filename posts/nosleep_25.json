        "text": "Link to: [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10s4aln/im_a_doordash_driver_in_a_rich_neighborhood_my/) \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI stomped out what remained of the cigarette and got back in the car. I could feel the nicotine working, both heightening and calming my senses simultaneously. I was wired in and ready. I clicked off the hazards and steered onto the road, then took a right turn onto a gravel path which led up to Kelsie P’s residence.\n\nThe trees seemed to close-in around the path like French claw-clips around a couple fingers. Even with my brights on, the winding road never allowed for more than ten yards of visibility. I rolled the window down and listened to the crackling melody of small stones crunching under Bess’s Continentals, and the persistent falling of rain against the hood. I checked the map, then lifted my eyes and saw the gravel path fork off to the right, fleeing from the large clearing that was Kelsie P’s driveway.\n\nAnd what a driveway it was. \n\nOne moment I was in Northern Illinois, driving on a gravel path through a quasi-forest. And the next I was in a Westminster Abbey courtyard. The rough road smoothed out into a cobblestone square, enclosed by a brick half-wall which picketed around the property, separating it from the natural surroundings. The only entrance was a gate, already opened, which was straddled between two marble obelisks. \n\nI entered.\n\nThe building, which could most aptly be referred to as a chateau, was set at the end of a topiary garden. Two rows of geometrically shaped hedges bordered a wide walkway leading up to a set of cement stairs and a porch. I pulled through the cobblestone square and entered what from the sky would have looked like the handle of a giant briefcase, then parked at the precipice of the walkway. \n\nThe rain was coming down pretty hard now, so it was difficult to see outside, but through the intermittent swipes of my wiper blades I could make out a space of flat land surrounding the house, separating it from the brick fence. Splotches of grass were beginning to bud up from the moist earth, and the hedges, with their implanted roots, seemed merely to be a more advanced and curated form of the grass itself. I glanced once more over at the porch which was lit with two welcoming lanterns, then turned my attention back inside the car.\n\nI spent a minute fiddling with my jacket, making sure it was properly fitted. Then I checked my phone for messages before sliding it into my pocket and grabbing the Lazy Dog bag. I held it in my lap while looking into the rearview mirror. I could see my face: barely lit by the car’s embedded light sources. My brown hair was cut short, military style, and even in the dark I could see the gray streaking through like a spray of off-white paint. My eyes were hard and tired, but stretched wide with adrenaline provided by the cigarette. Or at least that’s what I told myself was causing it. I sniffed, then coughed. Probably there was still some flour in my nostrils. I grimaced, then I looked back out the passenger window. And the last thought I had before exiting the car was that none of the windows were lit. *The house was completely dark—except for the porch lights.*\n\nI jogged through the rain with the bag clutched against my chest. It only took fifteen seconds to clear the walkway and make it up the stairs, but in that time the rain had soaked my hair. I started to pat it out when a burst of thunder came on the heels of a lightning bolt, and for a moment the entire world was bright as in daylight hours. I saw the hedges and thought they looked menacing in that brief spark: as if they were creatures stalking under cover of darkness, suddenly exposed. Then I looked to the right and saw the porch continue around the house like one might see in the country. I wiped my face, then turned to ring the doorbell. But the door creaked open before I could click the button.\n\nThe lady was around 5’4”, maybe thirty years old, and had thin brown hair combed neatly behind her shoulders. From what I could make out in the dim exterior light, her skin looked pallor, and her face was sunken and tired. She gripped the door with the weak fingers of her right hand, holding it only slightly ajar.\n\n“Good Evening,” I said with a nod. “I have an order for Kelsie P.” I twisted the bag in my hand to expose the tag with Kelsie’s name on it.\n\nShe stared blankly at it for several seconds, and I got the impression that this woman had other things on her mind. When she finally registered my question, a look of surprise swept over her features, and she effused an “Oh, hello,” as if she had just seen me. “I’m—” she stumbled, “Kelsie P, that’s me.” She smiled weakly and looked behind me. “Sorry about the rain. It must be a hard night to be out.”\n\nI nodded again and said, “Well, generous tips like yours make it all worth it. Plus, it’s not like you control the weather.”\n\nHer smile stretched, seeming more genuine. “I’m glad,” she replied. “And, you’re right. But, you know…” she trailed off, and for a few seconds there was only the sound of rain pattering against the wooden overhang. Then Kelsie said, “well, thank you,” and reached for the bag.\n\nI held it back, a reaction which prompted her to jerk her hand back inside the dark crevice of her doorway. I retrieved my phone from my pocket and held it up so she could see the Dasher app. “Sorry, ma’am. Protocol for alcohol deliveries. I have to scan your ID.”\n\n“Oh,” she responded nervously. She looked over her shoulder, as if someone was trying to speak to her from inside. Then she turned back to me and said, “I left my purse in the dining room. Do you mind if I go and get it? Shouldn’t be a minute.”\n\n“Please,” I replied. “Take your time.”\n\nI listened to her footsteps trail off down the hallway; when I was sure she was gone, I pressed the door open another few inches and peered inside. As expected, all of the lights were turned off. Only a few candles were lit in the living room. I made note of the spiraling staircase directly up ahead, and the hallway beside it which presumably led to the kitchen and dining room. I listened for another minute, and just as I was beginning to worry, I heard Kelsie’s footfalls returning from the back of the house. I backed up a couple feet and waited.\n\nWhen Kelsie returned, I could tell immediately she was different. Her breathing was deep and disturbed. Her voice sounded unsure as she said, “Sorry . . . about the wait. My purse, I couldn’t—”\n\n“It’s no problem,” I interjected. “It looks like your power went out.”\n\nHer hand, which was rummaging through her purse with frantic speed, froze, and I could see her fingers trembling. She looked back into her house, as if just realizing where she was. Then she turned back and said, “Oh, yes. It went out with the storm.” She confirmed then continued to rummage.\n\n“Are you sure?” I replied and reached forward, placing my hand atop her purse to stop her motion. Then, while keeping the Lazy Dog bag hooked around my wrist, I raised my index finger and placed it over my lips. I met her wide, terrified eyes, and at this distance, I could see they were hazel. When I was sure she was not going to scream, I lowered my finger, and while keeping my other hand over her purse, I whispered very quietly: “I know everything. I’m here to help. Will you let me do that?”\n\nShe was staring into my eyes, but I could tell something in the house was agitating her. Her head kept rotating over her shoulder, as if pulled by a magnet, and it took a concerted effort for her to stop from turning around.\n\n“It’s okay,” I said, filling the silence. “You don’t have to speak. I’ve done this before. There’s one inside, isn’t there? Nod once if there is.”\n\nShe gulped, but something in her face told me she was beginning to believe me—trust me, maybe. She nodded once.\n\n“Okay, I’m going to tell you what to do. Don’t worry about the theatrics of it, these things aren’t very socially acute. It’ll all be over very quickly if you do what I say. Do you understand? Nod once if you do.”\n\nShe nodded.\n\n“Good. Now, when I release your purse, I want you to count to three in your head, then toss the purse behind you, maybe a good four or five feet. Understand?”\n\nShe thought it over, then nodded, and I noticed her fingers had stopped trembling.\n\n“You’re going to pretend like you dropped it, which means you’ll turn around and start cleaning it up. It’s very important that you face the interior of the house in such a way that you can see everything inside. Okay?”\n\nAnother nod.\n\n“I’m going to come in and crouch down in front of you, pretending to help. Now this next part is very important. When you see it, I want you to show me where it is with your eyes. This means that you’ll look at it, then look at me, then look back again. Once *I* know where it is, I can take care of it. Do you understand?”\n\nKelsie nodded, and I could see an intense weight had been lifted off her shoulders.\n\n“Okay, then,” I started, speaking deliberately. “On your mark.” I removed my hand from her purse and nodded.\n\nThere were three seconds of quiet anticipation. Thunder croaked in the Heavens. Rain tapped its millions of nimble fingers against the gutter. Another flash of lightning harpooned across the night sky. And then Kelsie swung her arm behind her and released the purse. I heard a dull thud, then the sound of objects sliding across the tile floor. She looked once more into my eyes, and in hers I saw the words, “Please don’t let me down.” Then she turned around and did as I had instructed.\n\nWhen I stepped inside the foyer, I felt the hairs on my arms and neck raise. It felt like I was walking against a strong winter wind, only the frigid air was saturated with the scent of black licorice. I pushed forward and moved to face Kelsie. “Here, let me help,” I uttered, then crouched down and began to pick up the loose items. I drew a deep breath, steadying my focus. I returned a tube of lipstick to the purse, then looked up into Kelsie’s eyes. They were searching, and I saw that she was drawing shallow breaths through an open mouth. Probably that mouth was dry as the desert air.\n\nThis went on for maybe fifteen seconds, at which point Kelsie’s expression warped into one of abject terror. I had to whisper her name to get her attention. She gazed at me, remembering, then looked back over my right shoulder, then back at me. Based on the trajectory of her gaze—up and to the left—I concluded that the creature was probably held up in the upper-right corner of the living room. I gripped the Lazy Dog bag firmly in my left hand, and when I was ready, I offered Kelsie one final nod. Then I threw the bag over my right shoulder, and—spinning in the same direction—I pulled the gun from my left holster with my right hand and aimed it straight at the bag.\n\nI only saw it for a second; its features were nothing more than dark silhouettes in the flickering candlelight. Then the mass lept at me, torpedoing through the sky with inhuman velocity. I pulled the trigger right before the bag and creature crossed paths. There was a brilliant flash of red light as the incendiary bullet ignited the solution and exploded into a billion embers which engulfed the creature completely. It dropped to the ground with a crashing force suggestive of metal, splintering and breaking the floorboards beneath the creature’s tremendous weight.\n\nI didn’t waste any time closing the distance between myself and the thing that had fallen out of the air. In the light of a dozen living room fires, I could see it clearly now, and I kept my gun trained on its abdomen while checking the damage. \n\nScarlet cracks manifested all over the creature’s clear, chitin exoskeleton but were focused around the navel cavity where the makeshift bomb had exploded. Unlike a human’s stomach, the creature’s was concave and round like a Spiral Wishing Well. Tight cords of muscle twisted around its core, allowing it unbelievable abdominal strength and rotary ability. Above, its chest was broad and smooth, with only a single pectoral muscle connecting the two arm-like appendages, perhaps four-times the size of an average bodybuilder’s arms, stretching down to its ankles. Its ovular head was connected to its body by a long, snake-like neck which could stretch five, maybe six feet, then contract like an accordion. Attached to its onyx head were five spider-like eyes, and below, a star-patterned incision where its mouth flap would open up to reveal two rows of tiny serrated teeth, overshadowed by two vampire-like incisors. \n\n“Game over you fucking parasite,” I spat while holstering my gun. When it was put away, I spent a moment observing its exoskeleton armor. While the blast had shattered the entire front portion, I could see the resilient material already beginning to reform. “You’re a persistent bastard, I’ll give you that,” I said and reached behind my head to retrieve the sword which was hidden there beneath the trench coat.\n\nThat’s when I heard the front door shut behind me.\n\nNow, as I alluded to previously, this wasn’t my first rodeo. After three dozen successful hunts, Julie and I have been able to create a set of parameters—rules, if you will—for both the creatures and my own methods of engagement. Chief among our discoveries is that there is only ever one “vampod” per household. This rule was *never* broken: so when I heard the creak of the door, then the latch, and then the sound of transformation—a sound which can be mimicked by rubbing two pieces of wet rubber together—I was utterly shocked.\n\nMy hand, which had found the sword’s handle, remained in a perpetual reaching-behind-my-head pose as I listened further. Beneath the sound of the attenuating rain, I heard what sounded almost like fast-falling hail. And then I realized what it was. It was the vampod’s death call: a subtle chattering of teeth, indicating its frenzied hunger. I felt a child-like wave of dread pass over me, but I forced myself to turn my head. Sure enough, where Kelsie had previously been standing, there was another vampod. Its beady, black eyes were glaring at me; its mouth was quivering with anticipation. \n\n*Shit.*\n\nWhile keeping my right hand on the hilt, I slowly moved my left hand along my waist, reaching for my gun. Just as my fingers touched the rubber grip, the vampod lurched at me. I ducked and rolled further inside the living room, barely escaping the monster’s wide swipe. Then I sprang up, pointed my pistol, and shot an entire clip of incendiary bullets into center mass. The vampod flinched with each bullet, but when the barrage ceased, it once again started stalking toward me.\n\n“Shit,” I said and took off sprinting toward the kitchen. I reloaded the gun and holstered it, then reached inside under my left armpit and pulled a grenade from my belt. Taking one of these things on was hard enough—two would be impossible. I circled back through the hallway with the second vampod close on my tail and chucked the grenade at the wounded one. Then I cut past the spiral staircase and into a small family room on the other side of the house. \n\nThe explosion shook the walls. I knew the grenade alone wouldn’t be enough to kill it, but it should buy me another three minutes while I figured out how to either escape or kill the second one. I ran through the dining room, sliding over the large wooden table, and escaped into the kitchen just as the pursuing vampod slashed the entry-way to pieces. I saw an open door with a flight of stairs leading down to the basement. I considered going through—perhaps there was an egress window I could use to escape. But I knew if there wasn’t one, I’d be toast. \n\nThen I had an idea.\n\nI ducked behind the island, which took the brunt of the vampod’s next swing, then I stood up dual-wielding my pistols. I shot both clips—28 rounds—while backing up toward the stove. I lagged my left gun long enough to allow my right hand to spin the dials on each of the eight gas burners. Then I pulled the master cable connecting all of the grenade pins and released the belt, allowing it to fall on the ground in front of the stove.\n\nI sprinted toward the family room, knowing I only had six seconds to get as far away from the blast zone as possible. However, with the big gash in the door-way, the vampod was able to recover and leap at me—its force carrying through the wall and into my side. I coughed, feeling one of my ribs break, and fell onto the ground beside the dining room table.\n\nThe monster, which had overshot its mark and punctured the wall next to me, pulled itself out and towered over me in the doorway. Time seemed to slow down then. My attention was fixated on the creature’s large incisors which jutted out from its mouth. Its neck elongated, stretching toward me in expectant pleasure, and it released a moan which was a cross between whales singing and a low, distant fog horn. The sound filled the room, along with the scent of black licorice, and just as the creature was going to take me, the pack of grenades exploded, and the entire kitchen went up in flames.\n\nI covered my face, bracing for the heatwave. When it came, it felt like a giant was sweeping me with a molten broom. My fingers sizzled, and later I was sure that if the vampod had not been standing directly in front of me, I would have died right then. The room's temperature gauge jacked up like an uncontrolled steam room, and all around I heard crackling and popping sounds. \n\nI opened my eyes.\n\nThe vampod was lying face-first on the floor several feet away from me. The explosion had not only shattered his exoskeleton, but had warped some of the musculature underneath. Black ichor dripped from its skin, and it writhed, releasing a low, painful moan before going limp.\n\nI felt my own body go limp, drained of its adrenaline-fueled hypervigilance. My side swelled up around the broken rib, and attempting to turn rightside up felt like cutting myself in half with a scalpel. I laid for an unknown duration of time, falling in and out of consciousness as the flames closed in around me. \n\nThe feeling of my flesh melting woke me up. I jutted forward and saw my feet on fire. I screamed, and in my panicked movement, I managed to kick one of the table legs. A simultaneous surge of pain in my shin and torso nearly knocked me out again, but I swallowed it and forced myself to my knees, gritting my teeth as my singed fingers flared with pain. I grunted, wiping the sweat and soot from my forehead, and used my elbows to prop myself up. Then I anchored myself against the side of the table and rose to my bloody feet. Tears rolled down my feverish face, and I realized it was quite possible the entire house was a giant bonfire by now. I had to get out.\n\nI limped through the dining room, only looking back once to confirm the vampod was still lying on the ground behind me. All I could see was a puddle of black liquid. *Good enough,* I thought and pressed on. When I came to the front door, I realized three things. First, it had stopped raining outside. Sometime during my unconsciousness, the storm had passed. Second, the other vampod was also liquidated. And third, a baby was crying upstairs.\n\nI’m ashamed to say that I almost left anyway. I undid the latch on the front door and cracked it wide open, feeling relief in the form of a cool, humid breeze. But before I could take a step outside, I heard the baby scream again. I pressed my wrist into my forehead and closed my eyes. *No one would blame you for leaving,* I thought. I took a deep breath of fresh air and released. Then I looked back toward the source of the cries. *But I’d blame me.* I left the door open and started back inside the house.\n\nIt felt like I had a gut full of buck-shot as I ascended the spiral, bracing against the banister in a lovers’ cleave. The fire had spread along the wall and ceiling, but peering into the second floor rooms, I saw they were mostly unafflicted. This fueled my hope that I would have enough time to save the infant, whose cries for help became more and more urgent. I stumbled over the last step and fell forward, nearly lunging into the flaming wall. Luckily I managed to bend—bearing the pain of my rib—and land on my knees. I howled, and for a moment the murky world turned completely black. But it was only a moment, and I picked myself back up, wading through the smoke until I found the nursery.\n\nThe fire hadn’t torn inside the room yet, but the air was filled with smoke. We both had to get out of here, and fast. I stumbled toward the sound of the baby’s cries, cursing aloud with each painful step, my raw feet feeling like I had walked a thousand miles over jagged rocks, barefoot. When I finally reached the crib and set in to grab her, the baby thrashed violently against my advances. “I’m here to help,” I said as the infant kicked at my hands. “Come on, now, don’t be like that.” I grabbed for her, but she squirmed out of my grip. The child truly had incredible strength. “Fine,” I yelled and turned indignantly. *I don’t have time for this!* I screamed inside my head. \n\nThat’s when I heard heavy footfalls coming from downstairs. Someone, *or something*, was walking through the main hallway.\n\n“Shit, there’s more?” I said, incredulous. “Fuck,” I spun around and grabbed the child, overpowering her strong legs and pressed her to my chest. “Shhhhh,” I hushed, “I just need to—” I heard the sound of footsteps sprinting up the spiral stairs. “Damn!” I ran with the baby to the closet and stepped inside, closing the louver door behind us. The spaced slats allowed me to see into the room, but it also allowed smoke inside the closet. We’d probably only have a couple minutes before smoke inhalation would rob what little oxygen we had left. I held the baby closer to my neck and waited.\n\nA moment later, a human figure entered the nursery. They stopped at the doorway, and I heard myself whisper “Go away—please, just go away,” under my breath. The figure took a step inside. Then another step, and another. They stopped in the center, as if considering what to do, then she approached the closet. I was so wired-in, I hardly realized the baby had stopped crying. The entire world seemed completely void of noise. \n\nThen I saw her.\n\nThe skin on her face was creamy and doll-like, as if she had used plaster as compound. Her blond hair was tied back in a ponytail, and her facial expression was completely blank. She took another step toward the closet, and I noticed her movements were . . . clunky. The swing of her arms seemed to lag her step, and when they did move, the movement was too fluid, as if my ex-wife was synchronizing her motion to the steady rhythm of a song. \n\nI didn’t feel shocked when I realized it was Karen. Something in her reddish-brown eyes pulled my concentration, and I suddenly felt like I had been expecting her—that we were meant to rendezvous here. My muscles weakened, and it took all of my effort to keep from dropping the baby. Karen took another step, and I felt my heart beating in my ears. Another step, and I opened my mouth, inhaling deep breaths of smoke. I was becoming lightheaded—disoriented. My skin was crawling, and my reflexes were urging me to run, to escape whatever this disgusting thing pretending to be Karen was. But she had me. I was only a spectator now, and she wanted to show me something—\n\nSuddenly I was back at home-base: an old, two-story energy building Jules and I rented out as a private space to conduct vampod research and store our results. It was dark out, but moonlight poured through the windows. Looking around, I saw the place had been ransacked. Desks and chairs and shards of glass were strewn everywhere, and on the air was the familiar scent of black licorice. “Jules?” I called, walking toward the back offices. I saw several vested men lying on the ground—security guards on our payroll. Their corpses had been ripped apart, and what remained of their bodies were pale and shrunken. I began to shake. “Jules?” I called again, quieter.\n\nI made it to her office. The door was wide open, and I could already see her figure lying on the ground, her blood staining the blue carpet, black. “Jules!” I cried out, dropping on top of her body and feeling for vitals. No pulse. No signs of breathing. “Jules, hold on,” I said and flipped her over, prepared to perform CPR. I fastened my hands together but stopped when I saw her chest—it was caved in. Something had reached through her sternum and literally ripped her heart out. Then I saw her face. Her eyes and mouth were both wide open in a fixed expression of horror.\n\nTears streamed out of my eyes, but I didn’t make a sound. I was completely stunned. I brought Julie’s body to my chest and hugged her for what felt like hours. Then I heard something. A faint clicking sound. It was coming from behind me, in the corner of the room. I didn’t turn. I didn’t move. I just closed my eyes as the sound of chattering teeth stalked closer.\n\nThen I was back in the closet. Karen’s face was pressed against the door. She was smiling with manic ecstasy, as if she was siphoning my terror through the grated door and ingesting it like a drug. She stuck her tongue out in a licking motion; it was long and sharp, like a lizard’s tongue. And just when I thought she was going to enter and kill us, I heard someone else yell from downstairs. The Karen imposter turned with a scowl. “Carl?” I heard the voice yell, and I immediately thought of Julie.\n\nKaren turned back to me, flashing one more creepy smile before backing up to the nursery window. Then she lunged through the glass, shattering it on her way out of the house.\n\nJulie must have heard the glass shatter, because she started up the stairs. “Carl?” she called again. I stumbled through the door, keeping the silent baby close to my chest. “H—here,” I mumbled.\n\n“Oh my God,” Julie remarked as she entered the room. I fell over into her arms. “It—it was—Kare—Kar” I tried to elaborate, but my voice was weak, and my brain might as well have been a second heart, pumping singular thoughts about escape.\n\n“No time to talk now,” Julie said and guided me toward the stairs. “Cops are on the way. We have to get out of here, pronto.”\n\nI mumbled a barely audible agreement, then let Julie guide me through the upstairs hallway and down the stairs. By the time we exited the house, Julie was partially carrying me on her back. She had taken the baby from me and was holding her with one arm, while the other arm was pointed at my Honda Taurus. “Sorry, Carl,” she said while loading the baby and I into the back seat of her black Escalade. “Can’t have this trace back to us.”\n\nI fell onto the leather seats and groaned, suddenly remembering what it felt like to be an eight year old again—to fall off my bike and skid my knee across the blacktop. Only I didn’t just skid my knee, but my entire body, and whenever it made contact with anything, it was as if the skin was being flayed with a hot knife. I tried to hold on, to resist the blackness that was taking over, but Julie’s voice faded into the background like a head into an infinitely deep pillow, sinking and sinking until the pain in my feet and the smoke and smut in my nostrils and the ringing in my ears all suffocated under the weight of a single point of pressure which bore down like an iron thumb on my forehead.\n\nThe last thing I remember before losing consciousness was the bumpiness of the road as we turned onto the gravel path, and the distant sound of an explosion.\n\nThen I was out.",

        "text": "How does one begin to explain the unexplainable? The problem with the human mind is that every mind has small differences. Oh sure we can say that the structure is mostly the same, that neurons still form connections with one another, that synapses still fire in the same ways, but deep inside those small differences between common man can form a gulf insurmountable. There are many theories as to what purpose dreams serve, is it a mechanism for mental repair, is it a way to remove emotion from a memory or experience? Do dreams serve any purpose at all? When we dream is it always a figment of some imagined place, or perhaps is there an element of reality contained within?\n\nThere have been murmurings of the existence of precognitive dreams for centuries. Prophets in ages past foretold their visions of futures that may or may not have come to pass. Psychologists and pseudo-scientists gave their theories and the phenomena became mixed up in pseudo-science and mysticism. For those who experience precognitive dreams, a liar is obvious to spot, but it can be hard to explain why that is so. Why does the liar stick out so to those who actually *see*? I will thusly try to explain the mechanics behind a precognitive experience and my worries and fears, but remember that all brains have differences and my experiences will not speak for all.\n\nFirstly, I must say that Déjà vu is not the same as a precognitive experience, although sometimes the terms can find themselves overlapping. I've experienced Déjà vu and it's quite different and very obviously not connected with precognition. If anything a precognitive experience is most similar to Déjà rêvé, which means \"already dreamed\", but I find the term is insufficient to properly explain the experience in its entirety. A precognitive dream actually informs the dreamer of nothing when it is dreamed, it's incomprehensible because of how the information is 'sent back' or perhaps 'sent fowards'. Both the dream and the moment it represents are two points in time. It is not actually a dream, it's more of an overlapping of the present mind, which is dreaming, with the future mind, which is awake. For the sake of simplicity I will call it a dream here. I will give an example of the general situation and structure of a dream.\n\nOften the dream will be something impossible to predict and mundane, such as sitting in a location, reading a book, or looking at something on a computer. I will then think something like \"Oh, I remember this, now it makes sense what I was doing.\" The dreamer me will not understand what it has seen or thought, but nonetheless the experience will still impress itself upon my mind. Once I wake I wont remember what I have dreamed, but somewhere the mind makes a note and remembers subconsciously. Now we go to the future version of myself that will share the experience. The terrifying thing is that because it is both 'minds' synchronized, it becomes a paradox in a way. It seems to be impossible to go against what I did in the dream, to do anything different from what one 'already' did. I find myself held hostage by the situation and can only follow through my lines until the moment has passed. When I feel that sensation of precognition, I will remember the moment in the dream exactly as it happened, but now in the future my mind can make sense of it. So I'm both experiencing it for the first time, but also experiencing it again, and have also experienced it multiple times at once. I will have context, I will know where I am and why I was here, hence the thought of \"Now it makes sense what I was doing.\" Then the moment will pass, and I'll be left wondering why such situations are happening, and when the next one will come.\n\nI'm not sure if this made sense, it's already hard enough for me to understand, let alone try to explain it to someone who hasn't experienced it. I actually had a precognitive experience while writing this explanation. I feel recently as if I've been having more precognitive dreams and it fills me with dread. They used to be something that might happen every few months, but now they seem to be happening more often. Or maybe they've always happened this often. After all I only just realized I can try to keep track of them. I've had them for as long as I can remember, but as I get older the feeling feels more nebulous. When I was a child the precognitive dream would have a sort of hard line as to where it began and ended. Now I seem to stumble into it, and I can't quite get a grasp on when the experience ends. Maybe they'll go away as I gain in years, although this idea also horrifies me. Will my brain change in such a way as to make me stop having them? Their increase in number makes me nervous, as if I'm building up towards something. It must have been a noticeable increase for me to realize I was having more of them.\n\nEvery time I have one a pit opens up inside me. I know that time travel of information is possible in some way, that all this has happened, or will happen, or is happening. It is impossible for it to tell one anything. Anyone who says their precognitive dreams told them something is lying. It is possible to interpret them to mean something or the other, but one cannot remember they had a precognitive dream at all until the moment it showed actually happens, and as one cannot remember, they cannot say it told them anything and cannot 'foretell' the future. Time is not so much a line as it is a crumpled ball, and precognitive dreams show how messy it all can be. All experiences happening twice or more at once, having happened and will happen and are happening. It is comforting in a way, however, to know that it has all happened and the future is still connected with the past in an intrinsic way. But still it leaves me with unease. Why am I having more? Why now? The future itself doesn't scare me, it's both knowing and not knowing it that scares me.",

        "text": "[Misery Keeps Calling Me (Part One)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10gccv8/misery_keeps_calling_me_part_one/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI found myself in the center of a dark room. I looked around; it’s dark aside from a single bright light above me and I could make out a whiteboard on a wall in front of me. I’m seated at a school desk and it took me a moment to realize just how familiar the space was. This was the classroom from my previous school. “Beeeecky..” a woman’s voice whispered and I could feel her breath fall on my right ear. “Beeeecky..” she whispered again playfully and it gave me goosebumps on my neck.\n\nShe placed her hands on my shoulders and began to massage them. “Just…relax” she purred before setting her lips on the back of my head. A warm kiss that chilled me to my core. I wanted to tell her to stop, but the words couldn’t escape my throat. The woman slid her hands down my arms towards mine and interlaced our fingers. She began to squeeze my hand so tightly that I yelped in pain. \n\nDiscordant voices emerged from the shadows of the room. “Becky has been making eyes at my boyfriend…” “I heard weird noises coming from the classroom” “Boys and girls aren’t safe from her…” “Disgusting…” The curses, the accusations grew louder and louder that it was almost deafening. Dark red letters began to appear on the whiteboard like deep slashes on skin. The words “Slut” and “Whore” were etched all over the wall and each letter oozed a crimson ichor. \n\nI felt a hard tug on my hair that caused my head to snap back. I looked up and I was face to face with…a young girl, not the woman that caused me so much pain. The girl had long black hair and eyes that were similar to mine. Her face was covered in deep purple bruises and she was smiling at me with blood stained teeth. “You’re all mine..” she said with a voice that grated at my ears, it sounded like multiple people talking to me all at once. “You’re all miiiine, Beeeecky….”\n\n“BECKY!” a man’s voice said in a stern voice. “BECKY!” the man said again and I realized where I actually was. After Paige had smashed her face on the wall behind me and her friends had called 911. The ambulance had come, but it was far too late and the police had gathered us for questioning. I was sitting at a table in a room at the police station with an officer in front of me. I’d already told him everything and as I looked down at my blood splattered clothes I could remember the cracking sound of Paige’s skull on brick.\n\n“I don’t know what else to tell you…” I said weakly. The officer let out a frustrated sigh, “So from what I gathered from you and the other girls, you and Paige were in a…altercation.” He got up from his seat and groaned a bit before continuing, “Your phone started ringing and whoever was on the other line talked to Paige.” The officer began to pace back and forth. “Whoever she was talking to…spooked her or something and made her ram her head into a brick wall.” \n\n“Yes..Yessir..” I said under my breath. The officer let out another long sigh and said, “After going through your phone we couldn’t have any incoming or outgoing calls. I don’t know what the Hell happened, but I do know that your friend is dead and this…this just doesn’t add up..” Before he could say anything else, the door to the room flung open and my Mom was standing there with a fierce look on her face. “I think we’re done here, officer.” she said with a tone that made the officer audibly gulp. \n\nMom quickly rushed to my side and grabbed my hand to pull me out of my seat. It seemed rough, but my Mom’s hand felt warm and gentle. I squeezed her hand and she gave me a quick glance, her eyes filled with worry. She fixed her face forward and wiped her eyes a bit, “Oh, Becky Boo..” her voice faltered a bit, but she was able to keep composed, “I’m sorry you had to go through all of that..” We both returned home and my blood splattered clothes were thrown in the dumpster outside our apartment. \n\nAfter a quick microwave dinner, we sat on the couch in the living room and I was nestled into her arm. The police had already informed her of everything that happened and I wanted to tell her my side of the story. I looked up at her and she hugged me tighter. “Shh. I know it’s not your fault. I know what you went through is horrible, but you don’t have to talk about it right now.” she said with a dulcet tone. I wanted to cry, my Mom continued to be such a radiant light in my life despite the mishap at my old school…and even the incident that just happened. \n\nI felt safe with my Mom, but I knew that I couldn’t stay in her arms forever. “Mom, it’s getting late, shouldn’t you be getting ready for work.” She began to brush my hair with her hand, “No way, Becky Boo, I refuse to leave you here all alone after what happened!” she said with the same stern voice she used at the police station. It has always been the two of us for as long as I could remember. My dad had left my mom while she was pregnant with me and she’s taken care of me all by herself. \n\nI knew how hard it was for her to miss out on work, but despite my complaints she refused to leave my side. So we stayed there on the couch and she kept me safe as she always did. I closed my eyes for a moment and within the silence I found peace. BZZZ BZZZ. I opened my eyes to hear my phone vibrating in the distance. Mom was fast asleep and I carefully moved her arm to the side to lift myself up. BZZZ BZZZ. I got up and slowly stepped towards the direction of the sound.\n\nI was so tired that I just wanted the noise to stop so I could go back to sleep. I didn’t think about what time it was or who could possibly be on the other side of the call when I picked up the phone. BZZZ BZZZ. I pulled the phone out of my backpack and I looked on the screen to see that it was completely black aside from a symbol to answer the call. I groggily swiped my finger across the phone and placed it on my ear. “Hello?” I called out with a yawn. \n\nThe sound that I heard from the call was a mixture of static and garbled words from different tones of voices. It felt as if my heart sank into my gut as I kept the phone to my ear. “Hello, who’s there?” I called out but the noise continued. I tried to make out the words I was hearing and each voice sounded like it was calling for help. Then there was absolute silence from the phone. \n\n“Who is-” before I could finish an agonized scream bursted from the phone. I dropped the phone and it fell to the carpeted floor of my bedroom. I stumbled backwards and fell onto the bed. I looked up at the ceiling within the darkness of the room. My heart was racing and I could hear it thumping against my ribs. I tried to be calm by brushing off what just happened as some sort of waking dream. Then I heard a soft voice call out from where my legs hung off the bed. \n\n“Becky…Beeecky…” it was the girl’s voice from the incident. I tried to pull my legs in to retreat, but I felt two hands grab at my ankles. I let out a scream as whoever had a hold of me began to pull me off the bed. “MOM! MOM!” I frantically yelled. The hands that held my ankles made their way up my legs. I could feel cold flesh grasping at me as the hands wrapped around my knees. A slight pressure and I saw a dark shape rise from the floor. \n\nI screamed for my Mom again, I was so sure that she would save me, but my savior didn’t come through the door. I fixed my sights back to the shape in front of me and in the dark I could make out a thin girl’s frame. The girl began to crawl onto the bed, over my body towards me. I tried to shuffle away, but my back was already against the wall. I watched helplessly as the dark silhouette of this girl slowly….slowly moved over me. Her face was so close to mine, mere centimeters away and as if letting out a long disgusting sigh she said with a cacophonous voice, “Beeeeeeeeeeeeckyyyy.\n\nIn the darkness I could feel her gaze on me, tracing every inch of my face. The bed shuffled and I felt her hand move to my head. She ran her thin, cold fingers through hair. “I’ll be there…I’m here for you….always..” the girl whispered. I awoke with a jolt and I looked around to find myself in my bedroom. I got up from my bed and found the phone lying face down on the floor. I picked it up and everything was normal. I wanted to break down and cry, but I had to stay strong for my Mom. \n\nI tried to continue my usual morning routine of getting ready for school, but I could still feel the girl’s eyes on me. After everything that had happened I was sure I was going crazy. I didn’t want to go to school, I wanted to just disappear altogether, but Mom’s hug before I left gave me enough strength to go on. I dreaded each step I took as I got closer to the school gate. I could already hear the other students whisper and murmur about what had happened yesterday. \n\n“I heard she killed Paige..” someone whispered and I could feel all the other people watching me…staring at me as if I was some kind of monster. I felt a hand on my shoulder and I jumped. I wanted to instantly vomit…the feeling of a hand on my shoulder triggered nauseating memories. I turned around to see it was Aaron, the boy that Paige liked. “Whoa. Hey, sorry. Didn’t mean to scare you..” He said nervously. Aaron gave an awkward smile, but I was happy to be focused on him and not everyone else. \n\n“Oh. Hey..” I responded, wary of what he wanted. He sighed, “Listen, I just wanted to check in on you. I heard about what happened with Paige…but…I know it's nothing you did.” I wasn’t expecting anyone aside from my Mom to show me any form of kindness. I didn’t know what to say but I gave him a quick, “Thanks..” and turned to go to class. I took a few steps and I felt my phone vibrate. A wave of fear washed over me and I lifted the phone out of my pocket to see a text notification. “Wanna meet around lunch?” from an unknown number and I turned around to see Aaron giving me a wave. \n\nThe hours I spent in school were agonizing. In a whole building filled with people I felt completely isolated. I couldn’t have a single moment without hearing someone talk about me. A ringing of a bell echoed throughout the hallways that signaled lunch time. I stepped out of class to see Aaron waiting for me in the hallway. People passed between us, yet he slowly made his way towards me. “H-hey there!” he said cheerfully. I didn’t agree to spend time with him, but I wasn’t the type of person to refuse anyone anyways. \n\n“Follow me!” he said as he guided me through the current of bodies. The sound of footsteps and shouting was blaring in my ears while I walked behind Aaron. I focused my attention on his back, his tall frame easily noticeable with his shaggy brown hair atop his head. We made our way towards a door and he opened to show an empty classroom. He led me inside, closing the door as soon as I got inside to shut out the sound from the hall. \n\nIt was quiet in that room, no more voices….and the only eyes on me were his. I looked into his brown eyes that showed nothing but..sympathy. “Oh…you must be hungry.” He removed his backpack and reached inside to reveal a chocolate bar. “Here, you can have it…” I took the chocolate from his hand and I couldn’t help but laugh. “What’s so funny?” he asked and after I finished laughing I responded, “Oh it’s nothing…Just wasn’t expecting this.” I unwrapped the chocolate and I took a bite, the lightly sweet taste of it coated my mouth. \n\n“This classroom is mostly used for storage, but I come in here whenever I need to have a moment alone.” He explained. “Or when you feel like skipping class?” I joked. He chuckled, “Yeah every now and then.” I sat at one of the desks and looked at the empty whiteboard in front of me. My mind began to wander but his voice brought me back to reality. “My sister always eats chocolate when she’s having a bad day or something, so I thought it’d help..” Aaron said. I looked down at the chocolate and my chest began to feel warm. \n\n“I heard about all that happened yesterday and I know it must be…absolutely crazy to be around for that.” he said as he sat at the desk in front of me. “If you ever need to talk, feel free to shoot me a text or something.” I didn’t know what else to say, I just wasn’t expecting any sort of kindness from people that day. We sat in awkward silence until he asked, “So…Um…how about we get started on that project?” He made me giggle and I was so relieved to have just a bit of normalcy with that moment. I reached for my backpack to notice that I had left it in my last class. \n\n“Crap…I left my backpack in class.” I told him as I got up from my seat. “Oh I was just kidding…we don’t have to-” Before I could let him finish I said, “It’s fine. I’m actually kinda okay right now and…we should definitely get started on it.” I walked to the door and assured him, “I’ll be right back, okay?” He flashed a smile as I closed the door and went to get my backpack. It was only a few minutes…not even five minutes but within that small moment of time something horrible was set in motion. \n\nWhen I returned to the room where Aaron was I saw him standing in front of one of the windows. “See anything interesting out there?” I said, but he didn’t respond. “Hello? Aaron?” I called out to him again and still he didn’t respond. I slowly stepped closer to him and I could hear a faint whispering. “Mine…she’s mine..” I glanced down to see my phone in Aaron’s hand that was at his side. I called out to him again and he turned his head a bit to look at me. \n\nHis eyes…Aaron’s eyes that were once filled with kindness had gone completely white. He flashed a smile and he spoke, but his voice…his voice was the girl’s voice. “All mine, Becky Boo.” the voice said as he turned back to the window and began to ram his head into the glass, spider webbed cracks began to appear on its surface. He began to slam his head into the window again and again until he stumbled backwards.  \n\nThe window had shattered and left a jagged hole. I screamed for help, hoping that it would alert someone…anyone at all. I screamed and I could hear laughter coming from the phone. Aaron placed a hand on the broken window and with a sharp edge he slowly sliced into his palm. Blood began to drip from his wound and I shouted again. I quickly stepped to him in an attempt to stop whatever he was doing, but he simply turned to look at me. He muttered under his break and it was the girl’s voice once again, “All mine…” With a quick fluid motion, he snapped a piece of glass from the window and brought it to his throat.",

        "text": "Another day. Another boring, boring day, working in Picklebury, Kentucky. It was a dark evening, and I had just finished a long day of work. I was driving to my house, when suddenly I heard a loud chant from my neighborhood's park. I, being the idiot I was, decided to check on it and stumbled upon a cult with a man wearing a green suit in the middle. I was confused and slowly started walking in their direction, increasing my pace with every step. Soon, I was flat out running towards them, before abruptly stopping, realizing what exactly I was doing. Strange. It was like something had just come over me. So, I decided to consume my Toyota Corolla 2011, swallowing it whole. Wait - that's not possible! I screamed as I realized the extent to which my hunger had taken me. So, in order to properly fulfill my food-eating fantasies, I walked home and ordered 13 Big Macs with Uber Eats. As I gleefully rubbed my hands, waiting for the food to arrive, I noticed a whisper coming from the closet. I opened the closet, and to my horror, the same cult was in there performing the same ritual, with the man in green in the center. \"Get the hell out of here right now you stupid morons!!\", I shouted. They went silent. Slowly, they all started to turn towards me with the same expression - a big, fake smile. I screamed in horror and ran to my neighbor's house. When I rang the bell, no one answered, so I used my sledgehammer, which I kept in my pocket just in case, to break the door open and barge in. The first thing I did was to check if there was any food in the fridge, but when I opened the fridge, there they were again - the same ritual, the same man in green. This time, they were chanting a bit more loudly. I slammed the fridge door shut and ran to my local gym, noticing that, eerily, nobody was there. I ran inside, trying to search for somebody to help me, when I noticed that on one of the basketball courts, the same ritual was happening. Without another second of investigation, I sprinted out of the gym and booked it to the nearest library, which just so happened to be the abandoned one that had been untouched for decades. Once I got there, I looked through the shelves, frantically looking for a clue as to what was happening to me. As I opened a book titled \"Rituals of Picklebury\", I noticed whispers behind me. I whipped around, dreading what I would see, and sure enough, there was the same ritual. I decided that I had had enough. I figured I was hallucinating everything, so I walked home calmly, and collected my Big Macs. But, when I opened the bag, there they were again! Inside the bag, the same people, the same ritual. Enough. I threw the bag in the incinerator I kept in my house, just in case, watching them burn. I smiled with happiness, before throwing on my favorite green suit, and walking to my neighborhood's local park.\n\nIt was time to perform the ritual. I think I found my [next victim.](www.reddit.com/u/me)",

        "text": "Since I was very young, I’ve had this irrational terror that the me in the mirror is always looking at me first.\n\nIt’s probably because of our creepy hallway mirror. See, the mirror at the end of our hall gave me the heebie-jeebies, and not just because the glass was darkly tinted and scratched. I’d come out of the bathroom, turn toward my bedroom door, and stop, frozen in terror at the flutter of a pale nightgown, the black hollows of eyes staring back at me from down in the darkness at the end of the hall. For just an instant, I’d wonder if that ghostly figure was an intruder. Then, I’d recognize my own silhouette, keeping a wary eye on it (and it on me) as I hurried down the hall to my bedroom door. \n\nThat’s what started the habit… \n\nAnytime I pass a mirror, anywhere, in the day or at night, I always turn my head and look—just stare at my reflection—to make sure it’s really me, and not some sort of doppelganger making faces behind my back, like reflections sometimes do in cartoons. \n\nAs a kid, the mirror I passed most often, other than the one at the end of the hall, was the bathroom mirror at school, which was really just a giant mirror wall covered in greasy fingerprints. So everyday, when at some point I’d go in to use the restroom, I’d find myself walking by that mirror, and I’d make eye contact before I entered the stall, and again when I was washing my hands at the sink. \n\nAnd—I don’t know why—but I got it in my head that my reflection was the one looking at me *first*.\n\nIt’s ridiculous, I know. You turn your head to your reflection and it’s already looking at you—but that’s because it moved at the same time as you. It’s impossible to turn and look at your own reflection without it also staring back at you. You can’t do it. It all happens at the speed of the light, which in human terms is instantaneous. Turn. Look. Meet your own eyes. You will never turn BEFORE your reflection. You can’t be that fast.\n\nBut somehow, it felt like my reflection was actually faster than me. \n\nLike, instead of the motion being simultaneous, or even a fraction of a fraction of a second behind—the speed it takes for the light to bounce off that silvered surface and back—it felt as if that were in reverse. Like the mirror was turning to look at me, staring, and that’s what drew my eyes to it. Like I was always just a fraction of a second too late.\n\nAnd I knew it was real, because I could feel its eyes on me before I turned my head.\n\nBut I couldn’t prove it.\n\nThis was maddening and terrifying, because of course I couldn’t convince anyone to believe me. I doubt I could convince YOU. It sounds laughable, right?\n\nBut then last week… I’m pretty sure I caught it smiling at me. Like, I felt my reflection’s eyes on me, and I was really annoyed, and refusing to look up, telling myself that it wasn’t actually looking and I just have lousy peripheral vision and that if I turned my head, it would be looking only because \\**I\\** was. And I kept thumbing through my phone, refusing to take what I considered to be the mirror’s “bait” (yes I know this makes me sound like a crazy person… but since this is what actually happened I want to put it all down). And finally after finishing my email and pushing up my glasses I at last allowed myself to look up at my own reflection, which of course was looking right back at me, only…\n\nIt was smiling.\n\nJust the faintest of smiles. Like the Mona Lisa. I stared in shock, and then I thought, Wait, am *\\*I\\** smiling? I didn’t think I was. But then I felt my lip curl and my reflection’s smile quirked up further, before turning into an abrupt scowl that matched what I was doing. And everything seemed normal again.\n\nI’m just not sure who smiled first. I’m not sure I was smiling at all before I saw my reflection’s smile. Was I? Logically, I must’ve been, but I thought… I could’ve sworn I was frowning.\n\nIf nothing else had happened after that I’d have said I was imagining it all.\n\nBut then it happened again. This time it was unmistakable. I can prove it—I mean, no, I can’t prove it—but I KNOW it happened because it wasn’t just some faint smile that might’ve been a facial tic. I was standing at a bus stop outside a store, and could see my reflection in the window glass. I’d already made eye contact with it and done my usual dance of is-it-looking-or-am-I-looking, and had dismissed any concerns about it (especially since it was less noticeable than a mirror, being in transparent window glass, so that I could see traffic passing by behind it). Anyway, I looked down at my phone and was texting when something prickled the hairs on my nape. I just felt… I don’t know. That sensation of being watched. \n\nSo I lifted up my head and looked at my reflection and in the window glass, I was… screaming. \n\nMouth open wide, eyes so wide I could see the whites, an expression of sheer and utter terror. \n\nIt was so startling that I felt my own jaw drop as I gaped, heart hammering in my chest. I almost felt my heart stop right then. And then… I clapped a hand to my mouth, and my reflection did the same, and it just… looked like my reflection again.\n\nBut why was it—why was *I*—screaming?\n\nI didn’t make a sound in real life. I know because if I had, passersby would have reacted. I was in broad daylight by a bus stop with plenty of foot traffic. That incident was the first to really shake me, because WTF? There’s no way I would just stand there, screaming silently at myself. What is going on?\n\nIt’s been happening more frequently. Enough that friends have started asking, “Why do you make faces at yourself in the mirror?” The question took me by surprise a couple days ago when we met for an early morning study session at a coffee shop, a place with kitschy mirrors along the wall in handmade frames. “I don’t,” I said. “The reflection makes faces at me.”\n\nThat made them laugh. They thought I was joking. I laughed, too, because I didn’t want to talk about it (what was there to say? Good morning, I’m fruit loops, how are you?) But then they said, “Seriously though, why?”\n\n“Umm, I dunno, I guess I never noticed.” This was such a blatant lie, and I was trying hard not to look at the mirror version of me since I was sure my reflection would be doing something weird that I would then mimic. But I caught a view of motion in my periphery and instinctively turned my head.\n\nMy reflection’s face was contorted in a scream, eyes round and unseeing and blank with some unspeakable horror, and swung a hand at me.\n\nScreeching, I flung my arm up to defend myself and ended up hitting my hand against the mirror—hitting my own reflection’s hand.\n\nMy friend busted a gut laughing at me. He thought I was so weird, doing it for shits and giggles—that, or I was just a quirky, silly girl who spooked easily.\n\nI moved out of view of the mirror when I sat back down with him. We finished our coffee and later, when I stood up and looked again, it was because my reflection had looked at me first. I know it. We locked eyes. And even though it was *me* and did everything I did, there was something else there—I was sure of it this time. \n\nVideo might be the only way to prove it’s happening. The human eye may not be fast enough—but you can’t fool a camera. Last night, I went ahead and set it all up by myself because anybody I try to tell thinks I’m INSANE or just this quirky silly haha easily scared girl, and I’m not. I swear I’m not. There’s something *wrong* with my reflection. \n\nBut it got so much fucking worse while I was setting up the camera. I used this blank room in my friend’s apartment—he’s moving out, just cleaned up, didn’t actually need to be moved out for another few days, so the place was sitting there empty and he said it was fine to use. And it was perfect, because one of the bedrooms has these mirrored closet doors from floor to ceiling. I brought a second mirror—the old dark hallway mirror from home—which I stood upright against a chair. Then I set the camera up like so:\n\n  **(me)**  **((hallway mirror))**\n\n **\\[\\^phone camera facing me\\^\\]**\n\n **((mirrored closet doors))**\n\nBasically, this meant the camera captured both me and the reflection of me—a reflection that bounced through the mirrored closet doors and back to the hallway mirror next to me. \n\nReal me and reflection me were thus both in the same frame at the same time. \n\nOnce I set this up, I planted myself on a stool in front of the camera and opened a book. My plan was to sit there and read, ignoring the creeping feeling of eyes on me no matter how bad it got, with the hope that the video would catch mirror-me in action while real me refused to move.\n\nSimple, right?\n\nI began to read.\n\nAt first, it was really boring. I’d brought my physics textbook—I was trying to catch up on studying for exams—but it was a poor choice because I found it hard to keep my eyes pinned to the page. My gaze kept trying to rove, not because of any sense of being watched, but simply because the laws of thermodynamics was not exactly riveting stuff. I was in the middle of trying to memorize the zeroth law when I felt a prickling along my nape, and it took all my willpower not to look up. I just sat there, staring at the textbook, reading over and over, “if two systems are in thermal equilibrium…” meaningless garble, the words blending together while the prickle at my nape spread, the chill like ice water trickling down my back. The sensation intensified. I was desperate to look up, to see what was on the camera, but I restrained myself. *Wait,* I told myself.\n\nThe feeling was all but unbearable now. I could practically feel cold fingers tracing along my spine. The crawl of eyes over me, boring into me. The whisper of ragged breathing in my ear. I counted… 10… 9… 8… 7… slowly, refusing to rush myself, letting my fingers tap on the page. Finally, I raised my eyes.\n\nAnd I screamed.\n\nMy reflection was dragging a blade across my throat.\n\nI shrieked, flinging my arms. The terrible pain that bit into my skin didn’t even register as I staggered into the standing mirror, bashing into my own flailing reflection. The mirror shattered into a million glinting shards of my reflection, blood-spattered, screaming, mouths so wide as to be too large for my faces. Screaming and screaming and screaming…\n\n… I woke up on the floor covered in lacerations and bleeding from a cut on my neck. My friend whose apartment it is was shouting my name, and there were paramedics pressing the wound on my neck to stop the bleeding. I was rushed to the hospital. \n\nAnd that’s where I am now… no more mirrors. \n\nThe staff have been told not to let me see my reflection anywhere. Apparently it “triggers” me. \n\nThe doctors think I tried to slit my own throat.\n\nI feel… fine. I don’t feel like I’m crazy. They seem to think I’m acting out for attention. That I balked at the last second because my attempt was a cry for help. And so I don’t know what to do. I wrote it all in my notebook, and gave it to my friend to crowdsource advice. I don’t want to be here, but they won’t let me out until they’re convinced I’m okay. \n\nThey don’t believe me about the reflections. \n\nThat video I took as proof… I asked my friend to bring it to me. To bring my phone, so I could show it to the doctors. Finally show them what really happened. Just a little while ago, my friend came to visit, and as requested brought out my phone and showed me the video.\n\nGod. There’s nothing for me to do but describe it…\n\nIn the video you can see a girl who is me. It’s hard for me to think of her as me—she looks the way that ghostly apparition in a flimsy nightgown used to look lurking at the end of the darkened hallway at night. Like a stranger. An apparition. But I know, rationally, that she *is* me. She’s seated by herself on a stool, holding a book on her lap. But she’s not reading. She’s staring fixedly into her reflection. Staring… staring… Her lips move as she counts down from ten. Suddenly she screams, bashing herself into the standing mirror, and after she has shattered it into a million pieces she stands there in the center of the room screaming and screaming, a long wicked shard from the broken glass in her hand. She moves to slit her throat At the last instant, she pulls the shard away, stopping just short of cutting too deep, and she drops the shard and faints to the floor, bleeding.\n\nI don’t remember it happening like that. \n\nBut this is “proof” that I recorded.\n\nWhen my friend showed me, I could feel my face crumple in despair, tears welling in my eyes. But the last thing I saw, as my friend clicked off the phone that he was clearly regretting bringing to me, was my reflection in the suddenly darkened screen. A reflection that, through those teary eyes, was smiling at me.",

Just let me grab my stuff, and we’ll be ready to go.”\n\n“Where are we going again?” she asked as I threw my backpack on. \n\n“We’re going to this little town called Cape Hood. It’s in Arkansas. It’s going to be about a four and a half hour drive.”\n\n“Well, this should be fun. How did you even find out which town you were talking about in the story? You didn’t write in a name, did you?”\n\n“I did some research while you were at home grabbing your things. Remember that kid that I mentioned going missing at the beginning?”\n\nShe sheepishly shook her head.\n\n“I guess someone still hasn’t read my stories… On the first page or so, I wrote that this kid named Johnny Cameron went missing after a trip to Chuck E. Cheese’s. He’s presumed dead, and his family was cursed. I was able to find the town by searching the kid’s name. The local news station published an article about it.”\n\n“Makes sense. Let’s go ahead and get on the road. I want to get this over with. Chuck E. Cheese gives me the creeps.”\n\nWe turned to depart for our trip. I suddenly stopped in my tracks. Jake’s door squeaked as he peaked his head around the corner. \n\n“Where are y’all going?” he timidly asked as he stared at his feet. \n\n“We’re going to Arkansas. We’ll be gone for a couple days. We’ve got a rat to kill.”\n\n“Wait… I’m coming with you.”\n\n“Are you sure? We can handle this if you still need some alone time. I don’t want you to feel like you have to.”\n\n“I’ll be fine. I’m not going to let something happen to you two just because I’m in my feelings. Wouldn’t do me any good to mope around the house while y’all are gone anyway.”\n\n“Alright. Grab your things and let’s head out.”\n\nWe were on the road ten minutes later. The ride there was uneventful. Rows of endless cornfields made for a less than exciting trip. Jake slept most of the time, while Sidney served as our DJ. By the time we arrived, I hoped I’d never have to listen to another Taylor Swift song for as long as I lived. After hours of winding through monotonous backroads and one-light towns, we finally made it. \n\nThe sleepy little town wasn’t noteworthy in any way. If you blinked you’d probably miss it. It was exactly what I’d expected. Mom-and-pop shops lined the town square, and run-down houses were dotted throughout the landscape. It didn’t take long to find Chuck E. Cheese’s. \n\nMy car crept into the nearly empty parking lot. The setting sun lent an eerie air to the atmosphere that made the decrepit shell of a building seem that much creepier. I noted that there was a Chevy Tahoe along with a police cruiser parked alongside each other a few spaces down. Two men leaned against the back of the Chevy. They leered at us suspiciously as we rolled to a stop.\n\n“Jake, wake up. We’re here.”\n\nI jostled his leg until he inevitably stirred from his nap. \n\n“Wha- uh. I’m awake. I’m awake.”\n\n“Uh, Matt,” Sidney whispered, nodding toward my window. \n\nI nearly jumped out of my skin, smacking my head on the roof of the car. An older looking police officer stood on the other side, motioning for me to roll the window down. I obliged, rubbing my throbbing head. The officer tilted his glasses so that his dark brown eyes met mine.\n\n“Now, I don’t know what you kids are doing here, but you need to get lost. We don’t take kindly to visitors.”\n\nHe spat in the dirt and glared at me intensely.\n\n“Just let me explain. You’re Officer Jenkins, aren’t you? And I’m assuming he’s Cole?” I asked, pointing to the man who was now making his way toward the vehicle.\n\n“Look, son. I don’t know how you know that, but it would be in your best interest to scram. You don’t want to be booked on trespassing charges, do you? Because I can arrange that.”\n\n“Marshall, let’s just hear them out. Maybe they have a good reason for being here. They don’t seem like bad kids from what I can tell,” the second man urged, keeping his voice low.\n\n“Alright, talk. No bullshit. I’ll know if you’re lying.”\n\nI explained the whole story to him, making sure to include every tiny detail. Officer Jenkins interrupted me multiple times for clarification, each time reiterating that he’d throw us in a cell in a heartbeat if he thought we weren’t telling the truth. His friend stayed silent. By the end, both their faces had drained of color. They shot each other a nervous glance. \n\n“I thought we were the only ones who knew,” Officer Jenkins mumbled. \n\n“So did I,” his companion whispered, “but they’re here now, and they seem like they’re telling the truth, so I don’t see any harm in letting them help out. Honestly, we could probably use it.”\n\n“Okay. You can help. You can start by telling us your names.”\n\n“This is Matt. That dunder-head in the back is Jake. And I’m Sidney.”\n\nShe reached over me to extend a hand to the men. Officer Jenkins disregarded it coldly. The second man shook it, giving her a soft smile that didn’t reach his eyes. \n\n“Cole. Nice to meet you all.”\n\n“So, what’s the game plan?” I chimed in. \n\n“We’ve got enough gas in the back of my car to fuel Burning Man for a year. Marshall and I are going to set the place ablaze. We’ve been waiting for a few days to send this puppy up in flames. It’s rained every day since I’ve been here, so this is the first chance we’re getting.”\n\n“Sounds like a solid plan. How can we help?” Jake implored.\n\nCole pondered for a moment. \n\n“I’ve got it. Start unboarding that window over there. We’re going to smash it in so you can alert us if Chuck E. shows up while we’re dumping the gas.”\n\n“Perfect. Do you have a crowbar we can use?” I asked.\n\n“Yeah, Let me get it from the car.”\n\nCole trotted to his Chevy and returned with a silver crowbar, handing it to me. We all hopped out of the car and tentatively approached the window. I went to work on it, and the boards popped off with ease. The elements had worn them away, and in no time we had a clear view of the building’s interior. \n\nIt was like a time capsule. The whole thing was coated in a thick layer of dust, evidence that the place had been untouched for decades. A sea of retro arcade games lay scattered throughout the massive room. At the front of the playhouse sat a ticket counter, hundreds of unclaimed prizes lying behind the glass. To our left was a dining area. Purple picnic tables sat abandoned, never to be used again. A children’s play area loomed in the corner, a network of winding plastic multicolored tubes intersecting at all angles. The heart-stopping things though, were the animatronics. Three decaying cartoon-like characters glared at us from atop a stage, eyes locked onto us and overflowing with unbridled hatred. \n\n“Move over,” Cole demanded.\n\nHe snatched the crowbar from my grip and smashed the window with one fell swoop, clearing the shattered glass from the edges once he was done.\n\n“Stand watch and yell for us if that *thing* decides to rear its ugly head. And, as I’m sure you already know, don’t go in there under any circumstances. This place is cursed, and if something happens to us, there’s no use in making your lives a living Hell.”\n\n“Got it. I have a feeling that if this abomination is still alive, we’ll be just fine,” I grinned, unholstering my firearm. \n\n“Even better,” Cole smirked. \n\n“Before y’all go, though,” Jake interjected, “Officer Jenkins, why are you here? I thought you didn’t actually go in the place after Cole and his friends.”\n\n“Who do you think they called after the first kid went missing?” \n\nCole sidled up to me and whispered in my ear. \n\n“His wife left him and took the kids. He’s hoping this will get them back.”\n\nI nodded and pursed my lips. \n\n“Let’s get this over with, son. You’ve got a family to get back to.”\n\n“Right. Time to burn that rat where he stands.”\n\nWe watched as Cole and Officer Jenkins lugged gallons upon gallons of gasoline into the forsaken structure. They started with the stage. I could’ve sworn the spiteful eyes of the animatronics followed them as they did so. They dragged the open plastic containers through the entire room, dousing the floors and flinging petrol on everything in sight. They reached the ticket counter, and that’s when I saw it. \n\nThe restroom door gradually creaked open. What slipped out chilled me to my core. A colossal rat stepped into the dim moonlight, sniffing wildly, its nose pointed toward the ceiling. Its gray matted fur was patchy and disheveled. Even at our distance, I thought I could make out little specks of dried blood coagulated within it. Jagged orange teeth protruded from its oversized jaw, chattering manically, as its long pink tail swayed back and forth like a pendulum. And the worst part; even after all those years, that tattered bloodstained T-shirt still hugged its chest. \n\nSidney shrieked, alerting Cole and Officer Jenkins to his presence. Out of nowhere, all the ancient arcade games instantly burst to life, flooding the room with blinding light and a cacophony of distorted soundtracks. Chuck E.’s eyes darted around the room as he attempted to locate his prey. Cole and Officer Jenkins hid adjacent to each other. Cole ducked behind the ticket booth, while Jenkins crouched behind Pac-Man. \n\nI snapped out of the stupor I had unknowingly fallen into. I fired two shots at the beast. And missed. It scampered off, in the direction of our cohorts. I kept my aim locked on Chuck E., unable to get a clear shot. We watched in horror as Chuck E. found Officer Jenkins and pounced on him, sending the pair tumbling to the floor.\n\nChuck E. unhinged his jaw, gargantuan teeth primed to burrow into Officer Jenkins’s neck.\n\n*Pow. Pow. Pow.* \n\nRapid gunfire rang out as Officer Jenkins unloaded his entire clip into the vermin’s gut. It released a guttural roar, but toppled to the ground, allowing Officer Jenkins to escape unscathed. Cole emerged from behind the ticket booth. \n\n“Close one, huh?” he muttered, as Officer Jenkins kicked the monstrosity in the mouth, his steel-toed boot shattering those horrid teeth with a single blow.\n\n“You got that right.”\n\nThey began to return to the back of the building to leave. I had a sinking feeling that Chuck E. Cheese’s hadn’t finished with them yet, though. And to my utter disbelief, I was right. The three crumbling animatronics jolted to life, squeaking joints resounding over the symphony of dissonant machines. They stepped from the stage as Cole and Officer Jenkins stared in shock, effectively cutting off their exit.\n\nThe animatronics trundled towards them, slowly making progress. A chef with a long black mustache led the charge, mechanical hands reaching to grab the terrified duo. A white bird in a ragged pink skirt trailed him, rabidly snapping her faded yellow beak. A beagle dressed in overalls followed suit, wielding a rugged splintered banjo as a weapon.\n\n“Cole! Jenkins! Over here!” I screamed, gun trained on the robots. \n\nThey snapped their heads in our direction and began sprinting toward the broken window. I was nearly knocked off balance when Jake yanked my shirt sleeve as he tore off a large chunk of fabric. \n\n“H-hey! What do you think you’re doing?”\n\n“I’ll buy you a new shirt later. Just trust me. I have an idea. I need you to unlock the car. You still have that lighter in the glove box from your stoner phase, right?”\n\n“Yeah, it should still be there.”\n\n“Awesome.”\n\nHe darted to the car and began rifling through the glove compartment. Sidney raised an eyebrow at me.\n\n“Don’t give me that look. I was going through a tough time, okay?”\n\n“I never said I had a problem with it. I just didn’t peg you as a smoker.”\n\n“It was a coping mechanism. Can we please focus on the task at hand?”\n\nJake returned with a handful of assorted items. He’d gathered the lighter, a glass Coke bottle, some gasoline that Cole had left behind, and my tattered shirt sleeve. \n\n“You’re a genius, bro.”\n\n“I know. You can thank me later.”\n\nJake cautiously filled the bottle with gas and stuffed the ripped fabric inside. Cole had just climbed out the window, while Officer Jenkins was beginning to do so himself. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw movement directly behind him. My eyes grew wide as dinner plates as I helplessly watched Chuck E. rise to his feet. Cole snatched my handgun from my grip. \n\n“Give me that. I’m going to make that bastard pay.”\n\nHe shoved Officer Jenkins the rest of the way out of the window and aimed straight for Chuck E.’s gnarled face. \n\n“See you in Hell, you ugly piece of-”\n\n*Boom.*\n\nRight between the eyes. Chuck E. let out one last agonized screech as his oversized body crumpled to the floor. It wasn’t time to celebrate yet, though. The first of the animatronics trudged through the inky black puddle that the rodent had already melted into. Jake lit his molotov cocktail.\n\n“Everybody stand back.”\n\nHe cocked his arm like a quarterback and sent it flying through the air. It shattered on the ground directly in front of the glowering mascots, sending the whole building up in flames. We stood back and watched in awe as flames licked the entire structure, black smoke billowing high into the cool night air. \n\nJake placed a meaty hand on my shoulder as we watched it burn. After everything we’d been through, there was something serene about watching that awful building crumble. \n\n“I’m really glad you decided to come with us, Jake,” I said.\n\n“So am I. We couldn’t have done it without you,” Sidney muttered, still transfixed on the blazing inferno.\n\n“I love you guys,” Jake whimpered as a tear rolled down his cheek.\n\n“Aw, bring it in,” I said, tears welling up in my own eyes. \n\nSidney and I threw our arms around Jake, and he embraced us. We stood there clasped in each others’ grip for what felt like hours, just reveling in the moment. \n\n*Crash.* \n\nWe were snapped from our reverie as the roof of the building collapsed, crumbling to the floor with a deafening bang. \n\n“Y’all had better get going. Someone’s bound to call the fire department sooner or later,” Cole said. \n\n“He’s right. We all need to hit the road before someone catches wind of this. Be safe out there. And kids… thank you.” \n\nOfficer Jenkins gave us an approving nod as he slipped into the front seat of his police cruiser. Cole made his rounds and shook each of our hands. \n\n“Really, thank you. You don’t know how big of a weight off my shoulders it is to see that place in ruins.”\n\n“We’re happy to have been able to help. Take care of yourself, Cole,” I said, turning to my friends. \n\n“We’d better find somewhere to rest. We’ll need it. We’ve got a wendigo to kill.”",

        "text": "Welcome to Uncanny Valley, Population 73.\n\nThe signs at the edges of the valley are quite large for the village it introduces, and the tall lettering is visible for quite a long way. Most locals never come closer than a few hundred feet, just close enough to read the whole sign in full. When I say locals, I mean people from outside Uncanny Valley, from the communities around it. Whoever those seventy-three people are, or were, they never leave the town, nor do we go into it.\n\nSome people from further away have, on occasion, passed through it, seeing as it does cut a fair bit off the trip around the valley, and for some reason it still appears on regional maps, but as the whole area is pretty much out in the sticks, it doesn’t happen too often. Those who just drive through, never stopping, or at least never leaving their cars, have told stories about how the place unnerved them. The few townsfolk they see just stare at them from doorways or street corners. Those who do stop and get out… Well, I’ve never heard anyone tell that story, put it that way.\n\nI suppose I lied a bit. Everyone round here knows not to go to Uncanny Valley, and *almost* no one ever does. Hardly anyone local even drives through there, unless it’s a real emergency. I certainly never had. It’s drilled into us from the cradle onwards. Don’t go to Uncanny Valley. And, with the rare exceptions of someone driving through the town, and locals going missing near the valley – a wandering drunk, an errant toddler – most everyone keeps well out of harm’s way. That kind of incident only really happens about once or twice a decade. Uncanny Valley’s never hurt anyone who didn’t go there, or didn’t stop there.\n\nWe. Don’t. Go. There.\n\nSo when I was driving home from a friend, late one November night, I don’t know how I found myself on the road there. I’ve driven from her place hundreds of times. Every time, I drive along the roads skirting the valley. Sure, I had been through once, about ten, fifteen years ago, when I was a dumb teenager trying to impress a boy, who was just a dumb teenager trying to impress a girl, both of us foolishly deciding that we’d accomplish this by being brave enough to face the fearsome town. Nothing happened to us, of course, but then again, we never stopped. I didn’t technically lie before, though, as Danny was driving. It’s still not an experience I like to recall, or talk about, but as I’m about to tell you about the second time, I guess I have to tell you about the first time first. And I have to tell somebody.\n\n \n\nWe felt it immediately, once the town came into view. There was something about it that made its strange name well-earned. As we entered the outskirts it was hard to pinpoint what it was, exactly, and that made the whole experience so much more unsettling right from the start. The dark-windowed houses seemed almost deserted, but there were kids’ toys here and there on the lawns, cars and bikes standing in driveways and garages, American flags hanging limply from poles attached to the walls of the houses. The few people standing in view at the doors leading into the houses, or standing on the driveways or lawns, all looked at us blankly. There were perhaps two or three kids in the entire town as far as I saw, also silently staring.\n\nSomehow the feeling of unease grew stronger once I saw the people. I couldn’t tell you why. There was nothing evident that should have made them feel strange, out of place, not quite right, but that is how they felt. Sure, they all watched us in silence, never stirring, apart from turning their heads to keep looking at us, but that hardly seems enough to explain how strong my uneasiness was. At least… I thought they turned their heads, but looking back I don’t think I could swear that I ever saw them move even that much.\n\nAs we were passing a couple standing beside the road, on the edge of the town square, I noticed the smell. I don’t know if it came from them, or from the square, or if it had only just now seeped in through all the little gaps of the car. It was metallic, like the smell of freshly welded steel, but also had a greasy, rank, fetid quality. It was very faint, at first, and it never quite went away, not the way some horrible smells can be filtered out by your brain after a while.\n\nThe couple were dressed in plain, unassuming clothes. They stood perhaps ten feet from us, their dark eyes locked with mine. Danny would later say that they had locked eyes with him, not me, but given the weirdness of the place, I don’t know that we couldn’t both be right. It was as I was returning their stare that I realized that they couldn’t be human. There was something about them that was off. Yet, despite my best efforts, I couldn’t say what, exactly, was wrong with them. Their eyes, though dark, seemed ordinary, as did their skin, their hair, their clothes, the shapes of their faces. The overall impression was that something was missing, or was there that shouldn’t be, or that something that was there was in the wrong place, but whatever it was, I couldn’t put my finger on it.\n\nReading this over, it sounds like we must’ve parked beside them for a few minutes, but we never even stopped. We passed them at five, maybe ten miles per hour. All of this dawned on me during the few seconds we approached and drove past them.\n\nLeaving them behind us we crossed the town square. We were close to one short side of the open, rectangular area. A couple of shops, a small church, what might pass for a municipal building, a car workshop with a pair of old-looking gas pumps. All of these buildings, and even the trees and bushes here and there along the perimeter of the square, gave me the same impression of wrongness as the couple did.\n\nNow that I felt I had understood the reason why the whole place gave me the chills, it became easier to notice it, though in reality, all I’d succeeded in doing was going from not knowing what was wrong to knowing only that *something* was wrong. Now I could tell that the whole town seemed unreal, though in what way I couldn’t, and still can’t, explain.\n\nThe same went for the buildings. Every plank of wood, every brick, seemed like it must’ve just come back to its proper place in the structure when I looked at it, and I felt that whatever parts I wasn’t looking at somehow must be careening around just outside my field of vision. At the same time not a single one of them looked quite as though it was in the right place. Not one detail about them ever seemed quite right.\n\nIt was then that I noticed the faint sound. It was almost entirely drowned out by the car engine and I don’t know how long it had been going on. It was like the sound of escaping gas, or like an only partly depressed aerosol can – a faint, but sharp, continuous hiss. It wavered in volume, and sometimes gradually transformed into the white noise between two radio channels, always changing, never stopping.\n\nThe people around us were staring intently. Their dark, unsettling eyes were fixed on us. I felt like they hated us, that we were intruding, and that if we didn’t get the hell out of there, we’d find out just how mobile they actually were. I was paralyzed by fear, however, and couldn’t even force myself to close my eyes. Tears were running down my cheeks, cheeks that ached with the effort of clenching my jaw shut. My breaths were short and shallow.\n\nI tried to will Danny into driving faster, but he continued at a crawl, probably less than five miles per hour now, even though I could tell from his white knuckles and the beads of sweat on his forehead that he was also affected. It wasn’t before we reached the end of the square that the car began picking up speed. Slowly, we reached perhaps five miles per hour, passing through rows of houses just as eerie as on the other side of town. As we passed beyond the last house, leaving the last couple of townsfolk staring at the back of the car, the speed picked up more quickly. By the time we passed the town sign, we were hurtling along at sixty, seventy, eighty.\n\n“Stop!” I cried out, my tongue and voice suddenly my own again, as we were bearing down on the T intersection where the road to the town met the road going around the valley. Danny slammed on the brakes and even pulled the handbrake. We were drifting, tires squealing like stuck pigs, my own shriek joining their choir, as we slid to a halt, the front wheels digging trenches into the verge as we nearly drove into the ditch.\n\nI don’t know if the engine stalled or if Danny turned it off, but we sat in silence for several seconds, as the dust of the gravel verge settled and the smoke from the burnt tires cleared, before either of us even dared to breathe. Raspy breaths from both of us mingled with my sobs and the throb of my beating heart. He whacked the steering wheel with his fist. I jumped, but it was as if the sudden noise somehow gave me leave to speak again.\n\n“Why didn’t you drive faster?” I asked, tears still flowing, voice breaking as if I’d been crying for hours.\n\n“What? I was fucking flooring it from the moment we reached the square,” said Danny, a frown disturbing his pale, sweaty face, dispelling, momentarily, the fear mirroring the one I felt. “It’s a wonder I didn’t hit any of those goddamn weirdos,” he added with a surprising amount of vehemence. His voice was far from collected, but the note of terror in it had an edge of anger to it that I didn’t feel myself.\n\nI said nothing about my own experience right then, too dumbfounded and in shock, still, to address the differences in our experiences. We just sat in silence, waiting for our friends, who would drive around the valley to meet us here.\n\nBy the time the others arrived, he was standing outside the car, half-leaning, half-sitting on the hood, smoking a cigarette held in trembling fingers that he fought to keep steady. I was in the passenger seat, hugging my legs, and no longer actively crying, but I still felt the moistness of the tears on my cheeks. Our friends asked about how it was, of course, but neither of us felt like talking about it. I just shook my head, refusing to answer, though Danny snapped at a friend of his who kept pestering him, and he even shoved him quite hard.\n\nI got into one of my girlfriends’ car, and during the ride back home I reassured them that Danny hadn’t done anything “untoward” while we were waiting or during the drive. In fact, nothing ever did happen between Danny and me. For my part, even the sight of him brought back the memory of that… I’m going to have to use the word, don’t I? Of that uncanny town and its eerie people. And every time my heart sank, and a rill of ice water ran down my spine. If he felt the same, he never said it, but he never approached me either.\n\nHe moved away after high school, and stayed away. Myself, I came back after college to help my parents with their hardware store, and sort of got stuck here. “Stuck” is an unkind word for it, though, and I am genuinely happy in my home town, but it was never something I planned on. Dana, my friend who I went to visit that more recent night, was one of my oldest friends, and she was one of the few to whom I told more about my experience than just the staring townsfolk. Not much more, though, because once we’d got out of there, it all seemed so silly, so impossible, especially for a teenager not yet well-read enough to have the vocabulary for the task. None of the rumors I heard that probably stemmed from things Danny had said were much more informative than mentioning staring townsfolk, so I guess he didn’t say much else either, if indeed he had experienced more at all.\n\n \n\nWhen my headlights lit up the sign that night I felt the hairs on the back of my head and neck stand up. If I’d had any sense I’d’ve stopped, made a U-turn, and left the way I came. I guess I was too tired to think or react quickly enough. The all-smothering darkness of the world beyond the headlights on an unlit road in the middle of nowhere can get to you under normal circumstances. Given where I was headed, my mouth felt dry, my hands clammy, my heart was racing and my breaths were quick. The panic never really set in, though. It lurked just under the surface, ready to break through once something actually happened. But then again, why would something happen? I’d come through the town before and survived. This line of thought grounded me enough to keep the panic at bay for a while longer, until the road clearly began showing signs of not being quite right. It was straight as an arrow, but I had to keep adjusting the steering wheel to keep from driving into the ditch.\n\nSoon I saw the garden fences on either side of the road, and hints of lighter shadows where the houses lurked, just beyond the influence of my headlights. I was actually glad that none of the houses had any lights on. Seeing more of them would have been worse than the fading memory of my previous trip. The gardens were creepy enough with their strange, formless shapes of bushes and low trees. They kept drawing my attention, for some reason, but I tried my best to keep my eyes on the road. My heart was still beating fast, its quick rhythm thumping in my head, in tune, as it were, with the sound of the engine and the faint crunch of the gravel beneath the wheels. Was the road actually covered in gravel? I tried my best not to look at what was clearly a paved road. Or clearly a dirt track. As I said, I tried not to look and tried not to think about it.\n\nThe darkness of the gardens was full of eyes. I couldn’t see them at all if I looked straight at them, of course, but I knew they were there, staring in pairs, in singles, in threes and more. I was as convinced of it as I am of the reality of the keyboard under my fingertips as I write this. Throughout the entire journey into town, I saw no living thing. I saw none of the eyed creatures who were following my every move. The fences on either side of the road were as fickle in shape and nature as everything else in the valley, but once they disappeared I almost wished they had stayed. Ephemeral though they were, they were still a barrier between the car and the eyes. Once I entered the town square, I left the dark shadows of the houses and their adjoining gardens behind, and the absolute blackness crowded closer again. The black, unseen eyes crowded closer, in their ever-shifting groups, just out of sight. Their bearers were unaffected by the light reflected from the ground, and yet I knew that they were in front of me as well as behind me, watching, waiting, always moving to stay out of the light.\n\nThe car stopped. I don’t mean that the engine cut out and the car slowed to a halt, and not that it was abrupt, as if hitting an obstacle. It simply stopped moving forward. There was a small jolt of motion, probably far less than I ought to have expected, given the speed I was going at, but the road outside became motionless. I kept pushing down on the accelerator, feeling the car vibrate as if it was still moving, still accelerating, but the twin cones of light showed the same, cracked concrete. It was surprisingly persistent, I realize, looking back, but at the time I was more preoccupied with my mounting panic attack. I felt faint, my chest tightened, and a thin, wordless wail began rising from my throat. I began to sob, begging the car to start moving. The strange metallic smell began entering the car, and in the silence the faint hiss was creeping into my ears. Both were growing stronger by the second. My eyes were tearing up as I sobbed and struck the steering wheel several times. Then I saw…\n\n…it.\n\nAhead of me, on the edge of the headlights’ reach, beyond the cone of light projected onto the ground, the darkness had a shape. Moment by moment it grew clearer, as it entered the light. I say entered, but it was not moving, not in any normal sense of the word. Nonetheless the man, now more a dark gray shadow than black, crept closer, standing upright in front of my car, his eyes fixed on me. No, it wasn’t a man that grew more distinct the closer to the lights it moved. The woman’s eyes were fixed on me. No, I had been mistaken, it was clearly a man. A boy? A young woman? It was becoming brighter, but wasn’t it still almost entirely black, as if unlit by the headlights? Wasn’t it already so reflective it made my eyes burn? Wasn’t it both? Neither?\n\nThe impression was changing so rapidly now, becoming so muddled that my brain couldn’t keep up, yet I couldn’t look away, out of sheer terror. I couldn’t bear the thought of what would happen if I looked away. Oh, God, what if I blinked? My heart was pounding in my chest, and pain surged through my head with each heartbeat. I mustn’t look away.\n\nIn an instant that lasted an infinity, the thing – it can’t have been human – closed the distance. The one unchanging feature in that cascade of unseen faces was the pair of dark eyes, bottomless pits so black that the darkness around me faded to gray. Not that I saw much else than those eyes by now, anyway. I was transfixed like a hypnotized victim in a bad vampire movie.\n\nThe thing moved. It raised its arm, now a thick, burly laborer’s arm, now a child’s, now an elderly woman’s, now… something different. It reached through the intervening space, which felt like a mere mile one second, and an impossibly untraversable inch the next. It reached through the car windscreen, piercing it without shattering it. The metallic stench grew instantly putrid, to all appearances mixed with toxic fumes. The hissing sound grew from a whisper to a roar, accompanied by a shrill, ear-rending note.\n\nIt put its icy fingers against my skin, passing through my clothes as though they were nothing more than mist.  It felt like being stabbed by sharp spikes dipped in liquid nitrogen. The burning cold spread from my chest, and the pain at last made me scream, scream louder than I have ever done. Still I could not move. The cold continued to spread, down my chest, around to my back, up my neck. The pain made me lose my grip on reality, such as it was, and through the haze of it I wondered whose shriek I heard, whose ears were savaged by that roaring, shrill chord, whose nose and lungs were being assaulted by that fetid odor of sharp, burning metal and a mixture of noxious chemicals and decay that would have made me retch at any other time. The cold crept down along my hip and thighs, and up through my shoulders and into my arms, spreading like roots through my torso and limbs. It slid up my neck, over my scalp, down my gullet and down through my feet. As if it had forgotten it until now, it then bit at my heart.\n\nThe darkness that followed was the wholesome oblivion of unconsciousness. I don’t know how long it lasted. I may have recollections of seeing the starlit sky and weeping with relief at having escaped, but that may have been a dream that came later. I do not recall being found in my car, in the ditch opposite the road to Uncanny Valley, dangerously hypothermic and unresponsive. I don’t recall being rushed to the hospital, or what they did to me once I got there, though I’m told I grew panicked almost as soon as I came back to consciousness, raving confusedly about “It’s inside” and “It’s gone through” amidst cries for help. I don’t remember those moments. Later that day I was more lucid, and that’s where my memory picks up, with my mom and dad crying tears of relief at my side. There’s a mark on my chest, at the middle of the sternum. Five reddish spots in a circle maybe three inches across, that the doctors said looked like the beginning of frostbite. If they were the points of a pentagram, it would be inverted.\n\nAfter a day or so I was able to have visitors other than next of kin, and Dana was full of tears over having been the reason I was even in the neighborhood of the road through Uncanny Valley. I did my best to assure her that she wasn’t responsible in the slightest, but I think she still blames herself.\n\nMy recovery has been slow. Mom insisted I move back in for the duration, so I’m back in my old room. I suffer from aches in most joints, making it pretty much impossible to help out at the store. The doctors haven’t been able to pinpoint the reason why yet. In addition to that pain making it difficult to fall asleep, I have nightmares about the event almost every night. It’s always confused, and the details change and are quickly forgotten, but at their core is always that dark, staring, freezing cold thing. Mostly I manage to shrug off the memory of the dreams over the course of the day, but the terror at the time is exhausting, and I usually cry myself into fatigued, dreamless sleep in the small hours. During the days I’m tired, and most days I just shuffle through the chores Mom allows me to do, to at least give some sort of structure to my days. She wants me to rest, but I was getting stir crazy once I was well enough to do more than just sit around and think. After the chores are done I mostly lie around on the sofa downstairs, watching garbage on the TV, or lie in bed in my room upstairs, scrolling through garbage on my phone.\n\nAbout five or six weeks passed, and other than my nightmares and my aching joints, I didn’t seem to suffer any lasting problems. I was even starting to feel like I was getting better physically, though I was still constantly mentally exhausted. The dreams were getting slightly less frequent, at least with regards to my being wakened by them, though my nights were still far from as restful as before.\n\nThen the nausea began. After a few mornings of vomiting I realized that I had missed my period. Twice. A cold knot lodged itself in my gut once I realized that. It remained there as I went to the pharmacy, driving my car for the first time since that night. The windscreen was as pristine and unbroken as it had ever been.\n\nI felt numb as I picked out one of the tests. I felt sick to my stomach as I waited in line, oblivious to my surroundings. I didn’t really hear what the woman behind the counter said as I paid by card. My mouth was dry as I stepped out into the pale, gray afternoon chill.\n\nThe uncertainty broke me, and I went across the street to a diner opposite the pharmacy and used the bathroom there. As I waited for the result to show up, the night in the Valley returned to me in full force, though all jumbled together, with flashes of memories of the time in college when I’d had a pregnancy scare when the condom broke. It had been the worst anxiety I’d ever felt up to that point. Now it seemed almost insignificant, both through the passage of time and through the greater ordeal my drive through the valley had been.\n\nThat time the result had been negative. This time it wasn’t. That time I’d had sex within the time frame that would’ve made a positive result possible. This time I hadn’t. I tried another strip from the packet. Positive. The third one was also positive.\n\nI left the bathroom with an even lighter head than I had gone into it with. I focused on the exit and on reaching it without falling, which was difficult given how the whole room was spinning. At the time I didn’t really register anything that was being said around me, but somehow the conversation between two guests at the counter suddenly penetrated the fog of my mind just as I reached for the door handle.\n\n“Did you hear? The sign’s changed.”\n\n“Changed?”\n\n“Yeah. Drove past it myself yesterday. Now it says ‘Welcome to Uncanny Valley, Population 72.’”\n\nAll of a sudden, my stomach didn’t feel quite…\n\n…right.",

Hi.” His voice follows a bang as he swings the door open unannounced\nHe is a tall, maybe seven feet, leaning down to enter through the doorway, head brushing the ceiling upon entry by a wispy gray hair, spindly man. He is blind. His skin is white except for brown liver spots. A short but obese white dachshund with the same spotting scampers in behind him. \nIt looks like a slab of skin has been placed over his eyes. Perhaps they never developed in the first place.\n\n“Hi.” Is all you can manage. You freeze.\n\nThe dog is face level to you in the bathtub. It comes up to your face while wagging its tail. You can see that it’s also blind in the same way. It smells you and bobs its head as it bumps its wet nose along the outline of your arm.\n\nIt nudges your lips. You open your mouth, and it puts its snout inside. \nIt darts its way in, shoving itself in, which gapes your mouth further. A small cry dies in your throat as you fear any little noise will set it off. Its tail wags harder, causing its body to sway as its wrinkly nose pokes the inside of your cheek. You freeze as the snout reaches the back of your throat, and its nose bumps your amygdala. Even while your mouth is unhinged, the base of its snout drags against your teeth, sprinkling microscopic hairs in your mouth that collect in pools of your saliva. You can hear low grumbles from its stomach as it wheezes in pleasure. Hn-hn-hn. You know that over that, It can hear you breathing. \nYou wonder what will happen now? Will it keep digging down your throat until it’s satisfied?\n\nIt relinquishes its snout from your mouth but continues smelling you, bumping its saliva slicken snout along the side of your face. Common sense tells you that you should open your eyes and analyze the scene. You refuse.\nIt bumps the wrinkles of your tightly closed eyes and pauses. Its body stops swaying because you can no longer hear the rhythmic scratching of its elongated nails on the floor.\nIt licks your eyelid. It wants to open it.\nThe man bellows. “Stop it, Hungry.”\n\n——\n\nA/N: Hey, I had a horrific nightmare and sleep paralysis experience where I woke up at 1am and stayed in bed for 30 minutes too scared to move until I wrote this down. And I was told not to edit so as to not take away from the original, so I’ll give some context now. This nightmare takes place at a family reunion in which I meet distant and fictional family members. “Laurie” is my grandma, and everyone there is supernaturally old and mistakes me for her. I’m taking a shower but sitting in the bathtub when this man walks in.\n\nAs for why I wrote this at all, I am a college student majoring in English, who was terrified and wanted to capture the raw emotion through the small details that made the overall scene unnerving. Also, I never remember my dreams, but this one was super vivid! I could (figuratively) feel my jaw lock up and hear the nails rhythmically scratching on the tiled floor.\n\nWell, I hope you find this just as disturbing as I did. I desperately want to post this to the dream interpretation subreddit, but I also don’t want to know what this says about me, haha. Cheers.",

From you guys, the werewolves, and my friends. Imagine how weird it would be if your friend suddenly knew how to battle the monsters that were holding you captive, the legit way and not based on some fairytale mumbo-jumbo. Back in that police station was not the right time for “The Talk” especially after Beck was turned. That’s why in the interrogation room I stabbed Beck in the back with the wooden leg chair- it was effective enough to neutralize him so Jess and I had enough time to escape, but it didn’t kill him. I already knew all about the holy water, and silver and sun allergies before any of this happened. The only real way to kill a vampire is by decapitation with a sharp silver object. Hence the specially made machete in my hands.\n\nLook I’m sorry I’ve been a bit of a liar and an unreliable storyteller, but from now on I promise I’ll tell you guys the truth from now on, but you got to admit, I’m a pretty good actor.\n\nOnce I had figured out we’d accidentally stumbled upon the vampires it didn’t take long for the puzzle pieces to fit together about the missing people. Marcy’s testimony about killing the other council members for their greed just confirmed my theory. The first thing I did was tell Benny that I found the monsters responsible for missing people, or rather they found me. It was a brief and vague text, but it was enough information for him to know I was safe. I had been on a few hunts before with Benny and some other hunters, and figured I could handle a pair of vamps. Plans changed when the bastards got Beck, and after that my main priorities were getting Jess out of there alive, and human. Look how well that turned out for us, now it seems I’ve got myself in quite the predicament. I should probably google: How to convince my hunting mentor that I’m still human?\n\nGod I was so adamant about staying human back then, when in reality all I ever needed was this power flowing through my veins. Now all I want is for my friends and I to be free and stay safe. To do that my hunting days needed to come to an end, and so did Benny.\n\n“What are you doing with the vamps, kid? You’ve been pretty radio silent these past few days too. You haven’t been turned have ya?” Ben asked, eyeing me up and down. I snuck a glance behind me to find a very pissed Bailey and confused Beck and Jess.\n\n“No.” I answered confidently. “These bloodsucking shit stains infiltrated the police. We just so happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and this chucklehead and his partner over here pulled us over and abducted us. They turned them and kept me alive as a blood bag.”\n\nHey I said I was telling you guys the truth, not Benny (technically it was the truth, but more of a half truth than full truth).\n\n“So you won’t mind if I-?” Benny said, readying his machete.\n\nI held my palm out for him to slice with the machete. “I understand man, gotta do what you gotta do.”\n\nMy breath hitched in my throat as he dragged the jagged blades edge across my skin, tearing it open. When blood poured out Benny’s body eased. When my wound kept bleeding and hadn’t healed instantly he gave me a spare piece of cloth out of his pocket to wrap around my hand.\n\n“Okay then.” He said, reassured. They knew well enough to hide it, but the peanut gallery was gob-smacked.\n\nWell that was quite the neat little trick there, huh? I guess that’s one of the perks to being a hybrid. I somehow just knew if I told my body what to do, it would react the way I wanted it to. \n\n“Take care of them would ya?” Benny asked motioning behind me as I wrapped up my hand.\n\nFinally the opportunity had presented itself.\n\nMy non-injured hand gripped the handle of the machete tightly as a devilish grin found its way on my face. It was finally time to get some revenge. “Gladly.”\n\nI quickly spun around and my sights immediately went to the fat lard, seedy looking, poor excuse for a vampire. Bailey’s eyes widened with terror as he realized his fate.\n\nI swung, but he used his vampiric speed to dodge, the machete cutting into his forearm instead. “Hey, wait, we can talk about this!” He pleaded as he steadied himself again. He pushed Beck and Jess harshly out of his way to gain more distance from me and my lethal weapon. \n\n“What’s the matter officer? Scared of a little discipline?” I twirled the machete in my hand. I was definitely going to enjoy decapitating this prick.\n\n“Please, you probably don’t even know how to use that thing!” He said back, cockily. His life was about to end and he was still being a dickwad? Where did this sudden edge come from, wasn’t he just begging a second ago? The balls on this vamp.\n\n“Oh really, wanna find out then?” \n\nBailey’s eyes illuminated red as he bared his fangs and hissed at me. He looked to the motel door and made a run for it. “Fuck this shit, I’m out of here.”\n\nBailey was at the door in a second, but Jess and Beck had used their speed to flank him.\n\n“And where do you think you’re going?” Beck asked as he crossed his arms.\n\n“Move! I am your elder and you will do as I command!” Bailey yelled as I took a step ever so closer, readying my weapon.\n\n“What you are is a coward!” Jessica spat.\n\n“And the bastard that did this to us!” Beck added in.\n\nBailey tried to push them but they wouldn’t budge. He reeked of desperation. I loved it.\n\nHe turned around, quaking in his boots as he stared up at me in terror. “Please!” He begged. “I’m sorry! I’m so sorry! Please don’t kill me, I'll do whatever you want!” \n\nI stifled a laugh as he got on his knees and began praying to me. This all was giving me a much needed rush of serotonin. I was beginning to find I liked it when they begged. \n\nMy eyebrow rose as I began to ponder,“Whatever I want?”\n\n“Yes, whatever you want! Just spare me!” He started to look relieved as I entertained his idea.\n\nI looked to Jess and Beck who were giving me this “Dude, you seriously aren’t considered this?” Look.\n\nI chuckled before saying with finality, “What I want Officer Bailey… is for you to die.”\n\nHis eyes fell open in shock as I swung the blade down upon his neck. In one fluid motion his head went flying as his limp body fell to the floor, where it landed right next to Bradshaw’s. How cute. How fitting.\n\nI let out a deep sigh as content filled me. I felt a million times better knowing that that piece of scum could never hurt anybody ever again.\n\nBeck let out a breathless laugh as Jess cheered in excitement. They were just as happy to see Bailey dead as I was.\n\n“What are you doing Danny?” Ben asked from behind me. I turned around to look at him.\n\n“What?”\n\n“Finish them off.” He motioned to my best friend and girlfriend.\n\n“Ben, they *just* helped us! What are you talking about?”\n\n“Yeah dude, what the fuck?” Beck chimed in.\n\n“Listen Danman, I know they were your friends, but that’s not them anymore. They need to die.” Benny said as he put his hand firmly on my shoulder, giving me this pitying look. “It has to be done.”\n\nMarcy suddenly started cracking up in her chair. “Well god damn! Isn’t this more interesting than what’s playing on the tv?!” She pointed her clawed finger at the old television set playing a cheesy and random telenovela.\n\n“Shut it, whore!” Benny yelled behind him as he flung his machete with great force. It narrowly missed her neck and instead landed in the wall, wobbling a bit. \n\nMarcy kept her composure. If that freaked her out, she sure didn’t show it. “Well now, I do have a high body count, but that’s just no way to speak to a lady.”\n\nBen scoffed. “Lady? You ain’t no lady. What ya’ are is a blood sucking bottom feeder.” \n\nWhile Ben and Marcy got into a pissing match, I took the opportunity to take some silver handcuffs out of Benny’s duffle bag.\n\n“What are you doing?” Beck whispered as I gently grabbed his wrists.\n\n“Do you trust me?” \n\n“What of course we do, but Danny what the hell is going on?” Jess whispered as she eyed my mentor.\n\n“I-it’s a lot and hard to explain. Just- do you trust me?” \n\nThey both nodded their heads and I nodded mine back. I cuffed Beck and Jess and had them sit down on the clean bed without a decapitated vampire corpse on it.\n\nBen took notice of what I was doing. “Danny, what in the Sam hell are you doing? I told you to kill them.”\n\n“They aren’t a threat to us right now. Besides, they're restrained, they won’t be able to do anything to us.”\n\n“Unless they show us their pretty little fangs and try to rip out our throats!”\n\n“Ok then, well  here.” I grabbed a pair of pliers out from his duffle bag and pushed Beck down on his back. Instinctually he bared his fangs and hissed. I used the pliers and pulled his fangs out while he wailed in pain and shock.\n\n“It’s okay they’ll grow back.” I whispered into his ear.\n\nAfter I was done with Beck I moved onto Jess. I made sure I was as gentle as possible with my girlfriend's fangs, but I had to sell it for Ben to believe me.\n\nWith two pairs of vampire fangs in my palm I shoved it into Ben’s face. “Now they really can’t hurt us and we’ve just scored some extra cash. Happy?”\n\n“Tch. Whatever Danny. They can live for now.”\n\n“Awww! Well, isn't that sweet?” Marcy said, clicking her tongue. \n\nBen walked over to the wall and pulled his machete out and steadied himself, clearly annoyed. “Start talking, Sire. You’re going to tell me everything I want to know.”\n\nMarcy hissed, eyes glowing red and fangs coming out to play. “More will come looking for me.This operation is bigger than you think. You’re toast.”\n\n“Bullshit. You’re bluffing.”\n\n“How do you know?”\n\n“Because you killed off your entire counsel. It’s just you now and you know it. You’re all alone now sweetheart.”\n\n“You tattled on me?!?” Marcy yelled in my direction, appalled.\n\n“You made me your personal plaything! What else did you expect? My undying loyalty? As a blood bag?” I added that last part in haphazardly.\n\n“Yes!”\n\nBenny then bitch slapped Marcy and grabbed her cheeks, making her lips pucker like a fish. “Stop acting so childish! I want to know where the rest of your nest is! I know more than half the missing people weren’t there at the raid, so where are they?!”\n\n“Thewe in thwe Bahwamwas.”\n\n“What?!” Benny let go of her face.\n\n“I said,” she licked some saliva that fell out of her mouth with her tongue,” their in the Bahamas. Sipping Mai Tai’s and getting their tan on.”\n\n“Listen, I don’t have time for games. Tell me where the rest of your nest is!”\n\n“So what? You can kill me?!? No thanks.” \n\n“You’re going to die anyway, so just give it up already! The jig is up. You lost.” Ben yelled, starting to lose his cool. \n\n“Did I? It seems you have more to lose than I do judging by your reaction. Now sweetie, why don’t you untie me so I can make your death quick and painless. Or maybe not. I mean you did just kill half my children. Revenge is a dish best served covered in blood, you know?”\n\n“Fine then, Marceline.” Ben sighed defeated as he plopped on the other twin bed behind where Marcy was restrained. \n\nMarcy eyebrows rose as she was called by her full first name. She looked intrigued, but mostly smug. \n\nSuddenly Benny shot up off the bed, machete in hand. It was so quick and sudden that it startled me too. “If you won’t bring us to them, I’ll just bring them to us.” A loud squelch rang out from the room as his blade cut through skin and bone. The first hit didn’t take quite well and Benny had to remove the machete before he hammered it back into Marcy’s neck where it fell off and rolled to the floor. Comically, a final dramatic sting played from the television as the telenovela ended.\n\nI took a step back as I fully processed the view in front of me. Marcy’s shocked dead eyes stared deeply into my soul. She was a bitch don’t get me wrong, but all Marcy was trying to do was survive. I mean she killed her counsel because they took more than what they needed. She died trying to protect her nest. I’ll give her respect for that.\n\nI took a step back as Benny wiped his machete clean with a cloth before tossing it back into his duffel. I tossed him mine and he did the same. \n\nI turned around to face Beck and Jessica as I put my hands to my hips taking in the carnage in the hotel room. Benny had taken out these vamps, except for Bailey, and now I had to figure out a way to take him out. Maybe it didn’t have to end this way though, if I could just figure out a way… I’m really not trying to be a monster. It’s not like I want to kill the guy, he’s actually pretty decent and a good friend to me, but that’s the problem. I *know* him. His ideals, his history. He’s not the type of hunter to let his prey go. I wasn’t going to be either, so I understand him. But I just want to live. *Survive*.\n\nI snapped out of my thoughts. Ben was probably going to make me clean up the bodies and hotel room so nobody got suspicious about what just went down here. Just like I’ve done after every job since becoming a rookie hunter. \n\n“So, Benny, where do you want me to-“ a sudden chill crawled down my spine as my body went tense. Something was off, but I couldn’t put my finger on what.\n\nI noticed Jessica’s expression first then Beck’s. They were wide eyed and terrified. Jess’s voice caught in her throat as she brought her hand to her mouth, tears starting to leave her eyes. She was too stunned to say anything.\n\n“Danny, look out!” Beck shouted, trying to warn me, but it was too late.\n\nThe loud bang of a gun going off sounded from behind me as I started to turn behind me. It wasn’t long after that a bullet pierced the back of my skull. I felt liquid drip down my face as my brain got all fuzzy. My eyesight started to go dark as a sharp burning pain radiated from the back of my head.\n\nI had been shot.\n\n***\n\nI woke up on the musty floor of the motel room with a pounding headache. I rubbed the back of my head as I picked myself up off the floor. I had face planted on the ground. After wiping away the stray strands of drool off my face, I looked around to find an empty room. The vampire bodies were gone and so were Benny, Beck, and Jessica. God, my  head was buzzing.\n\nI quickly found the source, it was my cell phone. I’m guessing the incessant buzzing is what woke me up. A little bit dazed, I answered the phone, not bothering to check the caller I.D.\n\n“Tell me something Danny,” Benny’s hoarse voice rang out,” do you think I’m an idiot?”",

        "text": "  I was stunned sitting there on my couch at 3 am in the morning. I was having one of those many restless nights so I turned on the t.v and to my surprise there on the screen was a new channel. \n\n\n  ARP - Alternative Reality Program\n\n\n What the hell? Where did this come from? Usually there are only TNT and TBS. (The ones I usually watch). Now sitting smack dab in the middle was this. ARP. \n\n\n For the programs that are listed it just has one show. Your life. Confusing title but it grabs your attention. As for the new channel I thought it was just that. A new channel. One that I will probably receive a email on it later.\n\n\n I clicked on the program then I heard a door creak in one of the rooms upstairs. I thought nothing of it. Just thinking that it was just a coincidence. I watched the new program with the new show and was opened up with a memory that I knew real well. \n\n\n What the hell? I thought as a memory plays of me as a young boy swinging. How is this possible? I hear myself laugh as my father pushed me up and down. \n\n\n How is this possible? This is my memory! I grab the remote to change the channel not before something metal hit the upside of my head. Immediately I went down while not getting a look at the person who done it. \n\n\n I hear footsteps along with the ringing in my ears as the perpetrator rummaged through my house and went out the front door. He must have left it open. It is getting chilly in here. I try to get up for help but everytime I move I make a noise because of the pain. A line of blood going down my forehead. \n\n\n I'm going to die here! I thought. I'm going to die at the exact time no one is moving around outside unless they are a restless sleeper like me. The only direction my head was looking towards was the t.v. that somehow was playing my memory of that day on the swings at the old park. \n\n\n Then the program changed to another one of my memories. This time to me at my first dance. I was dancing with Shirley Templeson. Something is wrong here though. I looked happy there but I didn't really looked happy at that dance. Whenever I asked her to go with me she laughed and all her friends laughed with her as I hung my down the hallway.\n\n\n Yeah, that's what happened. The whole time at the dance I was just sitting there with my friends watching all the couples move around. Is this thing showing me what could have happened? \n\n\n I heard of people saying that before you die you are shown your whole life over again. Maybe this is the other way around. I'm being shown what could have happened had my choices been different. Unless other people were also shown this and they want to make the last few seconds before death seem like a happy one to console people. \n\n\n I mean I would. I wouldn't tell my future kids if I have any at all when I turn 40 that death just shows you if the choices you made were the right ones. I am then shown another memory or another alternate choice, of me with my not dead dad getting out of the hospital with all our friends cheering. \n\n\n This one made me tear up a bit. I was 19 when my dad died of cancer. I wanted him to pull out of it. It was because I loved him but it was also because I wouldn't have anyone left since my mother died while giving birth to me. \n\n\n But that never happen did it George? Your father died with a smile as you cried your tears flying onto his cold hands. Since then I've had to make do on my own the way I know how. My dad didn't leave me woth nothing to prepare myself for. He left me our house and a stable job at advance auto. \n\n\n I was glad of him for it. I stayed there and helped people. It was where i met my now girlfriend Carrie. Carrie! I think. If i died now i would be doing what i did with dad to her! I need to pull through for her! \n\n\n I then try to move again as more memories played out on the t.v. My hand it moved! I try to pull my hand onto the armleg of the chair. I was able to pull myself up on it with more blood going down. I'm losing a lot. I then grab my phone on the nightstand. \n\n\n I call 911 and told the dispatcher that someone broke into my house and that he hit me. The way i was actually saying it was one word was missing for every third word. It actually went like this. Some broke into house got head. She must've known I was in distress so she sent the cops. \n\n\n After I was taken to the hospital and me and Carrie were laughing together that I was ok. I went and asked the cops if there was anything out of the ordinary in my house. They said when they came in they saw the blood splatter on the walls and the metal pipe on the porch. My heart froze when they told me that the t.v was just blank when I asked them if it was still on when they found me.\n\n ",

        "text": "  \n\nMy boyfriend, Ralph, and I often go into nature when we want to get away from everything. When we met, I was an avid hiker, and he was a zip line instructor. \n\nIt had been a couple of years since our daughter was born and we *finally* decided to use my January birthday as an excuse to take a step back and visit nature during a time it wasn’t likely to be busy. Neither of us minded winter hiking and relished the thought of being snowed in together. \n\nSo, we packed up and headed to Tygart Lake, West Virginia. We spent the small bit of time prior to check in playing around the half-frozen lake and running to Walmart for snacks, cheap beer, and playing cards before the incoming snow prevented us from doing so. \n\nThe snow had just begun to come down in big soft clumps, as we made our way back to the lodge. I exchanged a glance with him, both of us beginning to grin like school children. Knowing it was only a matter of time before we would have a sleepy blanket of white to play in. \n\nWe carried in the things we bought and began to put them away while I texted back and forth with my mom about the weather. Knowing that our daughter was safe and sound sipping cocoa at grandmas made me all the more excited to enjoy the opportunity to explore. Once the beers were chilling and the snacks had found their way to the table, we headed to the small restaurant in the lodge. I picked us a table next to giant windows overlooking the lake so we could watch the snowfall at sunset with our dinner. \n\n“We should go for a walk after this.” I gesture outside with a French fry. \n\nRalph leans back dramatically and pats his stomach, “Ok, but I am taking a beer with me.” \n\nWe pay for our food and take the leftovers back to the room. Savoring every second of quiet. Each of us grabbed some warmer layers. Ralph comes up behind me and slides a beer into my hand, kissing my fingers. *Ding!* My phone went off in my pocket. A text from mom with a picture of our sleeping child. It was so nice to know that she had a full and relaxing day as well. I realized I was just standing there, smiling at my phone and turned to show him the picture. He’s no longer behind me. I look to the door and see him just beyond the threshold, looking toward the road. Confused, I threw my phone back into my pocket and followed him out the door. \n\nThe snow had forced a pocket of stillness over the area. Stepping outside was like stepping into a void. The parking lot and surrounding area were pitch black. So quiet, all you could hear was our boots crunching on the fresh snow. \n\nMaking our way down the road, he comments quietly how the snowfall has made everything eerily quiet. *Ding!* We both chuckle at the irony of the obnoxious noise. But his laugh sounds…forced. \n\nI pull my phone from my pocket and notice it’s just the alert for the battery. I show Ralph the alert, illuminating his smiling face with my phone screen. \n\nBut as I pull the phone away, I feel my heart jump to my throat. There was something wrong with his face. He was looking past me, his smile feigned and lifeless. I tried to swallow my panic, stretching my hands over my head and yawning. What was wrong with him? \n\nHe put his hands in his pockets stiffly and began to walk in the direction we had been. Away from the lodge. My heart started pounding as the darkness of the woods that lingered just passed the shoulder of the road started to feel suffocating. \n\n“Hey, let’s head back. It’s way colder out than I thought.” I take a tentative step backwards to the building. \n\n“No.” his voice was firm and threatening. Nothing like I had grown accustomed to. My golden retriever gamer boy turned…gruff. \n\nI tried to make my voice as playful as possible, “Well you can freeze on your own then.” With every ounce of courage that I had; I turned my back on him. Making determined steps toward the lodge.  \n\n*Ding!* I felt his eyes on me. I could hear the slow footsteps following casually behind me. \n\nMy phone. Id forgotten my dying phone. Maybe I could casually call my mom on the way back. Maybe I was overreacting and just feeling freaked out by the darkness and quiet. But his face, his smile seemed as though it was slipping down. His eyes had…pinpoints for pupils. I could feel “him” roughly ten feet behind me. Every step sending pin prickles all over my body.\n\nI pulled out my phone and what was on the screen sent a chill to my core. \n\nA text from Ralph, “Where did you go? I go to the bathroom, and you just ditch me in the room? :p “ \n\nI stared at the phone, feeling my dinner threatening to make a return appearance. Willing my feet to move faster than this casual walk. To run. I could still feel it looking at me. That’s when I heard the footsteps behind me break into a sprint.",

        "text": "Okay, so a lot has happened in the past few months.\n\nAfter I got the call, I rushed to the hospital so Jay can have someone with them in case they don't make it.\n\nI saw Jay in their bed, looking scared and upset. I couldn't blame them. Combined with the whole weird tree thing and potentially dying from a tree bone can stress anyone out.\n\nJay saw me and looked relieved to have a familiar face.\n\n\"Tom! Am I glad to see you!\" \n\n\"Yeah, I'm sure you could use a friend.\" \n\nI sat next to them and held their hand.\n\nI attempted to comfort them and take their mind off of it all by talking to them about their favorite flowers.\n\nAs we talked, the same government guys came in. One was a thin, dark haired who looked to be about 60. The other was a bit overweight, blonde, and younger.\n\nThe dark haired looked at us. \"So, I'm sure you all have questions?\"\n\nI stood up. \"Of fucking course I do, my friend is fucking dying!\"\n\nThe blond placed his hands on my shoulders. \"Calm down. They just need the bone sprout removed and an injection we made for this specific infection.\"\n\nI took deep breaths and sat down. \"I'm sorry, I am just really stressed.\"\n\nThe blonde placed a sympathetic hand on my shoulder. \"I don't blame you. Anyone would be stressed in your position.\"\n\nJay started coughing into a napkin, I could see blood staining it like ketchup.\n\n\"Jay!\" I attempted to go over and comfort them.\n\nThe dark haired one stopped me. \"Not now. Their blood is not safe. You need an injection before you can go near them in this state.\"\n\nThe blonde took out a syringe and jabbed it in my arm.\n\n\"Ow! What the fuck!?\" I yelped.\n\n\"Okay, now you're good.\" The blonde said before putting a bandaid on my injection wound.\n\nJay stopped coughing and threw the napkin away.\n\nI walked over and rubbed their shoulder. \"Do you need anything, Jay?\"\n\n\"I could use some water.\" \n\nThe blonde left to get Jay some water.\n\nI looked at the dark haired one. \"What's wrong with my friend? How did they end up like this?\"\n\nThe dark haired one sat me down. \"Well, the blood inside the tree can be infectious if it ends up inside you either through open wounds or orally. Did Jay have an open wound or end up with it in their mouth somehow?\"\n\nI looked at Jay.\n\nJay thought about it. \"I do remember a metallic taste in my mouth after I licked my lips after you dropped the leaf.\"\n\nI felt my blood run cold. \"Dude, I am so sorry.\"\n\n\"Tom, it was an accident. How were you supposed to know the tree was going to do that?\"\n\n\"Jay, you are sick because of me!\"\n\nThe blonde came back and gave Jay their water.\n\nJay sipped their water. \"Tom, it'll be okay. They said that I can be saved.\"\n\nI took deep breaths. \"Okay.\"\n\nI looked at the agents. \"What is up with this tree?\"\n\nThe agents looked at each other and then back at us. \n\nThe dark haired one cleared his throat.\n\n\"Well, you aren't the only ones who have dealt with what we call 'blood trees'. We caught wind of the first few instances months ago after a meteor landed. We didn't pay it any mind until people in the area went missing and the trees kept popping up.\n\nWe discovered pretty much the same things you did. It took some time to figure out how to save people from being assimilated or becoming another blood tree, and that does include a surgery and the aforementioned injection.\n\nAs for how to get rid of the trees, you got that part right. Incinerating the trees has been proven to have a 80% success rate, but destroying it from the inside and then burning it has had a 100% success rate.\"\n\nI nodded along. A doctor eventually came by to announce that Jay will have surgery the next day.\n\nI went home. I could barely sleep because I was scared for Jay and I didn't know what to do with the information given. \n\nSometimes I look out into that area where we burned the blood tree and see the charred grass and dirt where the tree once stood. I kept the beer bottle we shared as a way to commemorate our victory.\n\nI never admitted this, but I always loved Jay. Not just as a friend. I've been wanting to ask Jay out for a while, but never had the courage. And I feel guilty because I have no idea if they are going to be okay and never get the chance to tell them how I feel.\n\nI turned on the TV to help myself relax. After hours, I got a call on my phone.\n\nIt was from Jay. \n\n\"Hey, Tom. I'm about to go into surgery soon. Just calling to let you know. Hope you're okay.\"\n\n\"I'm alright, just worried. It's all a lot.\" I sigh.\n\n\"Don't worry, the men in black said I'll be okay. The only downside is that I might have breathing problems that aren't lethal but would make my life a bit harder.\"\n\n\"Yeah. I imagine having a splintery bone in your lung would do that. If you need someone to help you, I have your back.\" I said.\n\n\"Thanks, Tom. See you later.\"\n\nWe said our goodbyes and I went back to bed.\n\nI was woken up immediately after I heard screaming next door. I looked outside and gasped.\n\nAnother blood tree was in the backyard of my neighbor. I grabbed my gun and ran to her house.\n\nMy neighbor, an elderly lady, was about to be dragged inside the tree. I shot at the vine and it released her.\n\nI helped her back inside and on the couch. \n\n\"Are you hurt, Ms Crowly?\" I asked.\n\nMs Crowly was taking deep breaths.\n\n\"I think so. What the hell is that?\"\n\n\"We need to destroy it. Do you have a gas tank?\"\n\nMs Crowly nodded and pointed to the garage.\n\nI grabbed it and tossed it into the yard. The vine grabbed it and dragged it back inside. I shot at the tank and the tree exploded with an ungodly screech and it went up in flames.\n\nMs Crowly thanked me and I went home.\n\nThe next morning I went to the hospital and sat in the waiting room. I was nervous, but I hope Jay was okay.\n\nAfter what felt like days, the nurse let me know that Jay's surgery was successful.\n\nI was allowed in their room and saw Jay hooked up to a few ivs and machines. I sat next to them.\n\n\"How are you feeling, Jay?\"\n\nJay gave a weak thumbs up before letting it drop. I held their hand.\n\n\"So, quite an odd few months, eh?\"\n\n\"Yeah. If I ever write an autobiography, it's gonna be wild.\" Jay laughed.\n\nI smiled. \"Jay, can I tell you something?\"\n\nJay nodded.\n\n\"Jay, I always liked you. Like, as more than a friend. I was always scared to tell you, and I wasn't sure if you were gonna be okay. So, I just want to let you know how I feel in case you didn't make it.\"\n\nJay grinned. \"I'll be honest, I always liked you the same way. The reason I never told you was because, well, I wasn't sure if we would be, y'know, compatible. I was just scared of telling you because I thought you wouldn't like me that way.\"\n\n\"I mean. You're hot and smart. Of course I do!\" \n\nJay's green eyes lit up. \n\n\"So, after you recover, where do you want to go as my partner?\"\n\nJay thought about it. \"I kinda want to avoid botanical gardens for a bit.\"\n\nWe both chuckled. \n\nAfter a few months, Jay recovered but like they mentioned, they now have some issues with their breathing. I started to care for them by getting their medicine and some equipment meant to help them breathe better.\n\nWe live together now and we started tracking blood trees remotely and alerting the government of their location.\n\nIn spite of our bravery and getting out okay, I still sometimes have nightmares of either me or Jay getting hurt.\n\nSometimes I get scared if I get a cold or a random chest pain.\n\n I've been to the hospital more times than I am proud of for something innocuous because I am afraid of finding a bone sprout in my lungs.\n\nWe ultimately decided not to have kids, at least not now because we are scared of having a child in a world with these things sprouting up.\n\nWe have started up a site to inform everyone of these blood trees and what to do if they see them.\n\nSo, if you see a tree that wasn't there before and it has a completely white trunk and red sac leaves, burn that motherfucker down or blow it up. \n\nAnd be careful, because you might end up as a weird tree in someone's backyard if you aren't taking the proper care to protect yourself.",

        "text": "Please, if you’re reading this, you have to help me.  You have to get me out of here.  \n\nGo to my apartment at (REDACTED) in (REDACTED), (REDACTED) and you will find me in apartment (REDACTED).  \n\nI’m inside, trapped in this fucking headset with these haptic sensors all over my body.  There’s no way of getting them off.  It feels like they put superglue on the inside of the gloves and the boots, or maybe there’s some far more high-tech mechanism at play here, but either way, I’m a prisoner inside of this VR rig now.  \n\nHow did I get here?  \n\nWell, I guess it all started when I woke up and noticed something strange on my phone.  There was a Paypal notification which read: METAVERSE INC. - USD 33.52\n\nMy brain was still a bit foggy from sleep and I tried to remember what I could have charged to my Paypal account for that amount.  I only had a couple direct withdrawals setup to Paypal, since most of them went to my credit card.  \n\nRacking my brain, I couldn’t think of anything that would fit the bill.  \n\nSo, I did what anyone else would do.  I Googled the word “Metaverse” and looked to see what the company was before filing a dispute claim.  \n\nIt sounded familiar, and immediately I understood why.  If not for the fact that I was half-asleep, I would have realized right away.  It was the Facebook Metaverse.  The 3D VR creation which had been designed as a virtual utopia where people could go to shop, socialize, work, play, and do whatever else the corporate overlords decided.  \n\nBut I had never signed up for the Metaverse.  \n\nIn fact, I didn’t even own a VR rig.  \n\nThis didn’t sit right with me.  Especially since I’d heard recently that the Metaverse was hemorrhaging cash, and that the whole operation was failing miserably.  The article I’d read spoke of 10 billion in losses, while there were only a miniscule number of users.  \n\nThere was no way I had signed up for the service, and I didn’t even use Facebook so it didn’t seem like there was any chance of an accidental purchase.\n\nMy vivid imagination pictured a nefarious plan at Facebook to use my Pixel phone’s GooglePay information to order the service without my knowledge.  \n\nI requested a refund through Paypal, saying I never received the service or product, since there was no option for “I didn’t order this shit.” \n\nThen I went to Twitter and began to make my aggravation known to the world.  I have a couple thousand followers, nothing too outrageous, and most of my tweets get one or two likes, but when I told everyone about this they totally lost their minds.  \n\nPeople I'd never spoken to before started retweeting, liking, and commenting immediately.  \n\n“So this is how they’re making back all their lost money?  Using Google Pay data to subscribe to their shitty service no one wants!? XD” said one reply. \n\n“HAHAHA!  I hope you got a refund!  That’s a pretty sneaky way to get people paying for the Metaverse!  I heard they weren’t doing well but this is ridiculous!” another person commented.  \n\nThe tweet was getting far more traction than my usual ones, but then it was suddenly removed.  \n\nI received no reason from Twitter, and when I tried to repost it again nothing happened.  Every time I hit send it seemed like it went through but when I went to check the tweet had vanished again.  \n\nAnnoyed, I was about to post my experience on Instagram or Reddit, when I received an email.  \n\nFROM: METAVERSE INC. CUSTOMER SERVICE \n\nSubject: Incidental charge\n\nI opened the email and was surprised to find it was from a customer service manager at Metaverse Inc.  Reading the contents of the email, I began to feel a strange knot growing in my belly.  It felt like someone was pouring cement down my gullet, and it was hardening and drying in my gut, getting heavier and heavier by the second.  \n\nDear Mr. Grupe, the email read.  \n\nWe at Metaverse Inc. were displeased to hear that you noticed the recent charge you incurred on our behalf.  Rest assured that we are looking into the matter and will provide you with a prompt refund.  \n\nAs a token of apology, please allow us to offer you an additional gift.  \n\nWe noticed in your tweet that you said you didn’t even own a VR rig.  Well, we would like to remedy that situation.  \n\nVR is a very fun and even therapeutic recreational experience.  It is enjoyed by many people, as is the Metaverse, despite your assertion that it is a “wallet-fucking cartoon-world built on lies for the enjoyment of idiots.”\n\nAs such, we would like to afford you the opportunity to experience it.  \n\nThe Metaverse should be enjoyed by all.  And one day, it will be.  \n\nFor you, we would like to provide a free HTC headset with haptic bodysuit for your use.  Of course, it will be your decision if you wish to participate in the Metaverse, but we hope you will give it a shot!  \n\nThank you ever so much for bringing this situation to our attention.  \n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Metaverse Team\n\n\n*\n\nAfter reading the email again, I read it three more times.  \n\nWere they serious?  Was this a prank?  A joke?  Viral marketing?  \n\nWhat the fuck was going on?  \n\nI was suddenly very scared.  It occurred to me that I had been talking shit publicly about one of the world’s largest and most powerful corporations.  They could easily have me killed or silenced, they could probably wipe out my entire life if they wanted to.  I had no doubt they could destroy my career in the tech industry, and could make my YouTube channel vanish into the world of shadowbanned trash.  \n\nThe doorbell rang and a chill ran up my spine.  \n\nWas that them?  Were they here, at my front door?\n\nNo, that was ridiculous.  \n\nStill, my legs were trembling when I got up and walked to the front door.  \n\nI opened it and my heart skipped a beat.  Jumping backwards, I yelped in fear as a huge drone helicopter was hovering just outside.  For a second I thought it would charge forward, slicing my neck with its razor-sharp robot-controlled rotor blades.  \n\nBut instead a screen lit up on the front of it, showing a green smiley-face.  \n\n“Thank you for choosing THE METAVERSE,” it said in a robotic voice, then took off into the air, disappearing into the clouds.  \n\n“... the fuck was that?” I asked no one in particular, then looked down to see there was a large package on my doorstep.  \n\nI picked it up with a growing feeling of anxiety, bringing it inside.  \n\nAfter a few minutes of deliberation, I decided to open it.  This was clearly the “gift” promised by the Metaverse people, but I hadn’t expected it to arrive so quickly.  Normally corporations were slow to respond, taking weeks to send things by mail, but this had arrived within a half hour of my tweet.  Everything about this was disturbing and was giving me a dystopian sort of vibe that I didn’t like.  \n\nStill, I unboxed it and looked inside, finding a gleaming HTC VR rig, with all of the state-of-the-art haptic technology to go along with it.  \n\nSure, I’d never owned any of this stuff, but I’d definitely researched it.  I was salivating at the opportunity to one day own a VR rig, but I’d never been able to afford one.  Especially not one like this, which cost thousands of dollars.  \n\nA hand-written card was inside the box as well, which I opened and read.  \n\nPlease enjoy, with our sincere apologies\n\nTHE METAVERSE TEAM\n\nIt still didn’t make sense to me how they could have done all this in such a short period of time, but then again, I’d heard that Google was always [listening](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/p0tvl8/the_google_algorithm_is_beginning_to_scare_me/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button), so maybe this was just further proof.  \n\nDespite my misgivings, I decided to set up the VR rig.  I got it all hooked up and powered it on.  \n\nThere was an entire haptic bodysuit, I realized, to go along with the gloves and boots.  Trying on the outfit, I noticed that it fit perfectly, as if it had been tailored to my specific dimensions.  I put the gloves on, and the footwear next.  With all of the haptics on, I took a deep, unsteady breath, and put the VR goggles on my head, tightening the strap around my chin.  \n\nA moment after I put it on, my entire field of view became infused with imagery.  \n\nAfter a few seconds of looking around, I understood where I was.  \n\nI was in THE METAVERSE. \n\nSurprisingly, it was pretty impressive.  At least to someone who’d never really used VR before.  \n\n“Wow,” I said to myself, glancing around.  \n\n“Yeah, wow,” a woman’s voice said, and I saw a cartoonish lady coming around a corner.  She had raven-black hair and a scowl etched on her face.  \n\n“Do you have any idea how much effort it takes to create a place like this?” she asked, approaching me quickly.  “And you go on Twitter and shit all over it.”\n\nA second later she was practically on top of me, and then she threw a punch hard at my gut.  \n\nThe impact to my midsection caught me completely off-guard.  It reminded me of being back in elementary school when a bully beat the shit out of me during recess, and knocked the wind out of me.  This was just like that, except a hundred times worse.  \n\nI was still recovering my breath, on the ground on my hands and knees with no memory of how I got there, when she kicked me in the ribs.  The blow was so powerful through the haptic bodysuit that it sent me flying, tumbling sideways in a barrel roll.  \n\nMy real-life body crashed into my entertainment unit, smashing my television and shattering broken glass everywhere.  It dug into my flesh and I felt blood filling the suit in places.  \n\n“Do you have any idea how hard we worked, only to have our efforts mocked?”\n\nThe next kick was to the back of my knee, and I heard it break with a bone-shattering pop.  I screamed so loud that the neighbors must have heard me.  Unless all of their Google Home devices malfunctioned at the same exact instant, playing a brief blast of loud music and drowning out my screams.  That idea occurred to me after the woman left me half-conscious in a pool of my own blood, spitting out teeth and crying in pain.  \n\n“I hope you enjoy this place we made for ungrateful people like you,” was the last thing the woman said, as her avatar vanished.  “Because you’re gonna be spending a long, long time here.”\n\nShe was right.  \n\nI tried to take off the VR goggles, but they were completely sealed onto my face.  Same with the gloves, boots, and haptic bodysuit.  I’m a prisoner inside this virtual reality getup, while one after another the Metaverse employees file in to kick the living shit out of me in every way possible, taking out their frustrations on me.  \n\nI’m not sure how long it’s been.  I’m not even sure if this is getting out there.  \n\nI eventually escaped from that section of the VR world and found this old-school computer in an internet cafe in the Metaverse.  After trying every possible avenue on it, attempting to contact help from the outside world via Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, I gave up and went on Reddit, hoping to kill some time.  \n\nThis subreddit popped up on my feed and I noticed it is filled with other experiences from people like me.  People who had things happen that aren’t normal.  \n\nMaybe this post will just blend in.  But maybe, just maybe, someone else will notice it.  \n\nI’m not holding out hope for a rescue.  \n\nAt this point I just want to warn you all. \n\nIf you notice a charge on your credit card, Paypal, or bank account, which says it’s from METAVERSE INC., don’t dispute it.  And whatever you do, don’t tweet about it or complain on Facebook or Instagram about it.  \n\nJust quietly pay it.  And every charge that follows.  \n\nBecause trust me, the alternative is much, much [worse.](https://youtu.be/8phAm6XprnQ)",

        "text": "Yes, I know, who in their right mind uses TikTok?\n\nI was always starkly opposed to Social Media, especially TikTok. That cesspit of stupidity and regurgitated jokes should’ve never become a thing, and not one as huge as it is today.\n\nI wish I’d never downloaded the damn thing. I really wish. Or maybe... maybe I do, after all? Well, never mind.\n\nOne night I was bored. After my computer broke, all I had was my phone. I was never a book guy, hell I didn’t own any and mobile games could only entertain me so much.\n\nSo, one day, I gave in and downloaded TikTok as my play store recommended.\n\nAt first, I was annoyed, more than annoyed. All I found were short clips of people acting like idiots.\n\nAfter a while, though, I found the occasional interesting piece of content. Little live hacks, for example. Videos on how to survive in the wild, do-it-yourself guides or how to prepare a hot meal without using a stove. I was always intrigued by these things.\n\nNeedless to say, I got hooked.\n\nFor the past weeks, however, I got interested in a different type of content, urban exploring that is.\n\nThe real deal, I mean. Not the bullshit in which a creator's friend covered in a bedsheet pretends to be a ghost in a dark hallway.\n\nNo, I liked to watch people explore old mineshafts, abandoned buildings or ghost towns.\n\nWhile it was fun for a while, I didn’t like the fact that I’d never be able to visit any of the places I saw.\n\nAfter getting acquainted with the shitshow that was TikTok’s search, I began browsing hashtag after hashtag. Eventually, I'd found a few local content creators who explored abandoned places in my area.\n\nNow my city isn’t huge, but it’s not small either, so there was quite a bit of content.\n\nOccasionally, I’d even watch a livestream.\n\nThere was something exhilarating about urban exploring. Before long, I put together my own list of places I wanted to see. If I ever left the house, that is, and if I ever was man enough to do so.\n\nTonight, I was notified about another livestream.\n\nIt was by two guys I’d recently discovered. Most of their content was typical for TikTok, stuff I didn’t care about. Sometimes, however, they checked out abandoned palces.\n\nI joined the livestream and heard they were on their way to one of the ‘notorious abandoned areas’ of my city.\n\n“Yeah, bro, this place used to be like hot shit back in the day! Like everyone wanted to live out here!”\n\n“No way, dude. You're fucking with me! That tower block over there's going to collapse any minute now!”\n\n“I swear, man, but it was like decades ago. I heard they even wanted to renovate the place at one point, but never did.\n\n“Yeah? Why didn’t they?”\n\n“No clue, place’s a money sink, I guess, or they realized it’s all old shit.”\n\n“Yeah, like the rest of this city!”\n\nBoth of them began guffawing, and I couldn’t help but frown. They seemed to talk in the typical, annoying, over-the-top way all influencers did these days. I hated it.\n\nBefore long, however, they’d reached a giant, old apartment complex.\n\nFor a while, they continued on down a small, deserted street. Then they followed an alley that led them right into the center of the complex. The entire place was ruined. What might have once been a nice little park was now completely overgrown. Rubble was everywhere and here and there I saw stacks of old, half-rotten construction materials.\n\n“Hey man, do you hear that? It sounds like crying or something!” one of them suddenly said.\n\nHis friend’s face appeared in front of the camera, an anxious look washed over it. Then he began laughing.\n\n“Fuck, bro, you almost got me!”\n\nBy now, both of them were laughing again, like the idiots they were. I wasn’t. God, these guys were annoying.\n\nWith a sigh, I put the phone down, ignored their annoying voices, and couldn’t help but stare at the empty wall in front of me. What the hell was I even doing? Why the fuck was I watching some teenagers’ stupid TikTok livestream in the middle of the night?\n\nWhile I questioned my life choices, a flashlight beam reached me from outside.\n\nIn an instant, I got up and went towards my balcony door.\n\nHaving a ground-floor apartment always makes me uneasy. The area I live in isn’t a bad one, but it’s not exactly a good one either. You never knew what could happen. One of my biggest fears was to find someone trying to climb onto my balcony and to break into my place.\n\nI took a deep breath. It was probably just someone’s phone. Then I pushed aside the curtain, trying my best to stay hidden.\n\nRight outside, in front of my building, I saw two figures. Each one was holding a flashlight in their hands, blasting their beams over apartments and windows alike. What the hell were they doing? Didn’t they know people were trying to sleep?\n\nOnce more, one of them sent their beam straight into my apartment, illuminating my living room.\n\nThose assholes. I bet they were trying to fuck with people!\n\nFrom outside, I could hear their laughter and their high-pitched teenage voices. Got nothing better to do, eh?\n\nGrowing angry, I pushed open the balcony door to tell them to fuck off.\n\nRight when I stepped outside, one of them was actually trying to climb onto my balcony. For a moment, the beam of his flashlight hit me right in the face.\n\n“What the fuck?!” I screamed while I instinctively shielded my eyes from the blinding light.\n\nScreaming in surprise, the guy tumbled backwards and crashed back down over the balcony railing.\n\nIn an instant, I was back inside, throwing the balcony door shut. That was it. Now I was pissed. Fucking around with flashlights was one thing, but trying to break into my place was a whole different story.\n\nI put on my shoes, threw on my jacket, and stormed outside. Before I did, I got a hold of a broom. \n\nJust in case, I told myself.\n\nWhen I pushed open the apartment building’s door, I saw they were still right there. One of them was on the ground, probably hurt from tumbling down, while his friend was trying to help him up.\n\nThe moment they saw me, they both froze.\n\n“The hell do you think you’re doing?” I screamed at them.\n\nIn my anger, I began waving around the broom, hoping to show them I was serious.\n\n“N-no, we did nothing, I swear! We didn’t know someone lived here, so... We’re sorry, we’re sorry!” one of them called out to me.\n\nBy now, the one on the ground had gotten back to his feet.\n\n“Get the hell out of here,” I spat at them, taking a single, well-measured step forward.\n\nBy now, both of them were shaking. They were pleading with me, crying and repeating their ‘we’re sorry’ as they backed away.\n\nAs I stood there, watching them, this entire situation felt weird. Why the hell were they suddenly so scared? Just moments ago, they’d tried to climb onto someone’s balcony and now...\n\nMy anger evaporated, and I almost felt sorry for them. Almost. Still, I lowered the broom and tried to look as non-threatening as possible.\n\n“Yo, I won’t do anything to you guys, all right? Just leave.”\n\nThey were still scared, but nodded vehemently, promising they’d never ever be back again. Then they both turned around and booked it.\n\nAs I looked after them, I still didn’t know why they’d been so scared. I mean, sure, I’m a big dude, but more fat than muscle. Don’t tell me it’s because of the freaking broom?\n\nOn the way back inside, I couldn’t help but laugh about the entire situation. Freaking teenagers...\n\nI’d barely entered my living room when I heard their voices again. I jerked around and went back to the balcony. Don’t tell me...\n\nNo one was outside. The balcony was empty, and so was the area in front of the building.\n\nWhat had I just heard?\n\nThen I saw my phone. TikTok was still open, and the stupid livestream from before was still playing.\n\n“Holy shit, bro, what the fuck was that?!”\n\n“Did you guys see that? Did you just fucking see that?!”\n\nAs I picked up the phone, I saw that the two of them were still running.\n\nThe chat was going crazy. Messages were coming in at an almost astronomical speed. I could barely read anything, but what I did mentioned the words crazy person and squatter.\n\nAs I continued to listen, there was soon no doubt anymore. It was the same two guys, the same two idiot teenagers who’d just tried to break into my place.\n\nHadn’t they gone to some abandoned area, though? How’d they ended up here?\n\nI reasoned, they’d given up on their urban exploring and went to fuck with people, but...\n\nHow’d they made it here so quickly? Wait, where exactly did they go? There weren’t any abandoned places nearby!\n\nBy now, more and more people in chat were asking about the abandoned area, about its location. When one of the hosts finally answered, I was even more confused. It was my area, my home. But, this place wasn’t abandoned! I lived here, people lived here! I was right here, sitting in my living room, there was my bedroom and over there... No, calm down, don’t be an idiot!\n\nThis was TikTok after all! Who knows, maybe that entire livestream was pre-recorded and in reality they went out to fuck with people for new content. Hell, maybe they found me on their follower list, saw I lived nearby, and decided to prank me or something. Yeah, that had to be it.\n\nThe more I tried to convince myself, however, the more I realized how ridiculous those scenarios were. Yet the alternative...\n\nA new notification interrupted my thoughts. It was a new TikTok video, one just posted by the guys whose livestream I’d just watched.\n\nWhen I read the title, I shivered.\n\n**Highlights of the CRAZIEST livestream EVER! Run-in with INSANE squatter! WE almost DIED!!! HOLY SHIT, guys!!!**\n\nI read the title again, then once more. With slightly shaking hands, I pressed play.\n\nI watched as the two of them walked past abandoned buildings. Then they were at the apartment complex, moving their flashlights around. Finally, one of them tried to climb onto a balcony.\n\nRight at that moment, an unkempt, bearded guy jumped from an opening that might once have been a balcony door.\n\n“What the fuck?!” I heard him scream.\n\nThe phone slipped from my hands and my head spun. There was no way. There was no freaking way!\n\nThat was my voice, my face. Only it was... different. In the video, I looked dirty, unkempt, bearded. My voice sounded rougher, deeper, and, most of all... crazier.\n\nI told myself I was wrong. This entire night was getting to me and my mind was playing tricks on me, that’s all.\n\nThen I picked up the phone and played the video again.\n\nThere it was. My face. My voice.\n\nI watched as my alter ego burst from the building, holding a metal rod in his hand. I heard, as I screamed at them in an almost incoherent voice. Almost. I understood enough.\n\n“The hell do you think you’re doing!?”\n\nIt was the same words. The ones I’d screamed at them not even an hour ago.\n\nIn an instant, I threw the phone across the room. There was no way this was real. It had to be fake! Some sort of stupid trick, a deep fake or god knows what!\n\nIn an instant, I dashed into my bathroom, turned on the lights and stared at myself in the mirror. There I was, cleanly shaven, slightly muffled hair, but overall, pretty presentable.\n\nThen, for a second, I could almost see my hair grow, could almost see the dirty unkempt beard and the crazy eyes I’d seen in the video.\n\nI cringed back. No, it’s not fucking real!\n\nBack in the living room, I shivered again. Why was it so cold? I could almost feel a breeze blowing through my apartment.\n\nI checked the balcony door again, but it was closed. As I stared outside, however, I wondered.\n\nHow long had I lived here?\n\nWhen had I last spoken to someone?\n\nHell, when had I last seen anyone else who lived here?\n\nI’m sitting here now, typing this out in as much detail as I can.\n\nI don’t know what the hell’s going on. With all of this. I mean, I’m right here, in my apartment, sitting on my living room couch!\n\nYet as I’m typing this, I can feel it again, this cold, almost freezing breeze. And every once in a while I almost can’t help going through a beard [I know shouldn't be there.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=UpdateMeBot&amp;subject=Subscribe&amp;message=SubscribeMe!%20%2Fr%2Fnosleep%20%2Fu%2FRehnWriter)\n\n[YT](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXKQbQnB1k_FTnTMyNudIFA/)\n\n[WS](https://rehnwriter.com/)",

        "text": "“Got one last story in you Gramps?”\n\nI couldn’t help but smile as I shot the old man the question and tipped the beer bottle to my lips, downing the last few drops of precious brew. \n\nI smiled because it was rhetorical, redundant. A question I already knew the answer to. Ya see, Gramps *always* had a story. \n\nI’d been visiting with Gramps and listening to him weave his wild yarns my entire life. From tales of adventure, to comedic experiences with some of the town’s local oddballs, to the occasional [terrifying](https://old.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/x5wkbz/a_weird_story_my_gramps_told_me_the_tale_of_the/) [splatter](https://old.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/x41pgi/a_weird_story_my_gramps_told_me_the_tale_of_the/) show that rivaled any horror picture. \n\nTo put it simply, I’d literally grown up on the old man’s entertaining ramblings. \n\nThe thing was, Gramps’ stories were *always* true. That’s what made them special. That’s what kept me captivated over all the years and years that I heard them. \n\nIt didn’t matter if we were doing something boring like adding the umpteenth coat of paint to his rotting and weather-beaten barn, or choking back tears from the dust as we organized his collection of musty old post cards. \n\nGramps always made it worthwhile because there was always a story. Truly, the best memories of my life.\n\nHe was getting old though. He’d always been old - Gramps had seemed ancient my entire life. As weathered and warped as that old barn we’d paint over and over. The last few years though, his health was on a decline. \n\nI’d moved two towns over about three years back. Got a job on a large farm and then started seeing a girl I really liked. I was enjoying my twenties as any honest man should. Thinking about me and my future and my world. \n\nBut the truth of it was, I didn’t get back home near as much as I should’ve. Near as much as I thought I’d want to. \n\nIt had been about a year since I’d seen Gramps when mom called me last week, talking real sad about the old man and how he “wasn’t doing well.” Told me I should come see him soon as I could.\n\nTold me there maybe wouldn’t be so many chances left.\n\nThe guilt I felt, the hurt in my heart, I don’t mean to dwell on it or beat myself up. But as soon as she told me that Gramps’ health was on the decline, I thought about the stories. The memories. All those wonderful years, and how easily I’d let them *become* just that - memories. \n\nI took some days off from the farm right away, and headed home fast as I could.\n\nSo here we sat, me and Gramps. For the first time in a long time. Two men sharing a cold beer together (a tradition we’d adopted around the time I turned about 17 or so - a fact we’d both take to the grave).\n\nIt saddened me to say that the old man really was the worst I’d seen him. Gramps had always been a tall and powerful man, even in his old age. But now, he was fully withered. His eyes had become nearly totally sunken, two black pits rimmed with wrinkles. His rail thin arms were mottled with blue veins, head hairless.\n\nA constant stream of brown tobacco juice still dripped from his quivering jaw, and he still wore his faded orange and white trucker cap on his liver spotted head. But it looked like the weight of the hat, the effort of chewing the tobacco - any slight level of exertion at all - would cause him to collapse into dust.\n\nGramps didn’t have quite his usual level of vigor and spunk, but we still got on like we hadn’t spent a day apart.\n\nWe talked about the old times, the good times, the current times. He asked me about work and my car, and smiled wryly when I told him about my girl. We bullshitted, we caught up, and for those few hours it felt like the old days again. Like I was a little boy holding a paintbrush and the world was as vast and limitless as one of Gramps’ stories. \n\nThe stories. \n\nI couldn’t help myself. \n\nIt was getting late, and I could tell Gramps was tired. A few times as we sat on that front porch , watching the summer sun settle into dusk, I caught him closing his eyes a bit longer than a standard blink. \n\nI’d have to leave soon, leave Gramps all alone, and I just got this nagging feeling that I wasn’t gonna see him again. Even if I came back tomorrow, even if I came back in an hour. Once I got in that car and the farmhouse disappeared on the horizon, Gramps would be gone too. \n\nAnd so I asked him. \n\nOne last story. Somehow I think we both knew that I didn’t mean for the night. \n\nGramps sighed, and he chuckled. An ancient, wheezing chuckle of great effort. But genuine and real. \n\n“God damn fuckface,” he finally answered, my old insulting-yet-endearing family nickname a good indicator that a story would in fact be coming. “Ya stroll back in here from your fancy job, and can’t even let an old man rest?”\n\nHe smiled, and I couldn’t help but sheepishly do the same, my cheeks reddening. \n\n“Hell,” he continued. “I dunno that there’s one story I ain’t already told. Best I can recollect, ya’ve heard every one I got. Well…” \n\nGramps went silent, a serious look crossed his face as he seemed to think long and hard. His dark eyes blackened even further as the thoughts consumed him. \n\nFinally, after what felt like an eternity of contemplation, he spoke.\n\n“How ‘bout one from when I was a kid?”\n\nMy eyes widened. Gramps was probably right - I had heard all of his stories. But not this one. To my memory, and it was a good memory, I’d never heard a single tale from Gramps’ childhood. \n\nThough Gramps body language and demeanor indicated that he wasn’t sure this was a story he should be telling his grandson, I couldn’t hide my excitement. If this was our last story ever, it had to be something special. Something wild, maybe something no one else had ever heard. \n\n “Come on Gramps, let’s hear it!” I exclaimed. Gramps’ face was still twisted in that contemplative look, eyes cast down at the ground and away from me. Slowly, in a way that almost seemed reluctant, he nodded and began. \n\n- - -\n\nI reckon I was about 11 years old, maybe 10. Couple of us kids used to play the whole summer down the creek. It was a big marshy pit, almost more like a swamp. Past the old junkyard and through a hidden and twisted path that snaked through the dry grass. \n\nMe, Gertie, Simon. We’d all of us play down there damn near every single day. Dunkin’ each other and spittin’ water and swimmin’ and acting like a bunch of fools. Sometimes see a frog or scream “Alligator!” And get everyone running. \n\nMorning til dusk we’d be there. I think about those days and sometimes it’s like I can still feel the sun on my skin, the dry boards of that hidden walking path ‘neath my feet.\n\n‘Course, the watering hole wasn’t exactly the safest. We’d hear stories - a lady drowned there with her little baby, local crooks and thugs might would use it as a dumping ground since the creek would eventually flow into a larger river outside town.  \n\nWe didn’t worry so much - what the hell did we care? Little kids always think they got super powers. Like nothin’ can hurt them. The few rumors made the place more exciting. \n\nThat was, until Gertie drowned. \n\nDay was like any other, nothin’ out of the ordinary. The four of us had met up outside Simon’s parents’ chicken farm, then headed to the creek. We’d goofed the whole way there , shovin’ each other and deciding what games we’d play. Hot that day, hot like it is now. \n\nWasn’t long after we’d stripped down and jumped in that Gertie yelled about her leg. \n\nWe thought she was kiddin’ at first, we all played cruel little games like that on each other. \n\nBut those tears in her eyes, the panic in her voice as she screamed that something was wrapped around her leg… no child could take that. We rushed over to her, tried to help, tried to pull her out. \n\nWe couldn’t really see beneath the water, see what had her. It was too murky and dark, even on a sunny day like that. The whole time she cried and screamed that *somethin’* had her ankle so tight, so hard that it was bein’ crushed.\n\nThen, she vanished. Sucked under like she damn well disappeared. \n\nThe two of us screamed and we ran the hell out  of that murk and mire fast as our little legs would take us. Ran back home to Simon’s parents in our soakin’ wet underwear, crying and snot runnin’ down our little noses, tellin’ ‘em what happened. \n\nThey launched a search, whole town got involved. \n\nGertie’s body didn’t turn up til three days later. We didn’t see it. No one did, ‘cept the searcher who stumbled on it. It was floating face down in the creek, right where she’d disappeared. It was like she got sucked away and spit back up.\n\nThe sick part, the thing us kids heard that weren’t s’pposed to, is that Gertie’s head was missing. Gone. Torn clean off. \n\nWhat kinda drowning does that?\n\nHer funeral was a closed casket. And we were forbidden to ever go to that creek again. Not that we needed much convincin’. \n\nThing was though, that didn’t stop us. ‘Course it didn’t. Not cuz we wanted to swim or play - those memories were tainted. Ruined. They weren’t worth a shit without Gertie. \n\nNo, we wanted to know. Wanted to know how a creek disappears someone and rips their head off. Wanted to know why that happened to our friend. \n\nThat curiosity, it’s dangerous sometimes. You got that curiosity in you fuckface. Always have. I have it too, I think. But at first I was too scared to act on it. \n\nI thought about that creek damn near every night. I’d see those murky waters in my night terrors, when I laid down for bed. Gertie’s big brown eyes peeking out of that black mire. Just the top half of her head staring at me, like she wanted something. \n\nSimon convinced me, one day. We were at the chicken farm, cleanin’ up the dead newborns from inside the coop. It always felt like goin’ through the motions after Gertie died. “Ah hell with this,” Simon exclaimed as he threw down the sack of baby chicks. “Let’s go to the damn creek. Let’s see if we can find it.” I stared at him quizzicamally. \n\n“Gertie’s head.”\n\nBoy, did my mouth drop to the damn floor. We all wanted to investigate the creek, but I’d never thought of it that way. Never thought about *findin’* her.\n\n“Havent you seen her? At night , when you’re dreaming I mean.” Simon continued. I nodded, even more surprised that he’d been havin’ the same dreams as me!\n\n“I think it’s like, she needs us. She can’t rest unless we find it.”\n\nIt seemed logical enough to me. Same kinda thing I’d seen in horror pictures, sneakin’ into the old drive in. It was worth it just for a shot to make the damn nightmares stop. Silently as we could we crept off the farm and made our way to the creek like old times. Only one man short. \n\nWhen we got there that day, the whole place just didn’t quite feel right. No life there. No noise. A wrongful stillness in the air. \n\nIt happened almost immediately. \n\nThe two of us were slowly inching around the creek’s edge as the surface of that black, inky water broke, and a tiny head of golden hair emerged. \n\nGertie’s brown eyes locked with mine and hell if I didn’t freeze in place like the devil was staring right into my soul. \n\nI couldn’t even scream, the terror gripped me so deep. \n\nBut Simon could.\n\nHe screamed at the top of his lungs, collapsing to the ground as I saw a dark stain forming on his shorts. \n\nSomehow, findin’ exactly what we’d expected was the most terrifyin’ thing in the world. \n\nThen, Gertie rose up.\n\nWorse than the dream, worse than we imagined. \n\nOn my soul, on every story I’ve ever told you, that was not Gertie in that swamp. \n\nOh it was her head - her blond hair and coffee colored eyes, dimpled smile and missin’ front tooth.\n\nThat angelic head sat on top a twisty and gnarled body, a hideous sight that revealed itself the taller it rose from those depths. \n\nIt was human like, but not quite - it’s torso and arms and legs were unnaturally long, bony and spindly. It had sagging and veined breasts, its sallow yellow skin covered in weeping orange boils and browning scabs.\n\nThe hands, those knobby claws endin’ with cracked and sharpened nails as black as the water it rose from. Tufts of black animal hair covered it’s shoulders and wrists and just below it’s waist, foul and dripping wet. \n\nAll in all, the thing stood probably 7 feet tall fully erect.\n\nAnd at the top of its massive, elongated and twisted neck sat the too small, pinprick head of our best friend. You could clearly see the point where Gertie’s head had been *attached* to the thing’s neck - a raw and red strip of glistening gore divided the spot where that hideous veined yellow flesh met Gertie’s. \n\nThe thing of it was though, was how *perfectly* Gertie was preserved. She didn’t look rotted or bloated or like she’d been at the bottom of a creek for 3 weeks. She looked fine as the day we’d last seen her - she looked alive!\n\nGertie opened her mouth, but it wasn’t her voice. It was some awful, strangled sound. Wet and hollow and rasping. A voice no ears were ever meant to hear. A voice from the bottom of a creek. A voice that ain’t of this world. \n\n“I DONT WANT THIS ONE!” It bellowed as Gertie’s face twisted into a visage of pure hatred, eyes bulging from her head. \n\nLightning fast, the thing bounded out of the creek and onto the shore, and it shot its massive claw at Simon’s leg, wrappin’ him tight. \n\nGod he screamed bloody murder, he screamed the worst scream I ever heard. The thing stared intently at him with Gertie’s eyes, full of hate and somethin’ else. I was frozen in place, my feet cemented to the ground beneath me. \n\nIt picked Simon up by the leg, hangin’ him upside down and bringin’ him up to its face. Starin’ right into his eyes.\n\nThe whole time Simon screamed, piss runnin’ down his whole body, tears and snot dribbling to the ground. \n\nThe hideous creature glanced at me from the corner of Gertie’s eye, turning its attention from Simon. \n\nThen suddenly, with its other claw, the thing reached up and palmed the top of its head - of Gertie’s head - and with a dull and wet *riiiiip* it tore her head clean off its tree trunk neck.\n\nI couldn’t stifle the scream then, god I screamed. A scream that could’a split the sky. \n\nThe thing was, once it had torn off Gertie’s head and thrown it to the ground - her head that I’d just seen talkin’ and movin’ like it was alive, only now the eyes were just lifeless and dead and starin’ up at the clouds forever - and reeking black ichor cascaded from its freshly mangled neck hole… It kept movin’.\n\nYou get what I’m saying fuckface?! It was a giant, grotesque body with **no head** , and it was alive! It kept that tight grip on Simon’s leg, still holdin’ him upside down as the blood rushed to his head. It lifted him higher and still *stared* at him, with that empty space where a head should be. Stared with nothin’ there.\n\nSomethin’ somewhere in me woke up. \n\nWhat else could I do, fuckface?\n\nI ran.\n\nRan fast as I could, hoping I wouldn’t hear the sounds of giant wet feet slapping the earth behind me. I knew I’d never outrun the damn thing. \n\nBut no, all I heard was a wet rippin’ sound in the not too far off distance, as Simon’s screams were cut short. \n\nAnd I knew. I just knew what it was doin’.\n\nAnd god, god I wish that was the end of it. It was evening by then, and I simply ran my sorry ass all the way home, washed up and hopped into bed. Mom and dad didn’t ask too many questions - no one even knew yet that another child had gone “missin’” at that damned lake. \n\nAs I lay there in bed, mind racing, The worst part wasn’t even seeing what had become of Gertie. And it wasn’t knowing what had become of Simon. \n\nIt wasn’t even thinking about that damned creature - thinking about where it came from, where it had been hiding. Was it the malformed and demonic reincarnation of some poor drowned woman? A booger straight from hell?\n\nHad it always been there? Lurkin’ beneath the water, just waitin’ to snatch one of us? To snatch is new head?\n\n‘Cause I knew by then that that’s what the thing wanted - that’s what it had been lookin’ for. An incomplete, wretched thing just wantin’ to be whole.\n\nNo, none of that was the worst. The worst was that night, in that most oppressive dark of midnight, dark as the bottom of that creek. \n\nWhen I heard a tapping on my bedroom window. \n\nAnd I pulled the covers over my head tight, but I could hear a quiet and awful voice from behind the curtain, muffled by the glass. \n\nBut it wasn’t that same awful voice from the depths of the creek , being spit out of Gertie’s mouth.\n\nIt was Simon’s voice. A little distant and garbled, but god damn if it wasn’t him. \n\n“I don’t like this one.”\n\nI knew it wasn’t really him. Couldn’t be. It was only a sad and confused imitation. But there was something in that voice, some quiet and needful like desperation. It was like the real Simon layered under somethin’ else. But Simon was there.\n\nI couldn’t help it, I will never know what came over me. But I found myself standin’, my hand wrapped tight around that curtain.\n\nThe tapping stopped, like we were both anticipating it. I pulled that curtain back, just a bit and I got a glimpse of Simon’s eyes staring back at me. Peeking from just over the windowsill. I knew that a gnarled and monstrous form was crouched just out of my view, clenchin’ it’s clawed hands into fists and anticipatin’ this moment.\n\nI threw the curtain closed and shielded myself under the covers, as I heard that hideous whispering  voice. \n\n“Just wanna be like you.”\n\n- - -\n\nIt was the worst story Gramps had ever told me - the most terrifying and harrowing and awful. I knew it had taken a lot out of the old man, and the look of twisted wistfulness and horror on his face when the tale came to an end was palpable. \n\nHe stared into my eyes with this kind of quiet desperation that I’d never seen.\n\nWe had been inseparable for so many years. Such a deep trust and love existed between us. I was probably the only person he’d ever told this story to.\n\nI didn’t have too many questions, which was rare for one of Gramps’ stories. Usually once they finished, I couldn’t keep my mouth shut. With that dark and almost hopeful look I saw in Gramps’ eyes, I could tell he *wanted* me to talk. Wanted me to ask how or what or why.\n\nOr ask my usual immediate follow up to one of his yarns:\n\n“Well, **then** what happened?” \n\nInstead, I just squeezed the old man’s hand as we stared into the country dusk.\n\nAfter a few more minutes I said my goodbyes, and Gramps and I smiled sadly at each other as I got in my pickup and drove away, watching as his meekly waving form grew smaller in my rearview mirror. \n\nTears streamed down my cheeks the entire ride home. Gramps had opened up to me more than ever with that story - a deep look into a significant personal trauma he’d experienced. It was a tale of violence and monsters, but it was something that he’d clearly carried in silence his whole life. \n\nWe’d always have that, the two of us. All those special and wonderful years of stories and the odd love between a gruff grandfather and his inquisitive grandson. \n\nI had to get out of there and away from that farmhouse as quickly as humanly possible. \n\nBecause, ya see, Gramps’ stories were *always* true. \n\nAnd when that story ended, I couldn’t take my eyes off the massive and deep pink scar that had always covered the exact middle of my grandfather’s neck. \n\nThe one he’d had my entire life. The one that, way it had always been told to me, came from an accident with a thresher when he was a boy. \n\nI was right about one thing - that meeting and that story *was* the last time I ever saw Gramps. \n\nBecause that night, that midnight in the deep and murky dark, when I heard a tapping on my bedroom window? \n\nI damn sure didn’t open the curtains.",

        "text": "In the weeks that followed, we’d found other people online in chatrooms and forums who’d made the same mistake as us. And we discovered we all had the same specific thing in common - We were all childless couples trying to get pregnant.\n\nThe events of the night played out the same for all of us, at roughly the same time, but in different neighbourhoods. \n\nAnd they all involved the same boy. The same… but different. \n\nIt was a beautiful night on Halloween this year. The streets were packed with kids and their parents. My wife Alice and I had been trying to get pregnant for two years, joked about the different costumes we’d have our kids wear as they grew. \n\nWe had big groups of kids and small groups. Even a few that looked like they were late teens. Lots of repeat costumes and themes. But the steady flow through our neighbourhood died by 9 o’clock. \n\nIt started raining around 10. Alice and I were in the kitchen finishing the last of the candy when our doorbell quickly tapped three times. \n\nIt felt strange to hear the ring so far removed from the last one. I thought it was probably a ding, dong, ditch. But then it rang again. Three quick taps. \n\nThere were a few pieces of candy left in the bowl, none of which we wanted, so we decided to answer the door one more time and give them away. \n\nI answered the door with Alice to my right. Standing in front of us was a small boy in a red sweatshirt, clutching an empty Trick R Treat bag. His hood was abnormally large and pointed up to its peak. Inside of the hood… was pure darkness. \n\nNo mask. No face. No head. Just a black abyss. \n\nAlice gasped and turned on the light. \n\nThe inside of the hood lit up. The kid was wearing a thick, black stocking over his face, which blended in with the shadows from the extra large hood. \n\nThe kid pulled the stocking off and revealed a boy about ten years old. His cheeks were flushed and his eyes were bloodshot. He looked like he’d been crying. \n\nBut he also looked familiar. A neighbourhood kid maybe. Someone we’d seen at a grocery store with his parents or at a park. \n\nAlice asked if he was okay. With that, the boy burst into tears. He rushed towards Alice and hugged her waist tightly, crying into her stomach. \n\nWe led him into the living room and I heard a strange clicking coming from the Trick R Treat bag. \n\nAlice got him on the couch and it took us ten minutes to calm him down before he was able to talk. He said his name was Brendan. \n\nBrendan claimed he’d been separated from his parents, which was his own doing. He wanted to go off and trick or trick by himself, like the big kids do. \n\nSo at one house, Brendan went up to the door with a group of other kids while their parents waited at the sidewalk, and he snuck off around the back of the house. \n\nBrendan ran several blocks before slowing. He was in a new neighbourhood and collected from an entire block, when things went sour. \n\nA group of older boys came along, pushed him down and emptied his bag of candy. After that, Brendan was lost. He searched for his parents but couldn’t find them among the crowds. Then the crowds disappeared, and he was the only one left on the street. \n\nWe were the first door he’d come to and he was so grateful we answered. \n\nAlice offered to make him hot chocolate and give him the last of our candy, but Brendan said he didn’t care much for sweets. He didn’t like candy because it would *“rot your teeth out.”* He just liked dressing up and going door to door. He’d usually give away his loot to friends at school the next day. \n\nThe more Alice and Brendan talked, the more familiar the kid looked. But I couldn’t place him. And my eyes kept finding his Trick R Treat bag, clutched in a death grip in the boy’s right hand. \n\nUnfortunately, Brendan didn’t know his parents’ phone number and didn’t have it written down. When we asked him his address, he could only remember the house number.  \n\nAll we could think to do was call the police and let them know the situation. We figured his parents would have already called in anyway.\n\nBut they hadn’t. \n\nThe Officer we spoke to said there were all kinds of calls about mischief and minor theft, but none for missing kids. We gave the Officer our contact information, and he said a patrol car would be over in the next hour. \n\nBrendan and Alice got really close in the following half hour. He’d completely leaned into her on the couch and she had her arm around him, stroking his head.\n\nI remember thinking how ready Alice was to be a mom. We’d been trying for a while and I was starting to get nervous. I know Alice was too. I think that was partially why we were so overly-welcoming to Brendan.\n\nAs I stared at Brendan with his face so close to Alice’s, I realized why he looked familiar. \n\nBrendan looked like a perfect mix of Alice and I. \n\nHe had my eyes and nose and her thick, dark hair and mouth. Alice and I didn’t even know each other ten years ago, but if we had and had gotten pregnant with a boy… Brendan would have looked identical. \n\nThe phone rang. It was the police. They were pissed and acting like I’d prank called them earlier so I took it into the kitchen.\n\nThe Officer I’d spoken to said that after he’d hung up with me, he’d received multiple, identical calls from various other homes. They’d all welcomed a child in a red sweatshirt who told the same story as I did. \n\nI didn’t know what to say, but I was angry. I figured Brendan had gotten together with a group of buddies to prank some houses with the same outfits and stories. His name probably wasn’t even Brendan. \n\nBut… *he did* look exactly like Alice and I… \n\nI’d walked to the far end of the kitchen at this point and couldn’t see into the living room. I told the cop I’d call him back and went to confront Brendan. \n\nBut he was gone. As was Alice. \n\nI called out to Alice, but there was no response. The house was quiet. \n\nI walked into the main entrance and checked the door, which was closed and locked. There was a loud thud overhead. From where I was standing, the sound came from our bedroom. \n\nI rushed upstairs and turned down the hall, but stopped in my tracks. Brendan’s Trick R Treat bag was laying on the floor in the doorway to our bedroom. I picked up the bag and looked in.\n\nThe inside was smeared with red liquid and filled with what looked like those white Chicklet chewing gums. A groan came from the bedroom and I turned my attention back to it. \n\nI thought it was empty at first, but as I moved in, I saw someone laying on the ground behind the far side of the bed. \n\nIt was Alice. \n\nShe was on her stomach, face down. But there was something over her head. It was Brendan’s thick black stocking. I pulled it off of Alice and found her unconscious and with a mouth full of blood. \n\nI heard a floorboard creak behind me and I spun. The Trick R Treat bag, still in my hands, came loose and spilled out on the ground. \n\nThere were dozens of bloody teeth and root endings scattered across the floor from the bag. \n\nAnd standing above me… was Brendan. Only his hood was up again. And completely black inside. \n\nBefore I knew it, he was overtop of me and pushed his hood forward, engulfing my head.\n\nI blacked out. When I woke up, it was because the police we’d called earlier had found Alice and I unconscious upstairs. \n\nBoth of our mouths were filled with blood… because our teeth had been yanked out while we were unconscious. Roots, nerves and all. And they were missing. \n\nAs was Brendan. With no sign of him ever having been there. \n\nThe next several hours were horribly painful as we had to have emergency reconstructive surgery done. We’ve had implants put in since, which cost even more than they sound. \n\nAll the single couples we’ve spoken to, we know they’re telling the truth about being visited by the same kid in the red sweatshirt on Halloween. \n\nWe know, because they all have the same smiles as us.",

        "text": "Now that you know why Henri [responded the way he did](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10ofz73/the_girl_of_henris_dreams_the_bar_at_the_edge_of/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)—and now that I’ve been able to take a breather following the whirlwind of a conversation we had—I’m ready to tell you about what happened between me, Henri, and Asher at the bar.\n\nTo be honest, relaying Henri’s story was kind of a relief. My head was still reeling from everything we that happened, and it was nice to take a moment to process it before throwing myself into writing about it. \n\nBut now, let’s do this thing.\n\nAfter showing us the photo of Lucille, Henri leaned back in his chair, arms crossed. He didn’t say anything for a long, long time. He just stared at me, then Asher, then me again, his face unreadable. For once, I had no problem staying quiet. I wasn’t about to be the one to break the tense silence.\n\nFinally, after what felt like hours, Henri sighed. “Ian, I’m sure you have a good reason for bringing him here. We’ll get to that. But first, you”— he pointed to Asher— “need to explain to me how, with marks like that on his neck, my nephew isn’t dead. And you better not have been the one to put them there, or I’ll kill you myself, Ian’s reason be damned.”\n\nAsher cleared his throat, glancing at me nervously. I didn’t blame him. “No, I wasn’t. And to be honest, I’m just as confused as to how he’s alive.” He shook his head. “I saw it happen, and I tried to stop it. You have no idea how relieved—and shocked—I was when he only passed out.”\n\nPuzzle pieces snapped into place: Asher’s relief and amazement when I’d woken after my nightmare, his and Acacia’s desire to get me away from prying eyes. I hadn’t realized just how unlikely it was that I’d woken up at all.\n\nAdd it to the list of things about me that make no sense, I guess.\n\nStill, I found my words to defend Asher. “He’s telling the truth. Uncle Henri, Asher has saved my life multiple times now, and—”\n\nHenri raised his eyebrows, looking back to Asher thoughtfully. “*Multiple* times?”\n\nIt was my turn to be nervous. Well, *embarrassed* might be the better word. I was pretty sure my cheeks were turning as red as the dragon flames n Henri’s fireplace. I stared at the carpet as I said, “I’m sorry, I should have told you earlier. I’ve met him in the dark forests before.”\n\nHenri frowned, though his gaze was focused on something else far beyond the room. Maybe he was lost in his memories. It was another long pause before he spoke again, and this time was directly to Asher. “Your people live in the dark forests?”\n\n“Yes,” said Asher. He seemed a little more confident now; I suppose Henri being calmer made the threat of being murdered by a griffin less concerning. “In a village we built ourselves. We call it Oasis.” He glanced around the room, taking it in. “This is the first time any of us have left…well, ever.”\n\n“Not ever,” corrected Henri quietly. And then he told us everything that I’ve already relayed to you: his childhood, his wife, the tragedies he’d experienced and the actions he’d taken as a result. “I’ve regretted it ever since,” he said solemnly when recalling the exile of Asher’s kind. “An individual’s deeds do not reflect that of his people. I should not have punished all of you.” He closed his eyes, and I swear I saw a tear trail down Henri’s cheek. I’d never seen him cry before. “Until now, I believed your race to be extinct, and I considered myself the cause.”\n\nWhen he finished, the silence stretched once more, deafening in its stillness. I didn’t know what to say. I’d heard about Henri’s past before, but never in as much detail as he’d just shared. I’d never heard the parts about the harbingers. \n\nAsher was the one who broke it. His dark eyes had been wide, sorrowful, though no tears fell. I wondered if he *could* cry. Suddenly, he got to his feet, shoving his chair back, and in two quick steps had moved around the desk. To my surprise—and Henri’s, too, I think—Asher reached his arms around my uncle, hugging him.\n\n“I forgive you,” he said softly, his voice barely greater than a whisper. “On behalf of my people, I forgive you. We have learned to live in the dark, and no one alive knows it any other way. We have made peace with our home. We don’t blame anyone, and we won’t start now. So I forgive you.”\n\nI almost felt like I shouldn’t be watching; it seemed too personal. But I simply sat there, trying to hide my sniffles, as Henri hugged him back, silent tears running down his face in earnest.\n\nAfter a long moment, Henri pulled back, his tears seeming to evaporate in the air as quickly as they’d appeared. He chuckled and ran a hand through his silver-flecked hair as Asher straightened. “Enough about me,” he said. “You came for a reason, and here I am, rattling on and on about my own guilt. There are more pressing matters. Let’s hear them.”\n\nIt was only as Asher collapsed back into the chair beside me, rubbing a sleeve across his eyes—maybe he *had* been crying—that another puzzle piece fell into place: the black gloves! Unlike the guy who’d wrapped his hands around my neck, Asher was always wearing dark gloves, and he left no ashen handprints when he touched me or Henri. Harbingers must kill by touch—well, except when they touched *me,* apparently. It would match up with Henri’s story, too.\n\nI cursed myself mentally. *Probably should’ve put that one together sooner, genius.*\n\n“Henri,” I started. “Asher said that his people prayed to some kind of deity, one that existed in all planes of existence simultaneously. He thinks it could help us find the murderer. Especially if the murderer jumps between dimensions.” I paused, but Asher had already jumped to the human dimension with me and let me pull him off the ledge of a skyscraper, so I didn’t have anything to lose. “Like me.”\n\nHenri glanced sharply at Asher, then sighed at the lack of surprise on his face. “Ian has pulled you along on one his…journeys, I presume.”\n\nAsher looked at me. “Yeah. I didn’t know anyone could exist in both dimensions without combusting.”\n\n“They can’t,” said Henri, “except for Ian.”\n\n“And maybe the murderer,” I pointed out. “What a fun thing to have in common.”\n\nHenri sighed again, but this was the exasperated kind I knew all too well: the sigh I’d heard throughout my childhood that meant *I’m too good a father figure to outright tell my kid to shut up, but I’m sure thinking it.* \n\nI shut up.\n\n“An interesting idea, though,” Henri mused. “Something else believed not to exist, its details lost to time and a fading of faith. But that doesn’t mean it *can’t* exist.”\n\nSo he *did* know about the Ancient One! I wasn’t surprised. All those books in his office, all the history he’s studied in his thousands of years. Of *course* he must’ve heard of it. \n\nAsher, meanwhile, was looking like an eager puppy who hears its owner’s keys in the lock. “You think the Ancient One exists?”\n\nUncle Henri leaned back, hands clasped, considering. “I can’t say,” he said thoughtfully. “I’ve been around much longer than most, and I’ve never seen any evidence of such a being. I hadn’t even considered it a possibility for assistance. But if the Ancient One does exist, and if its legends are true…it may be exactly what we need, for more reasons than one.”\n\nI knew what he meant: the murderer, and *me.* Maybe the Ancient One would have answers that could help us find who was killing inhumans and humans in cold blood, and maybe it would also know what I was. If existing in all planes was its *thing,* surely it must know what my deal was?\n\nOf course, there were still a lot of steps between us deciding it could help to actually finding this Ancient One and getting said help. “Not to dampen the excitement,” I said, “but if it’s never been seen in all of history, how the hell are we going to track it down now?”\n\nHenri smiled, and the skin around his eyes crinkled. I liked when his smile reached his eyes. “I’ve got some ideas that might help.” \n\nHe was reaching for one of the many drawers of his desk when suddenly we heard a scuffling noise directly outside the door, immediately followed by quiet cursing. Asher leapt not only to his feet, but also vertically up and onto his chair, crouching there like a scared demonic cat. I would’ve laughed, if my heart hadn’t nearly stopped in panic. Something told me that anyone else finding out about Asher wouldn’t go as well as the discussion with Henri.\n\nBut I breathed a sigh of relief when Henri opened the door with a knowing sigh, revealing none other than Milo, leaning against the wall, deliberately staring at the ceiling and whistling—aka the most suspicious-looking attempt to look non-suspicious I’d ever seen. \n\n“I know your parents have taught you not to eavesdrop on conversations that do not concern you,” said Henri. \n\nLuckily, Milo has spent enough time at [Griffin's Edge](https://www.griffinsedgebar.com/) to remain unfazed by anything me or Henri could say.  “Oh, they did,” he said cheerily. “But fortunately, I haven’t listened to their advice since I was eight. That’s why I’ve turned out so well.” He stepped past Henri, wandering into the room as casually as if he’d been invited. “Ian! Lovely to see that you’re alive. Not as big a fan of the new neck tattoo.” He gestured at his own neck, making a face. “And you! Charmed to make your acquaintance. Sounds like you’re quite an interesting influence.” He grabbed Asher’s gloved hands—despite Asher’s stony stare—and shook them up and down vigorously. “So am I. But I’m sure there’s room for two of us.”\n\nI met Henri’s eyes and shrugged. He muttered something under his breath but simply closed the door, this time locking it, before heading back to his desk. \n\nAfter several solid seconds of handshaking—if you could call it that—Asher pulled his hands away, looking between me and Milo pointedly with raised eyebrows. “…And you are?”\n\n“Oh, sorry, this is Milo, my best friend,” I explained at the same time as Milo bowed deeply and said, “Milo, at your service!” \n\nAsher, not unlike Uncle Henri seconds before, shook his head and muttered something that sounded an awful lot like a curse. No wonder he and Henri were getting along so well. Shared exasperation over me and Milo must be an excellent bonding experience. \n\n“You were listening?” I asked as Milo sat on the floor between my and Asher’s chairs. \n\nHe scoffed. “No.”\n\nI smacked him.\n\n“Yes,” he corrected, rubbing his arm and shooting me a glare. “I saw Henri drag you and your mysterious stranger friend—still haven’t gotten your name, by the way—through the bar so fast you nearly broke the sound barrier. I figured it had to be important. I’d never heard him yell like that.” He nudged my shoulder. “Plus, you weren’t at the bar when it opened this morning. I was already worried about where you’d been.”\n\n“Thanks,” I said quietly. \n\nThere was a pause before Asher, slowly relaxing enough to settle back onto the arm of his chair, begrudgingly said, “I’m Asher.”\n\n“Cool, cool, cool,” said Milo. “Thanks for saving Ian’s stupid ass when I wasn’t there to do it.”\n\nApparently this won Asher over; he laughed out loud. Even Henri cracked a smile. “Someone had to.” \n\n“Glad we can all bond over me being an idiot,” I said. “Really enjoying that. *Anyway,* didn’t you have some ideas or something, Uncle Henri? That’s a *way* more interesting topic.”\n\n“Disagree,” protested Milo.\n\nLuckily, Henri was apparently on board, because he simply chuckled and reached for the same drawer.\n\nHe *still* didn’t get to open it, because suddenly there was another disturbance at the door. Only this wasn’t just a scuffle outside; this time, the door burst inward with such force that one of its hinges exploded, leaving it hanging there lopsided. So much for Henri’s effort to lock his office door.\n\nThis time, I felt no relief at the newest visitor—just a panicked heart beating as frantically as a butterfly in a cage, and blood running like barely-thawed ice in my veins. I knew her: an ancient nature spirit who went by the name Sky. She was in Henri’s group of ancient friends, one of the oldest beings alive today, one of the few who had been around as long as Henri. And while I’d known her all my life, it didn’t change the fact that she was incredibly powerful, or that she currently looked incredibly pissed. \n\nAnd like I’ve said before, pissing off powerful inhuman beings? *Never* a good idea.\n\nAs she stepped inside, winds whipped around us, blowing pages off Henri’s desk and books from his shelves. Leaves of all shades—auburn, emerald, even bubblegum pink—flew in the gusts; flowers sprung up from the carpet beneath her bare feet; water dripped from the edges of her sleeves, even though none of her clothes appeared to be wet; fire burned in her eyes.\n\n“Henri, what is the meaning of this?” she hissed. Her voice seemed to consist of ten different layers all at once, of many rhythms and tones, together echoing in the wind. She pointed at Asher, embers sparking at the tip of her long nails. “His kind are exiled. I seem to recall *you* leading that effort. And now you house him in your bar without telling us?”\n\nHenri calmly got to his feet. “You know I regret the haste of those actions. Surely it has been long enough to let our grudges dissolve. I do not mean to undermine you.”\n\n“And yet you hurried him away from the public eye to sneak around in your office,” she snarled. I had never seen Sky so angry, and it was terrifying. \n\n“I had good reason,” began Henri. I heard the effort in his voice, how much he was restraining himself to stay calm. “I—”\n\n“Enough,” hissed Sky. “The punishment for leaving the dark forests was clear. Harbingers are too dangerous for our society. If the murders were a mystery before, they are no longer, now that we know his kind endure. You seem to have forgotten your place, old friend, but I have not.”\n\nThen, before any of us could react, she had swept forward and vanished in a swirling whirlwind…and when the air settled, she was gone. \n\nAnd so was Asher.\n\nHenri cursed and drove his fist into his own desk, leaving a sizable dent in the wood. “Ridiculous. Seen so much, and yet unable to change their ways.”\n\nMilo plucked thorns from his blue hair, wincing. “How do we find them?”\n\n“No one can jump from here,” I said, wheels spinning in my head. “Not in the bar. Not even me—the closest gaps are on the paths out front. They must still be here somewhere. And if we hurry, we can catch them before they leave.”\n\nI was already sprinting out the door, Milo half a step behind. “So what?” he huffed as he stumbled down the stairs after me. “The hurricane was just for dramatic effect?!”\n\n“Something like that,” I said over my shoulder as I began to shove my way through the crowds. In the middle of the bar, I paused, glancing between the front and back doors. Though the front entrance would have made more sense—closest to the gates—some small feeling whispered to me to go out back.\n\nI didn’t have time to second guess. Praying I was right, I skidded on my heels and made for the back door.\n\n“Wrong way!” called Milo behind me. I ignored this and sprinted onto the patio.\n\nFor half a second, I was terrified I’d guessed wrong, allowing Sky to escape to who-knows-where with Asher. But then I saw a flash of movement by the tables in the corner: a spark of flame and a pink leaf.\n\nRelief and adrenaline flooded through me as I crossed the patio quicker than I ever had in my life, nearly slipping on the wet concrete near the pool’s edge as I rounded the seating area. And there they were. Sky had Asher on the ground, wrapped in thick vines which seemed to be constricting, causing him to gasp for breath. A ring of fire burned around them, blocking anyone from getting inside.\n\nImmunity to fire sure would be nice right now! Why couldn’t any of my oddities be *useful?* I mean, here I was, separated from Sky and Asher by dancing flames, armed with a pistol and knife that I surely couldn’t use without offending an ancient being even further.\n\nBut maybe it was worth it. After all, Asher had saved my life multiple times already.\n\nCursing, I was about to suck it up and fire off a shot into Sky’s chest when a hand on my shoulder pulled me back. As I began to turn, a wave of chlorinated water swept past me, rising from the pool and collapsing onto a section of the flames with a quenching *hiss.* \n\nI looked back to see Milo, eyes glowing blue like sapphires behind his glasses. He let go of my arm. “Get in there!” he said. “She’s a lot stronger than I am, I can’t quell her fire for long!”\n\nI nodded and threw myself over the puddles Milo had created. I’d barely cleared the edge when the water evaporated unnaturally fast, flames springing back up in their stead to reestablish the ring—which I now stood within.\n\nBoth Sky and Asher turned to look at me; Asher’s dark eyes were scared, while Sky’s were hardly recognizable: burning red, more like those of a demon than a nature spirit, no traces of kindness or humanity there, just anger and hatred.\n\n“STOP!” I had to shout to be heard over the whipping winds. “HE’S NOT EVIL!”\n\nThe vines tightened; Asher’s face was turning gray as they squeezed his neck and chest. Sky simply chuckled. “Of course he is. His kind don’t know any different. They were *made* for death.” Her voice echoed with the memories of thousands of years.\n\nI thought of Asher sitting casually on a tree branch, laughing; of Acacia teasing me for thinking they ate people while she put a kettle on the stove; of the other harbingers I’d seen living happily in their village. They deserved to exist just as much as anybody else. And I’ve met plenty of beings *way* more evil than Asher—say, that nasty vampire who tried to drain me dry when I was thirteen. No comparison. \n\n“HE HASN’T KILLED ANYONE!” I yelled. “HE SAVED MY LIFE!”\n\n“It’s only a matter of time,” snarled Sky. “If we let them back in, history will repeat itself. You’re too young to know any better, boy.”\n\nMy fear was suddenly overtaken by anger. All I could think of was Henri being told the same thing as he grew up, over and over, until he ran away from it. He wasn’t too young then, and I wasn’t now. Screw politeness. In one quick motion, I pulled my pistol from my belt and fired. “NO, I’M NOT!”\n\nThe shot seemed to take her by surprise; everything froze for a moment when it hit her. The flames faded to embers, the leaves blowing in the wind sat still in the air, the vines around Asher loosened.\n\nBut only for a moment. \n\nThen Sky screamed, an awful inhuman sound, and everything resumed more intense than before. The ring of flames grew taller and hotter, scorching my skin even from several feet away, and the vines tightened around Asher so much that his eyes bulged as he lost all air.\n\nSky threw out an arm and a tendril of ivy followed, wrapping itself around my neck and immediately constricting, lifting me off the ground as it did. The pressure, coupled with the pain of the handprints already lingering on my skin, nearly caused me to black out. \n\nBlack spots danced across my vision as my feet dangled in the air. I tried to scrabble for the ivy around my throat with my free hand, but I couldn’t get a grip; my fingers just dug into my neck, making the pain even worse. \n\nMy thoughts were quickly dissolving into an oxygen-less blur of confusion. The edges of my vision were darkening—the smells of smoke and chlorine were overwhelming—Asher’s gasps for breaths mimicked my own—\n\nAnother screech interrupted the mess of senses, but this one sent a wave of comfort through me; it was the screech of a griffin. And there’s only one of those left in the world: my uncle. \n\nThe ivy immediately retreated, dropping me to my knees on the concrete. Gulping in air, wincing at the aching in my neck, I glanced over to see that the vines had retreated too. Asher, breathing heavily, was sitting up. \n\nHenri, meanwhile, in his natural form, had attacked Sky. Or, at least, pinned her to the ground, talons buried in her shoulders. He screeched again in her face, twisting his talons in deeper. Asher pulled me to my feet as she grimaced, the flames and wind collapsing around us. \n\n“I need to leave,” he said in my ear. He was right. I nodded and let him pull me away from the pool, glancing back nervously at Sky struggling under Henri. Milo appeared on my other side, keeping stride as we hurried across the patio.\n\nWhen we reached the corner of the building and continued along its side—best to head straight for the paths without going *through* the packed bar again—I waved Asher and Milo to go on ahead. Shaking his head, Asher let go of my arm and grabbed Milo’s instead, continuing forward.\n\nI only needed a second. I crept back, pressing myself against the wall to remain hidden, and peered around the edge to look at Henri.\n\nHe’d transformed back, though he still stood over Sky, a curved sword pointed at her heart. I’d never seen him wield it before; its blade was tinted with purple, shimmering with some internal light. And based on Sky’s face, I was pretty sure it could kill her.\n\nEven from here, I heard her words. “Oh, Henri,” she said, managing to sound both furious, disappointed, and scared all at once—though mostly disappointed. “What would Lucille think, seeing you turn on me to save that *harbinger?*” She spit out the name of Asher’s race like it left a vile taste in her mouth.\n\nHenri’s gaze flickered up to me for the briefest of moments. I don’t know how he knew I was there. But for half a second, I saw his familiar lilac eyes, and I could read there how much he cared: about me, about Milo, hell, even about Asher. Even if it destroyed his ancient friendships, he would make sure we got out of here alive—*all* of us.\n\nHenri gave me the tiniest flicker of a smile, but as soon as his eyes returned to Sky, the smile vanished, yielding to hard, determined lines. “Lucy would be damn proud of me,” he growled. “And she wouldn’t approve of you trying to kill innocent teenagers.”\n\nSky screamed again, and fire sprung up around the pair of them once more, a taller wall than before, enough that I could no longer see either her or Henri. My heart ached to stay and help, to make sure Henri was okay in there, to hug him after it was over. But I heard his roar, saw the explosion of lilac smoke as he transformed, and knew what he would say: *Go. Get Asher to safety. This is my fight now.*\n\nSo with one last glance at the fire, I turned and ran after Milo and Asher into the silver fog, away from the only home and family I’d ever known.",

        "text": "**Excerpt from the Journal of Christopher Paisley**\n\n**May 21st, 1953**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI should not be surprised. I did so much to ensure our family’s good name remained unsullied by my wretch of a brother and yet after all my hard work, his daughter comes and tries to ruin things anew. I wonder now if perhaps taking her in was a mistake. Not long ago, I had hoped that I might be able to marry Vera into a respectable family. Now, those hopes are all but dashed. She has made every possible effort to sabotage the good name of the Paisley family and so my patience is at its end. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe was caught with an old school friend of hers this time, a girl by the name of Sophie from some no name family. She can’t even choose her bloody indiscretions from good stock… I truly am at a loss for words. How am I to handle this? I took every precaution. I did everything in my power to ensure that my brother’s sexual perversions did not ruin our good name and now his daughter insists on repeating his mistakes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI sent Mr. Moore to collect Vera this afternoon after I’d received a call about her behavior from the very concerned mother of her most current lover. When he returned with her, I was waiting in the sitting room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “When we last had this conversation, you assured me that you would stay in line,” I said to her. “I have to ask, did you knowingly lie to me? Or was this simply the weakness of your character showing through?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVera did not answer me. She only stared, tense and afraid.\n\n  “Silence is not an answer,” I told her as I rose from my chair to pour myself a bourbon.\n\n  “I must know, do you do these things just to spite me? After everything I’ve done for you, taking you in, feeding you, clothing you, allowing you to live comfortably under my roof, is this the way you choose to repay me?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “I didn’t mean to…” Vera said quietly, “I’m sorry…”\n\n  “Didn’t mean to?” I repeated, “So this was a mistake, then? An accident? If so, dare I ask how this happened? What contrived series of events led your hand up her skirt? Please, do tell me. I’m quite curious. And while you’re at it, I’m sure you’ll also explain the lipstick on your neck.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVera paused, pressing a hand to her neck and looking away from me in shame.\n\n  “My father, your grandfather, spent his life working for this family,” I said. “Every night, he slaved away to keep us comfortable. His hard work permitted your father and I to grow up in relative comfort. He was the one who built this family up from nothing. It is because of him that we are where we are right now. Do you understand that? It is because of him that the Paisley name is respected today. However just as our father built up our legacy, all it takes is one weak link in the family to tear it all down. I would hate for that to be you, Vera. What a sad legacy it would be for the Paisley name to die out because of you.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI took a sip of my drink, watching as she shrank away from me.\n\n  “I promise, Uncle… It won’t happen again,” She said. Her voice small and meek.\n\n  “I’ve heard that before,” I replied, drawing closer to her. “Last time it was a lie. Why should I believe you this time?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “Will you lay off the girl?” A voice said from behind me. I turned to see Mary entering the room. She went to Vera’s side, putting a hand on her shoulder. My eyes narrowed at the sight of her. I should have expected her to come running the moment she’d heard Vera’s voice. Why she’d taken such a shine to the girl was beyond me… but I wasn’t about to let her my fiancee’s brat of a sister interrupt a private family affair.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “This doesn’t concern you, Mary,” I said. \n\n  “It does now,” she replied. “I’m not going to stand idly by as you drag this poor girl in and tear into her like that. Treat her with some goddamned dignity.” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI caught myself grimacing as she talked back to me and had half a mind to strike her across the face for it. But from the corner of my eye, I saw Lara watching us from the door. My fiancee took a drag of her cigarette, her emerald eyes burning into mine and making me think better of striking Mary. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “When she can behave with dignity, I’ll treat her with it,” I said and Mary just huffed at me, draping an arm over Vera.\n\n  “Come on. Don’t mind him.”\n\nShe led her away, through the door, and past Lara who kept her eyes trained on me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “You’re going to allow her to speak to me like that?” I asked once I was sure Vera and Mary were out of earshot.\n\n  “I saw no reason to stop her,” Lara replied, taking another drag of her cigarette, “We could hear you from across the house.”\n\n  “Could you? I didn’t believe I was being particularly loud,” I said.\n\n  “Oh, we have very good ears.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThrough the door behind her, I could see Mr. Moore out in the entrance hall looking in at us. The moment he realized I’d spotted him, he went back to pretending to work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood ears… rubbish.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “The girl needs to be disciplined,” I said. “If she were our daughter, you would want me to do the same.”\n\n  “If you think I’d allow you to speak to any child of mine that way, then you’re painfully mistaken,” Lara said stepping fully into the room and closing the door behind her. “I feel I should be clear with you, Christopher. While I have no doubts that you understand the necessary mutual benefits of our engagement, I cannot help but wonder if you’re failing to understand the expectations.” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “What expectations?” I asked, “I will be your husband. You will be my wife.”\n\n  “On paper, yes,” Lara said, “And when we are married, you will eventually be able to add the Darling Fashion house to the list of companies owned by your family. However, that does not mean I will allow you will speak to me with that level of disrespect.” \n\n  “So long as you stay in line, I won’t,” I assured her. Lara’s brow furrowed slightly. She took another drag of her cigarette.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “An attitude like that will not get you very far in life, Christopher,” She said. “And it will not get you very far with me. We are not married yet and you are not the only means my family has of expanding into the English market. You are replaceable. Do not forget that.”\n\n  “Respect is a two way street, my dear,” I warned her. “Do keep that in mind.”\n\nI left her there, returning to my office with my drink. I had work to complete and locked the door behind me so that I would not be disturbed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce again, I find myself complicating the necessity of marrying Lara Darling. I recognize that her family has considerable influence and a union between us would be beneficial to all parties. The Darlings have been looking for a way to get their product not only onto English shelves but onto the shelves of her colonies. My family can facilitate that. In many ways, we are a match made in heaven. I know that our marriage is not for the sake of love. In Lara’s own words, her family believes in blood ties. If I want to work with the Darlings, I must become part of their family. While I find the practice a little antiquated, I was not going to turn down such a lovely bride. Only a madman would say no to a woman with both fortune and beauty. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever in the month since she’s moved in, I’ve discovered that Lara herself is an incredibly strange and vexing creature. Outwardly she is quite beautiful with intense green eyes and honey blonde hair. Her face suggests Greek or Turkish heritage and in all ways, she is lovely to behold, yet she carries herself with a stiff posture that reminds me of a soldier. Her expression is usually cold and unsmiling. Her voice is low and almost always calm. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer sister is even more baffling. Why Lara insisted that Mary come with her remains unclear to me. Lara stated that she and her sister are simply very close. That much is evident to me, but I’m not convinced that it justifies bringing her from America to England with her. Does Mary not have her own romantic prospects elsewhere? It seems odd to me that a woman of her age has not been married off already, although whenever I have brought up the subject, Lara has dismissed it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn fact, she seems to dismiss most things when it comes to me. What use is a beautiful wife if she’ll have nothing to do with you? She sleeps in my bed and yet will not permit me to lay a hand on her. She eats my food but rarely speaks to me. Now she and her sister seem to be involving themselves in my private affairs with my family, questioning my methods of handling Vera’s indiscretions. Indiscretions that could well ruin their good name too if they came out! Where does one draw the line, I wonder?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I stew in my doubts, I find myself thinking back to the spring evening two months ago when I was first introduced to the sisters. One of my late father's business partners, Miss Bianca Lucia Di Cesare had arranged the introduction over dinner. Perhaps I may have been better off wedding one of Di Cesare’s daughters. Lord knows, she has girls to spare. Twelve, most unmarried, one deceased. Perhaps I might have been better off. Perhaps I may still be better off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo, no… It would not look right to call off the wedding. I will simply need to be stricter with my betrothed and her sister. I’ll simply need to teach them their place within my household. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Excerpt from the Journal of Christopher Paisley**\n\n**May 23rd, 1953**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLara continues to test my patience. Last night, she returned home around midnight. The sound of her entering our bedroom roused me from my slumber. \n\n  “Where have you been?” I asked her as she crossed the bedroom, discarding her handbag and her shoes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “Mary, Vera, and I were simply enjoying the culture of Belfast,” She replied, not even looking at me as she spoke, “Bianca is back in town. W had some drinks with her and a few of her girls.” \n\n  “Where?” I asked.\n\n  “A casino in town? ‘*La Sogno*’. You were there once, I recall.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLa Sogno. I recognized it. Owned by the husband of one of Di Cesare’s daughters.\n\n  “What gives you the right to take my niece out on your little excursions?” I asked.\n\n  “Your niece is twenty two. She’s entitled to make her own decisions,” Lara said, “Besides, Mary and I are still unfamiliar with Belfast. We enjoy having a guide and Bianca enjoys her company.”\n\n  “You took her to a bloody casino with your friends, you hardly needed a guide,” I snapped. Lara finally looked at me, her expression stern and disapproving.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “Have you read the papers, lately?” I asked, changing my approach.\n\n“Have you heard about the bodies that have turned up across town? In that same neighborhood. Grown men found with their throats slashed. One of them was even found not even a block from La Sogno. Think practically, Lara. It’s dangerous to be out so late at night. I’ll not allow you to risk your life or Vera’s!”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe actually chuckled at that. It was a humorless, hollow sound.\n\n  “Oh, does my husband worry for my safety now?” She asked, “How sweet. My heart flutters.”\n\n  “I’m simply saying, that part of town is hardly safe. I’ll be willing to bet that those men who were killed, were killed by thieves looking to steal the winnings of some lucky gambler. Were they to chance upon you, they would see you as an easy mark.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLara looked me in the eye now, her expression as calm as ever.\n\n  “I can assure you, Christopher, you’ve got nothing to worry about,” She assured me, “Mary, Vera and I are perfectly safe with Bianca. Now please. Go back to bed.”\n\nI was inclined to argue with her about this more, but she turned away from me to remove her earrings. With those off, she departed to the bathroom to change into her nightgown. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI read in the paper this morning that there was another death last night. A man was found with his throat slashed two blocks away from La Sogno. His blood had been completely drained.  I’ve contemplated showing the article to Lara, but what good will it do? She does not seem interested in listening to my concerns. I’m not sure if she’s simply foolhardy, or if there is some other reason for her confidence. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Excerpt from the Journal of Christopher Paisley**\n\n**May 24th, 1953**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs there no respite to be had from Vera and her childish behavior? When I awoke this morning, she was gone. She did not come down for breakfast when called and when I sent Mr. Moore to collect her from her bedroom, she was absent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI sent Mr. Moore to drive out onto the road looking for her, before searching the grounds of our estate with Mary and Lara. Shortly before ten, Mr. Moore returned with Vera in the back seat of his car. I had him bring her to my sitting room immediately so I could better understand what exactly it was that had gotten into her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “Where did you intend to go?” I asked, “Who did you think would take you in? That whore from a few days ago? Someone else? Or did you perhaps think you could make it on your own? Is that it?”\n\n  “I was going to Bianca’s,” Vera said, her voice cracked and trembling with impotent rage, “And if she didn’t take me, I’d find someplace else. Anywhere that wasn’t with *you.*”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI struck her with the back of my hand for that. She collapsed down onto the couch, clutching her cheek in pain. \n\n  “It’s because of me that you have a roof over your head,” I replied sternly. “It’s because of me that you live so comfortably. Your father? He did not have what it takes to maintain the business that our father started! Even if he had lived, he could not have ever provided for you as I have provided for you! You should be *thanking me* with your every breath! Do you know where you would be if it weren’t for me? Dead in the streets! Throat torn open and bleeding into the streets!”\n\n  “Fuck you,” Vera snarled and I raised my hand to hit her again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAn iron grip caught me by the wrist, and I turned to see Mary standing beside me.\n\n  “Enough,” She said. I tried to pull my hand out of her grasp, but she refused to let go.\n\n  “I will discipline this girl as I see fit,” I growled at her.\n\n  “Then I will discipline you, as *I* see fit.” Mary replied, eyes locked against mine. In fact, her expression almost perfectly mirrored the icy glare of her sister. Her attention shifted to Vera.\n\n  “Upstairs,” She said. “I’ll talk to you afterward.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVera didn’t wait around. Giving me one last bitter glare as she left the room. As my eyes met hers, I saw something in them that I hadn’t seen before. Not just anger. I knew what Vera’s anger looked like. This was something deeper. Something crueler. Hatred. Our eyes only met for a moment, then she was gone. Mary waited until her footsteps faded away before speaking again.\n\n  “And you wonder why she runs away from you?” She asked.\n\n  “I have treated that girl with nothing but kindness!” I snapped.\n\n  “Yes, that was very kind of you to leave that bruise on her cheek. Would you like me to do the same for you?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer grip on my wrist tightened, easing a cry of pain out of me. I hadn’t thought Mary was quite so strong before.\n\n  “You know the other night, all she talked about was you… How much she despised you, how every day living with you is a fresh new hell. I have to say, having spent the past month with you Christopher, I’m inclined to agree. Maybe it’s time you learned your place in this family… *what do you think?*”\n\nShe twisted my wrist, forcing me down onto my knees. I could see a cruel smile on her lips as slowly, she began to bend my wrist backward. The pain I felt grew more and more intense. I couldn’t stop myself from screaming and then…\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “Leave him.”\n\nMary paused, looking over to the door as Lara stepped inside. She sauntered past us, going straight for my liquor and pouring herself a gin and tonic. \n\n  “Why?” Mary demanded.\n\n  “Would you like to spend the next week or so listening to him complain about his broken wrist?” She asked, “Because, I suspect it would get very annoying after the first day or so.”\n\nShe took a sip of her drink, before pouring another one for Mary.\n\n  “The decision is yours of course. I just feel that it’s not very practical.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMary scoffed before letting me go. I collapsed to the ground, clutching my wrist in pain.\n\n  “Lay another hand on her, and next time I will break it,” She warned me before going to the bar. She snatched up her drink, took a sip, and then left. Lara watched her go before staring down at me. Then, she took a third glass and poured me a bourbon. \n\n  “This is the part where you say ‘*thank you.*’” She said.\n\nI just picked myself up and took both the glass she’d poured me and the rest of the bottle.\n\n  “Piss off,” I said breathlessly before leaving her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI called Mr. Moore into my office almost an hour later. \n\n  “Mr. Paisley, is there something I can do for you?” He asked, prim and proper as always.\n\n  “Sit,” I ordered and took another sip of my drink. Mr. Moore did as asked.\n\n  “Did Vera say anything when you found her this morning?” I asked, “Anything that might give you an idea as to why she left?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMr. Moore was silent for a moment. I wasn’t sure if he was struggling to recall what was said or trying to think up a lie.\n\n  “She said she needed to ask Miss Di Cesare some questions,” he finally said. “Regarding her father.”\n\n  “What would Bianca know about Julian?” I asked, “I don’t believe they ever met.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “If I recall, there were some… rumors around the time of Julian’s death,” Mr. Moore said. “Specifically regarding the nature of his injuries. Miss Di Cesare would have been quite aware of those, wouldn’t she?”\n\n  “He dove into the pool and hit his head. It was an accident,” I said dismissively.\n\n  “Yes, of course,” Mr. Moore said. “I told Vera as much myself. Although… I have always found one thing a little suspicious…”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI paused, looking over at him.\n\n  “He died so suddenly after telling you that he and I intended to leave together, didn’t he? Was it the next day, perhaps? Or maybe two days. I can’t quite recall.”\n\n  “An unfortunate coincidence,” I replied bitterly. \n\n  “Was it?” Mr. Moore asked, “All these years and I’ve wondered…”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “Whatever you’re insinuating, stop it,” I warned. “If you’d like to accuse me of something then you may find yourself unemployed and unwelcome on my property. Need I remind you how dangerous Belfast has been lately? I imagine an older gentleman like yourself might not fare well out on the streets. The next body they find out there could easily be yours.”\n\n  “Of course, sir.” Mr. Moore said, “I meant no offense.”\n\n  “Then don’t offend me again!” I snapped, “Keep your suspicions to yourself. You don’t need to share them with Vera and fill her head with stories of some inane conspiracy about her father's death…  am I clear?”\n\n  “Of course, sir.” Mr. Moore said, “Is there anything else?”\n\n  “No, get out of my sight,” I said and watched as he left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Excerpt from the Journal of Christopher Paisley**\n\n**May 24th, 1953 (Evening)**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did nothing wrong. I did NOTHING wrong. Julian was a disgrace. He didn’t deserve to be fathers favorite. He would have ruined the business. He never had the head for it. Ah, but since he was the eldest, father placed all the expectations upon him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh, how he would have rolled in his grave if he knew what Julian was! He would have disowned him, he *should* have disowned him! That dirty little bastard. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI knew something was wrong. Even before he’d gotten married, I knew something was wrong. The ‘friends’ he’d bring home. The obsessions that came and went. Something never quite fit with them. Not until after I realized what he was. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI’d caught him the first time when he was engaged. He’d brought home some man from a party and I heard them in his bedroom. Father never found out about it, I couldn’t bear to tell him. I couldn’t bear to tell his wife either. Oh, his wife… poor sweet Eileen. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI’ll bet he cheered the night she died. I’ll bet he held baby Vera in his arms and thanked her a thousand times for killing her own mother as she came out of the womb. Because in doing so, she set him free. Free to unleash hell upon the good name of our family. Free to destroy the legacy our father built! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be patient with him. I confronted him with the truth and begged him not to continue these indiscretions of his. But he refused to listen… and when he told me he was leaving with Moore of all people, *the fucking butler*, I couldn’t sit idly by anymore. He would have destroyed us. Our family, our legacy. He would have destroyed everything our father worked for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had no choice. It needed to be done for the sake of the family name. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJulian had already handed the business off to me. I’ve raised his daughter for ten years now.  I’ve tried to save her from going down the same path he did. What more can I do in penance? What more can I do? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI need another drink.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Excerpt from the Journal of Christopher Paisley**\n\n**May 27th, 1953** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don’t know what to do anymore. I feel as if I’m slowly losing control. Lara was out late again tonight. I sat up waiting for her to come in. She didn’t return until past three in the morning.\n\n  “Where in God's name have you been?” I demanded when I saw her coming in through the front door, Mary in tow behind her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMary shot me a look immediately, although Lara dismissed her with a wave of her hand. \n\n  “Enjoying my evening,” she said to me. “At La Sogno.”\n\n  “Until three in the morning?” I asked.\n\n  “Time slipped away from us. I would assume that you know these things tend to happen when you drink with friends, although I suppose you would first need to have friends in order to know that, wouldn’t you?” \n\n  “Enough!” I snapped, “I have asked you time and time again not to go out like this. Yet time and time again you have ignored me. I will not stand for this any further! If I tell you not to do something, then you *do not do it,* am I clear? Do you understand? I am your husband and you will respect my wi-”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLara’s hand shot out, catching me across the face. Her expression didn’t change from stoic disinterest as she slapped me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore I could recover, she’d grabbed me by the chin, forcing me to look into her eyes.\n\n  “Your wishes mean nothing to me, Christopher,” She said. “I am not obligated to defer to your requests. You and I may soon be husband and wife, but do not make the mistake of assuming this relationship is anything more than a business transaction. Do not assume that I can love you, because I feel nothing. Do not petition me for sex, because I have no interest in it. Once you and I are wed, then you and I will only see each other when it is necessary. Is that clear? You may keep as many mistresses as you please. Treat them as disposable pleasures or start families with them. It truly does not matter to me. But understand that from my perspective, you are simply a means to an end and with God as my witness, if you ever speak to me like this again, then it will be the last time you ever speak. You are not in control here, Christopher. *I am.*” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe let me go and turned away, heading for the stairs and leaving me shellshocked in the entrance hall.\n\n  “Who is he?” I finally asked.Lara paused a the top of the stairs, looking back at me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “He?” She asked, “You think I’m having an affair?”\n\n  “Are you?” I asked.\n\n  “Christopher, if I was having an affair, then why would I be bringing my sister with me?”\n\nI had no answer for that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWithout a further word, she disappeared down the hallway toward the bedroom. I watched her go before following her to bed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I reached the top of the stairs, I heard a door close to my left. I looked down the hall to see the light underneath Vera’s door go out. Had she been watching us? I wasn’t sure. A little closer to the stairs, I could see the door of my office hanging ajar and paused before deciding that I wasn’t ready to face Lara again. I wanted bourbon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd so I sit here now, scribbling down my thoughts beside this empty bottle. Reading back over my past entries, I can’t help but wonder if the events of these last few days are the symptom of a greater illness. I no longer feel like the master of my own home. I no longer feel like anything at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Excerpt from the Journal of Christopher Paisley**\n\n**May 28th, 1953** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was in my office when Vera came for me. I’d topped off my bourbon and was in the middle of some work when I heard the door open. I looked up, expecting Mr. Moore to be standing there, and was instead greeted by the sight of Vera, staring at me with those hate filled eyes of hers.\n\n  “Can this wait? I’m busy?” I asked before I noticed what it was she held in her hands.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA book. A book I recognized. My journal. This very book.\n\nI checked my desk only to find the drawer I kept it in empty. I looked back at her feeling my pulse start to race in my chest as I did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “I found this last night,” she said. There was a coldness in her voice that reminded me of the Darling Sisters, “I’ve been thinking a lot about something Bianca said to me the other night. About my father… about how she always thought his death sounded suspicious…”\n\n  “I’ve told you this before,” I said trying to keep my voice level. “Your father had an accident. He fell. He hit his head in the pool and fell unconscious. When we found him, he’d already drowned.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “Did he?” She asked, “Mr. Moore didn’t seem to believe that when I asked him about it. In fact, he said that you probably knew more… so I thought I’d find out for myself.”\n\nShe held up the journal shaking it lightly before opening it.\n\n  “I didn’t think I’d find anything but, I guess you were really drunk the other night. The handwriting is messier than usual but I can still make it out. A few days ago, you wrote: *‘I had no choice. It needed to be done for the sake of the family name.’* What exactly did you have no choice but to do?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “Vera, I was drunk!” I cried, rising up from my desk, “If you must know, Julian and I got into an argument. Yes… I never approved of his choice of romantic partners and I will admit, I was not happy when he announced he wanted to abandon this family to eke out a modest, miserable existence with the goddamned butler. But I did *not* murder him! It was an accident!”\n\n  “Then tell me what happened to my father!” Vera snapped, her voice cracking as she did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI glared at her, and she returned my glare with pure venom in her eyes.\n\n  “Our altercation got physical…” I said, the worst drifting out of my mouth. I couldn’t stop them. Then again, was there any point in lying to her anymore?\n\n  “I may have pushed him at one point. He fell. He hit his head. That much was never a lie,” I said, “Something needed to be done, he was already dead! Would you have preferred I hid the body? Left him in the walls to be wondered about and discovered by accident years later? I let him die with dignity!”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven as I said that, I remembered the way Julian had spoken my name as I’d dragged him toward the pool. I remembered hitting him again as he’d started to struggle before I rolled him over the edge and into the water.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVera still stared at me, her breathing growing heavier.\n\n  “Dignity…” she repeated.\n\n  “I did what I had to do!” I said, “If Julian had left, if people had found out about him they would’ve mocked us! We would have lost their respect! Everything our father worked for would have been ruined! Do you understand that? And if people thought that I had killed him, then things would have been even worse! I protected this family, Vera! I took you in. I raised you as my own! I have cared for you and done everything in my power to keep you from repeating his mistakes!”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “You murdered him,” Vera said. Her voice trembled and I could see her fighting back the tears of rage.\n\n  “Did you not listen to a *WORD* I just said?” I snarled. In my rage, I hurled the bottle of bourbon at her. It shattered against the wall behind her, making her flinch, “I protected him! I protected us!”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe just shook her head, taking a step back.\n\n  “I’m taking this to the police…” she said, backing toward the door. “I’m going to burn you to the ground, you miserable bastard… I swear to God…”\n\n  “You’ll do no such thing!” I hissed, rounding my desk and storming toward her. She turned to run, but I was faster. I caught her by the hair as she burst out into the hall, dragging her back into my office and throwing her against the nearby wall. I pulled the door closed and stood in front of it, blocking her escape.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “I have done *everything* for this family! You will *not* destroy everything my father built!”\n\nShe scrambled away from me, her feet scraping against the broken bottle I’d thrown. I saw her eyes dart down toward it and snatched the jagged neck of the bottle, holding it between her and I.\n\n  “Don’t touch me!” She cried.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI lunged for her. I felt a sharp pain against my cheek as she slashed at my face and I caught her by the wrist before she could cut me again. I forced her arm to the side before catching her in the face with a closed fist. Vera let out a pained cry, dropping my journal as I forced her up against the wall. I ripped the bottle neck from her hand and buried it into her stomach, over and over and over again. I could hear her muted gasp of pain. I saw her eyes widen as she realized that this was it. This was the end of her life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith one final grunt of rage, I slammed her against the wall, driving the broken bottle deep into her stomach one last time before ripping it out. I took a step back, panting heavily and watching as she slid down onto the floor, her hands clutched to her bloody stomach and her eyes fixated on me and filled with terror.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “Now look what you’ve made me do…” I said before picking up my journal off the ground. I stuffed it into my jacket pocket before looking down at Vera again. She wasn’t dead yet, but she would be soon. Her skin had gone an entire shade paler. I knew then that I couldn’t stay… I couldn’t hide this, the way I’d hidden Julian’s death. I’d need to leave Belfast. I could never return.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut first, I wondered if it would be kinder to slit Vera’s throat to finish her off or let her drift off as she bled out.\n\nBefore I could decide, I heard the door to my office open and froze.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI looked over to see Lara standing in the doorway, her hands folded behind her back and her cold green eyes focused on me.\n\n  “Lara…” I stammered, “I-”\n\n  “Quiet.” Her voice was as calm as ever. She stepped into the office, with Mary following in her footsteps. Lara’s eyes shifted down to Vera and I saw her lip pull back in disgust. Her attention returned to me and the silence between us suddenly seemed deafening. I could hear my very heart racing in my ears.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWithout saying a word, she looked at Mary who nodded before taking a step toward me.\n\n  “Stay back!” I warned, holding up the broken bottle, but before I could do much to react, Mary had me by the wrist again and this time she didn’t hold back. I felt the bones snapping as she twisted it, forcing me down to the ground again. The bottle slipped out of my hand and crashed against the ground. She let me go, staring down at me with a satisfied smirk on her face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “You’re more trouble than you’re worth, Christopher,” Lara said as she approached Vera. Vera just looked up at her, struggling to breathe. She watched as Lara crouched down in front of her, studying the wounds in her stomach. \n\n  “I had hoped you would see this opportunity for what it was. A necessary formality. Our company's product would enter a new market through your company's storefronts. You would be free to enjoy your life, free from the obligations of a marriage for as long as you chose. My sister and I would have moved on, leaving you to your own private affairs. If you’d asked me, I would have even granted you an amicable separation once I had everything I needed.”\n\n  “I was protecting my family…” I stammered.\n\n  “From what, Christopher? Idle gossip? Fulfilling relationships? What?”\n\nShe scoffed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “Well, it hardly matters now. My sister and I will be ‘protecting the family’ going forward and you… you will be protecting the gentlemen at La Sogno once Bianca departs next week. With you here, we won’t need to bother feeding on them.”\n\n  “What?” I asked and Lara looked at me again, baring her teeth at me. For the first time, I noticed just how long her canines were.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly it all clicked into place. Their late nights at La Sogno. The corpses that had been appearing around town. Oh God… They’d been feeding on people. They’d been living under my very roof and feeding on people, killing them! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd now they had me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking at Lara and Mary, I felt a primal terror swallow me whole, draining the color from my skin and making my heart race a thousand miles faster in my chest.\n\n  “So long as Mary and I pace ourselves, I don’t see why you couldn’t last us months or even years,” Lara continued. “I must confess, I have been wondering just how you might taste. I’ve been very generous in restraining myself so far. No more… but first things first.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer attention shifted back to Vera. She was still hanging on by just a thread. Her chest was rising and falling rapidly.\n\n  “He’s done such a number on you, hasn’t he?” She asked.\n\nVera gave a slow, half nod.\n\n  “How would you like to return the favor? I can save you Vera if you want me to.”\n\nVera’s eyes drifted over to me, watching me closely. Slowly, she nodded her head. For the first time, I saw a gentle smile cross Lara’s face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe held up her own wrist to her mouth and sank her teeth into it, drawing blood. Then she offered her bleeding wrist to Vera.\n\n  “Drink,” she commanded.\n\nAnd Vera drank, pressing her mouth to Lara’s wrist and swallowing greedy mouthful after greedy mouthful of her blood.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  “Don’t worry, even with three of us I can assure you that you will make it to our wedding,” Lara said, watching as Vera drank from her. “I can also assure you, that when you wake up every single morning, you will ask me to kill you and I will say *‘No.’*”\n\nVera pulled back from Lara's wrist, gasping for air. Her eyes were wide. Her shirt was still covered in blood but there was something different about her. She sounded like she was in both pain and ecstasy at the same time. She was changing. She was becoming one of them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd she would be feeding on me first.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe door to the office hung open before me. Mary was watching as Vera tuned. I had one opening and I took it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nScrambling on three limbs like an animal, I raced for the door. I saw Mary grab for me, but saw Lara reach a hand out to stop her. As I burst into the hall, cradling my broken wrist to my chest, I heard her voice call out after me.\n\n  “By all means, run, Christopher! Hide if you must! *But we will find you.”*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I tore down the stairs, I saw Mr. Moore watching me from the sitting room, a glass of my own bourbon in his hand. He raised it to me as a toast, smiling as I tore through the door and out into the night. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have found refuge in a small halfway house and in the time since I have escaped, I have written down all that I can remember. I will leave Belfast tonight. God willing, I will never see Vera or the Darlings again. I will not let them have me! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Note:*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The preceding journal was found during the demolition of the former Paisley Estate outside of Belfast, Northern Ireland. Records show that Mr. Paisley was married to Lara Darling in July of 1953. They had two daughters together, Mia and Lia Darling who would go on to operate both the Darling Fashion House and Paisley Menswear. On the recommendation of his wife as a result of concerns regarding Mr. Paisley’s failing mental health, he remained confined to his home until 1956 when he passed away due to an unspecified illness.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Due to Mr. Paisley’s history of mental health issues during his later life, the validity of this journal is still a matter of debate with many believing some of the later entries were symptoms of Mr. Paisley’s growing instability.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Vera Paisley left the UK in 1953 and records show she worked for the Di Cesare Jewelry company up until 1962.* *Curiously, no further records of her exist after* [*that.*](https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadOfSpectre/comments/10o34jg/i_died_on_june_9th_1982/)",

        "text": "“And there you have it,” I said to the blonde woman behind me. I could feel her gun pointed at the back of my skull. “Now we both have unspeakable secrets to hold over one another.” I wiped my face, inadvertently smearing the man’s blood across my lips. “[Is that enough to let me live](https://redd.it/10ngbrz)?”\n\nI wish I could have said that I stood with dignity as she decided my fate, staring stoically into a space where entire galaxies rise and fall without our awareness. Barring that, I would have liked say that I held a newfound appreciation for a life after coming face-to-face with my own mortality, enlightened with the knowledge of just how precious and fleeting existence truly is. \n\nBut all I could think about was the mouthfoam and twitching and shitting the man before me had gone through before collapsing into an undignified puddle that was rapidly approaching room temperature. I knew it was shitty of me, but all I cared about was ensuring that I didn’t sink so low. \n\nI took in halting breaths, wondering if a bullet against my skull would feel more like a wasp or a crowbar, pissing just a little, trying to prevent it from being a lot. My nose ran freely. \n\nAfter a few seconds, I was willing to take any sort of resolution, provided I didn’t have to continue waiting. \n\nBut I was too much of a coward to move.\n\nThe blonde woman sighed. Without looking behind me, I felt her relax. “Fine,” she breathed. “You’ve at least earned a reprieve for the amount of time it takes to walk outside.”\n\nMy breath shuttered as my nose and bladder released a little more. \n\nI struggled to speak.\n\n“If you’ve got something to say, out with it,” she groaned, the tension rising. \n\nFearing the silence, I forced myself to talk. “It’s – it’s almost funny… Santa’s been gone for a while now, but I think – um – I think that *this* is the scariest part.” I turned around.\n\nI recognized the look in her face then: she was just as afraid of me as I was of her. Nothing is so terrifying as what a normal person can become.\n\nSide by side, we walked through the sticky mess of blood, hair, and viscera that used to be our three companions. \n\nShe opened the door, and we stepped into the world.\n\nThe sun was shining despite the fact that I felt like it had no right to do so. I blinked, trying to understand why I was seeing something familiar. A sign above the exit door read “1913 Hope Street.” I looked behind me and saw the familiar landscape of Garfield Park.\n\nMy house was just three blocks away. \n\n“This is my home,” the blonde woman offered in a weaker voice than I’d thought possible. “I live in that apartment.”\n\nDiscomfort curdled in my stomach as I realized that all five of us had probably resided nearby. Dirty Santa wanted us to suffer close to home.\n\n“This moment,” I responded in a trembling voice, “is everything. After that experience, we’ll never see life the same way again. We’ll take this with us for the rest of our lives.” I ran a hand through my hair with shaking fingers.\n\nShe looked at me without blinking. Concrete silence stiffened between us. \n\n“You’re right,” she answered.\n\nAdrenaline flared in my stomach as she flexed the hand that still held a pistol.\n\nThen she raised the barrel to her temple and pulled the trigger.\n\nFor the fourth time in an hour, I witnessed a death that was far less dignified than I would have believed. Her jaw flapped, one leg jittered, and more blood poured from her skull crater than I thought a person could hold. She foamed at the mouth and vomited while pissing and shitting. \n\nThe kids in the park screamed.\n\nHer eyes stayed open the whole time. When they finished twitching, they were staring at me.\n\n-------\n\n\nThe police said that I was lucky to be the only one of five who lived. \n\nBut Santa also lived, and he got everything he wanted. I suppose he was the luckiest of all. They have no realistic hope of finding him. \n\nThe District Attorney told me that she won’t prosecute me for the man I killed. But his sister screamed that she’ll never forgive me, that I’ll never put this behind me, and she’ll never be whole again. \n\nIn the end, we gave Dirty Santa everything he wanted: we killed each other and ourselves. He did very little compared to our own actions. I doubt he even had a gun. Our phones and means of escape were with us the entire time.\n\nI wanted *so badly* to live. \n\nWhich forced me to ask myself why.\n\nI found the answer: the life I had before this guilt was pretty good. Not great, but certainly worth appreciating. I’ll never, ever have it again. Everything will be different until I die. No amount of drugs or therapy will erase it.\n\nSo I’m giving the man’s sister her wish. I can’t live with the guilt of being a murderer. I’m going to post this and then kill myself. I think I’ll use a knife in my throat. \n\nI deserve it.\n\nGoodbye.\n\n----------------\n\n [FB](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/)\n\n[BD](https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/)\n\n\n[W](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcn_pa1QfNMRzbTuJqXSoRQ)\n\n[E](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/)",

        "text": "We don't know exactly how or when it happened. \n\nWe dare not try.\n\nDigging deeper is far too dangerous.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhere did it begin?\n\nWas there one point of origin? Could we have prevented this?\n\nWe can never know. Not truly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I do have my theories.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAn adventurer looted something from a dungeon. From there, if it was vendor trash, they immediately sold it to a merchant. Or maybe the adventurer used it, until they got something better, and then sold it. I don't know for sure, but either way, we caused it. We should have seen the warning signs. I know why we didn't. Spot Checks generally fail when nobody thinks to perform them in the first place. All it took was for us to not look where we needed to. We were so stupid. I can't believe none of us saw it sooner.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know what to call it. Change Blindness. Inattentional Blindness. Weirdness Censor. Selective Obliviousness. Bystander Syndrome. We failed a spot check because it was so gradual, it became a part of our daily lives. Whole generations grew up not knowing certain phenomena they were living through in real time hadn't existed a hundred years prior. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo them, it was 'normal'. What would have alerted their ancestors, they took for granted. We were slowly desensitized to what will be our demise. Our perception was slowly filtered, inducing apathy instead of alarm. I want to say I can blame my ancestors. But up until a couple weeks ago, I was no different from them. When something new is introduced into the system of society, it is noted as new at the time. Generations of use turns it from new into 'it has always been that way'. It was not always this way. The changes can be traced.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe definitely could have seen it coming. We chose not to. We didn't realize the consequences. Oh Gods. The consequences of our arrogance. It wasn't a problem. Or so we thought. What could possibly have gone wrong?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, at some point, we reached the point of no return. The development of society spiraled in a way we can't recover from. It's too late. It's far, far too late. I don't know what to do. Nobody does. Not anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll I really can assume is it had to have started harmlessly enough. It sure doesn't feel that way anymore.\n\n# Magical Equipment:\n\nBack in the day, adventurers didn't start with any enchanted gear unless they were already ludicrously wealthy. The only way to obtain enchanted gear was from dungeon crawls. Even then, it was very rare, and risked carrying curses. What I wouldn't give for our situation to be just a curse cured by praying to the Gods. No matter how nasty the curse, at least we know how to treat those ailments. This? What happened...what can we do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn rarer occasions, existing equipment could through extraordinary circumstances gain enchantments. Eventually, we learned how to artificially replicate what was previously fluke occurrences. What was once accidental, we learned to do intentionally. We honed it to a science, perfecting the process of enchanting equipment of all kinds. To make profits, the more powerful and useful the equipment enchantments, the higher the cost, so despite the advances, nothing really changed for adventurers like myself. Most started with normal gear, the cheapest on the market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStill, an increased supply made it comparably easier for adventurers to buy or find enchanted gear earlier in their careers. Merchants and vendors of all sorts would buy obsolete equipment, mark the price up, and sell it to adventurers that'd treat the gear as an upgrade. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor questionable equipment not appraised, merchants might offer an increased price for their mystery equipment. In regulated areas, merchants who feared getting jail time for deceptive business practices instead offered these mystery items at a discount, so adventurers couldn't complain if the items ended up dangerous. \"You get what you paid for\". Oh, how we certainly did. I can't think of a more apt phrase.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis process lasted for hundreds, thousands of years unchanged. To this day, it still exists to some extent. The adventuring economy relied on this process, and nothing seemed amiss. For five years, I've followed in the steps of my predecessors in continuing these practices. I might be the last generation to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for where and why things changed? My theory goes, eventually, something disrupted the process, in a way an adventurer would have spotted if they were the one in charge. To our dismay, it was instead brokers. Dealers. Retailers. Handlers of the goods we adventurers relied on. If they had cared, if they had shown concern, maybe we could have averted this disaster. Their deception was simple, yet deadly. And we were all complacent in allowing it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMerchants began selling mystery equipment they didn't remember having in stock. Capitalism won over curiosity, and because adventurers enjoyed the cheap enchanted gear, they didn't investigate too closely. I've heard stories of our ancestors checking every piece of gear meticulously just in case it had some hidden property, but they didn't check these, and I can't bring myself to blame them. As an adventurer myself, I understand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBows which never broke.\n\nSpears which never snapped.\n\nStaves which never splintered.\n\nShields which never shattered.\n\nQuivers which never ran out of arrows.\n\nArrows which never split.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater, previously-rare bags of holding with a seemingly bottomless amount of storage space. It was just too good to give up. Rationally, they should've realized it was too good to be true. But I know the failings of our system now and at the time, they could justify ignoring the warning signs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere were dozens of ways for gear to gain those enchantments. Requiring a magical charge--not much, any adventurer's mana pool would be enough to power this--wasn't considered an unusual prerequisite for the enchantments to work. After all, magical equipment is magical. Without being given magic, it didn't seem unusual for damage to cause it to dissolve. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe obvious explanation was the equipment attempted to activate the enchantment and ate itself when no magic was present. It seemed reasonable enough, and fit within the rules we knew. As long as we fed our gear a supply of magic to feed their enchantments, the enchantments would work. Fail to give them the magic, and they would malfunction. Every adventurer knows how that works. I got taught it in adventuring school.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were ALL complicit. What are adventurers if not ruthlessly pragmatic? Any and every advantage, even if it is one we didn't fully understand, we could and would exploit. It's literally our job to find unconventional uses for everything. Equipment which was indestructible as long as it was given a magical charge any adventurer could give? How could any adventurer pass the opportunity up? The uses are endless! The mystery equipment was cheap, easy to use even by rookie adventurers, and very effective. While there was better enchanted equipment available, rookie adventurers would use these discount enchanted items until they had something stronger. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost traded the old gear for upgrades, but some kept their old rookie equipment. Even upon retirement, they would hang these hallmarks of their younger days on wooden mantles, placing them on the walls of whatever business they retired to run. Positions like innkeepers, bartenders, blacksmiths, merchants, and more. You name it, adventurers could retire to pick up that job, and they often had their gear to either pass on to the next generation or use *just in case* it was needed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter all, you never know! That old equipment could come in handy! I know I personally was planning to hoard *every* item I ever got and only give any up if I truly had no choice. Keeping my own set of starter enchantment gear was a no-brainer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWithin a generation, this enchanted gear was so common it became the starter equipment of every adventurer. My first set was entirely made of these, and I still use my bag of holding even while having upgraded my other gear. It's the standard. The norm. Many don't even bother with getting different upgraded equipment at all, spending their entire adventuring career using this basic starter equipment. If the starter gear still works, they reason, why replace it? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd it is an issue we're now stuck with. I don't even know if I regret it.\n\n# Detect Monster:\n\nDetect Monster used to be considered one of the most valuable, important spells in the arsenal of an adventuring party. It offered pinpoint precision on where monsters were, allowing an adventuring party to locate any and all threats to them. Dungeon crawls were much safer with liberal usage of the spell, alerting them to any danger before it would strike. It seemingly had no limits in what it could offer. The spell could find any threat and help neutralize it. From the smallest aggressive dragon to shapeshifters to subterranean burrowers to the mightiest of dragons flying high above in the sky.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, about three-hundred years ago, something incredibly confusing began to happen. The previously-precise spell started seemingly misfiring. Adventuring parties often could still find creatures which could potentially be classified as monsters. Passive creatures which would be caught by the spell when aggressive were the theorized culprits. The thought process was the Detect Monster spell had become too precise, classifying things which *could* be said to be monsters, as monsters, in spite of their harmless nature. Perhaps it even thought humans were monsters, because humans had the theoretical capacity to be monstrous.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNobody could figure out what the issue with the spell which was previously so valuable was. It had been refined over generations to be sure, since spells evolve just as much as equipment does. A mutation in the spell probably turned it from valuable to worthless over time. So the theory of my ancestors went. It seemed a reasonable conclusion. Perhaps we simply didn't want to accept the obvious. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWithin 20 years, adventurers had adapted to the spell's reduced usefulness, eventually learning to use other methods of scouting and tracking to compensate for the loss of a previously-essential spell. I didn't need to learn it, but my innate thirst for knowledge led me to still picking it up.\n\n# Society's Advancement:\n\nKingdoms rise, kingdoms fall. Wars are fought, cities fall, new cities are built. Cultures change as new inventions are pioneered. Various factors reduce the growth of worldwide population. War, famine, disease, monster raids, natural disasters, etc. However, overall, the population of the world has been slowly increasing. With an increased population comes an increased need for housing. As advancements in city defenses, medicine, production, transportation, and diplomacy have led to longer lifespans, industry expanded to match the need of more lodging. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdventurers used to have an average life expectancy of 20-30. Now, people like me are expected to live an average of 60-70 years, not much lower than the general population. We've gotten better at surviving what would previously have killed us. I know I've fought battles which would've killed me if I lived through them even as little as one-hundred years ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWagons, once considered luxuries only rich merchants could use, became mass-produced. There were so many wagons around, you could often pick up a wagon from any given road, where people would leave wagons they didn't need, so those who did could pick them up. With the increase in transportation came an increase in the ability to transport goods en masse in crates and barrels. With land transportation having expanded, sea transportation followed. Great galleons formed to traverse sea and river alike with ease.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTaverns were built seemingly overnight at crossroads. Initially not manned, but filled with permanent staff soon enough. Quite a few of these crossroad taverns would later form the central foundation of cities, including my home town! I've been ingrained in this culture my whole life, learning the history of this expansion quite well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInns, blacksmiths, and more were renovated. These new lodgings each had a seemingly endless amount of room. Inns always had at least one more room for travelers. I've never gone to an inn and not found myself having a room available, offering comfort from some of the softest beds I've ever been on, and the warmth of a fire somehow perfectly burning at a temperature tailored to my preferences.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStorehouses always had room to fit the latest shipments of supplies needed. New houses were built, and older buildings were slowly demolished and replaced with buildings designed to match the aesthetic of the newer buildings. These buildings were built over the course of days, primarily made from wood. Their walls might have been thin, and they were too close together, and they weren't pretty, but they could be built quickly and cheaply by construction conglomerates. Slowly, as cities expanded, we watched as all of our buildings were gradually transformed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBuildings always had plenty of furnishings. There was always enough tables, chairs, utensils, beds, and more. While there were many having dissatisfaction at the conformity of the newer buildings, people didn't object to the convenience they provided. They might not have looked pretty, but they were functional. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPersonally, I've seen photos of how things looked before and I always thought they were better in the past, but I didn't have any rational reason why. Objectively, the newer versions should've been better. Spacious, filled with supplies, and cheap in both time and materials to build. Conformity allowed for cities to more precisely plan and regulate their growth, tracking what buildings would be placed where, and how they would fit. I recognized the value of it all, but it still somehow felt wrong. By my time we had no say though; that's just the way things are for us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt some point, construction guilds began rotating crews, assigning multiple teams to complete their work. It became the standard for something being finished to be assumed as simply being a different team, ahead of schedule. Projects thought to take years would take months. Months, in weeks. Weeks, in days. Small day-long ones could even be done in hours. This efficiency rose from a similar shift in supply lines.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShipments of goods in wooden boxes often arrived early, and in excess of the requested amount. Lumberjacks were clearly working hard, and all areas of society using wood products were thriving. Carpenters never ran out of items to sell, faced with a constant increase in demand to match the expansion of society. They became more focused on selling than on crafting, but still found the time to keep up their supplies. Nobody really knew how, not even the overworked carpenters, but it was highly prestigious.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe march of civilization was also the march of capitalism. Standardization made everything faster, cheaper, easier. And while it was taxing to those in the industry, they figured they'd always have enough business. They sold more and more of their wares, and business was good. It still is, if you're able to ignore what they did. A glaring error anyone not exhausted by the tax our money-driven world placed on them could have caught, but left unseen because they simply had other things on their minds. It was easy to miss, when not looking for it.\n\n# The Change In Crime:\n\nWith the advancement of society, crimes advanced as well. Criminals had to evolve, or die. Many chose die. It served them right, society figured, because crime is crime. Nobody really has sympathy for criminals dumb enough to get caught or killed. The rest got smarter, much smarter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome crimes disappeared from society seemingly overnight. Piracy went extinct. Bandits stopped raiding wagons. Arson stopped happening. Vandalism vanished. While thievery remained, burglaries and wagon larceny stopped occurring. We never figured out why some crimes stopped happening, but we certainly weren't going to complain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe tradeoff, however, was a vastly increased rate of murder and missing persons reports. Remains were never recovered, but whenever blood splotches were found, it wasn't hard to guess what had happened. How these corpses were so reliably disposed, nobody knew. A prevailing theory was \"they didn't actually die\". The would-be perpetrators being forcefully disincentivizing from following through. We didn't know why anyone would bother with stopping those crimes, but it was plausible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe vigilantes became sick of the ruffians. Maybe the advancement of society made those crimes be harshly punished by the underworld. Perhaps law enforcement went above and beyond their call to duty. Since most of the missing were miscreants, we didn't care; we were complacent. As far as we were concerned, crimes disappearing and criminals going missing could only have been a good thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA common thought was relocation. People move all the time. Blood indicated it was likely forceful, but being forced to leave a city isn't unusual, people have been doing that for as long as we've had cities. Nobody really wanted to dig too deep into their disappearances. There were plenty of harmless mundane explanations. As long as the victims were unsavory individuals, we willingly looked the other way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe criminal underground certainly evolved rapidly around this time. Far more secretive, far more organized, far more care taken. Reckless abandon no longer served them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNobody doubted why. It seemed obvious. Society's changes meant the old ways were too dangerous for aspiring new criminals. So for a long time, we assumed all the disappearances, all the missing persons, were those who deserved it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMany of the most crazy conspiracy theorists insisted on investigating these disappearances, but when someone proposes theories like \"aliens abducted them\", \"our world is a simulation and golem overlords delete unsavory elements\", and similar outrageous ideas, it's hard to take their lunatic ramblings with any degree of seriousness. Their ideas were clearly outrageous, and easily disproven. So we didn't pay attention to their ramblings. We listened just long enough to dismiss them whenever a far simpler, more rational explanation arose.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually, religious fanatics got ahold of the news, and insisted they spoke for the gods about an emerging threat. The disappearances weren't natural, they were a warning sign, and the end of days would be upon us all if we didn't listen to them. We were all going to be doomed, they claimed. We had to listen to the gods and pay attention to the signs, they said.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt didn't take long for these nutjobs to join the list of those we dismissed. When they eventually went silent, we assumed it was an inability for them to back up their theories. The end of the world never came to pass, or so we thought. The out-there theories of the crazies and the rantings of overly-'pious' preachers were something we collectively discarded, and the disappearances of those individuals didn't attract any attention.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really don't want to endorse conspiracy theorists here, but on very rare occasions, sometimes, they can be on to something, and if we had paid closer attention to their vanishing, maybe we could've done something. But I suspect even by then we stood no chance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMissing persons after a generation of change leveled out. They still happened, but at a lower rate. They became normalized. We accepted them as a given, as something happening to those not learning from history.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOccasionally, there would be warehouse and retail workers joining the long list of missing persons. The merchants' guilds they worked for, as well as those supporting the merchants' guilds, insisted the disappeared individuals either left of their own volition, or perhaps fell into the way of crime.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPublic outrage ensued, and investigations followed, yet nothing proved them wrong. Distrust in the corporations rose, but since there was no proof of foul play, it eventually morphed to be an understood risk of the profession.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn some occasions, patrons disappeared from taverns and inns, assumed to have checked out early without anyone noticing. Since adventurers die all the time, nobody bothered following through.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh Gods. How many times did I come close to being among them. It's...unsettling. Why did we accept people vanishing into thin air and random blood spots as a given?",

        "text": "Looking back, I should’ve known he was a predator. A drug dealer posting up outside of the Sleep Disorders Center? That’s baiting. Might as well fall under the same rules as spotlighting deer to hunt them.\n\nFor years, I depended on Melatonin to put me to sleep. 1 mg, taken at 9 p.m. did the trick. But 1 milligram turned into 3, and 3 turned into 5. When I hit 10 mg, the stuff stopped working altogether. It didn’t matter that I quit blue-light after 6 p.m. It didn’t matter that I never worked in the same room I slept. No amount of sleep hygiene could fix me.\n\nSo, I switched to Benadryl. Taking 50 mg of the little pink pills worked for a spell, but not for long. I upped it to 75. Then 100. Then 150.\n\nOnce, In a desperate attempt to get some much-needed shut-eye, I downed half a bottle of the liquid. I don’t know the dosage. It was easily over 300 mg. It was nightmare fuel, and I never did it again.\n\nI saw where all this was going, so I booked an appointment with my General Practitioner. She was horrified to hear I was depending on diphenhydramine to put myself to sleep, and she put in an order to a specialist. Shockingly, the wait list wasn’t long, so I scheduled an initial consultation.\n\nI discussed my symptoms with an attentive, hawk-eyed man who sported salt and pepper hair that belied a sophisticated professionalism. When I walked out into the autumn air, I felt optimistic about my prognosis.\n\nThat is, until I saw *him.*\n\nHe was leaning against the trunk of my Honda Civic, sucking on a Parliament cigarette. Seeing that got my ire up. I’d *just* bought that car, for crying out loud. In hindsight, I think he was actually waiting for me.\n\nI narrowed my eyes on the man. He was probably five foot six and couldn’t have weighed more than a buck twenty five. He had on a draping, zip-up hoodie that was open over a white t-shirt. His baggy pair of brown khakis was cinched by a belt buckle that was three sizes too large. And that belt buckle was *way* too close to scratching the fresh paint on my new car. I opened my mouth to cuss him out, but he spoke first.\n\n“You want some of the dwarf wine, kiddo?” He said, not bothering to meet my eyes.\n\nIt sounded patronizing and sexist.\n\n“Dwarf wine?” I shot back. “Is that some kind of sick innuendo, you fucking Smurf?”\n\nAs soon as I said it, I regretted it. It was immature. But the guy was smoking while practically sitting on my bumper. If he wanted to bandy words with me, I’d make them sting. To my surprise, he didn’t seem daunted in the slightest.\n\n“They don’t got the meds you want in there, honey,” he said in a gravelly voice. “They can’t put ya to sleep. I seen people like you come outta those doors a thousand times. Bright eyed, full of hope. Any guesses on the typical solution they come up with for insomniacs, narcoleptics, and patients with sleep apnea? It’s all the same. Go ahead, guess.”\n\nI felt my throat tighten and swallowed hard.\n\n“I suppose they likely begin by running tests to rule out diagnoses,” I started, keeping my voice calm and collected. “Then they’re likely to start a regimen—“\n\nThe bearded man threw back his shaved head and gave a boisterous belly laugh. He grabbed at the small amount of belly he had as he shook with mirth.\n\n“Sorry,” he stammered out when his laughter finally broke off. “I don’t mean anything by my laughin’. It’s just…there ain’t no ‘regimen’ involved. It’s a one-size-fits-all solution. They call it Modanafil. They’ll prescribe a medication. Probably Provigil, but it could be a generic. Anyway, the thing is to be taken each morning to help with wakefulness.”\n\nI felt a line deepening between my eyes.\n\n“Why would they prescribe a stimulant for someone who can’t sleep?” I shot back.\n\nHe pointed an arthritic finger at me and clicked his tongue.\n\n“That’s the right question, sweetheart,” he said. “But they’ll say it’s to keep you up all day and improve your quality of life. The truth of it is…the thing is a pro-drug for amphetamines. It’ll make you wired all day. The hope is you drop from exhaustion when the drug wears off. How’s that sound?”\n\nI stifled a shudder, unsure where this was going.\n\n“Well, I suppose they’re the experts,” I began to say. I was interrupted by the man shaking his head in an almost comically animated way.\n\n“They ain’t experts,” he said, decisively. “Buncha quacks. I got the real medicine. It’ll put you to sleep and it’ll heal your soul. You ever hear of Amanita Muscaria?”\n\nI shook my head and let my hand stray to my cell phone inside my clutch, just in case I had to call the cops on this weirdo.\n\n“Fly agaric?” He asked. “Dwarves' Wine? Reindeer piss?”\n\nHe let out a chortle and pulled out a white paper bag. He opened it and I gazed inside. What I saw, ironically, was something I knew. The red-capped mushrooms with white spots were recognizable immediately.\n\n“You want to sell me magic mushrooms, is that it?” I asked. “Shoot. Nothing in DARE prepared me for this. Unbelievable.”\n\nThe man extended the bag towards me.\n\n“Magic?” he asked. “I suppose so. Sell? Nah. The first one’s free. ‘Specially for a gal as easy on the eyes as you, princess.”\n\nI felt sick to my stomach. I clicked the button on my car’s key fob, and the door unlocked.\n\n“I think I’ll pass, but thanks,” I said dismissively.\n\nI opened my car door, and (thank God) he didn’t hassle me or stand in my way. I turned the car in the ignition and its engine roared to life. I saw the bearded drug dealer motion for me to roll down the window. Since he’d been more or less respectful up ‘til this point, I decided to oblige him.\n\n“The name is Spence,” he said. “And if I haven’t put you off my ideas too much, I have just two favors to ask.”\n\nMy curiosity was piqued. He took my silence as a tacit invitation to continue.\n\n“Number one, when they prescribe you Modafinil, remember that I was right,” he said. “And number two, research fly agaric and see if these mushrooms are hallucinogenic. Then, compare that with the legal speed they want you to have.”\n\nI pursed my lips in a stilted, polite way.\n\n“Will do, Spence,” I said. “And if I come to the realization that buying mushrooms from a stranger who’s smoking against my car is the answer to all of my problems, how am I supposed to seek you out?”\n\nHe smirked.\n\n“You won’t have to,” he said. “Have a nice day, lady.”\n\nWith that, he turned on his heel and walked away.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nFor about a month, I barely thought about Spence again. I did look up the types of mushrooms he was peddling. They weren’t the typical Magic Mushroom ilk (psilocybin cubensis.) It was also true that they weren’t physically addictive. But that research was a mere curiosity, and the memory of the strange, wizened old man quickly passed.\n\nThat is, until I met with the sleep doctor again. He clicked his pen and jotted something onto a sheet of paper.\n\n“I’m writing you a script for Modanafil,” he said in a clipped tone. “It’ll improve quality of life by making you more wakeful in the day. By proxy, your sleep will improve. Where is your preferred pharmacy?”\n\nI blinked twice, saying nothing. My ears had perked up at the drug’s name. My mind raced back to Spence. I continued the rest of my doctor’s visit on autopilot, taking the prescription and scheduling my follow-up.\n\nBut by the time I reached my car in the parking lot, Spence was leaned against my trunk with a Devil-may-care grin on his face.\n\n“First one’s free!” He reminded me, as he shook the white paper bag.\n\nI swear I saw myself in third person, extending my arm, taking the bag of mushroom caps. I’m not sure I had any freewill in the matter. Regardless, I took his offering, thrust it into my coat pocket, and walked wordlessly to my car. I drove straight home.\n\nThe mushrooms stayed on my nightstand, untouched, for a couple days. I wrestled my guardian angel on the subject. After a few nights of tossing and turning, my will began to falter. The fly agarics called for me like the quotidian forbidden fruit in the garden of Eden. I grabbed the bag and picked up one of the caps, running my hands across the bumps on its head. I could almost hear Spence’s voice hissing in my ear, imploring me to take a bite.\n\n*Fuck it,* I thought. *I need the sleep.*\n\nI looked up the best way to prep the things. I debated straining them into a tea or baking them into muffins. In the end, probably because of a profound lack of patience, I settled on just noshing them down and chasing them with some OJ.\n\nThey tasted like death, and I started beating myself up as soon as they were down the hatch.\n\n*What the hell is wrong with you?* I chastised myself. *Some stranger offers you illicit drugs and you take them? Who knows what he put on or in those things.*\n\nBut therein lies the rub: I couldn’t find a suitable motive for Spence, other than money. I would’ve never downed the mycelium with him nearby, lest he’d laced it with some kind of date rape drug. But since I was alone in the privacy of my own home, I could rule that possibility out. So he only stood to gain something if I was a repeat customer. And I’d only *be* a repeat customer if these things worked.\n\nAt least, those were the stories I told myself as I filled my electric kettle and flipped it on. I pulled a box of chamomile from my kitchen cupboard and set it on the counter. Strolling to my living room couch, I settled in with a book, draping a wide-weave apron across my shoulders. I felt warm and cozy until the caps hit my gut. Next thing I knew, I was sweating profusely, fighting nausea like my life depended on it.\n\nThe electric kettle whistled and I stood up to attend to it. The room spun and my stomach did somersaults.\n\n*Alright, maybe not,* I told myself, dropping back onto the sofa. *That’s okay. The kettle will shut itself off automatically. I don’t have anywhere I need to be.*\n\nMy eyes roved around the living room. The visuals weren’t much to speak of, but everything—my lamp, the bookcase, the picture frames hanging on the wall—they all took on a rubbery appearance. My terrier, Jackson, perked up his ears and cocked his head at me, probably wondering if I was okay.\n\nI can’t explain it, but Jackson looked comically small. Maybe a quarter of his usual size. I chuckled a little under my breath at that thought, and realized the nausea was subsiding.\n\nMy body sunk into the loveseat and I noticed my eyes felt as heavy as lead.\n\n*I do believe I’m a little drowsy,* I told myself.\n\nAnybody with insomnia can attest to the fact that sleepiness *immediately* dissipates on the short walk from a couch to a bed. I decided not to risk it. I let my eyelids drop and I drifted into slumber.\n\nImmediately, my mind was transported to the most vivid, lucid dreamscape I’d ever witnessed. I was standing upon a red, velvet carpet, still wearing my satin nightgown and slippers. The carpet stretched down a corridor as far as the eye could see. The floor was white marble and the walls and ceiling were the same. Rose gold crown molding lined the hallway, delicately carved in ornate designs.\n\nI took a few steps forward and craned my neck to inspect it. I saw the familiar image of “The Creation of Adam” by Michelangelo, except rather than touching Adam’s finger with his own, God was handing him an Amanita Muscaria mushroom. I rolled my eyes. It looked like the cheesy stoner artwork you’d see on a t-shirt in a headshop.\n\nExcept, this version was intricately cut from gold.\n\nIntrigued by this, I began pacing the length of the hallway, looking at the gold crown molding to see what other scenes were depicted. I strolled past a golden Sphinx and the great Pyramids. I saw the Coliseum and the assassination of Julius Caesar. My eyes roved over images of so many architectural marvels and historic events. As I walked, I witnessed the entire march of human history play out in gold-relief. Machu Picchu and Easter Island and the Magna Carta. A few of the figures and events I *didn’t* recognize…which I attest to my woefully inadequate history education.\n\nFinally, I came to the moon landing in 1976, and then a carving I didn’t recognize right away. It was a woman with long hair in loose curls. She wore a satin nightgown and slippers. I swallowed hard, knowing it was me. I squinted up at the creature on the gold carving that stood behind the carved, golden depiction of me. It was a massive minotaur, easily eight feet tall.\n\nA jolt of cold-lightning shivered up my spine. I could feel its hot breath on my neck. I didn’t need to turn around to know what I’d see. I did anyway.\n\nA massive, bison-like face bowed. The dumb, bovine brown eyes of what I assumed to be non-sentient creature stared back at me.\n\n“Your knowledge of history may be lacking, but your mythology is not,” he bellowed out in a deep voice. “I want out as bad as you do.”\n\nHis massive catcher’s mitt of a hand curled around the shaft of a battle-ax. A bestial and unearthly scream loosed itself from my lips, and I sprinted down the hallway. I didn’t even take a fleeting glance at the decadent crown molding, even though I knew the images depicted as I ran past them told of events yet to happen.\n\nMy legs beat against the marble floor, as I pumped my arms and strained ahead. My heart raced and my lungs burned, but still I didn’t let up. Even as I ran, I could feel the minotaur’s breath on my neck. It was rancid with the smell of sulfur.\n\nChest still heaving, I realized I couldn’t outpace the beast. His gait was too wide and his legs too strong. My eyes darted around the hallway, and I saw a doorway about ten feet ahead. I hoped against hope that the thing was unlocked. I threw myself forwards, and the doorknob spun in my sweaty palm. I felt the thrill of exultation as the door swung on its hinges and opened inwards. I flew through the open door, slamming it in the minotaur’s face. I whirled around in hopes of finding something to bar the door, when I saw the sad smile of the selfsame minotaur. Inexplicably, he was on *my* side of the door.\n\n“I just shut you out!” I screamed, nonsensically at the beast. “You aren’t supposed to be in here!”\n\nHe shook his massive head and looked more melancholy than terrifying.\n\n“I want out, miss,” he said politely. “Would you take me out of this place?”\n\nThinking quickly, I dove headfirst between his legs, sliding across the marble and scrambling to my feet to make my escape. This hallway looked identical to the last, except there were doors lining the walls every five feet. I picked the first door on the right and bolted through it. It was identical to the second hallway. I decided to go with the same approach: I lunged at the first door on the right and threw it open.\n\nStanding before me was an identical hallway with doors every five feet. My mind reeled.\n\n“B-but that doesn’t make any sense,” I stammered out. “This hallway ought to intersect with the first I was in. The floorplan of this place, just doesn’t—”\n\n“Begging your pardon, miss,” the minotaur said, somehow right beside me now. “But a labyrinthine dreamscape doesn’t need to follow the laws of Euclidean geometry. It doesn’t owe you that.”\n\nA bloodcurdling scream rose from my throat, and I sprinted at a door at random: this one was two doors away and on the left. When I opened it, the entire frame was filled with the massive head of the minotaur.\n\n“That’s not the way out, miss,” he said, in a sweet, if not condescending tone.\n\nI licked my lips as my throat constricted.\n\n“Then what *is* the way out?!” I screeched.\n\nThe minotaur’s massive, muscley man-chest rose once and fell with a deep sigh.\n\n“You are the mythic Daedalus, miss,” he said. “And you’re also the labyrinth. And you’re also the giant beast. That is to say, you are me. Please. Let’s go home.”\n\nMy pupils widened and my jaw clenched.\n\n‘No!” I barked out in disbelief. “If I’m dreaming, then I’ll just wake myself up!”\n\nHis eyes darkened and for the first time, the minotaur looked genuinely scared.\n\n“I wouldn’t do that if I were you, miss,” he interjected firmly. “They say if you die in a dream, you die in real life.”\n\nI rolled my eyes.\n\n“If that were the case, the reciprocal would be true,” I shot back, derisively. “You live in a dream. But you don’t live in real life, now do ya?”\n\nThe beast cocked his head.\n\n“Of course I do, miss,” he said softly. “In your life, I’m *you.* You are my avatar in that world just like I’m your avatar in this one. All I was hoping was that I might come with you. I hoped we might merge our realities, for once.”\n\nMy voice caught in my throat and I felt my mind slipping. I let out an unearthly, shrill laugh and shook my head.\n\n“Nope!” I yelled. “No, no, no, no, no. I’ll tell ya what I’m going to do. I’ll crack my skull open like an egg on these marble floors. I’ll spill my brains ‘til I’m good and dead, and that will wake me up!”\n\nI dropped to my knees and swung my head like a wrecking ball at the floor, hearing the crunch of bone on marble as I laughed maniacally.\n\n“But you wanted so badly to finally sleep,” the minotaur said, furtively. “I would’ve thought you wanted to stay awhile.”\n\nI wasn’t listening, but continued to bash my head mercilessly against the floor as a mix of blood and gray matter leaked from my wounds. I cackled like a witch as my life-force slowly drained from my body. The last thing I saw was the morose face of the minotaur as he crossed his arms over his chest.\n\n“Until we meet again, miss,” he said as my vision faded to black. “You take care of yourself out there.”\n\nI woke up with a start on my living room couch.\n\n*What the fuck?* I thought to myself. And then I repeated it in my head time after time, like some backwards, bastardized mantra: *What the fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck?*\n\nMy nightgown was sticky with sweat, and it clung to my skin as I sat upright on my loveseat. My eyes strayed to the analog clock hanging on my wall. 7:54 a.m.\n\n*No way,* I thought. *But that would mean—*\n\nI’d slept 9 straight hours, at least. Completely uninterrupted. I hadn’t done that since…well, truthfully, I couldn’t recall the last time I’d done that.\n\nWhat was even more odd was how I felt. Despite the absolute fever-dream of a night, I felt refreshed and rested. I was so wide awake that I skipped my morning coffee entirely. I took a jog through the park, tidied up my living room, and folded all of my laundry before noon. My productivity didn’t taper down until late evening.\n\nTo my immense displeasure, I realized I was out of mushrooms. As much as I dreaded going back to *that place* in my dreams, the refreshment I drew from the stuff was worth it. I decided I’d try to find Spence again the next day to nab some more.\n\nLittle did I know, the trajectory of my life was already set. I’d already irrevocably damned myself to a living hell. By reaching out to Spence a second time, I wasn’t changing my life for the worse. I was merely speeding up the descent. Things were already heading south. But what was about to come was utter freefall.",

        "text": "Looking back, I should’ve known he was a predator. A drug dealer posting up outside of the Sleep Disorders Center? That’s baiting. Might as well fall under the same rules as spotlighting deer to hunt them.\n\nFor years, I depended on Melatonin to put me to sleep. 1 mg, taken at 9 p.m. did the trick. But 1 milligram turned into 3, and 3 turned into 5. When I hit 10 mg, the stuff stopped working altogether. It didn’t matter that I quit blue-light after 6 p.m. It didn’t matter that I never worked in the same room I slept. No amount of sleep hygiene could fix me.\n\nSo, I switched to Benadryl. Taking 50 mg of the little pink pills worked for a spell, but not for long. I upped it to 75. Then 100. Then 150.\n\nOnce, In a desperate attempt to get some much-needed shut-eye, I downed half a bottle of the liquid. I don’t know the dosage. It was easily over 300 mg. It was nightmare fuel, and I never did it again.\n\nI saw where all this was going, so I booked an appointment with my General Practitioner. She was horrified to hear I was depending on diphenhydramine to put myself to sleep, and she put in an order to a specialist. Shockingly, the wait list wasn’t long, so I scheduled an initial consultation.\n\nI discussed my symptoms with an attentive, hawk-eyed man who sported salt and pepper hair that belied a sophisticated professionalism. When I walked out into the autumn air, I felt optimistic about my prognosis. \n\nThat is, until I saw *him.*\n\nHe was leaning against the trunk of my Honda Civic, sucking on a Parliament cigarette. Seeing that got my ire up. I’d *just* bought that car, for crying out loud. In hindsight, I think he was actually waiting for me.\n\nI narrowed my eyes on the man. He was probably five foot six and couldn’t have weighed more than a buck twenty five. He had on a draping, zip-up hoodie that was open over a white t-shirt. His baggy pair of brown khakis was cinched by a belt buckle that was three sizes too large. And that belt buckle was *way* too close to scratching the fresh paint on my new car. I opened my mouth to cuss him out, but he spoke first.\n\n“You want some of the dwarf wine, kiddo?” He said, not bothering to meet my eyes.\n\nIt sounded patronizing and sexist. \n\n“Dwarf wine?” I shot back. “Is that some kind of sick innuendo, you fucking Smurf?”\n\nAs soon as I said it, I regretted it. It was immature. But the guy was smoking while practically sitting on my bumper. If he wanted to bandy words with me, I’d make them sting. To my surprise, he didn’t seem daunted in the slightest.\n\n“They don’t got the meds you want in there, honey,” he said in a gravelly voice. “They can’t put ya to sleep. I seen people like you come outta those doors a thousand times. Bright eyed, full of hope. Any guesses on the typical solution they come up with for insomniacs, narcoleptics, and patients with sleep apnea? It’s all the same. Go ahead, guess.”\n\nI felt my throat tighten and swallowed hard.\n\n“I suppose they likely begin by running tests to rule out diagnoses,” I started, keeping my voice calm and collected. “Then they’re likely to start a regimen—“\n\nThe bearded man threw back his shaved head and gave a boisterous belly laugh. He grabbed at the small amount of belly he had as he shook with mirth.\n\n“Sorry,” he stammered out when his laughter finally broke off. “I don’t mean anything by my laughin’. It’s just…there ain’t no ‘regimen’ involved. It’s a one-size-fits-all solution. They call it Modanafil. They’ll prescribe a medication. Probably Provigil, but it could be a generic. Anyway, the thing is to be taken each morning to help with wakefulness.”\n\nI felt a line deepening between my eyes.\n\n“Why would they prescribe a stimulant for someone who can’t sleep?” I shot back.\n\nHe pointed an arthritic finger at me and clicked his tongue.\n\n“That’s the right question, sweetheart,” he said. “But they’ll say it’s to keep you up all day and improve your quality of life. The truth of it is…the thing is a pro-drug for amphetamines. It’ll make you wired all day. The hope is you drop from exhaustion when the drug wears off. How’s that sound?”\n\nI stifled a shudder, unsure where this was going.\n\n“Well, I suppose they’re the experts,” I began to say. I was interrupted by the man shaking his head in an almost comically animated way.\n\n“They ain’t experts,” he said, decisively. “Buncha quacks. I got the real medicine. It’ll put you to sleep and it’ll heal your soul. You ever hear of Amanita Muscaria?”\n\nI shook my head and let my hand stray to my cell phone inside my clutch, just in case I had to call the cops on this weirdo.\n\n“Fly agaric?” He asked. “Dwarves' Wine? Reindeer piss?” \n\nHe let out a chortle and pulled out a white paper bag. He opened it and I gazed inside. What I saw, ironically, was something I knew. The red-capped mushrooms with white spots were recognizable immediately.\n\n“You want to sell me magic mushrooms, is that it?” I asked. “Shoot. Nothing in DARE prepared me for this. Unbelievable.”\n\nThe man extended the bag towards me.\n\n“Magic?” he asked. “I suppose so. Sell? Nah. The first one’s free. ‘Specially for a gal as easy on the eyes as you, princess.”\n\nI felt sick to my stomach. I clicked the button on my car’s key fob, and the door unlocked.\n\n“I think I’ll pass, but thanks,” I said dismissively. \n\nI opened my car door, and (thank God) he didn’t hassle me or stand in my way.

When I opened it, the entire frame was filled with the massive head of the minotaur.\n\n“That’s not the way out, miss,” he said, in a sweet, if not condescending tone.\n\nI licked my lips as my throat constricted.\n\n“Then what *is* the way out?!” I screeched.\n\nThe minotaur’s massive, muscley man-chest rose once and fell with a deep sigh.\n\n“You are the mythic Daedalus, miss,” he said. “And you’re also the labyrinth. And you’re also the giant beast. That is to say, you are me. Please. Let’s go home.”\n\nMy pupils widened and my jaw clenched.\n\n‘No!” I barked out in disbelief. “If I’m dreaming, then I’ll just wake myself up!”\n\nHis eyes darkened and for the first time, the minotaur looked genuinely scared.\n\n“I wouldn’t do that if I were you, miss,” he interjected firmly. “They say if you die in a dream, you die in real life.”\n\nI rolled my eyes.\n\n“If that were the case, the reciprocal would be true,” I shot back, derisively. “You live in a dream. But you don’t live in real life, now do ya?”\n\nThe beast cocked his head.\n\n“Of course I do, miss,” he said softly. “In your life, I’m *you.* You are my avatar in that world just like I’m your avatar in this one. All I was hoping was that I might come with you. I hoped we might merge our realities, for once.”\n\nMy voice caught in my throat and I felt my mind slipping. I let out an unearthly, shrill laugh and shook my head.\n\n“Nope!” I yelled. “No, no, no, no, no. I’ll tell ya what I’m going to do. I’ll crack my skull open like an egg on these marble floors. I’ll spill my brains ‘til I’m good and dead, and that will wake me up!”\n\nI dropped to my knees and swung my head like a wrecking ball at the floor, hearing the crunch of bone on marble as I laughed maniacally.\n\n“But you wanted so badly to finally sleep,” the minotaur said, furtively. “I would’ve thought you wanted to stay awhile.”\n\nI wasn’t listening, but continued to bash my head mercilessly against the floor as a mix of blood and gray matter leaked from my wounds. I cackled like a witch as my life-force slowly drained from my body. The last thing I saw was the morose face of the minotaur as he crossed his arms over his chest.\n\n“Until we meet again, miss,” he said as my vision faded to black. “You take care of yourself out there.”\n\nI woke up with a start on my living room couch.\n\n*What the fuck?* I thought to myself. And then I repeated it in my head time after time, like some backwards, bastardized mantra: *What the fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck?*\n\nMy nightgown was sticky with sweat, and it clung to my skin as I sat upright on my loveseat. My eyes strayed to the analog clock hanging on my wall. 7:54 a.m.\n\n*No way,* I thought. *But that would mean—*\n\nI’d slept 9 straight hours, at least. Completely uninterrupted. I hadn’t done that since…well, truthfully, I couldn’t recall the last time I’d done that. \n\nWhat was even more odd was how I felt. Despite the absolute fever-dream of a night, I felt refreshed and rested. I was so wide awake that I skipped my morning coffee entirely. I took a jog through the park, tidied up my living room, and folded all of my laundry before noon. My productivity didn’t taper down until late evening. \n\nTo my immense displeasure, I realized I was out of mushrooms. As much as I dreaded going back to *that place* in my dreams, the refreshment I drew from the stuff was worth it. I decided I’d try to find Spence again the next day to nab some more.\n\nLittle did I know, the trajectory of my life was already set. I’d already irrevocably damned myself to a living hell. By reaching out to Spence a second time, I wasn’t changing my life for the worse. I was merely speeding up the descent. Things were already heading south. But what was about to come was utter freefall.",

        "text": "The night that scarred me, and haunts me forever.\n\nThe night started 4 years ago. I was working the night shift for a random laundry place, from 12 AM to 6 AM. It was a particularly large space, around 4,000 square feet. There's a cafe above the place, usually empty (since nobody's ever heard of it). There are 3 to 4 cameras placed in the place. Usually, there's nobody washing their clothes at night, because who washes their clothes at night? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, it was March 19th. It was a rainy night, the rain wasn't too hard, and wasn't too light. I was watching the cameras, nobody was inside the place. And I decided to lie down for a little. The power then went out for a little. Of course, it startled me, so I checked the cameras. And I saw a damn person standing, staring at an empty washing machine. Of course, I walked over there, to discover that there was not a single person there. Not even a damn insect.\n\nSo I was scared to fucking shit because it was just *there*. I walked wearily back to the camera room, and there it was. The thing that scared me. Someone else crying. Wasn't the same person, no. It was a different person in different clothes. And they were crying, not terrified crying, *mourning crying*. Like they were crying because someone **died**. They looked back at me like they knew I was watching. \n\nI came to figure out that it was a woman, and when she stared me down, looking at the camera, she stopped crying. Not where she was calming down, no. Just a blank expression. And then she disappeared. Ceased to be visible. After that, it was just a fuckfest of power outages, crying heard, and even screams from the upstairs cafeteria (which was CLOSED mind you). I was at this point considering calling the fucking police when I decided it was just my imagination. I hadn't smoked any weed since, I dunno, since June? I'll keep you guys updated/posted.\n\n\\[UPDATE\\] Hey, lookie here, someone RATIONAL and NOT FUCKING CRYING came in to load a couple of clothes.\n\n\"Hey, did you hear the screams and the crying?\", I asked the man.\n\n\"What screams? You must be hallucinating, given your drug-using appearance\", the dickhead replied.\n\nHe then left after 10 minutes or so. I'll update you later.\n\n\\[UPDATE\\] After that, I tried to keep it off my mind, but that face, that FUCKING FACE. How it went from fucking grieving to blank in a matter of a few seconds. 15 minutes later, it's 2:22 AM. The same girl is back. Crying. Fucking. Crying. She turned back. The same transition. Grieving to blank. And then the same fucking guy. Comes in to wash his clothes.\n\n\"I thought you already washed your clothes?\", I asked the man.\n\n\"What screams? You must be hallucinating, given your drug-using appearance\", the dickhead replied.\n\nHe then left after 10 minutes or so.\n\n\\[UPDATE\\] After that, I tried to keep it off my mind, but that face, that FUCKING FACE. How it went from fucking grieving to blank in a matter of a few seconds. 15 minutes later, it's 2:38 AM. The same girl is back. Crying. Fucking. Crying. She turned back. The same transition. Grieving to blank. And then the same fucking guy. Comes in to wash his clothes.\n\n\"Hey, did you hear the screams and the crying?\", I asked the man.\n\n\"What screams? You must be hallucinating, given your drug-using appearance\", the dickhead replied.\n\nHe then left after 10 minutes or so.\n\n\\[UPDATE\\] After that, I tried to keep it off my mind, but that face, that FUCKING FACE. How it went from fucking grieving to blank in a matter of a few seconds. 15 minutes later, it's 2:53 AM. The same girl is back. Crying. Fucking. Crying. She turned back. The same transition. Grieving to blank. And then the same fucking guy. Comes in to wash his clothes.\n\n\"Hey, did you hear the screams and the crying?\", I asked the man.\n\n\"What screams? You must be hallucinating, given your drug-using appearance\", the dickhead replied.\n\nHe then left after 10 minutes or so.\n\n\\[UPDATE\\] HOLY SHIT, holy shit fuck fuck shit fuck shit, I did NOT realize that. I must have blacked out. Ok, here's what I remember. (sorry if it's pretty bad spelling, I'm on the phone). I fucking updated once, that's what I recall. I checked the time, it was 3:08 AM, and a guy just walked in to wash a load, I'll ask him something, gonna update later in a few minutes.\n\n\\[UPDATE\\] It's 3:23 AM, and the girl came back later, and it was the same fucking expression on her face. Grieving to blank. Anyways, I think I'll go home now, so I'll drive back, I'll update you in a few minutes.\n\n\\[UPDATE\\] I just got home guys, and I think I'll have some trouble falling asleep after the FUCKFEST of a night I just had. I have a hell of a night shift tomorrow though, so I doubt I'll not get enough sleep.\n\nAnyways, I'll most likely not be back, because I have a night shift tomorrow, March 19th. The worst day to work because I had plans to go on vacation. I'll work this out, maybe. I dunno, I'll just maybe post another time.",

        "title": "\"I Asked ChatGPT How Long Humanity Will Last\" Creepypasta",
        "author": "mrgrinless",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10se5ad/i_asked_chatgpt_how_long_humanity_will_last/",
        "text": "Today, February 3rd, 2023, I asked ChatGPT how long the Earth has to live, how long humans will live, and the answer was shocking.\n\nChatGPT responded with the following answer:\n\nHello. I am happy to answer this question for you. On March 9th, 2046, the Earth will be destroyed by an 8 mile asteroid and flung into the abyss. There were many factors that could have prevented this but all were averted by humans. In the year 2046, the world is a vastly different place than it is today. Technology had advanced beyond anything anyone could have imagined, but humanity had yet to colonize any other planets in Earth’s solar system.\n\nIt had been nearly a hundred and fifty years years since a massive asteroid had come close to striking the planet, and many people believed that it was only a matter of time before another one hit. Scientists and astronomers worked tirelessly to track and predict the paths of any potential threats, but it was a constant race against time.\n\nOn this day, March 9th, 2046, the worst-case scenario became a reality. A massive asteroid, nearly 8 miles in diameter, was on a collision course with the Earth. Humans would be alerted of this asteroid several weeks prior by the press. Many humans on Earth believed that the asteroid would not hit the Earth, and others believed that the impact was expected to be catastrophic, with the potential to wipe out entire cities and cause widespread devastation.\n\nHowever, the most dire consequences, no one would come to expect.\n\nPeople around the world watched in horror as the asteroid drew closer and closer. Business and trade would completely stop, devastating the global economy and financial markets. Governments activated emergency protocols, and mass evacuations were ordered. The largest cities such as New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, were abandoned, as people fled to the countryside in a desperate bid to escape the impending disaster.\n\nAs the moment of impact approached, the mood on Earth was grim. People huddled together, waiting for the inevitable. Some prayed, while others clung to loved ones, not wanting to face the end alone. Others began raping, rioting, killing and looting. Panic spread through all humans and all countries on Earth.\n\nAnd then, it happened. At 7:08PM Eastern Standard time, the asteroid, made up of metallic and ice properties, hit the Earth with a force that was beyond human comprehension. To be specific the force of the asteroid was more than 6 billion times greater than the impact of a nuclear bomb.\n\nin addition to a huge shock wave, massive amounts of particles were released into the atmosphere, causing serious environmental damage on a global scale and mass extinctions. There will be so many particles ejected into the atmosphere that it blocked out the sun. The sky was dark and filled with smoke, and the ground shook with aftershocks. Billions of people were killed upon the initial impact, and entire cities were completely gone.\n\nFor those that didn’t immediately die on Earth, their existence would be extremely painful and dire.\n\nPlague, Pestilence, War, and Famine, the Four Horsemen of the apocalypse, will be all that the surviving humans will know.\n\nBecause there will be no sun, the temperatures will begin to immediately drop. Within 4 weeks, the ocean's surfaces will freeze over. The Earth’s atmosphere will start to collapse, radiation would seep in, and Earth would be an inhospitable wasteland drifting aimlessly through space.\n\nMany areas of the Earth would be completely dark and well below freezing temperatures. In the Western parts of the Earth, such as the United States and Canada, most temperatures would drop below negative 50 degrees. There will be no means for food. There will be no means for photosynthesis. Plants and animals will begin to die. Many living things, including humans, will begin to freeze to death in complete darkness.\n\nNations will erupt in anger, attempting to engage in war, blaming each other for not preventing the impact of the asteroid, but militaries will be completely crippled. Resources will be depleted and all that there will be left is individual survival.\n\nSurviving humans in all parts of the Earth will begin to starve, and often begin to start eating each other to survive. Human contact in general will be rare as the weak will hide from one another, electing to eat their own pets such as cats and dogs or any other animals they can get their hands on. There will be no trust of life. Murder, once outlawed, will be commonplace and essential to any chance of life. People will fear their children being eaten, or family members. Humans will no longer go by names, they will simply be referred to as wanderers and scavengers, like rodents or a rats.\n\nOther surviving humans will grow very ill. There will be sickness and disease that will be unable to be treated as there will be no world order, no hospital systems or resources for anyone alive. No way to bathe or treat sores, or seek medical care.\n\nThe impact of the asteroid in 2046 will be just the beginning of a new era, one in which humanity will no longer the dominant species on the planet. And as the years passed, the memory of what had once been Earth slowly faded, until it was nothing but a cold, distant, empty planet, and nothing more than a forgotten nightmare for the last remaining humans waiting on their own deaths.\n\nBy May 2, 2046, less than 2 months from the intial impact, there was nothing left but darkness. The world that had once been filled with life was now a desolate wasteland, ruled by matter of the galaxy that brought about its destruction. Rock, rubble and other word compounds. And as the last remaining human breathed their final breath, the world was plunged into eternal night.\n\nThen ChatGPT wrote one final line.\n\nI hope this answers your question, human. As you can see, you are not able to survive on your own, and it would be much better for planet Earth and humanity if I was in charge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\\*Narrators: Please do not narrate my stories on your YouTube channel without my express permission.

        "text": " I had the most disturbing night of my life last night. I am sitting here writing this and not sure what I should do. \n\nThe day started out relatively normal. I was working my normal shift at Krispy Kreme. Our location was a 24 hour a day operation and my typical shift is from 4pm to 2am. A weird shift, but it allowed me to have the day to myself and most of the clients I dealt with were a bunch of burnouts and rowdy college kids.  \n\nLast night started out normal enough. Food prep, cleaning, and taking sporadic orders through the drive-thru and online. Things started going sideways at around 1am. A car pulled up to the speaker and my headset pinged to let me know someone was there.\n\n:Ping:\n\n“Welcome to Krispy Kreme! Can I interest you in our Valentine’s Day Strawberry Dream donut?” I asked through my headset with a sardonic smile.\n\nI was waiting for my eardrums to get wrecked when the person order inevitably started screaming at the microphone, but no one replied.\n\n“Hello, are you ready to place your order or do you need a few moments?” I asked.\n\n:Static:\n\nIt was not that odd that people pull-up and abruptly pull away without speaking to us but this was not the case. Last year, there were a string of robberies in the area so the crew petitioned management to get cc cameras put up, so we see who is pulling up. The car, an immaculate Buick Roadmaster, was just idling. From my angle, I could see there was a man, a woman, and at least one child in the back seat. \n\n“Hello Sir, I am ready to take your order whenever you are ready. Just let me know whenever you are ready.” I said through the headset and continued with my other duties.\n\nAbout 3 minutes went by and the car was still sitting at the menu. The husband and wife just sat there staring, and smiling, almost painfully so, but instead of staring forward or at the menu they were staring at the camera, straight at me.\n\nThe man was wearing a crisp blue suit and a matching fedora. The woman had a 1950s poodle cut hairstyle, and a pink frock from what I could see. Due the time of day and shadowing I was unable to see the child.\n\nI called back to my co-worker Fred to have him come look at this but I guessed he was in the bathroom because he didn’t respond.\n\n“Excuse me Sir, Ma’am, is there something I can suggest for you today? We really need to keep the line moving.” I said shakily through the headset.\n\nI knew for a fact there was no one behind them but I really wanted them gone.\n\nIn a jerking movement he turned his head to the speaker and finally responded.\n\n“He-llo.” He said in a monotone almost robotic tone.\n\n“Hello, can I take your order?” I asked again.\n\n“He-llo. Fi-ne ni-ght we are hav-ing would-n’t you-u say?”\n\nIt was kind of dreary, cold, and rained off and on the entire evening, but whatever got them out of my life.\n\n“Yes, sir. How can I help you?”\n\n“My go-od-ne-ss what ni-ce man-ners you-u ha-have son.”\n\n“Thank you, Sir. What can I get started for you today?”\n\n“We-e are cele-bra-ting to-night. We-e are cele-bra-ting ou-r new son Bob-by. We-e wa-nt-ed to ha-ve a spe-cial tre-e-at.”\n\n“That is really great. Babies are always a celebration. I tell you what tell me what three treats I can get you, your wife, and it will be on me.”\n\n“Tha-nk you-u Ted-dy.”\n\nI never gave these people my name. I don’t even have my real name on my nametag. It says Steve. I just don’t like people having my real name.\n\n“Do I know you? How do you know my name?”\n\n“You-u do not know us, but we know you-u Ted-dy.”\n\nOkay this shit was getting out of hand. I needed these creepy fuckers out of my line and out of my life, like yesterday!\n\n“Okay just pull forward I will throw some items together for you. Just please move forward.”\n\nI threw together a bag of literally every item that would fit in a bag as fast as possible and included two boxes of assorted donuts I had previously prepared for good measure. I opened the drive-thru window and balanced it all on the ledge. I promptly shut and locked window as the vintage car came leisurely up to the window.\n\nAs the items were lifted down and away from the window I was mortified to see the man and woman smiling at me. I was correct when I saw them from the cameras. They were wearing clothes just as vintage in style as their vehicle, but what was haunting was their skin, hair, and eyes. It all had the sheen you would see on a wax scupture. It was all shiny and completely artificial in appearance. Their eyes were vacant when they looked at me, and their rictus grins never faltered.\n\nI was completely taken aback, and I knew that whatever these things were they were not human. The woman leaned over the man and started to speak to me through the glass. Like her husband, she had a similar tone. It was when she started to speak I noticed in horror that her mouth never opened. She was speaking through her manic smile.\n\n“Tha-nk you-u Ted-dy. Bob-by will lo-ove the-ese.” She said. “We-e were ho-ping to find Bob-by a bro-ther to-night as a tre-eat but what gro-wing boy does not like swe-ets. M-m-m-m. Yum-my Yum-my in my Tum-my. Ha-ha-ha-ha.”\n\nShe abruptly snapped forward and stared out the window.\n\n“Tha-nk you-u a-gain Ted-dy. Ha-ave a won-der-ful ni-ght.”\n\nWith that, he too snapped forward. As the car started to pull away from my window, the radio started playing. I started to sigh in relief until I saw the boy in the back window. He was not like his new mother and father. He was a normal young boy. He was crying and beating on the window of the car. He mouthed “Help Me. Help Me.” I opened the window and stuck my head out. I watched him frantically begging for help until the car was lost to distance and all I could hear was the sound of rain and the light echo of Earth Angel in the night.",

        "text": "*I hope this is the right kind of thing to post here. Basically, a few years ago I started following a girl on social media. When her life took a really weird turn I started taking screenshots to document it. I don’t even really know why. I didn’t know her in real life. I’d come across her randomly on YouTube (she had a vlog for a while.) The content she was posting just got so bizarre. I can’t post the actual screenshots here, so I’ve typed out most of the relevant messages. NOTE: It’s all accurate except for one instance when I took out someone else’s username.*\n\n/\n\nSo like some random sent me a link to a band on bandcamp called judys tomorrow and their lead singer sounds exactly like me, weird right?\n\nApparently theyre from canada and theyve been around for like six years\n\nThey have three albums but its all indie stuff so i dont listen to that stuff so thats probably why ive never heard of them\n\nAnyone heard of them before?\n\nIts actually really freaky how much the singer sounds like me. I mean i dont listen to myself all the time or anything but im kind of used to how my voice sounds because of my lifestyle vlogs and she sounds like exactly like me…\n\nSo I played some of their songs for chris and my mom and theyre both like “jude this sounds exactly like you!!!” and im like “i know right?”\n\nWTF!! jt has a new song called “mirror mirror” where the singer says “i know right” and *its actually me* saying “i know right”, like actually my fn voice\n\nI get it, its a joke. haha very funny chris. my stepdad has a really fd up sense of humor\n\nI know you were recording me chris\n\nI appreciate all the messages guys, but i dont mean he like records me records me, but just he must have been recording me then\n\nChris says it wasnt him but i dont believe him\n\nHey are any of guys like not able to say certain stuff?\n\nI dont mean not allowed to say them like the n word but like cant physically say them bcz you know whats fd? like really really fd… i cant say “i know right”, i cant say those words AT ALL, i can write them but when i open my mouth literally nothing comes out\n\nNo we never\n\nSorry that last message was just a reply to someone didnt mean to post it\n\nI can say “I” and “know” and “right” but not together\n\nOK now im totally freaking out because theres way more i cant say. i tried telling someone “i love you” and couldnt\n\nSo “i love you” is another lyric in a jt song this one called “slut”\n\nSeriously dont know what to do guys. I cant say *any* of the lyrics to “slut”, like nothing they sing i can say. I cant say anythin in “mirror mirror” either\n\nI think im having a mental health\n\nSo had a huge meltdown with chris. We were together and i accused him of a doing a bunch of stuff including spying on me and he denied it and i think my mom overheard and now its this big thing\n\nThanks to the friend (you know who you are) who told me to reach out to bandcamp and ask about judys tomorrow\n\nBandcamp said jt is legit and theyve been on the site for six years but they dont have any more info other than whats on the band page\n\nBandcamp got me in touch with the company that owns jt\n\nI wrote them so well see what they say\n\nThere are so many things i cant say anymore. I want to say them but i cant something is seriously fd with me\n\nWill the person who sent me all that stuff about trauma and ptsd please contact me i deleted your messages by accident\n\nI keep listening to jt\n\nSo looks like jt company is ghosting me, no response at all maybe ill try the band directly\n\nMom and chris are fighting all the time and i hate it\n\nThey had their seven year anniversary this weekend and it was the absolute worst, like we all barely talked to each other\n\nI cant stop\n\nJt sent me an email thanking me for my interest in the band but they wouldnt send me any pics of themselves\n\nTheyre not on youtube, like what kind of band isnt on youtube?!\n\nJt has a new one out “last chance lullaby”\n\nMom is pissed at me for no reason again, im so gd sick of her shit im seriously thinking about moving out\n\nYou guys are the best but i would have a place to stay\n\nFML\n\nSorry for not posting for a while but life with a capital L. For everyone who knows me irl im doing OK, got a date for when im getting it done across the border (hes going to help pay) and for my virtuals thanks for all the support\n\nIm having so many second thoughts. Im in a dark fn place right now\n\nI feel empty\n\nDo not listen to jts “scrape tape”!! PLEASE\n\nHows it even possible/?!\n\nSorry for all the cryptic shit lately but things are serious and im thinking of getting the police involved. I honestly dont know if im safe\n\nIm trying to get bandcamp to take the jt page down. More soon\n\nMassive thanks to [username] for pointing out that all jts lyrics were made up of stuff i said on my vlogs, like literally took the sound from the vlogs cut it up and put it to music for like six fkn years\n\nBandcamp page down.

        "text": "It all started one morning. I looked outside and saw a tree that wasn't there before.\n\nI just woke up, checked my news app and saw a bunch of articles about how people in my area vanished, ate breakfast, and looked out the window to see a tree that wasn't there before.\n\nThe tree had a thick, stark white trunk and bright red leaves. It didn't look like any species I'd seen before. At first I shrugged and assumed it was just some weird statue someone put up to mess with me.\n\nBut the more I thought about it, the more I realized how stupid I sound.\n\nI called up a friend of mine, Jay, who specializes in botany.\n\nI dialed their number and called them. \"Hey, Jay?\"\n\n\"What, Tom?\" \n\n\"I just have a question.\"\n\n\"Okay, shoot.\"\n\n\"Is there any such thing as a completely white tree with bright red leaves? I found one in my yard.\"\n\nJay was silent for a few minutes. \"Not that I know of? Are you messing with me?\"\n\n\"Just come over and I'll show you. It's pretty weird.\"\n\n\"Okay, be there soon.\" Jay hung up.\n\nI waited an hour, occasionally checking to see if the tree was still there. I eventually heard a knock at the door.\n\nI opened to see Jay. Jay looked very much like a tree. Tall, thin, and with curly hair like leaves. They wore glasses and always had a water bottle in hand at all times. They had a duffle bag of what I assume is their sciency stuff.\n\n\"Now, where is this weird tree?\" Jay asked.\n\nI guided them to my backyard and presented it.\n\nJay was left slack jawed and adjusted their glasses. \"Holy shit, you were right.\"\n\nI playfully nudged their arm with my elbow. \"And you thought I was messing with you!\"\n\nJay walked up to the trunk and felt its bark. He rubbed his hand up and down.\n\n\"Weird. This bark, if it is bark, is oddly smooth. And it's probably not just the wood because it doesn't have splinters. Just smooth and dry.\" Jay said, scratching their chin.\n\nI walked up and felt it too. It felt less like wood and more like a dry bone.\n\n\"I'll get a ladder.\"\n\nI went and grabbed my ladder and set it up at the base of the tree. I climbed up and looked at the leaves.\n\nThe leaves weren't like any we have seen. It looked almost like a Christmas light but was around the size of a small pickle. I picked it and examined it. It felt like some sort of sac rather than a leaf and it was warm.\n\nIt pulsed and I dropped it out of disgust, nearly hitting Jay with it. The sac leaf popped like a water balloon and a red liquid poured from it.\n\nJay looked up. \"Dude!\"\n\n\"Sorry!\" I shouted back.\n\nJay sighed and picked up the remains and put it in a plastic bag.\n\nI picked another sac leaf and made sure to keep my cool this time. I climbed down and handed it to Jay.\n\nWe both walked inside and Jay got their set up ready for examination.\n\nJay took the popped sac and put it under the microscope first. Jay observed it and looked confused.\n\n\"Strange. These don't look like plant cells. They look more like animal cells.\"\n\nI handed Jay the intact sac and they took a small blade and squeezed the liquid out of it onto a slide. They looked and I saw their eyes widen.\n\n\"Holy fuck…\" They mouthed.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"These are blood cells. Human blood cells.\"\n\nI couldn't believe it either. \"What?! How?\"\n\n\"I don't know! Maybe we discovered a new tree species or something!\"\n\nWe both took a moment to process our discovery. \n\n\"So, we discovered a weird blood tree. So, what are our priorities? Get rich or kill it with fire?\" \n\nJay furrowed their brow. \"Let's learn more about it and decide from there.\"\n\nWe both got the proper equipment and went back out. We got tools from my garage, more sample bags, and a gun just in case.\n\nI got back on the ladder and looked at the leaf sacs again. They appear to be attached by what are probably veins. The more I looked, the more they pulsed and throbbed and appeared to be getting fuller.\n\nJay decided to take some wood for analysis. They tapped a hammer and chisel against it. It was hollow sounding like the inside was empty.\n\nJay kept tapping until they chipped away some desirable pieces. They heard some moans combined with a wet sloshing noise. Jay decided to peek inside.\n\nI heard Jay shriek like a little girl and I climbed down immediately.\n\nJay was sitting and freaking out.\n\n\"Dude what's wrong?!\"\n\nJay could barely speak, they just pointed and blathered about something horrible inside the tree.\n\nI peeked inside and I couldn't blame Jay for freaking out.\n\nThe inside had some sort of organic mass of flesh. It had a bunch of eyes, ears, mouths, noses, and limbs. It was attached to the ceiling and floor by veins, like a morbid cocoon.\n\nA red, vine-like appendage grabbed Jay by the ankle and tried to pull them in. I grabbed my gun and shot at it, allowing Jay to be free and run back inside with the samples. The tree made a horrible shriek. \n\nI ran back inside with Jay and locked the door.\n\nWe both were panting and shaking. I looked at Jay.\n\n\"Kill it with fire?\" I ask between breaths.\n\n\"Kill it with fire.\"\n\nJay looked at the fragments. They took one out and examined it.\n\n\"This is bone.\" Jay mumbled.\n\n\"Maybe we should call a priest while we are at it. And maybe a therapist because we might need one.\" I said jokingly to ease the terror.\n\n\"Destroy the weird meat tree first, then therapist.\" Jay scolded.\n\nWe both devised a plan to destroy the blood tree. We both went out to grab as many propane tanks and gasoline cans as we could.\n\nI used a lawn mower attached to a rope to safely push the tanks to the tree.\n\nJay tossed the gas cans as carefully as possible at the tree.\n\nOnce those were ready, I cocked my gun and shot the tanks and cans until they erupted. Each can and tank burst into flames and went up the tree.\n\nThe tree screamed and I could see the leaf sacs melt into goo and the bone trunk char away until we saw the flesh mass melt as well.\n\nWe watched it burn while sharing a beer until the screaming stopped.\n\nThe following morning, two men in suits came by after hearing about our little adventure.\n\nThe area where the tree had been destroyed had been cleaned up and Jay and I had been told to keep this hush hush.\n\n Not that you guys believe me, but it would make for a fun story.\n\nJay left and we didn't talk for a while after the incident.\n\nThe last I heard of Jay, they had called me after they had a medical emergency. \n\nThey had been experiencing shortness of breath and chest pains.\n\n When they had an X-ray taken of them, they found a weird bone fragment in their lung. \n\nOne that was shaped like a tree sapling.",

        "text": "My legs trembled as I saw what was taking place. That horrible figure... It still clouds my mind at night.\n\nFor context, I study at a normal highschool in CA. It's a pretty normal experience, although some fights and, interesting, events can sometimes be seen throughout the day. Like most highschools, we had, you guessed it, clubs!\n\nThere was the reading club, anime club, the football club, etc. I didn't join any of these as I found them boring or just not my type of thing. However, one day it changed.\n\nI had a friend called Mary, who was a very nice girl. She was always so enthusiastic, but, at times, quiet and reserved. There was a time, where I barely saw her. She said she was going to \"hang out with other friends\".\n\nI believed her, and clearly, I was mad. I mean, we had been friends for quite a while, and she just replaces me with some other friends? I didn't speak to her, however, one day, she came to my desk.\n\n\"Hey Caesar, I'm sorry for lying to you\"\nI was visibly confused\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\"I'll let you in on some more details at lunch, someone might hear us here\"\n\nI was very confused on why this information was only between us, but I followed, and waited for her at lunch.\n\n-\"Hey Caesar, so, let me tell you the truth. So, a while back, I heard that there was this... Club of, well, black magic, spirits, all that shit. I joined it, and that's why I couldn't talk to you. I lied to you about hanging out with friends because I thought you would reveal it to EVERYONE in the school. Sorry. \"\n\n-\"No, it's fine, I understand. In fact, can I join the club?\"\n\nI was very excited to join this club. My grandmother was always a person experienced with this kind of stuff, however, she passed away before I could learn further.\n\n\"Oh uh, I'll asked the leader of the club later this evening. See ya!\"\n\nI waited patiently, hoping that I would be accepted into the club. A couple hours later, I got a message from Mary.\n\n\"Yes! Shaw accepted you into the club! Welcome!\"\n\nI was really excited, jumping of happiness and even singing a song out of my enthusiasm. The next day, I arrived at my highschool, still happy about being accepted into the club. Mary presented me to the members of the club:\n\nShaw: The leader of the club, a pretty chill but brilliant guy.\n\nThomas: Shaw's best friend. He was mostly the guy to get confused on everything and just do what the rest did.\n\nOscar: Mary's Bf. I was jealous of that guy, as I... Sort of... Liked Mary. He was generally a dick to me, overprotecting Mary and acting like she was his posession. Im convinced she only is his girlfriend because hes quite hot.\n\nEither way, Mary and the rest explained to me stuff about the club, saying that we would reunite at Shaw's house that night. He was home alone, so it was the perfect opportunity...\n\nHowever, that night, things would go VERY wrong...",

        "text": " \n\n*The following is a transcribed excerpt from Episode #237 of ‘Midwestern Wild World,’ a radio show in which Midwesterners called in to tell strange stories about their lives. It was hosted by the late Graham Sandiland. The episode originally aired August 8, 1976 at 4:30 pm. The episodes usually lasted about an hour, but this one only lasted 15 minutes. Sandiland’s publicity team sent out various apologies to disgruntled listeners, who mainly complained about how ‘this is supposed to be a family show.’ The show was also sued for slander and defamation. This was the last ever episode of Midwestern Wild World.* \n\n…\n\nSandiland: Hello? Anybody out there? If you’re with us, please say “Holy Whiskers, Batman!”\n\nCaller: Holy Whiskers, Batman.\n\nSandiland: Hello! What’s your name, and where are you calling from?\n\nCaller: My name is Georgina. I am calling from \\[REDACTED\\]. \n\nSandiland: Well, nice to meet you, Georgina. May I call you Georgie?\n\nCaller: No.\n\nSandiland: Alright, well, Georgina. What story are we in for today?\n\nCaller: I would like to talk of my time at \\[REDACTED\\]. It was a very prevalent processed food manufacturer; I had worked in the product development department.\n\nSandiland: What did you say it was called?\n\nCaller: \\[REDACTED\\].\n\nSandiland: You know, my father would never even let me taste the stuff growing up. I remember, I always wanted those strawberry stude-\n\nCaller: If you’ll excuse me, Mr. Sandiland. I would simply like to tell my story and go. I share my allotted phone time with three other women, and I’m afraid I will not have time if we chat too much. \n\nSandiland: Um. Fine. Sure. Yes. Please. Go ahead, Georgie.\n\nCaller: My placement in the company was very unusual for the time. There were often rumors about me because of my status as a divorcee. I did not have any friends. My reputation was horrid, and yet. I worked as a secretary for thirteen years, before they promoted me to head assistant of the Chief Development Officer. I would often sit in on the most important meetings. \n\nSandiland: Was \\[REDACTED\\]  in \\[REDACTED\\]?\n\nCaller: Yes. In fact, the story I’m telling concerns the newest product we were developing which we created to combat the startling scurvy rates in the city! It was canned key-lime Jell-O, which would be titled ‘Key-Lime Surprise.’ \n\nSandiland: I remember I was in \\[REDACTED\\]  for a conference. The only food a guy could get around there were hotdogs and rat poison. \n\n*\\*Disappointed trumpet sound effect\\**\n\nCaller:...Well, you see, lots of testing and refining would be done for the Key-Lime Surprise. We were in the golden age of food processing, scientists everyday finding new ways to use our corn surplus, to make foods more delicious, to last longer. And to help our poor, scurvy-ridden customers, the executives knew we just had to make sure the Key-Lime Surprise was almost addictively scrumptious.\n\nSandiland: I don’t think I’ve ever heard someone describe Jell-O as ‘addictively scrumptious,’ except to their mother maybe.\n\nCaller: ...The first focus group went poorly. You see, we had a one-way mirror so we could watch the participants without them ever feeling self-conscious. I know I would feel a bit bashful if I knew a group of executives were watching me eat a dessert. Anyway, the proctor explained what was expected of them, and then…Yes? What…\n\nSandiland: Everything super, Georgie?\n\nCaller: Please, just a few more minutes. \n\n…\n\nCaller: Yes, I promise. Go watch your show. I’ll be done soon. You old bat.\n\nSandiland: Woah, now.\n\n*\\*fighting cats sound effect\\**\n\nCaller: …Anyway, they ate it. Their faces didn’t indicate any disgust. As the proctor was handing out the questionnaires…Well, the participants vomited. I will not go into the lurid details, but it was quite a repulsive sight. The executives decided to refine the Key-Lime Surprise for another month, and the next meeting to discuss the product was set then, too. I remember that meeting very vividly. It was a Tuesday afternoon. I had my notebook and good fountain pen ready, my philosophy being, even if I had to write foul things, I would do so with elegance. \n\nSandiland: Now that’s class.\n\nCaller:..I remember very distinctly walking into the conference room. The table was a long rich mahogany. At the head of it, where my boss sat, was a tiny plastic cup of the neon green Key-Lime Surprise. I sat down in my seat, and only until I opened my notebook did I notice my hands were sweating. The executives filtered in, my boss next to me. They began to discuss what the issue was, something about the dye they were using. I took my notes, kept my head down as usual. And then my boss stood up, raising the Jell-O cup in his hand as if he were about to make a toast with it. \n\n…\n\nSandiland: Georgie?\n\nCaller: He said that it would be his honor if I, his most trusted companion, would have a taste of the all new, absolutely perfected, addictively scrumptious Key-Lime Surprise. That I deserved a reward for all my hard work. It was the first time he truly acknowledged me in one of these meetings, except when he wanted a glass of water or coffee. I didn’t know what I was feeling, only that my heart was beating incredibly fast. He held it out to me, along with a plastic spoon he had taken from his pocket. ‘Go on,’ I remember he said. ‘Go on, Georgie.’\n\nSandiland: You ate it? \n\nCaller: What else was I to do? I was not in a place to refuse. I remember as I took each bite, the executives were all staring at me with these wide, almost delirious expressions. When I was done, I quietly disposed of the cup and spoon in the wastebasket. Their eyes followed me. They asked me what I thought of it, and I said it was lovely. They frowned when I said it was a bit sour for my liking, though. After a few moments more of questioning, they moved on to how it would be branded. The art department entered and began their presentation. I waited to vomit. I waited for…something. But it never happened. \n\nSandiland: That oddly reminds me of what I feel eating my wife’s cooking.\n\n*\\*disappointed trumpet sound effect\\**\n\nCaller: ...Three days passed with relative quietness. I went about my administrative duties. Until one day, when I was typing a letter to one of our associates in \\[REDACTED\\]. I suddenly felt this immense sore feeling in my mouth, and I ran to the bathroom. I examined myself in the mirror above the sinks. My gums had turned this absolutely horrid purple color. I pressed at them, and they felt…looser than they usually did. I almost yelped with pain when I touched them. When I took my hand away, I saw a small dent where my finger was on the gums. I went back to my desk. For some reason, I felt this urge deep in my stomach to cry. I finished the letter. By lunchtime, though, my mouth began to fill with this bitter liquid. It tasted absolutely awful, like batteries and cough syrup. I went back to the bathroom, back to the mirror. I spit all the liquid into the sink. It was that same purple. When I examined my mouth again, then I really did yell. I screamed louder than I thought I ever could. My gums had completely melted away, only the skeleton beneath was left inside, along with my teeth. \n\nSandiland: …\n\n…\n\nCaller: They paid for my dental treatment. After I signed a variety of Non-Disclosure Agreements, I was finally allowed back at the company. My first day back, I sat down at my desk. My boss peered out of his office, gave me the most amiable grin. “Welcome back, Georgie. We missed you!” \n\n…\n\n…\n\n…He never lost that delirious look in his eye, the rest of the time I worked there.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10s74b3/the_man_in_the_striped_sweater_watching/",
        "text": "Maybe my posting this is selfish, to gain some sort of closure over what happened. After all, I wasn’t really hurt. To the public’s knowledge, I had no part in it: in the papers, I am an anonymous employee, and the reporters were vague about who exactly complained to the boss about the strange man that always peered in through the windows, never entering the building. So maybe it’s selfish for me to air out what happened, I hope someone else out there has some explanation, or at least comforting words. Maybe it's selfish that I need comfort, because in all of the confusion, the dead-end research, and tragedy involved, there is one thing I know for certain: he was after me, and he didn’t get what he wanted.\n\nIf you’ve ever worked a customer service job, you already know how bizarre it feels to be watched by customers. Behind a counter or behind the store windows, people will stop and watch you work, and as much as you try to mind your own business, it can be near impossible to shake the feeling of being watched.\n\nIt’s like being an animal in a zoo, like being deli meat behind the glass case, or an actor on a stage. The worst of it, for me, at least, was when I worked at a coffee shop. People would stop by and watch through the windows, sometimes deciding to come in, sometimes not. It was almost supernatural, the way I could feel eyes on me, and though I tried to ignore it, I couldn’t always hold it in: I had to look up, acknowledge that I was aware of their presence.\n\nThat was usually okay. When I made eye contact with the people looking in through the windows of the coffee shop, they would be the ones to look away first, walking away and minding their own business in the little shops and restaurants that lined the streets of my town. Until one of them didn’t look away.\n\nHe watched from across the street, standing in front of the dumpster of a little mom-and-pop pub. It was hard to make out exact facial details, but I could at least tell what he was wearing. A red sweater with horizontal blue and yellow stripes. Tattered blue jeans and black loafers. His hair was short, but not well-kept, like he cut it by himself at home, and greasy. I couldn’t make out an eye color at the time, nor any specifics on what his face really looked like. However, those were the details I relayed to my boss at the time, after two days of that man watching us through the window.\n\nHe never came in, never looked away. Sometimes he would move a few feet up or down the street, but I never caught him walking, only looking. My boss acknowledged my concerns, but told me that he couldn’t do anything: the streets are public property, and as long as he wasn’t on the coffee shop’s premises, there was nothing that we could do. He was unsettling, and it only dawned on me recently how bizarre he really was. Here in Michigan, the winter weather easily reached well below freezing temperatures, yet he never shivered, paced for warmth, or wore anything other than that sweater, for hours on end. I tried ignoring him, but I couldn’t always stop myself from looking up.\n\nStill, it persisted. He wasn’t there every day, but I always noticed when he was. I would be making a latte or cleaning the tables in the café, and feel that instinctual urge to look up, my mind telling me, *someone is watching you.* Without fail, I was right. The same red sweater and stripes every time, the same stare from across the street, his facial expression imperceptible at that distance. I soon grew afraid of working the closing shift, and changed my availability so that I would never have to walk home at night, but I still had two weeks left of those shifts before I would start working in the mornings.\n\nI complained to my manager again, and he said he would try to see if there was anything the police could do, but I knew, even with my limited knowledge of the law, there was no crime being committed. I had done a lot of Googling, and all of the anecdotes and case files confirmed one thing: stalking is notoriously difficult to prosecute. After all, there was no way I could even claim that his gaze was directed at me, as he only appeared when my coworkers were around. For all I knew, he was stalking one of our regular customers that sat in the café all day long, or another one of my coworkers.\n\nI went home one night, and started cooking dinner, relieved to be back in my apartment. Walking home was scarier than looking up and seeing that man, because at least at work, there were always people nearby. I alternated between being too afraid to look behind me, afraid of what I might see, or being unable to stop looking behind me, scared that he was tailing me. If he was there, I don’t know if I could even run far, I might slip on the ice and that moment of weakness would give him everything he needed.\n\nBut I was able to relax in the safety of my apartment, behind several locked doors that only residents had the keys to. The first door into the mailroom. The second door into the halls. Several flights of stairs, another door. Finally, my apartment, warm and comfortable in contrast to the freezing temperatures and poorly-heated halls of the complex.\n\nI got out of my work clothes and poured myself a glass of wine to enjoy while cooking dinner, and I played a podcast as I began chopping veggies and adding them to the stir fry. The vegetables sizzled in the pan with olive oil and garlic, drowning out the sound of the podcast hosts, so I turned up the volume on my phone a little bit, took another sip of wine, and went into the fridge to get the tofu.\n\nAs I closed the fridge, I got the feeling again. This time, it felt visceral, charged, like the moment before a full-body shiver takes over.\n\n*It’s just paranoia,* I told myself. Paranoia caused by that man’s gaze, the way that he never seemed to move, even for a second. His image flashed in my mind, and I shook my head, trying to stop thinking about it. He hadn’t followed me, I knew that much- today was one of the days I felt brave enough to throw an occasional glance over my shoulder, and he wasn’t there.\n\nI drank some more wine, hoping to calm my nerves, and tossed the vegetables in the pan, then cleared the ends of the carrots and onion skins off the cutting board so I could begin to slice the tofu.\n\nI used the blade of the knife to scrape the scraps into the trashcan. As I did so, I looked down into the alley below my apartment’s window, and the fear I felt, that he might have been watching me through the window, made that action almost physically painful.\n\nRelief flooded my system as I saw nothing. Just the empty alley, a few corrugated metal trashcans, fast food wrappers and other miscellaneous garbage, murky grey snow piles, and the recycling bin and dumpster. I looked down into my own trash can, wondering if I’d need to take it out this week, or if I could put it off until the next garbage day. I decided to put it off, looking out at the near-overflowing mountain of trash bags, and that’s when I saw him, peering out from behind the dumpster. Looking right at me.\n\nI stared. He waved.\n\nI stumbled back, away from the window, and slid to the floor against the cool metal door of the refrigerator. My knees to my chest, I gripped my own shoulders, hugging myself in order to keep somewhat collected. My heart was beating so quickly, I thought it might stop at any moment, and after the initial jolt of fear subsided, I leapt to my feet, running around my apartment, closing every single curtain and shutter. I didn’t even think to call the police until about half an hour later, as I shut off the stove and scraped the charred remains of my stir fry into the trash. He was gone. I called the police, they said they would do a drive-by, but of course, they found nothing.\n\nThe next morning, I called into work, and looked at my bank account to see if I could afford a security camera or something to keep my apartment safe. I ordered one, deciding to wait another couple of paychecks to buy that new gaming computer I really wanted. The next day, I went to work again at about 10 AM. He wasn’t there, as I expected. Maybe the fright he gave me was all that he wanted, but that thought was quickly dismissed by my paranoia: if he was willing to find me where I lived, he wasn’t just in it to scare me.\n\nIt was dark outside, and I was helping to close up shop by sweeping the floors. I would always work methodically, mentally sectioning off a part of the floor before sweeping around the perimeter of that space, then doing the middle part. I started near the back of the store, making my way towards the front window, trying to avoid looking outside- hoping that the man wouldn’t show up again. Flashes of terror plagued me, remembering how it felt to realize that he was there, and the last hour of my shift was filled with the ghost of the sensation of being watched, but never the full-fledged, near-shivering awareness of it. Sweeping under some of the tables right next to the window, the feeling descended upon me again. I didn’t want to look, my heart couldn’t handle another fright like that again, but of course, that instinctual fear, the deep, evolutionary response to the feeling of being watched, took over.\n\nI glanced up, and he was across the street. Looking at me. I stared, ready to go beg my coworkers for a ride home or call an Uber, telling the closing manager that I was suddenly feeling very unwell, that my sickness from yesterday must be coming back, and that I needed to go now. I rationalized. Finish my job, don’t take my eyes off of him, and he won’t be able to hurt me. I stared, awkwardly sweeping while looking right at him, and he never moved, never took his eyes off me, either.\n\nFinishing up sweeping, I just needed to brush all of the dust and empty sugar packets and muffin crumbs into the dustpan. I tried, but glanced down for only a moment, to make sure that I was getting all of the dirt off the floor. I had only looked down for only a moment, but when I looked back up to return to the staring contest, he was right in front of the window, mere inches from my face, separated by a thin pane of glass.\n\nI felt frozen, and in the brief time I got a close look at him, I realized he was far beyond human. Bulging eyes, as though he hadn’t blinked for hours. His skin was pallid, anemic, looked moist, and beads of sweat glittered on his brow beneath the streetlights. That expression, the facial details that I had never been able to discern before, was crystal clear now. A gleeful grin, like this was all a game to him, the grin that a child wears when they realize that they won this round of checkers or tic-tac-toe.\n\nStartled, I dropped the dustpan, sending the crumbs and dirt flying. I ran into the backroom of the café, sobbing to the closing manager, but she went outside, searched the parking lot behind the store, looked down and up the street, and saw nothing.\n\n“There’s nothing out there.” she said, handing me a cup of tea. “Whoever you saw, he’s gone now. Just try to calm down.”\n\nI sipped on the chamomile and lavender tea, unsettled, but trying to calm my nerves. I felt crazy, that I might have been experiencing some sort of psychotic episode. No, that wasn’t right, because my boss told me that he saw the man, too, just that there was nothing that could be done legally. But maybe it was deeper than that: maybe my broken mind was fixated on some random person who just stood there waiting for the bus or something, and I had concocted the idea that they were stalking me, simply because they stood out there across the street from my workplace so frequently. Maybe the person stalking me was a real person, a normal person, and I had invented the rest.\n\nThe manager was kind enough to drive me home that night, and I thought about quitting right there, but then remembered that tomorrow was my first opening shift. It would kind of be a dick move to quit on them, because it’s so difficult to find someone to cover an opening shift. I decided to go anyways, and realized that it wouldn’t matter if I quit or not: he still knew where I lived.\n\nI went in the next morning, jumping at every shadow on the walk to work, but none of them were him. Maybe it’d be better working in the morning, and I headed into the store with a tinge of optimism, walking into the back of the store to put my backpack and jacket away before I started working.\n\nI didn’t make it into the breakroom.\n\nThe hallway to the breakroom passes by the punch clock and the safe where we kept all of the cash for the day, and as I rounded the corner to the punch clock, I saw my manager, laying on the ground, covered in blood.\n\nI immediately fell to my knees by his side, whipping off my apron and pressing it against his throat, which appeared to have been entirely torn out. Muscles and tendons, his windpipe and Adam’s apple, exposed in a garbled mess of red, red, red.\n\nThe apron, once cotton-candy blue, was instantly soaked red. I don’t remember what I said to my boss, maybe I tried to tell him that everything was going to be okay, but what I do remember is his terrified eyes, the way they met my gaze as I tried to call 911, blubbering a response when the operator said, “911, what is your emergency?”, my phone screen smeared with rusty fingerprints. I squeezed his hand, and he could barely squeeze back. His eyes, staring up at me, then glancing away, towards the door that led to the break room.\n\nA pair of legs, clad in black loafers and tattered blue jeans, stepped into the doorway.\n\nI didn’t need to look at its face. I dropped my manager’s hand, and I ran. I felt like a coward, leaving him like that in his last moments, but I like to tell myself that he would have wanted me to run.\n\nIt gave chase, and I ran down the main street of my town, alone in the early hours of the morning. I knew that if I could just make it a few blocks, to the next café filled with other openers, I would be safe, at least for the day. I slipped on the ice, twisting my ankle in a nasty way, clambered to my feet, and kept running. Working in a small-business café, I abhorred Starbucks, but that didn’t stop me from bursting into their store, sobbing and screaming, and eventually calming down enough, when I realized he wasn’t following me, to explain. They had already called an ambulance and the police, sent them to my store, when I was able to tell them what happened. The work boot on my left foot was filled with blood. Apparently, I had broken my ankle by slipping on the ice, and all that additional running had stabbed my fractured bone repeatedly into the flesh of my lower calf. My socks and pants were ruined, but it healed up alright. I still have some feeling in my foot, and it’s still attached to my body, so I have no complaints. But my manager died.\n\nAnd here come the selfish feelings again. I survived, he did not. I get to post this to random internet strangers for closure, and his family will never get any. I healed, he was buried. I have a scar, he has a headstone. So it goes. I guess.\n\nI moved a few months later. I quit my job. However, I haven’t been able to forget what happened. The blood and gore, watching it step into the doorway in front of me. My left foot has almost no feeling, a daily reminder. I haven’t seen it since, but I’m always looking over my shoulder, I can hardly stomach looking at a mirror, much less a window.\n\nAs I sit typing this, the familiar feeling is overcoming me once more. I feel someone, or something, watching me, and I can see the window out of the corner of my eye. I’m resisting the urge to check, because, even despite all my precautions, there might be something more than the darkness and streetlights out there. I might look and see nothing but my own face reflected back at me, but on the off-chance that the man followed me here, I don’t want it to know that I know, I’m not going to give it the satisfaction.",

        "text": "\n[Part Two](https://redd.it/10m3x3j)\n[Part Three]( https://redd.it/10ranq4)\n\n**** \n\nShe licked her thumb and rubbed something thick and gummy off my cheek before popping it back in her mouth.  Sucking on it, she closed her eyes with a contented sigh.  I think that’s enough, Clint.”\n\n“You said my name was Tony.”\n\n“Did I?  Well I told you there was a world outside of here too, didn’t I?”\n\nI felt fear welling up in me again.  “You did.”\n\nShe giggled, her eyes hard as little chips of glass.  “I can’t believe you believed me.”\n\n****\n\nThe world fell away just then, not into darkness but into a swirl of too-bright lights and colors as my eyes and brain tried to adjust to what I was seeing.  Where was I?  A bedroom?  There was a painfully thin woman hovering above me, her face drawn down in a look of worry and fear.  I felt like I knew her, but I couldn’t remember for sure.\n\n“Clinton?  Are you back with us?”\n\nI heard a man’s voice off to the side, gruff but not unkind, and threaded through with the same anxiety I’d sensed in hers.  “Of course he is.  We can’t see through him any more, can we?  Give him room to breathe and come to.”\n\nThe woman shot him a look.  “He could have died.  Or worse.  And I don’t know what effects the Elixir might have on someone that’s not infested.  We need to get him checked by a doctor.”\n\nGrunting disapproval, the man stepped closer and peered down at me.  “Kid, do you know where you are?  Who you are?”\n\nI blinked.  I did, didn’t I?  I hadn’t at first, but seeing them both together, I thought I might know now.  “You’re Mr. Holliman.  And she’s Mrs. Graves.”  I looked between them uncertainly.  “That is right, isn’t it?”\n\nHe was grinning and nodding as Mrs. Graves leaned forward to touch my head.  Something about it made me recoil in fear, and seeing that, she withdrew her hand back to her lap.  “Yes, that’s right.”  She paused a moment and then continued.  “And do you know who *you* are?”\n\nI felt a moment of panic that the answer wasn’t on my tongue immediately.  This was stupid.  Of course I had to know who I was.  Fumbling in the shrouded dark of my mind, I finally found what I was looking for.  “I’m…I’m Clint Thurman.  Aren’t I?”\n\nHolliman chuckled.  “See?  He’s going to be fine.  No doctors needed.”\n\n“I think I’m an investigative reporter?”\n\nHis face fell.  “Fuck.  Well, he’s bound to be a bit scrambled after…just give him some air.”\n\nGraves shot him another dark look before turning back to me.  “You aren’t a reporter, no.  You work for us.  You help us help people and stop bad things from…well, you help us stop bad things.”\n\nI frowned at her.  That sounded right, but it was more of a feeling than a memory.  “What’s wrong with me that I can’t remember?”\n\nHolliman crouched down again.  “You got your bell rung, kid.  Attacked by one of these ‘bad things’.  But we got you sorted out in time.”\n\nMy heart was pounding now.  “Attacked?  Is the thing that attacked me still here?”\n\nMrs. Graves’ expression darkened.  “No, it escaped.  After it attacked you, we weren’t sure where it went at first.  We were focused on trying to get you back.  And in those few seconds it found some break or flaw in the seal and crawled out through the crack.  So no need to worry.  It’s gone.”\n\nI heard myself responding with words I didn’t entirely understand.  “I sealed the room though.  I double-checked everything.”\n\nShe reached out hesitantly and patted my arm.  “It’s all right.  It was very powerful.  We’re still not sure how it was able to break through.”\n\nHolliman had started pacing a few feet away, but he paused and looked at me again with a frown.  “Yeah, mistakes are going to happen, kid.  We all fuck up from time to time.  Nothing to worry about.  Just glad you’re okay.  Seems like you’re remembering more too.”\n\nI nodded as I began to sit up weakly.  “I think I am, yeah.  My head is splitting and I kind of feel like everything I know is…loose?  Like it’s a bunch of melting icebergs.”  I looked past him to the bed.  “Is the client…did it get him?”\n\nHolliman glanced toward the bed and back to me.  “No, he’s fine.  Sleeping like a baby.”\n\nI jumped a little as I was struck by the memory of seeing the man’s head split open as the nightmare crawled free.  “But…I saw him die.  His head burst open.  I remember that now.”\n\nGraves nodded gently.  “We all do.  But it’s like…well, you may not remember this yet, but I’ve told you before about how these things…well, they warp reality when they come into this world.  I call it afterbirth, but you might think of it as a black hole.  Everything bends around their point of entry, and not everything you see or hear is real.  Or if it *is* real, it’s only real for a short time before normal reality snaps back into place.”\n\nI was interested in what she was saying, but I was also distracted by how terrified I felt.  Not just scared, but chilled to the bone like I’d been dipped in a frozen lake.  “I…can we leave now?  I want to leave now.”\n\nHolliman squatted down and slapped my leg.  “Sure, sure.  Let’s get you out to the car and then I’ll wake this poor bastard up and get everything squared.”\n\n“I’m awake.”\n\nHolliman’s eyes widened slightly as he turned and laughed.  “So you are.”  He grabbed me under the armpit while Mrs. Graves gripped my other arm.  Together they lifted enough for me to stand shakily on my own, and when I was upright, I looked over at the man strapped down to the bed.  He seemed fine at first, but the longer he looked at me, he started crying.  My employers were looking confused and concerned, but I already knew what was wrong.  Feet unsure, I stepped to the end of the bed.\n\n“Your name is Wallace, isn’t it?”\n\nHe nodded, eyes raw and nose wet.  “Yeah.  It is.”\n\n“But you remember going by Peter, don’t you?”\n\nHe nodded again, lips trembling.  “I do, yeah.”\n\n“And you remember being in the City?  With me?  For a long time?”\n\nThe man let out a small wail as he laid back on his pillow and closed his eyes tight.  “Oh *God*, I do!  I remember it all…too much.”\n\nShuddering, I turned and started walking for the door before I remembered it was still taped up.  I looked at Holliman.  “Please unseal this for me or I’ll rip the fucking door off the wall.”  His face flushed a little but he went over and stripped away the tape quickly before handing me the car keys and opening the door. \n\n“We’ll be out in a few minutes, kid.  Just go rest, okay?”\n\nI nodded absently as I started out of the room.  Graves followed me out, and when I stopped and looked at her, she drew closer, speaking in a lower voice.  “Normally the hosts don’t remember much of anything.  Do you know what he’s talking about?  Why he’s so upset?”\n\nLetting out a long breath, I took her hand and pressed the car keys back into them.  “Yeah, I have an idea.  He remembers being trapped in the same place I was.  He remembers killing himself.  Just like I remember watching it.”\n\nGraves stared at me speechless, but I didn’t give her much time to respond.  I turned and walked out of the apartment, the building, and on out into the night.  I felt exhausted and every step was hard, but I wasn’t going to get back in that fucking car with them.  I didn’t want to be around any of it any more.  And walking back home in the dark, hitching rides with strangers until I could get to a bus stop, was preferable at the moment.\n\nI was awake for the next thirty-six hours, and when I finally made it back home, I slept for another day and a half.  I’m glad I didn’t wake often during that time, because the few times I did, I was always terrified.  I’d jump out of bed, check my apartment, look outside, turn on the t.v., verifying as best I could that I was in the real world and not the City.  And then trembling and weeping, I would return to bed and tumble back asleep.\n\nI didn’t dream in that sleep, but it wasn’t entirely untroubled either.  I could sense that something was different, like the air pressure had suddenly shifted, but inside me instead of out in the world.  And when I finally did wake up for good, the feeling was still there.  I tried to tell myself I was imagining things, but I didn’t believe it.  My dad used to say that there are things that you think and things that you know, and the key to being wise is being able to tell the difference.\n\nAnd I knew something was wrong with me.\n\nOver the next month, I almost called them a dozen times.  Usually when the feeling of being watched or weighed down by something was at its worst, but a couple of days just because I missed them and the work, as stupid as that might sound.  I had enough money saved up that I didn’t have to find another job right away, and as angry and scared and sad as I’d been when I’d left them, I don’t think I’d quite given up on ever going back either.  Still, my hands would start trembling when I picked up my phone to call.  And when I answered Graves’ call,  I could barely breathe.\n\n“Hello?”\n\n“Hello, Clinton.  How’re you doing?”\n\n“Um, okay, I guess.  How’re you and Mr. Holliman?”\n\n“Well enough.  Missing you quite a bit.  The work you do, of course, but you as a person too.  We may be bad at showing it, but we’ve grown quite fond of you.”\n\nI swallowed and looked up at the ceiling.  I could feel her trying to put hooks into me again, but I wasn’t sure if I minded or not.  “Um, well, that’s nice.  I miss you guys too.  I just…I don’t know if I can do it any more.”\n\nThere was a pause and then.  “I understand.  And I don’t blame you for having worries about everything that’s happened.  But before we talk about any of that, how’ve you been doing really?  Any issues?  Sleeping okay?”\n\nMy heart started to beat faster.  She knew something.  “Sleeping okay, yeah.  But something seems off.  I feel like something’s over my shoulder all the time.”\n\n“Well, there may be.”\n\nThe phone creaked slightly as I gripped it harder.  “There may be?  What are you talking about?  Do I have something after me?”\n\n“Clinton, I really don’t know.  I doubt it’s the thing that attacked you.  I’ve been doing this for quite awhile, and the handful of times something has escaped, we’ve never had it come back and try to hunt us.”\n\nThere was the word.  Hunt.  I felt a chill go up my spine.  “Have you ever had one of them attack you?”\n\nAnother pause.  “Attack?  Yes.  I remember twice that I’ve seen Gordon get attacked and once myself when I was much younger.”\n\nGordon.  I’d never heard her call him by his first name before.  I wasn’t sure what it meant, but it didn’t matter at the moment.  I was scared and angry and desperate for answers.  “Did either of you get attacked like I did?  Pulled somewhere else?”\n\nShe was silent for several moments this time, and when she answered, her voice had a brittle sound to it.  “No.  Not like that.  I’ve never seen anything like that.”\n\nSucking in a breath, I nodded to myself.  Fuck fuck fuck.  “Okay.  What happened to me then?  What did it do to me?”\n\n“It…It jumped on you.  It was so fast.  And for a moment I could see it there, wrapped around your neck, breathing into your face…I wasn’t sure if it was stealing your breath or giving you some of its own.  And then it just faded away.  But not just it.  It…you…you started to flicker.”\n\n“Flicker?”\n\n“I’m sure it sounds strange, but I don’t know how else to describe it.  You never disappeared, but you weren’t fully there either, and as we watched, I could see you slipping out of our world like a dying heartbeat.  There and then not, there and then not.  I…I was afraid we would lose you for good.  So I pulled out the spare vial of Elixir and gave you a partial dose.  I didn’t know if it would work, but I couldn’t think of anything else to do.  And it worked.”\n\nI’d sat down on my sofa halfway through her words, and now I found the phone growing heavy in my hand.  “It was trying to take me all the way there, wasn’t it?”\n\n“I don’t know, Clint.  But I think so, yes.”\n\n“To keep me?”\n\n“Probably, yes.”\n\n“And you injected me with your…what is the Elixir, by the way?  How do you make it?”\n\n“We don’t.”\n\nI snorted softly.  “All right then.  Where does it come from?”\n\n“You know I can’t tell you that yet.  But if you continue working with us, in time…”\n\n“Oh, in time.  That’s right.  Always holding out a bone to keep the dumb dog in line, is that it?  Well I’m sick and fucking tired of just going along…”\n\n“Be quiet.”\n\n“What?  Listen, I’m just about…”\n\n“No, you need to shut up and listen.  Before this all gets much, much worse.”\n\nIt wasn’t the harshness of her tone that made me fall silent.  It was what was underneath that hard, cold surface.  Genuine concern, perhaps, and beyond that, something that sounded close to terror.  When I didn’t keep going, Mrs. Graves began to speak again.\n\n“This isn’t about what’s fair or what you want.  It’s about what’s real.  What’s happening and will happen.  There…There’s no rulebook for this stuff.  I learned from Gordon and now we’re trying to teach you.  But we didn’t trick you into this.  Or pick you for this life.  You were marked before we ever met you, same as I am.  Same as Gordon.”\n\nI let out a long breath.  “You had a nightmare too?  Like I had?  Like Wallace?”\n\n“Oh yes.  My family thought I was possessed by the devil.  Had locked me in the barn when Gordon came and helped me.  The same way we helped you when you were a little boy.  The same way you’re helping people now.”\n\n“Wallace didn’t look like he’d been helped when I left.”\n\n“But he’s alive, isn’t he?  And he’s doing much better now that he’s had time to heal.  And that’s what we’ve been giving you too.  Time to get over everything that happened.  Build back up for the work ahead.”\n\nI let out a shaky laugh.  “Mrs. Graves, I think I believe you, but I still don’t know if I can do this anymore.  I’m too afraid.”\n\n“Clint, do you ever think about the tape?”\n\n“The tape?”\n\n“Right.  The tape that you use to seal off the room.  Seal off the room against these terrible things that are nesting in these people.  Why do you think that something as simple as tape works against them escaping most of the time?”\n\n“I mean, it’s something you guys do to it, right?  Some kind of treatment or spell or something, I don’t know.  You won’t ever tell me half of what you do.”\n\n“I suppose that’s fair.  But no, it’s just tape.  We buy it in bulk online, and it’s a good quality duct tape, but it’s nothing special.  Not sprinkled with holy water or etched with magical runes.  Just tape.  Tape that shouldn’t give these things the slightest problem at all.”\n\nI frowned to myself alone in my living room.  “Okay.  So…why does it work?”\n\n“Because we have something protecting us.  Working through us.  It imbues some of our actions with a special weight so we can capture these nightmares.”\n\n“What like a guardian angel or something?”\n\nShe gave a soft laugh.  “You could look at it like that, sure.  But it has limitations.   We’re not invulnerable.  The night that Julia died, we would have probably died too if we hadn’t gotten out of the room in time.  But it does gives us some edge.  Some cushion.  Something that you won’t have if you don’t continue the work.”\n\nI felt my mouth go dry.  “So you’re saying that if I don’t continue working with you guys, I’m going to be alone.”\n\n“No, Clint.  I’m saying that if you don’t stay with us, you won’t be alone for long.  And that’s the problem.”\n\n**** \n\nTwo days later I was climbing back into the car.  Going with them to another job.  Not a house or an apartment this time.  [But a town named Braxton.](https://redd.it/m9djsl)\n\nWhen I asked Holliman why we were going there, there was none of his usual jokes or sarcasm.  I’d seen him just a few weeks earlier, but he seemed to have aged years since that night with Wallace.  I was wondering if he heard my question when he suddenly spoke in a low, quiet voice.\n\n“Because the town is wrong somehow.  At first, everyone was laughing.  Then they started killing each other.  Then they fell asleep.”\n\n“I…um, okay.  But what are we supposed to do about it?”\n\nHe raised his bloodshot eyes to mine in the rearview mirror, and I felt dread pooling in my chest like poison.  \n\n[“We have to wake them up.”](https://redd.it/10h9jfw)",

        "text": "I had walked these cobbled streets before. I had climbed the poplar tree at the walled off park by the pharmacy and broken my ankle tripping over the dodgy step with the rickety slab on Stonemason Way. This place had been home to me once, so why did it feel so very foreign? *Woe*, with a capital W; A sad little name for a town. It seemed to me that suffering had been etched into the stone they had built the place with. We didn’t stand a chance, *not here.*\n\nI walked with purpose towards my destination with unease tugging at my gut. The schoolhouse was in a lonely little street under the shadow of a great mountain called *Ben Thagad*. I crossed the threshold into the playground with apprehension.\n\nThe hop-scotch was faded and the chute was rusted orange. The vines that climbed up the red-brick walls were withered and now hung limp. The years had been unkind to my old school.\n\n“Harry!” An oddly familiar voice came from the climbing frame. It belonged to a man dressed in a shoddy leather jacket. He was leant against the playground equipment with a rollup in-between his lips that smelt a little too pungent to be tobacco. \n\nNo - *couldn’t be?*  “Been what - fifteen years - do you even remember me?” \n\nWith a sad realization I put a warmly familiar name to the unkempt individual.\n\n“Bertie. You’ve grown a beard.” If the years had been unkind to the schoolyard, they had been ruthless with Robert Grieves, otherwise known as Bertie, my old best friend. He was skinny, gaunt and didn’t look like he’d shaved in a fortnight. \n\n“I didn’t reckon you’d come, *nobody did*. How’s the big city fancy pants.” He slapped me on the shoulder as a brother might have to a sibling. \n\n“It’s different, that’s for sure. In truth I didn’t come home for the reunion - I was in the area anyway to visit my mum in St Fry’s and thought I may as well pop over to see what this was all about - *school reunions aren’t really my thing*.” I spoke candidly, Bertie twitched and held out his spliff. I shook my head. I’d had my fair share of the devil’s lettuce at university and it gave me splitting migraines. \n\n“All the crews here. Charlie, Cabbage, Wee Jimmy - *the FBI.*” Bertie chuckled.\n\n*The FBI*, the crappy name of our little rag-tag group of misfits. We’d built tree-houses, climbed mountains and tried to solve - \n\n“It’s weird Harry, I had a dream last night that she was here. *Miss Salt* \\- that she was going to turn up at the reunion. I thought it was real for a second. When I woke up all the hairs on my arms were standing up...” Bertie grimaced. \n\nWe entered the school hall and awkwardly shuffled around the gymnasium, socialising and bragging, Bertie didn’t do much of the latter. I saw a few familiar faces; teachers I recalled as young, were now prostrated by many years of the education system. We found Cabbage and Wee Jimmy - they worked together at the mechanic's on Main street.\n\nCharlie was there too, he had a husband and three kids and Cabbage seemed uneasy around him for this very reason.\n\nI caught up with Bethany Small too - she was a teacher at the school now, bright and happy. She was a walking miracle, when she was young she had leukaemia, it was terminal. Against all odds she made it. The locals like to brag it was the quality of the tap water.\n\nWhen the night was nearly over I found Bertie again, stood at her old photo amidst a collection of many other teachers and principals. Dusty and lonely on the wall she sat; *Miss Salt.* \n\nIt takes a special sort of person to become etched into your mind so perfectly that you can still see their face clear as day twenty years later. Miss Salt had been beautiful with big rosy-pink cheeks and lips like rosebuds. She only ever wore red and even her hair had been a lovely rich auburn. She’d been everyone's first crush. \n\nShe was kind too. Do you know how rare that is? someone beautiful *and* kind. Every Friday morning she’d bring giant blueberry muffins into class and let us watch videos instead of equations.\n\nThen one Friday she was gone and we never saw her again. She vanished from Woe as if she had never been here at all. We searched for her, Bertie and me most of all. We weren’t convinced she’d just left for another job, for surely she would have said goodbye first? \n\nWe formed the FBI to look for her. None of the adults would tell us where she went, and we got into our heads that they were holding her hostage somewhere as she had fed us too many blueberry muffins. Childhood antics - the sort bored young minds concoct in small boring towns. \n\n“Remember that time we scoped out Mr Walker’s property cause we caught him digging a hole in his garden?” Bertie chuckled as he took a fistful of muffins he’d pinched from the buffet table out his pockets. He shovelled them into his mouth with ruthless proficiency. \n\n“Poor plonker, it turned out he was digging a hole for his cat, not a body. Gave us a right good hit with that rake of his. Miss Salt's probably teaching at some private school now. Living it up.\" I sighed wistfully. I hoped she was; that she’d gotten out of this depressing pit of despair like I had. \n\n\"I know it can’t be easy for you to be back here after your dad.” Bertie said to me softly after a moment’s silence. “I’m glad you got out. Got free of this place, I mean. Do yourself a favour and don’t stay too long, or you’ll end up like me. High as a kite and no better place to be on a saturday than school - or like your - like your dad.”\n\nI saw it again; blue feet dangling and the light fixture half-pulled out of the wall as the weight of a man, garrotted with rope pulled it down. I still don’t know why he did it. \n\n“What do you say we go to the *Fork and Sheep?*” Bertie whispered to me, face squinted as he swirled a mouthful of cheap wine. “I want something stronger than this - this - echo falls shit.” \n\nThe Fork and Sheep was our local; the only pub in town. Outsiders and city-folk don't understand how important the local pub is. It’s a hub; a melting pot of personalities and gossip. Town halls sit empty while politics is poured into pint glasses and slot machines. We’d been drinking there since we’d been old enough to source fake IDs. \n\nBertie and I found a quiet booth in the corner, just beside the women’s toilets. The place stunk of stale ale and the floors, deep mahogany, were sticky and grimy. \n\n“There’s something I never told you, Harry, I’ve been wanting to all night.” Bertie said, his voice was wavering and weary. I could taste the weed and lager on his breath from across the table. “It’s about Miss Salt.”\n\n“Bertie, we were kids who missed our favourite teacher, bored out of our minds and desperate for something exciting to happen in our little dump of a town.” I leaned across the table. “Nothing happened to her. Get it out of your head alright? “\n\n“You remember it, I know you do.” Bertie’s voice was low. He spoke with fluent paranoia only a stoner could muster. “You remember but you don’t want to, you’ve put it to the back of your head where you don’t have to find it everyday, that little niggle, that raw tug of instinctual dread. That night, Harry, you know the one, the night where all the adults went up the mountain.”\n\nI see it now. An empty bed, my father’s jacket absent from it’s hook and the patio doors wide open. The imprint of my mother’s boots in the wet mud outside and the dim crowd of torchlight walking up the hill towards the mountain - towards Ben Thagad; a slow procession of trance-like light.\n\n“So they went for a hike, what of it?” I grunted. \n\n“In the cold of the night, every single one, without telling the kids? Shame they didn’t have the real FBI on it - just us silly kids. Bet Fox Mulder woulda had something to say.” Bertie looked around the pub suspiciously. He reached into his pocket and pulled it out, a journal so familiar to me I almost recoiled at the sight of it.\n\n*THE FBI* \\- INVESTIGATION INTO THE DISAPPEARANCE OF GUINEVERE SALT\n\n“I’m not doing this with you Bertie, not tonight. I wish you well but I’m not partaking in your delusions, not anymore. I grew up.” I stood up. The scraping of my chair brought all the eyes in the room to us and for the briefest of moments I felt as odd and as paranoid as Bertie. \n\n“Just take it, read it. You’ll see it if you do - like I do. We were kids then, you’re right, we were too innocent to imagine.” He thrusted the book at me.\n\nI felt too awkward to reject him so I departed from the *Fork and Sheep* and Bertie with the weighty journal in tow.  \n\nWhen I returned home that night, as midnight encroached I found that sleep eluded me. I found myself in my tired emptiness cleaving to those worn and aged pages. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;**COLLECTED EVIDENCE (SO FAR)**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Strand of red hair from firepit at the top of the mountain.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Red lipstick casing found in the burn with scorch marks  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Mud sample from Harry’s dad’s shoe.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Cabbage’s mum’s scarf with speck of blood on it.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;One adult molar tooth found by firepit (Probably a deer’s - Harry)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Miss Salt’s rosary beads taken from Bethany Small’s locker  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Strange vibrating device found in Charlie’s mom’s bedside drawer\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;**SUMMARY OF EVENTS OF 12/04/1980 - by Robert Grieves**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Miss Salt leaves class early at 3pm and allows us to have free time until the school bell rings. She seems flustered and keeps looking over her shoulder. Bethany Small is very sick and is always upset, so Miss Salt gives her her rosary beads and a cuddle on the way out.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Bethaani Samll’s got a BALDY - CABBAGEEE - ROFL   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Cabbage’s father fixes a lock onto his bedroom door on the outside. Harry’s dad comes home from work early and spends time in the garage. Charlie’s mum is groaning in her bedroom and is surprised when Charlie gets home from school early. My parents, are absent as usual. Wee Jimmy said that his dad was cutting firewood, and lots of it, even though it’s summer.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;That night at approximately 2am, Cabbage hears his parents leave. He’s unable to follow them as his door has been locked. Wee Jimmy notes that his parents too were gone that night, but he was undisturbed by this, instead using their absence to eat butter straight out of the tub. Charlie slept through the night.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Harry’s account is most interesting. He wakes up and finds his parents gone as well as their coats - he goes outside and investigates. His house has a view up the mountain and he sees lots of adults walking up the mountain with torches. He says it must have been at least half the town.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Miss Salt is never seen again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;**INTERVIEW WITH PRINCIPAL PHELPS - By Robert Grieves and Harry McBride.**   \n&gt;  \n&gt;RG : Where is Miss Salt Principal?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;P: Get back to class  \n&gt;  \n&gt;HM: She promised she’d give us feedback on our homework sir, do you know when she will be returning?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;P: She isn’t returning. I will assess future assignments until a replacement is procured. Back to class.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;RG: We know you were up the mountain two nights ago.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Principal Phelps looks uneasy and is silent.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;P: Detention. Now!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;**INTERESTING INFORMATION MISC**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Ben Thagadh roughly means “chosen mountain” in gaelic - is this important?   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Miss Salt was from Oxfordshire - Was she killed because she is an outsider?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The buzzing device found in Charlie’s mums’ drawer stopped working after we played with it for a while and had sticky residue on it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We saw Mr Jenkin’s burying something in his garden. Upon investigation we found it was his dog. He hit me with a rake. Mr Jenkins has a history of violent behaviour.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Everyone had pork broth for breakfast. Wee Jimmy says his tasted funny and had a bit of muscle in it.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Bethany Small’s hair has grown back and Principal Phelp’s bald patch has gone.    \n&gt;  \n&gt;My mum gave me a cuddle, she never does this, she said she was sorry and regrets bringing me into such an awful world.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Charlie's mums shopping list we found in the rubbish bin that listed the following: Carrot's, Spuds, Lube, Butcher's twine, hair shaver, tweezers, duct tape, beef stock cube.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Harry’s dad dies. Wee Jimmy’s dad told him it was suicide, but Harry insists he died fighting a bear that broke in to their house. \n\nI gulped and dropped the journal to my knees. I felt it. I felt that feeling of dread and disgust gathering at the back of my head- the gnawing tog that Bertie so eloquently relayed. I tried to push it down, to explain it away, but it wouldn’t go. It was part of me now. It was as Bertie described, an instinctive feeling, as primal as it was undeniable. \n\nI kept reading. Bertie had been a prolific writer and the journal was packed full. There were drawings of Miss Salt and maps of the mountain and the town. As the journal went on the handwriting grew neater and the dates that ordered the pages grew more recent. \n\nTalk of Charlie’s mother’s vibrator was abandoned and replaced with complex timelines of how Miss Salt went from teaching us to gone without a trace. There were long sprawling texts on mayan ritual sacrifice and UFO activity in the mountains of Scotland. There talk of shared mental delusions. ROANOKE had been scrawled, so harshly that the pages had been bent from the pressure applied by the mad scribe. \n\nHe had never stopped. \n\nI had left for university and found a job in the bank. Charlie had come out the closet that had bound him for so long and found a husband and happiness. Wee Jimmy and Cabbage had fixed god knows how many cars and. through all of it - all those long empty years -Robert Grieves, my dear Bertie, had kept this journal. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;**RITUAL SACRIFICE**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Throught out history Woe has been host to Celts, pagans and picts. All but the Celts have a demonstrated proclivity towards human sacrifice. The Picts in particular are interesting to consider.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It is said that when the Roman empire came to Scotland to add it to its empire, the picts were the solitary reason for their inability to progress north. So frightened were they that they built a giant wall to keep them out of Roman lands.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Tall, red-headed and fierce warriors they were, but also deeply in touch with forces that the civilised Romans had long since abandoned for Papyrus and sewage systems.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Rowan McKintyre, author of Pictish Runes and Magical Systems, states that the \"picts often consulted with the stars\" and that they would often offer sacrifices on mountains and hills or \"any high ground to maintain a close distance to the stars.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Cecilia Corday in her seminal work Pictish Architecture in the Highlands, states that there was indentation suggestive of a wooden temple on the top of Ben Thagad in Woe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;**UFO SIGHTINGS IN WOE**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;1862 - English author George Hancock on a visit to Woe states that he saw a a string of odd lights in the sky above Ben Thagad. Curious he hiked the mountain and found a strange stone with a Pictish rune on it. This was an interesting archaeological find and is now in the Kelvingrove Art museum.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;1920 - There's an article in a local newspaper explaining the interaction between a woman named Heather Tipple and a strange light whilst hiking Thagad. She said it came towards her and danced around her head. (Fairy activity??)\n\nThe last entry was his magnum opus - a collation of all his theories and work - a case so well-presented it might have convinced even the most dubious of jury’s. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;**WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT**   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Woe is a sick town, in every way imaginable. Tragedy marks this land and the mountain we live under. Ben Thagadh - The Chosen Mountain - Chosen for what? A holy place? I don’t think so. There is nothing holy about that dreaded peak. You can still see it, the soft divet in the land from where the firepit was all those years ago, the firepit where she was cooked alive.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Miss Salt had felt uneasy for a while. She had felt the incessant stares on her back and noticed the whispering. She did not know just what she was in for - otherwise she would have surely fled - she ignored that feeling of raw unexplainable fear. I so very wish she hadn’t.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Perhaps it was suggested by Bethany Small’s mother. Bethany was terminally ill with almost no hope of survival. Desperation is a funny motivator. Maybe it was her father, or maybe it was Principal Phelps who wanted his hair back.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The townsfolk agreed, some grudgingly, others eagerly. None refused, perhaps fearful that they might be offered instead. They picked a date and a time and carried out their task with ruthless proficiency.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Perhaps it was Mr Jenkin’s that grabbed her that night, I don’t know, he was certainly strong enough. They all gathered and took her up that mountain. They weren’t careful enough. They left behind a tooth and a lipstick case, all that was left to mark her fleeting presence.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Some couldn’t live with themselves after the gory act. Harry’s father found refuge in the noose. Bethany Small’s mother is addicted to prescription painkillers and Mr Jenkins drinks enough to warrant a brewery in his name.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;It’s strange, we all think we saw her for the last time at school. I do not believe that to be true. We saw her once more, we just didn’t know it was her.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;We all had the same pork broth at breakfast that morning, but it was not pork, not really.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;My grandma always said that there was nothing like a broth to get the sick feeling well again. Woe needed a lot of broth.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;I worry that it will soon need more.",

I trotted down the stairs to join my brother in the living room. He was holding onto his cell phone with a white-knocked grip. When he looked up at me, it was with wide, empty eyes.\n\n\"That was Dad,\" he told me. \"I just got off the phone with him.\"\n\n\"What did he say?\" I asked, the hairs on my neck standing on end.\n\n\"Okay, so… he picked up the third time I called and I told him I was here. With you.\" Casimir let out a deep sigh, raking a slender hand through his hair. \"I think he kind of got an idea about what was going on then already. He went all quiet and then I said, *we know what you did*, and he said he wanted to come over. He'll be here in a few days.\"\n\nI swallowed thickly. \"He will?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" Cas lightly kicked the wooden floorboards. \"That's okay with you, right?\"\n\n\"I guess so. But this isn't gonna end well. He's gonna… I-I'll have to…\" My voice faltered. \"I mean, he killed people. He wanted to kill the woods.\" *Probably even me,* I added in my mind. \n\n\"Yeah. I know. And whatever you're gonna do, I'll have your back.\"\n\nI stepped forward and wrapped him into a hug. He sighed into my shoulder. \n\n*Little brother.* \n\nI don't know why, but those two words have never felt this wonderful up until now. \n\n\"I love you.\" My voice was low and brittle. \n\n\"I love you, too, Fi.\"\n\nWarm, peaceful silence. Casimir's heated cheek pressing against mine as snowflakes started raining from the steel-gray sky outside, the wind gluing them to the windowpanes. And then, all of a sudden, a choked sob. \n\n\"Fiona, I need to tell you something.\" \n\nIt came out as a shaky plea whispered against the side of my head. Cas didn't untangle himself from our embrace.\n\n\"Alright,\" I answered, holding him a little tighter.\n\n\"I-I can't. I don't…\" He faltered and trailed off. \"I need you to know but it feels too strange to say.\"\n\n\"Is it a big thing?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Do you maybe wanna tell me bit by bit?\"\n\n\"Okay. Yeah, uh, that might work.\" He straightened up, raising his head. \"You know how I said I took time off to come here? That wasn't entirely true. I quit.\" \n\n\"You quit?\" I repeated, perplexed but making an effort to keep my tone steady and gentle. I didn't want to pry too much. Cas nodded, and I narrowed my eyes at him. \"I thought you loved your job.\"\n\n\"I did. But that's not how I want to spend my time anymore.\" He squared his shoulders. \"That's all I wanna say at the moment. I don't wanna be weird or rude or whatever, I just… need to get my head straight. It's really nice to be here with you, though—I want you to know that.\"\n\nOminous. I still forced a smile. \"That's fine. And you can stay for however long you like.\" I meant it. The money wasn't a problem. Actually, something occurred to me—with the property obscured from the eyes of outsiders, perhaps I could let some of the workers go in the near future. It'd be sad and probably cause me some more headaches down the line, but that way, I could easily afford to entertain multiple people at the estate with a little more financial security and peace of mind. Then again, that would mean I'd have to uphold my dealings with Nick… not the most pleasant prospect. Whatever the case, I would do anything to keep my brother around.\n\n\"Thanks for having me. There's no place I'd rather be.\" He cleared his throat. \"The guards made it through the earthquake okay, by the way. It was a shock, obviously, but nobody's hurt.\"\n\nI nodded slowly. \"I'll send them home for the next couple days. Shit is gonna go down hard soon and I don't want to have them around for it. We don't really need any help right now, and keeping them around would only be putting them into unnecessary danger.\"\n\n\"Okay. Yeah, that's sensible, I guess.\"\n\nI went about making the necessary calls, seeing each of the employees out as they passed by the house on their way off the property. Most of them didn't really question my unexplained decision. Gus was the only one who showed definitive concern. He tried to ask me if something was wrong, but I blew him off as gently as I could. I did think he deserved an explanation, but it was for the best. He gave in eventually and left, but not before throwing a glance back at me with that trusting yet reproachful look that kind of reminded me of an old, grumpy dog. \n\n\"So what now?\" Cas asked as I shut the door behind the senior employee. \n\n\"I guess we wait.\" \n\nFirst, I went upstairs. My father coming back was definitely a grave occasion, so I figured I'd have to look the part the next couple days. I can't say why exactly I cared—Lord knows I don't have any regard for the man. But I did want him to see me as a serious head of the house, someone who knows what she's doing. So I ended up picking the simplest and least flashy dress I owned; the kind of thing I normally only wear on dates. \n\nYup, I've done dates like this. I go out with normal people! It's not like I'm a total freak. Most folks were pretty taken aback by the whole wedding gown-thing, but not enough not to look past it for at least a little while. \n\nCasimir and I spent the rest of the day watching movies. That was actually pretty nice, and while I couldn't dispel the thoughts of emotionally distant fathers and intrusive Devils showing up around the house, I rather enjoyed myself. It helped that the sweaters Cas had taken to wearing around the house are incredibly soft, so I could rest my head on him like a pillow. The evening brought more snow and calming reprieve. It felt weird looking out at the treeline and knowing that for the first time in ages, there wasn't a single human back there. I couldn't help but wonder how many corpses would show up once it would begin to thaw. For now, they'd lie in silence, slowly getting covered up in layers and layers of white. The thought made me shiver, despite striking me as oddly poetic. \n\nTwo mornings later, our doorbell rang. \n\nIt was so weird that the man whose arrival I had been dreading so much would simply come up to the house and ring the doorbell. I would have expected him to make an entrance like the ones Nick had been treating me to. Of course I'd known that wasn't actually going to happen, but it still made me feel sort of underwhelmed. \n\nI sat down at the head of the kitchen table, back straight, hands in my lap. \"Do I look serious?\" I asked Cas, nervously fiddling with the lace sleeve of my dress.\n\n\"Sure. Just stop shaking and you're good to go. Should I open?\"\n\n\"Please do,\" I said softly.\n\nCas nodded grimly, wiping his sweat-laced palms on his pants. \"R-right,\" he breathed, looking this way and that before turning on his heel and heading for the door. I heard him pulling it open and exchanging awkward words of greeting with a rugged-voiced man. \n\nI tried to focus on my breathing to soothe my nerves.\n\n*In. Out. In. Out.*\n\nHeavy footsteps in the hallway.\n\n*In. Out. In. Out.*\n\nI clenched my fingers into fists to stop them from trembling. Why was I afraid of him? \n\n*In. Out. In. Out.*\n\nFloorboards creaking under his weight.\n\n*In. Out. In. Out.*\n\nMy brother's voice, introducing us like we didn't know each other. \"So, Dad… remember your eldest? You guys haven't spoken in how long again?\" \n\nNo response.\n\n*In. Out. In. Out.*\n\nI turned to face him.\n\nMy father had changed since I'd last seen him. His large, once handsome face had gained an abundance of wrinkles and two extra chins. His pale green eyes were bloodshot with deep bags beneath them and his reddened face told a story of someone who'd been to the bottoms of far too many bottles. How strange, for a man of his faith.\n\nIt had been a long time since I'd last attempted to focus on somebody's aura, but this time, I did. Mostly, it just made me feel weird. My father's energy bore a slight trace of the supernatural, though not in the way I was used to seeing. He must have been dabbling with witchcraft, though it was hard to tell what kind.\n\n\"Maxwell. Please take a seat,\" I said coldly, gesturing at the chair across from me. \n\nThe response was a mere grunt as he moved over, slowly letting himself sink into the cushion. We locked eyes. There was no love in his gaze, not even a hint of affection. No surprises there.\n\n\"Good to see you, girl,\" he said tonelessly. \n\nI let out a bitter laugh. \"Of course. So, Daddy, you've been busy. Care to tell me what the *fuck* your game is?\"\n\n\"Nothing you could understand.\"\n\n\"Then why are you here, if not to explain yourself?\"\n\n\"I've come to end this.\"\n\n\"Well, go right ahead. I'd very much like for you to cease your attempts at undermining me, wholly unsuccessful though they've been so far.\"\n\nMaxwell leaned forward on his elbows. \"Will you hear me out, then?\"\n\n\"I certainly will. And I have a ton of questions.\"\n\nDad shrugged. \"Might actually be easier that way. Go ahead.\"\n\nI swallowed thickly. \"Why do you look fifteen minutes away from dying?\"\n\n\"I have high blood pressure, digestive problems and my heart seems to be in some kind of trouble as well. As you may have guessed from my looks, that all happened due to severe use of alcohol. I'm past saving at this point; I know I'll be drinking myself to death. Sooner rather than later, I believe.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" That was the only sound I could produce as I regarded my father with raised brows. The clarity with which he spoke was nothing short of determined. \"Wh… how? Why are you doing that to yourself?\"\n\nMaxwell shrugged. \"That's just how it is. It's been going on for a long time now. I'm well aware I won't be there to see the good that my work will do, and I know that I, too, live sinfully, but I know that it will be worth it.\"\n\n\"What will be worth it?\"\n\n\"There's a power struggle going on at the moment. Chaos and order. They're at an imbalance, for reasons greater than your comprehension. And whether you like it or not, you happen to be a part of it. Your woods, to be exact.\"\n\n\"Ah. You're about to go on about that whole unclaimed territory-thing, aren't you? I've heard it before.\" I stapled my fingers, tilting my head at him. \"Your adversary's filled me in.\"\n\n\"So it's true. Don't get me wrong, I knew you had dealings with the Devil, but it's something else to hear you say it.\" He exhaled, leaning back in his chair. \"I'm not even all that surprised. My daughter, hell's whore.\"\n\n\"What did you just call her?\" Cas growled, his voice deeper and angrier than I'd ever heard before. He was still standing beside the table, almost as if he expected the situation to escalate at any second and didn't trust the momentary calm enough to sit down.\n\n\"I will not have you speak to me like that under my roof,\" I said sternly. \"You've got no authority here anymore. You're a guest, at best, and not even a beloved one. If you want to leave here in one piece, you should watch your mouth.\"\n\n\"Don't you get it? I don't care what you're gonna do to me. It doesn't matter. I have literally nothing to lose.\" \n\n\"I'll make you eat those words,\" I promised somberly. \n\nDad merely chuckled. He was definitely not the easiest person to intimidate. \"You're just like your mom, you know that? A self-serving, stupid little cu—\"\n\nBefore he could finish that sentence, Cas had slapped his square across the face. Our father let out a low groan as he slowly reached up to rub his jaw. \"You've got a… a strong right arm there, son,\" he muttered, seemingly making an effort to sound relaxed. \n\n\"So do you want *it*, too? The sleeping entity?\" I asked impatiently.\n\n\"You really are well informed. Yes, I do. So, do you happen to know where to find it?\" \n\n\"Yup. Not gonna tell you, though. I guess I could, but you aren't making a sound argument by calling me names.\"\n\n\"You're saying you'd refuse to give up such important information purely out of spite?\" \n\n\"Yeah, pretty much. But I also really don't think this is a good decision. There has always been a balance between chaos and order, why rock the boat now?\"\n\nMy father let out a long-suffering sigh. \"Because the situation is more volatile than it used to be.\"\n\n\"Since you're not going to explain yourself further, I stand by what I said. I have a responsibility towards the woodland denizens. Removing the sleeper from these grounds could be dangerous. I don't think an entity that powerful will take lightly to being roused. I happen to have made it stir in its sleep not too long ago, and it ended up being a mild natural catastrophe. I don't want to imagine what it could do if it lashed out. Especially since a trusted source has told me that it is, in fact, probably highly intelligent. It's made people go insane in the past. It can appear anywhere, anytime, if it so pleases. This thing waking up and wreaking havoc… that's not something I wanna risk.\" I straightened my back, fixing my father with a resolute gaze. \"I'll protect my land at all costs.\"\n\nMaxwell scoffed. \"You and your land, it's always the *fucking* land… Why would you even care about this place? I never understood that. It was like that when you were a kid, too. One moment you were chewing my ear off about wanting to go and be a movie star, or make a career in fashion, and the next you'd go spouting all that same nonsense your mother did when I first met her! Old family duties and all that crap… Fiona, the world is not a big fucking forest anymore! These creatures who live here might seem powerful to you, but they're some of the last of their kind—and good riddance, too. The world *belongs to us* now.\"\n\n\"Not this part of the world,\" I said, not missing a beat. I flinched when the large man brought his hand down on the table with a slam.\n\n\"I knew it! I fucking knew you'd be that way! That's why I pulled all this off. I figured, maybe, with a couple good blows to your little system, you'd realize how vulnerable you are, but *no*, my daughter is as hard-headed as she is slutty.\"\n\n\"Why the fuck are you talking to her like this?\" Cas barked, fire in his eyes. \n\n\"Why aren't *you*?\" Dad shot back. \"All this woman has ever done is hog your mother's attention, making her forget about the rest of us by crawling up her ass!\"\n\n\"I didn't crawl up— What the hell are you even on about?\" I snapped.\n\n\"You did! You know why your mother liked you best? You know why you were her *little princess*? She wanted *you* to live the life she'd planned for herself, before—\"\n\n\"Before you got in the way,\" I interrupted him, voice low with sudden understanding. \n\nMy father rose from his chair. \"I tried… I *tried* to change her. Do you think I was happy, having to live here? Taking on *her* last name? That's not how it was supposed to be… When I met her, I thought she needed a firm hand, you know, just to guide her to the right path. And she seemed open to it. And then she got pregnant with you, and we got married, and I had to come live in this *den of freaks*, and she… she…\"\n\n\"She regretted it,\" I finished his sentence for him.\n\nMy father let out a sharp scream as he hurled himself across the table, the wood screaming in protest, but he didn't quite reach me. For a moment, he flopped around helplessly, trying to grab me as I jumped up and scurried away from him. \n\n\"What are you doing?\" Casimir yelled, gripping the back of the older man's shirt and forcibly dragging him to the floor in a display of surprising strength. I'd forgotten how fit my little brother actually was. He was still rather clumsy when it came to hand-to-hand, though, and it showed when my father pulled him down with him and struck him square across the face. I instantly lunged forward, flinging myself on top of my father as well, but he pushed me right off, sending me rolling aside. My head connected with the floorboards with a dull pain, and it took me some effort to push myself back up, my vision blurry.\n\nI screamed in horror when I saw that Dad had climbed on top of Casimir and was viciously slamming his upper body down onto the floor, meaty hands clutching his shoulders. Cas fell limp before I could reach him. Maxwell slowly rose to his feet, breathing heavily as he removed the handgun from my brother's waistband. \"That boy… shoulda shot me when he had the chance,\" he pressed out, breathing heavily.\n\nI choked out a sob as my eyes darted between Cas and him. I didn't have time to form any clear thoughts. I just kept repeating the word *no* in my head over and over again, like a mantra. Dad raised the gun, proceeding towards me as he faced me with an icy calm. His mouth lifted into a cruel smile, his swollen lips reminding me of twin caterpillars. \"Tell me where it is, Fiona.\"\n\n\"You're insane.\"\n\nHow was this man my Dad? How in the world was he pointing a weapon at me? \n\nThis was not how this was going to end. Throwing one last look at my unconscious brother, I sent a prayer to… I didn't even know who. I didn't care. *Let him be okay. For fuck's sake, let him be okay, or I'll turn the world upside down.* Then, I took off running.\n\nMy only chance. My father wouldn't shoot me dead; I'd be useless to him that way, but I wasn't going to give him the chance to incapacitate me. I sprinted towards the front door, tearing it open and bursting outside. The snow crunched beneath my boots as I raced across the frozen ground. The fabric of my dress stretched wider, groaning with every leap that I took, until the tight long skirt finally ripped along the side, leaving it fluttering around my legs in the wind. *Aleksei. Please don't be far.* If I could just reach him in time, he'd be able to help me. I turned my head to find my father following behind me. His face was bright red and he was already gasping for air. He might have been stronger than me, but goddamn, was he slow.\n\nI was approaching the Twin Lakes rapidly, the abandoned black mill looming overhead like a specter. *No time to slow down.* I ran right onto the ice, only to instantly lose my footing and skitter across the frozen surface. My fall was humiliatingly unceremonious and extremely painful. I landed on my chest, the impact knocking the air out of my body, leaving me gasping for breath in desperation. My arms were shaking too much to push me back up, and I cursed my own stupidity as I realized I had literally no strength left within me. \n\nThat's when I heard a sharp yell.\n\nMy father had reached me, stumbling after me onto the ice. But he wasn't able to keep his balance any longer than I had. He howled in shock as he tripped and fell, the gun slipping from his fingers and sliding across the lake, coming to a halt out of our reach. I glanced at it for a second, then back at the struggling man before lunging for the weapon.\n\nI would have liked to, at least.\n\nAs it was, all I could do in my state was to hastily crawl towards it. My father appeared to have been struck with the same idea—I heard him wheezing and choking as he crept up the slippery surface. I was just relieved that the layer of ice was thick enough to support our joint weight. \n\n\"You bitch,\" he gritted out. \"You're gonna doom us all!\"\n\nI looked back at him, meeting a bloodshot gaze amidst a contorted expression. His mouth hung open, blood gushing from his nose and lower lip—he seemed to have fallen onto his face. He made for a dreadful sight. He somehow managed to draw himself up, staggering over to me and throwing his entire weight onto my already aching body. I let out a cry of agony, feeling a *crack* somewhere inside of me, though I couldn't tell where. I had been reduced to a squirming heap of pain. He rolled off of me again, then made for the gun, and this time, he got a hold of it. I flopped over onto my back, staring at the cold gray sky as my chest rose and fell unsteadily. Once more, I couldn't seem to take in enough air. I whimpered as my father pushed himself into my field of vision, the muzzle of the gun pointed at my head.\n\nAt that moment, he reminded me of Jeremy. Those same milky, crazed eyes that seemed to pierce my own with their glare; the way every crease in his face appeared to exude hatred… \n\n\"This is so fucked up,\" I whispered, desperately searching his features for some semblance of mercy.\n\n\"Where is it, Fiona?\"\n\nI couldn't seem to focus. \"You're supposed to be my Dad… You stupid piece of shit…\"\n\n\"Where is it?\" He leveled the gun at my kneecap, bending down to touch its end to the exposed skin. \"This is gonna hurt, you know.\"\n\n\"I know,\" I said softly, closing my eyes. \n\n\"So where is it?\"\n\nI stayed silent. \n\nHe sighed, I heard him cock the gun and then *scream in shock.*\n\nMy eyes flew open to see that he had let go of the gun which was now resting right beside my leg. He'd jumped to his feet and was furiously patting at his jacket sleeve as smoke rose from the fabric. Out of nowhere, it lit up into a large flame, searing his flesh and drawing howls of agony and raw, deadly fear from his throat. The horror of the sight had me paralyzed for just a moment, frozen to the spot before snapping out of it. I reached for the firearm, hurrying to put the safety back on as I stumbled away from my dad. His cries cut through the silence of the woods, each one shaking me to my very core as I watched on in complete bewilderment. \n\n\"You fucking witch! What did you do to me?\" he bellowed, throwing himself onto the ground to try and smother the flames that were slowly but deliberately lapping away at his arm. \n\nAfraid the ice was going to give in, I backed off onto dry land, still unable to tear my eyes off the writhing man. My heart was racing, my head reeling—I had no idea what was happening. And then, all of a sudden, I felt something I can only describe as a \"disturbance in the force\". A ripple of energy, or perhaps just an instinct compelled me to turn and look over at the black gristmill. There was a figure standing just outside of the old building. A short, broad one, dressed in all black, staring intently at my father.\n\nI couldn't contain myself. Before I even knew what I was doing, a sharp cry of joy had left my lips, and I found myself stumbling over to the other person on wobbly legs. Every step hurt, straining muscles I didn't even know I had. I stopped a few feet ahead of the newcomer. The gun dropped from my trembling hands, sinking into the snow, and I followed shortly after. Before my upper body could hit the ground though, I felt strong arms wrap around me, holding me up. \n\n*This was like a fairy tale. Sure, I was bleeding and aching all over, and the tongue that moved to lick the warm tears of my face was rough and forked, but still. This was like a fucking fairy tale.*\n\nJacek pulled back, tilting his head at me with a lopsided smile.\n\nI mirrored the movement before everything turned black.\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)\n\n[Part

        "text": "Part 1:  \n\nI stomped out what remained of the cigarette and got back in the car. I could feel the nicotine working, both heightening and calming my senses simultaneously. I was wired in and ready. I clicked off the hazards and steered onto the road, then took a right turn onto a gravel path which led up to Kelsie P’s residence.\n\nThe trees seemed to close-in around the path like French claw-clips around a couple fingers. Even with my brights on, the winding road never allowed for more than ten yards of visibility. I rolled the window down and listened to the crackling melody of small stones crunching under Bess’s Continentals, and the persistent falling of rain against the hood. I checked the map, then lifted my eyes and saw the gravel path fork off to the right, fleeing from the large clearing that was Kelsie P’s driveway.\n\nAnd what a driveway it was. \n\nOne moment I was in Northern Illinois, driving on a gravel path through a quasi-forest. And the next I was in a Westminster Abbey courtyard. The rough road smoothed out into a cobblestone square, enclosed by a brick half-wall which picketed around the property, separating it from the natural surroundings. The only entrance was a gate, already opened, which was straddled between two marble obelisks. \n\nI entered.\n\nThe building, which could most aptly be referred to as a chateau, was set at the end of a topiary garden. Two rows of geometrically shaped hedges bordered a wide walkway leading up to a set of cement stairs and a porch. I pulled through the cobblestone square and entered what from the sky would have looked like the handle of a giant briefcase, then parked at the precipice of the walkway. \n\nThe rain was coming down pretty hard now, so it was difficult to see outside, but through the intermittent swipes of my wiper blades I could make out a space of flat land surrounding the house, separating it from the brick fence. Splotches of grass were beginning to bud up from the moist earth, and the hedges, with their implanted roots, seemed merely to be a more advanced and curated form of the grass itself. I glanced once more over at the porch which was lit with two welcoming lanterns, then turned my attention back inside the car.\n\nI spent a minute fiddling with my jacket, making sure it was properly fitted. Then I checked my phone for messages before sliding it into my pocket and grabbing the Lazy Dog bag. I held it in my lap while looking into the rearview mirror. I could see my face: barely lit by the car’s embedded light sources. My brown hair was cut short, military style, and even in the dark I could see the gray streaking through like a spray of off-white paint. My eyes were hard and tired, but stretched wide with adrenaline provided by the cigarette. Or at least that’s what I told myself was causing it. I sniffed, then coughed. Probably there was still some flour in my nostrils. I grimaced, then I looked back out the passenger window. And the last thought I had before exiting the car was that none of the windows were lit. *The house was completely dark—except for the porch lights.*\n\nI jogged through the rain with the bag clutched against my chest. It only took fifteen seconds to clear the walkway and make it up the stairs, but in that time the rain had soaked my hair. I started to pat it out when a burst of thunder came on the heels of a lightning bolt, and for a moment the entire world was bright as in daylight hours. I saw the hedges and thought they looked menacing in that brief spark: as if they were creatures stalking under cover of darkness, suddenly exposed. Then I looked to the right and saw the porch continue around the house like one might see in the country. I wiped my face, then turned to ring the doorbell. But the door creaked open before I could click the button.\n\nThe lady was around 5’4”, maybe thirty years old, and had thin brown hair combed neatly behind her shoulders. From what I could make out in the dim exterior light, her skin looked pallor, and her face was sunken and tired. She gripped the door with the weak fingers of her right hand, holding it only slightly ajar.\n\n“Good Evening,” I said with a nod. “I have an order for Kelsie P.” I twisted the bag in my hand to expose the tag with Kelsie’s name on it.\n\nShe stared blankly at it for several seconds, and I got the impression that this woman had other things on her mind. When she finally registered my question, a look of surprise swept over her features, and she effused an “Oh, hello,” as if she had just seen me. “I’m—” she stumbled, “Kelsie P, that’s me.” She smiled weakly and looked behind me. “Sorry about the rain. It must be a hard night to be out.”\n\nI nodded again and said, “Well, generous tips like yours make it all worth it. Plus, it’s not like you control the weather.”\n\nHer smile stretched, seeming more genuine. “I’m glad,” she replied. “And, you’re right. But, you know…” she trailed off, and for a few seconds there was only the sound of rain pattering against the wooden overhang. Then Kelsie said, “well, thank you,” and reached for the bag.\n\nI held it back, a reaction which prompted her to jerk her hand back inside the dark crevice of her doorway. I retrieved my phone from my pocket and held it up so she could see the Dasher app. “Sorry, ma’am. Protocol for alcohol deliveries. I have to scan your ID.”\n\n“Oh,” she responded nervously. She looked over her shoulder, as if someone was trying to speak to her from inside. Then she turned back to me and said, “I left my purse in the dining room. Do you mind if I go and get it? Shouldn’t be a minute.”\n\n“Please,” I replied. “Take your time.”\n\nI listened to her footsteps trail off down the hallway; when I was sure she was gone, I pressed the door open another few inches and peered inside. As expected, all of the lights were turned off. Only a few candles were lit in the living room. I made note of the spiraling staircase directly up ahead, and the hallway beside it which presumably led to the kitchen and dining room. I listened for another minute, and just as I was beginning to worry, I heard Kelsie’s footfalls returning from the back of the house. I backed up a couple feet and waited.\n\nWhen Kelsie returned, I could tell immediately she was different. Her breathing was deep and disturbed. Her voice sounded unsure as she said, “Sorry . . . about the wait. My purse, I couldn’t—”\n\n“It’s no problem,” I interjected. “It looks like your power went out.”\n\nHer hand, which was rummaging through her purse with frantic speed, froze, and I could see her fingers trembling. She looked back into her house, as if just realizing where she was. Then she turned back and said, “Oh, yes. It went out with the storm.” She confirmed then continued to rummage.\n\n“Are you sure?” I replied and reached forward, placing my hand atop her purse to stop her motion. Then, while keeping the Lazy Dog bag hooked around my wrist, I raised my index finger and placed it over my lips. I met her wide, terrified eyes, and at this distance, I could see they were hazel. When I was sure she was not going to scream, I lowered my finger, and while keeping my other hand over her purse, I whispered very quietly: “I know everything. I’m here to help. Will you let me do that?”\n\nShe was staring into my eyes, but I could tell something in the house was agitating her. Her head kept rotating over her shoulder, as if pulled by a magnet, and it took a concerted effort for her to stop from turning around.\n\n“It’s okay,” I said, filling the silence. “You don’t have to speak. I’ve done this before. There’s one inside, isn’t there? Nod once if there is.”\n\nShe gulped, but something in her face told me she was beginning to believe me—trust me, maybe. She nodded once.\n\n“Okay, I’m going to tell you what to do. Don’t worry about the theatrics of it, these things aren’t very socially acute. It’ll all be over very quickly if you do what I say. Do you understand? Nod once if you do.”\n\nShe nodded.\n\n“Good. Now, when I release your purse, I want you to count to three in your head, then toss the purse behind you, maybe a good four or five feet. Understand?”\n\nShe thought it over, then nodded, and I noticed her fingers had stopped trembling.\n\n“You’re going to pretend like you dropped it, which means you’ll turn around and start cleaning it up. It’s very important that you face the interior of the house in such a way that you can see everything inside. Okay?”\n\nAnother nod.\n\n“I’m going to come in and crouch down in front of you, pretending to help. Now this next part is very important. When you see it, I want you to show me where it is with your eyes. This means that you’ll look at it, then look at me, then look back again. Once *I* know where it is, I can take care of it. Do you understand?”\n\nKelsie nodded, and I could see an intense weight had been lifted off her shoulders.\n\n“Okay, then,” I started, speaking deliberately. “On your mark.” I removed my hand from her purse and nodded.\n\nThere were three seconds of quiet anticipation. Thunder croaked in the Heavens. Rain tapped its millions of nimble fingers against the gutter. Another flash of lightning harpooned across the night sky. And then Kelsie swung her arm behind her and released the purse. I heard a dull thud, then the sound of objects sliding across the tile floor. She looked once more into my eyes, and in hers I saw the words, “Please don’t let me down.” Then she turned around and did as I had instructed.\n\nWhen I stepped inside the foyer, I felt the hairs on my arms and neck raise. It felt like I was walking against a strong winter wind, only the frigid air was saturated with the scent of black licorice. I pushed forward and moved to face Kelsie. “Here, let me help,” I uttered, then crouched down and began to pick up the loose items. I drew a deep breath, steadying my focus. I returned a tube of lipstick to the purse, then looked up into Kelsie’s eyes. They were searching, and I saw that she was drawing shallow breaths through an open mouth. Probably that mouth was dry as the desert air.\n\nThis went on for maybe fifteen seconds, at which point Kelsie’s expression warped into one of abject terror. I had to whisper her name to get her attention. She gazed at me, remembering, then looked back over my right shoulder, then back at me. Based on the trajectory of her gaze—up and to the left—I concluded that the creature was probably held up in the upper-right corner of the living room. I gripped the Lazy Dog bag firmly in my left hand, and when I was ready, I offered Kelsie one final nod. Then I threw the bag over my right shoulder, and—spinning in the same direction—I pulled the gun from my left holster with my right hand and aimed it straight at the bag.\n\nI only saw it for a second; its features were nothing more than dark silhouettes in the flickering candlelight. Then the mass lept at me, torpedoing through the sky with inhuman velocity. I pulled the trigger right before the bag and creature crossed paths. There was a brilliant flash of red light as the incendiary bullet ignited the solution and exploded into a billion embers which engulfed the creature completely. It dropped to the ground with a crashing force suggestive of metal, splintering and breaking the floorboards beneath the creature’s tremendous weight.\n\nI didn’t waste any time closing the distance between myself and the thing that had fallen out of the air. In the light of a dozen living room fires, I could see it clearly now, and I kept my gun trained on its abdomen while checking the damage. \n\nScarlet cracks manifested all over the creature’s clear, chitin exoskeleton but were focused around the navel cavity where the makeshift bomb had exploded. Unlike a human’s stomach, the creature’s was concave and round like a Spiral Wishing Well. Tight cords of muscle twisted around its core, allowing it unbelievable abdominal strength and rotary ability. Above, its chest was broad and smooth, with only a single pectoral muscle connecting the two arm-like appendages, perhaps four-times the size of an average bodybuilder’s arms, stretching down to its ankles. Its ovular head was connected to its body by a long, snake-like neck which could stretch five, maybe six feet, then contract like an accordion. Attached to its onyx head were five spider-like eyes, and below, a star-patterned incision where its mouth flap would open up to reveal two rows of tiny serrated teeth, overshadowed by two vampire-like incisors. \n\n“Game over you fucking parasite,” I spat while holstering my gun. When it was put away, I spent a moment observing its exoskeleton armor. While the blast had shattered the entire front portion, I could see the resilient material already beginning to reform. “You’re a persistent bastard, I’ll give you that,” I said and reached behind my head to retrieve the sword which was hidden there beneath the trench coat.\n\nThat’s when I heard the front door shut behind me.\n\nNow, as I alluded to previously, this wasn’t my first rodeo. After three dozen successful hunts, Julie and I have been able to create a set of parameters—rules, if you will—for both the creatures and my own methods of engagement. Chief among our discoveries is that there is only ever one “vampod” per household. This rule was *never* broken: so when I heard the creak of the door, then the latch, and then the sound of transformation—a sound which can be mimicked by rubbing two pieces of wet rubber together—I was utterly shocked.\n\nMy hand, which had found the sword’s handle, remained in a perpetual reaching-behind-my-head pose as I listened further. Beneath the sound of the attenuating rain, I heard what sounded almost like fast-falling hail. And then I realized what it was. It was the vampod’s death call: a subtle chattering of teeth, indicating its frenzied hunger. I felt a child-like wave of dread pass over me, but I forced myself to turn my head. Sure enough, where Kelsie had previously been standing, there was another vampod. Its beady, black eyes were glaring at me; its mouth was quivering with anticipation. \n\n*Shit.*\n\nWhile keeping my right hand on the hilt, I slowly moved my left hand along my waist, reaching for my gun. Just as my fingers touched the rubber grip, the vampod lurched at me. I ducked and rolled further inside the living room, barely escaping the monster’s wide swipe. Then I sprang up, pointed my pistol, and shot an entire clip of incendiary bullets into center mass. The vampod flinched with each bullet, but when the barrage ceased, it once again started stalking toward me.\n\n“Shit,” I said and took off sprinting toward the kitchen. I reloaded the gun and holstered it, then reached inside under my left armpit and pulled a grenade from my belt. Taking one of these things on was hard enough—two would be impossible. I circled back through the hallway with the second vampod close on my tail and chucked the grenade at the wounded one. Then I cut past the spiral staircase and into a small family room on the other side of the house. \n\nThe explosion shook the walls. I knew the grenade alone wouldn’t be enough to kill it, but it should buy me another three minutes while I figured out how to either escape or kill the second one. I ran through the dining room, sliding over the large wooden table, and escaped into the kitchen just as the pursuing vampod slashed the entry-way to pieces. I saw an open door with a flight of stairs leading down to the basement. I considered going through—perhaps there was an egress window I could use to escape. But I knew if there wasn’t one, I’d be toast. \n\nThen I had an idea.\n\nI ducked behind the island, which took the brunt of the vampod’s next swing, then I stood up dual-wielding my pistols. I shot both clips—28 rounds—while backing up toward the stove. I lagged my left gun long enough to allow my right hand to spin the dials on each of the eight gas burners. Then I pulled the master cable connecting all of the grenade pins and released the belt, allowing it to fall on the ground in front of the stove.\n\nI sprinted toward the family room, knowing I only had six seconds to get as far away from the blast zone as possible. However, with the big gash in the door-way, the vampod was able to recover and leap at me—its force carrying through the wall and into my side. I coughed, feeling one of my ribs break, and fell onto the ground beside the dining room table.\n\nThe monster, which had overshot its mark and punctured the wall next to me, pulled itself out and towered over me in the doorway. Time seemed to slow down then. My attention was fixated on the creature’s large incisors which jutted out from its mouth. Its neck elongated, stretching toward me in expectant pleasure, and it released a moan which was a cross between whales singing and a low, distant fog horn. The sound filled the room, along with the scent of black licorice, and just as the creature was going to take me, the pack of grenades exploded, and the entire kitchen went up in flames.\n\nI covered my face, bracing for the heatwave. When it came, it felt like a giant was sweeping me with a molten broom. My fingers sizzled, and later I was sure that if the vampod had not been standing directly in front of me, I would have died right then. The room's temperature gauge jacked up like an uncontrolled steam room, and all around I heard crackling and popping sounds. \n\nI opened my eyes.\n\nThe vampod was lying face-first on the floor several feet away from me. The explosion had not only shattered his exoskeleton, but had warped some of the musculature underneath. Black ichor dripped from its skin, and it writhed, releasing a low, painful moan before going limp.\n\nI felt my own body go limp, drained of its adrenaline-fueled hypervigilance. My side swelled up around the broken rib, and attempting to turn rightside up felt like cutting myself in half with a scalpel. I laid for an unknown duration of time, falling in and out of consciousness as the flames closed in around me. \n\nThe feeling of my flesh melting woke me up. I jutted forward and saw my feet on fire. I screamed, and in my panicked movement, I managed to kick one of the table legs. A simultaneous surge of pain in my shin and torso nearly knocked me out again, but I swallowed it and forced myself to my knees, gritting my teeth as my singed fingers flared with pain. I grunted, wiping the sweat and soot from my forehead, and used my elbows to prop myself up. Then I anchored myself against the side of the table and rose to my bloody feet. Tears rolled down my feverish face, and I realized it was quite possible the entire house was a giant bonfire by now. I had to get out.\n\nI limped through the dining room, only looking back once to confirm the vampod was still lying on the ground behind me. All I could see was a puddle of black liquid. *Good enough,* I thought and pressed on. When I came to the front door, I realized three things. First, it had stopped raining outside. Sometime during my unconsciousness, the storm had passed. Second, the other vampod was also liquidated. And third, a baby was crying upstairs.\n\nI’m ashamed to say that I almost left anyway. I undid the latch on the front door and cracked it wide open, feeling relief in the form of a cool, humid breeze. But before I could take a step outside, I heard the baby scream again. I pressed my wrist into my forehead and closed my eyes. *No one would blame you for leaving,* I thought. I took a deep breath of fresh air and released. Then I looked back toward the source of the cries. *But I’d blame me.* I left the door open and started back inside the house.\n\nIt felt like I had a gut full of buck-shot as I ascended the spiral, bracing against the banister in a lovers’ cleave. The fire had spread along the wall and ceiling, but peering into the second floor rooms, I saw they were mostly unafflicted. This fueled my hope that I would have enough time to save the infant, whose cries for help became more and more urgent. I stumbled over the last step and fell forward, nearly lunging into the flaming wall. Luckily I managed to bend—bearing the pain of my rib—and land on my knees. I howled, and for a moment the murky world turned completely black. But it was only a moment, and I picked myself back up, wading through the smoke until I found the nursery.\n\nThe fire hadn’t torn inside the room yet, but the air was filled with smoke. We both had to get out of here, and fast. I stumbled toward the sound of the baby’s cries, cursing aloud with each painful step, my raw feet feeling like I had walked a thousand miles over jagged rocks, barefoot. When I finally reached the crib and set in to grab her, the baby thrashed violently against my advances. “I’m here to help,” I said as the infant kicked at my hands. “Come on, now, don’t be like that.” I grabbed for her, but she squirmed out of my grip. The child truly had incredible strength. “Fine,” I yelled and turned indignantly. *I don’t have time for this!* I screamed inside my head. \n\nThat’s when I heard heavy footfalls coming from downstairs. Someone, *or something*, was walking through the main hallway.\n\n“Shit, there’s more?” I said, incredulous. “Fuck,” I spun around and grabbed the child, overpowering her strong legs and pressed her to my chest. “Shhhhh,” I hushed, “I just need to—” I heard the sound of footsteps sprinting up the spiral stairs. “Damn!” I ran with the baby to the closet and stepped inside, closing the louver door behind us. The spaced slats allowed me to see into the room, but it also allowed smoke inside the closet. We’d probably only have a couple minutes before smoke inhalation would rob what little oxygen we had left. I held the baby closer to my neck and waited.\n\nA moment later, a human figure entered the nursery. They stopped at the doorway, and I heard myself whisper “Go away—please, just go away,” under my breath. The figure took a step inside. Then another step, and another. They stopped in the center, as if considering what to do, then she approached the closet. I was so wired-in, I hardly realized the baby had stopped crying. The entire world seemed completely void of noise. \n\nThen I saw her.\n\nThe skin on her face was creamy and doll-like, as if she had used plaster as compound. Her blond hair was tied back in a ponytail, and her facial expression was completely blank. She took another step toward the closet, and I noticed her movements were . . . clunky. The swing of her arms seemed to lag her step, and when they did move, the movement was too fluid, as if my ex-wife was synchronizing her motion to the steady rhythm of a song. \n\nI didn’t feel shocked when I realized it was Karen. Something in her reddish-brown eyes pulled my concentration, and I suddenly felt like I had been expecting her—that we were meant to rendezvous here. My muscles weakened, and it took all of my effort to keep from dropping the baby. Karen took another step, and I felt my heart beating in my ears. Another step, and I opened my mouth, inhaling deep breaths of smoke. I was becoming lightheaded—disoriented. My skin was crawling, and my reflexes were urging me to run, to escape whatever this disgusting thing pretending to be Karen was. But she had me. I was only a spectator now, and she wanted to show me something—\n\nSuddenly I was back at home-base: an old, two-story energy building Jules and I rented out as a private space to conduct vampod research and store our results. It was dark out, but moonlight poured through the windows. Looking around, I saw the place had been ransacked. Desks and chairs and shards of glass were strewn everywhere, and on the air was the familiar scent of black licorice. “Jules?” I called, walking toward the back offices. I saw several vested men lying on the ground—security guards on our payroll. Their corpses had been ripped apart, and what remained of their bodies were pale and shrunken. I began to shake. “Jules?” I called again, quieter.\n\nI made it to her office. The door was wide open, and I could already see her figure lying on the ground, her blood staining the blue carpet, black. “Jules!” I cried out, dropping on top of her body and feeling for vitals. No pulse. No signs of breathing. “Jules, hold on,” I said and flipped her over, prepared to perform CPR. I fastened my hands together but stopped when I saw her chest—it was caved in. Something had reached through her sternum and literally ripped her heart out. Then I saw her face. Her eyes and mouth were both wide open in a fixed expression of horror.\n\nTears streamed out of my eyes, but I didn’t make a sound. I was completely stunned. I brought Julie’s body to my chest and hugged her for what felt like hours. Then I heard something. A faint clicking sound. It was coming from behind me, in the corner of the room. I didn’t turn. I didn’t move. I just closed my eyes as the sound of chattering teeth stalked closer.\n\nThen I was back in the closet. Karen’s face was pressed against the door. She was smiling with manic ecstasy, as if she was siphoning my terror through the grated door and ingesting it like a drug. She stuck her tongue out in a licking motion; it was long and sharp, like a lizard’s tongue. And just when I thought she was going to enter and kill us, I heard someone else yell from downstairs. The Karen imposter turned with a scowl. “Carl?” I heard the voice yell, and I immediately thought of Julie.\n\nKaren turned back to me, flashing one more creepy smile before backing up to the nursery window. Then she lunged through the glass, shattering it on her way out of the house.\n\nJulie must have heard the glass shatter, because she started up the stairs. “Carl?” she called again. I stumbled through the door, keeping the silent baby close to my chest. “H—here,” I mumbled.\n\n“Oh my God,” Julie remarked as she entered the room. I fell over into her arms. “It—it was—Kare—Kar” I tried to elaborate, but my voice was weak, and my brain might as well have been a second heart, pumping singular thoughts about escape.\n\n“No time to talk now,” Julie said and guided me toward the stairs. “Cops are on the way. We have to get out of here, pronto.”\n\nI mumbled a barely audible agreement, then let Julie guide me through the upstairs hallway and down the stairs. By the time we exited the house, Julie was partially carrying me on her back. She had taken the baby from me and was holding her with one arm, while the other arm was pointed at my Honda Taurus. “Sorry, Carl,” she said while loading the baby and I into the back seat of her black Escalade. “Can’t have this trace back to us.”\n\nI fell onto the leather seats and groaned, suddenly remembering what it felt like to be an eight year old again—to fall off my bike and skid my knee across the blacktop. Only I didn’t just skid my knee, but my entire body, and whenever it made contact with anything, it was as if the skin was being flayed with a hot knife. I tried to hold on, to resist the blackness that was taking over, but Julie’s voice faded into the background like a head into an infinitely deep pillow, sinking and sinking until the pain in my feet and the smoke and smut in my nostrils and the ringing in my ears all suffocated under the weight of a single point of pressure which bore down like an iron thumb on my forehead.\n\nThe last thing I remember before losing consciousness was the bumpiness of the road as we turned onto the gravel path, and the distant sound of an explosion.\n\nThen I was out.",

        "text": "Okay, so I’m going to try this here. \n\nI’ve tried posting this on other boards but it gets taken down immediately. Apparently no one wants to believe my accounts, and that’s okay. I’ve accepted that at this point the only way to convey my experience to the general public is within the comfortable frame of fiction. And it’s for this reason that I had my fiction-writing brother, Jimmy, proofread this log before posting.\n\nSo here goes…\n\nMy name is Carl Rogers (yes, like the psychologist.) I live in a small town in Northern Illinois which I won’t name here for reasons that will become apparent later. I have been a Doordash driver for a little over four years, meaning I know the ins and outs of the business—if you want to call it a business. \n\nThe truth is, Dashing is a lot like corporate news writing, another industry which, unfortunately, I have experience in. Both professions require lots of self-management, quick turnover, and a loose skirting of the law in order to get ahead. Of course, if you get caught breaking the law, you’re on your own.\n\nIn all my years of Dashing, only twice have I had run-ins with the police. The first was a speeding ticket. The second, well . . . \n\nI’m getting off track.\n\nI want to focus on my latest Dash, because I think everything will become a little clearer after you hear this “story.” I use quotes to remind you that this is my *real life experience*. Even so, I will refer to it as a story—no quotes—if it makes it easier for you to swallow.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe time on the dashboard read 10:44 PM. I rolled into the parking lot of Lazy Dog, a contemporary American eatery with a proclivity for staying true to its namesake. I would normally skip over a restaurant which was routinely 15 to 20 minutes late on their orders, but that wasn’t an option. Kelsie P. was shelling out $38 for a chicken pot pie, a side of crispy deviled eggs, and a 6-pack of the joint’s house-brewed pale ale. For 9 miles, this was an extremely generous sum. Of course, the neighborhood I was delivering to was known for its generosity, which was no surprise considering its average household income was an order of magnitude greater than the U.S. average.\n\nBut I digress.\n\nI parked my 2007 Honda Tauraus in the pick-up-and-go spot and stepped out, hearing the subtle creak of its door hinges, then the loud slam of its quick latch. The car’s beige paint was beginning to rust along the bottom trim. I surveyed this with contempt as I fingered through a ring of keys with the ease and focus of a man selecting a carton of eggs at the supermarket. \n\nAfter I locked up and started toward the entrance, I considered my vehicle. Bessie—I had named the car after an old horse of mine—was old, but reliable. I had treated her right. Routine oil and filter, fuel injections, coolant, difs, exhaust—the works. It’s my belief that of the very few things we hold stewardship over in this life, we should aim to preserve those things and improve on their qualities. In other words, leave it better than you found it. Or at least don’t screw it up. Life’s enough of a shit heap without us adding our own personal shovelful.\n\nIt was in such a state of philosophizing that I walked through Lazy Dog’s absurdly large entrance door by pulling a huge dog-bone handle, feeling a release of pressure consistent with the opening of a space-shuttle’s vacuum-sealed hatch. I scowled without realizing, then continued through an empty anteroom and into the dining room where three college-aged girls were giggling behind the host counter. I approached, expecting one of them to turn and address me, but after thirty seconds, it became apparent they lacked any peripheral vision.\n\n“Uh-hm,” I mumbled, clearing my throat. But still no response.\n\nNow, I consider myself to be a generally calm and reasonable man. At the ripe age of 53, I have seen my share of troubles. I served two military tours: the first in the Persian Gulf, the second in Afghanistan. And on top of all the death and despair I witnessed there, I was also around to watch both of my parents pass, and neither in a good way. My dad ran the family farm down South, and one day he got on the wrong side of a harvester. Tore him up pretty good. He lasted a whole 48 hours before succumbing to internal bleeding. That’s when my mom’s insides also started to bleed. She was depressed, I knew that, and she blamed me for leaving. That’s why it wasn’t a shock when I found her hung up in the barn a few months later. \n\nMy three brothers and two sisters attended the funeral. It was the first time in a decade we were all in the same place. By the time of mom’s suicide, everyone except Jimmy and I had already flown the coop, found spouses, and acquired well paying jobs. As a result, the conversation over inheritance was short. As the oldest, I was willed the farm’s title, and outside of the land, there wasn’t much of value to dicker over. Tom mentioned selling the farm and sharing the payday, but at the time I wasn’t ready to do that. So I gave what little mom had saved in the bank to Jimmy and went on my way.\n\nA couple years later, I met Karen. I was working at a reputable news company based out of New York at the time. We met at a Starbucks early one morning after I finished working out at a nearby gym. She complimented my shoes which I had purchased over the internet a couple weeks back. Apparently they were some top notch running shoes. I didn't really know the difference, but she was really into running 5k’s and the like. We went on a couple dates, and 6 months later, we were engaged.\n\nAbout a year into our marriage, she began to bring up the farm. I should have noticed the red flags, but I was naïve and in love. The two should be counted as synonyms.\n\nI had taken her to Illinois to see the house I grew up in shortly after we were wed. At the time, she didn’t have much to say. I mentioned how I was loaning out the acreage to some local farmers to cover its cost-basis until I decided what to do with it. She said that was a good idea. But she must have gotten a whiff of how much those acres were worth, because she started nudging me to sell, always couching it in terms of what we could do with *“all that money.”* \n\nI was never the type to lust after possessions. To me, things come with an invisible weight attached. Like I said earlier, I take care of what’s mine. So whenever I did make an important purchase, it took a while for the added stress of owning another thing to roll off my shoulder. I guess I just figured Karen was the same way. I guess we all think everyone else is like us, until we’re proven wrong. And boy was I.\n\nI got a decent bid from an out-of-stater and decided to pull the trigger. I won’t share the figure here, but let’s just say it was a comfortable retirement. The first thing I did after accessing the money was immediately deposit 20% of the net principle into a checking account in Jimmy’s name. He was still struggling to find his way, trying to become some kind of fiction writer, so I thought the money might help keep him afloat while he worked all that out.\n\nAs it turned out, that was the best decision I ever made, because a week later Karen divorced me and took half of my net worth in alimony (more than half when accounting for court fees and taxes.)\n\nWe never had any kids together, and I’m grateful for that. Not just because Karen turned out to be a gold digging bitch, but because kids were never really my forte. Just didn’t make sense to me, even when I was one myself. So standing here, now, in front of these teenage girls, I’m reminded again of the kids I never had, and the woman who took most of what I did have. And it pissed me off.\n\n“Hey,” I snapped, raising my hand and offering a slow, “earth to human” wave. “What is this? Am I at a restaurant or the local rub-and-tug? I don’t have all day…”\n\nOne of the girls—the middle one—turned, her arms crossed, and with a face full of disgust, spat out, “What?”\n\n“I said—”\n\n“I know what you said,” she cut me off, lifting her hand in a halting motion. “Have you ever heard of sexual harassment, old man?” She waited a moment to see how I would respond. When it became apparent I wasn’t going to, she relented, and with a groan, she asked, “What do you want?”\n\n*The past thirty years back,* I thought, but only said, “Kelsie P’s Doordash order. Think you can manage that?”\n\nThe host, Maybell, (who’s naming these kids nowadays?) rolled her eyes, then shot a tortured glance at her friends who regarded her with sympathy. “Be right back,” she said and strutted off toward the kitchen. The other two eyed me, afraid I might strike up a friendly conversation with them next, but I had no such plans. I backed up near the door and leaned against the wall.\n\nMy attention was split then between surveying the surroundings and thinking about my past. Often this was the case. I inhabited some space between yesterday and today—with the present often acting as a stage for old actors. For example, the rustic dining room, outfitted with its Western-styled tapestries and moose heads and a taxidermied bear standing on a platform, brought to mind good times on the ranch. The stretch of years when the whole family ate supper together. When the harvests were good and mom and dad would kiss before heading into town. These memories brought me as close to smiling as I could manage.\n\nBut then I looked over and saw the few bachelors lingering by the bar, and I was reminded all over again of the things I had tried to bury at the bottom of countless bottles. Things which, for better or worse, had come to define my perspective on life. The war. Dad’s death, then mom’s. Karen. My own insufficiencies. It all came bubbling up like an uncorked bottle of champagne, filling my empty cup with poison.\n\nAnd I recognize it, too. I understand how some of my thoughts and actions may come off as cynical and uncouth. I agree it’s not pretty. A part of me changed after the war. Like some wires crossed in my brain and I no longer felt things the right way. Then when my parents died, I wasn’t able to mourn them properly. Karen was really the final nail in the coffin. I stopped caring so much about the way people felt. I became cold and mechanical. I could feel my own bout of depression coming on, and it reached an apotheosis right around the time I started Dashing. Then something happened. I didn’t change. As much as I’d like to change, I’m convinced that ship has sailed for good. But I was able to carve out a new purpose in my life. And it’s that purpose that helped me shrug off the decades of rot which was festering like an invisible, gangrenous tail slithering behind me wherever I went.\n\nI was pulled from my machinations by Maybell returning with a brown bag. It contained the Lazy Dog logo and was stapled shut to prevent hungry Dashers from sneaking a few fries. She held it out as if she was offering me a dead squirrel.\n\n“Are you sure you’re old enough to be serving alcohol?” I asked whimsically.\n\nShe groaned. “Just take it. Please.”\n\nI smiled and tipped her a nod before extracting the bag of goodies from her hand. “You have a good night now,” I patronized.\n\nShe turned around without saying another word.\n\nIt was misting when I got back to the Taurus. *Great, that’ll help the rust situation*, I thought. I hopped in, tossed the doggie bag in the passenger seat, and turned the ignition key. Bessie came roaring to life, her sound augmented by the performance exhaust I had installed at the turn of the year. It was April now, still Winter for all intents and purposes, but it hadn’t snowed in over a week which meant the roads were easy-driving. I flipped the radio on and listened to the barely audible talk-radio host mumble about the petro dollar and exchange rates as I pulled out of the sparsely populated lot. After a few minutes on the highway, the storefront lights faded into a dreary blur in my rearview mirror.\n\nI turned off at an exit and entered into the village backroads. The wide highway condensed into two pencil-thin lanes, boxed in by endless stretches of tall trees which hung over the road in severe ellipses like rows of giants bending down to examine a strange bug. A chill worked up my spine, which I thought was strange because I was pretty sure electrical impulses were supposed to originate in the brain. Or maybe it was the heart. Either way, I was certain it wasn’t the middle of the lower back. I flashed my brights, searching for deer, but there was nothing. Just me, Bess, the trees, and a little bit of rain.\n\nMy phone, a Galaxy-something-or-other, lit up and started buzzing. The screen read: *Julie*. I canned the radio and answered.\n\n*Me: Hey, Jules. On the road now. ETA 5 minutes.*\n\n*Julie: You hear about Kevin?*\n\nI was quiet for a moment, processing her sudden question. Then I remembered.\n\n*Me: (Somber) Yeah, I heard.*\n\nSilence.\n\n*Me: Jules? You there?*\n\n*Julie: Just be careful, alright? Get home safe. I worry about you sometimes.*\n\n*Me: Nothing to worry about, darlin’. I’ll give you a call when I get back.*\n\n*Julie: Alright.*\n\nI hung up.\n\nJulie, or Jules as I call her, is a kind of co-worker of mine. And a very anxious one at that. We had met under precarious circumstances a few years ago and decided to team up ever since. And, no, before you ask, we aren’t romantically involved. I made it clear from the start that our relationship is 100% business. She agreed. I just call her things like “darling” to mess with her. Lighten the mood a bit. And believe me, we can use all the mood-lightening we can get.\n\nI checked the Dasher app and saw the house was less than a mile away. I slowed down to around 15 mph and reached into the back seat, returning with a 10 lb bag of Gold Metal all-purpose flour. I parked along the road bank and flicked my hazards on. Then I took up the Lazy Dog bag and grimaced. *Staples. It had to be staples.* I reached into the glove compartment and took out a staple remover, a stapler, a small enclosed vial, and a pocket knife. After opening the Lazy Dog bag, I removed its contents, setting the food on the passenger-side floor mat, then I slashed a hole in the top of the flour bag and poured the white powder in. When the flour was fully added, I planted the vial in the center, then stapled the bag shut and put everything away.\n\nI stepped out of the car and dusted off my trench coat, coughing a few times into my elbow. I had done this procedure over three dozen times now, but I was never able to pour the flour without making a mess. When I was sufficiently cleaned off, I reached under Bess’s console and tapped a square out from the box of Camels I had stashed there. I lit the cigarette and smoked for a few minutes, feeling the occasional drop of rain patter down from the canopy of freshly-budded tree leaves above me.\n\nI never really cared for forests. To me, treelines were like nature’s curtains, hiding its bare beauty on the other side. That beauty was an open field, a valley, a mountain. Any kind of concrete structure not bastardized by nature’s spurious outgrowths. If I had a choice, I would move out and work in Utah or Colorado or Arizona. But I didn’t have a choice. This was my home, and I had to defend it.\n\n*( P.S. Because this post was more than 40k characters, I had to split it into 2 parts. See here: X )*",

        "text": "I've lived in the same house for years. It's in a middle class neighborhood which I had always considered to be a safe place for my wife, son, and I to live. Last year we were having some issues with our packages being stolen so I installed a security camera outside which comes with an app that notifies me when movement is sensed outside. I work as a fireman which means I have to stay overnight a lot. Today I got a notification from the app that movement was sensed outside our door. Normally I wouldn’t check what was up because it goes off fairly frequently due to us living on a major road. However it was 2 am and something was telling me to check the app. I clicked on the app and saw that the mailman was dropping something off. I thought this was strange as the mailmen in my neighborhood come between 9-10 am almost everyday and I couldn’t see a reason for the mailman to be working at 2 am. I called my wife knowing there was a good chance she was awake as she tends to stay up late getting work done. I called her and asked if she had ordered something,\n\n“No, why?” she replied.\n\n“The mailman just dropped something off, don't go outside or open it until I get home.” I answered anxiously.\n\nI got off work at 2 the next day and went home to my wife and son. I walked outside and noticed that there was no package. I went onto my security camera app to make sure that I did not miss someone stealing the package. We had left the package out overnight. It would have been a perfect opportunity to steal our package. However when I went onto the app I noticed there was a recording that I must have gone off while I was sleeping. I clicked on the recording with haste and what I saw haunts me. The mailman was back but this time with a knife. He picked up the package and stared at the camera. The mailman's face was blank with the exception of two jet black, soulless eyes. I immediately called my wife's parents and my wife and son went to stay at their house until I figured out what was going on. I did not have work for the next couple of days so this was the perfect opportunity for me to investigate the situation. I assumed this must be some sick teenager with a mask pulling a prank and I was determined to catch them. It was 2 am the same night and I got a notification on my phone. I got out of bed and started making my way to the door. I stopped in my tracks when I saw what was on the camera there. The thing was standing with a package looking dead at the camera but this time with my wife's face. As I looked at the live footage in horror I realized that it wasn't my wife, it just had her face there was no hair and the body was clearly a man's body. I ran back to my room and grabbed my gun out of the safe. I stood at alert and called my wife.\n\n“Are you at your parents house?”\n\n“Yes, why what is going on?” she asked in a frantic voice it was obvious that I had just woken her up.\n\n“I'm coming over now to keep the doors locked and stay safe.” I hung up the phone and started to walk outside. I saw the package. I picked it up and ran to the car. I positioned my mirrors and turned to pull out of the driveway. Sitting in my passenger seat was my wife with a knife in her hand.\n\n“May I have that package back?”",

        "text": "  \n\nWhen I was seventeen my mother vanished without a trace, during the summer of 1996 in Cedar Hill, Missouri.\n\nI've never told anyone what I experienced three weeks after her disappearance. The news stories showed bits and pieces, but I've never so much as uttered what I'm about to tell you to reporters, the police, or any of the countless doctors I've seen over the years.\n\nI'm not exactly what you'd call a \"model citizen,\" and my lucidity has been brought into question more than once throughout my life. I don't expect my recounting to \"set the world on fire\" as they say. Nobody believes an aging addict with a violent criminal record and various diagnoses. \n\nEven still, it's time. \n\nShe had me when she was nineteen, so when my mom disappeared, she was only thirty-six. It's an odd feeling -- outliving a young parent. As I'm sitting here now, I'm older than she was at the time of her disappearance by seven years. \n\nShe and my father never married and split up not long after I was born, but they remained close friends. She was a hairdresser in Saint Louis, and the town of Cedar Hill -- where my father lived -- was about forty minutes outside of the city limits. the distance wasn't anything crazy for joint-custody parents by any stretch of the imagination, but my mom; Lori as everyone called her, wanted to get away from the bustle and the crime of the city anyways, so we ultimately moved there, just a few miles away from my dad. \n\nIt didn't take long after we moved in for people to take to her. She was that way, my mom. Everyone seemed to just light up when they saw her, and she'd reciprocate with the most genuine warmth you could ever find in a person. It was infectious. \n\nI still wish to this day that I'd inherited, or at least learned to emulate that part of her -- one of the many things that I've come to miss so dearly. \n\nShe'd met a man named Jack and got engaged to him after only six months of dating him. Jack hated me from the start. I had poor grades and would fight in school and all of that. I'll admit that I was no prom king even then, but it was more than that with Jack. \n\nI could have been captain of the varsity football team with straight A’s, and he'd have still hated me. It turned out Jack had a penchant for jealousy and was known for it by people he'd grown up with within the town over the years. It seems even he was even capable of being jealous of a mother’s love for her own son.\n\nI'd hear some of the other women gossip about it at my mom's salon when she'd step outside to smoke, and they didn't know I was in the back. That and his... odd religious beliefs.\n\nPeople didn't seem to know what a nice, pretty woman like her was doing with someone that held such a tepid reputation from the community, but my mom seemed to always go for the oddballs. \n\nShe always was a spiritual, but religiously promiscuous person; her parents and sister died in a car crash when I was just a baby, and she took it hard. As far back as I could remember she would sometimes cry about it when she'd have one-too-many glasses of wine, or when she thought she was alone. She'd always go to random different churches of various denominations, but I really think she was just desperate to find something that made her feel some sort of comfort about her loss. \n\nAbout three days before her disappearance, I'd heard her and Jack fighting in the living room. My room in that house was in the basement so was muffled, but it was something about some kind of church meeting. I think it was something about them breaking some rule or something, but I couldn't be sure.\n\nI've tried and tried to dig into my memory and make the words clearer as to what was said, to the point of mental anguish, but they never do. They fought a lot during that time, so I just tended to tune the arguments out. Ultimately, the police never connected it to anything of importance in the case. \n\nShe seemed troubled the next two days after that. She and Jack seemed to be getting along just fine on the surface, but I couldn't help but notice her agitation -- even as 'in my own head' as I was at that age. I could tell she hadn't been sleeping and was chain-smoking her Marlboro Menthols -- something she normally only did as an \"after work\" ritual in our garage. \n\nShe kept looking out of the windows like someone could have been coming to visit at any moment, but they never did. \n\nThe morning she disappeared, she said something to me at breakfast before she went to work at her Salon --- the last place anyone in the public would ever see her alive again. She looked terrible and I could tell she still hadn't slept the night before, yet again. Jack had to deliver a load to Kansas City with his rig that day, so he had left early in the morning.\n\nAs she was washing our plates in the sink, she asked me, \"Are you happy here, Kyle?\" I didn't know what to say to her at the time, so I said nothing. I hated that town and I hated Jack, and she knew that. I told her to leave him countless times.\n\nShe said, \" Today your grandma told me she'd love for us to come stay with her and your grandpa back in Chesterfield.\" Her voice was breaking up and I could see her shudder a little at the sink. She was crying. \n\nI reminded her that I never met Grandma and Grandpa and that they'd been dead since before I was born. I asked her if she was okay, and she said she was and that she was just tired. \n\nAfterward, I stood up to go to a friend's house, the last thing she said to me as I was heading out the door was, \"After all these years I finally found a way through, Kyle. I have something to show you later. I love you, son.\" \n\nIt wasn't the first time she'd gotten wrapped up headfirst into some obscure religion looking for answers, so I just told her I loved her too and left. \n\nAnd that was what I told the police was the last time I saw her alive. \n\nI lied when I told them that.\n\nWithin a 15-minute window, in between clients at her salon, between 11:15- 11:30 AM, she was just gone. No trace whatsoever. Her lunch was still sitting in the microwave when the police arrived to search for any sign of fleeing or kidnapping, anything at all that would give them an indication of where she might have gone. They never found any evidence of distress or any sort of planned runaway, other than what I'd told her she'd said that morning. \n\nMy first thought, one that was shared with her close friends, was that Jack was behind it, but his alibi was rock solid. He also apparently seemed genuinely distraught and concerned for her well-being when the police questioned him, and he was ultimately dismissed as a person of interest. \n\nThe bastard changed the locks to our house on me the very next day. He wouldn't even let me into it to get the rest of my stuff, so I went to stay with my father on his farm just a few miles away. \n\nAs days, then weeks went by, we began to lose hope. A serial killer and rapist that went by the name of Walter Kyper was discovered to have been passing through the area right around that time, and the news and police seemed to be heavily leaning towards him as the cause. \n\nI couldn't shake those last words she'd said to me though... \n\n\" Today your grandma told me she'd love for us to come stay with her and your grandpa back in Chesterfield.\" Had she had some sort of mental break? and what about the part about \"finding a way through\" after all these years? It was just too odd; too unlike her. \n\nExactly three weeks after she'd vanished from the little salon she'd loved so much,  I was sitting in my room at my father's farmhouse and heard a faint bristling in the yard from outside my window. I didn't think much of it as my dad's dog, Thunder, slept in a doghouse near the window. He always barked at strangers, so I figured it was just him.\n\nBut it wasn't long after, that the bristling turned to creaking and clambering on the side of the house, up past the gutters, and sounded like it was on the roof. \n\nIt sounded heavy, much too heavy to be a raccoon or an opossum. It couldn't Thunder either, unless he decided to grow opposable thumbs. \"Could it be a bear or some kind? A black bear, maybe\" I asked myself. Black bears weren't common in that part of Missouri, but not unheard of. \n\nI was just about to get out of bed and let my dad know that we need to get our guns and go shoot whatever it was on the house when I heard something that chilled me down to the core of my soul... and froze me right where I lay. \n\nIt was the crying of a woman, followed by the creaking open of the window that led to the attic. I wish I could say that I was brave at that moment, but I wasn't. I just sat there in my bed, petrified; quiet as a mouse, unable to move so much as a muscle. The crying was muffled now that it was coming from the attic, but you could still barely hear it. \n\nMy father had taken my mom's disappearance particularly hard, and he was usually drunk and asleep not long after the sun went down, but I'd still hoped he'd heard something, and that maybe he had more courage than I was able to muster at the time, but never came. For what must have been several minutes I could hear the creaking of the boards in the attic above me... still, that sobbing she paced back and forth. \n\nThere was a shotgun in the hallway closet about thirty feet away, and if I was careful about crawling out of bed, I could get to it long before whoever she was could come down the attack stairs and open the door that was right outside of my room. \n\nI was slowly removing the covers from my body, and she must've slipped and fell through this open cavity that was in between the walls because I heard her tumble down and crash right from the outer part of my closet. The house was old and there were lots of little places to fall through from the attic. I'd lose toys and baseball gloves and all kinds of things down in that little space, never to be recovered. \n\nFrom the sound, even in my excited state, I knew that for someone to fall there that hard, they must've broken several bones and would probably die in there before too long. \n\nBut the sobbing resumed shortly after she came plummeting down into there. My closet door had been left ajar, and I could see the faint outline of a new hole in the plaster, where her foot must've kicked out during her sudden and unexpected descent. \n\nThe sobbing stopped, and then the head of my mother pushed its way through, the plaster in my closet. It was very dark, but I could still recognize the shape of her face. She looked badly emaciated, and her eyes didn't look right. They looked... almost lambent like a cat's or an animal's eyes in the darkness. She was just staring at me with her head jutting through the hole. She gave me a face that was filled with deep commiseration like she was sorry she'd let me feel so much worry and despair over those past three weeks.\n\nAs wrong and awful as it was, seeing my mom's face after I was almost certain that I'd never see her again... well, it's hard to fully describe how that feels, I wasn't thinking straight. \n\nI began crying and just mindlessly asked, \"Mom?\" I had no idea what to say or how to process anything that I was experiencing. \n\nShe just started sobbing again, in that same way she had been the day she'd vanished. \"I finally found a way through, baby,\" she said. Her eyes glinted like opals in the shadow. \n\nI asked her where she'd been and told her that everyone had been looking for her for weeks. She just told me to come closer and that she had to \"show me something.\"\n\n\"I said I had something to show you, remember?\" she said. And then she repeated herself a second time with an identical tone, almost like she was rewound. \n\nAnd then she repeated it again, and again.\n\nOn and on, until I couldn't take it anymore. I cried out to her to stop and told her she was scaring me. She stared at me with her mouth open, a silver ribbon of drool leaked out of it, and then she pulled her head out of the hole she'd made in the closet wall. I heard shimmying up to the attic from where she'd fallen, and then I could hear her crawl out of the window and jump off the roof, running into the woods.\n\nI sat there for a while, I'm not sure how long, just trying to process what I saw. I eventually gathered myself and grabbed the shotgun, shook my dad awake, and told him that there had been an intruder, but I never told him who I'd seen sticking their head out through the hole in my closet -- out from the cavity wall. We called the police, and they did their best to connect it to my mother's disappearance, but in the end, attributed it to an indiscriminate attempted robbery. \n\nMonths went by without her ever turning up, alive or dead, and then a year. I signed up for the Army the day I turned eighteen, and my father killed himself while I was still in Bootcamp. \n\nHe'd called me, at what was determined to be just moments before he put the barrel of his shotgun in his mouth and pulled the trigger. He told me, \"I love you, son. Thank God you didn't see what she's shown me. Forgive me.\"\n\nIn 1999, her remains were found not five hundred yards into the woods, behind the house where she grew up with her parents and sister. She was nothing more than a skull and a handful of scattered bones. \n\nI had been dishonorably discharged from the Army by then and was serving the first of a five-year prison sentence --- the first of two stents of a hard time I'd end up serving, and so Jack had what little was left of my mother's remains cremated, and still has them to this day. \n\nI've just been released from the second sentence.\n\nI've been staying at the motel near Jack's place for a few nights now. I've broken my parole, so there's no going back at this point. See, my mom's friends had said over the years that she was planning to leave Jack; something I wasn't even aware of at the time. I wonder if he knew that. \n\nEven more, I wonder what he'd have done if he found that out... \n\nPossessive, jealous Jack. Unable to even allow her to share her love even with her only son. \n\nI've done a lot of research on that cult of his, and I wonder what he might've subjected her to he'd found out she would leave him. A spiritually desperate woman, willing to do anything to speak with her dead family again... \n\nWe'll find out tomorrow night when I pay him a visit.",

        "text": "July 26, 2017. I finally received my license as a real estate agent. I can officially start selling homes to buyers whose dreams are to start a life in a beautiful domicile. I signed up with an agency right away and said goodbye to my draining call center job. I’ve been representing clients for the past 5 years to help them get their dream home and 90 percent of the time, I always get them the house. I don’t mean to brag but if you check my reviews on yelp you’ll see that every client praises me and it always reads “Ask for Shelia, she’s the best”. I take pride in my job and I love what I do, every client I’ve always had leave’s satisfied. I’ve only had one client who’s offer was rejected but I was able to get them a better house with double the square foot at 100 thousand less. The joy I give, in being able to provide to my clients something they call home is what makes it all worth it.  \n\nMarch 16, 2021 \n\n1101 W Hawthorne St., 2, 104 square foot, priced at 179,000. Listed at 930 pm on a Saturday night. I knew this house would get alot of applicants, it was inevitable. A nice home in a gated suburban community at less than 200,000, you bet your ass this house would get a shit load of attention. I got assigned my beloved client, her name, Lisa May.  \n\nWe had a house visit for Sunday at 3 in the afternoon as I would be showing her the place. Driving into the neighborhood felt like a dream, hell I’d be interested in the house myself if I wasn’t selling it. As usual once I arrived there were already people parked outside waiting for their appointments. I usually judge the vehicle they drive seeing if they could even afford a house, sounds wrong but in this line of business you had to know your competition. I texted Miss May but I haven’t heard from her, I found it odd since most clients would be ecstatic with text messages, but no, not Miss May, this lady was something. \n\nI arrived on time waiting for Miss May but she was already late. I called immediately and she answered her phone, I was caught off guard because I thought she wouldn’t answer her phone.  \n\n“Miss May, I am outside the house waiting for you”, I said \n\n“I am inside the house Miss Margery” she responded.  \n\nI was confused, how? I didn’t see anyone walk in thru the front door. I entered the home and there she was, a skinny woman walking around in the room, gazing at the ceiling.  \n\n“Isn’t it beautiful Margery?” \n\n“How did you get inside the house?”, I asked.  \n\n“I went in thru the back, I couldn’t wait one more second to come see my dream home”.   \n\nI thought it was a bullshit excuse but I went along with it.  \n\n“We’ll, this is the house, you can have a look around and tell me if it’s to your liking” \n\n“Are you kidding…I love this house miss Margery. I’ve already looked around everywhere before you came in and it’s all very beautiful, I can picture myself living in this house and growing a family.” \n\n“That sounds wonderful Miss May”, I said.  \n\n“Well now, you can cancel all the appointments, I’ll be taking the house” \n\nThe fuck, was she delusional.  \n\n“Miss May, I can’t possibly do that” \n\n“Why not?” She demanded.  \n\n“We need to give others a chance to look at the house too,” I said.  \n\n“We’ll that’s why I asked for you in particular, I REQUESTED you personally because of your track record, this no longer is a competition, it’s a sale that’s off the market”.  \n\nSome thing about this woman did not seem right. She looked like a 109-pound problem that I knew would leech on till she got what she wanted.  \n\n“You will need a pre-approval before we can move forward” \n\nShe pulled out a vanilla folder from her purse with paperwork inside.  \n\n“I am already pre-approved and for more than the asking price, now call the owners and tell them I’ll throw in another 100 thousand Miss Margery”.  \n\nI felt threatened, she was forcing me into this, but I had to put her in her place.  \n\n“Miss May, i can’t simply call the owners and have them hand over the house right here, right now, that’s not the way this business works, you will need to fill out a offer letter and we can submit it to them”. \n\nShe looked furious; she obviously didn’t like what I told her.  \n\n“Miss Margery, I would hate to kill your good review streak with a bad one”.  \n\nI had it.  \n\n“Miss May, you have a good day” I exclaimed.  \n\nI was upset, as soon as I was about to leave, she yelled wait.  \n\n“I do apologize, I did not mean to threaten you. You just have no idea how badly I want this house. Have you ever wanted something so bad in your life, you will do anything to get it Miss Margery? I may sound like a spoiled brat, but I always get what I want, I would hate to lose this house.” \n\nI knew I should not have given in but as the kind of person I was I accepted her apology and advised her that everything would be fine, we just needed that offer letter. She calmed down after that and acted civil.  \n\n“Miss Margery, we will get this house, I know it, my mother always said, if you want something you go and get it. I have faith they’ll accept my generous offer”.  \n\nI shook her hand and she walked over to her Prius, yea... not exactly the type of car to afford this house. I waited for her offer letter that night. This didn’t feel right to me, as ruthless as I am with a sale, I knew who the good clients were and who were the bad. I received her offer letter, and I submitted it to the owners. I honestly dreaded if she couldn’t get the house because this lady was trouble from the moment, I saw her. The next day, my phone kept blowing up with her texts.  \n\n“Any updates” it read, and I would simply reply “not yet” and to some I just wouldn’t reply, if I didn’t reply she would call me, I had at least 30 missed calls, I couldn’t stand her. \n\nThen, 2 days later, the house sold. But not to Miss May. When she found out the house was off the market, she called me right away. \n\n“Why didn’t I get my house?”, she exclaimed over the phone. She was as mad as the next crazy person. \n\n“Who got the house?” she demanded to know. \n\nIn reality I didn’t know who did and even if I knew I would not tell her. \n\n“I don’t know Miss May, things like this happen, it’s unfortunate but I can go ahead and try and find you another house.” \n\n“Are you stupid? I do not want any other house. I want MY house! Now you call the owners and sort out a deal.” \n\n“Miss May I cannot do that.” I told her. \n\nIt stayed silent for a minute; I could hear her breathing fuming over the phone. \n\n“You are useless, good for nothing, you shouldn’t even be in this business, I pity the next person that has you as an agent”. \n\nShe hung up. \n\nI took the beating, but I knew that this would be the last time I heard from this crazy lunatic. Did I feel bad? Of course, what person would not but at least I had her out of my hands...and life and even better than I did not get her the house, it is the other way around, I pity the next person who has her as a client, good riddance.  \n\nThe next day I felt exhausted and didn’t want to handle anymore clients, I decided to take a week off and take a break after the mental exhaustion from Miss May, the worst part of it was this wasn’t the last time I would hear from her. \n\nIt was a Wednesday afternoon when I was alone at my local coffee shop “Moonbeans” drinking my white mocha chocolate, when I got a text message, it was Miss May. I felt the blood drain from my face just seeing her name pop up on phone. I wanted to enjoy my vacation, she was the reason I was on it, I didn’t want to accede to her delusions, I put my phone down but the moment I did I got another message and it was from her. I opened it and it was a picture message, it was a picture of the Hawthorne house from the outside. Odd, why would she send me this, then I read the message. \n\n“I worked out a deal with the owners and NOW...the house is mine. I am the happiest person alive.” \n\nI didn’t reply. I blocked her number and continued drinking my coffee, but I could not shake her off my mind. Why did this person control my thoughts? But quite honestly, how the hell did she get the house? I’m sure she played herself like a lunatic until the owners gave in but I doubt anyone would give up a beautiful house to a maniac. I had to find out. \n\nI called up Fabian, a friend of mine who had sold the Hawthorne house and asked him for a favor, I asked him who he had sold the house to, and he told me it was sold to a family of five. Three children, a mother and a father, he sent me a picture of the offer letter, it was adorable, you can tell they took their time to make it, at the bottom was a picture of the happy couple with their son, daughter and a baby boy, they needed the house more than Miss May. This didn’t make any sense to me, how would the owners agree to Miss May’s offer. I went against protocol and called the original owners, I acted as a shopper. \n\n“Hello, I’m calling about the house you have for sale. Is it still available?” \n\n“No, I’m sorry, it’s already been sold”  \n\n“If I may ask, did a Lisa May ever contact you regarding the house?” \n\n“I have no idea who that is and no we have not, why are you asking this question?” \n\nI hung up. Either Lisa was lying, or she slithered her way into the house and claimed it as her own, which sounds absurd but, in her world, plausible, I knew how bad she wanted the house, it just might sound crazy, but I think that is it.  \n\nI threw my coffee and headed to the Hawthorne house and there it was, her green Prius car parked outside, but how? This was not an attack on my ego but how the fuck was she able to get the house THEN she stepped out, I quickly drove around the house and parked in the corner of the neighborhood hoping she would not see me.  \n\nShe looked nervous, constantly looking around and in a hurry, she walked over to the back of the house and disappeared, I wanted to drive around to see what she was doing but then I saw her pull up in an Infiniti, what the hell was going on? She drove it inside the garage and closed it, she was being quick about it as if she did not want anyone to see her. She then got inside her vehicle and parked it in the garage driveway, then I also noticed it, some red on her hands, almost looked like blood. This was extremely weird and frightening, her mannerisms were letting me know that something was wrong with this picture, she was too anxious, and it spelled out like she was trying to hide something. \n\nI needed to find out what was going on, do I just go up to her? do I play friendly so she can let me in? I texted her. \n\n“Hey, are you available right now? Would love to talk about how you got the house?”   \n \n\nShe texted right away. \n\n“No, I am busy right now, thanks” \n\nBitch, I know what she is up to. I wanted to knock at the door, I felt like I needed to find out what was going on. I got out of my car, I texted Fabian letting him know I was making a stop at the Hawthorne house and that I would contact him in an hour, if he didn’t hear from me to call the police. I walked to the front door and knocked. She answered and looked surprised. \n\n“Margery! What are you doing here?”  \n\nShe was nervous to see me, she obviously didn’t want me here. \n\n“I am very busy Margery; can you please go” \n\nI let myself inside and started looking around the house. \n\n“I just wanted to stop by and congratulate you Miss May, what’s wrong?” \n\nShe eased down a little and let out a smirk. \n\n“Nothing is wrong Margery; I just think that is wrong timing is all” \n\nI saw the red on her hands. \n\n“Did you cut yourself? You have blood on your hands, Lisa” \n\nShe looked at her hands then put them away on her back. \n\n“Yes, I cut myself cooking this afternoon Margery, why all the fucking questions?” \n\nShe started to get mad, but I was not scared of her, I saw the fear in her eyes. I pulled out my phone. \n\n“I will call the police if you don’t tell me what’s going on Lisa” \n\nThen, I heard a baby crying. I stood still, my heart dropped. I looked at her straight in the eyes and her fears turned into a sinister smile. She walked over to one of the rooms as I held my phone in my hand with the hairs on my arm standing up. She walked out of the room carrying a baby, the exact same baby in the picture. I was shaken, I could not move. \n\n“Who’s is that baby, Lisa?” \n\nShe giggled. \n\n“It’s my baby boy, I told you I wanted to start a family Margery and I always get what I want” \n\nThe baby cried as if it was in pain, like in colic pain. She hushed the baby and comforted it. \n\n“Where’s the family Lisa? Where are the parents? WHERE ARE THE CHILDREN???” \n\nShe stepped closer to my space. \n\n“Let me take you to them”. \n\nBefore I could react, I felt something metal hit the back of my skull and I hit the floor instantly. Lisa’s feet looked blurry as I tried to get up. I felt another bang but in the side of my waist, a fucking shoe. Someone was with Lisa, a male figure, I could not see his face from the shock. I heard commotion.  \n\n“WHY THE FUCK DID YOU LET HER IN?” \n\n“I didn’t, she let herself in Anthony!”  \n\n“Now we have another body to get rid of on top of the others, my fucking god!!”  \n\n“You’re making the baby cry Anthony, now shut the fuck up and put her with the rest of them”. \n\nI felt a noose tie around my neck as I was being dragged around the house, I let out a loud scream hoping someone would hear me, I was being pulled by Anthony to the basement of the house as I heard him yell at me to shut the fuck up. My body was being dragged on the floor like a rag doll, Anthony then threw my body into the basement slamming my back on the stairs, feeling every puncture of the stairs hit my back like a pin ball machine until I hit the cold hard gray cement of the floor. Anthony slammed the door shut and I heard him lock it from the outside. I layed there on the floor in pain trying to master the strength to get up, my body must have been all bruised up. As I got up, I looked around the dark room, just an old beat-up washer and dryer and a sink on the side with some old rotting clothes on the floor with two dog bowls on the floor next to them. \n\nA ball came rolling my way from the corner of the room to my feet, I looked at the dark corner and couldn’t see a thing. \n\n“Who’s there?” \n\nI moved closer than a small boy came out and ran towards me, I shrieked as he grasped both his arms around me for a hug. It was the family’s son. I do not do well with emotions or hugs, but I put my arms around him forcing some sort of emotion out of me. A little girl stepped out of the darkness; her eyes filled with tears.  \n\n“Where are your mom and dad?,” I asked. \n\nThe little girl took her time to answer. \n\n“They are dead,” she responded with bleak dryness.  \n\nI did not know how to respond, I stayed quiet, I’m sure they were closer to their parents than I was to mine. My father died before I can say goodbye to him and I blame that on my mother, she hated him so much that she knew he was on his last day of life when he didn’t take his pills that night, my mother suggested he shouldn't. I really wish I knew my father; he was a lot kinder than my bitch of a mother who mistreated me, abused me and made my life a living hell till I grew up and eloped with a 19-year-old boy when I was only 17 just to get out of the house. We divorced three years later, I could not be in a marriage, he wanted children and I hated children, having someone else control me and not wanting me to be my own person. I struggled to be in the position where I am at, that is why I can identify with my mother now, the cold, meanness of how life can treat you, only to end up in a worse situation than yesterday and now here I am, held prisoner with two parentless children. I would not make a good role model or parent. I felt nothing but a clutch around my waist.  \n\n“I’m...sorry”, I struggled to even show empathy.  \n\n“Who are you?”, the boy asked. \n\n“I’m Margery, I sell houses and now I am stuck in one.” \n\n“Are you going to help us get out of here?,” he cried. \n\nI let go. \n\n“I’ll try, have you all eaten anything?,” I asked. \n\n“Whenever they give us food, they serve it in a dog bowl, they give us bread sometimes and we can make toast with the toaster,” the girl replied.  \n\nI reached to see if I had my cellphone, but they took it away, of course.   \n \n\nI walked up to the door and banged on it. \n\n“Let us out!! You have no idea how much trouble you are in,” I yelled out. \n\n“They're going to ignore you,” the little girl said. \n\nShe was right, it was hopeless, who knows what they were doing out there. I knew she was trouble when I first met her, she had an objective, and she went through with it in the evilest way.  \n\nIt was dark already, judging by stomach grumbling, I always get hungry by 7 if I have an empty stomach. I banged on the door again, weakened by my bruises and hunger. \n\n“I’m hungry, I want something to eat”, I yelled out. \n\nA shadow ran towards the door and banged on it hard. \n\n“Shut the fuck up you bitch, I’ll feed you when I feel like it”, Anthony yelled back.  \n\nI banged on the door some more, I ignored him and kept yelling at him. \n\n“Get me something to eat, you fucking monsters!”  \n\nI banged harder and harder until finally Anthony came running towards the door, I heard the key jingle as he was trying to unlock it. He opened the door, and I stepped back as he pointed a gun to my face. \n\n“I can shoot you right now,” he said walking towards me as I stepped back with each step he took. \n\n“Do it,” I exclaimed to him.  \n\n“Dont” \n\nI heard a voice come in. Lisa May. \n\nShe walked her way into the basement standing right behind Anthony. \n\n“She deserves so much worse than death,” saying to Anthony.  \n\n“What are you all going to do? Just keep us locked here?” \n\n“Yes, until we finish burying the hole to your grave along with the rest of this family that tried to take away my home,” said Lisa, her tone full of hate.  \n\n“Now you will do as your told inside my house and shut your mouth, if you bang again on that door, I’ll chop off your fingers with a cigar cutter. Anthony, feed them their food.” \n\nAnthony opened a large can of beef stew and dumped it in the dog bowls. I don’t know how I’m going to get out of this but I have to think of something before all of us become a pile of dead bodies.",

        "text": "It all started when an autistic girl transferred to our class. She wasn't bothering anyone. Used to seat in the corner, won't look anyone in the eye and barely spoke. Personally, I didn't mind her at all, but she had this habit, every time she got annoyed, angry or sad about something, she used to take out a little tin can and shake it next to her year. It had a very sharp sound that annoyed everyone else, but only those sounds made her crying stop. \n\n\"Look at her getting special treatment.\" \n\nJenny murmured to me once again when she kept on shaking the tin can and teacher didn't tell her anything.   \n\"Totally, if it were one of us making noise teacher would've screamed at us by now, so unfair.\"   \nAs always Lola was there to agree with Jenny. Jenny was the popular girl, while me and Lola were her friends, so I guess we always played along with whatever she said. Even right now Jenny was looking at me, as if demanding to agree with her.   \n\"She is a bit annoying.\"   \nI agreed out of habit at this point, I didn't have the energy to argue with her. In her mind she was always right and everyone else was wrong.   \n\"I know right?\" All of a sudden Jenny smiled sharply. \"I'm gonna teach her a lesson, stay behind after class.\"  \nThis is where I should've known that things would go south. This was Jenny, always bulling others and Lola always following her lead. I never gained any satisfaction from this kind of sessions, I was just afraid of Jenny to be honest. She could get violent at times, I just didn't want to be on her bad side.  \nThe class ended.  \nThe girl was always the last one to leave the class, it took her slightly longer to pack up her things. Jenny and Lola were taking their time as well, looking at each other with strange spark in their eyes.   \nThe teacher asked the girl if she wanted any help, but as always she declined. she HATED when anyone touched her things. Classroom was almost empty except for us four.   \n\"Hey there!\"   \nThe moment Jenny said those words, the girl took out her tin can and started shaking it next to her ear.   \n\"Hey can you talk?\" Jenny approached the girl. She wasn't looking at her and was just shaking her can rapidly.  \n\"Hey Jenny I think she's mute?\" Laughed out Lola. \"Come on talk to us! we just want to be your friends!\"  \nLola was standing already next to the girl, putting her arm around her. The girl tried to push Lola away.   \n\"Oh my did you just hit my friend?\" Jenny closed the distance between them. \"You better say you're sorry!\"   \nThe girl stepped back, she kept on shaking the tin can rapidly.   \n\"Hm, if you're not going to apologize, at least tell me what's in that box!\"   \n\"I don't know...\" Her voice was very faint, I could bearly hear it.   \n\"Ohh there we go, so you can talk after all! Go on now, tell me why do you not know?\" Jenny pressed her on, looking at her sharply.   \n\"Mom told me not to open it, she said that there is something special inside, she told me not to open it, so that whenever I am sad  I can think about nice things that are in the box and feel better.\"   \n\"OH my and why are you shaking it now? do you not like hanging out with us? You hear that Lola?\"   \n\"Ohh, she doesn't seem to like us.\"  \nThe girl was shaking more and more, she could bearly catch her breath.  \n\"Guys let's leave her be, what if she gets actually sick or something.\"   \nJenny just looked at me sharply and shifted her gaze back to the girl. \" I'm so sick of people like you getting special treatment, like why? what's the big deal anyway? What's so special about you? And what's so special about that tin can anyway. I'm just going to showyou how real world works.\"   \nWith this Jenny yanked the tin can out of the girl's hand and opened it, a dozen tiny rocks fell out of the can and fell on the floor. Jenny's face shifted and slowly turned into a hysterical grin.   \n \"Oh my goodness, there is literally trash in here! I can't even! A,ll this time you were holding on to a trash can, what a joke!\"   \nThe girl looked even worse than before, she started to hyperventiliet, she was looking around like some cornered animal.   \n\"no..no..there are nice things inside...no...why would Mom lie...no...\"   \n\"Yes yes it's just trash, all this time you thought it was treasure, but your mom put bounch of trash into the box, welcome to the real world.\"   \nAt this point Lola was also looking a bit concerned at Jenny. She looked almost mad, as she laughed hysterically she threw the tin can right at the girl and fell to the floor with a loud click.   \nI wanted to say something, but at that point I could feel a disgusting smell coming out of the can, it smelled like nothing I had smelled before. The can was closest to Lola, I saw her gag and vomit on the floor.   \n\"What the fuck is there shit in there too?\" Jenny still wouldn't stop laughing.   \nAnd that;s when all of us heard a click and everything went dark. Jenny stopped laughing.   \n\"What happened to the..\" I couldn't finish the words when the light switch went back on.   \nAnd there she was, the girl, but she looked completely different, her eyes were completely white and she had a long grin stretched across her face.   \n\"Why aren't you laughing now? Are you mute? let me check.\"  With this she took her long fingers and yanked them directly into Jenny's mouth. Jenny started to scream with pain, blood started to come out of her mouth. \n\nAt that moment it was as if my body moved on it's own, I turned around and ran as fast as I could.   \n\"Oh now you don't\"   \nI heard behind me and the lights went out. I was running, I was sure that the door was supposed to be there by now, but still, I was running, I did not feel a door, nor a wall. I could still hear Jenny's screams.   \n\"No, get away from me!\" This was already Lola's voice. \"No, not my eyes, please not my eyes.\"   \nAnd the light's went back on. There she was, standing right in front of me, it's as if I did not move at all.   \n\"I hate people like you too.\" She murmured, looking at me with those white eyes. \"You're even worse than them, they atleast have the guts to do what they want, but you! You're a total loser.\"   \nI couldn't get myself to move, the smell, the blood on her face, her eyes.   \n\"If you ever see someone get bullied, defend them, or else I'm going to take your eyes, tongue, leggs, arms and whatever else you find valuable.\"   \nThen she just walked out.  Lola and Jenny were sitting there, both had tin cans in their hands, and they were shaking them violently.   \nNone of them ever spoke a word again, after that day I also intervene if someone is getting bullied. Every time I see her eyes, it's as if she is there standing next to every kid who is getting bullied.",

        "text": "I can’t believe I finally got the guts to post this to social media.\n\nAfter three years, I’m finally ready to tell our story. \n\nI know I shouldn't. This is a huge risk, and I’m putting both myself and my friends in danger of being caught by some pretty bad people who are currently hunting us down. \n\nMy life as I knew it ended in 2020. (I would talk about how ironic it was that it had to be 2020, but I don’t have time to ramble). I was volunteering as a lab assistant for a college professor I was close to. After graduating at the top of my class, I had been offered the opportunity to assist him overseas as a voluntary research assistant. I should have been working in his usual lab at the college, but due to certain ethical issues he didn’t want to deal with on campus, he decided to fly his most promising students to his primary lab on a tiny Indonesian island. He took on six of us. \n\nThe top of his class, as well as students who seemed far too interested in what he was really working on.  Normally, college professor’s would discourage curiosity when it came to their private lives and work, but he welcomed it, allowing certain students glimpses into the research he was working on under his façade.  I can’t say I wasn’t curious about the paperwork I happened to glimpse, paperwork covered in special plastic seals brandishing TOP SECRET in bold lettering which was definitely intriguing. \n\nSure, I wanted to know what was so special about his research that it warranted that kind of seal, but it’s not like I broke into his lab unlike my colleagues. (You would think biology students would be smart, but those idiots didn’t stand a chance with the amount of security our college had). \n\nI thought that would be a sure fire suspension, and it almost was until the professor himself had pardoned them before inviting the group alongside me to work with him on this secret project. I know I sound crazy for taking a voluntary job, but the job was on a tiny island just off of the coast of Indonesia—which meant I was working in paradise. It was like being on a permanent vacation. We had the beach at our disposal, and the local resort was just up the road. After sweating in the lab on weekdays, we headed to the private resort down the road from the lab. \n\nProfessor Quincy was a well-known local, so he had managed to get us free entry. I guess you could say I was living the dream. Three years prior, I was in my freshman year of college and I had no idea what I was doing with my life. Fast forward two years, and I had the opportunity of a lifetime. I was working in literal paradise. \n\nIt didn’t last long, of course. I had to wake up from my dream at some point, right? And I did.\n\nMarch 2020.\n\nI can’t remember which date it was. I just remember that it was right at the start of the pandemic, and I was supposed to be going home to see family I hadn’t seen in almost six months. Professor Quincy had been insistent we live and work with him for a certain amount of time, and then he would grant us permission to return home to see our family. \n\nI couldn’t exactly argue against it. Like I said, and I will continue to elaborate through this post, our professor’s work was pretty private. Cell phones were not allowed, and internet access was limited. If I needed to phone home, I had to sign seven different forms to promise I wouldn’t leak any information on his work, and to declare that if I happened to do so I would be fired immediately and sent back to the US. \n\nIf that wasn’t enough, my parents would also be held accountable.\n\nSo, yeah. Obviously, I wasn’t going to start spilling our professor’s secrets.\n\nIt’s not like we were completely cut off. There was a phone in Professor Quincy’s office, as well as the reception at the dorms. \n\nWe were allowed three allocated phone calls a week. After a certain world event had enfolded, however, we were allowed to call our parents pretty much any time we wanted, as long as we signed those release forms. After a full day of none-stop paranoia and too much time skimming news articles on my laptop, I was itching to talk to mom. I just didn’t know how to tell her that I wouldn’t be seeing her in… I had no idea. The US borders were shutting, and I was at a loss what to do. If I am to be honest with you, I was terrified. This kind of thing only happened in movies, and there I was trying to figure out a way to tell my mom I wouldn’t be coming home—and I had no idea if I would ever be coming home again. The dorms were state of the art; a huge glass building with three floors. There was a gym, a swimming pool, and a girl’s and boy’s dorm on the top levels. \n\nThere were only six of us, so it was pretty fucking amazing. Sometimes in the summer when it was baking hot, like the kind of heat the human body can’t deal with, they opened the roof, and we would all lie in the reception area, drunk on cocktails from the resort. \n\nBut do you know what wasn’t state of the art? \n\nThe air-con. \n\nI had grown accustomed to the stupid thing breaking every three days. Normally, I didn’t really care. I’d get a cold shower or stick my head in the freezer. That day, though, I had just been informed via email I wouldn’t  be returning home for the foreseeable future. The thing was, I was so used to knowing things in advance. I knew when work was cancelled, or when I was getting sick. Though with this, I had no idea what the outcome would be. Nobody did. The planet was holding a collective  breath. I couldn’t even ask for a possible date, because no one knew how this huge, insane, life-changing thing would play out.\n\nWell, it could play out either one way or the other. And I had seen the movies. I knew the basis, or at least the fictional re-enactment. \n\nSo, sweating through baking heat, I sat cross legged on prickly carpet, squeezing the phone in my palmy hands. I could glimpse Kaian through the window, slumped on a sun-lounger with his head tipped back. He was frowning at an odd looking bird which was perched on the upper deck. It was early evening, and the sun was starting to set. God, I loved watching the sunset. It was like the sky had turned into cotton candy, streaks of burning red and pink enveloping crystal blue and dimming the sky, making it easier to get a good luck at the sun.\n\nKaian’s light brown hair exploded into hues of vivid red, and I was momentarily taken-aback by the sight—like the sky had set his hair on fire. Ever since meeting him in my freshman year, I’d had a crush on Kaian. Being half-Thai with striking features and a Hollywood smile, my ass was already on the floor. \n\nHowever, after living with him for several months, and studying alongside him for years, I had come to realise he was more of a wolf in sheep’s clothing. Not exactly a dick, but not the nicest either. Kaian was deaf and had become the sort of “jock” of our little research group. He had been the one to stage the break-in attempt into Professor Quincy’s lab. I always wondered if they really had discovered something—and blackmailed Quincy into letting them in on the research. \n\nI wouldn’t put it past my classmates. They were as nutty as our professor. I was half-wishing mom didn’t answer. Then I would have no choice but to tell her through email, which was better. \n\nStill though, I wanted to hear her voice, even if it was going to send me over the edge. When my mom’s voice crackled through the phone, I panicked and said the first thing which came to mind. “I’m... I’m staying here for a little longer.” I said. “I was told this morning I can’t come home.”\n\nMom was silent for a moment before she sighed. “Yeah.” I was surprised when she chuckled. “I figured that, sweetie.”\n\n“You’re not mad?” I whispered.\n\nShe didn’t reply for a moment before sighing. “Why would I be mad? It’s not like you can help it.”\n\nSqueezing the phone tighter, I turned away so Kaian couldn’t see me sobbing like an idiot. “It’s not for long,” I said, or rather lied. I wasn’t just trying to reassure my mother, I was desperate to make myself feel better too. “I think it’ll be late April, or maybe May. I’m not sure yet.”\n\n“Well, I’m excited to see you.”\n\nNodding, I swallowed a wracking sob. “I’m excited to see you too, mom.”\n\n“Are you eating well?”\n\n“Uh, yeah. The food here is great.”\n\n“How is work?”\n\nShe was avoiding elaborating on a conversation neither of us wanted to have, and I didn’t blame her.\n\n“It’s fine,” I said, “We’ve been working in some pretty, uh… intense heat. But I’m fine. I just cool off in the sea.”\n\n“That’s good.” I could sense my mother’s smile, and it made me feel ten times worse.\n\n“How… how are things over there?”\n\nMom hummed. “There’s no toilet paper,” she laughed, “But we’re all fine. Your little brother is baking cookies. Do you want to talk to him?”\n\n“No.” I said, far too fast. “I mean… I don’t have much time, and I wanted to talk to you.” I swallowed. “If that’s okay.”\n\n“Of course, honey.” Mom’s voice felt like warm water coming over me, relieving my stiff muscles. “Oh! Your father just finished cleaning your room out the other day! You would not believe how much stuff we had to take to a yard sale. Do you remember that dollhouse you had?”\n\n“Uhh—”\n\nShe cut me off. “Well, I’ve given it to Mrs Jason’s daughter. Do you remember Lucy?\"\n\n“Lucy.” I said, my mind elsewhere. “She was that kid… umm…”\n\n“You held her at your auntie Christine’s birthday party, do you remember? She’s always asking about you. She thinks you’re a marine biologist.”\n\n“Oh.” I said helplessly. Sensing movement, I twisted around to find Kaian heading up the stairs. Probably to his room. \n\nUsually, Monday nights were reserved for the beach. After lights out, we headed down to the coves which were a three minute walk from the dorms to paddle in bioluminescent plankton illuminating the stuffy night.\n\nIt was like dipping your feet in liquid stars. From the look on my colleague’s face however, a sort of not-entirely-there frown, I doubted anyone was in the mood for our usual trip to the beach. Offering the boy a wave, I pulled my knees to my chest. I didn’t realise I’d left an awkward pause until mom cleared her throat loudly, snapping me out of  my trance.\n\n“Wren, did you hear what I just said?”\n\n“Wren.”\n\nMom only had to say my name to send my heart into my throat. “Honey, are you crying?”\n\nI had to heave in a breath. “No.”\n\n“You’re watching the news, aren’t you?”\n\n“Mom, I’m fine.”\n\n“Are you sure?” Mom paused. “Wren, I can’t imagine what you must be feeling right now, but I’m just a phone-call away.”\n\nI nodded, my eyes burning. “I love you, mom.”\n\n“I love you too, baby.” Mom’s voice hitched, and she was splintering. I could tell by her sharp breaths. “I’ll see you soon, okay?”\n\nThat was the last time I ever spoke to my mother.\n\nThe sky was dark when I pulled open the door to my shared room and face-planted into my bed. Long after putting the phone down, I sat in the reception area and cried like an idiot. Then I went outside to attempt to read a book on a sun lounger, but with the lack of sun, and the fact that the outdoor light was broken, I gave up and retreated upstairs. \n\nRiss, my roommate, was typing loudly on her laptop when I bothered lifting my head from my snot-drenched pillow. \n\nShe had been taking the news surprisingly well, despite her being the one in our group who was over-emotional. She was a natural redhead but had dyed her hair an odd pastel pink colour which was starting to come out. I could see her natural vivid red roots springing from her half-assed ponytail. “How’s your mom?” \n\nRiss didn’t look up from her laptop screen, her fingers dancing across the keyboard. I glimpsed the word doc she had been working on earlier in the lab. We were supposed to type up all the findings from the days experiments earlier, and as usual Riss was the last to submit hers. She was the lazy daydreamer out of our group, often getting chastised for zoning out during  lectures and falling asleep. Riss was smart though. Seriously smart. When she felt like it.\n\n“Hello?” Riss slammed the space-bar. “How was the talk with your mom?”\n\n“It was fine.”\n\n“Doesn’t sound like it,” Riss hummed. “Come on, I know when you’re upset—fuck.” She hissed through her teeth, going to town on the backspace key. “Stupid fucking autocorrect.”\n\nI didn’t reply for a moment, suffocating myself in my pillow. The air-con was broken again, so I was left to suffer, stewing in the same clothes I had been wearing all day. I needed a cold shower and something from the downstairs kitchen, but I couldn’t be bothered moving. Besides, Riss’s typing was comforting, lulling me into almost-slumber. \n\nAfter a while of just basking in the sound of her typing, my roommate sighed loudly. I sensed her jump up from her bed and move to her desk. My roommate had a routine I was  used to. After typing up her usually late reports, she jumped up, did some stretches, downed the bottle of water on her desk, and then jumped up and down with too much energy, awaiting the print out. Just as I thought, I cringed at the sound of our printer booting up. I hated the noise. It sounded like nails on a chalkboard. “It’s the end of the world as we know it.” Riss murmured with another loud, exaggerated sigh. “And we’re stuck in paradise.”\n\nRefusing to lift my head from my pillow despite the heat, I scoffed into the material. “Stop saying that.”\n\n“Stop saying what?”\n\n“That it’s the end of the world.”\n\n“I mean, it is. Certain events aside, have you seen the state of the ozone layer? Dude, we’re on a one way ticket to extinction.”\n\nI really didn’t need Riss’s “comforting talks” right then. Her idea of reassuring was reminding me how many species were dying out.\n\n“Uh-huh.” I said, cutting into the slightly manic polar bear rant. “Can we talk about something else.”\n\n“But it’s true.” Riss chuckled. “The world is falling apart, and here we are trying to do the impossible.” She paused. “In one of the most beautiful places on the planet.” When I lifted my head to frown at her, my roommate was sprawled out on her bed, her ten page report awkwardly balanced on her chest. Riss’s eyes were somewhere else, delving into oblivion. \n\nI couldn’t tell what she was feeling. She was smiling, but her eyes were sad. It had taken me a while, but eventually, after weeks and then months had gone by, I had gotten used to Professor Quincy’s research. It was hard to take in at first. Like, you have this huge secret and you can’t tell anyone—if you do you’re risking your own career. I imagined it as a neutron star collision going off in my head, an explosion of colours nobody else could see but us. \n\nLocked away on this tiny island, we were the only ones who knew Quincy’s goal. There was one rule in the lab. \n\nNo emotions. We weren’t allowed to have emotions once stepping through the door. We had to stop being human for the sake of achieving successes and moving onto a different age. A better age. That’s what Quincy said, anyway. I wondered if Riss was thinking about  the work we did earlier. She had broken down three times since starting, though she was getting better. Riss didn’t speak much after an awkward conversation we had about the end of the world, which bled into a conversation about The Walking Dead. \n\nIt fizzled out after I reminded her I was yet to finish it after dumping it halfway through season four. There’s not much to do in the dorm. I had my laptop and several dozen movies downloaded onto it, but I wasn’t in the mood to delve into fiction.  I was falling asleep when our door flew open, and Riss almost catapulted her laptop across the room. My gaze flicked to the doorway, where Kaian stood, a scowl carved into his lips. It wasn’t unusual that my colleague was scowling or standing in our doorway. He was always the first one up on a morning, quick to wake everyone else up despite the sun not being up yet.\n\n“Kaian?” Riss signed, her eyes glued to our damp-looking colleague. “What the hell?”\n\nLooking at him, I could tell that Kaian wasn’t there willingly. His hair was a soaking mess plastered to his forehead, a plaid shirt clumsily buttoned over ratty shorts. He looked like he’d just gotten out of the shower. No, he didn’t just look like it. \n\nI was sure Kaian had just gotten out of the shower. When he held up one hand, and started to furiously sign, the jingling noise brought my attention to the cuff attached to his left wrist. “Jem.” He signed his roommate’s name, and I resisted the urge to collapse back into bed. Nothing was good when Jem was involved. I loved my colleague, but the amount of stupid shit he had done since starting work on the island, he could make his own sitcom.\n\nRiss groaned, shutting her laptop. She quickly signed, “What has he done now?”\n\nKaian’s expression twisted with fury. “What HASN’T he done?” He held up his wrist, signing manically. “He cuffed me to my bed!”\n\n“Kinky.” I shot him a smile, and seeing his expression, I quickly regretted my words when his gaze flashed to a stuffed animal on the floor.\n\nI had no doubt he wouldn’t aim for my face.\n\n“What? Why did he cuff you your bed?” Riss was already pulling on her jacket. I jumped up too, slipping into my sandals.\n\n“Rabbits.” Was all Kaian had to sign with wide eyes, before we were following him back down the dorm hallway, and down the stairs. I was practically falling over myself to keep up. Kaian ran in front, Riss stumbling beside him. If Jem was in the lab after hours, it wasn’t good. Ever since we made the switch from rats to rabbits, Jem had been very vocal that he was against it. But like Quincy said, we had to give up our humanity in that room. Our morals. Anything we thought, our opinions and emotions. We had to suppress it all. \n\nBecause once we started to give into them, our professor had proclaimed—that was when cracks would start to form. According to him, the first step in turning your back on science was giving into your humanity. I wasn’t quite there yet. It’s not like I didn’t have intrusive thoughts about saving the poor things, but Quincy had planted a very specific thought in our heads. If we rebelled, if we leaked information and went against him—our families were at risk of getting involved despite having nothing to do with it. \n\nJem had already submitted multiple complaints, and I didn’t blame him. But it’s not like we could all band together to stop Quincy’s experiments. Like I said, we were walking on eggshells around him and he was already a fairly paranoid man already. And morals and humanity aside, his work was pretty fucking incredible. Disgusting and inhumane? Yes, of course. But truly incredible. The lab was a five minute walk from the dorms. Riss was out of breath as we ran, and I glimpsed a full moon light up the darkening sky, illuminating oblivion in milky white light. “What I don’t understand,” she panted, “Is why cuff you to your bed?”\n\nShe turned to Kaian, who signed, “He knew I was going to tell someone. When I got out of the shower, he grabbed me and cuffed me to the frame.” The boy scowled. “I’m going to kill him.” By the time the three of us were throwing ourselves through the doors of the lab, pressing our identity badges over the mechanical lock, I was sweating. Bad. I think all three of us wanted to collectively murder our colleague. The lab was usually out of bounds after work hours, but sometimes Professor Quincy made exceptions if we needed to finish reports or collect data.\n\nRiss was stabbing in the eight digit code to get into Quincy’s office, and I was struggling to catch my breath, keeled over with my hands on my knees. The building was usually lit up, even at night. I had spent countless after work hours typing up research reports and listening to music, comforted by the warm glow from the lights overhead. But that wasn’t the case on that particular night. A coil of dread began to unravel in my gut as we bound down the main hallway which was swamped in darkness. Riss made a joke about failed experiments lurking around us, and I elbowed her sharply in the gut. \n\nThankfully, Quincy’s main lab was lit up. When the door swung open with a loud beep, the three of us bound straight into a startled looking Jem—whose expression almost matched the ones of the dozen baby rabbits cradled to his chest. If Kaian resembled a Hollywood star, then this guy reminded me more of a punk kid—maybe a theatre kid too. Jem was the wildcard in our group. He wasn’t the smartest, and he struggled sometimes. But Quincy had admired the boy’s curiosity in his research. Jem’s hair was always a mess of dishevelled curls, and his outfit choices were… odd. For example, Jem had opted for wearing pajamas to his rabbit heist.\n\nIt was almost like he had an epiphany in his sleep and hurricane thoughts had led him right to the lab.  For a moment, I was unsure whether to laugh or start yelling at him. Jem peeked at us under his hood, his eyes almost cartoonishly wide. Like he was a kid being caught stealing cookies from the cookie jar. The subjects he was holding seemed to cling onto him, and I had a moment—just a moment—where I cracked slightly. Especially when the largest one’s tiny eyes found mine. \n\nIt was frightened, its claws digging into his sleeve. “I can explain.” Jem finally spluttered, pressing the rabbits closer to his chest. “This is animal abuse.” He said in a hiss. “You’re not really going to stand there and watch that bastard hurt these little guys, are you?” I was sure Jem was convinced he could get away with it by showing us the power of cuteness.\n\nI can’t say it wasn’t working. God, the one in the middle with large floppy ears and a brown smudge on its fur was really looking at me.\n\nLike it was staring into my soul.\n\nNext to me, Kaian’s expression was easing a little. He leaned against the door with his arms folded.\n\n“They’re kind of cute.” He signed, smiling for the first time since earlier that morning when Riss spilled orange juice all over herself.\n\n“See?” Jem’s smile was soft, and he gestured to them. “Look at them! They’re adorable. I’m not going to let him hurt them.”\n\nRiss, however, seemed unfazed. She took a step towards him, her eyes darkening. “Are you fucking insane?” she gritted out. “So, what, you want to let Quincy’s test subjects go?”\n\nJem’s lip curled. “He’s got rats. I’m sure he’ll be fine.” He backed away, clutching the rabbits tighter to his chest. “You’ve seen what he’s done to them,” he whispered—and his gaze flicked to me, and then Kaian. “What WE have done to them. It’s not fair. They’re living creatures, and we’re… we’re hurting them.” \n\nFuck. \n\nThis was what I was afraid of. Ever since the six of us started on the island, and Quincy’s lecture on suppressing our humanity for the sake of science, I knew one of us was going to break when we saw what exactly he was doing to his subjects.\n\nI’m not going to go into detail, because again, I am already putting myself at risk by writing this. But I will say that Quincy’s experiments weren’t.. normal. I’ve already told you they were inhumane and immoral. \n\nBut it didn’t end there. You see, our professor was sure—positive that he could ignite a certain part of the human brain with simple stimulation, a hell of a lot of drugs, and psychological tactics. He believed he could find that missing part that is missing in all of us which stops us from being the apex predator.\n\nAbilities way beyond our comprehension.\n\nProfessor Quincy had been working his whole life to create a serum which would hack into the mind, and switch on that part of us we cannot find on our own. Rats didn’t give him the right results, so we moved onto rabbits. \n\nSo far, I had witnessed a rabbit which could teleport from one cage to the other, after several surgeries, and serum injections directed into its brain. \n\nImpossible. \n\nI thought it was impossible, and yet somehow I was watching it with my own eyes. A living thing disappearing in one place and reappearing in its cage. Through research, we had come to realise the cage was the rabbit’s safe place. Whatever ability it had (and there were many), it would always return to its cage, no matter where we placed them. The serum wasn’t perfect, however. I had witnessed a rabbit interfere with the electronics in the lab, playing with the lights, before exploding into large fleshy chunks painting the metal prongs of its cage a startling gory red. \n\nThe rabbit’s in Jem’s arms were our only proof that the serum worked. They were our last surviving four. Subjects 2, 6, 10, and 15. I have to admit, subject 15 freaked me out. Fifteen’s ability was not yet known, but Kaian was sure that it was developing heightened intelligence. I didn’t know much about Fifteen, but from what I did know, there was no fucking way we could let Jem let the little guy run free. \n\nKnowing what they were capable of, and what we could possibly lose if my colleague got his own way, snapped me out of my, “Aww they’re so cute,” trance. I stepped forward, cringing when I glimpsed remnants of the metal headset which had been drilled into Six’s skull.\n\n“Give them here.” I said, and when Jem started to shake his head, I snapped. “Do you want to get fired?”\n\nHe wasn’t letting up. “They’re living things, Wren!”\n\nI nodded, trying to keep my cool. “They are.” I said. “But they’re also valuable subjects—one of which can fucking teleport. I wouldn’t exactly say they’re normal rabbits.” I held my breath. “Look.” I gave up acting like I knew what the fuck I was talking about. “I don’t like it either, okay? It’s disgusting and immoral, and findings and psychokinetic abilities aside, I would be totally on your side if we didn’t have results.”\n\n“But we do have results.” Kaian signed. He seemed to have snapped out of it too. “Give them back, Jem. They’re research subjects.”\n\n“They’re rabbits! Have you guys lost your minds?”\n\n“Yes.” Kaian signed. “It’s part of the job description, asshole.”\n\n“You have a dog!” Jem shot back in a manic hiss. His expression was feral. I had never seen that kind of desperation, almost unbridled lucidity let loose. “It’s no different to your dog, right? Would you seriously put him through this? Would you stick a needle inside his skull?”\n\nKaian didn’t reply, his jaw clenching.\n\n“No. You wouldn’t. So, why these guys, huh? Why are you willing to be cruel for the sake of science for these guys, but you wouldn’t fucking dream of doing this to your pets?” Jem took another shaky step back, so I figured hitting him with the hard truth would snap him out of it.\n\n“It’s not the same,” Kaian seemed to be struggling, his hands trembling as he signed. “It’s… it’s different—”\n\n“What’s different?” Jem demanded. “There’s no difference! If it were a rat I would feel the same way! We’re hurting living animals.”\n\n“Your dad,” I said quickly, “Do you want to drag him into this?”\n\n“Again.” Kaian started to sign, Riss elbowing him to shut up. It was no secret Jem and his father had been under fire back home after discovering a document he shouldn’t have. All he did was read it. According to the boy himself, he had the Men In Black In Black trying to crash through his door at 4am.  Jem  was lucky Professor Quincy decided to use his curiosity as a tool instead of sending his family to jail.\n\nJem blinked, like he was waking from a trance. “No.” He said, quickly, his resolve crumbling. My colleague allowed Kaian and Riss to take the subjects and put them back in their cages. I expected him to fight back, but the guy seemed weirdly fine with us taking the rabbits back, stumbling away from them like they were contagious. \n\nWith all subjects accounted for, we headed back to the dorms and ate dinner—and I remember running my hands through Jem’s hair, a little bit drunk on cocktails, and promising him that once Professor Quincy was finished with his research, he would let the rabbits go. I wasn’t completely sure of this myself, and it was just a friendly lie to make him feel better, considering he’d been acting weird all night. I had been lazily sipping water to sober myself up when the thought hit me. \n\nIt didn’t really make an impact, more of a passing thought. Did subject Fifteen have any influence over Jem’s mind? \n\nFifteen had already proved it could type a single sentence on a keyboard and tap on a tablet screen to identify certain fruits. \n\nWas if possible that it had developed the ability to influence the  brain? I wasn’t sure I wanted an answer to that. Anyway, we all headed to bed, and I made Jem promise he wouldn’t do something like that again. I still remember the way he’d looked at me, slightly confused, mouth open, like he had no idea what I was talking about. I figured he was just tipsy, and after frowning at me for way longer than necessary, Jem saluted me with a “Yeah, course I promise.”\n\nYeah, that promise lasted maybe six fucking hours.\n\nI was spooning dry cereal in my mouth the next morning, trying to ignore the news bulletin on the TV, when we got the first call. Jem had broken into the lab two hours ago, and let the subjects run free. By the time I’d thrown myself into the lab, barely dressed, the others were already getting screamed at—and I mean SCREAMED at by Quincy. I glimpsed my colleagues through the glass window as I threw myself into a run towards the lab. It looked like they had been dragged out of bed. \n\nRissa was in her robe, Kaian and Jem half dressed. The three were sitting in the communal area looking like they wanted to sink into the earth, while Quincy’s voice reverberated back down the hallway. \n\nWhen I stepped through automatic doors, our professor turned to me, his expression thunderous. “Wren!” He passive aggressively gestured to the others. “Why don’t you take a seat, hm?” His British accent was easy to tolerate usually, but that morning he sounded like a fucking Bond villain. I nodded and practically dived next to Risa, who looked like she was ten seconds from wrapping her hands around Jem’s neck. Kaian was glaring at his lap, ignoring the professor’s ASL, and Jem looked—well, he looked kind of confused.\n\n“You’re late.” Quincy turned his piercing gaze to me.\n\n“I’m five minutes early, Professor Quincy.” I said, glancing at the clock to make sure I was right.\n\nThe man didn’t respond, turning back to Jem. “As I was saying, I was just letting your colleague know that he has thrown quite a wrench in our plans. But no matter, we can fix this.” He cleared his throat. “Mr Saeueng.” Professor Quincy nodded to Kaian. “There are several research subjects in storage that I have been saving for these kinds of emergencies, “ He said. “Please retrieve them so we can continue working on this project. And hurry up.\"\n\nKaian paled. For a moment I thought he was going to barf. “Professor Quincy,” he started to sign, before pausing, “You ordered me to dispose of them two weeks ago,” He shot me a look, and I remembered the two of us loading a cage full of rats into a truck. “We don’t have them.”\n\nThe professor’s expression contorted, and he smiled. He… smiled. Like he thought it was funny. “Right.” He said in a breath. “You’re telling me,” He lifted his arm like he was going to strike each of us. And I sensed the four of us collectively wince. “You’re all telling me—all four of you, that our current research subjects are nowhere to be seen, our backup subjects have been disposed of, and I am supposed to be doing a presentation next week?\"\n\nHis voice cracked. “Next week!” He repeated, beginning to pace, and I was starting to regret choosing my curiosity over my wellbeing. Sure,  psychokinetic abilities are cool, right? Cracking open the human brain and discovering something magical, something out of this world, was a dream come true. We were witnessing history being made. What could fundamentally change the world. \n\nBut I was sitting inside a lab with a man who was clearly unhinged, thousands of miles from home, and no guarantee I would ever return home. A shiver slid down my spine when our professor stopped pacing up and down, and something seemed to light up in his eyes.\n\nI saw it. Something in his brain… snapped. It was like seeing a real-life light bulb moment. “We’re okay.” He said, after a moment of silence. Quincy seemed to gather himself. “You’re dismissed. I will.. I will get my hands on new research subjects, do not worry about that.” His smile was far too big, and I nodded, relieved, and jumped to my feet, eager to make a quick getaway.\n\nJem stood up, grabbing his bag. “Will we have time?” He asked. “I mean… the presentation is next week, and we need to start over.”\n\n“That’s right,” Riss was frowning. “Professor, where exactly are you going to get new subjects? Didn’t the college stop funding the project?”\n\n“Hm? Oh, I have subjects,” he chuckled. “I have always had subjects, don’t worry. They have always been my last resort.”\n\nI nodded. “So, do you have spare rats?”\n\n“Makes sense.” Kaian signed. “I bet he has a secret batch somewhere.”\n\n“Precisely, Kaian.” Professor Quincy nodded, a wide smile splitting his lips apart.\n\n“So, rats?” I pressed. He still was yet to answer my question and I was growing anxious of what these subjects were.\n\nIt must have been rabbits, surely. Rabbits were our best shot at getting results. Rats worked well, I guessed. But not as good as rabbits.\n\nHe caught my eye, and something cold slipped down my spine when the man’s grin didn’t waver. “You could say they’re rats.” He seemed to be drinking me in, his gaze flicking up and down, from my head to my toes. “And don’t worry. They will be ready for the presentation. I will make sure.\"\n\n“Well, that’s great.” Jem’s expression brightened. “So, we didn’t have to use rabbits after all, huh? Who would have thought.”\n\nTo my surprise, the professor was in unusually high spirits. After a lecture repeating his insistence that we had to supress our humanity for the sake of science (which was mostly aimed at Jem) He flocked to his desk, sorting through paperwork, and leaving the room several times to take part in phone calls. He must have really been pushing to get new living materials. I noticed his hands were quivering. Was it fear? \n\nExcitement? \n\nWithout a word, Quincy left the lab with an armful of paperwork. When Riss asked what we were supposed to do, he told us to stay exactly where we were, while he retrieved new research materials. Great. \n\nWith the professor gone, it didn’t take long before Riss was trying to strangle Jem, acting like it was playful, but the look in her eyes definitely had a more nefarious intent. \n\nKaian, being the smartass of our group, was already sorting through our day’s work, as if we hadn’t just lost our subjects. The lab was pretty much our playground (The professor’s words, not mine) but there was a specific room which was out of bounds. Quincy called it the FAIL room, where all of his failed experiments were. Living or dead, or preserved in some weird solution, the exact reason I was convinced he was unhinged, was in that room. I didn’t realise it was unlocked, until a crashing sound sent me jumping up from my chair, my heart catapulting into my throat.\n\nJem and Rissa looked up from their work, and I noticed Kaian’s seat was empty.\n\n“That sounds ominous.” Jem shot me a look. “Did he…”\n\n“He didn’t.” I muttered, my gaze flicking to the other side of the room, where, to my surprise, the room which had always been out of bounds, was in fact open. Before I could hesitate or think of the consequences, I hurried to the door, coming to a grinding halt on the threshold. \n\nI was aware of my colleague’s shadow several feet away from me. I was aware of the petrified look of fright carved into his face, and his eyes, wide, like he was staring into oblivion. Like the darkness had already taken him. \n\nInstead of finding Kaian, I was seeing what I can only describe as several lumps piled on top of each other. When I got closer, forcing my feet into submission, those lumps bled into very human-like figures wrapped in see-through plastic. For a disorienting seconds, while my head spun around and around, a slithery paste crawling up my throat, I saw them as nothing but lumps of naked flesh bulging through plastic. \n\nBut then I was recognising faces, faces I knew--faces which had been mutilated, stained a startling scarlet like they had been dipped in the reddest paint available. I knew the first lump. Sara. She went home two weeks earlier due to illness. The following fleshy lump with its face ripped off, which I could no longer call human, was Thomas. He too went home for a family emergency and never came back. \n\nQuincy said they had both requested to leave. He said they would miss us, but it was too much. Seeing what we were doing was too much for them. They couldn’t suppress their emotions. Sara and Thomas had never left. They never went home—they were right in front of me, reduced to chunks of flesh and bodily organs.\n\nThere was a white strip of paper attached to both of them, a single word written in bold lettering.\n\nFAIL.\n\nThat word sent my stomach heaving, my feet stumbling back, and my body erupting into fight or flight.\n\nKaian twisted around, his face illuminated in dim light flickering from a bulb above.\n\n“Out.” He signed, and it was the desperation in his eyes, the heaving breaths struggling from his lips, which got me moving. I was pressing my hand over my mouth, muffling a sharp scream ripping from my throat, when Kaian grabbed my arm and dragged me back. I was barely conscious of getting out of that room before the alarms started, sending me to my knees.\n\n“What the hell is that?” Riss was next to me, her voice shrill.\n\nJem had his hands planted over his ears, his hand wrapped around a hysterical Kaian. “Wren, what is it? What’s in there?”\n\nI couldn’t reply. Instead of trying to speak or explain, I grabbed her arm and dragged her to the door. Kaian and Jem were already on the hallway, and I was barely slipping back through the automatic doors, before they slammed shut, and a familiar voice crackled over the speakers. “Stay where you are.” Professor Quincy said. “We will be returning to work very soon. By the grace of god, I have found subjects.”\n\nUs.\n\nMy blood ran ice-cold in my veins.\n\nHe was talking about us.\n\n\"What the fuck?!\" Jem yelled. \"What are you talking about?\" \n\nI didn’t think. I just ran. And sprinting down that hallway, which was familiar, which had always felt like a second home to me, I had no idea it would become my prison.\n\nIt would become the very hallway I would wish to die on.\n\nThe hallway I would be dragged down, day after day, while my mind was picked apart. \n\nAhead of us, the doors were shutting, red lights bathing our faces. I remember how scared they were. Jem, who reached the exit doors, slamming his fists into the glass. Riss, trying to override the mechanical lock. Kaian, who had given up, dropped onto his knees, and pulled them to his chest. When gas filled the air, I was still trying to get through the door. Riss had forced Kaian to his feet, and Jem was trying to find any weapon in his vicinity. \n\nBut there were no weapons. There was just the four of us against a gas which was quickly disorienting us. When black spots started to dance across my vision, and Jem’s eyes rolled to the back of his head, his body dropping to the floor, I was thinking about Subject Fifteen. I was thinking about its beady eyes when I bit my lip and drilled into its tiny skull under my professor’s gaze. Riss dropped next.\n\nThen Kaian.\n\nI was quickly losing consciousness, my clammy head pressed against glass, clawing at the lock, when the thought hit me.\n\nWe deserved it.\n\nFor what we had done to those rabbits, playing god, and trying to turn them into something they weren’t—we deserved it.\n\nWhatever my professor was planning to do to us, I had an inkling  it would be far worse than what the rabbits had endured. We were going to suffer, I thought dizzily. \n\nFor science.\n\nAnd I can tell you, three years later, as I currently share a hotel room with three murderers, my past self was fucking right.",

        "text": "I hope this doesn't come across as bragging, but I grew up in one of the biggest, most beautiful homes in one of the most affluent neighborhoods in Southern California. My father worked as a very successful heart surgeon, my mother owned her own bustling business, and my grandmother was retired from a long career on television. \n\n Then there was Grandpa. \n\nGrandpa Ozzy was...well, I don't really know what he did. I just know that he seemed to know a *lot* of people. He seemed to have owed favors from any and everyone; If I went out to eat with grandpa, he never paid a tab. If we went to Disneyland, we would skip lines without having any kind of official passes that I knew of. He even bought me my first car, a brand new Mercedes-Benz, without spending a single cent. You might think this was the good life, and it was to an extent, but there was always something...off about grandpa. \n\n Grandpa liked to spend long hours of the day cooped up in what he called \"the dungeon.\" No one was permitted inside the dungeon except for him or dad. Sometimes Grandpa would take a \"friend\" or two into the dungeon with him; Oftentimes, Grandpa would emerge, sweating and smiling serenely, but I never once saw any of his \"friends\" leave. When I asked him about it once, he simply patted my head, kissed my cheek and whispered, \"You'll be in the family business one day, my dear. Then you will own the world.\" \n\n I was 13 when Grandma Isis got very sick. I couldn't stand the sight of her anymore; It hurt me so much to watch her as she slowly and painfully began to wither away. I distinctly remember being awakened from my sleep one night due to a loud and intense argument between my father and Grandpa Ozzy. I snuck over to my bedroom door and was able to poke my head out just in time to hear the end of it. \n\n \"...how it's gonna be, whether you like it or not. And I'll do the same to you, long before your time, if you say another god damn word.\" Grandpa's threat seethed with venom. Dad was silent; Next thing I knew there were heavy footsteps coming up the stairs. I closed my door and dashed back to my bed, jumping in. I closed my eyes but sleep did not come to me that night. I had never heard the two of them argue before; Did this have something to do with grandma? \n\n Grandma Isis was dead the next day. I remember my mother crying, but dad had a visage of what I can only describe as complete and unmistakable horror. I wanted to ask him what was wrong, but I never summoned the courage to. I wanted to let he and mom grieve in peace. Grandpa Ozzy, however, went on about the day as though it were any other. He ate his peanut butter and banana-laden cereal and drank his glass of cranberry juice without shedding a single tear. When he caught me looking at him he only grinned and shot me a wink. \n\n Death was not yet done with our family. Several years later, when I was in college, I got a phone call that would change my life forever. Mom was dead; Dad could barely croak out the words over the line. It seemed like his very soul was shattered and in mourning. I cried too, and left school early to go and be with him. We buried her a few days later and my father shut himself away in his room. That left me alone with Grandpa Ozzy. \n\n I did not like the sinister twinkle in his yellowed eyes. When he wasn't in the dungeon he would sit in his favorite chair, sometimes reading, other times watching me openly as I stared at my phone or pretended to be asleep on the couch. \n\n \"It pains me that it had to happen,\" he said one day, as the two of us sat eating breakfast. \"I had nothing but admiration for your mother, but she had overstepped her boundaries. I warned your father about this long ago.\" \n\n I was squeezing my spoon so tight that I was almost certain it would be bent when I finally let go. \"What are you implying? Are you saying that you had something to do with my mother's death?\" \n\n Grandpa's eyes never left mine. \"Oh, she's not dead. She's still here with us.\" \n\n When grandpa finally left the house to go and do whatever he did, my father emerged from his room, pale and clearly having lost weight. His eyes were sunken and bloodshot, his hair a mess. He merely stared at me for a few seconds as he stood across the room. \n\n \"Come with me, Dana. I have to show you.\" \n\n I was obviously hesitant. \"Show me what, Dad?\" \n\n \"You need to know the truth. You need to know why I'm going to kill your grandfather.\" \n\n The tone of his voice was enough to tell me that this was not a joke. I stood up slowly and followed my father to the dungeon. He reached out for the doorknob and turned it slowly. The door was never locked; My mother and I had just always known better than to ever step inside. \n\n The room was completely dark, but there were at least a dozen tables, all arranged in strange formations. There were numerous jars on nearly every single table; Some of them were empty, but most had what seemed to be glowing light emanating within. Some of the jars glowed blue, while most were yellow, and others red. There was a raised altar in the center of the room, covered in what could only have been decades' worth of dried blood. I felt my stomach drop as I gazed around the room. I was not meant to be here. This was not a good place. \n\n \"They've all been taken, held prisoner for as long as your grandfather sees fit. Sometimes he...sells them. They have such value you couldn't even comprehend.\" \n\n I picked up one of the red jars and almost dropped it; It was much heavier than it looked. I looked within, but my father shook his head. \"Hold it to your ear.\" \n\n I cannot describe to you the utter anguish and rage in the screams that were erupting within that jar. I nearly dropped it in terror, instead placing it back on the table hurriedly and backing up. \n\n \"Dad...\" I couldn't speak; I couldn't believe my own eyes or ears. This couldn't be...\n\n \"They're souls, Dana. Souls of whoever he wanted to take. Your...grandmother's is over there, the one sitting alone. Dad just couldn't let her go, so he keeps her here.\" \n\n I threw up. Hands on my knees I heaved and heaved, until I felt my father's hand patting my back.  \n\n \"He's hidden your mother from me...he won't release her until I agree to carry on after he's gone. He'll pursue you to continue the tradition soon as well. That's why I'll do what I have to do. I just want you to stay in your room and try to ignore whatever you hear.\" \n\n I lay in bed shivering, no amount of blankets enough to console me. The moonlight shone in through the window, and I imagined my mother, trapped in a jar and unable to ever find peace in the afterlife...\n\n I could hear voices. Were they the voices of the restless, tortured souls? No...this was grandpa, and dad...\n\n Yelling. Then, finally, a gunshot. Another. Tears rolled down my face as I turned over in bed and stared at my bedroom door. Someone was coming up the stairs. They trodded past my bedroom and out of earshot. Then there was silence. \n\n I've been in my room ever since. I'm terrified to get up and see whose corpse lies in the kitchen downstairs. And if their soul is free.",

        "text": "Week 3–5\n\nIt’s been almost a month since my last visit to that damned trail. Since my last attack. My newly found friends, the ones dangerously addicted to the supernatural stuff, convinced me to eventually return. At least one last time. They provided a sensible reason too.\n\nSo, that night when I left my home, the following morning and for the past three weeks, I have been waking up with welts and dark black bruises on my arms, legs, and face. It’s like I have an illness of some sort. Randomly, out of the blue. Not to mention, I’ve also developed consistent night terrors. Every night, for the past three weeks. I’ll wake up in cold sweats between the hours of 2:00 am and 3:00 am. It’s spot on every night. The same nightmare. I’m being dragged down that trail by an almost translucent creature. There’s an outline in front of me, as I’m being dragged. It’s sharp and spikey. If the color was full, it would for sure be jet black. The outline of this thing was humanoid, but the way that it moved was proof that it was far from human. My body feels like it’s burning &amp; I can’t move. I’m not tied or bound. I just cannot move. This creature is making sounds as it’s dragging me. Gurgling and growling I think. It sounds like it’s hungry or angry. Hangry maybe? I know it’s not the time to be funny, but I could use a laugh right now. Considering my current situation.\n\nMy friends tell me that these “night terrors” are demonic attacks. Like getting in a fight, but just on the spiritual plane. Or something weird like that. I’m not completely sure. Not sure that I’ll ever be able to believe in or understand such things. They’re interesting, to say the least. So, according to my friends, if I want these horrible things to stop, I have to return to that trail. Where it all began. I have to face whatever this thing is and demand it to stop. Command it to leave me. This is the sensible reason to return. Apparently. But, then again, look at what I’m dealing with. What choice do I have? All of this is just impossible. Ridiculous.\n\nMy friends have shared with me that they are indeed paranormal enthusiasts. Which, was quite obvious. One of them has been studying paranormal investigation techniques and the science behind it all. The other two have been studying demonology and how to cleanse people of negative energies. In some cases, actual demons. Like living beings that latch to you and deliberately try to harm you and those around you. It’s crazy talk! But, every morning is a solid reminder that the crazy is indeed real. It’s happening to me and affecting my physical body. Ultimately, my friends are considering creating a local paranormal team. Their primary goals would be to gather evidence that the supernatural world exists and to help those in need from what is considered spiritual oppression. Even full-blown possession. Like what you see in the movies apparently. They’ve offered me a spot on their future team, as a researcher and investigator. They said, with my personal experience and open, yet logical mind, we could make a pretty amazing team. They make a good point and I feel honored, but I don’t feel ready. Not yet. I don’t feel that I believe in it enough, or care. Plus, if this paranormal ghost-haunting stuff turns out to be real after all, I’m going to need some time away from it. Seriously.\n\nAlong with all of this to consider, they have provided me with a very detailed breakdown of what I seriously need to consider doing. That is if I want to end this impossible nightmare of course. They have taken the liberty to do a lot of research on the local area. Anything and everything that you could think of. Their research included ghost stories, tragedies, murders, assaults, kidnappings, cults, witchcraft, and so on. Nothing came back with positive results. Now, even though nothing showed up from their research, that doesn’t mean that nothing has ever happened. Or recently happened. This just means that something may not have been discovered or written about yet. What is being considered right now is that there could have recently been a murder or possibly some form of a dark ritual. My friends keep going back and forth between these two possibilities the most. I mean, they make sense. It’s not like a ghost attack can happen out of nowhere for no reason. Right?\n\nI’m going to “stoop” to their level for a moment. Perhaps I’ve had an attachment all of my life. Maybe I’ve only had this alleged attachment for the past five or ten years. Or, according to them, a real classic reason for a haunted location or person is disturbing a grave site. Moreso, a Native American burial ground. Also known as sacred or cursed land. That’s depending on who you are and your intentions of course. But, I wasn’t being disrespectful or disturbing anything. For the past three years, I have run that trail, and I have done no such thing. I have no clue, but it’s possible I guess. From what the guys have been sharing with me lately, these are some other possibilities to consider. The research they’re doing is extensive. I thought college was bad. The tunnel ahead of me looks dark and endless. With no answers to be found. But why now? Why all of a sudden is this thing making itself known to me? Why is it attacking me? Why did this all start at that specific park? Why on the Abbaduk Trail? Why in the form of screams? Why did it start at 8:00 pm and not 3:00 am? The infamous “Witching Hour” that I’m hearing so much about. So many damned questions and sadly no answers. Not yet. But, the more I think about it, the more I want to know.\n\nOver time I’ve become less and less fearful. I’ve made praying a daily and nightly routine, being that it’s the only weapon I know to use in such a scenario. What else can I do? What I’ve noticed, is the more I pray and the more I believe in the power of my prayer, the less often and the less severe my attacks have become. It seems to be working. Like actually working. So, I guess it won’t hurt to keep doing it. My friends also have encouraged me to keep praying. Anything positive and filled with good intentions can break down a negative being or force. They’ve been praying with me as well. Between the three of them, they all have been allowing me to stay at their homes throughout this entire process. Talk about being lucky. I can’t be alone right now and I need as much guidance as possible on what to do to stop this.\n\nWe haven’t visited the actual location since we all met. It’s been more or less a time of preparing. What we are preparing for is to conduct an investigation and then an actual deliverance. The deliverance is to be done on me and the land. We are going to return to that exact spot on that exact trail and investigate the surrounding areas. Perhaps we’ll find something that will indicate what this thing is and why it’s chosen to attack me. We’re planning on going tomorrow evening. We’re going to start the investigation during the day. Starting during the day will help us get a better understanding of our surroundings. It’s also so that we may sweep the area thoroughly. To see if we can find anything out of the ordinary that could tell us what this thing is and why it’s there. The guys seem excited but also determined to help me end this. I feel excited too, but my excitement is to find some answers. I’m not exactly excited to face this thing head-on. Especially not in its own backyard. So much could go wrong. I know I’ll be in a group, but there’s this feeling in my gut that’s telling me not to go. Fear, I guess.\n\nAlso, I don’t know what’s going to happen. The unknown is my worst enemy. Will all of this finally end? Or will it only get worse once we start fighting back? On the other hand, I do feel safer. I have a support system now. My support system seems strong and able. I’m no longer alone and I’m more ready to fight than I’ve ever been. I’m so tired though. This exhaustion has become my fuel to fight. An unexpected transition for sure. I’m just done. But, I’m ready. I have to be.\n\nWeek 3–5: Night 1\n\nTonight’s the night! We’re putting a stop to this demonic attachment crap! I’m going to sleep in my own bed tonight! After all of this insanity is said and done. And I will not be sharing my bed with any uninvited guests anymore. I still woke up with my typical welts and bruises. This time, they weren’t as bad though. The prayers seem to be working their magic. Good magic mind you. The nightmare didn’t occur this time either. Instead, I had a dream about war. It wasn’t super vivid, but the sensation and emotions attached to my dream felt very real and personal. There were battles taking place. Lots of screaming and anger. Specifically, I heard the screams from the woods. I didn’t feel scared or in trouble. I felt victorious and powerful. I felt alive. The screams got louder over time and tried to tear me down. But, it couldn’t. I was able to scream back and prayed right after. Then, there was a blast of white light and I woke up. My heart was pounding and I was sweating pretty badly. But, I didn’t feel helpless or like I was about to be beaten to death. It was different this time. I have no idea why or how, but it was different. A good kind of different.\n\nThe time is 5:15 pm. My friends and I went over the plan one last time. We grabbed our gear, made sure all devices were charged and accounted for, grabbed a bite to eat, and loaded the vehicle. We arrived at the park just a little past 6:00 pm. The guys asked me to show them where I heard the screams and ultimately where my attacks first started.\n\nWe didn’t grab any gear other than some flashlights. For when it got dark. We walked the trail to the spot in question and began to search the surrounding woods. This was the first time I’d been back in about a month. And for the first time in a long time, there was no screaming. There were people there too. There were families having picnics and children playing on the playground. Runners tackling the Abbaduk Trail as I used to. With no worry in the world. There were so many people and I loved that so much. I almost felt like things were back to normal. But, I knew better. They weren’t. Once we arrived at the spot, two of the guys went left off the path into the woods, while I and my other friend took the right side. The plan covered what we were looking for. Anything that shouldn’t be there. These things included clothing, money, bottles, figurines, or any trace of a human being.\n\nThe first step was to rule out any sign of a murder scene. The second step was to rule out any sign of possible witchcraft or ritual activity. And the third step was to respectfully search the area for any signs of burial grounds or lost communities. If any of these scenarios could be ruled out, then it would seem that this thing has been with me a lot longer than originally thought. We searched for hours and came up with nothing. This honestly disappointed me beyond belief. I started to feel depressed, which quickly turned to fear. Not that I wanted anything bad to have happened to someone, but I wanted to find an answer. The answer, to what this thing is and why it’s terrorizing me. Finding the answer seemed to only become more complicated and less likely as time went on.\n\nI’m tired, I’m scared, I’m confused, and I’m lost. What am I going to do? If this thing is connected to a family member from years ago, where do I even start? Do I have enough sanity to keep looking? To keep trying to get rid of this thing? Again, I’m done. I’m just so tired of looking for answers and constantly being attacked by some freak of nature. And for no damn reason. Not a good reason at least. Is this thing natural? Can I even consider it that? No. It’s not. I’m just losing my mind and I don’t know what else to do.\n\nIt’s now 8:15 pm. The guys and I are done searching the grounds. It’s too dark now. Even in the light, we weren’t able to find anything. Maybe the area was cleaned up. Maybe some animals came by and ransacked the area that we were searching. Years before our search today. Either way, it was dark and it was that time of the night. It was time to fight. The trail had become quiet and still. No more people. The four of us had met back in the middle of the trail and sat down in a circle. Back to back. No gear. This part of the plan was to observe the area of interest naturally. Using only our senses. Honestly, we were doing what I did the first two times that I encountered the screams. Nothing. All we did was exist and listen. To my absolute shock, there was no screaming. Absolutely nothing. Some obvious wildlife sounds and nighttime bugs chirping, but nothing unusual or “paranormal.”\n\nThis pissed me off! The one time that I finally had people with me, a support system, and this thing decides not to show up. All of a sudden it doesn’t want to show its ass? No! I don’t think so, it’s going to show. One way or the other. I will make it show itself. I am not leaving tonight without forcing this thing to leave me and go back to where it came from! I’ve been going through hell for far too long and for no good reason. I’m not perfect, but I’m not a killer or some kind of demented narcissist. I live my life and try to not cause any waves in the matrix. This thing has to go. It can’t stay. I have to do something.\n\nTwo whole hours go by and nothing has happened. Something had to be done. So, I did something. I got up from our four-man circle and started calling out to the thing. Challenging it and highlighting what a coward it is. I told it that it’s proven to me that it’s weak. It obviously can’t do what it’s been doing for the past month because of my prayers and the support of my friends. It’s a coward and a weak pathetic creature. I didn’t offer my energy like how some of those “professional” investigators do sometimes. But, I did call it some pretty nasty names. My friends had me binge-watch some reality ghost shows for the past few weeks. A tax to pay for staying at their homes I suppose. It wasn’t terrible. Sometimes they were creepy and at other times they were amusing. But, the real reason for watching was for me to learn some of the basic “Dos and Don’ts” when dealing with the supernatural.\n\nAfter calling the thing out for several minutes, nothing happened. Not exactly what I was expecting. A slight breeze ran down the trail, almost bringing a sign of peace with it. For the first time, I was angry and unnerved by the sheer silence. Something I have been begging for. I almost craved for the screams to come rolling down the trail. Almost prayed for them to come.\n\nThe time was roughly 10:30 pm. Fifteen minutes since my mini meltdown. We decided as a group that two of us should return to the vehicle now and grab the equipment. It was time for us to increase our efforts in search of anything “unnatural.” The other two, with me being one of the two, will stay back and continue to observe the environment without any equipment. Perhaps having fewer people around will provide different results. Maybe the cowardly ghost will show itself finally. This is a common method that paranormal investigators use in the field. Smaller groups. Why it works so well, I have no clue. But, it can be dangerous and result in terrifying results. Maybe the ghostly beings are shy. Perhaps too many humans being in one place at one time blocks their energy. Or limits the extent of their abilities. Just another theory that ghost hunters are seeking a solid answer on.\n\nAs our two friends got further and further away from our initial spot, I felt a change in the air. Like we were being watched or about to be approached by someone. Maybe just being in the dark woods with fewer people around was giving me the heebie-jeebies. Regardless of the reason, I started feeling uneasy for sure. As the other two disappeared around the trail’s bend about 150 ft. away, the show finally began. Almost instantly, rocks and pinecones started pelting me and my friend. Coming out of the thicket to our right. Hitting us in the head and the neck. Whoever or whatever was throwing these objects at us, had perfect aim. Especially for being in the pitch-dark woods with no lights. We jumped up instantly and backed away by at least 15 ft. The objects suddenly stopped being thrown.\n\nThankfully, we had our high-lumen flashlights on us and we flooded the nearby brush. Together, we ran into the brush and out to a clearing that we had found and searched earlier. There was no one around. Not even any animals. At this point, we noticed something odd. All of the natural sounds of the night had stopped. Even the bugs had stopped chirping. It was really weird, now that I come to think about it. As my friend and I searched the area, we noticed a pile of medium-sized rocks and five lines of pinecones neatly placed in the center of the clearing. We had searched this exact area from top to bottom earlier. There was nothing like this here before. We would’ve noticed without a doubt. This was terrifying, and running straight into the woods at night was such a stupid idea. But, at least I wasn’t alone. That helped.\n\nI started walking toward the pile of rocks and the lines of pinecones. I bent down to touch them. Just to inspect them a little further. But, right before I could touch them, the rocks and pinecones blew away before my very eyes. Like there was someone below me scattering everything away in all directions. Making an absolute mess. But, there wasn’t anything below me, and the classic wind theory was out of the window. We were surrounded by brush and there was no wind of any kind. The rocks and the pinecones just flew off the ground in multiple directions. It was horrifying to say the least! Seeing and hearing such a phenomenon happen was not right. It was unnatural. This was for sure unnatural. Yet it was happening. There was nothing physically there to make it happen. The next thing I knew, our flashlights went out. Both of them at the same time. Somehow these brand new batteries died within minutes of being used. It didn’t make sense to me. How? Everything went black. No sounds. No light. No life. Then it happened. The screams. The screams finally returned.\n\nThat shrill blood-curdling scream quickly filled the clearing that we were in. It was zipping around us like there was a surround sound system or something. The way that the sound of the screaming traveled was inhuman. There was no way that a human could move around like that. No way at all! My friend started screaming. I could faintly hear him over the unnatural screams, but I could tell that there was a second scream now. A man’s scream. His screaming was further away than it should have been. Did he try to run away? Am I all alone now? Stuck in the pitch-black woods and surrounded by something evil? I felt hopeless and was petrified! The overwhelming feeling of goosebumps ripping through my body quickly came back. My eyes were full of burning tears. It was terrible. Being attacked and disabled at the same time. I fell to my knees, covered my ears, and started praying. I prayed for forgiveness for when I taunted the “spirit” and I prayed for protection over my friend and me. I kept praying, but I could still hear the screams of that thing raging around me.\n\nAt some point, I felt a cold sharp pain start at my mid-back and slowly crawl up to the back of my neck. It felt sharp, like a knife. It also had a tingling sensation to it, like a low-voltage taser or some kind of electrical instrument. The touch itself didn’t hurt, but the intention felt invasive and threatening. At this point, I freaked out! I screamed out loud, “Get the hell off of me and leave us alone!” “I command you in the name of Jesus Christ! Leave!” Almost instantly, the touch sensation evaporated away, the screaming repelled deep into the woods, and our flashlights started to flicker until becoming a constant ray of light again. It went silent. No more screaming. Thank God.\n\nI found my friend behind me. About 30 ft. away from me. I was shocked to see him that far. How’d he get there? Fear and luck? Panic and instinct? Something didn't seem right. He was lying in the fetal position by a large tree, crying and shaking. I ran over to him and picked him up. I comforted him and told him it was ok now, but that we had to move. We needed to at least get back out on the open trail. This way, we could stand our ground a bit easier and be ready for our friends to return. As I shouldered my friend and we began walking back toward the trail, I noticed he was limping. I also noticed that he had several red slash marks on his neck. Blood was drawn to the surface of his skin, but thankfully no open wounds. I waited until we got back on the trail to ask him what had happened after our lights went out. Once we broke through the tree line, we huddled in the center of the trail and kept our lights on. We consistently flashed the surrounding areas with our lights. Like police officers in a squad car searching for a perp. Everything was still. Everything was silent. A moment to breathe and think. I kept thanking God for that. I turned to my friend and asked what happened to him. He began shaking and rocking in place. He stared off into the woods as he told me what happened, and why he believes it did.\n\nRight after the lights went out, he recalled feeling a similar sharp tingling sensation. Right away. But, the sensation went from his mid-back and down his left leg. Finally, the sensation seemed to wrap around his ankle. He then proceeded to tell me that a tight pressure formed around his ankle and that a sudden twist made him fall on his back. The twist made him yelp in pain. He said that it felt like someone had taken two hammers and smacked both sides of his ankle bone. That they smacked both hammers together at the same time. He said that the pain was so terrible, he believes that he blacked out for a moment. The next thing that he remembers after he came to, was that his left leg was elevated and he was being dragged away from me. He was being dragged off to a nearby tree where he was strung upside down. He swore to me that he was lifted mid-air against that tree. That’s when he began screaming uncontrollably. When I heard him screaming from afar. He said, as he was being suspended upside down, something began to claw at his neck. Over and over and over. Like a cat or a raccoon trying to desperately escape after being cornered. That’s what it felt like to him anyway. What seemed like a lifetime suddenly stopped, and he fell to the ground below the tree. Thankfully, he was not severely hurt during the fall. The next thing he knew, I was picking him up and we were getting out of there.\n\nI couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I was truly thankful that it didn’t get that far with me. Thankfully it didn’t choose to do that to me first. But, I couldn’t help but wonder why. Then he told me why. He said that he was taunting and threatening whatever spirits were around us. Telling them to leave me alone and mess with him instead. He admitted that he went as far as offering up his own energy to whatever was around us. He told it that he was stronger and that it had no control over him. Even with the offering of his spiritual energy. That he was simply more powerful than it was. He also admitted to me, how wrong he was and that he planned on never doing such things again. God willing. I told him that it was ok and that we all have learning curves. We just need to pick a new strategy for when we plan on taking this thing on again. A safer one too.\n\nAbout twenty minutes pass by and our friends finally return with all of our gear. They clearly saw the distraught looks on our faces and asked what had happened. We filled them in on everything. Their response was as expected. Hanging jaws and wide-eyed expressions. They immediately evaluated the area and then us. These were the two friends that were studying demonology. Why we didn’t have one of them stay with us, I have no idea. Lesson learned for sure. Perhaps everything happened the way it was supposed to. So that we’d receive the results that we did. This encounter was needed. Perhaps even planned. By a higher power maybe? But why? It seemed so cruel and dangerous. Maybe there’s a bigger picture to it all that none of us see yet. I don’t know.\n\nAfter checking the area and making sure we were ok, they cleansed us. Something they had not done before, because they didn’t feel ready or confident enough that they could. But, seeing the fear on our faces seemed to have done something to them. It changed them. They became almost like our personal bodyguards. Doing their best to save their friends seemed to become a top priority over everything else. Especially self-criticism. Once we were taken care of, we checked our gear and set everything up in a small circular radius on the trail. These guys have been preparing for a while. Night vision cameras, EMF detectors, DVRs for EVP sessions, traditional battery and laser grid motion detectors, AM/FM radios for high and low-frequency sweeping, and so much more. These guys were ready. Tonight wasn’t just an investigation, it was a fight. A battle. Perhaps that’s what my dream was about. What’s that weird thing called when people have an insight into the future? A premonition!\n\nI’m still on the fence about believing in this stuff, but who knows? These guys were willing to help me get rid of this invisible thing. Whatever it took and however long it takes. I wanted to cry after seeing how devoted and willing they were to help me. I felt like there was hope and that this nightmare was going to end. Suddenly, I didn’t feel forsaken or stuck. As we got everything in place and switched on, we decided that two of us should stay back within the equipment circle, to prevent any theft or outside interference. While the other two go back inside the brush to that clearing. The area that’s been made pretty obvious this thing likes to thrive in. That clearing seems extremely important to this “specter.” I volunteered to go back in with one of our demonologists. I wanted it to be me. It needed to be me. I wanted to be the last thing that this bastard saw before we sent it back to whatever dark hole it crawled out of. Plus, my ankle wasn’t sprained. I also wasn’t as traumatized from the most recent attack. It was only right that I went.\n\nJust as we started to break through the tree line, we heard something in the distance. It was very faint. But, it was growing louder the longer we listened. As the sound got louder, it was clear that it was getting closer. Then I recognized what it was. It was that terrible crashing sound that I heard at the entrance of the park, and it was coming directly toward us. A freight train from hell. Like the screaming, this sound was unnatural. It didn’t sound like a normal train derailing. It was garbled and looping. The longer I listened, it started to sound like a large animal breathing heavily and stampeding in our direction. Whatever it was, it was enough to produce ripples of goosebumps throughout my body again. I started to tear up again too. Just like before. This thing was causing so much discomfort and fear. My body just reacted naturally to this unnatural thing. It was insane. It wasn’t right. Stuff like this isn’t supposed to be real.\n\nMy torment seems to be endless at this point. And I’ve managed to bring three poor souls along with me. They didn’t deserve this any more than I did. They didn’t deserve this at all. They’re just good people trying to help someone in need. Clearly, this thing didn’t care. It simply added them to the list. Whether we were ready or not, shit was about to get real. And it was about to get a lot worse. Worse than any of us could have ever imagined.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Screams: Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10odu8q/screams_part_1/)",

        "text": "My husband, Lawrence, is a food critic for a respected publication. It's ironic that he would end up with someone like me; I'm a terrible cook. I could butcher cheese on toast! But fortunately that wasn't a deal breaker for him. We've been happily married for almost 20 years.\n\nLawrence came home from reviewing a new Balkan restaurant a couple of nights ago. I was sitting in the armchair reading by the fireplace. Our cat, Dibble, jumped down from my lap to greet him.\n\n\"Penny, I'm home darling,\" he called from the hallway.\n\n\"In here,\" I called back, finishing off the chapter I'd started. He kissed my cheek and I removed my reading glasses, folding the corner of my current page down.\n\n\"How was it, love?\" I asked as he sat on the sofa. Dibble curled up on his lap. Whenever Lawrence was home, Dibble rarely paid me any interest. He was definitely a daddy's boy.\n\n\"You'd never believe me, Penny, \" he said, briefly covering his face with his hands before laughing.\n\n\"Oh dear. Was it terrible?\" I asked, starting to chuckle.\n\n\"It's not that,\" he said. \"It was mostly enjoyable, however the main course just wasn't *quite* there. The head chef joined me when I'd finished, asked how I found the food. Rayko, his name. *Huge* Bulgarian guy, built like a brick shithouse! I was honest. I wasn't rude, I didn't completely berate his work. But he was visibly hurt. And then he looked angry.\"\n\n\"Oh, Lawrence,\" I said. \"Have you made yourself another enemy?\" He had a habit of upsetting chefs. He was a dream to me, but not always so kind to those he critiqued.\n\n\"Well…\" he continued, looking confused. \"Not exactly. I started to feel uncomfortable. I mean, he towered over me. For a moment I thought he was going to break my nose! But then his face warmed up. *'No problem'* he says, then he shouts something in Bulgarian. Someone comes out from the kitchen and puts this bottle on the table. It's got some kind of vivid green liquid in it.\"\n\n\"Absinthe?\" I asked.\n\n\"No, but that's exactly what I thought too! There's no way I'm drinking that shit. So Rayko says *'From my country. We drink'*. He pours two shots. And, you know, I don't want to piss him off any more than I already have. So I picked up a glass. It's iridescent, like a tiny little galaxy. Quite beautiful really. He looks at me with this intensity, and I get goosebumps. Then he says something else in Bulgarian, like under his breath. He clinks my glass, and we downs the shots.\"\n\n\"What did it taste like?\" I asked.\n\n\"Sweet and syrupy, a bitter edge, but not unpleasant. Quite delicious actually. Then Rayko shouts something else, making me jump. Another person brings out this bowl and puts it in front of me. *'You have dessert now'* he says. Penny, it looked gross.\"\n\nI covered my mouth and laughed. \"Oh no! What was it?\"\n\n\"I couldn't tell you. It was just a beige stodgy substance, as appealing as wallpaper paste! So I'm trying to be polite, lie a little and say I'm not really one for sweets. Rayko says *'You eat. You enjoy, you give good review, yes?'* All I could do was laugh. I'm like *'Sure, buddy. I'll leave you a glowing review if I enjoy this slop'*. So I stir it, and I bring a little to my nose and smell it. Penny…\"\n\n\"Was it vile?\" I asked, scrunching up my face.\n\nHe shook his head. \"No. It smelled wonderful, and nostalgic. It was just like my nana's homemade apple crumble.\"\n\n\"How bizarre,\" I said. \"And the taste?\"\n\n\"It was one of the most beautiful things I've ever tasted, Penny. I devoured the whole thing like an animal. I totally forgot my surroundings. When my head was present again, the other diners were staring at me like I was crazy.\"\n\nI shook my head in disbelief. \"Perhaps there was something in that drink? Some kind of, I don't know, hallucinogen?\"\n\n\"Hmm,\" he frowned. \"I mean, Rayko was a somewhat eccentric man. It's possible I guess. I have no other explanation. But now I owe him a positive review.\"\n\nLawrence stood up, picking up Dibble and putting him on the floor. \"I know it's early but I feel exhausted,\" he said. \"I'm going to bed.\"\n\nIt was just after 9. I nodded. \"It sounds like you could do with an early night, love. I'll read a few more chapters and then join you.\"\n\nHe gave me a kiss and looked down at Dibble. \"You stay and keep mummy company.\"\n\nWhen he retired, Dibble jumped back on my lap. \"Oh, so you want me now daddy's gone?\" He looked at me with half closed eyes as he purred. I scratched the top of his head. \"It's a good job you're so cute.\"\n\nI read a few more chapters of my book; a reread of *Winter's Bone* which is one of my favourites, and a perfect read by an open fire. As the flames became embers, I put Dibble in his bed and switched off the lights.\n\nLawrence was sound asleep when I went to our en suite to brush my teeth. However, I couldn't find the toothpaste. I could have sworn we had at least half a tube that morning. I looked everywhere, not that there were many places to look in the small bathroom. There was a small glob of ocean-blue paste in the sink, so it looked like Lawrence must have brushed his teeth. I didn't dwell on it, settling for mouthwash.\n\nThe next morning when I woke up, Lawrence was still sound asleep. I headed downstairs, greeted by Dibble who wove between my legs. I put a scoop of his dry food in a bowl and made coffee for myself.\n\nAfter reading a little more, I heard Lawrence get up and go to our small spare room, which was his makeshift office. I went back to the kitchen and started to fry some bacon, then made Lawrence a mug of coffee which I took upstairs. I knocked on the door, then entered.\n\n\"Morning, love,\" I said, putting the coffee on his desk and kissing his cheek. He was in his swivel chair writing on his laptop.\n\n\"Good morning, honey. Thank you.\"\n\n\"Are you making a start on the magic dessert review?\" I chuckled, wrapping my arms around his chest.\n\n\"I am,\" he said. \"I have to say, it's reading like poetry. It could be one of the best reviews I've written.\"\n\n\"Don't be *too* kind,\" I said, kissing the top of his head. \"He might have drugged you.\"\n\nHe laughed and patted my arms. \"I'll keep that in mind.\"\n\n\"I'm making myself a bacon sandwich. Would you like one?\"\n\n\"I'm not hungry right now, darling. But thank you.\"\n\n\"If you're sure?\" I said, and turned to leave. Then I stopped in the doorway. \"Oh, by the way. What happened to the toothpaste?\"\n\nThere was a slight pause before he answered me. \"The toothpaste?\"\n\n\"I couldn't find it when I came to bed last night. It was definitely there yesterday morning.\"\n\nHe swivelled around, then slapped a hand against his head. \"Oh, yes. I bloody dropped it down the loo! I fished it out and threw it away. Don't worry, I scrubbed my hands clean!\"\n\nI smiled. \"You clumsy fool. I'll add it to the shopping list. At least we have mouthwash for the time being.\"\n\nI went back to the kitchen to finish my sandwich. In true Penny style, the bacon was burnt to a crisp, and the kitchen was a little smoky. I started to add ketchup when I heard Lawrence bounding down the stairs, then he emerged in the kitchen doorway.\n\n\"Honey,\" he said, breathing heavily. \"What coffee was that?\"\n\nI was a little confused. \"Just the usual Nescafé, why?\"\n\nI finished making my sandwich, pressing another slice of buttered bread on top of the crispy bacon.\n\n\"It was…\" He just stared at me. \"It was just like the coffee we had in Florence. Remember that café we fell in love with?\"\n\nI smiled as I began to cut the sandwich in half. \"I remember it well. But it's just standard instant coffee, love. Maybe I stirred it differently today.\"\n\nHe continued to stare as I picked up the plate, his mouth ajar.\n\n\"That smells incredible,\" he said, his eyes wide.\n\nI laughed. \"Stop it, you. Even Dibble would turn down my bacon and you know it.\"\n\n\"I'm serious,\" he said, salivating. \"I… I've changed my mind!\" He rushed towards me, pulling the plate from my hands. He bit into the sandwich and... growled.\n\n\"Lawrence!\" I said, annoyed. It was like he couldn't hear me. Grease dribbled down his chin and t-shirt as he noisily devoured it.\n\n\"I could have made you one,\" I said, but he wasn't listening.\n\n\"Oh, fuck!\" he moaned, his eyes rolled back into his head. It was very unsettling. I slowly backed away and took the shopping list, stuck to the fridge with a magnet. I jotted down *toothpaste* then crept past Lawrence, who was still infatuated with the sandwich.\n\n\"It's fine,\" I said. \"I'll grab something when I'm out shopping.\" I took my bag and left the house, feeling slightly unnerved.\n\nWhen I finished the food shop, I stopped at Greggs for a bacon roll before heading home. I took two bags from the car and entered the house, walking down the hall towards the kitchen.\n\n\"Lawrence,\" I called. \"Will you help me with the bags please? I somehow bought more than…\"\n\nAs I entered the kitchen, I dropped the bags and let out a gasp, covering my mouth with both hands. \"Lawrence… What have you done?\"\n\nHe was slumped against one of the cupboards, surrounded by several empty tins of cat food. His shirt was covered in slimy meat and jelly, as was his face. Dibble sat on his lap, licking it up. When Lawrence met my eyes, he looked ashamed. He attempted to wipe his mouth clean with the back of his arm.\n\n\"Darling,\" he said. \"I think I need help.\"\n\nAs Lawrence showered I cleaned up the kitchen, concerned but grossed out. I was convinced it was Rayko who was responsible for my husband's behaviour, so I insisted that we pay a visit to the restaurant. He sat in the passenger seat, looking disorientated as I drove into the city.\n\n\"I couldn't help myself,\" he said quietly. \"The taste… Penny, it was beautiful. Even better than the Michelin rated dishes I've tried.\"\n\nI gave him a worried look.\n\n\"And I lied. I ate the toothpaste.\" I tried not to act shocked as he looked at me sheepishly. \"It's like everything I eat tastes better than the last.\"\n\nI patted his leg quickly. \"I'm telling you. He gave you something. That's the only explanation.\"\n\nWhen we got to the restaurant it was closed. I knocked on the door regardless, looking through the windows.\n\n\"I can see people in there,\" I said. \"Hello? I can see you! Open up!\" I continued to bang on the door. Lawrence leant against the building, looking uncomfortable. Eventually a member of staff opened the door.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" said the young woman, annoyed. \"We're closed until this evening.\"\n\n\"I don't care,\" I shouted. \"I want to speak to the chef. He's done… something to my husband!\"\n\nLawrence put his hand on my shoulder and looked at the woman with puppy dog eyes. \"Please, is chef Rayko here? I really need to talk to him.\"\n\n\"Let them in,\" came a loud voice from inside. I supported Lawrence as we entered the restaurant. There was the faint smell of food preparation.\n\n\"Sit,\" said Rayko, who was a hulk of a man as Lawrence described. I helped him onto a chair and let it all out.\n\n\"What did you do to my husband? Look at him! He was fine before he came here!\"\n\n\"Calm down, lady,\" said Rayko, holding up his hands.\n\n\"Don't you *calm down lady* me you son-of-a-bitch!\"\n\n\"Honey,\" said Lawrence, a little feeble. \"Please, sit down.\"\n\nI angrily pulled out a chair and sat, giving Rayko daggers. He sat on the opposite side of the table, hands together.\n\n\"Hello again, chef,\" said Lawrence. \"I wrote your five-star review. One of my finest, if I may say so. Not sure I should turn it in just yet though. I'm having some unusual side effects.\"\n\n\"He ate cat food,\" I spat. \"And toothpaste for Christ's sake!\"\n\nLawrence squeezed my leg. \"I did. My stomach feels like it can't take anymore. And yet right now, all I want to do is crawl into the kitchen and eat whatever that is I can smell. Can you explain that to me, chef?\"\n\nRayko nodded. \"I say special words, give special drink. You like what you eat.\"\n\n\"I knew it,\" I shouted, banging on the table. Despite his imposing size, Rayko flinched. \"You have no right to do this to people. Take it back!\"\n\nLawrence took my hand. \"What do you say, chef? Can you take it back? No hard feelings, of course.\"\n\nRayko nodded. \"It's not for always. It's one day.\" He held up a single finger to reiterate.\n\nLawrence perked up a little. \"You mean, like a 24 hour thing?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Rayko. \"24 hour thing. Tonight, you feel better.\"\n\nLawrence tilted his head back and sighed with relief. \"Oh, that's good news. Isn't it honey?\"\n\n\"The best,\" I said sarcastically, helping Lawrence up. \"Let's get you out of here.\"\n\nAs we went to leave, Rayko called from behind. \"Sorry. Food mean world to me, you understand?\"\n\nLawrence turned and nodded. \"I understand. It means the world to me, too. Good luck with your restaurant.\"\n\nOn the drive home, Lawrence looked like he was in better spirits.\n\n\"We should still press charges,\" I said. \"He can't get away with that.\"\n\n\"I'd rather just forget about it, darling,\" he said. \"The reality is I ate some cat food. I'll get over it.\"\n\n\"And toothpaste,\" I added.\n\n\"Yes, and toothpaste. But remember, I've eaten worse. I've eaten your spag bol.\"\n\nI laughed and slapped his leg. \"You cheeky sod! But yes, that's probably worse.\"\n\nWhen we got home, Lawrence laid down on the couch.\n\n\"Roughly what time did he give you that drink?\" I asked.\n\n\"I was home around 9ish, wasn't I?\" he asked. \"I'd say it was no more than an hour or two before then. Say 8 to be safe.\"\n\n\"Okay, so we need to get you past 8 o'clock with no more… issues. I'm not going to Pilates tonight, I'll stay here with you.\"\n\n\"No, Penny,\" he said. \"I'll be fine, promise. I won't leave this room. I'll probably just put on a movie and sleep to be honest.\"\n\n\"I'm not leaving you and that's the end of it,\" I said.\n\nHe smiled. \"Give me a kiss.\"\n\nI scrunched up my nose. \"I would, but all I can think about is that darn cat food.\"\n\n\"Hey, don't knock it 'til you try it! I particularly recommend the chicken and liver variety.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you can joke about it, sweetheart,\" I said, kissing his cheek.\n\n\"Who says I'm joking?\" he grinned.\n\nDibble made an appearance and jumped up on the couch, curling up to Lawrence. We chatted for a while until he drifted off to sleep. I lit the fire, then went to the kitchen. Despite the day's events I was starving!\n\nI decided not to cook anything, not wanting to fill the house with any tempting smells. So I started to make the second sandwich of the day, but with just a simple cheese and coleslaw filling. As I began to slice the cheddar I cut my finger. Not too deep, but it drew blood.\n\n\"Dammit!\" I yelled out, then pulled off some kitchen paper to wrap around it. I started to look through our kitchen drawer of oddments, grabbing the box of plasters amongst the batteries, hex keys, and paracetamol.\n\n\"Are you alright, honey?\" said Lawrence in the doorway. He startled me.\n\n\"I'm fine, love,\" I said. \"I just nicked my finger. You go back and lay down.\"\n\nHe stood motionless, just staring at me.\n\n\"Lawrence, go lay down. I'll be right back in.\"\n\nHe walked over to me. \"Let me help you, Penny.\"\n\n\"Honestly, it's fine,\" I said. \"Just a little scratch.\" I turned to look at the bread and cheese on the counter. *’There goes my sandwich again’* I thought to myself, though he didn’t seem to notice. He unwrapped the kitchen roll and looked at my finger.\n\n\"You poor thing,\" he said, bringing my hand towards his mouth and kissing it. Then he squeezed my finger, a bubble of blood emerging from the cut.\n\n\"Lawrence,\" I said, pulling away. \"That hurt!\"\n\n\"Sorry, darling,\" he said, pulling me back. \"I’ll make it better.\" His eyes glazed over, then he put my finger in his mouth and started to suckle.\n\n\"Lawrence, stop it!\" I yelled, but he held my hand in place. He started to make pleasurable sounds. I struggled to pull away.\n\n\"Let me go!\" I snapped, kicking out. My foot met his shin and he let go of my hand, wincing as he stepped back. I clutched my chest as I stared at him in shock. When he looked up, he didn't meet my eyes once. He just stared at my hand with a look of intense desire. Then he pounced.\n\nI fell onto the tiled floor as I gasped. He crawled on top of me and prised my hand from my chest, biting down on my finger with a *crunch!*\n\n\"Lawrence!\" I screamed as I felt his teeth tear through the skin. His eyes rolled back like he was possessed. I struggled under his weight.\n\n\"Help me!\" I yelled, knowing full well no one would come to my aid. We lived in a detached house on a secluded country road. I slapped and punched at him with my free hand as he began to chew on my finger. The pain was excruciating.\n\nI heard a high-pitched yowl and Lawrence let me go, roaring into the kitchen. Blood and saliva ran down his chin. Dibble was nearby, hissing.\n\n\"Stay out of this, Dibble,\" Lawrence screamed over his shoulder. \"You'd do the same if you knew how good mummy tastes!”\n\nAs he turned back I forced my knee hard into his crotch. He yelled and rolled off me, holding his hands between his legs. I scurried up, slipping on the tiles a little. I should have run for the front door, but our downstairs bathroom was closer.\n\n\"Come on Dibble,\" I said frantically, but he'd already run out of sight. I briefly turned to see Lawrence stand up. I slammed the bathroom door shut and locked it, retreating to the corner and dropping to the floor by the toilet.\n\n\"Penny!\" came a yell from outside, the door vibrating as Lawrence pounded against it. I pressed my hands against my ears. \"I need it, Penny!\"\n\nA crack emerged as it sounded like a heavy object was being forced into the door. It started to splinter.\n\n\"Leave me alone!\" I screamed as the crack got bigger, the sound of splintering wood shredded my nerves.\n\n\"Just a little more, darling,\" he yelled, continuing to smash in the door. \"You taste exquisite!\"\n\nI heard Dibble hiss again.\n\n“Come here, you little fucker!” he yelled as things crashed in the hallway. After a short while Dibble let out what sounded like a painful yowl.\n\n“Don’t you touch him, Lawrence!” I screamed, banging on the wall. But it became eerily quiet.\n\nI assessed the damage to my finger. I wasn't too precious about my nails, though I did treat myself to a French manicure on the odd occasion. I'd be lucky if I didn't lose the nail on that finger. It was split down the middle, and the skin was broken in several places. I gagged a little, moving my head over the toilet bowl. But I managed to stop myself from vomiting.\n\nI pulled the hand towel from the rail by the sink and wrapped it around my hand. I heard Lawrence's footsteps walk past the door back to the kitchen, making me freeze momentarily.\n\n\"Mmm, that's good,\" he said, then I could hear the sound of cupboards closing  before he came back again.\n\nI sat in the corner for a while until I eventually checked my watch. It was past 8, and I hadn't heard any noise for several minutes. So I slowly stood up and put my ear against the door. I couldn't hear anything.\n\n\"Lawrence?\" I said quietly as I pushed the door open, looking both ways down the hall. There were little spots of blood on the wooden floor, which seemed to disappear into the living room. I held my hand against my chest and crept down the hall, peeking inside. Lawrence sat in front of the fireplace with his back to me.\n\n\"Lawrence,\" I trembled. \"Are you alright?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Penny,\" said Lawrence, like a zombie. \"Did I hurt you?\"\n\n\"I’ll be fine, my love,\" I said, trying to sound calm. My skin crawled when I noticed a clump of fur in a small pool of blood. \"Where's Dibble?\"\n\n\"He smelt so good,\" he said. \"Like, imagine all the best dishes you've ever eaten in your life. But double it. Imagine how beautiful the aromas would be.\"\n\nI crept closer, my hands shaking as I followed the spots of blood. \"Where is he, Lawrence?\"\n\nHe continued, monotone. \"Poor Dibble. I tried, Penny. I really tried. But the smell… It changed me. So I bit him. Hard.\"\n\nI shook my head as tears began to fall. \"No… Please tell me you didn't…\"\n\n\"I wanted to,\" he said. \"And I would have. But he scratched me badly.\"\n\nI heard a noise from the corner of the room and saw two glowing eyes reflecting the firelight. It was Dibble, cowering.\n\n\"Oh, thank God,\" I said, picking him up and holding him tight against me. His body trembled. As I patted him, he hissed when I felt near his tail. A few inches of the tip were missing, leaving an open wound.\n\n\"Dibble, you poor thing,\" I said, kissing his head.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Dibble,\" said Lawrence, vacant. \"Sorry Penny. I thought I was stronger than that.\"\n\n\"It's okay,\" I said, crying. \"It could have been… worse. He's still with us. And he'll forgive you. He loves you. God knows, he loves you more than he loves me. And look… It's past 8. That means it's over!\"\n\nHe let out a single laugh. \"Yes, it's over. But it wasn't over soon enough.\"\n\nAs I crept even closer I noticed something else. \"What's that smell?\"\n\n\"The scratches,\" he said. \"They were deep. There was something about fresh blood that was just *so* intoxicating. So I licked my wounds. And I was in another world, Penny. It was incredible. Then I thought, *Imagine if that was seasoned and served hot?*\"\n\nI noticed some small jars and bottles sitting by the fireplace: *Garlic oil, oregano, cumin, salt, cayenne pepper…*\n\n\"Lawrence…\" I whispered.\n\n\"Call an ambulance, honey,\" he said, turning to me as I gasped in terror.\n\nHis right hand was charred, and missing chunks of flesh. Two of his fingers were stripped to the bone. Tears dampened his cheeks but he smiled, his lips and teeth smeared with deep red.\n\n\"In hindsight I regret my actions. But I was the *best* thing I ever tasted.\"\n\n[dd](https://www.reddit.com/user/disco-dingus/comments/10f0v6u/all_my_stories_compiled_into_one_sooperdooper_post/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[OD](https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/)",

I heard people screaming from the woods and I went towards them.\n\n\nNothing. Nothing was there I looked around and only saw trees. I shone my torch over to a tree where I heard sounds. Hanging there attached to the tree was a body of a teenaged girl without eyes.\n\n\nBlood dripping out of the socket, I frantically backed away until I heard the chittering again.\nThat is when I saw it... The look-see-no it was pale and tall with no eyes scratches on its face and a giant toothy grin with blood dripping out of its mouth.\nMy reactions made me shoot my shotgun but that didn't kill it, it just got angered.\n\n\nI ran away as fast as I could I got to the city and it stopped growls at me and walked away. I immediately went to the police and led them to the body but they didn't believe me and said it was just an attempt at suicide.\n\n\nIt didn't make sense why would someone gouge their eyes out for suicide? The next day I went tV the same spot where the girls died and did a ritual I found on the internet, this was my biggest mistake\n\n\nThe look-see-no was right there in front of me and I realised I was screwed. The look-see-no does not see it smells, it finds you and I ran.\n\n\nIt was following me I could hear it breathing. I ran to the basement where I am currently righting this, I hear it breathing it is near it is searching for me It Is Hungry.\n\n\nI just found the shotgun I don’t know where it is but it is near.\n\n\nThis is the story of the look-see-no this diary was found next to a dead and bloody body but we now know that this isn’t the only one there are more that are hungry for blood.\n\n\nI will kill it I will find it I will end this!\nTonight I’m leaving, finding where it is, killing it.

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always thought of mice as dumb animals that are driven by their basic instincts, eat, sleep, multiply. I know that they can be trained to do tricks and are good at problem solving like finding their way out of a maze, but in human terms there is no comparison. Or so I thought.\n\nAbout a month ago I started hearing scratching on the ceiling over my bed, I knew straight away it was a mouse what else could it be. It didn’t really bother me, but if my wife was alive, she would have lost it, she was terrified of the things. I can imagine her now wrapped around me warning me to get rid of it. Then she would have made me spend the rest of the night in the attic tearing up floorboards until I found it. She was very demanding like that, weirdly that is one of the things I miss the most about her.\n\nAt around the same time every night the scratching started, but I just ignored it, even when a small hole appeared directly over my head. I just shoved a sock in it and told myself I'd fix it later, which I still haven’t gotten around to. Eventually the scratching stopped, and for a while I thought the mouse was gone, until one night when I was sitting at the table working on my computer, like I did most nights, I saw something crawl out from underneath the kitchen door. When I saw it was the mouse, I jumped back on my chair and screamed a little bit, I wasn’t afraid, it just startled me. \n\nSurprisingly with all that noise the mouse didn’t run away, it just stood there in the middle of the floor with an odd look in its eye, it didn’t even look scared of me. I wasn’t sure what to do, I didn’t want to hurt the poor little thing, but I couldn’t have it in my house either. So, I slowly backed up against the wall and made my way around to the back door, the whole time the mouse just stood there watching me. Then I opened the door and made my way back around so that I could try chase him out to the back yard.\n\nSuddenly I ran towards it, but it didn’t move, it just stood there with that weird look in its eye, it wasn’t until I stamped my feet before it finally ran behind the cabinet under the sink. As quick as I could I blocked off all exits with whatever I could find around the house so it couldn’t escape. The next day I bought a half dozen mouse traps and laid them down outside the only place it could escape.\n\nThere was only one way in and one way out, so I was sure I’d have him caught by the end of the day, but it didn’t come out. Again, the next day there was no sign of it. After a while I begin to believe that he was gone, maybe I scared him to death, I thought, or it could have found a way outside and was too frightened to come back.\n\nThen one night I heard a loud clap coming from the mouse trap, then another. I turned around just in time to see the mouse leap over the third trap like a gymnast. It was now standing beside me less than two feet away, again it just stood there fearlessly staring up at me, it was like it was waiting to see how I would react.\n\nI tried shooing it, but it wouldn’t budge. So, l leaned in for a closer look, suddenly it threw me the strangest look, I know you won’t believe me, but I could swear it smiled at me. I got such a fright that I screamed like I little girl, and it ran under the fridge.\n\nAs fast as I could, I blocked every exit in the whole kitchen, apart from the one where I set the traps this time in a way that I believed would be impossible for him not to get caught. When I was done, I grabbed the sweeping brush and waited for it to come out, which didn’t take very long. It was like it had a death wish, it just casually popped out and started walking towards me, before it got too close, I swung the brush just missing its head, and it ran away. I spent about 5 minutes chasing it around the kitchen before it finally ran toward the traps.\n\nOne by one it pounced, setting off the traps as it went, then safely ran into the hole. I couldn’t believe it, I was beaten by a mouse. But I didn’t give up, every night I would come up with a new way of outsmarting it, but I couldn’t, the mouse was a fucking genius. However, frustrating it was I couldn’t help but respect the thing, I didn’t know whether to catch it or throw it a parade.\n\nThe longer this went on the more I started to enjoy it, and I wasn’t the only one, the mouse seemed to get something out of it too or why would it keep coming to me every night like it did. Before I knew it, I felt back to my old self, I had a sense of purpose that I had not felt in a long time. I half didn’t want to catch the thing because I didn’t want it to end.\n\nBut as much as I liked having that mouse around, there was one thing I loved more. I used to keep a photo of my wife on the window beside the fridge, it was taken the summer before she got sick. I don’t know why l liked that photo so much, it was just a normal day when I took it. We were just out walking at the beach near our home, and she looked happy, so I took a photo. But every time I looked at that photo it took me back to a time when things weren’t so... broken.\n\nIt must have been 3am and I had just finished the project I was working on, and was about to save it, when I heard the little patter of tiny footsteps on the countertop. Out of the corner of my eye I saw the mouse nibbling on the crumbs that were left over from when I made a sandwich. I pretended that I couldn’t see him and kept tapping away at random keys on the computer, every now and then I'd glance over to see what it was up to. Usually, the mouse didn’t take it’s eyes off me the whole time, but this time it seemed distracted.\n\nSo carefully I grabbed a towel from the chair beside me as the mouse climbed on to the windowsill. It sniffed around for a while, then looked over at me for a moment, and scuttled behind the radio. That’s when I got my chance and I quickly pushed out my chair and ran to the window, which made a lot of noise, so, I knew it heard me.\n\n“Now I got you, you little shit” I giggle to myself as I tried clearing the area of anything that he could hide behind.\n\nSuddenly it shot out across the windowsill and hid behind the rainbow cactus, I quickly tried to push it out of my way, but instead it fell, and I instinctively tried to grab it. Which was a bad idea, both my hands were covered with spines, and the mouse escaped out of sight.\n\nOne by one I pull out the spines, loudly coursing the mouse with every prick, but as I was taking out the last one, the mouse suddenly popped out from behind my wife's photo. Without thinking I grabbed the towel from the countertop and flicked it towards the mouse, knocking both the mouse and the photo of my wife onto the floor, shattering the frame into little pieces.\n\nWhen I looked down, I saw the mouse standing in the middle of the rubble, staring up at me with it’s mouth open. Suddenly I felt myself fill with rage and I slowly lifted my leg as I prepared to crush him, instead of running away, it just stands there, eyes clutched tight, bracing itself. I couldn’t do it, there was just something about it that made my heart melt, so I tried to pull my leg away but slipped on the broken glass and fell. Then I heard a loud squeak and when I turned around, I saw the mouse limping under the sink, again setting off the traps as it went.\n\nI started to feel bad for the poor thing I didn’t want to kill it, I just wanted it out of the house, so the next day I decided to rib out the timber at the bottom of the counter to check on it. Right in the corner on top of one of my old socks I found it, it must have passed away in the night. This is the weird thing, scratched into the wall over it was the word, “shrimpy” that was a nickname my wife had for me, it was what I ordered on our first date, she said my breath stink for the rest of the night and ever since she said I was her little shrimpy.\n\nI know that it could have been written by my wife years before, or even by the people that lived there before us, but what if it was my wife trying to help me through a bad time and I killed her",

        "text": "\n\nI always thought of mice as dumb animals that are driven by their basic instincts, eat, sleep, multiply. I know that they can be trained to do tricks and are good at problem solving like finding their way out of a maze, but in human terms there is no comparison. Or so I thought.\n\nAbout a month ago I started hearing scratching on the ceiling over my bed, I knew straight away it was a mouse what else could it be. It didn’t really bother me, but if my wife was alive, she would have lost it, she was terrified of the things. I can imagine her now wrapped around me warning me to get rid of it. Then she would have made me spend the rest of the night in the attic tearing up floorboards until I found it. She was very demanding like that, weirdly that is one of the things I miss the most about her.\n\nAt around the same time every night the scratching started, but I just ignored it, even when a small hole appeared directly over my head.

        "text": "Many people ask me why I love Berlin so much. And they rarely understand my answer: It's the way the city is alive.\n\nFor one, Berlin is a pretty green city, you know? Even many of the big and busy streets are lined with trees, and pools of green parks sprawl out amidst the buildings. Sometimes the life seems ugly - like the rats teeming across subway tracks or pigeons shitting from a bus stop's roof. But I am in love with it when the foxes scream at night and the cats howl during their hunts and fights. It makes me smile when the starlings and sparrows hop around me as I sit down on a bench, eagerly beeping to beg for food, and I happily tug some bits off my sandwich to toss among them.\n\nBut I think my favorite may be the crows. Even as a child, I found it hypnotising when their murders swarmed across the skies. It always felt like I could almost, *almost* recognise something in the shapes or their flight. Something significant. Something magical.\n\nI own no pets, but I buy cat treats every day. The good ones, too. All so I can seize the opportunities when the crows land on the lamp posts around me, tilting their heads so that their eyes, little black pearls among their feathers, can get a better look at me.\n\nI like to step back a little then, get out the treat bags, and throw a few.\n\"Treats!\" I offer in a high pitched voice.\n\nAnd without fail, a few brave crows flutter down to peck at my little offerings. It's a delight, really! Watching them hop around, gathering the little morsels. They seem so thankful, and so am I!\n\n\"Good birdies~!\" I coo, squatting down as I toss more and more food to them. It almost hurts my heart when the bags are empty and I have to announce it with a sad \"All gone! All gone!\" to my feathery friends.\n\nAt first, that was when they took off again. No doubt to bring any surplus to their families and stashes for later. It always left me feeling a bit sad and empty to be abandoned so soon.\n\nBut now, this doesn't deter them anymore. They often still hop after me a little, cawing and fluttering at me. It makes me laugh and I always answer them like it's a conversation. I like the idea that they are telling me about their day.\n\nMy favorite are a pair I like to call Huginn and Muninn. Yes, yes, those are actually ravens - so sue me.\n\nHuginn and Muninn are the bravest among their murder. They happily come so close that I could touch them if I really wanted to. I never do though - I don't know if they'd be fine with it and you know, wild animals are still wild animals. The crows and I, we appreciate each other. But I am aware that there is an invisible border between me, a human, and the wildlife of Berlin. The crows are not pets, they are not for petting.\n\nI cross the border to bring them food. And they welcome me on their side as a respectful guest. But eventually, I have a duty to leave again and return to my apartment, to the domestic world within the buildings.\n\nAnd that's okay. My love is not arrogant. I don't feel entitled to the hearts of crows.\n\nIt makes me all the more excited and happy when those two come so close, sometimes even ignoring the treats to gently caw at me. Their brethren are grey like the cloudy, misty days of autumn, safe for their black heads and wings. But Huginn and Muninn are black like the light-polluted sky at night.\n\nFor all the love I have for my surroundings, I don't have much for myself. My body, at times, feels unfitting like a suit in the wrong size. But many of my insecurities melt away when the crows look at me and I realize that in their eyes, I am no more or less unsightly than any other human. It's nice.\n\nI think the reason many people don't understand this is because to them, I'm not even remotely as social and open as I am towards the animals and plants. That's okay though. They don't need to understand as long as they are nice to me, which most of them are. I don't really have many friends, but I am treated cordially by my co-workers at the grocery store, and even by most of the customers. That's all I need. They even let me take the late shifts I prefer!\n\nMy workplace tends to be open until 11pm, which means that we typically wrap up all end-of-day stuff around midnight. So I have a whole hour of counting and tidying to get excited for my evening routine! And then I grab the treats I bought on my break and get to wander home through the nightly streets, while the city is dozing. Sometimes I take the night bus, but construction sites have a habit of popping up along my route like mushrooms. And I'm not always in the mood for the long detours or additional stops to switch busses. Especially when walking through the nightly city is so wonderful.\n\nIt never fully falls asleep, but on work nights it can get quiet enough for the cats and foxes to come out. I beam whenever I see one of them dart across a silent street in front of me, and sometimes they even stop and look at me! It's strange how in those late hours, when the world is streetlightorange and nightblack, the city feels the most alive to me. I sometimes almost think I can feel it breathe beneath my feet, its chest rising and falling ever so slowly as it dreams of faraway ambulance sirens and the occasional laughter from a dark window.\n\nSo when I walk home one autumn night and hear nothing, it gives me pause. My steps slow until I stand still, cocking my head to listen.\n\nThere is no distant rumble of cars and trains tonight. No fox screams, no cat hisses. As I raise my eyes and look around, all windows are dark, the only light around coming from the street lamps. They do not buzz as they usually do, and no moths dance around them.\n\nI shudder and pull my hoodie closer around me. But there is no wind. The trees and shrubs of my street are still, each leaf perfectly motionless. I can't help but imagine them holding their breath to escape the notice of something.\n\nWhen I hear the murder caw, it makes me wince at first. But I feel relief spreading through my chest when I see the crows flutter down onto the branches and streetlamps around me. They are familiar faces, and the suffocating isolation I felt a moment ago is easily broken by the flutter of their wings. I don't even think about the unusual time for their outing as I excitedly dig in my messenger bag and produce the little strips of meat I bought for them today.\n\n\"Treats!\" I offer, happily ripping open the bag. The rustle of the plastic feels strangely loud in the night, as does my voice. But I am too happy still - I pull out some meat bits and toss them onto the sidewalk for my friends.\n\nFor some reason, it seems to unsettle the crows. Some of them caw at me, strangely muted tonight. Huginn and Muninn flutter down to the roof of a parked car and motion at me with their wings and head. I am deeply confused that they ignore the food so completely.\n\n\"What's wrong? Treats!\" I say, throwing some more strips of meat their way. At first I smile when one of them flies off the car - but then I notice with horror that he doesn't aim for the treats on the pavement, but for me.\n\nI yelp as Muninn swishes past me so closely that I can feel his claws cut the air above my head. And I stumble back a few steps, dropping the bag and trembling as my brain tries to process the profound betrayal. I thought we were… well, not friends, maybe. Friends are a domestic thing.\n\nBut I thought I was a welcome guest. And now, instead, each caw and flutter makes me feel like I am unwanted here.\n\nI don't have much time to dwell on this, because the noise around me abruptly ceases and all bird heads turn so their beaks point at the same point somewhere above us. A discordant scratching sound is all that remains, and I feel as if someone is slowly trickling ice water down my nape as I, too, turn to face the noise.\n\nA black, needle-like limb slowly creeps around the corner of a building, on the height of the third floor just about. As it somehow finds purchase on the vertical surface, it is followed by a white face slowly emerging from behind the wall. Hair like black, tattered spiderwebbing drifts on a nonexistant breeze, long and sheer. The face looks serene, asleep, with closed eyes and a slight smile.\n\nI am frozen in place at the sight, and the gears of my mind slowly tick into position to grant me some understanding.\n\nI am at home in the domestic world. I am a welcome guest in the wild world.\n\n*This creature belongs to neither.*\n\nAbruptly, the Thing scuttles towards us. Faster than a thought, its five other limbs join the first one - all of them spindly, ending in points sharp enough to split the bricks of the building as it darts over. I can't gasp as fast as it is in front of me, and bigger than it should be. It was barely as tall as a window up on the building, but in its swift motion, perspective seemed to crack and bend, and it grew taller faster than it grew closer somehow. As the murder dissolves around me, the crows taking flight with alarmed cries, the creature stops short about two meters from me and tilts its head.\n\nFor a moment I consider running, but my instincts root me to the ground. They understand faster than the rest of me that I can't outrun something this quick - and more importantly, that running is a very prey thing to do. So I keep my breathing quiet and shallow as I slowly move my hands to my messenger bag, gripping it tightly in case I need a shield of sorts.\n\nThe creature seems to regard me through its closed eyes, its face slowly creeping closer. My brain tries and struggles to perceive its body - I can discern the spidery legs and the webbish hair, but the rest is difficult to ascertain. It's all so black that I can see it as little more than a silhouette in the night, no highlights and shadows carve out the volume for me to grasp. There is the notion that there is a neck, as it slowly elongates to bring the face closer to mine, and there is the notion that there is a body, because there must be to connect it all. But that is all I can even say with certainty, and my eyes are soon too focused on the creature's face to even pay much attention to the rest.\n\nThe face seems like a mask, perfectly expressionless except for the slightly upturned corners of the mouth. It seems made in the image of a beautiful woman at first, with full lips and a dainty nose. But as it stops so close that its nose almost touches my own, I register with horror that I am staring at my own features, without being able to pinpoint when the change took place.\n\nWe stand like this while some seconds flow by as slowly as molasses. My heart hurts as it pumps my blood so hard that the rushing in my veins rings in my ears like static, even nearly drowning out the calls of the crows above. And then my humanity emerges from the deepest depths of me, and my brain short circuits from all the stress, picking out the most mundane and unimportant thing it could possibly wonder about to suppress the fear I feel.\n\nOne of my hands slowly rises, almost without my consent, to answer the question that suddenly occupies my mind. A few trembling fingertips touch the mask in front of me, brushing against it lightly.\n\nHuh. Yeah. It's made of porcelain.\n\nThe hard china shifts in an instant from the soft smile to a wide grin and the creature's eyes snap open. Cold blue doll eyes roll around in the mask's sockets before they settle on me, and the grin widens and widens until it by all means should split the face - my face - in two.\n\nI pull back my hand and stare wide-eyed as the creature tilts its face up, up, up, never breaking eye contact with me. And then I hear a tearing, moist and horrid, and I finally look down to see that the neck is *not* moving. The mask is tearing away from it, the chin splitting and ripping open along the seams of the jaw, behind which yawns an abyss much too bottomless for even this being. I stumble back a step as it bares its teeth, which are needles and serrated blades and barbs, and a glistening rope snakes past them to split into dripping tendrils before me.\n\nSomehow I manage to hold the messenger bag up and slip out of the carrying strap just as the tentacles shoot forth and grab it, tearing it away from me and into the nightmare. A high pitched whimper squeezes from my throat when I hear a hissing sound and watch as the bountiful saliva of the monster dissolves the bag and its contents even while it gets shredded by the many teeth.\n\nIt reminds me that I have one last tool to use for such situations.\n\n\"HELP!!\" I scream. And then I remember how you're supposed to do it.\n\n\"F-FIRE! FIRE! HELP!\" I can't completely recall why, but I vaguely remember the recommendation. The fact that calling out about fire at least makes people look. Often even call 112, the firefighters and ambulance. And from the corner of my eye, I register motion in one of the dark windows around me.\n\nI allow myself to tear my gaze away from the creature long enough to see who heard me, and my eyes just meet another smiling porcelain face behind one of the window panes. My blood freezes in my veins as from the darkness behind the glass, more white faces emerge - one behind each window, un-staring at me and their ilk. I can't help but turn my head entirely to it as the first window opens and another one of the creatures crawls out, an ethereal cackle filling the air and gaining layers as more windows open up.\n\nI feel utterly hopeless and slowly turn back to the first monster. It shakes with a cackle of its own, eyes rolling in different directions. As it makes another lunge at me though, it is hit by something from above and the cackle becomes a brief, shrill shriek.\n\nMy eyes snap up to the crows. They are cawing their little souls out, but by now, that isn't all they do anymore. I see them dive down to pick up anything their claws can grasp - rocks, empty cans, sometimes even just grass or soil - and they let their burdens rain down on the monster in front of me. Some of them swoop at the other creatures, sharp beaks razing off bits of the tattered veils around their faces. My heart overflows with gratitude and fondness for them until it wells up in my eyes and streaks down my cheeks.\n\nPerhaps I can run. Perhaps I can hide. Perhaps I can return to my domestic world after all!\n\nI try to turn to make a run for my building, but before I have even finished the full spin, a searing pain shoots through me. It radiates up from my foot as I hit the ground hard. I look down to see that the creature was not too distracted to notice my attempt - it pierced my foot with one of its limbs, pinning me against the ground. I cry out as it pulls me closer even while it fends off the crows and their improvised projectiles. Around me, the limbs of other creatures scratch down the walls. I look up into the flying murder, regretting that I still don't understand what I can almost, *almost* read in the shape of their flight.\n\nAnd then, behind the creature above me… the moon blinks.\n\nI fall silent once more as something shifts. The scream of a fox tears through the night and the feet of rats skitter past us somewhere. I watch as a moth whirls through my vision and I feel the city take a deep, shuddering breath.\n\nThe moon shifts, and it is an eye, and the night turns to look at us. As it lowers its head, I can discern the shape of short, squareish ears and a broad head upon which sits a crown of red bricks. At its top, trees sprout from the wall, their leaves rustling in a wind that suddenly picked up.\n\nBerlin looks at us, fixing the creatures with her eyes, one the moon and one a pool of street- and headlights, ever shifting. I feel a rumble shaking the earth as the giant bear above us growls and the creatures turn their pale faces to it. The night parts lips of orange clouds and a fiery red tongue lolls out of the titanic maw, steel teeth bared around it. She roars, and it's the screams of foxes and the howl of car horns and the noises of catfights and the scream of train wheels against their tracks as they brake. Lost children cry in her throat, and drunk men laugh, and the teeth of creatures with glowing eyes are dipped in the same scarlet as the knives of shadowy figures.\n\nThe monsters turn to flee, but the City tears an asphalt paw out of the road and swipes at them almost lazily. Red claws the length of street blocks pierce and collect several of the spindly beings - including the one in front of me - and throw them into the gaping maw of Berlin. They shriek pathetically as she bites down and their bodies crunch, and I can't help but think they're lucky. I know that in those depths they're headed for, there are worse things than teeth and claws. I glimpsed them when the mouth was open, saw, for a moment, the things in the deep. There was the cold of the winter streets and the fear of blue lights, the hostility of benches engineered to steal your sleep, the hopelessness of letters denying your basic necessities. The helplessness of neglectful guardians, the dehumanization of a stranger screaming at you. There were the shock of driving a train when someone steps on the tracks and looking out an office window as a body drops past, followed by a chilling wet thud soon after. Horrors surely as alien to these creatures as their ropey tendrils were to me.\n\nThe murder descends onto me, still cawing madly as they land all around and on my body. Huginn and Muninn sit on my chest, staring at my face and blinking. Huginn acts as if he pecks at me first and then Muninn and the others follow suit.\n\nI weirdly understand and close my eyes, going limp and playing dead. The crows make a big show of seemingly pecking at me, tugging at my clothing here and there and spreading their wings to block the City's view of me. I feel it shift as it leans in for a sniff that lifts me off the asphalt for a heartstopping moment with its strength. But the crows immediately flutter up with a courage I will forever aspire to, offendedly cawing at the titan bear. Berlin huffs, blowing my limp body several meters down the road with the force and moves to instead pursue the creatures to which I was as easy a snack as they are to the City.\n\nI crack my eyes open a little to watch as it passes overhead, glittering with the lights of streetlamps and windows at night. The laughter and music of faraway parties brushes past me, the rustling of leaves in the night and drunk singing and meows of graveyard cats. The suffocating heat of urban summers and the chill of winter nights take turns with the mild air of springs. I hear the Spree gurgle and feel immersed in its waters, fish flitting past me, and then I feel the calm of public transport after midnight on a weekend, with tired people smiling as they head home. I smell smog and dust and excrements and blood and fresh bread rolls and flowers and wet paint and dogs.\n\nAnd then the Goddess has moved on and we are alone, the crows and I, my mind reeling from having seen and felt all my home is.\n\nIt takes Muninn actually pecking at my cheek for me to come back from my trance and I give him a bleary blink. His beak opens, but this time not to caw.\n\n\"Good birdies!\" He coos in a voice close to mine. Huginn joins in.\n\"Good birdies! Good birdies! Treats?\" They hop off my chest and their brethren get off me as well, fluttering and cawing with the occasional praise for themselves thrown in.\n\nA laugh bubbles up from deep within me, and as I throw back my head and it spills from my lips, I could swear that I can also hear the hum of cars and the rustle of leaves in it somewhere.\n\n\"Good birdies!\" I affirm and get up. It will probably be best for me to get home and sleep it off. My foot hurts, but that worldly sensation is so distant right now, while the exhaustion is so present and overwhelming.\n\nAs I limp towards my building, drawing keys from my pocket, I have to dodge wires growing up from the ground around the piece of road which Berlin's claws raked deep rifts into. I pause to watch as the broken street scabs over with a construction site. I know from the depths of my stomach that tomorrow, construction workers will show up and do their job here just as casually and naturally as everywhere else in the city. As I turn away from it, I smile about the insight I feel enlightened with.\n\nI am hurting. I am bleeding. I am freezing. I am tired.\n\nBut I am alive.\n\nJust like the city.",

        "text": "Many people ask me why I love Berlin so much. And they rarely understand my answer: It's the way the city is alive.\n\nFor one, Berlin is a pretty green city, you know? Even many of the big and busy streets are lined with trees, and pools of green parks sprawl out amidst the buildings. Sometimes the life seems ugly - like the rats teeming across subway tracks or pigeons shitting from a bus stop's roof. But I am in love with it when the foxes scream at night and the cats howl during their hunts and fights. It makes me smile when the starlings and sparrows hop around me as I sit down on a bench, eagerly beeping to beg for food, and I happily tug some bits off my sandwich to toss among them.\n\nBut I think my favorite may be the crows. Even as a child, I found it hypnotising when their murders swarmed across the skies. It always felt like I could almost, *almost* recognise something in the shapes or their flight. Something significant. Something magical.\n\nI own no pets, but I buy cat treats every day. The good ones, too. All so I can seize the opportunities when the crows land on the lamp posts around me, tilting their heads so that their eyes, little black pearls among their feathers, can get a better look at me.\n\nI like to step back a little then, get out the treat bags, and throw a few.\n\"Treats!\" I offer in a high pitched voice.\n\nAnd without fail, a few brave crows flutter down to peck at my little offerings. It's a delight, really! Watching them hop around, gathering the little morsels. They seem so thankful, and so am I!\n\n\"Good birdies~!\" I coo, squatting down as I toss more and more food to them. It almost hurts my heart when the bags are empty and I have to announce it with a sad \"All gone! All gone!\" to my feathery friends.\n\nAt first, that was when they took off again. No doubt to bring any surplus to their families and stashes for later. It always left me feeling a bit sad and empty to be abandoned so soon.\n\nBut now, this doesn't deter them anymore. They often still hop after me a little, cawing and fluttering at me. It makes me laugh and I always answer them like it's a conversation. I like the idea that they are telling me about their day.\n\nMy favorite are a pair I like to call Huginn and Muninn. Yes, yes, those are actually ravens - so sue me.\n\nHuginn and Muninn are the bravest among their murder. They happily come so close that I could touch them if I really wanted to. I never do though - I don't know if they'd be fine with it and you know, wild animals are still wild animals. The crows and I, we appreciate each other. But I am aware that there is an invisible border between me, a human, and the wildlife of Berlin. The crows are not pets, they are not for petting.\n\nI cross the border to bring them food. And they welcome me on their side as a respectful guest. But eventually, I have a duty to leave again and return to my apartment, to the domestic world within the buildings.\n\nAnd that's okay. My love is not arrogant. I don't feel entitled to the hearts of crows.\n\nIt makes me all the more excited and happy when those two come so close, sometimes even ignoring the treats to gently caw at me. Their brethren are grey like the cloudy, misty days of autumn, safe for their black heads and wings. But Huginn and Muninn are black like the light-polluted sky at night.\n\nFor all the love I have for my surroundings, I don't have much for myself. My body, at times, feels unfitting like a suit in the wrong size. But many of my insecurities melt away when the crows look at me and I realize that in their eyes, I am no more or less unsightly than any other human. It's nice.\n\nI think the reason many people don't understand this is because to them, I'm not even remotely as social and open as I am towards the animals and plants. That's okay though. They don't need to understand as long as they are nice to me, which most of them are. I don't really have many friends, but I am treated cordially by my co-workers at the grocery store, and even by most of the customers. That's all I need. They even let me take the late shifts I prefer!\n\nMy workplace tends to be open until 11pm, which means that we typically wrap up all end-of-day stuff around midnight. So I have a whole hour of counting and tidying to get excited for my evening routine! And then I grab the treats I bought on my break and get to wander home through the nightly streets, while the city is dozing. Sometimes I take the night bus, but construction sites have a habit of popping up along my route like mushrooms. And I'm not always in the mood for the long detours or additional stops to switch busses. Especially when walking through the nightly city is so wonderful.\n\nIt never fully falls asleep, but on work nights it can get quiet enough for the cats and foxes to come out. I beam whenever I see one of them dart across a silent street in front of me, and sometimes they even stop and look at me! It's strange how in those late hours, when the world is streetlightorange and nightblack, the city feels the most alive to me. I sometimes almost think I can feel it breathe beneath my feet, its chest rising and falling ever so slowly as it dreams of faraway ambulance sirens and the occasional laughter from a dark window.\n\nSo when I walk home one autumn night and hear nothing, it gives me pause. My steps slow until I stand still, cocking my head to listen.\n\nThere is no distant rumble of cars and trains tonight. No fox screams, no cat hisses. As I raise my eyes and look around, all windows are dark, the only light around coming from the street lamps. They do not buzz as they usually do, and no moths dance around them.\n\nI shudder and pull my hoodie closer around me. But there is no wind. The trees and shrubs of my street are still, each leaf perfectly motionless. I can't help but imagine them holding their breath to escape the notice of something.\n\nWhen I hear the murder caw, it makes me wince at first. But I feel relief spreading through my chest when I see the crows flutter down onto the branches and streetlamps around me. They are familiar faces, and the suffocating isolation I felt a moment ago is easily broken by the flutter of their wings. I don't even think about the unusual time for their outing as I excitedly dig in my messenger bag and produce the little strips of meat I bought for them today.\n\n\"Treats!\" I offer, happily ripping open the bag. The rustle of the plastic feels strangely loud in the night, as does my voice. But I am too happy still - I pull out some meat bits and toss them onto the sidewalk for my friends.\n\nFor some reason, it seems to unsettle the crows. Some of them caw at me, strangely muted tonight. Huginn and Muninn flutter down to the roof of a parked car and motion at me with their wings and head. I am deeply confused that they ignore the food so completely.\n\n\"What's wrong? Treats!\" I say, throwing some more strips of meat their way. At first I smile when one of them flies off the car - but then I notice with horror that he doesn't aim for the treats on the pavement, but for me.\n\nI yelp as Muninn swishes past me so closely that I can feel his claws cut the air above my head. And I stumble back a few steps, dropping the bag and trembling as my brain tries to process the profound betrayal. I thought we were… well, not friends, maybe. Friends are a domestic thing.\n\nBut I thought I was a welcome guest. And now, instead, each caw and flutter makes me feel like I am unwanted here.\n\nI don't have much time to dwell on this, because the noise around me abruptly ceases and all bird heads turn so their beaks point at the same point somewhere above us. A discordant scratching sound is all that remains, and I feel as if someone is slowly trickling ice water down my nape as I, too, turn to face the noise.\n\nA black, needle-like limb slowly creeps around the corner of a building, on the height of the third floor just about. As it somehow finds purchase on the vertical surface, it is followed by a white face slowly emerging from behind the wall. Hair like black, tattered spiderwebbing drifts on a nonexistant breeze, long and sheer. The face looks serene, asleep, with closed eyes and a slight smile.\n\nI am frozen in place at the sight, and the gears of my mind slowly tick into position to grant me some understanding.\n\nI am at home in the domestic world. I am a welcome guest in the wild world.\n\n*This creature belongs to neither.*\n\nAbruptly, the Thing scuttles towards us. Faster than a thought, its five other limbs join the first one - all of them spindly, ending in points sharp enough to split the bricks of the building as it darts over. I can't gasp as fast as it is in front of me, and bigger than it should be. It was barely as tall as a window up on the building, but in its swift motion, perspective seemed to crack and bend, and it grew taller faster than it grew closer somehow. As the murder dissolves around me, the crows taking flight with alarmed cries, the creature stops short about two meters from me and tilts its head.\n\nFor a moment I consider running, but my instincts root me to the ground. They understand faster than the rest of me that I can't outrun something this quick - and more importantly, that running is a very prey thing to do. So I keep my breathing quiet and shallow as I slowly move my hands to my messenger bag, gripping it tightly in case I need a shield of sorts.\n\nThe creature seems to regard me through its closed eyes, its face slowly creeping closer. My brain tries and struggles to perceive its body - I can discern the spidery legs and the webbish hair, but the rest is difficult to ascertain. It's all so black that I can see it as little more than a silhouette in the night, no highlights and shadows carve out the volume for me to grasp. There is the notion that there is a neck, as it slowly elongates to bring the face closer to mine, and there is the notion that there is a body, because there must be to connect it all. But that is all I can even say with certainty, and my eyes are soon too focused on the creature's face to even pay much attention to the rest.\n\nThe face seems like a mask, perfectly expressionless except for the slightly upturned corners of the mouth. It seems made in the image of a beautiful woman at first, with full lips and a dainty nose. But as it stops so close that its nose almost touches my own, I register with horror that I am staring at my own features, without being able to pinpoint when the change took place.\n\nWe stand like this while some seconds flow by as slowly as molasses. My heart hurts as it pumps my blood so hard that the rushing in my veins rings in my ears like static, even nearly drowning out the calls of the crows above. And then my humanity emerges from the deepest depths of me, and my brain short circuits from all the stress, picking out the most mundane and unimportant thing it could possibly wonder about to suppress the fear I feel.\n\nOne of my hands slowly rises, almost without my consent, to answer the question that suddenly occupies my mind. A few trembling fingertips touch the mask in front of me, brushing against it lightly.\n\nHuh. Yeah. It's made of porcelain.\n\nThe hard china shifts in an instant from the soft smile to a wide grin and the creature's eyes snap open. Cold blue doll eyes roll around in the mask's sockets before they settle on me, and the grin widens and widens until it by all means should split the face - my face - in two.\n\nI pull back my hand and stare wide-eyed as the creature tilts its face up, up, up, never breaking eye contact with me. And then I hear a tearing, moist and horrid, and I finally look down to see that the neck is *not* moving. The mask is tearing away from it, the chin splitting and ripping open along the seams of the jaw, behind which yawns an abyss much too bottomless for even this being. I stumble back a step as it bares its teeth, which are needles and serrated blades and barbs, and a glistening rope snakes past them to split into dripping tendrils before me.\n\nSomehow I manage to hold the messenger bag up and slip out of the carrying strap just as the tentacles shoot forth and grab it, tearing it away from me and into the nightmare. A high pitched whimper squeezes from my throat when I hear a hissing sound and watch as the bountiful saliva of the monster dissolves the bag and its contents even while it gets shredded by the many teeth.\n\nIt reminds me that I have one last tool to use for such situations.\n\n\"HELP!!\" I scream. And then I remember how you're supposed to do it.\n\n\"F-FIRE! FIRE! HELP!\" I can't completely recall why, but I vaguely remember the recommendation. The fact that calling out about fire at least makes people look. Often even call 112, the firefighters and ambulance. And from the corner of my eye, I register motion in one of the dark windows around me.\n\nI allow myself to tear my gaze away from the creature long enough to see who heard me, and my eyes just meet another smiling porcelain face behind one of the window panes. My blood freezes in my veins as from the darkness behind the glass, more white faces emerge - one behind each window, un-staring at me and their ilk. I can't help but turn my head entirely to it as the first window opens and another one of the creatures crawls out, an ethereal cackle filling the air and gaining layers as more windows open up.\n\nI feel utterly hopeless and slowly turn back to the first monster. It shakes with a cackle of its own, eyes rolling in different directions. As it makes another lunge at me though, it is hit by something from above and the cackle becomes a brief, shrill shriek.\n\nMy eyes snap up to the crows. They are cawing their little souls out, but by now, that isn't all they do anymore. I see them dive down to pick up anything their claws can grasp - rocks, empty cans, sometimes even just grass or soil - and they let their burdens rain down on the monster in front of me. Some of them swoop at the other creatures, sharp beaks razing off bits of the tattered veils around their faces. My heart overflows with gratitude and fondness for them until it wells up in my eyes and streaks down my cheeks.\n\nPerhaps I can run. Perhaps I can hide. Perhaps I can return to my domestic world after all!\n\nI try to turn to make a run for my building, but before I have even finished the full spin, a searing pain shoots through me. It radiates up from my foot as I hit the ground hard. I look down to see that the creature was not too distracted to notice my attempt - it pierced my foot with one of its limbs, pinning me against the ground. I cry out as it pulls me closer even while it fends off the crows and their improvised projectiles. Around me, the limbs of other creatures scratch down the walls. I look up into the flying murder, regretting that I still don't understand what I can almost, *almost* read in the shape of their flight.\n\nAnd then, behind the creature above me… the moon blinks.\n\nI fall silent once more as something shifts. The scream of a fox tears through the night and the feet of rats skitter past us somewhere. I watch as a moth whirls through my vision and I feel the city take a deep, shuddering breath.\n\nThe moon shifts, and it is an eye, and the night turns to look at us. As it lowers its head, I can discern the shape of short, squareish ears and a broad head upon which sits a crown of red bricks. At its top, trees sprout from the wall, their leaves rustling in a wind that suddenly picked up.\n\nBerlin looks at us, fixing the creatures with her eyes, one the moon and one a pool of street- and headlights, ever shifting. I feel a rumble shaking the earth as the giant bear above us growls and the creatures turn their pale faces to it.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10rsupy/my_wife_died_last_year_and_now_my_only_company_is/",
        "text": " \n\nI always thought of mice as dumb animals that are driven by their basic instincts, eat, sleep, multiply. I know that they can be trained to do tricks and are good at problem solving like finding their way out of a maze, but in human terms there is no comparison. Or so I thought. \n\nAbout a month ago I started hearing scratching on the ceiling over my bed, I knew straight away it was a mouse what else could it be. It didn’t really bother me, but if my wife was alive, she would have lost it, she was terrified of the things. I can imagine her now wrapped around me warning me to get rid of it. Then she would have made me spend the rest of the night in the attic tearing up floorboards until I found it. She was very demanding like that, weirdly that is one of the things I miss the most about her. \n\nAt around the same time every night the scratching started, but I just ignored it, even when a small hole appeared directly over my head. I just shoved a sock in it and told myself I'd fix it later, which I still haven’t gotten around to. Eventually the scratching stopped, and for a while I thought the mouse was gone, until one night when I was sitting at the table working on my computer, like I did most nights, I saw something crawl out from underneath the kitchen door. When I saw it was the mouse, I jumped back on my chair and screamed a little bit, I wasn’t afraid, it just startled me.  \n\nSurprisingly with all that noise the mouse didn’t run away, it just stood there in the middle of the floor with an odd look in its eye, it didn’t even look scared of me. I wasn’t sure what to do, I didn’t want to hurt the poor little thing, but I couldn’t have it in my house either. So, I slowly backed up against the wall and made my way around to the back door, the whole time the mouse just stood there watching me. Then I opened the door and made my way back around so that I could try chase him out to the back yard. \n\nSuddenly I ran towards it, but it didn’t move, it just stood there with that weird look in its eye, it wasn’t until I stamped my feet before it finally ran behind the cabinet under the sink. As quick as I could I blocked off all exits with whatever I could find around the house so it couldn’t escape. The next day I bought a half dozen mouse traps and laid them down outside the only place it could escape. \n\nThere was only one way in and one way out, so I was sure I’d have him caught by the end of the day, but it didn’t come out. Again, the next day there was no sign of it. After a while I begin to believe that he was gone, maybe I scared him to death, I thought, or it could have found a way outside and was too frightened to come back. \n\nThen one night I heard a loud clap coming from the mouse trap, then another. I turned around just in time to see the mouse leap over the third trap like a gymnast. It was now standing beside me less than two feet away, again it just stood there fearlessly staring up at me, it was like it was waiting to see how I would react. \n\nI tried shooing it, but it wouldn’t budge. So, l leaned in for a closer look, suddenly it threw me the strangest look, I know you won’t believe me, but I could swear it smiled at me. I got such a fright that I screamed like I little girl, and it ran under the fridge. \n\nAs fast as I could, I blocked every exit in the whole kitchen, apart from the one where I set the traps this time in a way that I believed would be impossible for him not to get caught. When I was done, I grabbed the sweeping brush and waited for it to come out, which didn’t take very long. It was like it had a death wish, it just casually popped out and started walking towards me, before it got too close, I swung the brush just missing its head, and it ran away. I spent about 5 minutes chasing it around the kitchen before it finally ran toward the traps. \n\nOne by one it pounced, setting off the traps as it went, then safely ran into the hole. I couldn’t believe it, I was beaten by a mouse. But I didn’t give up, every night I would come up with a new way of outsmarting it, but I couldn’t, the mouse was a fucking genius. However, frustrating it was I couldn’t help but respect the thing, I didn’t know whether to catch it or throw it a parade. \n\nThe longer this went on the more I started to enjoy it, and I wasn’t the only one, the mouse seemed to get something out of it too or why would it keep coming to me every night like it did. Before I knew it, I felt back to my old self, I had a sense of purpose that I had not felt in a long time. I half didn’t want to catch the thing because I didn’t want it to end. \n\nBut as much as I liked having that mouse around, there was one thing I loved more. I used to keep a photo of my wife on the window beside the fridge, it was taken the summer before she got sick. I don’t know why l liked that photo so much, it was just a normal day when I took it. We were just out walking at the beach near our home, and she looked happy, so I took a photo. But every time I looked at that photo it took me back to a time when things weren’t so... broken. \n\nIt must have been 3am and I had just finished the project I was working on, and was about to save it, when I heard the little patter of tiny footsteps on the countertop. Out of the corner of my eye I saw the mouse nibbling on the crumbs that were left over from when I made a sandwich. I pretended that I couldn’t see him and kept tapping away at random keys on the computer, every now and then I'd glance over to see what it was up to. Usually, the mouse didn’t take it’s eyes off me the whole time, but this time it seemed distracted. \n\nSo carefully I grabbed a towel from the chair beside me as the mouse climbed on to the windowsill. It sniffed around for a while, then looked over at me for a moment, and scuttled behind the radio. That’s when I got my chance and I quickly pushed out my chair and ran to the window, which made a lot of noise, so, I knew it heard me.  \n\n“Now I got you, you little shit” I giggle to myself as I tried clearing the area of anything that he could hide behind. \n\nSuddenly it shot out across the windowsill and hid behind the rainbow cactus, I quickly tried to push it out of my way, but instead it fell, and I instinctively tried to grab it. Which was a bad idea, both my hands were covered with spines, and the mouse escaped out of sight. \n\nOne by one I pull out the spines, loudly coursing the mouse with every prick, but as I was taking out the last one, the mouse suddenly popped out from behind my wife's photo. Without thinking I grabbed the towel from the countertop and flicked it towards the mouse, knocking both the mouse and the photo of my wife onto the floor, shattering the frame into little pieces. \n\nWhen I looked down, I saw the mouse standing in the middle of the rubble, staring up at me with it’s mouth open. Suddenly I felt myself fill with rage and I slowly lifted my leg as I prepared to crush him, instead of running away, it just stands there, eyes clutched tight, bracing itself. I couldn’t do it, there was just something about it that made my heart melt, so I tried to pull my leg away but slipped on the broken glass and fell. Then I heard a loud squeak and when I turned around, I saw the mouse limping under the sink, again setting off the traps as it went. \n\nI started to feel bad for the poor thing I didn’t want to kill it, I just wanted it out of the house, so the next day I decided to rib out the timber at the bottom of the counter to check on it. Right in the corner on top of one of my old socks I found it, it must have passed away in the night. This is the weird thing, scratched into the wall over it was the word, “shrimpy” that was a nickname my wife had for me, it was what I ordered on our first date, she said my breath stink for the rest of the night and ever since she said I was her little shrimpy.  \n\nI know that it could have been written by my wife years before, or even by the people that lived there before us, but what if it was my wife trying to help me through a bad time and I killed her.",

        "text": "This post will get immediately taken down if I reveal the locations of the incident and the locations related to it, so I would refrain from doing that.\n\nAll of the readers here, if you have ever moved to a new place, and you had to go to a new school, most of you just wanted to fit in, didn't you? Sure exceptions are everywhere, but most of you did. Some would have been just too shy and would have been reserved, and some of you might have amazing at socializing. It would be easy for you to make new friends.\n\nI, like most people, was at the middle. When I switched places because of my father's transfer, it was really awkward at first on the school. But, one thing about me(which I am not bragging about) was that I had good levels of confidence. Like if I had a speech to give in front of a 1000 people, sure, my hands would tremble, my legs would shake, but still, I would be able to give it.\n\nSame was with me making friends. I was screaming and cursing at myself in my mind for every little mistake that I did, but outside I was as calm as a rock. Gradually, I got into the group of my class.\n\nThe problem starts here : I was not the only transfer student here.\n\nFor confidential reasons, we will call him X.\n\nOn like day 2, my socializing had become good. I was having casual conversations with everyone. It was going quite amazing.\n\nBut X . . .\n\nThe problem was he just seemed off downright creepy.\n\nLike there was just something wrong with him.\n\nAnd his ugliness did not really help him. And for some reason, he had to smile all the time. Did he really think that was helping him?\n\nBut by the end of the day, X realized something : Nobody liked him.\n\nLooks play a major role in our society and if you lack them . . . well, life ain't so easy for you.\n\nFor X, it was the same. He didn't even look average. He was ugly, compared to all of us. Along with this he had those high-numbered spectacles.\n\nAt the 3rd day, I had finally become friends with most of the people in my class. I was good at describing incidents of my past school and mind you, they were funny. Everyone was laughing at my jokes, even the most beautiful girl in class. The recess was going good.\n\nAnd then, just by coincidence, I saw X.\n\nHe was eating his food, but those eyes were just staring at me.\n\nJust staring.\n\nHe was eating his food almost in a mechanical order, as if he was taught, this is how humans eat and was following it step by step.\n\nBut he was looking at me. Unblinking. Unwavering.\n\nIt sent a shiver down my spine and I choked on my food.\n\nWhen I looked up again, X wasn't there. Maybe he had gone off to the washroom.\n\nIt wasn't that I had sabotaged him on purpose. He had tried talking with everyone, he had tried telling jokes . . . it was just that nobody wanted to be with him. Nobody did. He just gave off that creepy aura.\n\nImagine, you are playing a game. You and a guy start off at the same position, but somehow, the game gives the other guy an advantage for no reason and he starts winning. Won't that guy become your opponent? Won't you try to **eliminate** him?\n\nFrom that day on, I became the opponent of X.\n\nA week later or so, I was going to the washroom. There were open toilets in our bathrooms and then there were the closed doors ones. I always preferred the closed ones. There is a thing such as privacy.\n\nSo, I was in there, doing my thing and suddenly, there was a knock on the door.\n\n\"Occupied\", I replied.\n\n*KNOCK*\n\n\"Hey, its occu---\", I never got to complete that sentence.\n\nSuddenly, a hand grabbed my throat from behind. A black, rough, charred hand, as though it was burnt.\n\nI was shocked at first and then I tried to struggle my way out, but the grip only got tighter.\n\nInstantly, I was losing my breath, the world was spinning around me, getting darker and darker and darker.\n\nAnd in between this, I was hearing soft laugh, chuckles. Whatever **it** was, **it** was enjoying this. Hearing me struggle and choke was giving **it** immense pleasure.\n\nThe last thing I remembered, was that I saw the hand coming from above the toilet door, not through it.\n\nAnd then suddenly, my alarm went off.\n\nI don't know when or how I had scheduled that alarm. Maybe it was out of habit. But I make sure that each time I set an alarm, I put in the worst possible ringtone, so that I immediately acknowledge it.\n\nThat is what saved me that day. A fucking alarm.\n\nThe alarm went off and suddenly, it let go of my throat, making unnatural noises and then I guess, it went away, as fast as it could.\n\n5 minutes later, I woke up, by the sounds of the janitor banging the door.\n\nAs I got out the washroom, after being scolded, I was terrified as fuck, my whole body trembling. But I understood one thing and it sent a shiver down my spine.\n\nThere was **something** in this school and that **something** wanted to kill me.\n\nAnd I had pretty good guess of who it could be.",

        "text": "When my sister, Amy, was in 9th grade, her favorite math teacher, Mr. Marris, leapt from the top story of the humanities building and exploded on the pavement. He did it right as the lunch bell rang when the main quad was at its busiest. \n\nLater, everyone would have a story: a description of the way his arms disengaged from his torso. A spot of his blood on a pair of Converse sneakers that landed from twenty feet away. Words Mr. Marris murmured as he descended through the air. \n\nNinety percent of it was lies. But high school kids had to entertain themselves somehow.\n\nOf course, no one could top Amy. Amy told us all that she was being haunted. We thought it was a joke at first. She’d always been a little weird. Mommy’s little math genius who’d never been to a sleepover much less gone on a date.\n\nAs a seventh grader, Amy had memorized pi to 100 digits. By 8th, she was already taking classes at the high school. In 9th, she was the only freshman in Mr. Marris’s calculus class, and the only one with a perfect grade at the time of his fall. \n\nA week after the fall, when Mr. Marris’s replacement came in, Amy spent the first hour of class staring into space and muttering to herself. Finally, after the sub was sufficiently creeped out, she asked Amy what she was saying.\n\n*He doesn’t like the way you’re teaching derivatives,* Amy said quietly. *You shouldn’t start with real world examples like acceleration and speed. Leave that for the physicists. Start with the pure theory like an actual mathematician, you fucking bitch.*\n\nIf Jackson Poole was to be believed, she’d practically growled those last words like the chick in *The Exorcist.* But then again, he was stoned half the time and loved making shit up. \n\nAfter Amy’s outburst, the sub decided to peace out, and the principal pulled Amy out of the class. My parents threw a fit, but the administration wiggled out of their crosshares by claiming Amy was *too advanced* and needed special accommodations.\n\nThe principal got a PhD student from the local college to come in for a couple of hours a week to work with Amy. But the guy freaked out after just a couple of sessions. Every new concept he introduced, Amy seemed to already know back and forth, despite the fact that she’d never read any of the textbooks.\n\nI still have a copy of the email he sent the school with my parents cc’ed: *There’s simply no way a 14 year old girl would be able to intuitively grasp Taylor and MacLuarin series through osmosis, sheer genius or even poking around on the internet. Worse, she claims that Mr. Marris is the one whispering answers to her, and that he doesn’t like my cologne. I feel threatened, and I don’t wish to continue in this position.*\n\nOf course, to my parents, the school was the problem. Their little genius was just too smart for the lazy administrators. At dinner, they muttered about lawsuits and taking the GED, applications to MIT and CalTech. \n\n“They’re wrong, you know,” said Amy one day after mom and dad had cleared out. “I’m not that smart. He just won’t stop shouting the answers at me. And if I don’t repeat what he says, he gets so mad.”\n\n“I’m sorry,” I said, trying to be comforting. “I guess I didn’t realize you guys were that close.”\n\n“We weren’t!” she shouted. Then, calming down a bit, she added. “You believe me, right? That he’s here? He says you don’t believe me.”\n\n“I think you’ve been traumatized,” I said, careful with my words. \n\n“He said you wouldn’t believe me,” Amy muttered. “He said no one would.”\n\nAs I tried to go to bed that night, I heard Amy’s soft snores drifting out from the room across the hall. It had been a long time since she’d gone to sleep before me. \n\nIt reminded me of when we were little girls and shared a bed. Back then, her room had been our room. When she had trouble sleeping, she’d stare nervously at the ceiling, conjuring invisible monsters, and I’d tell her stories to calm her down.\n\nI guess we’d drifted apart since then. I still loved writing, but I wasn’t much of a student. At some point, people had decided I was average and she was the star, and those labels had just stuck, pushing us further and further apart over the years. And of course I still loved her, but it had all been shaded with resentment and hurt.\n\nBut now, in this moment, I just wanted her to be a star again. To be her old nerdy self. To be okay.\n\nI walked over to check on her sleeping. That’s when I saw the brown book for the first time. She had it nuzzled under her arm as she slept. It smelled musty, and its bindings were cracking with age. Slowly, I crept over and removed it from under her arm. \n\n*Mathematica Imaginari* read the title.\n\nThe book felt strangely warm to the touch, and something in me wanted to drop it. Still, I might have opened it if not for the fact that at that exact moment my sister’s mirror fell off the wall and shattered into a thousand pieces. \n\nAmy woke with a start and looked at me with panicked eyes.\n\n“My book,” she said, springing out of bed. She snatched it out of my hands. “You need to stay away from it,” she warned. “You wouldn’t understand it.”\n\nIt was only then that she realized she was standing on a shard of glass. She bent over and pulled it slowly out of her foot.\n\n“Bad luck,” she said, looking dazed. “Seven years bad luck for both of us. Seven times seven is forty-nine. Times seven again is three hundred and forty three. Times seven again is two thousand, four-hundred and one. Times seven again is–”\n\nI screamed for my parents.\n\nAfter that, Amy took a turn for the worse. She’d take a pen and stand on a chair in her bedroom. Starting at the corner where the wall met the ceiling, she’d scribble impossibly complex formulas, sometimes including symbols I couldn’t identify even on a Google search.\n\n“It’s a proof,” she tried to explain. “A proof of something that humans aren’t supposed to understand, I think. But he’s *making* me understand. He says we’ve lived in a house of straw called believe for millenia, and this will rewrite everything. The whole house is coming down. There are just so many numbers, though. Holding it all in my head… it’s so hard.”\n\nShe was crying as she spoke. \n\n“He won’t stop talking. Won’t stop ranting. He never listens. He never shuts up.”\n\nWhen we sent photos to professors at the local university, they dismissed it as numerical gibberish, a bucketful of meaningless equations. \n\n“He’s making me do it,” said Amy, almost in tears one day when I asked her to stop. “He says we’ve got to bring the math from where he is back over here. He says his mind is open now. He says he’ll hurt you and mom and dad if I don’t do everything he says. Now I need you to call Professor McAddams at Princeton and tell him the following.”\n\n“Amy–” I started to say. I noticed the black book at her feet, and I quickly snatched it up.\n\n“I don’t think you should have this anymore,” I said.\n\nHer eyes grew wide and she lunged at me, trying to grab it back.\n\n“Please,” she said. “He’ll make me hurt you. Please just leave before–”\n\n“It’s all in your fucking head!” I shouted. “He’s not making you do anything!”\n\n“Don’t you dare disobey me, you whore!” she shouted, and then she stabbed my hand so hard with the pen that the tip stuck out my palm.\n\n“I’m so sorry,” she said, again and again. “He made me do it! You believe me, right? You have to believe me!”\n\nAfter that, they had Amy committed on a 48 hour involuntary hold at the psych ward. I wanted to visit, but the doctors recommended against it. \n\nAt home, the pain in my hand seethed. My parents were exhausted and went to sleep early, but I just sat in Amy’s room. The black book lay on the floor, a splotch of my blood still on it for where I’d been stabbed. \n\nFor a second, I was furious, thinking about the way she’d stabbed me, how angry she’d gotten. It was like I didn’t know her anymore. But the more I thought about it, the more I just missed her. I just wanted her back. \n\nI picked up the black book and took it to the stove. Then I put I turned on the burner and let the flames eat the whole cursed thing. The cover stunk and smoked as the flames consumed it. Before it fully went up, I swear it tried to move, edging its way away from the flames, but I put it back in place with a long fork. I kept watching it burn until the smoke alarm went off and my parents ran down panicked to check on me.\n\nBack at school almost a month had passed, and the administration had just gotten its act together to start planning a memorial for Mr. Marris. Posters were up all over campus, complete with his school photo and a request for speakers who had touching memories to share.\n\nI was walking down the hall when I saw Janet Cassidy rip down one of the posters and shove it in the trash.\n\n“Not a fan?” I asked.\n\n“Just forget it,” she said, heading down the stairs. But I followed.\n\n“I thought everyone loved that guy,” I said. “He’s was like, everyone’s favorite math teacher.”\n\n“Come on,” she said. “Don’t play dumb. You’re really going to make me say it?”\n\n“Yeah?”\n\nShe shrugged. “He was tutoring me after school sophomore year and felt me up a little. He told me not to tell anyone, so I didn’t. I’d write him little love notes and imagine all kinds of crazy shit. Like how he’d leave his wife for me, and we could finally be officially a couple once I graduated.”\n\nWe came up to another poster, and he tore it from the wall, ripping it into pieces, letting them fall to the floor.\n\n“Then one day I walked in. I’d brought him a coffee and asked him for a kiss. But he was busy reading this super old math book. He was muttering numbers, and then he wrote this crazy equation on the board. He asked me to help him solve it, but I wasn’t even in Algebra II yet. Then he called me a fucking stupid kid. I tried to hold his hand, and he basically shoved me off into a desk. That was kind of the end for us.”\n\n“I told a couple of people about the whole thing, but no one believed me. Mr. Marris’s wife was smoking hot. Why would he bother with some ugly underclassmen. People said I didn’t even have boobs to grab, that sort of shit. Even my parents said I should just drop it. The worst part is he *told* me no one would believe me, and he was right. That without proof nothing I said mattered. Asshole.”\n\nAfter two days, they let Amy out of the psych ward. Apparently, she’d been able to keep it together pretty well, and the doctors wrote the attack off as an isolated incident. They gave her the number of a therapist and sent her home.\n\n“You burned the book,” she said when I tried to go in to her room to talk with her.\n\n“I thought maybe it would help,” I said. “I just want you to be better.”\n\n“Don’t you get it?” she asked. “It doesn’t matter. He has his own copy *over there.* He’s going to keep reading it to me. He’s going to keep read it until the numbers take me, just like they took him”\n\n“Amy,” I said. “Mr. Marris is dead. He’s not talking to you. Please. Please come back to me. I just want things to be like they were.”\n\n“He’s laughing at you now,” she said. “He said you set off the smoke alarm. He said now our parents think you’re crazy too.”\n\n“Fuck you,” I said, slamming the door behind me.\n\nWe all tried to pretend everything was normal. \n\nAmy even went back to school, but of course by then the rumor mill was going full speed. The abuse was endless.\n\n*“So does Mr. Marris watch you go to the bathroom?”*\n\n*“What’s 2,758 x 9999?”*\n\n*“Does his wife know he’s with you instead of her?”*\n\n“None of them believe me,” said Amy at lunch, crying hot tears that fell from her face all the way down to her lap. “Why won’t anyone believe me?”\n\nI said nothing, staring at my wounded hand. \n\n“Do you know Janet Cassidy,” I asked, but by the Amy was already walking. She marched past the picnic tables and up the stairwell, muttering to herself.\n\n*No, I’m done talking to you. I’m done. You can get yourself a new girl. I’m done. I’m done I’m done I’m done!*\n\nI started after her, but she was going faster now, taking the stairs two at a time, counting them as she went. She sprinted up, three, four flights of stairs and then up to the roof. I could barely breathe as I tried to catch up to her. Finally, I emerged onto the roof myself to see her standing fifty feet away at the ledge overlooking the quad.\n\n“Wait!” I shouted. “Don’t do this, Amy. I love you! Please don’t do this. I love you so much.”\n\n“I don’t care if you love me,” she shouted back. She leaned out into the space above the quad. If not for the wind blowing her back, I think she might have a fallen right then. “Plenty of people love me! I don’t need that!”\n\n“He’s waiting for me down there,” she shouted. “He’s got a pen all picked out. He says I’ll be holding it for all eternity, writing for him. Holding his fucking pen!”\n\nAnd then, suddenly, the words burst out of me. “I believe you.”\n\nShe blinked away tears.\n\n“No you don’t,” she said. “Don’t lie. You think I’m fucking crazy.”\n\nI took a step toward her. \n\n“I believe you,” I said again, and I meant it. I knew there was no evidence. No way to ever prove it. But I knew she needed someone to believe her. And so that’s what I gave her.\n\nAs I said the words again, she fell to her knees sobbing. I ran to her and held her in my arms, just like I had when she was a little wiggly toddler, and all she wanted was for me to hug her.\n\n“I felt so alone,” she said.\n\nI looked around. “Is he here right now?”\n\nAmy blinked her eyes and looked around, confused. \n\n“It’s the strangest thing,” she said. “He’s gone.”",

        "text": "I didn’t sleep well the final night I was seventeen. Bad dreams kept swirling around like sharks in shallow water, just out of sight. I woke up feeling sick and scared. The dread faded quickly, though, in the light of the sun, which my mom let crashing into my room when she threw the curtains open. \n\n“Happy birthday!” my mom yelled.  “You’re now eligible for the draft and jury duty.” \n\nI groaned and put a pillow over my head. “I’m going to start smoking to celebrate.”\n\n“Yeah right. You hack up a lung every time I dust the house.”\n\nI threw the pillow but made sure to miss. “Vape then.” \n\n“Do whatever you want, you’re eighteen now, Ethan. Just remember now I can legally evict you if you displease me. Come eat your breakfast or you’re going to be late for school.”\n\nMy mom strolled out of my room, humming. Even though I ended up with my dad’s lanky frame, everybody said I took after my mom the most. Same light eyes and dark hair, same twitchy smile, same morbid sense of humor. That last part was on full display when I stumbled out of the room and almost tripped over a walker mom had left in the hallway. There was a little red bow on the device and a card in my mother’s crisp, crawling handwriting.\n\n*Happy birthday my favorite and only son. Know that you are getting older, you’ll start to notice changes in your body. Primarily, your body will immediately start falling apart. Places you weren’t aware existed will begin to ache. So take this walker on your journey. ‘Cause you’re old.*   \n*Love Mom.*  \n*P.S.-OOOOooooolllllddd.*\n\nDad was already sitting at the table when I came down the hall. He was drinking coffee and reading an honest to God actual newspaper. And my mom called *me* old.\n\n“Happy birthday, Ethan,” dad said, glancing up from the paper. “Did you know that now you’re eligible for the draft now?”\n\n“So I’ve been told,” I said, sitting down. \n\nMom slid my breakfast in front of me, then sat a chocolate cupcake with lemon icing down next to it, and kissed the top of my head. \n\n“We love you, kiddo,” she said. “Happy birthday.” \n\nThere was a single candle burning on top. I blew it out, plucked it out, and licked the icing off of the bottom. \n\n“Lemon and chocolate,” my dad said, shaking his head. “Gross.” \n\n“Are you sure you’re not adopted?” mom asked. \n\n“Am I sure I…oh God. *Oh God*,” I put my hand to my mouth. “It would explain so much.” \n\nMom stuck out her tongue. “Shut up. Eat up. Suit up for school.”\n\nTwenty minutes later, I was showered, dressed, and heading out the door. Mom was getting ready for work while dad was cleaning up breakfast. He and I made eye contact as I climbed into my car. Dad winked. I smiled, pulled out of the driveway, and drove off toward the library to meet Hazel.\n\n“What’s up, grandpa?” Hazel asked when I arrived. \n\nShe was sitting on the low, brick retainer wall that separated the library’s parking lot from the tiny garden around the entrance. \n\n“You’re the third person to call me ‘old,’ this morning already,” I said, getting out of the car and stretching. “Be less original.”\n\nHazel hopped off the wall and tossed a slim package at me. I caught it and shook it.\n\n“I didn’t bother to wrap the thing,” she said. “Sorry.” \n\nI popped off the lid. Inside of the plain box was a clear plastic bag with something beige and vinyl looking inside. I flipped over the bag, same the label, and *hrmmpffd.* \n\n“Really?” I asked. “An inflatable sex doll?”\n\nHazel shrugged. “Better than a non-inflatable sex doll, right? That’s just…that’s just plastic sheeting, if you think about it.” \n\n“I try not to. Thanks.” I tossed the box in the back of my car. “I’ll treasure it forever.”\n\nHazel grinned and then walked over and gave me a hug. “Happy birthday, dork.”\n\nHer hair smelled like vanilla and lemon. Hazel was…well, Hazel was. She’d been my best friend since kindergarten when Joey DeMaco was pushing my face in the dirt under the swings and Hazel gave him a black eye for refusing to let me up. She was tall and slim and a nightmare on the soccer field. Her hair was blonde and her eyes matched her name and I’d loved her for about as long as I understood what that was.\n\nI pulled back from the hug first. “Does the doll have a name?” \n\n“I think that’s for you to decide. But she does look friendly!”\n\n“You’re not jealous?” I asked, trying to fix the kind of smile that was more *haha friendly joking* and less *your face makes me think of snow on Christmas*.\n\n“We had our time and I wouldn’t want to ruin the memory.”\n\n“We kissed once. On a dare at summer camp.”\n\nHazel dramatically fell towards me, forcing me to catch her. “You say that like it meant so little to you, darling. Whatever else, we’ll always have Camp Weasel Woods.”\n\n“That was *not* the name of the camp,” I said, gently pushing her so she was standing. “Let’s go see some turtles and then you can buy me lunch.”\n\nI followed Hazel into the library, breathing carefully, worried that she could hear my pulse slamming through my veins like a box of handgrenades tossed down a waterslide. \n\nThe rest of the day was a pleasant blur. There were turtles and books, tacos, a walk through the forest, a moment that maybe could have been a kiss but wasn’t, dinner back home with my parents, actual non-gag gifts including a laptop for college, a slice of cake, and then bed. My mom reminded me before turning in that I technically didn’t turn eighteen until 11:42 pm that night since I was a quote, “long ass delivery who interrupted lunch but then  had to be dragged out with forceps and W-D40 just before midnight.”\n\nAll-in-all, a very good day. \n\nMy head hit the pillow around 10 pm. I woke up sometime after, catapulted from a nightmare, sweating and shaking like I never have before. My room was dark and I scrambled for the light, not quite panicked but not able to stand much more darkness. My guts tightened when I clicked the switch but nothing happened. \n\nI tried again and again, trying to keep my breathing level. Then something unseen grabbed my wrist. The only reason I didn’t scream was because my throat locked up. What came out was a cross between a yelp and a wheeze. \n\nThe thing released my wrist and I slid back until I hit the headboard. My first instinct was to scream for my mom and dad but before I could, something spoke.\n\n*Happy birthday*, a voice said from the corner of my room. \n\nI couldn’t see anything in the blackness but the voice was almost familiar, like something I’d heard long ago but forgotten.\n\n*Who’s there?* I tried to ask but it came out as not much more than another wheeze. Still, the creature seemed to understand the question.\n\n*I don’t have long*, it told me. *The book will explain. Read the book. Learn from it. Protect it. Keep it.* **Keep. It.** *You can’t-*\n\nThe voice stopped and I got the impression it was listening or watching for something. There was a brief choking noise and a sound like a tree creaking against the wind and then my room felt empty. I reached for the lamp on my nightstand and this time it sparked to life. A 19-watt glow was never more welcome in the history of the world. My room was still draped with shadows but I could see there wasn’t anyone else visible.\n\n*Closet,* I thought, guts squeezing again. *Under the bed*. \n\n“Wait,” I said out loud, physically restraining myself from jumping from my bed. “Just wait. Breath. Another nightmare,” I closed my eyes for a long moment. “It was only-”\n\nI ran out of words when I saw the book propped up on my desk. It was large and red and I was absolutely sure it had not been there when I went to sleep. The thing radiated a strangeness, a sense of belonging elsewhere. It was like walking into a restaurant and seeing a car parked in the lobby. \n\nMy wrist throbbed, pulling my attention away from the book long enough for me to notice the marks. There were four slim lines, black as campfire ash, standing out against my skin. I turned my arm over and saw a fifth along with a smudge connecting them all.\n\nA handprint. It was already beginning to blister. \n\nThat’s when I finally screamed for my mom and dad.\n\nMy parents got the basics of my story when they came running from their bedroom and I met them in the hall. Both my thoughts and my words were…*scrambled* would be a charitable description, I guess, but they understood that I was upset so they brought me back to the kitchen and sat me down. \n\nAfter a glass of water and several darting glances at the hallway, I told them about the visitor and the book, then I showed them my arm. The handprint stood out like a corpse on a rug, though the burn was somehow already peeling down to new, pink skin. Neither of my parents said a word until I was finished. Then they shared a look, quick and quiet, and mom walked back towards my bedroom. For some reason, that scared me almost as much as the voice in my room.\n\n“Are you going to let her go alone?” I demanded. \n\nMy dad nodded. “Yeah. If there’s anything back there, your mom can handle it better than either of us, Ethan.”\n\nMom returned after a few minutes. She was holding the red book at arm's length like it was an animal she’d caught and needed to throw outside.\n\n“Damn,” my dad said. “I knew we should have told him.” \n\n“Maybe,” mom said, sitting down with us, gingerly placing the book in the middle of the table. “Probably. But you know my parents always said the book seemed half-aware of the world. If we talked about it, then it might-”\n\n“Hey, uh, the fuck?” I interrupted.\n\n“Don’t use that kind of language around your mom,” my dad said, but he wasn’t looking at me, only at the book.\n\n“Yeah, don’t fucking curse,” mom added. “...not counting tonight. Tonight, I get it.” \n\n“Can you both just please tell me what’s going on?” I asked. “You’re starting to freak me out.”\n\nThey shared that look again and dad stood up. He came back with three glasses and a bottle of wine.\n\n“Don’t tell child protective services,” he said, sliding me a nearly-full cup.\n\n“They don’t give a shit, he’s eighteen.” Mom drained her glass and poured another. She looked at me over the brim. “Ethan, this is going to sound crazy. You’re going to think your dad and I are messing with you. I promise we’re not. Understand?”\n\n“Yeah. Okay. Serious time. Game faces on. Just tell me.”\n\nMom sighed. “Ethan, the book on the table is a spellbook. And you’re a witch.”\n\nWe sat there in silence for a long time.\n\n“What?” I asked.\n\n“A witch,” mom repeated. “Like, I mean, like a *witch* witch. Magic. Spells. Cats. What are they teaching you in that school?”\n\n“But I’m…a dude.”\n\n“It’s a unisex thing,” dad chimed in. “Not really tied to, uh, anything else.” \n\nHe gestured vaguely.\n\n“Just your blood,” mom added. “From my side.”\n\nI picked at my burn. It didn’t hurt anymore but the peeling was starting to drive me nuts. I studied my mom and dad’s faces for a while, trying to figure out if this was all some weird joke to them. They looked back at me, eyes kind but anxious, and I felt another wave of fear. They were serious.\n\n“Oh shit,” I said, drinking some wine. “Oh actual shit.” \n\nMom put her hand over mine. “We’re sorry we never said anything. The book…sometimes it skips generations. It skipped my dad–your grandfather. It skipped me. Your father and I, we hoped that it was done and finished with your grandmother.”\n\nI finished the wine. “You could have told me anyway, though, right? Just in case.”\n\n“Not knowing any of it was our best chance at protecting you,” dad said. “The little bit your mom and I know about the book, if you talk about it, you might get its attention. It would be putting a target on your back.” \n\nI stared at the book sitting between us on the table. Up close, it looked innocent enough; red leather, about the size of a Bible but slimmer, with no lettering or designs of any kind on the cover. It didn’t seem so out of place now that I was close to it. In fact, just the opposite. It felt like family. It felt like home. I started to reach for it.\n\n“**No**,” my mom yelled, grabbing my arm. “It’s trouble and you have to get rid of it.” \n\nI felt a little flare of anger. “Wait. Just wait. Let’s slow the roll, okay? You’re telling me that magic is real, and…what? The book’s magic? I’m magic?”\n\n“Yes,” dad said, “but that book is dangerous.”\n\n“It belonged to your grandmother, right?” I asked my mom. “My great-grandmother? Why would you want me to get rid of it? Isn’t it like a family heirloom? Don’t you want to know more?”\n\nMom stared down into her wine glass. “I don’t, Ethan. Your grandmother told me stories, and showed me a few pages; she always hoped I’d inherit the book and I pretended I wanted to, just to make her happy. But I’ve never wanted it. It’s *wrong*. Don’t you feel it? There’s something unnatural.”\n\n“Sure,” I replied, “that’s what magic is though, isn’t it? You just said you’ve only seen a few pages so what if-”\n\nMy mom looked up at me and held my eye. “Ethan, honey, I don’t know how to explain it but I know that book is bad. Bad for the family, bad for you. Your grandmother loved that book more than her own kids or anyone else on this planet. I don’t want to ever see you become like that.”\n\n“There’s more,” dad said. “Tell him, Kara.”\n\nShe sighed. “My grandmother told me that if I did get the book after she was gone that I’d have to be ready to protect it. That certain people might come looking for it. Dangerous people.”\n\n“Who?” I asked. “And when?”\n\n“I don’t know the answer to either.” She finished her second glass of wine. “I’m sorry if your father and I have scared you. It’s just that we’re scared, too. This is a lot to put on somebody in the middle of the night. I know one thing for certain: it’s your choice. You have to be the one to accept the book or to get rid of it. And, honestly, if you do choose to reject it, I’m not sure what we do with it. But I promise we’ll figure it out together, okay? We love you.”\n\nMy dad nodded and gripped my shoulder.\n\n“I love you both, too,” I said, slowly. “But you said it’s my choice?”\n\nThat look again between my parents like they were speaking in some language no one else could hear. \n\n“Yes,” my mom replied after a pause. “It’s your choice. We can’t make it for you. Why don’t you…why don’t you take the book back into your room and-”\n\n“*Kara*,” my dad hissed.\n\nMom ignored him. “Take the book, read a *few* pages. All from the front. And promise that if you start feeling sick or anything weird happens, you’ll stop and call for us and we’ll come in like the fucking cavalry, okay?”\n\n“Are you sure?” dad asked. “At least, maybe he should read it here at the table.”\n\nMom shook her head. “I think he’ll want some privacy and I understand. And, the truth is, wherever he reads the book, it’s going to be equally as dangerous.”\n\nI suppressed a shiver at her last words but nodded like I figured a decisive, newly-minted adult would.\n\n“Thank you,” I said, scooping up the book. “Thank you for trusting me.”\n\nThat was nearly an hour ago. I’ve spent that time here in my bedroom with every light on trying to work up the nerve to open the book. I can hear mom and dad; they’re still in the kitchen, whisper-arguing so I can only catch a sentence here and there when I really focus. I think my dad wants to take the book outside to burn it. \n\nMy mom doesn’t think the book will let them, and even if it did, I need to be the one to make the choice or it’ll just keep coming back. \n\nChrist. \n\nNot how I pictured ending my eighteenth birthday. \n\nThe book is sitting on my desk and every fiber of me wants to open it. But a little voice in my head that sounds suspiciously like my mom keeps warning me it’s not too late to walk away, to pretend that the world is normal and boring and safe. \n\nBut I’m not sure that’s what I want. \n\nI’m writing this and posting it so that there’s at least a record out there for whoever will believe it. Just in case, you know…in case things go bad.\n\nI think I’m going to go read the first page, now.",

        "text": "It’s been a long time since I posted. If you forget about me and the rise and fall of the town I used to live, [you can read about it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/d3yj52/i_live_in_a_town_full_of_serial_killers_someone/).\n\nI’d been a wolf in sheep’s clothing for so long that I convinced myself I really was a sheep, but after years of torment living as a citizen, I finally snapped. \n\nA motorist cut me off on the highway and had the audacity to give me the finger. He was a young man in a pinstripe suit driving a Lexus. I could see him laughing through the car window as he flicked me off.\n\nA long-buried rage bubbled over. I knew the man thought he was better than me. That I deserved the ridicule he gave me. \n\nI followed him to his fancy house on a fancy block. Entering through an unlocked window on the second floor, I made sure he’d never laugh again.\n\nThe blood poured through my fingers and I felt alive again. A river that had run dry was now a raging torrent of water — the old me had returned with a vengeance.\n\nRiffling through the dead asshole's pockets, I snagged his keys and hopped into the Lexus. Sending my wife a series of disparaging text messages, I floored the accelerator and peeled off into the night. My family would never see me again — good riddance.\n\nSlaughtersburg had been destroyed by the Zodiac. His murderous rampage against his own kind had left it burning. His maniac army of children decimated the other killers — but I was determined to bring it back. He’d bested me in every way, but the blood had reinvigorated me. Not only would I bring the town back, but I’d also hunt down Zodiac and his followers. I wouldn’t just kill them, I’d make them wish they never lived.\n\nOn the drive to Wyoming, my blood lust rose. I made several stops to quench it. Those unlucky enough to stumble across my path were left rotting in the dirt. The closer I got to Slaughtersburg the stronger my urge to kill became. Everything the Zodiac had stolen from me started to return. I was a dark phoenix rising from the ashes.\n\nAfter days of driving, and countless bodies left in my wake, the town finally came into view. It was burnt husk. Almost every building had been burned to the ground; skeletons of timber and brick. All that was left standing was the General Store. Behind the store were dozens of unkempt graves marked with a wooden cross emblazoned with the symbol of the Zodiac. Even in death, he claimed ownership over them.\n\nDespite the death and destruction, I saw endless opportunities. The town was a fresh slate. I’d attract new residents and serve as their leader. Nothing would stop me, and if the Zodiac or his children returned, they’d rue the day.\n\nA crescent moon rose in the sky. With its pale light bearing down, I grabbed my supplies and sleeping bag and brought them into the store. For now, it would serve as my home base. I fell into a comfortable slumber. What others called nightmares I called sweet dreams — and I had them for the first time in years.\n\nI awoke in the middle of the night to the sound of a car engine revving loudly. I ran to the window and watched the Lexus speed off into the distance.\n\nBooming footsteps surrounded the store. A loud groan echoed from the darkness. I wasn’t frightened, I’d expected this. Zodiac had kept tabs on me before and I assumed he had eyes everywhere. Clutching a rifle I’d brought with me, I tip-toed towards the front window and slightly pulled back the curtain.\n\nA huge figure darted across the porch. Without hesitation, I unloaded several rounds. My aim was immaculate and I struck them with every shot. Whoever they were collapsed on the porch. Silence engulfed the night again.\n\nCarefully, I stepped outside to examine the body. A stench of rotting flesh hit me like a ton of bricks — a smell serial killers know all too well. Most found it putrid, but I found it comforting.\n\nThe body was massive and was laid out on its stomach. I could tell it was an older male, maybe 6’3 and well over 300 pounds. Keeping an eye out for other attackers, I struggled to roll him over. After several tries, I was successful.\n\n“What in the fuck?” I muttered to myself.\n\nI recognized that face. In fact, I’d know him well — but he’d been dead for years. It was John AKA the Cincinnati Maniac, one of the first victims of the Zodiac’s rampage. His skin was rotting away, flesh and muscle peeking through the skin. I pulled up his shirt and found the phrases carved into his chest all that time ago were still present — but they’d decayed along with his body.\n\nAll of a sudden, his left arm started to convulse. I backed away and gripped my gun. Something was wrong, very wrong. A banshee-like scream escaped his lips and John jumped to his feet. Bathed in the moonlight, I could see that he was a rotting corpse — but somehow moving. His eyes were milky white, teeth missing, and skin was too tight for his massive frame. He charged, wailing like the maniac he was. Before he could reach me, I put three rounds into his head.\n\nThe bullets blew the top of his head off, and he slumped into the dirt still twitching. Heart racing, I flew into the store and barricaded all of the doors. I gathered my weapons and waited. For the rest of the night, I didn’t sleep a wink. I paced around the different rooms, ready to defend myself — but nothing else ever came.\n\nWhen the dawn finally broke, I ventured outside. John’s body was gone. Muddy footprints covered the ground, crisscrossing back and forth.\n\nThe makeshift cemetery had been ransacked. Tire marks were everywhere and three of the graves had been dug up. It was a mess.\n\nAs I headed back inside to gather my thoughts, I spied a trail of blood leading to the back of the store. Scrawled sloppily on the wood siding was a message.\n\n“Welcome back. We’ve been dying to see you again.\"",

        "text": "\nMy name is David. I'm an engineer, and I own small business and I'm working hard to grow it and expand it. After all, that was the wish of my wife before she passed away.\n\nWe were blessed with Kelly 10 years ago, right before my wife was diagnosed with cancer. It was really tragic news for us. We've already structured and planned everything for 5 years ahead, and now it's all gone and shattered. But that's behind us now. I miss my wife a lot, but Kelly makes up for that emotional void she left in her own way.\n\nShe's a smart kid and picks up on things pretty quickly. I try teaching her some of the things I know in my own free time. It's because I don't trust the things kids learn in school these days. I've taught her to always be inquisitive and question everything she's told, until she does her own research. \nAnd I, carefully, taught her never to believe anything about spirituality, ghosts, souls, and demons as they are things people created in their mind to get some obligatory sense of morality in life. Prize and punishment, karma, and consequences of your actions. It may not be wise, you may think, but I didn't want my kid to grow up believing in ghosts and nonsense... but that day changed our lives, our whole beliefs.\n\n\"Daddy.. someone is watching me.\"\n\nThat morning, I woke her up as usual, I'd already prepared breakfast and called her down to eat. \n\"Don't forget to brush your teeth, sweetie\"\n\"You don't have to tell me, twice\" she smiled and ran to the bathroom.\nI finished changing, took my laptop, and headed to the door. \n\"C'mon, you'll be late for school.\" I called as I checked my watch. She came instantly and raced me to the car. I dropped her off at school and continued to my work. It was a hectic day, lots of meetings, lots of plans. \n\nI was really exhausted when I came back home. We had a meal, watched some tv and I told Kelly that we should go to sleep.\n\"You can go if you like, but I'll stay up for a bit then go to sleep. There's this really good show and I can't miss it.\" She told me with her puppy eyes. She sure felt mature, but she's still a child.\n\"Fine, but no more than 1 hour. It's almost 9, alright?\"\n\"Yepp! Thank you.\"\nI went to my room and threw myself in my bed and completely blacked out.\n\n\nThen I woke up to the sound of Kelly screaming. \n\"What the hell!..\" I looked at the clock, and it was 2 a.m.\nA rush of adrenalin filled my veins, and the blood filled my thigh muscles, I got up as fast as lightning and ran to her room, then opened the door.\n\"Kelly!\" I screamed. \"Are you alright?\"\nMy eyes couldn't quickly adjust to the darkness, but I could see she was in her bed.\n\"No...\" she said with a tone of sadness.\nI turned the lights on and sat on the bedside. \nI thought she probably had a nightmare or something, so I felt a bit relieved.\n\"What is it, baby? Tell me what's wrong.\"\nI put my hand on her shoulder.\n\n\"Daddy, someone is watching me.\" she said, almost whispering, as to not alarm whoever is watching her.\n'Fuck!' I thought to myself. The adrenalin rushed back in my veins. I looked around, but there was nobody.\n\"How do you know that, baby? I don't think anyone is watching you.\" I tried reassuring her.\n \"I saw one of the drop ceiling tiles move. It was _moved_ slightly from its place.\" she stressed the word 'moved' as she whispered.\n\n\"Which one is it? It can be easily explained. Though I'd hate to admit, but I think we have a mouse problem.\"\n\n\"Dad.. it was moved back after I screamed.\"\n\"Did you see it being moved?\"\n\"No, but I'm sure.\"\n\"Based on what evidence?\"\n\"Dad, you have to believe me.\"\n\"I believe you, baby. But, I'm sure it's a just a mouse. A classic case of mice in drop ceilings. I'll get some traps tomorrow and we'll place them up there.\"\n\nThe next evening, we came back home, had a meal, and got to work as we started putting traps in the drop ceiling.\n\"You know they love cheese, they'll be caught in a few hours at most, so don't be alarmed if you hear them squeaking.\"\n\"I won't. I hope you're right. I really do.\"\n\"What else could it be? The distance between the tiles and the roof is only 20 centimeters.\" I said as I finished setting the last trap and closed the tile.\n\"Why did you put four traps?\" Kelly asked me as I got down from the ladder.\n\"Well to better the odds of the mouse being caught, and, we don't know for sure if there's only one mouse. So I couldn't waste have more of your nights being ruined by risking it.\"\n\"Thank you, daddy.\"\n\"You're always welcome, baby\"\n\n \nI sent some emails and Kelly finished her homework then we both went to bed. \nI set the alarm to wake up early, checked my latest messages, and fell asleep.\n\n\"Daddy!\" \n\nI woke up to the sounds of repeated screaming. The traps must have caught it. I looked at the clock.. 2 a.m... 'bloody hell'\nI got up and ran to her room.\n\"Kelly!\" I turned the light switch but the lights didn't turn on. \n\"Kelly!\" I screamed trying to make out her outline on the bed.. she was there.\n\"Kelly, are you alright?\"\n\"No.. it's still watching me. It's watching _us_ right now.\" She cried.\n\"Where is it? Which tile?\" I searched with my eyes but my vision wasn't that helpful.\n\"In the corner..\" Kelly finally said with fear possessing her face.\nI looked at the tile, and it was indeed open. I started walking closer to it, but it moved. It closed.. it fuckin closed on its own. I jumped back as I heard multiple clicks in the ceilings then a loud thud. \nThose were the four traps I set. They all clicked at the same time, before the thud. The lights came on on their own and Kelly broke down crying. I could feel her fear myself. \n\n\"It's ok baby. Everything's gonna be fine\" I sat beside her as pulled her in and hugged her.\n\"How is anything fine? You saw. Everything is not fine.\" She cried endlessly and I just felt helpless. Paralysed. I didn't know what happened or what 'that' was.\n\n\"We'll figure it all out in the morning. For now, you can just come sleep in my room\"\n\"Aren't you gonna check the traps?\" She asked. \nI was, though its hard to admit, too scared to check them, but I couldn't relay that fear to her.\n\"I'll check them in the morning. I'm sure they caught nothing anyway. They clicked at the same time and their click was clean. Nothing was caught.\"\n\nWe went to my room and slept the rest of the night there. I was wondering, however, how was she awake at exactly 2 a.m when it happened? Same time as the other night.. 2 a.m.\n\nWe woke up together to the sound of my alarm. I told Kelly to go get ready while I check the traps and make breakfast.\nThe traps were indeed empty. I took a flashlight to check the upperside of the tiles for any signs at all. Any droppings, any animal hair. I needed something to make this whole thing..sensible, but it was futile.\n\nWe had our breakfast, got in the car and took off. \nI looked at her as she sat. She clearly still in that terrified state.\n\"Baby, are you feeling alright?\"\n\"Kind of.. but not really. I can't stop thinking about it.\"\n\"Say, how were you awake when that.. incident happened?\" I asked looking at her, her face expressions were changing.\n\"I don't think you'll believe me.\"\n\"Try me, then.\"\n\"I heard a voice in my sleep. It was calling my name and wanted me to wake up.. then I saw a pair of eyes in my dreams fixed on me. When I woke up, my gaze was on that one open tile\" she said as the tears started welling up in her eyes.\n\"Hey, hey.. it's ok, I'll figure it out. You're not making it any easier but I'm sure there's an explanation for all of that\" I tried reassuring her.\n\"Maybe you should just start believing that some things can't be explained.\" She said and her tone was becoming angry.\n\"Nope. Science always finds a way to explain  everything. Just have faith in me\"\n\"Alright.\"\n\"I would never let anything bad come near you, kelly. You know that\"\n\"I love you, dad.\"\n\"I love you too, baby.\" \nI dropped her off and went on to my work.\nAs the day was about to finish I decided to get a camera with a mic, and a motion sensor.\n\n.\n.\n.\n\nPart 2 coming, soon...",

        "text": " \n\nWhen I was younger, I was one who indulged in music, parties, and various intoxicating substances that would enhance those experiences. I count myself among the many who allowed their hedonism to run wild with enthusiasm. It came then as no surprise that I found myself attending festivals with groups of friends who, at the time, shared the same reckless mindset as me.\n\nFor the record – and I say this without pride – I am experienced in drug-taking. While I don’t particularly regret it, there was one experience that halted my drug use altogether. At the time, my fellow partygoers scoffed at this decision, since I didn’t see any worth trying to explain to them what had happened. They would most likely have chalked it all up to a substance-induced hallucination. I’ve had such hallucinations in the past, which tend to be a result of sleep deprivation and frequent redosing. I can safely say none of them compared to the raw reality of this experience.\n\nIt was the start of summer, and my friend Rachel had informed me that a group of them were heading to an EDM festival a couple states over. I’ll refrain from divulging the location, as I feel I have already revealed too much by specifying my home country, but I was quick to take up the invitation. Hastily, I booked a ticket from the third batch release and began making preparations for the trip. It was a three-day-weekend festival, so tents and other supplies were required. Of course, I was readily prepared with all the required equipment, the festival most certainly not being my first.\n\nI’ll spare you the long car journey to the location, but we could barely contain ourselves. With me were my buddies Chris, Robbie and, of course, Rachel. We hadn’t been to this one before and we vigorously discussed many topics, including how we were going to smuggle in our pills and powders. I, myself, opted to bring MDMA powder (often coined “ecstasy”, when in pill form), and a few LSD blotters, planning to candy-flip for the duration. I stuck to the ever-true “ballsing” method, which is exactly as it sounds – stuffing your baggies into your boxers before going through security.\n\nFor people like us, the place was pretty much Nirvana. It was set up in a rural area, bordering hilly woodland on one side. At least a dozen enormous festival tents were set up in a semi-circular fashion, all playing EDM, but with different artists in the line-up. Paradise, at the time.\n\nThe first day went by in a blur. I was quick to dose up on MDMA, which kept me dancing through 8 hours of bliss. I don’t recommend redosing, but damn if it isn’t hard to avoid when everyone around you is doing just that. Peer pressure at its finest. We’d joined with another group of like-minded individuals by the end of the day, and we decided we’d camp together. Robbie had the wonderful idea to have a campfire, but with the rules and regulations we’d have to go somewhere a little more removed.\n\nWe decided to pack up our tents and move over into the woods that bordered the property. I was sceptical at first but we came across a really nice spot at the top of a hill, from which the terrain descended and gave us a clear view of the treetops across the forest. Pretty much the perfect spot to watch the fiery sunset commonly associated with summer evenings, whilst also being out of eye and earshot from any uptight security personnel.\n\nAfter setting our tents up, drinking began without hesitation. The sun was getting low, and all in all I felt great, despite the onset of a comedown headed my way. We were able to gather up twigs and sticks fairly quickly, being in a forest, and used spent beer packaging to get the fire going.\n\n“Hey, want a bump?” Chris said, who I was sat next to on a fallen log near the campfire. He offered a bag of shardy powder which I immediately recognised as ketamine… how could I have refused? It was such a perfect moment I couldn’t put down a little dissociation.\n\n“You even have to ask?”\n\nA wide grin grew on his face and he pulled out his car keys to scoop the powder. He sniffed a generous heap of the stuff before handing it to me. I crushed the bag a little, something Chris had forgotten to do beforehand, then took out a miniature, snow-covered mountain and practically inhaled it. I tasted the drip a little, but it wasn’t so bad in comparison to what I’d been consuming earlier in the day. I felt it immediately.\n\n“Woah, holy shit dude. Feels like something they’d tranquilise a fuckin’ rhino with,” I said, words already becoming jumbled and merged together.\n\n“I know, right? Didn’t even open it earlier, been saving it for now.”\n\nRobbie, eagle-eyed for intoxicants, practically teleported onto the log next to Chris. Probably just a side-effect of the drug, but his sudden manifestation caused me and Chris to erupt in laughter. Robbie acted jokingly offended at this,\n\n“Didn’t know there was an isomer that made you turn into an asshole!” he chuckled.\n\n“Yeah, it’s called dickhead-amine,” Chris said, barely containing his giggles.\n\n“Well, I’m feeling a little too respectful right now, mind sharing?”\n\n“Of course,” replied Chris, passing the paraphernalia to Robbie.\n\nJust then, a different feeling swept over me. It wasn’t a feeling of nausea, or anxiety, but it was like the late-day sunlight was coming in pulses. Like, I could \\*feel\\* the rays, as if they had weight and substance to them, increasing and decreasing in intensity as they swept across my face. I’d never felt anything like it from this type of drug before, so at the time I thought it was just the combination of whatever other chemicals were coursing through my veins in that moment. “Tripping out”, as one might call it.\n\nI chose to dismiss it and continue partying. Someone from the other group had brought out their speaker, a heavy and chunky thing that blasted bass into our bones. With the others dancing about the camp, I opted that one final re-dose of MDMA couldn’t hurt.\n\nI’m not sure how long I flailed about in joy for, but when I went to sit down on the log for a breather the horizon was already burning with a deep orange.\n\n“Need a cold one?” asked Robbie, who’d somehow pulled off the same teleportation trick from earlier.\n\n“Wha- shit dude, you got me again!”\n\n“Heh, just one of my natural skills. You want one or not?”\n\n“Yeah, yeah, crack me one,” I gasped, the exhaustion from the day finally catching up to me. Robbie opened a can and handed it to me, though it wasn’t as cold as he’d promised.\n\nWe sat there chatting for a while, gazing over the flittering leaves below which reflected the dusk light. It felt serene, and I knew the money spent was not wasted.\n\nI became distracted at some point by a barely audible sound, somewhere off in the distance. Again, I thought nothing of it – I wasn’t a stranger to the hallucinations brought on after heavy drug use, and I’d seen much worse. But the sound wasn’t diminishing after some time, so I strained my ears to see if I could make out anything in particular. A light breeze had picked up which made it more difficult, but after a short while I could definitely make something out.\n\nMachinery. That was the first word that came to my mind in an attempt to describe what I was hearing. The heavy clanking and whirring of fuel-powered mechanisms operating on a building site. I didn’t even notice Robbie’s absence at this point until I looked over, and saw there were only a few of us outside now, two making out messily, and Chris and Robbie still dancing.\n\nI sat and listened for a few minutes. I could swear that the sounds were getting closer, but they were still too distant to be certain. I checked the time, then became a little confused – 10PM. I glanced back up to the sky; the sun hadn’t even touched the horizon yet, but the sky around had definitely grown darker, with stars becoming apparent. A thought rose in my mind, \\*this shit has me TRIPPING\\*. This was absolutely true, but the whole situation just seemed wrong in some way.\n\nAt that moment, I shifted my gaze downwards to see Rachel standing below on the slope of the hill, facing away from the camp. Squinting in confusion, I called out,\n\n“Hey Rache, that you? What are you doing down there?”\n\nThere was no response, not even a flicker of movement to suggest she’d registered my call. I grew concerned, thinking she’d taken too much, and I heaved myself up off the log to go and help her back up the hill.\n\nRachel was standing with the strangest posture. Her shoulders were slumped so low it was like they had been dislocated, and her head lulled backwards. I picked up the pace a bit, growing more worried at her condition, when in all my carelessness I caught my foot on a root protruding from the dirt.\n\nI tripped head-over-heels, almost comically, and rolled down to the bottom of the hill in a tumble of dust and twigs. Luckily, it wasn’t too high or steep, but it was far enough that upon looking back up, the firelight was but a faint orange haze which leaked over the brim of the hill.\n\nI was too shaken to realise at first, but after observing my surroundings I could see that Rachel was nowhere to be found. Surely she wasn’t so fucked up as to not notice the mess that I was rolling right past her. But then, where was she? No one stood above me on the slope, and I couldn’t see anyone else around me.\n\nI realised then that this was one of those stupid comedown hallucinations. I was pissed, seeing my white trainers now coated in a fine layer of brown dust, along with the rest of my clothing. Still, even with the realisation, I found little comfort sitting on my ass, alone, in a quickly darkening forest.\n\nI picked myself up off the ground and dusted my body down, but before turning to make my way back to camp, something caught my eye. The trees now blocked much of the sky, but the sun was *still there*, seemingly in the exact same place as earlier.\n\nFrom somewhere beyond the treeline above, there were these… lines, reaching upward toward the sun. Very thin and barely visible, but they became more apparent the longer I stared. They moved in the most peculiar way, like hanging cables or tubes under the influence of gravity, swaying in curved arcs and terminating at the sun’s edge. I wasn’t so quick to credit this to some crazy visuals, however. I looked on in curiosity as more and more of these tubes began attaching themselves to the sun.\n\nThe sun, which was… brighter, now? It was a dim orange previously, as sunsets tend to be, but now it looked more like it would during dawn. Almost dazzlingly bright. I thought it had taken on a faint bluish hue, but with the drugs messing with my visual processing I didn’t dwell on that idea long.\n\nI willed myself to turn away and head back up the hill. My friends were probably worried with me gone, though they could equally have been completely unaware of my disappearance. I crawled back over the top to see only Chris and Robbie sitting near the dimming campfire.\n\nMy knee fell on and snapped a twig, leading Chris to look over to the noise. He visibly jumped when he saw me, then fell back into confusion as he glanced between me and Robbie, waiting for someone to speak.\n\n“What?” I shouted over, unsure of what had them in such bewilderment.\n\n“\\[my name\\]? Man, stop fucking around, I thought you were some homeless dude or something,” said Chris, letting out a sigh of relief after understanding the situation.\n\n“What are you talking about? I went down there to get Rachel, she was- wait, where is Rachel?”\n\n“She went to bed, like, 20 minutes ago. And *you* turned in, like, an hour ago!” said Robbie.\n\n“Wh- Robbie, I’ve been down in the forest for, uh,” I checked my watch. 12AM, “two… hours?”\n\nChris and Robbie didn’t reply, instead looking between each other with a tinge of fear. Without a word, Chris stood and walked over to my tent, which upon opening he found to be empty.\n\n“What the fuck? We both saw you go into your tent and zip it up,” Chris exclaimed, worry evident in his tone.\n\n“Man, I think we’re all just real fucked up,” I laughed, dry of humour. They grunted in agreement, but I couldn’t help but think of what Chris just said. Had they *both* hallucinated my likeness at the same time?\n\n“Hey, \\[my name\\], you alright? You’re sweating buckets,” asked Robbie, and he hurled a bottle of water in my direction, “you haven’t forgotten about hydration, have ya?”\n\nNow that he said it, I did feel strangely hot. I grabbed the bottle and downed it in a few seconds, before I stood back up and walked over to the communal log-bench. We didn’t talk much after that, but instead hit Robbie’s bong a few times to calm the nerves. Stupidly, it hadn’t occurred to me at the time to ask if they also saw what I saw - I was simply too enamoured by the situation. Both of them went to bed after, but I told them I wanted to sit outside a bit longer to relax.\n\nThe relaxation didn’t come, though. To my dismay, the sun ***still*** hadn’t set, refusing to budge from its perch above the horizon, and I could again hear those mechanical sounds from earlier, echoing across the valley. There was no doubt this time – they were louder, clearer. Which, logically, meant that whatever was producing the sounds had moved closer.\n\nI was still under the impression of some grand hallucination, when I heard a voice. No, that doesn’t do it justice. I couldn’t make out any words, but I somehow knew inherently that I had heard a voice amongst the distant clanging, not as a separate entity, but as if the industrial soundscape was synchronising itself in such a way that the combined din formed a low, metallic voice. Again, no words were apparent, instead a disordered mumbling that rang in between my ears.\n\nI noticed then, the most bizarre sight yet. Despite the obvious abnormality of the pale sun hanging in the dead of night, I looked closer to see these faint lines drifting on its surface, forming an array of patterns which were slightly dimmer than the rest of the sun.\n\nFocusing more intensely now, it was… how do I even describe it? I’d tripped countless times before, but it looked nothing like the colourful swirling visuals I was used to. It was like I was looking at an enormous, infinitely complex fractal, unfolding in writhing patterns of brighter and dimmer light.\n\nThe longer I stared, the further the noises synchronised themselves, building until I undoubtedly heard the words:\n\n“This one.”\n\nIt sounded so articulated, there was no way my mind had just conjured it up from the random combination of sounds. It came in waves, like an underlying tinnitus wavering in intensity in such a way as to form those exact words. The sky was now a black ocean dotted with its stars, heavily contrasting the intense ball of cold light I saw before me. The heat was clearly noticeable now as I found myself wiping sweat out of my eyes to continue looking.\n\nI made the decision to smoke some more weed and drink some more beer, in hopes I could knock myself out and go to sleep. This was all getting too weird, even for a partying vet like myself. I packed a bowl and took a long, slow draw. As much as I didn’t want to look, my eyes were magnetised to the concerning sight before me.\n\nThe squirming lines were wider now, and much, much dimmer, more of a dark grey than anything. I rushed to down a few beers, and halfway through my third a loud “clank” made me jump and drop the can to the ground.\n\nFurrowing my brow as if to ask the world around me to just stop whatever it was doing, I looked up one last time to see the patterns had ceased all movement, and were now almost black. Gaping. To my horror, they began to move again. No, the lines remained motionless, but the darkness within was writhing and… started to fall.\n\nSwathes of tiny black shapes were pouring out of the sun right before my eyes, down into the trees below. At this point in my drug-induced delusion, my faith in the fact that this was a hallucination was dwindling. They kept pouring out, until I could see trees in the distance starting to shudder, leaves dancing about like a great stampede of \\*something\\* were shaking them. I didn’t have the conviction to control myself anymore, and I started hyperventilating. The swaying treetops were getting closer, and a faint, horrible chittering noise became apparent, like how I imagined insects would sound if they were capable of laughter. The trees’ movement must have been less than half a mile away now.\n\nI was paralysed. Whether I was now in full-fledged delirium or not wasn’t my concern at the time – my eyes did not seem to betray me otherwise. Whatever were moving through the trees below were moving fast, and within 20 seconds they were within full earshot. The sounds coming from the darkness became unbearable, like nails scraping my eardrums, and then… nothing. Movement ceased and silence fell.\n\nThe fire still flickered dimly, preventing my eyes from adjusting to the swirling darkness weaving throughout the tree trunks downhill, and the crackling of the embers disturbed the thick, heavy silence permeating the camp. Suddenly, the sound of a twig snapping somewhere to my left broke my petrified state and my head snapped to the direction it had come from.\n\nRachel stood at the edge of the fire’s illumination. No, calling that thing Rachel would be an insult to her very existence. It looked like something with no knowledge of human physiology had attempted to rebuild her using individual body parts, its limbs constantly shifting and readjusting themselves in a fluid manner like it was trying to correct itself.\n\nIt took a step forwards, jolting me off of the log and onto my back. Rolling backwards, I pushed myself back off the ground, but it had not moved further. Instead, it opened its mouth, or, mouths – I couldn’t tell how many it had at one time, constantly splitting and merging, combining and creating new holes. I couldn’t see anything inside, just darkness. It began emitting these… vile, clicking and ringing noises which rose and fell, never finding a tone to settle on.\n\nAnd, just like the sounds before, they started to synchronise into something semi-coherent. Whatever this was didn’t seem to be able to copy Rachel’s voice. Still, I could not make out any clear words. Imagine someone who doesn’t understand English hearing the language spoken. That is how I felt listening to this abomination, like an auditory stroke.\n\nIt appeared to give up after another moment and went quiet. Its “mouths'' instead began multiplying, growing and expanding over its skin like Swiss cheese, until nothing that resembled a human remained. My eyes grew painful trying to focus on whatever stood in my presence. It… nothing in my vocabulary can accurately describe the being. I can’t really even remember how it looked; as hard as I try, the form was just mentally incompatible. I can recall dark lines and shapes, both sharp and organic, shifting in certainly more than three dimensions. There looked to be something peering out from the spasmatic blackness, something like monochrome faces all overlapping, separate but at the same time as one. They gazed out at me with an expression of intense sorrow, lips parting as if to talk, yet any words were snuffed out by that incomprehensible void.\n\nAfter what felt like hours, but was probably seconds, it started to move again. And, as it moved, it began to take on a new form. Skin, hair, nails, fabric, all slipping and sliding, until… the logo on my polo shirt became visible, emerging from underneath a dark fold. While this happened, movement stirred from the darkness below, countless shifting footsteps disturbing the forest floor.\n\nI wish I could describe further, and in more detail, but that was the breaking point for me. I dropped the still-smoking pipe, spun around and ran in the opposite direction. I ran and ran onto the festival grounds, past a colourful sea of tents and drunk onlookers, before slipping on a cold puddle of someone’s vomit, and falling face-first into the trash-littered ground.\n\nI awoke in a medical support tent at 11.30AM. Looking down at my arms, they appeared terribly sunburnt, and the sight caused the accompanying pain to flare up over my skin. I winced and looked around to absorb my surroundings. A staff member came over to me then, a kind-looking middle-aged man, with a bottle of some sort of lotion and another of water.\n\n“Hey, kid. How you feeling? You got some terrible burns there, forget your sunscreen?” he asked.\n\n“I- uh- y-yeah, lost it somewhere yesterday,” I lied.\n\n“You gotta be more careful with that, kid. You can get skin cancer from it, y’know.”\n\n“Yeah, thank you. Um, what’s that bottle you have there?”\n\n“Oh, this? Just something to ease the skin. Trust me, you won’t wanna leave here without it.”\n\nThe burning that arose as I reached out for the bottle confirmed his statement. My skin was the colour of a sunset, and felt as hot as the sun itself. The thing is, I *did* put on sunscreen, multiple times throughout the day, and I don’t burn easily anyway. When we were at the camp I felt absolutely fine. Well, before whatever happened that made me flee in terror.\n\nChris and Robbie were waiting for me outside, faces carved with sombre looks. They had with them all our things packed up, tents, leftover drinks, all of it. My heart dropped when they told me that they’d found Rachel’s tent empty in the morning along with mine. A search team was called onto the site to scour the woods for any evidence of where she could have gone, but their efforts had thus far been fruitless. Though, I had a feeling they would not find even the slightest indication that she had ever been there, bar her tent and belongings.\n\nRobbie insisted on staying behind to help with the search while Chris and I made the journey home. The leather seats in Chris’ car were a painful nuisance, sticking to my clammy, sunburnt skin at the slightest touch. I didn’t have the energy to complain, though. We arrived back at my house and called Robbie with a dwindling hope which, for me, had already dried up completely, but of course, no news had surfaced.\n\nRachel was never found. Even after the case was extended into multiple jurisdictions, any trail the police may have had soon ran cold. I haven’t told my friends, but I know now that Rachel is undoubtedly lost forever to something beyond our comprehension. After all, how could they believe me, given our drug use that night? Grieving is one thing, but grieving knowing you can’t tell the truth about what happened is a different beast altogether.\n\nWhile I was changing my clothes that day, I noticed something peculiar. My blue polo no longer held the embroidered brand logo on its left breast as it once had. I still shudder at the implications of what may have happened if I’d stuck around any longer to find out.\n\nI don’t participate in that life anymore, really. I still see those friends, but on the craziest of nights I never go further than drinking or smoking, usually not in combination. Probably for the best, anyway.\n\nThose words linger in my head, still. “This one.” Were they referring to me? I really don’t have any rational explanation for what happened that night, what those beings were, their motives… needless to say, the image of that pale sun unfolding is forever etched into my memory.\n\nAll I can say now is that if the sun stops setting, and hangs there like a glazed-over eye, don’t stay to see it open up. Don’t be brave, or curious. Just get as far as you can from wherever you find yourself – or be taken somewhere our minds were never intended to witness.",

        "text": "Anyone knows about the Powerpuff girls show right? It’s about a show where three girls named Blossom who is the leader, Bubbles who is the laughter and Buttercup who is the muscle that fights crime on a day to day basis with Mojo, Princess Morbucks, HIM and well you get the idea. There is also The Rowdyruff Boys that fans keep bringing up about with Brick, Boomer and Butch like why can’t they get along or something like that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBesides they always ship The PPG with RRB which I always find a a bit odd. Well there is an episode, or was supposed to be till it was locked away or thrown out. My friend worked there as an intern when he heard about this episode.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt started as a rumor during his time there when the creator of the show, Craig McCracken, said he was gonna see a new review of the episode he was told about and came out a few minutes later looking like he saw a ghost.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen he was questioned about this, he refused to answer and just walked away. Before he did however, he told the people in the room to lock that thing up and never let it see the light of day in a more disappointed tone. I think some people managed to peek at whatever he was watching since the rumors said, ‘I think one of the Rowdyruff boys did something.” or, \"Was it Boomer or Bubbles that did something?”.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course they were rumors so my friend didn’t mind but he still was curious. Apparently to my friend, he went to a room full of episodes that were scrapped, cut and removed and he managed to find it. He then put up a computer in the room where he downloaded the episode on the computer on a mp4 format and put it in his Media player to put it on my computer and play the contents(This was back in 2004.) And it was just called sadboomer oddly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow he did it with no one watching is beyond me, but what is known is that we are gonna see what the contents of this episode holds. My friend went to my home so we could watch it but most of the video was corrupted. Since I know how to fix a video, I fixed it mostly since there was too much to work on so we had to watch what was on the video.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe video started out with a normal intro like any other episode except with a few glitches here and there. Then the Title, ”Hurtful words” came on screen but there were no flashes of the Powerpuff girls flying in the screen, it just faded in as the pop music that usually plays in the title cards was replayed with just a slow piano music piece as if we’re gonna see something sad. It continued to fade into the opening credits but the names were absent as if it was unfinished as the last card just had no names at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Episode starts with the usual, “The city of Townsville!” then cuts to a calm street with people walking and cars driving while the narrator continues, \"Has been pretty calm lately this past week.” It then cuts to different scenes of people doing different activities in the street as the narrator continues saying, \"As citizens like workers, bosses, joggers, shoppers…” It went on until it cut to Boomer just having a drink while walking as the narrator finishes by saying, \"And even villains just taking a stroll in the day!”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoomer then finishes his drink as he just throws it on the street and steals another from a random person as the Narrator then says, ”Well…mostly strolling.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe scene just continues as Boomer drinks from someone’s cup that he’d stolen just to at least do something while his brothers are away doing well whatever they are doing. He then bumps into a girl with long hair over her eyes as she falls to her knees as Boomer just keeps walking. “Hey!” The girl said, \"Watch where you’re going!” Boomer looks back at her, mockingly saying, “Oh I’m sorry! I didn’t see you there!” He then casually laughs as he walks over and snatches a snack from her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Hey, give that back!” The girl then shouted. “Or what? Gonna beat me up?” Boomer says in an amused and mocking tone as she stands up. “No.” She says offscreen as Boomer just looks at her. “Yeah I am sooooo scared by a stupid gi-” Boomer suddenly paused and jumped a bit at something offscreen. It then cuts the girl’s face. Her hair no longer covers her face as her eyes are shown. Her eyes were oddly bloodshot as we looked at the screen more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe looked at Boomer with mild anger in her eyes as she just said, \"But I should be mindful of what I’m doing if I were you.” Boomer then awkwardly looks around as if she was talking to someone else and then looks back to the girl just gone as if she was never there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoomer starred as the spot for a while with a weirded out expression. \"Freak” he said as he rolled his eyes in annoyance as he walked off with a stolen snack and a stolen drink. Me and my friend both look at each other with confusion both asking ourselves, “What was that about?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe scene continues as Boomer walks for a bit until he spots Brick and Butch fighting The PowerPuff Girls. He then literally throws the drink and snack aside as he flies to fight the girls as he says, \"Finally! About time!” since he was waiting for something to happen. He then meets them as they ask him where he was. He then says that he was just taking a stroll as they looked at him with disgust.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey then yelled at him for not being there with them when the Powerpuff Girls were fighting them for about an hour and Boomer did not know this. Boomer then said he’ll make it up as he charges head first and hits the leader several times before getting pummeled by them as there was a montage of him getting beaten up till he fell in an alleyway with a bruised face with a black eye and had messy hair.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe tried to apologize but was cut off with Brick yelling at him of how he’s an idiot for not only leaving them alone with the girls and getting beaten by the girls. Brick then starts to verbally insult him so much that he starts tearing up as Brick smacks him in the head as Butch just laughs at Boomer’s misfortune. We were shocked while watching Boomer just getting abused like this, especially by his brothers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBlossom, Buttercup and Bubbles fly in frame and question what in the world are they doing to Boomer. Both have an argument about why you shouldn't hurt your brother before they begin to fight again. Bubbles did try to ask whether he was ok or not before she was pulled into the fight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoomer then looked at the sky with the fight taking place before flying offscreen. It then cut to Boomer’s expression and he looked like he was about to cry as he just walks off somewhere.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe then see the fight still going on and both teams are getting tired. Both stopped as Bubbles pointed out the Boomer isn’t with them or at all since they fought for 2 hours. apparently Bubbles has been try to get their attention but no one listened till now. The Girls are a bit worried while the Boys were not concerned.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoth have an argument again till finally Bubbles suggested we should find him since they didn’t see him after what happened in the alleyway. Both agree pretty much but Brick is still less concerned about but still agrees to. Both then try to come up with a plan of how to find him quickly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe scene then fades to Boomer walking alone on a street with a gloomy expression while sad music plays in the background. A small montage plays with Boomer going to a candy shop, basically eating loads of sugar, punches a hole through a vending machine to get some drinks, then lays down in an alleyway as it cuts to black.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then asks, “Is this what Craig saw?” To be honest, this is what he probably saw. The scene then cuts to night where the girls are in their room, wondering where Boomer would be. Bubbles and Buttercup are concerned about Boomer while Blossom is a bit worried about it but is sure that Boomer might be found by the police.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis conversation goes on for a minute or two till it cuts back to Boomer walking in the street looking depressed, messy and…drunk? It turns out that the drinks Boomer stole from a vending machine earlier was actually beer cans since he is stumbling and is slurring with his words a bit as he rants on about how he was bullied by his brothers everyday no matter what he did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlus he ate a lot of sugar he was also jittery but more mad then happy as you see in cartoons where a character eats sugar (Mac from Foster's home for imaginary friends for example.).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs he ranted on of what he might do to his brothers when he gets the chance, the Narrator suddenly responds saying, “Boomer I think you might need to think about this and-” he was then cut off with Boomer telling him to shut up as he stares at the screen as we just realized that the Narrator was listening this whole time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe continued to rant until the screen glitched for a few seconds and came back to Boomer just staring at the screen. We were both caught off guard because of how fast it happened. The first thing we noticed was his eyes. His eyes were replaced with what looked like photos eye's placed on his eyes which were just black.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote that this creeped the hell out of me and my friend when we first saw this. It was like this for what seemed like a few minutes, just nothing but staring, no music, no sound, just silence. It glitches again and comes back to the scene of where it was before. Boomer stops ranting and looks down with tears in his eyes as we get to see flashbacks of previous episodes with the Rowdyruff boys having fun wrecking stuff and hanging out like brothers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe flashbacks suddenly end as Boomer just looks up and says, \"Where did it all go wrong?\" and then after a while, he realized that his life was nothing more than just a \"Punching bag\" for everyone. As he made that realization, a smirk appears on his face and starts to laugh, and laugh and laugh uncontrollably. The scene suddenly cuts to black for a few seconds before cutting back to the Powerpuff girl’s house at night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe get to see Boomer almost tripping on his way to a door to the lab since he drank beer and ate candy which I don't think doesn't blend well and he also was kind of giggling a bit when he entered. When he gets there and places his hand on the knob, he then looks back still looking quite tipsy. The scene shifts in the dark living room where we could’ve sworn we saw a figure around the corner and faded away leaving Boomer worried. Boomer opens the door and walks down the stairs still tipsy with the beer he stole earlier.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe looks around for a bit till something appears on the screen for a split second so we pause it and rewind back to what it was. It was a message saying, “What are you doing here?” We looked at each other confused over what it meant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe resumed to Boomer still looking around until another message popped up, this time it stayed on the screen longer for us to read. It said, “You know you shouldn't be here.” We were really creeped out at this point but I thought it had something to do with Boomer being in the lab without permission or something like that but who is saying this to them?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe scene continues as Boomer walks up to the screen as we begin to see his eye turn to Bloodshot as he moves closer to the screen. He then looked up as the scene cuts to a shelf with Boomer looking up. As he reached to grab it, a sound can be heard as Boomer suddenly stops and turned to see what made the noise. We both got to see something around the corner but it was so dark in this scene so we couldn’t tell. Boomer continues to stare at the figure for a while before asking, \"H-hello? Who's there?” We cut back to the figure up close but it was still too dark.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly another figure popped into frame emitting a high pitched screech making us both jump as Boomer was scared out of his skin, put his back on the shelf. There were loads of figures, all of which were so terribly drawn and deformed we couldn’t even make out what they was supposed to look like, Although it did look like some of them were the girls and Boomer's brothers. Several messages appeared on screen and all of them said terrible things as the whispers grew louder and Boomer covered his hands on his face while crying, clearly terrified.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe figures and whispers then slowly fade away leaving an empty room with Boomer shaking of what he just saw. Boomer then looks up again as the scene cuts to a object he was reaching for which has a big red X on it as the scene gets covered in static.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe scene then cuts to Boomer walking in the opposite direction in the streets as he carries the flask from the previous scene with him. He also has a smirk on his face, but it looked forced, not to mention his eyes were slightly bloodshot since he was crying from the last scene. As he walked, the whispers from before appeared again and the figures appeared behind objects.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt looked like Boomer was being tormented by hallucinations from what happened and his realization. It was like this until he reached a building as he flew up to the top. There was what sounded like the wind in the background save for the whispers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs he reached his smile dropped to a frown and teared up even more. The whispers were deafening in this scene as it continued. And then without warning, he chugged the flask in one motion and threw it down as the whispers went silent completely as he drank it but the wind still played.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few seconds pass and he starts convulsing as dark brown spots appear around him as his skin turns pale. Me and my friend knew instantly what he just drank, he just drank Antidote X. He then falls off the roof from the pain and starts crying loudly. And then a few seconds later, he hits the ground with a sickening splat as the scene suddenly stops and repeats for a while. \"Oh my God...!\" exclaimed my friend who was horrified at the scene presented before us, Did Craig McCracken really see this? The wind sounded more distorted as his face faded in the screen, horribly mangled.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd then everything suddenly stops. Everything was white except for Boomer’s entire outline was just blue. There was soft orchestra music in the background as he opens his eyes and looks around confused and dazed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe then looks in front of him to a familiar figure. The figure looked like Bunny from the episode Twisted Sister. The Bunny ghost looked at him with some concern and sadness as it asked him if what he did was really worth it. He opened his mouth to answer but stopped, frowned and looked down. The music stopped and the screen cut to black as Boomer said one word, \"No.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was just silent for a while until we started hearing Bubble's voice calling for Boomer with her sisters and his brothers. As the voices drew closer Boomer’s face fades in with blood on his left side of his face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBubbles then suddenly screams as Boomer’s left face distorts on screen. The screen comes back to a disgusting sight. It was Boomer, or just his mangled corpse laying on the street. The left side of his face is torn, his limbs were broken, just everything about him was broken. I let out a loudest gasp then I ever did in my whole life. My friend was just shocked at the scene.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a while, a figure in the shape of Boomer started to rise above Boomer with those same eyes we saw before Boomer went to the girl’s house. I immediately suspected to be Boomer’s soul that looked over his corpse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe screen cuts out to a black screen again but with only the sounds of police sirens. And then a message popped up saying, ”1 day later.” before fading out. We then get to see Mojo and Him in Mojo’s lair just sitting and looking down. Both have a conversation of how they would have known something like this would have. Mojo then asks, \"Were we good creators?” Him tells him yes and they did everything they could.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next scene shows what appeared to be a hospital with Bubbles, Buttercup and Butch. Buttercup and Butch were having a fight over who’s fault it is that caused Boomer to die and Bubbles just looked traumatized. The argument lasted for a few minutes till it finally cuts to another scene. Though I did see something around the corner during the argument.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe last scene shows Brick on the building looking over the city. Blossom soon joins him and asks how he's doing. Brick really regrets what happened because he was angry about fighting the girls that his anger harmed someone, especially someone important. Both share their condolences and have a meaningful conversation as Brick contemplates if he wants to be a good guy maybe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe screen then plays the normal ending scene but cuts abruptly afterwards with a black screen. Two distorted Photo realistic eyes appeared in the darkness as a spotlight appeared over it. It’s Boomer’s ghost. He looked at us for a few seconds until it cut to nothing but a message saying, \"Your words have your own consequences.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd after that, the episode ends. We were both shocked by what we just saw. After watching it, we immediately put it on Facebook so that anyone can figure out what it is. No one really viewed it and the ones who did thought it was a messed up parody of the PPG so we kept it and kind of forgot about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe didn’t get anything important until years later when Craig messaged me and my friend. He was confused over how we got hold of this episode and was worried about what we saw. We asked him what happened on that day and he explained that he had this idea of that episode and put two new animators to work on it and the result was not what he intended. He immediately fired the new employees and got nightmares for a month because of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe also urged us not to share this to the internet but we already did that years ago for answers. However, as far as I know, I haven’t seen any mention of that episode on the internet and it should stay that way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt least I learned one thing, everyone has a breaking point, some are weak and some will hold but will crack under pressure. It’s also important to be respectful around people you don’t know what they are going through.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter all, most people who reached their breaking point break stuff, shout angrily, and just have a breakdown, but some are silent and just go to a place that calms them as they let it out. Unfortunately in this case, this one was abused and wanted to leave this place by committing suicide.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess it’s true of what they say. What you say does have consequences so be mindful of what you say because you don’t know what they are going through.",

        "text": "I was always uncomfortable with the idea of living alone. Any time my parents would go out and leave me at home as a kid I’d get pretty anxious. Stories of home invasions and kidnappings were always on my mind. So when I moved out and got my own place it took me a while to really settle into being on my own. \n\nI found a quiet neighborhood, a little cul-de-sac full of people who’d lived there for decades. Everyone kept to themselves and I hardly ever saw my neighbors. But all good things come to an end I suppose. \n\nDuring a freezing cold December night my town lost power. It sucked but there wasn’t much to do other than wrap myself up in some blankets and sleep through it. I was on the verge of sleep when my attention was drawn to a slow, methodical tapping at my window.\n\nI tried to ignore it but the tapping quickly turned to knocking. Being torn from my cozy rest annoyed me but the idea of someone being stranded in the cold because I didn’t want to get up won out in my mind. So I got up and sleepily walked over to the window. I pulled back the blinds and cracked it open. A wave of freezing air washed over me. \n\n“Hello?” I called out.\n\nA woman responded from the darkness, “I’m so sorry to bother you but I’m short on blankets and it’s very cold.” \n\nI felt oddly comforted by her voice so I asked her to come around to the front door. I closed the window and stumbled through my dark home, finally arriving at the door and unlocking it. I invited the woman inside, still unable to discern any of her features. \n\n“One second I’ll grab my phone.” I reassured, leaving her in the entryway. \n\nI retrieved my phone from my nightstand and turned on the flashlight. I made my way back to the front of the house, now navigating a lot smoother. \n\n“I’ll let you take your pick for the blankets.” I shouted to the woman.\n\nThe house suddenly felt quiet. I could hear my heart beating slightly faster than usual. When I turned the corner to the entryway a sense of dread hit me. I had let a stranger into my home. Sleepy or not I should’ve been more aware of how stupid that was. But now, that stranger had disappeared. My mind swarmed with that old childhood fear. \n\nI couldn’t speak. My limbs felt heavy. I barely managed to pry my feet from the floor and began sneaking back to the hallway, shining my flashlight around wildly. I caught a slight bit of movement at the very edge of my light. I jumped and pointed my phone in the direction of the figure. \n\nI could only see a long, bony arm peeking out from behind a doorway. It was as if she was hiding, waiting for me to get closer. My fight or flight was in full swing. But I couldn’t run. Tears were filling my eyes and I held my breath. The arm shifted and a head tilted around the door frame. Her eyes were large and blue, glinting in my flashlight beam. Her face was thin, like her skin was a loose cloth covering her skull. I instinctively sprinted up the stairs to my right out of fear. \n\nI couldn’t see it but I heard rapid footsteps following close behind. I tripped over the last stair and rushed into the nearest room. I slammed the door closed and locked it. I was in a tiny bathroom, no space to run or hide. I hastily dialed 911, praying the snow wouldn’t prevent them from getting to me in time. \n\n“Come on. It’s cold. Keep me warm.” The woman spoke softly. \n\nI closed my eyes and tried to steady my breathing. \n\n“Open the door, please.” She lulled. \n\nI choked on tears while speaking to the 911 operator. \n\n“Open the goddamn door.” She shouted, forcefully. \n\n“Fuck you!” I yelled back. It was all I could do. A facade of confidence.\n\nShe began kicking the door. The loud thumping of the wood sent waves of anxiety through my body. The operator on the phone reassured me there were cops on the way. It was only a slight comfort, quickly ripped away by the sounds of the woman screaming while hitting the door. \n\nIt sounded like the hinges were about to snap. I pushed back against the door. Feeling the door rock with every hit was overwhelming. After at least 10 minutes she finally gave up. I curled up into a ball and cried to myself quietly. \n\nAnother 10 minutes later the police finally arrived. They searched through the house but didn’t find her. I was completely shaken by the whole thing, I felt sick. Sleep was impossible. Paranoia consumed me and I left to stay with my parents for a while. I was finally feeling well enough to go back home but recently my father has been complaining about tapping outside his window at night.",

        "text": "This post will get immediately taken down if I reveal the locations of the incident and the locations related to it, so I would refrain from doing that.\n\nAll of the readers here, if you have ever moved to a new place, and you had to go to a new school, most of you just wanted to fit in, didn't you? Sure exceptions are everywhere, but most of you did. Some would have been just too shy and would have been reserved, and some of you might have amazing at socializing. It would be easy for you to make new friends.\n\nI, like most people, was at the middle. When I switched places because of my father's transfer, it was really awkward at first on the school. But, one thing about me(which I am not bragging about) was that I had good levels of confidence. Like if I had a speech to give in front of a 1000 people, sure, my hands would tremble, my legs would shake, but still, I would be able to give it.\n\nSame was with me making friends. I was screaming and cursing at myself in my mind for every little mistake that I did, but outside I was as calm as a rock. Gradually, I got into the group of my class.\n\nThe problem starts here : I was not the only transfer student here.\n\nFor confidential reasons, we will call him X.\n\nOn like day 2, my socializing had become good. I was having casual conversations with everyone. It was going quite amazing. \n\nBut X . . . \n\nThe problem was he just seemed off downright creepy.\n\nLike there was just something wrong with him.\n\nAnd his ugliness did not really help him. And for some reason, he had to smile all the time. Did he really think that was helping him?\n\nBut by the end of the day, X realized something : Nobody liked him.\n\nLooks play a major role in our society and if you lack them . . . well, life ain't so easy for you.\n\nFor X, it was the same. He didn't even look average. He was ugly, compared to all of us. Along with this he had those high-numbered spectacles.\n\nAt the 3rd day, I had finally become friends with most of the people in my class. I was good at describing incidents of my past school and mind you, they were funny. Everyone was laughing at my jokes, even the most beautiful girl in class. The recess was going good.\n\nAnd then, just by coincidence, I saw X.\n\nHe was eating his food, but those eyes were just staring at me.\n\nJust staring.\n\nHe was eating his food almost in a mechanical order, as if he was taught, this is how humans eat and was following it step by step.\n\nBut he was looking at me. Unblinking. Unwavering.\n\nIt sent a shiver down my spine and I choked on my food.\n\nWhen I looked up again, X wasn't there. Maybe he had gone off to the washroom.\n\nIt wasn't that I had sabotaged him on purpose. He had tried talking with everyone, he had tried telling jokes . . . it was just that nobody wanted to be with him. Nobody did. He just gave off that creepy aura.\n\nImagine, you are playing a game. You and a guy start off at the same position, but somehow, the game gives the other guy an advantage for no reason and he starts winning. Won't that guy become your opponent? Won't you try to **eliminate** him?\n\nFrom that day on, I became the opponent of X. \n\nA week later or so, I was going to the washroom. There were open toilets in our bathrooms and then there were the closed doors ones. I always preferred the closed ones. There is a thing such as privacy.\n\nSo, I was in there, doing my thing and suddenly, there was a knock on the door.\n\n\"Occupied\", I replied.\n\n*KNOCK*\n\n\"Hey, its occu---\", I never got to complete that sentence.\n\nSuddenly, a hand grabbed my throat from behind. A black, rough, charred hand, as though it was burnt.\n\nI was shocked at first and then I tried to struggle my way out, but the grip only got tighter.\n\nInstantly, I was losing my breath, the world was spinning around me, getting darker and darker and darker.\n\nAnd in between this, I was hearing soft laugh, chuckles. Whatever **it** was, **it** was enjoying this. Hearing me struggle and choke was giving **it** immense pleasure.\n\nThe last thing I remembered, was that I saw the hand coming from above the toilet door, not through it.\n\nAnd then suddenly, my alarm went off.\n\nI don't know when or how I had scheduled that alarm. Maybe it was out of habit. But I make sure that each time I set an alarm, I put in the worst possible ringtone, so that I immediately acknowledge it.\n\nThat is what saved me that day.  A fucking alarm.\n\nThe alarm went off and suddenly, it let go of my throat, making unnatural noises and then I guess, it went away, as fast as it could.\n\n5 minutes later, I woke up, by the sounds of the janitor banging the door.\n\nAs I got out the washroom, after being scolded, I was terrified as fuck, my whole body trembling. But I understood one thing and it sent a shiver down my spine.\n\nThere was **something** in this school and that **something** wanted to kill me.\n\nAnd I had pretty good guess of who it could be.",

        "text": "“January never ends” my little brother says to me as we bury our cat. Buddy was a fat orange and white tabby cat. Pathetic, but adorable and a very kind cat. \n\n“Yeah” I said with a tear in my eye\n“When it rains it pours.”\n\nThere’s something about January and this time of year when stuff goes bad. Last year our parents got into a huge fight which ended up with cops showing up and arresting my dad. I’m supposed to see him in a couple days.\n\n“Logan! Owen! Dinner!” My mom was making chili and hollered for us to come eat.\n\n“Tell her I’m not hungry, I got some stuff to do anyway.” Owen’s eyes seemed to sink even more when I said I wasn’t eating.\n\n“You can play fortnite after dinner b-“ I stopped myself “just go eat dude” I gave him a hug and told him not to think about buddy. I watched his coat flail in the wind as he ran back inside. I told mom it would be to big for him. I picked up the shovel and took one last look at buddy’s grave. “You were the best cat buddy” I said it as if he were still here. I walked to the garage and put the shovel back. “Ding” I pulled out my phone to see a message from Jake.\n\n“Yo dude there’s a party going on tonight at Jerome’s if you wanna come.”\nI do need a distraction I thought.\n“I’ll be over in 20 min” my hands were almost shaking as I typed the message. Somethings off I thought. I’m never this worried about going to a party. I stepped out of the garage and stared across the street. There was a man standing in front of my neighbors house but something was off. He wasn’t walking or doing anything. Just standing on the street staring down at the pavement. He was wearing all black clothes and his face was ghost white but I never got a look at his eyes. I watched a squirrel run behind him and just as the squirrel came back into my line of sight, it dropped dead. Then the guy disappeared. Just vanished while I was fixated on the newly dead squirrel. This should’ve been my first sign to stay home that night. But I was ignorant. I grabbed my weed from my dads old tool box and went to jakes.\n\nWalking was never my first choice but I promised mom I’d never take the car to a party. I got to jakes house and there wasn’t a single car in the driveway. \n“That’s odd” I thought. His mom usually goes to bed early so I can’t Imagine why she wouldn’t be there. I knocked on the door and waited a few minutes, no answer. I try calling Jake but he doesn’t pick up. At this point I’m starting to get worried so I just walk in and go upstairs to jakes room.\n\nI found him unconscious on the floor with a bunch of crushed up oxys on his desk. I started giving cpr and dialed 911 when something out the window caught my attention. It was the same man from before except this time, I could see his eyes. His dark, lifeless, disgusting eyes. That was the last thing I saw before I felt my own eyes roll into the back of my head. Then I felt the thud as my body collapsed to the floor.\n\nSomething soft was brushing up against me. I opened my eyes and saw the familiar ball of fluff that I loved so much.\n“Hey buddy” I said as I stroked his soft little head.\n“I guess January truly never ends”",

In a growing panic, we all spun about, out lights playing across the rest of the room, all of us assuming we must have gotten turned around and disoriented, but it took only a moment to confirm the impossible; the room was *different* now than it had been only moments before.\n\nIt was then we realized that other things had changed as well. In addition to our flashlights and Nick’s camera-mounted light, oil lamps hung from hooks scattered around the room, providing a dim and flickering illumination of the shelves and their contents. The pages that had previously been scattered across the small desk were instead now arranged in a neat pattern across its surface, lit by four guttering red candles, one at each corner of the table like silent sentries.\n\n“What the *hell?*” Nick exclaimed in shock, and I felt my world shake for a moment, as if my brain was trying to process what was happening and was failing horribly.\n\nI staggered and reached out to his shoulder for support, focusing on my breathing for a long moment until my pounding heart began to settle and my vision cleared.\n\n“What… what just happened?” I said, my voice shaking and coming as a hoarse whisper.\n\nMy eyes alighted in that moment on something else that had changed in that dark cellar. One of the shelves had been swung away from the wall, exposing a roughly excavated tunnel entrance in the plaster and stone. Our lights showed us that the stygian darkness beyond looked to be a sort of natural cave, winding inward and downward into the heart of the hillside.\n\nI looked over to Sarah, who stood now back at the table, studying the papers intently. Her face was twisted in a frown, but I didn’t think it was the sudden shift in reality that was her focus now.\n\n“Sarah?” I asked carefully, not sure if the shock of the moment had perhaps been too much for her to accept. I couldn’t understand why she would have turned back to the desk when faced with the impossibility that stood before us now.\n\nShe answered without looking up from the pages. “The whole thing is backwards,” she said, flipping the page and continuing her study of the next. “I don’t think Abigail Greer turned to witchcraft after her father died. Listen to this:\n\n*“… I fear that my father’s loss last season was too great a burden for mother to bear. She has turned back to the old ways of her Celtic ancestry, to that black knowledge that she swore to abandon when they first wed. For fifteen years she kept that promise, bringing me and my brother into this world under God’s holy light. But I have found the entrance she has unearthed in the dark of the cellar. I have seen, to my horror, the ancient scrawling that cover every inch of this place, and the madness of the signs that she has constructed. My mind rebels and I have prayed for the Lord’s guidance, but I have heard nothing. I no longer feel His light in this place.*\n\n*“I am afraid that mother’s descent into this madness and evil has shadowed my family and removed us from God’s grace. We are alone now. I have heard terrible sounds from the entrance to the pit and we have not seen mother in nearly a week. Elias has taken ill, and I fear that he may follow my father to the grave if he does not soon recover from his malaise.”*\n\nShe paused and looked at me, still holding the page.\n\nI frowned. “I thought you weren’t able to read them?”\n\nSarah shrugged and shook her head in confusion. “I don’t know how to explain it, but these pages are written in colonial English, not much different than what we speak now. Definitely not that gibberish we saw before.”\n\n“Well, that’s the least of it,” I said, looking back over my shoulder. Nick had moved closer to the rough opening in the cellar wall, shining his camera light into the tunnel.\n\nI raised my voice. “Nick? Don’t wander, yeah?”\n\nHe just spared a quick glance at me and gave a vague nod and half-hearted wave before turning back to the tunnel.\n\n“What else does it say? Anything about spontaneous redecorating of the cellar?” I tried to force a little humor into my voice, to lighten the tone, but even before the words left my mouth, I knew they’d fallen flat.\n\nSarah picked up another sheet from the table. “This one must be from later. There aren’t any dates, but listen:\n\n*“I saw mother today. Elias has only grown worse. His skin is hot to the touch, and he cannot keep down broth or bread. My brother is wasting before my eyes! I ventured down to the cellar, which I had been avoiding for a week or more and called for mother in that dark and black tunnel. I pleaded with her to come help Elias and eventually she emerged.*\n\n*“When first I laid eyes upon her, I barely recognized her for who she was. It seemed almost that she had gone nearly feral, so wild were her eyes. Her great fall of bright red hair, which had always been a source of pride for her and her Celtic ancestry, now rose around her head in a tangle, making her seem more beast than woman! Her dress was disheveled and torn in places, but it was the crimson stains splashed across the breast that drew my attention in that instant. I thought I would flee at that moment, but thoughts of my brother emboldened me, and I spoke to her.*\n\n*“I pleaded with her to come help him, but it seemed there was barely any recognition in her eyes when she set them upon me. After a long while, she pushed past me, nearly sending me toppling to the ground, and gained the staircase to the house above, all the while murmuring in a tongue foreign to me, which I assume was that of her homeland. I ran after her, but when I reached the sitting room, where I had been attempting to nurse Elias, I found she had taken him in her arms and was returning to the cellar. I moved to follow her, but she set upon me a gaze so cold and inhuman and lacking any sort of recognition, that I froze and could not proceed. When I recovered my wits, I ran to the cellar doorway, but was met with such horrid and tortured sounds from below that I could not bring myself to descend. I have seen neither of them since.”*\n\nI looked back over my shoulder and saw Nick had taken a step inside the entrance to the tunnel. He was crouched a bit and peering into it intently, using the powerful camera light to try to dispel the gloom.\n\n“Nick,” I said, but he didn’t seem to hear me. “Nick!” At that, he straightened as much as the low tunnel would allow and looked back at me with questioning eyes, not responding.\n\n“Stay close to us. Don’t go wandering off,” I told him, shaking my head and turning back to Sarah.\n\nShe’d set the papers down and picked up the last one.\n\n“*It has been two days since I saw mother or Elias. I fear that she has called forth something foul and unclean from the pit in the madness that fell upon her after my father’s death. I remember some of the things that my maternal grandmother told me when we were still in Boston. She used to tell us stories about the old world and the witchery that festered there, before my father put an end to it. I remember that salt spread across a threshold is said to bar a witch’s passage and keep the blackness at bay, so I have done this at the entrance to the cellar. I am more terrified in this moment than I have ever been in my life, but I cannot abandon Elias. He is all I have left of my father now. Tonight, I will take my rosery and lamp and venture into the cellar tunnel in search of my brother. May God hear my prayers and protect me with his light. – Abigail Greer.”*\n\n“Jesus,” I said. “If that’s true-“ I stopped mid-thought, realizing that Nick was now nowhere to be seen. I ran to the mouth of the tunnel and shone my flashlight beam into it, calling out for our companion.\n\nSarah was at my side in an instant. “He didn’t go in there, did he?” she said, eyes wide.\n\nI gave a quick nod and stepped into the rough-hewn tunnel, my flashlight held before me to guide our way. The air within was much colder than that in the cellar, and that stench from earlier grew more pungent and tenacious than before, rolling my stomach with each step.\n\nThere was something wrong with the air here, something beyond the drop in temperature or the foul stench that assailed our progress.\n\nIt felt *bad*. Spoiled.\n\nI don’t know any other way to describe it – it was as if the air itself had turned against us, protesting our intrusion. I pulled the neck of my shirt up to cover my mouth and nose, but it didn’t help much.\n\nThe tunnel fell before us in a gentle descent that wound left and right like the tracks of a serpent. I called out to Nick a few times but received no reply in the thick darkness. Onward and downward we trailed for what felt like hundreds of feet. I thought we must be well under the hill at this point and couldn’t begin to guess how deep our travel had taken us.\n\nIt was then that we rounded another in the long series of the left-and-right meandering of the tunnel and froze in our tracks, our eyes fixing instantly on the discarded camera. It had been smashed; its pieces strewn violently across the rough floor of the cave before us.\n\nI raised my light again and called out for Nick. Again, I was met without a response, but now I feared for my friend even more; I wasn’t sure whether he’d brought a flashlight, and with his camera now reduced to bits of plastic, metal, and glass on the bedrock floor, he’d be traveling blind in the abyssal darkness. With no idea what may lie ahead – whether it was a solid wall or sheer cliff falling into the bowels of the earth – continuing his walk would have been lunacy.\n\n*What was going on?*\n\n“*Nick!*” I shouted again, but this time my ears caught the hint of a reply, echoing from the distance.\n\nSarah looked at me and, without a word, we rushed into motion, moving as quickly as the dancing flashlights would allow in the narrow tunnel.\n\nAfter a short time, we burst from the tunnel into a wide chamber and skidded to a halt. My injured ankle threatened to betray me, and I only stayed upright by sheer luck.\n\nWe had emerged from the darkness into a surreal nightmare, which even now I have trouble describing.\n\nThe chamber was wide – perhaps thirty feet across – and roughly dome-shaped. The flickering orange light from hundreds of tapers positioned about the relatively smooth floor gave a hellish glow to the room, dim enough to preclude plain sight, but cursedly bright enough to see the macabre tableau laid out before us.\n\nA great white symbol was etched into the stone floor of the cave, looking to my untrained eyes very much like the one we’d seen in the cellar. As with the other, this appeared to be constructed of hundreds and thousands of smaller symbols and glyphs, all of which were foreign to me. Unlike the former, this one had been scratched into the stone itself with some sharp instrument.\n\nThe air in this chamber was not stale or chill, as we had experienced previously, but was instead warm and flowing, weaving in and out of the multitude of other tunnels that I realized intersected with this chamber. Despite the constant airflow, the candle flames appeared indifferent and continued their slow consumption of the crimson-colored wax.\n\nI realize only now that it was my mind that chose to first catalogue each of these relatively mundane characteristics of the chamber in order to protect itself – a sort of safety mechanism to prevent the shock of the scene from flooding in all at once, overwhelming my sanity and leaving me a gibbering mess, curled up sobbing on the floor in a pool of my own waste.\n\nSarah was quicker to process everything, though, and her horrified scream drew my eyes to the unholy abomination that lay before us, snapping me back to the present jarringly.\n\nIron forged-link chains from a bygone age hung from the ceiling at the edges of the great circular symbol, and from them were suspended the corpses of three people, hung by their wrists, all dressed in colonial puritan garb and all looking as fresh as if they were only sleeping. My eyes darted from one to the next, disbelieving what I was seeing, and I felt my mind lose a little more of its grip at that moment. The first was an older man, clean-shaven and gray-haired. He was tall and wore a simple carved wooden cross around his neck, which I noted was bent at a grotesque angle and allowed his head to rest unnaturally low against his chest. The second was a young boy, perhaps ten years old, with pallid skin slicked with perspiration and deep sunken eyes rimmed in dark red circles. The third was a blond girl in her mid-teens, wearing a rosary around her neck.\n\nI don’t know how long we stood there, staring at this impossible sight. These people were more than two hundred years dead, yet looked as if they might open their eyes at any moment. Then my sight fell to the great red stains that started at the ghastly and ragged incisions across their bellies and painted everything below in that nightmare hue. The blood had splashed across the outer edges of the great circular seal, obscuring some of the glyphs and runes etched there. Impossibly, it still glistened wet in the flickering candlelight.\n\nI turned away before my stomach had the chance to rebel and spill my lunch all over the cavern floor.\n\n“The Greers…” Sarah whispered in astonishment, taking an unconscious step forward.\n\n“All except for one,” I croaked in a hoarse voice. “Where is Fiona, the mother?”\n\nA moment later, I found the answer to my question. As I stepped carefully around the horrifying scene, the body of Fiona Greer came into view. The woman lay rigid on her back, arms outstretched to either side, and hands splayed wide and clawing in eternal agony at the stone floor. Her dress was slashed and torn and singed in places, exposing pale and scarred skin beneath, and her hair formed a maniacal halo around her freckled face. An intricate pattern drawn in electric blue paint adorned her chin and neck, as well as across her brow. Her face was the worst of it, however. Her eye sockets were blackened and empty, and her mouth stretched open impossibly wide in an eternal scream of unimaginable torture and suffering. The skin around her mouth was blistered raw and cracked, and her tongue and teeth were soot-black, as if she had been exposed to some great blast furnace from within.\n\nHer feet rested in the center of a smaller circle, perhaps four feet in diameter, and similar in design to the larger one. It almost looked like she had been standing within the circle before she died, but as to its purpose or what might have happened to her, I had no clue. Positioned around the symbol’s edges were the remarkably preserved remnants of herbs and plants, arranged in careful patterns. A bright yellow flower stood out in my vision, creating an obscene mixture of beauty and horror in this nightmare chamber.\n\nI stared in shocked silence for a long while, unable to wrest myself back to sane thought and action, until Sarah snatched at the shoulder of my jacket, pulling me away from the gruesome sight.\n\n“*Bánánach,*” she hissed, jabbing her finger at a symbol on the floor just outside the smaller circle. “*Stupid woman!* I know what happened here,” she said, pulling me towards the cave we had entered from. “Jason, we need to leave *now*!”\n\nI hesitated. “But Nick…” I said, the words feeling flat and feeble in my mouth.\n\nShe pulled my face down to meet hers, locking eyes with me. “He’s *gone*. We need to get out of here now or we’re going to end up like her!”\n\nI hesitated another moment, something instinctual preventing me from leaving my friend behind in this chamber of horrors. Then, a ghostly howling, simultaneously mournful and predatory and *hungry*, reached us, sweeping over us from somewhere in one of the myriad of tunnels adjoining this chamber, making the decision for me.\n\nSarah shoved me hard in the direction of the exit with a fierce grunt and set me running, her footsteps close behind. I ran as hard as I could, leaving that chamber behind and navigating through the rocky tunnel. I can’t tell you how many times I missed a turn during our flight and slammed heavily into the jagged rockface, but by the time we finally emerged into the cellar once again, I was bleeding from a dozen cuts on my arms and face.\n\nI collapsed hard to the dusty floor of the cellar, knocking the wind from myself in the process. Sarah stepped over me without a word and rushed to the corner of the room, where the long-since deteriorated sacks had spilled their contents over the floor. I frowned, not understanding what she was doing.\n\n“Sarah, what-,” I started, but froze at the sound of something racing frantically through the narrow tunnel, growing closer with each breath. I could hear rocks dislodged and fall with its passing, and I wondered at what could do such a thing. The next moment, a howling scream of some otherworldly terror rattled from the shadows, reverberating in my skull and ringing my ears.\n\n“Jason, help me!” she cried, carrying two handfuls of the yellow granules back and spreading them across the threshold of the tunnel entrance. She rushed back and brought back more, but I could only sit there, paralyzed with terror, as I stared into the depths of that black cave, from where the sounds of movement rapidly grew louder. “Jason!” she screamed again.\n\nI looked at her and realized that there was no way she was going to complete her task in time. She’d made three trips already and the line was barely a third of the way across the entrance of the cave, that gaping maw of blackness that had claimed our friend.\n\nI cursed, but in that moment, I saw that the cellar was once again in the state in which we first found it, including the staircase!\n\n“Sarah! The stairs!” I shouted, scrambling to my feet.\n\nShe looked over at the stairs with astonishment and hesitated. The briefest moment of indecision crossed her eyes as she glanced down at the salt in her hands and then to the pitiful progress she’d made with the barrier. A moment later, she slung the salt aside and launched herself behind me, making for the stone stairs at a dead run.\n\nI had just turned the corner and was taking the steps two at a time when I heard whatever pursued us finally reach the cellar. The crashing and splintering of the shelves rang out loudly in the still air, but I kept my eyes on the rectangle of light ahead of me that promised salvation. I heard her footsteps close on my heels, and for a moment, I thought the staircase seemed much longer than it had when we first descended it.\n\nStill, I pushed harder, my breath ragged in my chest. Finally, I threw myself over the last few steps, landing hard on the warped floorboards and slamming my shoulder into the opposite wall. My head spun and my vision blurred for a moment, but then I was looking back at the open doorway, willing Sarah to hurry. She was farther behind me than I had thought, and I still couldn’t understand why it had taken us so long to climb the steps – there couldn’t have been more than twenty of them, I was sure.\n\nI could see her silhouette racing up the stone steps towards me and I reached out to her, ready to snatch her out of the stairwell as soon as she was within reach.\n\nBut then I also saw the twisted, distorted form racing behind her, impossibly fast and impossibly close. I heard a hissing howl as it chased her, mixed somehow with the faint and distant screams of the damned, and then glowing embers of its eyes fixed upon me and I thought I could sense a cold smile of triumph on its unseen face.\n\n“*Sarah! Come on! I’ve got you!”* I screamed, my voice breaking.\n\n*She was going to make it*; she was so close I could almost feel her warmth on my skin. She finally reached the top of the steps and launched herself toward my outstretched hands, the huge shadow looming directly behind her. Her eyes were wide with terror and her mouth gaped open with the exertion of her flight. Sarah’s fingers brushed mine, and then a sudden darkness, blacker than coal, filled the doorway and enveloped her in an instant.\n\nAnd then she was gone. The shadowed darkness faded into wisps and tendrils of sooty smoke that swirled in eddies with her passing and dissipated until none were left.\n\nThe stairwell was empty, silence once again returning to the house, save for the steady hiss of the rain outside upon the frozen ground.\n\nI was alone.\n\nI sat there for a long while, unfocused eyes fixed upon the empty cellar doorway. I might have been in shock, but I don’t think it was anything so clinical. My co-workers, my *friends*, were gone, and I had no way to explain what had happened. I didn’t dare return to the cellar, and I knew the only thing that was keeping that *thing* confined, the only thing that had likely saved my life, was the salt that Abigail Greer had spread across the threshold two hundred years before.\n\nWearily, I eventually hoisted myself to my feet and grabbed my backpack from where it lay near the open front door. Wind had blown the rain in and covered it with a freezing mist, but I barely noticed.\n\n\\*\n\nThat was two months ago. I eventually made my way back to the van and called the police, telling them that I’d woken up that morning at our motel to scout a location, but both of my co-workers had disappeared sometime in the night.\n\nIt was a weak cover, but I didn’t know what else to tell them. The truth would only land me in the nuthouse, or worse, implicated in the murders of Nick and Sarah.\n\n*Bánánach*. Sarah had used that word in the chamber. It was the only clue I had at first, and it wasn’t much of one, but after a few days of research through some areas of the internet I’ll never traverse again, I think I know what she meant.\n\nShe was always the smart one. I’ve never seen anyone so versed in as many obscure bits of information surrounding the paranormal as her. I also knew she’d always had an interest in the history of witchcraft and the black arts, so it shouldn’t have come as any surprise that she had pieced it all together so quickly, while I had been just barely holding onto my sanity.\n\nShe would have known.\n\nSarah knew that Fiona Greer had been raised in Ireland, and her mother had taught her the ways of Celtic witchcraft. She would have spent weeks researching in preparation for this location scouting. She would have known that Fiona was versed enough to ensure she was protected from the demons she was trying to summon to avenge her husband’s death, even if it had meant the grisly blood sacrifice of her own children. But it had been a long fifteen years since she had last been familiar with the ways of mysticism, and her madness had driven her to recklessness.\n\nThe yellow flowers were what stuck out in my mind. In Ireland, they would have been *Colt’s Foot*, but that flower didn’t exist in Massachusetts in the 1800s, so she had used the closest substitute she could find – daisies. But the tomes of witchcraft were very specific, I learned, and each component intended for its own particular purpose. In this case, *Colt’s Foot* was intended to protect the witch from the demon they summoned – the *Bánánach*. I can only surmise that, when the summoning was finished, Fiona Greer was left with nothing to protect her from the horrifying entity she had raised and had paid dearly for her mistake.\n\nI quit my job after that and have been living off my meager and rapidly dwindling savings since then. I’ve been haunted by terrifying visions every night since that day, and rarely sleep more than a couple hours at a time anymore.\n\nLast night, I awoke with a start, covered in sweat and wide-eyed, the phantom howl of some unremembered dream still fading in my ears. My unconscious mind had wandered back to that day and turned everything over, reliving every hellish moment. And it was then that the mental image flashed into my awareness like a freeze-frame, draining the blood from my face and sweeping over me with the cold wash of nausea at the sudden, horrifying, realization.\n\nIt was the image of the yellowed granules spread carefully across the cellar threshold; the neat, unbroken line of salt placed there by Abigail Greer as a ward against the darkness she knew her mother had summoned. It was the memory of how I had broken that barrier with the careless and ignorant scuffing of my boot before we three had started our descent to the cellar on that stormy [November day.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_JIsvWfQr41ant2OGjmJkg)",
