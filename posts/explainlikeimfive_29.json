        "text": "I’m not super familiar with firearms and usually only see them in video games. I notice that pistols and sun machine guns use something called blowback to load the next round from the magazine. My understanding is that the recoil of the round pushes the bolt back and ejects the bullet. This works for pistols and submachine guns like a Glock or MP40.\n\nFor rifles though, they have to be gas operated or put in a separate tube so that the gas can go backwards to push the bolt back. Why is this the case? Why can’t rifles like the M16 or AK47 simply use blowback and let the recoil of the gun push the bolt back and load the new round?",

Why not take a rod, dissolve its contents and vitrify it in a massive block.  The fuel concentration would be diluted in the glass in such a way as to lower the density of fuel and thus  the reaction rate, and so lower the temperature to, say 100F degrees.   It would maintain this temperature for an extremely long time as the remaining fuel still has a lot of energy. \nClad the block in an appropriate shielding material- say, high density plastic for neutrons and metal shell for gamma/beta and you have a virtually infinite source of domestic or commercial heat.   What’s the flaw in my thinking?",
