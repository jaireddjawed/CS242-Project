Later that night, the clerk realizes he overcharged the men $5. He gives the bellhop a 5 dollar bill to give back to the men. On the way up, the bellhop realizes he can’t split a 5 evenly between the 3 men so he keeps $2 and gives each man $1. Ok now here’s the problem. Each man originally payed $10 but got $1 back so really they payed $9 a piece. 3 x $9 is $27. If we add the $2 the bellhop kept that brings the total to $29. Where is the other dollar??",

The hunt challenges each participating team to solve a large number of puzzles which lead to an object (called a \"coin\") hidden somewhere on campus. The winning team gets to write the subsequent year's hunt. \" - Taken from [here](http://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/). Participation is totally free (though we try to make a donation to the Hunt to say thanks)\n\n**Who is Test Solution Please Ignore?**\n\nTest Solution Please Ignore is a team of roughly 50-60 puzzlers from around the world. We started four years ago as a team for the MIT Mystery Hunt, but we've branched out to other puzzle hunts as well. Because we started through the internet, we're much more distributed than other  Mystery Hunt teams. Most of our team is off-site. Last year, we had roughly 20 on-site players at any given time, and this year we're looking to increase that number.\n\nThis year's hunt kicks off on Friday, January 12, 2017 at noon at MIT. The hunt usually lasts until sometime on Sunday. We're looking for any and all participants to join our team and help us kick ass and solve puzzles. You do not need to be present on the campus to participate, remote players are welcome (and constitute the bulk of our players). ***You do not need to spend the full weekend with us if you can't. Any time you can spend is appreciated.***\n\n**Who are we looking for?**\n\nWe're looking for anyone who is interested in puzzles/riddles/codes/crytography/steganography/math/music/history/geography/\\[insert other subjects here\\] or anyone who is just naturally curious. If you're reading this, we want you. You do not have to have prior experience with puzzle solving to be a productive member of our team.\n\n**How do I participate?**\n\nHead on over to /r/testsolution and follow the link to the sign up!",
