Native speakers said that it is more natural not to use a preposition (using it would sound formal) in that case, but only for \"wh-\" phrase. That is, you cannot say \"I don't care the event.\" \n\nI thought if a verb takes an object without preposition, that word is transitive. But the English dictionaries I had consulted all showed only \"intransitive\" definitions for \"care\". One native person said that I used a wrong dictionary, and indeed, [the dictionary he mentioned, Webster's, marked \"care\" as \"transitive\" for that case](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/care). Bur an example sentence of the same construction, [the Cambridge dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/care) marked it as \"intransitive\".\n\n&gt; care verb [ I ] (WORRY)\n\n&gt; \"I don't care what you think\", she flung (back) at him.\n\nThere was an unfamiliar notation \"[+question word]\" in the examples. I guess this is what the native person mentioned about \"wh-\" phrase. He said it is not a general rule, so I cannot say like \"I agree what you said.\", but what is the grammatical explanation for this?\n\nSince Webster's dictionary says it is transitive and Cambridge says intransitive, I suspect that this is some controversial phenomenon.\n",

Can the writer be referring to some sort of ambiguous, Platonic idea of a heart that we all share and can therefore be singular? Is it perhaps a variation on the royal we? (Picture a therapist asking, \"How are we feeling today?\") Or does it need to be plural no matter the weirdness?",

However, if you think it should be \"rises,\" then that means in #1, I should say \"I thought you are so beautiful\" if I believe the status of her beauty is non-changing?\n",
