        "text": "My friend came down to visit me a few days ago and has been spending the night. Inside our small apartment are me, my roommate, and my friend. Ever since my friend came over things have started getting really weird and I'll explain these experiences in chronological order. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. This may sound incredibly ridiculous but I assure you this is real, I have seen it with my own eyes. Last night after my roommate got into an argument with my neighbor I went out to get the mail in the middle of the night. Outside there was a tall intimidating man standing outside with his phone. I thought nothing of it and continued on into the mail room. When I came out the tall man was standing next to the exit of the mailroom, not on his phone, and staring at the floor blankly. He just stood there like those stereotypically possessed people in horror movies. I was shocked and confused, I thought that maybe he was lost in thought but when I started heading back to my apartment he followed me. Admittedly I ran and he didn't see which apartment I was in.  \n2. I was hanging out with my friend and roommate today, and we decided to go to the beach. On my out of the parking lot after a long day, this tweaker was tweaking out next to my car as we drove by. Many cars were driving by and the tweaker didn't react at all, he just kept tweaking. But for some specific reason, when we passed him, he just stopped and stared at us just like how the security guard was staring at the floor, in the exact same stance. It was so creepy and he watched us until we left his line of sight. \n3. Okay so aside from those weird experiences, this Is where things start to get really weird. My roommate went out to get some soda and while he was in the middle of his trip, my friend and I were funnily enough talking about paranormal experiences. During this, we heard a violent knock 3 times at our door. I immediately jump and look outside to see if it was my roommate pulling a prank but literally nobody was there. It was so weird. \n4. Getting into the spooky mood, we decided to watch a horror movie to finish off the night. During the movie, my friend and roommate heard a foot-dragging sound right next to them and heard some weird moan in their ear. This sound was exactly opposite from where I was sitting so it couldn't have been me. We thought it was the movie so we replayed it but the sound was not repeated, meaning it came from real life. \n\nI'm not entirely sure what to make of these experiences. When events 1-3 happened I thought it was some weird coincidence after event 4 happened I have the feeling something is up. I'm not sure if my friend brought something with him, if somehow we were hexed by our neighbor who hates us, or if our energy somehow attracts anything paranormal. Maybe it is all coincidence but if anything more happens maybe it isn't.",

Dad didn't think it was a scary house but every time you go past it has a creepy feeling to it. Like someone was living their. It had a long bend hallway with creeps cublpbairds and dreadful small rooms. So anyway we didn't know the back story to this house, but dad started having terrible almost real dreams of a man brutally killing his family and kids. But he thought of it because we watched a horror movie a couple of nights before. But once he woke up to foot steps in the hallway so he walked out their and looked around all over the house their was no one their. So he shrugged it of thinking it was just the house cooling of because we live in central Australia it gets realy hot. So he tried to go back to sleep but he heard it again but it was louder and heavier the last time he got up again and checked still no one and done it again but it happened again. So he got pissed and said \"who's their\" and their was a reply saying \"me\" so he got freaked the fuck out and ran to us and slept with us tonight. Then apparently he woke up once and sore a little girl with a yellow dress. So dad went to man who was the previous owner and the old lady showed up the records and apparently their was a Man who went pshyco and killed his whole family in the house and one of the victims was he's little girl with a yellow dress.",

        "text": "Hello all, this is my first post here. Im looking for some answers to what happened to me when I was around 12-13 years old. Im 23 now, and these events still loom over me.\n\nSo at the time I was living in Virginia with my parents and 2 step siblings. we had recently moved into a newly built townhouse development. Our townhouse had 3 floors in total. The upstairs area is where the bedrooms were located, the living room and the kitchen were on the main floor, and the basement was my sisters bedroom.\n\nAt the time I was becoming increasingly interested in the paranormal. I would watch all sorts of ghost shows on television. Eventually I learned what a Ouija board was. I wanted one, but I knew I wouldn't have the means to buy a real one myself and I knew my parents would not approve... so I opted to make my own. I created a template on a piece of cardboard, carefully replicating what a real one would look like. For the planchette, I used a plastic square shaped lid that was the perfect size.\n\nI heard that it wasn't safe to use it by myself, and I didn't have any friends in the area at the time, so I asked my sister if she would try it with me. She was reluctant at first, but after some convincing she was game. Her uncle had recently passed a few months prior, so we decided to try and contact him. we set the board up in the basement (her bedroom) with a picture of her uncle next to us. We both lightly put our fingers on the makeshift planchette, and I began to ask questions like \"Uncle \\*\\*\\*, are you here with us tonight?\". To both of our surprise, it did not take long to get a response. the planchette moved to yes with force. At first I assumed that my sister was messing with me. But soon I would be proved wrong, because she started crying very hard. After a few more questions with responses, my sister informed me that she wanted to stop. I dont remember what else we asked because it was so long ago, but I do remember that the planchette would move with haste after every question we asked. We ended by informing \"her uncle\" that we were leaving, and moving the piece to goodbye. Afterwards it took some time for my sister to calm down, and I was pretty blown away myself.\n\nStrange things started happening to me almost immediately after. After we had finished using the board we both went upstairs to calm down and watch tv. 30 minutes later I heard a bang come from the basement. I went downstairs to investigate, and found that the planchette had moved from Goodbye to No, and a picture on the wall had fallen down. this disturbed me, so afterwards I opted to tear up the board and throw it away. After I did this I assumed that was the end of it, and for my sister it was. But I didn't know that this was the beginning of months of pure terror for me.\n\nI dont know why, but whatever this thing was attached to me. my sister didn't have any odd occurrences afterwards. meanwhile I started noticing strange things happening. it started small at first. I noticed our family dog would all of the sudden refuse to come into my bedroom. I would pick him up and take him into my room anyways, and when he was in there he would act very strange. his ears would stick straight up, and his eyes would fixate on a certain corner in my room. he would whine and bark, and occasionally his head would dart around like he was watching something move around.\n\nThen, I was sitting in my room another day on my own. I was watching tv and laughing at the show I was watching. My school binders were sitting all the way at the foot of my bed, and I was sitting at the head of the bed a good distance away. one of my binders slid all the way across my bed, hitting me in the arm. This freaked me out, and I informed my parents but they told me that I was just imagining things. Weird things like this kept happening to me. One time I walked into the kitchen during the day by myself, and a sponge that was sitting on the dining room table suddenly flew across the whole room with force.\n\nI continued to experience things like this and they started becoming more frequent. I talked to my sister about it and she told me that nothing odd was happening for her. I was a mess at the time, I did NOT want to go home and would often try and go to a friends house after school instead, which most of the time didn't work out. I talked to my parents again, and go figure they thought I was making it up for attention again.\n\nAfter a little bit of going through it, I had the most terrifying night of my life. this event still sends shivers down my spine when I think of it. it traumatized me, and although Ive worked passed it for the most part I still try not to think about it. Ive only told a few people in my life about this because it sounds like a straight up lie. This night was the \"climax\" of my experiences. after this happened the activity completely stopped.\n\nOne night I was laying in my bed. It was 2 or 3 in the morning, and I couldn't sleep so I was just laying there. My whole family was asleep and the house was completely dark. I slept with my door open at the time, and the only light source was a blue light emanating from my radio in my room. it was just bright enough to illuminate my room. I had my blanket over my head, covering half of my face, but I could still see my room from waist height down to the floor. To my horror, as I laid there with my eyes open a black figure entered my field of vision near the foot of my bed. It was right next to my bed. There was no color on whatever this was. it was a pure, pitch black with no obvious features. I was paralyzed with fear, I couldn't scream or move. I just laid there as I watched this thing slowly move down my bed until it stopped right in front of my face. I then felt a hand placed on my head through the blanket that was over me. the hand rested there for a second, and then began moving in a circular motion for a few seconds. eventually the hand lifted and I watched the dark figure slowly move away and then out of the room.\n\nThis was the last thing that ever happened. after that it just completely stopped as fast as it started. This whole ordeal has had a huge impact in my life. This is the first time I am sharing this story online. I havent tried until now because I did not want to type it out and re live it. But now I am more curious as to what the fuck happened to me and what that \"thing\" was. I think that I should also add that aside from anxiety and depression issues, I am mentally sound. I have never experienced hallucinations or delusions, and I know that what happened to me was real.\n\nI am posting this to not only share my story, but to also gain insight from others. What do you think this could have been? could it have been a demon? and Has anyone reading this had any similar experiences?\n\nI wish I could be more detailed, but its been so long and ive largely tried to forget about this time in my life. Thanks in advance!\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

        "text": "Before any ninnyhammer decides to comment crap underneath this post I am leaving the disclaimer that yes, I am talking about a dead man because his ghost is my friend. If the name Per Yngve Ohlin Forsberg, is recognizable to you, hear me out. Even if it isn't, just read. At this current point in time I am twenty seven and that came with a stroke of extremely good luck. Since I was a little girl I have been making contact with Per Ohlin for a long list of reasons but the main one is me being born a retrocognitive baby in May. Per used to be the vocalist of Norwegian Metal band MAYHEM but also Morbid and he has been the one to help me recall my past lives. At first I did not understand that Per was Dead as in named, but also deceased, because how would a little kid know the difference? No matter, to me Per looked like Nightwing and I loved comics, so we read them together and got closer as he jokingly nicknamed me Raven. (Reference Teen Titans) \\[Some could say he raised me, I call him Deady, and it's not weird like that.\\] Per is a VIP as a ghost and because of this I met many more spooks. Erik Brodreskift, James Morrison, Euronymous, Freddy Mercury, Kurt Cobain, Alan Wilson, Cochise, Sitting Bull, Stephen Decatur, Sylvia Plath, Mary &amp; Percy Shelley, Dana Plato, John Candy, Brandon Lee etc. etc. Each one and more of these waites taught me ways to talk to them and I loved it but other living people did not. As I aged, I attempted explaining paranormal communication with the main entity I know in Pelle and that he was not an imaginary friend but I got labeled as schizophrenic for nothing.  In Florida a Per Ohlin translates to a \"perouline\", which is a food, so no one believed me and I receded over fear of being judged or that I was genuinely insane. It was all in my head or blah, blah, blah and I was put on drugs because it was easier to accept than me being gifted with deeper sight. Dead noticed that I hated those pills and he knew that I didn't need them so he taught me how to not take them because he swore I was not crazy and I promise that I am not. I listen to him because he looks out for my best interest in all affairs and I trust him because that is what a spirit guide is for. Two years ago in 2020, I was met with a set of interesting ghouls showing up to my house. Rory Gallagher, Layne Staley, Lou Reed, Shannon Hoon, Andrew Wood, Cliff Burton, Prince and Elvis Presley. It was strange how it happened because these ghosts fell from the sky into my dry and vacant koi pond almost every night asking for help or guidance to their respective other sides. One of those ghosts showed up as Chester Bennington from Linkin Park, struggling with the location of the soul of Christopher Cornell from Audioslave, needing assistance in finding his soul friend who died in May. At first I did not want to help Chester because it scared me to see him. He was not dead when I was growing up so his ghost triggered me hardcore and brought up so many emotions I tried not having built up inside of me. Either way, I knew that he needed help locating Chris, that he and Cornell never left me out in the cold, and that I so could not do that to them. My guide in Jim Morrison had gone missing and I was kind of going wacky because Jim is a vital and essential masculine energy that I transmute and rely on with no shame. Chester said he could help me get James if I aided him in finding Chris so I agreed to help in exchange for reconnection to Jim. At the time, I was working with some other ghosts besides Per in order to get Jim back but I understood the asset that Chester played with being added in. These other ghoulish bandits are some funny banshees known and recognized as Brian Jones, Sid Vicious, Keith Moon and John Henry Bonham. I do understand the names I am listing and I am listing them because they are part of my soul contract and I have the evidence if anyone is just willing to look at it. Whatever, these guys were only half of the work that I was doing. In reality, my business was focused on helping Lil Peep, JuiceWRLD and XXXTENTACION in healing their souls by using a living anchor to repair mine while I did theirs. The living anchor was Post Malone (Austin Richard Post) and I need help extending a thanks to him for his wanting in going ghost hunting through astral projection. During the time that I was aiding Peep, Juice and X through Austin Richard, I was met with the horror of the three of them being snatched by an entity that would not show itself right away and that I would later come to see as Hercules. Hercules decided he would play games with me by taking these three younglings, hiding their souls in different dimensions and twisted realms, and torturing me using vibrations while he tried to possess me as James in order to ruin Mercury's God Plan for me. James is not only the name of my guide, it is the name of my grandfather, and it is the name that can be spelled in so many ways like Kobe. I went frantic in searching for them while coming across cool souls like Anthony Bourdain, Paul Walker and Kate Spade. As a living human being, it is impossible for me to know what the other side truly looks like, so I clung onto the one living energy that I can recognize anywhere, and that was the vibe of Julian Casablancas from The Strokes. While using that vibration to focus, other sounds would come in and I would have to decipher if I should accept them because most of my contracts are with musical people. Sadly, their way on coming was through the sounds of dead people. Heath Legder's laugh, Amy Winehouse's \"Me and Mr. Jones\", Mac Miller's coughing, Mitch Lucker's sneaks squeaking against a stage floor, Scott Weiland screeching and pulling cables, D.J. Adam on a turntable, AVICII (Tim Bergling) screaming in Swedish and then in Romansch are just a few examples. There were sounds of horror and mayhem as well but they did not disturb me as much as AVICII crying. (Btw, Avici is a place with no waves, it's a Hell. Google it.) Things I did not want to hear backed up by things I did not want to see or know about were brought up though some nice things were added in. I discovered the reason why I loved Joey Jordison from Slipknot so much as they allowed me to use their identity on the other side for cover. I took a couple of blows as Jordison because people call me Joey since Jose is my Dad's name. This was only to have Nathan Jonas Jordison Wells forfeit life for me to continue living. It breaks my heart because Joey was one of the most influential musicians in my era but I knew it would happen because I would have to give up something I really loved in order to have Chris and Jim and many others returned. I gave up a lot of things that I loved while I was on the other side and much of that came with people I saw during my childhood. My childhood had many faces in it, stars mostly, but the one star that I had an encounter with during said journey was a soul I confused for MGK then Ghostmane while searching for Peep. It was Aaron Carter, the elder and sad face of Aaron Carter, and he told me he was going to die. This made no sense to me because he was so young and whatever but I ended up seeing how it would happen when I tried to use the bathroom. It was hard to understand because how could I? I walk into the bathroom for a piss and I almost have a stroke seeing Aaron Carter drowned in my tub. I figured it was this entity I had not known yet to be Hercules joking with me and messing around because Aaron Carter was someone I obsessed over as  a little girl. I knew that Hercules was using Phobos \\*reference Mars\\* to cause fears so I ignored Aaron because the one I truly drooled over was Jesse McCartney. (I was like 8, stfu) The future is never definitive but what I saw was a reality in another plane and then it happened on this planet's plane and now the ghost of Aaron Carter is hanging out. This was not what I imagined would occur in real life, and since Aaron had not died in 2020 or 2021, I thought that things would be okay, but then he f\\*\\*\\*ing died. So like, do you see my issue? BTW, the dates you are born on and the dates you die on are very significant. In this life I have a birth path number eight and I was born on the 24th of May as a Grace because of Brian Jones having been murdered. (Read up on Kobe Bean Bryant, thx.) The time you were born is also important and not only for natal charting. Example, I was born at 10:31 A.M. because it is the date of death that belongs to River Phoenix. River and I go very way back, all the way to my first life and his second one. He loves me a bunch no matter how far away it may seem considering he's a blue ghost. (River drowns those who he feels not so good towards and in multiple life times Aaron was one of those guys. River did not die a good death and his living life was torture. This means that he is a poltergeist and he is dangerous if provoked. When he possesses a body, he sickens them with substances, they fall apart and he keeps on. Capeesh?) In all seriousness though, please listen, grace means John. Jones, like Lewis Brian's means John. Christopher John Cornell died by hanging for having someone like a Tom. (Tom means twin, google it and then find out that Layne Staley was a Thomas but that AVICII was called Tom Hangs.) Chester Bennington Johnson, Keith John Moon Hopely and John Simon Ritchie died too over being graces. Per Yngve Ohlin used to be a Yohen, it means John also but in another language. Nancy, like Spungen, who John Simon did not murder, was a grace too. It is what Nancy means; google it if you don't believe. Anyway, I have a message for Frances Bean Cobain and I would appreciate some assistance in delivering it. THX. #NIRVANA \n\n\\+++also: the ghost of Brian Jones can cause sleep paralysis and he appears as a shadow person. He can possess the bodies of anyone named Lewis/Louis/Loise, Brian, Erik/Henrik/Heinmerik, Jake/Hop/Kobe (James and he and Morrison used to possess each other's bodies all of the time when they lived their previous cycle), John, Simon, Phillip or just Phil, Gilbert, William, Penelope, Marie, Samantha, Barbara, Isabel/Elizabeth and a bunch of others I do no want to get into. His choice article to haunt is either his pool, his home or power rangers. I found out about the power rangers in a very horrific way.\n\nP.S. as for the Welsh guitarist in Manic Street Preachers, Richard James Edwards, stop looking for him. End the search 4real.",

        "text": "Hi i am 23 year old and i wanted to see if anyone had anything similar to this story or similar experience to share because i am not scared of the story i am about to tell you\n but i am fascinated and when i think about it feels weird to this day. The story is back when i was 16 and i have a sister she was 15 than. We lived in a small village \n(on the balkan so you have a better visualisation what it looked like) and we had a small house with 3 rooms a small bedroom for the 4 of us (mom,dad,me and my sister), a small hallway and an even smaller kitchen, these were the 3 seperate rooms\nin the whole house. So in order to go to the kitchen or the bedroom u must be in the hallway (this is important for the story). Our parents weren't home for more than 7 hours and me and \nmy sister both know how to cook so most of the time it was up to us what we gonna eat. That day i was hungry and i decided to go cook something and went in the kitchen and we had one of those old electric stoves and on one of the burners there was already a pot filled with water and i dont remember if it had anything else inside and i was planning to cook there so i turned on one of the burners \nand keep in mind that its an old model so you need to put a little preassure to the thing you are rotating for heatness level. So i put it on max and i was like im gonna feed the dogs while \nit gets heated because it needed minute and i was planning to just give the food and come back. We have a huge yard and only one path that leads to our house and 3 dogs free (thats how it is\nhere, dogs are free and not tied) and they only attack if you come to our yard and none of us come out which means we are not home, anyway i went outside and i went to feed them and i played \nwith 2 of them for about 5 mins and i remembered the burner i turned on and i rushed home and when i opened the door of the hallway i saw steam and smoke coming through the closed door of the \nkitchen and when i entered the hallway my sister came out the bedroom and was like \"what did you do, omg \" and i was like i was out for 5 minutes. BTW i was \nalso shocked what is happening cause i just turned on one of the empty burners but instead of turning on an empty burner i turned on the one which had a pot i opened the door and it just blew a hot steam\n and smoke and i turned on the lamp and my sister was in the hallway looking at the kitchen and when i looked all the burners were turned off and the pot stays on a literally red burner which was heated to the max\nmeaning that it was turned off like 30 seconds ago and i looked at my sister and asked her if she turned it off and she replied \"no, when i smelled the smoke i came out and i saw you and even\nif i saw this before you i wouldnt just turn off the burner are you stupid i would've moved the pot\" and i know she was telling the truth because we never prank each other like never and her\nface was all weirded out by that too.",

        "text": "All my life nighttime and dreaming have been a difficult experience. I seemed to get nightmares constantly, ever since I could remember. I get sleep paralysis at least twice a month basically since I was 12 or so. \n\nI've learned to deal with it. I find myself figuring out that I'm in a dream more often than normal seemingly as a way of stopping these nightmares for myself. Nowadays anytime I see that tall hat guy at the edge of my bed I just close my eyes and go back to sleep.\n\nHowever, one aspect of my dreams is different, and I can't seem to find a logical explanation for them.\n\nEvery dream I have, whether it's a nightmare or a happy dream, has this same group of faceless people (?) staring at me. There is always 7 of them, they appear to be wearing some sort of grey robes, and their faces are blank. No eyes or mouth, just an empty patch of skin.\n\nNormally they will be in the background of the dream, and they never have anything to do with the narrative or people in the actual dream. They just stand in a group staring at me, their heads turning to follow my movements as I walk past them. \n\nI never really acknowledge them in the dream, it's like they were just inserted into my head, so my brain has no idea how to react to them and ignores their existence.\n\nAnother weird thing about them is I feel no negativity from them. Nothing positive either really, but I am never afraid when I see them in my dreams. Even when they first began appearing when I was a child, I never felt threatened or any sinister vibes from them, which is strange because visually they should be scary to a child.\n\nThey definitely don't feel like part of my brain, they almost feel like a parasite. A benign one though, at least for the moment. I don't know what they want or how they relate, but somehow, I feel like they have something to do with my terrible dreams and sleep paralysis. However, if that were the case, why do I feel no negativity towards them? Are they harmful or helpful, or simply existing in my subconscious?\n\nAny theories or ideas would be greatly appreciated.",

        "text": "Previously I posted about the \"Psst Psst\" ghost that is hanging around at our house. \n\nA couple of days ago I happened upon a couple of old EVP's that my oldest daughter took; one was taken during the night after everyone was asleep, then the second was the next day in the garage right below where the stairs drop to enter the attic (both were taken late 2018). I had completely forgotten about them. Having listen to them both, new conversations with both of my daughters about this situation has brought new information about old experiences to light and I will share those with you all in this post.\n\nI received a lot of great feedback from you all with my last post \"Psst Psst\" Ghost and I listened to each and every one of you. Your questions and opinions did not go unnoticed so thank you all. \n\nWith this post I will try to give more information about our house (except the address) LOL as to try to answer what questions you all might've had. I do work so I have been unable to go to City Hall or to the library for major research of our property, but I have done some research and I will share that with you guys in this post. \n\nI will say that we live in Texas, so as some of you may know, there aren't many basements to be found here. We don't have the best ground for it. Our house does not have a basement. It was built in 1980. All brick home, great bones. Our family are the second owners of this house and my parents knew the previous owners and have been friends with them for a very long time. My mother was a teacher with the previous owner's wife. We do not have a furnace as some of you asked this on my previous post. Our HVAC system used to be in the attic above my parents restroom but it was original and old and leaking so it was completely taken out and replaced by the outside unit that we have today, this was done many years ago so all of the sounds of the unit kicking off and on are familiar to all of us and have been for a very long time, I believe the unit has been replaced twice now. We have owned this house for at least 30 years. In retrospect, this not an old house. The floors are carpeted with cement underneath the carpet so there are no squeaky wood floors. It is a flat so there are no living quarters above us. Just the scary ass attic. LOL...not really LOL. All appliances are electric with the exception of the water heater. This is kept up to code as my father keeps up with this seeing as it's running with gas. All of the windows are double paned windows, and the house is insulated very well. Yes, the house shifts as the weather changes through the seasons but not enough for the doors to not stay closed and the knobs to not work properly. Opening/closing/slamming the front door does not cause any of the other doors to open or shut. Trust me I've tried and at different times of the year. \n\nAs soon as you walk in the front door directly in front of you is the living room, dining room and to the left from the dining room is the kitchen. You can see the back door directly across from the front door. When you come in the front door you take an immediate left and there is a long hallway, 1st door on the right is the bathroom, first door on the left is my bedroom, walk down at the end of the hallway to the left is my little brother's old room (currently my youngest's daughter's room) and directly across from her room is a small closet then my parent's room next to that. \n\nSince the day we moved in (I was 16) I have always had an ominous feeling. I was raised in the church but around this time, a lot had happened in my family, and we all stopped going. I was never able to sleep with my door open, and to this day it still feels like there is someone dark waiting for you in that stupid hallway, when I leave my room at night to go to the bathroom or the kitchen, I always feel like someone is gaining on me, I can NEVER walk fast enough through that damn hallway. Hearing footsteps in the attic. Now after years of this happening as a teenager I decided to make a Ouija board of my own to try to use, but I never used it. I tried to burn it and it would not burn. I left it at a friend's house. I lost contact with her years ago. Then I tried to make another one with one of the shelves from my closet and I never finished that one. That board is still in my closet, letters faced down. Could I have made things worse? Yes, definitely. But, as a stupid teenager, I thought I knew what I was doing. It's one of the biggest regrets to this day. \n\nMy youngest daughter and I have both heard footsteps coming from the attic above the kitchen area, on separate occasions and at the same time on other occasions and in different areas of the house, but always coming from the attic. Before I came back home, my room was made into a computer office. My daughter was in there and literally watched the doorknob turn and the door slowly open but to find that no one was on the other side of the door. My father had not gotten home from work yet and my mother was sitting in the living room on the couch watching TV. My daughter ran to the living room to my mother crying in fear explaining what had happened and of course my mother dismissed it and said it was all in her head and it's all because we watched scary movies...I am rolling my eyes right now. On another occasion, my oldest daughter was sitting in the kitchen alone, everyone was already asleep. I was working nights at the time. She stated that she heard footsteps coming from the living room and suddenly got an overwhelming sense of dread and it felt like the was being watched from the backyard window in the kitchen, the washroom, which stems off the kitchen and from the living room, she froze. Her sister was asleep at the other end of the house, so she called me crying and extremely panicked, I had to call my youngest so she could get to the kitchen so she could get my older daughter out of the kitchen. \n\nI also have an aunt (my mom's youngest sibling) who hates the kitchen area and hallway. Any time she's been there at night, if my mother goes to her bedroom, my aunt follows right behind her. \n\nListening to this 6-hour recording of the kitchen, living room and dining room area...has been insane. I can hear footsteps, kitchen chairs moving, the bathroom door opening, banging and knocking sounds. I can also hear someone that is so close to the recorder that you can hear them breathing, and heavy...with their mouth open. It's nauseating. \n\nBefore anyone says anything, yes, I can differentiate between the sounds of when the refrigerator compressor kicks on and off, when the ice maker drops the ice, and the water refills the tray. \n\nNow, this \"Psst Psst\" ghost or whatever the hell this thing is, that we are hearing now, is new. This thing is calling out to us, and I don't know why. We do not have any automatic air fresheners that spray, none of us at the house use any spray forms of cooking spray such as Pam or things like that. \n\nI am still at the mid mark of this recording, and I have a feeling it's just going to get worse as it plays on. \n\nI will keep you all updated. When I am finished with the recording, I will post this as well. \n\nThanks again. I am fine answering any and all questions that you all have.",

The previous owners were an elderly couple and their dog, nothing weird or special.\n\nOur entire family has been having odd experiences since we moved in. Here's a rough timeline of events:\n\n• sump pump door open 2x\n• stove gas being turned on 2x\n• hot water heater turned down\n• niece and brother feeling uncomfortable in basement, and niece claiming shadow people and sleep paralysis *only* while sleeping in the basement\n• apparition of a man with a hat in kitchen, next to basement stairs. Shoulders up, *not* a shadow, seen in daylight\n• basement light turned off\n• attic space door open\n• all 4 cameras go off at once at night\n• Dad's headlights came on at midnight\n• Brother saw a figure peeking into the kitchen on the landing to the basement\n• Fan turns on by itself \n\nAnd these happened at various times or I couldn't place them on the timeline:\n\n• several instances of perfume smells\n• 2 incidents of cigarette smells\n• mom and brother hearing voices that sound like our own/names\n• attic door and fan being fussed with\n\nDoes anyone have any idea of what may be going on? It's also worth noting that there is always strife and stress in the house, it's a huge bundle of negative energy and I wouldn't be surprised if negative entities attached themselves to the house.",

I got up, sniffed my blankets, pillows, my husband, my dog (in his crate, he usually sleeps in the bed these days). I check the dog crate and shoes- completely clean. My husband farts a lot but its never been so strong to wake me up and send me on a hunt to find this smell. \n\nI started smoking weed again, and was too lazy to play with my dog the other night. I noticed him playing seemingly with someone or something. I always joke about the ghost of the sweet old lady who lived in our home before us. I thought to myself if that's really her, show me. And I felt this force come right at my face through the air right where my dog was staring and his eyes and head whipped around to look at me as if he just witnessed something fly towards me. I felt it hit me and I couldn't believe this feeling. I felt like she was urging me to stop smoking so I can have the energy to give my dog this much needed attention. I didn't stop smoking and now this smell happened last night. I've also noticed a ringing in my ear recently, but that just might be tinnitus. I ran out of weed last night and I think I can say im officially done smoking for now, and definitely done smoking habitually. Has anyone experienced anything like this or know of anyone with a similar story? I'm a little spooked and anything helps!",

        "text": "The \"Fake\" Haunted House I Work At Is Actually Haunted\n\nFor 12 years, I've worked as an actor for a local Haunted House Attraction. It's a lot of fun, as I get to play a variety of horror characters and act out different scenes. \n\nWhile the tours we put on are clearly fake, there's a lot that goes on behind the scenes that isn't. \n\nI should start off by explaining that the building we do this out of is extremely old and was once an elementary school.  \n\nWe gutted the section of the building that was classrooms and constructed it to what we needed. This is when we actually started having weird experiences.\n\nThere's plenty of activity that can be shrugged off such as feeling watched and hearing footsteps running in areas there is no one. \n\nThen there are things not so easy to disregard. \nSuch as one evening, a member was working on hooking up our sound system by himself. He had not even hooked the large speakers up yet when he stated a loud deep growl came booming through them.\n\nThis terrified him so much he ran out of the building and would not go back in to even lock up until another member came down to go in with him. He never worked alone in the building again. \n\nOther activity seems playful and child-like, such as hearing small giggles and whispering in the halls and in rooms that are empty. Things being moved from where we last placed them. \n\nOne year, I was in a rocking chair that I would jump out of as a group came through. The thing about the rocking chair is it was more like a glider and it was broken. I would have to use a lot of force to get the chair to rock backwards at all. \n\nIt was right before show time, I was sitting in this broken chair getting mentally pumped for the night ahead. I was completely alone when I felt someone grab onto the back of the chair and harshly pull it backwards. I felt myself flying backwards with the chair and I honestly thought I would flip out of it. \n\nThankfully, this did not happen and as soon as I stabled myself I jerked to see who had done this. The room I was in was large and no one could get out of this room without me seeing them running away in the split second  it took me to look behind me. \n\nThere was absolutely no one there and I was suddenly covered in goose bumps. No one was even in the area around my room at the time.\n\nLater that same night, the lights were off, my stobe was on and a group had just left my room when I noticed a small figure in the far right corner of the room. \n\nIt look like a small child crouching down looking my way and I was immediately worried that a child had been left behind from the previous group. \n\nAs I headed towards the figure to ask if they were okay, the strobe flashed and the figure was completely gone. \n\nThis same year but different night, I was again sitting in my chair waiting for the next group when someone or something growled right into my ear. It was so loud that it caused my ear to ring and when I turned to see what it was there was nothing but an empty room. \n\nI changed rooms the next year and did not experience as much creepy phenomenon. \n\nThere's not much history I've been able to find out about the building, but I'm so curious as to what could be causing all the weirdness. \n\nThis is only a tiny bit of what has been experienced over the years working there and I don't feel it will be stopping any time soon!",

At first I thought it was a helicopter or something like that but the light was too close to us for it to be that and as we went running towards his house the light changed directions and turned towards us like it was chasing us. Next thing I know it's 4 hours later and we're coming to, like out of a daze, in his living room. We have no memory of getting up the steps and going in the house or what happened in those 4 hours that are missing. For the last year I have slowly been getting flashbacks of that night and in those flashbacks are scenes which are so strange that feel real but don't make sense. I'm on a table with several creatures, which is the only way I can describe them because I know they're not human but are somewhat shaped like humans, surrounding me. It seems as if they're talking but they don't move their mouths and I'm hearing them in my head but I don't really understand what they're saying. My question is how do I know these flashbacks/memories are real and how do I get the rest of my memory from that missing time back?",

I continued to hear the breathing and feel the mattress depressed beside me. I then felt a pressure on my chest, weighing me down, pushing me into the mattress and I was paralyzed. I tried yelling out but I had no voice. I couldn’t move. Somehow I slumped out of the bed and crawled - I could not walk - to my grandparents bedroom. I woke them up and told them somebody was in my room. My grandpa came and rebuked whatever it was out of the room and rubbed olive oil on my forehead (he was a priest). After he did that I felt totally safe and went right back to bed. It was one of the strangest, unexplainable things that’s ever happened to me and I’ll never forget it. (In that same house the bathroom faucets would turn on by themselves when my brother and I were alone but that’s a different story)",

So after that I would go down there before work to turn the light off and when I would come back home it would be on again. This where it gets creepier I would hear a boom sound on my days off and when I would go down the stairs from my bedroom which is on the 3rd floor the light would be on again . I decided to set up a camera in my basement (iPhone) and found this invisible figure lined up against the wall and floating towards the back of the basement. Now more booms and lights on and off I NEED HELP!!!!",

It’s so bad that I have to work up the nerve to reach out of my covers and turn my lamp on. My husband doesn’t notice it. We also have 3 kids. The youngest is 6 and one night he started screaming “who is turning my lights on?” and then he ran out of his room in a panic. He asked who was messing with him but nobody was near his room. He sleeps with his ceiling fan on and the light is turned off by the ceiling fan cord. There’s no way he can reach it and the light was on. A few nights later he begged to have a certain porcelain doll removed from his closet. Tonight he ran out of his room again saying he saw a person in a green shirt with a knife trying to kill him. He’s only 6! Wtf! I’m not saying anything paranormal is going on, but I have felt some creepy ass vibes myself. I believe in ghosts and spirits..my grandpa who passed away was a priest and would use holy water, olive oil, and prayers to cast out “bad vibes” when I was a kid and it worked. (I had a few experiences as a child that were even more unsettling). Anyway, should I cleanse my house and son’s room to see if it helps? How do I do it?",

Also I was around 13, no mental health issues that would make me hallucinate, no substances in my body etc. I am being as accurate as I can be.\n\nPreface to say my friends older sister was possibly into occult practices. Around that time she was taking a roadkill cat and bleaching it presumably for display. She also had a black and red theme in her room. I don't remember the specifics it could be completely unrelated. Take this with a grain of salt but I think I remember it being obviously satanist themed.\n\nSo as we were all sitting in the living room the older sister mentions that the house is haunted they all seem very serious like an \"oh yeah we almost forgot to tell you this,\" tone. I honestly didn't really care that much and had forgotten about it. \n\nSo we go to sleep and I wake up very groggily to a garbage truck outside. It seems to go on forever so I check the time and it was something like 3am (of course). I get very scared and bolt up because I realised that it was not a truck but the chairs in the kitchen moving. It must have gone on for 10 minutes or more very loudly until it stops. I don't hear any footsteps walking away.\n\nMy friend actually told me to wake him up if I hear the chairs but I didn't want to bother him and he seemed actually a little upset that I didn't. He also told me hes looked into the kitchen when it was happening and didn't see anyone in there. I also had him ask his sister if she had anything to do with it and she says no every time and I have asked off and on for a couple years. That was also the last time the chairs ever moved.",

He described them as small, but one not as little as the other, wearing jeans. Since he was in delirium, I didn't think much of it as it was probably a hallucinations and they were upsetting him since he said they were going into his stuff, didn't know who they belonged too, and one boy ate chili and began crying.\n\nI looked into the paranormal side of things, and I was under the impression, visitors are just that, visiting. They don't tend to bother or torment the one they are visiting. These boys would bug him getting into his stuff and were not tormenters, but they were upsetting him, so I told the boys to please go back to where they came from since they were upsetting him.  I asked him if they had names, and he said the boys would not answer him or really respond to him, and would hide around when I was around him. Again, I thought it just a hallucination.\n\nAnother night passes, and suddenly there is a little girl. Same thing, he doesn't know who she is or where she came from or who she belongs too. It bothers him because it's some strange child visiting him that he doesn't recognize, and he wants to know who the parents are. With \"little girl\" he would make faces at her, playful faces trying to entertain her, but he never gave an age range of little girl.  I do know, he and his late wife (she died 17 years prior) had two babies, male and female, that died shortly after death back in the 50s. Part of me though this little girl could be his late daughter visiting.\n\nSome nights pass, and suddenly there are children, about 4 boys, 3 girls. He recognizes none of them and wonders who let all these kids in? They continue to, for a lack of a better term, hang around him until he slips out of consciousness, then when he regains consciousness, they are still around, looking in this dresser, and he is upset because he does not know who these children belong too.\n\nI brush it off as his delirium, and a week passes. His condition is in the state of he started his death rattle, and so his younger sister and niece come to visit him. It is emotional, but they came in the late afternoon and the hospice nurse was going to come by and check on his health, so his sister and niece went to visit his younger brother who is in a nursing home, not dying, but he had his legs removed. They visit him, hours pass, then they return back to see him again before they head back to their homes. \n\nHis niece tells his daughter something interesting his brother had said during their visit. The brother was upset and irritated, thinking that my grandfather had died or he was going insane. He had told his sister and niece that he swore, for the life of him, he had heard on a previous day (no specific day was given to me, but the day of, day before, or two days prior it sounded like), he heard his brother, my grandpa, calling out to him which freaked him out. Even more so, my grandpa was with a group of children, all laughing and playing. This made him wonder if he was going insane because he didn't know any kids, didn't recognize the voices or understand why his brother would be with a group of children, and he wondered if he had died. My aunt told him that no, he was still alive, which put his mind at rest, but when they left him, he was still upset thinking he might be going insane.\n\nHis daughter called me over (as I have been staying to help take care of him) and told me to tell them about the kids. I didn't know yet what my grandpas brother said to them, so I told them about how he was seeing the kids, two at first, then more and eventually that little group of children. They told me what his brother had said and it sent a shiver up my spine.\n\nThere is no way my aunt knew about the kids until I told her, and likewise there is no way his brother would have known since he has strict visits (due to Covid and nursing home rules). His niece believes he is transitioning from this world into the next, and he was checking in on his younger brother. His sister, whom is also his younger sister, said that my grandpa had done this his entire life, he was always the protective good big brother, watching out for his little siblings, and believes he might have somehow visited his brother to check on him, since my grandfather could no longer call him on the telephone.\n\nI've never heard of groups of kids visiting someone who is dying, and this experience is a bit spooky to me and I thought I would share it. It's just so weird to me because his brother experienced the same thing, and his brother is not dying, and was so confused and upset by hearing my grandpa call out to him and seeing he was with a group of kids. Yet my grandfather was not dead when this happened.\n\nI am curious to find if there is indeed reasons why maybe, groups of children visit someone dying? Not finding much information, but figured I would share this story here with all of you since it is spooky to me. \n\nIf anyone has specifically heard why a group of kids, unrelated possibly, to someone who is dying appear to them, then I would love to hear it.",

It was a perfect sphere but the middle was indented kind of like an Oreo cookie. \n\nIt was so close and enough sun outside that I could see that it was made out of something metallic on the tops and bottoms. It was brown almost like bronze or rusted metal. The middle was  a different material like a white strip. It was just sitting there all most like it was staring at me. There were no propellers or thrusters on it and it wasn’t hovering up and down like other aircrafts or drones do it was just sitting there perfectly still. It stayed for minutes and I just stared at it.\n\nThe part where people don’t believe me is so hat I couldn’t take pictures of it because I locked my phone in my car. I swear i felt like it was mocking me just showing itself almost knowing I couldn’t capture it. It was such an odd feeling. I look around to see if anyone else is looking at it and nobody is. When I look back up it’s completely gone. I still have no idea what it was but maybe you guys know a little more about this stuff than I do.",

        "text": "Backstory: When I was 2, my dad was a semi truck driver. While on one of his deliveries, his brakes failed and he got into a bad accident resulting in a very bad head injury that would cause seizures every now and again. My dad was sick most of my life (up until when he died when I was 9) and He was bedridden most of the time.\n\nMy father was a DEVOUT Pentecostal Christian with a no-nonsense attitude and he never ever believed in ghosts or anything of that nature. I grew up in a haunted house and distinctly remember him getting irritated with me when I ran to him terrified of encounters that I have had.\n\nOne Christmas Eve in 2002 when I was about 7 years old, my family had their annual Christmas party but dad was upstairs in bed resting. I remember getting excited as someone dressed up as Santa and I ran upstairs to tell dad that Santa was there… But when I went into dads room, it was dark aside from a single lit candle on the dresser. My dad lie on his back, looking forward. He told me he saw Death.\n\nI remember this encounter so vividly to this very day 20 years later. My father said that at the foot of his bed was this hovering, cloaked figure with red eyes but no face. Dad said the very second I entered the room, the entity darted out of the room through the wall.\n\nI believe it 100%. My dad never filled our heads with ghost stories or anything that would scare his kids. Again, he was a no-nonsense man and I believe that experience changed his views a bit that day.\n\nMy dad passed from an aneurysm on November 11, 2005. My last memory of him was seeing him deep in a seizure before I had to leave for school. I believe that the entity was a warning but I’m open for discussions on what you all think it could have been.",

I have dealt with so many \"ghosts\", \"poltergeists\" and other things like shadow people this way.\n\nMethod: lay down in the dark and spend 10-15 minutes 100% focused on a mental image of your body, slowly focus down to your core (between your belly and chest) and imagine a bright while glowing ball of energy there, this is your life force, unlike any of these entities it's supported by your physical body and is infinitely stronger, now imagine ropes or beams of light extending from it, filling the room, moving around the building, finding anything it can that is negative and feel it absorbed into your light.

Then, these black shadow figures will move past the center of my vision to my peripheral. It actually looks like people walking too, not just floating and they usually appear to go in one direction but sometimes they'll go in an opposite direction, and it's always horizontal movement. It looks like a person walking across a red background. It usually doesn't disturb me when I see them however sometimes my senses are heightened and it brings a sense of unease. Has any one else ever experienced this? Do you know what it is?\n\nLooking forward to hearing some thoughts on this.",

Above my bed is a shelf that goes right around the headboard, I have a few things on it, candles, pictures, and lights.\n\nAbout 5 or 6 months ago, my boyfriend wasn't staying over and I was just about to go to sleep when I heard this weird rocking noise from right above my head. I sat up and looked around and I couldn't understand what would make that noise. I forgot about it after that until about a month later my boyfriend wasn't staying over again and it happened again.\n\nI started tapping things around my bed to see what could make that noise and found out it was a candle, so the next day I threw the candle out. A few weeks later, we were lying on my bed and I said to my boyfriend that it was so weird that the noise hadn't happened since I threw out the candle. Then that exact night, there was a huge bang that came out of my water bottle. This one terrified me because it was so, so loud.\n\nIt hadn't happened in ages and then one night randomly, the rocking noise was back. I went tapping things again the next day to see what it was and found out it was a different candle holder. I've included a video of this one. It was rocking back and forth as if someone touched it in the middle of the night because it was on a slight ledge. I moved it off the ledge and then last night it didn't rock, it was as if someone was tapping it with a spoon instead.\n\nHas anyone got any advice on what could cause this? I feel like it has to be a spirit trying to contact me about something because it is so persistent. I'm not scared by it, as I feel like it is loved. But I'm really not sure what they're trying to contact me about or tell me. I would love to know if anyone else has experienced something similar.",

Brought one friend with me on the hike since it was a long one. The area and scenery were beautiful, but the tunnel itself was something else. My buddy (let's just call him Ed) was a bit more nervous than me and didn't wanna go too far in. I wanted to go as far as I could, which turned out not to be far, because the tunnel was blocked by impassible debris. But wait! There was a small hole on the side of the debris mound and it turns out I could crawl through, so I asked \"Hey Ed you feel like crawling?\" \"Naaaah dude no thanks.\" So I took off my pack and coat and squirmed through. On the other side was the rest of the tunnel, but with water that went up to nearly the top of the mound on the other side, as far as the eye can see. Dang. I would have to swim in ice cold nasty water for who knows how long to keep exploring. Nah. So I decided to crawl back. My buddy Ed was nervous, but we weren't done yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext we busted out just one tool for detecting ghosts. EMF reader. As someone who is pretty scientific I tested it multiple times and made sure it was working before bringing it. We decided to try and contact ghosts in the tunnel. I was pretty confident nothing would happen. We turned off all our electronics and lights so it was pitch black with just the emf reader on. I asked pretty basic questions to the ghost, asked it to come in front of my scanner so I'd know it was there, etc. We did this for awhile. Nada. No reading. No surprise. So we headed back. Decided to keep my emf reader on. And then as we were walking back. Suddenly it goes to 2 lights. Thought maybe our flashlights were causing it, so we turned them off. Nope. Still 2 lights. Reset the device. 2 solid lights. \"I think somethings here dude.\" My adrenalin started flowing into my body now, yet I was still skeptical. I started asking it questions again, and then my emf signal got even stronger, and we both were getting chills and the hairs on our skin were standing up. Around this time we heard something, kinda sounded like a distant cough, but it was so fast it was easy to dismiss.I reset the device again. Still getting a strong signal from...something. And it's not coming from us. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then said \"Is it alright if we stay in the tunnel with you a bit longer? Meter instantly went back to 0. Surprised, but confident now I asked \"Do you want us to leave?\" Then it INSTANTLY went back up to high. OK, I was pretty convinced at this point. We headed for the entrance to the tunnel and discussed our expierience.. however, when we were at the entrance, we noticed that the emf was picking up another signal, just above and to the side of us now. But if you pointed it in a different direction there was nothing. We left after that, but we think the ghost may have been hanging out by the entrance waiting for us to leave.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou could always say that the emf was faulty, or picking up something else, but I'm sure that device was working. I tested it so many times before and after, and there was nothing on us producing emf. Also considering that we didn't get any reading in there for the vast majority of the time we were there. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTruly mind boggling. Still processing it",

        "text": "I've always been lonely, maintaining realionships felt like a chore, trying to force a smile and pantomime along with the usual script. So one day I decided I'd make my own friend, Casper. I always envied little kids who  have their imaginary friends and decided to get my own in my mid teens. I didn't make up a lot about Casper, I always imagined a lonely boy, quiet and good natured, there to listen, invisable to the world. It was absurd and humilatibg that I made up an imaginary friend. So I'd mostly joke around about him when I was with others. But when I was alone I'd drop to my knees and poor out my heart to an empty room, telling him my problems, my hopes, and dreams, how much I hated myself as a person. \n This summer I had headed down the deep south, the lower border of Missippi and Louisiana. I go down there for a change of scenery and give myself a mental health vacation. But things were bad when I got down there, I never stayed at one house for more than a day and learned to keep everything I needed in my backpack. I was tossed around from house to house, my backpack and I staying together as I was pingponged around. One weekend I stayed at my cousins house. We were only 2 days apparently in age, and shared many of the same interests. We spent the night running around with fake Katanas and whatching anime. My cousin has a terrible fear of the concept of other entities. So as we layed in bed together getting ready to turn off the light. I told her that there's nothing to worry about, my best friend Casper was here. He might seem a little creepy but he's fiercely loyal to those he loves and protect us from any harm. I pointed right next to the bed and smiled saying goodnight Casper! Turned out the light and that was it.\n\n    The next day we got up early, we were going to meet up with my cousins coworkers to go to a haunted historcal sight, Myrtle Mansion in Louisiana. All packed and ready to leave I took one long look at my backpack and decided to leave it behind, it had everything I owned and I loved it, but it would just be unessary weight. So I dropped it on my cousins bed, right on the foot of the bed. Bolth of us rember me putting it there. We head out meeting our group at the restaurant they all worked at a few miles into town. We all headed to the back, started  and hopped into their truck. Sitting in the back I feel somthing at my feet and look down to see a backpack, but it looked just like mine. I slowly reach down and unzipp it, it was my backpack. I had never been in this truck in my life. They didn't even know my name much less were I was staying. My cousin and I bolth conformed I left my backpack in the house, in her bedroom. Yet somehow a 20 pound backpack magically appeared. I was shook, my imaginary world had just bled into the real world. I stared at that backpack for the whole 2 hour car ride. When we arrived I questioned everbody, they knew nothing, not even that I had a bag in the first place. I look at my cousin and then around me as the tourists bustled around us. Then I got a text. A text from an old friend who I hadn't talked to awhile who was Wicca. Randomly out of the blue at that exact momment they text me asking how I was doing. I looked up and out loud thanked Casper before going into the restaurant to enjoy my day, hugging my backpack. \n\nI have a photo of our conversation, this happened on July third. It was a strange and unsettling experience. Positive non of the less.",

        "text": "ok so basically i have this memory from when i was about 8 or 9 that is very strange and i think about it a lot recently and in the last few years. I have a lot of weird experiences but i AM very skeptical and basically i don’t really believe in any of that stuff too much. But some things i just can’t like logic away. \n Anyways, when i was younger i lived in a small apartment building with my mom and siblings and i had a best friend(i’ll call her lily) who literally lived down the hall from us. Lilys mom was friends with my mom and one day they decide to go out together for i don’t know what, it’s not really relevant. But anyways, all of us children stayed in my apartment. We were all close and this was all very normal. everything happening was very normal. We were hanging out in the living room, and it was pretty dark in there. It was early day time, i remember. there were no windows in the living room though so it was dark with the lights off and the doors closed.  We were going to put on a movie to watch. and everyone is helping, trying to set up the tv, and i am standing there and i look up to where the dining room is. and i see a figure of a boy, he walks from the dinning room into the other room (the kitchen). He had almost glowing red eyes. he stared at me as he walked. Now this didn’t last very long. A few seconds. Enough that it wasn’t just something that i saw from the corner of my eye but vividly saw.  It was dark but it wasn’t THAT dark. and the apartment was very small , from where i stood to where he was, was probably about 15 feet. i know for a fact that was not a real person. And i couldn’t see him well enough to make out his face but despite that it’s like i knew exactly what he looked like even though i’ve never seen that particular figure in my life.\n  and i think about this a lot, and it’s because do you know what the craziest part of it all? It didn’t get a reaction out of me. Like 9 year old me KNEW that it wasn’t a person and it just didn’t faze me ???? i wasn’t afraid or curious or anything at all. i just went about my day almost like i knew it was nothing??? and it’s just so strange. \n\nany ideas? thoughts?",

        "text": "this is a kinda long post, sorry 😭\n\neither i’m absolutely losing my mind or there’s a ghost in my house. it doesn’t seem harmful or scary, just playful or wants me knowing it’s here. only a few small things have happened but it just feels like there could be something here. \n\nthe first thing i can at least remember happening that was somewhat obvious is when i was getting ready to take a bath. i was setting up stuff to wash my face for when i was out and i kept seeing something “flying” around above me. there were no lights under me to cause my shadow to be above me and it was moving faster than i was. a couple times it got near the shower curtains and they’d either just move or fall. i told myself it could’ve been nothing but at the same time i do believe in spirits and that it also could’ve been something there. i asked it to stop and it did, but again it could’ve just been my mind playing tricks on me for some reason. i never felt scared or threatened.\n\nthe second thing that happened definitely could be something else, i just like to think it was the spirit. i was in the kitchen making a snack and decided to wash the dishes i used to make it. i was walking up to my room when the dishes clanked together, of course not a big deal but something told me i should go check on them. turns out, i left my phone in the kitchen. just in case it wasn't a coincidence and it was a spirit (it was also kinda as a joke) i said thank you. right after i did a light switch started swinging faster than it was before. something about the whole thing felt more like a spirit than a coincidence. again, i never felt like i was scared or in any danger. \n\nafter that nothing really happened that i remember or noticed until i came back from seeing my boyfriend. we're long distance and i was visiting him for the weekend. the night i came back weird stuff was happening like crazy, i wasn't scared. i was creeped out and kinda confused at some point, but not scared. it almost felt like it was the ghosts way of saying it missed me. i dont know how or why this would be the case but it feels like this spirit just recently showed up because this had never happened any other time i came back from visiting my boyfriend. only since that one day in the bathroom. or it just didnt wanna show itself before that day. \n\nanyway, on to what was actually happening. one of the things that really scared me is the foot of my bed shook either as someone sat on it or the same way it does when my dog lays down but my dog wasn't in my room. i wanted her in there because i missed her but she wouldn't come in. i cant remember if it happened multiple times or just once. i also kept hearing random noises, which honestly i don't remember happening but i told my boyfriend about it and thats something i said to him. i wasn't falling asleep by this point yet, i was wide awake eating food and watching a video. \n\nnow this did happen while i was half asleep and falling asleep so i could've somehow done it myself but it still was the same night. so no matter what if i fall asleep and wake up again i always check my phone, mostly for the time but also any important notifications i may have gotten. i have an iPhone and had a focus on, the sleep focus. but at some point it somehow got turned off. usually if i turn it off i turn it right back on just as a way to get notifications out of the way, but it was just turned off. theres 2 ways to do that, one way the phone has to be unlocked with the newest update. the second way you have to swipe down into the control center (i think is what its called) and turn it off from there. i dont think there was any way i did either of these things falling asleep. i woke up to my arms being wrapped around a pillow and my phones on my table next to my bed. maybe i somehow did it in my sleep but i wasn't asleep for very long at all and its not often i move in my sleep. if it was a spirit thats the most that has happened in one night, and stuff kept happening through the night as i was trying to sleep. i think, if it is a spirit and im not just losing it, that it missed me and that was its way of telling me.\n\nif you read this far, thank you. ofc all of these things could easily be explained i guess i just like the thought of it being a spirit especially since it seems friendly and playful. if you don’t believe me or believe in any of this, respectfully just keep whatever you have to say to yourself and move on at least if it’s something just rude. i understand this kinda thing is hard to believe, but rude comments are just unnecessary.",

Insomnia hit and we both decided that would be a fun way to deal with our problem.\nAround 3:30 ish, we were driving in this ancient industrial park from the 1880s, which now is mostly either abandoned, empty or loading docks for the river.\nNow, this one building. I feel somewhat hesitant discussing any major details, but I know that the building has had several uses, most notable is as a factory that made old light fixtures and electrical wiring. Another fact is it was built on top of indigenous burial mounds.\nLast night, my friend and I saw two different things. \nWe saw one large shadow, which just kinda caught us off guard, literally peaking through the window. \nThe second was taken by my friend when he was alone, there was an empty room with a chair off to the corner, and my friend decided to take a pic cause he was creeped out. In the Live Photo you see a shadow make it’s way into the camera, but neither of us know where it could have came from. It’s also an odd shape and just generally out of place in the image. I’m gonna try to post it on here but I’m not a major Reddit aficionado, so I’ll have to figure it out.\nDo you guys have any idea what it could be? Or maybe how to evaluate it?\nIt should be posted below.",

        "text": "i'm just gonna cut to the chase and tell you what's been happening after a short introduction. hello, im kay and i've been staying over at my best friend lexie's house for the past month or so babysitting her son while she goes to work. the baby and i have both been hearing things but, it's mainly been the adults in the house who're afraid of what could possibly be lurking in the darkness of her kitchen and stairwell at the late hours of the night as well as the wee hours of the morning. i've started noticing things even before i knew what they were since i was a little girl. i moved quite a bit during my childhood and almost everywhere i went, something followed. \n\nit all started as just sounds and knocks to seeing things in the corner of my eye to shadows. nothing ever moves or flip over but there's usually presence here and there. sometimes i wonder what it could be, sometimes i mind my own business or ignore it altogether. at the different locations i moved to, it was more of just knocks, bangs and whispers. i never thought that it could get any worse but i'm glad to say that it's only been that way since then. i started seeing it the longer i was here. i'm almost certain it was getting closer since i'm always sleeping with my head towards the front door instead of by the doorway of the kitchen and living room. \n\ni never got a glimpse of what i thought was the face of the figure i saw. it was dark, **really** dark. as if light's never touched it before. i didn't think it was possible because i've never seen anything that dark before (and i'm african american). one night, i was playing video games with my online friends and fiancé before i had told them i was gonna go get ready for bed, something behind me fell. i thought it was something from the couch that i left on the corner of the cushion, like my phone just in case i needed it, but it wasn't. there was nothing behind me, next to me, above me or in front of me besides the floor, roof, and tv. i let my friends know and they thought i was just being paranoid but told them about how her house can be a bit weird in particular especially in the kitchen. the knocks and bangs from upstairs in the whole house while rest of the complex is asleep. no one else was awake and it was about midnight. \n\ni tried to sleep it off and not think about it but as i have insomnia, i wake up almost every 3 hours. it may have been me being groggy as i woke up or my eyes playing tricks on me but i saw something move in the darkness of the kitchen. i really did. it was just a dark, slender figure and i don't know if it was facing me or not but was just there. it was unmoving, not speaking, and not floating around or even standing on the floor. but it wasn't there for long. it left. not 'turned on its heel and left' but just simply disappeared. just gone. i never saw something until that night. but i was pretty damn tired so i pulled a blanket over my head and went back to sleep. i awoke another 3 hours later to the sound of lexie's boyfriend getting ready for work. i knew lexie would be up in another hour seeing as how she'd be getting ready for work as well so i just woke up, took my vitamins and got dressed for another day of babysitting. \n\ni never had a problem with kids, it was just the way i was. but when the baby started crying and pointing at the corner i was next to, i started freaking out and finished up the dishes as well as cleaning off the wet counter and the sweeping, i blocked off the doorway to the kitchen with one of the baby gates and sat on the couch watching a show and gave him the bottle he had milk in and he was more calm and collected now that he was occupied with me. the last thing i felt before turning around and leaving the kitchen was something tugging on my shirt and i shrugged it off as my shirt getting caught on a hook on the wall. i only go in the kitchen if i really have to wash dishes or get us something to eat. if anyone has any questions or advice, i'd deeply appreciate it. we smudged the house already so that's that. it may not sound genuine, but i can promise you, that's all i can remember and put together.",

        "text": "This will be my last post (sorry if I’m annoying with the update) but I wanted to repost to say I have pictures up of the remote and rope on my profile, and I wanted to clarify some things as well. (Original post is below).\n\n- Please do not suggest I am hallucinating or having a manic episode. This is sensitive to me because my father is diagnosed manic bipolar, and I can promise you an episode is not what’s happening here.\n\n- I do have pets, 2 dogs (a German Shepard and a Beagle). Living in an apartment complex, we go for walks a few times a day but before we come back inside we stop to wipe our feet and I generally check to make sure they don’t have anything (one of them likes to steal sticks). It’s possible I guess that they could have hidden the remote in their mouths, but I wouldn’t have missed the rope. Not to mention neither of these were found after a walk. They were middle of the day discoveries. \n\n- I have lived in this apartment with my husband for 3 years. There was an older woman who lived here on her own before us. All we really know about her is that she worked at the hospital and moved out to move in with her family. Living here for 3 years, we have cleaned this apartment *multiple* times, and have moved furniture around several times as well. And still, neither of us had seen either the remote or the rope before. Also, our apartment is less than 800 square feet. We have thin walls and an upstairs neighbor (no basement or anything), so I really doubt someone is living in here with us, especially with our two dogs around.\n\n- Last thing I want to clarify is I am not 1000% sure this is something paranormal. All I know is we have exhausted every explanation this far. I happened to casually be speaking with a friend of mine who claims to have some paranormal activity in her new home, and it got me thinking about how this might be an explanation so I posted in this group. I’m not “jumping to conclusions”- just trying to either get reassurance or redirection if I am on the right path.\n______________________________\n\nA couple months ago I was in my living room doing my Pilates, with my rug out and everything. I finished, put it all away like usual, watched TV for maybe 30 minutes before I got up to get a snack. When I came back, there was a remote in the middle of my living room floor.\n\nI was immediately taken aback because I had never seen a remote like that before, and I had *just* been literally laying down on the floor where it was, and it wasn’t there. Not to mention I had been watching TV in the room, too, so it’s not like it fell from somewhere or I would have seen it. I took a picture of it and sent it to my husband, wondering if it was a lost remote to something of his but he had never seen it before either. It could turn on and had this blinking green light, so I broken it open, removed the batteries (which had writing in another language on it), and wrote the whole thing off as really weird. \n\nThen today, same sort of thing. Came out in my living room, was watching TV, everything was normal. I got up to get a cup of coffee, came back, and there was a piece of a dark braided rope, again in the middle of my living room floor. It’s like a perfectly cut segment, and looks like it may have been a handle to something, but again, I have no idea where it came from, and neither my husband or I recognized it. \n\nAnd I don’t understand what’s happening.\n\nI’m not a huge believer in the paranormal, but I can’t seem to find a good explanation. Please help- any insight is appreciated!",
