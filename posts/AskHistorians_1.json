In the Middle East, for example, the religiosity stats are different; they have a higher attendance at Friday prayers, particularly among the youth. Some argue that it was due to quality education, while others argue that secular and communist governments banned religious teachings in schools, preventing indoctrination, and that the scars of WW2 and campaigns such as the sexual revolution of 60s waned the influence of religion, resulting in the silent generation becoming irreligious, followed by baby boomers, millennials , and gen z.

        "text": "One of the national myths of Canada is that its soldiers in the first world war were specifically feared and/or respected by their German counterparts. In other words, Canadians were distinguished from other soldiers in the British Empire and seen as \"stormtroopers.\"\n\nWhile this question is asked a fair bit on this subreddit, I have never seen a good answer to it.\n\n[On the \"yes\" side](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/i2delq/what_did_germany_really_think_of_dominion_troops/g05gqnl/), /u/enygma9753 has two sources - The National Post (a Canadian right-of-centre newspaper) and the Canadian Encyclopedia. In fairness, the Post article cribs liberally from Tim Cook (the historian, not the CEO). Cook has made some points that support this thesis:\n\nCook cites an interview with a soldier from PEI: *\"The Germans call us the white Ghurkha,\" boasted Clifford Rogers, later a recipient of the Military Medal.*\n\nCook, in discussing the poet Robert Graves' memoir states: *Were the Canadians more likely to execute soldiers on the battlefield than other soldiers? Robert Graves thought so, but that reputation for fierceness was, as he rightly noted, also part of the Canadian reputation as shock troops. The Germans, too, believed the Canadians were less likely to take prisoners.*\n\nCook states, without citation: *When serving opposite the Canadians, the Germans were cautious and wary of these elite troops, but the capture of Canadian prisoners sometimes led to assaults or executions.*\n\nWhile this is not nothing, the plural of anecdote is not data. Rogers may be exaggerating or misremembering - or perhaps he's recounting one specific German soldier who was not indicative. Similarly, Graves may have distinguished Canadians from other Imperial soldiers and believed them to be \"shock troopers\" - but that doesn't necessarily mean that this was a belief on the German side.\n\nFinally, the last statement does not have a citation - so how much weight it is given is dependent on the credence you give Cook as a historian.\n\nCook, Tim. \"The Politics of Surrender: Canadian Soldiers and the Killing of Prisoners in the Great War\". The Journal of Military History, vol. 70, no. 3 (Jul., 2006), p. 651\n\n[On the \"no\" side](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/9wpyoj/why_did_canadians_have_such_a_ruthless_reputation/e9o7q6e/), /u/Superplaner notes that the commission the German High Command concluded \"nothing at all about the fighting qualities of the Canadian Corps\". He/she also notes that to the extent the Germans were keeping track of the Canadians it was because they fought as a cohesive unit. \n\n/u/Superplaner [has commented frequently on this matter but, respectfully](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/tdnl30/is_there_any_truth_to_the_notion_that_canadian/i2ypf2l/), it appears that most of his/her post on this appeals to his/her own authority. To the extent that you can point to something in a source that states something, it doesn't really matter who you are - the source can be debated on its own merits. But if your claim is \"I have reviewed this area and found nothing\", your actual credentials are important. \n\nOf course, it is important to note that while I've read a few of /u/Superplaner's comments on this matter, I have not read all of them - so it is very possible that there is a post that addresses my issues above.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/11sssxo/whose_account_about_the_destruction_of_the/",
        "text": "I've been going down something of a rabbit hole in the last day or so about this particular event, prompted by similar events in Late Antiquity, and trying to get unfiltered information on this is dizzying to say the least.\n\nThe basics, as I understand it, seem to be this - the bishop of Alexandria, Theophilus, had been given permission by the Emperor to convert some pagan temples (or just one? sources seem to vary), and during the renovation, had some individuals parade a phalli around in mockery, incensing pagan crowds to attack and kill many of these individuals. But honestly, then, sources seem to vary about what happened.\n\nThe two main disputing ones (just from my basic reading) are Sozomen and Socrates Scholasticus. Both Christian writers, they don't seem to entirely agree on certain details. Some of them are relatively minor, as to which god the phalli represented (Sozomen says Dionysus, Sorcates says Priapus), but the order of events gets more confusing from there - Socrates gives the background by saying:\n\n*\"And to begin with, he caused the Mithreum to be cleaned out, and exhibited to public view the tokens of its bloody mysteries Then he destroyed the Serapeum, and the bloody rights of the Mithreum he publicly caricatured; the Serapeum also he showed full of extravagant superstitions, and he had the phalli of Priapus carried through the midst of the forum.\"*  \n(*Historia Ecclesiastica, chapter 16.)*\n\nSo, the implication here is that the Serapeum had already been destroyed before the riots broke out, but Sozomen's account is that the rioters sought refuge in the Serapeum and it was only destroyed afterwards:  \n*\"They killed many of the Christians, wounded others, and seized the Serapion, a temple which was conspicuous for beauty and vastness and which was seated on an eminence.\"*  \n*(Chapter 7 of his own Historia Ecclesiastica, which seems to me to be a different text of the same name.)*\n\nI've noticed a discrepancy in spelling - maybe I've got this completely wrong and they were talking about different buildings, but I'm guessing that this is just an alternative romanized spelling of a Greek word?\n\nAnyway, another point is that Sozomen talks about how the pagans who fled to the Serapeum/Serapion took Christians hostage and tortured them whilst they were there, something completely absent from Sorcates', who talks about how the pagans responsible for the deaths (including two grammarians he knew personally) then realized the authorities would catch up with them and fled to various places. There's yet another account, from the Greek sophist Eunapius, who tries to make the case that the Christian mob who destroyed various temples were entirely unprovoked and that they appropriated the remains of criminals and slaves in the Serapeum, declaring them martyrs. I'm not particularly minded to believe this account, as it seems to smack of bias, but I'm willing to say the same thing about Sozomen's, given he describes exquisite torture absent in Socrates' account, and whilst Socrates acknowledges deaths and injuries on both sides of the mob violence, Sozomen only mentions Christian causalities.\n\nBut the fact is, I don't know - I'm not trained in historiography or history, and I can't pretend I'd be entirely unbiased when examining these stories either. So, with the long preamble out of the way, my main questions are:  \n1) Was the Serapeum destroyed before or after the riots?\n\n2) Is there any evidence for Christians being taken hostage and tortured besides Sozomen's account, and if so, why doesn't Socrates mention it?\n\n3) Are there any other sources that I haven't mentioned that might shed more light on this particular historical event, and its wider context?\n\nThanks in advance.",

What's more, the scientific papers all seem to be citing each other rather than going back to the primary source. (Though admittedly, without having an institutional affiliation myself at present, I only had quite a limited view over this.)\n\nMy worry is that this is citogenesis, that this has become a standard bit of introduction-padding on the science side and nobody is actually checking if this is true.\n\nCan anyone verify this? If it is real, can you add any additional context to my curiosity about Hippocrates and ADHD? I'm fascinated to know more about historical perspectives on ADHD, especially this one, as someone interested in history and coming to terms with it myself.",

Apparently, this isn't the first time he has done this, and is kind of a lolcow on the history sphere of Reddit. I have watched through some of his videos, and even though he gives some sources for his claims, nearly every video gave me \"this is just manipulative garbage\" vibes. He has gone to claim in videos linked that the Nazis had pseudo-abolished private property and was economically state-socialist, that Hitler wanted to invade the Soviet Union to \"later establish full socialism\", and in what I think is just disgusting denial of the repression the Nazis inflicted, claimed that they didn't suppress the labor movement and working conditions and workers wages actually improved ([not](https://youtu.be/wXIoVEKIpMg?t=1345) [kidding](https://youtu.be/wXIoVEKIpMg?t=1078), it sounds more like something off Stormfront than a supposedly \"anti-Nazi\" video, but apparently he frames this as a bad thing?

Becouse others say it was to create art with more emotion, while others say it was for the church to regain power and show how mighty it is?\n\n\n(Apologies if my writing is confusing, since I am kind of young and my understanding of this isn't very big + english also isn't my first language)",

        "text": "In Marek Hłasko's *The Graveyard* (set in communist-occupied Poland) there is a scene where, in a political party meeting, it is revealed that one of the party members (Nowak) has a dog named \"Sambo.\" This is met with uproar from the rest of the members and Nowak is forced to change the name of the dog to \"Red.\" I am wondering about the context of why this is such an unsuitable name for a dog. From searching it up, it seems it has historically been a racial slur, although that explanation doesn't seem to fit this scenario. Here is an excerpt from the scene:\n\n&gt;Someone cried out: \"Comrade Nowak has an Airedale terrier called Sambo. I ask you, why Sambo? We must put a stop to this, once and for all.\"  \nFranciszek recognized the voice of the young Blizniaczek.  \n\"That should be in the ad lib motions,\" people cried. \"The ad lib motions!\"  \n\"Why wait?\" other cried. \"Such things must be settled at once. One day it's Sambo, and the next day—what? Throwing napalm bombs on Korean children maybe?\"  \n\"More vigilance, comrades!\"  \n\"Disgusting!\"  \n\"Sambo! Why not Bombo?\"  \n\"So that's where you get your inspirtation, Nowak?\"  \n\"Put a stop to all this!\"  \n\"There was starvations, there was misery, there was capitalism...\"  \n\"Hand in your party card!\"\n\nAs *The Graveyard* was written as an attack on the authoritarian control of the communist party, I can see how this may just be a commentary on the absurdity of scrutinizing such a name. For example where it says \"So this is where you get your inspiration, Nowak?\" it is in reference to \"Sambo\" sounding like \"Bombo\", which is ridiculous, so maybe that's the point. Although that doesn't seem right to me. Any insights? Thank you.",

So, I would love to know about what he did in those years and the consequences for the US and the world. My fear is that a simple search will show first books that are hagiographies of the former President and I would like to see something much more mixed and nuanced (after all, President Reagan has a complicated legacy, like supply side economics and income concentration, the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, etc).

It made a lot of sense to learn this, but also made me wonder about work that prominently writes the name as “Caius,” William Shakespeare’s “Coriolanus.”\n\nWould any arrogant wannabe-classists have corrected Shakespeare about the way his actors pronounced the name “Gaius,” or was Caius accepted as a way to pronounce the name. Or, were 1600’s English actors such hyperpolyglots that everyone would’ve just know the correct pronunciation for the name “Caius Martius?”",

        "text": "I was reading about English history when i came across this \n\n“The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which was originally compiled by the orders of King Alfred the Great in approximately 890, starts with this sentence: \"The island Britain is 800 miles long, and 200 miles broad. And there are in the island five nations; English, Welsh (or British), Scottish, Pictish, and Latin. The first inhabitants were the Britons, who came from Armenia, and first peopled Britain southward\" (\"Armenia\" is possibly a mistaken transcription of Armorica, an area in northwestern Gaul including modern Brittany).[25]”\n\nImmediately the “Latin” caught my eye, who are the latin people in Britain at this time? To be counted as a nation within Britain shows that they must have had a large presence.\n\nAre these surviving romano-britons that kept their old culture? I thought that latin stopped being spoken far before this.",

There are a lot of tropes out there about guileless natives being tricked out of land, or on the other hand a sort of happy-go-lucky “everyone decided to get along and live in harmony” that I’m sure are simplifications at the very least. And in the context of LandBack, does “unceded” vs “ceded” have specific historical meaning to Indigenous groups?",

        "text": "Hello I hope this question is eligible for this sub.\nWith the abolition of the caliphate in 1924, it seems the islamic world lost a major unifying institution. The office of the Caliph is considered to be the political and religious sucessor of the prophet Muhammad. So the premise of my question is that after the abolition of the caliphate Islam was missing a central authority figure, which could be one reason why the radicalization of some parts of the islamic world from the 1950s on could happen. I'm aware of the followup Institutions like the Islamic League but maybe they didn't get the same recognition in the islamic world as the Caliphate. A lot of radical islamic groups have claimed the title of the Caliphate since then, which could be seen as support for this notion.",
