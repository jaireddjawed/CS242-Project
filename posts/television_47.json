No commercial breaks, no previously on, 1 title intro, 1 ending credits, no excessive flashbacks to previous episodes, no extremely long power up scenes like in the Dragon Ball Series. They could convert the season into a movie. Or combine many seasons together. \nIt would be amazing. They would take out like 50% of the running time. Save us all time.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

They all wear uniforms, they get daily assignments to guard a person, they write out reports at the end of the day that get stamped and filed.  There are 4 main rules they have to follow.\n\nThe new angel has questions about what they are doing and why.  No one has any answers or cares about the questions.  So the new angel pushes to learn more.\n\nIt's not a comedy in that there are no jokes.  It is not lol.  It is more absurd.  You watch to see what happens.\n\nSeveral storylines wrap up, but it ends on a reveal that would be setting up a second season that did not happen.\n\nIf you like Miracle Workers season 1 or the Good Place you should check it out.",

Other shows it‚Äôs more clear who the person in the lead role is.\n\nThe star gets the most limelight and there are the leads who are perhaps more generous in sharing more of that spotlight with some of their fellow performers that they recognize as hard workers and important contributors.\n\nWith that said, who are your favorite supporting characters who may never be suitable to be the lead in their show but are vitally important to the tone of the show or the chemistry they share with the lead/other characters or they offer a unique talent that is distinct from what the designated leaf offers.\n\nI‚Äôd say James Wilson/Robert Sean Leonard was just so extremely important and felt like the conscience of House (both the show and titular character) and while other characters were rotated in and out, you couldn‚Äôt do that with James. House probably literally would have died without his best friend and if, god forbid, something had happened to Robert Sean Leonard that took him off the show, I think the writers may have panicked to find a way to replace him and get someone who has a better dynamic with Greg/Hugh.\n\nNiles Crane was also arguably the most important presence on Frasier (besides the titular character) and David totally embodied the role he was in perfectly. \n\nWho are the best supporting characters that most stand out to you?",

I live in India so I don't see any of this show at Sunday night I watch it at Monday morning and today I woke up early (although just half hour early) to watch the Last of Us on Disney+ (we don't have HBO Max so some HBO show get release in Disney+) And I did same for HOD and Succession. It also help us to put down all the detail of one episode in our mind and think about it. There is a reason that many youtuber just talked about GoT every week and no talking of fan theory for the Stranger Thing don't come even close even though it is just biggest show of Netflix.\n\nAnd think of how many shows you have just put down because you wouldn't be able to finish on first week of release and than people bashing it online with low review. now do you want to spend 8 to 10 hour if show is 50 or 60% rated. I didn't liked Amazon Lotr but I completed it because it's just one hour a week instead of whole day.\n\nFor Netflix  - \n\nThere are many streaming service who release whole series on day one but Netflix is special case because they cancel the show if it doesn't blow up in a month of the first streaming.\n\nRecent show they cancelled is 1899. This was released with Wednesday which was bound to blow up because of existing IP and Tim Burton and that show deserve to blow up. But 1899 is another Dark form the people who created Dark and I am sure after a year this show would be counted as one of the good show released in previous year. Many people wanted to watch what happens next but we can't because this slow burning show can't blow up in first month. And cancelling show because of that reason is bad.\n\nBut if they would have released the show one episode a week then story would have been different because people would have been taking about it more and more and in 2 moth would have garnered more review because of that and since show was good than positive review.",

Even if the rights in the North America remained with Fox, seeing how Disney bought them out as well, Disney should own the entire library of non-Disney properties from the 90s/early 00s.\n\nHowever, it appears the entire library of shows is now dead media, as Disney not only doesn't release the stuff on DVD, or even streaming, but they simply don't even acknowledge their existence.\n\nHow come? I thought Disney of all companies would be interested in making a few extra bucks, especially since these days you don't need to do costly home media printing. What could be preventing their release? If Disney keeps them in a dungeon somewhere long enough, is there a chance the copyrights to those shows elapse and they become public domain?",

The show is well written, has good actors, has good camerawork, but the plot meanders for the first half of every season. You are only watching to see the pieces for when things get interesting later on, but by that time you are already kind of tired.\n\nI would say as far as early 2000s shows go The Sopranos for the most part seems to blow by The Wire by a country mile.",

        "text": "(My phone keyboard is not working well , sorry for the typos :( )\n\nI just finished my two-day binge watching session of Severance. II‚Äôve heard about this show a lot recently, so i decided to check it out. To be honest until then, i never took interest in Apple tv content. For some reason their content never stood out at me at all. But i decided to watch it because the topic seemed interesting, also Adam Scott, so maybe worth checking out the free episode. \n\nI kinda knew the general concept of severance beforehand(from one of those horrid youtube shorts), but never so much in detail. But I just thought it was gonna be a mediocre sci fi office type of serious drama just dealing with one dimensional philosophical dilemma of ‚Äúseverence‚Äù.What i didnt expect, was a ‚≠êÔ∏è‚ú®masterpieceüí´üëë. I won‚Äôt get in to detail because you‚Äôre just gonna have a blast going in blind. \n\nI just want to rant a bit because I just finished the series. I went through some shit watching that last episode. and I was furious for about 3 minutes that this series left me hanging like that. That episode, was one of the best TV series finales ever. \n\ni‚Äôm just gonna write the good things down as a list: \n\n1. Ben stiller directed it. (Co-directed, I think) What. I knew he directs, ive seen his work- but I didnt know he slaps shit like this in the most unexpected ways. b\n\n2. Cinematography\nSubtile lighting looked greaat, it really sets the tone right. üëåüëåüëå\n\n3 the PERFORMANCE. \nSimply phenomenal from every. Single. Cast. How is that even possible, I dont know. What a blessing of a cast. \n\n4. Music. Is weird, and fitting. \nIt has some very interesting choices in tone with some scenes. and I think the overall direction was bit experimental, which I think it was executed perfectly. Deserved the emmy!!\n\n5. Opening sequence\nthis one- is trippy good. But it shouldn‚Äôt have been the only thing to be awarded with the music. \n\nI honestly can go ooon and ooooon about this show right now. But I‚Äôll stop here. I hope people who haven‚Äôt seen severance try to give it a shot. It was worth paying the monthly fee just for that 9 episodes. Truly amazing show.\n\nHope I didn‚Äôt spoil much.",

        "text": "I don't even like Willow more than Rings of Power, but a takeaway I had is that it feels like a completely different genre than GOT/ROP/etc. in doing this separate light adventure thing. Rings of Power may have had some differences than Game of Thrones but ultimately Amazon's main goal was to make another GOT type hit and the influence creeped in. Not just battle scenes but even things like monologues or characters talking to each other were unavoidably influenced by GOT. And Tolkein and George RR just don't go together that well. George RR being the opposite of Tolkein was the point.",
