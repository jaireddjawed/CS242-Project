The only reason anyone lets me near their tech is because everyone else in the family is worse with it. Unfortunately, I tend to forget that my family is as bad with tech as they truly are.\n\nOn to the story.  Mom (M) calls me on the phone because there is a problem with the TV.\n\n&gt;M: The menu isn't coming up and we can't change the channel and there's no sound. \n\nI've had three or four conversations with her that begin with this sort of opening and, since I lived with my dad at the time and didn't own a car to get to her, over the phone was the only way anything was getting done.\n\n&gt;Me: Did you turn it off and back on again?\n\n&gt;M: It doesn't turn off.\n\n&gt;Me: Okay, maybe we can try a reset.\n\nAt the time, my mom had Uverse and I know exactly three things about troubleshooting Uverse.  Turn it off and back on, yank out plug once and yank out plug three times.\n\nI start explaining which plug she needs to pull in the cable box (no HD so there are rca cables, the power supply and a coax).  While she's presumably staring at the back of the box in perplexed horror she muttered:\n\n&gt;M: This would be a lot easier if there was an off-button on this thing.\n\nStop the presses!\n\n&gt;Me: ...There is an off button.  On the front.  That glowing oval thing.\n\n&gt;M: Oh, I thought that was just a light.\n\nFacepalming so hard because now I can guess what's wrong.\n\n&gt;Me: Mom, step away from the box.\n\n&gt;M: Okay.\n\n&gt;Me: Go get the remote and press the power button.\n\n&gt;M: Uh huh.\n\n&gt;Me: Which one of the buttons at the top lights up?\n\n&gt;M: None of them.\n\n&gt;Me: Press the one on the far left.  Does it light up?\n\n&gt;M: No.\n\nDeep deep deeeeeeep breath.\n\n&gt;Me: Well, you're gonna need a couple of AA batteries... ",

        "text": "Hi. LTL. FTP. \nEnglish is not my primary language so forgive me for any big mistake.\n\nI'm enjoying TFTS stories for a while, so I think why not share mine. This one is a short one that occurs yesterday. \n\nFor a bit of context, I'm currently working as a Linux/Unix system engineer/devops/wathever in a medium sized company that does hosting for customers. \n\nSometimes we manage everything for them, sometimes nothing, sometimes a little bit of it.\n\nMy team is responsible for the OS part mainly. \n\nAmong all the technologies we provides, we have the luck to manage zvm linuxes. \n\nFor the happy people that don't know what it is, it's a virtual machine running inside a $BigBlue $zsystem.\n\nIt's a real pain in the arse, because when it's running, you can manage it through ssh like a regular Linux, but if the system is down, you need to manage the vm from a mainframe console. \n\nSo here we go.\n$me will be ... me\n$cw will be one of my coworker.\n\nIt's monday morning and I'm the first arriving in the office. The reason is because I'm the one that is designated for this morning operational duties. \n\nThe way it works here, is that everybody takes this role with a pre-defined schedule. \n\nSo I'm arriving this bright morning and start the routine. \nFirst thing to do is to check the monitoring console and sort out alerts. \n\nMost critical systems are monitored 24/7 and we have a night duty that handle them (we also all take this role). For the rest, it's up to the daily operation duty. \n\nYou allways have more alarms on a Monday morning, because of the week-end where only major issues are managed. \n\nBut this time, a lot was there. \nPart of them was due to a Disaster Recovery Test that happened during the week-end. Seems the teams forgot to put hosts in maintenance mode in $bigbluemonitoring. \n\nNot too bad, this happens all the time. \n\nAfter cleaning the false positive, among other problem we have $vm1 that is not responding. \nGenerally not a good sign. \n\nFirst thing first, a little ping from my workstation (sometimes it's the $monitoring system that just go wild). \nNo response.\nCrap.\n\nI open the $passwordmanagerapp and fetch the information for this vm. \n\nNow fire up$terminalapp. \nThis application let us connect to the mainframe and run operations to start the machine for example. \n\nThis is where the fun begins. \n\n`Username: VMNAME`\n`Password: Passw0rd`\n`&lt;Enter&gt;`\n\nThis is enough to power up $vm. \nI see the lines coming up with your usual boot sequence. \n\n`&lt;alt&gt;-c `\n\nSo yes, the screen doesn't scroll automatically, you need to hit a key combination to scroll. \nIf you don't do it, the OS just hangs until you scroll to the end. \n\n`$vm login: `\n\nOk vm has started great no big deal. \nClose the $terminalapp. \n\nCrap.... \n\nSo yes, another caveat of this thing : if you just close the $terminalapp, the vm crash.\n\nHere we go again, rince and repeat (login, password ....).\n\nBut this time $vm doesn't start automatically. \nThis happens, you have to enter a command in the terminal. \n\n`  i 100 `\n\nOk now $vm start. Again, scrolling manually, blah blah blah ... \n\n$vm is up again.\n\nThis time, don't screw it up $me, just disconnect cleanly.\nBut how do you do that you will be asking $me ? \nEasy peasy, just type #cp disc in the terminal. \n\nWith the pound sign. \nAttached to the cp or it won't work. That's the way $BigBlue can detect that you launch a command to the hypervisor, not the vm from which you are on the console.\n\nJust do it. \n\nExcept .... \n\nI type #cp disc on the terminal.\nAnd what is displayed ? \n\n` csid pc# `\n\nYes everything is reverted.\n\nWTF ????\n\nI try anyway to hit enter but it's not working. \nThat's when $cw have the brilliant idea : \n\n&gt; $cw : just try typing it backward.\n\nAnd yes it did the trick. \nI type csid pc# on my keyboard, #cp disc does appear on the console and I can logoff cleanly. \n\nAnd it was just the beginning of a long day....\n\n\n**edit** : formating + correction of gross :)\n",

(edit a added line)\n\nI run a micro business, I mainly do graphic design, marketing concepts and layout editing but because of my love for PC gaming and knowing my way around a good troubleshoot, I naturally offer rudimentary tech support to some of my clients. While technically not a tech issue, it was definitely a user issue...\n\n...I recently acquired a new graphic design client (lets call them $booshdoof) and all was going well until the delivery of my clients proofs.\n\n&gt;$booshdoof: \"Hey $drebin, these look wonderful, but are you able to take a look at these? See this part here? It looks so pixelated.\"\n\nI think to myself, 'OK...that seems odd maybe something happened to the vectors when I saved them in Illustrator.' I go about opening the files, zooming in until \"I cants zooms no more!\" (Popeye the graphic designin' man toot toot). \n\nNope, as smooth as the moment I clicked save. I naturally email my client back.\n\n&gt;$drebin: (uh nuh-uh) \"These seem fine on my end, are you opening the .AI files in Illustrator?\"\n\n&gt;$booshdoof: \"Yes, yes, you told me to, I am, I am! See, this is all pixelated.\"\n\n$booshdoof then sends me a screenshot (taken by phone), it is indeed pixelated, and my internal monologue begins my self doubt as an artist. Was it my tools failing me? Was it me?\n\nI begin redesigning each part of the design that was shown to be pixelated, every line, every vector is beautiful, clean and crisp. Both test prints and on screen, everything looks flawless...so I email back...\n\n&gt;$drebin: \"I have redesigned every one of these, gone over every millimetre with a fine toothed comb, made at least 15 test prints at the office and using the print services of a large stationary store. They ARE flawless and are ready to go.\"\n\n&gt;$booshdoof: (takes the time to download, and reply) \"Nope they are just so pixelated, here...see for your self.\" (and sends me a video of the screen while zooming in)\n\nI open and watch the video with that feeling of contempt one gets while one humours a client....when I see a familiar wording at the top of the screen.....PHOTOSHOP....AH-HAAH! GOTCHA!\n\nI email back:\n\n&gt;\"You aren't using Illustrator to open these are you? See what happens when I open these on Illustrator?\" (send my own video, opening in Illustrator, everything looks smoother than the smoothest anti-aliasing)\n\n$booshdoof replies:\n\n&gt;\"Sorry, I don't have Illustrator, isn't that the same as Photoshop?\" \n\n*sigh*",

Windows updates, which were scheduled in and they were advised of a possible reboot and to save all work before leaving. $DC was blaming us for the entire thing. \n\nTL;DR - Windows updates were booked in, user didn't save file, PC rebooted and user blames us for it going missing",

We're a bit puzzled by this, as this is a device we've used in a lot of projects and save the manufacturing defect in one, they've been very reliable in harsh conditions.\n\nI get sent out to investigate. I'm first met with the small company CEO himself, who gives me an earful and then tells me to go meet with one of his drivers, who reported the issue.\n\nI'm greeted by this mountain of a man. A stereotype of a guy who's lifting and carrying heavy items for a living. He says our system is broken and I follow him into his truck. While we walk, I question him about the issue. I learn that this one didn't start showing any signs of trouble on its own, but instead when the guy wiggles it. I ask him to demonstrate. The guy grabs the connector and forcefully bends it into 45 degree angle. I can hear the device's plastic case cracking and the screen goes blank as the female connector separates from the display's motherboard.\n\nI just stand there in complete silence and in total disbelief of what I just saw.\n\n'See, it's broken!' says the guy cheerfully.\n\nI report back to my boss.

        "text": "Greetings, TFTS! It's been a while since I've posted. but I've got a few small tales from recent $MSP escapades that I thought you guys might like. \n\nFor background - I work for a company that mainly provides cloud hosting services, ranging from Azure VMs and Office 365, to Citrix Environments and custom-built domains. Every day is a mixed bag when it comes to work responsibilities.\n\n$MSP is owned by $MegaCorp, which also owns various other sister companies, whose products we provide in our hosted environments ($ERP, $OtherERP, $CRM, etc).\n\nHead Office, for some reason, had grown tired of the notion that these businesses were separate companies in the eyes of their customers. Despite every company being happy with this arrangement - as it allowed for a clear definition of support scopes - management, in their intransigence, launched $OperationUnity, a bid to unite the companies under Head Office's banner.\n\nAs part of $OperationUnity, $MSP has become the first point of contact for all internal IT tickets, for all aspects of the business.\n\nThis has led to some... *interesting* issues and tickets, the best of which I will be sharing here.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n---\n\n**The Case of the Missing Email**\n\n*Ding!*\n\n**Ticket #xxxxx1**\n\n**From:** \n\n$ProjectManager\n\n**Subject:** \n\nWhere is my email?\n\n**Body:**\n\n Where is my email from 2017 please?\n\nI respond, asking for more information. Is it a specific email he is missing? All of them? Can he see them through the Webmail client?\n\n**Response:**\n\nA reboot overnight seems to have fixed it?! I had a similar experience with $TotallyUnrelatedApplication.\n\n---\n\n**Resolution:** Issue resolved, ticket closed. Still don't know what the hell he was talking about.\n\n---\n\n**Operation: Maximise**\n\nPicture the scene - it's 2am, I'm on a lovely, quiet night shift, where I essentially get paid to watch Netflix and eat junk food for thirteen hours, all while working from home.\n\nNaturally, I'm quite peeved when the phone rings.\n\n*Ring!*\n\n&gt;**Me:** Good evening $MSP, Ozy speaking, how can I help?\n\n&gt;**$DrunknSweary:** Is there a problem with Citrix? We're not in any downtime now, are we?\n\n*Note: $DrunknSweary is named for his penchant for calling night shift up while absolutely blind drunk, ranting about $OtherERP and their software, swearing profusely as he does so. So long as you stay on his good side, he's a pretty good laugh.*\n\nI recognise him by voice, test launching a Citrix Desktop, which connects with ease.\n\n&gt;**Me:** Nope, no issues with your Citrix environment. What's the issue you're experiencing?\n\n&gt;**$DrunknSweary:** Whenever I launch this f*cking thing it just gives me a grey page.\n\n&gt;**Me:** Okay, that sounds like a disconnected session; I've logged your session off, can you try logging in again?\n\n&gt;**$DrunknSweary:** Okay, let me try... Nope, still getting a grey screen.\n\n&gt;**Me:** Well -\n\n&gt;**DrunknSweary:** I've had nothing but problems with this bloody Citrix Receiver thing - I was getting f*cking \"fatal errors\" earlier, so I uninstalled it and installed the newest version, and now I can't even get into my desktop...\n\nA thought strikes me.\n\n&gt;**Me:** $DrunknSweary, this is gonna sound weird, but could you resize the window for me? Maximise it, make it smaller, doesn't matter.\n\nTo his credit, he didn't argue with me, even though it's a very weird request.\n\n&gt;**$DrunknSweary:** ... Well I'll be damned. That's f*cking weird. Everything's just appeared!\n\n&gt;**Me:** Yeah, I just got a new machine and had the same issue. It's a weird bug in the new Citrix Receiver. Any desktop you launch shows a grey screen, and you have to resize the screen in some capacity to get it to work. To be honest I thought I was going insane, I'm glad it's not just me experiencing it!\n\n---\n\n**Resolution:** For once, enhancing the image *wasn't* just technobabble. Issue resolved, ticket closed.\n\n---\n\n**The Meeting Has Overrun**\n\nThis one was just plain weird, but thankfully simple to resolve. I take a phone call from $ERPTech, based in Europe.\n\n&gt;**$ERPTech:** Hi, yes, I am calling regarding ticket #xxxxx2; I was speaking to $MSPTech earlier, and I was wondering if we could get that changed ASAP?\n\n&gt;**Me:** *pulling up the ticket, not sure what she's talking about* Get what changed, sorry?\n\n&gt;**$ERPTech:** The time limit on the meetings, of course! That's just way too short, some of our meetings are a couple of hours long!\n\nAt this point I'm wondering what the hell she's talking about. I check the ticket, which has finally loaded in our piece of shit ticketing system; see it's about booking meetings against an Exchange Calendar, for a room mailbox. Okay, that makes a bit more sense.\n\n&gt;**Me:** Okay, I can speak with our Exchange team about getting the time booking limits changed, what kind of period are we looking for?\n\n&gt;**$ERPTech:** I don't know, but I know that less than half an hour is much too quick for our meetings!\n\n*wat.jpg*\n\n&gt;**Me:** I'm sorry, what?\n\n&gt;**$ERPTech:** That's what your colleague said!\n\nI check the notes; sure enough, there it is in black and white, a note from my colleague:\n\n&gt;*Hi $ERPTech,*\n&gt;\n&gt;*After investigation, I can confirm that the current meeting time limits are set to 24 minutes.*\n\n&gt;*Kind regards,*\n\n&gt;*$NotOzy*\n\nI stare in awe at that note. Literally speechless. Then, after a moment:\n\n&gt;**Me:** Yeeeeeah I don't know where he got that from, the standard time limit for meetings is 24 hours, to allow for full day bookings of conference rooms.\n\n&gt;**$ERPTech:** Yeah, I did think that was a bit weird. 24 hours is fine, thank you.\n\n---\n\n**Resolution:** Coworker is a moron. Issue resolved, ticket closed.\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n",

And off she runs before I can say a word. \n\nPicking up my handset I head to the conference room and watch as she turns on the computer it’s up and she rests her hands to begin typing and like a baby the laptop is asleep again...\n\nI turn on her computer and try myself no issues...\n\nThis is when I notice the large bracelet on her wrist. After telling her in hushed whispers to remove her jewelry and getting head turning looks from management and $ales lady she obliges and voila it works!\n\nI leave the room with no explanation to avoid further distraction. \n\nOh and meanwhile bitten fruit tech support can’t find the issue and case manager is off the next few days so he’ll follow up on it when he gets back...lovely\n",

        "text": "It has been less than two hours since this debacle resolved itself, and I feel I need to record this for posterity.  It truly is an epic tale.\n\nAbout two weeks ago, it began.  I walked into our little control center where I am primarily a Security Officer, but my job description includes tech support to the department for a minor pittance.  You see, my boss got wind of my ability to build PC's like many of my generation.  So, that qualified me for a whole host of duties in my boss's mind.  Now I am, on occasion, expected to perform feats of network engineering that boggles the minds of our actual network engineers.  This is not one of those stories.  Basically, I am a security officer, paid less than a desktop support technician, to occasionally give direct support to the department that sometimes network engineers won't touch (i.e. our IP camera network).\n\nSo, I walked into our control center and I was told that the Duty PC was going to sleep, but unable to wake.  Interesting.  I look at it, do the dance with the mouse, the keyboard, they don't respond.  I push the power button and we are back in business.  However, there was a slight graphical error on wake.  A whole bunch of vertical and horizontal lines flickered, but then they were gone.  I didn't put too much significance to it, but thought I should investigate more.\n\nI looked into the settings for the PC to wake from sleep from keyboard and mouse input.  I hit an admin wall.  It seems I am not qualified to tell the PC to wake from mouse or keyboard input (I was previously denied admin rights by the head of IT).  I put in an ticket.\n\nIn about an hour, I get a reply from my buddies in IT.  They try to troubleshoot the issue remotely, but can't find the issue and are as perplexed as me.  We let it go as unknown/workaround and close the ticket.  The workaround, \"just have your guys wake the PC with the power button.  You said that works.\"  The PC is still operational, after all.\n\n\"Sure, no problem.\"  I say.  I go on to the problem of the monitor flickering and having trouble turning on after sleep.  I look at the video output and find it hooked up to the VGA output.  Thinking there might be an issue there, I swap out the VGA cord with an DVI from my own stash (what's a budget).  I set the monitor to not search for input, but to just use DVI. Then I send out an email to all my wonderful users who listen every time, that if they need to wake the PC, just push the power button briefly once, and if the monitor doesn't come up, just push power on the button.  I tested it and had no issues on wake up.\n\nSo, I hear nothing.  No emails, no complaints, until I come into work a week later.  Then I am told by the Assistant Supervisor that the PC is still doing it and my \"incompetence\" is costing operations time.  \"Well, that's funny,\" I say.  \"I haven't been informed that the problem was still ongoing.  I will look into it.\"  Interestingly the boss had left for vacation that day.\n\n\"We already did. We got Jason (fake name) on it.  He says it's a video card and needs to be replaced right away because it could die at any moment.  He's going to swap it with the new PC in the boss' office tomorrow for us.\"  \n\n\"I'm not sure it's the video card, I think it might be the monitor.  I want to do more investigating (when I am not doing security stuff, or messing with cameras, or the million other duties I have).  The PC is still working, after all.\"  I say.\n\n\"Jason says it's the video card, and we don't have the time to screw around.  Do you know more than Jason?\"  You get the idea where this is going.  I just say that I will bow to Jason's superior awesomeness.  I am pretty sure the assistant supervisor is trying to make me look un-needed.\n\n\"Now, who is this Jason?\" you, dear reader, might be asking.  He is no other than the best IT guy in the place.  He is super nice and will take time out of any project just to help us out.  Being the best, he is the phone network specialist.  The phone network specialist is currently two weeks behind on a major site-wide phone install because, surprise, he is understaffed and not allocated enough time to do the job.  He is currently building a new sub-net for our cameras.\n\nI take this up with my supervisor.  \"We can't let Jason do this when we are capable.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asks my supervisor.\n\n\"Well, he is the phone network specialist, we can't be asking him to do the job of a level 1 desktop support technician just because he always cuts through the red tape for us.  He is on a major project, high into over time, and killing himself from the stress.  This is my job.  I can plug a darn computer in.\"  Surprisingly, the supervisor agrees.\n\nI also went on to explain that we can't replace the PC right away.  It's not dead yet.  (Monty Python anyone?).  We need to get everyone, regardless of ability, to somehow save their passwords, bookmarks, etc.  Most of our apps are web based, and the savvy of us helps the less savvy by saving passwords in the browser.  They need a way to recover them.  \n\nI then spend the next day writing the simplest tutorial I can muster on how to use Google Sync and Google Drive and let everyone know the date of the change-over.  Remember, the boss isn't back yet.  My supervisor says he wants to proofread my work before it gets sent out.  He then sends it out from his account. \n\nWell, this spawned a huge email fight between me and the assistant supervisor in which I was accused of being unable to perform my duties and costing operations.  It was an obvious power grab, in my opinion.  I tried to be professional in my response, but fell victim to taking the low road a bit, as I felt my ass was on the line.  We both got lectured by the Supervisor for that one.\n\nThe weekend comes and goes, the boss is busy playing catch-up all Monday while I am busy writing parking tickets all day.  Monday, I get a \"Sorry not sorry\" email from the assistant supervisor that I am pretty sure he was forced to write by the Boss because he copied the boss.  Today, Tuesday, my supervisor says \"now would be a good time to take care of that PC.\"\n\nI go and talk to the boss.  He loves my tutorials and I get lots of respect for it.  (I seriously love my boss, he acts like a real human, respects me, and I do pretty much anything he asks because of it).  I then explain everything about why we need to replace the PC. The Boss is not liking losing equipment.  I tell him I can probably repair it with a new video card someday (HD 7570 is cheap and swapping video cards is what supposedly made me qualified for this position).  I take the only new PC we have out of spares and install it.\n\nIt boots.  I see the graphical error.  I want to tear my hair out.  It's the damn monitor and not the PC.  I go back to my boss and have to explain the reason everything I just told him was wrong.  There is a problem, though.  We don't have a 1080p monitor in spares, just old 720p ones.  We do so much multitasking on that PC we need the extra pixels. \n\nI finally negotiate taking a monitor from another station that doesn't really have room for the big 24 inch monitor.  I swap it with a 17\" 720p monitor from spares.  That works out well.  \n\nI get it set up, return all the other equipment, but I know I have one last job to take care of.  It still won't wake on keyboard/mouse input.  This will be my coupe de gras.  \n\nI get my IT buddies on the phone.  \"You guys busy?\"\n\n\"Yeah, can whatever you have wait?\"\n\n\"Sure, but I want to get this done by the end of the day.\"\n\n\"Put in a ticket and one of us will be down when we can.\"\n\nSo, my buddy arrives and I explain to him that even though I have written a tutorial on how to push a button to to wake the PC, its too complicated for my users.  We laugh and he understands.  I would rather just fix the problem.\n\nSo, we go into the hardware settings.  The options are still missing.  We check the drivers, their fine.  We re-download the drivers, no change, etc.  Finally (lets call him Dude) Dude, decides to check the bios.  Deep inside there are settings under USB devices.  \"Wake PC on USB device input.\"  It's unchecked.  He checks it.  We hold our breath.  We boot.  We make it sleep.  He hits the space bar.  It wakes up!  Success!\n\nNow, this is rather peculiar to us.  He runs it up the ladder.  IT boss says to run a malware check and send her the report. She suspects Malware might have somehow changed the BIOS settings.  I don't know how it is in other departments, but any time Malware is found on our PC's heads roll.  I can't wait.  (note, I don't have the access to install Malware Bytes, But Dude does).  \n\nThe scan takes forever, I am literally down to five minutes left.  It's done!  I copy the report, send it off, and click quarantine.  I look over the report.  Just as if it were Christmas, every username on the report is a person who I know to be an inept and careless user.  You know, the ones who don't know how to push a power button to turn on a PC from sleep.\n\nEdit: who confused the name DVI with IDE?  This guy!  ",

Get it home and see what i can do, he was trying to install Windows 7 but kept having issues with it crashing and BSODing on install.\n\nFirst thing I did before i did a wipe and install was try to upgrade RAM as it was an old P4 with 1GB of DDR1.\n\nInstalled all 4gb of ram, ran the install and then the computer turned off all by itself while left alone. Trying to power on and I get a black screen although the power is running. Sounds like MOBO\n\nWelp decided to upgrade him. Installed an AMD Athlon II AM2 board, with 6GB of DDR2, had PCI-E instead of AGP, so a bit of an upgrade. Went to power on, and nothing. \n\nSo maybe bad powersupply, replaced that with a spare, still wont boot. So I strip it down to nothing but the front header connectors plugged in, still no power, Im pissed. This was a working board not more then a few months ago.\n\nSo I disconnect everything and let it sit, ask around for thoughts, Go to try it one more time and it turns on, What??? checked and i noticed the USB header was disconnected, reconnected it and it wont turn on again,\n\nChecked front of computer and wouldn't you know, the USB port was smashed and the pins where shorted. Welp theres your problem\n\nGot it together sans front USB and everything worked fine. Goes to show that even though you think an issue is some major failure, it might just be something simple and un-needed\n\nTL:DR USB orientation was not observed, port was broken, Tried replacing a lot of hardware before realizing it was a bad port",

        "text": "[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8elffw/the_web_developers_who_didnt_know_how_to_google/) reminded me of a similar, but much older, situation I was in.  This was probably early-to-mid 2000s, and I was consulting for a Big Company.  They had just spent $$$$many on a new internal intranet system with a different Big Company whose nickname was related to a large color.  But they were having problems of some sort.  So they called me in. \n\nAfter some cajoling and prompting, I finally got the details of the problem they were having out of them.  The users would log in, and start doing stuff, but often they would have to log back in in the middle of their work, which would have all disappeared.  After some more cajoling and prompting, I got out of them the fact that they had two back-end servers fronted by a load balancer.  \n\nI think most of you already know where this is going.\n\nI then had a conversation that went something like this:\n\n**Me:** (to the developers who were present) Does the app share sessions between different servers?      \n**Devs:** We enabled clustering.    \n**Me:** Ok, but what does that mean?      \n**Devs:** We enabled clustering.     \n**Me:** How, exactly, did you enable clustering?      \n**Devs:** We checked the checkbox in (web developer tool).     \n**Me:** Ok, I'm not very familiar with (tool), so can you explain what *exactly* that does?     \n**Devs:** It enables clustering.     \n**Me:** *headdesk*\n\nLong and short of it is that their load balancer wasn't using sticky sessions (which they didn't think they needed to use for reasons insufficiently explained), allowing different requests from the same user to go to different servers.  Those servers themselves had no idea they were in a cluster configuration, which caused sessions to \"disappear\" when a user got sent to a different one by the load balancer, and required the user to log in again.  All this because the developers only knew about checking a checkbox on their developer tool.\n\n**edit:** apparently the post I was referring to got deleted.  It was titled \"The Web Developers who didn't know how to google,\" hence my cribbing of a good title.",

Becuase a customer wanted access to their ASA.  This, is something I don't do often.  I had to tell him no.  \n\nFirst, system wide changes to accommodate a single special case, I don't do those as a rule.  Making major rule and configuration changes on our authentication system during the day, risking kicking everyone out of the authentication system.  And for a customer with a limited lifetime with the company.  It also would expose the TACACS server configuration to the customer.   Getting the configuration to work on \"just that one firewall\" would require restructuring the whole TACACS database.  And the alternative, would be allowing the customer access to every piece of that brand equipment on our network.  This... is a bad idea.  \n\nWhen the alternative, is just setting up two local users, documenting it, and pulling tacacs from the configuration on the end device.  That's what I had him do in the end.  \n\n... I hate telling my coworkers no.  But this wasn't something I was going to do without my boss screaming at me.  ",

        "text": "*Disclaimer*\nThis post may be a bit more rant than usual due to the issue at hand, the fact this occurred no less than an hour ago, and a lack of proper sleep and proper coffee do not make for a fully pleasant attitude.\n\nThe scene is set. Monday approaches and the sun has yet to begin to shine. The underdog of this tale rises to greet the morning much like a rock trying to rise from the bottom of the ocean. After injecting of caffeine he makes his way to work where a small cubicle, a well used coffeepot, and a bright board of green and red are waiting to greet him and indicate how his day will be.\n\nUnfortunately, the board was upset at the weekend ending, and showed red.\n\nOur underdog 'hurries' to his desk and gets his systems up. quickly he takes calls one after another, hoping to stem the massive tide with his teaspoon of hope. It goes as well as expected but slowly he starts to get little hints. Sites not loading. Emails not showing up in a timely manner. Slow logins. And a current test of bandwidth going on causing many thousands of people to crowd a poor VPN server all at the same time. It strikes him.\n\nThe network is malfunctioning.\n\nHe tests with the calls, sending them to other sites and reloading pages until they work. 404's vanish for a while if but a short moment. Leading the stray flock of accounting sheep to other VPN stables provides more stability. More and more he builds the case, he has the proof. He finally reaches out, waving a flag and crying out in triumph and hope. \n\n\"The network is not working, there is an issue to be fixed\"\n\nHe his told with a voice, indifferent and ignoring \"No, I don't see an issue. There's no issue\"\n\nHe tries to keep raising warning, and is ignored time and again. The underdog sits back in his cube, all he can do is warn his colleagues and try to keep things strung together. Bitter and tired he ends the day. \n\nHe comes in the next day, and again the board shines red. Our underdog drinks of coffee to keep together, working the calls once more stringing people together and keeping them fixed as issues pour in. Emails keep coming. Application not working. Site not showing. 404's and access denied everywhere you see. Almost in weird sadness, 24 hours later a voice cries out from the 'Incident' team\n\n\"The network is malfunctioning, the system is down\"\n\nOur underdog feels naught but sadness and anger. Ignored by all as he sits in his cube, warning of the issue and being ignored only to have his warning vindicated a day later, but no acknowledgement. A reminder of his sad place at the bottom of the tech totem pole. In his mirth, he remembers a scene from True Lies.\n\n\"This bridge is out! The bridge is out!\"\n\n\"What. what are you saying... Oh! The Bridge is out! Harry, the Bridge is out!\"\n\ntl;dr: Call center tech warns of outage, watches as it burns and keeps trying to keep bodies alive\n\nAdditional: After our Incident team finally stated there was an outage, it took another 24 hours before a company email went out to advise everyone that the network was having issues, It was only then that we could start getting our fires down, until other systems began breaking. Just thought I'd follow up on that note if anyone was morbidly curious",

        "text": "Last time on Database Support: [Fake it 'til you make it](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/72bax8/database_support_11_the_blind_leading_the_blind/)\n\n---\n\nHey folks, it's been a while.  Partly because of the usual busyness and/or laziness, but mostly because while the \"coming up next\" portion of my last post mentioned a tale involving meeting a bunch of customers, after several attempts to write it up I realized that there was just too much sensitive customer information involved in the humorous and exasperating parts, and redacting all of that would leave me with basically no story.\n\nSo instead we'll skip ahead a bit to explore another wonderful period in my team's history.  Buckle up, it could get a bit dizzy in here.\n\n---\n\nAs I mentioned in my previous tale, my team was the catch-all team for our department.  We \"only\" dealt with the utilities surrounding the database, not the more complex internals, so when something had to be done that didn't fit in the other teams' buckets we were the ones given the dubious honor of dealing with it.  This also meant that our team was viewed as being the one with the shortest ramp-up time and least overhead to deal with; this wasn't exactly true, as we were responsible for over two dozen utilities written in three or four different languages, all 10+ years old and with enough legacy baggage to fill a 747's cargo hold, but that was the perception.\n\nThose two things together meant that we were the designated \"new hire training\" team: If someone was hired into or rotated through our department, they'd almost always be assigned to our team, get trained up for a while, and then rotated out to another team just as they were starting to really contribute, at which point someone else new would join the team and start the process over.  And if other teams needed a more experienced person to join them for a while, management was happy to grab someone from our team--after all, we were _merely_ the utilities team, surely our job was easy and we didn't need _everyone_ on the team, right?\n\nWhile we'd had a long streak of annoying rotations, this really came to a head in one particular month about two years back.  A certain manager, NewVP, was put in charge of allocations for our team and was the one who kept us apprised of any hires and rotations.  However, as he was (at the time, at least) the only person of his rank who hadn't been promoted from within the department, he was still learning the ropes and wasn't great at keeping on top of schedules.\n\nIt was always a miracle if we got 24 hours' notice of a new hire or 3 hours' notice of an interview from him, and for the past few months we'd been ambushed by interviews, surprised by rotations, and otherwise jerked around over and over again.  We'd finished training a few new hires recently and had been promised we wouldn't be getting any more any time soon.\n\nSo naturally, I got an email _on a Sunday afternoon_ about an upcoming rotation.  Verbatim:\n\n&gt; **NewVP:**  \n&gt; Good news! Help is arriving!\n&gt; \n&gt; Larry and Moe will be joining the team for several weeks on Monday.\n&gt; \n&gt; (Yes, tomorrow. Sorry for the short notice. We actually did know earlier but it's been a crazy couple of weeks and I dropped the ball on communicating. Please forgive me.)\n\nLarry and Moe (fake names of course chosen entirely at random with no intended subtext whatsoever) were from a different department with whom we had, shall we say, noticeable ideological friction, as briefly mentioned in [a previous musical number](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/6t33so/database_support_5_the_day_the_qa_died).  Here's how rotations with this particular department usually went:\n\n*Week 1*\n&gt; **Rotator:** That's terrible.  You're doing everything wrong.  There's no reason anyone would want to do X like that.\n\n*Week 2*\n&gt; **Rotator:** Everything sucks.  We should rewrite A, B, and C from scratch in accordance with proper Agile practices.\n\n*Week 3*\n&gt; **Rotator:** Yes, I know it's all legacy code, but if you were doing Y, you wouldn't have this problem.\n\n*Week 4*\n&gt; **Rotator:** Huh, that's a _lot_ of legacy code.  I _guess_ I can see why you're doing Z, even if W would make more sense.\n\n*Week 5*\n&gt; **Rotator:** Yeah, I see what you mean about utility D and script E.  I'm impressed you managed to make this stuff work at all!\n\n*Week 6*\n&gt; **Rotator:** I take back what I said initially, you guys definitely have some pretty valid reasons for doing things the way you're doing.  I'll make sure to give that feedback to management, and give other folks from [other department] a heads up if they're going to rotate in with you.\n\n...\n\n*Week 1 Again*\n&gt; **New Rotator:** That's terrible.  You're doing everything wrong.  There's no reason anyone would want to do X like that.\n\nAnd so forth.  So when I found out we'd be getting not one but _two_ temporary team members from that department on very short notice, I was of course positively ecstatic.\n\nOn their first day, I sat them both down and gave them a basic overview of our main utilities, our current priorities, and our work already in flight.  They nodded politely through the whole thing and immediately made a few suggestions for \"improvements\" we could make.  I suggested we wait to discuss that until they'd actually seen the code and gotten a more in-depth introduction from the other team members who would be pairing with them.  They agreed, but were obviously itching to change as much as they could as soon as they could.\n\nLarry and Moe's first week moved along at a crawl.  They weren't subtle about their criticism of everything from our testing style to our variable naming conventions; you'd have thought my team had chosen everything specifically to spite them, instead of having inherited it all from previous teams and being as frustrated at some thing as they were.\n\nAs soon as they saw our testing setup they latched on to one particular point: We were using integration tests for our backup and restore utility, not unit tests.  In their department, this was simply Not Done, and simply _had_ to be changed immediately, because actually hitting the database was slow and flaky and altogether terrible testing practice.\n\n(An aside for the non-coders: unit tests are tests for a small unit of code, like a single function, ensuring that it does the right thing on its own given various inputs and that the tests will break if the internal behavior of that unit changes; integration tests are tests at boundaries between two parts of code, like between a utility and the database that the utility accesses, ensuring that the two interoperate correctly and that the tests will break if either side changes its interface.)\n\nThe rest of the team made it clear that addressing this wasn't a priority, but we had several meetings about it that day and the next anyway.  I'll spare you the long and boring details, but suffice to say that the high point was when Larry suggested we simply mock out a copy of _the entire database_ from scratch for testing purposes.\n\nAs creating such a mock database with identical behavior to the real database without a good test mocking library available would be akin to making a 1-to-1 scale life-size map of the earth because anything smaller wouldn't be realistic enough, and even just tracking down every single query all the utilities ran and their expected outputs would have taken weeks on its own, this idea was politely rejected.\n\nMoe left the team that Thursday, citing his inability to get comfortable with Vim, the editor of choice for most of our team.  This _obviously_ had everything to do with Vim, despite him having been onboarding with the team's Vim expert--who was also one of the most patient and understanding team members and an excellent teacher--and nothing to do with the fact that he was upset over his suggestion being rejected.\n\nRight after Moe left, I received another email from NewVP:\n\n*ding!*\n\n&gt; **NewVP:**  \n&gt; Hi DB_Dev,\n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry for the late notice, but a new hire, NewGuy, will be joining your team Monday.  I know I promised to give you more notice for these things, but I just heard about it myself, sorry again.\n\n_Cool_, I thought, _we'll finish onboarding Larry and he can help onboard NewGuy since everything will be fresh and we'll have just updated our new hire docs, it'll work out nicely for once._\n\nLarry finished out his first week with the team, and it went surprisingly well; he was ahead of the curve, having breezed through both the \"everything is wrong\" and \"rewrite from scratch\" stages in the first couple days and started in on the \"I know better\" and \"maybe you have a point\" stages toward the end of the week after that database testing discussion.  Maybe by the end of NewGuy's first week he'd have hit the stage of Zen acceptance.\n\nThat Friday, yet another email:\n\n*ding!*\n\n&gt; **NewVP:**  \n&gt; Hi DB_Dev,\n&gt; \n&gt; Since Moe rotated off the team yesterday, we'll be moving in another developer, Curly, to replace him on Monday.\n\nPerfect!  We could get Larry, Curly, and NewGuy together for a week and get all the onboarding out of the way at once.  Amazing what coordinating schedules can do for a team.\n\nMonday rolled around.  NewGuy arrived bright and early, met the team, and started getting settled in.  Alas, no sign of Curly.\n\n*ding!*\n\n&gt; **NewVP:**  \n&gt; Hey DB_Dev,\n&gt; \n&gt; It turns out Curly won't be able to start today, he's still finishing things up with his previous team and will be starting in a couple weeks.  I'm very sorry, I know I've dropped the ball on this.  Going forward, I'll be sure to give you at least a week's notice for any future changes.\n\n_Sigh._  So much for onboarding two people at once instead of staggering things again.\n\nI went through an abbreviated version of the same spiel I gave Larry and Moe, and fortunately NewGuy _didn't_ think he knew our codebase and team practices better than we did after the first five minutes, so it went much more smoothly.  For his first few days, I was planning to pair him up with RightHand, a developer I'd worked with for quite a while (the second-most experienced person on the team after yours truly) and who effectively co-led the team with me when our manager went AWOL (but that's another story).  RightHand had actually been one of NewGuy's interviewers and they'd gotten along famously, and I figured it would be a perfect fit.\n\nSo, naturally....\n\n*ding!*\n\n&gt; **NewVP:**  \n&gt; Hi DB_Dev,\n&gt; \n&gt; Do you have time for a quick chat about allocations?  Let's grab a meeting room right after lunch.\n\nI walked into the meeting room, plopped down into a chair, and gave him my best \"Seriously, dude?\" look.\n\n&gt; **Me:** Okay, who's getting yanked off the team this time?\n\nI wasn't normally that flippant with any manager besides CoolBoss, but I was just a bit peeved about the constant changes and lack of forewarning.\n\n&gt; **NewVP:** Well, I wouldn't put it like _that_, exactly....  \n&gt; **Me:** All right, who's rotating away for an unspecified duration?  \n&gt; **NewVP:** RightHand.  \n&gt; **Me:** What.  \n&gt; **NewVP:** Now, I know he's one of the more experienced team members, but, you know, he'd actually been wanting to rotate to the query team for a while now.  \n&gt; **Me:** Huh.  Well, he didn't mention anything to me, but I guess if he really wants to--  \n&gt; **NewVP:** No, actually, the Storage team needed him more.  \n&gt; **Me:** I see.  How long is his rotation going to be?  Four to six weeks as usual?  \n&gt; **NewVP:** Well, um.  \n&gt; **NewVP:** I guess you could say that this was going to be less of a \"rotation\" and more of a \"permanent transfer\"....  \n&gt; **Me:** Fantastic.  So let me guess, he's leaving next Monday, so we need to give NewGuy every possible minute with him for knowledge transfer?  \n&gt; **NewVP:** Not...exactly.  He's actually switching tomorrow.  \n&gt; _Me Internally:_ [...](https://media.giphy.com/media/12XMGIWtrHBl5e/giphy.gif)  \n&gt; **Me:** No.\n\nYeah, I actually just flat-out said \"No.\"  Not my most brilliant or tactful move ever, but NewVP was caught off balance enough for it to work.\n\n&gt; **NewVP:** Uh...excuse me?  \n&gt; **Me:** No.  This is like the sixth time in the last month that plans have changed at the last minute with no warning, I've practically spent more time drawing diagrams and updating new hire documentation than touching any code since Larry and Moe joined the team, we couldn't afford to just up and lose RightHand with no knowledge transfer period even if he were being replaced with someone who hadn't just joined the company, and you _specifically said_ that you'd give me a week's warning the next time something changed.  \n&gt; **Me:** Just give us until Monday, that's all I ask for.  That'll at least let us get a brain dump from RightHand and get NewGuy up to speed as best we can.  I'd prefer something like a month so everything stabilizes, but I know that's never going to happen.\n\nNewVP pondered for a bit, while I tried to convey \"Pretty pretty please with a cherry on top and also I'll hate you forever if you say no\" via body language without actually doing or saying anything that might get me in trouble.\n\n&gt; **NewVP:** Okay, you have a week.  I'll talk to the other managers and make it work.  I really am sorry for all the last-minute changes, and I'm going to stick to my promise about giving more notice.\n\nI walked out of the meeting room smiling for the first time in weeks and moseyed over to RightHand's desk.\n\n&gt; **RightHand:** Hey dude, so, bad news.  I'm leaving the team tomorrow.  \n&gt; **Me:** Good news, no you're not.  \n&gt; **RightHand:** Huh?  \n&gt; **Me:** I just talked to NewVP.  You're with us for the rest of the week.  \n&gt; **RightHand:** Oh thank god.  I didn't want to leave you with just...  \n&gt; **RightHand:** *waves vaguely toward certain team members*  \n&gt; **Me:** Believe me, I know, and I appreciate it.  Just do everything you can with NewGuy and we'll make it work.  \n\nThat week, RightHand showed his worth as a leader and NewGuy proved his development chops.  RightHand somehow managed to cram two weeks' worth of training into a week and NewGuy came out the other side with the necessary background and confidence to, if not replace RightHand, then at least let us mostly keep up our momentum in his absence.\n\nThe next Monday, we bade RightHand farewell and moved people around to different tasks to compensate for the loss.  Fortunately, there wasn't any sign of another--\n\n*ding!*\n\nOH FOR FUCK'S SAKE NEWVP WHAT DO YOU WANT NOW!?\n\n&gt; **NewVP:**  \n&gt; Hi DB_Dev,\n&gt; \n&gt; We're looking around for someone from [other department] to rotate in to replace RightHand, and we might also need to rotate out Larry and replace him with Shemp in a few days.\n&gt; \n&gt; We're looking for a few others to rotate in afterwards so you're not shorthanded when Larry and Curly leave, too.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just wanted to give you a bit of a heads-up.\n\nಠ_ಠ\n\n&gt; **Me:**  \n&gt; ASDFSDGFJAHSDASD LARRY HASN'T EVEN BEEN HERE _THREE WEEKS_ SO WHAT HAPPENED TO GIVING A WEEK'S NOTICE YOU LYING SONOFABITCH AND WE'VE _BARELY_ ONBOARDED CURLY AND NEWGUY AND I'M SEEING THE NEW HIRE DOCUMENTATION WHENEVER I CLOSE MY EYES AND _SO HELP ME_ I WANT TO WALK OVER TO YOUR DESK AND\n\n*sigh*\n\n*Discard draft*\n\n&gt; **Me:**  \n&gt; Hi NewVP,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you for the advance notice.\n&gt; \n&gt; While I realize staffing and allocations decisions are out of your control, Larry has been a very valuable asset to the team in his brief time with us, and we would prefer not to have him rotate out at this time.\n&gt; \n&gt; Additionally, would it be possible for Larry and Curly to extend their rotations instead of having them replaced?  Anything you can do along those lines would be greatly appreciated.\n\nIt took several more emails and some pull from CoolBoss, but I managed to get them to leave Larry and Curly with us for several months, slow down the pace of rotations after that, and give us actual notice of any rotations we did get stuck with.  It would be a while before management moved developers around for pointless reasons again.\n\nComing up next: [Management moves developers around for pointless reasons again](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8ggbgo/database_support_13_embarrassingly_parallel).\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\n_You put two new devs in,  \nYou take a new dev out,  \nYou put a new dev in,  \nYou take an old dev out,  \nYou put a_ new _new dev in,  \nAnd don't say what it's about.  \nYou pull a hokey pokey and you jerk the team around.  \nFuck this, I want out._",

        "text": "So this is my first post here. I love reading your stories since it resonates so well. A little backstory on me, I work IT for the US Air Force. I deal with everything from a cop who doesn't know the difference between a donut and a cell phone to the Intel guys who are entirely too smart for their own good...but still can't work a computer to save their lives.\n\nSo, with that out of the way, onto my story. Today, I was driving my wife to an appointment she had and my kids (6 and 3) both had their tablets so they could watch PBS while we drove. For some reason, my 6 year old's tablet was giving her some lip and I could hear it freaking out. I ask her what was wrong but before she replies, I hear the powering off sound. I asked her if she turned it off and she replied with \"Of course I did. I had to turn it off and back on again so I could fix it.\".\n\nRight then, I knew that I had trained her right. And then it hit me, my 6 year old is smarter than 90% of the people who put tickets in for me to work. Got me a nice sense of pride and accomplishment today.\n\n*Edit:* Got some pride too.",

        "text": "Previously... [In Memoriam](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/6d0jc7/tfts_in_memoriam/). Alternatively, [Tales From Tech Support &amp; Office Index](https://www.reddit.com/r/patches765/comments/5isjnn/tales_from_tech_support_office_index/).\n\n\nHuh. You know, I still do technical stuff, and I still have plenty of stories to tell pre-current company... I guess I totally forgot to write about... you know... TFTS stuff.\n\n\nI am simplifying the specifics down a tad for the sake of keeping proprietary stuff hidden, but over all, the details are accurate.\n\n\n**A Curious Problem**\n\n\n$Vendor1 would experience one way traffic intermittantly. This would occur after a failover. There is multiple levels of redundancy which was supposed to prevent this. The quick fix was to reboot all related devices in a particular order. This was not considered an acceptable long term.\n\n\nVendor representatives from their highest tiers were on the call along with multiple representatives from a variety of groups throughout my $Company. Overall, I was considered \"the new guy\", not due to lack of experience with $Company, but due to how long I have been in my current position compared to the higher tier that was on the call as well.\n\n\nMy original exposure was being invited to a conference call to supply additional support. The issue had been investigated for almost a year by other departments. My group's only function was to shut (and no-shut) links for the testing they had previously setup. Other individuals had worked previous nights on this testing, and it was my turn (because it was so freaking boring to not do anything productive).\n\n\nWhy wasn't it productive? Because they kept repeating the same testing... again... and again... and again... with no variances. They kept expecting different results.\n\n\nThe first night, I used my \"new guy\" reputation to ask a ton of questions. They explained what they were doing and why they were doing it. The thing is... their explanations made no sense to me. They were expecting different results repeating the same failover process. No changes in configs, nothing monitored outside their predefined, frequently repeated steps.\n\n\n**Architecture**\n\n\nFirst, the architecture... Two vendors are involved. $Vendor1 makes a server. I personally think they made some extremely poor design decisions. It has two NICs. Primary and secondary. Both NICs have the same MAC and same IP address. This makes no sense to me from a practical standpoint, as it would cause more issues than anything I could think it would solve.\n\n\n$Vendor2 has has two routers. Each router is connected to a NIC, and the routers are also connected to each other with what I call (incorrectly) an IMT aka Inter-Machine Trunk. I believe it is properly called a hub link, but my previous telephony background keeps kicking in.\n\n\nThe troubleshooting the first night was switching between $Vendor2's routers, failing over $Vendor1's NICs, and basically rince and repeat. This was not the first time this exact testing was done.\n\n\n$Vendor1 said it was $Vendor2's fault. $Vendor2 said it was $Vendor1's fault. Just a lot of finger pointing, but what exactly was being troubleshot? They already knew the problem... they have duplicated it a dozen times before... and still, nothing new.\n\n\n**Night Two**\n\n\nAfter reviewing dozens of threads consisting of hundreds of replies... most of which was single word responses with a huge signature... I had a good grasp on what I wanted to get done. \n\n\nThe call started, all the necessary players were on, and they were about to do... exactly... EXACTLY... what they did the night before.\n\n\nI stopped them. \n\n\n&gt; **$Patches:** Before we continue with your regularly scheduled testing, there is some testing I would like to do since we have everyone together.  \n\n\nThere was some grumbling, but $SpazzyManager backed me on it. I've worked with him for over a decade in past positions, and if I am suggesting something, he trusts that I won't waste their time. It was nice having that level of trust.\n\n\n**Troubleshooting**\n\n\nI set up TCP/IP monitoring for $Router1. I requested a simple ping from $Vendor1 on the primary NIC. I saw traffic come in port 1, and then leave via port 1. \n\n\nFor the second test, I logged into $Router2. There was immediate suggestions that they test from the secondary NIC. I was forced to shoot them down. I requested a ping from the primary NIC a second time. Traffic hit $Router1 via port 1, and then left via port 2 towards $Router2. This was all expected.\n\n\nOnce the traffic reached $Router2 on port 2, it should have returned the ping results back on the same port. However, it left the router via port 1, back to the server. Problem was found, but what was causing it?\n\n\nAll four ports were part of the same VLAN... because why not make it even more complicated? The thing is, this told me the problem was with $Vendor2 not routing the traffic correctly.\n\n\nThe conference bridge was total chaos. Everyone was talking at once. Everyone was talking over everyone else. I messaged $SpazzyManager that I took my headset off so I can focus on figuring out a fix.  During this,  I was informed that $Vendor2 was looking at the differences with $Router1 port 1 and $Router2 port 1. They should be identical. Spoiler alert... they were.\n\n\nApparently, no one had ever checked port 2 on both routers. When I queried the configurations, a single line jumped out at me. Why? Because I had never seen it before.  \n\n\n\n&gt; mac-learning disabled\n\n\nI did some comparisons to known working comparisons, and not a one had that line in the configs. I even checked the master config repository. Not mentioned... not even once. That line was not supposed to be there.\n\n\nHeadset back on...\n\n\n&gt; **$Patches:** Excuse me... Hey, guys. HEY! I believe I have a fix for this, so please stop for a moment.  \n\n\nI removed the erroneous entry in the configs and had $Vendor2 repeat the ping test. It worked correctly this time.  \n\n\nAfter that, I had to explain... again... and again... oh, this time in e-mail... this time in e-mail to management... exactly what I found and what was fixed to correct it.\n\n\nI am still puzzled how this could have gone on for such a long time without someone else spotting that.\n\n\n**Afterthoughts**\n\n\nI've been doing this work for two years now. Honestly, there are times I still feel like the new guy because there is so much to learn. (Curse you, BGP!)\n\n\n$Tunes is convinced I must be some sort of artificial intelligence or alien life form because human beings don't think the way I do. He also says I have an insane talent for pattern recognition. \n\n\n\nIn conclusion, sometimes you do need a fresh set of eyes on everything. I didn't have any preconceived notions on how anything worked because... I simply didn't know. In this case, it worked in my favor.\n",

        "text": "A co-worker inadvertently nuked some production VMs, causing a small service outage. After cleaning things up, they were outside awaiting some official reprimand. I told them this story to feel better.   \n  \nMany years ago, in the late 90's, when dinosaurs still walked the earth and Sun was still relevant, I was one of two backup administrators at a pharma company. For separation of duties, I worked the 'non-regulated' side, which meant everything but clinical testing. File servers, database servers and laptops I tried to touch. I had a routine:  \n\n  \n\n* arrive at work  \n\n  \n\n* acquire coffee  \n\n  \n\n* check backups, flip DLT tapes and send the offsite tapes to Iron Mountain.  \n  \n* Do everything else my job required   \n\n  \n\nBackups ran overnight. As our company was growing more quickly than the IT budget, our backups were starting to 'wrap around' and run into the morning. This was an issue as the backup traffic and system load was non-trivial on the backed up systems. This was even more annoying when we were running out of capacity on our tapes. I'd sometimes have to manually stop a backup and re-queue it for that evening.   \n  \nTo make matters worse, the tape drives I had were hand-me-downs from the 'Regulated' side. I had a handful of single tape and 5-tape cartridge drives and could only get tapes after they no longer needed them. Regulated got the shiny stuff, including a 60 tape, 5 drive device with a robot and new tapes.   \n\nThe 'Regulated' team was an internal silo. Everything they did was documented and had to follow a standard procedure. Any variation from that procedure had to be written up in detail by some of the most literal non-technical people I've ever met. I did my best to stay on my side of the fence.\n\nOne week, I had to cover for the 'regulated' backup administrator. I printed out copies of their procedures the night before and set aside a handful of new tapes.  \n  \nThe next morning, I feed five new tapes in the robot before coffee and my own backup tasks.  \n  \nThis was a mistake.   \n  \nWhile I'm packing up my tapes for offsite storage, I check with the Regulated tape library to make sure it's working as expected. I'm getting zero throughput on the tapes I just put in. A quick test command show that the library sees the physical device, but can't write to the tapes. This is no bueno.  \n  \nAttempting to multitask, I grab a stack of new tapes and the Iron Mountain box and run to the server room containing the robot. It's 9:45 and the Regulated backups kick off at 10am. I'd rather not learn how to fill out an exception report my first day.  \n  \nMy day gets no better when I see the tape library. Some joker has put confetti in it.  \n  \nI open up the cabinet and start picking out the confetti. It takes a few minutes to realize that the confetti is advertising the exact model of tapes I'm using.  \n  \nOh, no. I notice that the new tapes have a thin cardboard wrapper around three sides of the tapes. One side is the same white color as the tape while the other helpfully describes the tape and benefits of purchasing it. Some fool opened the cases and flipped the wrappers around, then put them back in the case. A second fool didn't notice the cardboard and shoved the tape + wrapper in the tape library.  \n  \nI was that second fool and I had less than ten minutes to solve this. I needed to find all the cardboard and remove it without interrupting the backup or breaking anything. There are no obvious tools in the server room. The next office was the Windows server lead, George. George kept a few spare tapes in his office for convenience's sake. I saunter over in the hopes that I don't have to confess my idiocy.   \n  \nme:\"Hey, George, how's it going?\"  \n  \nGeorge:\"It's fine. I'm planning on staying late to ...\"  \n  \nI stop listening as I scan George's office for useful tools. I see my salvation in a carton of Lo Mein in George's trash. Two bamboo chopsticks are sticking out of the carton. I walk past George and grab the carton and chopsticks.  \n  \nme:\"That's great. Can I have this?\"  \n  \nI don't wait for George's reply as I run back to the server room. Five minutes.  \n  \nI open the cabinet and eject all the tapes manually. It seems that four tape wrappers are intact while One is shredded. Good.  \n  \nI remove the wrappers and put all but one of the tapes back in and start picking the cardboard flakes out of the remaining drive. As I grab them with the chopsticks, I'm putting them on the floor to reconstruct the wrapper. I've got a few bits and no time.   \n  \nI break off a bit of one of the chopsticks to pin the switch that tells the tape library that the cabinet's closed. This is dangerous, but gives me a bit more time to find the remaining wrapper bits.   \n\nI find the second to last bit on the bottom of the cabinet. Then the robot spins up and tries to load a tape in the empty drive. I see something cardboardy hanging from the bottom of the tape-grabber part of the robot.   \n  \nA few attempts with the chopsticks and I manage to pluck the last offending cardboard from the tape grabber. I slam the door shut and the tape library continues, nobody the wiser.  \n  \nExcept for George, who had been watching me suppressing laughter for the last few minutes.   \n  \nNo harm, no foul, no paperwork.   \n  \n",

        "text": "The things that people hang on to in the support field, are quite remarkable.  \n\nFriday evening, (after hours) I got a request from a department head for a login to a jumpbox.  Amusingly, the request hit ~everyone and everything~ before it reached me, but that's par for the course now.  Chrisjen is patient, and but had dropped me an e-mail on the side so I'd know.  Becasue there was an official ticket, I also got an e-mail from my boss, and Sadivir.  \n\nRequests to have a login to the jumpbox, isn't a rare thing, and totally something people should have, so I don't even think to much into it.  The request included enough for me to just dive in, without thinking to much.  So I started rolled up a login for Chrisjen, and sent them the credentials.  \n\n..... Cue the phone call.\n\n&gt; Hey Nero, this isn't working.  I'm using this hostname to connect to: winjump.314.opa.mcrn.net \n\nWe bought OPA from Mars a few years ago now.  Evidently,  Dimitri hasn't updated his urls, and is still using the URLs from when the company he worked for was still owned by Martians.  I'm shocked that URL still works.  I can't control that domain....  I also made a mistake.  To propogate a login across the windows domain, you need to log into the domain controller that the user was built on.  Dimitri has been logging into the ~other~ machine, and I built Chrisjen's login on winjump-2.net.myisp.net  \n\nI gave Chrisjen the hostname of the box I created their login on.  And I gave them a link to the wiki page with the hostnames I ~do~ control, which won't randomly stop working at some point, when the Martians clean up their dns.  I also said to forward that page on to Dimitri.  \n\nHere's hoping that Dimitri will change their work patterns.  That won't be the first time that not updating notes will have bitten them.",

After a couple years they added \"Consumer Support\" as a sub-group making my group escalations support for them. Consumer Support customers were home users, the product was $99 where the pro software started at $500 and could easily get to $10,000 or more. The company had this really dumb idea that if you had bought the $99 \"My Little Video Editor\" you could upgrade to the $500 product and be a real editor. The problem is that would be like selling you a 747 because you knew how to ride a bicycle. The professional product was nothing like the consumer product, in fact the consumer product's track structure was literally upside down.\n\nSo I had this one customer who had bought the pro software to edit his daughter's soccer videos. We spent about an hour on the phone trying to get him to understand professional editing which he just wasn't getting when:  \n&gt;Me: I'm sorry sir, you're entirely too stupid to have this product.\n\nI had intended to THINK those words but somehow they had fallen out of my mouth. When I said them the support area had strangely gone silent and you could hear the collective gasp of my co-workers.\n\n**long pause**\n\n&gt;Customer: You know what? I think I am too stupid to have this product.\n\n&gt;Me: Let me process your return.\n\nThe company had a STRICT returns policy, in box, unopened, if you'd even thought about using the product we would deny your return but THAT one was coming back even if I had to pay it myself!",

        "text": "I work for a fairly small but successful software company who sell bespoke software to utilities companies \\(gas, electric, water\\). A year or two ago we built a bare\\-bones system that we could re\\-skin and ship to a customer \\(with any additional extras they need\\) within a relatively short turnaround time. I work for 2nd line support but have been here long enough to start doing small changes for the Dev team when they're short on resource.\n\nOne of our electricity customers raised a ticket with 1st line support complaining that an authorised change had been deployed to their production environment and it was preventing any users from logging in. For our ISO certification management has been hammering down on undocumented changes, so this went up the line pretty quickly with our MD ringing our desk asking us to find out who had done the deployment and undo it.\n\nI had picked up the ticket and already attempted to login to the user system, with no issues whatsoever \\- and no problems reported in the logs. I had also noticed that the last modified date on the system files was quite old and didn't look like anything had been changed.\n\nI called up the user to ask what problem they were experiencing. I gave him the usual spiel on the phone which he interrupted to get right down to the problem.\n\n$**User**: Yes we cannot login, the system won't let us. We're clicking on the screen and we can't click anything.\n\n$**Me**: Okay, you can see the login screen though? What is it that has changed between now and the last time it was working.\n\n$**User:** The windmills are spinning!\n\n$**Me:** The what? The windmills are spinning?\n\n$**User**: Yes! The picture of the windmills on the login screen! They're spinning now and it's broken the login screen, we can't click on anything.\n\nThe login screen background is an MP4 file of some wind turbines spinning, what had happened was the entire time the users had been using our system their browsers had never made use of the MP4 mime type, and after some weekend upgrades it had all of a sudden figured out it could play video files. Rendering the video across their network was causing an enormous amount of lag and preventing them from logging in. While it gave us a good chuckle I was happy to know that it wasn't an error on our side.\n\nI reported back to the account manager and the MD with a *slightly sarcastic* email to the sound of \"We can all stand down \\- all we did was make the windmills spin\".\n\nThe next thing I'm on a conference call with the MD, the account manager, our infosec manager and the user in question and the head of their IT. Both the MD and AM had taken my somewhat sarcastic email to mean that we *had* in fact deployed an unauthorised change, and had gone right into damage control mode taking ownership of the ticket and escalating it appropriately. While not wanting us to lose face with an already disgruntled customer, I had to sit through a whole speech about how seriously we take issues like this and how we're going to resolve it \\- I was asked to explain the issue, which I had to do in such a way that didn't indicate blame or fault with anybody, then afterwards I was forced to agree to write a full incident report about the event.\n\nAfterwards I had to explain to my superiors that the product ships with the MP4 background, it's not just a skinned feature; every instance of that product has the same login screen and it's down to the whether the host/client are giving/interpreting the mime type correctly. They still thought I was *\"washing my hands of the incident\"* by refusing to acknowledge that something had changed. Either way I was stuck writing a report.\n\nAll of this could have been avoided if I wasn't so sarcastic in my initial emails, but this experience hasn't helped my temperament.  What shocked me about all of this wasn't the users reaction to it, but actually the MD and AM's reactions. They've been selling this product for 2 years and have at no point seen that the windmills on the login screen are *supposed* to move.\n\nTL;DR I had to explain to a user, the owner of my company and the guy who sells the product what the login screen of the product looks like, and that suddenly playing a video file was not the result of an unauthorised and untested change.",

I don’t know which one.\n\nIf you are confused with the slightly changing story, just roll with it, that is my mother in law.\n\n&gt;Me: Mom I understand but can you please.\n\n&gt;MiL: E, unplug the cable box.  I have E at my apartment.  He is going to do it for me.  I know E, I dropped the remote, but let’s just do it.  Dear this happened when I dropped the remote while I was walking \n\nE is her on again off again boyfriend.  I sigh at my baked potato.  I hadn’t eaten an actual meal the entire day juggling housework and a toddler.\n\nI had two reasons for the power cycle, but neither made sense to explain to her.  1 mother in law is the type that could have been on her dvd player and not even realize it.  2 She leaves her tv on nearly 24/7 to make sure her cat is never lonely, ie the issue might not be a remote one.  With the potato calling my name, the toddler off the couch, and the realization that if the remote really was broken, I would have to dig out one of my old remotes from work and deliver it to her that night, I hand the phone back to J.\n\nJ tries to explain what happens when a box power cycles, but gives up.  Less than two minutes later, my mother in law says she will talk to us later because she has been on the phone long enough (she considers it rude to be on the phone when anyone is over at her place)\n\nJ gets a text 10 minutes later that all is well.  I sigh in relief at my empty plate and smile that I actually read through my mother in laws ramblings without having to hop in the car and check on her in person this time.\n\nTL:DR- I manage to walk my slightly batty mother in law through troubleshooting her cable box on my day off.",

This means that depending what the problem is, engineers from entirely different companies might be sent out. As you'd expect, whoever is at fault eats the cost. If it's the customers fault, they get get to enjoy that just-been-billed-hundreds feeling.\n\nAnyway, one time a guy called with slow line speed issues. I check the connection on the exchange side. Yup, that's slow. Records show its consistently slow. I test the line, and the line tests A-OK up to the master socket belonging to Openreach, but detects a short beyond it.\n\nThat reading could be wrong, or it could be a fault with something we supplied, but 99% of the time it's end-user equipment. And that means it's troubleshooting time.\n\nMe: \" It's testing as having a problem inside the house. We're gonna need to disconnect everything and plug the router straight into the master socket to see if that resolves the fault.\"\n\nLazyguy:\" Can't you just send an engineer?\"\n\nMe:\"Well yes, but if they come to your house and find a problem with something that belongs to you, they'll unplug it and you'd be charged (comically expensive callout fee).\"\n\nLazyguy: \"What?!

        "text": "**tl;dr: Field service versus Big Shot Boss doesn't quite go down the way BSB thought.**\n\nReading [this TFTS](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/86h5jy/i_think_i_influenced_someone_to_quit/) reminded me of my first dealings with a screamer of a Big Shot Boss.\n\nCirca 1996, I'd been doing field-circus for less than six months and out on this call for a FruityOS desktop issue; before this I\"d worked as a FruityOS depot repair tech for two years, so this isn't unfamiliar territory.\n\nI arrive on site at this small (apparently fewer than ten employees) company and get a brusque-finger point and \"that machine isn't working\" for a total of a description from BSB. There's four desktops in that area, and my technical omnipotence hasn't fully grown in yet at this phase of my career. Fortunately, the woman using the problem system is much more helpful and walks me through exactly what causes the error she's getting.\n\nI don't recall the exact issue, but it was about half an hour to troubleshoot, test, and confirm working. I track down BSB and inform him she's all set and working. He grunts \"the database isn't working\".\n\nNow, in this era and for this size client, an actual relational and/or transactional database really isn't a thing. On the PC side of the house it's usually Abscess, and most FruityOS DBs are FileMangler; it's the big seller at the time, usually a workgroup share off the main user's desktop - servers are for those fancy folk who deal in High Finance^tm environments.\n\nFortunately^[dubious] two years of depot has brought me into close contact with FileMangler and its innards for layout and scripting. I poke around the system a bit and determine FileMangler's back end (running on the same system that had the issue I worked on previously) is hung up and I restart the application.\n\nBSB comes out and **completely loses his shit**, how I should never have touched the database and now its broken, etc. Surprisingly, this is the first time I've had a customer screaming in my face in my tech career, and I BSOD; Once he's done running up the front of me and down the back I sit down and wait for him to give further instructions.\n\nNothing happens for fifteen minutes, and I finally pull out my flip phone (such a luxury in the era!) and call HQ to describe the whole scene, including how I think I've major-league screwed up. My boss (one of  three partners) tells me not to worry, and to leave for my next call.\n\nIt's a day later when I'm called to the boss's office. She doesn't lay into me, but explains BSB is obnoxious like this on the best of days. Their database is a grossly-unstable beast because of his 'fixes' put into it and my actions of trying to fix it were perfectly reasonable. \"And oh, by the way, he continued to yell at people for the rest of the morning, and his executive assistant walked out,\" I'm told.\n\nThe executive assistant, I'm informed,  is his **mother** who, after seven years of this nonsense, apparently had enough of her brat of a child.\n\n**Epilogue**\n\nSix months later the same BSB was on the phone with my boss, and I got waved into her office as I was hitting the parts depot to hear her tell him, \"No, we're not renewing your service contract. You completely alienated our only FruityOS technician and he refuses to set foot in your office again.\"\n\n[edit: Oops, forgot to anonymize things]",

        "text": "For several years as I was working retail ISP support, there was a major US game console manufacturer who were fond of palming off their multiplayer connectivity problems onto ISPs when they had an outage they couldn't explain. At least in our region, anyway.\n\nInevitably, all our staff knew when this was going on, because we knew if *we'd* changed something. If there had been no firmware or hardware rollouts, but suddenly every third call was a request for help with port forwarding, someone at borked something and didn't want to admit it.\n\nAdditionally, anyone who called us about port forwarding was inevitably too ill-informed to do it.  Of the many, many users who called, not one of them could provide a recognisable protocol or port number. Just gibberish strings of letters with the occasional number thrown in for fun, to the point where I am pretty sure these poor users couldn't have all written them down wrong.\n\nAll we could do was explain what we needed and send them back in an endless hellish loop until they gave up or the outage was over.\n\nOne day, after another long string of numbers, I snapped, and asked the kid on the other end of the line:\n\n&gt;\"Do you believe them?\"\n\n&gt;\"Not really. It worked without doing this before, but what can I do?\"\n\n&gt;\"Well, there's one thing we can do to prove it one way or the other... We can turn off the firewall and put it in the DMZ.\"\n\n(For civilians playing along at home, putting a machine in the DMZ is A *Bad* Idea. All incoming internet traffic will be autoforwarded to that machine, unless there's a rule that says otherwise. There'a good chance that machine will be compromised in hours, or even minutes. On residential-grade networking equipment, it's An *Unbelievably Bad* Idea, as you will end up with compromised equipment on the same switch as everything else.)\n\nSo I explained the potential horrors, he agreed anyway, and I talked him through it. \n\nSurprise surprise, no connection. I arranged to call him back in 20 minutes while he rang console tech support.\n\nThey couldn't fix it, but both of us got to enjoy that smug feeling of catching them out as we reset the DMZ settings, and he got a months gold account credit.\n",

        "text": "This is the continuation of [this post](https://redd.it/8duj1p) which was inspired by [this story](https://redd.it/8dqrxk)\n\n\n**Promising lead #3**\n$Recruiter ($R) calls me up and says he wants to have a chat etc etc.  \nSo I head over to his office and we talk about my skill set. He has followup questions that basically tells me he's not full of s#!t when he says he used to work in IT.  \n&gt;**$R**: Well, this is a level 1 helpdesk role doing X, Y and Z but...  \n\nBasically he's trying to say, it doesn't look good being unemployed for too long and you should take this job I'm putting you forward for.\n&gt; **$R**: It's for $company, you'll be interviewing with the IT Manager who was actually guy I put forward for that role.  \n\nTooting own horn. Sure.  \n&gt;**Me**: Sure, do you have a copy of the job description I can take home and read over?  \n&gt;**$R** (Sounding a little defensive): Well we have a pretty casual relationship, I don't have anything on hand but it'll be the standard kind of stuff they'll have something.  \n\nI'm wary of this kind of thing because what really made my life suck at my old job was that my job description never got updated to include the extra responsibilities I took on and it came back to bite me.  \n\n\nI see no real reason to say no, it's all practice being interviewed at the end of the day.  \n2 days later, I get a text from $R. Interview with $ITMgr on Thursday 11.30am (Address).  \nI reply, \"Sounds good.\"  \n\nI arrive, talk to receptionists and say I'm here to meet $ITMgr.  \nI them sit and wait for a good half an hour. Eventually 2 men show up, one of who is the IT Manager $R knows. The other is the Support Staff Manager ($SupMan).  \n\nWe go into a meeting room and have a chat. $SupMan seems like someone I can get along with where $ITMgr on the other hand is more business.  \nHe asks about the 3 month gap since I stopped working and I said I'd almost finished CCNA and that I'd just completed ITIL.  \n&gt; **$ITMgr** (Scoffs): Sounds like a pretty good holiday.  \n**Me**: Well I'm trying to up skill to get a better job.\n\nHe seems uninterested and the rest is going through the motions and then the $ITMgr asks the question asked in every interview since the beginning of job interviews. \n&gt; **$ITMgr**: Why do you want to work here?  \n\nI have my stock standard answer about working at a smaller company and not having any room to advance which is why I'm looking to get my foot in the door and be part of a larger team with the potential to advance.  \n\nSkip forward to the end where they ask my if I had any questions. Based on the conversation I figure the previous person had left.  \n&gt; **Me**: What happened to the previous person in the role?  \n\nI was really hoping the answer was going to be that he moved up to a better role.  \n&gt; **$ITMgr**: Oh, he left because he wasn't given the opportunity to advance here.  \n\n*not word for word but it was the gist of it - I've made up my mind at this point*  \nSo the interview concludes and $SupMan offers to show me around.  \nWe get back down to reception to see me off.  \n&gt; **$SupMan**: Sorry for the long wait earlier, nobody ever confirmed you were coming.  \n**Me**: I responded to $R within about 5 minutes of him giving me where and when.  \n**$SupMan**: Well no harm done I suppose. Any last questions?  \n**Me**: Yeah, I was hoping for a copy of a job description.  \n**$SupMan**: I would have expected $R would have given you one?  \n\n\nThe following day $R rings me and says they're offering me the position etc etc. I've made up my mind already but I ask 1 last time.  \n&gt;**Me**: Did you ever get a copy of that job description?  \n$**R**: Well, no. I think you should have gotten all you needed from the interview.  \n**Me**: From what I heard in the interview, it feels like a step down from where I previously was and what I'm looking for.  \n\nHe has another go at the it's not good to be unemployed for too long spiel, same as when I spoke to him originally. He's trying to just push me to accept the job so he gets paid.  \nI pass and I haven't heard from him since.  \n***  \n**Seemingly Amazing Opportunity**  \nI got this interview through another recruiter and I'd actually recommend the woman I dealt with. She gave me some more information then normal about the interview, specifically that I wasn't the first person to be put forward. One apparently showed up and was unshaven, another didn't even bother to wear a suit. Another didn't seem to have quite the right skill set.  \n\nI look at the job description - I know I actually got one!  \nIt sounds a lot like my old role. Mostly helpdesk but some day to day stuff that'll basically be SysAdmin work.  \nThis interview was for a well known Not For Profit, having volunteered in the IT Dept of another NFP a few years back I felt that put me in a positive light from the get go.  \nI roll up to the interview in a suit and all, they make me sign in and then after a short wait I'm in a meeting room with 3 other people. I was told it'd be a panel interview and they all seemed nice enough. There's the IT Manager, Network Admin and someone from HR.  \n\nJust before we start, one of them says:  \n&gt; Just so you know if you see us typing, we're just taking notes and you shouldn't worry about it.  \n\nAll 3 of them have laptops, and I think nothing of it really.  \nUsual questions, I make sure to get in the fact I volunteered at $OtherNFP in the past and enjoyed the atmosphere.  \nThey ask for an example of a time I was unable to do something and how I over came it.  \nI had the perfect story for this which I had posted in TFTS [**2nd story here**](https://redd.it/293xw1) when the company renovating a building next to ours built a wall in front of one of our wireless links.  \n&gt;**Network Admin**: And what did you do to over come that problem?  \n**Me**: I called up the company who supplied and maintained the wireless equipment and had them move it 2m to the left.  \n\nChuckles all around, and I'm feeling good about my chances.  \nInterview continues and the only real issue that I felt caught me out was when they asked about PowerShell, which at the time I hadn't done anything beyond basic queries for Exchange.  \nSo I had used it which is better than \"Whats powershell?\" but not what he was looking for. Then one of other two stifles a laugh.  \n\nI look over at the woman from HR.  \n&gt; $HR: Sorry, we've got this internal chat program.  \n\nI engage my best poker face but can't help thinking \"are you in highschool!?\". I look at the IT Manager who's trying not to smile.  \n\nI realize what a waste of time this has been.  \nI think back to how much they were nitpicking the other people they'd interviewed. Thinking about it after the fact I decide their hiring policy must require them to interview candidates externally before promoting within.  \nI cool off over the drive home and I call the recruiter.  \n&gt; **$Recruiter**: How do you think you went?  \n**Me**: I was able to answer just about everything they asked but I don't think they'll go with me though.  \n**$R**: Why do you say that?  \n**Me**: Just a feeling I got while I was in there. Is it normal for interviewers to be using an internal chat program in the interview?  \n**$R**: Internal chat program? I wouldn't have thought so.  \n\nShe came back 2 days later to tell me that I hadn't gotten the job and it was because I didn't have the experience with the size of the user base they were looking for.  \nWhich was pretty BS since I'd told them we had over 2500 mailboxes on the Exchange server which I was the only support person with the IT Manager acting as overflow.  \nI hangup and think to myself. If they even listened the bad answer I gave about PowerShell could could have been a great reason to give but now I can't even be sure they paid attention.  \n***  \nA week later I actually got a job offer through a friend of my cousin for an immediate start.  \nAbout an hour after saying yes to that job offer. I get a call from the Someone else from the recruitment company who set me up at the NFP.  \n&gt; **RGuy**: Hey this is $RGuy from $RecruitmentCompany. I got your details of $R. I've got a job you might be interested in.  \nMe: I've actually just accepted a role but thank you for thinking of me.  \n **RGuy**: Can I ask what the role is?  \nMe: Systems Administrator at as small MSP.  \n\n***  \nAs bad as the interview with $NotForProfit was $Recruiter prepped me really well and I never felt that she was pushing me towards a job I wasn't looking for.  \n\nI've been working for this MSP for almost 2 years now. There are more stories to come but I'm waiting a certain time before posting a juicy story once everything's settled down.\n***  \nTL;DR  \nNot all Recruiters are snakes, and always make sure your friends and family know your looking for a job.",

        "text": "I have worked off and on at a local comic book/video game/hobby shop for about 10 years. I am good friends with all the employees and I have free reign of the store. This weekend, however, they messaged me with a problem with one of their computers. Since I ran my own PC repair shop before a crippling car accident ended my career, I decided to come by and take a look.\n\nI went to the office and go on the main computer, seeing that it was returning an error saying the boot device could not be detected. I followed standard procedure and ran chkdsk, bootmgr replacement, etc. \n\nEventually I grabbed my Windows 7 rescue USB and stuck it in the port (on the first try, which is always a terrible omen). When I went to the BIOS to set it to boot from USB, it wasn't there. Only the HDD, CD-ROM, and the Printer(?). \n\nThe manager at the time that was in the office with me jokingly suggested we plug the rescue USB into the Photo Printer since it was being detected as a boot device. With no other ideas, I shrugged and plugged it in. Lo and behold, it loaded up Windows Repair and we ended up being able to format the HDD.\n\nTurns out, the owner at attempted to 'fix' the problem with the video card by doing a destructive system restore, and turned it off mid-restore once he realized what destructive meant. It had no chance.\n\ntl;dr After several hours of troubleshooting and googling, we jokingly used the printer as a USB hub to reinstall windows AND IT WORKED. \n\nedit: [the dude at work](https://imgur.com/a/oyUdR5E)\n\nFollow up: I came in today to find that the starter edition of Windows I installed didn’t support extended view between monitors. There was also a short in the dvi cable causing the monitor to flicker. The owner decided I messed it all up and if he could’ve called his friend in (the one that came in later the day of the printer incident occurred and revealed to me he had no idea either, as well as applauded my ingenuity) he would’ve had it fixed in no time. Oh well. ",

        "text": "Short version: I work tech support for medical practice management software. There's a built in patient ledger that also allows for the creation of e-claims and receipt of claims. Once you've sent and received a claim, entered payment, and scanned in the Explanation of Benefits, it's really hard to delete claims because you basically have to undo each step of a 5-6 step process. We explain this in our online manual and when you call on the phone. Last week, I take this call.\n\nCustomer (C): I need you to help me delete a claim. It was misentered and it's messing up our daily production.\n\nAcrolloPeed/Me (AC:) I can help you with that. *Remote connects*\n\nC: See this claim here? We billed a few procedures but one of them was in the wrong format and they didn't pay us.\n\nAC: Let's look at the EOB you scanned in. It looks like you did get paid for the procedures that were billed correctly?\n\nC: That's right.\n\nAC: I would leave this claim alone and send a new one for the other procedure rather than delete or edit this claim. All the info is correct; you billed a bad procedure and didn't get paid, but the EOB shows that. You can send a new claim but just make sure to put the right date of procedure and it shouldn't affect your monthly production, you'll just get paid later, obviously.\n\nC: I don't want to do that, I want to delete this claim and start over with the right procedure!\n\nAC: I really don't think you should do that, we'll have to delete the EOB and the payment line item since you received payment from the check, unpay the procedures that you billed correctly, set the claim unsent, delete the bad procedure, re-enter it as the correct procedure, re-send it to the insurance company, and they'll reject the procedures you did correctly since they were already paid.\n\nC: I want the customer's ledger to look neat and I want the claim to look correct, so do all that!\n\nAC: I will walk you through that. Do you have the EOB and the check information? If I delete it all, we can't get it back from the system; it will have to be manually re-entered and scanned by you, since I'm obviously not on-site and don't have access to your paper files.\n\nC: Yes! Fine, delete it!\n\nAC: *goes through process of getting claim process back to square one* Okay, ma'am, now you need to delete the bad procedure, create the correct one, set it complete, and rebuild the claim.\n\nC: YOU DELETED ALL THE CLAIM INFORMATION! WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?\n\nAC: *silence, then:* Pardon me?\n\nC: You deleted the EOB and the check and all of the procedure information!\n\nAC: Yes, per your instructions, I took you back to the beginning of the process.\n\nC: I NEVER TOLD YOU TO DO THAT!!!\n\nAC: Ma'am, are you being serious? You literally told me to do exactly that, and I told you that if I deleted all of this data it would need to be re-entered manually, which is why I suggested leaving this claim as is and submitting an additional one for the correct procedure.\n\nC: I CAN'T BELIEVE I HAVE TO RE-ENTER ALL THIS INFORMATION!\n\nAC: Ma'am, what did you expect to have to do? Per your instructions, I have taken you back to step 1 of the claims process.\n\nC: I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO TAKE SCREEN CAPTURES OF ALL THE STEPS AND THEN RE-DO THE CLAIM FOR ME!!\n\nAC: ...I am not going to do that; also, I *can't* do that. You have the paperwork needed to start the process.\n\nC: No I don't! I shredded all that weeks ago!\n\nFrom here, long story short: both the customer (a doctor, no less) and her nurse practitioner coworker spent some time verbally abusing me as I laughed into a muted mic about how I'd screwed up their entire accounting process. I reminded them both that this issue started with the fact that they billed an invalid procedure to insurance, and instead of just sending an additional claim, they tried to edit an already-finished claims process manually.\n\nAfter the 3rd explanation that yes, they *would* need to re-enter the claim manually since it was deleted per their repeated instructions and against my own judgment, they ended the call. I jotted down the ticket number so I could check on the account later; sure enough, they called in the next day, hoping another tech could \"fix\" the \"mistake the other tech made.\" Nope.",

So the students in that class' job was to turn off the computer before they go home.\n\nThe bell rang, everyone rushed through the door, except me. I don't do that, except if I'm in a hurry. As I go through the door, the teacher called me, and asked me to turn off the computer, as one of the students forgot to. I obliged as it wouldn't take more than a second, or so I thought. \n\n&gt; $teacher: $manleynotboyley one of the students seem to forget to turn off the computer. Can you shut it down for me?\n\n&gt; $manleynotboyley: Sure. &lt;taps the power button and Windows 2000 starts shutting down&gt;\n\n&gt; $teacher: Uh uh, you're not supposed to shut the computer down like that.\n\n&gt; $manleynotboyley: When you simply press the power button a computer. It tells the computer that it's time to shut down. It's basically like going to the start menu and clicking shut down.\n\n&gt; $teacher: No. When you do that, it's like pulling the plug, while it's still running.\n\n&gt; $manleynotboyley: When you press and hold the power button for five seconds. It's like what you said. But if you simply tap the power button, it's like I said. It let the computer know that it's time to shut down.\n\n&gt; $teacher: No, it doesn't work like that. Next time, do it the proper way.\n\n&gt; $manleynotboyley: Okay. Have a good day.... (not).\n\nI wouldn't mind doing it the \"proper way\" but those Windows 2000-based Dells takes about 20 seconds before the start menu even opens. Then another 30 seconds before the shut down menu shows up. With simply pressing the power button, you can bypass all that and still shut the computer down properly.  Thankfully, I've heard that they retired those relics for Windows 7-based ones just after I graduated. ",

        "text": "It's been a while since I posted here. Most of my tales come from my previous job which ended when I more or less got fed up with the idea that the management team became half the people who worked for the company.  \nAfter reading [this story](https://redd.it/8dqrxk) it made me think of a few of my interview experiences.\n***  \nTowards the end of 2016, they were pushing and basically making my life a pain because I without thinking pissed off one of the 3 General Managers and in front of witnesses said No, the issue is your blindly submitting support tickets and without thinking was demanding a change in workflow that would make closing off tickets require a response from the people who submitted them.  \nThis being a user base of people who were hard enough to get hold of when they were having issues.  \n  \nSo yeah, I got sick of that job. I lasted about 3 months after the IT Manager left.  \n\nAll up I was probably unemployed for close to 4 months and when asked in interviews, I'd explain I was taking the time to get some qualifications. During this time I'd completed Cisco CCNA which honestly isn't that hard but gives a good basis for understanding for troubleshooting which I feel was helpful.  \n\nI also did something called ITIL which I don't believe anyone is a thing in the US, but is a framework for service providers. Not specifically ISPs but really anything dealing with people.  \n***  \n**#1 Promising lead**  \nI was a company who had an office in my city who were now big enough to have an onsite SysAdmin and Helpdesk person. The phone interview with the IT Manager went well, we spoke for almost an hour and the reason I was shortlisted was because my last role overlapped between SysAdmin and Helpdesk. The capacity for two people doing rollout stuff when there isn't a lot of support going on was a win for them and for me its better than break/fix all day every day.  \nSo 2 weeks go by and the IT Manager gets back to me and it turns out they're not going to be getting a helpdesk person and let the one Systems Administrator handle helpdesk on top of everything else.  \nI'm disappointed but I'm definitely feeling better about how much I'm worth.  \n***  \n**#2 What looked like a Promising lead**  \nI have a chat with a recruitment guy, and then there's why he called.  \n&gt; **Him**: You've applied for the SysAdmin role but to be honest, I don't feel you have the necessary experience for it. However we're also looking for another helpdesk person.  \n\nI figure get my foot in the door. Move up from there. I say I'm interested he says he'll call later in the week about lining up an interview.  \nI hangup thinking, nice guy  \nOn the Friday before I started my ITIL cert. This is 2 full days including the assessment. The guy rings up.  \n&gt; **Him**: Hey I've got an interview lined up for you! Can you come to our office first thing Monday?  \n**Me**: I've actually got ITIL Monday and Tuesday this week. It's two 9 hour days back to back.  \n\nI mentioned being signed up to do ITIL in the very near future and he said it was a great cert to have.  \nHis tone takes a drastic change, he actually sounds angry.  \n&gt; **Him**: Well do you want the job or not?  \n**Me**: Well it doesn't really line up. I have this course starting on Monday and-  \n**Him**: Well can you postpone it?  \n**Me**: Not without losing the money I've already paid to do it.  \n\nThe rest of the conversation just becomes clearer and clearer that I don't want to deal with this person.  \nHe hangs up in a huff and I immediately add his number to the block list on my phone.  \nThis was the first but not the last interaction with a recruiter that made me dislike them.  \n***  \nI had a few more dead end interviewers which I basically did purely for the practice, get used it and come across more confident when I go for the jobs I do want.  \n***  \nOne time I won't even call it a lead. Recruiter got me to interview with a small group, the instructions on where to go actually gave me the wrong address. I knocked on the door of a house thinking their office was a house that had been renovated and turned into office (Maybe?)  \n... It wasn't  \nBut I wasn't the first to make that mistake. Turns out Google reported them to be able a block down the street from where they should have been.  \nThe interview is fairly mundane. They primarily use Macs and do social media stuff so I'm not all that sure what I'm doing here. Most of the questions are fairly standard, I get one that's a little weirdly worded but I roll with it.  \n\n\nTHEN there's the deciding question, that I assume was made up on the spot. I'm not even sure I remember it correctly because no matter how I think about it it doesn't sound right.  \nIt was something to the effect of, we want to do (something) with an old server but (weird limitation).  \nI'm mostly caught off-guard by this question.  \n&gt; **Me**: Is it a Windows server or a Mac server?  \n\nI don't know how to answer.  \n&gt;**Me**: You said an old server, should I assume it's all working, or are you asking what I'd do to check everything was all good?  \n**Him**: it's on the floor. It's not plugged in.  \n\nThis information has not helped me.\n&gt;**Me**: I guess I'd rack mount it, power it on and see what OS it was running? Check it's specs???  \n\nThe question fell flat, he didn't know what answer he was looking for and it made the remainder of the interview a little odd.\n\n***  \nI've got a few more, might look at writing those up before I head off to bed.  \n[**Part 2 here**](https://redd.it/8e1csg)",

It's the $secretary of the institute in $otherBuilding, who tells me that they told my boss that $idiotProf told them that the computer in the seminar room crashed.\n\nSo I walk over to the secretary's office, and go to the room with them. I move the mouse on the computer, screen lights up, kiosk user is logged in, everything seems to be working correctly. So I go to $idiotProf, who's in the computer lab next door, and ask them to briefly explain what happened. \n\n$idiotProf: \"I started PowerPoint, opened my presentation and all of a sudden a thousand windows popped up. Then I told $otherProf about the problem and they did something and then there was something about updates. Then I went over to the computer lab to continue my lecture.

I went back to our office and tried to call $otherProf, who tells me the only thing they did was restart the computer.\n\n[Fast forward to noon]\n\nI call $idiotProf and explain to them that it should be working again. They tell me that when they connect their flash drive the PC crashes. Concerned that their flash drive might be contaminated, I ask them to meet me at said computer in 10 minutes. As I arrive I let them show me exactly what they did.\n\n$idiotProf plugs in their flash drive, AutoPlay windows opens, they open their presentation, start it and lo and behold, a PowerPoint message window pops up:\n\"Power Point has detected that your graphics card may not be configured properly...\", with a single button \"Ok\". If you click that, the presentation works.\n\ntl;dr $idiotProf was so scared by cryptic PowerPoint message that they thought the computer had crashed. If they had clicked \"Ok\", everything would've worked fine. The way they chose caused five people in total 1h of pointless work and involved two calls and two on-site visits.",

With all that background, the cast of characters:\n\n$me \\- former \"Principal Trainer\"\n\n$NPT \\- new \"Principal Trainer\"\n\n$Trainer \\- In House ITS Trainer\n\n$PM \\- pissy manager\n\n$SU \\- Super User who conducted training\n\n$STU \\- Student/Staff that was trained\n\n$TM \\- Training Manager \\(for simplicity sake\\)\n\n$PACS \\- Where radiology images are stored\n\n$EMR \\- Electronic Medical Record\n\nWhen we first went out to this location to start this Super User training process, we were less than pleased with one of the candidates that they proposed \\(had been working for less than a year\\) who was extremely nervous with the material that she was trying to present and didn't have it \"down pat\" by any means. I understand being nervous, but it was beyond that. The other two had been around for several years and generally knew what they were doing. We provided them with lesson plans to teach from along with other materials such as training logins so they can get into a non\\-production system to conduct training from so that they aren't touching real patient data. \n\nWe go back down for a follow\\-up when they actually have new hires to train so that we can proctor them and make sure everything goes smoothly and give them our blessing \\(we had already told them that the greenhorn was a no go\\). The person who is conducting the training is ready to go into production and didn't have any lesson plans and just sort of did his own thing. I wasn't necessarily alarmed when I didn't see lesson plans as I don't have them in front of me either because, well, I wrote them, but I've also taught other lesson plans that I didn't write from memory because I used to stand in front of a classroom all day and teach them. Not off to a great start, but the guy knows what he's doing so we give him the go ahead and say use the lesson plan next time... fast forward to this week:\n\n$PM emails $Trainer and says that they tried to train her and her login isn't working, $Trainer replies and copies in $NPT, $TM, and $me and says that her ID will not be active until she is trained which shouldn't be an issue because they should be training in the training environments. \n\nOne hour later $PM emails and says a very short \"Training Finished. Can her logins be made live please?\" I reply to our internal group and say make sure that you get the EUPA from her first as that's the protocol \\(this manager and I have had issues with seeing eye to eye before and this particular location is known for thinking that rules don't apply to them\\). $Trainer replies indicating such to her and $PM replies with a quick \"Seriously?\". None of us reply, and 3 hours later we get a scanned document of the test, \"Let me know when this poor woman can use $PACS/$EMR\". Before anyone goes about starting the documentation to get her ID activated, I decide to look at the test. She needed an 80&amp;#37; to pass and got a 60&amp;#37;. Mind you, anyone who gives one of these tests is supposed to make sure that they pass the exam, however, she didn't even come close. These aren't trick questions, they are extremely basic. I tell $TM that he is going to need to need to talk to her. He tries calling $PM twice and gets no answer. At this point, it's 4:45 on a Friday afternoon and I am going home for the weekend. I hope the rush order on this wasn't due to her new hire working over the weekend, because she's going to have a hard time doing anything if she can't login to the $EMR. This isn't the first time that we've had people say they urgently need to get training done as this person will be working overnight/over the weekend by themselves. Who hires a person and expects them to work by themselves the same week that they started? What if something goes wrong and one of the numerous moving pieces that you have to get in order before they can work doesn't line up as you expected? \\(P.S. the super user who trained her told us that he didn't know that he was going to be training anyone before 9 o'clock this morning\\). \n\n\\&lt;/rant\\&gt;",

        "text": "*A recent Ask Reddit topic about interviews that went badly reminded me of this little gem of a tale.  At the end of the day, I don’t blame my interviewers for their attitudes a bit, as had I known what I was about to walk into, I’d have Noped out of there as fast as I could.  As it is, $PioneeringTechCompany sure has made some amazing advances and, if not for the wife and family I now have from staying here and at $AviationCompany, I’d have still jumped at the opportunity to work there…*\n\nAfter getting out of the Army in the fall of 2009, I was able to last a whole 24 hours before reenlisting into my local National Guard—in part because I needed health insurance, and in part because I needed some sort of job.  It took me another couple of months and many, many applications and resumes submitted before I landed a job at $AviationCompany, and even then it was just for an “Interior Support Mechanic” position—basically fixing things like seats, walls, lavatories and carpet for $12 an hour. It wasn’t a great position, but it was a foot in the door.  Patience paid off ten months later when I was hired into an actual Maintenance Technician position for our Intermediate Maintenance group.\n\nOf course, that doesn’t change the fact that I’d been very busy, right up until I received the promotion, submitting my resume to various companies across the country…resumes I’d forgotten I’d sent.\n\n***\nThe call came in on a sunny May morning.  The previous fall I’d finally gotten the surgery to fix my torn meniscus (30% removal) that I’d been running on for the entirety of my Army career and after a long heart-to-heart with my Sergeant Major had decided the best thing for my National Guard unit would be for me to not choose to re-enlist.  Thus, that morning I had just arrived at the motorpool for their portion of the outprocessing checklist when my phone rang.  \n\n&gt;**Caller** “Hello, this is $HRLady from $PioneeringTechCompany ($PTC from here on out).  We have your resume on file and happen to have an opening in our Engine Manufacturing Group. Would you be interested in flying down to us for an interview?”\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “Uh…Sure!  Hi!  Of course, I’d absolutely LOVE to come visit you guys!”\n\nWe swiftly hammered out the details; they would be supplying me with a ticket on $SouthernHospitality airline, meal per diem and even a rental car and hotel room.  Needless to say, I was excited to get an opportunity to interview with a company that’s done some amazing and crazy stuff in the Aerospace industry—excited enough I was willing to entertain leaving $AviationCompany despite my promotion several months prior.\n\nThe following week, I hopped on the provided flight, got the rental car (A Mazda 6—it was really, really sweet…) and proceeded to drive…and drive…and drive…and drive.  Eventually I arrived in town and got directions to their facility which was still another fifteen minutes away.  Being that I prefer to scope out where I’m going in advance, I took a drive on out to scout the site.  As I approached, I knew I had found the place—there was an engine on a test stand and I could see the exhaust plume and feel the rumble as they tested it—it was a powerful monster of an engine, bigger than anything I’d worked on before.  \n\nI giddily returned to my room and prepared for the interview, the rumble still vibrating in my bones.\n\n***\n\nThe next morning I arrived early on site.  I had purchased some new steel-toed shoes so that I could take a promised tour of the facility’s work floor and dressed as suggested—casual business of collared shirt and jeans.  $HRLady greeted me at the door and led me back to a slightly cramped conference room in which I would spend the vast majority of the next few hours.  \n\nShe sat me down, asked the mandatory not-a-psycho questions and about why I wanted to work for $PTC.  I explained to her my fascination with what they were doing and the excitement I had felt yesterday scouting and seeing the engine fire.  The first hitch, however, was when she started asking questions about compensation.\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “Well, I’d like somewhat comparable to what I’m making now, which is [a number of simoleans].”\n\n&gt;**$HRLady** “….I see.  Is that a hard number?”\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “I’m willing to talk…”\n\n&gt;**$HRLady** “Okay, great.  But I’ll run this by the leads anyway.”\n\nShe left the room and about ten minutes later, three very, very sour looking men entered.  \n\n&gt;**Bob1** “Hi, I’m Bob1, this is Bob2 and Bob3.  We’re the floor leads for the engine manufacturing side.”\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “Hi nice to me—“\n\n&gt;**Bob2**  “What do you know about high pressure hydraulic systems?”\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf**  “Well, what do you mean, what do you want to know?”\n\n&gt;**Bob3** “It says here you’ve been working on engines in the Army, how can you possibly transfer any of that knowledge to what we’re working on?”\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “Well, in basic principles engines all do about the sa—“\n\nAgain, another question, fired at me more than asked, followed by an answer attempt, followed by another question lobbed.  As we continued to talk, I could tell these guys were getting angrier and angrier, but I couldn’t figure out why.  Finally, after an hour of pummeling me, they got up and left.\n\nI had never had such an awful interview in my life, and I couldn’t understand why it had turned so hostile, so quickly.\n\n$HRLady eventually returned and sat back down, looking visibly uncomfortable.  \n\n&gt;**$HRLady** “I just finished speaking with the managers, and they’ve told me the most they can offer is [one third of the simoleans you already make.]”\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “I’m sorry?  What?  That’s…that’s not a lot.”\n\n&gt;**$HRLady** “It’s as much as the leads make, once you account for the 80 hour workweek.  We have mandatory overtime.”\n\nThe penny dropped.\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf**  “You mean they….they…uh…wow.”\n\nI sat in stunned silence for a minute.  Here I was, some barely-thirty ‘kid’, fresh from the Army still, working for $AviationCompany and making more than they were already, asking for more than what they make with better hours.  No wonder they hated me the moment they saw me.\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “I..I should probably go.”\n\n&gt;**$HRLady**  “…Probably in our best interests to conclude this, yes.”  \n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf**  “Probably, yeah.”\n\nAnd with that, I left, no tour, nothing, drove back to the airport, flew home, and never bothered submitting for the per diem—I felt rather bad about wasting their time and they about wasting mine.  \n\nAs for those leads?  I really, really hope all the work they’ve been putting in has paid off for them, because $PTC is real good at making the headlines now.  They deserve it.\n\n\n*Enjoy the stories?

        "text": "$CC - Company I recently joined as a T1  \n$RG - Group we work with heavily, have AD accounts with us and all that but aren't technically a part of our company  \n$TPC - Company $RG works with\n\n--------------\nUser calls in. Turns out that $RG's overglorified search function for their knowledge base was kaput, no search results showing for anything. This is apparently powered by $TPC, used by $RG exclusively and points to $CC's servers in some cases. You may see where this is going already.\n\nApparently there was quite an email chain - or rather, five different ones - going on about this already between $TPC's support, $RG's general staff and admins, and at one point us. They're trying to figure out who's servers/software/etc are at fault. This has apparently been going on since yesterday morning, which makes it *bizarre* it isn't already solved because this search was pretty damn important for $RG. $TPC are apparently now pointing fingers at us, hence the call.\n\nThe unfortunate user, henceforth $UU, is a completely random non-technical $RG employee who all of this information is going through... for some reason. I mean her manager is involved in all these chains and presumably knows more, he could have called... but no? One of $RG's more technically minded admins maybe? $TPC could even have gotten in contact directly, god knows that'd have been helpful?\n\nBecause she didn't really know enough about anything to explain it aside from the basic issue of the broken search, I pretty much tell the user \"yeah forward us the emails, I'll get $DM to look into it\". $DM being ~~the person who keeps the helpdesk from burning down~~ a random T2 engineer (whoever is scheduled) who all the T1s report to and escalate with.\n\nIt is then I realise quite what had been picked up, as I watched the email chains come into our inbox. This was five randomly interspersed *long* chains that split and re-merged randomly, two of which were actually sent as attachments to two different ones, with no one I recognise involved... aside from one person, one of our T2s who appears to have basically gone \"uhh why are you involving us with this? Doesn't look like it could be our side that's at fault\". I asked him on IM, he doesn't even remember it, so apparently not much of a concern.\n\nAs you'd expect, because it involved a lot of people and rapidly switched recipients, the bulk of the chains were actually oversized auto-signatures and \"please save the environment by not printing this email!\" postscripts, which didn't help readability but at least made it less daunting than it first appeared. After spending 10 minutes skimming through them and sort of getting the gist, I go up to $DM - \"check email folder, things exploding, thanks\".\n\nI went back to taking calls after $DM questioned me a little and I pretty much shrugged. He spends 20 mins reading through it scratching his head, then he gets to calling our teams who might be involved. First the Networks team, then Systems Management, then Infrastructure. We'll figure out for sure what's going on!\n\nAn hour later, despite there being &lt;10 of us in the call queue, I happen to be the one who picks it up. Oh my, it's $UU again! Oh, what's that... we're to completely stop our investigation? That exact wording? Okay... why? You don't know, you've got another email chain and your manager just told you to let us know? Is the search working now then? No? Okay... can you forward us said email chain?\n\nTo be fair to $UU, it really wasn't their fault, they were just the middleman who had nothing to do with the situation all things considered. Although we never got forwarded that last email chain, so we were left even more puzzled. I went up to $DM to share the news, he had an \"uhh... okay..?\" reaction, as did the people he informed.\n\nI mean in the end it's not hard to figure out someone at $TPC probably went \"oh hell, it is our fault! Quick, get them to let $CC know before they figure that out!\", but it was just such a weird experience.\n\nThe best part is, because this was all done via email and speech, no one ever actually ever logged a ticket. I probably should have made one then insta-resolved it just for documentation purposes but spending ten minutes writing it up instead of handling calls wasn't worth it, especially when I barely knew anything overall.",

Notice the machine is incredibly slow so I open Task Manager to check for anything hogging resources etc. Hit the performance tab and see something that I've only ever seen on a server... An uptime of 310 days! (Proof - https://imgur.com/a/Bk6xFk6)\n\n\n&gt;$me - \"$User your laptop is slow because it hasn't been switched off since I gave you this machine. Thats 310 days this laptop has been switched on for!\"\n\n&gt;$User - \"Lies! Don't accuse me of that! I turn it off every day before I go home!\"\n\n&gt;$Me - \"I'm not accusing you of anything, however the facts here don't lie. Perhaps show me how you go about shutting down your machine then we can identify any further issues\" \n\nUser closes the lid of his laptop. Thats it. \n\n&gt;$Me - Facedesk.\n\n\nNeedless to say the laptop is performing great now after a proper shut down cycle and even updated his Java! \n",

        "text": "Long time lurker here, finally decided to drop my first post. Be gentle, it's my first time...\n\nSo since none of you know me from someone else's 3rd party driver for a depreciated COM protocol...here's some background:\n\nI have been doing varying degrees of tech support for upwards of 8 years, and been the family and friends \"computer guy\" for almost twice that. I now work in a deskside support role (also laughingly called Tier 3 here) for a major player in the bio-engineering field, within one of their primary manufacturing facilities. As you can probably tell from the time stamp, I work 3rd shift, so I basically end up being responsible for around 5 buildings by myself after about 11pm. Anyway, here is my tale of woe...not so much a PEBCAK or ID10T error, unless you count me as being able to generate one of those...\n\n**The Players: **\n\n$me: guess who!\n\n$oper: The CNC machine operator\n\n$sup: The work cell supervisor\n\nSo in our environment, our (IT) confidence in our user base is one step above DeepFreeze level (I might end up pitching that as an idea...wonder if it works with Win10), but while these users may know almost nothing about computers, they are brilliant when it comes to running CNC machines and subtractive manufacturing methods. We use a handful of shared domain accounts for use on these CNC machines, and the controller app usually auto-launches on login. Also, any machine being unable to run parts is basically an auto-P2. So when this exchange occurred, it was a big deal:\n\n*$sup, complete with $oper in tow walk into my ~~closet~~ office*\n\n&gt; $sup: One of our machines is down in my area...we can't run parts!\n\n&gt; $me: Okay, well...what is it doing? Are you getting an error?\n\n&gt; $sup looks at $oper: Are you getting an error?\n\n&gt; $oper: yes, it gives something about it can't load...\n\n&gt; $me: *to myself* ^very specific...thanks!\n\n&gt; $me: Let's go take a look.\n\n*$sup, $oper, and $me all troop out to the machine. I look at the faded screen, notice two things: 1. the machine is running a Win2k image (Yes, we have several...), and 2. the CCN app appears stalled with a fantastically specific error: \"Application failed to start\". No error code, or any identifying info. ^Thanks $CNCVendor...*\n\n*I proceed to make sure the machine is on the network, verify it is in the right VLAN, all that jazz...*\n\n&gt; $me to $sup: Okay, let's power cycle the machine.\n\n*We do a power cycle, usual 5 minute power off time, let it load up. 20 minutes just in watching it boot later...*\n\n&gt; $me: Okay, so go ahead and login...\n\n*$oper logs in using one of the shared accounts, the one used most. The app gives the same message when it loads.*\n\n&gt; $me to $sup and $oper: Okay, I will need to check with either the vendor or our network team, and make sure nothing is broken from an update or patch.\n\n*I go back to my closet and grab the ticket from the queue and update with what I saw, attaching a photo of the error message. I barely had time to save my notes, before another supervisor comes in for an unrelated issue. (Welcome to my world...) Time goes by, and I eventually have a chance to run the issue by my counterpart on a nearby campus for the company, who also works 3rds but comes in a bit later tham me. He has no idea. Finally, I find some time to make it back out to that machine to \"play around with it\". These CNC machines are all kinds of jerry rigged and basically held together with thoughts and prayers.*\n\n&gt; $me to lurking $oper: I heard that the building had a power outage over the weekend. Was this machine off when you came in? I see you logged in with &lt;shared username&gt;.\n\n&gt; $oper: Yeah, actually...it was off. I powered it on, but first thing that came up was that error.\n*I look back over to the screen, and -finally- notice the label stuck right above the screen. White label with black text, attached to a white machine... It has &lt;other shared login&gt; and &lt;password&gt;.*\n\n&gt; $me: Hey, $oper... let's try that login. Some of our accounts are pretty locked down, so maybe we are logging in wrong...\n*I log out, then log in with &lt;other ID&gt;... sure enough, app autoloads and no error to be found!*\n\n&gt; $oper: Wow...I feel dumb now.\n\n&gt; $me: Honestly, I can't believe I missed that. Looks like you should be good to go. Let's run a part while I go let $sup know it's up.\n\n*I walk to $sup's desk shaking my head and chuckling...*\n\n&gt; $me: okay, that machine is up and going. You will never believe what fixed it...\n\n&gt; $sup: okay, what was it?\n\n&gt; $me: Wrong login...the username is labeled right above the screen. I totally missed it. Since you were down on that machine for so long, go ahead and send the ticket number when you do your handoff report tonight. You can blame me for not knowing...\n\n&gt; $sup: wow, really? I should have known the login was different. It's all good, but they will want that ticket number...\n\n&gt; $me: no problem, I'll note what I found. Let me know if anything else happens. I have $oper running a part now to make sure it's all good.\n\n*I walk back to my closet shaking my head. I was relatively new to the company at that point, but missing the label was kinda dumb. I note the resolution and close the ticket. I also let my counterpart know what I found, since it hadn't occurred to him either.*\n\ntl;dr: Production machine goes down thanks to power outage, wrong login ID makes app fail. Tech misses label printed visibly with correct login.\n\n[EDIT]: Formatting fixes...",

        "text": "This will be a a little more encompassing of both ends, and why the 2 don't work well with each other. \n\nFirst off, I work for a major US company who is lacking in training new employees and also technical advancements. For Support Center employees, the turnaround percentage is crazy because of the training. A lot of shit is outsourced and while it's not the people that make it bad, it's the 2yr contract they're given (although quite a few I've met are quite happy to be able to travel around the world and work for different companies) which doesn't give them or us time to make a good repertoire, let alone for them to learn how the company does things. \n\nNow, when you start the SC job, your max training time is 2 weeks. Then you're on the phones to deal with 8+ applications on a linux box at best, mainframe at worst, on your own...not including networking. Most of the end users were only taught to \"click this icon/picture\" and it will take you where you need to be.\nFair enough. \n\nTwo months into working nights (thankfully), I get this call from a person that complains about everything being locked up. Mind you, most callers are on SCO shell Unix and have just as minimal training. I can only navigate so far at this point and we were definitely unable to screen share. \n\nI do all the normal pings to router, tower and whatnot after not being able to dial into the computer and determine she needs to hard boot it. \n\nThat's when my life went to hell. \n\nI patiently waited as I described the power button and told her to hold it in for several seconds until the light went off. She did so. I waited a minute, tried to dial in again and nothing. Waited longer, tried again. Pinged things and was getting inadequate queries so I asked her if she had done exactly what I said, and went down a list of things of what to look for, how to hold it in and when to let go. She enthusiastically said yes....the FIRST time.\n\nFast forward half an hour later of the same thing, my patience is gone (even though the only reason I had any was to keep my job as it's an on-the-job type of self training I've done over the years) and she's obviously done with it all too, I finally thought about it and had her describe the hardware that she was pushing the power  button on.  \n\nI had no idea that there are people using ANY kind of hardware for their job in which they couldn't tell the difference in. \n\nYep...she was pushing the monitor power off and on. \n\nThank gawd for mute b/c at that time, I was livid. I did not express my relief nor gratitude when she finally hard booted the machine, and thankfully, everything was fine after it came up. \n\nBiggest lesson in customer support - never underestimate the lack of basic knowledge by those that have been in their positions far longer than you. And who ever your gawd may be help you if you get stuck with one who needs the router rebooted.  (NOC's job? Pfff puuhhleease)\n\n",

        "text": "Hi everybody! LTL, possibly FTP, anything I've posted here before will be mostly inconsequential. I'm not in IT, but I'm considering going into the tech field right now, and am the resident tech nerd in my apartment for my roommates. I occasionally make $luser mistakes, but I do my best not to. This story is of a time I felt like one even after doing my best to not end up on the list.  \n  \nSo, the apartment I mentioned is actually a new development in this friend group, and we had a struggle to get our internet set up. The only Cable Company ($CC) currently providing any kind of service, including internet, to the complex requires you to call the office during business hours to transfer service. One of my roommates, $Artist, has an account with them, and finally got us set up.   \n  \nA few days later, the internet went down at around 1 AM, during stupid college kid shenanigans. I did the needful and unplugged and replugged everything, tested my own PC by hooking up the ethernet cord I use intermittently, disconnected and reconnected wifi on my phone, etc. Nothing worked, so I called the 24/7 support number, and the line indicated to me that they had a high call volume. Deciding it was probably a network outage, I went to bed, resolved to work on it in the morning with $Artist.  \n  \nBright and early, I got up with $Artist because she likes it when I'm there to help out with tech calls. She called $CC while I got busy ~~on reddit~~ trying to do homework. $Artist is connected pretty quickly, and later I'm told this is (to the best of my memory) how the conversation went:  \n&gt; Interlude for standard greeting and account information.  \n&gt; $Tech: What seems to be your problem?  \n&gt; $Artist: Our internet was just installed recently, and last night it stopped working again. My roommate tried unplugging everything and trouble shooting and couldn't get it working, we're pretty sure there was an outage?\n&gt;$Tech: I'm pretty sure there was no outage last night. By the way, you do know this is a 24/7 support line, and a call should have been placed last night?    \n  \n(I'll admit I made the language he used a bit more snarky, but $Artist did say he was snippy)    \n  \n&gt; $Artist: My roommate did place a call, he said there was a message about high call volume so he went to bed.  \n&gt; $Tech: (According to $Artist, much less snippy) Oh, well let's see if we can get that working again then.  \n  \nApparently after this they went through basically everything I did, unscrewing the wall jack from both the wall and the box, disconnecting the link between modem and router, turning it off and back on again, and after all that it turned on just fine again. I was left feeling a little cheated and silly. Admittedly I know it's possible there was just a glitch or maintenance and no outage, and that $Tech was probably presuming Rule 1 was in effect, but I swear I did all of that. Goes to show, sometimes it's a matter of timing.  \n  \nAnyway, thanks for reading, and sorry if this seems silly or out of place, just a funny anecdote I thought I'd share. Sorry if my formatting is garbage, I don't post much, and I'll correct any errors as I see them/they're pointed out!.",

It's been several months now since I've been with the new company now, but that doesn't mean that I've heard the last of $MSP sadly. \n\n$me = Tension\n$OB = Old Boss\n\nSo back in February, I was going through training on the company software, and getting the tour through our vCenter environment and setup. Things were going pretty well overall, I had just gotten flown out to California for training on the company dime, and I got to meet my coworkers in the west coast office. The day comes to a close, and I notice that I had received calls from $OB. Normally I would just ignore those calls and go on with my life, when I put in my two weeks with $MSP, rather than have me go through with it, he let me go that day. The day he let me go I still had to be up before the sun to perform a firewall install for a client, copy over their rules, and documents it all within the system. I got as far as install and copy, this is important.\n\nI call back $OB later that night to see what he needs.\n\n&gt; $Me: \"Hey $OB, I see you called a few times. Sorry I missed them, was in meetings and training.\"\n\n&gt; $OB: \"You finally called back, thank you! We need your help with $client site! Their firewall went out, and we have none of the settings documented. This was your install, do you remember what the configurations were?\"\n\n&gt; $me: \"I can't say I do. That was back in November. If you still have their old firewall on hand, you could just copy the configurations from that though.\"\n\n&gt; $OB: \"That's already been re purposed. We need those configurations immediately. Can you work on this for me tonight? For old time's sake and to finish up what you left incomplete?\"\n\nI get a slight chuckle of disbelief from this.\n\n&gt; $me: \"$OB, you're asking me to not only work for free, but to remember IP settings, rules, and all their VPN tunnel settings off the top of my head. You let me go before I could document any of that, and you said that one of my former coworkers would tackle that. I have no reason to do anything.\"\n\n&gt; $OB: \"So you're saying you won't help? After all I did for you through the years? All the training I provided to you?\"\n\nMy boss had me train for free on a backup software they use, and he did squat for me while I was there. Hell, he gave us all financial responsibility books one year as our Christmas bonuses. \n\n&gt; $me: \"No, I'll help, but it's $125/hr, minimum two hours down. I make no promises, but I'll do everything I can to get $client back up.\"\n\n&gt; $OB: \"That's ridiculous! This was your work that you failed to complete! I shouldn't have to pay you for this! If you don't do this, I'll sue you for damages I'm going to suffer!\"\n\n&gt; $me: \"Those are my terms. If you don't like them, then I wish you luck. You may want to dig through old documentation, you may have something left.\"\n\n&gt; $OB: \"F*ck you!\"\n\nHe hung up the phone after that, and I heard nothing back. I know they had to have had the old firewall documented somewhere before my leave, so unless someone deleted that, they should've been fine. Nothing legal has come through to me, so he was just trying to use his standard bully tactics to get what he wanted without paying OT to his current employees. As far as I know, two other people left the company shortly after me, and they have yet to staff it back up since, so at this point, he's putting himself under well enough without my help.  ",

I apologize, put them on hold, because $rec mans the front desk for the department that's most busy this time of day and that means this could be urgent.  \n\nPhone call transcript:\n\n&gt; $me: yes, $rec? *I'm in-house, and she's called my direct extension.*\n\n&gt; $rec: she doesn't have a signature?!?!\n\n*Our system allows patients to electronically sign consent forms.

I set it up. Give me a name, $rec, goddamit. \n\n&gt; $rec: you know, $trainee. She's the only one I'm training. *I'm aware of this person. She's possibly going to be training to be able to take over for $rec in case of emergency. HR has yet to request her to get a signature and password, and for now she's doing mostly billing. I have no clue when she's starting this though and have not been informed.*\n\n&gt; $me: finally. Thank you. Put in a ticket and I'll get to it. \n\n",

Seeing that it was not on they held the monitor button down.They proceeded to do this to not one but three monitors. Before coming to the desk to tell me the computer was broken.\n- I have been asked by young students how to save a Microsoft word document, I understand the older folks but fresh out of high school student asked if it was the square button. To which my reply was \"have you never written a paper before?\" Turns out they somehow got through high school with NotePad.\n",

        "text": "I work at a Pre-K - 12 school and we constantly have to remind teachers and staff how tickets work and how to submit one. I even started a \"Monthly IT Reminders\" email with the direct link. This happened today.\n\nOne of the Kindergarten teachers, who already complains about a lot, put in a ticket (YAY, she actually did it correctly) saying her school-issued iPads were not connecting to the internet. Other grades have testing today but I had a few minutes to go take a look before testing started, so I head over. She says, \"so I know I'm not supposed to put in tickets for personal devices....\" Right then I almost walked out. She has five fire tablets and five android phones sitting on her desk that someone donated to her (not to the school, but to her personally). I gave her a look akin to that of a disappointed parent.\n\nOur network has problems with Android devices, which doesn't matter because there are no school-issued Android devices on any of our campuses. We are waiting on an update from the manufacturer to fix it, but it's literally the least important item on my list and has no effect on work whatsoever.\n\nA few months ago, a lot of the staff would ask for help with personal devices so I added a question to the ticket system before they submit that asks if the device they are having an issue with is a school-owned device. If not, we are unable to assist. She marked yes and said they were her school-issued iPads just to get me in the room.\n\nTo sum up: she lied about having an issue with school devices to get me in the room to help with personal devices. I didn't assist her and reiterated that we cannot help with personal devices. Both of our time has been wasted. Her future tickets are now much lower priority. Moral of the story, don't lie to the people you are asking for help.",

        "text": "*Prologue: I know TFTS is often pretty forgiving in terms of allowing stories that are a little out of the ordinary and when I posted this on another sub, I was encouraged to share it here. Enjoy!*\n***\nThis call starts the way all my calls do: \"Hello, this is Thomas with Interstellar Tech Support. Who I am going to give five-star service to today?\" \n\nThen there is a long pause. I stare at the picture on my screen. It was pointing at...a wall? A yellowish wall. And that is it.\n\n**CAN YOU HEAR ME?**\n\nI immediately slam the mute on my headset control and then mash the volume down key on my keyboard. Then I unmute.\n\n\"Yes, just fine, and if I could ask you to step a bit back from your computer's microphone, that would be great. Also, any chance you could adjust your video camera?\"\n\nAnother long pause. **I do not understand your specialized lingo. Please say it in a basic way that normal creatures can understand.**\n\nWoof. This is not going to be a good call. Time to triage...I can control the volume issue but it would really help if -- \n\n\"There should be a ball with a cord coming out of it. Attached to it is a circle of glass in a plastic case. Please point the circle of glass at yourself.\"\n\nAnother long pause. Then the image begins to shake, and - slowly - lowers? Oh dear God, this thing had its camera pointed at the ceiling.\n\nWhoever - or whatever - I'm talking to, I still can't see it. The camera is now pointed towards an unused console in the corner of the room. Well...it's a start.\n\n\"Anyway, can you tell me what seems to be the problem?\" \n\n**I can't bring planets to my ship.**\n\nI frown. This...is new. \"I'm sorry?\"\n\n**PLANETS. TO MY SHIP.**\n\nThis is definitely going to be a call I can't handle on my own. I open a drawer on my desk to summon my colleague Jack Daniels out. I take a quick swig.  \n\n\"I'm very sorry, but...that is not possible.\"\n\n**YES, it IS. I do it ALL THE TIME.**\n\n\"Can you...explain a bit more? About how you bring planets to your ship?\"\n\nI have heard loud sighs before. I have heard exasperated ones. But this is the first one that made me want to murder someone. \n\n**I decide which PLANET I want to bring to my SHIP, and then I put the LOCATION of the planet into my PLANET BOX here, and then a little while later, the PLANET appears. I thought you creatures were supposed to KNOW how this stuff WORKS?**\n\nI take another brief consultation with Jack before responding. \"Okay, I think I understand n --\"\n\n**FINALLY!**\n\nI swallow. I glance at the printout I have over my workstation: *DO NOT THREATEN VIOLENCE TO THE CUSTOMERS*. \n\n\"What happens when you, uh, try to bring a planet to your ship?\"\n\n**NOTHING.**\n\n\"Do you have your...\" I sigh in spite of myself. \"Your 'planet box' nearby?\"\n\n**Yes, it's right here. OBVIOUSLY.**\n\n\"Okay...and what do you see on the display?\"\n\n**I TOLD YOU I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOUR LINGO!**\n\n\"Your...the black rectangle where you see things. On the...planet box.\"\n\n**WHY didn't you say so to BEGIN with? And I ALREADY told you - I see NOTHING.**\n\nI have a long discussion with Mr. Daniels at this. \n\n\"Have you tried hitting the power...er, have you pressed the red circle button?\"\n\n**YES. What do you think I am, STUPID?**\n\n\"Okay...so, just to humor me...can you press it again?\"\n\nThere is a low grumble on the other end, then a muffled click, and then a gentle *bong*. \n\n\"Alright, great, looks like that solved --\" \n\n**NO! NO! It does NOT solve ANYTHING!**\n\n\"You said your problem was you don't see anything on your planet box.\"\n\n**Because it was OFF. That's not the PROBLEM.**\n\nIt's not wise of me to kill the rest of the bottle, given that all I've had to eat this morning was a powdered doughnut...but...too late now. \n\n\"So what *is* the problem?\"\n\n**I CAN'T BRING PLANETS --**\n\n\"-- sorry, sorry, I misspoke. What is different about today than normal?\"\n\n**It's not letting me USE my PASSWORD.**\n\nProgress! Ten minutes in and I have finally figured out what the problem is. \n\n\"Ah, okay. So let's start with this - put in your username, like you usually do...\"\n\n**I ALREADY HAVE.**\n\n\"Okay. Very good. Now, don't type any --\" \n\nThe unmistakable sound of typing comes over the speaker. It is *painfully* slow, but typing, nonetheless.\n\n\"You are typing.\" This is part statement of fact, part cry for help.\n\n**NO I'M NOT.**\n\n\"I can *hear* you typing!\"\n\n**I AM JUST TYPING MY PASSWORD.**\n\n\"Stop it! STOP TYPING. DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING YOU STU --\" \n\nI remind myself that the calls are monitored to maintain quality. \"...upifyingly...um...wonderful...just please stop typing.\"\n\n**Okay. It doesn't matter now, it says I put in my password too many times and now it won't let type anything. Fix it.**\n\nI've made the \"head-desk\" joke many times, but never has the edge of my desk seemed quite so tempting. Sure, it would hurt...but maybe it would get me out of this conversation. \n\n\"I had *asked* you to stop *typing* because if you put in your password incorrectly too many times -- *which you have just done* -- it locks you out of the system for an hour.\"\n\n**FIX IT.**\n\n\"I *can't*!\"\n\n**YES YOU CAN!**\n\n\"Alright, you caught me,\" I say. My voice sounds a bit more manic than I planned. I drop it to a conspiratorial whisper. \"But don't tell anyone, we keep this a secret from everyone because of...reasons. Let me just write something up here...\" I open a remote session to the drive controls for the alien's ship. I try taking another swig of JD before remembering that I killed it. \n\nI take a breath. This is it. The end of my career, possibly my life. I override the security protocols and access the master control panel. \n\n\"Thank you for calling Interstellar Tech Support. I have been pleased to be able to give you five-star service today. Your problem will be resolved presently.\"\n\nI bring up the self-destruct menu. \n\n\"And on behalf of my fellow tech-support staff across the galaxy, I would like to tell you, firmly, sincerely, and in a basic way that even normal creatures can understand...\" \n\nI enter the authorization code. The system acknowledges and begins the self-destruct sequence.\n\n\"...*get f!!ked.*\"\n\nI end the call. A moment later, I go in search of more booze.\n***\nEdit: sorry for any confusion. This is fiction, but *heavily* inspired by TFTS. So the \"user\" is getting tech support for their space ship and the tech does, in fact, blow them up at the end. I of course don't advise trying to kill users in your current jobs, no matter how satisfying it might seem.",
