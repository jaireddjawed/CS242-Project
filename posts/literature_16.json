        "text": "This is the first in my series of reviewing all of Shakespeare‚Äôs plays. Starting with Henry VI Part 1 \n\nOverall: 5/10 ‚Äî a fairly rough piece of work, some glimmers of what would become brilliance shine through. However, the character work and plot is very rough. Not particularly recommended except for those extremely interested in early Shakespeare. \n\nFurther Comments (Spoilers): \n\nIt is not exactly clear how much of this play is written by Shakespeare, although this is one of the most likely to have been co-written. \n\nSome of the best scenes (and certainly the best character moments) involve Talbot. He is well portrayed and his death scene the most impactful scene of the play. Joan of Pucelle is also a competent antagonist, having some nice scenes. Furthermore, she is the most interesting historically for Shakespeare‚Äôs contrarian view of Joan of Arc (which has received much criticism over the years). \n\nIronically the worst character of the play is King Henry VI who is poorly characterized and doesn‚Äôt set up the next two parts well. The plot is also subpar, jumping around with too many characters and not enough character moments. \n\nBest Lines: Act III, Scene II \n\n‚ÄúBut yet, before we go, let‚Äôs not forget \nThe noble Duke of Bedford late deceased,\nBut sees his exequies fulfill‚Äôd in Rouen:\nA braver soldier never couched lance, \nA gentler heart did never sway in court;\nBut kings and mightiest potentates must die,\nFor that‚Äôs the end of human misery.‚Äù\n\nWhat do you think of this play?",

        "text": "Fairly new classics reader here. I've recently read Rebecca, Lolita, and Frankenstein, and now onto Wuthering Heights. From the first chapter, I could tell it was a jump from what I've read before. I looked into YouTube videos that provided historical context for the book, and I looked up the family tree (because a lot of the characters have similar names). After reading each chapter, I look up summaries and analyses of key plot points and themes. I've also come across podcasts with really interesting discussions (there's a 10-part Lolita podcast that is really well done, discussing the social/cultural impact the book imparted). Does all this make me a slower reader? Yes. But my understanding of (what I consider to be) challenging books are that much richer. \n\nWhat are your favourite supplementary tools?",

One of the assigned readings was ‚ÄúThe Office of Historical Corrections‚Äù by Danielle Evans. We read the book it it‚Äôs entirety (it‚Äôs a compilation of short stories) but I focused specifically on the short story that shares the name of the book title. \n\nFor my paper, I wrote specifically about how the story connects to ‚Äúthe veil‚Äù and ‚Äúdouble consciousness‚Äù written about by W.E.B. Du Bois in ‚ÄúThe Souls of Black Folk‚Äù and what that looks like with regards to women of color in professional environments in the current time. \n\nI found it fascinating to research and learn about, but because it‚Äôs a newer text, there were not a lot of peer reviewed articles about it. I suppose I‚Äôm just hoping to have some dialogue with others who had read it and see what others think about it.\n\nIf you‚Äôve read it, how did you feel about it?

It just doesn't make sense to me; I might be in the minority here, but sometimes I really would like to read something around 100 or 200 pages, but it feels like 99% of books coming out in the past few years have been, on average, approximately 400 pages or so. It's especially odd when I consider the economic incentives on publishing companies; shouldn't they *prefer* to put out shorter-length stuff, since book prices aren't 100% correlated with length, in order to maximize dollar-per-printed-page?\n\nAnyone here feel the same, or have any thoughts on the subject? And does anyone with knowledge of the publishing industry have any idea what's driving this trend?",

I'm fine with this and I'm not trying to make an argument against this New approach. \n\nHowever, I wonder if there's more \"Traditional\" department which focus more on Literary Tradition, History and Canons. For instance, in Politics something similar happened where the discipline has become larger and less historical. However, there's certain department like Berkeley and Harvard which have a much more \"Historical Approach\" to the study of Political Theory. Hence, I wonder if what would that be for English Literature.",

It has 'beams' like the sun, but it 'flames in the forehead of the morning sky' ('L', ll. 170, 171, p. 255), that could also be Venus. Lycidas rebom as Lucifer perhaps implies a pun on Greek words for light; one form of Phoebus Apollo, for example, who is present in the poem in an allusion to ll. 3-4 of Virgil's sixth Eclogue (see 'L', l. 77, p. 248), was Lykeios, one possible meaning of which is 'day-god'. If so, the pun is well buried.\n\nI'm guessing Venus (cf \"morning-star\") is the older meaning, but I'm curious about early references to the Sun as a \"star\" prior to the modern understanding that that's literally what it is.\n\nWhat do you think? Which does Milton mean here?",

He lives in a world in which words are limited: people can only use a specific amount of words per day. So he describes how he saves words throughout the day, when bumping into someone or running errands. Some days it's inevitable to talk a little bit. The only reason he does so is to save words for the night, when he calls his lover and tells her he loves her. The short story ends with the man being sad because at the other side of the phone, she is in complete silence, meaning she wasted her words somewhere else.\n\n**Any help** on the author (I think it's published literature, not just a random story) or clues for me to keep searching will be much appreciated. **Thank you!**",

I thought the way it was written was really well done, funny at times, witty, and just over all fun to read. Second, I was engaged with the story. Throughout the whole book, I didn't really feel lost or not knowing what was going on. I always knew what scene I was in and who was talking, and that was a breath of fresh air in some ways compared to what I normally read. And finally,  the climax is worth the whole read. The last 200 or so pages really outshine the rest of the text, and I don't believe that's an understatement. The book really builds to a bustling climax that just has to be read to be believed.\n\nAnyways, I loved this book and will probably read it again in the future.",

        "author": "Notamugokai",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/z1pv1u/mansfield_park_by_jane_austen_in_nabokovs_lecture/",
        "text": "After being prompt to give¬†Jane Austen her chance, Nabokov acknowledged her works and selected *Mansfield Park* for his lectures on literature. Amongst my notes on Nabokov's lecture about her novel, I'd like to review three points for some more explanation (plus a bonus question.)\n\n-1- Jane Austen uses 'oblique speech', says Nabokov. Oblique speech, or oblique discourse, could be¬†in practice¬†more than just indirection or quoting by another person (although the definition ends there). Maybe this is just me and my non-native English, and I fancy '*oblique*' could imply a greater mastery of the mediation of the discourse, for additional effects.¬†Anyway, if you have read Austen, have you noticed a special way of hers to render dialogue in that regard?\n\nThis curiosity I have also comes from another technique she uses for a¬†character who gets confused while talking:¬†this is rendered by a description of the general outline of his discourse but the intricate description itself reflects how the character gets lost in his stream, and the description ends by stating so. This is no longer an indirect speech, the whole discourse being summarized, or it could be seen as the ultimate level of mediation, leaving very little from the original spoken words (I hope my English is fine here, I struggled to explain.)\n\n___\n\n-2- Characters' attributes often fuel the construction of the novel (ex: poor health, so later she goes to the countryside many times). What strikes me is why other authors don't do that? What's so special here? Maybe it's how prevalent and systematic it is in her works while there are other means to solve those constructions?\n\n___\n\n-3-¬†How do we call the following technique? It's a kind of loose and¬†implicit¬†parallel.\nExample with some action that echoes in the mind of Miss Crawford (or the reader, at least): while playing a game (\"Speculation\"?) and placing a wager, she wonders if it would be worth it for her to choose Edmund as her partner. It is like a mirror between fiction (game, although it's the real action of the scene) and reality (prospective), as if choosing someone was like a bet for her future. Other *echo* cases use different planes and combinations.\n\n___\n\n-4-¬†Austen uses a technique VN calls the chess knight's move. After the description of an emotion, the sentence ends with a phrase that adds a sharp change of the way the emotion is depicted, adding a supplement about the mental state in another direction, possibly the opposite but not always. Something like, \"I don't care, but when you know tell me what it is\", but more subtle and ornate.\n\nThis technique reminds me another trait of Austen's style that¬†VN calls the special dimple. It's a furtive phrase inserted in a sentence, which adds information with a delicate irony. This time it's in the prose, so it characterizes the narrator's voice (even if it could blend sometime with the voice of the point-of-view character.)\n\nBut, back to the 'knight's move', do you know other 'signature¬†techniques' (from other authors) that refine the emotional state of a character?\n\n___\n\nThank you for any help, I hope I'm not asking too much. ‚ò∫Ô∏è",

        "text": "My book club finished reading Bataille's Blue of Noon, and I was curious if anyone on here had read it and what they thought?\n\nOne of the main things we talked about last night is that the three girls Henri associates with (Dirty/Dorothea, Lazare, Xenie) are potentially metaphors. Dirty being fascism/chaos/death (which our Henri is so obsessed with), Lazare being the middle class left with a savior complex, and Xenie being the stable family-oriented ideal.\n\nAnother thing we talked about was if Henri really is a necrophile like he claims. Personally, I don't think he is. I think he's more interested in the aspect of control as a sexual stimulant rather than truly desiring dead bodies.\n\nThemes we covered throughout reading the book were degradation, chaos and war, sexual desire, degradation of specifically feminine bodies, fascism, classism, catalysts for deviant behavior, death, power and control, cruelty, and the abject.\n\nDiscussing this book with others really helped deepen my understanding, and I'm so curious what people thought about it and what ideas we may not have touched on in book club. There's SO MUCH going on in that story for such a short text!",
