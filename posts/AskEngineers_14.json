Cantilevered out from one of the pivots is a pure vertical force. What are the horizontal reaction forces?\n\nI said it is indeterminate. There are four unknowns (two vertical and two horizontal reaction forces), and three equations (2 force sums and 1 moment sum). We know the horizontal reactions forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, but we cannot determine their actual magnitude.\n\nHe argued that because there are no external horizontal loads, the horizontal reactions forces are both zero. If there was an external horizontal force then the magnitudes would be unknown.\n\nWho is right?",

That means that there will be moments where the fan will be on but pulling against a closed damper. Manufacturer claims that static will just increase, the CFM will go down, and the fan will spin “against nothing”. However, Im obviously concerned that I’ll pull a vacuum and suck this smoker into itself. \n\nHope that makes sense. Any thoughts on whether the manufacturer is correct?",

There's a particular part of this machine (I'm not gonna name brands) that's given me fits for a long time, and the company help-line hasn't been particularly helpful. At the exit of the machine's collator (where it gathers sheets that belong together), there are two shafts, one powered by a 6 Watt kendrion electromagnetic clutch, and following that a brake shaft with a 4 watt kendrion brake (it's actually a clutch used as a brake) positioned to stop it before it enters the next unit. The trouble is that the forms often overrun that brake into the next unit by a couple of extra millimeters, triggering an error.  \n\n\nThis is the only section of the machine where, 1) the brake and the clutch are positioned on separate shafts, and 2) the brake is weaker than the clutch. Am I insane to think that this is a messed up design? I've got no engineering degree or anything, so any insight would be appreciated.",

        "text": "Hello fellow engineers!\n\nI would like to know what advice do you have regarding companies in Europe that are usual hiring junior positions (fresh graduate or with little experience) on the field of electronics (anything from analog design, RF/microwave, power electronics, digital signal processing electronics, etc.). Linkedin only seems to show me the big ones, but after a small experience on one of them (rhymes with Cadence), I strongly think I should look for a smaller company in order to learn more about actual electronic design! Nevertheless, I would like to know what companies should I give a search about and perhaps send an e-mail and my CV. I have had some \"big no\" answer which are leaving me a bit discouraged.\n\nI am also looking for a place that allows hybrid word (2 days in the office is my ideal maximum). That is because I am having a terrible experience having to go to a company 3-5 days a week, commuting for 4 hours total each day, and having to work in an open-space kind of office full of noise... So I am either looking to work remotely or to work in a company where commute can be easy (so I can have a work-life balance since it is impossible waking up at 7:30 am and arriving home at 9:30 pm) and the office is not as atrocious so I can have some peace to work (the noise gives me such an headache and I can't get anything done)...\n\nThere must be something out there.\n\nThank you!",

However, when I get test data the curve is a lot flatter and I get something along the lines of DeltaP = f(Flow\\^1.4). \n\nThe flows are all subsonic and there are no compressibility issues. The pressure drops are pretty small, and we are reasonably confident that there isn't much leakage.

I'm still interested in topics digital signal processing, control  theory, mathematics, neural networks, and probably many more topics I  haven't even put my foot in the door yet. I want to stay fit in these  topics so that when I need them, I'm good at them and have the  confidence to apply my knowledge and skills to a given problem.\n\nAfter  all, the pressure that university has put on me lead me to grow beyond  myself and has shown me what I am capable of.

I want to keep  pushing myself.\n\nBut how do I do  it? University has provided me with the whole infrastructure including  courses, teachers, exercises and tutors. From experience the quality of  learning material has a tremendous impact on how fast I learn and how  engaged I am. Selecting the right learning method and learning material  can be a gamechanger. Just buying books about topics and reading them  did not nearly work out as good than taking a course at university.\n\nAny recommendations?",

Obviously if someone gets really good at something very specific at the workplace that makes them the SME, and therefore the senior status. Maybe it's owning a particular process on an assembly line. I'm more of a jack of all trades, so that makes me wonder how I would get the senior title. \n\nWhat are your experience and observations?",

You can run a CFD simulation on a supercomputer that has 100k CPUs, which might or might not be very accurate but still always pretty expensive, or you can use a wind tunnel which will be   100% accurate because it is real life, and it's of course no cheap as well but could definitely be cheaper than a supercomputer depending on the tunnel and the computer. \n\nWhat real-life examples are there where an experiment would be more expensive, inconvenient, or even impossible than a supercomputer simulation of said thing? In the 1980s, I could understand why they were needed for many engineering tasks like CAD and simulations, because back then supercomputers were less powerful than today's personal computers, but today a high-end gaming laptop could probably run everything needed for 95% of engineering tasks(100% of them before the year 2000). And I bet for a well set-up internal server system that number is 99.99%?\n\n\nOr are supercomputers more of a benchmark for computer performance in computer science and electrical engineering, and not really that important for other engineering fields?",

The issue I’m having is if you bump the throttle while the tow line is slack, the boat takes off at full speed - then the rope goes tight and just about pulls your arm off! \n\nWith a load cell, or strain gauge I could detect the presence of a load and limit the current to the motor.  \n\nThe tow point is a 500mm long 40mm x 6mm aluminium bar.  What sort of resolution from a well applied strain gauge could you expect?  Would it be good enough to detect someone being towed, maybe 10kg of force?\n\nAre different materials better for strain measurements? Ie would a carbon fibre tow point be better?\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "I have a dial indicator with an accuracy spec of +/- 2um. If I start at 0um and travel 10um my distance traveled can be between 8-12um. Now if I travel another 10um from position 10um is my error range 18-22um or 16-24um?\nNote: my measuring is not based on sliding down a surface (x,y,z-axis). Rather the dial is only traveling in the y-direction (up/down).",
