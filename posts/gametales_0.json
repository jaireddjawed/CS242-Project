        "text": "TLDR: Our bugbear fighter robs Dwarven nobles, and gets his petty revenge with so many beans.\n\nI am part of a group that plays a weekly campaign, I was DM for a our last campaign and now I am currently a PC.\n\nOur Cast:\n\nGhorvick: Bugbear Samurai Fighter\nTotoma: Hadooze Sun Soul Monk/Rune Knight Fighter\nEdouard: Tabaxie Arcane Archer Fighter\nLuther: Dragonborn Artillerist Artificer\n\nRecap till the beans situation:\n\nAll of our characters have heard word of a kingdom that was lost to time, a group called the children of Fahe sent out invitations across the realm inviting all to come and celebrate. Our party gets there a few days early (some had a rougher voyage then others), and they settle in meet some NPC's and begin to form the party dynamic.\n\nGhorvick tries to impress a noble looking Drow, because he believes she is part of the children of Fahe, and challenges a rough and tumble looking dwarve (Bingo Beardy) to combat.\n\nBingo Beardy ends up being a noble from a Dwarven war clan, and beats Ghorvick to near death. The party brings Ghorvick back he is fine tho his ego is wounded.\n\nAs the days progress there is a murder, and so the party begins there investigation, while they investigate another person is murdered outside of the palace, this ramps up people's mistrust, and it also makes it public knowledge that 1 of the other guests is a red dragon in disguise \n\nThe party tries to keep everyone calm while trying to solve the mystery, Ghorvick tries to make a speech telling everyone to not be so secretive and to ban together to find the truth, which falls on deaf ears as Bingo calls him incompetent.\n\nTHE BEANS:\n\nThe next morning Bingo and his nephew, head out to unt down and kill the red dragon, the party had become somewhat friendly with the dragon, they help hide her from the Beardys.\n\nThe hunting party then ventures further into the forest away from the palace, the party then decides to investigate the unattended rooms.\n\nGhorvick and Totoma decide to investigate the Beardys room where they find two chests and nothing else, they pick the locks and open them and, SUPRISE TRAPS! \n\nOne fire balls sets the room ablaze, as the other sprays out poison, as Ghorvick assess the situation he steals all of the Beardys valuables, then remembers that the chef had a bag of holding filled with beans, Ghorvick extinguished the flames with the molasses coated beans. (Nat 20 for the win!)\n\nGhorvick then fills the empty chests with the remaining beans, gets Totoma to re lock the chests, convinces Edouard to prestidigitate the room to clean it up, then replaces all destroyed things with the untouched things from his room.\n\nThen Ghorvick and Totoma head out to see what goods they stole from the dwarves, many jewels, an explorer's pac, a diplomats pac, and all there clothes. They keep everything but the clothes and decide to place it deep into a fallen krag cats poop shoot\n\nAnd that is the beans event!\n\nIf you wanna know how this plays out you can tune in Monday nights 6 PM EST[right here!](https://m.twitch.tv/jordancfjd/home)",

        "text": "This will be a hopefully weekly ish up retelling of superhero game I am a player in. Before I begin I must worn you the readers that this is written on mobile and my brain has a thing which can make writing in a way that others understand hard, also this will not be 100% faithful the the events of the game details will be cut/changed/added for the enjoyment of the reader and to make it easier to write... without further ado\n\n\nWe enter a world that at a glance looks like are own untill you see that the speck in the sky isn't a bird, nor a plane, it's a man. The man in the sky is no super man he's ordinary or as ordinary as anyone in this world of mutants and powers can be he is also very lucky his ability is powerful, flight is great for travel, work, and reaching those tall shelves even if he can only move as fast as he can walk. Billboards prominently displaying heros and more lucrative the logos of that heros sponsors because helping people doesn't pay well but is great for publicity.\n\nNow we meet are Heros, newly licensed one's at that the kind of heros that the public call sidekicks due to there need to work under more experienced heros until they get the money and more importantly the reputation to start there own hero agency which is the official method of organizing heros in the US. Now are aspirants are as follow, the shy yet wild \"Eater\" the shape shifter inspired by nature, next the brilliant \"Nova\" a literally gravity defying super scientist, and last in are band is the mighty and very very very loud \"Bound\" a knightly man who can't remember his inside voice. Are party have met at the stageing grounds for a parade in fact is a parade for them, or well its a parade for every hero as we start are adventure on a national celebration called heros day, and we have to stand in one of the floats and entertain the crowd along with providing addition security from and nefarious scoundrels. After the currently unnamed group of heros are given a briefing by a older hero called Agent Mockingbird who is at this point already enjoying the festivities, and free beer which has left Mockingbird a bit inebriated. Which is fine as every time the parade was attacked by a villian which I should state is every time it's only been amateurs and D-listers so there basically no chance of us haveing to do anything because the cops can handle it.\n\nWe jump to the middle of the parade and the party are in the prime spot to show of to the crowd for the hero debut. Any formulation of plans are stopped as Bound suddenly asks Nova to use there gravity gauntlet to throw them, up, and I quote \"directly up as hard as you can\" which Nova does under the assumption that Bound has a plan. Bound has a plan which involves using his power which he described as \"high variability ultra precision telekinesis with a psychosomatic dependence on a physical focus\" or at least that's what his note card says, in essence Bound needs to be near there sword, and they get a super sharp sword, teleportation,and regeneration along with a limited use variable power. Bound then at the top of his arc uses his variable ability to generate a illusion of fireworks, and other pretty colors and sounds. Now dear readers you may notice a problem I said Limited use for the variable power, you know the one he just used, the one he used at the top of a arc through the air which happens to be over 20 feet up, now dear readers you may have also noticed that Bounds powers don't include anything along the lines of ya know invincibility or even inhanced durability. What comes up must come down, and well you see Bound did have a plan which just so happen to have been up to the point where he wows the crowd because he forgot the landing part which he uses the earpiece communicators to inform his team mates of. As he plummets to his possible death and definite embaracement Nova throws up a grav field to stop his fall but only slows it. The shy Eater which has been hideing under a pile of coats in the float was luckily on the ball, useing a combination of super strength and elastic arms to stretch out and catch Bound. Which leaves everyone on the float alive, unharmed even. And better yet Eatters side lunge and reaching hands, Novas gravity gauntlet grasping position and Bounds arms raised in triumph at not going splat leaves is in a pose, a bizarre pose. We jojo posed.\n\nEpisode 1 part 2 \"blatant foreshadowening\" whenever I wake up tomorrow, comments/corrections/questions appreciated",

        "text": "This game used to be the absolute prime app store game in it's time. I remember sitting in a hammock in the woods with just enough service to power this game. With a bunch of practice this game was just the perfect amount of challenge and grind to beat while still being able to not spend the entirety of your earnings.\nThey even had grand prizes you could win that would help with each level, like the automatic burger/hotdog cooker that never burned product. \n\nHowever, after all the updates that have completely ruined this game. Not only do you no longer earn royalties from the restaurants you spent tens of thousands of coins and dozens of diamonds to obtain, but also the fact you physically cannot surpass certain levels without spending a hyuck ton of diamonds.\nAnd bye-bye to the grand prize gifts, say hello to the new and improved $25 starter pack that immediately makes the first two restaurants stupid easy and fails to prepare you for the skill jump to anything besides the initial bakery and burger joints. Making the game completely unenjoyable thereon without spending more money from your pocket.\n\nCurrently attempting to replay the entirety of the game, I am on level 29 of the Bakery having maxed out all the coin upgrades both in kitchen and in the actual restaurant. Even having chosen a few diamond upgrades and rebuying the extra parfaits to corner the hangriness of the customers.\n\nImpossible. Absolutely impossible. You can see 100% that this company not only despises their player base, but wants to run the last few loyal players absolutely dry of their mon during such a rough time for our poor and middle class. This app itself has caused extreme fights between me and my husband.\n\nPlease Cooking Fever, remember your players.",

I've been DMing for the past year and we finished our first arc (levels 1 - 10).\n\nNow one of the players is sitting in the DM's seat, and we are playing high-level camping (level 10+).\n\nBefore we ever started this adventure he warned us that death is a part of the journey, he will not go out of his way to kill us, and if we die it is because we refuse to see the challenge in front of us or we did it to ourselves\n\nTL:DR: new adventurers think they can take out a Kraken. Fight it instead of running, resulting in a near TPK.\n\nCast:\n\nRay wizard bladesinger\n\nTotoma monk\n\nVulkan Cleric\n\nLuther artificer\n\nDm\n\nNow onto the story:Our group of adventurers finds themselves on a boat, and when I say boat it is an old whale-watching vessel braving the open seas because ..... money!\n\nSession 1 was spent getting to know our adventurers and the other passengers, we fought a giant shark, and a few quipper swarms and only our wizard Ray went down.\n\nThat evening as the group is resting Ray investigates the other passengers who were no help during the shark fight.\n\nAs Ray looks around he notices something is moving below the water's surface. As he runs to tell the captain to get more speed, he wakes his teammates up. They all make their way to the top deck just in time to see large tentacles begin to emerge from the ocean, and peirce the haul of the ship.\n\nCombat begins Ray, Totoma, Luther, and Vulkan start to fend off the tentacles and try to save the ship, Luther bursts into the sky, and fires spells, Totoma, and Ray jump on the Kraken's head unloading every attack they can trying to kill it, as tentacles swing around tearing the ship apart dragging it down to the ocean's depths, Vulkan being awoken did not have the time to put on his suite of armor, making him very squishy.\n\nulkan fought with religious fury, fell and was brought back a few times but ultimately was the first to fall to the beasts assault, Ray used every last resource he had but in the end all the arcane training in the world could not save him.Totoma fell unconscious into the ocean, and as Luther flew away from what was certain death, the Kraken also fled.\n\nAs Totoma awoke, he saw that another passenger that survived by running away (Rebiel the bard NPC) came back for his lute, and found Totoma unconscious in the water, and started to pull him away from the boats wreckage.\n\nThe next morning, Totoma and Rebiel caught up with Luther, all three exhausted from the previous night of fighting and swimming, all hope seemed lost until they saw a small ship in the distance.\n\nThey approached and met an old gnomish merchant and his wife, who were headed to the same land as our group. After purchasing Passage on the gnomes ship the remaining adventurers make it to the island, tired and beaten, but alive.\n\nTo see what happens next be sure to tune in Monday at 6PM EST",

We embrace the rule of cool 😎. \n\nShows we’re featuring: \n\nThe Adventures of the Spellbound: \nA fantasy futuristic space western-esk campaign. Commonly compared to something similar to Firefly or Cowboy Bebop. The crew is a group of characters that bumble across the galaxy looking for work and always seems to find some kind of trouble even when they are there to help those in need. They’ve gained and lost both crew and ships, they’ve made friends and enemies, and always just seem to barely break even, despite always being just on the edge of a quick payday. \n\nShots! Shots! Shots!:\nThrough the month of February and into March, we’ll be running a different one shot each Saturday night. Goblins! High fantasy! Zombies! Cyberpunk! And spec ops military!

        "text": "This is a story that spans two games of Killteam 1st Edition from about a year and a half ago. \n\nIt all starts with a friendly game between my Imperial Guard and my friend's Space Marine Chapter. The Guard were sharing a cramped transport with the Space Marines due to logistical errors, and tensions are already high. Then a glitch with the Gallar Field causes mass hallucinations and the ship is quickly divided down the middle with each side convinced the other has been corrupted by Chaos. \n\nMost of the fighting goes on in the Cargo bay, but the important stuff for the story happens on the Bridge. Two Guardsmen, two Space Marines. One Guardsman has a Plasma Gun, over charges, kills a Space Marine but his weapon explodes right after and kills him. The second Guardsman takes a few shots with his Lasrifle, but it bounces off the Space Marine's armor. The Space Marine fires back, but it clips the chair instead. \n\nThen the Space Marine gets the initiative and charges the little Guardsman. The 8 Foot tall heavily armored soldier takes a swing with his fists at the Guardsman, but misses! The Guardsman takes a stab with his Bayonet and misses as well. The Space Marine swings a second time, but misses again. The Guarsman takes a stab again and strikes true, wounding the Space Marine! Bleeding and stunned, the Space Marines falters, and the Guardsman slips away unscathed and retreats to regroup with the rest of his squad. The Hallucinations wear off and the gunfire stops. (The game ends at turn 5)\n\nA while later we have a second game, we try a 3 player free for all game, with my Guardsmen, the Space Marines, and friend's Tau. Both previous lists are reworked, and the Space Marine player shows up with 3 Heavily Armored Terminator Space Marines, one of which has the nearly impenetrable Storm Shield.\n\nSpace Marine player clarifies that the lead Terminator, with the Shield, is the wounded Marine from the last game wanting revenge. The Guardsman who he fought is on the field as well. \n\nThe Space Marines begin their march, all are going towards my Guardsmen. Space Marine Player claims it was the route with the most cover (this was a lie) and that the Guardsman he wanted to kill was the closest (also a lie). Lasguns bounce off them, even the sheering Plasma shots miss their mark. The Terminators close in, but before they can charge a Special Forces Tempestor jumps out of a second story window and lands on the leader, right in front of the Guardsmen they were after. The Tempestor has a Power Fist, and takes a swing with it. The little man hits one of the toughest infantry targets in the Galaxy, and hits his so hard he kills him outright. \n\nThe Space Marine player is aghast. He stares at the field in utter disbelief. His other two terminators kill the Tempestor, but it doesn't matter. On terms of Morale, I've won. His Space Marine was hurt by the humble bayonet, and was ended by a regular man. I lost the game on points, and the Tau player comments that he doesn't want to play a 3 player game if no one will actually fight him.",

The problem was his second guessing every call with an \"um actually\", I take his advice, sometimes over rule it, and he would get angry. I got hit with burn out and asked for a break. He volunteered to DM a WOW campaign. He hated my character, mechanically. Over powered healer, but that's a different story. He learned in his campaign just how little the rules can matter. Now we're are back in my campaign. Instead of being a rules lawyer, he is there for rules reminders or clarifications comes up. Talked to him about it. He said being on the other side of the table adds clarity. He still hates my healer though.",

        "text": "In summer 2014, I married my best friend and the love of my life. We spent our honeymoon at GenCon. Unbeknownst to us, D&amp;D 5e was being prereleased there.\n\nWe saw the booth, and got nostalgic for our college days playing D&amp;D with our roommates. I said, \"Fuck it. I'll DM, and we can play D&amp;D again.\"\n\nEver since then, I have run a weekly D&amp;D game. Our group has changed up as people moved away, moved back, or their schedules shifted. I took a 3-month hiatus late in my pregnancy until my son began sleeping through the night. And, another last year, when my husband took over the reigns.\n\nI got very ill for about a month, got better, then got pregnant with twins. During that time, I was just too pooped to DM. No worries though, my husband had my back. I swapped in as a Dragonborn Drakewarden, and he took over DMing the campaign. Finally got back into the DM chair last night.\n\nOur dungeons and dragons games have always taken place within the same persistent world; [The Holy Reman Empire, also called The Dragonborn Empire.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/5bjos8/a_dragonborn_empire_biology_military_religion)\n\nMost of my players are legacy characters. They're descendants of previous characters from previous adventures.\nMy husband's current character is 5 generations deep at this point.\n\nOver the last 8 years, we've built up an elaborate world of scheming intrigue, defiance against destiny, and knock-down-drag-out fights with Gods.\n\n[That time my players restored the true power of Death, and wiped out most of the Necromancy school of magic](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/8pm56d/lets_give_the_reaper_his_scythe_wcgw)\n\n\n[That time a player seduced The Elven God of Bards and made me cry.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/5ya85m/you_know_parties_break_up_but_your_memories_are)\n\n[When I organized an existential crisis for one of my players.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/5fnxu8/my_player_realized_he_is_that_which_he_hates)\n\n[When I designed a dungeon specifically to psychologically torture my players.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/apg1ot/the_vault_of_malice_a_dungeon_twisted_by_hate)\n\n[When my players forgot some bits of lore from a previous campaign, and I blew their fucking minds](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/8ov3ez/dd_5e_an_ingame_dramatic_reveal_became_outofgame)\n\nWith our 5th campaign, I wanted something different; I wanted to shake things up.\n\nFor session 0, we did a fairly cliched start; \"You are all cordially invited to an important party at The Palace\" kind of things... So we spend about an hour of characters getting to know each other, and describing how they prepare for this hoity-toity affair at The Emperor's personal residence...\n\nThen I clear the table. Bust out the pre-chosen miniatures. And slap down the map I drew.\n\nThey all wake up naked, in the absolute pitch-black darkness of a hastily-constructed ossuary.\n\nThey grasped about in the darkness for rags to cover themselves, and rusted weapons to defend themselves.\n\nThey make their way out of the dark and gloom, piecing together the fragments of their memories. The last thing any of them could recall was that they entered The Imperial Palace, intent on attending the party wherein The Most Holy Emperor, Lucan I was going to name his daughter as heir apparent to his throne...\n\nUpon defeating the tomb's meager defences, the players emerged into the light of the full moon to find Apollyon, a Tiefling necromancer, waiting for them.\n\nHe clothed them, armed them, and sadly informed them of their demise. He told them what he knew, from history books, of what became of their friends and family... All that they knew and loved was now 150 years dead. \n\nIn defiance of Death, and the natural order of what is even possible in my setting, Apollyon brought them back from 150 years of semi-eternal slumber.\n\nApollyon bound them to his service for a year and a day. They will obey him, and serve his cause for one year, and then they will be free to make their way in this world that has been broken by fall of The Reman Empire...\n\nAnd that's where we will pick up tonight's game!",

The renowned detective was accompanied by his stalwart friend, a barbarian warrior named Thorgrimm, and a young adventurer named Timmy, who carried his father's enchanted sword with a fierce determination. Rounding out their group was a swashbuckling heroine known as the Black Cat, her grappling hook at the ready.\n\nAs they approached the church yard, a sense of foreboding washed over them. They had been told of the strange occurrences at the cemetery by the local constable, who had reported that bodies were disappearing from their graves. At first, they had suspected grave robbers, but as they drew closer to the cemetery, they noticed strange tracks leading away from the disturbed earth.\n\n\"These are not the tracks of men,\" Thorgrimm growled, her eyes narrowed as she studied the ground. \"They are the tracks of rats.\"\n\nInspector Watson nodded, a grim expression on his face. \"Rat men, to be precise. I have encountered their kind before. They are cunning and vicious creatures, not to be underestimated.\"\n\nThe group moved with, their weapons drawn. They saw movement in the shadows. With a sudden, ferocious snarl, a horde of rat men emerged from the darkness, their sharp teeth bared and their claws glinting in the moonlight.\n\nThe heroes stood their ground, ready for the attack. The Black Cat was the first to act, launching herself at the rat men with her grappling hook. She swung through the air, taking out several of the creatures with precise strikes. Thorgrimm charged forward with a mighty roar, her sword cutting through the rat men like butter.\n\nTimmy hung back, his heart pounding in his chest. He had never faced such fearsome foes before, and he was not sure if he was ready for the challenge. But as he watched his companions fight, he was filled with a sense of determination. He stepped forward, brandishing his father's sword, and joined the battle.\n\nThe rat men fought with ferocity, but the heroes were more than a match for them. One by one, the creatures fell. But as the heroes closed in for the final blow, they heard a strange, ominous sound.\n\nIt was a low, rumbling growl. The ground shook beneath their feet, and a shadow emerged from the darkness. It was a massive, hulking creature, with the body of a giant rat and the head of a man.\n\n\"A rat king!\" Inspector Watson exclaimed, his eyes widening in shock. \"We must retreat, now!\"\n\nThe heroes turned and ran bravely away... the rat king hot on their heels. They scrambled over graves and through the underbrush, their hearts pounding, they could hear the rat king's growls getting closer.\n\nJust when all seemed lost, they saw a glimmer of hope. The constable and his men had arrived, their torches illuminating the scene. The rat king hesitated, its beady eyes narrowing, it clawed at the earth in a rage. With a final, desperate burst of energy, the heroes made their escape over the churchyard fence with the help of the black cat's grappling hook, leaving the rat king to be dealt with by the authorities riflemen.\n\nAs they made their way back to town and tried to forget the night by drinking at the Inn. The  Inspector knew that the threat of the rat men was far from over.",

He held his lantern aloft, casting a dim light on the slimy walls and floor. Grimbold had always been drawn to dangerous and hidden places, and the rumors of ancient treasures hidden within the gut dungeon had been too tempting to resist.\n\nAs he made his way deeper into the dungeon, Grimbold couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. He had heard tales of the toxic gases that filled the air in these depths, and he knew that one wrong step could spell disaster. He kept his hand on the hilt of his sword, ready for any danger that may come his way.\n\nThe further Grimbold descended, the more the walls seemed to close in around him. The stench of decay grew stronger, and he couldn't help but feel a sense of nausea rising within him. He fought back the urge to retch, knowing that he couldn't afford to be distracted by his own sickness.\n\nFinally, Grimbold reached the end of the narrow passageway. He held his lantern out, illuminating a massive chamber filled with putrid green sludge. The sludge seemed to be writhing and moving, as if it were alive. Grimbold hesitated, unsure of what to do next.But his curiosity and desire for treasure won out, and he carefully made his way across the chamber, trying not to disturb the sludge too much. As he approached the far wall, he noticed a small opening in the rock. Grimbold squeezed through the opening, his lantern casting a faint light on the chamber beyond.\n\nThe room was filled with treasure beyond Grimbold's wildest dreams. Gold and jewels glinted in the light, and Grimbold's eyes widened in amazement. He couldn't believe his luck. He began to frantically gather as much treasure as he could carry, stuffing it into his pack.\n\nBut as he was gathering the treasure, Grimbold heard a faint sound behind him. He turned just in time to see a horde of ghastly, slimy creatures emerge from the sludge. Grimbold's heart pounded in his chest as he drew his sword and prepared to fight for his life.\n\nThe creatures were fast and agile, and Grimbold found it difficult to land a solid blow. Sweat poured down his face as he swung his sword wildly. But despite his best efforts, the creatures seemed to be everywhere at once. Grimbold knew he couldn't hold out forever.\n\nJust when he thought all was lost, a bright light filled the chamber. Grimbold shielded his eyes, momentarily blinded by the intensity of the light. When he was able to see again, he saw that the creatures had all retreated back into the sludge. Grimbold let out a sigh of relief, his body trembling with exhaustion.\n\nAs he collected his treasure and prepared to leave the dungeon, Grimbold couldn't help but wonder what had caused the creatures to retreat. But he knew that he didn't want to stick around to find out. He made his way back through the narrow passageways, his heart still racing from the encounter.\n\nAs he emerged from the dungeon, Grimbold was greeted by a young wizard, her staff glowing with a faint light. \"Grimbold, are you alright?\" she asked, concern etched on her face.\n\n\"I am now, thanks to you,\" Grimbold replied, panting heavily. \"I don't know what that light was, but it drove those creatures back into the sludge.\"\n\nThe wizard smiled. \"That was a supposed to be a small light spell, but it may have ignited some of the gas in the chamber i'm sorry if I scared you.. I sensed that you were in danger and came as quickly as I could. I'm glad I was able to help.\"\n\nGrimbold nodded, grateful for the wizard's timely assistance. \"Thank you, my friend. I owe you my life. I don't suppose you know where I could get a bath ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/domyuvuhor6a1.jpg?width=2190&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6f0e6d65c2881cce2d6315d2e66d62c2a450cba\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[toxic gut dungeon of Orgal](https://preview.redd.it/yudala3kor6a1.jpg?width=7408&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=346dc61d8f8ace13de04373e3b6733f4f8cf433d)",

I only have a basic idea of the story, as I read it a long time ago, but hopefully it's enough for someone to recognize it! \n\nSo the story is D&amp;D 3e or 3.5. The narrator may have been a rogue I believe, and it may have been posted on the Order of the Stock forums? Anyway, it follows the party to this remote village on an island and they end up having to rally the town to defend against this huge swarm of insect-lizard monsters that reminded me of the Xenomorph from Alien. \n\nThere's a little more that I remember but it ventures into spoiler territory. \n\nThanks for taking the time to read this and for any help you might be able to provide!",

Since technically, everyone is mad, Strahd is a nutter and money is kind of useless in the campaign, we all agreed. It would encourage us all to do oddjobs, to gain trust to eat, get shelter etc etc.\n\nCue an argument with my DM which goes as the follows.\n\nMe: We need food! Just let us buy bread with our gold?\n\nDM: We agreed that Barovia has their own economy, (we had a cool name but for comical relieve, it shall be known as Strahd Dollers hence forth)\n\nMe: Well...what is the exchange rate?\n\nDM (as villager): The what?\n\nMe: How many Strahd Dollars to the Gold Piece\n\nVillager: I have no idea what a gold piece is.\n\nMe: Well....WAIT! How much is your bread in Strahd Dollars?\n\nVillager: Half a buck.\n\nMe: Ok, and it's 2 cp where we are from. So...50 loaves to the gold piece!\n\nDM: While I commend your logic, putting aside the fact that the villager would then have no use of the gold piece, like using a Hungarian Florint in a tribe in Papa New Guinea, it is not a clear cut as that.  \n\n\nMe: Well...the quality can't be much different. I'll try to ask the merchant to try so bread.

        "text": "\n\n_SETUP_\n\nI read that Facebook language model had been taken down. They were having trouble with the language model producing accurate results but the results were close enough to the truth that some people might not notice. It got me thinking about bot difficulty in video games. \n\nI greatly prefer to play multiplayer games over single player experiences. I've found in shooting games that use bots tend to have a M.E.T.A. (most efficient tactics available) strategy programmed into them. \n\nI'll use Gears of War for this example, I've seen bots who were facing the other way have bullets fired from their gun shoot directly out through their back and all hit me. The bots would only shoot when they were going to hit too. It's frustrating to play when even humans can't move like that.\n\n_BIG THINK_\n\nI think if AIs could \"learn\" what human players do in a match and then follow the best, mediocre and worst players as models for the AI, that would add so much to campaigns. Multiplayer often seems vastly different from single players experience. I hope this would align them more.\n\nThey could even use the AI smartness in other games.  Ex. \"This game uses the ViperX AI\" so the players know what to expect (realistic bots based on humans who have played that specific game) \n\nThis would be huge in racing games (kinda reminds me of Speed chasing his brothers ghost on the course from Speedracer) \n\nLet me know what you think of this idea. I've been thinking on it for a while too because I feel the AI models of bots is not scary and it really could be enough of a selling feature if done right. If different games keep using and building up a model (ex. ViperX) that could be really fun\n\n_COOL PART_\n\nThis also creates the ability for players to buy or build their own AI or ghost profile that watches them and learns what you do based on different circumstances the game throws at you. \n \nAssuming that machine learning comes with a cost the player has paid, then you could rent out your own personal ghost profile when you are not playing. By having it watch you it's now learned what you would normally do. Could even be 15% user, 85% ViperX. The profiles that are more learned from the user are more to rent or something. \n\nThis would be great because I could fill a multiplayer match with all bots who play based on player learning (like my favorite streamers or my bro who isn't online)",
