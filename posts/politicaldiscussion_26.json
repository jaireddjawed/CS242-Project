It also restrains Democrats when it comes to nominations to important positions \\[even the Supreme Court, should a vacancy come about\\]. Democrats would have to keep every member on board including Manchin and Sinema, with Harris as the tie-breaker.\n\nAlthough Obama went to campaign on behalf of Warnock during the run-off and Lindsey and Cruz also showed up for Walker, along with Kemp \\[the Governor elect\\]. Neither Biden nor Trump showed up and there is no plan for either of them to go there to show support.\n\nIs this an indication that this run-off is not so much about how the hard-core base goes, but rather, the moderates and both Biden and Trump could alienate the moderates or is there some other reason for their absence?\n\n[https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/3760138-why-biden-is-keeping-his-distance-from-georgias-senate-runoff/](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/3760138-why-biden-is-keeping-his-distance-from-georgias-senate-runoff/)\n\n[https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/04/politics/donald-trump-georgia-runoff-warnock-walker/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/04/politics/donald-trump-georgia-runoff-warnock-walker/index.html)\n\n[https://www.politico.com/news/2022/12/02/georgia-senate-runoff-early-voting-00071944](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/12/02/georgia-senate-runoff-early-voting-00071944)",

        "text": "In its order [Miscellaneous Order (12/01/2022) (supremecourt.gov)](https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/120122zr_d18f.pdf), the court scheduled the oral arguments to be heard February 2023.     \n\nThe Biden administration defends the loan forgiveness program, citing in particular the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003. This authorizes the Department of Education to forgive the student loans of some borrowers who are at risk of default because of a \"war, military operation, or national emergency.\" COVID-19, the administration argues, is a qualifying national emergency under the statute, as it was formally declared a national emergency by then-President Trump, and, subsequently, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos invoked the HEROES Act when pausing loan repayments early in the pandemic. The Biden administration argues that the need to mitigate the financial hardship caused by the pandemic has not gone away. \n\nBiden's plan would cancel up to $20,000 in student loan debt for Pell Grant recipients, and $10,000 for other borrowers, for people earning up to $125,000 a year or part of a household where total earnings are no more than $250,000. \n\nSix conservative states – Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska and South Carolina – told the Supreme Court that [Biden overstepped his legal authority](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/11/23/student-debt-loan-relief-supreme-court-states/10761989002/) with the program and violated the constitutional principle of separation of powers by embarking on a loan forgiveness program estimated to affect 40 million Americans.    \n\nA federal judge in [Missouri dismissed the states' request](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/10/20/student-loan-debt-forgiveness-lawsuit-gop-states-dismissed/10556660002/) to block the program in October, ruling that they lacked standing to sue. While their case presented \"important and significant challenges to the debt relief plan,\" the trial court ruled, \"the current plaintiffs are unable to proceed.\" On appeal, the St. Louis-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit [sided with the states' request to temporarily halt the program](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/11/14/student-loan-debt-forgiveness-blocked-appeals-court-puts-plan-hold/10592105002/).\n\nMore recently the court has been reluctant to expand Executive authority and even questioned the conservative have even questioned the Chevron Deference standards. [Supreme Court rules against EPA effort to regulate power plant emissions](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/06/30/supreme-court-epa-effort-curb-power-plant-emissions-climate-change/7390889001/)\n\nThe Supreme Court, in January, halted [Biden's COVID-19 vaccine-or-testing mandate](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/01/13/supreme-court-halts-bidens-covid-19-mandates-large-employers/9160176002/) for large employers. And in June, the high court shot down an [Environmental Protection Agency effort](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/06/30/supreme-court-epa-effort-curb-power-plant-emissions-climate-change/7390889001/) to curb power plant emissions. Last year, it [blocked Biden’s eviction moratorium](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/08/27/supreme-court-blocks-president-bidens-covid-19-eviction-moratorium/8243599002/) on similar grounds.\n\nThose decisions follow a yearslong push by conservatives to curb the \"administrative state.\" They argue federal agencies should have less power to act unless there's clear congressional approval. The Supreme Court bolstered that approach in June by relying on the \"major questions doctrine\" to [decide a climate change case](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/06/30/supreme-court-epa-effort-curb-power-plant-emissions-climate-change/7390889001/).\n\nEvidently, the Supreme Court decided to hear the case on the merits to put multiple cases to rest and issue a decision determining the limitations of Executive Authority. Is it more likely it will find POTUS exceeded its Executive Authority?",
