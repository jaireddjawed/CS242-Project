It's in the meta theory of whatever language you're working with, but it has a rigid definition. Computability isn't an issue unless you think Chaitin's constant also doesn't exist.\n\nFrom there went down a rabbit hole of Ordinals, Turing jumps, and the Kleene-Rosser paradox. Even defining what it means to be definable in a way that catches all things one wants to be definable is no easy task.\n\nI was initially going to make a post summarizing my findings in an accessible manner to non-logicians, but after three weeks, I still don't feel like I have a good answer to this question.

        "text": "This might be a silly and meaningless question, but I genuinely would love to know what everyone thinks.\n\nWhen someone asks me \"Is statistics mathematics?\" I always answer \"no\". By that I mean statistics is not a mere subset of (applied) mathematics, although they have a nonempty intersection. My reasoning is that statisticians care about different things, and do things differently than mathematicians. They same goes for other sciences and engineering.\n\nSome of you may disagree, but to me, math is the abstract formalisms and the axiomatic definition-theorem-proof way of doing things. That is, I distinguish between \"mathematical\" and \"quantitative\". Certain topics in linguistics and philosophy feel more \"mathematical\" than, say, business analytics.\n\nHowever, I think that's not the whole story. For example, chess feels more \"mathematical\" than doing calculations on a spreadsheet. The axiomatic nature of math doesn't seem to explain this impression. I've seen people say that math is the study of patterns, or the art of problem-solving, but these definitions seem too broad to be meaningful to me.",

So I am looking for math subjects that are vastly different to this. Where we do not basically study some sort of relations (morphisms) between our structures (objects).\n\nI am NOT looking for examples where category theory isn't enough and you need to look at your objects and morphisms concretely (for example I think analysis often does not rely on category theory - but your still studying basically functions). \n\nI am NOT looking for stuff which isn't quite a category but feels like one (for example if you have a space and take the 'category' with objects are points and morphisms are paths between points then this is not a category (composition isn't associative) - but it really feels like one and you can make it into one if you want to by considering homotopies or higher categories). \n\nI am looking for things that feel different (so probably these things shouldn't even be sets), like we aren't studying objects and relations but something else.

I personally love algebra but I can't figure out how to explain to him about the beauty of it.   \n\n\nCan anyone think of a really amazing way to explain it? I've tried explaining the small details, such as when you would use it in daily life. However, he's such a big/deep thinker that I think he needs to be able to understand the purpose of more advanced algebra in order for him to be able to understand why he's learning beginner algebra (i.e. because it's the foundation for more advanced algebra, which you will enjoy). I hope this makes sense. I just want him to go \"Oooh...okay, I want to be able to understand that sort of 'deep thinking' concept, so okay...I'll learn this if it'll get me there!\"",

I was once told that analysis gets its name from the fact that it often involves \"analyzing\" a function into an infinite series - i.e., breaking it down into infinitely many parts.\n\nBut that can't be the whole story, because what we now think of as elementary algebra also used to be considered \"analytic\" (e.g., Viete's \"The Analytic Art.\")\n\nMoreover, what we now think of as parts of analysis used to have the more self-explanatory name \"theory of functions.\"\n\nSomewhere along the way, the terminology shifted and the generic term \"analysis\" came to be associated with a specific branch of math (or rather, a family of branches of math.) Does anyone know how this happened?\n\nGiven his massive influence, I wonder if Euler's \"Introductio in analysin infinitorum\" had something to do with it.",

Now I plot those points on a graph. The 1st thing about this is that there isn't really a function to describe this plot, so I don't really have a function like x^2 or sin(x) to integrate or differentiate? I'm curious how people actually integrate or differentiate data samples in real world since i guess we don't have a continuous function only a set of discrete points, do we just interpolate data and find a function that best matches the data then integrate that? Could we split the plot into a bunch of piecewise functions and find a plot that best matches an interval of data points?",
