I've noticed something about the roads were built. On both there are grids outside of the city (and in Portland the east promenade acts as the boundary) which today are still there, and they also look like they were planned at the same time as the inner city ones. Why was it all filled in so staggered (looking at the houses)? Were they done the same time as the inner city ones? Was their first purpose for growing to fit what's alike in the inner city? Or was it more for less dense buildings? Like farms.\n\n",

However, I feel like it's sometimes important to think about the costs of doing so.\n\nAny time you try to expand or densify urban developments, environmental changes are inevitable... but even then, it still seems insane to me that, in the 21st century, we still just chop down trees left and right to create paths for new right-of-ways or foundations for buildings. I don't mean this purely from an environmentalist perspective; trees and wood also have commercial value, but I've only seen woodlands being chopped down and burned down and/or hauled off by trucks to god-knows-where in the wake of the development rush that's going on in my community. This ...seems like a bit of a waste to me.\n\nMy question is: why is this happening?\n\n\nI understand that [requiring tree transplants may be difficult for the purposes of carbon offsetting](http://www.deeproot.com/blog/blog-entries/the-realities-of-large-tree-moving) (as cool as it'd be)... but is there a reason why we can't recycle the chopped-down trees into something else? For example, if you're chopping down a forest for a new neighborhood, using some of the wood for structures (or furniture, if material properties are an issue) and manufacturing that onsite seems like a no-brainer. If you're going for a transit-oriented development, making bus shelters and park sculptures with the chopped-down wood also seems like a nice selling point. Either way, it looks like a good way to augment sustainable methods to increase property values (or at least do things that look cool for the sake of attracting new tenants or whatnot) to do so?\n\n(If recycling efforts like this is, in fact, happening, I'm surprised development companies don't use this in advertisements more...)\n\nThank you!",

There is also talk of towns being able to determine if they will be \"dry\" or ban home growing. News article [here](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/senate-passes-government-pot-bill-1.4713222) and [here](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/06/20/canada-votes-legalise-recreational-cannabis-use/amp/)\n\nInterestingly as the student in my office and one of the few under 40 I helped produce [this guide](http://www.gov.mb.ca/mr/land_use_dev/pubs/zoning_for_cannabis_guide.pdf) for Manitoba to inform municipalities on how to come up with zoning by-laws for marijuana. Thoughts on the policy, and tips on how your area handles it?\n\nEdit: formatting from mobile",

        "text": "So, this morning I rode the length of my city's LRT line. Despite its relatively diminuitive length, it does a fair enough job of transecting the city and showing it in *all its glory*. We started on the south side, with the car-demanding supercentre retail outlets in the auto suburbs; through communities of single-family-detatched bungalows and 80s strip malls; across the bridge into downtown, where drivers still can't bother to properly accomodate cyclists on bright-green-painted bike lanes; through the \"rough patch\" of town that city planners thought plopping down a stadium would solve; until, finally, we arrived at the final destination: the stop called Claireview (with nary a Claire in sight), surrounded by industrial manufacturers, shippers, and warehouses. And, of course, their workers' cars in parking lots, in weird oppositeness-and-yet-similarity to where the fabulous journey began. 10 points if you can guess the city.\n\nThe extent of my formal urban planning education (and, likely, a great deal of my bitterness towards my current city) came from a Human Planning course I took in my second year of university (quite a few years ago now, so forgive my rust). I remember talking quite a bit about residential and commercial areas. I remember talking about walkability, about different models of residential-commercial interaction, the complete community, and so on. BUT, being up in Claireview this morning seeing the sea of parked cars made me wonder: in the ideal community, where does the industrial area fit in?\n\nFor the sake of the argument, if we were fo assume that industrial buildings are absolutely necessary, where do they belong? Is it possible to incorporate them into a complete community, where they are within the easy reaches of active transport? I'd think that this'd provoke a lot of NIMBY, as such buildings are obviously associated with noise and pollution.\n\nPlanners of Reddit, what do you think? Or, is there a glaringly obvious solution of which I'm not aware?",

The idea of a Urbanpreneur quite interests me, as I live in a large developing US city that I believe is developing in the wrong direction especially for the future younger generations.\n\nToo less restrictions of future building development designs.\nCity land that could be rearranged.\nToo much open land throughout the city that is perfect for development but due to zoning laws, can't.\n\nBasically, what I want to know - is, could an Urbanpreneur possibly create an organization/startup/company that would be more involved with the direction of the city? Getting relevant people in the room together with everything towards city planning, creating a marketing team to influence voters and investors for future projects. \n\nI hope this post didn't come out confusing, but I'd like to hear feedback if these things exist and if there are any good sources or success stories.  \n\nThanks\n ",
