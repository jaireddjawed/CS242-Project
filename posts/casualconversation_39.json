After getting my associates degree, I'm planning on transferring to a local university to finish my bachelor's degree in an English major with a minor in secondary education to become a high school English teacher.\n\nI dropped out of college when I was 19 because of... a lot of personal reasons. Not long after, I started working at an Amazon warehouse, budgeted my money enough to move out of my parents' house, and lived on my own until I was 26. Now Im going back to college, and it's going really well. I'm saving up a decent amount of money because I've moved back in with my parents. (Temporarily. My therapist and I agree it's not a good long-term living situation for me) And I'm still working at Amazon.\n\nI have a pretty solid plan for what university I want to transfer next year after finishing my associates degree and how I'm going to manage living on my own again, working at amazon, and continueing school at the same time. It will be difficult, but I'm much more confident I can manage it all because I have more experience managing my time and finances than I did when I was in my early twenties.\n\nAlthough, I'm wondering how it will look in the future, after school, since I'll have worked in an Amazon warehouse for almost ten years and didn't finish college until I was 30. Does it look bad having so much stagnate time on my resume? School is a lot easier cause I have better time management skills than when I was younger, so my grades are all great and should have a great record after I graduate. But what does that say to an employer that it took me so long to reach that point of maturity? I feel a little worried that it looks like I wasted most of my twenties. \n\nThank you for any advice and encouragement.",

I saw this pretty big cat squish with a heart on it and I figured I’d buy it because why the hell not. Now I understand why people love Squishmallows. It’s like cuddling a lump of marshmallow fluff; they’re so squishy and lovely. That, and they’re actually pretty cute. Whenever I see my cat’s little face, I can’t help but smile. \n\nThat, and I have a decent amount of piercings on my ears, so sometimes sleeping on my side gets uncomfortable. These squishy motherfuckers are the only things that haven’t hurt my ears, and they’ve been amazing for healing my upper lobes that I got recently.\n\nI think this may be the start of a bed full of mallows. I don’t want to necessarily collect them, because I know that people are seriously into collecting them and that’s their main source of happiness. \n\nThat’s sort of the end of my rant.

        "text": "I know that some people meme on being single for Valentine's day, but, this year, most of my friends either have a boyfriend/girlfriend or are married, while I've been single for many years now. Call me sensitive or whatever, but this Valentine's is the worst Valentine's for me in terms of feeling insecure and unattractive. HOWEVER, instead of feeling down on myself, I've decided to face my insecurities and either admit/confront them head on or decide to make some big changes for myself moving forward. Will I follow through? Hard to say, but problem solving always starts with admitting that there's a problem in the first place, so I'll, at the very least, take the first step!\n\n* I have a very high-pitched voice. People have often said that I either have the voice of a girl or a middle/high school boy. It's the voice I was born with, so there's nothing I can do about it. Besides, I'm more than just my voice!\n\n* I'm overweight and have been for most of my life. Unlike my voice, however, this is, definitely, with enough effort, something I can change, so I'm going to start by eating pizza only once a week, instead of nearly every day.\n\n* I'm short. Let's be real here. Short guys are often seen as being unattractive. I'm 5'6\". Most of my friends are either 5'9\" or more, so, when I'm walking next to them, I look like a gnome. Hopefully losing weight will make up for it, but, again, nothing I can change. Again, I'm more than just one aspect of myself! I'm the culmination of many different things, which, while including the bad, also includes the good!\n\n* I'm a very loud person, and I do it on purpose because it gets me attention. Maybe it's because I'm desperate, but, having always been one of the more unattractive ones, you gotta do what you gotta do to satisfy your sad lust for attention. But I've never really liked being loud. It's just the easiest way to get attention. But I'm going to stop doing that. I'm going to be more true to who I am, rather than try to fake a persona.\n\nThat's about it! Sorry for the cringey post, but I want this post to be a reminder to myself that I've, at the very least, admitted these insecurities and have made the promise to accept them and change myself where possible. Happy Valentine's Day, everyone! &lt;3",

        "text": "Hey yall. 20F here. I've been in quite a few relationships for my age, but they've all been unhealthy or abusive for one reason or another. Not fun. I've been really working on myself for the past two years now and becoming the person I want to be.\n\nI met my current partner at my last job, and we became friends pretty quickly. It took us about 6 months to have the \"oh crap we have feelings for each other\" moment. And honestly I couldn't ask for a better partner or relationship. \n\nIt's his first relationship which honestly adds some sweetness to it because we're both learning in our own ways. We had a ton in common but a lot of differences too. We have really fun conversations and always playfully tease each other and laugh a lot. We've also been able to have some more serious convos and find good compromises and stuff. \n\nIt's such a rewarding feeling loving someone who loves you in a genuine way. I feel so much warmth towards him. I feel so greatful that we took a chance on each other even though I was a little unsure at first. It feels like every week that passes I become more sure that this is a really good thing. \n\nWe just started being long distance 3 weeks ago, and will be for the next 3/4 months(will see each other for 2 weeks during this time). And honestly our relationship has only grown. I feel like I appreciate him so much more now. And just idk, he's an incredible human.\n\nI just love how excited he gets at all these little things. He has so many passions and when he's starting to really get into one, he starts talking really fast and he lights up and it just makes me so happy. I love being with someone whose interested in so many things. \n\nAnd we're on the same wavelength about a lot of things. Like either he'll or I will suggest something and it's almost like common sense to the other even if we didn't think about it. \n\nAnyways, idk, I guess I just wanted to say. I feel so lucky that I was about to find a loving and supportive partner. I wasn't sure I would after all my bad experiences.",

        "text": "I cancelled my Spotify premium plan today in favor of an idea that I've been thinking of integrating into my daily habits. I've realized that I can pretty much emulate Spotify premium through just looking up rips/music videos of songs I like on YouTube, and putting them into playlists of my own. YouTube even has its own algorithm and I use adblock on the regular for the internet in general, so neither of these will be issues. Also, I should add that I'm *not* referring to using YouTube Music, which is their own streaming service, as I'm talking about just using the platform itself for this kind of thing.\n\nThe only downside I can think of is questionable music quality, but even so, I don't think it's that different from Spotify's compression, and if I wanted to stream in HiFi, I'd use Tidal.\n\nA lot of internet-savvy people above my age have said they do this for music discovery as well, and I was wondering people's thoughts on this.

I really appreciate the thought, however, I'm not really into coins and my wife and I live in a small house and don't have a lot of room to display or store miscellaneous things.  I'm conflicted between honoring his memory/legacy by holding onto them vs being more pragmatic and maybe after all the estate stuff concludes selling them to get something else that can stand as a reminder of him.  We weren't super close, but he was always very kind to us and I always held him in high regard.  I'd appreciate any thoughts on this.  He never had children so my mother, sister, and myself are his only surviving relatives.",
