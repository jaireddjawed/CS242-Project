        "text": "Hey everyone, before anything I want to apologize if I'm straight up wrong lol, but I had a \"crazy\" idea today, about how to find the square root of negative numbers. \n\nSo, we all know that to find the Square Root of a Negative Number, we use the Square Root of -1 = i, however, this answer is never definite, as \"i\" is undefined. So, I asked myself, \"what if we're looking the wrong way?\" It's logical to think that Always when you are going to find the square root of a number, you get a lower number. For example, Square Root of 16 is 4 &lt;- Lower than 16. Therefore, since Negative numbers are like a \"reflection\" of positive, it would make sense that the Square Root of Negative numbers is lower than the said number. Wouldn't it? For example, counting from -1 to -x will always give you a lower number than before, so could this be applied to Square Roots? \n\nIt's similar to a mirror, the reflection is the opposite of what reality is, as the mirror will bend the light. So my conclusion is, instead of using \"complex numbers\" (aka i) why not use lower numbers? Now I'm not a mathematician, so don't quote me on anything of this, but I had an idea for a new symbol...\n\n**The New Symbol (\\_**⎷) \n\nI came up with a new symbol, which would multiply the number inside of it by its opposite, so if you put \\_⎷16 it would give the equation: 16 \\* -16.  My idea now, using logic, would be that the Square Root of -16 would be -256, not 4i. Why? As I stated before, Negative numbers are like the opposite reflection of Positive numbers, so if sqrt(256) = 16, then sqrt(-16) = -256. As I stated in the beginning, you always get a lower number when applying sqrt(x), so how would the sqrt of a Negative be a positive number? Using logic, it should be lower than said number. Now, to verify this, you would \\_⎷256, which = 256 \\* -256 = -65,536. Wait, oh no... that doesn't seem right? \n\n**Infinite Negative Numbers**\n\nIt's common knowledge that both Positive and Negative numbers have an infinite amount of different digits. And for example, when you're finding the sqrt of 256, you will go lower, to 16, then you could go lower, to 4, then even lower, to 2, then even lower, to 1, that would be the max you could go. However, the max square root of Negative numbers would be -∞ , why? Because following the pattern from positive numbers, you always go lower, therefore the square root of -256 Needs to be lower than itself, which if I'm right, would be -65,356, then -4,271,406,736, etc\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nI'm proposing a new symbol,  \\_⎷, which would multiply the number in it, by its opposite. If I'm right, it would find the square root of any Negative number, instead of using an imaginary, undefined number (i). I think this would be easier to accept, rather than a 4th-dimensional number, that has an undefined value and we can't even comprehend.\n\n[The symbol I'm proposing](https://preview.redd.it/7bxn0ucl03ea1.png?width=543&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6146f69e07a016ea8552694d45f557db81bb4a9e)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Am I onto something or just straight-up lost?

Copying and pasting because i can't find a Web-accessible archive of current list posts.\n\n&gt;I am devastated by the news that Bill Lawvere passed away yesterday. Truly, we have lost one of the giants of our subject. I imagine everyone on this list will have their own special memories of him; here are a few of mine.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It was fifty years ago this month that I first corresponded with Bill, sending him the first draft of my paper \\`The associated sheaf functor in an elementary topos' (which he accepted for publication in JPAA). I still have the reply he sent me: re-reading it brought tears to my eyes as I remembered the very considerable trouble he had taken to help and encourage a young author who was then totally unknown to him, by giving me excellent advice on how to sharpen the presentation of the paper.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We met a few months later, at the Aarhus Open House in May 1973; it was there that I aroused Bill's anger by presuming to give a talk about John Conway's theory of numbers and games, which Bill thought (wrongly) to be antithetical to his very strong political views. But the storm passed, and Bill remained a staunch supporter of my work (though I could always rely on him for frank criticism of any imperfections in it).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;When, in September 2004, Jiri Adamek suggested to a group of senior category-theorists that there was a need for a \\`steering committee' to ensure the continued smooth running of international CT conferences, there was lengthy discussion about almost every aspect of his proposal; but one thing which nobody queried was his suggestion that Bill should be invited to chair the committee. Happily, Bill accepted the invitation (on condition that I should agree to be the secretary), and he provided us with wise and thoughtful guidance until he stepped down in 2010.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The organizers of the 2007 CT meeting in Carvoeiro decided to make the celebration of Bill's 70th birthday a theme of the conference, and they invited me to give a laudatory talk summarizing Bill's mathematical achievements. It was an invitation I accepted with considerable trepidation, and even 24 hours before the talk was due I was unsure how I was going to do justice to all aspects of Bill's work. But in the event it went well, and Bill approved of it; he was particularly amused that I'd included a quote from Karl Marx on one of my slides (he thought, incorrectly, that I hadn't been aware of its source).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;But there's no need for me to recall anything I said in that talk; Bill himself did the job of summarizing his work much better, in an interview with the Coimbra mathematicians which is available online. Reading it again today, I'm struck once more by the extraordinary mathematical mind of a man I've been privileged to know for almost fifty years. RIP Bill; we'll all miss you.",

        "text": "Hello mathematicians of reddit\n\nI am currently working on my bachelors in biochemistry and am currently taking linear analysis and will be taking calculus 4 next term. \n\nTo say it's been a struggle is an understatement, especially considering I suffer from a pretty hefty case of dyscalculia. \n\nI'm hoping someone in here who practices more advanced mathematics who also suffers from this has come up with any methods to help keep things straight without having to essentially do the problem a million times to make sure I've kept things straight. \n\nI try color coding, but since there's way more functions and, well, numbers than there are colors, this falls short. Plus it only helps so much with the immediate visual confusion that comes with reading the problems. \n\nI realize linear algebra is probably not what this community would consider \"advanced\" but it is for me and I wanted to give an idea of what level I'm working at. \n\nI appreciate any and all recommendations, just don't tell me I'm hopeless because I already so often feel that way.",

But is there a recommended (preferably) free resource to like...re-learn math again? Almost like a start to finish for maybe a high school curriculum? I'd like to attempt calculus again someday I dunno. Maybe it's a futile effort. I just have always been so envious of people who were good at math.

If we remove any such set of edges from K_4, the resulting graph is 2 colourable. Similarly, we can split up k_6 in 5 disjunct sets of edges and so that removing one set results in a 4 colorable graph. \n\nMy conjecture is the following : Let G = (V,E) have chromatic number n, and let there be a way to split E into n-1 (disjunct?) sets, so that removing any such set from G  results in a n-2 colorable graph. Then G  has the complete graph K_n as  subgraph and n must be even.",

I often see authors in textbooks claim that a proof is 'trivial' or 'easy', and usually such a statement is more or less justified. However, it seems uncommon for any results with 'hard' proofs to appear in textbooks, so I'm wondering where the distinction between an ordinary proof and a hard proof lies. The only example I can think of where a result is explicitly called hard is the Prime Number Theorem, but I haven't seen any textbooks which tackle this theorem, though that could be because I haven't looked at any textbooks in analytic number theory. \nSpecifically, I'm looking for hard results that could or have explicitly been published in textbooks and described as hard, but if there's a paper with a hard proof you can think of, that'd also be cool to hear about.",
