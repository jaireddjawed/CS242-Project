I use an inverter to produce the 120VAC used by the heater element. I did some experiments using a house lighting dimmer rated for 800W that I adjusted so that draw was around 430W from the inverter as measured by a Kill-a-Watt, but it got pretty hot and I had to use fan cooling to get the dimmer temp down to around 90°F. My question why that happened got deleted over on r/AskElectronics, so I did some digging and it appears that even though I was limiting throughput to around 430W on the 800W rated dimmer, I really need a dimmer rated for the full 1,400W that the heater element is designed to draw. I see plenty of inexpensive dimmers on ebay rated for 2kW and up, any reason why one of those wouldn't work?",

Here are my questions:\n\n1. Do they make dial gauges that can convert a DC voltage into a given needle deflection?  (Obviously this is what a voltmeter does, but do they sell something like this for general purpose use?)  Mostly what I have seen online have been pressure gauges or distance measuring gauges rather than something taking an electrical input.\n2. Does anyone have any recommendations for sources?  Salvage is okay, but new would be preferred.\n3. What's the best way to go about coming up with a customized scale?  I guess with some cheaper designs you could just replace the labels with your own cutout or else have a lookup table to convert the gauge scale to the scale of the thing you're trying to measure.",

Air fryers are reportedly more energy efficient because they heat a smaller space and use a higher fan speed.\n\nQuestion - How could you improve the efficiency of an existing electric oven?\n\nMy thoughts turned to decreasing the volume of air that needed to be heated. A 'brick' with a low thermal conductivity and resistant upto 300 Celsius. If it resembled Swiss cheese it would have a smaller impact on the oven's airflow but perhaps then we're into the realms of 3D printing.\n\nThoughts?\n\nI couldn't find any similar product so either it's a terrible idea or I've just ruined a patent!",

That is not a convention we use. And to my knowledge, the amplitude and shape of the wave denote the timbre and intensity of the pitch.\n\nI thought about it for ahwile, and I thought perhaps by measuring the angle of the peak of an ideal wave, you could derive frequency.

        "text": "I’m currently working on a personal project of creating a customize AUX cable used with motorcycle intercoms and cellphones. The gist of this project is to basically use motorcycle intercoms as communication devices for virtual tours &amp; meetings. Basically those online and those in person will have the opportunity to hear &amp; communicate with the tour guide via the intercoms with the phone connected to Zoom or some other conferencing app.\n\nThe intercom is connected to the phone with the aux cable and basically, the intercom’s audio is transmitted to the phone (online people can hear the intercom audio), and the phone’s audio is transmitted into the intercom (online people can talk and tour guide can hear what online people are saying).\n\nI’m creating a customized AUX cable for that matter by using a cut piece of apple headphones &amp; cut piece of the intercom earpiece. Here’s what I’ve got so far:\n\n**The grounds of both the Apple Headphones &amp; intercom are connected -- No problem.**\n\n**The apple headphones microphone is connected with the intercom audio wires -- no problem \\[Blue box\\]**\n\n**The apple headphones' audio is connected with the intercom microphone wires -- Echo/Feedback! \\[Brown Box\\]**\n\nThe diagram below self explains what I do. I’ve also attached a photo of what I mean by connecting the wires.\n\n[Diagram](https://imgur.com/a/tJ50etO)\n\n[Wire Connections](https://ibb.co/z5ZZ25H)\n\nI’m wondering if there’s a specific component that can eliminate the feedback to provide a clean sound when I connect the apple audio with the intercom microphone wire. But I’m not sure what to look into. Possibly a resistor or potentiometer, but I’m not sure of the physics behind those components to produce non-feedback sound. Any suggestions are extremely helpful!",

When the pump reaches its maximum pressure and the 2in cylinder is out of power a valve would direct pressure to the 6in cylinder. As you break through the obstruction and pressure drops the valve reverts back to the 2in cylinder and the 6in vents to drain retracting it for next time. Thoughts?\n\nI’ve seen double ended cylinders but never like this. Any thoughts?",

The basic idea is to treat the present crisis as particularly acute right now and to assume that there will be more time and more resources for planning for next winter and beyond.\n\nThe focus this winter will be on heating individual residences, including both usable free-standing small houses and also owned apartment flats.  The size of the houses and flats range from 500 to 800 square feet.  Electricity is generally not available now, but will be available later, but often only intermittently. Common forms of traditional fuel are available, but gas will be propane in most areas for the next several months.\n\nWhat type of adequate heating is available for $500 USD per living unit?  For $1,000 per unit?  These are wholesale prices and include the cost of installation. \n\nHere is an article, from an unrelated nonprofit, that provides background on heating issues in Ukraine.\n\nhttp://www.coldathome.today/cold-at-home",
