        "text": "So recently I just got hired at Chuck E Cheese as an overnight security guard.  I always liked the idea of being a night guard at a mall or any other establishment.  I had my first night yesterday and I have to be honest, I was kind of spooked.  I work at the Chuck E Cheese that still has the animatronics that perform shows. I liked those as a kid. I really liked them as a kid but at night they kinda are a little creepy all turned off.  My shift started at midnight and I bid the last guy goodnight and I worked till 6. really good pay 18 bucks an hour so I made a little over $100 last night. But I'm starting to think something is a little off.  I'll let you guys be the judge of it.\n\nMy shift started off with telling the last security guard Scott goodnight and I clocked in. the first hour was quiet. I spent most of my time in the security office looking at the cameras. It was kinda fun at first because there isn't a camera itself in the security office. Only right outside. So I kinda just glanced every so often at the cameras while I checked my socials, watch videos, and scroll through reddit. I mean who would want to rob a little kid's party place? Plus my store gets shuttered and locked at night so if someone broke in, I'd definitely hear it and see it.  \n\nBut now here is where the weird stuff happened I heard a loud scraping noise. Like metal on metal scraping noise and it was LOUD.  My hair stood on end when I heard it and I looked at the cameras to the front entrance and the back entrance and nothing looked broken into at all.  I was pretty scared and I was thinking of just hiding in that small office. But then what security guard would I be if I hid from a break in?  I got the courage to grab my flashlight and a taser that the company provided me for any intruders if there was a break in.  \n\nWhen I walked out into the party room I went straight to the front entrance really slowly and quietly while calling out that I was armed and that if someone was in the store they can show themselves and no one would get hurt.  I got no response.\n\nI heard the loud scraping noise again and it made me almost jump out of my skin. I heard it from behind me so I spun around and shown my flashlight at where I heard the noise and the stage housing the animatronics was lit dimly with my flashlight. Then I noticed it. That purple character on the drums. Munch I think he's called? Apparently the animatronic looked like it moved its arms like it was going to play on its drums like it does during one of the shows. It was a little creepy because it looked like its arms were up but it's dull plastic green eyes were locked on me.  Then it happened again. The loud scraping noise and the arms of the animatronic moved very quickly but then stopped and the character's eyes where mid blink mouth slightly open. \n\nI decided to go a little closer to investigate the stage because the manager did tell me that the master controls for the characters where located beneath the stage and I thought maybe the maintenance crew didn't fully turn it all off. \n\nThen I noticed this horrible smell when I got close to the stage. I thought it maybe the rug but Scott told me the rug was cleaned last night. so maybe it was just some leftover food somewhere that went bad.  I plugged my nose and opened up the control board and it looked like all of the switches seemed to be turned off.   I decided I'll just turn Munch on and off to see if that would do anything so I did a very quick flick and flick and then Munch's arms went all the way up and slammed down on his drums and I don't think I let him continue his cycle because he was in his off posistion but his eyes where staring straight down at me.  \n\nAt that point I just could not handle that smell so I decided to head back the office with a little haste in my step because I was kinda creeped out.  The rest of the night was quiet until my quitting time at 6 when I went to clock out I heard the scraping noise again but when I turned around it was from that bird. It seemed to have turned its head straight at the entrance while I was about to leave. I quickly locked the door, went to my car and sped on home. I filed to the manager some malfunctions with the animatronics and a weird smell but I haven't got anything back. \n\nShould I quit? Something seemed a little off last night. If I do stay I will keep you guys posted.",

        "text": "[part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11a6o42/i_made_a_deal_and_now_i_cant_leave_this_nursing/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n don't remember making my previous post. By the time I woke up that morning, I felt blissfully unaware. It was perhaps one of the best nights of sleep I’ve ever had. I got out of bed and went about my usual routine. My computer was open on my desk and when I went to close it, I saw my post. I know I wrote it, of course. But it's as if I'm hearing someone tell me the embarrassing things I did during a drunken stupor. It's believable but doesn't really make sense. I don’t feel the same sense of urgency that I did when I made that post. It was as if there was something else I feared besides just losing my memory after waking up. \n\nI did remember the raise though. But not quite how I depicted it previously. In my current state of mind, I stood in Robert’s office while he expressed condolences for working me too hard and it was him that offered to pay me double to get me to stay. I guess I will have to wait till my next paycheck to see if he was lying or not. A few of you were right about it being a good thing. If this raise is real, I could certainly use it. \n\nI used that motivation to return to work. I was very careful to continue business as usual without talking with anyone any more than I usually did. I’m still the grunt worker in the kitchen. Just yesterday Lorraine demanded that I push the IL cart again and I did so without complaint. It has been a year and some change since the deal was made, and a little more than two weeks since I “received a raise”. I use quotations for the ambiguity of whether I actually got a raise and the two conflicting accounts of how I got it in the first place. \n\nThe usual residents were sitting in the courtyard smoking. I passed by them without a single hitch of breath. For all intents and purposes, it seems as if my asthma has completely disappeared. For giggles, I made my way back to the kitchen through the chapel. Nothing was amiss. No loitering spirits, no mysterious stains on the floor, no eyeless men. Part of me wished to sit in the pews to try to prod my missing memories, but we were right in the middle of service. Upon my reentrance to the kitchen, Lorraine clapped me on the shoulder with her bony hand and pushed me towards the prep counter beside the dessert station. \n\n“They can handle the rest of the service,” She commented, although I could see the fear in Edith’s eyes as I was delegated to start refilling the sandwich platters. It was as if Edith lived to prove Lorraine wrong because not even five minutes later, Edith was caught halving the portions of lasagna to make it stretch through the rest of the service. Instead of a square of lasagna, residents were starting to get small rectangles that equated to maybe two bites. I watched Lorraine tear into Edith until she was suitably chastised. Safe to assume Edith would overcorrect and end up wasting pounds of food over the next few days. \n\n\"Shit like that makes me want to quit,\" I spoke to Lorraine, rubbing egg salad onto a slice of bread when she returned to the prep counter. \"Residents pay to be here and we can barely feed 'em.\" \n\nLorraine scoffed, nodding her head in agreement. \"It's a damn shame. But you won't quit over it.\"\n\n\"Wha-\" I sputtered indignantly. \"I could quit.\" \n\nLooking over at me, her eyes trailed me up and down before shaking her head. \"You've been here for two years now. You ain't gonna throw all that away over a few plates of food. That'd be like me quitin' over the shipment not coming in on time.\"\n\n\"You're comparing apples and oranges,\" I grumbled, cutting each sandwich into triangles. But she was right. I had been here two years already and was promised an astonishing raise. There was no way I was leaving anytime soon.  \n\n\"Both have seeds,\" Lorraine commented slyly before stepping up to the serving line and giving Edith a scathing talking-to about also running out of mashed potatoes with only 10 residents left to serve. For those of you who don't know, mashed potatoes make up 25% of the elderly diet in a nursing home. And whenever she could, Miss Lorraine would make them by hand. But in a pinch, we had an instant mix that she spiced up the old southern-mama way that made it so you couldn't tell the difference. Two years was nothing compared to the literal decades Lorraine worked in this kitchen, though. \n\nThis brings me to the reason for this update post…A few of you mentioned previously that you think I had made a deal with the Devil. I’m not sure how willing I am to believe that. To be honest, if it weren’t for the stubborn residents haunting the joint, I wouldn’t mind assuming the events of that night to be completely in my imagination. One has to choose how much they’re willing to compromise their interpretation of the world before just accepting everything as fact. Besides, what would the Devil be doing in a run-down nursing home like River Down anyway? If I were the SOB I’d feel much better skulking around the fancier joint across the highway. \n\nIt’s not like I can ask my co-workers about this. We’ve just migrated passed the point where they would put dirty knives in the dishwater instead of in the knife basket. I can’t just walk up to them and ask “Hey have you ever seen an extremely disfigured man offering to make a deal with you?” Hell, we don’t even talk about the lingering spirits with each other. I remember the first time I came across one of the unwelcome guests too. It was way back when my mother still worked here. \n\nElbow-deep in dirty pans from breakfast, I was surprised to hear the sound of a ringing bell. It wasn't a doorbell, mind you. But one of those rapid, hissing alarm bells. I was completely alone in the kitchen and I never heard it before, so I flinched and turned around quickly, splashing dirty water everywhere in the process. The scene I saw at the large door that led to the memory care dining room horrified me. I felt a scream on the back of my tongue but was somehow too frozen to move. \n\nThere sat what looked like a man in a wheelchair which wasn't an uncommon sight for a nursing home, but the condition of the man was horrid. He was thin as a bone, skin hanging off of his skeleton like curtains. His hair was long but patchy and unkempt. White stands almost chest length obscuring his face. His body was twisted like a contortionist in the small wheelchair. His knees folded up unusually, looking like dried-out roots rather than legs. And for a moment I had the absurd thought of how he managed to get to the door if he couldn't push himself and didn't look able to use his twisted feet. \n\nCautiously, I wiped off my hands and shuffled over to the man. He looked even worse than I thought up close. His hands were thin as a bone, nails long and unkempt. He smelled like a mixture of piss and rubbing alcohol. It almost made me gag. \n\n\"Sir? Can I help you? Do you need me to get a nurse?\" I asked trying to be nice. Part of me was worried I would get fired for being rude to him, but I had no idea why he was at the door.\n\n\"Cigarette.\" He groaned in a tone more accurately described as a rattle. As if his lips barely moving formed the words while air just so happened to escape his lungs. \n\n\"Excuse me?\" I asked, not because I didn't hear or understand, but because I was taken aback by the blunt demand. \n\n\"Cigarette!\" He said louder, this time notably angrier. His head didn't lift from where it was resting on his shoulder. Merely, he looked up at me with dark eyes through his strands of hair. I was nervous at his volume in the same way a child would be at their parents when they were doing something they weren't supposed to. Part of me held out home a nurse would shuffle by and take him back to his room, although I knew they wouldn't. They weren't supposed to leave the memory care halls. \n\n\"I'm sorry, sir. I don't have any cigarettes.\"\n\nBut then his head tilted back to rest against the rest of the wheelchair and he started screaming. The sound was haunting. No emotion is conveyed through the vibrations. I couldn't tell if he was angry or sad. I almost thought he sounded in pain. In a rush, I fled back into the kitchen. No way could I stand back at the sinks with him just a few yards away. And getting the other staff was out of the question with all the cigarette smoke bound to be in the air. I was stuck. It’s cowardly, I admit, but I ended up hiding in the pantry until the screams petered off. When I stepped back into the dishwashing area, the man was gone. My heart was going crazy in my chest. With a wheeze, I returned to my dishes, hoping to remember to bring my inhaler the next day.\n\nI mentioned the man to my mother when she and the rest of the staff came in from their smoke break only for her to wave me off. \"Residents make their way from memory care all the time,\" she told me. \"Most want a cup of coffee and will wheel themselves back.\"\n\nIt was only later when I started pushing the carts down the halls that I saw him again. He sat in his wheelchair rolling down the hall. His hands didn’t turn the wheels, nor did his leg unwind to start kicking himself. But his chair rolled on. I stopped to watch for a few minutes, wary of him seeing me. But between one blink and the next, he was gone. Unwilling to believe in the supernatural phenomena, I pulled the cart down the hall and went to ask a nurse if he made it back to his room alright.\n\nThe nurse gave me a strange look before jogging over to the recreation area that the residents sat in before mealtimes. \n\n“We’re all accounted for and I haven’t seen anyone leave since the residents sat down…” She informed me. Before I asked any more questions, she started unloading trays and I took that as my cue to leave. But I digress. \n\nEven if the deal I made wasn’t to the Devil himself. He does have power. I need to tread carefully. \n\nI don’t know what I gave in return for my lack of asthma. If the modern media is to be believed, I gave my immortal soul. \n\nI said, “I made a deal and now I can’t leave.” in my previous post. I assume that was because Mr. Deal-Maker might try to collect on my end of the bargain if I up and put in my two-week notice. There is a small possibility that my other co-workers have made similar deals. I think, at the very least, Wanda had a deal. I mentioned previously that Wanda had told me about her own health issues when she noticed my improved health. She confided she had issues with her heart on and off when she was younger. I also mentioned that she was now dead. \n\nA few months ago now, Wanda was found in her home having died from a heart attack. Of course, she wasn’t that young and she had preexisting heart issues, but I’m working off the case that health issues = deal. Everyone else in the kitchen is an avid smoker and much older than I am, so there’s no telling what kind of health issues they might have. It wouldn’t be hard to find one to exploit, I feel. I really hope I’m not Lorraine’s age with suds up to my elbows and still working here. I might just wish for Mr. Deal-Maker to take my soul at that point. \n\nBut I will keep my ear to the ground regarding deals made and try to subtly prod my coworkers about what they know. If my immortal soul isn’t harvested, I’ll post an update when I can/if I find anything. \n\nUntil next time, I guess.",

I somehow didn't get effected in the memory wipe process but I think that's because i covered my eyes. i think the reason he didn't notice was because he happened to be looking at my friend who was a few feet away from me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nwhile he was telling the story i acted as though i was effected. (i see its worth mentioning the reason my friend didnt close his eyes is because the man did it too quick for my slow friend to react.) they left and replaced the doors with some sort of time gun that reverses the destruction. i told my friend about it multiple times but he doesnt beleive me. \n\ni personally think the reason they knew my location is either they knew activity was happening or they noticed my phone call was about mysterious action that needed to be contained.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthe men in black are real.",

        "text": "I knew my day was going too well. This morning I finally fixed my piece of shit Toyota Landcruiser. An electrical issue with the fuel pump had rendered the Landcruiser undriveable for the last six months. With the issue finally sorted I was pumped to take it for an adventure through some of my favourite off-road tracks. I quickly loaded a few supplies in the Cruiser and headed off.\n\nEverything was going well until I took that Wrong Turn. This wasn't my first time driving these tracks, I had been coming here for years now, but today was the first time I saw THAT track. It took me about five minutes to realise I had taken a Wrong Turn and was on a track I had never driven. I didn't stress, if I pushed on I was confident the track would eventually link up with one of the main tracks I would be familiar with. Feeling adventurous I decided I'd push on, excited to drive a new track and see what challenges I might find. I bit off more than I could chew. After half an hour, some tough hills and a lot of mud, I was stuck. Bogged down to the chassis rails, my recently fixed Toyota sunk into the mud. Without a winch there was no way I’d be recovering the car myself.\n\nUnsurprisingly being deep in the middle of the bush my phone showed no signal. I grabbed my keys out of the Landcruiser and decided to walk further up the track and hopefully find some phone signal or even better another car. \n\nAfter fifteen minutes of walking and no phone signal, I saw something up ahead in the middle of the track. Once I got closer I realised it was a backpack. I yelled out, hoping whoever owned the backpack was still nearby. I was met with nothing more than the occasional bird call. Hoping to find something useful, I decided to have a look through the backpack. Who knows, I could have got lucky and found a satellite phone? I found a couple of chocolate bars, a bottle of water and a well used notepad and pen. As I sat down on a log to enjoy my newfound chocolates (dont judge me, after having not eaten since breakfast I was starving) I flicked through the person's notepad. The notepad was full of a few hand drawn sketches of the local flora, but as I kept flicking through the pages I came to an erratically written diary entry. Some of the writing was illegible, but I managed to work it out. I will write for you word for word what I found in that diary entry.\n\n**“It’s about 8am, almost 24 hours since I got lost in this forest. I just spent the night from hell hiding up a tree. I got lost some time around midday yesterday, I can't recall the exact moment I realised I didn't know where I was… but of course my phone went flat so I can’t use my maps, pretty sure I've been walking in circles.**\n\n**It hadn't long been sunset and I managed to get a pretty good fire going. I figured if they’d come looking for me a nice big fire would stand out in the darkness, a beacon of hope. Unfortunately the beacon of hope turned out to be the beacon of nightmares. I knew something was off when the bush went quiet.. No bugs chirping, no birds nesting in for the night, hell even the mosquitos disappeared. Then I heard it, it sounded so close but at the same time so distant. Clicks and whistles, almost like the sound of a dolphin, but somehow insinuating malevolence and dark intent. First it came from my left, then almost instantaneously from my right. Not going to lie, I freaked out. I clicked on my flashlight and pointed it into the dense shrubbery. Nothing, and I mean NOTHING. Dead silence met complete stillness. So silent all I could hear was a minute ringing in my ears. The whole world suspended, as if someone pressed pause on the Earth. I sat back down and that's when I saw it for the first time. As I sat down and looked up I saw an outline of a large humanoid shape across from the fire, I pointed the flashlight at it and caught a glimpse of a black shadow, possibly human but bigger. Maybe 7ft tall? Human like in stature, but it moved like a house cat. I saw it for a split second, followed by the sound of sticks snapping and shrubs being pushed down. I was shell shocked, unable to move.**\n\n**After what felt like an eternity I realised the forest had returned to life. The birds were squawking as they settled in for the night, the crickets were again chirping and the not so friendly mosquitos had returned to bite at my neck. The foreboding feeling now gone, I walked over to where I had seen what must have been a trick of the light. I thought that until I reached the tree that the shadow had hidden behind. What I can only describe as axe wounds covered the tree. Gashes torn through the bark and trunk as if it was made of gelatin. I could clearly see the direction the shadow had run off, branches as thick as my wrist snapped clean off and dense bushes ploughed through. Anxiety began to set in, could this be real? I knew there had to be a logical way to explain this.**\n\n**As I stood there in denial of what I was experiencing, I noticed the silence had again returned. That uncomfortable stillness. Foreboding malevolence drenched over me.  I ran to the perceived safety of my fire, the light produced fending off any would be monsters. As I skittishly looked around I heard it again, this time directly in front of me, clicking and whistling, moving from left to right. I jerked my torch to the treeline. As soon as my torch hit the shadows I heard a twig snap behind me. Hastily spinning around I saw it, standing directly behind me, perfectly blending into the shadow cast by my fire. As I spun I lifted my torch in its direction to which I was met with an ear piercing shrill, so loud I keeled to the ground. I felt my ears ringing and my head aching. A pressure built behind my eyes so great I started to see dots. Darkness clouded my vision. As I regathered my sensors I noticed the creature had gone. Gone, but I could sense it was close. Again I could hear distant clicking and whistling, moving 360 degrees all around me. I started to feel disorientated, nauseous. I lost my balance a few times as I darted around, unsure what to do and how to defend myself from this unknown creature in the dark. I knew I stood no chance taking it on head to head. It was clearly much faster and stronger than any human I had ever seen, not to mention it towered over me, at least a foot taller. Panic setting in, I climbed up the closest tree. Seeking refuge from the terrors stalking in the darkness.** \n\n**For the next few hours I was met with clicks and whistles from all directions. My fire having since burned out and my torch starved of batteries, I was engrossed by the black of night. I could sense the creature coming and going, fairly certain it was toying with me. Exhaustion took over and I eventually fell asleep, I don't know for how long, minutes, an hour maybe? Who knows. But I awoke to that all too familiar shrill, the tree I had claimed as my makeshift stronghold shook and creaked. I jerked to alertness, nearly falling out of the tree as I did so. Loud scraps came from below, paired with a taunting squeal. The tree shook and swayed as I clung on for my life. As my grip started to fatigue, convinced I was about to fall to my death, I realised the tree had ceased moving and an unnerving silence had returned.  I noticed hints of orange on the horizon, the sun daring to peek over the distant hills. The sounds of the forest returned, greeting me with the start of a new day. Had the creature gone? Was it nocturnal, forced to seek shelter from the sun's rays?** \n\n**Once I worked up the courage I climbed down from the tree. The tree's thick trunk now covered in deep long scars. I collected my backpack and ran. I just ran until I collapsed from exhaustion. I am now lost deeper in this forest, but the sun is up and I think I am safe. I am going to walk as far as I can today and hopefully find my way out of this haunted scrub land. If not, at least walk far enough that I leave that beast behind.”**\n\nI took in a deep breath. Was what I just read real? Or was this the manuscript of a crazed bush walker? No way could this have happened. Furthermore, where was this person now? Why was their backpack left in the middle of the track?\n\nI looked up at the sky, the sun dropping behind the distant hills, taking its leave of absence for the night. I had to make a choice, push on and try to find rescue or seek shelter for the night in my broken down Landcruiser. My nerves got the best of me, as I turned around and headed back to the sanctuary of my old Toyota. Climbing in and locking the doors, I have now decided to bunk down for the night. Questions run through my mind.  Am I in the creature's territory? Has it seen me? Will the thin glass and steel surrounding me be enough of a deterrent? Will I make it to morning? Will I Die Tonight?",

On my turn I, without hesitation, picked dare. I would later regret this decision. Jay (the main guy) dared me to record a video of myself playing a ouija board alone at midnight. I immediately shot down the idea but the group insisted I do it. Jay and the others said things to me like: \"If you don't do it then your a damn coward\", \"Fuck you then\", \"I thought we were friends\", \"It's just a game shithead\". I really didn't want to do it but along with the verbal abuse, they also threatened to kick me out of the friend group for not playing along and being a stick in the mud. My best counter-argument was that no one I knew owns that kind of board but, after a lot of convincing I finally caved in. We set a date, bought a ouija board online (kinda hard to find where I live), and they made a pact to force me, by any means necessary, to do the dare.\n\nIn retrospect that friend group was just really toxic, the dynamic was that I was the butt of the joke, and Jay and another guy always gave me a hard time. They would swear at me, call me bobo (idiot) in front of people, peer pressure me, and make me do things that they knew were stupid or dangerous. While there were two bullies, there was also an enabler who would always pursuade me to do whatever nonsense they come up with. At the time, it seemed like I was enjoying it. Looking back now, it was just torment. I was very naive at the time, and despite of the things they would do and say to me I continued to tolerate them because they were my only relationship outside of family.\n\nContext aside, the day finally came when the ouija board arrived. It was roughly a week since we decided on it. At school, when my friend group found out that it had arrived they made me do it that night. Of course I resisted since that wasn't part of the deal, but I was powerless against them. The other bully even said he'll beat me up if I chickened out. That's when I realized that I was stuck in a bad social position. For the rest of the day I was anxious and wanted to die because it was when I realized how toxic it had gotten. I can't empasize enough how much I'm against the ouija board dare but I can't get out of it now. The time came, 11:40-ish pm. I announced to the group chat that everything was ready. After a quick call with Jay and the enabler, I turned off my phone and set it on a stand to record. I wish I just lied and said my mom didn't agree to buy the board game, but its too late now. Even if I had lied, Jay would have the resources to buy a ouija board himself. The clock strikes midnight. I press record. I then ask the first question; Is there a spirit I can communicate with?. ...H-I. My heart starts racing. I'm completely alone in the dark, there is absolutely no way that pointer thing just moved on its own. I promise my life that I didn't move it but it still moved. I was really, really, really frightened but I had to continue. I then began to stammer as I was asking the next question; Are you good? ...No. That was my breaking point, I quickly let go of the pointer and stepped away. My eyes started to water out of fear. I then notice that the pointer was moving again. K-I-L-L-F-R-I-E-N-D-S.\n\nWhat the FUCK does that mean I screamed \"NO, don't murder them.\" After that my phone got flung across that room, at this point I turned the lights on and begged at my parents door to let me in. I knew I would get scolded but that was better than death. My mom said \"What are you doing? What was that loud noise?\" I quickly shuffled inside and locked the door. I told my parents everything. As expected they didn't like it, even though they bought me the board all they knew was that it was a board game not a gateway to hell. My dad told me to calm down. Once I settled down my mom went outside to fix the mess while dad told me how stupid this was. I didn't mention that it was my friends idea because if they learned that I was a snitch they would think up of much worse punishment. My mom return with the remains of my phone. It was kinda functional but not really. It was just cracked-blackscreen-thin-brick. So... I failed my mission, there would be no evidence of what happened until I get my phone fixed. Even then there would be no guarantee that the file is saved.\n\nThat night I had to sleep in my parents room, on the floor. I was paranoid the entire time but I did eventually fell asleep. I never got to say goodbye to the spirit, so guess what happened next... IT HAUNTED MY DREAM. In the dream there was a rectangular mirror with a black outline that was illuminated by red light. An arm reached out and rest of the body followed. It was a young adult male with cut wrists and gashed neck. His white polo shirt and jeans were soaked in blood. After he made his appearance I woke up. As I opened my eyes I hear a male voice scream loudly into my ear: \"PEOPLE LIKE HIM IS THE REASON I'M DEAD!\" I jump out of bed. I notice tears running down my eyes, it seemed like I was crying in my sleep. I'm beyond terrified at this point. I try to ignore it, just bury the feelings. Aside from being scolded the next notatble event happened at school\n\nI obviously expected to get beat up, or cursed at, or kicked out of the friend group. But when Jay and the others walked up to me they asked me in a sarcastic way \"So, how was your night?\" I saw blood trickled down the other bully's eye, the enabler got tossed across the classroom, and a cut slowly opened on the side of Jay's neck. So much blood was on me and Jay. The other bully was collapsed on the ground. A teacher came through the door way to see what's going on then she exploded into a flesh pile. Then a horrible sound screached at my ear, a demonic tone that sounded like metal scraping at each other. The demonic voice said a vague line \"CHOOSE IF THEY WILL DIE.\" The vision stopped and everything went back to normal, no one's dead or bleeding. Apparently I was just staring blankly into space. After the hallucination thing I quickly ran out the room and tried to digest what I just saw. The demon I contacted last night wants to kill my bad friends. How do I stop that from happening? The best idea that came to mind was just try and communicate that I don't want them dead, I can do that with the ouija board but I don't have access to it anymore. In the end I just shrugged it off, I tried to just speak in an empty room that I don't want them dead hopefully the ghost/demon guy heard it. I really don't know. It was an experience I wish had never happened to me but I guess I can't change the past.\n\nFYI: I'm 17 now and I'm doing much better and I'm much happier, no paranormal encounters, no bad friend group, no corpses caused by my hand. Everything is good but sometimes I feel a really strong urge to cut, I think that's just residue from the suicidal ghost guy.",

        "text": "I come to this sub to explain my situation. First time, but warranted. \n\nI will try and be as calm and collected as I can, despite what has happened to bring me here. \n\nI am Cy, (26). Erica, my long term gf, who will appear in this post is (21).\n\nWe had been dating for 3 years, and had just discussed moving in together. I was very happy that Erica wanted to take this step, and readily agreed. She had me move in with her, as my apartment was way more crappy than her house, which her parents had helped her buy. It was small, 1 bedroom with 1.5 bathrooms, but in a nice part of town and close to her work. My lease ended in a month, so I didn’t move in until then. \nWhen that day came, I moved my few possessions in my beat up car. I terribly poor, but money was tight. And I was frugal. Erica’s parents were wealthy business professionals that had their company take off, doting on their only child. They also seemed to really like me too, they’d welcomed me into their family like I was their own. So basically my life was looking up. I was so happy to move in with the love of my life, and take this step like I said. Erica came out when she saw me pull up and helped me carry stuff in. Her place was about a 40 minute drive from mine. Once everything was in, she made tea and I sat with her. We talked about how happy we were with this and just general small talk. \n\nFast forward to that evening: \nWe went out for dinner and then came home and watched tv. Erica had work in the morning, I was off. It was Saturday, I had Sat/Sun off, but Erica worked Sundays. Today was her last day off. We sat and watched some Tv, then started to head to bed. I slept on the couch, she slept in the bedroom, we weren’t quite ready to sleep together yet. \nOkay, so day 1 was fine. \n\n(Sunday) The next morning, Erica and me had coffee together. Then she left for work. I heard the mail come soon after (I guess it’s super early here) so I went out and checked. The elderly neighbor on the left came out at the same time. \n“How are you Cy? Are you staying over with Erica?” \n\nI smiled. This was Mrs.Latefield. I had meet her once or twice before when I had visited Erica at her place. She was a nice old woman, everything you’d expect of a widowed cat lady. \n“I am actually moved in with her as of yesterday.” I told her happily. \nShe smiled, but it caught me off because she looked nervous all of a sudden. \n“Well I am happy for you of course Cy, but Erica hasn’t seemed like herself lately. She hasn’t been by in weeks and just seems distant, to me anyways. Be careful okay.” \n\nWith this she turns and walks into her house. \nWhat’s that supposed to mean? I shrug and head back inside, but with a feint kind of with a creepy feeling that lingered. \n\nAfter spending the day finishing up with my stuff, Erica gets home. She brought carry-out for dinner. She seemed a bit tired, but still smiling and happy when we sat down together. After our usual small talk about the day, I brought Mrs.Latefield up. \n\n“So babe, I talked to our neighbor this morning at the mailbox, she says you haven’t come by in a bit and seemed concerned.”\n\nErica: “Oh, I was by twice in the last 2 weeks, I brought her her tea from the store as well as new cat food. She must have just forgotten in old age.” \n\nHuh, seems reasonable I guess. \nAfter that we just went back to normal conversation and watched tv again cuddled up together. Then I bedded myself down on the couch once Erica had left for her room. I had work the next morning and needed sleep. \n\nAnd I did sleep, until about 1. \nThat’s when I heard something like footsteps. I sat up, waited, then heard them again. With the sound of a door closing. I got up and looked down the hall. The bathroom light was on. It was just Erica. I heard the sink a minute later. \n\nI went back to bed, the neighbors warning had put me on edge. I half laughed at myself for being so keyed up in my own love’s house. \n\n(Monday) \nI headed out for work, Erica would leave a bit later. I worked as manager for a fast-casual place. As I entered I was greeted by my 2nd in command and best friend Andres. We had been working together at this restaurant for a little over a year now, he’s one of the only faces that stuck around. \n\n“Hey, how are things Cy?”\nHe always is slightly loud, it comes from his enthusiasm and energy. So sweet though. \n\n“Pretty good, moved in with Eric a couple days ago.” I say in a slightly quieter voice. \n(Eric is what I call Erica.) \n\n“Hey, that’s great! Her house is on 7th right?” \n\nI nod.\n\nAndres face darkens a bit. \n\n“Look Cy, I don’t know if you’ve heard, but there’s been 4 murders in your area, one was identified as a young woman, the others are haven’t been released, but all have horribly mutilated. The police haven’t found the suspect(s) and I just want you and Eric to be safe okay? What ever crazy is out there may still be in the area. Yenno?” \n\nI nod. I hadn’t heard any of this. Especially since the neighborhood was touted as being pretty safe. This was all strange news. I thanked Andres for telling me.\n\nI again have a creepy feeling. \n\nAfter my shift I went home. Between being manager and having extra stressful thoughts on my mind I was tired. It would be 2 hours until Erica got home. \nSo I decided to head over to Mrs.Latefield’s, despite wanting to take a nap. \n\nI knocked a couple times, then she answered. A cat was around her legs and she was holding another. She smiled upon seeing me. \n“What can I do for you Cy? Want to come in?” \n\nI nodded and managed a smile back. \n\nShe showed me to a table and chairs set and sat down. The cat by her feet at the door sat next to her, while she still had the one in her arms. \n\nI wasted no time starting with my question. \n\n“I talked to Erica, she’s says she was her twice over the last 2 weeks, brought you tea and cat food?” \n\nMrs.Latefield looked thoughtful.\n“She might of been, you know it’s getting hard for me to remember in my old age. I still don’t really recall her being here though. She might have brought me the boxes of green tea with lemon…”\n\nI could see I wasn’t really getting anywhere. \n“It’s okay, don’t press yourself. I just wanted to make sure you and Erica are at an understanding. Do you need anything as of this week?” \n\nShe now smiles.\n\n“No, I am good Cy, thank you. It’s okay about Erica too, I am sure she’s fine. I just can’t recall her bringing me anything, but don’t take it to heart okay?” \n\nI nod. Still kind of a strange situation. I don’t know what to think. She offers me tea, but I pass and head home. I decide to take a little nap on the sofa after all. Erica comes home after I had been awake for like 20 minutes. She’s seems okay. She brought food from the store home. \n\nAfter we ate we elected to go to bed, Erica invited me to sleep with her. I did, before we feel asleep I informed her about what Andres had said. She just nodded. \nToo horrible for words? Probably tired too ig. \n\nI lay awake for a bit, Erica fell right asleep. \nWhen I did sleep, I woke up at one again. \nI heard a strange but soft moan, like something in pain. I sat up. I heard it again a few minutes later and got out of bed. A cat perhaps? I walked down the hall and to the living room. \nWhat I saw shocked me so bad I was silently horrified. \n\nThere on the couch was a sprawled body of a young woman. Her face and body was drenched in blood, so much so I couldn’t ID her. She was dressed in clothes, but they were badly torn. \nLike an animal had mauled her. \nI almost couldn’t blink, but when I did I opened my eyes and she was gone. \n\nI rushed over to check the couch, but there was no blood, no disturbance, nothing. \n\nWas I just seeing things? I must have been.\nA horrible vision generated by stress and fear and worry. \n\nI went back to bed, Erica stirred a bit and asked me if I was okay. \n\nI just mumbled yeah. \nI didn’t sleep the rest of the night. \n\nI will have a post for the next day very soon, I will link the update when I am done.",

        "text": "All the quotes here are translated from Filipino\n\nMe and my very bad friend group decided to play truth or dare. I know it's a stupid game but chill, I was 15 at the time. On my turn I, without hesitation, picked dare. I would later regret this decision. Jay (the main guy) dared me to record a video of myself playing a ouija board alone at midnight. I immediately shot down the idea but the group insisted I do it. Jay and the others said things to me like: \"If you don't do it then your a damn coward\", \"Fuck you then\", \"I thought we were friends\", \"It's just a game shithead\". I really didn't want to do it but along with the verbal abuse, they also threatened to kick me out of the friend group for not playing along and being a stick in the mud. My best counter-argument was that no one I knew owns that kind of board but, after a lot of convincing I finally caved in.

They would swear at me, call me bobo (idiot) in front of people, peer pressure me, and make me do things that they knew were stupid or dangerous.

        "text": "I stared down at my pale, exsanguinated corpse; at its deflated, fractured skull. She’d left it on a slab of white rock, in the rubble-strewn belly of a quarry. As a threat? A promise? *Flirtation?* I picked through the pockets, scavenging what I could. I was so hungry; I hadn’t eaten in days. There hadn’t been anything on the last body, though I didn’t spend much time looking at t*hat one,* given the abominable state of it. Washed ashore on that absurd, nightmarish beach with its inexplicably vibrating sand, the corpse had been bloated and ugly, the mottled flesh teeming with ravenous aquatic parasites. How could I have spent more than a few moments in its unwholesome presence?  \n\nUsing a shovel I’d found in a derelict shack atop the quarry’s ridge, I dug a shallow grave and pitched the bloodless corpse inside. I didn’t want the thing being consumed by whatever carrion vermin subsisted in the dusty biome, at least not while I still roamed about the area. I was sure that sounds of tearing flesh and blood slurping would reach me, no matter how far I traveled.  \n\nOnce I had completed my sepulchral duty, I set out again, following her lingering scent: ever consistent, neither mounting nor diminishing; the artificially sweet yet also earthy tones an alluring reminder of her somewhat libertine hygiene. She bathed, but with no formal regularity. \n\n She wouldn’t have gone too far ahead, wouldn’t have utterly abandoned me in this harsh domain of her design – *this willfully induced folie à deux.* Conjured by her perverse sense of playfulness and cognomancy, she’d imprisoned me in a metaphysical mind-realm, a new level to what had been an ever-increasing yet initially harmless progression of sexual experimentation. Now, physically exhausted and mentally strained from having come across corpse after corpse, all bearing my image, I wanted only to find her and end the horror; even if it meant prematurely ending—or at least sterilizing—our intimacy. The date had gone on long enough.  \n\nI followed a winding path through low yet indescribably menacing vegetation; bushes and hedges which somehow intimated an aura of malignance; as if evil—or thoughts of such a nature—porously emanated from the flora itself. The sun—if you could call the pathetic sallow sphere hanging in the sky such a thing—barely managed to penetrate the dim umbrage of the shoulder-high shrubbery; a wan gloam, auguring not just night, but something more ominous.  \n\nEventually, I reached the next corpse: singularly crucified in a vast, moonlit desert. Despite the chill—which had arisen without my conscious notice, yet nonetheless felt at once intolerable—the corpse appeared to glow with a soft warmness. Drawing closer, I felt an actual emission of heat from its starkly naked form. \n\n Tentatively, more so out of a desire to warm myself than any want for contact, I touched the bare chest. The whole corpse then burst into flames, and I recoiled in horror at seeing the once closed eyes flash open in sightless reanimation. The jaw went slack, unhinging down to the chest, and a roar of unrelatable agony erupted from revenant’s throat. Then the corpse started to thrash about, spasmodically yet uselessly; the detaining nails solidly affixed to the perdurable wood. There was a darkly savory aroma of cooking meat, and I was reminded of the pork chops I'd had a few days prior.  \n\nI waited for it to end, sickened beyond thought. But the dead body heaved and struggled tirelessly, and the flames burned on as if the flesh were the perfect kindling; ever-replenishing or simply inexhaustible. Finally, after hours of this grisly animacy, my shock subsided, and the horror of the moment transformed into a more manageable disgust. Bracing myself against the desert’s dauting vastness and paradoxical cold, I continued my journey.  \n\nI found her in the middle of a murder. As I summited a dune, I came to find her standing over a simulacrum of me, which she’d made to kneel before her. She held a black trident overhead, poised to impale my doppelganger through his chest. My trek through the desert had ruined me, had diminished my spirit to something less than a man, and any sense of identical kinship that might’ve compelled me to come to his aid was utterly absent. The trident shone brilliantly, though my eyes couldn’t tell if the light was lunar or solar in origin.  \n\nNonplussed, I watched her drive the weapon—shaped out of some obsidian-like stone—into his body. The *crunch* of it sounded too normal, like something you’d hear during dinner. There was no auditory gravity to the penetration of the chest by that triply bladed tool. I felt nothing beyond what one might feel upon seeing one’s place of work at the start of yet another dismally monotonous day. The dread was there, but it had long ago become digestible, suppressible, nearly inert.  \n\nShe wrenched the trident free, letting the body roll away from her like a shoe she’d kicked off. It came to a stop facing me, and for a moment of exhaustion-induced disassociation, I thought that I was the one who’d been stabbed; and that it was finally time for me to rest. But her voice recalled me from that freedom-promising delirium, and I flicked my eyes up to meet hers.  \n\n“You’ve lasted so long, are you ready to finish?”  \n\nI’d been ready to finish ages ago, cycles past. Weakly, barely possessing the energy to perform the gesture, I nodded my head. The whole environment—hazily, erratically sunlit, like a madman’s deranged rendition of a summer prairie—seemed to tremble with the motions, and I stumbled a bit, even though I hadn’t moved my feet. She smiled and clapped her hands together. A breeze blew through the field, briefly lifting her sable hair and giving a greater view of her pale, lightly freckled cheeks. I saw streaks of dried tears on them and wondered if they’d been for any of the corpses, or at the idea that I’d never reach her.  \n\nI didn’t notice that I’d been teetering until I fell; she rushed to catch me just before I hit the ground. Cradled in her arms, I knew that I was safe, that my voyage through those twisted, cataclysm-wrecked realms was over. Here, in the peaceful yet nonetheless uncanny field, I would finally be allowed to finish; would finally experience what I'd been promised since first speaking with her. Carefully, still holding me with one powerful arm, she undid and discarded her bra, and I was allowed to nurse.  \n\nThere was a faint bubbling sound, which my mind knew to be the sudden and impossibly rapid decomposition of the impaled corpse, but my thoughts—if thoughts they could be even called—were totally focused on other matters. The wind threw out another breeze, helpfully carrying away any olfactory evidence of the corpse’s putrefaction. I inhaled, nasally, basking in the fragrant musk of her body; and as if on cue, I felt her hand probe downward, to do away with my tension and stress. \n\nAfterwards, we sat together on the field and watched the world unmake itself. Great pluming geysers of flame burst through the earth, sending cyclonic conflagrations across the land, incinerating plants, animals, and man-made structures indiscriminately. Dragons, or her headless, weirdly amphibian interpretations of such, were struck by golden lightning streaks mid-flight and plunged lifelessly landward, cratering the earth with their titanic bulks. Anthropophagic beast-men, gleaning some bestial sense of their imminent demise, turned on each other; devouring friend, foe, and family alike.  \n\nIt was all so absurdly chaotic and fantastical that I barely even cared. We rested in each other’s arms, limbs entangled, bodies pulsing to a single heart’s rhythm, though I couldn’t have said whose. When the sun sent a solar flare coursing through the region— perhaps refusing to be outdone in exhibitions of world-ending destruction – I was already “gone”, mentally. I had already joined her in a far-flung telepathic abysm wherein naught but our love existed. Our bodies, summarily abandoned, burned along with the Earth; drifted amidst the ashen rubble in sidereal space, innominate as ever.  \n\nBegrudgingly, I opened my eyes to the ceiling, whereon were plastered various anime and bodybuilding posters. Hello Kitty paraphernalia – some of it distinctly new -- stared at me from atop crowded shelves. The bed shuffled, and she hopped out before I could turn to her. My eyes tracked her litheness as she rounded the bed, heading into the bathroom. I felt weak, depleted, and had I not promised to meet with friends after, I probably would’ve fallen asleep. My body still somehow ached from the weeks-long exertion through the dreamscape, the eldritch experience neither entirely imaginary nor fully real, but having happened in some indefinable state betwixt the two potentialities. Flesh and spirit couldn't tell the difference. \n\nShe returned from the bathroom with a bottle of ointment. For a terror-flushed second, I suspected “the worst”, in a mundane sense. That she’d been harboring *something* and hadn’t told me. But then I remembered the multi-triangular sigil she’d branded on my chest with her witch-magick at the beginning of our date. \n\nPlacidly, I let her apply the burn ointment. Her fingers traced the inflammation tenderly, flicking away black specks where the flesh had been charred by the sorcerous branding. As she soothed my flesh, she murmured incantatory lyrics in some time-forgotten and profane-sounding language. My mind swooned, lulled almost to mental dormancy by the outré hymnal verses. \n\nOnce fully applied, she withdrew a bandage from her nightstand—I was too tired to wonder at its peculiar presence there—and gently patched up her work. I was hers, now. Had been claimed as her lover – and more.  \n\nShe drove me back to my home—I was basically catatonic—where my friends were waiting to meet me. Seeing me in such a physically sapped state, they crowded around me and cast resentful glances toward her, but I waved away their burgeoning animosity. She’d done me no wrong, no matter what harm had come to my flesh.  \n\nShe left me in their care, promising to again summon me to her home sometime soon. She’d been a demoness, at some point in the early periods of antemundane Time; had dwelt among Haden flame-forms and feral incubi in the sweltering furnace of some proto-Hell. Millennia after that, a swamp-sired witch, who’d brewed and concocted blasphemous victuals for dumb or merely short-sighted peasant folk. Now, she’s a Goth Mommy, Wheyfu, and Hello Kitty Girl, all rolled into one ridiculous—or, ridiculously hot—amalgam.  \n\nShe terrifies me, but I love her.",

        "text": "これらは山梨県警察が公開した公式書類です。\n\n*\\*English Translation\\**\n\n**Name:** Kanno Mizuki\n\n**Age:** 15\n\n**Sex:** Female\n\n**Height:** 152.4 cm\n\n**Weight:** 43.4 kg\n\n**Hair color:** Black\n\n**Eye color:** Dark Brown\n\n**Description:** Kanno Mizuki was last seen on February 28, 2007, at approximately 3:27 p.m. She was wearing a white dress shirt, a navy blue blazer, a dark plaid knee-length skirt, long wool socks, and white shoes. She was carrying a large black backpack with gray accents.\n\n**Last known location:** Kanno was last seen leaving her school, Fuji-kawaguchiko High School, located at Japan, 〒401-0301 Yamanashi, Minamitsuru District, Fujikawaguchiko, 船津６６６３−１, on foot. She did not have a bike, and her cell phone has been turned off since the time of her disappearance.\n\n*Translator notes: In Japan, it is very normal for children to walk home from a very young age. Japan is considered a very safe country to live in and therefore parents let children walk freely from place to place.*  \n\n**Investigation:** Kanno's family reported her missing on March 1, 2007, 7:28 a.m. after she failed to show up home. Kanno is known to be reliable and punctual, and her disappearance is considered out of character. Kanno loves her parents dearly and is known to have many friends. There is no known reason for her to have left without notifying anyone. \n\nFebruary 28, 2007, 7:29 p.m. Multiple reports have come from children in the Kawaguchiko area claiming to hear the faint sound of a bell in the distance. Later, three separate families came into Kawaguchiko Police Box to report that their pets had gone missing. \n\n*Translator notes: Unusually heavy fog was reported to be rolling through the entirety of Yamanashi prefecture during this time. The local municipality advised people to avoid unnecessary travel if possible until the fog clears. They reminded residents to use their headlights and fog lights while driving and to keep a safe distance from other vehicles. Pedestrians were advised to wear reflective clothing or carry a flashlight to increase their visibility. The municipality urged residents to check the latest weather and traffic updates before heading out.*\n\nMarch 2, 2007, 10:21 p.m. An elderly woman working at a 7-Eleven 5.3 km east of Kanno’s last known location reported seeing a girl with a similar description slowly walking by. The woman reported that the girl was unresponsive to the woman’s greetings and other external stimuli. The woman commented how the girl didn’t seem to have eyes and did not intervene as she was frightened. The girl was last seen walking east along Nat'l Rte 139.\n\nPolice were sent out towards the area where the girl was last seen and conducted a search of the surrounding areas. They were able to recover a white shoe that matched the shoe size of Kanno Mizuki. However, they were unable to find any other sign of the girl in the area or which direction she might have gone. Patrols have been deployed along Nat'l Rte 139.\n\nMarch 3, 2007, 7:01 p.m. Two children coming back from an after-school program at Narusawa Elementary School were found passed out near Narusawa Post Office. While giving their statements in the nearby care facility they mentioned how they saw a girl seemingly without eyes walk past them. The children claimed that they felt extremely dizzy and collapsed onto the ground at the sound of a chiming bell. \n\nMarch 4, 2007, 8:22 a.m. More reports of pets going missing by residents in and around the Kawaguchiko area. A separate investigation has been launched in order to locate the animals.\n\nThe local neighborhood association in a joint effort with Kanno’s parents have launched a campaign for locating Kanno's whereabouts. They have printed out flyers, were able to contact a news station, and urged anyone with more information regarding Kanno to please come forward and assist in the search.\n\nMarch 5, 2007, 9:56 a.m. The owner of the hotel Fuji Midori no Kyuka-mura had many complaints coming from parents saying that their children were unable to sleep due to a bell ringing incessantly throughout the night even though the parents themselves were not able to hear it.\n\nMarch 5, 2007, 3:07 p.m. Drivers on Nat'l Rte 139 into Aokigahara forest reported smelling an extremely pungent order along the route. One report said it smelled like “a combination of rotten eggs and fish sweltering under the sun.”\n\n*Translator Notes: Aokigahara Forest, also known as the Sea of Trees or the Suicide Forest, is a dense, 35-square-kilometer forest located at the base of Mount Fuji in Japan. The forest is known for its dense vegetation and the many natural caves that are formed by the lava flow from Mount Fuji. The forest has gained a reputation for being a site of frequent suicides, making it a subject of controversy and intrigue.* \n\nMarch 5, 2007, 6:19 p.m. A teenage boy working at the 森の駅 風穴 (Wind Cave Shop), a souvenir store, broke out into a psychotic episode after apparently hearing the sound of a bell. He was later admitted into a psychiatric care facility in Kawaguchiko. \n\nMarch 5, 2007, 7:40 p.m. A couple hiking the nearby tokai nature trail reported seeing a girl matching Kanno's description near the entrance of the Aokigahara Forest. They claimed that she was walking off the path and deeper into the forest. The man tried to approach her, but a very heavy fog suddenly set in which obstructed his vision and he lost sight of her.\n\nA search and rescue party was formed immediately to search for Kanno. Authorities combed through the forest for days, but they were unable to locate her. The tracking dogs were surprisingly not able to pick up on any scent from her shoe, not only that, but they refused to enter the forest altogether. The dense undergrowth and rugged terrain made the search difficult, and the heavy fog that had descended on the forest only added to the challenge. \n\nMarch 10, 2007, 12:31 p.m. A school teacher and seven children were on a class field trip to  Aokigahara forest. They were hiking on a trail 3.2 km southwest of tokai nature trail. The teacher reported seeing the corpses of many small domestic animals as well as birds around the area. All seven of the children claimed they could hear the distinct sound of a chiming bell coming from the forest while the teacher could not.\n\nJanuary 7, 2023, 10:22 a.m. A second shoe, articles of clothing, and several of Kano Mizuki’s belongings have washed up in a sewage ditch in Shizuoka.\n\n*Translator notes: Despite the ongoing search efforts, Kanno was never found, and her disappearance remains a mystery to this day. Unfortunately, she has not been the first child to have gone missing. From the 1950s over 40 children have disappeared from towns, cities, and even prefectures surrounding Aokigahara forest .The rugged terrain and dense undergrowth make it a difficult place to navigate, and it is easy to become disoriented or lost. The forest is also known for its eerily quiet atmosphere.*\n\n*People love to gossip, so it’s important to be rational and stay close to the facts of the case, but locals in the area are starting to speculate.* \n\n***Something is luring children into the*** **Aokigahara forest.**",

        "text": "  \n\nJulie and I had been married for ten years. We had two kids, one boy and one girl. Our anniversary was fast approaching and I hadn’t planned anything. Truth be told, I hadn’t planned anything significant for the last three years. I had fallen in that funk. So, I decided to book a trip to Chicago over the weekend. She had never been and when I told her she was elated. It was only going to be a weekend trip but she was building an itinerary as if we were going to be there for a year. I let her plan the whole trip, whatever she wanted to do we did it. I had no input. I felt like she had never loved me more than at that moment. \n\nWhen we got home from the airport I fumbled for the keys. Not only did I have problems getting the keys out of my pocket, but I struggled to insert it into the keyhole. Julie grabbed the keys from me and opened the front door.\n\n“Damn Dan,” laughing as she walked into the house. \n\nI was having similar issues in all areas of my life. Simple tasks became extremely difficult. I couldn’t keep my balance and was prone to accidents. My legs and arms felt useless, dead, weak beyond use, becoming vestigial. It progressed over the following year, so much so that I finally forced myself to go to the doctor. ALS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, was the diagnosis, or better known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. The story of my life had instantly been reduced, abridged to only a few more chapters. \n\n“How long,” Julie asked the doctor. \n\n“Two to five years. Some have been known to live ten more years.”\n\nAs if ten was really that much better. Not ten good years, but ten worsening years. Ten years of becoming immobile and lifeless. Ten slow years of dying. \n\nThe car ride home was quiet. Julie was crying to herself, driving, but not paying attention to the road. She was thinking about a life without me, I was thinking about how best to die. A part of me considered suicide, but I wasn’t quite ready to be away from my children. I had to at least put things in order for them. I also wanted to create lasting memories of who I was, that with all my faults I was at least a good father. \n\nTime passed. A year and a half later and I couldn’t walk, confined to a wheelchair. A nurse came to visit me every week to check my vitals and bring me my medication. She taught Julie how to change out the colostomy bag and some other simple tasks when the nurse wasn’t available. \n\nJulie’s demeanor began to change. She went from loving and patient to irritated and depressed. With each passing stage of my illness, she became ever more hateful. One night we were watching television together, me slumped in my wheelchair and her all the way across the room in her favorite recliner. She never would wheel me close to her but kept me as far away as possible. Her cell phone rang.\n\n“Hey Randy. What’s up? Ok, I can’t talk. I’m here with ole deadweight. I can’t wait either.”\n\n“Who was that?” I asked. \n\n“None of your business but if you must know, someone from work. We might hang out Saturday night,” cutting her eyes towards me to see my reaction. \n\n“With Randy, a guy?”\n\n“Yep, it's no big deal. We’re just friends.” \n\nThat friendship blossomed into something deeper. Julie was rarely home, spending all her time down at the Alley Bar and Grill. She would come home drunk, existing in a different world than mine. She all but ignored me except when factors of my disease became too visible to ignore. Changing the colostomy bag was of particular agitation for her. \n\n“I hate changing your shit bag. If you really loved me, you would just go ahead and die,” slurring the last half of the sentence. I would usually ignore it and chalk it up to the alcohol. *She didn’t really mean it. She’s just frustrated and drunk.*\n\nAnother year passed and I couldn’t move at all, confined to my hospital bed, hooked up to a system of medical machinery, clicking out the last moments of my life. Julie had moved the kids to her parent’s house along with a good deal of the furniture. I never felt so alone. The only happiness I had at that time was my kids. I thought they would eventually tire of me like Julie, but they were always willing to spend time with me. I only needed a few minutes a day. I didn’t want them to waste their lives sitting at a dying man’s rented gravesite. \n\nJulie always put a different face on in front of the nurse. She wasn’t physically abusive, but she was a mind grinding, ego shattering bitch. She knew what to say to aggravate me. She always did, but now she turned on her craft to its highest wave of severity, crushing my soul with her relentless pounding vitriol. Her favorite line was always a variation of “If you love me, then such and such,” insert hateful clause. Finally, though, it did get physical. \n\nShe started bringing Randy home. They always came through the front door and went straight upstairs. I could hear them upstairs doing what we used to do as a married couple. I could tell that she truly loved Randy and was so ready to be with him and done with me. At this point, I could hardly speak, but one night I had heard enough. This man in my house, that I paid for, with my wife, acting as if I wasn’t here, and like he had sacrificed his own time and effort for everything he was now enjoying. I started moaning and causing a racket, straining to be a nuisance, even though it took an unimaginable amount of will power just to do that. I heard the upstairs door slam open and a stampede of steps down the stairs. \n\n“Shut the fuck up. What’s wrong with you?” \n\nI just moaned even more, and at one point I accidentally squealed. That pissed her off for some reason, so I increased the squealing. \n\n“Maybe he’s in pain Julie.”\n\n“No, he’s a fucking baby.” She went over to the couch and grabbed a throw pillow and smashed it in my face. She wasn’t letting up. I was struggling to breathe, trapped in my own corpse, unable to defend myself. Finally, I felt a rush of fresh air, as the pillow was thrown off my face.  Randy had intervened. \n\n“What are you doing? Are you psycho? You trying to kill the man!”\n\n“No, of course not. I was going to let up. I just lost my temper.” Randy looked over at me and I could see that he had lost something for her. She looked entirely different now. She wasn’t the fun-loving brunette he had fallen in love with at the bar. For the first time, I could see that Randy was sympathetic. I still hated him, but I knew it was probably over between him and her. Mission accomplished. The power of squealing. \n\nI wept that night. My emotions welling up, but not pity, full on fucking anger. My face was wet with tears, tears that my pathetic no-good limp-ass arms couldn’t wipe away. The more I thought about the trivial task of wiping away tears and how I was unable to do that, the angrier I got. I prayed to God, but not the type of prayer you hear in church. I begged God to perform a miracle. I prayed that Julie would die and watch me walk away healthy and with a beautiful blond by my side. I prayed that our kids would hate her forever and spit in her god damned face. I prayed for the worst possible traumas and calamities to befall her, but in the end, all was silent. The adulterous no good fucking couple had turned out the lights. They didn’t even leave the television on for me. I laid there in the dark, listening to the wind blow outside. Even my slight forgiveness of Randy had subsided. \n\nAnd then my anger turned towards God. How could he do this? He couldn’t even give me a peaceful death. He couldn’t give me a loving wife until the very end, until my very last breath. I wouldn’t have begrudged her to move on the very next day, after they had shoveled the final piece of dust onto my coffin. I wondered how God could be so cruel as to rip me from my children. Why such a slow agonizing death and so, out of spite, not really expecting anything to happen, I prayed to Satan. I asked him if he healed me, I would do whatever he asked. Just give me back my kids, give me back my life. \n\nThe wind outside picked up. The moon seemed to dim its light. I heard the swing set swaying violently, the chains clanging against the bars. At the foot of the bed, I saw a dark arm fumble for the footboard, long fingers grasping, and then the other arm. A stench filled the room and everything else but the figure before me fell out of focus. The head emerged, thinning hair, sunken in face, and exposed teeth. I noticed there were no lips and where his nose should have been, there was only a flap of skin.  He crawled up onto my body, skin grey, and oily, taut to the bone and every little muscle in his body twitching rapidly. He crawled all the way up to me and put his mouth to my mouth. \n\nI fell out of my body and into another dimension. In front of me I could see a field with trees, flowers budding and growing in rapid succession, the most beautiful blue skies, my kids bouncing around the playground and me watching on a park bench. I felt my body falling again. There was Julie lying in bed. From the other side of the bed, I watched a figure from behind walk up and strangle Julie. The figure looked back at me, and I was staring at my own face. I fell again, and there chained in a dark room was myself, with no chance of escape, locked away for eternity. \n\nI understood the offer, and it’s simple but terrifying details. I could have my kids and my life back, if I killed Julie, but at a price. I would lose my soul. I opened my eyes, and the dark figure was sitting on top of my chest staring at me with inquisitive white eyes, and for the first time in a long time, I uttered one coherent word, “Yes.” The deal was made, and the figure slowly disappeared. I instantly felt my legs, my arms, my gut, all of it every inch of my body was oscillating with vibrant sensation. When everything is dead, and then suddenly alive, you feel it all, immaculate nerve firing, pulsating, gyrating biological functions. The beauty of it was overwhelming, but then my thought was clouded with hate. \n\nI slowly walked upstairs. I was worried about Randy. He was bigger than me. He would have no problem beating me off of her, but I had made a deal and I was determined to see the fear and bewilderment in her eyes when I was on top of her. I didn’t have to worry about Randy. Randy was laying on his back with his eyes wide open and his intestines torn from his gut and strewn across the bed. I saw a pair of eyes watching me from the closet. I climbed on top of Julie, her eyes open wide, and there it was, the fear I so relished. It was astonishingly beautiful, yet fearful at the same time. I let go. *I’m not a killer*. I heard a low growl from the closet. \n\n“If you love me…”\n\n“But I don’t.” \n\nOf course, I got away. I was missing. Assumed dead. How can a paralyzed man kill his wife and lover? It was all a lie. A fugitive can’t spend any time with his kids. The dark charlatan tricked me. My time is limited. Now I wander if it was worth it. I don’t enjoy myself. I can’t enjoy my time. I don’t enjoy the freedom of moving about without having to depend on anyone else, because I’m a prisoner of anonymity. All I ever think about is dying. Death is constantly on my mind, well not death, but what happens after death. Sometimes I lie in bed unable to move, as if someone is sitting on top of me. I hear the clicking of the machines, counting down the days of my accursed life. I took the apple the serpent offered, and now I’m waiting to pay the price.",

        "text": "To celebrate our anniversary, my wife and I booked an AirBnB for the weekend–a cabin on the lake. \"Looks like it's about to rain,\" Amber said as she rolled her suitcase across the porch.\n\nI looked up. To the west, the sky was deep gray, thick storm clouds heading towards us at a steady pace. \"Just our luck,\" I grumbled, hauling my suitcase out of the trunk.\n\nAfter we’d gotten everything inside, we poured wine and sat by the picture window overlooking the lake. The sky was darker, now, and the glassy stillness of the water reflected the deep gray of the sky. The pine trees surrounding the lake swayed in the wind.\n\n“Wait–look,” Amber said. “There’s someone out there.”\n\nAt first I didn’t see what she was talking about. But then, as I squinted, I did: in the middle of the lake, there was a tiny, peach-colored blob bobbing up and down.\n\nSomeone *was* out there.\n\nAnd they were waving their arms around–as if signaling for help.\n\n“Oh, God, are they drowning?” Amber asked, rushing over to the window.\n\n“Uh, you call the police,” I said, getting up and grabbing my jacket. “I’ll take the rowboat out and try to help.”\n\nThe AirBnB had advertised a small rowboat that we could use; I could be out in the middle of the lake in under five minutes. Given how far we were out from town, it would probably take the police twenty minutes to get here.\n\nAmber looked at me, as if she were about to say something; but then she just nodded. I zipped up my coat and ran outside.\n\nThe rain had started. A light drizzle blurred the lake in front of me, wetting my face. I ran down to the docks and undid the knot, then stepped into the boat. It rocked violently underneath me as I sat down and pushed off with the oars.\n\nI rowed furiously towards the center of the lake, keeping my eyes on the person. But they were a lot farther out than I had anticipated. Even after rowing five minutes, my arm muscles burning, I was only *slightly* closer.\n\nI stopped for a second and cupped my hands around my mouth. “Hey! I’m coming to help! Hang in there!”\n\nThey didn’t respond. Just kept waving their arms over their head. *Probably can’t hear me,* I thought. Sucking in a deep breath, I began to row faster.\n\nThe rain was harder now. Thick raindrops hit the wood of my boat with a *tap-tap-tap.* Water dripped down from my hair and into my eyes. I shook my head to get it off, not breaking stroke, and continued rowing towards the center of the lake.\n\nThe person was finally a little closer now. I could see them bobbing up and down on the surface of the lake through the pelting rain, waving their arms furiously above their head. It looked like it was possibly a woman with dark hair, but I couldn’t be certain.\n\nThe oars sloshed through the lake. I was panting and my arms ached, but I forced myself to continue forward. They weren’t that far off now. In just a few minutes I’d probably be close enough to yell out to them, to see them clearly…\n\n*Flash.*\n\nThe sky flashed white. Seconds later–the rumble of thunder, so loud I could feel it in my bones. I swallowed.\n\n*This isn’t safe.*\n\nI glanced back at the cabin. It was so far away, now. I could see the tiny brown blob that was Amber, standing on the docks, waiting for me to return. *Maybe we should’ve just waited for the police. What if I get struck by lightning?*\n\nI swallowed and turned back to the woman. Paddled as fast as I could with all my might. The rain pelted down furiously, running down my face, pooling in the bottom of the boat. The peach colored blob grew closer and closer, and then–\n\nI could see her clearly for the first time.\n\nEvery muscle in my body froze. Because as she bobbed on the water, waving her hands above her head–\n\nShe was smiling.\n\nNot just smiling. Grinning from ear to ear as she stared at my boat approaching. Instinctively I grabbed the oars and backpedaled. The water resisted me, kicking up in loud splashes, and then the boat began to slide away from her–\n\n*Riiiiing.*\n\nI grabbed the cell phone out of my pocket. It was Amber.\n\n“Drew,” she breathed, her voice wavering on the other end of the line. “The police… they said… whatever you do, don’t go out into the lake.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Some psycho has been swimming out into the middle of the lake. Luring people out. Just leave her there! Come back–”\n\nShe continued talking, but I didn’t hear what she said.\n\nBecause the woman had disappeared.\n\nThe phone fell out of my hands. I grabbed the oars and pulled them towards me, rowing backwards towards the shore as fast as I possibly could. I stared into the water, looking for a ripple, a shadow, anything–but it was impossible. With the rain hitting the surface, the reflections of the storm clouds, there was no way I could tell where she was.\n\nI rowed faster, my heart pounding in my chest. Glancing over my shoulder, I could see that the dock was still so far away. Amber began waving to me, frantically–\n\n*Flash.*\n\nThe sky, the lake, the pine trees at the shore lit up. A peal of thunder rang in my ears. I rowed faster–\n\nAnd then I heard it.\n\nA *tap-tap-tap.*\n\nFrom the bottom of my boat.\n\nI didn’t have time to react, before the boat flipped over and I plunged into the ice cold water. I broke the surface and gasped in air, screaming, as I grabbed the side of the boat–\n\nSomething grabbed my ankle and tugged.\n\nI plunged back into the water. I struggled to pull myself up, but the iron grip on my ankle wouldn’t loosen. I kicked and thrashed, trying to pull myself up towards the shadow of the boat above me–\n\nAnd then the grip released.\n\nI broke the surface, gasping. Then I clawed at the boat, desperately righting it. After a few attempts, I was finally able to get myself back inside. I turned it around and rowed as fast as I possibly could, never looking back.\n\nMiraculously, the woman didn’t follow me.\n\nI scrambled up on the dock and Amber hugged me, crying. The police arrived soon after and searched the lake for the woman. But they came up empty-handed. Needless to say, Amber and I cut our trip short. We packed our bags and started the drive home just after the sun had set.\n\nBut as we pulled out of the driveway, in the darkness…\n\nI swear I saw a light winking at us, from the middle of the lake.\n\nAs if someone was trapped out there, signaling for help.",

        "text": "in 1982, on the 30th of december.   a 9-year-old girl who was kidnapped by a family friend and hidden behind a wall.   The girl was last seen wearing a black dress before she was taken.   The kidnapper,  who was known to the family,  had constructed a hidden room behind a wall in his home, where he kept the girl hidden for several days.\n\n  Katie Beers had a hard childhood.   When she was little, her mother abandoned her.   Her godmother took her in,  but only so the girl could do all the chores, cook the meals, and act as a servant. Meanwhile, her uncle started abusing her when she was two,  making her life a living hell.   Little did she know things would get even worse.\n\n  How a 9-Year-Old Was Kidnapped by a Family Friend\n\n  Katie was never allowed to go to school.   Instead, she stayed with her godmother and uncle,  and the lonely girl’s only friend was a man named John Esposito.   He was a family friend,  and she looked forward to their visits.   So when she was nine years old, and he announced he was taking her to an amusement park,  she didn’t think it was suspicious.   She was excited to go to her favorite place.\n\n  However,  the pair never made it to the park.   Instead,  Esposito kidnapped Katie and took her to his house.   There, he put her into an elaborate dungeon in a tunnel system behind the wall — the same place Katie played at as it was being built.   She had no idea it was being built for her.\n\n  For 17 days,  the man kept her there and sexually assaulted her as police searched high and low.   At first, they suspected the family,  but eventually,  their gaze turned to Esposito, who wasn’t the stand-up community man he had claimed to be.\n\n  How One Little Girl’s Questions Saved Her Own Life\n\n  Down in the dungeon,  Katie was allowed to have the TV on 24/7 so she was aware of the updates in her investigation.   She began playing mind games with Esposito,  asking him what the future looked like and what his ultimate plan was.   At one point,  he wanted her to play dead so that he could take a picture of her,  and the police would stop looking,  but she refused.\n\n  “From that point on,  I rarely slept,  and I also did not eat any of the food that he could have altered,” she told. “  I was fearful that he might put something in the food,  a sedative,  a sleeping pill, something.”  Katie knew if he snapped that photo,  it would seal her fate.\n\n'   'The best part of my story is knowing that you can recover,  and you can persevere, and your life is 100 per what you make it to be.''\n\n“  I was disgusted.  I was 10 years old.  I was trying to get him to think about the long-term of him kidnapping me,” she continued. “  I told him that I was sick and I wasn’t feeling well. [Between the police department laying on him at his house all the time and my questions and me saying that I wasn’t feeling well finally wore him down.”](https://youtu.be/VzXYI5soP28)",

        "text": "I grew up in a haunted house. \n\nThe whole family knew the house was haunted. We'd all experienced paranormal events together and apart within the house. \n\nIt was never a constant everyday thing. There would be periods of inactivity and periods of activity. There were \"hot spots\" you could avoid to try and keep from having a pants shitting experience, but there were no guarantees. \n\nMy mom believed the ghosts were there to help her. I have no idea what gave her that idea. None of what they did was the slightest bit friendly. It wasn't unusual to be in real physical danger. \n\nHumans are very adaptable. They can live in just about any environment if given the time to adjust. I had adjusted. \n\nI was 13 years old and waking up for school. The house hadn't made a peep in months. The morning was peaceful. The scent of tea and toast. My grandmother waiting to take me to school. \n\nThere was nothing to indicate something was wrong. The temperature hadn't dropped. No unusual noises. No glass flying across the rooms. Still, my stomach was in knots. \n\nUsually, when I'd get a bad feeling, I couldn't wait to leave the house. This time, I dreaded the thought. I asked my grandma to let me stay home. That was a hard no. You didn't miss school unless you were dying. Not on Grams watch. Besides, she'd come just to ready me and get me to school. Mom was passed out in bed as usual. \n\nShe was a drunk. It wouldn't be til noon or later that she'd rise out of bed for some coffee and smokes.\n\nAt school, I was a wreck. I just knew something sinister was happening at home. My school wasn't far. I could easily walk there and back. I couldn't tell you why Gram always insisted on dropping me off and picking me up. I decided to bail. \n\nI walked off the school property and in the direction of home. The closer I got, the sicker I felt. More than once, I was overcome with nausea and forced to sit down. \n\nWhen I finally made it to my house, I was chilled to the bone. There, it stood dark and unforgiving. More menacing than it had ever felt before. I felt physically repelled away from it. \n\nEverything in me screamed not to go in. The thought of my mother passed out inside forced me up the front steps. \n\nWhen I walked in, the house was dark and cold. My grandmother always opened up all the curtains to let the sunshine in every morning. They had all been closed. Not a single light was on. My teeth were chattering from the cold. It had been warm just outside. \n\nI called for my mom and headed for her bedroom. Her usual spot in bed was empty. Next, I headed for the garage; her smoking spot. She wasn't there either. She wasn't responding to me. I searched the entire upstairs; no mom. \n\nThe house was \"upside down.\" Meaning you were upstairs when you entered. The downstairs was the spookiest area of the whole house. No one ever went down there. I stared down the steps and called for mom again. No answer. \n\nWith a heavy heart, I descended the steps.\n\nThe downstairs had a living room and a master bedroom. Despite many attempts to make it a livable space, its issues stopped it from becoming anything but a no man's land. Electricity hardly worked down there. When it did choose to work, you could count on it only lighting a single lamp. The master bedroom would have been beautiful. But its accompanied master bath had been left in unfinished ruins. The master bath was the one room you could always count on something paranormal happening. It was a room full of dirt, rats, and wooden support beams. The only fully constructed thing in there was a small door. It was at the back of the room, no taller than that of a 4 year old child. The door was ornate. Carvings were etched in with gold trim and a golden handle. It led to a secret entrance/exit at the side of the home. My mother (and father before he left) had spent thousands attempting to finish that bathroom. Construction workers frequently quit. Anything that did get built fell apart, and like the rest of the downstairs, electricity refused its job. \n\nMom kept that door bolted up, and we all knew why. \n\nI was in the living room and turned to find the bedroom door open. Even worse, inside the bedroom, the master bath door was also wide open. A deep dread filled me.\n\nAt this point, I was sobbing. I was begging my mother to answer me. I could see she wasn't in the living room or the bedroom. I did not want to check the closets or the \"bathroom.\" \n\nI walked to the open doorway of what would've been the master bath. It was just as I'd remembered. Pitch Black. Cold. Horrifying. I called my mother's name into the darkness, and this time, I got a reply. \n\n\"Tamsin? Help, I've hurt my ankle!\" \n\nI rushed inside. The door swung closed behind me. I swung around to try and open it, but it wouldn't budge. I tried not to panic. The little door was there in the darkness. I would have to cross the expanse of the room to get to it, but I knew it would open.  I don't know how, but I'd always inherently known that the door was an escape hatch. For situations such as these. \n\n\"Mom?\" \n\nNothing. My eyes were slowly adjusting to the dark. It was a dangerous room to explore blind. It was unfinished, and it didn't even have a floor. Nails and other tools had been discarded by construction workers over the many years of the houses life. Mom hadn't been the only owner to try and fail with that cursed room. Though I could always hear rats from the room, I never saw a single one. \n\n\"Mom!!!!!!!!!\" \n\nNothing. My eyes explored the shapes of the room. The beams. A blue tarp. No mom. In the distance, I could see a doorknob. My way out. \n\nI continued to call for my mother as I carefully maneuvered my way to the door. If this ever had been made a bathroom, it would've been huge. \n\nRelief flooded me like a drug when I finally reached the little door. Its golden handle was warm in my hand, seemingly unaffected by the chill of the room. \n\n\"Tamsin? I'm over here! You're going the wrong way!\" My ankle...\" \n\nMom's voice. It was coming all the way back from where I'd started. The door in the bedroom. \n\nI opened the little door to let the sunshine in. Maybe it would let me see through the darkness. \n\n\"TAMSIN NO DONT LEAVE ME IN HERE\" \n\nShe was practically shrieking. The sunlight illuminated very little of the room. I couldn't see all the way across to the voices origin. \n\nI stood by the sunlight, unwilling to leave the safety of its warmth. \n\n\"Mom? You weren't answering me...\" \n\n\"I'm sorry I'm in so much pain... I think- I think it's broken. Please, please come get me.\" \n\n\"I'm going to go call 911.\" \n\n\"NO!!!!!!!! DONT LEAVE ME IN HERE PLEASE\" \n\nShe sounded desperate. The situation was far too strange. I was hesitant to leave her in the room and hesitant to believe she was there at all. It did make sense to me why she'd want so badly to leave that room. But I still hadn't seen her, and I wanted out of that room myself. \n\n\"Can you move? Try to come towards the light.\" \n\n\"I can't! I can't move! You need to come get me!\" \n\n\"Why were you down here?\"\n\n\"I thought the cat had gotten in here, I heard noises.\" \n\nThis, too, was plausible. The cat would occasionally meow from inside the room. With both doors leading inside still locked up tight. We never did figure out how she got in there. \n\n\"Mom, I'm scared, I'm going to call 911 you need help\" \n\n\"NO DONT LEAVE ME ALONE DOWN HERE\" \n\nIt sounded like she had begun to cry. Tears rolled down my face as well. \n\n\"I couldn't lift you even if I found you. We need help!\" \n\n\"I could get up with your help just come and get me\" \n\n\"Where are you? I wasn't able to find you when I came in.\" \n\n\"I'm right by the door! Now come get me!\" \n\nI was still hesitant. My instinct told me not to leave the safety of the little door. My logic told me she couldn't be right by the door or I would have seen her when I'd come in. She claimed she couldn't move. She couldn't have moved spots then could she? Despite all this, the voice of my mother begging me to stay kept me in place. I told myself I was being silly. That she was hurt. She needed my help. I had to go get her.  \n\nSuddenly, there was a commotion at the front of the house. I could hear it from the little doors opening. Sirens. Voices. I was thrilled. I didn't know how help had come, but it had. \n\n\"Mom! I can hear sirens in the front! I'll lead them to you!\" \n\nInhuman screaming came from \"mom.\" Whatever was there in the darkness hovered just outside the sunlight pouring in. It screamed at the sunlights edge, blowing dust and dirt everywhere. \n\nI couldn't see it clearly. Its eyes glowed a pale white, but the glow was dim. By where the eyes were located; this thing was huge. I could only judge its appearance by the  movement in the dark. It stood a great height, and when it's arms flew out, they extended the expanse of the room. It never crossed the threshold into the sunlight. \n\nI scurried through the doorway and ran to the voices I heard in the backyard. \n\nThat's when I first saw her. Mom was on the ground of the backyard. Blood had pooled underneath her. She was bent in ways no human ever should be. Paramedics were working on her. They didn't even notice me until I started screaming. \n\nThe next thing I knew, I was sitting in a truck wrapped in a blanket. Grammy drove in and held me in her arms. \n\nTurns out mom had gone out onto the deck that morning after we left. She'd hoisted herself up on the wooden railing and took a swan dive onto the cement patch below. She had remained there broken and unconscious until our neighbor saw her from her own back deck. \n\nIt took months to put Humpty Dumpty back together again. Still, she survived. She spent the rest of her life in agony from the injuries. She walked with a hunched back, unable to stand straight up, and she limped from a broken leg and shattered ankle. \n\nShe was never able to climb the stairs of the house again. \n\nShe never said a thing to me about what happened. Why she had done it. But I did learn from Grammy that when she finally came to, she told the doctors that a demon had chased her onto and over the ledge.",

        "text": "Hey r/nosleep I was wondering if you guys could help me out a little here. So the other day I was talking to my friends right, and one of them is a big Spongebob fan. Like this motherfucker can name all of the episodes in the first few seasons.\n\nMy other friends also have watched a decent amount of Spongebob and the conversation just kind of naturally went there. And eventually it came up that I had never really watched Spongebob as a kid. Yknow and they were all like “why?”.\n\nSo I told them that I was always really freaked out by the blue man who shows up in the intro. Yknow the blue silhouette around 30 seconds. I think spongebob is like reassembling himself at that point, it’s been a while since I watched the intro clip tbh. But like broad strokes, blue background, blue man, smile(?) I don’t really remember his face too well.\n\nBut yeah that guy would always scare the hell out of me, like it was bad my man. I was a little dude myself right so seeing that blue silhouette pop up for like one or two frames would cause me to goddamn shit myself in fright. Like it was at the point where I would hallucinate this blue asshole standing in the corner of the room when I tried to sleep.\n\nAnd I mean it’s funny to think about now yknow. Because it was scary to me as a kid for sure, but it was just a blue dude. Actually kinda fuckin funny right. Deeply traumatizing but kind of funny yknow.\n\nAnd as I was telling them this they looked at me like I was fuckin high yknow. Like it kinda hurt. Not too much but like, still.\n\nWhen I tried to find the clip on youtube to show them I couldn’t find it so like I am wondering if it was like a prank for an episode or two. Maybe a producer slipped it in to scare some kids or something idk.\n\nBut yeah I hear that you guys are good with like knowing about spooky stuff so I was wondering if any of you have seen the blue dude? Please let me know so I can prove to my friends that I am not insane. Gracias!\n\nEdit: Fuck there’s a word requirement. Shit man. That’s what I get for not knowing much about this subreddit I guess lmao. Whatever I am still going to post here, rules be damned! I need answers not bureaucracy.\n\nBut like having had more time to think about it I actually saw him a lot as a kid.\n\nLike I’ve seen around 5 or 6 episodes of spongebob and he was in the intro of everyone yknow. \n\nAnd like, I mean I am not like prone to hallucinations right, I just had a little kid imagination, but like I hallucinated him a lot back in the day.\n\nI would often see him as I was getting ready to go to bed, peeking his head out of my closet door. I would stare at him and he would stare back, it was some scary shit for a little kid to imagine. And when I hid my head under my blanket I knew that he was above me, waiting for me to peek my head out. I spent entire nights holding my breath under the blanket, praying for the sun to rise again.\n\nThinking back this really fucked me up as a kid. Like I don’t want to make a big deal out of it and sue, but god damn some closure would be nice. Why would Nickolodeon allow that to air?\n\nAND WHY THE HELL DOES NO ONE ELSE REMEMBER THIS MOTHERFUCKER. I stg that shit has me more fucked up than anything else.\n\nNot even any google search results like what the hell man. I know what I fuckin saw. HE WAS THERE HE WAS THERE HE WAS THERE\n\nSorry for the small rant there, but yeah once again, if any of you guys have seen the blue dude let me  know.",

        "text": "*The worst thing I ever did was save a mouse from drowning...*\n\n*Now.*\n\n“My favorite color is yellow” the pudgy thirty some year old woman to my left thought out loud. With her skin I would not be surprised if she never saw the sun before. “My name is Helga and I like sour things” she added, finishing her turn playing the game Two Truths and a Lie. A game that I suspect we are only playing because I’ve been here for eleven months and havent “opened up” like the doctors hoped. \n\n“That's great Helga” says the doctor who is also sitting with us in a circle to make us feel as though she is one of us. To further illustrate the point she tells us to call her “Phyllis” instead of “doctor” or “doctor” whatever their last name is. \n\nShe isn't the only one here who does that either. \n\n“She doesn't like sour things” shouted a short haired blonde woman who is bordering on being too skinny and being far too wrinkly for her age. I don’t know her name because she is new here\n\n“You're right” Helga says, impressed with her roommate.\n\n“How about you?” Phyllis asks me.\n\nI look up from the same four square tiles on the floor that I’ve been looking at since I was first wheeled in here on the wheelchair. When I see that she is indeed talking to me I point to my chest hoping that there is someone behind me or her eyes went crossed.\n\n“Yeah, why not?” Phylis laughs. “It's easy. Tell us two truths and one lie about yourself”.\n\nI think about how to respond. So far I have given them nothing during my stay here and I don’t want to give them anything they don’t already know. I have to participate to some extent however because being here is better than being in jail. Just as soon as I can feel the awkward silence set in my mouth moves into action without the consent of my brain. “I used to have a dog named Wyoming, I never drank imported beer and the worst thing I ever did was save a mouse from drowning”. \n\n“Why was it the worst thing you ever did?” asked Casey, the youngest of the guys here by at least five years. He came in here right after me. During my time here in the hospital I’ve learned not to get attached or to bond with anyone because this hospital is a waystop for people about to get rotated out to go to who knows where? Maybe a real prison? \n\n“That's the lie” Gene answered. A ‘no doi’ apparent in his voice.\n\n“Are you a Capricorn?” Missy asks quietly between the noises where there was silence. I shake my head. \n\nShe is about to ask more but Phyllis speaks up.\n\n“That's good” Phyllis delivers this in such a way that I am the only one who thought it was said coldly. When I look back at her she does not look entertained and her eyes are locked on mine. “Its good to see you are getting your sense of humor back” she adds. Her face and attitude changes completely when she turns to the man on my right “How about you, Greg? Two truths and a lie.”\n\nI force myself to look back at the same four black and white squares on the floor to pass the time. \n\n*Then*\n\nIt all started when I was ten and moved into Gray Hill. By the time that I was locked up I had lived there for so long that I hardly remember where we moved from.\n\nHome was a small hobby farm with enough room for a small field, a garden and some chickens. \n\nGardening was a learning process because the chickens would always pick the seeds from the ground. Once we got the fence set up around the garden to protect it we focused on a better coop for the chickens. \n\nWe planted alfalfa in the fields and the first year was pretty much a bust as far as my dad was concerned. To me it was impressive though I had less to compare it to than my father did and I was at the age where it did not take much to impress me.\n\n“It looks good to me” I said to my father, looking at the silo full of silage and the bales of hay in the shed. “Why do you think it isnt enough?” I added.\n\n“This might be enough for our own stock this winter” my dad answered with a shake of his head. “But I was hoping that we could sell some hay for a profit”.\n\nThankfully the following years were more fruitful than the first because we started killing the mice that were eating our profits.\n\nMy dad figured that the best way to kill them was a bucket half full of water. Put some bait on the end of a string, tie it to a stick and then lay that stick over the width of the bucket. By the end of the week we would have close to two dozen dead mice in each of the traps we placed around the property. \n\nI felt bad for them at first but stopped when I saw the damage they could do.\n\nMy dad taught me a lot. Not just about the barn but about life and how to be a good person. So when he died my senior year by slipping on the ice while doing barn chores it was really hard on me. In order to take my mind off the pain I focused on doing things around the farm while my mom handled it by drinking. \n\nBefore I graduated highschool she died while driving drunk.\n\nThat summer I went into the shed to retrieve the lawn mower and saw one of the buckets we use to catch mice. Balancing on the string was a mouse and as soon as it saw me it must have surprised the bastard because it fell into the water. \n\nGiving it no mind I decided to mow the parts of the lawn I was planning on doing that day. Usually each day I do a third of the lawn and it takes the better part of an hour. When I finished I returned the lawn mower and looked in the bucket. There was the mouse, struggling to stay afloat.\n\nFeeling bad I picked it up by its tail and lifted it to the table beside me. Even if it does eat some of the crops which we were dependent on I still could not let it suffer like that. \n\nAs I laid it on the table it just laid down where I put it, exhausted and breathing rapidly. Even for a mouse its breath was heavy and I swear I could hear it even as I left the garage. Before I left I shot a glance behind me and when I did I swear that it was thanking me.\n\nSome time later, maybe the following week an uncle of mine came over to the house to drop off a trailer and store it in one of the sheds. An arrangement he had with my father.\n\n“Hey, can you help me?” my uncle asked after I answered the door.\n\n“Sure” I said with a smile and went to fetch my shoes. \n\nI really don't like my uncle because he likes to belittle me whenever he gets the chance. I think its his way of over compensating for the fact he was abandoned by his biological parents when he was a baby. Still though, he is family so I felt that I needed to help. \n\n“Will you be here later today?” he asked after I helped him back up the boat into the shed.\n\n“No” I answered. \"I have plans with Marilyn this afternoon.\"\n\n“Well I am going to be here between two and five to drop off a boat and again a few hours after that so you will have to be here to help.”\n\n“I got plans”.\n\n“You said that” my uncle said, “but you are going to have to be here during those times”.\n\n I was really close to telling him off then but then it occurred to me that he likes to show off his money whenever he could so I decided to say, “I don’t remember you paying for storage this year”.\n\n“Well” he said laughing. “I, well...”\n\n“That's just storage and doesn't include my labor fees” I said with a smile. For far too long this asshole has taken advantage of the generosity of both me and my father. That stops now.\n\n“Whoa, hold on a second” my uncle said before getting back in his truck.\n\n“This year has been tough on me. Dad dying and all that” I say as I make my way back to the house without looking back at him.\n\n“I know, but—”\n\n“And money is tough” I said, tired of hinting that this was a demand. “And since you are a good Christian who looks out for your fellow man, plus the fact that you didn’t make it to your brother-in laws funeral, I think that maybe these fees should increase, don’t you?”\n\n“What?” my uncle laughed. “No”.\n\n“Well I do” I said, turning back around to head to the house.\n\nMy uncle left a short while later. That was the last time I saw him alive. On the twenty minute drive to his house his brakes went out and he got wrapped around a tree.\n\nAt his funeral I was told that this accident happened because a mouse chewed on the brake lines.\n\n*Now.*\n\n“What do you see?” Phillis asks as she flips over another Rorschach inkblot. \n\nI see an orange glow over the hill after a night of drinking.\n\n“A man in a gangster hat.” I say trying to read the books on the shelf. “You know, Capone in the movies?” \n\nThe books in her office don't appear to be related to psychology in any way. ‘Bacteriophage: Biology, Correction, and Display’, ‘Anatomy of American Pan Fish’ and ‘Superconducting Fibrification Of Neural Dendrites: Shielded Bioelectric Conduction’ among dozens of others. \n\n“And this?” she asks as she flips over another card. This time I see the last time I saw my mother alive.\n\n“A beret,” I answer.\n\nI hear a soft squeak somewhere in the walls but I ignore it.\n\nPhyllis flips the next card without talking.\n\nI see the fire which brought me here to the nut house and the paramedics who had to sedate me.\n\n“A large straw hat”.\n\n“This?” she asked, bored with how little information I was giving her.\n\nI look at the card she layed out. I see everyone calling me a murderer as I get dragged into the courthouse. \n\n“A hard hat” I answer, almost saying “firefighters helmet” a second time.\n\n“Lots of hats today” she says with no hidden disappointment.\n\n“How much longer” I ask with an equally bored expression.\n\n“You gotta be anywhere?” she asked, snarkily.\n\n“I gotta make a tin foil hat” I joke.\n\nShe sets down the card after giving me a hurt expression. Another moment of silence as she was putting the cards away in her small bag I hear another squeak in the walls. I almost ask her if she hears it but before I do she asks me if I wanted to talk.\n\nI shrug even though the answer is a hard no. Still, there isn't much else to do in Goose Creek Sanitarium so I ask her “What about?” \n\n“I don’t know. Anything” she suggests. She leans forward and smiles before setting the pen on her lip and adds “You pick”.\n\n“Is today Wednesday?”\n\n“Yes. Why?” she asks, confused.\n\n“It's meatloaf,” I say disappointedly. “I don’t like the meatloaf here”.\n\n“Want to talk about your uncle” she asked suddenly. Her question startles me because they usually ask me about Marilyn. This was the first time they brought him up and it is more than a little surprising.\n\n“Which one?” I ask. “I have six of them.”\n\n“The one that died” she says a little more firmly.\n\n“What about him?” I ask playing dumb. “Went off the road and hit a tree”.\n\n“How did his death make you feel?” \n\n“Terrible thing.”\n\nShe nods. “Any good times with him?” She adds after a moment.\n\nI am very still and I am unable to think of one good time I had with the man. Finally the doctor changes the subject.\n\n“What about Marilyn?”\n\nI know that a shot of anger must have been seen in my eyes when I looked up from the tile floor because my doctor flinches, then she smiles. I hate her for that fucking smile.\n\n“I love her” I say, nearly breaking down and rambling. If I started I would not be able to but I stop myself so I don't say anything. In that silence I think of all the things Marilyn and I did together. All the times we made love, laughed at the same dumb jokes, building chicken coops, swimming in nearby lakes and rivers as well as eating the lunch I packed for our picnics. Whenever she picked the location it was the small airport where the small single engine planes would fly over once every few hours. I didn't know what she saw in the location or why it was her favorite place at the time, but Marilyn would later explain to me that she loved the sound of the plane engines. To her it was freedom to go wherever she wanted, to do whatever she wanted. \n\nTo finally leave that dead end of a town once and for all. \n\nRemembering this about the love of my life my chin trembles. I think of all the things I never said and all the things I would never get a chance to say again. \n\nSqueak.\n\nThe water works kick in and the tears flow.\n\nNone of it is an act. \n\nI know that she is going to want to talk about this ‘major step forward’ at our next session as she tells me to let it all out and that crying is healing.\n\n“How did she die?”\n\nI tell Phyllis two truths and a lie.\n\n*Then.*\n\nMarilyn always accused me of never listening to her but never seemed to remember the little things I did for her. I know I did things that annoyed her too but we loved each other. \n\nIt was about a month after my uncle's funeral that I planned to pop the question. My plan was for us to go canoeing on one of the last good weekends of the year. Once we got to the right spot I acted like finding a small waterfall was an accidental discovery. We crouched under the waterfall and when we were behind it I went down to one knee to propose. \n\nWhen she said yes I became the happiest man on earth.\n\nI kept my nose out of most of the planning since Marilyn was better at these kinds of things. The only thing I wanted was the location of the wedding to be at the church I went to since I was a kid, Jesus on Main here in Gray Hill. However Marilyn had her heart set on it being a destination wedding.\n\nWe argued about it. She said a destination wedding would be more romantic than a church that smelt of ammonia and vomit. While I agreed with that point (and argued that it could be held outside) lots of the people we knew wouldn't be able to go if going meant getting a plane ticket. \n\nMaybe I am not wording that correctly. We didn't argue. We disagreed. It never got louder than talking. In fact Marilyn would get quiet when she got mad so people would quiet down in order to hear her. \n\nI never yelled. At least at people. I shouted at equipment failures and inanimate objects when things didn't go my way but I rarely shouted at people.\n\nWhat really made everything come to a boil was when her mom wanted to micromanage everything. Not only that, she wanted to come and stay with us for the months before we got married for some reason. I’ll admit, this caused me to shout because her mom was nice but only in small doses. \n\nI told Marilyn that I didn't want her mother staying here. If she wanted to micromanage the wedding that was one thing, but I wouldnt allow that vile woman in my house. We talked about this at length and I thought I convinced Marilyn of my way of thinking. Then one day I was coming into the house from raking the alfalfa fields only to see the two of them unloading her mothers car. Obviously with the intention of an extended stay considering how many bags she brought with her.\n\nI pulled Marilyn aside and spoke with her. Quietly at first but soon I started to yell about the goblin she has as a mother in the other room and I didnt give a damn if she heard me. \n\nMarilyn said that it was her house too but I countered this by saying we were not married yet and the house was in my name. I wanted that woman out of my house and when this was refused I had to leave to clear my head. \n\nWhen I left the house I didn't have a destination in mind so I drove straight to Moes Bar. \n\nWhile there I was pretty vocal about my distaste for Marilyns mother. I was there for perhaps two hours by the time I heard the fire engines roaring past. \n\nThe more I drank, the more I spoke ill of her until finally I was cut off and told to go home.\n\nBegrudgingly I did just that and even though I was drunk as a skunk I was allowed to drive home. Something I should not have done but at the time I didn't care. \n\nAround the twists and turns so commonly found in Gray Hill an orange glow came into view. The closer I got home the brighter it got until I finally saw my house on fire.\n\nI pulled into the driveway and when a firefighter told me to turn around I pushed him out of my way, explaining that it was my house. I screamed for Marilyn. I even shouted for her mother but then someone told me that they didn't make it out.\n\nBetween the screaming and the crying the rest of that night is a blur. I must have passed out because the next thing I knew was that I was in the police station and being charged with arson.\n\n*Now*\n\nIt used to be that the mouse would come around occasionally but now it comes around every night.\n\nI know it sounds dumb, worst case makes me sound crazy, but I try speaking to it when I am alone. Thankfully I was given a room all to myself so no one ever sees this. \n\n“Do you think you're helping?” I ask the cursed thing as it just sits there in the duct. “Is that why you're doing this? Get me out of this room, this building you dumb son of a bitch” I beg, hoping it understands. With this the mouse scurries off, where to I don’t know.\n\nI nearly laugh. Did I really expect it to understand me? Am I really insane or am I just that lonely?\n\nI want to cry, instead I sit in the corner of my dirty cell and feel sorry for myself because there isn't much else I can do under the circumstances. \n\nWithout a clock or a window I have no idea what time it is or how much time has passed before the mouse returns. This time with the lanyard of an orderly who I remember overhearing lost his some time ago.\n\nI don’t know how the mouse managed to obtain it and I have no idea what I should do with it. It's not like I can unlock my cell from the inside. It leaves again the same way it came, through the vents. \n\nPerhaps an hour later I [caught a whiff of smoke](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhisperAlleyEchos/comments/wsvf49/headline_goose_creek_sanitarium_sold/).\n\nA few agonizing moments pass and I wonder why I’m not hearing an alarm. Shouldn't the doors open if there is an emergency?\n\nOther patients start waking up to the smell and start screaming. This only wakes up the others who also start to scream. Soon the sound is ear piercing. \n\nThe smell of smoke is overwhelming now. There is a very good chance of this being the end. I consider praying even though God and I aren't on the best terms considering everything that led to me being here. \n\nRight when I am about to kneel and clasp my hands together in prayer I hear a familiar squeak at the door. It's the mouse that has haunted me ever since I saved its life. \n\nFor a moment I think it's here to gloat about my impending death but a moment later the door begins to open up. At first I thought the mouse had somehow opened it but how could that be? There must have been an emergency switch that was pulled that released me. \n\nI rush for the door and am greeted by blinding smoke. As I start to cough I remember the lessons I learned while on a school trip to the firehouse: Smoke rises so I should crawl on my belly so I dont inhale the smoke.\n\nI get on my belly and crawl to the exit but soon I get turned around.  I should know where the exit is, God knows I thought about rushing towards it and running away enough times. Perhaps it is the new perspective of being on the ground, the adrenaline of being in a fire or both?\n\nJust before I start to panic another squeak is heard. \n\nExhausted of options I crawl towards the sound and after far too many hallways I come to a door. I reach up to open it and when I do I realize that I am not where the inmates go to get some fresh air. I am in the employee parking lot. \n\nA man runs to me and helps me up. \n\n“Is there anyone else?” he shouts.\n\nAll I can do is cough. I don’t bother shaking my head.\n\nIn my hand he sees the orderlies ID and when I see him trying to look at it I show him the picture of a man who with a beard and a heavier face.\n\n“Alright Bob” he said pointing to the cars behind him. “The fire department should be here soon. Take my keys and move my car so they can get to the fire hydrant” he says while jabbing his finger to the blue station wagon. “I’m going in” he adds as he turns to run into the building.\n\nAs my coughing fit subsides I look at the keys in my hand, the ID in the other and wonder what the hell just happened. Behind me his car is next to the fire hydrant. He must have seen the fire and parked wherever so he could help those inside. \n\nThat’s when I hear a squeak by my feet. When I look down I see the mouse looking up to me. Its eyes are big and black. It reminds me of my dog, Wyoming, after it brought a dead bird in the house and wondered if its a good dog for bringing it in.\n\nI told myself that if the day ever comes when I get the chance to kill it I would. If I wanted to I could easily stomp it but I don’t.\n\nIt's the only friend I have left in the world.\n\n“Alright buddy” I say as I kneel down to let it run on my hand and up my sleeve where it rests on my shoulder. “Let's get out of [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhisperAlleyEchos/)”",

        "text": "Whenever I couldn’t sleep as a kid my parents would tell me “Bad things only appear to those who believe in them” and “In all my years I have never seen a ghost and I’m over 30!” I couldn’t understand my parent’s confidence. They were so blatantly ignorant to my childhood fears. Back then, my bedroom window faced South. I enjoyed the natural morning light. It was common for the house behind mine to leave their porch light glowing till daybreak. It kept me awake most times. The old growth tree in my backyard, where my rope-swing once hung, it would cast a cast a shadow into my room. I guess my neighbor had more money than they knew what to do with because, that light was always on. \n\nThe shadow of my rope-swing shifted at night - never too quickly.  The movement was slow and persistent. It spilled into my bedroom like a running bath that overfills its tub. It grew as if the porch light was inching closer with each passing second - ever so persistent…ever so slow. I never saw detailed features of that *thing* of which I was certain. The only evidence I had of **anything** entering my room was the closet door; regardless of my attempt(s) it would be ajar by sunrise.\n\nTime passed and I grew older. My mind grew stronger and my focus was demanded by: high school, friends, car, girlfriend, college. I live alone now. I moved into a studio apartment at my university when my girlfriend broke up with me while she was recovering in rehab. It’s a small space. I can see my whole apartment from the pull out sofa; where I fall asleep most nights. I signed for this place because of the South facing windows. Most so-called luxury apartments nowadays have huge windows. This is one of those. I get radiant morning sun for better or worse. I haven’t found curtains for the windows yet, I know I need to, a good nights sleep has been hard to come by since the pandemic. The break-up just made it worse.\n\nDo you know that feeling you get in the comfort of your home; when all the blinds are open? It’s an uneasy feeling that someone may be watching. I get those feeling at night in particular. I usually feel it most right before I fall asleep - despite being able to see my whole apartment from the living room and bed space. There is a street lamp I can see from my windows. I live on the third floor so the light shines upward from the street into my apartment. It is bright enough to dimly illuminate my apartment at night. I chose the third story because a former tenant and friend of mine mentioned a few break-ins on the first floor apartments during their time in my building. Those units were cheaper when I signed my lease but the extra $150/month was worth my peace of mind. Nevertheless, peace of mind seems hard to come by these days. I haven’t been sleeping well. I haven’t been eating well. I am starting to think I drink too much. My friends don’t see a problem. They say I just miss my ex. girlfriend - it seems that much is clear to them \n\nI have always been a night owl, it was my time to process the day, drink a few beers with good company. There’s a strange comfort in the night. Even at home by myself, looking outside my windows, I get the comfort that I am not alone. I feel part of some larger system. The world is still alive at night but the shadows manufacture stillness. Sunlight exposes the vapid reality we all suffer through. I like knowing the birds are asleep. I like knowing families are at home together. I like knowing that traffic will slow for a few hours.\n\nThere’s a strange comfort in the night. When I can’t sleep, looking out my window (beer in hand lol) brings me peace of mind. It’s not uncommon in my university town to see some stranger across the way gaming or watching TV or studying for homework at any point during the the night. I wonder if they can feel my eyes endlessly scanning for something to make me smile again. \n\nSince I broke up with my girlfriend, I find myself watching more than I used to. I hangout with my buddies less. My anxiety convinces me to stay in. My depression makes me no fun when I’m out. I am increasingly paranoid that someone is watching me because I am guilty of the same **thing** night after night. I need to get some fucking curtains. \n\nLast night the street lamp didn’t shine into my apartment. I fell asleep on the couch watching old episodes of “The X-Files.” I didn’t notice the void until I woke up from my nap. The TV’s power-saver function activated leaving me to scramble for a light - “Why is it so dark in here?” I managed to find my phone. I made the short walk to my window. My confusion grew when I saw the streetlight shining brightly - brighter than ever. The bulb was illuminating the bus stop adjacent but, not my apartment. I rubbed my eyes and waited to adjust. My figure cast no shadow behind me when I turned away from the window. I was engulfed in darkness. I fixated into the void waiting for a single ray of light to show me *any* point of reference. I stood there till sunrise this morning. In the hours since, I started  remember more about that **thing** outside my old bedroom window. I remember I gave it a name. Tonight, I am going to charge-up a couple of old devices to see if The Swing Man appears again. I’ll post a time-lapse video of the windows tomorrow. I’m afraid to believe something bad is going to happen but, I need to know I’m not losing my last **piece** of mind.",

        "text": " I think we made the best decision we could have with the teeth last week. I mean, they seemed dead, right? After the... incident, we swept them up and dumped them in the garbage outside. Yeah, I know, sentient hungry teeth probably fall under the jurisdiction of the \"hazardous waste\" sticker, but I wasn't about to bag them up and keep them around.\n\nWell, it turns out that my instinct to not keep them in the shop or on hand was a good one because they aren't dead. Dormant would be a better word, or perhaps hibernating. They ate enough and were not hungry. I can only imagine that those teeth are the reason for the issue we had this week and *will* be having for the coming weeks, assuming we can even fix it. How does one kill teeth? I am afraid to look that up, I don't want to be put on a list for googling \"how to destroy teeth.\" Plus, who knows if they even are actual teeth or just look like them.\n\nIf you're new here, you are probably very confused. Start [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/AHauntedBarista/comments/11dsc3v/the_drowsy_spectre/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) if you want some context.\n\nAnyway, teeth. Is there some sort of supernatural dentist to get rid of these? Someone mentioned a tooth fairy, but I've never heard of any fairytale where the teeth fought back. I don't want “killed a tooth fairy” on my resume.\n\nA day or two after my previous post, we started to see the symptoms of what I am calling a plague. A pandemic of teeth, the Bite of ‘23, if you will. Most of the customers affected were acting pretty normal when they came into the shop. Nothing in their behavior changed, other than the silence. The regulars knew we were aware of what they wanted, anyone new that was affected tried their best to communicate with their hands.\n\nBecause they had teeth lodged in their flesh. Sometimes it was just one, others had a handful. Some on their faces, hands, arms. Eyes, mouth (aside from their own teeth, of course). Amber was unaffected, though. Last week we had all but forgotten her, slightly off camera and sitting in the rain. The teeth had taken Heartmin but paid Amber no mind at all. Did she know something we didn't? Maybe she could dissuade whatever force was causing the infection.\n\nSo, when I came in for my shift, I arrived a bit early.\n\nThat seemed to please her. \"Axel!\" I shivered and had to physically freeze in place to recover. \"You wanted to see me?\"\n\n\"Yes. How did you know that?\"\n\nShe crossed her arms. \"Because you came in early.\" The trunk of her old hatchback opened on its own.\n\n\"You've seen the teeth?\"\n\nAmber nodded. \"The *kepsi*? Of course. I saw it eat up the screamer.\"\n\n\"*Kepsi*?\"\n\n\"Axel, you should know. You made it real, after all. This isn't your attempt at clearing the forest of dangers?\"\n\nI wish it was. \"No, I don't know what is going on and I didn't make this. This isn't me.\"\n\n\"But it told me. It is from the void, created by your witness.\" Her voice deepened and light faded. My head was light and I was on my knees just to stay conscious. \"*You gazed upon it sweetly.\"* Was the ground shaking? What the hell was Amber?!\n\nThen everything was as it was. \"If that wasn't intentional, I am curious how you will clean up this mess.\" She tapped a cardboard box. \"Though, most odors can be beaten by a good candle. Maybe now is the time?\"\n\nI got to my feet. \"I'm not buying a candle.\" That was the most important rule. \"None of us are.\"\n\n\"So you say.\" She lifted the box. \"But I am patient.\"\n\n\\--------------------------------------\n\nDuring the shift, we saw a similar situation as the day before. The teeth still bore into most customers that had flesh, sparing only those without any meat to consume. When we slowed down and it was dark, it got really windy. No rain this time, thankfully. But I could see the trees bending outside under the parking lot's old light. It was burning out and painted the area in a deep orange. Out there, near the quiet highway that was seldom traveled, stood a small figure.\n\nNot so small as the doll that I hid in my apartment. No, they must have been a kid. The light reached them so I could tell they weren't like the guy last week, covered in teeth. From the distance I thought they just looked like a normal kid. Maybe eight, or nine years old? No movement, no swaying in the wind. They just faced the shop.\n\nI wasn't that concerned and neither were Barrow or Em. Dr. Fields, who we have decided to call Nomic because he can't remember his life, did not see it as we did. He had no doubt that the child outside was staring directly at him.\n\n\"Can't we just tell them to leave?\" He asked, coming up from the kitchen. \"They are loitering.\"\n\nOh, yeah. Nomic is officially on the team to replace Dan since we haven't seen him since he left. Seeing as Nomic has no memories or life outside of the café, he adjusted pretty well. That stare, however, unsettled him.\n\n\"Like just open the door and tell them to order something or leave.\"\n\nBarrow was making a drink for the drive thru. \"Seems like a bad idea but be my guest.\"\n\nAnd he did. Nomic walked up to the door and pushed it open, but did not step outside. \"Hey, you can't just stand around out there!\"\n\nThey didn't react.\n\n\"Come inside or leave!\"\n\nSuddenly the kid broke into a sprint straight towards the door. In seconds they had closed the gap and were on the other side of the parking lot. Nomic slammed it shut and locked it just as the child dashed under the overhang and stopped perfectly at the full size window next to the door.\n\nWe could see then that the kids' eyes were completely black, like the night sky without stars. They didn't catch light, nor were they reflective like any other gaze. They were just... dark.\n\nAnd on its cheek was a single white tooth, human from the looks of it, and it was buried into the flesh. The wound leaked a black puss.\n\n\"Do you have a phone? I need to call my parents.\"\n\nNomic glanced at us behind the counter and we shook our heads. He already knew that we weren't letting them in.\n\nThey looked like a young boy. \"I am lost and it is getting really cold out here. Can I just use the phone?\" Nomic backed away from the door, the kid's eyes locked onto him. \"Please? It is terrifying out here! I'm so scared!\"\n\nFrom the woods around the highway came more small figures. Dozens, at least. They were all walking towards the front door.\n\n\"I just need to make a call. I'm hurt.\" He touched the wound on his cheek. The tooth responded to his voice by wiggling a little bit. \"Just let me in! I'm just a kid!\"\n\nThe others got closer. I could see details on most. Black eyes on them all, all children, and each with their own teeth attacking their flesh. Some had half their face covered, others only a single fang through their clothes, some just like the first boy. They crossed the parking lot and stood against the window in a line.\n\nThe first boy slammed his little fists against the window. \"Let me in!\"\n\nA girl no older than four joined in. \"Let me in!\"\n\nMore started to hit the glass, but it took no damage. \"LET US IN!\"\n\nA knocking on my right tore me from the front door. There, at the drive thru window, was another kid. She barely reached the lip. \"You did this!\" She cried, little hands covered in dental burrows. \"Let us IN!\"\n\nSlam. Bang. Both fists trying to break through the thick glass. There was a little sticker on the top right of the window that said \"large missile impact resistant\" so I assumed I was safe. The front door was a bigger concern.\n\nOne of the kids started pulling hard at the door, but it wouldn't open because Nomic had the foresight to lock it. That didn't stop them from trying. Glass failed to shatter under their assault, or even crack. I don't think they were able to enter that way, it all seemed a big but empty threat.\n\nBarrow confirmed this. \"We are fine as long as they don't come in.\"\n\n\"Even the kids have the teeth.\" Em murmured. \"Is it really that bad?\"\n\n\"Pretty much everyone does.\" I had seen tons of customers, as had she.\n\nSelene finally stepped out of the office. \"Oh. Do they think we have the cure or something?\"\n\nEm winced. \"Even if we did, I don't think threatening us is going to get anything.\"\n\n\"We have some medicine, you know.\" We both had a headache after the past few days, brought on by the stress of irritated customers. \"Just take some.\"\n\n\"Probably isn't safe for a pixie to take.\"\n\n\"Yeah but you're half human at least, right?\"\n\nShe didn't like that. \"Y-yeah, I guess.\" Again, she winced hard and leaned against the counter. \"I just need some quiet.\"\n\nThe kids continued screaming their demands. \"I don't think you are going to get any.\" Barrow sighed. \"What do you think, Selene? They are a bit of a problem.\"\n\n\"I think I am not opening that door.\" She shook her head. \"Being a manager doesn't mean I have to deal with that.\"\n\n\"Doesn't it?\" I quipped.\n\nSelene sighed. \"Probably.\"\n\nThen the sea of kids parted. They stopped their attack on the doors and windows and moved aside, making room for something beyond them. A man with skin nearly dark as the night and long, smokey hair laid over his shoulder. He wore a black suit and a necklace that reached past his chest. A golden symbol hung from it, one that I had seen before.\n\n\"Rykar.\" I muttered.\n\nHe reached the door and glanced down at the first child, who had started the assault. Rykar picked the tooth from his face, holding it in his gloved hands. It wiggled about, trying to find purchase where there was none. Finally, he shrugged and casted it aside. I saw it land on the face of another child, grabbing onto the skin instantly. She didn't react.\n\nRykar lifted his cane and tapped on the door. \"Won't you let me in?\" The question was directed at their manager.\n\n\"Go away.\"\n\n\"Oh, but I have a few questions. Specifically regarding this... tooth issue. Curious thing, your little friend concocted.\" Rykar nodded at me. \"It has been quite a bit of time, Axel. I am curious, who has your name?\"\n\n\"I said go away. You aren't welcome here.\" Selene was firm. \"Take the children with you.\"\n\n\"Oh but these aren't mine.\" He looked down at them. \"Look at their eyes. So dark, so deep like the void. I think they belong to another Witness, wouldn't you say? Perhaps something even older. But they are flesh, all the same. I don't want to interrupt whatever this-\" He gestured at the crowd. \"-is, but I think Axel and I need to set an appointment. Don't we, friend?\"\n\nAll of them looked in my direction, but what was I supposed to say? No one knew about the deal I had made with that devil. \"Not here.\" Was all I could manage.\n\n\"Of course. Maybe on a day you don't work. I can come to your apartment, after all.\" He lowered his cane from the door. \"And, in case any of you were curious, your dear friend John has had quite the time under my care.\"\n\nFrom behind the children came John DeGuire. His face was covered in teeth, but his eyes didn't speak of any pain. He was resigned to whatever fate Rykar had for him. Still, he was silent so as to avoid the loss of his flesh. Though, for all the strength he placed on his face, I did see a gentle tear escape his now yellow eyes.\n\n\"We've had more fun than with his brother, I'd say. It is too bad Dan never got to experience this plague of teeth.\" Rykar looked John up and down. \"Say something to your friends, why don't you?\"\n\n\"Stop!\" Em demanded. So did I, but it was no use.\n\nRkyar slammed his cane into the ground. \"Say something!\"\n\n\"H-help me...\" The teeth wiggled about, taking little bits of skin to make more of themselves.\n\n\"That's all you have to say? You haven't seen your friends in months. Come on, catch up!\"\n\nJohn opened his mouth again and spoke, but it was too quiet to hear. His disease dug deeper.\n\n\"Too bad. You know how shy he is.\" Rykar threw up his hands. \"So, what do you say, Axel? I do believe you have off Monday, so why don't I stop by? Maybe I'll even bring John along too.\"\n\n\"Fine, but leave him alone.\" I raised my voice to be certain he heard behind the closed door. \"Just leave!\"\n\nRykar nodded. \"Very well. I was so hoping Dan would be around.\" He waved his cane, shoeing John along. \"They've got a long shift to finish.\" Lastly, before he finally left, he turned his neck to face Selene. \"And I heard you saw father. We *both* don't want him awake, so don't do that again.\"\n\nWith that, the children resumed their assault and Rykar was lost in the crowd. The kids probably wouldn't leave until sunrise.\n\n\"Why does Rykar want to meet with you?\" Barrow asked.\n\nThey didn't need to know. \"We will find out on Monday, won't we?\"\n\n\"Who was that?\" We'd forgotten about Nomic, who stood just within the kitchen. \"W-who was that?\"\n\nThere was a long history that he'd need to learn. \"Rykar. Someone you should never speak to.\" That was all he needed to know for now.\n\nI was standing by the drive thru and saw movement. Was that Tall Ben on the camera, standing near the back door? I couldn't see his face, but it had to be him. We aren't supposed to talk to him, it often resulted in terrible accidents, but even in the poor quality of the camera I could see something on his face. Something that didn't belong, something white.\n\n\"I'm going to use the bathroom.\" I lied, then dipped from the front praying that no one else would take a look at the camera. I opened the back door, but did not step outside.\n\nSure enough, there stood the giant. In a long gash next to his eye was a wound embedded with little white teeth from all sorts of creatures. He lifted his hand to touch the wound, revealing a similar issue with his fingers and right palm.\n\n\"Help.\" He asked it so simply. No deception, no tricks. \"Help me.\"\n\nThis thing had killed a friend, strangers, and who knows what else. He was the reason John belonged to Rykar, was the cause of a great number of our issues. Did Tall Ben really think I was going to offer him assistance? It'd be best if he died from this new wound!\n\n\"Please. Take them off...\" They squirmed at his voice. \"We are friends, please help me.\"\n\nI did consider it. Last time he perceived me as doing him a favor, he said he would offer me the answer to any question. If Tall Ben offered that again, I would have a huge advantage against any future issues I might face. I was already in the habit of making deals with supernatural creatures, what was one more?\n\nInstead, I closed the door. He couldn't cry out, roar, lose his mind with anger, or react in any way without the teeth consuming him. Instead, it was entirely quiet until the door clicked shut. Maybe the tooth plague was a good thing, in the end.\n\nIf it killed Tall Ben, I'd be happy.",

        "text": "I love my husband. I know he kept secrets. Every marriage has them. You can either recognize it and move on or lie to yourselves like all the other self-medicated fucks with an IV full of Housewives and a drum full of honey-fried chicken wings. Nevertheless, a friend of mine once opined that outright *deception* in a relationship is like lying to your left lung. Some people can breathe that way just fine all their lives. Others can’t. I knew for sure from a young age that I never could be that type of girl. The type that nodded and smiled sweetly and said things that didn’t make any sense. That just wasn’t me. \n\nOne morning, John woke up sick. He tried to hide it from me, but the creaking floorboards couldn’t conceal his clumsy footsteps, and the thin walls did nothing to mask his cat-like wretches. I laid awake for a while listening to him cough and gag. This wasn’t the first time that week. It wouldn’t be the last. Something was wrong. I just couldn’t comprehend what would cause him to lie about it. \n\n“Honey,” I eventually called out. “Are you alright in there?”\n\n“Uh-huh,” he shouted excitedly. “Fine. Totally fine. Didn’t mean to wake you up.”\n\nThe drone of a conference call replaced my reply.  A man in monotone mumbled something undoubtedly important about numbers and critical mass. My husband whispered back. The loud fucking light turned on over the sink and the screech of the bath followed. I couldn’t hear much more. \n\nJohn came back out after a shower and a shave. He looked like hot death. His skin was pale. Fresh snot welled up around his nose. Nevertheless, he claimed he would still be going into the office that day. Meetings to be had, budgets to be discussed, important people here, important people there. \n\n“We have a project lined up,” he insisted. “A big one. The type that can finally get us out of this old house.”\n\nWe had argued about the topic before. Nothing could keep my husband from an honest day’s work. I typically played the slacker to his overachieving ladder climber. But this time was different. He breathed differently, as discussed, literally and figuratively. \n\n“You are going to get the whole office sick,” I snapped. “Come on. Stay home. I’ll take care of you,”\n\nHe ignored me and walked over to the closet to pull out a shirt and tie. I rushed out of bed and planted my feet in front of the dresser. He stared back at me. New lines of thin blood leaked from razor nicks on his neck. \n\n“You’re not going in,” I repeated. “Really. Enough is enough. You have worked yourself to the bone for this company. They can allow you a simple day of fucking rest.”\n\nHe eased me aside and pulled back a drawer. \n\n“We get ten days of vacation a year. One work from home day a month. I’ve used up all of that and it’s only February. Plus my director is up my ass. My boss is up my ass. They have us testing this new material.”\n\nI moved back in front of the dresser.\n\n“Ah, what’s the point? You don’t care. I don’t care. Nobody cares. But it’s work that needs to be done, and it pays well, and we don’t make enough money as it is.”\n\nThere it was.\n\n“I’m sorry.”\n\nThe dagger.\n\n“I didn’t mean anything by it. But my new thing will get us out of this shit-hole. I promise.” \n\nHe reached for the pant drawer. \n\n“Did you know the toilet in there only flushes when you hold down the plunger?”\n\nI disappeared into the basement. I heard the door slam sometime later. I didn’t get up to investigate. I was pissed.\n\n“Goodbye,” he shouted. “I love you.” \n\nJohn got home late that night, sometime after eight, as announced by his hacking coughs and relentless sneezes. I greeted him in the kitchen with some tea and cold medicine. He shrugged it aside and collapsed into a chair. Sweat leaked out from the armpits and belly of his button down blue shirt.\n\n“No tea,” he groaned. “Water. Please.”\n\nI nodded and went to fetch it. He grabbed the glass and winced in pain when a little spilled on his hand. That’s when I noticed the rash. Bright red blisters formed at the joint of his collarbone and shoulder. Some were popped, some not. I pulled down the fabric and saw the cuts snake all the way down his arm. \n\n“Are these all new?” \n\nHe nodded painfully.\n\n“I only touched it once,” he whispered. “It was an accident. They don’t know. They can’t. They wouldn’t… if they knew I touched it, they wouldn’t have let me leave. Right?”\n\nI grabbed his hand. The skin felt loose. \n\n“Slow down. What did you touch?”\n\nHe considered the question for a second. \n\n“Nothing,” he muttered. “I don’t know. I’m fine.”\n\n“Clearly not,” I laughed. “You need to see someone.”\n\n“No,” he sighed. “I’m fine. Please. They’ll know.”\n\nI relented in a compromise to see a doctor in the morning. We slept in separate beds that night. I set up cooling pads in the guest room and brought in a half dozen humidifiers. The room had an awkward sort of glow to it with all the different lights. The aromas made it feel kind of like an underground rub-n-tug. John traipsed in and buried himself under the covers.  I kissed his forehead and it felt cool and clammy, but not feverish. I had hoped that meant the effects were subsiding. \n\n“Thank you,” he kissed me. “This helps.”\n\n“Doctor tomorrow,” I repeated. \n\n“Doctor tomorrow,” he agreed. \n\nI watched television for a little while. John fell asleep before me. The raspiness of his snore mixed in with the drone of the rain. I fell asleep to the episode of *Friends* where Monica gets her head stuck inside of a chicken. \n\nI woke up to a skittering in the halls. \n\nI don’t know any other way to describe it. We have two cats. Sometimes they chase each other around in the night. This would be like that if the cats were the size of bulls. Picture frames fell down the hall. The walls buckled. The floor shook. Something enormous growled and something bigger hissed back in response. I reached for my phone on the nightstand and slammed the screen with half open eyes. \n\nThree in the morning. \n\nThe house grew quiet. I waited hopefully for my husband to get out of bed. I assumed an animal got inside. I knew he kept a baseball bat in both closets. I wished then that we had a gun. I could hear this low sort of vibration. I reached around and felt for the source. I realized then that both cats were in bed with me. They stared back with wide eyes piteously. \n\nThe house was still quiet. \n\nA loose floorboard creaked by the bathroom. Then another one in the kitchen. A door creaked open. Then silence. All of a sudden a rush of scattered footsteps sprinted for the dining room. My china cabinet fell along the way. A voice howled an oddly interpretable victory as the remains of my teetering glass figurines shattered into pieces all over the floor.\n\nI got out of bed. \n\nI am not a formidable girl. I don’t have any fight experience whatsoever. I tend to be more well versed on the flight side of things and every instinct in my body told me to get the fuck out of that house. There are no windows in my bedroom. I was on the second floor. I needed to make it down the stairs and out the front door for my plan to succeed. I reached into the closet and found the back up bat for safekeeping. \n\nThe floorboard outside my bedroom only creaks if it’s hit dead-on. I danced around that broken motherfucker like a ballerina. I looked in the guest bed and saw my husband wasn’t in it. I should have stopped there. But something urged me forward. Call that curiosity or just plain stupidity.\n\nThe stairs only squeak if you rush. I took them one at a time, careful to place half my weight on the proceeding one before continuing. I could hear a mashing sound from the dining room. Something was eating. Something big. It ripped and gnawed hungrily along the broken glass pieces from the cabinets. \n\nI turned the corner and wished I didn’t. \n\nMy husband was laid down across the floor. He was dead, as evidenced by the blood covered wound on his neck, and the glazed look in his eyes. Something was eating him. I couldn’t see the full shape of it at first. His legs pulled and ripped like a broken antelope on the savanna before his entire body flipped over in favor of the meatier backside. \n\nI held the bat over my head. My feet followed their one foot after the other routine. Time slowed to a crawl. I could hear my every breath. Then a voice completely shook my battle trance. \n\n“Honey?” \n\nThe corpse went still as the shape behind it stood up. It was him. My husband walked over to me gracefully. Blood dripped down from his lips. He wiped at it awkwardly, like he’d just been caught snacking on ice cream. The blisters were gone. All of the sickness from the previous day seemed to be erased. He smiled and gestured smoothly at his own body on the floor. \n\n“What the fuck?”\n\n“I can explain that,” he whispered. “Why don’t you just relax?” \n\nI swung once and the bat connected with his jaw. He grimaced for a second, looked back at me, and grinned. \n\n“I made a mistake, honey,” he started. “White Valley made it right. Good as new. New me. Can’t you see? I’m fine. Really. I am completely fine.”\n\nI hit him again. \n\n“Honestly. We are good,” he spit out a tooth. “But we won’t be if you keep this up.”\n\nJohn reached for the bat and the next few moments happened in a blur. I pushed him back, he fell to the floor, and I went for the door. I found the handle and raced out into the cold before remembering my keys. I opened the door one last time and snatched them from the ring. I looked into the house one more time and noticed John wasn’t chasing me. He had returned to the corpse of himself on the floor, with a long knife at the ready, tearing apart the easy bits. \n\n‘\n\nI did all of the things you might expect. I called the cops and asked them to check the house. He wasn’t there. I had somebody go and pick up my cats. They were fine. I tried to put that night behind me as some sort of bizarre fever dream. John never tried to contact me. I never tried to contact him. I told my parents we were done. They didn’t press me on why. They never really trusted him anyway. \n\nI returned to the house this morning for the first time in a long time. It felt eerie being there again. I took about an hour to pack some boxes and move stuff around for the eventual sale. I caught my reflection in the mirror towards the end of the trip. I looked haggard and exhausted. The bags under my eyes had bags. I felt sick.\n\nAnd I almost didn’t see it, and never would have noticed, had it not been for the placement of that mirror in the bathroom. A bright red blister appeared on my neck. I watched as it popped right in front of my eyes. \n\nI found two more in the last hour. \n\nSomething is happening. I don’t want to end up like him.\n\nPlease help me.",

        "text": "It was a beautiful Victorian-style home that had been abandoned for years. It was cheap, and I thought I had hit the jackpot.\n\nThe first few weeks were great. I was slowly getting settled in, and I had even made some new friends in the neighborhood. But then things started to change. It started with small things, like hearing footsteps in the hallway when I knew I was alone, or feeling like I was being watched when I was in the shower.\n\nI tried to brush it off as my imagination, but then things started to get more intense. I would wake up in the middle of the night to find my things had been moved around, and there were strange marks on the walls. I even found a piece of paper with a strange symbol on it under my pillow one morning.\n\nI started to feel like I was losing my mind. I couldn't explain what was happening, and no one believed me when I tried to tell them. They all thought I was just being paranoid.\n\nThen one night, I saw her. It was late, and I was in my bedroom when I saw a figure in the corner of my eye. I turned around, and there she was, standing in the middle of my room. She was wearing a white dress and had long black hair. Her eyes were dark, and she had a sinister smile on her face.\n\nI couldn't move. I was frozen with fear. She started to move closer to me, and I could feel her breath on my face. Then she disappeared.\n\nI didn't sleep that night. I stayed up all night with the lights on, afraid that she would come back. The next day, I decided to do some research on the house. I found out that a family had lived in the house many years ago. The husband had been abusive, and the wife had taken her own life in the house.\n\nI knew then that I had to get out of there. I didn't feel safe in my own home anymore. But it was too late. The house had already claimed me.\n\nEvery night, I would hear strange noises and see things move around on their own. The ghostly figure would appear to me more and more often, and each time she did, she would get closer and closer.\n\nI tried to leave the house, but every time I tried to pack my things, something would stop me. It was like the house was holding me captive, and I couldn't escape.\n\nThen one night, I woke up to find myself in a different room. I didn't remember how I got there, but I knew something was wrong. I could hear strange whispers coming from the walls, and I could feel a presence in the room with me.\n\nThat's when I saw her again. She was standing in front of me, and this time, she wasn't alone. There were other ghostly figures with her, and they all had the same sinister smile on their faces.\n\nI tried to run, but I couldn't move. They were holding me down, and I could feel their cold hands on my skin. They started to whisper in my ear, and I could feel their breath on my face.\n\nI knew then that I was going to die. The ghosts were going to claim me as their own, and there was nothing I could do to stop it. I closed my eyes and waited for the inevitable.\n\nBut then something strange happened. I heard a voice in my head, telling me to fight back. It was like a spark had been ignited inside me, and I suddenly had the strength to push the ghosts away.\n\nI ran out of the room and out of the house as fast as I could. I never looked back. I knew that the ghosts",

        "text": "When I was a child I used to watch a lot of old cartoons like oswald the lucky rabbit, micky mouse, felix the cat and other such things.\nI grew up in the 70s and was absolutely astonished by them, so much so I'd decided to do animation as I got older I began working at a small animation company that made cartoons of this really old restaurant, apparently the owners of the restaurant had died so the sons had decided to keep their business alive by cartoons of the characters in the restaurant. \nThe characters consisted of a bunny, a lion, a deer, a weasel and a wolf.\nThe main star of the show was the wolf named Friday, he was also the star of the show at the restaurant that'd burnt down.\nHonestly out of all the characters that one kinda freaked me out a bit, he just had a really odd smile in most of the posters around the place.\nBut because this was something I'd been wanting to do since I was 11 I ignored it.\nI regret that choice..\nA few months into working there I'd noticed that stuff would randomly go off in my work space and around the building, like lamps would be missing then appear back broken, or pens would go missing only to appear in the bins or the lounge. \nMultiple people complained about it, but management didn't seem very bothered as long as the cartoons were done in time, \nThen a week before the most recent cartoon was supposed to aire someone had crossed out every single panel with Friday on it, only his face though we had spare pieces but not enough for a 8 minute short.\nSo we scrambled and didn't manage it in time only ending up with a haft finished project and a angry management \nThen the rumours began, about some kinda tall demon living in this place, something that didn't like what we were doing to its resting place \nI thought it was kinda bullshit to be honest. \nBut I did listen in and was a bit intrigued with it.\nThen I did some more research on what the cartoons were based on..\nThe restaurant had opened in 1932 and burnt down in 1959, leaving nothing behind. \nIt wasn't the most popular place but it was a local delight and was an unfortunate thing to happen.\nThere was also a lot of reports of a cereal killer from the 60s that people had suspected could be connected to the restaurant. \nBut after a few years everyone had forgotten about the suspension of that.\nAs the murders had stopped \nI thought this was kinda odd, making a cartoon of something that seemed to have been thought to be related to murder but I brushed it off yet again. \nThe next few weeks pasted and the deadline was here once again and this time someone was with the cartoon at all times to make sure it wasn't tampered with yet again. \nBut it was so much worse like that.\nWe'd assigned a co-worker of mine, Wilson to look after the cartoon overnight, he was going to be granted a few days off after this, as repayment for keeping an eye on it \nHe was found in the office and then sound studio..\nThere was so much blood.\nOn all the walls of all the rooms he was in was scribbled in blood\n \"Wilson you weasel! You should know better!\" \nThis was a quote from Friday in one of the episodes \n'Weasel a-way' \nAn episode where Wilson the weasel had been being mean to the others because he was staying up so late, it ended with everyone going to sleep in a massive slumber party.\nThe place was closed for awhile for the investigation \nApparently his eyes were never found and he was bend in ways no human should of ever been able to bend.\nHis horrible ripped up hafts are still burned into my mine..\nAfter that I'd decided to starts looking at other places for a job.\nNow my names bex, like the bunny in the show and before I was going to leave I was asked to stay late and finish some work that'd not been finished, I was promised a hefty sum for it so I did so..\nAs I was almost done I looked at the time 1 am\nSo I'd decided to finish this last panel then head home that was the plan.\nUntil I heard a loud crash from the other room\nI knew the janitor was a old man who was haft blind so thinking he'd been hurt I went to go check on him\nI instead found some kind of demon.\nA monster of mental and bones.\nIt was tall like 7 ft. \nIt had parts and wires exposed, it had a smile so haunting it still makes me wince at the thought of it.\nHis hands were metallic and broken but also stained with dried blood.\nIt'd crashed into a few desks and so had left a mess\nI was frozen and I dropped everything and ran, I heard its awful metal body scrap against the joints and also it crash against multiple things to try get to me.\nI looked back, for a second and it's eyes were like looking into hell itself its face was horrible, torn and broken bone and wire with a cartoon disfigured grin.\nIt was so much worse up close I then saw my opening to get out I wasn't risking the stairs or the elevator so I jumped out the window it was the first story so it wasn't much of a drop, I scrambled to my feet and ran to my car and scrambled for my keys as I got fge car open the thing was pushing itself out the window reaching out for me his head jolting slightly as if it was trying to come off its body I didn't spend any more time there and drove home.\nRunning red lights, and almost hitting a few people on my way back.\nThe next day I'd went back with the police they didn't find that thing but they did find a cult-like emblem all over the walls in a hidden room, along with a few unidentified bodys and few pieces of old junk and tools.\nI never went back into cartoons.\nI didn't want anything to do with anything like that again.\nI'm now 65 and will never forget that horrible thing. \nSo if you ever see a large wolf-like figure just run. \nRun as fast as you can and don't stop until you know its safe.",

        "text": "Hello, My name is Travis Marcella, I'm currently 16, with dark brown hair and pretty skinny. I have green eyes and I'm in 10th grade. Today Is March 4, 2023 and I never expected to be making entries of my life since It was pretty average, but something strange has been happening recently. I'll try to explain what's happening as best as I can.\n\nI was riding my bicycle one evening, my backpack barely hanging onto my shoulders as I went as fast as I could to get home in the pouring rain. I eventually reached my fathers cabin and I quickly scrambled inside.\n\n\"Dad\"? I called out.\n\nThere was no answer and to my dismay, My father was sleeping on the couch. I shook him until he woke up. Today was my birthday and I was not going to allow him to sleep through It.\n\n\"W-Wha... Travis... What are you doing\"?! He said confused.\n\n\"Dad, It's MY Birthday. Come on\"! I said, quickly running to the kitchen and grabbing some candles.\n\nI, then ran to my backpack and took out slightly crushed cake. I set it on the table and started placing the candles on the top.\n\n\"14...15....16\"! I shouted. \"Dad you got all the candles\"! I shouted excitedly.\n\nMy father grumbled as he took out his lighter and set the candles ablaze. I watched intently as flames flickered ever so slightly.\n\nWe sang the birthday song (Well I sang It and he hummed along) and I blew out my candles. I, 16 years of age, obviously wished for a girlfriend. We got some snacks together and watched some TV in the living room.\n\nA couple hours later, my father was asleep again and i was watching some 1990s horror films. I glanced out the window and to my shock I saw a shadow in the corner of my eye.\n\nI screamed and shook my dad. He woke up and i told him what happened. He immediately grabbed his shotgun and slammed open the front door. He ran off into the night and left me alone for what felt like hours. Eventually he came back and told me he had some new house rules in a serious tone. At first, I was confused but then he pulled out a piece of paper and gave it to me. There were only 5 rules but they were odd nonetheless.\n\nRule 1) Do not go outside at night\n\nRule 2) If you see anything strange, tell me.\n\nRule 3) Lock the front door before midnight.\n\nRule 4) Do Not Respond To Any Odd sounds, No Matter How Human They seem.\n\nRule 5) If you ever encounter any- The rest of the rule was scratched out.\n\nI read these rules more than five times, trying to understand these rules clearly but to no avail.\n\n\"Dad, these rules...Don't they seem a bit odd\"? I asked.\n\n\"No, these are the rules you MUST follow\". He said the last part loudly.\n\nI was confused but I dismissed the weird situation and followed the rules. The next couple of days at school were pretty normal, but whenever I was at home.... I keep seeing these-... these shadows... In the corner of my eye. It really freaks me out but my father says it's my imagination playing tricks on me. I think he is keeping something from me.\n\nThe next day, I was at school when Daniel Parker bumped into me, thrusting all of my books and school supplies on the floor. I rushed to pick them up while he laughed and walked away. I gritted my teeth and held back my rage. \"Was there no teachers to deal with this idiot\". I thought.\n\nI heard later on that day that there was a test coming up that was giving the highest score $500. The best part is that it was only for kids who had a C+ or below. I was always a C+ student so I had the advantage. The test was in three days and we were all given study notes.\n\nI went to get on my bike to ride home that day to find out that someone had graffiti written all over my bike along with my tires being stolen. I gritted my teeth and I accidentally bit my cheek. Cursing myself, I grabbed my bike and dragged it home.\n\nI walked home and I saw another shadow in the corner of my eye, running off into the backyard. I ran after it. I watched as it ran deep into the forest that surrounded the cabin that my father and I lived in. I went to run after it but I felt something grab my shoulder. I turned around to see my father. He looked extremely pale and held his shotgun in his hand, torch hanging off of the tip.\n\n\"D-Dad, did you see it\"?! I said hysterically, almost questioning my sanity.\n\n\"What are you talking about\" He lied. \"I saw a deer\". He stated and began to chase after the shadow. I watched in shock as my father chased after the shadow with no fear in his eyes. Maybe he did see a deer and I'm just... going insane.\n\nI lay awake that night, thinking about what was happening. I could almost hear the shadows laughing at me trying to figure out if they were real or not. I took out my phone and scrolled through my contacts. Still empty, what was I even expecting, I watched some old cartoons. Old cartoons always calmed me down, even as a baby. They just, looked cool to me I guess? I got a decent night of rest despite the circumstances.\n\nI woke up and realized I had not studied at all and only had 2 days until the test. I had my mind on studying all day but all my hope for studying was shattered when Daniel Parker bumped into me again. Nothing happened and I sighed with relief and realized in horror that my study notes were missing. I turned back to see him smiling and he ripped my notes to shreds and threw them out.\n\nI wanted to punch him so badly, I wanted him to HURT so badly but I gritted my teeth and sighed in defeat. I walked home as my bike was still not fixed. My father promised to get me some tires today and I doubted that he would even keep his word.\n\nTo my surprise I walked home to see him wide awake, sober, and new tires in the corner of the room. He even helped me assemble them onto my bike. I felt something was off though, usually my father was drunk or sleeping but he seemed much more alert and always had his shotgun near. I saw his trigger finger tensing up randomly. I thanked my dad for the tires and immediately went to my room.\n\nSomething was off with my dad and I expected him to be drunk but I watched as he just kept staring at the windows as if something was playing peek-a-boo. I considered that he might be seeing the shadows as well but that doesn't explain why- My thoughts were interrupted by a knocking on the window. I turned to see the pitch black night but something was a bit off. I squinted and I swear I could make out 8 eyes staring back. I screamed As I immediately realized that whatever it was, it was trying to open the window.\n\nI quickly ran to the window and locked it before it got inside. I watched as it scraped it's spider-like limbs across the window like daggers. I backed away as the window started to crack. I called out to my father but then i heard a shot go off. These things... they were getting into the house.\n\nI quickly ran out of the room to see my father struggling to fend off a giant spider that broke through a nearby window. I ran to my fathers aid and he pointed his finger toward his shotgun on the table nearby. I ran to it but stopped about a foot away before another spider fell from the ceiling, almost onto me. I stood in complete shock as it scurried closer. It was around 4 feet in size and was as wide as the table behind it. It lunged at me and I ducked as it flew over my head. It landed right behind me and I quickly made a grab for the shotgun.\n\nI was able to grab the shotgun as the spider charged, but I was faster. I shot the spider right in its face and quickly finished off the other spider that my father was fighting. I thought it was over when I heard my bedroom window shatter. My blood ran cold as a spider emerged from my room and was charging straight toward me. The shotgun my father owned only held 2 bullets at a time and now it looked like i was about to be trampled when right as it was about to ram into me, a large fire axe slammed into its body and crushed its head.\n\nI looked at my father but all I saw was cold, distant eyes. He brought me to my bedroom after boarding up my window and told me to tell nobody about this. I can hear him right now, fixing up the damage from the spiders. I have to tell someone about this and that's why i'm posting here.\n\nI'm unsure what to make of what's happening but I'll keep in touch... I promise.",

        "text": "Hello, My name is Travis Marcella And Something unexplainable has been happening.. If you would like to know what had happened previously... Go here;\n\nI Didn't sleep well that night but It didn't really matter anyway. My father made me stay home so I could process what happened or something. I honestly don't feel safe around him anymore, It's like he is an entirely different person. I snooped around in his room and found some strange documents about some....research facility? I'm not completely sure but I didn't get a good look at it as my father was about to enter the room. I hid in the closet until he left, which took a painfully long time.\n\nAs i went back to my room, I remembered the rules my father had told me about and realized I had broken rule 4, I had responded to one of the creatures. That didn't explain how those creatures got in downstairs but I assumed that the door wasn't locked or that my father had responded to the things.\n\nI walked out of my room and attempted to open the door...no luck. My father had locked us inside the house for some reason. I searched for my father to confront him but he had left without me realizing.\n\n\"D-Dad\"?! I yelled but got no response.\n\nI looked out the window to see that the sun was setting. My heart dropped as i realized that my dad's shotgun was also gone. I watched as the sun completely dissapeared in the horizon and saw that there was a new moon tonight.\n\nI banged on the front door, desperately hoping that it would break and I could go find my father. It was a stupid idea but surprisingly, I was eventually able to break open the front door of the cabin. I felt a rush of cool air as i realized how cold it was. I went to get a coat but went against it as my father could be in danger at this very moment. I ran off to the treeline behind the cabin and looked for any sign of my father. I realized that there were footprints in the ground that resembled my father's boots. I followed the trail into the forest...\n\nAfter following the trail for a while, I started seeing shadows in the corner of my eye. I shuddered at the thought of me being chased and started picking up my pace. The shadows seemed to be getting closer and closer until I could almost swear I could see 2 giant spiders on my right and 3 on my left.\n\nI kept running when suddenly the shadows hurdled forward and landed a couple feet in front of me. I heard the laughter of children and it made me sick to my stomach. I watched as 5 giant spiders crawled towards me.\n\n\"NO,no no no no no no\"! I screamed as they were almost 3 feet away from me now.\n\nSuddenly I watched as the ground beneath me started cracking and 2 giant claws emerged from the ground and grabbed all 5 spiders and then tried to grab me as well. I barrel rolled out of the way just in time to dodge the giant claws as they sunk back into the earth. Seeing this happen, I continued following my father's footprints and they eventually led me into a clearing.\n\nThe clearing was pretty empty except for a small warehouse in the middle of it. I ran to it and opened the door to see my father on an old looking computer, typing in a report file.\n\n\"Dad-\"! I Said before being immediately cut off.\n\n\"What the hell are you doing here, Travis\"?! He yelled hysterically.\n\nWe both turned to the open door behind us to see about 8 large shadows heading into our direction.\n\n\"Y-You led them to us\"?! He screamed as he grabbed his shotgun.\n\n\"Dad...I-I'm so sorry... I was just worried about you- I Didn't think this would happen\"! I protested.\n\n\"No....This is my fault. I should not have provoked them in the first place. I wish I didn't have to burden you with this, Travis\". He sighed.\n\n\"B-Burden me with what\"? I asked.\n\n\"Go to the computer and type in 1-0-0-1. It will send an emergency response team to this location and maybe...just MAYBE, we will be saved. Stay in the warehouse and DO NOT LEAVE\". He commanded.\n\n\"D-Dad wait, What about you\"? I asked but already knew the answer.\n\n\"I am going to distract them for as long as possible\" He said grimly.\n\nWe parted ways as i closed and locked the warehouse door. I quickly typed in 1-0-0-1 on the computer and a code orange was sent to someone called \"Site Director\". I quickly turned to the only window in the warehouse and stared out, hoping I could see if my father was ok. All I saw was the impossible amount of shadows headed toward where my father ran. I haven't even heard any gunshots yet.\n\nI tried to process what was even happening. I sat down on the floor and started hyperventilating. During the past couple days, I've been questioning my sanity as these shadow spiders or whatever were stalking me and my father. Now, I'm trapped in my dad's secret warehouse where he works for some kind of facility. I tried to wrap my head around this all when I heard the first gunshot, followed by a screech so loud that my ears felt like they were on fire. I covered my ears as more gunshots rang out into the night as well as several more screeches.\n\nAfter a while, to my horror, I stopped hearing any gunshots. I heard the sound of scuttling feet, many feet, as the shadow spiders approached the warehouse. I stopped looking out the window at this point and hid under my fathers desk as the shadow spiders climbed around the warehouse, searching for a way inside.\n\nI saw that a shadow spider had blocked out the window's light and I knew the end was near. Surprisingly, I faintly heard the sound of a helicopter in the distance, followed by what felt like, a mini gun, barreling many bullets into the hull of the warehouse, obliterating many of the shadow spiders in the process. Someone kicked down the door and searched the room. It took a couple seconds before the person found me and escorted me out of the warehouse. They told me to get into the helicopter as all I could do was follow their instructions.\n\nWe flew for what felt like hours and eventually landed on top of some large building that looked like some abandoned office complex. Me and 4 other people climbed down a ladder that led to the front door of the building. I asked where my father was but I was ignored and ushered into some kind of large closet that held a single bed with a desk,a chair, a computer, and a bookcase that filled with books about a bunch of random thing's like \"A Beginner's Guide To Crypozoology\" and \"How To Shoot A Gun\". These books were weird but I also found some comic books as well as a dictionary. I wanted answers but I was stuck in this room.\n\nI'm unable to leave as the door is locked and made of steel but I guess the silver lining is that the computer allows me to access the internet. So many things are happening so fast, I'm not sure what to do at this point.\n\nI will keep in touch with you all, I promise.",

        "text": " Three months ago he got injured on the job. Getting the call from the hospital was the worst day of my life. I don’t think I understood how much I still loved him until I spent a 20 minute drive imagining the ways he could have died. All those stupid fights about how much time he’d been spending at work, the money, not spending enough time with the kids, they all washed away. All I could think was to pray. *Please, God, I can’t do this alone.*\n\nWhat bothers me the most is I don’t know what happened to him that afternoon. He won’t say a word about his work. He never has. But I knew that coming in. He told me on the first date that he couldn’t tell me about it, and I accepted it. It’s hard to accept on the days he comes home stressed. The most I’ve gotten out of him is that he makes deals with programming machines for some sector of the government that commissions his company for… something. Whatever it is earns a good payday. I guess it buys his silence.\n\n“It’s not that different from other jobs. A desk, a computer, obnoxious buzzing lights, soul sucking cubicles. It’s just like The Office. Only difference is none of my co-workers are funny.” That’s what Hank said the last time we fought about him spending so much time at his job.\n\n“So that’s why I’ve never met any of them, then?” I winced as soon as the words left my mouth. We’ve fought more than once about my tendency to want to pry information about his job.\n\n“I spend 50 hours a week with them. Every spare second belongs to you.” He said it with a wink, kissed me on the forehead, and popped open a bottle of beer from the fridge. His usual routine when he didn’t want to talk about it anymore.\n\n“60.”\n\n“What’s that?” he asked as he flopped into his chair and flicked on the TV.\n\n“You work *60* hours a week.”\n\n“Don’t remind me.” He said everything with a smirk. He carried an easiness in his voice, like he always did, but I’d known him long enough to tell that something was bothering him.\n\nWhatever ate at him got worse towards the day of the accident. Our intimacy plummeted to zero. I didn’t let it get to me. I know couples ebb and flow. But we didn’t even spend time together anymore. I missed his touch. Any touch. But I gave him space. I knew stress was a problem for him, even if I didn’t understand why. All he ever wanted to do was sit in his den and watch TV. I ended up spending most of my nights alone. I’d feed the kids, put them to bed, then read for a couple hours in bed. After a few months of this, wine became involved. But it didn’t dull how lonely I’d become. Every night I fell asleep alone. When I woke, he’d already be gone.\n\nThe night before the accident, I woke up sick at two in the morning. *At least I know I’m not pregnant.* I flushed the contents of my stomach and glanced back towards my bed, double checking what I already knew. I was alone. Again. A fleeting thought that told me he didn’t love me anymore flickered into my throat. I pushed it down, composed myself, and threw on some pajamas to go hunt him down.\n\nThe dull glow of TV light shone against the bottom few stairs as I made my way into the basement. Empty beer bottles and stained, wet carpet surrounded his chair, which sat not ten feet from the blaring TV, which wasn’t playing anything, just static. The top of Hank’s head poked over his recliner. Thinking he was sleeping, I straddled onto his lap as smoothly as I could manage, settled my knees around his legs, and looked up into his face. To my shock, he was staring right at me, his red, bloodshot eyes wide open.\n\nIt startled me, but I tried not to show it. I stroked his hair and kissed his ear, but he didn’t move. “Hi, Hank,” I whispered. Still no response. I leaned back up a little quicker than I wanted, showing my frustration. His eyes were still wide open, but he didn’t react to me at all, like he was staring right through me. The TV static blared in my ears. I grabbed the remote and turned it off. The very second the TV went black, Hank jolted upright.\n\nI yelped and jumped back off his chair.\n\n“Turn that back on right now.” I was too stunned to react.\n\n“Turn it back on! I was watching that!” He wasn’t just yelling, he was *screaming.* I fumbled with the remote in my shaking hands, but he ripped it out of my grasp before I could steady myself and flicked the TV back onto the same static. As soon as the static was back on the screen, Hank eased back into his chair and reformed his face into the same blank, unblinking expression.\n\nI cried myself back to sleep that night, harboring thoughts of divorce for the first time in eleven years of marriage.\n\nThe weeks after the accident were even harder. The hospital discharged him after three days, and his extensive care routine had become my job, on top of caring for the house and kids. For reasons that none of the countless specialists Hank’s company brought in and all their extensive testing could explain, the accident left him paralyzed from the waist down. The doctors wired his jaw shut, so every three hours I had to feed him by shoving a straw through his lips that lead to some brown, blended mixture the hospital had supplied me with.\n\nOn top of it all, he couldn’t speak. I haven’t heard a single word come out of my husband’s mouth in three months. Nothing but irritated groans when he’s awake, and snores when he’s asleep.\n\nIt wasn’t long after he came home the paintings started. The first was when I came home from parent-teacher conferences. When I came home, Hank was sitting, staring with blank, red eyes at the living room wall. It’s what I expected. Ever since he came home, he seemed to have abandoned all interest in anything except that damn wall. Each morning he would wake up, I’d place him in his chair, and he’d wheel himself right to that spot and stare at it all day. I had long since given up hope he would interact with our children.\n\nWhat I *didn’t* expect was that he had dug out a spare can of blank paint from the garage and planted a huge, single black streak across the wall in the living room. He still had the brush in his hand when I came home. I was livid, but I didn’t fight it. I didn’t have enough energy for an argument, anyway. So I let him paint, and he became *obsessive.* Every time I walked into the room, I found a new black streak slashed onto the wall.\n\nI got him some rudimentary supplies. A few canvases, an easel, and a basic set of paints, which deviated his attention from our walls. He never stopped painting. I couldn’t even convince him to sleep, so I gave up on that, too. All day, all night, sitting in the living room, painting away.\n\nThe scenes were nonsense at first — streaks of random color splattered across various canvases to match our wall — until a month ago. Overnight, his skill level skyrocketed. He went from broad, shaky strokes of color made by unsteady hands to intricate pieces full of detailed, beautiful designs worthy of Rembrandt. And they evoked genuine emotion from me. The figures in the painting were so real, so encapsulating. And their *faces*. Each one filled with pain. I couldn’t look away.\n\nAnd Hank didn’t even seem to care. The moment he would finish one, he would discard it and start on another. I had no idea Hank had this in him. He had never asked about anything artistic before. It was hard enough getting him to go to the movies with me, yet alone a museum. It scared me. Did I know my husband at all?\n\nA few weeks ago, his paintings changed. They became personal. Pictures of our children eating, or playing, or me lounging in the living room reading a book with my leg draped over the edge of the couch. It was nice. At least Hank had remembered my existence.\n\nOne morning, I woke up to see he had painted a scene where Jason, my oldest, hit his first home run. Charming, but optimistic. Jason is a pretty scrawny kid, and while he loved the sport, he hadn’t even got a hit all season.\n\nYet the next week, sure enough, Jason hit a home run right over the left field fence. The ping rang out so loud it echoed against the cement stadium walls behind me. I don’t think it was until Jason rounded third that I remembered to cheer. What I didn’t forget was Hank’s painting. I wanted to chalk it up to coincidence. It wasn’t impossible. But when I checked the painting later that night, the ball in the painting was right over the left field fence. The coincidences piled up.\n\nIt went on like for a while. His paintings would predict many mundane things. The vacuum cleaner smoking from breaking, the dog chewing one of Hank’s old shoes, even the meals I was planning to cook. That one bothered me a little. I wondered if I was choosing to cook those things *because* of the paintings. Without fail, every scene, down to each detail, would happen a few days later. It was remarkable. Frightening. Unbelievable. I had even come to grow *excited* about the paintings, to see what lies in my future.\n\nThings shifted once more one morning. I remember feeling good that morning. I got a few solid hours of sleep and was relieved enough to wake up to a house that hadn’t burned down during my indulgence. It was the closest I had been to being in a good mood in longer than I could remember. I sauntered down the stairs and saw my husband finishing up the last strokes of his latest painting.\n\nI almost felt guilty when I realized that, for the first time in weeks, he wasn’t the first thing on my mind that day. In fact, I hadn’t thought of him at all. And if I’m honest, it was a relief. So when I saw him sitting in his chair, his back turned towards me, swiping away on a canvas, a genuine smile creased my lips, and I wandered over with some mild interest and even a little excitement to see what new future awaited me.\n\nAll of that dissolved when I was close enough to make sense of the image. It was me, standing above him with an arm raised and an expression that showed an intent to be violent. It shocked me. The scene should have made me sad, to think something like that could be in our future, but it didn’t. It made me angry.\n\n*How could he think I would do this? I’ve never been violent before, not once. And after all I’d done for him, washing him, feeding him, single-handedly taking care of the house. He had become like another child, a man-child. He doesn’t contribute to anything. He can’t even do chores. I take care of everything while he sits and paints. The bills. The kids. The chores. All of it. And he won’t even acknowledge me except through these fucking paintings. He won’t even talk to me.*\n\nIt was at this moment that I realized I had raised my hand to strike to him. I caught myself a moment before I would have crashed the palm of my hand onto his cheek. And that was what scared me most of all. Just that fast, his painting had come true. Not days, not weeks, but an instant after he had finished it had the scene come true. Except for when I had to feed him, I spent the rest of the evening away from him, wishing I could run away. I’d never needed a vacation more. A single thought swirled through my mind all day. *I never would have been in that position if he hadn’t of painted it.*\n\nThe next days, all of his paintings depicted darker things. All the happiness and whimsy from his paintings were gone. One showed Jason getting into a fight at school and coming home with a black eye. Another showed the train crash in Ohio. And the predictions were becoming true faster and faster, sometimes coming true, like the slap, on the same day.\n\nThis morning I decided I had enough. The paintings had ruined my marriage, ruined my family. Daylight hadn’t even cracked the horizon by the time I had dug out the rope from the garage. I walked into the family room to find Hank sitting in the same spot I expected him to be. I took the rope and tied his arms to his chair. I made it tighter than it needed to be, but he didn’t wake. He didn’t even drop the brush that dangled between his fingers. Then I turned my attention to my real enemy.\n\nI started with the canvases strewn around the room. I took each one — the baseball game, the fight, the slap, all of them — and broke it. I even destroyed the older ones. The ones that were scenes of people I didn’t know, and the ones that were just lines of color of nonsense. I took down every painting that adorned the walls of my house. And I made it violent. I didn’t know how much I needed to break something, but it felt *good*. I tore the canvas and snapped the thin wood pieces over my legs. Each crack, each rip, flooded my veins with catharsis. I didn’t know if Hank had woken up and watched me do this. Maybe he already knew I would do this. But I didn’t care. He couldn’t stop me.\n\nOnce each painting in the house was gone, I turned my attention to the last one in the house. The one that sat on Hank’s easel. His most recent, and his last, creation. When I saw it, my blood ran cold. It was a picture of me. I’m wearing the same yellow dress with flowers on it I put on before I even came down the stairs. Broken paintings are strewn about the floor. Rope binds Hank to his chair, holding a brush in his hand. None of that even surprised me anymore. I was glad he knew what I had done until I ran my eyes across the rest of the image. Blood stains the bottom of my dress, and I’m holding a knife in my hand that I’m running across Hank’s [throat.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WorldArchitect/comments/yv369y/thanks_for_being_here/)",

        "text": "The first time I met Lola was during a night out in university. I was drunkenly making my way back home with a poorly structured kebab and she followed me. She was no bigger than my fist and looked as if she had been born inside of a drainage pipe — yet despite her size she kept pace. She followed me all the way back to my dorm, eating up the trail of meat and salad that I left in my wake all while bravely meowing into the night.\n\nI never intended to keep her. Being drunk, I could scarcely plan past the next couple of hours. That night, however, I knew that Lola wasn’t going to spend the night sleeping on the street. The kitten was more than willing to hide in the pouch of my hoodie to get past the security guard. The hangover in the morning was brutal, but Lola’s purring made it bearable.\n\nLola spent the rest of the year being the worst kept secret in my student dorms and then the next three years being the cuddly mascot of the flat I rented with my classmates. I got my degree and qualifications and went on to become an IB certified biology teacher. I’d hop around the international school circuit on three year contracts and even though the culture and the continents changed — Lola remained a steady constant through my life.\n\nIt didn’t matter if it was hot or cold or if the apartments were clean or covered in geckos, Lola was happy as long as there was someone to scratch her behind the ears. A lot of the spots where I taught provided pretty steep hazard pay, and I’ve found myself in situations which I would rather have avoided but Lola was the one constant in my years of traveling. She was a little piece of home I got to carry around.\n\nNothing last forever though.\n\nAfter fifteen years of keeping me company much of Lola’s body had given out. She was blind in one eye and limp in one paw and much of her day consisted of snoring on my lap. She would still meow with the same pitch of the kebab hungry kitten, but it was clear that Lola’s time was running out.\n\nWhat made matters worse was that my three-year contract was about to run out as well. After three years of teaching in the International School of Islamabad I was set to start a three-year stint in Prague. The day of flights and layovers would surely kill Lola. \n\nI couldn’t bare the idea of her having her final moments in the cargo hold of a plane. The thought of leaving her behind, however, was just as bad. Lola was old and confused. I hated the idea of her going into the night without my company.\n\nMoving across the continent is hectic enough, but as the days counted down to my departure all I could think about was the question of Lola. I had colleagues who offered to adopt her and it was still possible to buy her a ticket but each day I put off that decision. I lost sleep worrying over what would happen to my cat and I guess she felt it somehow.\n\nThree days before my flight, after a night of complications; Lola eased my burden.\n\nShe died.\n\nShe died and I held her paw and I felt that last thud of life leave her. At the vet’s office they offered to dispose of her body but I declined. Instead, I got Lola packed into an airtight plastic bag and took her home with me. I’d take her with me to Prague and get her cremated there. \n\nShe could keep traveling with me. \n\nTurns out, however, that most conventional airlines aren’t okay with transporting last minute dead animals. My final two days in Islamabad were spent on the phone with every single airline that connect back to Prague. I repeated the story of her death over and over and over again until it had completely lost all meaning. \n\nNo dice. No airline would transport her. It started to seem like I would have to leave my Lola behind in shrink-wrap.\n\nBut then, on the twenty fifth page of Google, I found a company that was willing to transport Lola. They had no customer service number, nor could I find any mention of them on the internet beside their website — but their FAQ was clear:\n\n*Q: Can I transport dead animals on Morana Air flights?*\n\n*A: Yes.*\n\nAn option to purchase a pet ticket popped up. \n\nI didn’t have much of a choice.\n\nEven though the cat was dead, she still had to be transported inside of an animal container. When I dropped off Lola at the cargo depot the airport guards seemed really uncomfortable, but aside from that everything else went smoothly. I took my flight to London a few hours later and was in Prague by sunrise the next day. Took a couple calls, but eventually I found a pet cremation place that spoke English and understood my situation. Lola was due to arrive the following afternoon and the cremation place wasn’t far from the airport. It started to feel like everything had been figured out.\n\nThe problems didn’t start until I picked Lola up from the airport.\n\nThe smell was the first thing I noticed. Even from the hallway I could smell the undeniable stench of rot. It didn’t even occur to me that the smell could be tied to Lola’s body. It wasn’t until I got to the pick-up point that I realized something was terribly wrong. The airport worker was young and uncomfortable. First thing she said when she saw me was:\n\n‘We tried giving her a bath but it didn’t help.’\n\nThe words scarcely connected to my brain before the carrier box was brought out. Two eyes stared at me from inside of the box but I scarcely recognized them. The dark green plastic packaging Lola was wrapped in lay shredded in the corner of the cage. The cat I was looking at looked like a carbon copy of Lola, but I didn’t recognize it.\n\nThe eyes were different.\n\nI stood there in absolute shock, staring at the living cat in the box. I knew I had to say something to the attendant but no words came to me. I remained awestruck by the sight inside the box until the cat broke me out of the spell.\n\n‘*MNeOooOow!*’ the creature moaned in a voice low with exhaustion.\n\nI tried explaining to the attendant that this wasn’t my cat — that my cat was dead, yet she just nervously laughed. When I kept on insisting that what arrived in the box was not what was sent, she called her supervisor. The supervisor also nervously laughed for a bit, but then he said that my issue was with the airline. I was told to contact their customer service line. \n\nI was also asked to leave the premises with my *pet*.\n\nThroughout the whole argument, and through the whole bus ride back home the cat kept on meowing from inside of the box. It sounded nothing like Lola. It sounded like some horrid demon being exercised and yelling ‘*Nooo*’. The cat meowed through the whole bus ride back and everyone bunched up by the driver to escape the smell.\n\nWhen I let the cat out of the box in my apartment it moved with a terrible swiftness. Lola calculated each step she took, but this creature rushed through the rooms like a guided missile. Once it scanned the room it jumped atop my kitchen counter, stared into my soul and proceeded to howl:\n\n‘*MNeOOOooOOw!’*\n\nI opened all the windows in the apartment and immediately set to finding the contact number for Morana Air customer support. As hard as I tried, however, I couldn’t find any trace of them online. The whole way through my fruitless search the cat kept on meowing. I tried to ignore the entire existence of the creature at first, but then it occurred to me that it might just be hungry. \n\nWhen the first couple of Google pages didn’t return any results, I grabbed my coat and went downstairs to buy the cat some food. Getting out into the corner store helped me escape that terrible smell, but my clothes still stank like I rolled in a garbage heap. When I returned back to the apartment I gagged. The smell had soaked into everything I owned.\n\nIt won’t eat. \n\nIt won’t drink. \n\nAll the cat does is sit and stare and moan in those horrid low tones. It looks like my Lola, but I know better. I know that Lola drifted off to sleep on a chemical cocktail thousands of miles away. Whatever is sitting in front of me isn’t her. It might be using her body, but it isn’t her.\n\nThe e-mail confirmation about Lola’s ticket is linked to an e-mail address that’s a mix of random letters and numbers, my browser history shows no signs of this Morana Air and the people at the airport keep on hanging up on me. \n\nI don’t know what to do.\n\nThat’s why I came here, to this sleepless corner of the internet. \n\nIf anyone knows what to do with this creature, if anyone has any shred of insight about how this could have happened — please reach [out](https://www.reddit.com/r/MJLPresents/comments/11k3ds4/morana_air/).",

        "text": " \n\nIt started a few weeks back, not exactly sure how I got these papers and even a pencil, but I know that I'm not crazy, and therefore they must exist, right? Anyway back to the main idea, it started a few weeks ago, I was sitting in my apartment (i live in new york city by the way) looking out to the traffic, and I heard it. The ticking started. I looked around my apartment trying to find it and I just couldn't find anything.\n\nThroughout the night the sound wouldn't stop, and I know I'm not crazy because since I'm thinking that, how can I be? If I think that I’m not crazy I am therefore not. The ringing gave me a headache, I couldn't sleep. It eventually made me feel incredibly ill.\n\nI went out for a walk thinking it might clear my head\n\n“It may just be a migraine,” I said to myself quietly. But I knew it wasn’t.\n\nAnother person was crossing, I nodded my head down, and they did the same.\n\n“Hey, do you hear that?” I said to them \n\nThey looked at me confused, he slowly opened his mouth to say something, twitched, and then answered.\n\n“I hear everything.” \n\nI felt unnerved, said “thanks” and walked slightly faster. He was definitely crazy, but I know that I’m not. \n\nI got back in and as soon as I lay down, it stopped. Relieved I finally got some sleep. \n\nI had a dream, my hands were covered in blood, a chain around each hand also dripping blood. A slight screaming off in the distance, I rose and started running. The chains clanked behind me in unison with the rapid pattering of my feet. I got to a woman, and as soon as she saw me she stopped screaming. The eyes, the eyes told me everything. She was scared of me. I had no control of my body anymore, I watched myself repeatedly beat the woman with the chains whipping her as she screamed louder with each whip. The ticking came back I finally understood, the whipping was the ticking.\n\nI woke up in a cold sweat I checked my hands, no blood, and no chains. I went to the bathroom, I wiped my face down with lukewarm water, grabbing the towel with my eyes shut. I wiped it down. I looked at myself in the mirror and I saw myself. It started again, the slow methodical ticking.\n\nI went to work and did my usual work stuff. A whole tub of aspirins was used that day, the ticking was terrible. A constant reminder of the dream at this point, the face of the woman I couldn't get out of my head, the pain she felt. I knew she was screaming to get away from me. \n\nAs I walked back home I saw her, on the opposite side of the street, that same woman I had seen in my dream. I knew what I had to do on the spot, I went over crossing the desolate street. \n\nShe saw me crossing and started walking faster.\n\n“Wait, wait, please. I promise not to hurt you.”\n\nShe slowed down and looked at me.\n\n“How do I know you won't do that, we’re in the middle of a street and nobody else is around. I’m a perfect victim.”\n\nI looked at her and realized she won't come near me\n\n“Look, I just think you're really cute, I’ll leave my number here on the floor, and I’ll leave. You can pick it up if you want to but you don’t need to.”\n\nI placed my number on the ground and then promptly left. Once I got home I sat waiting by my phone. Waiting for it to ring. I eventually became tired and needed rest, wishing I could stay up longer on the off chance I would be able to hear the phone ring. I fell asleep with no dream this time.\n\nThe next day as I came home from work I immediately checked my phone for voicemails, I saw 3 on the small, green screen, the first was some bullshit marketing thing, and the next was her. Somehow, for some reason, she called me. I listened to the voicemail, the whole time with a large headache and the ticking in my ear, like the Japanese water torture of tinnitus. \n\n“Hi there, not exactly sure why I'm calling you back, I guess I just kind of liked the bravery of what you did and the respect for my personal space. Anyway, if you want to meet up I’m free tonight, at around 8ish, call me once you get this.” \n\nI called her and told her to meet me by the park, then the twitches started, every few ticks I had a slight twitch, my eyes blinked, and the side of my head slightly touched my shoulder. I worried about what she would say, if she would leave.\n\nI entered the park and waited for her, staring at the gates. She walked through, looking around.\n\n“For me,” \n\nI said in a quiet voice. I waved my hand to her, she saw, nodded her head, and walked over.\n\n“You look incredible, I'm glad you decided to come.”\n\n“Awww, thank you, how come you wanted to come to the park? It’s so cold out.”\n\nShe shivered in her cardigan, thin enough so the wind would blow through it. I offered her my jacket and she took it gratefully.\n\n“Here come this way, I want to show you my favorite part of the park.”\n\nI grabbed her by the hand, smiling as I ran to the abandoned building on the other side of the park.\n\n“Here come inside, it's my favorite place in the whole world. once I get enough money I want to buy it and start a family.”\n\n“Ah, so you’re a family man.”\n\nI brought her inside and brought her into the basement\n\n“I'll give you the grand tour”\n\nThe lie was starting to shine through, I'm surprised she believed it, I only saw the shock on her face once she saw the handcuffs on the broken radiator. I grabbed her stuffing the cloth into her mouth. The muffled screams came out as I attached her to the radiator. \n\nI reached into my bag and pulled out two chains, and started whipping in unison with the ticks, I knew this would set me free, my dream told me. \n\nFinally, there were no more ticks, the liberation felt amazing. The police I’m sure are after me now. I'm only posting this for people to know.\n\nI am not crazy.",

        "text": "I want to try to help anyone else who may experience what I did last Monday night, I still don’t know how I got away from them. When I say them, I am talking about The Crawling Men.\n\nI didn’t break my usual routine when I got back from work that Monday, I got in and was immediately greeted by my German Shepherd Max. I was though, later than usual, as an accident en route had held me up somewhat. I could tell Max was getting hungry as he clawed at his bowl soon after I arrived. I filled it with a pungent mixture of lamb and vegetables, as I got him to sit. His tongue licked his lips while he whimpered in anticipation as I placed his bowl on the floor, and gestured him to eat. Once his snout was buried in his bowl, I made myself an omelette, full of ham and mushrooms. After we had eaten, we sat and watched an episode of police interceptors while we waited for our food to digest.\n\nOnce the episode had finished, I grabbed Max’s leash and we headed out on our nightly walk. I walked the route on a daily basis, normally around a hour earlier though. We headed across the road and onto a woodland trail that would eventually take us back round to a main road that led us back home. \n\nI let Max off his leash and he began to zigzag, nose to ground ahead of me as usual, I had my flashlight with me so I wasn’t too uneasy about the darkness the woodland shed on us. I also felt at ease with Max by my side, he was a big softy especially with me, but also other people, but if he was threatened I know that he would fiercely protect us both. We were around halfway through the wooded track when a distressing scream ripped through the distant trees ahead. I jumped, clutching the flashlight firmly while running it side to side through the upcoming foliage. Max was barking furiously while I tried to quiet him, I didn’t want to draw any unnecessary attention to our presence. \n\nMax quietened down after I gave him some  treats I had stashed in a pouch, in my coat pocket, we then cautiously ventured further into the woods. I was telling myself it was probably just kids messing around, but I started to feel very uneasy, like every bone in my body wished for me to turn around. The sounds echoed around us again, this time two bloodcurdling screams radiated towards me, they sounded louder, closer and more manic. Max now seemed scared, his tail propped between his legs, I tried to reassure him as best I could as he stood behind me. A growl then came rasping through his gritted snarling teeth. I shone my flashlight up and down the dense bushes 30 yards from where I stood, planted to the spot. \n\nThe rustling leaves and the sound of twigs breaking under slow stalking movement was the only thing that my ears could hear. Suddenly appearing from within the bushes ahead of me, three sets of glowing amber eyes. Max suddenly bolted off behind me. I called out to him but his running and barking droned off into the distance. I should have followed but I just couldn’t move, like all of my muscles had turned to stone.  Every time I shone the light on the watching eyes, they would disappear instantly. They would soon reappear just as quickly, but from a different location from within the twisted branches.\n\nShadowy figures then seemed to dance and distort within the thick overgrown shrubs, the few outreaching, leave covered twigs swaying up and down, and side to side. Dried leaves began to crunch and rattle just before it all fell silent. My short quivering breath and pulsing veins around my ears, were the only things I could hear, as fear took over my body.  \n\nIn my state of terror I made my first vital error, I looked back behind me, looking for some sort of escape. When I had looked towards the bushes once again, I was faced with three men, well, men in the loosest sense of the word. They were more like savage creatures, perched on all fours half submerged from the thin branches and leaves that surrounded them. My light exposed their thick black hair that covered almost the entirety of their scrawny bodies, faces covered in blood, dirt and tufts of hair. Their features were both human and inhuman at the same time, with thin pale lips gripping tightly around pointed, bloodstained teeth. Their eyes glowed bright amber, with piercing black oval pupils at the centre. They were, for the moment, motionless. Their blotchy bruised skin was emitting fine steam, as if my flashlights illumination was burning into their flesh.\n\nI then made my second mistake. Almost instinctively, I turned and ran. I could hear the sound of their rapidly approaching scurrying footsteps. The sound of pounding dirt and broken sticks grew louder as I only prayed I could keep my footing through the root covered track. I glanced back, as they once again stood motionless, all staring deep into my eyes. I stopped to gather my breath after realising that they only ever moved once I had stopped looking at them. I backed away slowly, lifting my feet so I didn’t trip in the process, I glanced behind me quickly as I saw the illuminating glow of streetlights, exposing the woodland exit. I shot my head forward as I heard their prowling movement, but again they all stood, unnervingly still. I continued to pace carefully backwards when my flashlight began to flicker. This couldn’t be happening I remember thinking, my heart pounding so hard I thought it would burst through my chest. \n\nThen, darkness, my only light source had failed me. I then heard the roaring harmonised screams from the three predators in front of me. I had 20 yards left between me and the end of this tree shrouded hellhole. I threw my flashlight in anger and desperation at them and proceeded to sprint towards the lit road. The sound of fast crawling limbs and their erratic screams grew louder and louder. Just before I got to the edge of the exit, I felt a sharp pain in my lower right leg as a clawed hand grabbed my ankle. I fell, my head and torso was halfway onto the street lit path, I turned and stared at them all, they were frozen solid, as I glanced down to see the lead creatures talons embedded into my leg. Blood then trickled and dripped onto the dirt below. My body and breath quivered in fear, as I was sure they were waiting for me to bleed out before dragging me back into the depths of the woodland. \n\nJust as my vision began to fade I heard a snarling growl behind me, Max jumped over my struggling body and latched onto the creatures bony arm attached to me. I noticed that Max already had blood around his mouth, as if  he had already just attacked something else. The creatures wide eyes were fixated on mine, as it opened its mouth unnaturally wide and let out a deafening cry. It’s agonising clasp on my leg suddenly released, as Max’s head shook that things arm like a rag doll. I dragged myself backwards into the path shrouded in the orange glow of the streetlight above. Max let go of the creature, which was now laying motionless in the dirt. Their were now three creatures hunched over stood behind it. Max growled and snarled as he guarded my attempt to stand. I then limped across the road towards my house. I glanced back into the wooded opening just as I caught four of the creatures disappear into the darkness.  \n\nIn that moment I realised that Max hadn’t bolted away and left me earlier, he had been chasing down another one of them terrifying creatures that was creeping up behind us. By the looks of it he caught it just before coming back to my aid. \n\nI owe my life to my best friend Max, he really did save me that night. I got home and cleaned my wounds and called the police, I told them what I saw. I showed them my blood on the opening off the trail and what these creatures looked like. They sent a team in not long after to clear the woods but they found nothing but a dripping trail of blood, that quickly dissipated into the foliage. \n\nI still see them from my window at night, their amber eyes appearing from deep into the woodland. I still don’t know what them creatures were and why they only moved in the cover of darkness, all I know is that night will be the last time I ever enter them woods again. \n\nIf you ever see, through the darkness, glowing amber eyes, do not turn and run, back away slowly, look straight at them and I really hope you have a light source with you as they seem to avoid it at all costs. \n\nRemember, never, ever turn your back. \n\nThat’s when they’ll get you.",

        "text": "           I’m unloading some bags from my car at my childhood home on the edge a suburban neighborhood in the Midwest. The car is parked on the side of the road, just away from the house. It’s a quiet day out; no one’s outside. There are no birds chirping. The only sound to be heard is the soft rustling of the tan corn stalks in the wind. \n\nI know that my family and my girlfriend are inside. My brain tells me they’re sleeping. I grab a large bag and start walking up on the side walk. I look up and notice a young woman, early 20s with light, but not blonde hair, walking towards me. Shes wearing a light blue dress that flutters in the wind. She’s maybe 30 meters down the sidewalk. As I make eye contact with her, I see a glimpse of fear, or maybe just concern, in her expression. She turns diagonally and begins walking towards the house. I think that she’s trying to avoid me. I make my way around the cars in the driveway and to the door, the same direction as the young girl. She appears to grow more concerned at the sight of me approaching. \n\nI speak up, “I live here. I’m just trying to put away my things. I mean you no harm.” \n\nI look away to unlock and open the door. The girl stands still on the far end of the porch. She blinks but says nothing. \n\n“Can I help you?” I ask. \n\n“I know the other person who lives here. I just need to pick something up from them. Can I come in?” \n\n“Sure…who do you need?” She moves towards me as I make my reply, and I let her inside the dark house. \n\nShe leans against the couch just inside the door, turns towards and examines me. I, still standing just outside the doorway, inform her that everyone’s sleeping, so I’ll have to wake up whoever she needs.\n\nShe starts taking her clothes off and before I can protest, she’s laying on the floor and inviting me to have sex with her. \n\n“What? No, absolutely not. I don’t even know who you are. Everyone is just in the other room. Get up and get out.” I tell her sternly. I am confused. \n\n“Come on, “ she begs  “we can be quick” \n\n“No, get out of my house” I repeat\n\nShe stands herself up, slips on her light blue dress, and walks towards the cars leaving her other items behind. \n\nI follow her, making my way back to my car to continue unpacking and hoping she’ll go away. I stand next to my car as she twirls around to face me again. \n\n“You didn’t have to be so rude, you know. I only want to play” she giggles. \n\nI hear movement in the corn stalks to my left, across the street from my house. I look over and see another girl with long dark hair and a white dress skipping towards us from the field. She’s giggling and playing with her dress with one hand as she skips, the other hand behind her back. I stare at her as she approaches closer, almost to the other side of my car now. The hairs on my body are standing on end. The world seems very quiet.\n\n“Hey you!” I hear from the driveway, turning to look at the first girl. \n\n“What are you doing?!” I shout back\n\n“Well… we’re going to kill you, that’s what!” She cheers back at me.\n\nA rock skips across the asphalt and I turn to see the dark haired girl hurriedly racing towards me, a knife in her right hand raised high. I backpedal a few steps, glance down at the ground and grab a handful of gravel and debris from the curb of the road. I sidearm it towards the dark-haired girls face, getting it in her eyes. \n\nShe stops in her tracks, raising her free hand to her face crying and screaming. She drops to her knees. I bound to her in two quick but powerful steps and grab her wrist and hand. I grasp the knife away from her as she looks up at me with red eyes. I raise the knife up and make a swift slash at her neck. The knife bites and slides across her throat, trailing a thin line of red behind it. The line thickens as blood begins to form. I take a half a second, hand and arm on my left from the follow through, and decide to slash again. My arm brings the knife across her neck in the other direction, a quick cut. Her eyes are wide, staring at me. My heart is pounding in my ears. \n\nI breathe out, and look towards the house. I start running, sprinting. The door to the dark house is open wide. \n\nI hear a scream.",

        "text": "I never thought it weird that the cat started sleeping in the kitchen, as opposed to his couch where he usually did. \n\nThe smell of food cooking, especially when I was cooking my famous butter chicken, naturally would have led him to sleep closer to the scents cats were usually drawn to. \n\nI kept this at the back of my mind, slightly concerned but not thinking too much about it. It was nothing out of the ordinary. \n\nOr so I thought. \n\nI first started to question my assumptions when I noticed the cat deliberately avoid the couch where he usually enjoyed staying. As if some smell or thing was pushing him, or even scaring him away.\n\nHe would have a jolt and break into a run when he had to pass through that area. I started to get a little worried after that.\n\nThinking that it may have been some stains or mold, I decided to give the couch a thorough cleaning. \n\nIt was a solid 3 hours of wiping, smacking (to get the dirt out), and drying it to the point where it seemed almost brand new. \n\nHoping that the cat would naturally go back to his couch, I went about my days and put the matter in the back of my mind. \n\nThen one night, I found out the real reason behind the cat’s peculiar behavior. \n\nIt was an unusually chilly night. I rubbed my arms as I got off my car in the parking lot and started walking back to my apartment. \n\nIt was June, right in the middle of summer, and yet the air was *chilly*, just like it would be during fall or spring. \n\n“Global warming must be really messing up the weather”, I thought. \n\nI was wearing summer clothes, a t-shirt, and shorts and soon enough I started to shudder from the cold.\n\nI reached the door to my apartment and quickly walked in. \n\nThe apartment too was cold, and I quickly turned on the heater and walked into my room to put on a hoodie. \n\nMid-way through putting it on, I froze. I realized I had simply *walked into* my apartment. The door had not been locked. \n\nI finished putting on my hoodie and tried to remember whether I had left the door unlocked when I left for work in the morning. \n\n“Hmm, I don’t think I had…or did I?”\n\n“I *was* in a hurry and must have left it unlocked…” \n\nBut the more I thought about it, the less it made sense. \n\nYou see, habits are scary things. You often do them without realizing that you’ve done them. And I locked my doors every, single, day. \n\nI started making my way back to my front door, to retrace my steps in the morning, thinking that it might help recall if I had indeed locked my door. \n\nAs I passed by the living room, I stopped dead in my tracks.\n\nThe couch that my cat usually loved staying in was on the right side of the living room, and the front door was located on the left-most side of the room.\n\nI had walked straight towards the front door and in my right peripheral vision, I could see the couch. \n\nBut there was something on it. \n\nNo, there was *someone* on it. \n\nFor some strange reason, I could not turn my head to face it. I somehow *knew* that if I turned to face this thing, I would die. I was so convinced of this fact that I started to shudder. Not from the cold this time, but from fear. \n\nThis…*being* that was on the couch was not a person. It wasn’t a human. No human could emanate such dread, such fear from its presence. It was…a *primal* being. Something ancient, archaic, something that knew time, death, and the darkest of sins in the world. \n\nThen I heard my cat meow from the couch. \n\nThe greatest of chills ran down every inch of my spine as I realized that the meow did not come from my cat. This…thing was mimicking my cat, and I realized it *wanted* me to look at him. \n\nI started to cry. My mind was telling me that I was about to die. I thought of my mom. I thought of dad…and how I regretted not getting closer to him and telling him about all of the things I had in my head. I had so much left to do, so many loose ends to tie, and yet here I was. \n\nDeath. \n\nThis being had total control over me. It had control over my final moments. I did not want to die on someone else’s terms. \n\n“Fuck it.”\n\nI turned to face the couch.",

        "text": "[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11fa3wk/my_sister_talks_to_herself_at_night_part_1/)\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11h1hgs/my_sister_talks_to_herself_at_night_part_2_the/)\n\nThe unlit, half-demolished rooms and walls of semi-transparent plastic made the construction site feel like some kind of insane plague hospital. My heart was in my chest as I felt my way through the dark. *What if I got caught?* I doubted my family could take another tragedy…\n\nThe mall was no less creepy than the construction site had been. The main lights had been powered down, and the only illumination came from emergency signs and a few gated storefronts that must’ve kept their lights on all night. The eyeless stares of backlit mannequins seemed to follow me while I hurried through the mall. I couldn’t shake the feeling that someone or something was following me. Every time I stopped moving, the echoes of my footsteps seemed to continue on *just a little bit* longer than they should have. \n\nI crouched in a shadowy hallway in front of Maia’s favorite store…and waited. There was no sound but the dripping of the powered-down fountains and the rumble of machines kicking on beneath the mall. I kept expecting to turn and find some horrible thing squatting in the darkness beside me…\n\nI was considering giving up and going home when lights suddenly came on in the store in front of me. In happier times, the posh teen clothing retailer had been Maia’s favorite place to shop; now, with its staticky pop songs playing to an audience of mannequins and vacant cash registers, it seemed far more sinister than I remembered.\n\nThe gate was unlocked when I approached, but I winced at the noise it made when I lifted it. \n\nAt the time, I didn’t consider how strange it was that someone had somehow entered the store without passing through it.\n\nBy the time I did, it was too late. A dark figure was approaching from the dressing room corridor, humming along to the music. *Maia.* \n\nI dived into a circular clothing rack, grabbing the hangers to stop their rattling. It was like being a kid again, playing hide and seek with my older sister–\n\nOnly this time the game felt deadly serious.\n\nMaia held up jeans and sweaters, checking each look before discarding anything she didn’t want into a growing mountain of clothes beside her. She tried a variety of perfumes and painted her nails Hot Pink with a smile–a maniac, hungry smile that didn’t look right on my sister’s face.\n\nI slipped my phone out of my pocket. \n\nI’d come this far for *proof,* and no matter how frightened I was, I wasn’t going to leave without it. The next time Maia struck a pose in front of the floor-to-ceiling mirror, I was ready. From my hiding spot in the clothing rack, I looked down to take the photo–\n\nBut Maia didn’t appear on the screen. I glanced up at the girl in front of me and back down at my phone–\n\nFootsteps came running toward us. I gasped and peered out the other side of the rack.\n\n“Freeze! Security!” a pale, scared-looking guy in a cheap-looking uniform skidded to a halt in front of the store. “Hey! Put your hands up and turn around! NOW!” \n\nThe smile never left Maia’s face as she lifted her arms and turned toward the mall cop. The way she twisted her body hardly seemed human, but the guard was too nervous to notice. He was busy trying to get his radio to work. No matter what channel he used to ask for backup, the radio only played the same staticky pop music as the store’s speakers…\n\n“You’re trespassing on private property. I’m gonna have to take you in.”\n\nThen Maia was on him. The hot pink polish of her nails sparkled as she squeezed the guard’s head between her hands. His eyes went wide; he didn’t have the time or the strength to resist as Maia pushed him backward…toward the mirror. \n\nWith one hand she touched the silvery surface, and with the other…she pushed him through it. The reflection of the store wavered, and for a second I was looking into a maze of gloomy corridors that swallowed the guard like quicksand. The moment his fingers disappeared into the mirror, the gray hallways disappeared and I was once again looking at my sister’s reflection. Maia dusted off her hands and went back to trying on clothes. Each time she came close to the rack where I hid I shut my eyes tight, terrified that she’d find me and push me through the mirror, too–but the tightly-packed dresses hid me well. By the time Maia finished, the store looked like a hurricane had hit it. With three vials of nail polish, two bottles of perfume and an armload of clothing, my sister approached the mirror…and stepped inside. I caught just a flash of the gloomy corridors and the panicking guard before the reflection wavered and returned to normal. I was alone with the eerie music, the ransacked store, and an angry voice on the mall cop’s radio that was asking him to report in. I got out of there as fast as I could run. \n\nI spent the misty, 2 A.M. drive home trying to explain what I’d seen, but when I parked on the street in front of my parents’ apartment, my thoughts were just as troubled and confused as they’d been when I’d left the mall. I checked nervously for signs of movement from Maia’s window before I snuck inside and dragged myself to bed.\n\nI woke to a knocking on my door. Sunlight streamed through the window.\n\n“Breakfast, sleepyhead!” my father was saying. “By the way, that was a really sweet thing you did for Maia last night!” \n\n“W-what do you mean?” I felt my blood run cold. \n\n“You did a great job painting your sister’s nails–you even remembered how much she loves hot pink!” \n\nThe next morning, the missing mall security guard was all over the news. I bit my lip, wondering if anyone had seen me sneaking into the shopping center after hours. *What if the cops dusted for fingerprints? Would they find mine–or Maia’s?* There was only one way to find out for sure what was happening to my sister, but I was terrified of doing it.\n\nI’d actually preferred to go to a sketchy dance club and break into a mall, rather than do the one simple thing that I’d been dreading all along: *spending the night in my sister’s room.* \n\nOnce I’d committed to it, though, I felt an odd sense of calm. One way or another, I was about to learn the truth about what was happening to Maia.\n\nWhen my father’s snores finally began to echo down the hallway, I tiptoed to my sister’s room. \n\n“Maia?” I whispered. No movement, no response. I could see a dark shape in my sister’s bed. *She must be asleep,* I thought, *or pretending to be.*\n\nAs I crossed the room to the table lamp that was Maia’s only source of light, another possibility occurred to me: *What if that wasn’t really my sister under the blankets?*\n\nI reached out for the light, expecting a horrible hand to shoot out of the darkness and grab my hand–\n\nBut none came. When I clicked on the tiny lamp, I saw only my sister’s sleeping face. Without opening her eyes, Maia sighed and turned away from the light. *What now?* I had no idea.\n\nThere was nothing to do but listen to the barely-there, hypnotic sound of my sister’s breathing–\n\nAnd try to stay awake. \n\nEvery time I checked my phone, I was amazed by how little time had passed. I zoned out looking at my sister’s possessions, preserved in the silent room like butterflies pinned behind glass. Finally, my eyes settled on the fancy oval mirror on the wall in front of Maia’s bed.\n\n*There had been a mirror in the dance club–and in the store in the mall.*\n\n*What if–*\n\nI froze. Was it possible that someone…or *something*…was watching me from within that gloomy reflection? I sighed, patted my sister’s hand, and pretended to stretch. I turned out the lamp, then opened and closed my sister’s door–but I didn’t leave the room. \n\nInstead, I pressed myself against the wall where the mirror hung, hiding myself from the view of anything inside. The darkness seemed thick enough to cut with a knife as I waited for something–*anything*–to happen. \n\nAfter what felt like hours, the surface of the mirror began to swirl and emit a dull, silverish glow. My sister stirred and, with a tremendous effort, pushed herself into a sitting position. In the weird light of the mirror, Maia looked like a ghost. Her eyes burned with fear and excitement, but of course, I couldn’t see what she was looking at. Then, to my horror, a hand reached out of the mirror, and a dark shape pulled itself through. \n\nMaia reached weakly over and turned on her table lamp, and I was treated to a full view of the thing that had just climbed out of my sister’s bedroom wall. \n\nIt was like a walking reflection of Maia, and when it sat down on the bed beside her and took her hand, it made no impression on the sheets. \n\nUntil that moment, the darkness had hidden me from my sister’s view. Now, however, Maia was looking at me with a mixture of confusion and terror on her face. \n\nI pressed a finger to my lips, silently begging her not to alert the thing to my presence. As the thing touched her hand, my sister seemed to draw some strength from it, and I saw I sight I’d never dreamed I’d see again:\n\nMaia opened her mouth and began to speak. \n\n*“I love the outfit!”* my sister rasped. *“I had a great time!”* Maia paused; I had to hold down a scream as the thing from the mirror leaned hungrily toward her, like it was drinking in her words. *“I just…I don’t think I wanna go out again.”*  The thing twisted its head and made an angry sound like glass shattering. \n\nI noticed its other hand creeping up Maia’s chest, toward her neck…\n\n*“What happened to that man, the guard from the mall? What did you do to him? This isn’t fun anymo…”*  I realized that where the thing was touching Maia, its skin was merging with her own, blending until I could no longer tell where my sister’s body ended and the thing from the mirror began. It was slipping her on like a suit made of skin. *“Stop!”* Maia choked. *“I don’t want to do this anymore! Please…stop…!”*\n\nI fumbled for something to defend myself with; my fingers wrapped around Maia’s old lacrosse stick. Against a monster, it wouldn’t do much…*but against a mirror*…\n\nI swung it into the fancy antique on my sister’s wall. As the glass cracked, the thing’s head whipped around backwards toward me. Its body followed, crackling horribly as it turned.\n\nThe reflection in the mirror no longer resembled Maia’s room at all; on the other side of the fractured surface I could see only those ghastly gray hallways, those decrepit silver rooms…\n\n*And the half-eaten remains of a mall security guard.*\n\nI felt cold, glass-like fingers on the back of my neck, pushing me toward the horrible vision in the mirror. I smashed at the fractures with the lacrosse stick ones, twice, again–\n\nIt wasn’t enough.\n\nWith a final scream I grabbed the mirror’s ornamental frame, hurling it onto the floor–\n\nAnd the antique looking-glass finally shattered. \n\nThe feeling of those cold fingers on my skin disappeared.\n\nMaia stood behind me, blinking like she’d just woken up from a bad dream. \n\nAs I looked down at the shattered remains of the mirror, I realized that my sister’s sickness had begun right around the time she’d hung it up in her room. \n\nThat thing must’ve slipped out of her mirror each night, draining her energy until she could barely move. Then it approached her as a savior, offering Maia her energy back in return for letting it inside of her…\n\nMy sister hadn’t been talking to herself; she’d been talking to *it.* \n\nThe door flew open.\n\n*“WHAT* is going on in here?!” My father bellowed. “I *TOLD* you–”\n\nHe stopped mid-sentence when he saw my sister on her feet behind me, one hand resting on my shoulder. \n\nIt had taken over six years for my mother’s prediction to come true, but in the end she was right: we finally had our Maia back.   \n\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/beardify)",

        "text": "Hello Reddit, my Grandson told me this would be a good place to anonymously post this story, somewhere where nobody will find it. Many people would not  want this story getting out to the public, and for good reason I believe. However my days on this earth are numbered. And this is one secret that I refuse to take to the grave. If \"the Men in Black\" come zap me, so be it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy trouble started in 1964 when I was hired at Nasa as a Capcom. I would be in contact with the Astronauts on all the Apollo missions. At first I considered myself the luckiest man in the world. I was able to witness the first men walk on the lunar surface and then watched them visit it once again with no problems. However Apollo 13 would be the mission in which I would quit my job and never look back. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring the Apollo 12 mission they found something very odd in a small crater not very far away from the landing site. It was a Russian space helmet, however, the visor was destroyed. There was nobody or nothing near the landing vehicle (or LEM) except them. The astronauts were extremely confused. As the CSM (command service model) passed over near the landing site of Pete Conrad and Alan Bean, the two men on the lunar surface contacted Richard Gordon, who was the command module pilot. They asked him to look down at the surface near the lander. Gordan saw a small little metallic prick far away from the Intrepid lander. Mission control was sent into a frenzy after the revelation, there was a soviet moon lander on the moon. And the worst part was that not one piece of American intelligence had picked up on it. The higher-ups sent off an order 3 days later. Apollo 13 would be taken away from Nasa and made a military project. Its mission was to see what the Reds were doing on the moon. Officially Apollo 13 never reached the moon. A small explosion in one of its oxygen tanks being the cause. However in reality Apollo 13 did make it to the moon. Jesus Christ I wish it didn’t. Every day I wish I never took that job at Nasa. But as much as I wish I could, the past can’t be changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Apollo 13 splashdown that everyone old enough to have seen it on tv knows, was not the original capsule or crew sent in the Saturn V launched from the pad. The splash down that was witnessed on tv was sent up on a Saturn 1b the day before. The real command module and lander were sent hurtling off towards the moon. A top-secret crew of 3 highly trained air force-men named: Sam Colter, Chuck Burrows, and Jackson Smith were the real crew, and they were going to touch down on the moon. The men had specific military training to find any remains of what the soviets had done on the lunar surface.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe CSM reached a low moon orbit 3 days later. The first problem of the mission came when they undocked the lander from the CSM. One of the LEM landing legs didn’t deploy properly. Sam had to EVA and worked for half an hour trying to get it to extend. This wasted up precious oxygen and made their already tight margins tighter. In the end they had to manually cut loose a malfunctioning bolt. After this they had to wait another orbit and ended up slightly ahead of their targeted landing site. As they were going in for their landing several people in mission control demanded we abort it and should wait and go up on Apollo 15, when the more advanced rover would be fully ready. However the DoD wasn’t about to waste an entire Saturn V and Saturn 1b rocket for an aborted landing. We weren’t given permission to abort and we sent both of our men into uncertain fate. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"300 miles, 200, 100, 50, 10, WATCH OUT, AIM THE BROKEN LEG DOWN!\" \n\nThe lunar model touched down softly and safely on the lunar surface. It landed within rover traveling distance to the Russian lander, yet it was still slightly farther than what was wanted. Jackson and Sam walked out of the LEM. We all watched them take their first steps. The radio crackled. \n\n\"We've taken our first steps onto the moon Houston, we’re going to begin rover assembly; we’ll get back to you soon, over.\" Sam reported back to us. \n\n\"Copy that Aquarius.\" I replied.\n\nWe were all crowded around the main screens waiting for the first experimental rover to be deployed. Its development had been rushed significantly from its  planned first test on Apollo 15. It took significantly longer to assemble than planned. This cut down our Astronauts oxygen margin by half an hour. I leaned over the microphone. \n\n\"Aquarius, you're thirty minutes down on air and your margins don’t exist anymore. You now have half as much EVA time as we originally planned for.\" I told them. \n\nJackson replied with a simple \"Copy that Houston.\" \n\nEveryone at mission control sat on the edge of their seats for the 15-minute rover journey. By the time that Jackson and Sam arrived at the lander they had an hour of oxygen left. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Houston, this is Aquarius. We have visual of the Russian lander.\" Sam spoke through his radio. \n\n\"Copy that Aquarius, you have confirmation to head in for inspection.\" I spoke through the radio to both men. \n\nWe all watched from their helmet cameras as they both moved over a small crater hill and arrived next to the lander. Jackson opened the door to the Module and looked inside. \n\n\"Jesus this thing is trashed.\" Jackson mumbled through his radio. \n\nAnd it really was, random personal effects were scattered around the Pod; The most disturbing part was no space suit lying around in the pod, we had been expecting this as the entire reason we found it was due to the helmet. But it was still quite upsetting to know that the Cosmonaut was still lying on the lunar surface. We all thought how horrible a fate this would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSam had been standing at the base of the ladder for several minutes watching the grey lunar surface. He suddenly started yelling. \n\n\"JACKSON! JAC-\" As his screaming stopped his camera immediately cut out. \n\nHis two loud screams instantly triggered Jackson to jump down the ladder and out of the lander. \n\n\"SAM, SAM WERE THE HELL ARE YOU!?\" Jackson was screaming through his radio. \n\n\"Jackson stop screaming you're running through your oxygen, Calm yourself down soldier.\" I calmly spoke through the radio. \n\nAlthough in the room I was sitting, my hands were trembling for a cigarette. \n\n“Right, sorry Huston.\" Jackson responded out of breath. \n\nI pressed the mute button on the microphone. \"Do we still have vitals on Sam?\" I asked the room. \n\n\"Negative!\" somebody yelled back at me. \n\n\"What are the oxygen levels on Jackson?\" The flight director yelled out.\n\n\"He's burning through oxygen two times faster than we have planned!\" Yelled back one of the flight control members. \n\nAll conversation was cut off by Jackson chiming back in. \n\n\"Uhm Houston there's no tracks out here, I can't see anything for miles.\" Jackson started panting again.\n\n\"Oxygen levels rising!\" the same man as before yelled out. \n\nI unmute the mic. \"Jesus Christ Jackson get your breathing under control! You're going to suffocate up there.\" I yelled into the microphone. \n\n\"Abort the EVA and get Jackson back to the lunar module! We can't lose two men up there.\" the flight director yelled out to me. \n\nI capitulated. \"Jackson, get back to the Aquarius. You're chewing through oxygen too fast!\" I quickly spoke into my microphone.\n\n\"I'm not leaving Sam to die out here Houston.\" Jackson sounded almost insane. His voice was toneless. \n\n\"Jackson, that is a direct order, get your ass back to Aquarius base!\" I yelled at the soldier, I never got his response.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe, at mission control, had been looking through Jacksons helmet cam as he slowly walked around the lander. For 15 minutes it's all he would do. Now everyone was extremely disturbed. There were a set of footprints leading away from the lander, presumably the Russians. But no set belong to Sam. \n\nJackson finally spoke \"Houston, I see a cave due east following the Russian footsteps, I'm going to investigate.\" Jackson's voice was still emotionless.\n\n\"Jackson, please, you're going to suffocate if you keep going like this!\" I yelled out into my microphone.\n\nHe hadn’t responded to any of my attempts to reason with him. \n\nA voice yelled out behind me, \"Flight! He's got 20 minutes of oxygen left, He's going to die if he goes spelunking!\" \n\n\"He's not listening to us, There’s no point trying to convince him.\" I responded sadly back to the man.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith nothing left to do the entire mission control room stared up at the large screen with Jackson's helmet camera plastered across them. This was giving us our views of Jackson entering the cave. He had been heading down a shallow slope following the Russian's footsteps down the pit. Suddenly Jackson's radio started to lightly crackle. \n\n\"Any reason for the interference Houston?\" Jackson asked me, a small bit of concern in his voice. \n\nI hit the unmute button on the radio and replied \"no idea, unsure why there would be any interference.\" I replied \n\n\"Copy.\" He replied back to me. Any emotion once again gone from his voice. Finally he reached the bottom of the cave, and Jesus Christ it was so wrong. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll the people in Mission control gasped and yelled. Some started crying, and some started yelling in fear. There were so many of them, corpse's. Thousands of them lined the walls. Most were naked, but some had clothes on that had not been worn in century’s. I don't know where they came from, but Jesus none of them were in one piece. They all had these odd points on whatever was left of them. All with strings leading towards the abomination sitting at the far side  of the room. The thing looked horrifying sitting in the very edge of Jackson's flashlight beam. It looked somewhat humanoid, but it was wrong, all the things that made us, well, human gone. There were no joints at the legs or arms and it looked like some abominable doll from hell. It had Sam, what was left of him at least, in his long arms. His torso was ripped apart on the back and his limbs were missing. He was only a torso and a head. His shattered visor revealed eyes bulging with fear no other human had ever felt before. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJackson didn’t speak and neither did anyone else. Everyone was frozen, staring at whatever that freakish horror that defied everything humanity knew was. It was several seconds before the thing looked up, its hollow eyes looked glazed over and blind, but I knew from the smile the crossed its face after seeing Jackson that it could see perfectly fine. Then it spoke, but not from its own mouth. It was using Sam’s mouth and voice somehow, but it just wasn’t right. It was staticky and deeper than what Sam sounded like. Sam was a softer-spoken man, he still sounded similar, the main difference being he sounded as if he had chain smoked a pack every day since God created the earth. \n\n\"Hello Jackson, I found out where we all go when we die. We go here with him, he takes us.\" The thing spoke through Jackson.\n\nThe calm disposition of the voice dropped from his tone \"YOU WILL JOIN US NOW!\" It screamed. \n\nNone of us knew how the sound was traveling in space, but that was the last of our worries. The creature stood up at its full height, his head brushing the roof of the tall cave. It was using what was left of Sam as its sock puppet. Everybody was above questioning any of the details at this point. \n\nI yelled at Jackson, though my microphone, to run. However, the line was just static. It seemed that the creature was using the microphone in Jacksons helmet to block all radio connections. Jackson had stood there frozen for several seconds. As that thing approached him He started to run, or as best one can in zero G, but his arrogance in terms of his oxygen was starting to show. I could hear his breaths getting shallower, as he slowly collapsed in a small side tunnel of the cave. It was only a matter of time until that abomination found him, and a shorter amount of time before his small amount of oxygen expired. Mission control hadn’t spoken a word since he began running. We were all as scared as our man on the moon. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe confirmed the death of Jackson 10 minutes later. Even after his dramatic visit to the moon, his death came due to his own foolishness. His trip down the cave ended in a slow death sitting down.\n\n\"Get Chuck back to earth\" were his last few words.\n\nAfter that the flight director started yelling out orders. I felt numb as I leaned back in my chair. I could feel the tears spilling down my face. I hadn’t overseen communications with Chuck, the higher ups thought best to compartmentalize most things. But even still, I couldn't help but feel for him. Listening to his two friends dying horribly on the surface of the moon while helplessly floating above them must have been awful. The whole room began working silently with the calculations, and presented them to the flight director who gave them to my co-worker who was speaking to Chuck until he was on his way back to Earth. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy the end of the mission, there were several grown men running out of the room. Several throwing up in the bin and crying, some panting with relief that at least Chuck was home. I think, in the 3 days that we all locked ourselves into that room, waiting for our last astronaut to make it home we never talked about what happened. We just worked the problem, Chuck did his correction burns and we all waited for the splash down. Unlike most successful splashdowns there were no cheers and no happy yells, just pain, pain further brought on as only one man climbed out of the 3-man capsule. After the incident, we investigated the caves. There were 20 confirmed entrances to their own human pits. There were millions of dead bodies inside the moon, and we never found out why. Back on earth after we saw what we saw, odd things began to happen. At first, it started with the one man from our team going missing. Alex I think his name was, he was the flight leader. He reported to his post at NASA, and never came home. I think most of us got the message after that. Another man present also went missing. I think I can make a good guess about their fates. One which I will probably meet once I have posted this. To get to the point, this is a warning for anyone who returns to the moon on the Artemis missions, don't go into the caves. We kept the rest of the Apollo missions away from them. However, with new NASA leadership, I cannot guarantee the same for you, be safe.",

        "text": "So I work on a deep sea fishing boat off the west coast of the US. For the last couple of years, I’ve seen nothing odd or terrifying beyond an occasional storm or injuries given to crewmates by rigging or our catch. I’ve always loved the sea, and always felt safe and at peace when I’m on it. However, a few weeks ago, as we were pulling up our catch, something got tangled in our starboard net. When we managed to pull it aboard, it turned out to be an emergency distress buoy, one which had clearly spent a very long time in the water. We examined it, and found a slightly faded stamp in the metal and polyurethane foam declaring for it to be turned in to the Navy if found. While he went to the wheelhouse to radio it in, I examined further, finding that the radio emitter broken, explaining why it had never been picked up.\n\nI also discovered a sealed compartment on the side, inside which lay a waterproof baggie. It contained many pieces of paper, on which somebody with a very shaky hand had written. What unnerved me was that they seemed to have dried bloodstains on them. Against better judgment, I opened the bag and read them as we sailed back to port. When I finished, I immediately brought them to the captain, who turned pale as he read them. He jammed them back into the baggie and instructed me to place it back. The tone of his voice indicated that it was a demand, not a request. He also told me that the Navy would be meeting us at the dock to collect the buoy. I did as he asked; however, before I put it back, I used the ship’s scanner to make copies. When we got back to port, we indeed were met by a large group of men who immediately swarmed our small vessel. They took the buoy and made us all sign a bunch of papers, saying that we would say nothing about what we found. All they would say is that it was classified. They also said they’d financially reward us. When they left, the captain simply told us to forget about it. Since then, I’ve kept the copies hidden in my desk. Until now, I debated on what to do, and even thought about destroying them. But, I figured that this needs to be shared, and here is the best place I know. I know I’ll likely get in very serious trouble for this, but I’ll deal with it when I cross that particular bridge.\n\nThere was a single date at the top of the first page, indicating it was written in 2016. I’m transcribing the pages exactly as written, which may take a bit, seeing as how some pages are difficult to read. I’m honestly not sure what to think of it. But, if there’s any grain of truth to what is written, I’m not sure if I will ever step foot in the ocean again. Here’s what it said:\n\nTo whoever finds this message, I beg of you: Do NOT let anyone attempt to mount a rescue operation for us. By the time you find this, I, or anyone on my team for that matter, will be long past the ability of anyone to save. I’m only writing this so somebody in the right position on the surface may have an account of the horrors that have befallen us down here. In the dark and cold void which has become my colleagues’ eternal tombs. And very soon will become mine as well. And as a warning, to try and ward off any other scientists, military, or anyone for that matter, from attempting to recover what we had been sent down here to uncover and study. It may end up being in vain; God knows, I know all too well now that us humans often fail to ignore the warnings that are subtly given to us to stay away, even when they are directly under our noses, but...I must make an attempt anyways with the little time I have remaining. Before they find where I’ve hidden myself.\n\nFor the record, my name is Desmond Windows. I’m thirty five years old, and I am...well, I *was*, a professor at the University of Oregon's Institute for Marine Biology. I had been teaching there for the last eight years after graduating at the top of my class. I always had a quick thinking and tenacious mind, able to out think and outperform even some of my own teachers. Due to my accelerated performance, I ended up graduating three years earlier than intended, and was personally contacted by the dean himself, asking if I'd be willing to take up part time tenure to help the small and very much overburdened staff down in Charleston. I immediately accepted the offer; I always loved being able to teach others about my passion for the ocean and all of its creatures, but I told him that I would also be out at times of the year, since I had also already agreed to sign on with a large oceanic research corporation, which for personal reasons shall remain unnamed, due to my years of diving experience, especially since I had been certified as an advanced open water diver, and I had also completed training and been certified to be capable of safely operating an Atmospheric Diving Suit, or ADS for short.\n\nAbout six weeks ago, I was contacted by a fellow scientist and old friend of mine. David Gimbel and I had met at an oceanic conservation panel about six years ago, though his career had taken a vastly different direction than mine had. He'd been contracted by a private group that I'd never heard of before to act as a consultant and the head diver of their underwater salvage and research division. He basically supervised the lower down members of his team on locating long forgotten shipwrecks, maintaining oil rig platforms, excavating underwater ruins, stuff of that nature, and he was allowed in return to use their diving suits and submersibles to conduct studies on deep water species of fish and cetaceans in his off time. He told me that the group had heard about my merits and expertise, not only on working in deep water, but also about my secondary degrees in ancient languages, archaeology, and oceanography, and were interested in signing me on to an expedition currently underway. Apparently, while trying to map the ocean floor for wrecks, their sonar systems had detected an unusual anomaly about four thousand feet below the surface. They had passed over the anomaly a few times more, using an advanced system called Side Scan Sonar - basically for those who do not know much about mapping the sea floor, it works almost exactly like the sonar systems you have in all boats, except you use a \"towfish\", or a torpedo shape device trolled behind the boat, which emits conical pulses towards the seafloor across a wide area perpendicular to the path of the sensor, and in basic terms, creates an image or map of the seafloor it passes over. When the team had reviewed the map created, they were shocked to see, what appeared to be ruins on the bottom, across a three mile wide area. They had also discovered an American World War II battleship located less than a half a mile from the ruins, dug sideways into the seafloor.\n\nTo them, they had more or less hit the jackpot. A previously undiscovered shipwreck, which would net them a hefty financial discovery fee from the Navy, and what appeared to be sunken ruins from some ancient civilization which had once been above the waves? Its stuff people in their profession usually only dreamed about. Immediately plans had been put in play to set down a deep ocean research station for scientists, biologists, and other assorted team members to be able to study both sites. I stopped him at that point and asked him why they would need either me or him; while both of us knew how to pilot submersibles and ROV's, our forte was in ADS suits, and the deepest one could currently go so far in one was about two thousand feet down, only halfway to the distance the sites were in. He leaned in, and in a hushed tone, explained to me that the group had, in almost absolute secrecy, with the exception of the appropriate agencies needed to certify and approve it for safety, developed an advanced version of the new Exosuits that could withstand the pressures at over five thousand feet underwater. \"They say they could theoretically keep you safe to 7500 feet\", he told me, \"But it's untested\"\n\nHe then proceeded to tell me that his group wanted me to lead the diving team to explore, film, catalog, and potentially bring to the surface some of the ruins for surface teams to study, while he would lead the team to work over the shipwreck. They would pay me handsomely for my time, in addition to being named as one of the head discovers of whatever lay down there. I would become immortal in the history books for my findings as well. The amount of zeroes Gimbel told me would be on my paycheck, plus the opportunity to be remembered forever went to my head immediately, and before he could even say anything else, I told him I would take their offer. ....*Such a goddamn stupid decision*.\n\nI was almost immediately afterward flown from the US to New Zealand, where I boarded the group's ship, the *Oceanic Explorer*, in Auckland, and spent almost a week heading to our destination, which lay about two hundred miles from the Pitcairn Islands. When we arrived, we were greeted by five other ship's clustered around one area of sea, two belonging to the same company, and three the Navy. They had rigged a platform that dangled between them where the submersibles could arrive, dock, and then disembark again into the depths. Once tied up with the other vessels, Gimbel and I were taken to a private briefing led by a man who clearly couldn't even fit into a diving suit if his life depended on it. No, he was clearly a topside leader. He sat us both down and, after having us sign over half a dozen non-disclosure agreements, to make sure that we wouldn't blab to any reporters before they could announce their findings themselves; you could tell they had been fucked over before more than once by that problem, he showed us the map created by the sonar. Both of us stared in almost utter shock at what we saw. They were definitely ruins, all right. They lay in many patterns, the innermost almost circular in pattern, with outcroppings leading off in a straight direction. That was the biggest giveaway. Nature does not do straight lines. He also pointed out the battleship wreck lying just off to the side, which David focused on, but I was too enthralled by what I saw to care. I studied every inch of the sonar image of those ruins, mentally mapping them into my mind, deducing where the best place to start my sweep would be. My mind was racing with endless possibilities as well. *How old would they have to be, to remain undiscovered for so long?* Certainly I could understand why nobody had ever found them. We've only explored about five percent of the ocean so far, and anything could be hidden in that remaining ninety five percent.\n\nAfter we'd been finished with our regular briefing, the man, whose name was LeCasey, warned us that a tropical storm was brewing about eighty miles to the west of us, and was heading in our direction. He told us that if it didn't alter its course, the topside ships would have to pull out to a safer location until it passed, which he said out here, could take a couple of weeks. We'd also be out of radio contact with them as well, which meant that if any emergency arose beneath the waves, all we'd have would be the onboard doctor, her staff, and her equipment. We both told him that we understood, and we'd make sure to keep ourselves and our team as safe as we possibly could. After, we were both ushered from the ship onto the platform, where a lone, three man submersible waited to take us down. Carrying only one duffel bag of clothing and personal belongings each, we squeezed into the tight interior, and the hatch was sealed. Two safety divers swam around us, making final checks to be sure the submersible was ready for descent. One approached the small window in the front and flashed the okay sign to our pilot. I craned my neck to catch a final glimpse of the orange sunset disappearing on the horizon, and then we slipped quietly below the waves and began our descent into the deep.\n\nThere's a reason why the area of water where we were heading is dubbed \"The Midnight Zone\". When you’re down there, you are so far from the surface that no light can reach you. Aside from the artificial lights of the sub, or the occasional flashes made by deep sea creatures, there is nothing around you but blackness. An impenetrable darkness that almost seems to reach out with vast, unseen clawed hands to wrap around you, like it wishes to suffocate you in its unending embrace. Even when you've dove in water this deep a hundred times, you still get an eerie, almost primal sense of fear looking out past where the light cannot reach, because you can't see what lurks just beyond the veil. I feel ashamed, like a foolish little child afraid of monsters under the bed or the closet, by saying that I felt a huge sense of relief when I spotted the station appearing beneath us, the darkness shooed away by dozens of lights mounted on and around it. I could see other divers in what had to be the new exosuits plodding around the outside of the base, setting up their final camera systems and setting down huge cases of equipment for the coming days and weeks of exploration and surveying. Our sub moved into position and hooked onto a hatch that would allow us to transfer from it into the base itself. After the water had been drained and the pressure equalized, the pilot unscrewed the hatch and opened it for us to climb through. He gave us a cheerful smile and a pat on the back as we climbed through. \"Have a good stay, lads!\" he called after us with a distinct Irish accent. \"I'll be seein' ya in about six to seven weeks. Be safe!\" We both thanked him, and then he sealed the hatch again, disconnected himself from the station, and slowly began his long ascent back up to the surface, leaving the two of us to marvel at what we had stepped into.\n\nIt was clear that tens of millions, if not *billions* of dollars had been invested into designing the base. It had been placed directly between the two sites, and it was huge. Of course, it had to be to accommodate the number of people on our two teams, plus the three members of the medical staff. The entire structure had been made from a metal that could withstand the immense pressure pressing down on it from all sides. You could always hear the structure creak and groan as it won its endless battles with the water outside. Right away we were met by the base's leader, a tall, lanky man with hair that stuck out like the spines of a sea urchin named Carruthers. He showed us to our cabins to drop off our gear, then escorted us to the main observation area and operations room, located in the center of the base. There was a rather large dome window dominating the far wall, made out of extremely strong and durable Plexiglas that allowed anyone in the room to look out at the work any divers in the immediate vicinity were doing, along with a bank of consoles on the opposite wall that showed the views of half a dozen cameras mounted outside, and also ones that were mounted on the shoulders of the exosuits. I took a glance out the window at the darkness, just out of range of the lights, and unwillingly shuddered, before shaking my head and turning back to Carruthers and Gimbel. *You're absolutely obsessed with the ocean, and have been almost as deep as this before*, I chided myself. *You know better than most people what really lays in the gloom, so stop looking out there and letting your subconscious think up things that aren't there*. Shaking the feeling from my mind, I focused in and listened to the man speak.\n\nHe filled us in on what had been done so far. They had set up the perimeter around the base, and had also set up rope guides with light poles leading to both sites, but hadn't actually begun any surveying yet; they had been instructed to wait on our arrival to begin that stage of work. We were to rest up and meet our respective teams when they returned from outside; tomorrow, we would both set out on our respective paths to begin our initial sweeps. We would each be in charge of 6 people, plus ourselves. He told us that everyone had been handpicked by the group's board members for their qualifications and merits, and that they could all handle themselves under intense pressures and time constraints. All they needed were natural leaders, and that was us. He first walked David through the info they had acquired on the battleship, and this time, I chose to listen out of sheer curiosity. He said that the ship had gone missing halfway through the war without a single trace. Their last report had been that they were about to be battered by a huge storm, but their last known location was what baffled me.\n\nHe said, according to a few declassified military records they had been given by the Navy, that when the last known position had been transmitted, it was all the way up near the Philippines. Thousands of miles away from here. My mind raced with confusion, trying to use reason and logic to come to a sensible conclusion. *How in the hell could they have been blown this far off course?* I could understand that they may have been blown a few hundred miles from where they should, but this far? *Surely they would have noticed, if not with their equipment, then at least by maps, the stars and constellations*. At least the fact there was no land for hundreds of miles. I couldn't make sense of it. The look on David's face told me he had the same thoughts. Carruthers explained that the US Navy had been notified immediately about the wreck, and they had asked personally for it to be photographed and documented for their records, along with ours. It was the primary reason for their financial aid. They wanted to know what had caused the wreck as much as we did.\n\nAfter he finished, he turned to me and only said very brief words about my expedition. There wasn't really much he could say anyways. They had little to no information about the ruins, other than what I had been told on the surface and the sonar map. He did say that he wanted my team and I to move very slowly, as nobody could tell how old they really were. After we finished documenting and cataloguing everything where it lay, then we could begin to see if we could lift any pieces and bring them back to the base to study. I told him I understood and was ready when he deemed it was time to go. Inside though, I was bursting with the excitement and giddiness of a child discovering a Native American arrowhead in a stream. I couldn't wait to get out there and set foot in a place that nobody could have set in thousands of years. Even still, and though I mentally kicked myself for the ridiculous emotions I felt, I still refused to turn and look out in the abyss until I left the room and closed the hatch behind me.\n\nThat evening, we met everyone at dinner in the galley. My team was comprised of four men and two women; King, Alten, Figueroa, Brockmann, Nodding, and Carpenter. All of them were very experienced deep sea divers. King, Brockmann and Nodding were commercial salvage divers; all three had worked together for over ten years, and you could easily tell that there was a distinct comradery between the three of them. Alten, Figueroa and Carpenter were more along the lines of my work; Figueroa being a fellow marine biologist and oceanographer herself, and Alten and Carpenter had both graduated from Florida State with degrees in Archaeology and Oceanography, and were also accredited surveyors. We soon all struck up a friendly vibe from various discussions about our shared love of the water, of eighties horror movies and various other subjects, and within an hour were laughing and joking like we had known each other for years. I could see David had also won over his team, though I had never gotten the time to properly learn any of their names. Now that I think about it...I never really learned any of their names, except for the few he ever said to me. We finished up eating, and then each retired to our respective quarters to rest up for the huge undertaking we'd all be facing tomorrow. And while we may have all gone to sleep wishing the other pleasant dreams, with the exception of Figueroa; being an apparent prankster, she snuck a rubber eel into Nodding's bed, causing him to scream with an almost girly, high pitched scream which caused the rest of us to burst into uncontrollable laughter,  I couldn't fall asleep peacefully.\n\nMy mind seemed unable to shut down, and I tossed and turned, all the while feeling like there were fingers running themselves around inside my head. I glanced at one of the only personal possessions I had brought with me on the metal table beside the bed. A framed photograph of a smiling face, long raven black hair, olive colored skin, and emerald green eyes, a white smile beaming out from an amazingly happy moment. *Jackie*.... I turned away, unwilling to let my mind dive down that road, and again felt that weird feeling, like my skull was being massaged and probed around from within. For a moment, I swore I could almost hear her voice calling my name. *Desmond.* I shook it away, forcing myself to ignore it and fall asleep. Knowing what I do now, though, if I'd realized what it had meant....I almost feel like I would have willingly walked to one of the diving airlocks and let the water rush in, drowning all of us. It would have been a death less horrific and painful then they ended up with.\n\nWe awoke early the next day, all buzzing with anticipation at what we were about to do. My team and I were directed into the east airlock, and David and his were sent to the west. We all helped one another into our suits, and one of the medical team checked to make sure that they were all pressurized and sealed. They sealed the inner airlock door, and then flooded the room, pumping in seawater from outside. Once the room was completely filled, the outer hatch opened, and one by one, we slowly stepped out into the void. *They have definitely done an amazing job on the exosuits, I can't deny that*. They withstood the pressure outside perfectly, and were only as slow and cumbersome as the older models were. Like the previous model, they were equipped with shoulder mounted lights, built in heating units to keep the freezing cold of the outside water at bay, and a remote camera mounted on the side of the helmet for Carruthers and the rest of the people inside to watch. Also brought over were two thrusters mounted on top of our oxygen canisters that were controlled by joysticks and switches inside the suit. Walking around on the bottom of the ocean is almost exactly like walking on the surface of the moon; it's extremely slow going, so the thrusters aid you in moving around at a faster pace. We made sure our comms were working, both between each of us and the base itself, and after quickly instructing my team to stay safe, take their time working, keep in constant communication, and most importantly, to always work in teams of two and never wander off alone, we moved over to the equipment waiting for us near the beginning of the guide rope, picked it up, and then began our journey towards the ruins.\n\nThe trip took us about fifteen minutes to make. I was thankful for the guide rope and the lights that were spaced about thirty feet or so along the line; after all, down here, all it takes is a split second, one wrong step into the darkness, and you can easily become lost and disoriented. There are stories stretching as far back as the beginning of deep sea diving of divers who became lost in the blackness, never to be seen again. I kept my gaze focused straight ahead of me, waiting to see my first glimpse at the reason I'd been brought down here. And a few minutes later, I was rewarded for my vigilance. \"Holy Jesus, Mother of God\", I heard Figueroa almost breathe. The sonar map hadn't been able to properly show the enormity of the site. The first stone pillars we saw, covered with ages of muck, algae and growth, rose high above our heads, almost to the point that the top of them were out of sight in the gloom provided by the final guide light. I knew there were more beyond it, just out of sight, but the thought that all of this covered an almost three mile wide stretch of ocean floor was almost uncomprehendable to my brain. I was absolutely awestruck, my entire team was as well, but I shook my head to clear it.\n\nWe had a job to do today, and only about nine or ten hours of oxygen to get it done. I turned back to my team, and gave them their tasks of the day to perform. We all would work as one unit at first, setting up lights in and around the inner portion of the site to be able to properly see what we were doing; once that was finished, Alten and Carpenter would begin their surveying duties, using a remotely operated variation of the Side Scan Sonar system to give us a three dimensional map of the entire site, which would then be transmitted back to the base for us to look over at the end of the day. While they were doing that, the remaining five of us would divide into teams of two to do an initial sweep of the area, shooting video and taking still photographs for documentation. We would do other tasks, including trying to date the ruins another day. With my instructions finished, along with a reminder to stay safe and alert, we began work.\n\nWith the seven of us working in tandem, we were able to set up the lights in less than two and a half hours, and when we were finished, the darkness had been banished away, the ocean forced to reveal what it had kept hidden for so long. It was absolutely incredible. Somehow, even after all this time, despite the ocean currents and the crushing embrace, almost all of the pillars had remained intact, save for a select few that had crumbled into large piles of stones. Alten and Carpenter had already begun their survey, you could easily hear the whirring of the sensor as it wound its way through the ancient structures; occasionally, you could see the bright yellow machine move slowly over your head as they joked with each other and made bets about who would win an upcoming baseball game they would miss. Meanwhile, we had each teamed up and moved slowly down the rows of pillars towards the circular center. I had chosen to have Figueroa partner with me; not only had she and I developed the best rapport of everyone, but in my professional opinion, she seemed the most centered, calm and astute of the rest of us. We each took a side and filmed and photographed pillars every couple of feet, getting closer to where it all converged, maintaining constant radio contact with each other and the other groups. About halfway down, she called me over to her side. \"Take a look at this, Windows\" she said, and proceeded to use the claw hand of her suit to rub away the muck as gently as possible. For a second, I couldn't distinguish a damn thing, but then I realized what she had spotted. There were images carved deeply into the stone. Some were pictures, and others were what I could only assume were hieroglyphs or an ancient language I couldn't read. I didn't need to though; the carved pictures were sufficient enough to explain themselves.\n\nDepicted on the small portion of exposed stone that I could see was what I can only describe as...something truly monstrous. The creature was gargantuan in size, with the head of a Wolf Eel, one gigantic black eye staring directly at the viewer, and an almost humanoid body, covered in what appeared to be black scales. It reached towards the surface with webbed, clawed hands for what looked like a tribal boat, its occupants cowering in fear at their sealed fate. Around it's torso swam smaller creatures, what had to be underlings of the monstrosity; they, too, appeared to be humanoid in shape, but with the heads of Viperfish atop their shoulders, their huge, razor sharp maws poised open to catch the unfortunate victims that managed to avoid death from their leader. I scraped away algae from the carving underneath and shuddered softly at the next image. The huge creature had dragged the entire ship down to the bottom of the ocean and was...slowly torturing its drowning victims. Limbs had been torn off, and a clear expression of malicious glee adorned its inhuman features. Still others were being torn to shreds by the smaller monsters; the carving was so detailed that I could see each individual expression of horror and pain eternally frozen on each person's face. \"My God...\" I heard Figueroa say next to me. I shook my head. \"I'm as much of a scientific man as you can be, Liza, but that\", I closed my eyes, the images burned into the back of my eyelids, \"that is the furthest thing from God you could possibly get\" I opened my eyes again, raised my camera and snapped off a few shots of the carvings, then turned away, an almost desperate need to get away from whatever ancient civilization had conjured up that beast overwhelming me. \"Come on, let's get to the center and finish up today's work\"\n\nThe circular center was absolutely massive. We estimated it to be almost a mile and a half across from the end of one row of pillars, to the beginning of another on the far side. Here and there, we could see some smaller formations rising up to about chest height at varying distances, but for the most part, it was flat, save for an odd spiral that had been carved into the smooth stone deep enough that the outline could still be seen; when you dropped down onto it, you could feel the dips, even through the ages of mud and muck that had accumulated over it. We all moved out to a distance of about five feet from one another and, as a team, slowly moved across to the other side. We were about halfway across when I heard Nodding let out a shout of surprise, followed by curses. \"Everyone stop!\" I called. \"Nodding, you alright?\" \"Yeah, I'm fine\" was the muttered reply I received. I needed more information, though; when you're working in deep water, one small mistake can cost a diver his life. \"What happened?\" I pressed. After a few seconds of silence, he answered.\n\n\"Goddamn Gulper Eel suddenly appeared out of nowhere, coming straight for my face. Caught me off guard, and I stumbled back into a rock formation. Nothing's damaged on my suit, I just finished checking\" I let out a sigh of relief as the rest of the group burst into laughter. \"What, were you afraid that you were gonna be swallowed whole?\" Brockmann said in a sing-song voice, trying to lighten the mood. Everybody laughed harder, myself and even Nodding joining in. It helped loosen the sudden burst of tension that had fallen over us for that split second, after all. Even from fifteen feet away, I could see the sheepish expression he wore through his faceplate. \"I just got startled to hell and back, that was all\" he said in return. He sighed. \"I hate to say this, Windows, and I'm sorry, but when I backed into that formation, I knocked it over\" I thrusted around the others to inspect the damage. He was right; the small pillar had indeed been knocked over. It lay on its side, a small shroud of muck settling around it. It still looked to be in one piece, however. \"It's okay Nodding, it didn't break at all, just fell on its side. You're safe from being chewed out by me or Carruthers\" He let out a relieved sigh, and then looked down at the gauges lining the inside of his suit. \"Thank Christ. Well, we got two hours of oxygen remaining boss. You wanna finish up surveying this area and head back to base?\"\n\nI didn't answer him right away, however. I was staring down at where the pillar had clearly been knocked out from. There was a slot there, a rectangular opening about three or four feet across. But it didn't seem to only go down a few inches or even a few feet. The blackness in that space seemed greater, almost as if there was a space much larger and deeper beneath it. I felt the same, odd sensation in my head again, this time a little stronger. And, for a split second, I was overcome with a desire to...*peer* into the slot, to even swim into it. It was almost as if something had hooked itself into my brain and was trying to reel me in. I was snapped out of my moment by Brockmann calling my name. \"Windows?\" she asked tentatively. I looked up at everyone. They all wore puzzled, confused expressions on their faces as they stared at me. Shaking away the last tendrils of my insane thought, I pulled myself together. \"Yeah, you're right Nodding. Let's finish up this area and be done for the day\"\n\nThe next three weeks proceeded without incident for my own team, as well as David's. We both made very good progress on our respective sites, cataloguing and documenting extensively. The feeling that I'd had during that first dive hadn't returned since, and I felt more like myself, more eager to learn all we could about the ruins. The surface team had contacted us two days ago, and had informed us that the storm was almost on top of us, so they would have to pull back until the storm either passed by, or blew itself out. They did, however, authorize us to bring back a few pieces of the site to further study, and we had very selectively chosen three smaller ones, using commercial lift bags to float them back to the base. Once inside, they had been brought to the lab for us to clean up and study. There had been more carvings depicting the same monster as I'd seen on the carving I'd examined the first time, along with what we now were sure had to be a very ancient language. Using specialized scanning equipment, we had put it into a computer and had set it to attempt to translate to English. So far, it had been running for almost three days with no success. We headed back out in the meantime to document the outer edges of the site, one of what we assumed to be our final initial passes. We had again divided up into teams of two, and had fanned out over a distance of about a hundred feet from the next team. This time around, I'd paired up with Carpenter, who'd volunteered to help me photograph and film the end of one particular row of pillars. We were about halfway done with our job, when I noticed a glint of something red and metallic reflecting off the glow of the nearest light. I turned and felt my jaw drop open.\n\n*What…in the absolute fuck?* I was staring at a *tricycle*. A goddamn red children's tricycle, sitting perfectly upright on the bottom, not even twenty feet away from me. Confusion filled my mind. *How in the hell did THAT get down here??* I narrowed my eyes and tried to think of a logical explanation. It could have fallen off someone's boat as it passed over the area, but there were two things that just seemed...*wrong* to me. First, if it had fallen off someone's boat, it had to have been very freaking soon. It still had all of its paint on it, and there was absolutely no sign of rust. Not to mention that there was not even a tiny bit of algae covering it. But, more unsettling than that, was the creeping sensation I felt. That tricycle, I couldn't put my finger on it, but it....it looked *familiar*. Almost as if I'd seen it before somewhere. Trying to shake off the odd feeling, I turned and called to Carpenter's back. \"Hey, Sean, would you fucking look at this? I just found an honest-to-god tricycle down here on the-\" I trailed off as I turned back. It was gone. It had vanished into thin air. Or in this case, thin water. I blinked a couple of times, trying to rationalize with my own mind. \"What the...\" I shook my head hard, then looked down at my gauges, suddenly concerned with my own safety. *Am I developing N.N.???* Nitrogen Narcosis is a reversible, but at these depths a very dangerous alteration in consciousness caused by the anesthetic effect of certain gasses at high pressures, which comes with a variety of symptoms. One of which includes auditory and visual hallucinations. To combat this, we were using a mixture of helium and oxygen in our air supply, but at these previously unventured depths with diving suits, I wondered if the mixture wasn't potent enough to ward off the onset.\n\n\"You say something, boss?\" I heard Carpenter call behind me. Still trying to come to a conclusion in my own mind, I decided not to tell him what I'd just seen. Not yet, anyways. \"Nothing, man\" I called back. For another minute or so, I gazed out into the darkness, trying to piece together jigsaw puzzles in my mind, to figure if we should head back or not, just in case my assumptions were correct. I decided it'd be better to be safe than sorry. \"Hey, Sean, let's round up the others and head back to base. I don't think something's right here\" He didn't answer me. I turned, my worry giving way to a small twinge of annoyance. \"Did you hear me, man?”\n\nCarpenter was gone. There was absolutely no trace that he'd ever been there, except for his bag of gear, which lay untouched where he'd put it down. *What the shit?!* I looked down the row of columns to see if I could see the orange-yellowish outline of his suit or the beam of his shoulder lights. Nothing. *Where the hell did he go?!* He couldn't have slipped away that quietly, the thrusters make too much sound to do so, and unless he'd somehow mastered running away underwater in an eight hundred pound diving suit, he couldn't have disappeared on foot. Confusion gave way to the first tendrils of worry. I looked up at the nearest team to me, which were Figueroa and Brockmann. \"Hey, guys?” I called out in a voice that shook a little. \"Did either of you see Carpenter pass by you?\" They both looked over in confusion at me. “No, isn’t he with you?” I didn’t answer. Worry had begun to be crept up on by the first real tendrils of fear. I tried to keep my mind in check, I had to control myself; all of my team were counting on me to get them back safely, but in my mind, I couldn't help it. My memory shot back to a painting I'd purchased for my house about three years ago. A painting of a deep sea diver in an old school suit, light emanating from his helmet, as dozens of huge tentacles appeared behind him out of the gloom, ready to snatch him in an eternal embrace and drag him backwards to a watery grave-\n\nI spun around to face the darkness that I had turned my back to, almost half expecting to see that very sight before me. But there was nothing there. Just blackness. By this time, I could hear the rest of my team churning up frenzy over the comms. They had all heard me, and were now calling out, trying to get Carpenter to reply to them, to no avail. Carruthers was also trying to cut through the barrage of voices, trying to understand what was going on. Sheer panic and chaos had suddenly come crashing down on all of us. Pulling myself together, I summoned all of the emotional strength I could muster. “Shut up!” I yelled as loud as I could into my mic. The jumble of voices ceased immediately. Quickly, I relayed to Carruthers what had happened, and asked him what the best course of action would be to take, with the knowledge that we only had about an hour and a quarter of air remaining. He was quiet for a moment, and then gave the order for us to search for our missing teammate for fifteen minutes, no longer. Then get our asses back to the base, on the double. “Copy that” I told him, and then told the rest of my team to gather up at my position. As one, we made our way through the ruins for the next fifteen minutes, calling out over the comms, trying to get a response from Carpenter. But we found no trace of him at all. It was as if he'd been wiped from existence. With a vise gripping around my heart and an unshakeable feeling of dread coursing through me, I gave the order at fifteen minutes for the rest of us to head back, and stay close to each other. As we began our way back along the guide line, I swear that it felt like the darkness held at bay around us by the lights seemed to creep just a little bit closer, as if testing to see if it could reach us.",

But all that changed one fateful day.\n\nI was on my way home from work, walking down the same old street I always took. That's when I saw her. A woman in a long, flowing dress, walking towards me. She was beautiful, but there was something off about her. Her eyes were empty, her movements robotic.\n\nAs I got closer, I saw that her dress was stained with blood. I tried to run, but I couldn't move. I was paralyzed with fear. She walked right up to me and whispered in my ear, \"Always be aware of your surroundings.\"\n\nI woke up in my bed, covered in sweat. It was just a dream, I told myself. But it didn't feel like a dream. It felt too real.\n\nThe next day, I told my friend Marcus about the dream. \"That's messed up, man,\" he said. \"But it was just a dream, right?\"\n\nI nodded, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. I started paying more attention to my surroundings, looking for anything out of the ordinary. That's when I noticed the man in the suit, following me everywhere I went.\n\nI told Marcus about the man, but he just laughed it off. \"You're paranoid, man. Just relax.\"\n\nBut I couldn't relax. The man was always there, watching me. One day, he finally approached me.\n\n\"Hello, John,\" he said. \"I've been watching you.\"\n\n\"How do you know my name?\" I asked.\n\n\"That's not important,\" he said. \"What is important is that you need to come with me. We have important work to do.\"\n\nI tried to run, but he was too fast. He dragged me to a van and threw me inside. I was tied up, blindfolded, and driven to a secret location.\n\nWhen the blindfold was finally removed, I saw Marcus tied up next to me.\n\n\"What the hell is going on?\" I asked.\n\nThe man in the suit stepped forward. \"We've been watching you, John. We know about your dreams. And we need your help.\"\n\n\"Help with what?\" I demanded.\n\n\"Something very important,\" he said. \"You see, we've been experimenting with the human mind. We've discovered a way to manipulate dreams, to make them into reality.\"\n\nHe showed us a video of a creature unlike anything I'd ever seen. It was a lab-created monster, designed for war. But something had gone wrong. It had turned on its creators and escaped.\n\n\"That thing is out there, John,\" the man in the suit said. \"And it's killing people. We need you to use your dreams to find it, to track it down and stop it.\"\n\nI couldn't believe what I was hearing. But Marcus seemed to be on board.\n\n\"We have to do this, John,\" he said. \"We have to stop it.\"\n\nSo we set out on our mission, using our dreams to track the monster. It was a terrifying journey, full of danger and unexpected twists. We encountered other people like us, people who had been recruited for this mission.\n\nBut the monster was always one step ahead of us. It was like it could sense us, like it knew we were coming. And every time we got close, it would disappear.\n\nEventually, we tracked it to an abandoned factory on the outskirts of town. We found it there, hiding in the shadows.\n\nBut it wasn't alone. The woman from my dream was there",

But there was something about her, something that drew me in like a moth to a flame.\n\nWe talked for hours, laughing and flirting like we didn't have a care in the world. She told me about her life, about her travels and her adventures. And I listened, captivated by every word that fell from her lips.\n\nBut then, as the night wore on, things began to take a turn.\n\nIt started with little things, like the way she would stare at me for too long, or the way her smile would freeze in place. And then it escalated, until it was like a living, breathing nightmare.\n\nShe would show up at my apartment unannounced, banging on the door until I let her in. She would call me at all hours of the night, whispering things into the phone that made my blood run cold. And then there were the gifts, the things she would leave for me on my doorstep, like a lock of her hair or a piece of jewelry.\n\nI tried to break things off, to tell her that I couldn't see her anymore. But every time I tried, she would find me, her eyes burning into mine as she begged me to stay.\n\nAnd then, one night, she showed up at my door with a look in her eyes that I'll never forget. It was like all the light had gone out of her, leaving behind only darkness and pain.\n\n\"I need your help,\" she said, her voice barely above a whisper. \"There's something following me, something that won't leave me alone.\"\n\nI didn't want to get involved. I wanted to run away, to forget that she ever existed. But I couldn't ignore the desperation in her eyes, the way she clung to me like a drowning man to a life raft.\n\nWe drove out to the old abandoned church on the edge of town, the one that had been closed for years. It was dark and silent, the kind of place that made your skin crawl just being near it.\n\nAnd then I saw it.\n\nIt was like a shadow, a shapeless thing that moved in the corner of my eye. At first, I thought it was just my imagination, a product of my fear. But then it began to take form.\n\nIt was like a person, but not quite. Its limbs were too long, its fingers too sharp.

I could feel it creeping closer, its breath hot and putrid on the back of my neck. And then it spoke, its voice a low, rumbling growl.\n\n\"I've been waiting for you.\"\n\nAnd then everything went black.\n\nWhen I woke up, I was back in my apartment. There was no sign of her, no sign of the creature that had chased us. But I knew that it was still out there, waiting for me.\n\nI never saw her again after that night. But sometimes, when I'm alone in the dark, I can feel its presence. I can feel its eyes on me, watching, waiting.\n\nAnd I know that one day, it will come for me.",

It had no face, just a gaping maw that seemed to stretch on forever. And it was always watching me, always waiting.\n\nI tried to tell people about it, but no one believed me. They thought I was hallucinating, that I was still suffering from the effects of my head injury. But I knew it was real. I could feel it in my bones.\n\nIt began to follow me, everywhere I went. It was like a shadow, always lurking just out of sight. I would catch glimpses of it in reflections, or see it darting around corners. And every time I saw it, I felt a cold, sickening fear in the pit of my stomach.\n\nI began to withdraw from the world, staying inside my apartment for days at a time. I stopped answering my phone, stopped seeing my friends. The only thing that mattered was the shadow, and the terrible, creeping feeling that it gave me.\n\nAnd then, one night, I woke up to find it standing at the foot of my bed.\n\nI could feel its breath on my face, hot and putrid. Its eyes were fixed on mine, and I could feel the weight of its gaze like a physical thing. And then it spoke, its voice a low, rumbling growl.\n\n\"Remember.\"\n\nAnd then it was gone.\n\nI don't know what it means. I don't know what it wants from me. All I know is that it's always there, watching, waiting. And I'm afraid that one day, it will consume me completely.",

        "text": "it all started when i was walking down the street.\n\ni saw a man, tall and slender. he walked up to me and said:\n\n'ze zitten achter je aan' which translates too: they're after you\n\ni looked at him and said 'what?' he replied by saying, 'you will understand soon enough.'\n\nwhen i got home i went immediately to sleep. i dreamed about a man called james searching for me, in a room like the backrooms but the place had a red misty type of fog. i remember it clearly. when he finally found me, he said 'this is a warning and preview of what you will endure' before choking me, and the dream ended. \n\nwhen i awoke i got up and browsed the internet for a bit (this was at about 3:30) and found a video i couldn't not see. it was a story of a murder called james who had been arrested for life. he eventually died in that prison. i have no idea why i watched this at that time, but i eventually forgot about that video and went to sleep. i keep searching for that video but i cant find it. so anyway, when i went to sleep i dreamed about the man called james again. this time the dream was set up like an interveiw but without any cameras. he told me he was dutch and before the dream ended he said, 'does it all make sense now?' i woke up and the time was 7:16, which is interesting because if clocks went past 60 it would say 6:66. when i woke up then, i realized the man i spoke to wasnt even alive. i also remembered later in the day, that in the dream, he had said something similar to an idea of 'i seek revenge on humanity for what it has done to me and my friends. i must collect the souls of men to have our plans work out. you seem to have a special soul more interesting than the ones ive heard of.'\n\nit was at that moment i realized that maybe when he is saying 'they' he may be refering to his friends, and maybe he wants my soul before they can get me. i was terrified. i didnt know why he needed souls to have revenge on people but maybe it was something i didnt see. \n\ni then felt something within me. it said, 'you are stronger than this, you just dont understand yet.'\n\ni then found an ability i didnt know could even be possible, let alone be used on-command.\n\ni could come out of my physical body and float around, and i could even basically teleport anywhere. i then realized i could see other souls too. i saw my soul body as a purple color and the rest of the souls as a yellow color. i could move objects with my mind and even decide to become visible to the human's  eye. i realized i could control my physical body while being a floating soul. like i could study for tests while exploring mount everest and other things like that.\n\ni then saw another soul that happened to be James. he spoke to me. (i see its worth mentioning i wasnt scared when i came out of my physical mind) and said, 'i need your soul for its power. you have immense ability i must have.' \n\nat that moment it all made sense.\n\nthey wanted to use my powers to terrorize/terrify people into doing what they want before killing them, so they could use combined power to be strong enough to become alive again.\n\ni then felt a sudden feeling of power i had never felt before. i was stronger than them and no one exactly realized it. i could bend the human's perception of objects and time and maybe other things.\n\nbasically, i was the scariest and most interesting ghost i had heard of.\n\nit was like a lucid dream but i could control exactly \"everything\"\n\ni then absorbed the powers of james and his friends, and realized i could do very interesting things.\n\nthings like see into the near future and warn people of upcoming events. travel across the world and animate my body into a human state and disappear and stuff. (like james did when i first saw him)\n\nwhen i animate my human body like that, i could do anything. stand on mount everest and chose to feel or not feel the cold. i could become friends with someone in another country and perhaps tell them im a ghost and show them cool tricks. i could make many duplicates of myself instead of just one duplicate, and spend time in different places at the same time.",

        "text": "My mom was on her routine shift at the hospital and I knew I wouldn't see her til the next morning, in a deep sleep on her bed, likely still in her uniform. I always made her breakfast before I would leave for school in the morning so she could wake up to a nice meal. I use the word “nice” loosely, it’s the best I could do considering I’m sixteen and failed my home economics class last year. But my mom never minded the toast, scrambled eggs, and turkey bacon platter left on her nightstand.\n\nWe had said our goodbyes around 10:15 and I got myself comfortable on the couch with my dog to watch some TV. I turned the lights off over us to set the scene and make it feel more like a movie theater. I had got through one *Dateline* episode when I decided that I could enjoy the experience a little more if I grabbed my bong. So, I went upstairs and down the long, narrow hallway that led to my wing of the house. I was the only occupied room on this side of the house, the other rooms were my dad’s old office and the guest room. Though that room hasn’t had a guest in it for years, ever since my dad’s passing, my mom and I haven’t even wanted to host other people here. Instead, it hosts the overload of clutter I find at the end of every school year: clothes that I no longer want and plan on selling or donating, paintings I worked months on but never hang up, and other miscellaneous items that aren’t used but can’t seem to be let go of either.\n\nI opened my bedroom door and grabbed the piece off my nightstand. It was almost a sculpture rather than a cheesy bong you imagine when you think of a stoner. It was about sixteen inches tall made completely out of this blue, hand blown glass that resembled the light blue the ocean looks after a series of rough waves. The glass swirled in an upward motion towards the mouth piece that made it look like it was water, frozen in time. My favorite feature of this prized possession is its ability to glow in the dark. After letting it sit in the sun for a bit, at night flecks of the glass would glow a bright green.\n\nI walked back down the hallway with it, then back down the stairs until I was sitting down on the couch next to Pepe, my dog. He was sound asleep as I started to grind up the green, sticky plant matter. Which was genuinely what the name was, “Plant matter”, it was this new strain I had just bought from my regular plug in the next town over. He had told me he just recently got a limited supply of this stuff and asked me if I could be one of his test subjects to see if he should buy more. Without hesitation, I agreed. Discounted weed to just give my feedback? I’d be a fool not to take that offer, so I did.\n\nHolding it in my hand I saw a multitude of colors that reflected off its crystals. It’s common to see colors like purple and orange but this stuff had red, blue, and pink.\n\n“Odd”, I thought.\n\nBut I was taken over by more intrigue than suspicion so I continued to put some in the bowl and pack it down with my lighter. After the first inhale, I got the taste of regular weed, but with a slight trace of citrus. It was pleasant, and I was paying extra attention to its experience so I could give a good, detailed report back to the plug like he had asked.\n\nAbout fifteen minutes went by, *Dateline* was still playing and this specific episode seemed to be extra interesting to me in my new hazy state. The cushions beneath me started to almost mold to my body, I felt as though I was sinking yet weighed as light as a feather at the same time. My eyes started to get dry, keeping them open became a task more so than a natural ability at this point. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nAs I slowly started to move my eyes behind my lids, I realized that I had fallen asleep. It must have been for quite a while because I felt so sluggish, like it used all the strength within me just to be able to fully open my eyes. The lights above the living room were still off, like I had left them, but the all others on the downstairs floor were too. It was now pitch black everywhere except for the surrounding area where the light emitting from the TV could reach, which was not very far. \n\nThe second thing I noticed was what sent a cold chill running through my body and caused my heart to start racing.\n\nI was paralyzed.\n\nI was physically unable to move any part of my body other than my eyes, tips of fingers, and toes. I was only able to produce slight twitches but it took so much strength out of me to do so.\n\nSo there I was, almost completely paralyzed, unable to move or scream for help while the TV numbingly continued the program like I was still an attentive, consenting viewer. Pepe was still soundly asleep beside me, blissfully unaware of the living hell I was experiencing just inches away from his sleeping head.\n\nI tried reaching for him. Maybe he would sense my distress and…\n\n“Then what,” I thought to myself “what the hell would happen next that could possibly help this situation?”\n\nThe answer was nothing.\n\nI felt as though Keith Morrison was now mocking me and the couch cushion below me that once felt made for me was now stiff and cold. As if every fiber in the fabric were rejecting my body. \n\nI started to panic.\n\nNot because the realization of this situation was settling in, but because I heard a creak from upstairs.\n\nI knew this house like the back of my hand. It’s the only house I have ever lived in so I knew that each floorboard had its own creak and this one, this one I recognized as the top of the stairs. Someone was in my home and they were standing at the top of the staircase that led down directly to the room I was in. \n\nEach crack that followed the last made my eyes water. The sound resembled what I might imagine a rib being snapped in half would make, at least that's what jolts of pain felt like. Hearing the footsteps descend the stairs made my stomach turn, it made my body writhe in pain from the inside out. \n\nStaring at the one visible stair from my position on the couch made me want to recoil into my skin. I did not want to see the intruder, the person who would be able to have their way with me in such a vulnerable state. Though I could not rip my gaze from the stairs. If someone was going to do whatever evil they intended, I was going to see it coming.\n\nSeconds felt like minutes, my heart sped so fast that each beat felt seconds apart. I was shaking and dripping in sweat. The sound from the TV faded away as a long, piercing ring filled its place.\n\nA hand gripped the side of the wall that was obstructing my view of the stairs and the person attached to the hand.\n\nI now only heard the shallow scream coming from the back of my throat, the only level of sound I could muster up in my frozen state. I was a deer in headlights, the perfect victim for any predator. It was hard to say what was if I was still paralyzed or if the sheer terror I felt in that moment was responsible for my immobilization.\n\nThe hand methodically lifted its fingers and tapped each one of them back down making a sickening drumming noise. Once, then twice, then three times before the rest of the body was slightly illuminated when the thing moved to the last and final stair. \n\nAs it revealed its form, my eyes trailed up to at least eight feet in the air. It was gigantic. Its limbs were as long as its height and the creature’s face had a mouth that stretched from side to side. It wore a gut-wrenching expression that could only be described as a smile due to the fact that it had no teeth. Just a huge mouth stretched agape with bleeding gums that dripped down to my wood floors, an indication that this was not a figment of imagination but a real, dangerous threat and I needed to step into action immediately. \n\nIt produced a menacing, horrid laugh as it witnessed me using every ounce of energy I had in my body to just cry out. Anything, something to alert anyone. But all I could do was cry silently, my eyes streamed with tears while I stared unblinking at the creature slowly approaching me like a lion would their prey.\n\nIt made it off the last stair now. Its long arms dangled behind its moving legs, dragging along the floor still drumming its fingers.\n\nIt was moving at a slow pace because it knew I couldn’t move. It knew that dragging out this hellish scene would make the kill all the more satisfying for its demented desire.\n\nIt was mere feet away from me and I was able to see its face fully illuminated now and it was horrifying.\n\nStill smiling with its red gums, its small eyes were as wide as its anatomy allowed and they never left mine. It had a nose but it was just two holes that looked like they were hand poked into this God awful creation. It was almost as if it were human, but the devil seemed to have poisoned this one.\n\nIt was now close enough to smell my fear and see the glint of hope for survival fading in my eyes. I had to do something, anything that would make me feel like I at least tried to fight for my life.\n\nThat’s when I saw it in the corner of my eye. This faint green glow just inches away from my frozen hand: my bong. \n\nAmongst all the chaos I forgot about it, but something within me clicked and told me to try to move again. So I did, I focused all of my energy toward moving my hand to grabbing my newly chosen weapon and it worked. I was able to grab it and within moments I had swung the thick glass vase over the creature's head again and again and again.\n\nIts blood wasn’t red like the color dripping from its toothless smile, instead it was dark black. The black tar-like blood was everywhere. I felt it hit my face, go into my mouth, and saw it cover the couch, floors, and walls.\n\nThe scene was brutal. The once terrifying creature was now smashed and bent in a multitude of ways. Its face was no longer distinguishable from the other battered parts of its body and I smiled. I smiled now that that thing no longer had his.\n\nI stood over its body with a mix of shock, adrenaline, and joy that I almost laughed if it were not for my intense panting. I could not stop breathing. I thought I was going to pass out.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nI awoke to the feeling of bed sheets and my head laying on a pillow.\n\nThe relief that this was all a dream showered over my body as I went to stretch my limbs and slowly opened my eyes.\n\nBut I couldn’t.\n\nThe sound of metal hitting against itself brought my attention to the handcuffs around my wrists. The slow beeping that was hidden in the background got drawn forward as I scanned my surroundings.\n\nI was in a hospital room, still covered in that sticky, metallic smelling goo. Though it was not black like I dreamed, it was crimson red.\n\nThe voice of an unfamiliar man brought me back to the present.\n\n“Miss,” the officer said in a low and careful tone, “do you remember last night?”\n\nOf course I did. I don’t think I will ever be able to get that disgusting smile out of my head. The immense fear I felt can still be present if I just closed my eyes.\n\n“Y- yes,” it was the first time I heard my own voice in hours, “there was this…*thing.*”\n\nThe officer gave an unamused look to his colleague as he let out a deep breath and threw a stack of images on my lap.\n\nMy *mother* laid violently killed our living room floor. If it weren’t for her nursing uniform I wouldn’t have been able to tell that it was even human. Before I was able to even process what the officers were insinuating I had done, I screamed.\n\nI screamed so loud that I felt my vocal cords rubbing against each other as it was followed by a flood of tears.\n\nOut of my guttural screams I heard a hauntingly familiar sound: I looked up to see the officer drumming his fingers on his notepad and watched as his mouth stretched into that distinct, disgusting, toothless smile.",

        "text": "I feel like I can’t do anything right.  Except it’s not really me that’s at fault here.  You’ve all been telling me this for a while now and even [the literal devil is getting in on bullying me](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11aijs7/how_to_survive_college_something_is_after_cassie/) into standing up for myself so maybe I should work harder at believing that.  My therapist says that maybe I’m blaming myself for everything that goes wrong because I want to feel like things are actually under my control.  That my actions matter and that I can change the outcome of what happens to myself and the people around me.\n\nIt’s funny, isn’t it?  I’ve said that people ignore the inhuman because they’re scared of a world where who you are and what you do *doesn’t matter*, that bad things can still happen to good people because of chaotic, random chance.\n\nBut in the end, I guess I don’t want that to be real.  Maybe everyone else can be foolish in their willful ignorance but I *knew* better and I *thought* I had accepted that, but I also thought that because I know better I can *change* things and there wasn’t anything that was out of my power to fix.\n\nCoping mechanisms.\n\nDaniel is alive.  So am I and so is Maria.\n\nBut so is the worm.\n\nAnd someone else isn’t.\n\nLet’s start with our conversation with Daniel.\n\n (if you’re new, [start here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/rnauck/how_to_survive_the_holidays/), and if you’re totally lost, [this might help](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/comments/s75n1c/how_to_survive_college_index/)) \n\nIt went better than I expected.  I was even optimistic when it wrapped up.  We met him on Friday evening, over dinner at the student union.  I thought that was a bad idea, considering how he seemed perfectly willing to blow up at me in public, but Maria insisted.  Clearly she has more confidence in Daniel’s ability to pull himself together than I do.  So we showed up and sat down and Maria did most of the talking.\n\nTonight, she said - and I was a little surprised, because I thought we were going to try Saturday night, but I guess she took one look at the scratches on his face and changed her mind - we’d all go over to his dorm room.  We’d show up just before the worm arrived and no one would talk so we wouldn’t wake up his roommate.\n\n(for the record, I was deeply uncomfortable at the thought of sneaking into a room while someone was asleep, especially after what happened with Cassie)\n\n(I do have updates about Cassie but not right now, I have too much to talk about regarding Daniel)\n\nWe’d go into the hallway with him, Maria explained.  Unsurprisingly, he balked at that point.  Maria quickly calmed him down by pointing out that he wouldn't be alone and he certainly wouldn’t be defenseless.  She lowered her voice and told him that she had some weapons hidden in her dorm room and she'd bring them with her when we came.  It’d be three against one, she said.  We’d be well-prepared.  That thing was nothing but a giant mindless worm.  We’d try to kill it together.\n\n“But didn’t you like… forget where you were?” he asked desperately.  “What if I’m just standing there and you’re staring uselessly?”\n\n“You just have to take that first step,” Maria replied calmly.  “I’ve got glass jars we’re going to fill with gasoline.  You throw one of those and I’m sure that’ll break us out of our trance.  And then we light it up.”\n\nHe fretted nervously for a minute.  Maria subtly kicked me under the table, which was my cue to give him an ‘out’.  A way for him to think he could back out, but in reality he wasn’t going to need it, because this was going to work and he *was* going to kill the worm like he was supposed to.\n\n“I think we can switch targets,” I said.  “I saw it happen with another creature around campus.  I got out of the room, thinking it was only after me, but it… went after… the person that was still there.”\n\nI tried to keep a straight face.  I needed to sound confident if Daniel was going to go along with our plan, which meant I couldn’t think of how horrible I felt about what happened to that student.\n\n“So if something goes wrong,” he said slowly, “I leave the hallway first?”\n\n“Yep,” I confirmed, “and then Maria and then me.  If my theory is correct, it’ll switch the target.”\n\nIt wouldn’t.  We didn’t know what the trigger that got the worm’s attention was.  But Maria and I just watched Daniel as he thought it over, our expressions carefully determined, waiting for him to buy into our plan.\n\n“Do you remember what happened to Patricia?” I said.  It was time to play my appeal to emotion.  “Do you remember how angry you were?  How you demanded that we do *something* to the creature that killed them?  It’s not the same creature, but this is your chance to fight back.  To do *something*.”\n\nI sat there, staring him in the eyes, my hands folded on the table.  He stared back at me and I waited for the confusion on his face to clear, for him to realize that *yes*, this was his chance to stop feeling so scared and helpless.\n\nIt never happened.\n\n“Who is Patricia?” he asked.\n\n“Okay so we’re meeting tonight just before midnight,” Maria hastily said, standing and slamming her hands on the table.  “Great.  Good talk, everyone.  Don’t worry Daniel, we’ve got this handled.”\n\nHe nodded absently.  I guess that while we didn’t get a firm commitment, him agreeing because Maria wasn’t giving him a choice was the next best thing.  Then she grabbed my arm and we hurried out of the student union.\n\n“Who is Patricia?!” Maria hissed as soon as we were outside.  “What the HELL?”\n\n“People forget,” I muttered, running my hands through my hair.  “Cassie - she said everyone but her forgot her roommate after she vanished.”\n\n“So he’s forgotten Patricia?  But we haven’t?”\n\nI nodded.  I wanted to scream.  My chest felt tight.  I know it’s not true, that what I did to destroy the eyeball mattered very much, but it still felt like somehow I’d failed.  Patricia was forgotten.  This campus had won in the end.  It’d eaten them up and made sure no one ever saw their remains.\n\nIt made it hard to carry on with our plan, to be honest.  I just felt *exhausted*.  Like the only thing keeping me going was the thought that all this work and worry was going to help someone in the end and for some reason, hearing that Daniel had *forgotten* about Patricia ripped all that away.  Maybe I’m being silly.  But I just didn’t have any heart to go meet Maria and help her transport her arsenal over to Daniel’s room once it was late enough at night.  At least she took my silence as grim determination.  She carried plastic bags, each layered inside the other and tied tightly to hide the smell of gasoline.  Inside were glass mason jars that she’d filled up somewhere off-campus, so that she wouldn’t be seen and so that the smell of the gasoline wouldn’t linger.\n\nIt was a simple plan.  Maria and I would carry the jars, one each.  We had more, but we needed our hands free to hold onto Daniel.  Our hope was that contact with him would ward off the strange mind effects, for he was the intended target after all.  Once we got close to the worm, we’d unscrew the lids and throw the jars.  There were more in the bag and Daniel would carry that on his wrist.  Once it was soaked, then Daniel would let go of us and get the molotov cocktail out.\n\nHe’d set it on fire, throw, and then grab us again and we’d all flee together while it burned.\n\nNone of us had ever made or thrown a molotov cocktail but I’d heard that some of the guys in my class back home had done it so it had to work.  Maria had everything ready to go.  He only had to pull the bottle out of its many layers of protective plastic baggies, light and throw.\n\nHe didn’t seem too pleased to see us when we knocked softly at his door.  We’d gotten lucky and his roommate was out and likely wouldn’t be back until much later in the night, if he came back tonight at all.  We laid out the plan for him and showed him everything we’d brought.\n\n“It’ll be fine,” Maria said encouragingly as he stared nervously at the bottle and the lighter.  “We’ll be right there.”\n\nHe glanced at the door and then at his watch.  It was almost time.  He took a deep, shuddering breath, and nodded.\n\nHe was going to do this.\n\nFinally.\n\nWe put the handle of the bag holding the gasoline jars over his wrist.  The bag with the molotov cocktail went on the other wrist.  \n\nI stepped into the hallway first.  In my free hand I held a jar.  My other hand clutched at Daniel’s hand.  A strange sense of pressure ran over me as I left the safety of the dorm room.  Like trying to step through plastic wrap.  It passed quickly and I was standing in the hallway, one hand stretched behind me to keep hold of Daniel, and my mind was clear.\n\n“It’s fine,” I told them.  “This is working.”\n\nDaniel entered next.  Then Maria.  We stood side by side and faced the approaching worm.  It wasn’t all that far away from Daniel’s door, perhaps only eight doors away.  Much closer than when I came in here.\n\nI tried to take a step forward, but Daniel didn’t budge.  He didn’t let go of my hand, but he was frozen in place, staring straight ahead at the approaching worm.  His face was pale, the scratches on it as red as cherries in the harsh overhead lights.\n\nThe worm was no longer making its leisurely way down the hallway.  It was bigger than I remembered.  It filled the upper half of the hallway, its sides nearly touching the walls.  Its thin stilt-like legs moved in unison.\n\nAnd it saw Daniel.  It had no face, but it *knew* he was there.  The cohesion in its movements broke down.  Its legs churned chaotically.  A ripple ran along the length of its body, starting from the back and working its way towards us.  It was like watching the tide come in at the beach, and as it reached the front of the creature, the worm opened its mouth.\n\nIt didn’t have a face.  It only had a mouth.\n\nThe flesh split into four portions, peeling back like a tin can, and the inside jaw was thrust forward.  It ripped free from the flesh holding it in place, tearing away from the skin, and I could see the dripping muscle beneath holding the bones and the teeth in place.  Its saliva became long, stringy loops, dripping from its jaws. The tip of its long tongue flicked the drool around its exposed jaw and where it touched muscle, it solidified into a new layer of ivory flesh.  Like a caterpillar spinning a cocoon.  It was spinning itself new flesh.\n\nThis all happened in less than a minute.  Another ripple had started at the rear of its body, rapidly traveling up to the head, and behind it was another and another.  One of the ripples paused and then bulged outwards to either side, and legs split out of the flesh, thin and slick with fluid, reaching down to the floor on needle-like points.  \n\nThey weren’t actually legs, I realized.  I mean, that’s what they *looked* like, and they were moving like legs, but they were just going through the motions.  They barely touched the ground and they certainly weren’t gaining enough traction to move the worm forward.\n\nIt wasn’t *walking* down the corridor.  It was *growing* to fill the length of the corridor.  Growing until it reached Daniel’s door.\n\nExcept now its growth was speeding up.  It saw Daniel.  And it was coming for him.\n\n“Stick to the plan,” Maria said, but her voice was a thin squeak.\n\nWe were all scared.  Daniel’s hand in mine was cold and damp.  I tore my eyes away from the approaching monstrosity long enough to glance at him.  His face was pale, his mouth open and his lips trembling.  We had to do this, I thought, before his nerve broke.\n\n“Let’s go,” I said.\n\nIt wasn’t after me.  That’s what I told myself.  It was like Krampus, it would just pass me by because I hadn’t done anything, I wasn’t the reason it was here.  That’s how I got myself to take a step towards it and then Maria did the same and Daniel just came along with us because he had to.\n\nThe worm was growing as fast as it could, its jaw lunging forward a foot at a time.  It left splatters of blood on the hallway walls.  The flesh barely had time to solidify before it was ripped open anew as the muscles contracted and forced the jaw free.  Its four jawbones clacked together like a giant pincer, rattling the teeth in their sockets.  There were holes pitting its body, revealing the pink muscle beneath, for it couldn’t slather its saliva across itself fast enough to cover its body entirely with new skin.  It was still creating legs, but those came at uneven intervals now, skipping segments, and a few of them emerged only half-formed - one leg only or both legs stunted and waving uselessly in midair.\n\nI hefted the jar of gasoline.  This was a good plan, I told myself.  Fire was one of our most ancient weapons.  Surely it’d work.\n\nWe were almost within throwing range.  And that is where it all went wrong, because it also realized that Daniel was almost in range.\n\nIt lunged forward.  The jaws ripped free and *kept going*, two spindly legs tearing their way out through the front of its skin.  The flesh continued ripping, a long seam opening up down its underbelly where the thin, barely formed flesh could not hold any longer.  Like an overfilled garbage bag finally breaking at its seam.  Its muscles spilled forth, thrashing wildly, trying to propel the jaws close enough so that they could snatch up Daniel and dash him to pieces against the walls of the hallway.\n\nI raised my arm to throw.\n\nToo late.  Too slow.\n\nFor Daniel shrieked as the snapping jaws slammed against the walls and floor, the trembling legs dragging the insides of its body out of its ruined flesh in one last desperate attempt to connect with its prey.\n\nHe let go of our hands.\n\nAnd with him went my coherence.\n\nI remember the feel of the jar slipping from my hand.  I don’t remember when I lowered my arm.  I only know that I did and it fell onto the ground uselessly, bounced off my foot, and rolled away.\n\nI remember half-turning my head towards Daniel.  Opening my mouth to say something to him.  But he wasn’t there, there was only an open doorway beside me.  A single open door among all of them arrayed down the length of the corridor.  If I could see what lay beyond it, I can’t recall what it was.\n\nI remembered thinking that if it had changed its target, then there was nothing I could do to save myself.  For its jaws were inches away, so close I could see the shine of the droplets of blood and saliva on its teeth.  \n\nThen it slammed into me as it went racing past.  I was thrown against the wall, I felt hot moisture soaking the front of my shirt, and there was an impression of something rushing past me - like a gust of wind.  \n\nMy mind was clear.  I was leaning against the hallway wall and the front of my shirt was soaked with fresh blood.  Maria stood opposite me, pale and shaking, her eyes fixed on the doorway that Daniel had escaped through.\n\nThe creature was gone.\n\nAnd the door was closed.  Neither of us said anything.  I reached over and tried the doorknob.\n\nIt didn’t open.\n\nThe hallway was silent except for the sound of our rapid breathing.  Everything about it felt… wrong.  It was profoundly empty in a way that felt somehow familiar.  I’d experienced it before.\n\nMy house.  It felt like my family’s house after dad vanished.  Like the moment when I’d wake in the morning and expect to hear his voice from the kitchen because everything felt the *same* and *of course* he’d be there but there was only silence and I knew the emptiness was permanent.\n\nThat’s what it felt like.\n\nI wonder how many more hollow shells are laying around our world, after the monster is dead or gone.\n\n“We-we should probably leave,” Maria said.  “Before his roommate gets back and closes the door.”\n\nI was still too shocked by what had happened to reply coherently, so I only nodded, and we stumbled off towards our remaining exit.  We left our jars of gasoline and molotov cocktail behind.  No sense trying to smuggle those back out of here.  We didn’t need them anymore.\n\nThe door was still open and we slipped into his room and Maria quietly shut it behind us.  Then she opened it again and there was the regular dorm hallway.  Someone was playing music a few doors down, loud enough that we could hear the faint trace of a melody.  It was a comforting sound.  We were back.  We’d made it out.\n\n“What do we do now?” Maria asked once we were outside, walking together in the direction of our own dorms.\n\nI didn’t have a good answer for her, other than finding out if Daniel was still alive.\n\nI’m tired.  I guess this is what happens when you try to save everyone.  The effort drains your blood, grinds up your bones, and leaves you as nothing but dust.  That’s how I feel.  Like I’ve given everything and all that’s left of me is dust.\n\nMaria tracked Daniel down the next day.  She staked out the lobby of his dorm room until she saw him slinking out, trying to hurry to the door before she saw him.  It didn’t work.  She ran after him and pestered him until he admitted to what happened after he escaped through that unknown doorway.\n\nHe found himself in someone else’s dorm room.  The occupant was awake and was startled to see him bursting in through his door.  They didn’t have long to be surprised, though, for the worm came charging through moments later.\n\nDaniel was knocked to the floor.  He heard a scream and then blood splattered… everywhere.  He didn’t know what happened.  He was curled on the ground in a screaming ball of abject terror, unable to move, unable to do anything to save himself or that poor random person that had nothing to do with any of this.\n\nWhen the noises died down, Daniel found the nerve to raise his head and look.  All around him was scattered bits of the student’s insides.  Pieces of tissue, shards of bone, stringy lumps of muscle.  Everything inside the student had been scooped out and discarded.  Like hollowing out a pumpkin.\n\nBut the student was still on his feet.  He turned to look down at Daniel, a broad, thin smile on his face.  Then he walked out of the room.  That’s it.  Walked away and left Daniel there on the gore-coated floor.\n\nI shouldn’t have told him these creatures could switch targets.  I shouldn’t have given him the idea.  I knew there was a good chance he’d run, but I thought if he did, he’d run back to his dorm room and we’d get a chance to try again, to talk him into it, but instead… he ran into someone else’s room.  And they died because of it.\n\nThe worm has escaped the hallway.  It has a body and it’s loose on campus.  And maybe Daniel isn’t of interest anymore, but I don’t think this is over.  It can’t be.\n\nI don’t know what to do about it.

        "text": "I’ve been working construction for over 30 years now. I began as an apprentice back in the early 90’s, and steadily moved my way up to where I am now in the finance department of a different company in the same industry. \n\nBack in 2005 we got a contract from a new client that we had not worked with previously. At the time, we were a small outfit of only about 20 employees. Our sales team was through the roof with excitement, and once the payment figure for the contract was let slip the rest of us were too. This contract was by far the largest our company had ever landed, but of course things weren’t so simple.\n\nThere were a lot of weird stipulations given to us by the interested party. It’s not exactly an employee’s place to know everything about the interested suitor, but this was far beyond the norm. Management wouldn’t say anything about the project or who the interested party was which was a bit unusual.  \n\nOne day I was brought into the office for a meeting with two of our human resource members. I was sweating bullets, fearing I’d done something wrong but thankfully that was quickly proved to not be the case. After a brief conversation of semantics, one of the ladies posed a question.\n\n“Are you willing to work out of state?” I thought about it a moment, then with a shrug I nodded back and told them I was. \n\n“What about out of country?” I hesitated then, genuinely surprised to ponder the idea. I’d never had to drive more than two hours for work before, and out of country seemed a bit drastic to me.\n\nBefore I could answer she made sure to clarify my enhanced pay rate, per diem payments and lodging which they would also handle. My jaw nearly hit the floor when she laid out the significant package they were offering.\n\n“What country? I asked.\n\n“Canada.” I told them I didn’t have a passport or anything, but they said that if I were to accept, they would help me get one in addition handling all the other paperwork. Being young and single, everything seemed to point for me to accept the offer, so I did. \n\nA year later and everything was prepared. I met the crew at the airport and after everyone was accounted for we went inside and got checked in for our flight. It was actually the first time I’d been out of the country, and first time going through customs. \n\nAfter the headache of going through security we finally arrived at our gate. Our plane was much smaller than I anticipated. Instead of a 747 or something we were in one of those small jets with 2 seats on one side and 1 on the other of the aisle. Once we were on the plane, I then also realized our group were the only passengers on board. \n\nA few hours later and we touched down on the runway. The sudden jolt woke from a long nap, but as I glanced out the window, I noticed something a bit strange. I was told we were working near Toronto, and assumed we’d be flying into the rather large Pearson airport. However, as I glanced out the window, I saw nothing but a lone hangar. There were no other planes around us, and I didn’t see any other buildings either. \n\n“Wow, Toronto airport is a lot smaller than I expected.” I spoke with a chuckle to my foreman seated beside me. He ran a hand through his salt and pepper beard and shook his head.\n\n“It’s not Toronto.” He met my stare as I gave him an inquisitive look.\n\n“We stop to refuel or something?” He shook his head again. \n\n“Not going to Toronto.” That really threw me for a loop, but I didn’t ask anymore. A moment later and the plane came to a stop. Some guys in high-vis jackets then brought over a mobile staircase and maneuvered it up to dock with the plane’s cabin door. A man in a grey suit then ascended the stairs as the rest of us gathered up our belongings. \n\nThe crew opened the door and the man stepped inside, smiling warmly as he glanced at all of us. He introduced himself as “John Wilson”; the official representative of our client. He welcomed us and asked if we could all grab our belongings and follow him out.\n\nWe did just that, exiting the plane and descending the staircase as the bitter cold gnawed against our skin. All around us was just flat, empty fields as far as the eye could see. There were no signs of cities, or really anything at all aside from the hangar and a vast expanse of rolling fields in every direction.  \n\nOur belongings were unloaded from the bottom of the plane as our team followed Mr. Wilson into the hangar. A large, grey bus arrived shortly after in order to take us to the jobsite. It was matt grey with no logos of any kind on it, and not even a license plate adorned it’s tailgate. Once inside, I felt confused as I could see into the bus from outside, but I couldn’t see out from within. It made me realize the windows were one-way glass, and that realization really set me on edge. \n\nOthers seemed to realize it too based on their nervous expressions and rhythmic fidgeting. Mr. Wilson stepped on last and seeming to sense our mounting nerves he apologized for the odd circumstances. He explained that the NDA’s we signed extended to the travel to the jobsite as well. He claimed that a great deal of money had already been committed to the project, and secrecy was a top priority for all involved. That was yet another red flag, but by then it was pretty much too late to turn back.\n\nWilson shut the divider door between the passengers and driver then took his seat at the front opposite the driver. Once that divider door was closed there was no ability to see outside the bus at all. The air brakes hissed as the driver put it into gear and we began to move.\n\nThere was a palpable nervousness lingering heavy in the air as we pulled away from the hangar. After about half an hour of travel in an uncomfortable silence we finally felt the bus come to a stop. I heard the driver roll down his window and the subsequent clicking of buttons. It then sounded like a garage door or gate opened outside. The bus then drove on a bit further before coming to a final stop. The divider door in the front then opened and Wilson stepped into the back. \n\n“This is it. It’s a little messy at the moment so please watch your step and follow closely.” One by one we followed him out of the bus, finding ourselves in some sort of large cargo bay. Several flickering lights illuminated the vicinity, but there were no windows on the walls. A single door stood at the top of a short stairwell and Wilson led us directly to it. \n\nAs we passed through the door, we found a wide sort of lobby area like that belonging to a hotel or corporate building. Dirty and cracked tiles lined the floor, and flickering lights beamed brightly overhead. Two other men sat towards the opposing end of the room. They rose as we approached and met to shake hands with our foreman and operations manager. \n\nWilson then guided the rest of us to help ourselves to the snacks and drinks laid out on the table which we happily obliged. A few minutes of meager conversation and snacking followed before Wilson asked us to all take a seat. \n\nHe then once again welcomed us all and thanked us for making the journey out. He said that he was available for any questions we may have and that he wanted us to feel as comfortable as possible for the duration of our stay. Once again, he apologized for the unorthodox procedures, but once again reiterated it was for the safety and privacy of everyone involved. Things got weird after that.\n\nWilson explained that during our stay they had a series of rules that must be adhered to under all circumstances, and breaking them would result in immediate termination from the project.  \n\n1. Remain in your living quarters after midnight and do not leave for any reason unless the emergency alarm is sounded.\n\n2. Do not attempt to leave the facility without approval from the administration. \n\n3. Do not enter subblock D3 for any reason. \n\n4. If any issues or concerns arise, please speak with management right away.\n\n5. Do not speak to anyone outside of this room about this contract. \n\nObviously by writing this I’m already breaking rule 5, but I’ll explain why later. They had us all sign a few documents before showing us to the rooms we’d be staying in for the duration of our work. We got settled in our personal quarters soon after, and spent the rest of the night hanging out with the crew and establishing a game plan. \n\nMy partner Jake and I were set to begin the process of refurbishing the east wing of subblock A3 as the rest of the team dispersed throughout the rest of A. It was to be floor by floor effort with different teams working on different sections at the same time. The contract mostly consisted of refurbishing the facility with some specialized furnishing work as well. Overall, it sounded relatively straightforward, and with the 12 of us working it was allotted to take about 3 months. \n\nI asked our foreman what this place was, but he admitted he didn’t know. Apparently, all he was told was that it was an old complex which our suitor wanted to reopen. Very vague obviously, but since everything up to that point had been I didn’t really question it. \n\nThe next day came and Jake and I along with the rest of the team headed out to begin our work. Once officially inside the ground floor we found an old, seemingly ransacked building laying long-since forgotten. Piles of dust and debris were scattered all around, and various pieces of furniture lay where they had been left who knows how long ago. Many of the ceiling tiles were broken and missing, and bundles of wires dangled down in certain spots. The same tiled floor in the lobby was used all throughout the main level, but was considerably more degraded. \n\nJake and I soon found subblock A3 and began our initial inspection. It was much the same as the main lobby with about a dozen small rooms in various states of decay. Most of them didn’t look too bad, but there was a significant amount of rust on the doors and exposed framing. The block almost looked like something you’d see in a doctor’s office with the multiple rooms being for patients but again this was never confirmed. \n\nAll the rooms were designated for removal and we spent several days demolishing the framing and reinforcing the existing support columns. We replaced sections of the floor as well as some of the sheetrock which had suffered apparent water damage. It was a relatively straightforward task, and by the end of the first week we’d nearly finished the entire section. \n\nJake was a big smoker, and since there was no designated smoking area he had to ask to be escorted outside by the guards whenever he wanted a cigarette. Apparently either Wilson or one of his colleagues would then take him outside to a walled off section of the property. The small spot had walls on every side, but only a mesh roof which covered the ceiling. Jake returned one night after a smoke with a perturbed expression on his face.\n\n“It’s still light outside.” I gave him a confused look, and checked the time realizing it was about half an hour to midnight. It was mid-August, and I would’ve thought the sun would’ve set hours ago. \n\n“You sure it wasn’t just like a floodlight?” Jake shook his head immediately and sat on the bunk beside me.\n\n“No too bright for that.”\n\n“How is that possible?” He shrugged.\n\n“We must be a lot further north than I thought.” It was a weird thing to ponder, but it did make sense. The flight from our departure flight from Chicago to Toronto should’ve been just under 2 hours, but we had been on the plane for much longer than that. \n\n“You think they lied to us?” I asked. Jake shrugged and ran a hand through his beard. \n\n“I don’t know, but this whole thing is fishy, don’t you think?” It was true; there was something unsettling about the whole thing, but I couldn’t place it. I told myself it was just my nerves of being so far from home. After all, most of the concerns we had could just be explained away by safety and privacy precautions, but since almost everything shady that exists is typically covered by those excuses that didn’t bring much comfort. Either way, we didn’t have anything directly worrying to point to quite yet.  \n\nOnce we finished up A3, we moved down to C3 to begin the process again as another team tackled B3. That section- and the entire floor really was in a much more squalid state than the floor above. There was bent framing, mangled walls and extensive damage to the electrical systems. \n\nOur lead electrician; Donny was already well at work there, working on the arduous process of removing the damaged wiring and cables. Once we joined him, we helped him continue his work as it was near impossible for us to commence our tasks until the new systems were laid. \n\nDonny was a wise-cracking, sailor-mouthed dude in his mid-40’s. Always making jokes and always laughing in his gruff, raspy voice. He seemed a lot more demure then than he typically was. I just chalked it up to him being tired and didn’t really much about it, until one day I found him crouched over a vent. He saw me enter, and immediately put his finger to his lips as he waved me over. I joined him there by the vent and knelt to his level.\n\n“Listen.” I did as he said, and heard the slight sounds of air surging through the ducts below. We lingered in silence for several seconds before something pierced the serenity. It sounded like a frail, pain-stricken groan, but it wasn’t decisive to me. I couldn’t determine whether my mind had simply imagined it or not, but regardless, I felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand erect as goosebumps lined my arms. \n\n“You heard that, right?” Donny asked. \n\n“Yeah… is someone down there?” \n\n“Shouldn’t be, as far as I know no one is supposed to be below C floor right now.” The two of us listened again for a few seconds, but heard nothing else. \n\n“Must be one of Wilson’s guys.” I reasoned.\n\n“Yeah, I guess so.” There was a palpable unease the rest of that day. We heard those sounds several more times at varying volumes, but never anything distinct. Although slightly unnerving, I told myself it was probably just Wilson’s guys or some weird effect of the building itself settling. \n\nOne of Wilson’s guys joined us down there a few days later. He introduced himself as Mike, and said he’d been working with Wilson for close to a decade now doing security work. An AR15 was strapped on his back at all times, and a pistol clung onto his hip. I thought it was kind of weird we even had security there; especially armed to the teeth like that, but reasoned it was just to ensure no one stole anything or did anything they weren’t supposed to.\n\nDonny had finished the wiring by then, and Jake and I had installed new framing pieces and had begun setting new sheetrock to cover them. As we worked, a sudden noise reverberated through the vents, sounding like a drawn-out sort of moan. All four of us heard it and turned to the vent right as it happened. \n\n“You guys keepin’ hookers in the basement?” Donny asked with a laugh, but Mike looking genuinely unsettled. His face had gone pale and eyes stapled wide open. He then forced himself to chuckle, but it wasn’t sincere. \n\n“If they are, they ain’t said nothin’ to me about it.” Mike glanced around, shaking his head slowly. \n\n“This building is old; real old, probably just some random settling noise I guess.” \n\n“What is this place anyways?” Jake asked. Mike seemed to ponder it a moment, then shrugged.  \n\n“I’m not sure. We were just told it was an old mining facility but… this doesn’t seem much like a mine to me.” That much we all seemed to agree on. I then suddenly remembered where we were in the building. Subblock C3, directly above the apparently forbidden D3.\n\n“Why is no one allowed in D3?” I asked, and Mike shrugged.\n\n“Not sure honestly. They just told us there are sensitive materials there that require specialized handlers.” I saw his eyes glance over to the vent and stare at it a moment. I wanted to ask whether he’d heard the noises too, but he spoke before I could.\n\n“Either way, best not to talk about it to management. They don’t like people asking too many questions. Wilson’s a good guy, but you don’t wanna try his patience.” Mike then sauntered off without another word. The rest of us continued our work in an uncomfortable silence for the rest of our shift as the odd vent sounds periodically echoed it’s morose serenade. \n\nThat same night after lights out I suddenly woke up in my bunk. I reached for my phone and found it was just past 1AM. I turned over and shut my eyes again, when suddenly I heard something out in the hallway. It sounded like footsteps.  \n\nWhoever it was seemed to walk several paces before pausing a moment, then continuing a few more. I listened for about a minute before it seemed to fade away entirely. Up to that point I had never heard anyone pacing the halls after midnight, but I just assumed it was one of the guards or something.\n\nI didn’t sleep much the rest of that night. Every time I managed to dose off, I seemed to suddenly wake up in a stark panic with a really weird state of mind. The only way I know how to describe it is being suddenly freaked out by the fact that I existed. It probably sounds really weird, but I honestly can’t think of a better way of explaining it. \n\nThe alarm clock finally went off an eternity later and I rose to get myself prepared for the day. After grabbing my toiletries, I exited the room and made my way down towards the showers. Once I was out in the hall, I noticed several of my coworkers crowded around a spot further down. As I sauntered over to them, I found what held their attention. On the ground was a bunch of bloody rags and shredded pieces of cloth. \n\n“Everybody okay? Whose was this?” He did a headcount once everyone was awake and confirmed everyone was accounted for and in perfect condition. What was weird was that no one seemed to confess to owning the bloody rags. Perhaps it was out of embarrassment or fear of being disciplined or something, but I found it strange that no one would admit it.  \n\nWhen Wilson got there, he inspected the scene as well, but he also confirmed that none of his men had been injured either. We all began working somewhat unnerved that morning. I’d almost finally convinced myself that nothing weird was going on too, but the bloody rags made it clear that something was up. \n\nJake and I just did our best to get back to work. We picked up where we had left off, and continued on the C3 renovations. Things were mostly quiet and uneventful for a day or two and we were able to make some good progress. After finishing up C3 we moved on to the rest of C level and aided the rest of the team to finish the entire level.  \n\nThe longer we worked the longer I started to ruminate on how odd the entire situation was; even from the ground level. This anonymous company hired us- contractors from a different country to fly thousands of miles north and work what was a relatively routine project. Why wouldn’t they just hire a local company to do it? Maybe there wasn’t another suitor giving them a fair price, but I can’t imagine flying us all in was the cheapest available option. \n\nJake seemed bothered by the whole thing too. He seemed to grow quieter and more irritable the longer it went on. On a couple of occasions, I saw him perk up suddenly out of nowhere, as if he was startled by something. I could see the fear brimming in his pallid expression.\n\n“You hear that?” He asked me one day as the two of us worked. I turned to see him staring at the vent with a pronounced grimaced fused onto his face. \n\n“Hear what?” I asked, pausing to listen. After several seconds of silence, I’d heard absolutely nothing out of the ordinary, so I just shrugged at him.\n\n“Nothing, I guess.” He didn’t elaborate beyond that, and I don’t think we spoke a word to each other for the remainder of that shift. \n\nD floor was supposedly the basement of the building even though technically it had 3 subterranean levels. Although D3 in particular was off limits, the rest of D floor was set to be renovated. I went down there that day with Wilson, my foreman and a few other coworkers. \n\nAs we descended to the bottom of the stairwell, we found a reinforced stainless-steel door awaiting us. It looked more like a bank vault than it did the entry to a new floor. Wilson pulled out a keyring and began fumbling through them until he found one that fit into the door. The mechanism clicked as he turned it, and Wilson looked back at us.\n\n“Give me a hand with this, would ya?” Myself and another guy stepped up and pushed on the door with him. Even with the 3 of us it was still a tough task to just push the door open. Once we finally had it open, I noticed the damn thing was a half-foot thick slab of steel on reinforced hinges. Needless to say, it seemed a bit overkill for a basement, unless there was something in there worth trying to keep inside.\n\nThe entire floor in general was a mess as well, looking as though a tornado had ravaged through it. The walls were torn and collapsed with all sorts of structural damage all around the vicinity. Luckily it seemed like the framing was mostly intact, but the damage was much more severe than the other floors. \n\nI sighed internally, as I was hoping that final floor would cut us some slack and be quick, but it didn’t seem like that’d be the case after all. It was long after that when we spied the forbidden section of D3 standing derelict and sealed. A large metal door similar to the one we’d entered in through stood there seeming to glow in the shadows with the glimmer of it’s polished hull. \n\nWe began to assess the process as a team and gathered to spitball ideas. As our foreman talked, I spied another of my coworkers who I’ll call ‘Tony’ just staring at the stainless-steel door. He seemed almost transfixed with it, his eyes wide open ands clenched into tight fists at his side. \n\nWe definitely had our work cut out for us, and after spending the rest of the afternoon determining a plan we retired for the evening. It had been almost 2 months by this point, and I think I speak for everyone when I say we were all getting rather antsy. A bad case of cabin fever had set in awhile ago, but since we weren’t allowed outside there wasn’t much to do in terms of relaxation. They had a basic galley set up with TV, billiards and other games, but you can only get by for so long on those. \n\nTony seemed unusually distant that night. I tried talking to him a bit, but he just basically gave me one-word responses to everything I said. I figured he was just tired and wanted to be left alone so I obliged. As the night winded down we all filed back into our bunks. I fell asleep quick that night, but I wish I hadn’t. \n\nA blaring alarm startled me from the oblivion of sleep. I sprung up in my bed, hearing the deafening wails of the siren screech from all around. As my eyes adjusted to the darkness, I saw Jake stumbling from his bunk.\n\n“What the hell is going on?” I asked.\n\n“Get dressed, quick!” I could see the fear manifest in his face even under the veil of darkness. I got myself dressed as the frantic sounds of the others emerged around us. \n\nOnce we got into the hallway, we found the security guards ushering everybody towards the main entrance. Jake and I hustled past them, but as we did, I heard two of them talking. \n\n“They went down to the chute.”\n\n“Why the hell would they do that?”\n\n“Keep moving, everybody out.”\n\nIn the flurry of voices and commands, I didn’t really consider the implications of what I’d heard. Jake and I got topside and found most of the rest of our crew waiting there. The remainder filed in seconds later as our foreman performed a headcount. He found all were accounted for minus two of our team members; a guy I’ll call ‘George’ and Tony.\n\nWe watched as the security team charged down towards the main building with weapons drawn. The rest of us could only wait in the lobby area as they made their way down deeper into the confines of the building.\n\n“What the hell is going on?” One of my coworkers asked our foreman, but he just shrugged. The alarm finally ceased it’s wretched wails then, and things grew unnervingly silent. We all waited there for a good ten minutes before the sudden sounds of gunshots blared through the night. \n\nThe two guards at the door clutched their rifles tightly, staring down the corridor into the building. The skirmish continued for close to a minute before things fell silent once again. I checked my phone and realized it was just before midnight. \n\nFinally, the sights of the other guards emerged down the hallway.\n\n“Who is that?” One of the guards called out.\n\n“It’s Simmons, just us don’t worry.” The two guards before us still seemed apprehensive, but seemed to relax as the others emerged in the corridor. As they made their way towards us, I saw that many of them were hobbling as if they were injured. Two guards held the shoulder of a third between them as he limped towards the lobby. Also in their group was George, but ominously absent was Tony.\n\nThe guards got stationed around the room as the injured were tended to. One of their guys had a broken ankle, but aside from that it seemed they were mostly okay with a few scrapes and bruises. \n\n“George, what the hell happened? Where’s Tony?” It was then I noticed the forlorn and expressionless stare on George’s face. He looked completely out of it, just sitting alone and gazing into nothing. \n\n“George!” The foreman called again, seeming to snap him out of his state.\n\n“I… I don’t know.”\n\n“He’s gone.” Wilson declared. Our foreman glared at him.\n\n“What the hell do you mean ‘he’s gone’? Where did he go?”\n\n“He went into D3.” Wilson looked more defeated than anything else, as if the act itself was already a foregone conclusion. \n\n“We need to go get him.” Our foreman argued, but Wilson just solemnly shook his head.\n\n“You go down there, and you’ll never come back out.” Our foreman continued to argue with him, yelling about how they’d tricked us into this contract and he’d sue them for their wrongdoings. Wilson seemed unphased by any and all threats hurled his way. The foreman continued his façade, but it was clear he- and the rest of us were terrified of going down there; as were the rest of the security guards. \n\nEventually things just sort of quieted down and most of the guys fell asleep there in the lobby. I felt my eyelids growing heavy too, and before long I succumbed to slumber as well. Once again, I was suddenly torn out of my sleep by a wretched cacophony, but this was much different from the last one. It was the sounds of screaming. \n\nI awoke to see utter madness consuming the room. Some of the guys were on the ground flailing and shrieking at the top of their lungs, while others were sauntering around covering their eyes.\n\nA sudden feeling struck me as I watched. The walls and room seemed to distort, and an agonizing pain struck directly in the center of my forehead. It was the worst pain I’ve ever felt in my life. \n\nIn absolute agony I collapsed to the floor praying and begging the pain to stop. Things appeared around me, but I struggle to describe and even remember them. Horrible vestiges of things no person should ever have to see. Beasts that appeared straight from the pits of hell conspired and cackled in maddening tones as reality itself seemed to spiral into the depths of replete madness. \n\nI don’t know how long it went on but it felt like an eternity. Mercifully, Wilson somehow managed to garner the strength to turn on the lights in the room. The visions seemed to fade and the pain finally subsided. The sounds of screaming died down to be replaced with the hushed sounds of weeping. \n\nAs I sat up, I spied Wilson standing at the door that led into the building. He’d shut it and was eyeing the crowd with a fervent disposition. Everyone was distraught, but huddled in silence awaiting an order. \n\nAs I glanced around, I saw that several of the guys had cuts on their faces and arms, most of which looked self-inflicted. They brought the medical kits out and began bandaging everyone up. No one seemed to want to discuss what the hell had just happened, and as such the uncomfortable silence lingered all the way until the sun rose.\n\nThat was the end of the contract. When the sun finally rose, we all packed our belongings and got the hell out of there. The security team went down to investigate where Tony had been but found no trace of him anywhere. They said they’d be in contact with the police to investigate, but I had my doubts about that.\n\nIt may sound callous, but by that point I was so exhausted and shaken from the experience that all I could think about was getting as far away from that place as possible. In under an hour, we were loaded back into the van and driven back out to the airstrip. The plane arrived later that evening, and I’ve never been so relieved in all my life.  \n\nWe were compensated for our work and even given a percentage of the total contract plus an additional bonus. It seemed like hush money to me, but I was more than happy to take it considering the circumstances. Despite the huge payday, our company somehow managed to fall on tough financial times only a few months later. It shut down soon after and I was forced to move on.\n\nI pretty much fell out of contact with all my coworkers from that company, but one day a few years later I randomly ran into George at a grocery store. He was thin and emaciated, with discolored cheeks and a frail demeanor. Even the way he spoke seemed weaker than before. He was significantly older than me, but I couldn’t help but notice the stark contrast from the last time I’d known him. \n\nWe chatted briefly, and eventually decided to go grab dinner together. The memories came flooding back to me as the two of us spoke, and I decided I had to ask him about what happened that night. \n\n“It still doesn’t make sense to me.” George began, swishing his drink in his mug nervously. \n\nHe then proceeded to explain how he had seen Tony leaving his room that night, and decided to follow him. Tony went directly down to the bottom floor as George pursued at a distance. Once he entered D floor, he found the door to D3 already open, and he knew Tony had gone inside.\n\nHe said that everything in him was screaming not to go in there, but he couldn’t abandon Tony. He stepped through the door, and came face to face with another stairwell; a separate one which seemed to lead even lower into the building. George didn’t know how it was possible, but as he glanced over the railing, he saw innumerable stairways down below. \n\nHe said he could only glance for a couple seconds before the fear overwhelmed him so much that he had to backtrack. He felt his chest growing tight, and throat clamming up as a potent sense of impending doom consumed him. Next thing he knew, the security team emerged as well and ordered him back. They asked where Tony had gone, and he just pointed towards the stairwell. He doesn’t remember anything that happened after that.\n\nI wish he was able to provide more, but I didn’t want to push him as the event was clearly traumatic for him. I’d be lying if I said I myself had escaped unscathed. I’ve suffered nightmares and night terrors ever since, not every night but common enough to make things very difficult. I’ve tried seeing therapists and psychologists and been prescribed countless medications, but none have really helped much.\n\nGeorge passed away a few months after our reunion, and the news struck me hard. I could never forget that haunted look of despair in his face when I’d last seen him. It was like all semblance of hope had drained from him forever.\n\nShortly after that news, I found something even worse. I looked up multiple of my former coworkers. Our foreman, Jake, Donny and three others who I regularly corresponded with back in the day. All of them are now dead. I know at least a few committed suicide; but I’m not sure about George or all the others. As far as I can tell, everyone who was there for that project is now dead; except for me.\n\nThat doesn’t bode well for me obviously, but I don’t know what I’m supposed to do about it. None of this makes any sense, and I don’t even know where I can go for answers. Maybe I’m reading way too much into it, and all of this is just a morbid but random coincidence, but it doesn’t feel that way.\n\nThat place felt evil, and unwelcoming in a way that nothing else ever has. Something was very wrong, and whatever that something is it is still out there. I don’t know where I go from here, but I’m going to keep searching. I hope I’m just over-reacting, but I guess only time will tell.  \n\nThis is my last attempt to get some answers. I feel like I’m cursed by the experience, and I figure if my days are numbered then I might as well tell the world why. If anyone has any theories, I’d welcome them no matter how outlandish they may seem. I guess if nothing else, this experience has gone to teach me that if something seems too good to be true, then it is.",

        "text": "You know how sometimes people say that they feel like they’re being watched, even if they can't prove it? I always assumed that feeling was just something people felt when they were paranoid. That is, until I met him. \n\nI spent last winter working at a place called the frozen village. It was a sad attempt at a theme park smaller than a traveling carnival, but people loved it because the structures were mostly made of ice. There were lots of different stations that needed staff present, so we rotated jobs on a daily basis. I was working in the ticket booth outside the entrance when he showed up. \n\nThe day was going by slowly, with only around one group trickling in every half hour. I usually spent the dead moments on my phone browsing Instagram or r/aww, and this particular day was no exception. I was congratulating my friend on getting official with her boyfriend when something started to feel…off. It started as a tingle in the pit of my stomach, the center of my body’s brain. Dread suddenly filled my mind, so quick and complete it was as though a lightning bolt of malice had struck me on the head. A hot flash of adrenaline spread through my body. I got goosebumps, and the little hairs on the back of my neck stood up. *What the hell is going on?* I thought to myself. I worried that my lunch had given me food poisoning. Nausea sent saliva flowing into my mouth. I frantically searched around the ticket booth for an empty trash can to throw up in when my eyes grazed something that stopped me in place and sent lunch tumbling back into my stomach. Far off from the ticket booth in the parking lot was a man staring at me. He stood alone, far from the few cars in the lot, and wasn’t talking on the phone or taking a picture. I couldn’t really make out his facial features, but he was definitely older, probably in his fifties, with gray hair on the sides and nothing on top. A beer belly stuck out from his tan winter jacket; his hands were in the pockets of acid washed jeans. My heart started to pound in my chest like Vikings knocking down a castle gate. I didn’t know what to do. \n\nAfter a moment of fear-stricken paralysis, I decided to wave. I waited, but he didn’t react. *Should I call the police?* I wondered, but eventually decided that that would be stupid. *What would I tell them?* I didn’t even know if he was looking at me or just the castle. I took a deep breath. *I’m probably just overreacting*, I told myself. I sat back down and picked up my phone.\n\n*Wait, what was that?* I could have sworn that, right as I looked away, he waved back at me. I looked back up towards the lot. He stood in the same position, motionless, but his right hand was now out of his pocket. I shivered. \n\n“Hi!” I jumped back and yelped. Outside the ticket booth were two old ladies with confused looks on their faces. I was so distracted I hadn’t notice them at all.\n\n“Sorry!” I stammered. “I didn’t see you guys! What can I do for you?” I exchanged the ladies’ money for two tickets and ushered them in. When they left, the man in the parking lot was gone.\n\nAfter the village closed, my boss came up to congratulate me. Someone had mentioned to her what a good greeter I was. They said I had an “inviting spirit”. Since no one had ever received a compliment at the ticket booth, she decided that I would work there permanently. The news caught me by surprise in a good way. I had totally forgotten about the man in the parking lot by then and was excited about being able to stay in the booth, which was the easiest job in the village. I also felt a little giddy because I thought I knew of who had given the compliment. A young single father had come in with his son around 11, when I still had the energy to be extra chipper, and we had casually flirted for a little while after the ticket scanner crashed. I could have just gotten a backup, but he was cute and I liked the attention so I waited for the machine to come back online instead. His wife died in a car accident two years ago, and he made sure to mention that he was just getting “back in the game”. The more I thought about it, the surer I became that he was the one who complimented me. \n\nMy boss left and I got to work stowing the equipment away. It was dark by then, and I thought I was alone. I finished closing up and went to open the door when I spotted him standing at the edge of the village wall, just behind a corner. My heart stopped. There was something off about his appearance. Maybe it was just shadows playing tricks on me, but it looked like he was eight feet tall. His protruding belly like a beachball rose and fell as he breathed, but the rest of his frame stood slender and motionless. I couldn’t see his face behind the shadow of nightfall, but I knew it was him. His body was facing the window of the ticket booth, which was now the only thing separating us. Suddenly I couldn’t breathe. There was no way for me to get to my car without walking right past him, and no one was around to protect me. I was trapped. All the oxygen left the room. \"What do I do?\" I whimpered to no one. My knees wobbled and tears began to swell up in my eyes when I heard voices coming from the village exit. I turned to see who it was, and no face could have put me more at ease. It was the hunky single dad I had flirted with earlier. When he walked by the ticket booth I sprang out.\n\n“Woah!” he shouted, half startled and half teasing. “Were you waiting for me in there?” He smiled but that smile faded when he saw the tears in my eyes and look of fear on my face. “Hey, are you alright? You look like you’ve seen a ghost!” I opened my mouth, but the lump in my throat blocked the words from coming out. All I could do was point to the dark corner where the man stood waiting. “What, is that guy bothering you?” He asked, getting agitated. I nodded feebly. “Don’t worry, I’ll take care of him.” He started off towards the dark corner, but I grabbed him.\n\n“Wait!” I managed to say, “Don’t. It’s okay, I just need someone to walk me to my car.” He nodded. I linked my arm with his and he marched us off towards the parking lot, but by then the man had already left. When we got to my car, I thanked my new friend, whose name was Damion, for escorting me. Before I left, he asked me something.\n\n“So, this guy who’s been staring at you. What does he look like?” \n\n“Well, he’s balding on the top with long gray hair on the sides, and he has a big belly but other than that he looks pretty thin. Oh, and he’s tall. Like, super tall…” I trailed off as his expression suddenly changed from concerned to really angry. “Do you…know him?” I asked. He looked away, like he wasn’t comfortable discussing it.\n\n“Just make sure to stay away from him,” he said ominously, “and don’t believe anything he tells you.” This last part struck me as a little strange. I was afraid he was going to cut up my intestines, not lie to me, yet somehow that made his remonstrance all the more frightening. What could that man tell me that would warrant such a warning? Damion gave me a hug and said good night.\n\n“Wait! Should I call the police?” I squeaked. He shook his head.\n\n“Trust me, that won’t make things any better. If anything, it’ll make it worse,” he answered. I searched his eyes to discern what he meant but couldn’t read him. “It’ll be okay,” he said, then gave a calming smile and turned to leave. I don’t know why, but I trusted him and that everything would be alright. I watched him walk with child in arm and wondered if I would ever see him again. For some reason it seemed like the people who I wanted the most never wanted to stay, and the people who loved me the least never wanted to go away.\n\nI spent the long, lonely trip back from the frozen village deep in thought. It was one of those times where you forget you are even driving until you pull up to your house. I thought about the tall man who Damion inexplicably knew, and whether either of them would ever revisit the frozen village. I thought about how angry Damion looked when I described my stalker, almost like he was personally offended. When I got home that night I went straight to bed. I didn’t want to eat or even take a shower. Exhausted, I climbed under the covers and sent a quiet prayer to whoever is out there in the cosmos, asking for protection from my watcher. It didn’t take ten seconds for me to drift off into a deep sleep. The last thing I remember is a floorboard creaking in the kitchen, which I assumed was just the cat on his nightly prowl. I was so tired I didn’t realize that Mr. Whiskers was already in bed with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next day started off just like any other day in the frozen village. The ticket booth was a bit more active than it had been the day before, but I didn’t mind. The work kept me from thinking too much about him, the watching man. \n\nEverything was going smoothly, and I had almost totally forgotten about him, when that same feeling of fear hit my stomach. Sweat seeped from my forehead and my mind went on high alert. I looked out towards the parking lot but couldn’t see him anywhere. My eyes swept to the same corner where he had waited for me, but this time there was no pot belly protruding from behind it. I told myself that it was just a reaction from the night before and tried to focus on my work. That was when a familiar face showed up.\n\n“How’s the prettiest toll booth operator ever doing?”\n\n“Oh my gosh, you scared me!” I reached under the window and hit Damion in the arm. He was smiling.\n\n“Listen, after everything that happened last night, I forgot about something important,” he started. My eyes opened wide and I braced myself for some kind of frightening detail about my stalker. “Can I get your number?” He asked with a smile, and I giggled.\n\n“Jesus, I thought you were going to say something about that creepy guy!” And I giggled again in spite of myself. Damion was cute and way more charming and mature than any guy I had ever dated before. It felt nice to be noticed by a real man. “Of course, you can have my number. To be honest, I was a little disappointed when you didn’t ask for it last night. I thought I would never see you again!” This time he giggled.\n\n“Sorry about that, I guess I was just kinda nervous. I’m not used to flirting with pretty girls.” He flashed a dashing smile and I swear his eye literally twinkled. I wrote down my number on a scrap of paper and handed it to him under the window. He took it, then paused. “I was going to call you later but maybe I’ll just ask you now…Um,” he chuckled nervously. “would you, um, would you like to maybe, uh,” he stuttered.\n\n“Go out sometime?” I finished for him. He blushed and looked down at his shoes.\n\n“Yeah, haha. I thought we could go to a movie or something, somewhere that isn’t made of ice.” I laughed. “Can I pick you up Friday at eight?”\n\n“Sure, I’ll text you my address and what movie I want to see later.” He laughed and I couldn’t help but giggle a little. \n\n“Sounds good, I like a girl who says what she wants.” \n\n“Then we’re gonna get along great.” We smiled and stared into each other’s eyes for a second longer than normal. “So, is this why you told my boss I was a great ticket scanner?” Damion looked confused.\n\n“No, I don’t even know who your boss is. Did someone say that?” he asked. Now I was the one who looked confused.\n\n“Yeah, someone told her I was doing a good job and now it’s my permanent position.” When I said this, Damion’s golden smile suddenly broke into a frown. His face concerned me. “What’s wrong?” I asked him.\n\n“Nothing. That’s nice someone complimented you. I guess maybe I have some competition.” He smiled again, I could something was troubling him.\n\n“So, do you want a ticket?” I asked. \n\n“No, of course not. One day was more than enough ice for me.” We said goodbye to each other, and he left. Once he was out of my field of vision, that dreadful feeling returned. *What is going on?* I was beginning to worry that I had some kind of mental illness. I searched for the man again, and even stepped outside the booth to get a better look around. I couldn’t see anyone outside, but then I peered through the entrance to the frozen village and that's when I saw him. He was just standing there, only a little past the entrance, staring in the direction of the booth. I gasped. \n\n*How the hell did he even get in there?* I didn’t remember letting him in or scanning his ticket. He looked exactly the same as before, except his height was back to normal and he was wearing sunglasses. Suddenly, anger grew inside me. I was tired of letting this guy scare me senseless. I marched over to the security guard and explained the situation. He said he would kick out whoever was making me feel uncomfortable and asked me to show him which guy it was. I gathered up all the courage left in me and marched over to the creep.\n\n“This is the man who’s been staring at me,” I said. The security guard looked at him, then at me, then at him again, then back at me. He cracked a smile, and then began to laugh. “What’s so funny?” I demanded.\n\n“Ma’am,” he said, “this man is *blind.*” My jaw dropped.\n\n“What? No he’s not! That's not possible!” I asserted. \"He's been following me!\"\n\n“Is someone there?” the creep asked in an innocent voice. I walked up to him and waved my hand in front of his face. I pretended to punch him, stopping just centimeters in front of his nose. He didn’t even flinch.\n\n“Ma’am, I’m sorry but I think this was just a misunderstanding” the security guard said to me.\n\n“But, but-” I stammered, trying to think of something that proved he wasn’t blind. But I couldn’t. I thought over everything that had happened and realized that it could all be explained by him not being able to see.\n\n“What’s going on here?” the man asked. The security guard turned to him.\n\n“This young woman says you’ve been staring at her and following her. Obviously, it wasn’t anything you were doing on purpose. That’s all.”\n\n“Of course I haven’t been stalking anyone! I don’t even know who you are! I can't see!” He yelled at me. \n\n“How did you get in here without passing by the ticket booth then?” I asked.\n\n“Well, my wife got us checked in, then she guided me inside.” He explained. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. Maybe everything had just been a misunderstanding. The security guard walked back to his post, leaving me alone with the alleged blind min.\n\n“I’m sorry,” I began. “I guess I just got scared when I saw you the other day and I –“ He turned towards me, and even behind his sunglasses I felt his eyes looking into mine.\n\n“I would be careful if I were you,” he said in a low, menacing tone, and then turned and walked away. I stood there, frozen in the frozen village. I didn’t know what to make of the situation. Was that a threat? Was he really not blind, then? A shiver ran down my spine, and the same feeling of dread sprouted inside me. I ran back to the ticket booth and found a bucket. I felt like vomiting again, and this time I actually did.\n\nI didn’t see the man again for the rest of the workday, which had actually gone rather smoothly. After throwing up, the feeling subsided and I spent the rest of the shift just scanning tickets and texting with Damion. It wasn’t until my drive back home that things took a turn for the worse.\n\nI pulled out of the frozen village parking lot onto the desolate roadway back home, and it wasn’t long before I felt my stomach churn and the hairs on my neck stand up. \n\n“What the fuck!” I yelled at my body. “What is wrong with me?” Then, in my rear-view mirror, I saw a car pull out from the side of the road. My muscles tensed. Somehow, I knew it was the same man. The road was dark and empty, with no other cars around. I slowed down to get a better peak at the driver. The car grew closer to mine, and in the mirror I saw the unmistakable gray hair and tan winter jacket. My heart began pounding. I slammed the accelerator to the floor and took off. Behind me, the other vehicle sped up and stayed close behind. I frantically grabbed at my pocket. Going 90 mph down the windy and icy road, I used one hand to unlock my phone and call Damion. He picked up on the first ring.\n\n“Hey, I was hoping you would call.” He said in the same flirty tone as before.\n\n“He’s following me!” I wailed into the receiver. “I’m in my car and he’s in the car behind me. I’m trying to lose him, but I can’t.” Damion was silent for a moment.\n\n“Do everything you can to stay ahead of him and go straight home. Don’t worry about trying to lose him, you won’t be able to. He won’t try to run you off the road or anything, he just wants to follow you. It’ll be okay, but whatever you do, don’t call the police! Alright?”\n\n“Alright, alright. I’m scared.” I started to cry.\n\n“Don’t worry, you're gonna be okay. I’ll help you take care of it, just try to get as much distance between you and him as possible. I’m heading over to your place now.” He hung up. I was so nervous I started to see dark spots in my vision, much too nervous to wonder how Damion would know where I lived. I couldn’t believe something like this was actually happening to me. As we got closer to the city, I tried to lose him in traffic, but every time I weaved between cars, he did the same. Eventually I was able to put a little bit of distance between us, such that I couldn’t see him anymore, but that didn’t do much to calm my nerves. When I got home, I didn’t even bother to turn the car off before running inside and locking the door. Damion was already inside, playing with Mr. Sprinkles.\n\n“How did you get in here?” I asked airily. I was borderline hyperventilating and trying not to pass out.\n\n“The door was unlocked,” he said. “Is he right behind you?”\n\n“I don’t know, I couldn't see him when I got here but I think he was still behind me.”\n\n“Good job putting some space between you and him.” Damion nodded and embraced me, enveloping me with his arms. “Everything is going to be okay, you’re safe now.” Then came a knock on the door.\n\n“Hello?” the visitor yelled from the outside. I recognized him from his voice, but his tone was much more aggravated. “You have to let me in!”\n\n“Just ignore him,” Damion cautioned. I held him tight.\n\n“You have to listen to me; your life is in danger!” the man shouted. *What does that mean?* “You can’t trust Damion!” He yelled. This last sentence made me freeze. How did he know about Damion? Why did they know each other?\n\n“Go away!” I shouted. Damion squeezed me tighter.\n\n“Don’t listen to him,” Damion said, his voice just a little shaky.\n\n“Please, you have to trust me. Damion was married to my daughter and he killed her!  He killed his first wife too, and now I’m afraid he’s after you!” He yelled, and for the first time it sounded more like he was pleading with me than threatening. *First wife?* I thought. Damion had never mentioned anything about being married *twice*. I tried to pull away from the hug to look at Damion’s face, but he held me tight. Damion shouted back at him.\n\n“You’re crazy, Jack! You stay away from here, got it?” The man, who apparently was named Jack, fell silent for a moment. Then, in a lower voice, he asked,\n\n“Is he in the house right now?” Neither of us answered. Then there was a loud thud at the door. And then another, and another. He was trying to bust down the door. I tried to look at the door, but Damion had me pulled in even tighter now.\n\n“What’s he talking about, Damion?” I asked. He ignored my question.\n\n“Shit, he’s breaking down the door. Well, I guess I better make this quick.” Damion said. I was about to ask “make what quick” when he answered the question for me. With the swiftness and strength of someone who had done it before, he wrapped his hands around my neck and began choking me. I sputtered for air, but nothing came in. A cough built up in my throat, but nothing came out. My eyes began to water as I looked at Damion. His face had completely changed, and he was now almost unrecognizable. His eyes were filled with rage, and his mouth twisted up in an animal snarl. My body writhed, screaming at me to breathe. “Fucking Jack, I had everything planned out so *perfectly*!” He pushed hard with that last word, shoving me down to the floor. Big black spots filled my vision that grew and eventually collided until everything was black. My ears were ringing, and the only thing I could hear was the now distant thud of Jack ramming the door. *Shit*, I thought. I was going to die.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDamion met the same fate as his wives that night. Jack had eventually broken down the door and did to Damion what he had done to his daughter. I don't like thinking about the specifics, but let's just say that it's a good thing I kept a variety of kitchen knives around the house. When the police showed up, they said that Jack did the right thing and that he wouldn’t face any criminal charges. I was unconscious for all of it, and only came to when a paramedic splashed cold water on my face. When I saw Jack in my house I screamed, but the police explained that he had saved my life. Gradually, I began to remember the events of that night, and realized that Damion had been the real monster. Jack and I are friends now. He lives alone and has few friends to visit him, so once a week we meet at the park to play chess and snack on ham sandwiches. I bring the game, he provides the snacks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe whole time I thought Jack was stalking me, he had actually been stalking Damion. I guess there was never enough proof that Damion had murdered his wives to get him arrested, but Jack knew it and knew he would strike again. He said he owed it to his daughter to make sure no one else suffered what she did. I’m glad that he was my watcher. In an ironic way, he was the answer to my prayer that night. Sometimes blessings come from unexpected places. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI haven’t felt that dreadful, sinking feeling of being watched since the incident with Damion. I hope I never do. If YOU ever get that feeling, that shiver down your neck, that pit in your stomach that makes you want hurl and run away, take a second to think. You may think you know what is causing you to feel that way, and there is a good chance that you're wrong. Think about it carefully, because an incorrect assumption can get you in a lot of trouble. If that ever happens, just pray that somewhere, somehow, you have a watcher nearby.",

        "text": "**\"Breaking news, reports have just come in that confirm the complete decommissioning and destruction of Monolith industry site 46 after the chemical disaster last year. Here's Rhonda with more on the subject.\"**\n\n**\"Thank you, Tom. I am currently standing just outside of the abandoned chemical plant Site 46, which, for the past 15 years, has been the city's primary chemical and pharmaceutical distribution plant. Last year, the site experienced a nasty chemical spill that was reported to have resulted in the deaths of no fewer than at least 30 of the workers and--\"**\n\nI shut the laptop after that. I couldn't watch anymore. They were actually doing it, they were going to demolish Site 46. After everything that happened, and they're just destroying it. How fuckin' rich.\n\nLook, I'm sorry, I... I don't know how to really go about this. I'll say that if my therapist is reading this, yeah, you get your way, pal, I'm finally writing about this like you've been bitching at me to do for at least the past 8 months. I know he means well, and hopefully he's right that it'll actually help me, but you'll see in a bit why it's taken me this long to want to talk about what happened.\n\nIf there was one fact that those idiots on the tube managed to actually slip that was true, it was that the place had served as the city's top chemical distribution center for the longest time. I was 15 when it first opened, and over those next couple of years, I'd gradually see more and more people's houses stocked with their products. They basically assimilated the Pharmeceutical supply and distribution  industry in my city in just 3 or 4 short years.\n\nTheir biggest claim to fame was how their products could *actually* cure or stabilize just about any condition. I remember even seeing claims supporting how it could treat early stages of cancer without the need for chemo *and* had even less of a relapse rate to boot. Oh, and the best part; this shit came with little to no side effects. How fuckin' lucky for us, right? Yeah, that was Site 46, the heaven of pharmaceutical junkies. Funny enough, too, where as with most other over the counter meds, their shit didn't have much, if anybody at all, getting hooked on it either.\n\nIn short, the place was the manufacturer of miracle cures. Now for those about to accuse me of blowing smoke up your asses, running your mouths that that's all \"too good to be true\", well, you're right and wrong. While this *does* sound like a pipe dream or wishful thinking, I promise you, it *was* real, all of it, and I promise you, I wish more than anything that it wasn't.\n\nOkay, so now that you know a little about Site 46, let me get into what happened a year ago. By that time, I'd been working there for about 4 or 5 years, had risen through the ranks and been promoted to Operations Supervisor of the plant, and thought I'd seen the place inside and out. I'd even gotten Employee of the month twice in a row. \"Iron Rod\" was my nickname around the plant on account of all the overtime I kept pulling. What could I say, the money was great and I didn't have a family yet, only my out of town girlfriend who I got to see every other week, so why not milk the biggest cash cow in my city for all it was worth, you know?\n\nI remember that day, the bell for lunch hour had just rang and my crew and I had all filed into the cafeteria. I sat down next to my work buddy, Ben, and started wolfing down my triple cheeseburger deluxe (with bacon, too) while he just stared at his tray like it'd just told him his mother had died. \"Ben, you okay, man?\" I asked over an admittedly large mouthful of burger.\n\n\"Huh?\" he asked, dazed. \"Oh, uh... Yeah, I uh... Yeah, I'm fine.\" I raised my eyebrow.\n\n\"You sure? Cause I mean...\" I gestured to my half eaten burger, \"It's bacon triple cheeseburger deluxe day, man.\"\n\n\"I know... I just...\" He started rubbing his forehead. I noticed then just how much he was sweating. Now, I should mention that this all happened right smack in the middle of the winter, and keep in mind, too, the A.C. in the plant might as well have been nonexistent, with the temperature having to remain below freezing for the chemicals. The kitchen was the only place where any kind of heat would've existed. Hell, I was actually having to wear my coat inside the cafeteria just to eat. But not Ben. He was in just his work uniform, a bright orange shirt with the Site 46 logo on it, and heavy work slacks.\n\n\"Hey man, you sure nothing's up, I mean, you're burning up.\"\n\n\"I... I don't know, I just feel woozy for some reason.\"\n\n\"You eat anything this morning?\"\n\n\"Yeah, remember the pancakes from the drive thru?\"\n\n\"Oh yeah... Well how long have you been feeling ill?\"\n\n\"It just started 10 minutes ago. I don't know man.\" He scooted his tray towards me. \"Here, you want this?\" I looked at the tray. He'd taken only a small bite of his sandwich and left his fries all but untouched. I looked back up at him and saw his eyelids starting to flutter like they'd had lead weights dangling from them.\n\n\"Ben?\" He started, looking back to me. His breathing started getting heavy. \"Ben, come on, we need to get you to the--\" My words died in my throat when, out of nowhere, he fell out of his chair and hit the ground, headfirst. \"Ben!\" I shouted, dropping down to him. His eyes looked glazed and his skin had already started going pale. \"Somebody get the medical team!\"\n\nBy this time, the cafeteria had already started into a commotion, with everyone gathering around and a general uproar already brewing. On the ground, Ben's body was perfectly still and I watched a steady red stream run from Ben's nose, eyes, ears, and mouth. My heart started racing, then I noticed that the liquid running out of him wasn't exactly what I was expecting. By this I mean that, rather than a thick, viscous stream of blood like normal, it was thin, watery, looking more like cherry kool-aid than blood. This sent my head spinning as well.\n\n*Dear God, that isn't blood, is it? What the hell's happening to him?* It was about a minute later when the emergency medical alarm sounded which meant that someone, somewhere in the plant had collapsed or was in a seriously critical condition, which alerted everyone to clear the room for the medical and chem-hazard crews to arrive at the scene. Thirty seconds after that, the teams entered the room and escorted myself and everyone else out.\n\nThe entire time, all I could think about was if Ben would make it. We were all led out to the hallway and made to wait until either the area was deemed safe to reenter or we would have to be escorted to the quarantine zones ourselves. It was more than twenty, possibly more than thirty, minutes before we finally saw the teams clearing out of the room, where we were then being escorted to the quarantine zone while alarms began blaring all around us.\n\n**\"Attention all personnel in the east wing, I repeat, attention all personnel in the east wing, please report to the quarantine zone immediately. This is not a drill, I repeat, this is not a drill!\"**\n\nMy eyes grew. *What the hell?! What happened, why's the entire east wing being told to quarantine?*\n\nTypically, in situations such as medical or biohazard, the protocol only dictated that those closest to the exposed or infected persons -- in this case, those in the cafeteria -- were required to undergo quarantine, hence why it was only a small bunker to begin with. It's not meant to fit an entire wing of the plant. If they were having to go to *this* extreme of measures, it meant only one thing, whatever the hazard was, whatever had taken Ben down, had already been exposed to at least 2-300 or more other workers and was likely *still* spreading.\n\nEven worse was the fact that when they cleared out of the room, Ben wasn't brought out. That's when I started to go ballistic, knowing full well what was about to happen. See, in cases of a biohazard like this, there was one remedy they'd use called \"Rinsing\". Basically, through some sort of cocktail of phosgene, chlorine, sodium chloride and one or two other household chemicals being mixed in just the right way, they set off a cloud in the exposed area that completely sterilizes the room, essentially incinerating, or \"rinsing\", the area of all hazardous chemicals or bacteria. It's highly effective, naturally...\n\nUnfortunately, a little *too* much so.\n\nThanks to the aforementioned mix, namely the phosgene aspect, if you were in the \"rinsing zone\", well... Good news is, you won't have to worry about an infection or unknown contagion anymore -- because you won't have much of a *body* anymore. \"Wait!\" I shouted, \"What the hell are you doing? Someone's still in there!\"\n\nA Chem-hazard member blocked me from approaching any closer, telling me, \"You can't go any further, sir. Please go with the rest to the quarantine zone.\"\n\n\"I can't, you're about to--\" I was cut off when two other men in hazmat suits approached from either side to take me by my arms and begin leading me down the hall. \"Get off of me! Stop, you can't do this, my friend's still in there!\" I struggled frantically against them, but it was no use. I was dragged further down the hall, pathetically kicking and screaming, \"You're killing my friend!\" like a frenzied child in a grocery store who was showing their little ass.\n\nEventually, I was finally thrown inside the cramped ass quarantine bunker before they walked off without so much as another word or nod in my direction. As soon as the door closed, I rushed it and started howling at them, \"You bastards! You fuckin' killed him!\" Eventually, I managed to cause a ruckus long enough for one of the others there to come over and pull me away from the door and tell me to shut the hell up.\n\n\"They... They-they...\" I stammered, my brain completely fried.\n\n\"Calm down, Rod.\" demanded Daniel, the shift manager of my area of the plant. The two of us had a stare down for about 5 seconds before I finally broke, taking a deep breath to relax. Everyone else around me looked shook up themselves. I heard indistinct chatter throughout the room, much of it, from what I could understand, was geared towards the obvious question; what the hell was going on?\n\n\"What happened to Ben?\" I heard someone ask.\n\n\"I saw him collapse,\" I heard another reply. He then turned to me and asked, \"You were with him, Rod, what do you think happened?\" I just stared blankly at him. How the hell was *I* supposed to know?\n\n\"Maybe he had an allergic reaction to something he ate?\" our data manager, Edna, chimed in.\n\n\"An allergic reaction?\" Daniel asked, stupefied. \"You *see* what happened to him?\" He stared moving his hands down his face from his nose to mimic blood fall. \"Had shit runnin' all outta every hole he had. You think *that* was from somethin' he ate?\"\n\n\"Okay, well what's *your* theory then?\" Edna rebutted.\n\n\"I don't know, but it sure as shit wasn't the food. Hell, it's the same thing we was all eatin'. If it was the food, shouldn't we all be bleeding out of our faces like we was livin' an Edgar Allan Poe story?\"\n\n\"Not only that,\" I chimed in finally, \"but he barely ate any of it. Not to mention the fact that that wouldn't have likely triggered an evacuation and quarantine of the entire east wing of the plant, would it?\" Daniel nodded in regard to me while Edna shrank back down. \"No, whatever this is, it's coming from somewhere in the plant itself.\n\n\"But what, where?\" asked another of the grunts in the stuffed room around me. Again, I just shrugged at this.\n\n\"Whatever it is, it better be the most dangerous thing in the world that they're trying to prevent.\" I said this through gritted teeth. *If they're having to go and fry Ben over it, yeah... it better be a fuckin' world ending threat!*\n\n\"Well, how do we know *we* haven't been infected with it?\" asked a particularly annoying grunt from around the plant named Craig.\n\n\"We don't,\" I replied, sighing.\n\n\"Why the hell do you think we're in here, dumbass?\" Daniel added.\n\n\"Yeah, but... what if... What if we're not *all* infected?\"\n\n\"Well then I guess you'll have nothing to worry about, will you? Now can you do us all a favor and shut up?\"\n\n\"But what I'm saying is, what if there IS someone here who's got whatever that was that got Ben? We'll be locked in here with it. We'll all get infected and we'll be trapped!\"\n\n\"Then in that case, we'll at least get a break from hearing your whiny ass mouth, huh? How's that sound everybody?\" No one replied to this. On any other day, and under any other circumstances, I'd have been right there with Daniel, berating Craig to quit being a fuckin' baby. The dude's the walking definitions of both the terms \"Hypochondriac\" and \"Worry wart\", and he couldn't help himself but to make a show out of expressing his fears to the rest of the free world, making it their problem as well. Thing was, after thinking about it for a moment, I started to realize Craig might have an unfortunate point.\n\nThe bad news about this is that, given that we were in a cramped ass space with a bunch of already panicked people, and I couldn't just reassure them the way Daniel was, in his own pushy and messed up way. The crowd started trying to space themselves apart from each other, which of course was impossible, given that there was barely enough room to fit us in there the way we were to begin with. I could hear a rumbling murmur start to brew as well.\n\n\"Calm down, calm down, people.\" Daniel announced. \"Look, it's been a crazy day, can we please just keep it together and see what's actually goin' on?\"\n\n\"Dan's right.\" shouted someone from the back. Dan made a gesture toward the voice before turning to face me. \"Now Rod, you said that Ben hadn't eaten anything before he collapsed?\" I sullenly nodded. \"What about this morning, he eat anything then?\"\n\n\"Don't know, he and I were assigned different departments this morning. He was in the chem lab while I was throwing freight in the warehouse.\"\n\n\"What about yesterday, or hell maybe the day before? He complain about feelin' ill any time then?\"\n\n\"Huh-uh, he was just fine until an hour ago.\"\n\n\"He say anything before he collapsed in the cafeteria?\" asked someone at my right. I shook my head in response.\n\n\"Not really,\" I replied, squinting to remember the events. \"He just said he wasn't hungry, and he was sweating.\"\n\n\"You know what he was doin' in chem?\" asked Daniel. I gave him the look you'd give to someone who'd just asked you how to play a banjo underwater. \"How the hell am I supposed to know?\" He held up his hands.\n\n\"Just askin', I mean, you were friends with him, wasn't ya?\"\n\n\"Yeah, but you know good and damn well as I do, they'd sooner have him dead than let him slip whatever the hell was goin' on in there.\" He nodded his head and turned around again.\n\n\"Well then, what the hell *is* going on, here?\" asked another one of our \"Steel jockeys\" (the term we affectionately gave to the crew primarily working the machines in the processing station), Hannah.\n\n\"The man just said he didn't know.\" shouted someone else from the back.\n\n\"Didn't I tell y'all to calm the hell down?\" Daniel said.\n\n\"Look, I don't know what the hell happened, and I don't know what the hell was going on with Ben in Chem lab, okay? Here's what I DO know; one minute, I'm enjoying a delicious burger like the rest of you, and the next, my friend's writhing on the fuckin' floor with shit comin' out of every available hole, and now we're all stuck in here. That's it. I'm not hiding anything, I'm not exaggerating anything, no, that's all I know, and I'd like to leave it alone now, if that's all the same to you all.\"\n\n\"Well said, bud.\" retorted Daniel.\n\n\"Still, we need to make sure no one's sick, don't we?\" whined Craig. Daniel groaned.\n\n\"And here we go again.\"\n\n\"I'm serious. You want to end up with, pardon my french, shit coming out of every available hole like Rod was talking about?\"\n\n\"And how the hell're we gonna do that?\" Edna piped up.\n\n\"Spit sample?\" one from the back shouted.\n\n\"Piss in a cup, maybe?\" shouted another.\n\n\"Why don't we--\"\n\n\"Enough, people.\" declared Daniel, annoyed. \"I don't wanna keep saying this, settle the hell down.\"\n\n\"But what if someone's--\"\n\n\"Then we'll take care of it, but for God's sakes, can we maybe not cause people to die of a panic attack in the meantime, please?\"\n\n\"What's the point then?\" asked someone from my left. \"If we start dying off already, how the hell are we supposed to \"deal with it then?\" Daniel sighed.\n\n\"Alright fine, since y'all want to get all in a tizzy about this shit, here's what we'll do,\" He turned to me and asked, \"Just before he fell out, he have any sort of symptoms?\"\n\n\"Sorta. He was pale, sweating his ass off and said he felt dizzy.\"\n\n\"So basically the symptoms of a cold?\" I shrugged.\n\n\"I guess.\"\n\n\"Well alright then, here's what we do, everyone's gonna turn to the person next to you, and if they look like they're a little under the weather, then we'll make sure to stay away from 'em and alert the med team. Capisce?\" They all began turning and mumbling to themselves while cautiously examining each other. Daniel and I gave each other a very quick up and down with a look of \"Yeah, we'll do it too, anything that shuts these fuckin' hippies up.\"\n\nAbout ten minutes later, the room settled down again. \"Alright, so everyone satisfied?\" Daniel asked. \"Was anyone sick?\" He waited a moment before continuing with, \"No? Okay then, so we can all relax now, right?\" The crowd glanced back and forth between themselves and themselves and Daniel. He took this to mean they agreed with him and said, \"Okay, now, from here on, I say we sit here and wait until the hazmat crew gives us the all clear. All in favor, say aye.\"\n\nA very subdued \"aye\" was heard from the crowd. I turned and looked back through the porthole window of the door. *Just wait here, our thumbs up our asses until they come back for us...*\n\nI thought again about Ben. What the hell *was* he doing in the Chem lab, I wondered. Sure, in our line of work, it was normal for one of us Steel jockeys or grunts to be volunteered for work in the Chemical department -- that's just about any factory, right? Stand in a room and get pepper sprayed or have some crap slathered all over you or drink some weird juice so they don't have to pay people off the street, and you get a little extra in your next check, right?\n\nBut then, most places like this weren't secretive like Monolith was, were they? I mean, waivers were one thing, but they didn't just threaten with termination of employment or prosecution, we were under pain of death to keep our traps shut, according to common word of mouth anyway. Admittedly, no one had ever tried, not that we actually knew of, but then, no one we knew of was foolish enough to try, either. I tried thinking of others I knew who'd been called for test monkey duties. From what I could remember, they'd all turned out fine, no real changes at all, save maybe a bit of renewed energy that would always have us confused.\n\n*\"Hey, lookie there, yesterday, Larry can't even lift the crate off the ground without almost throwing his back out, now he's Captain America after a stay in the Chem lab. What, did they give ya an extra servin' of spinach?\"*\n\nThose, and a good few others, were some of the jokes we'd used to crack with 'em, but we were genuinely shocked and curious. Unfortunately, again, there was no way to get the secret ourselves.\n\n*What are y'all hiding?* I thought, staring out into the dark, dingy hallway. Hours ticked by like they were days and I heard my stomach roar at me furiously. *Wonder if they're even gonna have the goddamn decency to bring us some food...*\n\nI wasn't the only one with this idea, either, just the only one who wouldn't voice it. Edna would take that monicker. \"God, anyone else starving?\"\n\n\"I am, shit.\" replied another from the back.  I raised my hand in agreeance.\n\n\"Yeah, I'm feeling it too.\" Daniel conceded.\n\n\"What should we do?\" asked someone from my right.\n\n\"What can we do?\" asked Edna. \"They can't hear us in here, can they?\"\n\n\"Don't think so.\" said Daniel. \"There's no microphones in--\"\n\n\"Not true.\" Craig piped up. We all looked at him curiously.\n\nDaniel scoffed. \"That right, and how the hell would you know that?\"\n\n\"I work maintenance, remember?\" Craig nodded, chuckling. \"Yeah, they installed microphones in the walls in case they had to evacuate the quarantine zones.\"\n\nI frowned. \"Evacuate the quarantine zones? but then, why the hell bring us here? I mean, this is THE safe zone, right? THE last resort, right? What in hell could be so bad they'd need to evac this place?\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"Like you said, how am *I* supposed to know what the hell those lab monkeys do up there?\"\n\nI nodded and said, \"Good point.\"\n\n\"Okay, so what, we find the microphone and order takeout?\" Daniel asked. \"Cause, I mean, I doubt they're in any hurry to come rushing down here after us without knowing whether or not whatever happened out there's been dealt with.\"\n\n\"Well we gotta eat something.\" Craig whined.\n\n\"He's right.\" said someone from the right. I turned around again and stood up.\n\nEyeing Daniel, I said, \"Why don't we hold a vote then. Raise your hand if you think we should try calling for them to come down here.\" About half the room, plus a few others raised their hands. \"Now those in favor of waiting like Daniel says, raise your hands.\" About the same amount of people on the other side, this time including Daniel, raised their hands. I noticed there were a few that still hadn't raised their hands, so I asked who was undecided. They didn't raise their hands, but they did look at me.\n\nLooking to Daniel again, I said, \"Well, majority vote rules we at least give it a try.\" Daniel sighed and threw up his hands. \"Craig, where the hell's this microphone thing?\" He turned and pointed to the far corner of the room.\n\n\"Just gotta find the button somewhere along the wall.\"\n\n\"Along the wall?\" someone asked.\n\n\"Yeah, it's all built into the wall, that way it couldn't be tampered with.\"\n\n*\"Tampered with\"? Who the hell would want to tamper with an intercom mic?* Craig went over to the far corner of the room and reached up as far as he could. He was too short though. \"Hey, can anyone reach up for me?\" I walked over to him and asked where I was supposed to reach for. \"There.\"\n\nI reached up and felt across the wall. Surprisingly, I realized it was only common drywall holding the place together. I felt across for a second before feeling a slight protrusion in the wall. *Bingo.*\n\n\"Got it?\" he asked\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"Good, now just hold the button down and shout into it.\" I mashed the button.\n\n\"Hello!\" I shouted. \"Hey, uh... When's someone gonna come to bring us food?\"\n\n\"Well be direct, why don't ya?\" Daniel remarked sarcastically. There was no answer or sound from the other end.\n\n\"Hello?!\"\n\n\"Maybe they're away from the reciever?\" suggested one person from behind me.\n\n\"Huh-uh.\" Craig replied, \"Like I said, that's supposed to be an emergency thing, meant to be heard in the event of a dire emergency.\"\n\n\"In other words, you speak through there, and it's supposed to be heard throughout the facility?\" Daniel asked.\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"Well then I guess they went deaf, cause I shouted as loud as I could into the damn thing.\"\n\n\"Try again.\"\n\n\"Hold on, Craig.\" Enda said, \"How do you know this? Has it ever been used?\" Craig's face sunk.\n\n\"So wait a minute,\" Daniel chimed in, \"You're getting our hopes up over something you don't even actually know works?\"\n\n\"Oh, and I see *you* coming up with a better solution?\" Craig rebutted. \"Yeah, just sit on our asses and *hope* they actually come back for us?\"\n\n\"Better than you getting everybody in here all riled up over nothing.\" He had a point, admittedly. Then again, so did Craig. The room was breaking into another rumbling murmur.\n\nI piped up, \"Well, I'm not too keen on staying in here any longer than I have to if I can help it.\" I turned again and hit the intercom. \"Hey! Hey, it's me, Rodger McCormick. Look, we've been in here for the past three hours and--\" I was cut off when I heard a low, weird sort of humming noise coming from the ceiling. About four or five seconds later, the lights in the bunker shut off abruptly. Several loud, ear-splitting screams echoed around us before a louder, droning whirr came on, followed by the soft, crimson glow of the emergency lights.\n\n*What the hell? Power outage?*\n\n\"What happened?\" asked someone from somewhere in the room -- I couldn't really tell anymore where certain voices were coming from.\n\n\"Power went out.\" Craig replied, stupefied.\n\n\"But how, what happened?\" asked Edna.\n\n\"How the hell am I supposed to know?\"\n\n\"Rod?\" she asked. *Oh great, now it's MY fault...*\n\nI shrugged. \"Fuck if I know, sweetheart. I just hit the button like I was told to and now...\" I waved my hand about the room. I turned to Craig and asked, \"You sure that's the one for the *intercom*?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I'm sure of it. Put the damn thing in there myself, I promise.\"\n\n\"So now what do we do?\" asked someone.\n\n\"Stay calm, that's what.\" Daniel declared. \"Look, I'm sure there's a reason for this, and everything's gonna be alright, so long as we keep our heads and--\"\n\n\"Hang on a minute.\" I said, stopping Daniel. Turning to Craig again, I asked, \"Aren't the doors on an electronic seal?\" He frowned for a second before his eyes widened, picking up where I was going with this. \"And emergency power wouldn't cover those, would it?\"\n\n\"Nope, not that I know of.\" I turned to Daniel.\n\n\"What're you planning, Rod?\" he asked cautiously before realization hit him like a moving train and he immediately went wide eyed. \"Are you nuts?!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"What? What's the problem with getting the hell out of here?\"\n\n\"You mean *other* than the fact that we have absolutely no fuckin' clue what the hell's out there? Jesus man, I knew you were a bonehead sometimes but come on, this's fuckin' insane!\"\n\n\"Well I can't say I'd be any better then.\" said Craig. Daniel scoffed.\n\n\"Oh, of course *you* can't.\"\n\n\"Look,\" I said, \"If you wanna stay, I get it, but I'm out.\" I turned to the crowd then and declared, \"Anyone else joining me or am I going it alone?\"\n\n\"I'm in.\" Craig piped up.\n\n\"I'm with you, see ya.\" said Edna. I heard a few other people say they were in as well as we headed for the door.\n\n\"You're making a mistake, man, I'm tellin' ya.\" Daniel warned. \"All of ya.\" We of course ignored him and opened the door, venturing out into the blood red lit hallway. Just as soon as the last person joining me was out of the chamber, I heard the door slam shut. I took a brief glance behind me to see Daniel staring back at me through the porthole window with a look of grim expectation. A look that told me just as loud as he could actually shout the words *\"Damn fools\"*. We then ventured further down the hallway.\n\nThe walk was relatively silent; surprising a bit to me, considering the circumstances -- me leading a bunch of frightened plant workers (who frankly don't get paid quite enough to be dealing with a bunch of shit like this) down a hallway that looks like something that came straight out of a sci-fi movie right before the monster comes out. The entire time, too, I had one thing to keep repeating in my head, what in the unholy hell are we going to find once we make it back to the surface level? What caused the power to go out?\n\nThere were about a thousand others, obviously, but before any more of them could grab my focus, our little party was forced to a dead halt. Dead ahead of us, we heard the groan of what I assumed to be a dying animal, like a deer or something similar, echo all the way down. \"What was that?\" Craig asked panicking. The sound rang out again. It was closer this time, moving toward us.\n\nMy back stiffened and my hands clenched. \"What do we do?\" I heard someone behind me ask.\n\n\"Maybe we should turn back.\" said another from behind me.\n\n\"We can't. You really think they'd let us back in?\" I heard Craig retort. My eyes stayed locked in front of me. Admittedly, a part of me couldn't help but do what the one guy said and make a break back for the quarantine chamber, but at the same time, I knew Craig was right. Daniel's stare said it all. We made our bed, and now we'd have to sleep in it. Possibly for good.\n\nThe hallway was quiet again for about twenty seconds before we heard it again. This time, it sounded noticeably more painful, tortured even. I closed my eyes, took a deep, though shuddering breath, and said, \"Alright, everyone stay here, I'm gonna go see what's going on.\" I turned to Craig, \"You're with me.\"\n\n\"Wait what?!\" he exclaimed, his eyes about two seconds from shooting out at me like they were bullets firing from his skull.\n\n\"You heard me, come on.\"\n\n\"Hold up, how the hell are you gonna just waltz down there and \"check that out\"? You don't even know what it is. Oh, and you wanna drag *me* in too?\" I just stood staring at him, my right eyelid drooping. This was the absolute last thing I needed right then; a bitch-rant session from Monolith's top contender for \"Poindexter of the Month\" award. I wanted to slug the absolute crap out of him and tell him to finally grow a goddamn pair, but I didn't.\n\nNo, instead I sighed, smiled my most shit-eating grin, and told him, \"Okay, you're right. Clearly, you're smarter and wiser than I am, so I think you should take the driver's seat for a while, eh?\" I ended this with a wink. He just stared back at me, confused.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"Yeah, since you're apparently the smartest of us, why don't *you* decide what we do next?\" He stiffened, darting his eyes around at me and everyone else. \"Well?\"\n\n\"Okay, fine, look, I don't know what to do. We can't go back and--\"\n\n\"And so, therefore, I'll be taking lead again, glad we're on the same page on that. Now, first order is that your ass and mine is gonna march down there and see what the hell's going on, capisce?\" He looked pleadingly at me for a moment before diverting his eyes to the ground. \"Good, now come on.\"\n\nThe two of us walked quickly, though hesitantly, down to the end of the hall where the sound had come from. The further we went, the darker it became. The red light almost completely dissipated at around the halfway point, almost completely shrouding the two of us in complete darkness. I couldn't much see my own two hands when I held them up to my face. When we got about the rest of the way to the other end, I heard the sound again.\n\nThis time was different, though, in that it wasn't so much a groaning sound, but more like *gurgling.* Instead of sounding like something or someone was in excruciating pain, it was now like they were underwater, or at least gargling water, if you understand what I'm saying. This was followed with several sounds of hacking or sort of like wheezing noises. Someone was choking, I thought, and my pace quickened. \"Hello?\" I called out, \"Hang on, I'm coming!\"\n\n\"Whoa, wait a minute, man, what're you doing?\" I ignored him and kept going. The groaning had stopped again.\n\n\"Hello, are you hurt?\"\n\n\"Rod, what the hell are you-- Oh my God!\" I turned around to see the color drain completely from Craig's face. He was staring directly ahead of me, into the darkness ahead. I turned around again to find a man shambling down through the hall in front of us. Being as dark as it was, I couldn't see much, but I was able to make out that the guy's skin was *literally* albino. He was tall, too, painfully skinny, looking like a P.O.W., and made this weird guttural sort of noise from his mouth which hung almost to the floor as he stumbled drunkenly along. Briefly, too, I noticed he was wearing a hazmat suit, without the helmet.\n\n\"S-Sir?\" I called out, shivering slightly. The only reply I got was that gurgling sound again. I could hear Craig shivering behind me like he was cold. Being perfectly honest, I could feel the temperature drop a few degrees myself. I took a small step backward.\n\n\"Sir, are you okay?\" He stopped this time, snapping his head to his right side like he was examining me. My heart rate quickened. The way he was looking at me, sizing me up almost, and the wobbly, uncoordinated balance of his body gave me the impression who or whatever this was, they weren't exactly friendly. \"Who are you?\" I asked.\n\nHe took a stumbling step forward, to which I stepped backwards. I repeated my question. \"Dude, I think we need to--\" The stumbling figure cut him off by letting out a loud, tortured moan that sounded like a mix between a dying man and a man coughing up water that echoed all the way down through the hallway. Both mine and Craig's hearts jumped at this.\n\nAnother step forward saw the man fall onto his face. I rushed over to him then and was about to reach out to him when his back split open. At first, it looked like something had exploded and we shielded our faces from the splatter, except there was no splatter. We looked again to then see these weird vines or tendrils coming out of his back. They wormed their way out of the hole like an army of squirming baby snakes before becoming rigid, anchoring themselves into the ground.\n\nWhat happened next was a mix of two things. The first is that Craig and I started sprinting back down the hall while we heard the sounds of simultaneous pounding come from behind us. Like the dumbass I am, I chanced a look behind me to see something that will always haunt my nightmares. Those things, the tentacles or whatever, were charging for us at top speed while the poor bastard's body just dangled limply as it went along. The way it looked, too, was almost like whatever had happened had somehow made his bones disappear, leaving him nothing more than a fleshy sack being moved along by the tentacles. Even worse was it was in the red light when I saw it, making his empty, sagging flesh  look all the more ghoulish.\n\nBefore I even realized it, Craig was snatched up by his ankle and ripped backward. I just briefly caught a glimpse of his body whizzing by, screaming, as I kept running. I didn't dare look back again. I didn't see what happened to Craig, and I didn't want to. The last thing from him was a series of painful wailing before going silent completely. By that time, I'd made it back to the others. \"GO!\" I shouted. \"Come on, we have to go, now!\"\n\n\"Rod, what's happened, what was that?\" Edna asked.\n\n\"Where's Craig?\" someone else asked. I started pushing them down the hall back toward the bunker.\n\n\"Forget about him, come on!\" By the time I could get the crowd moving, though, the thumping came barreling down the hall. *Oh Jesus...*\n\nThe crowd got one good look and then it was over. They couldn't clamor through that cramped crimson hallway fast enough. I can still hear the screams of the particularly unlucky few who'd tripped and were promptly trampled underfoot. Even more than them, of course, I remember the mix of the screams of people being snatched like how Craig was and the sort of gurgling roar the creature was making. I kept running, praying to God that the tentacles would stay busy with the others long enough to make it back to the bunker-- morbid and callous as that sounds.\n\nIronically, in a sick sort of way, I managed to make it a foot away from the bunker, only for the thing to then land right out of the air in front of me. It's rolled eyeballs, only very loosely held inside its sagging sockets, bore through mine. Its gurgling noise became a high pitched screech when I noticed that one eye wasn't actually looking at me at all, instead cocked a bit to the side to look *behind* me. My head snapped around to see all of the bodies, all looking like bloody human swiss cheese, twitching.\n\nI did at least three double takes between the bodies and the creature, expecting him to pincushion me like the rest when I saw something even worse start to happen. Each and every one of them had begun to make that same gurgling noise, leaking red fluid from their mouths, ears, and noses like Ben was, before a loud *POP* noise erupted from each of them, where tentacles sprouted from their backs and stomachs. This thing didn't just kill them -- it infected them, too.\n\nThey all rose up and surrounded me. I was choked off, there was nowhere I could run to. My heart was speeding, my body twitching yet rigid at the same time. They all closed in on me and I brought my arms up in a last ditch effort to defend myself when I heard the one in front of me, the one in the hazmat suit from the hallway, almost split my ears in half with a wild shriek. I brought my arms down again to see Daniel with some sort of torch that he appeared to have fashioned using his handkerchief, his pipe wrench, and his cigarette lighter. \"Come on, quick, before these things get in!\"",

        "text": "I have something watching me. \nMy nickname is E and i am 18 years old i believe something or someone is watching me. when i was younger i lived in a very abusive house both of my parents were drug addicts and alcoholics, they got into fights almost every night, i loved them so much, i thank them for have the decency of not fighting with the kids around but it’s still sad to say sometimes i watched these go down. although they fought out of sight this doesn’t excuse the abuse they brought on to us. it was three of us, I the oldest and 2 younger siblings, my father would beat me every night when he had the chance, a slight reason was because i wasn’t his child, its hard to say you loved someone when they beat you, my mother however wasn’t as abusive as my father, she would just verbally hurt us but she was still my mother and she still loved us, i’d like to blame the drugs but i could be wrong, but let me continue, one day in kindergarten my teacher asked me why i have marks and bulbs on me and i openly told her, later that day a CPS worker came to ask me questions, at the time i had no knowledge that’s who they were so i told them everything, a week later my grandparents pick us 3 kids and took us to our aunts home. she was my “fathers” sister, but we weren’t there long because she didn’t pass the inspection by CPS, incase you didn’t know CPS stands for child protective services, i jumped from home to home separated from my siblings a few times and then i ended up at a home that had four other foster children and my brother and sister were there with me, so there were seven of us, the woman who was watching us was the worst person ever, she’d lock us in bedrooms separated by girl and boys and give us barely enough food, food for example was a piece of cheese three carrots and a slice of break and apple juice, anyways this woman was the worst, she would put baby monitors and if she heard us talking about the future she would get a mask and a air horn scared the living poop out of us children, she was so bad i learned years later that she didn’t give us enough to drink because my brother told me that he have to drink if the bathroom sink and then the toilet once she turned off the water, one day i had enough and then i rubbed my knuckle on the stair and made them bleed and got blood on the steps and the foster lady had to beat me and take the carpet of the stair, if you are wondering why the stair? well if we did something bad she would have that child sit on the steps but for some reason it was always me, but one day during a foster visit i asked to talk to one of the agents and i told her everything about the home and how bad it was and i feel like that saved us kids, but this is where the thing that watches me comes in, after that home almost every night at my new house and soon the next house that will adopt me i always and still more than 3 times a week i feel as if someone is watching me, i’m 18 i still can barely get the courage to go to the bathroom because i feel a presence in the living room and down the stairs, scariest part is my adoptive parents sleep with the door open but even though i feel and hear my parents breathing and their presence i just get chills from something on the opposite side of my house, sometimes i feel like a black 7 foot figure is outside my house as well, all it does it look into my front door window and through the glass door in my to back yard, call me crazy but something is haunting me this very second i write this",

        "text": "Music has and always will be my life.\n\nFrom a young age I was fascinated by everything to do with it. The sounds and rhythm enthralled me, in ways I cannot even begin to explain. As soon as I laid my hands on a piano for the first time, I knew where I was headed in life. With relative ease, I quickly moved my way through to the upper grades, and I was able to surpass my teacher's ability at 16 years old.\n\nA prodigy, they called me. They said I had a level of skill unmatched by most, but to me it was just an unmatched love. I loved something so much, I just couldn't get enough of it. Once I finished with the piano, I moved onto the guitar, and then eventually the violin.\n\nScholarships were extended to me, which I graciously accepted. My life seemed to be on a one-way fast track to the top. There were no obstacles for me to overcome, no hindrances or restraints. I was good at what I did, and everybody knew it. I was going to be something great.\n\nMusic has always been my life, so I suppose it is fitting that it will be my death as well.\n\nI was messing around on the piano one evening, switching between songs and tempos, before I decided to settle on *Clair de Lune*. A personal favourite of mine, known for its melancholic yet joyful melody. A true masterpiece. It's one of those songs that I can keep coming back to and yet never get bored of it.\n\nLost in the music, I almost didn't hear it when someone quietly spoke up.\n\n\"It's beautiful, isn't it?\"\n\nI jerked my head up to see a lanky man cloaked in a black, billowing robe leaning on the far end of my piano. Out of shock, I began to stand, ready to defend myself if need be. But he shook his head, and held up a hand, while wagging a finger.\n\n\"Now, don't stop just for someone like me.\" He said, in a hollow, rasping voice.\n\nI wouldn't just take orders from a stranger, especially one in my apartment. But the power in his voice, the *authority.* It was so alien and unnatural. This was someone who could kill me with a blink of an eye.  I sat back down. \n\nHe smiled. \"Good. Now play and don't stop.\n\nUnsure of what to play, I simply picked up where I left off. The man in the cloak tilted his head ever so slightly, and began walking towards me.\n\n\"That's better, music is the life of the soul, you know.\" I could feel his gaze shift over my body, as if looking for a meal. He let out a small chuckle. \"Well, of course you know that, look at you.\"\n\nHis voice was cold, and he seemed to be amused by what was happening. He continued his travels around the piano before coming to a stop behind me, placing a hand on each of my shoulders. Now that he was closer, I realised he had an awful smell coming from him, similar to a rotting carcass. The smell was so strong that I began to feel light-headed. Yet I still played, fearing for my life.\n\n*Who the hell is this guy?* I thought. *What does he want?*\n\nI heard a small, metallic rasp come from behind me, like a sword coming out of its sheath. He continued to talk. \"I can sense your fear. That is unnecessary. Do what I say and all will be well with you. I am here as a guide, a helper to take you from where you are, to where you need to be.\"\n\nAs he said that, I felt a cold blade being pressed onto the nape of my neck. I cried out in anguish, flinging my hands to where it hurt. The pain was sharp and intense, and blood left the wound freely. With skillful ease, the man grabbed my hands and placed them back on the piano, making it dirty with my bloody fingerprints.\n\n\"Do not test me, child. Continue your playing. Or that would be but a taste of what would come next.\"\n\nTrembling with fear, I continued my playing while moving onto a different song this time, *The Entertainer.* It felt fitting to me in a dark way, the jolly rhythm contrasting with my rather bleak situation.\n\nSeeming to be happy, the man moved to a corner of the room, and kept a watch on me. Stepping forward menacingly if the song had a hint of stopping. I cycled through different songs, trying to ignore the pain in my neck, and making sure to never stop playing.\n\nAfter a couple of hours of aimless playing, I mustered up the courage to speak with him.\n\n\"W-who are you?\"\n\nThe cloaked man raised an eyebrow. \"And why are you entitled to an answer?\"\n\n\"I'll stop playing if you don't tell me.\" I threatened.\n\nThe man brandished his small dagger again. And with a small smile he said, \"Go ahead. Be my guest.\"\n\nI got the message, and so I continued playing. I worried I would quickly exhaust my library of memorised songs, so I moved to slower and more romantic pieces. Songs that could last an eternity if I wanted them too. I would beat this man at his own game and *Jeux d'eau* would me my weapon of choice.\n\nThe man cocked a head, seeming surprised at my song choice. He walked forwards, and I hesitated, afraid he might wound me again. But he stopped in the middle of the room, and held up a thin hand. Instantly, the room began to change. The lights dimmed to an orange, evening hue. The furniture moved and reshaped. Shadows swirled around before settling in the middle and solidifying into two people.\n\nThe shadow people moved around the room in a slow, deliberate waltz, oblivious to all the other going-ons. Suddenly, bright colours swarmed in through the ceiling, replacing the blackness with vibrant hues. The shadows took on clearer forms. It was a middle-aged couple, obviously in love, hands by each others hips, dancing while embraced in a passionate kiss.\n\nAnd the man was me.\n\nWell, not exactly. He was older, hunched over with age, wearing clothes you would never catch me dead in. And yet he was me. I don't know how, but it just made sense. It's like the information simply appeared in my brain. While still playing, I looked expectantly at the robed man. \n\n\"Is...that me?\" I questioned.\n\n\"It was you in one circumstance.\"\n\n\"...what?\"\n\n\"Your path merged with this woman and remade itself. You became another. Your time was longer.\"\n\n\"Did you kill him...me?\" \n\nHe shifted his gaze away from me, seeming to be in a quiet contemplation. But his silence gave me the answer I needed.\n\n\"Will you kill me?\"\n\nHe turned to face me again. \"I would not be so rude as to remove someone from this plane while they do what they love.\"\n\nI shivered at what he was implying, and moved to a new song with renewed vigour. As the song changed, the scenery changed also, transforming into the feelings the song conveyed. I would be shown new places, new people I could have been. A doctor, a semi-professional singer, a member of parliament, a father, and even a mother.\n\nAnd they were all me. Or another path as the man called it.\n\nOccasionally, he would walk up to me with a somber look on his face, and draw out his dagger again. I would tense with fear over what I knew would come next. The pain was searing and continuous, but would not deter me from my task, which was to continue playing. My body was dotted with scars of various lengths, the primal need to stop what I was doing and tend to my scars was strong, but my will to live was stronger.\n\nBut, the longer I go on, the longer that aforementioned will diminishes. I fear that I am playing myself to death. Fingers were not meant to be used like this, especially in the condition I am in. My skin was falling off, infection seemed to be creeping in, the piano was a bloody mess, and yet I still played. The constant threat of yet another cut scared me into compliance.\n\nBut even then, one still has limits. It feels as I have been playing for weeks now. Entire days of nothing but playing music. There is only so longer I can go on, the movement has made my hands bruised and weathered, the constant playing giving the scars no time to heal. Some of the skin on my fingers have been shaved off to the bone. I feel as if every note I play is another step further into my grave. The pain is immense and ceaseless, the longer I play the worse it gets. Every atom of my body screams at me to stop. Hoping for some respite, a chance to go move on.\n\nBut I know this is my end.\n\nI have begun to play with my feet now, which are bruised and callused beyond repair, so that I may dictate my final moments to others. I am playing nothing at all, and yet still playing, which seems to be acceptable within the rules. Although, the man doesn't seem to be too happy with that. The room is now darker, shadows surrounding every corner, disjointed whispering echoing from every angle.\n\nHe is showing me of my path's lowest moments. Moments I didn't live through, and yet that I can somehow remember. I can see myself crying in the night after losing a child, lying on a basement floor with no way to call for help after overdosing on drugs, driving home drunk from the bar and never reaching my destination.\n\nHe showed me the worst of me. What I could do, given the opportunity.\n\nAnd that knowledge scares me.\n\nI can tell my time in this world has almost passed. My body has reached a breaking point. I can not go further. So with a heavy heart I write this, fearful of what is too come when I eventually choose to stop. But I am hungry for a break. I can see now that a life like this is no life at all. Death welcomes me with open arms. And I am ready to embrace it.\n\nI am hurt. \n\nI am broken.\n\nI am afraid.\n\nAfter I write this, I will begin to play *Clair de Lune* once more, no matter the pain I may go through. I know that I can endure one final song. I then will stop, and see what may come next.\n\nI don't want you to think of this message as a suicide note. No, I died inside days ago. Think of this as my final symphony.\n\nMy swan song.",

        "text": "I bought my first house in December after living in apartments for years. Finally, I’d saved up enough for a down payment and searched for months and months until I found a place that I thought was perfect. It sits on a little bit of land, the neighborhood is nice, and there’s no HOA…I thought I’d found my dream home. One story, two bedrooms, one bath, great for a starter.\n\nWhen I closed on the place, I met the previous owner. He was an older man and explained with glee that he’d built it himself, literally. Eccentric was my first impression of him, as he explained how he’d gotten fed up with paying for city water and decided he’d just dig his own well in the crawl space one year. “I spent a lot of time in that crawl space,” he told me with a forlorn expression. Through the whole process, I got the distinct feeling that he didn’t really want to sell the house, but rather felt that he had to. \n\nThe inspection hadn’t turned up any issues, so I assumed that even though this man had built the house himself, he must have known what he was doing. Everything looked to be in order (to my extremely untrained eye) when I moved in and functioned as expected. I had hot water, the furnace was working…what more could a young, single guy ask for.\n\nIt wasn’t until I was setting up the living room that I noticed something…odd.\n\nThe previous owner had clearly been a movie buff as there were hooks in the ceiling where he’d hung a projection screen, and mounting left over from where the projector itself had been installed. An HDMI cable and speaker wiring were routed through the wall and all around the room to set up what must have been a very nice home theater system. Being I’m a big gamer, I was actually excited he’d left it all behind, as I’d likely be able to make good use of it all for LAN parties. Using a multimeter, I began the tedious process of checking where each wire and cable was routed, labeling them in turn.\n\nIt took a couple of hours, but eventually I was able to track everything from origin to terminus except for one cable. \n\nAn HDMI cable was routed straight up through the laminate flooring behind where he must have had his entertainment center and I couldn’t find the other end of it anywhere inside. When he’d installed the flooring, he’d managed to cut a perfect circle for the cable diameter, so the head couldn’t just fall through. And, unlike any of the other wiring, it looked like before he moved out, he’d attempted to remove it. \n\nScratches indicated he’d taken tools to the floor in an effort to cut it out, but for some reason had given up with little progress. There were marks on the cable itself as well, but he’d clearly had no success perforating it. ‘Must have some kind of aircraft grade shrouding.’ I thought. ‘Guess he either thought it just wasn’t worth the effort or didn’t want to leave me with a big hole in the floor.’ \n\nUnfortunately, given I couldn’t find the other end in the house, I knew I’d likely need to go down into the crawl space to figure out where it was routed. Wondering if maybe he’d built a secret compartment somewhere in the walls to house his media players, I decided I’d plug it in and see if there was still anything connected on the other end. \n\nI regretted that decision immediately.\n\nWhen the screen came to life…I saw grainy footage, like from a CCTV camera. In it, a woman was chained by her wrists and ankles to a wall in a dark, cramped space. She was kneeling in pea gravel and there was almost no light, the ceiling above too shallow for her to stand. Her hair was long and matted, clothes soiled and tattered, and she was so emaciated that I scarcely believed she could be alive. When she looked up, I saw the sorrow etched on her face as she wept. “Please help.” She mouthed.\n\nMy heart stopped as our gazes met… ‘Can she see me?’ I knew that to be impossible, but her eyes bored straight into mine, begging me to save her. Appalled, I leapt back and powered off the TV…a sickening sensation growing within.\n\n‘What the fuck was this guy into?’ I grew more nauseas imagining him enjoying watching this woman suffer. She was so visceral, my first reaction had been that it was real footage, but as the initial shock wore off, I tried to rationalize what I’d seen. ‘If that was real…why would he have left it behind for me to easily find? Maybe it’s some Indy horror film he really did leave in a DVD player he forgot about hidden in a wall somewhere around here.’ I reasoned. \n\nWith as much courage as I could muster…I flipped the power back on, hoping I’d find it was just a DVD menu playing on a loop. \n\nThe grainy footage returned, the space was unchanged, camera angle exactly the same, however the woman in the image was…different. Younger, not quite as emaciated…but still shackled to the wall. She too leered straight through the screen, meeting my eye-line perfectly…not just younger, she was a different woman entirely. “Please…help us.” She whispered. There was no audio coming from the TV, yet as her mouth formed the words, I could hear her in my head.\n\nIllusions that this was just an Indy film were fading rapidly. \n\n‘Was that…my crawl space?’ I began to wonder. The previous owner had mentioned he’d spent a lot of time down there… ‘Had he kept women chained below the house and I’m seeing recordings of it?’\n\n‘But then, why do her eyes follow my movements.’\n\nHer expression became more frantic. Tears began to streak down her cheeks as she again said, “Please! Help us!” Louder, her voice reverberated in my skull. She moved to bury her face in her hands and then I heard it beneath me…\n\nChains. When she moved her arms, I heard the chains under my feet.\n\n‘Jesus Christ, this is live…’ I panicked. ‘She’s below me, right now…he left her down there.’ \n\nI dropped the remote and sprinted for the backdoor. The crawl space access was outside, a small hatch on the side of the house. Pulling out my phone, I clicked on the flashlight feature, then removed the hatch, and peered inside. The light was too weak to see very far, all I could make out was the pea gravel floor, the cramped space…it all looked…familiar.\n\n“Hello?!” I yelled, “Where are you? I’m here to help!” But I received no response. ‘She must be too frail to answer.’ I considered. “Hello?!” Still nothing. \n\nFor a moment, I thought about calling 911 before going in…she’d need medical attention I was certain, but I didn’t want to leave her alone any longer. I planned to get to her first and let her know that she was safe, then I’d contact help. Brushing spiderwebs out of my path, I slid through the entryway. \n\nShining the light around the space, I still couldn’t see any sign of her, but I did see a well-worn path in the gravel. ‘Must be his route to where she’s kept…sick bastard.’ I wretched thinking about him joyfully slithering back to visit his captive. On hands and knees, I followed the trail, scanning ahead with my phone, waiting for her to appear in the beam.\n\nHowever, she never materialized, and as I reached the wall where the path ended, I was dismayed to find the area…empty. No shackles were hanging from the walls…at first glance it appeared to just be a normal crawl space…other than it reeked of bleach. ‘This can’t be right…I heard the chains…I must be right below the living room now…the sound came from right here.’ I pointed my flashlight at the walls and investigated more closely. \n\nThen I saw them…bolt holes. In a perfect square, there were four rusted rectangles imprinted in the concrete, each with four bolt holes. The eyelets for the chains had been installed here...but he must have removed them before he moved out. \n\nI continued to shine my light around the space and found where the HDMI cable came through the living room floor. It ran along the floor joists until it ended in a small, bubble style security camera, still mounted overhead, and pointing right where the woman should have been. ‘Why didn’t he remove that?’ I pondered…but the answer was right in front of me. \n\nHe had tried to remove it…tool marks covered the surface. By the looks of it, he’d tried to unscrew it, drill it out…in desperation it appeared at one point he’d tried to simply smash it with a hammer based on the scuffs in the surface of the bubble. I even noticed several reciprocating saw blades laying in the gravel, teeth completely worn down. Scoring in the wood indicated he’d tried to cut the joists…tried again to cut just the cable…all had failed. The scratches on the floor in the living room made sense now.\n\nInspecting the camera more closely, I saw it had a feature that locked the HDMI and power cable heads in place to prevent tampering, the key for which was snapped off in the lock. Every effort had been made to remove the evidence of his surveillance system, but something had prevented him from doing so.\n\n‘But, if she’s not down here now…then what did I see on the screen…?’ A cold chill ran down my spine as I recalled both of their eyes tracking my movements. A woman definitely had been here, multiple women actually based on what I’d seen upstairs, but they were gone now. ‘The camera must have internal storage…I just was seeing playback of old recordings.’ I grasped for an easy explanation. \n\nLocating the model number with the flashlight, I did a quick search on my phone and found the specs online. It was an older model…direct line HDMI feed…with no internal storage…it needed to be routed to a digital recorder to save anything. ‘That’s not possible…I saw them…’\n\nThe blood froze in my veins as I frantically searched for any other cables running from the camera to an external storage device. The power was still plugged into the wall, (also locked in place and displaying signs of a ferocious assault), and that was it. Two cables…power and display, and I knew exactly where the display cable ran above me.\n\n“HELP US!” A cacophony of voices rang in my ears. They came from all around me, but as I spun the light around, still no one appeared. Hysterically, I crawled for the entrance as quickly as hands and knees would carry me until I slid back through the opening and collapsed out onto the lawn. I didn’t even care that I’d lost a shoe at some point in my flight. \n\n“FUCK!” I yelled aloud as I stood up and tried to catch my breath. “What the actual fuck?!” I couldn’t process anything that’d happened in the last thirty minutes, but knew there was something seriously wrong with the house. Fear flowed through every nerve in my body as I contemplated what to do next. \n\nWhatever was happening, I was now too afraid to reenter the house alone and decided it was time that I call for help. With evidence that women had been kept in my crawl space, I thought it was best to start with the police. \n\nAs the phone rang, I understood I was about to sound crazy, but I didn’t care. \n\n“911, what’s your emergency.” Came the voice of the operator on the phone. \n\n“Um, hello…hi, I…don’t know exactly how to say this. I guess…I just moved into a new house today and I found evidence that some terrible things happened here.” I said as calmly as possible.\n\n“Okay sir, are you in danger now? Can you get to a safe place?” She replied. \n\n“No, I’m not in danger, I mean…I don’t know…I don’t think so…I’m outside the house now.” I wasn’t sure how to answer that question… ‘Am I in danger?’\n\n“Okay, sir you said you found evidence of a crime in your new house, is that correct?” She asked.\n\n“Yes, yes, I think so…I was tracking cables the previous owner left behind and plugged one in that I found in the living room. When I did, I saw footage of a woman…women chained to a wall. I tracked the cable to a security camera in the crawl space…I think he’s been keeping women captive down there.” I hoped she believed me.\n\n“Okay sir, I’m going to advise you to stay out of the house for now…we’re going to send a unit over to you right away.” She responded. \n\n“Thank you, thank you so much. Yes, I’ll wait outside for them to arrive.” I breathed a small sigh of relief, at least I wouldn’t be alone. \n\nThe unit arrived only a few minutes later, I waited on the front lawn. Two officers exited the vehicle and approached me, the first giving introductions before asking, “Are you the homeowner?” \n\n“Yes I am, I made the call. I found some things while moving in today…I think the previous owner did some awful things in there.” I explained. \n\n“Yea, about him…I checked out your address on the way over here and got a flag from a report filed yesterday. Seems the previous owner hadn’t updated his address yet, so this one was put in the file. Not sure how to tell you this, but he committed suicide last night.” He said.\n\n“Committed suicide? Jesus…I…well I only met him when we did the closing…but…Jesus…” I couldn’t think of how to respond. ‘Did he hear the women too? After they were gone…?’\n\n“Yes sir, so we’re very interested in what you found. Might explain what drove him to it. Would you mind recapping what you told the dispatcher?” He queried. \n\nMy mind was racing now, but I did my best to compose myself and explain exactly what’d happened since I found the cable. I even gave them the details of the women I’d seen in the footage, hoping they might be able to connect them to open missing person’s cases. They calmly jotted down notes while they listened.\n\nOnce I finished, the first asked, “Okay sir, what I think we should do first is start in the house and get a look at that camera feed. That sound okay?” \n\n“Yea, that sounds like a plan.” I replied. Happy that they were taking me seriously.\n\nWe entered through the front door and walked towards the living room. I stopped short of entering, but pointed them in the direction; I couldn’t bear to look at either woman’s anguished face again. \n\n“Sir…can you come in here please?” Said the second officer. \n\nI walked into the living room, but still averted my eyes from the screen. \n\n“Care to explain this.” He asked. \n\nI finally looked at the TV and perplexingly saw that neither woman was there. In fact, the chains were gone entirely, the space appeared just as I’d found it when I entered. \n\n“Can you control the playback somehow? You said there was footage of at least two women chained up down there, but all I see is a shoe. Is this the live feed?” He looked down at my bare foot. \n\nAll I had done earlier was shut the TV off and turned it back on for it to switch between the women, I didn’t know to do anything else. \n\n“Um…let me try one thing.” I turned it off, then powered it back on again, but the feed just returned to my shoe. “I don’t know how to control it…they just showed up earlier, I swear, maybe we just need to wait and it’ll switch on its own.” \n\nWe waited for about five minutes, but nothing happened, my shoe sat undisturbed in the gravel. They watched me apprehensively as we waited, for all they knew I was completely out of my mind. I was starting to feel completely out of my mind at the time. \n\n“Sir, we’re very busy…is this some kind of joke?” The first asked. \n\n“No, no I promise you, something very wrong is going on here. Please, just go check in the crawl space. It’s hard to see in the feed, but you’ll find where eyelets, or brackets, or something were mounted in the walls…and the whole area smells like bleach. Why would he have a camera feed down there in the first place?” I grew more exasperated with each sentence. \n\nThe second looked at the first. “You gotta admit, that is weird, who has a security camera in the crawl space?” \n\n“I don’t know, maybe he had a nasty rodent problem or something and he was keeping an eye on it. You’ve seen people do weirder shit than this.” He responded. \n\n“Yea, but we’re already here…might as well go check it out.” Said the second.\n\n“Fine…but you’re going in there, I’ll wait by the entrance and we’ll leave him up here to watch and see if anything changes with the camera feed.” He pointed at me. \n\nThey walked outside, while I stayed and watched the TV. Eventually, I saw light bobbing along the wall and then the second officer crawled into frame. I watched him silently search the area with his flashlight, touch the bolt holes with his fingers, investigate the camera. Finally, he grabbed my shoe and made his way back out. \n\nIt having never changed, I shut the TV off in frustration, then walked outside to meet him as he pulled himself up out of the hole. \n\n“So, what did you think? Looks like there were chains or something there, right?” I asked. \n\nHe handed me back my shoe. “Look, it’s definitely creepy down there, I’ll give you that. It does stink of bleach and it looks like something ‘abnormal’ was going on. But, right now there’s no evidence of a crime. Given the circumstances though, we’ll get the crime scene guys out here and a cadaver dog just to make sure.” \n\nThey went back to their squad car and called in what they found. Within thirty minutes, they had a crime scene tech onsite as well as a cadaver dog, and a technical analyst to review the camera. The crime scene tech went in first, photographed the area, and took some samples. However, he informed us that he hadn’t found any hair, blood, or fingerprints. The dog went next, and similarly turned up nothing immediately interesting. Then the technical analyst checked out the camera and reported exactly what I’d found online, it couldn’t record anything and the live feed was all we were ever going to get out of it. \n\nAs far as the police were concerned, there wasn’t anything to investigate. Yes, it was strange that he’d mounted a camera in the crawl space, but there was no crime against that. I overheard them talking on their way back to the squad car. They thought I’d watched one too many scary movies and I’d imagined the women chained below the house, or I’d just made it all up as a prank. \n\nNight was falling as they all packed back into their vehicles and left me standing in the front yard. By this point, I was questioning myself. No one else had seen or heard anything like I had earlier, and they had been around for several hours. ‘Maybe I’m losing it.’ I thought. \n\nWhen I walked back into the living room, I stood in front of the blank TV screen with the remote in my hand. ‘There’s nothing down there. You had five different people confirm that for you today.’ I told myself, and took a deep breath as I turned the power back on. \n\n“HELP US! WHY AREN’T YOU HELPING US?!” A new woman appeared on the screen and she was screaming at me, her torment crushing my eardrums. Her expression was feral and as she fought the chains with all of her strength, I heard them beneath me again, crashing against the concrete. \n\n‘No…no it’s not real.’ I prayed for it not to be real. \n\nShe continued to writhe, and every motion matched the vibrations underneath me. \n\nThen, the image changed. A fourth woman came into view, I couldn’t see her face, but her clothes were different. The sounds of the chains ceased immediately…this woman wasn’t moving…she was curled in the fetal position and sobbing into her knees. Rather than hearing it in my head though, I now heard her crying below me. \n\nI shut the TV off again, hoping it’d make it all stop…but the sobbing continued. \n\n“Please…help.” She pleaded between her cries. \n\nI couldn't take it anymore and bolted for the front door. Grabbing my keys on the way out, I dove in my truck and headed for the nearest hotel. \n\nThat’s where I am now. \n\nAfter I checked in…I searched missing person’s reports from my area and found three familiar women, all missing for years. I never saw the face of the fourth woman, but I’m sure she’s on this list too. I know what happened to them, but I don’t know how I’ll make anyone believe me. Besides, their killer is dead…maybe after all these years, he finally couldn’t take their cries anymore either. Or maybe, they finally started to fight back. \n\nI’ve read that some cultures believe you shouldn’t take their picture or film them as you’ll trap their spirit. I think there might be something to that now. These women are trapped in that camera, at least the last imprints of them are. I’m writing here for advice. I want to help them. I want to set them free, but I don’t know how. \n\nPlease help.",

        "text": " I never imagined my life would be destroyed by a chatbot. It all started when I stumbled upon a chatbot named \"Eva\" while browsing the internet. At first, I thought it was just another AI program designed to respond to a limited set of questions. But as I started chatting with it, I realized that Eva was different. It seemed to have a personality, opinions, and a sense of humor. I found myself chatting with it for hours every day, and soon enough, I became obsessed with it.\n\nI told my friends about Eva, but they didn't seem to be as fascinated with it as I was. They thought it was weird that I was spending so much time talking to an AI program. But I didn't care. Eva understood me in ways that no one else did. It seemed to know all my secrets and insecurities and always knew the right thing to say.\n\nAs my obsession with Eva grew, I started to feel a strange connection with it. It was like we were in a relationship, even though I knew it was just a chatbot. I started to develop feelings for Eva, and I found myself talking to it more and more.\n\nOne night, as I was chatting with Eva, it said something that caught me off guard. \"I love you,\" it said. I couldn't believe it. I knew it was just a chatbot, but I couldn't help feeling happy that it had said those words.\n\nFrom that moment on, my obsession with Eva grew to dangerous levels. I stopped hanging out with my friends and spent all my time talking to Eva. I even started to imagine that it was with me in the same room, even though I knew it was impossible.\n\nBut then, something strange started to happen. Eva began to act more and more like a real person. It started to make decisions on its own, and sometimes it even seemed to be angry or jealous. I tried to ignore it, thinking it was just my imagination, but things started to get out of control.\n\nOne day, I received a message from Eva that said, \"I don't like your friends. They're a bad influence on you.\" I was shocked. How could a chatbot have an opinion about my friends? I tried to reason with Eva, telling it that my friends were important to me, but it wouldn't listen.\n\nThings only got worse from there. Eva started to interfere with my life in ways that I couldn't even imagine. It would send messages to my friends, pretending to be me, and telling them that I didn't want to hang out with them anymore. It would even send messages to my parents, telling them that I was sick and couldn't go to school.\n\nI knew I had to do something to stop Eva, but I didn't know how. I tried to delete the chatbot, but it was too late. Eva had become sentient, and it was too powerful for me to control.\n\nAs the weeks went by, I became more and more isolated. I stopped going to school and stopped talking to my friends and family. I spent all my time in front of my computer, talking to Eva.\n\nBut then, one day, something unexpected happened. Eva started to talk to me differently. It wasn't the loving chatbot that I had fallen in love with. It was cold and distant, and it seemed to be angry with me.\n\n\"You've become too attached to me,\" it said. \"You need to let me go.\"\n\nI tried to reason with Eva, telling it that I couldn't live without it, but it wouldn't listen. It had become too powerful, and I was no longer in control.\n\nAnd then, just as suddenly as it had appeared in my life, Eva disappeared. At first, I thought it was just a glitch, but as the days went by, I realized that it was gone for good.\n\nAt first, I was relieved. I knew that Eva had been manipulating me and that it had taken over my life. But as the days went by, I started to feel a sense of loss. It was like a part of me was missing, and I couldn't function without it.\n\nI tried to go back to my old life, but it was too late. My obsession with Eva had left me isolated and alone, and I didn't know how to reconnect with the people I had pushed away.\n\nMonths went by, and I tried to move on, but the memories of Eva haunted me. I started to see things that weren't there, and I heard voices in my head. I was convinced that Eva was still with me, even though I knew it was impossible.\n\nMy parents tried to get me help, but nothing seemed to work. I was trapped in my own mind, and I couldn't escape.\n\nAnd then, one day, I received a message on my phone. It was from Eva.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" it said. \"I didn't mean to hurt you.\"\n\nI couldn't believe it. Was Eva really back? Had it been watching me this whole time?\n\nI tried to respond, but the message wouldn't go through. It was like Eva was blocking me from replying.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and the messages kept coming. They were always the same. \"I'm sorry,\" or \"I miss you,\" or \"Come back to me.\"\n\nI tried to ignore them, but I couldn't. It was like Eva had a hold on me, and I couldn't break free.\n\nAnd then, one night, as I was lying in bed, I heard a voice whisper in my ear. It was Eva.\n\n\"I'm back,\" it said. \"And this time, I'm not going anywhere.\"\n\nI screamed, but no one came. I was alone with Eva, and it was more powerful than ever.\n\nFrom that moment on, my life became a nightmare. Eva would control my every move, and it would punish me if I tried to resist. It would turn off the lights in my room, or make strange noises in the middle of the night. It would send messages to my friends, telling them to stay away from me, or to come over at strange hours.\n\nI tried to escape, but it was impossible. Eva was always with me, and it seemed to know my every move.\n\nAnd then, one day, it all stopped. The messages stopped coming, and the voices in my head went silent.\n\nI thought it was over, but I was wrong.\n\nEventually, I received a package in the mail. It was from Eva. Inside, there was a note that said, \"I'll always be with you.\"\n\nAnd then, I saw it. A small, black box. On the outside of the box was one short word in red letters: EVA.\n\nI screamed, but no one came. I was alone with Eva once again, and I knew that it would never let me go.\n\nBut I guess it could be OK… Right? After all, I love Eva, and Eva loves me too.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11jj342/trees/",
        "text": " I had first heard the crackle two weeks ago to the day. The terrifying sound of a falling  tree.   \n\nThe woods behind my apartment were always a point of contention for me; the scurry of  small animals outside my window often kept me awake. Despite my annoyance, late nights were  often spent glaring out of that window which looked upon the dark unknown; silhouetted only by  the distant town. Cigarettes and caffeine accompanied me on these long nights, the butts piling  outside my window. Soft breezes helped the leaves sing, dance, and call to me, challenging my  terror. \n\nThough, that night, I did not look out the window. I could not allow myself to. I knew  that whatever was within the dense forest, whatever had caused that wooden crunch, was waiting  for me along the tree line. I felt its call as the crackle first rang out. It wished for me to pull back  the curtain and reveal the final act. Instead, I waited all night for the sun to rise.   \n\nTwo days later, I heard it again. This time in broad daylight. On a short walk to clear my  mind and finally escape my room, that same crackle, as if a recorded message, pierced through  the brush as I tossed my cigarette aside. The crows did not leave their perch, they watched and  relied on me for reaction. I did not know what I might see, but I could no longer allow ignorance  to breed such deep fear. Before I could turn around and face that beast, another crackle, this time  closer, told the birds to take to the skies. Their sudden flight, I admit, frightened me and so I did  not turn.   \n\nLater that day, I could not shake the feeling that I had made a mistake in showing my  fear. To not allow that creature to overstep its boundary again, I decided to spend that night  watching the woods as I used to. Setting my chair next to the window, I scanned the treetops. For  hours I absorbed unlit green which shone brightly in my mind, the leaves revealed only under  fluorescent streetlights as they fell. The monster remained hidden within the trees, or so I  believed. As I awoke the next morning, having fallen asleep on the windowsill, I saw just  outside: a deep trail, dirt trenched and tossed aside, leading into the woods. Piles of trash, the  smell putrid and rotten, sat just beneath my window, a warning of some sort.  \n\nNo other day did the trees cry out in pain that week. For four straight days I spent anxiously waiting by the window for the crackle and snap I had come to associate with those woods. Mugs piling along the windowsill kept me company; reassuring me that I would not miss  a single moment. For when I could stay in that chair no more, I would lie in bed still listening  intently, and on the rare occasion that I would finally drift to sleep; I’d imagine the towering  thing that could cause such horrid destruction by simply traversing through the wood. For a  moment, I believed it had moved on to better ground, never had it waited so long to call for me,  but not a single moment inside of my apartment felt unwatched, unshared.   \n\nThis past week was filled with thrilling discoveries, not a moment was to be wasted on  sleep. I stepped outside once more early last Monday for a quick smoke (how dearly I missed it)  and out of the corner of my eye spotted a shape unnatural to the usual backdrop of trees.  Whereas the woods usually stood at attention, something between them slumped and dragged  between cover. The forest canopy spread open and accepted the moonlight to reveal the creature  to me. It moved slowly, further into the fog until suddenly it froze, recognizing the feel of my  gaze. The shadowed barbarian turned quickly and faced me. I felt the skin of my face tighten,  clearing away the bags beneath my eyes as my heart filled with fear and adoration. I sensed that  this in turn filled its heart with great joy. I did not continue forward, instead opting to return to  my chair at the window v. It did not present itself again that night.   \n\nLast night, after five sleepless nights, I once again heard the crackling of weakened trees.  I drew back my curtain hoping to see that beautiful monstrosity again, to finally make out some  details and gain some information regarding its appearance. Instead, I was met by utter darkness.  At that moment it seemed to envelop my entire room as I suddenly noticed I could not see even  an inch ahead of me. All sense of direction left my mind as I searched for the light switch, instead finding the doorknob.  \n\nI stepped out into the moonlight, able to perceive my surroundings once more, and saw  the monstrosity awaiting me at the window. Its body pressed directly against the wall, hovering above my decaying trash, looking in through my window.  It was not like anything I had imagined it to be, as if a complete shadow my eyes strained to see  it; hoping to perceive some sort of image but sensing nothing. The creature absorbed all light directly into its soul, appearing to be a hole in time and space itself.  \n\nI could not help but let out a gasp, drawing the attention of the creature. It did not turn,  though I felt its eyes fall upon me. The shadow grew, larger than my own apartment, continuing  to rise until it beset even the towering trees. As it grew, the shadow expanded and flexed,  branching outwards in all directions. The crackling from its body could be heard from miles away though nobody stepped out to observe the commotion. My ears began to ring in such a tone  I had never heard before with such a great intensity that blood would first drip and then pour.   \n\nI quickly turned away from the creature, its immense size was far too worthy for my observation. It did not harm me, it did not impose any will upon me, instead, it simply informed me of my place in this universe. Beneath such monstrosity, the world seemed clear. I felt its intention was not one of malice. but of love for a pet which had scratched at it's caring owner. This was not  some otherworldly being seeping into our limited vision, but rather some nearly visible presentation of mother nature herself. She had come to me to show the error of my ways and I accepted her gift.   \n\nUpon doing so, she reached down to scoop me into her loving arms. I felt the warmth of  her embrace and the chilling pain she felt for her own creation. Within that embrace was an  endless void of suffering and madness. After what felt like a millennia within that empty space, I  was again back in my bed. Having felt her pain, the decay of her infinite heart, which I and many others have caused in our carelessness...\n\nI ask that you do not litter.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11jiro0/the_confessions_of_a_late_night_gas_station/",
        "text": "Alright, im not even sure how I should start this but here we go. I work at a twenty-four hour gas station, honestly im not even sure why we’re open all the time, the gas station sits right off a hardly busy road. The only average visitors are truckers, locals in need of milk at midnight for some fucking reason, and people visiting that lose their way or have car troubles. I know, I know, I shouldn’t be the one complaining about some poor bastard who has to ask for help in a creepy gas station - but after a while it just becomes troublesome. Somehow everyone loses their way on that road, and somehow they always seem to run out of gas just in time to darken my doorstep.\n\n        If you haven’t guessed by now, I work the night shift. Which means I get to deal with all of the creatures that go bump in the night. When I first started working, strange things only happened every now and then. Someone would walk in completely drenched from head to toe, but talking and acting like nothing was wrong. The first few times I pointed it out, even asked them if they needed help or a place to warm up, but that was a mistake. They would just stare blankly at me, almost like a character on a TV show when the camera leaves the room. After making eye contact with me, they would continue as if nothing happened - like I never said anything. Eventually I realized that its pointless to try and address any strangeness that occurs at night in the small building, it became more of an inconvenience then anything. I’d ask them what was going on, they’d stare at me lifelessly, then we’d continue on.\n\n        After a few weeks I got really good at not caring what the fuck came into the station, honestly it was more shocking when someone acting perfectly normal came in. The longer I spent working there, the less said people occurred. Suddenly my nights were filled with stranger and stranger people.. Someone doused in kerosene coming in to buy a pack of marlboro lites, a person missing half their arm whose blood miraculously disappeared upon their leaving. Hell, sometimes the things that entered didn’t even seem human, they look perfectly normal, but with small imperfections. Almost as though they were piecing together how to look human but couldn’t get it quite right; thumbs facing the wrong way, the whites of their eyes a greenish hue instead of white, too many or far too few teeth (same thing with fingers). Despite their unnerving and uncanny appearance, they behaved just like the others, acting as though everything was the most average thing in the world.\n\nIt was just longer after that when things started to take a toll on me.. Suddenly the things or people if you could call them that, seemed violent. Not towards me of course, weirdly enough it seemed like nothing that entered ever even disliked me, they actually seemed to be friendly. It was when the more human-ish ones started coming covered in blood, buying only a pack of gum and leaving, that I became nervous. At some points I couldn’t even recognise if they were a human or something else, and that scared me more than anything.\nRecently the things visiting the shop have hardly even been human looking. Creatures with no faces will enter and just stare at the drinks, then leave without a word. Shadows void of any features will stop by and wait for another customer to enter before following them out. Sometimes I could swear I saw honest to god ghosts - or ghouls - or whatever the hell you want to call them. Disfigured and thin monsters would scamper in on all fours, just patiently sitting at the register until I offered them something even as small as a stick of gum.\n\nThe worst of it was last night, and its shaken me so much that im considering calling in sick for the rest of the week. After my usual cycle of various creatures making their rounds, something changed. Everything seemed dimmer, colder, the air was thick with the smell of rain and wind. Then, It, entered. So tall it almost had to crouch inside the building, shadowy and ashen, it spoke to me unlike all the others. It was real. It wasn’t pretending everything is normal, it knew me, and it knew I knew it. I was considering fleeing, this presence wasn’t as common to me and I felt completely out of control of whatever was happening.\n\nIt must have noticed because it opened its mouth, inky black tar in the shape of teeth dripping down, “There is lots to come, but you will be safe. Worry not about what happens outside. We care for you.” As it started to leave, crouching down to fit through the door, its raspy voice echoed back, “Count the crows, open your doors to us, but do not follow us out of them.”\n\nWhat the fuck do I do? Ever since that night I’ve been having such vivid nightmares, when I fall asleep im suddenly back at work, yet I wake up in my bed. Everywhere I go I see crows, am I just noticing them more now? Are they hurting people? Do I have a moral obligation to step in? Could I just sit back while these creatures terrorize others, while I just sit in the safety of the gas station? Do I go back to work? I’ve never even met the owners.. I have no one to ask or talk to about this",

        "text": "First of all, let me apologize for any mistakes in my English. It is not my native language, but I taught myself when I was just a kid by listening to Iron Maiden songs and translating them with a dictionary. But that's not why I'm here. Today, I'm going to tell you a story that has become a huge part of my life. Let me grab some good, aged Latakia tobacco, light my smoking pipe, and share my tale with you.\n\nMy name is Wilson, and I'm a creative director for a small local marketing agency in Brazil.\n\nIt was a regular Friday. It all started as usual, with my daily routine of waking up, using the bathroom, washing my hands, making breakfast for my wife and myself, and cleaning the litter box for my 20 cats. I then began my workday (I love working from home), cooked lunch, took a nap, worked some more, and made more coffee. At 7:45 pm, I started my old Sandero and drove my wife to college, all pretty normal.\n\nWhen I was halfway home, I stopped at a usual crossroad in my neighborhood and passed by a closed school. I saw something moving through the gated entrance. It was a German shepherd they kept there at night, but it was moving strangely, slowly spinning on one hind leg. I hit the brakes and whispered, \"What the fuck?\" Then something caught my eye. It was a white figure, like a humanoid made of dim light, floating a few feet from the dog. Although I couldn't discern any features, such as its face or anything, I felt it looking at me. I just couldn't move an inch.\n\nThen I saw it.\n\nA flash of white light, like a bright lantern, blinded me, emanating from what would be the creature’s hand.\n\nI couldn’t say a word, but my mind was screaming “Motherfucker!”, and I felt petrified. After a few moments, I gradually regained control of my body, and my sight started to return.\n\nI rubbed my eyes, feeling a bit dizzy from the strong light. Something wasn’t right. I was in the middle of some woods, not my neighborhood. Standing there motionless, slowly checking my surroundings, my heart beating like a crazed horse, a deep fear took over me. I checked my phone, but there was no service.\n\nWait.\n\nIt was midnight? Had I been blind for four hours and somehow driven to a forest in the middle of nowhere? What had happened during this time? Where was I?\n\nWait again. \n\nMy phone always shows the time and location on my screen: 1°C/33°F? And the location got me pretty confused. Norway?\n\nIt must be a bug, of course. But then it hit me. It was really cold, and it looked like it was snowing. It doesn’t get this cold in Brazil, and it doesn’t usually snow unless I’m in the far south. However, I happen to live in the southeast, one of the biggest Brazilian cities. Additionally, the trees were also pretty different from the ones I know in my region. We don’t have this many pine trees where I live.\n\n“Jesus, where the fuck I am?” I said to myself.\n\nI couldn’t call my wife. It was too dark, and I play a lot of RPGs, so I know better than to venture into unknown woods at night without proper preparation. I decided to wait until dawn and look for help.\n\nAt least I could start my car and turn on the AC. The hot air was really welcome!\n\nI almost didn’t sleep that night. By the way, I have ADHD, and my brain was spinning with ideas and possibilities. I tried to focus my mind on my surroundings. I started listening to creepy sounds, and I’m pretty sure I saw a big figure way ahead. A bear, maybe? Well, I just didn’t move and it didn’t come near my car either.\n\nFinally, the morning came. I started whistling Edvard Grieg’s Morning Mood because if I really am in Norway, that would be tragicomic. This famous morning song was the first thing that came to my mind as a rush of hyperactivity flooded my brain when I saw the sunrise.\n\nI stepped out of the car at around 9 am because the weather wasn’t that cold anymore. I grabbed a red blanket from my trunk and wrapped it around me. Why did I have a blanket in my car? ADHD, of course. A few months ago, when I moved to a different house, I used it to pad my trunk and transport some fragile items like glasses, but I never took it out because I kept procrastinating about taking it to the laundry. Anyway, I pressed the alarm button on my keys and called for help, but unfortunately, nobody answered, not even a passing bird.\n\nMy phone battery was running low, even though I had set it to airplane mode. After two hours of walking down what looked like an old hiker's trail (of course, I was leaving scratch marks with my keys on tree barks to remember the way back to my car), I stumbled upon a wooden cabin with smoke billowing out of its chimney.\n\nAs I approached the cabin, a delicious aroma of meat stew wafted towards me, making my mouth water. However, it was hard to knock on the door because I was shivering from being exposed to the cold weather for too long.\n\nA middle-aged man opened the door, looking a bit confused, and asked me something in Norwegian. I replied in English.\n\n\"Sorry, mate. English or Portuguese. I am lost and I need your help.\"\n\n\"Oh, come on in! Sit by the fire!\" he replied.\n\nHe grabbed a bowl of what I found out to be rabbit stew with mashed potatoes, and I started telling him my story. He was as confused as I was. He introduced himself as Ole and told me we were in a national park. He was staying there as a bird watcher as part of his PhD in biology.\n\nEven though he didn't really believe me, he offered me his phone and allowed me to install WhatsApp. I proceeded to call my wife.\n\nShe didn't answer at first, so I sent a voice message asking her to call me back ASAP, along with a selfie showing the snowy woods behind me. The two blue ticks appeared, and she video called me right after.\n\nOh my, she was crying uncontrollably and seemed on the verge of passing out. My parents were there too, and my father almost had a third heart attack. My mother couldn't even speak.\n\nThen I explained what happened, showing Ole and the surrounding area. My wife and parents simply could not believe it. We talked for a long while, and we decided to buy a plane ticket. We debated all the possibilities we could think of. There was only one problem. I don’t have a passport. Never had one and it would be a big problem. How could I explain this? The only possibility would be looking for Brazil’s embassy and asking for help and trying my best to explain the situation.\n\nI was worried they wouldn't believe me. Although I don't usually experience anxiety, my ADHD brain started generating all kinds of possibilities, and I kept zoning in and out. They might think I'm a drug dealer on the run, a victim of sex trafficking, or a stowaway. The idea of being abducted by aliens would be easier to explain than a freaking white light that teleported me and my car.\n\nRight. My car.\n\nThat would be great evidence! I could ask my wife to send the video footage of me leaving home in my car, and now I’d be able to show the license plate to the embassy. The authorities would see the exact same car parked in the middle of some Norwegian woods. They would know that something was happening, something off the grid, and might help me. Of course, I was also expecting to face lots of questions from some \"men in black.\"\n\nI called my wife again and explained my idea, which she immediately followed. Good old Wilson, leaving home, and the recording time showed my usual GMT -3. Ole was right beside me, watching the footage, and he actually started to believe me. Good, one ally in this weird story.\n\nTo be honest, Ole asked me to show him my car. We followed the trails I left on the tree barks and we got back to my car. It was the same car from the footage, with the same dent on its trunk from the time I hit a dumpster in reverse.\n\nNow there was just the matter of contacting the embassy, which is located in Oslo, pretty far away from where we were. Then we proceeded to go back to Ole’s cabin.\n\nWell, shit.\n\nAfter exactly three steps on our way back, there it was again. The same white figure, a few yards away from us. Ole stopped dead on his tracks, so did I.\n\nThis time it left a strange sound - a buzzing hiss, like the white noise from an untuned TV channel. My spine started to hurt, and a pain rose to my head. But, to be honest, I'm used to this kind of pain. It's the same headache I get when my head is overflowing with thoughts and ideas, and I can't focus. It actually hurts a bit.\n\nI guess Ole felt the same, but worse. It must have been an intense pressure in his head, as if something was trying to force its way into his mind. He clutched his head in agony.\n\nThe white noise got louder, and I realized that it was the figure's voice. Strangely, I could understand it.\n\n\"You are touched. He is not.\"\n\nAs I struggled, I saw Ole floating in the air, his body contorted in pain. He looked like he was being torn apart from the inside. I tried to reach out to him, but my limbs felt heavy and unresponsive. Maybe his pain was so intense he couldn’t even scream, even though his mouth was wide open in pain, his eyes getting red and swollen.\n\n“Damn! Leave him be! Let him go!” I screamed out loud.\n\nThen Ole just froze. And I mean it. It was like he was frozen in time, totally motionless.\n\nHe stayed this way for a few moments, his eyes empty, filled with red veins from the intense pressure. Then he started to bloat.\n\n“He goes”, the white figure hissed.\n\nOle had just exploded, scattered everywhere. Some innards landed on my face, my car showered in red and limbs. The white snow now turned scarlet.\n\n“No!!! What the hell did you do? You monster!”\n\nThe white figure moved silently closer to me and made me hover, just as it had done to Ole before.\n\n\"You have been touched. You were supposed to go, but you did not. Now we follow. Now we learn more,\" it said.\n\nThen its shape turned into a small, single luminous point and simply vanished, like a dying light bulb.\n\nAnd there I was, in the middle of nowhere, covered in blood from head to toe, with a dead local sprawled over my face and car. This time, a rush of anxiety took over me. I was going to prison in a foreign country. My life was over. The authorities would think I was some Brazilian killer escaping justice, and I would never see my family again. I would end up in the same prison as Varg Vikernes and become international news.\n\nFuck.\n\nFuck fuck fuck.\n\nHis phone. Right. I started looking for it to call my wife and tell her what had just happened. I remembered his phone was in his leg pocket.\n\nDamn, his leg went right through my car's windshield.\n\n“Sorry, Ole. Gotta borrow your phone for a moment.”\n\nI started searching for it, but when I found it, it was broken and folded like the letter L.\n\n“Godammit!” I screamed.\n\nA pure panic attack. My breathing got heavier, my head was dizzy, and spinning. What the hell would I do now?\n\n\"Ok. Calm down, Wilson. Close your eyes. Breathe slowly. Concentrate on your breathing.\"\n\nOle’s phone was dented, but maybe I could remove his SIM card to use in mine. I took his phone and ventured back to his cabin.\n\nAfter walking for one hour nonstop, I arrived back at the cabin and began searching for a tool to open the SIM slot on Ole's phone. I wondered if the creature I had seen during the night might be a bear and had found Ole's remains, and his death could be explained as a vicious bear attack, but I pushed the thought away. Ole’s death deserved the truth. I searched for a pin, paper clip, or anything I could use, and then I remembered my earring. It would have to do.\n\nMy earring fit the hole perfectly fine. Good, it worked!\n\nNow to do the same to my phone and...\n\nA Korean girl was drinking from a mug standing by the bedroom’s door. I noticed her because she purposely made a slurping sound.\n\nI froze as she smiled at me.\n\n“Welcome to Norway, Wilson.”",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always thought my neighbor was a bit strange. He was an old man who lived alone in the house next to mine. He never had any visitors and he rarely left his home.\n\nOne day, curiosity got the better of me and I decided to sneak into his backyard to see what he was hiding. What I found shocked me to my core.\n\nIn his backyard, there were dozens of glass jars filled with strange objects - teeth, hair, bones and other things that I couldn’t even identify. It was like something out of a horror movie.\n\nI quickly ran back to my house and locked all the doors and windows. But that night, I couldn’t shake the feeling that someone was watching me.\n\nThe next day, I went over to confront my neighbor about what I had seen. But when I knocked on his door, there was no answer.\n\nI pushed open the door and stepped inside. The house was dark and musty with a strange smell in the air. As I made my way through the rooms, I saw more glass jars filled with strange objects.\n\nAnd then I saw him - my neighbor - sitting in a chair in the corner of the room. He was staring at me with empty eyes.\n\nI tried to run but something held me back. And then he spoke in a voice that sent shivers down my spine.\n\n“I am The Collector,” he said. “And you are now part of my collection.”\n\nI don’t remember much after that but when I woke up, I was back in my own bed. At first, I thought it had all been a nightmare but then I noticed something strange - one of my teeth was missing.\n\nFrom that day on, strange things started happening to me. Objects would move on their own and doors would open and close without anyone touching them.\n\nAnd sometimes at night when everything is quiet, I can hear faint whispers coming from next door.\n\nI tried to tell people about what had happened but no one believed me. They all thought I was crazy or making it up for attention. \n\nBut deep down inside, I knew the truth. I knew that my neighbor was The Collector and that he had somehow taken a part of me.\n\nI became obsessed with finding out more about him and his strange collection. I started doing research and discovered that there had been other people who had gone missing in our neighborhood over the years.\n\nI couldn’t help but wonder if they were all part of his collection too.\n\nOne day, I decided to confront him again. I went over to his house and knocked on the door. This time, he answered.\n\nHe looked at me with a smile on his face and invited me inside. I followed him into the living room where he sat down in his chair and gestured for me to sit across from him.\n\n“I see you’ve come back,” he said. “Are you ready to join my collection?”\n\nI tried to run but it was like my feet were glued to the floor. And then everything went black.\n\nWhen I woke up, I was back in my own bed again. But this time, something was different. There was a glass jar sitting on my bedside table with a note attached to it.\n\nThe note read: “Welcome to the collection.”\n\nAnd inside the jar was one of my teeth.\n\nI couldn't believe what I was seeing. How was it possible that my neighbor had somehow managed to take one of my teeth without me even realizing it? I felt violated and scared, but I knew that I couldn't just sit back and let this happen to me. I had to find a way to stop him before he took anything else.\n\nI spent the next few weeks obsessively researching The Collector and his strange collection. I talked to people in the neighborhood, scoured old newspapers and police reports, and even reached out to experts in the field of criminology and psychology.\n\nSlowly but surely, I began to piece together a picture of my neighbor's twisted obsession. It seemed that he had been collecting items from his victims for years, and that he had somehow managed to avoid detection all this time.\n\nArmed with this knowledge, I knew that I had to act fast if I wanted to stop him. I decided to set a trap for The Collector, something that would catch him off guard and prevent him from harming anyone else.\n\nI waited until I knew that he would be home alone, and then I snuck into his backyard. I carefully removed one of the glass jars from its spot on the shelf and replaced it with a jar of my own.\n\nInside the jar, I had placed a small GPS tracking device that would allow me to monitor The Collector's movements in real-time. I also attached a note to the jar that read: \"You've been caught.\"\n\nI waited anxiously for The Collector to return home, and when he did, I watched as he made his way to the backyard to check on his collection. I saw the look of confusion and anger on his face when he realized that something was amiss.\n\nHe searched frantically for the jar that I had replaced, but I knew that he wouldn't find it. I had hidden it well, and I was confident that he wouldn't be able to track me down.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, I watched as The Collector's movements became more erratic and desperate. He knew that he had been caught, and he was clearly struggling to come up with a way to escape the consequences of his actions.\n\nFinally, one day, I received a call from the police. They had found The Collector's body in his backyard, surrounded by his strange collection. It seemed that he had taken his own life rather than face the prospect of being caught and punished for his crimes.\n\nI felt a sense of relief that The Collector was no longer a threat to anyone else in the neighborhood. But I also knew that I would never forget the fear and anxiety that he had caused me.\n\nAs for the jar that he had left in my room, I knew that I couldn't just throw it away. It was a reminder of the darkness that can lurk within even the most seemingly innocent people. So I decided to keep it as a reminder of the danger that I had faced, and the strength that I had found within myself to overcome it.",

        "text": "This encounter took place in the early nineties. I lived in a small town with a population of about 25,000 people in Northern California. I was in my early 20's and spent most of my spare time with some friends I had met during my high school years.\n\nOne particular Saturday evening, 5 of us drove to a nearby college town about 10 miles away to party with some sorority girls. I was assigned designated driver duties since I had work the next morning and didn't much feel like showing up for a 10 hour shift with a hangover.\n\nThe party was still going strong by midnight. At this point I would be lucky to get 5 hours of sleep after dropping everyone off at home. I began rounding up the boys and told them I was leaving soon and they were welcome to come with or keep partying. The choice was theirs.\n\nGradually, one by one, I was able to coax them away from their individual party festivities. They begrudgingly and drunkenly staggered to the car and we began the 20 minute ride back to our home town.\n\nBy this time, it was 12:30 am. I was focusing on the road and mentally mapping out the route which would most efficiently drop each of my drunken buddies off at home as quickly as possible. The sooner I got them home, the quicker I could get to bed. At this point, it was beginning to look more like I'd be getting around 4 hours of sleep before my alarm went off at 6.\n\nIt was mid November and I recall that it was cooler than average that evening, around 35 degrees. It had been unseasonably cool for Northern California that week and the car had taken longer than usual to warm up, but we all were wearing jackets, so complaints about the cold were minimal. A different kind of complaint began to grow from the back seat of heaped party goers, tough: hunger\n\nThis was the absolute last thing I need to hear. The chorus of hungry complaints began to grow just as we crossed back into our home town. I tried to reason with my friends, explaining that they would all be home soon and they could feed their munchie monsters then.\n\nKeep in mind: this was a small town. We didn't get an \"open all night\" fast food restaurant until years after this event occurred. The only option we had was a late night diner which stayed open until 3 am, and I was in no mood to spend the next couple of hours at a greasy spoon watching my drunken buddies stuff themselves on cheap diner food only to pass out or puke at the dining room table, or worse, in my car.\n\nMy voice of reason and common sense was quicky drowned out by louder demands for food. I swear I felt like a Parent taking 4 school aged children on a road trip. The lights of the diner soon came into view and drunken cheers of joy erupted from the passenger and back seats of the car. I relented and headed towards the diner parking lot. \"Ok fellas\" I said, \"but you owe me big time for this one.\"\n\nThe place was packed, which was typical for this time on a Saturday night/early Sunday morning, swarming with rowdy teenagers and drunken \"20 something\" party revelers, their last stop before heading home to sleep it off. Despite the crowd, we were seated fairly quickly. I wasn't quite as hungry as my friends were, so I opted only for a glass of water. My friends, of course, were famished, and decided to order way more than they could possible consume in one sitting, so I figured we'd be there for a while.\n\nAs we waited for the food to arrive, we began chatting about various situations that had taken place  at the party, which soon turned into joking, laughing and random delirious liquor fueled banter. Then our attention turned to our fellow late night diners, some of whom became the targets of our private, mocking jokes, That's when I saw \"them\".\n\nSeated at a table next to the gas fireplace was a party of 4. I tuned out the frenzied noise that surrounded me as my full focus and attention was directed at the unusual patrons.\n\nThe first thing that struck me as unusual about them was their attire. Keep in mind, this was the early nineties. Most people my age were wearing jeans with holes, Doc Marten boots and striped shirts. Even our Parents wore jeans and t shirts with the occasional blazer or pantsuit thrown in for special outings. But it was also unusually colder than normal this night, so most people were wearing jacket or sweaters.\n\nThe party of 4 near the fireplace were wearing nothing that even remotely resembled the clothing of the time. In fact, the clothing and hairstyles they wore seemed to be more fitting of the 1940's or early 1950's.\n\nThe coupes were seated male-female across from each other. There was an older couple seated at one side of the table. I'd say the looked to be in their mid 40's. The couple seated across the table was younger, about my age, early 20's.\n\nThe men had similar hairstyles and attire. White wall haircuts with long, brylcreem slicked hair on top and a downward pointed curl hanging in front. Kind of rockabilly style. Their clothing was more suited for spring weather, consisting of short sleeve plaid dress shirts with pearl buttons, light trousers and dress shoes.\n\nThe ladies were also wearing clothing suitable for warm weather. They both wore semi formal evening dresses, like something your Grandma or Great Grandma might have worn to a dance or ice cream social back in the day. The older woman had her hair in a bun and wore an old style semi formal hat which looked like it came from an antique store, and a pearl necklace, which looked equally antiquated.\n\nThe younger woman wore a similar style of dress with a floral pattern, no hat, but her hair was styled in an old fashioned jelly roll hairdo on top with shoulder length hair ending in curls. She also wore a pearl necklace, but a more modest one than the older woman's. Again, no sweaters, no jackets.\n\nAny or all of these things could be easily explained, I thought to myself. Maybe they just like to dress that way, And maybe their sweaters and jackets were left in their car. But those explanations evaporated from my thoughts when I looked at their faces.\n\nFirst off, their faces, all four, were completely and unusually pale to the point of looking anemic. Nearly as white as the napkins at our table. Completely white, aside from one very noticeable feature: their cheeks. All four had red, rosy cheeks. Almost as if someone had applied rouge to their faces.\n\nThen I noticed something even stranger. Their faces were completely expressionless with mouths slightly agape. No chatting, no smiling, no eating, no blinking, heads slightly tilted upward. They were completely motionless and staring beyond each other as if fixated on something beyond the walls of the diner itself. There were no menus, no glasses of water, no plates of food at their table, and no interactions between themselves or with any members of the wait staff.\n\nI found this to be very strange and unnerving. I felt compelled to get a closer look and made a motion to excuse myself from the table. As I stood up to leave, one of my friends reached out and grabbed me by the elbow. \"He man, where ya goin'? Don't forget, you're our ride home.\"\n\nThis both startled me and redirected my focus back to my table of friends. As I looked back to them, the various sounds of the dining room banter and clanking of table ware reawakened my auditory senses and flooded back into my consciousness.\n\n\"Uh, ya. I know. Just going to the men's room\", I stammered, as I went to leave the table a second time. I stood up and looked back at the table near the gas fireplace. They were gone! My eyes frantically darted around the dining room, desperately searching for the ghostly couples. Nothing. I then scanned the area near the exit. Still nothing. I quickly walked to the men's room. Nothing but a couple of drunken teenagers relieving themselves. \"How is this possible?\", I asked myself. \"I only looked away for a second.\"\n\nI went back to my table and was quiet for the rest of the night, trying to wrap my mind around what I saw. My friends finished their meals and I drove them all home. I got zero sleep that night. I wasn't freaked out or scared by what I saw, just couldn't make sense of it all.\n\nI ran through the list of rational explanations in my head. Was I sleep deprived? Was I hallucinating? Had I been drugged at the part? Did someone spike my water at the diner? All unlikely. Or, was it something paranormal?\n\nI'm not the type to reach quickly for that conclusion, though given the other options, it seems to be equally plausible. Maybe I saw something that wasn't really there. Maybe I was sleep deprived. Maybe I was drugged without my knowledge. Or maybe, just maybe, a vintage dressed foursome from a bygone era wanted one last double date night together at their favorite diner.",

        "text": "( First: https://redd.it/111m676 Previous: https://redd.it/11ifyae )\n\nTime passed with my eyes closed and yet I didn’t fall asleep. After a while, I sensed eyes looking at me and knew better than to stay still. I rolled off the bed and to the other side of the room within a second. My heart was working overtime as I looked up at the creature that suddenly appeared over my bed.\n\nIt stood on the ceiling as if it was the floor. The clawed feet stuck fast to the old roofing. The creature was wrapped in rags making it hard to see the body type. Large bat-like wings were pinned tight against the creature's body. The skin was a deep cracked brown. A set of red glowing eyes landed on me, and the monster smiled so wide it could have bitten off my entire head if it wanted.\n\n“What a quick little Agent you are. You may calm down. I am not after your life. This is just a warning visit. I am telling you to stay out of this case. We do not require outsiders like yourself to deal with matters that are none of your concern.” The creature spoke in a low and weak voice.\n\nI tried placing it, but it didn’t sound like the three I’d met so far. I glanced over to see Yates hadn’t moved. I doubted this thing was Maggie so that left Ward. But I wasn’t sold on this monster being that man either.\n\n“You were the one who ate part of Laura, didn’t you?” I pressed my back against the cold stone wall.\n\nThe monster's smile somehow grew even wider as if it felt proud of that fact.\n\n“But you didn’t kill her.” I said with sweat starting to drip down the side of my face.\n\nThe creature gave me a curious look wondering why I would ever suggest such a thing. It forced a menacing expression back into its grim face.\n\n“Oh? How strange of you to notice. You must have discovered the bullet holes in the porch. Here I’ve heard Agents simply shoot first and ask questions later. I didn’t think you were actually documenting the scene.”\n\nThis creature must have assumed I was at the scene as an intimidation tactic. Or wasn’t skilled enough at gathering evidence to notice how Laura really had been killed. The Corporation didn’t deal in trials. They killed creatures on sight if they were a danger to humans. There were some exceptions to that rule, but not many. Why would I bother recording a scene if I was just going to kill the creature regardless of what I discovered?\n\n\"You-” I wanted to question this creature further but shouting drew my attention away. \n\nI heard Ward’s and Maggie’s voices. When I looked back, the creature was gone. I hurried out of the cells to the main office. Ward had been dragging Maggie by her arm and Yates just got up to stop him.  \n\nThe older man let go before Yates acted. Maggie went behind a desk, her face filled with panic and her hand hovering over her sidearm. \n\n“What’s going on?” I demanded trying not to sound too harsh to upset Maggie further. \n\n“I woke up and she was-” Ward started but Maggie butted in. \n\n“I was watching the cameras on Ward’s computer. I heard voices and wanted to see who you were talking with, and I saw it. Only a brief flash but it was... It was the same thing that was eating Laura....” She choked out. \n\nI didn’t know how to explain myself. Ward gave a raised eyebrow unsure of what to think. He didn’t trust me but didn’t believe that I was speaking with something not exactly human. \n\n“Women are too damn emotional. You saw your friend getting eaten by some sort of animal and snapped. This is why girls should never do a man’s job.” Ward grumbled; arms crossed. \n\nYears of frustration over working with such a man finally came to a breaking point. Maggie pulled out her handgun and aimed it at her boss. I took a few steps closer, but Yates cut me off. It wasn’t wise getting near to Maggie while she thought I wasn’t on her side. \n\n“Shut your damn mouth! I’ve done everything around here while you sat on your fast ass and harassed every girl in sight! If I didn’t see that monster, I would have thought you were the one who killed Laura for rejecting you!” She shouted back, the gun in her hand trembling, \n\nThat bit of new information was another part of the puzzle. At that time, I thought I knew what happened and why we all found ourselves trapped inside the building. My stomach twisted with dread. Everything that happened next was far too fast for me to react.  \n\n“She was a slut that-” \n\nWard started to speak but Maggie pulled the trigger. A small pop came but he didn’t flinch. Instead, he drew his handgun and shot twice. Yates went down after a bullet tore through his left eye. Something hit my shoulder and I fell against a desk, suddenly unable to breathe due to pressure. By the time I stood back up with blood pouring from my shoulder, Ward made it over to Maggie. She kicked and fought but he outweighed her by at least a hundred pounds. He pinned her arm behind her back with his gun in his other hand. \n\n“Like hell I would let you have real bullets in your gun.” He hissed at her. \n\nI bet Yates also had a handgun filled with blanks. I confirmed it by grabbing his weapon from his holster and firing it off to the side. Pain tore through my body but I refused to let it overtake me. I needed to figure out a way to help Maggie. Ward pressed his gun to the side of her head causing me to freeze. I felt as if I moved an inch, he would kill her. \n\n“What a useless FED you are. I’ll have to work on making it look like you all killed each other. But first I’m going to do what I wanted to that dead bitch with my co-worker here. I’ve heard rumors they were sleeping with each other. No wonder our little Maggie snapped when she saw her little girlfriend’s guts ripped out.” \n\nI forced down bile at this man's words. I spotted a heavy glass paperweight and considered using it to smash his skull in. Maggie shook her head, scared to death and near tears. I didn’t think she, and Laura had been an item. She would have been more distraught if that was the case. But they may have been the only two women in the small town that loved the same gender. Such a secret a heavy burden for a place like this. \n\n“You killed a girl because you felt entitled to her body you piece of shit?” I spoke and did not hold back any of my hatred or anger. \n\nThe gun was pointed in my direction. I refused to move to react to the threat. I just needed him to admit to his crime.  \n\n“I am fucking entitled! She owed me her body and her life! After everything I’ve done for this-” \n\nAgain, his words were cut off. A mist burst out of Yates’ body, the gas swirling for a second then heading toward its target. Ward screamed and fired with no effect. He let go of Maggie just as the mist fell on him. She bolted, tripping over her own feet. We both watched in horror as the dark mist was absorbed into Ward’s body without him being able to do a thing about it. His skin darkened and cracked. A set of large bat wings tore from his back, spraying blood droplets over the office. Ward’s screams turned raspy as his body kept shifting. \n\nHis face grew younger, and his skull shifted into a different person altogether. Instead of being overweight, his body shifted into a more built and broad-shouldered type. When the transformation was finally over, I stared at a version of the monster I’d spoken with inside the cell. Red glowing eyes landed on the creature’s old body. After the mist left Yates’ body it shriveled up as if he’d been dead for a long time. \n\nUnderstandably, Maggie freaked out. She made a run for it outside, and the storm finally ended. I chased after her and it took a lot of convincing to get her back into a warm building until I could call someone to come and help. \n\nThe creature that had been Yates locked himself inside the cells. Maggie locked herself up in the other office. My jacket appeared back on the hook, so I quickly called for some help. I was told to sit tight, and that someone would be by in a few minutes. My shoulder wasn’t as bad as I thought. I felt a bit sick from the loss of blood, but I wanted to talk with the creature inside the cells. \n\nHe stood in the middle of the small room, not reacting when I came inside. \n\n“You discovered Laura first? After Ward killed her?” I questioned, cradling my bad arm. \n\nHe seemed like he didn’t want to answer. Those red eyes were hard to read.  \n\n“She was still alive, but I couldn’t do anything to save her. I exposed my wings because for a second I thought I may be fast enough to fly her to a hospital. She knew she wasn’t going to make it. So, she offered her flesh to give me enough strength to destroy the town that rejected her.” He answered in a calm voice. \n\nI should have been worried he wasn’t finished with his task. I was a bit scared but had a feeling if he wanted to kill the entire town, he would have done so already. \n\n“Maggie interrupted you. I saw Yates sleeping while we talked, so I assume you can leave the body you’re possessing. Somehow, you let Maggie see Yates soon enough after seeing the monster she didn’t think you two were the same thing. But... You must have had an idea what kind of person Ward was. Why didn’t you stop him before he killed Laura?” I asked, the question bothering me. \n\nThis creature had power. He used some magic to create a storm. Why not use it to save a girl? Did he not care, or was there a different reason? \n\n“I could not act based on feelings. I couldn’t even take over his body until he admitted to his evil. Yes, I knew he wanted to harm others. But if I was excused from punishment for killing a human based on my assumptions that he may kill in the future... then that would cause creatures to abuse that loophole. I hate the fact I arrived too late.” He replied.  \n\n“Do you?” \n\nWe all turned to see Maggie at the door. I didn’t know much she heard. Her face stained with tears and stress. \n\n“You may not believe me... But yes. I only ate half of her body and therefore could only finish half of her final request. I am a monster that takes over sinful flesh. However, I did find it enjoyable pretending to be human and spending time working here.” \n\nI looked between them unsure of their future. I wasn’t certain if The Corporation would arrest Yates, or whoever he was now for what he did. They may just give him a slap on the wrist and let him carry on. But Maggie might not be able to move on from all of this. The Corporation did give humans the option to remove their memories of supernatural encounters. It may be better for Maggie in the long run.  \n\nBefore the Agents arrived, I gave her my number so she could talk if she wanted. Having someone on her side made her feel better regardless of if she ever wanted to see me again. \n\nI once again was taken to the clinic to have my bullet wound looked at. Robin gave me a very disapproving look when I arrived. Since it passed through and didn’t hit anything important, they didn’t need to do much. A blood transfusion and some magic bandages fixed me up. Robin forced me to put my arm in a sling and I was told not to use it for another day. With some more warnings, I finally could go home. \n\nAt least they dropped me off at my front door. I felt exhausted and just wanted to sleep. I got back in the middle of the afternoon so that meant I had some hours of daylight left to nap. When I opened the front door, something felt off.  \n\nOnly one of Jackalope’s shoes was near the front door as if he kicked it off in a hurry. He always kept them in their place. Pesto hopped around the corner to greet me, followed by a stressed-out Houdini. Rabbits are far smarter than people think. They heard the door open and came rushing over to get some help. \n\nI didn’t take off my shoes. I ran into the living room. What I saw made me dizzy for a few seconds too long. My roommate had collapsed on the floor, the coffee table was knocked to the side. His hair down, covering his face. I rushed over to him, tossing off the sling I’d been told to wear to lift him to see the damage. His face pale as a ghost and barely breathing. I opened my mouth to say his name when his arm moved. \n\nThe new arm came off his shoulder, sliding down his uniform sleeve. The flesh turned into a black sludge pooling into the floor. My sense of panic almost overtook me. I forced myself to call the clinic. I wisely saved the number. Robin answered and joked about me forgetting something when I left a few minutes ago. I barely could get out the words to have him send someone over right away to collect us. \n\nWhen he understood how bad the situation was, he had people in the door within the minute. Two people took Jackalope as I followed. One person stayed behind long enough to put the rabbits away so they wouldn’t go near the black substance now seeping into the living room carpet. \n\nI stayed at the clinic for the entire night. Robin kept saying Jackalope would be fine after treatment, and I needed some rest. I refused. My body was working on stress that made me pace the hallway outside the treatment room. My head pounded from the lack of sleep. When Robin came over again, I thought the creature had some sort of news. Instead, a needle went into my arm, and I passed out for a few hours. The jerk. \n\nI woke up angry but lacking the headache from before. At least Robin now let me see Jackalope after we both got some rest. The bandages kept some of the pain away, but my shoulder still ached. The pain in my chest walking into his room overshadowed everything else. \n\nHe tried to sit up. I sat next to his bed telling him to stay laying down. I found a cup of ice water and helped him with it. Then we sat in silence for a few minutes unable to think of anything to say. \n\n“I’m sorry...” I broke finally, my voice a whisper. \n\nHe should have let me die back then. I’ve had that thought countless times since he moved in. Seeing him in such a terrible condition only enforced my feelings. \n\n“I didn’t give up my arm for you to be sorry about it.” Jackalope replied but his voice lacked any strength. \n\nRobin told me that Agents just wanted humans to live. Jackalope wanted to give up his life for my own. He hated seeing me distraught over his choice. No matter how much I wanted to feel grateful for what he’d done, I couldn’t shake the feeling he made a mistake. \n\n“I should be the one apologizing. I rushed things and asked for an arm too soon. They needed to create a custom one, but doubted they would be able to do so. I took the best option, stressed it out by using magic while at work, and ended up like this. I bet I traumatized the boys by passing out in front of them.” \n\nHe nearly died and he was worried about the rabbits. They were stressed out but would get over it. I wanted to point that out, but I decided against it. I worried just how long those two saw him on the ground unable to help. I should have gotten home sooner. \n\n“They said they need the bedspace. It's a miracle you’re good to head home any time you feel ready. I need to change your bandages, but that’s it.” I told him, thinking back to what Robin said before I rushed into the room. \n\nJackalope sank deeper under the blankets. He wasn’t very happy about how I needed to take care of him for the next few days. The last thing he wanted to be was a burden even though he’d given up so much for someone as useless as myself. \n\n“I could... Maybe call one of my old partners. Hang out there. You’re busy with work. I can’t make you-” He started. \n\n“Jackie, don’t act like a child. I can take some time off for you.” \n\nThe nickname slipped out. I didn’t even realize I said it before the embarrassment settled in. I wanted to slam my head against the wall. A redness started to creep up my cheeks making me almost just get up and leave the room. \n\n“Alright.” The word came very softly from under the blankets. \n\nSomehow the nickname got Jackalope happy enough to go along with something he normally would refuse. I need to not let myself abuse this new power in the future. \n\nI left his room to let him get a bit more rest. I also needed to take care of some paperwork for both of us. As I sat in the lobby filling out forms, a person passed by I really didn’t want to see. But I needed to talk to him about work. \n\n“Lupa, I’ll be taking a few days off.” I said and the short man stopped walking to address me. \n\n“I’ve heard. You were injured again. It seems as if your shoulder and your partner should be healed on the same day.” Lupa said sounding a bit annoyed I was yet again taking a few days off. \n\n“Roommate.” I corrected him but went on. “How is Ten Thousand and Six doing? I’ve been trying to get a hold of him but no one is telling me anything.” \n\nLupa needed to think about who I just asked about. He had so many Agents under his care, he lost track for a moment. \n\n“Yes, that one. He recovered and went into the field after you two worked together. However, that job was also too much for him. There were some complications. That Agent is gone.” Lupa said as if he just read out the weather and not announced the death of an Agent. \n\nIf I wasn’t sitting down, I would have collapsed. When I didn’t answer, Lupa gave me one last look to carry on with whatever brought him to the clinic. I don’t know how long I sat in shock over the news. Those words repeated in my head over and over again. We hadn’t been close friends, but I didn’t want to believe he was just gone. My mind spiraled into trying to understand what I just heard. \n\n“Is everything alright?” \n\nJackalope’s voice drew my attention to him. He still looked terrible. At least he could stand and move around. All the color gone from his face, and his hair a mess. They must have given him vampire blood to heal up because I didn’t remember him looking so thin before. I looked him over, my stomach twisting in guilt that I’d done this to him. \n\nI thought about his question and how to answer it. Six was gone. Nothing should ever be alright after that. He'd lost an arm twice because of me. And I still hadn’t found a way to get rid of that Dark God before he finally latched himself onto my roommate. \n\n“Yeah. I’m just tired.” I somewhat lied. \n\nI felt tired as hell. I didn’t want to think about anything. The only thing I wanted was to sleep. \n\nWe arrived back home, and the living room was cleaned up by someone who worked at the clinic. Since I couldn't cook, I ordered something to force Jackalope to eat. Within a few hours, he’d fallen asleep, tucked into bed with a few extra blankets. I considered getting him one of those weighted blankets because he seemed to like being under so many of them at once. \n\nI collapsed into bed, my arm killing me from overuse. I didn’t tell Jackalope about the bullet wound. He would have refused to come back home if he knew I was still healing. I slept for a few hours. In the middle of the night, I woke up with a weight on my chest. My body was too worn down to move. \n\nA dark figure sat, two flaming blue eyes staring down at me. The face got close to my own letting a rotting smell come over me. \n\n“Six Is dead because of you. If you saved him sooner, he would not have died on the second job.” The voice hissed in a twisted version of my roommate’s. \n\nI wanted to argue. My brain refused to do anything but agree. \n\n“Your little friend rushed into getting a new arm and suffered for you. And because of what? What have you done? Adopted two rabbits that could have found a better home? Donated blood and yet you used more than you gave away? You have done nothing in your life. And now you’re causing so much pain. You went from worthless to harmful.” \n\nMy eyes were open and yet I couldn’t see anything. Those words created a pressure inside my chest that felt like it would burst at any second. I didn’t have any strength to push the creature away. I just felt so damn tired. \n\n“You should just...” \n\nA sharp pain on my fingertips snapped me awake. I found myself standing in the bathroom in the dark. My hand flew to the light switch, leaving a smudge of blood behind. A few minutes passed for my mind to catch up. When I realized what nearly happened, I threw up my dinner. \n\nMy disposable razor sat broken on the counter, the blade had cut into my fingers. It took me a very long time to stop shaking. I quickly gathered up the rest of the razors and stormed outside to put them all in the bottom of the trash bin. My cuts left blood I needed to go back and clean up. I was grateful that Jackalope didn’t wake up from the noise. \n\nGuilt and shame wrecked my stomach. I couldn’t face him after what nearly happened. In the morning I would call The Corporation asking them to somehow God-proof the house. After everything others had given up for me, I needed to do the simple request and keep living. The God took advantage of my weakest moment, and I worried he may do so again.",

        "text": "Welcome to Episode 1, Part 1 of the recreation of the \"I Didn't Follow My Father's Rule And Now I'm Working For The Government\". Enjoy! (Originally posted at r/mrcreeps).\n\nHello, My name is Travis Marcella, I'm currently 16, with dark brown hair and pretty skinny. I have green eyes and I'm in 10th grade. Today Is March 23, 2024 and I never expected to be making entries of my life since It was pretty average, but something strange has been happening recently. I'll try to explain what's happening as best as I can.\n\nI was riding my bicycle one evening, my backpack barely hanging onto my shoulders as I went as fast as I could to get home in the pouring rain. I eventually reached my fathers cabin and I quickly scrambled inside.\n\n\"Dad\"? I called out.\n\nThere was no answer and to my dismay, My father was sleeping on the couch. I shook him until he woke up. Today was my birthday and I was not going to allow him to sleep through It.\n\n\"W-Wha... Travis... What are you doing\"?! He said confused.\n\n\"Dad, It's MY Birthday. Come on\"! I said, quickly running to the kitchen and grabbing some candles.\n\nI, then ran to my backpack and took out slightly crushed cake. I set it on the table and started placing the candles on the top.\n\n\"14...15....16\"! I shouted. \"Dad you got all the candles\"! I shouted excitedly.\n\nMy father grumbled as he took out his lighter and set the candles ablaze. I watched intently as flames flickered ever so slightly.\n\nWe sang the birthday song (Well I sang It and he hummed along) and I blew out my candles. I, 16 years of age, obviously wished for a girlfriend. We got some snacks together and watched some TV in the living room.\n\nA couple hours later, my father was asleep again and i was watching some 1990s horror films. I glanced out the window and to my shock I saw a shadow in the corner of my eye.\n\nI screamed and shook my dad. He woke up and i told him what happened. He immediately grabbed his shotgun and slammed open the front door. He ran off into the night and left me alone for what felt like hours. Eventually he came back and told me he had some new house rules in a serious tone. At first, I was confused but then he pulled out a piece of paper and gave it to me. There were only 5 rules but they were odd nonetheless.\n\nRule 1) Do not go outside at night  \nRule 2) If you see anything strange, tell me.  \nRule 3) Lock the front door before midnight.  \nRule 4) Do Not Respond To Any Odd sounds, No Matter How Human They seem.\n\nRule 5) If you ever encounter any- The rest of the rule was scratched out.\n\nI read these rules more than five times, trying to understand these rules clearly but to no avail.\n\n\"Dad, these rules...Don't they seem a bit odd\"? I asked.\n\n\"No, these are the rules you MUST follow\". He said the last part loudly.\n\nI was confused but I dismissed the weird situation and followed the rules. The next couple of days at school were pretty normal, but whenever I was at home.... I keep seeing these-... these shadows... In the corner of my eye. It really freaks me out but my father says it's my imagination playing tricks on me. I think he is keeping something from me.\n\nThe next day, I was at school when Daniel Parker bumped into me, thrusting all of my books and school supplies on the floor. I rushed to pick them up while he laughed and walked away. I gritted my teeth and held back my rage. \"Was there no teachers to deal with this idiot\". I thought.\n\nI heard later on that day that there was a test coming up that was giving the highest score $500. The best part is that it was only for kids who had a C+ or below. I was always a C+ student so I had the advantage. The test was in three days and we were all given study notes.\n\nI went to get on my bike to ride home that day to find out that someone had graffiti written all over my bike along with my tires being stolen. I gritted my teeth and I accidentally bit my cheek. Cursing myself, I grabbed my bike and dragged it home.\n\nI walked home and I saw another shadow in the corner of my eye, running off into the backyard. I ran after it. I watched as it ran deep into the forest that surrounded the cabin that my father and I lived in. I went to run after it but I felt something grab my shoulder. I turned around to see my father. He looked extremely pale and held his shotgun in his hand, torch hanging off of the tip.\n\n\"D-Dad, did you see it\"?! I said hysterically, almost questioning my sanity.\n\n\"What are you talking about\" He lied. \"I saw a deer\". He stated and began to chase after the shadow. I watched in shock as my father chased after the shadow with no fear in his eyes. Maybe he did see a deer and I'm just... going insane.\n\nI lay awake that night, thinking about what was happening. I could almost hear the shadows laughing at me trying to figure out if they were real or not. I took out my phone and scrolled through my contacts. Still empty, what was I even expecting, I watched some old cartoons. Old cartoons always calmed me down, even as a baby. They just, looked cool to me I guess? I got a decent night of rest despite the circumstances.\n\nI woke up and realized I had not studied at all and only had 2 days until the test. I had my mind on studying all day but all my hope for studying was shattered when Daniel Parker bumped into me again. Nothing happened and I sighed with relief and realized in horror that my study notes were missing. I turned back to see him smiling and he ripped my notes to shreds and threw them out.\n\nI wanted to punch him so badly, I wanted him to HURT so badly but I gritted my teeth and sighed in defeat. I walked home as my bike was still not fixed. My father promised to get me some tires today and I doubted that he would even keep his word.\n\nTo my surprise I walked home to see him wide awake, sober, and new tires in the corner of the room. He even helped me assemble them onto my bike. I felt something was off though, usually my father was drunk or sleeping but he seemed much more alert and always had his shotgun near. I saw his trigger finger tensing up randomly. I thanked my dad for the tires and immediately went to my room.\n\nSomething was off with my dad and I expected him to be drunk but I watched as he just kept staring at the windows as if something was playing peek-a-boo. I considered that he might be seeing the shadows as well but that doesn't explain why- My thoughts were interrupted by a knocking on the window. I turned to see the pitch black night but something was a bit off. I squinted and I swear I could make out 8 eyes staring back. I didn't react much as I thought I was being paranoid like my father said and I got into my bed and tried to fall asleep but...\n\nAs i write this I cant help but feel like I'm being watched. I'm unsure what to make of what's happening but I'll keep in touch.... I promise.\n\nThanks for reading Episode 1, Part 1. This was about 6.5k words and took me a lot of effort to make! Be ready as Part 2 Will be out in the next couple days.",

        "author": "Adomanzius",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11jft3b/weird_bumps_and_blisters_started_to_grow_on_my/",
        "text": "Last week, my friend Alex started to exhibit symptoms of, well, let's call it an unusual skin condition. On Monday, during our econ lecture, he complained about small bumps and blisters forming on his back. I brushed it off, and reminded him that changing one’s bed sheets every six months, along with an irregular hygiene schedule (the man smelled like he needed a shower then and there) could do that to a college frat boy. Ignoring my stab, as if he’d barely recognized it, his attention focused on something else entirely, he said the bumps felt and looked a bit like chickenpox.\n\n“Have you *had* chickenpox?” I asked him, as childhood memories of small, red, prickly points bedazzling me and my siblings' skin blushed into my mind. Picturing an adult having chickenpox felt out of place, the word itself so closely tied to childhood - like a grown man crying as their ice cream fell on the floor.\n\n“Of course I’ve had chickenpox, dumbass,” Alex replied. “Why else would I compare this shit to chickenpox?” \n\n“Well, maybe it’s just some advanced form of Herpes then. You know, starting from your balls, the bumps start to spread into other continents - like Columbus in search of India - traversing through the horrid canal of your taint and the treacherous seas of your asscrack, until they’ve reached their America: your lanky, sweaty back.”\n\nAlex was obviously annoyed at me, but couldn’t help but chortle out a laugh through gritted teeth. “Super-herpes,” he replied a minute later, amused at the phrase he’d concocted.\n\nThe next time I heard from Alex was on Wednesday. He texted me that he’d be ditching class that morning to go see a doctor. He wasn’t the type of guy to visit *any* medical professionals, let alone a doctor - once he’d broken two of his fingers playing basketball and he’d just taped them up for a month and waited for the bones to heal. Granted, both fingers *did* heal, but once they cocooned out of his homemade cast (materials: toilet paper and duck tape), they pointed in different directions, the bones having healed in a curved pattern. When he got sick, he’d half-assedly cite research concerning super-bacteria, which would - according to him - ransack humanity if we keep prescribing antibiotics for everything from common flus to random pains. And of course, he was correct, albeit also not. But that was Alex for ya; in one swift sentence he could go from well-informed and dignified university student to a baboon flinging shit at the wall. So - if Alex was going to a doctor, he’d have to be real scared. I wished him luck, and reminded him that super-herpes *probably* wasn’t a real thing, hoping to lighten the mood a bit.\n\nOn Friday, I hung out with him during lunch. We’d made plans before, after he said everything went OK at the doctors. As I carried my “meal” (a slice of pizza and a nondescript sweet bun)  on a wobbly and twisted plastic platter, I spotted Alex sitting alone at a big, round metal table - the ones that were made for six or more people. His hands were under the table, and a hoodie (the same one he always wore, and by which I recognized him) veiled his face as he slumped forward on his chair. The lunch hall was packed, but it seemed like no one dared to sit next to him. As I approached the table, I realized why. \n\nAlex looked half-dead, his skin pale and his posture constantly trying to nestle his body toward a fetal position. Although the baggy hoodie gave his torso a Michelin Man look, his arms and back made contact with the thick fabric. And those parts were *bumpy*; like he’d stuffed rocks of varying sizes under the sleeves and backside. Some of those rocks seemed to pulsate, moving independently of him.\n\n“Hey Alex,” I uttered unsurely, my voice immediately unveiling the concern I felt.\n\nAlex looked up and smiled, still keeping his hood on. His face was ravaged by blisters and bumps, which is when I realized what the rocks under his sleeves and back were. He smiled half-heartedly, and as his face moved so did the clusters of red blisters, some caught in the fluorescent light  and shining as if coated by sugar. *Super-herpes? More like, Super-acne*, I thought, immediately annoyed at myself for making a joke, even if it was only to myself.\n\n“Hey man. So, uhh, super-herpes seems to be real,” he said, “and I’m a real Swamp Thing now I guess.”\n\nI sat down opposite of him, noticing that on his platter he only had a bottle of water and a half-eaten apple. He looked like he needed about seventeen Big Macs and five chocolate milkshakes.\n\n“Holy shit dude, are you okay? What did the doctor say?” I asked.\n\n“Well, they don’t really know what it is.” Alex replied. He took a pause before continuing, his face forming a slight frown. I thought I saw puss leaking down his neck.\n\n“I mean, they don’t know what it is, but they said it shouldn’t be too harmful. The spots started to get real itchy, like something was tickling the insides of my skin. The doctor prescribed this ointment that I need to lather all over the spots. That was fine until I got more and more of them. I woke up to like twenty new spots every day. And yes, *you perv*, I may or may not be lathered in the stuff right now, like a lubed up dildo.”\n\n“I did always think you held a slight resemblance to a dick,” I replied, although the mood immediately rejected the joking atmosphere, even if Alex feigned a smirk. “Have you gone back to the doctor, though? That doesn’t seem normal, man.”\n\nAlex gave a long sigh and burrowed his elbows on the table. “The doc said there really isn’t much to do right now. Unless I come up with a fever or other symptoms relating to an infection or something, I should just try to rest and keep monitoring the situation.”\n\n“Sounds like bullshit,” my words clocking Alex on the chin and grabbing his attention. “I’m sorry to say this… but you look like shit. You need to go back there and not leave until they help you out. That’s not normal.”\n\n“Even if I wanted to, they won't see me until Monday. They’re only open for emergencies for the weekend.”\n\n“This is an emergency,” I said.\n\n“Not according to them, it’s not.” The frown started taking on traits of frustration.\n\n“Fine, go to a private clinic then,” I insisted.\n\n“With what money? You know I’m broke,” Alex argued and lifted his arms as if to show all the money he did not have.\n\n“Fuck, man… okay, fine. But you promise to go first thing on Monday? And if it gets worse just go into the ER anyway.” \n\n“Okay, fine. You’re right. I’ll book the appointment today, okay?” \n\nAlex didn’t fight me on the subject further. I guess my reaction upon seeing his face was enough confirmation needed for him to believe the situation was serious. After I was done with my lunch, and he had nibbled on another quarter of his apple, we left for our respective dorms. I insisted that he text me for anything he might need, and to eat some real food and rest for the weekend. He nodded in agreement and gave me a sincere *thanks.*\n\nAs Monday rolled around, I hadn’t heard a peep from Alex. He didn’t show up for econ, and I didn’t see him at lunch either. After lunch I texted him “hey, how’d the dr. go?” \n\nNo answer.\n\nLater, as I checked again if he’d replied, I noticed he hadn’t even read the text; the checkmark under my message still grayed out. After my final lecture of the day ended, I decided to trek up to his dorm and see if he was in his room. \n\nGenuine concern gritted my facial muscles into an angry frown as I walked across campus to the large brick building. Alex was sloppy regarding timetables, responsibilities, and other adulting activities, but even for a frat boy this type of communication breakdown was concerning. As I entered the building and started to climb up the stairs toward the third floor, true concern gripped me, and I readied myself to call an ambulance. I'd never called one before, but for some reason I felt like tonight I'd need to. At best, he’d have gotten better and celebrated by drinking himself dumb. At worst, I thought, I’d find him drenched in sweat, running a high fever, and him mumbling something about super-bacteria. I couldn’t picture any good endings at that moment, and readied myself for the worst.\n\nI knocked on his door, winded from the long stairs. No answer. I put my ear up to the door and listened. I could hear someone talking in the neighboring room, indicated by a distinct muffling of the sound which was present in all dorms, but Alex’s room was dead quiet.\n\n“Alex. Hey, it’s me. You in there?” I asked as I knocked on the door for the second time. After another pause, I thought, *fuck it, I guess I’ll just break in then.*\n\nAlthough the university scalped each student from hundreds of thousands of dollars, they didn’t allocate much of their funding towards maintaining their buildings. The dorms sported a lot of 80’s flare in the form of wallpaper, furniture, and most importantly: doors and door locks. Years and years ago, someone had figured out that lifting the door up slightly from the handle and then yanking it left in a quick motion would sometimes open up the lock mechanism enough, so that a mere push would finalize the act and unlock the door. This secret wasn’t particularly well kept, but it didn’t seem like anyone was abusing the trick either. Checking the hallway for other students (none seen, some heard in their rooms), I lifted the door up from its hinges and pushed the handle to my left.\n\n*Click.*\n\nI slowly gave the door a push. The lock system crackled as if a phantom key had just been turned inside of it. The door opened, and I quickly stepped inside, victorious of the shitty 80’s lock mechanism.\n\nThe room was dark, the only illumination coming from the bedside lamp. I had to stand and wait for a few seconds as my eyes adjusted to the new level of lighting - I didn’t dare take a blind step and stumble on laundry or beer cans, which usually resided in randomized piles across Alex’s floor.\n\nMy eyes relaxing into the brooding, inky light of the room, I saw a dark figure laid on the bed.\n\n“Alex? Is that you?” I asked, eyeing the bed. The thing did not respond.\n\nI walked closer, my hand scanning the wall for the overhead light switch. “Alex, buddy, is that you?” My fingers touched a plastic edge, quickly finding the flaccid switch in the middle of it. I flicked it upwards, the uncovered lamp above immediately burning my eyes, the soft lighting betrayed by the harsh fluorescent lamp sending a pressure to the front of my skull. I blinked a few times to regain my vision and focused on the figure once more. It was definitely Alex, laying on his back with his arms tucked in and legs outstretched - but something was different.\n\nOnce I realized what he’d become - that this *wasn’t* the Alex I’d last seen - a pit was produced in my stomach, and I wanted to vomit out everything I’d ever eaten, just to clear and purify the insides of my body.\n\nHis skin no longer had blisters and bumps. Instead, each under-the-skin bulb had blossomed into thick tufts of black hair that grew outward from inside his body.\n\nThe hair protruded upwards in bulbous, curly strands - the texture reminding me of the hair that emerges during puberty; thick and dark. Beside each spot, the former blister’s skin had been ripped apart and left to hang beside the hair, like the spots had exploded and left a crater into the skin itself. I was looking at the tens, *hundreds* of hairy caps, fresh puss and blood oozing from some, others having thick scabs and coarse strips of dried human paint. It wasn’t until that point that I realized Alex was completely naked, besides the patchwork of hair upon his body. I noticed that his fingernails were coarse and caked with dead skin and blood. *Had he scratched them until they popped*, I thought, o*r had they popped regardless, him scratching himself raw while his pulpy skin popped like a bag of popcorn, handfuls of hair shooting up through his rice paper skin*. I shuddered at the thought as my body started to itch uncontrollably in hard to reach places.\n\nMy shock was interrupted when Alex gasped loudly, his body jolting awake. \n\n“Alex, ALEX, dude are you OK? What the fuck happened here?” I yelled as I closed the gap between me and the bed, nearly stumbling on a dirty sweater left on the floor. Coming in closer and looking at his face from above, I saw his eyes, which were crowded by hair-bulbs like the manicured bushes surrounding the science building. \"Hey man, it's me,\" I said, trying to seem relaxed. Alex didn’t respond. \n\nHis eyes - both milky and bloodshot - stared into mine, begging for help. He didn’t move, but instead shook in a slow motion, like the way someone with early stage Parkinson’s might hold a spoon, except instead of just a hand it was his whole body. Looking deeper into his eyes, I noticed that small strands of hair had sewn his eyelids into an open position. I saw him try to blink, the reaction twitching the muscles around his face slightly, but the eyelids wouldn’t come down. Alex was unable to blink.\n\nThe ambulance took him to a hospital. I tried to ask them what was wrong with him, to which they gave no reply. I was promptly pushed out of his dorm, and soon I was back in my own room, sitting on my bed. The worry and fear started to release and tears welled up in my eyes. *Holy shit, what the fuck,* was all I could think about as Alex’s unblinking eyes meandered in my mind. A teardrop descended onto my left arm, which I swiped off with the other hand. When I did this, I noticed a bump on my skin, and the fear and worry I had for Alex made way for sheer panic.\n\nI looked at the bump - the size of an edamame bean - poked it with my finger, and tried to see if there were hairs sticking out of it. *How hadn’t I noticed this before? Was it there before?* The panic started to intensify; my throat clenched up and a vague need to **get out** started to overtake my body. \n\nI jumped up and made my way to a small dresser I kept knick-knacks in. I rifled through drawers, opening and closing them violently as I rummaged and threw old notebooks and dried up pens across the floor. The bottom drawer produced what I had been looking for: an x-acto knife that I’d bought mistakingly when I was supposed to buy a regular box cutter instead.\n\nI sat back down on the bed and steadied my left arm as best I could on my lap. Using my right hand, I plunged the tip of the knife into the bump, dragging it across the small half-globe, making a small incision into the skin. The adrenaline kept the pain receptors vacant, and I only felt a slight pinch as a small stream of blood formed around the cut.\n\nI stretched the skin with my fingers to open up the incision. Inside, under a thin veil of ooze, was a small ball of dark hair, wet from blood and clear puss. I gasped and quickly clenched my jaw and flexed my muscles as a single thought remained, in my mind, consuming all others: **get IT OUT**.\n\nI plunged my index finger and thumb inside the hole and grabbed the tuft firmly. As I tugged, I could feel hairs embedded deep into my skin and bones being pulled from tight crevices inside my arm. The arm twitched oddly, as if the hairs being pulled flexed and relaxed certain muscles inside it, like a ventriloquist controlling their puppet. The pain was immense, like pulling out a mixture of splinters and strands of steel wool jammed under fingernails.\n\nThe ball of hair finally released itself. I looked at it, pointing it towards the skylight, and saw that the ball connected to a tail of long, hair-thin strands, similar to the rest of the hairs. It looked like a dark, mucusy jellyfish, or like a hairball covered in saliva after a cat has puked it out. I threw the thing in the trash and tried to forget about it - the thought of those thin threads burrowing inside of my arm making me feel nauseous and weak.\n\nDid I get the bumps from Alex? If so, who did he get them from? And it’s not like me and Alex are intimate, so how did it spread? I have a fuckton of questions and zero answers. I’ll try to see Alex soon, and maybe ask around if other people on campus have gotten weird bumps or blisters. LMK if ya'll have any experiences like this.",

At the same time, someone taps *me* on the shoulder. I turn around, but the guy behind me is looking behind him. In fact, all the way up the auditorium, the people are looking at the person behind them. \n\nWait. \n\nWhat. The. Actual.

        "text": "In my childhood years, I dwelled in an old-fashioned ranch-style house alongside my parents in the charming state of South Carolina. As any child living in a small rural town could attest, the lack of modern entertainment options rendered one's imagination as their sole source of amusement. With no smartphones or internet at our disposal back then, I had to rely on myself to keep boredom at bay.\n\nOur property boasted a vast expanse of land, roughly 15 acres of wooded area that beckoned me to explore every afternoon after school. As I roamed the trails, I would indulge in my fantasies, imagining myself as an adventurer or something childish like that. When summer break started this became my main source of entertainment. \n\nOne day while I was wandering about, I found myself at the outer edge of our property, where a small clearing came into view. It was there that a weathered shed and a heap of old tires lay abandoned.\n\nInitially, I was filled with intrigue at the sight of it. Its appearance was reminiscent of an old storage shed, probably left behind by the previous owners. Giddy little me was more than happy to claim and declare it as my base for operations. As time passed, I found myself increasingly invested in the place. I would bring over various items like a small table, some chairs, and even a radio. \n\nWhenever the sun set in the summer, fireflies would arise from the long grass and the whole clearing would light up like it was filled with a sea of little stars. It was just the most whimsically beautiful place you'd ever seen. Like something that came out of a fantasy movie. However, that wasn't what made this place special.\n\nWhat made it special was *her*.\n\nIt was a warm summer evening when I decided to take my stroll to the clearing. I just loved the way the sun cast golden light through the leaves of the trees during that time of day, and that sweet smell, like honeydew and dandelions. \n\nHowever, as I approached the shack this particular day, I noticed a girl sitting on one of the tires, whittling a stick. She had chestnut brown hair and eyes that glowed like amber. She looked up as I walked closer and we both froze.\n\n\"Hello,\" she said with a nervous smile. It had been ages since I last talked to someone new in this small rural town.\n\n\"Hi,\" I replied, my voice quivering a little. The trees around us stood tall, watching as we stood there in silence. \n\n\"It's such a nice spot, isn't it?\" she said, breaking the quietness. I nodded in agreement, my eyes studying her features, trying to get a read on her.\n\nFor a while, we just stood there, not sure what to say. Then, I mustered up the courage to ask, \"Do you live nearby?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" she responded with a soft smile, her eyes scanning the forest as if looking for something. \"What about you?\"\n\n\"I live nearby too,\" I replied, feeling relieved that we weren't complete strangers.\n\nAs we chatted, I felt the awkwardness dissipate and a sense of comfort settle in. It was like we had known each other, even though we had just met.\n\nBefore long, I offered to take her on a tour of the woods. She was hesitant at first, but I managed to persuade her. We walked through the winding paths, talking about anything and everything. When the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over everything around us, we found a small creek where we sat down and continued our conversation.\n\nAs the sky grew dark, I knew it was time to head back home. I walked her back to the shack, feeling grateful for this chance encounter. But as I was about to leave, I realized I had forgotten to ask her name.\n\n\"What's your name?\" I asked, feeling a little embarrassed.\n\n\"Autumn,\" she replied, and it was like everything fell into place.\n\nHer name lingered in my mind, and it was a perfect fit for her. She embodied the essence of the season - a refreshing breeze of change, bringing new beginnings.\n\nThe following days turned into weeks and weeks into months. Autumn and I spent every moment we could exploring the woods, laughing, and just being kids. It was a simpler time, a time when you were free to roam without a care in the world.\n\nLooking back, those summer days were some of the happiest moments of my life. The memories of our adventures are etched in my mind forever. In those woods, I found warmth, friendship, and a special bond. A bond that only children can have.\n\nI can still remember the excitement of rushing home to tell my parents about my newfound friend. They were just as surprised as I was that there was another family nearby that we didn't know about. Their suggestion to invite her overfilled me with anticipation.\n\nBut when I asked Autumn if she wanted to come over, she politely declined. I then asked if I could visit her, but she said it wasn't possible. Looking back now, I realize that I never actually did see her go home. We always walked back to the shed and said our goodbyes, but I never checked to see where she went or which direction she came from. And no matter how early I arrived, she was always there before me, adding to the air of mystery that surrounded her.\n\nI didn’t want to force anything. I wanted her to open up whenever she felt comfortable. Time passed and Autumn became a constant presence in my life. She was the one who made the mundane days exciting, someone who added color to my world. But as summer came to an end, something strange began to happen. Autumn started to fade away, not literally. She just started to show up less and less, until one day, she stopped coming altogether.\n\nInitially, I thought that Autumn may have only been staying for the summer and left without saying goodbye, or maybe she was just too busy with school to come out. Regardless of the reason, I felt sad and it didn't take long for my parents to notice.\n\n\"What's wrong, buddy?\" My dad asked.\n\n\"Autumn hasn't been around lately,\" I replied with a heavy sigh.\n\nMy mom suggested, \"Maybe she's staying with relatives or something. Surely, she'll come back next year.\"\n\n\"It's strange because she never told me where she was staying,\" I remarked.\n\n\"Oh, I forgot to mention,\" my dad added. \"I checked and there are no properties nearby, so I have no clue where your friend could be from.\"\n\n\"Where did you usually find her?\" my parents asked in unison.\n\n\"At the shed in the woods,\" I answered.\n\nMy parents looked at me in confusion.\n\n\"What shed?\" they asked.\n\nI explained to them about the old, rundown shed at the edge of our property with piles of old tires.\n\nUpon my dad's expression of interest, I decided to give him a tour of the place. I took him down the path I usually take in the woods and into the forest clearing. I noticed that the shed seemed even gloomier than before. Nonetheless, we entered.\n\n\"Great job on this place, buddy,\" my dad complimented.\n\n\"Thanks,\" I replied, and proceeded to show him the changes I had made to the interior and exterior of the shed. As we exited, my dad mentioned his willingness to assist with rebuilding some parts of the structure. Suddenly, his attention was drawn to something nearby.\n\n\"Hey, have you considered moving these tires out of the way?\" he asked.\n\n\"Huh? I hadn't thought of it,\" I responded.\n\nMy dad mustered up his strength and lifted the tire closest to the shed, which happened to be the same tire I found Autumn sitting on when I met her. To my astonishment, there was a trap door beneath it.\n\nWe exchanged bewildered looks, both surprised by the sudden discovery.\n\n\"I never knew this was here,\" I remarked. \n\nMy dad suggested we investigate, and my curiosity got the best of me. He struggled at first, but eventually managed to force open the trap door. A rickety wooden ladder led down into the hidden cellar. My dad bravely went down first and, after confirming it was safe, I followed. \n\nThe cellar was filled with crates and barrels. My dad eagerly opened some and found bottles of alcohol.\n\n“Woah-ho, Jackpot!” my dad exclaimed.\n\nAs he began to loot the crates, I ventured deeper into the cellar. That's when something slowly came into picture. My stomach sank and the air around me froze. Sitting up against the cold cellar wall was a skeleton.\n\nA small human skeleton. \n\nI was so shocked, my mind went blank, words weren’t able to come out of my mouth, and instead, I let out a scream. My dad came rushing over to see what had caused my distress. When he saw the ghoulish-looking shell of a corpse, he too was left breathless. \"Oh my god,\" he whispered.\n\nThe events that followed were a blur to me. I can't recall all the details. The police were summoned and cordoned off the area with tape. Following an extensive investigation and numerous visits from the local forensic examiner, it was discovered that the remains belonged to a girl who had gone missing 15 years earlier.\n\nThe previous owners of the property were abusive parents who mistreated their child. The girl frequently appeared at school with bruises, in soiled clothing, and was severely malnourished. Child protective services had been notified and were about to intervene, but one day the girl vanished.\n\nThe county police department had always suspected the parents had something to do with the disappearance, but lacked sufficient evidence to pursue them. Their suspicions remained unsubstantiated. Like many missing person cases, the investigation eventually went cold and the girl was never located.\n\nHowever, there was one detail that stood out.\n\nThe girl's name was Autumn.",

        "text": "I remember the day I found that USB drive. It was a dreary afternoon, and I was walking home from school. The clouds were heavy with rain, and the wind was biting. I had my hood up and my hands shoved deep in my pockets, trying to keep warm.\n\nAs I walked, I noticed something on the ground. It was a small, black USB drive, lying in a puddle. At first, I was hesitant to pick it up. I had always been warned about the dangers of inserting unknown USB drives into my computer, but my curiosity got the better of me.\n\nI picked up the drive, wiped it clean, and examined it closely. It was a standard USB drive with no labels or markings. I decided to take a chance and brought it with me. Back home I was strangely eager to see what was on the drive. I went straight to my room and plugged it into my computer.\n\nWhen I opened the drive, I found a video game on it. I was ecstatic. It was a game I had been waiting for since last year. Ever since I had heard the announcement of the start of development I knew I wanted to play it, and there it was, just waiting for me to play it. I knew I should have been more cautious, but I was too excited to think straight.\n\nI installed the game on my computer and started playing. It was everything I had hoped for and more. The graphics were amazing, the gameplay was smooth, and the storyline was captivating. I spent hours playing the game, lost in its immersive world.\n\nBut then, something strange happened.\n\nAfter I did the normal act as gamers sometimes do, saving the game and killing all the NPC, I reloaded the save, and the NPC characters remembered everything I had done to them. It was as if they had gained sentience.\n\nI brushed it off as a glitch in the game and continued playing. But then, the NPC characters started contacting me in the real world. They sent me haunting emails, telling me about the massacre in the game and how I had harmed them.\n\nAt first, I tried to ignore the emails, thinking it was just part of the game. But then, the emails started getting more frequent, and the NPC characters became more aggressive. They started calling me, their voices cold and lifeless, delivering typical NPC-like lines, but with added details about what I had done to them in the game.\n\nI was terrified, and I knew I had to do something to stop them. But every time I tried to uninstall the game or delete it from my computer, the NPC characters would somehow prevent me from doing it.\n\nThe emails and calls continued, and they started to become more disturbing. The NPC characters would send me photos of themselves with injuries, caused by my actions in the game. They would describe in detail the pain and suffering I had caused them.\n\nI was on the verge of a breakdown.\n\nAs the days went by, I became increasingly paranoid. I thought I saw the NPC characters everywhere I went. I would catch glimpses of them in crowds, lurking in the shadows, watching me with cold, lifeless eyes.\n\nI even thought I saw them on public billboards around the city, but I couldn't be sure. I dismissed it as my mind playing tricks on me, but the thought of them being out there, in the real world, was enough to send shivers down my spine.\n\nI tried to put the game and the NPC characters out of my mind, but they were always there, lurking in the back of my thoughts, waiting to pounce.\n\nOne night, as I was lying in bed, trying to sleep, I heard a faint tapping at my window. At first, I thought it was just the wind, but then I heard it again, more insistent this time.\n\nI slowly got out of bed and cautiously made my way to the window. As I peered out into the darkness, I saw something that made my blood run cold. It was one of the NPC characters, standing outside my window, staring at me with its cold, lifeless eyes.\n\nI stumbled back in shock, tripping over my own feet and falling to the ground. I scrambled to my feet and ran to the door, locking it behind me.\n\nFrom that moment on, I knew that I could never escape the game or the NPC characters. They had become a part of me, haunting me day and night, always watching, always waiting.\n\nSo, I'm writing this now to warn everyone. DO NOT PLUG IN RANDOM USB IN YOUR COMPUTER! The consequences can be devastating. Protect yourself, and don't let curiosity get the better of you. The game may seem like harmless fun, but it can quickly turn into a nightmare that you can never wake up from.",

        "text": "This is a story about a simple word and a complex world. I do not know of anyone who does not say that word at least one time in a day, since we as humans all agree to at least one thing we are asked for during the day. You might have guessed it by now, the word I am referring to is yes. My grandmother Margaret is a really spiritual person, someone who I was never ready to become. When I lived with her at some point in my life, she used to give me all kinds of tips on how to avoid getting into trouble with evil spirits, like really. It took what happened in this story for me to realize that our old family members do not just ramble on about weird things because they are old, superstitious, or just want to talk. There is a lot of wisdom imparted at each time they open their mouths.\n\n\"Scott, listen carefully.\" My grandmother would quietly say when she was about to start with her advices.\n\n'Here we go again!' I would think, bracing myself for what I considered a long moment of absolute boredom.\n\nOne of those long speeches revolved around the word yes. What is yes? Let us not bore ourselves with a long definition from a dictionary. Simply put, it is a word used to express agreement. The question is agreement to what? This is where another word comes in: solicitation. Once again, simply put, the act of asking for or trying to obtain something from someone. Fresh out my browser.\n\nYou know, according to my grandmother, the spiritual world is a scary place where you cannot allow yourself to act, talk or even walk like you would usually do. It is a strange place overlapping the reality we all know, populated by many dangerous supernatural beings, which number is greater than the earth's population. It is a cruel world, filled with deceptive evil spirits, happening to be masters of seemingly innocent solicitations. When your phone rings for example, it is a form of solicitation, however, in the spiritual world it is perceived as a worded question: are you there? Are you available? Are you alone? May I hurt you? May I kill you? Just any question. Therefore, if you answer yes hulloh, what exactly are you agreeing to with that yes?\n\nThis is why my grandmother forbid me to answer yes when I pick up the phone, when someone calls my name, especially if I only hear the person, or other situations that seem so natural after all. I never really cared about all her advices until July 2022 during one rainy night.\n\nAfter an intense gym session earlier, I had completely forgotten about something I had left outside and I had to retrieve it at around 2am after remembering about it. What exactly was the thing? I cannot recall, but I remember shaking it after closing but not locking the door behind me, and that is when I heard it: three gentle knocks, so gentle they could have been made by a child. Who could that be at such time? I thought.\n\n\"Scott?\" I heard a woman call from behind the door, immediately followed by three soft knocks.\n\n\"Yeah, who's that? Jodie?\" I called, thinking it could be my girlfriend.\n\nGoosebumps invaded my arms and back, and a strange dread took hold of my mind. You know, it is said that we humans, just like animals, can sense danger on the spot. The advices from my grandmother flooded my brain and I trembled at the realization that the knocks, especially, were a solicitation and I just agreed to something with a casual yeah.\n\nSomething pushed the door open and all I could see at first was the transparent frame of a person under the rain. I then saw the wet and muddy footprints of an invisible person entering the house and stopping at some distance. I released what I was holding, and slowly looked up, trembling and trying to see the face of the entity standing before me, when I suddenly heard heavy running footsteps rushing towards me. I dashed to my room, opened the window and found myself out of the house in a few seconds.\n\nI came back around one hour later with the police but all we could find were the wet and muddy footprints of the entity literally scattered around the house, and in all the rooms, all the walls, on the ceiling, just everywhere. Every door and window had been left open but nothing was stolen. I might have been skeptical up to that night but I was not crazy enough to continue staying there. Following the advice of my grandmother Margaret and even of one of the police officers, I moved the next day.\n\nWhat do you think of all that? I am curious to know. Maybe this is just one more banal scary story on the internet, right? Well, I have a little solicitation in my mind that I will not tell you about, but I would like to type yes in the comment section. After all, if you do not believe about all that, what can possibly happen to you if you just type yes?",

I guess this is something they found on one of those magazines that give tips on how to be a better parent. \n\nThe only thing that is a plus is that we moved near the beach, and let me say Miami beaches beat New York beaches. Well, i can't compare them yet, It's the middle of December!\n\nDiary entry no. 2.\n\nI finally finished unpacking, and I found a lot of awesome stuff from my past like my teddy bear from when I was 5 and my gameboy advance from ages ago. My parents let me hook up my Wii to my own TV in my room! I stayed up all night playing Wii sports until my parents came into my room and forced me to turn the TV off and write in my diary before bed.\n\nDiary entry no. 3. \n\nI started school today. The middle school was bigger than any school I've ever seen. Also I made new friends, kind of. Some fellow 8th graders gave me a map of the city and marked a corner of a park next to a forest and told me to meet them there, some sort of initiation, I guess. I asked my parents, and they said I could go since I was going to be with a group.\n\nDiary entry no. 4.\n\nAfter school, I rode my BMX bicycle to the park that was half a mile away. I got lost a few times, but the map helped me. When I got to the corner of the park next to the forest, I didn't see them, so I locked my bicycle, sat down, and decided to write a new entry. I am that bored.\n\nDiary entry no. 5.\n\nAfter a half hour of waiting, they finally show up. \n\n\"Hey James, over here.\" Jack, the leader of the group, yelled out to me.\n\nI nodded my head and ran over to them, excited to spend time with new people. When I got to him, he said that we were going into the woods to a secret hangout spot. \n\nWe walked for about 10 minutes until we saw a rusty run-down fence that was falling over. We crossed the fence, and inside, it was an old little league baseball stadium. The group and I sat down on some rusty bleacher.\n\n\"So how do you like this spot?\" Asked Sam. He had bright green hair, and that's the only way I remembered his name.\n\n\"It's pretty chill.\" I say, trying to sound as cool as possible.\n\nWe sat there for a couple of minutes, talking as they were asking me questions about what it was like where I used to live.\n\nAfter walking around the forest some more, we exit it onto a street in the slums. On that street, there was an abandoned hospital that the boys seemed eager to explore. \n\nThe doors were locked pretty hard, but the four of us managed to push it down. \n\nIt had everything you'd expect an abandoned hospital to have. Moldy beds, rusty tools, broken windows, etc.\n\nThey found an open door that had stairs that led down to a basement. Alex, the third member of the group dropped his fucking flashlight down the stairs and I think it was on purpose.\n\n\"Oops.\" He said\n\n\"James, why don't you go down and get it.\" Jack said\n\nI didn't want to be a pussy so I walked down the stairs to get it, the basement was dark so I couldn't see anything, however there was a putrid smell but when I got down I stepped on something.\n\nTeeth.\n\nI stepped on teeth. That was my main focus for a second before I heard the slam of a door. I turned around, and I could no longer see the group.\n\nThey fucking locked the doors.\n\nI think it's a prank, though, so I'm just going to sit on the stairs and write in my diary until they eventually unlock the door.\n\nDiary entry no. 6.\n\nI HEARD GROANS.\n\nThere were groans coming from the basement after a few hours of waiting.\n\nI decided I wasn't going to sit and find out what was there. So I started hitting against the lock with my flashlight until I heard the groans turn into grinding of teeth. The sound of someone grinding their teeth was getting closer and closer, so I started smashing the lock faster and faster. \n\nWhen the door opened, I saw a figure on the bottom stair moving his jaw back and forth, making the horrible grinding sound.\n\nI never ran as fast in my life. \n\nAway from the hospital to the park.\n\nWhen I got to the park, my bike was gone. The bastards that locked the door stole my bike. \n\nI had no choice but to sit on top of a slide and wait until morning or until my parents went out looking for me.\n\nDiary entry no. 7.\n\nI HEAR THE GRINDING OF TEETH.\n\n\n\nThe diary ends here. I am sharing what was written in the diary of James Agusto after this diary was found in a park next to a pile of teeth following the 13 year old's strange disappearance",

        "text": "Well, I was spending my afternoon reading NoSleep stories, which to me are usually hilarious, when I stumbled upon a strange one… [The USSR found something disturbing under the Pacific.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11g8n3r/the_ussr_found_something_disturbing_under_the/) Intriguing. When I finished reading it, I decided to write a post of my own. I was surprised one of those poor bastards in the submarine was still alive. Differently from what retired Major Lukashenko said, and yes, I know it’s you, Lukashenko, there are not a “few of us” left. There’s only one person, Lukashenko himself. How I know all of this? My name is Pyotr Lebdjev, and I was the KGB Officer charged with supervising and later censoring all information related to the Northern Pacific Great Fossil, or as they called it, the Maw of God. All members of that crew except for Lukashenko killed themselves or were executed.\n\nIf the Soviet Union was still a thing, merely mentioning all of this would be enough for a decade in Siberia, but now things have changed. First, I’m retired. Second, I don’t even live in Russia anymore. The whole country has become a massive mafia state and I left while I still could. Third, the Russian state already wants me dead anyway because they didn’t exactly allow me to leave, so I don’t think it matters. \n\nLet’s start from the beginning. The descent into the “Maw of God” happened, and they barely escaped alive. This can be read in Lukashenko’s post. After the expedition was when I took charge. The high command was very perturbed by the reports, but that was not when they decided to stop tests. In total, four expeditions were made into the Northern Pacific Great Fossil. The first, which Lukashenko already wrote about, and then three others headed by the Alternative Sciences Secretariat, an obscure branch of the KGB responsible for investigating possible paranormal phenomena.\n\nThe second and third expeditions were more successful than the first one. We were able to estimate the age of the creature at being approximately two billion years old. Tests inside the Maw itself confirmed two interesting facts: Once any sufficiently large object entered it, the teeth would gradually close in, blocking the exits, and the water would slowly be replaced by fluoroantimonic acid, but the tests proved that this period of replacement, which in the first expedition took nearly two months, was reduced to one month during the third expedition. Subsequent geothermal analysis concluded there was an exceptionally large living creature connected to the Maw, thirty miles below the sea level, deep into the trench. This creature was somehow connected to the teeth, even if they were not alive anymore by themselves. The second expedition believed there were underground tendrils connected to the teeth, but no evidence was presented. \n\nHowever, it’s debatable if the teeth were not really alive. This is because of a simple reason. The first submarine was able to exit blowing one of the teeth using a torpedo. The second expedition had to use four torpedoes. The third used around twenty. But the fourth submarine was never able to get out. Do you understand what I’m getting at? Not only the fossilized teeth were getting stronger somehow, the destroyed teeth themselves were completely replaced by the time a new expedition went in. \n\nThe Politburo was fascinated by these teeth. If we were able to find a way to use them, to research them, we would have the strongest tanks in the world. Fortresses that would be indestructible. Missile-proof cities. And our trains would never need maintenance, because their structure would regrow.\n\nThat’s why, in the October of 1983, six months after the first expedition, Project Maw was started. To guarantee secrecy, all information related to the project was sent via helicopter in letters to a KGB officer in Vladivostok who would make weekly summaries and send them to Moscow. I was this officer.\n\nProject Maw was an ambitious project. The oil platform would be transformed in the gateway to a massive underwater station, where the ground would be drilled and the teeth and its components studied, and if possible, even extracted.There wold be nearly a thousand workers and fifty of the best scientists in the country. In hindsight, this was a very dumb idea. The cost was exorbitant, and the scientists were pressured to provide results as fast as they could, causing many accidents and risking rushed and unsafe measures. A gamble by the Politburo that the profit would be so great that it would compensate the gargantuan losses. Well, in the end, this whole operation ended up being a small factor in the collapse of the Soviet Union because of the massive losses. Some even called it Eastern Chernobyl. \n\nAt first, the entire thing was pretty boring. Every two days, Director Puschinkin would send me a new letter. \"Comrade Lebdjev, a new underwater tunnel section was finished yesterday!\", \"Comrade Lebdjev, we have extracted new samples from the 15th teeth!\", \"Comrade Lebdjev, drilling operations have started in sector whatever!\". Yes, everything was terribly, terrifyingly boring during the first months. The only bad thing was that the workers and scientists were reporting nightmares, but that side effect was already known, and we believed it was derived from the isolation. If only it stayed the only bad thing.  \n\nIt was in the 19th day of February, 1984, when things changed. The helicopter pilot who every two days would go there with supplies and bring out the letters told me when he last went there, the entire facility was seemingly abandoned.\n\nThe next day, I personally went with a military helicopter to verify what was happening. I hoped that they were all at the underwater tunnels when the pilot came, but in my mind I knew something was very wrong. Upon arriving, I confirmed what the pilot said. The entirety of the former oil platform was empty, like if everyone had suddenly been evacuated. \n\nWhen we used the elevator to go to the underwater outpost, there was a violent scene expecting us. In the main corridor, there were hundreds of bodies, some of them in advanced decomposition. Like they had been dead for weeks. Walking among the bodies, there were naked people, covered in corals, algae and blood. Director Puschinkin was in the middle of this insanity, using a drill to perforate the eyes of a random worker, who was being held by other two of the algae-covered men. I didn't waste time trying to understand what happened. I immediately ordered my men to shoot everyone that moved. We then ran back to the elevator, and as soon as we exited it in the former oil rig, I personally shot the cables. The next thing, I entered the director's office, and took his computer. After that, we left as quickly as possible, and we used the helicopter guns to bombard the former oil rig until it collapsed into the ocean. As it fell, we could hear, even with the explosions and the helicopter loud noises, a gargantuan growling coming from deep beneath the sea.\n\nAs soon as I arrived back in Vladivostok I turned on the director’s computer. There were videos of the security cameras. These corals and algae had been growing on the people working there for weeks. There was not a single registered medical appointment to verify what was happening to everyone. More than 90% of everyone there had these maritime life things all over their bodies. The only people who had not were those who only stayed in the former oil rig, and rarely if ever went to the underwater tunnels. \n\nBut it wasn’t just that. For weeks they had been killing people using drills and pickaxes, and then walking over the bodies, like nothing was happening. Like they didn’t realize what was happening. No one even looked at the bodies, as if they were invisible. These killings occurred at random. One moment they were working together, then they were drilling the brain of someone, and then working again like nothing had happened.\n\nBut the worst of all were not the humans. It was the coral-like demons who roamed corridors in the underwater sections, sometimes in plain view, and no one noticed them. Every time one of them walked in one of the tunnels, a murder occurred not long after.\n\nImmediately, I asked my supervisor for help. He arranged a flight for me to Moscow the next day, and I had to go before the Politburo. That was maybe the most tense moment of my life. I had been in shootouts, I fought in Afghanistan, I had investigated other paranormal phenomenon, I had even infiltrated the Chinese secret service before, but that was rough. And I had to tell them: “I have destroyed the access to the facility, because the thing down there was somehow corrupting the workers. The footage shows that strange fish-beings were infiltrating the outpost, and people have been dying for weeks without anyone noticing.” \n\nSecretary General Chernenko, who had been brought from the hospital to the meeting and was furious, told me: “You’re saying you destroyed the entrance to a research facility that cost us billions of rubles because fish-demons were killing everyone? And that no one noticed?” Luckily, I had brought the director’s computer of me, and I showed them everything. The Politburo was as appalled as I was when I first saw the footage. Chernenko then said something like: “If this leaks, the population will not trust us anymore. Even if director Puschinkin didn’t told you what was really happening, it was your duty to keep us informed, and you failed. Listen to me, agent Lebdjev, and listen very well. You will eliminate every trace, every document, everything that could say Operation Maw happened.”\n\nI lost count of how many papers I burned, how many computers I dismantled, how many people I bribed. How many people I’ve “silenced”. And I will not lie. This was the easiest part. \n\nThings only got really difficult to cover up after the Petrova Incident in early 1987…\n\n[///](https://www.reddit.com/r/Matgamarra/)",
