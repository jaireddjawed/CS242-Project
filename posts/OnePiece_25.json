        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c8tlq0mfqzla1.png?width=451&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0b30eaf38f730265b430517a3010f3532019fc20\n\nStussy was revealed as MADS first successful clone key word successful. Which had me thinking is there a failure out there that was already introduced.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r6e6hf9w80ma1.png?width=296&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5f345b7245068ea42fc883e546bdfa63fe5cfb21\n\nMy main candidate is Edward Weevil, the supposed son of Whitebeard. A popular theory is that he is the failed clone of Whitebeard.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3pco1ytrzzla1.png?width=168&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1bb7cde44c23b454210090bf6d4ee93b1a96b21d\n\nIt seems like this has been bolstered by Miss Buckin's claim that Vegapunk could verify Weevil's relationship to Whitebeard. She was a member of the Rocks Pirates along with Whitebeard, part of MADS and was successfully cloned by them. A counter to this theory is that Weevil has a different blood type than Whitebeard. His blood type matches Miss Buckin which seems to confirm that he is her son but not Whitebeard's. I think there is an explanation for that.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b4s56w2490ma1.png?width=350&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f4dc0835ec3f931c87ef1b285732b3f2a7464cb5\n\nThe Seraphim although not explicitly stated, context clues point to them having Lunarian genes spliced into them. I think Weevil was MADS' first attempt at combining different bloodline elements into one person but failed. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0chkx75190ma1.png?width=507&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a5c97abb0daf3342f0a1e917df052d55e83c8362\n\nPythagoras speculated that bloodline elements record and individual's experiences which I took to mean clones possibly have the memories of the original. I think this will have future consequences.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mabwd69pj1ma1.png?width=200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4b34bd7d2139f31f69bc2e2ff8ca76090b8277d7\n\nIf my theory is true Weevil most likely has the bloodline elements of Miss Buckin and Whitebeard then a thought came to mind what about another person. Since cloning has gotten more attention in the story I've read theories about there being a Rocks clone. What if Weevil has the bloodline elements of Rocks.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4atv3ysupzla1.png?width=348&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=53571e91a17415a5c0f99174047ead04a437409d\n\nBonney has a interest technique called Distorted Future which gave her the physique of her father Kuma. It gave me the idea that Weevil could transform to look like Xebec.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vf5y6v1qk1ma1.png?width=436&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=78a69b975eccaca87dfa02870bfc0a4f6d16e516\n\nI think there are other hints to this. Shanks visited the Gorosei to discuss a pirate. A possible reason why is that the pirate works for them. And the scene reminded me of him going to Whitebeard to discuss Blackbeard. The last known location Shanks was on was a certain ruined island where the Red Pirates attended a wedding. Weevil is infamous for laying waste to towns.  Also it was during Levely that Rocks was first mentioned.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8tjdvtzk1ma1.png?width=443&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7095465467a1498f934ccbdbe65a7775011e65c4\n\nThen there is Garp's statement about how events will find away to surpass the World Government's imagination when talking about Rocks.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dachgx1kq1ma1.png?width=368&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4fd04f25437b42f7ea6b62df61feae14a870b64e\n\nThe dream koi from Wano ended up being hint about Kaido's Devil Fruit power.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ou4ko4fq1ma1.png?width=392&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=69c6471ce2c5302e178e49dceca071923e20d41d\n\nWhitebeard's home island is named Sphinx and is populated by said creatures. Weevil defended the island and is supposedly  linked to Whitebeard. Maybe it is a small hint that Weevil is a genetic chimera.",

        "text": "So I'm currently reading the manga for the first time, but I have already watched the anime twice.\n\nI just got to Long Ring Long Land (LRLL) and Tonjit mentions that once a year LRLL  gets uncovered when the tides in the island are at their lowest. Even though his nomad tribe actually travels every three years they are able to travel each year between the pieces of land that make up the whole LRLL.\n\nThen, when the Strawhats travel to the next island (Water 7) it turns out that Water 7 gets struck every year by a huge wave. These two events must be connected. Even in Water 7 the water around the island recedes for a while to form part of Aqua Laguna, and as LRLL is close to Water 7, the water that recedes from there must be part of the water that gets collected into Aqua Laguna.\n\nThis must mean that every year the time of Aqua Laguna must be the same time Tonjit's nomad tribe are able to travel between the areas of LRLL.\n\nI just realized this and I don't know if it has been noticed before.",

It is a mysterious treasure chest, hidden away on the legendary island of Raftel, which can only be found by following the clues left behind by the previous Pirate King, Gol D. Roger.\n\nInside the treasure chest lies a powerful and ancient artifact known as the \"World Key\". This key has the ability to unlock the true potential of the world's oceans, allowing the holder to control and manipulate them at will.\n\nBut the true power of the One Piece lies not in the World Key itself, but in the knowledge and understanding that comes with discovering it. The treasure chest contains the accumulated knowledge and secrets of the world, including the true history of the Void Century and the origins of the world's most powerful organizations, such as the World Government and the Marines.\n\nThe discovery of the One Piece and the knowledge contained within it would change the course of history and allow the Pirate King to create a new world order, one where freedom and justice reign supreme. This is the ultimate goal of Luffy and his crew, and the reason why the One Piece is such an important and coveted treasure.",

Or perhaps a panel from the manga that would fit well here? Hoping to keep the artwork as simple as possible as well since space is limited.",

        "text": "Hi All,\nI'm looking to buy the dubbed DVDs and am wondering the best/most cost effective way to go about it. I would usually just watch the subbed eps but I recently got my wife into it. We were breezing through the dubbed versions but now that we've made it to a point where only the subs are available we've come to a slow crawl. I've looked at Amazon and other outlets to buy the DVDs but there are so many different options that I want to make sure I'm not buying the same sets, make sure the sets I'm buying are dubbed, and also that they are the most cost effective. Any help you can offer would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you!",

You know like the Victual Brothers, the Brethren of the Coast, and the Flying Gang.  It should be made up of not just the Straw Hat Grand Fleet but every pirate crew and criminal group they consider friends, including the Revolutionary Army.  It could be the biggest pirate organization to ever sail the seas.  I even know of a perfect name for it, one that is both nice and intimidating, one that will both strike fear into the dark heart of the evil World Government and, in the words of Calico Yorki, bring a smile to every child.  \"The Brethren of the One Piece\"",
