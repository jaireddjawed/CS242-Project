        "text": "Hello engineers! Like it says in the title, I'm a first time Mechanical Engineering Co-Op participant and just recently received my assignment. I'm a little bit confused and stuck on making a plan to complete my assignment, however, and I'm here for some advice from professionals.\n\nWithout going into too much detail, I have to identify cheaper parts of a piece of machinery I'm working on using the engineering assembly drawings and part drawings. However, many of these parts do NOT have drawings, and are only given a part number in the assembly. These part numbers rarely (if ever - I haven't found one yet) match general part numbers found online. There is also very limited information on these parts. For example, a part I was just looking at has the part name \"Pneumatic Vibrator\" and the material \"Aluminum\" and the part number. That is ALL that is given, no drawings, and the part number has no match on any reputable parts site. Without a drawing and a global part number to reference, I'm stuck on what to do.\n\nThe only option I can think of is visiting the site and manually checking the parts in question, measuring the dimensions, and calling vendors to see if they have exact specifications. Any help from experienced engineers would be appreciated, thanks!!",

        "text": "**About The Company**\n\nI'm relatively new to my role and I am finally in a position where I can influence our project, network, and folder structure, so i am looking for a bit of advice on what works (or does not work) for your team.  Our facility is small and autonomous (\\~100 ppl, 30 engineers), but we have a large parent company (\\~100k ppl).  We have products and do a lot of R&amp;D.  R&amp;D includes proposals and multiple project phases that we try to push to product.  Our R&amp;D is for government, commercial, and corporate sponsors. Engineering is ME, Aero, EE, FW, SW.\n\n**Current File Structure**\n\nA particular challenge we have is a lot of disorganization in our file system.  A few years ago we rolled out Teams due to COVID / WFH, which has started to further fracture our file system.  Before that, we had box for a few people and VPN available for everyone.  The vast majority of our files were shared servers (\"R&amp;D Projects\", \"Products\", etc).  Under \"R&amp;D Projects\" most opportunities had a dedicated folder for the project.  \"Lift Gate\", \"Fish Pump\", \"Laser Power Supply\", \"Laser Power Supply Phase II\", etc.  In each project folder there are sub folders for \"Design\", \"Presentations\", \"Testing\", \"Reports\", \"Project Management\", etc.  Proposals for that project are often in there as are proposals for follow on work.  \n\nThe project Channels in Teams does not have consistent use.  Some projects are heavily in Teams, others are not in teams at all.  The structure of the Teams Channel is not predetermined as our network structure is.  There is often redundancy and overlap.\n\nWe are also using Confluence, mainly on the EE side for project content, task lists, etc.\n\nSoftware and firmware is on git, which the exception of things like matlab scripts and other smaller tools used by a small subset of non-software folks.\n\nIf a proposal doesn't make it to a full project, it usually stays with other proposals in the Business Development area of our network/Teams.  Proposals and white papers live in a few different business development folders both on the network and within a Teams Team.  They are sometimes categorized by technology, thrust area, or customer.  \n\n**Current Actions**\n\nOn the product side, we generally have better organization and controls, but there is a lot of improvements to be made there.  We are in the process of rolling out document management software for version control.  There are active discussions about what will life in that software, but at a minimum it will be solidworks models, drawings, etc.  I think manufacturing procedures make a lot of sense to put in there as well as a few other items.\n\nWe recently implemented dedicated project management to the team, so those people should be able to help keep things organized as we move forward.\n\n**Open Questions/Tasks**\n\n* Priority number one is ensuring whatever we decide is followed up on and enforced.\n* Determine what files will (will not) go in document control software\n* Determine what files are appropriate for teams vs the network\n* As we accumulate a lot of projects, how do we handle them in teams as the number continues to grow?\n* Is there a smooth way to link the network to teams?\n* Is there a better way to organize and track white papers and proposals?  They need to be easy to find and easy to access when the project starts.\n* Does it make sense to get proposals into DDM so we have a solid record of what was proposed?\n* get the team on a single \"action item\" approach.  Whether it is confluence, teams planner, etc.  The whole team being there has value\n* how should finance documents be stored and sorted?  Quotes, POs, packing lists, etc. are often referenced later in the project and for future proposals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny insight into how your company structures your files, particularly into the R&amp;D space would be very helpful as we move through this transition.",

        "text": "Hi, I am making an underwater robot (ROV), and right now I'm tackling the challenge of adding buoyancy to it. I have a box-shaped housing that I need to fill with some material that is lightweight, does not absorb water, and does not collapse under pressure of up to 8 bars.\n\nWhat I tried so far:\n\n1. Casting PU foam, 75g/m\\^3 - unfortunately it absorbs tons of water (62% by weight).\n2. Casting PU foam, 400g/m\\^3 - also absorbs water, not as much, but still a lot (28%).\n3. Purpose-made [pressure foam](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/254456621413), 200g/m\\^3 - surprisingly, also absorbs water (10%). Far less than PU, but still unacceptable.\n4. Glass microspheres + paraffin wax. I melted the wax, mixed with microspheres, and cast it into the housing. I tried ratios of wax:microspheres by weight of 1:1 (375g/m\\^3), 1:1.5 (405g/m\\^3), 1:2 (423g/m\\^3) and 1:2.5 (497g/m\\^3). At 8 bars of pressure, the 1:1 mix absorbed 28% of water (by mass), 1:1.5 absorbed 22%, 1:2 absorbed 5%, and 1:2.5 absorbed 1.5%. Meaning that basically only the 1:2.5 (497g/m\\^3) mix is usable, which is a bit on the heavy side.\n\nThe glass microsphere experiment looks promising, but it seems to me that wax does not bind microspheres well enough, leaving enough air that the water then fills. I am going to try epoxy next, but from experience I know that it is very difficult to mix epoxy well with that much microspheres - the mixture becomes crumbly, and almost impossible to mix thoroughly without specialized equipment.\n\nCan anyone suggest some other binding materials that I could use with microspheres instead of wax/epoxy to get somewhere around &lt;300g/m3 with water absorption of less than 2%?\n\nP.S. I did consider using wax+microspheres at 1:1 by weight, filling the housing with it, and then coating it with epoxy to prevent water ingress. But epoxy is a mess to work with, and any damage to the coating will leak the water in.\n\nP.P.S. In my previous ROV, I used PVC pipes with permanent plugs at each end, and custom-shaped hollow housings. Unfortunately since I 3D-print most of my parts (both housings and plugs), I still had to use epoxy to seal them, and it was a terrible experience. At high pressures water still finds ways inside. I learned that the only way to deal with this is to have a truly non-absorbing material that does not rely on sealant coats. And in any case the geometry of my current ROV does not allow for PVC pipes.",

I am planning to build a small pond and I am struggling to find the right materials and techniques for lining it. I have come across different options such as rubber liners, concrete, clay, and even rumors of new materials like liners made from recycled plastic bottles or a special type of clay that is more durable than traditional clay.  However, I can't help but feel that something sinister is going on behind the scenes, like some kind of conspiracy to keep the \"real\"  solutions a secret. I've even heard a wild rumor that there's a secret government-made liner that's made from alien technology and can withstand any kind of weather and leaks. I know it sounds crazy but after taking a lot of Benadryl, my mind is all over the place and I  can't shake off the feeling that there's something more to it.  My mind is starting to feel like a muddle as I've been up for three days trying to verify all the information I find. I want to make sure I am making the right choice for my backyard pond, but I'm not sure what to believe or who to trust.  Another concern of mine is how to prevent leaks and ensure the pond is watertight. I would greatly appreciate any advice or tips on building a  backyard pond. Thank you in advance for your help.",

        "text": "Greetings Engineers! I come to you today with a question that has been vexxing me (and probably others at /r/bowyers) for some time - given a \"pyramid\" style bow design, how can you calculate the precise falloff in limb width in order to minimize the need for tillering?\n\nA well made bow will distribute weight equally across all points on the working limb, resulting in a smooth curve when fully drawn. A [pyramid bow](https://content.instructables.com/FKK/XVUT/G6MPGZ9M/FKKXVUTG6MPGZ9M.jpg) is intended to have a uniform thickness along the entire limb, so the weight distribution is managed via a linear taper from the fades to the tip. [A typical design](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f3/97/56/f39756fdba2fdbbaab41258a021067a8.jpg) might have 30 inch long working limbs that go from 2 inches at the fade to .5 inches at the tip with a consistent thickness of .5 inches along the entire length. This design might work for osage wood, however, be completely inappropriate for red oak. The purpose of my question is to determine how to calculate the best design for a given length and wood type.\n\nTo keep things simple, let's assume that we want to build a pyramid bow from a red oak board purchased at our local Home Depot. For the sake of argument, we'll say that the board is perfectly straight grained and has no imperfections. So, according to the wood database, we can assume the following:  \n\n\n***Red Oak:***  *Specific Gravity: 0.56       Janka Hardness: 5430 Newtons      Modulus of Rupture: 99.2 MPa     Elastic Modulus: 12.14 GPa        Crushing Strength:  46.8 MPa*\n\nSo, is there a series of equations I can use to help me determine the best dimensions to start with in order to minimize the amount of time I have to spend on the tillering tree? (If it helps, assuming a 68\" total length and a target draw weight of 45 lbs@29\" is pretty reasonable).\n\nFWIW, I have a minor in Applied Mathematics, so I'm comfortable with differential equations, but I feel like there's probably a simpler solution than that, but I'm not familiar enough with structural engineering problems to work it out.",

I should've at least graduated in a 4 1/2 year span, but personal problems got to me. My main concern right now is the amount of money I've been wasting and how long I've been in school.

My mom, dad, brother and other family members always seem disappointed that I still haven't graduated.......anyways I would greatly appreciate some insight.",

I've got some experience with soldering, 3d printing, and I've set up a raspberry pi before. \n\nI was looking into focus rails (small rails you mount the camera to that are basically a gear on a rack with little dials on either side so you can precisely move the camera towards or away from a fixed point in space.)\n\n It's a good tool because macro lenses have a very narrow focus area; so if you take multiple photos moving towards the subject, you get 10-20 images you can combine using software tools for an excellent highly detailed shot. \n\nI use a mirrorless camera with a burst shooting mode (13 frames per second), and I realized I could advance more quickly while continuously shooting, rather than taking a single photo, adjusting the rail, then taking another photo. \n\nThe only issue is I don't have hand control that precise, so I need some kind of electronic assistance. Focus rails similar to what I've describe exist, but they're usually ~400 and I just don't have the budget for that.\n****\n\nI figure a stepper motor would be a great candidate for using to modify a basic focus rail. I could basically attach a lead screw from a 3d printer Z axis, to use to advance my camera forward at a fixed rate. The focus rail top half + camera would weigh around 3.5lbs.\n\nSo basically, I'm wondering if someone could suggest a way I directly control a stepper motor with physical \"forwards and backwards\" buttons and a speed control so I could calibrate the motor to advance in sync with my camera's burst fire mode for easier macro capture?",

I am interested in the stresses and deformation of the wheel parts.\n\n**Question 1**\n\nThe Solidworks Simulation help states \"generally if the frequency of a load is larger than 1/3 of the lowest (fundamental) frequency, a dynamic study should be used.\"\n\nAs I don't have harmonic loading, what does the 'frequency of a load' refer to in terms of a one-time impact? I imagine you convert the speed of the impact to frequency??\n\n**Question 2**\n\nAm I correct in thinking the following rules apply when choosing between the simulation types for dynamical systems:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Linear Static - can be used      if the frequency of a load is smaller than 1/3 of the lowest (fundamental)      frequency, the materials are stressed below their elastic limit, there are      no large deformations and there are no changes to the states of each contact      over time.\n* Linear Dynamic (Modal Time      History) - if the frequency of a load is larger than 1/3 of the lowest      (fundamental) frequency, but the materials are stressed below their      elastic limit, there are no large deformations and there are no changes to      the states of each contact over time.\n* Nonlinear Dynamic - if the      frequency of a load is larger than 1/3 of the lowest (fundamental)      frequency, and either the materials are stressed above there elastic      limit, there are large deformations, and/or there are changes to the states      of each contact over time.\n* Explicit Dynamic - if the      frequency of a load is larger than 1/3 of the lowest (fundamental)      frequency, and there is a great level of plastic deformation.\n\n**Question 3**\n\n**3a.** To use a Linear Dynamic (Modal Time History) simulation to study an impact you first would use a rigid-body simulation to find the graph of forces on the wheel over time. Then you would apply this forces over time data to your Linear Dynamic (Modal Time History) FEA?\n\n**3b.** To use a Linear Static (using the 1/3 of the lowest (fundamental) frequency assumption) simulation to study an impact, you first calculate the worst impact force and apply this in the study, or do you find the average impact force over the timespan of the impact?\n\nThanks!",

If it worked really well, I could imagine just picking up some dusty items, giving them a shake or a puff of compressed air, and not regretting it immediately.\n\nI was considering trying something similar for dealing with dust (from, for example, sanding, as well as the endless flurry of cat hair). Does that general approach actually work? Can a cooling fan produce enough suction to pull air through the filters?

        "text": "Okay. I have an application where I am clamping a thing between two metal plates. There are 3 screws, one on the left side and two on the right. All three are torqued to the same value. \n\nBased on the deflection visible in the assembly that improves with reducing the torque on the side with the two screws, I am relatively sure that the clamp force applied on that side is 2x or so. In my head if I draw a lil beam with the forces, that's how it makes sense to me but I can't tell if I'm right and I can't actually remember how clamp force works, and Google is NOT helping 😅",

        "text": "I am wondering if anybody can provide some reason why I need to have a field breaker on my hydro generators - given some below context;\n\nI currently have two small hydro units running in a plant. The 'pilot' current/voltage is supplied by an excitation controller which is powered from our station service in lieu of a PMG or Shunt PT. The pilot supply to the rotating exciter is interrupted in the event of a system trip or any normal shutdown before it gets to the rotating exciter by means of a contactor.\n\nSince I am already removing my pilot/AVR field supply from the exciter do I really need to have a field breaker as well? Some of our plants have them and some don't so not entirely sure if I have to replace the one I am currently looking at potentially removing. Any links to existing standards would be great - very challenging to find anything.",

        "text": "I'm a control systems engineer and I graduated 3.5 years ago. I often supervise and help a graduate engineer who has 1.5 years experience but I am not the one mainly responsible for giving her feedback. and I'm not in a senior position. But I feel like I have alot of visibility of how she is doing because she's coming to me for questions alot of the time and I'm reviewing her work.\n\nI've noticed some issues with her performance. She is doing fine but Im wondering if there is more I can do to help her improve.\n\nSome of the issues include:\n- Submitting work with obvious errors which to me indicates she is not checking her work properly. Maybe I should tell her to check over her work before submitting it?\n- Quite reliant on me to solve the more difficult problems. I understand that is normal for a graduate but I'm concerned she is too reliant on me and that she's not learning how to solve the more difficult problems herself even though I'm showing her how I solve the problem. Maybe I should give her general advice on problem solving and how to solve these issues herself/ but im not sure what that advice would be?\n- she's not a native English speaker and the other day she had to remove a page from a pdf. She wasn't sure if she should use the merge pdf or split pdf option which to me indicates her English skills are not great and it could be the source of many of her struggles. I think she's doing English classes so maybe no feedback is necessary on this point.\n\nDo you think I should give her feedback or change my approach to supervising her? Is there any advice you would give her if you were in my shoes? Ive been making sure she is aware when she makes errors so she has a chance to reflect and improve but I feel weird about giving specific feedback because I've only just graduated 3.5 years ago and so I'm not sure if it's appropriate. But I also feel that she's not getting the same level of guidance that I did when I was a graduate. Because I had a lead engineering reviewing all my work and giving me feedback whereas she has me reviewing alot of her work who doesn't have as much experience and new to this whole mentoring thing.",
