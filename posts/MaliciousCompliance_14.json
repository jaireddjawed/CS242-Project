On Christmas day my mother said I could only listen to Christmas music. My teenage self put together the worst Christmas songs I could find. \"I'm gonna kill Santa Claus\", \"The Christmas Knife Game Song\", \"Jingle Bombs\", and the ever petty \"Seasons Greetings\" for example. They swore, wished for trees to burn, and generally weren't a happy Christmas song.\n\nMy only regret is I feared my mother to much to listen to it without earbuds. It was a victory in my head though! The rule is still standing so maybe someday I'll play it, since I have more songs I would add now.",

        "text": "\"In August [Valerie Haney told the Church of Scientology](https://tonyortega.org/2022/08/28/valerie-haney-names-tom-cruise-for-arbitrator-and-shelly-miscavige-if-tom-is-busy/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email) that if she could not have Elisabeth Moss as an arbitrator in her dispute with the church, then she was nominating Tom Cruise, with Shelly Miscavige as a backup.\n\nOnce again, after the church demanded that Valerie turn in a nomination in short order, it has taken much longer for Scientology to respond.\n\nIt turns out that Tom Cruise and Shelly Miscavige are also not available, Scientology says. And the reason why? Well, that’s the interesting part.\n\nValerie, a former Sea Org officer who escaped from Scientology’s secretive “Int Base” in 2016 by hiding in the trunk of a car, filed her lawsuit against the church in June 2019, alleging that she had been held against her will as an employee at the base, and also that she had endured years of intimidation, harassment, and libel once she decided to speak out about her experiences.\n\nAfter her escape, Valerie went to work for actress and former Scientologist Leah Remini as her assistant, and she was featured as the surprise subject to kick off the third and final season of Remini’s A&amp;E series, *Scientology and the Aftermath*.\n\nScientology successfully derailed Valerie’s lawsuit when it convinced Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Richard Burdge in 2020 that while Valerie was an employee she had signed contracts which obliged her not to sue Scientology in a civil court, but instead to take any grievance to Scientology’s own internal brand of “religious arbitration.”\n\nShe spent a couple of years trying to overturn Burdge’s order, but a new judge in the case, Judge Gail Killefer, found that Valerie needed to begin the arbitration process or risk having her lawsuit tossed altogether.\n\nSo on July 1 she submitted a letter to Scientology formally asking the arbitration process to begin. The first step in that process is to select a panel of three arbitrators, who must all be Scientologists in good standing. Valerie is allowed to propose an arbitrator, Scientology selects the second, and then those two arbitrators choose a third. All of this is overseen not by the court but by Scientology’s “International Justice Chief,” a man named Mike Ellis.\n\nIn that July 1 letter, Valerie, who has made it clear she objects to the entire process, selected as her proposed arbitrator Scientologist actress Elisabeth Moss.\n\nIn August, Ellis responded by telling her in a letter that “the arbitrator you designated to hear and resolve your claims in Scientology religious arbitration declined the nomination to serve as an arbitrator.”\n\nIn other words, Ellis was claiming that Moss was actually informed of Valerie’s choice, but turned it down. And Ellis added that Valerie had 15 days to reply with another nomination.\n\nIn her reply, written with her attorney Bobby Thompson, Valerie nominated actor Tom Cruise, and if he was busy, Shelly Miscavige, the wife of church leader David Miscavige who vanished in 2005 and has been seen in public only one confirmed time later, at the funeral of her father in 2007.\n\nNearly two months later, Ellis finally sent a response.\n\nIt starts out by complaining that Valerie’s letter was an insert in a cover letter from her attorney. Ellis chastises her for this, reminding her that according to “Scientology Ethics and Justice procedures,” she’s supposed to be communicating with him directly and without an attorney’s help.\n\nAfter that whine, Ellis gets to the point:\n\n&gt;Through the attorney letter, you provided the names of two prominent Scientologists to serve as your arbitrators. You (or your agents) provided that letter to the media, causing lurid coverage by tabloids and an anti-Scientology blogger.\n\nLurid coverage on the fringes of the Internet! The outrage!\n\nAfter some more carping about how Scientology’s precious ethics procedures have been violated, Ellis once again gets around to the reason we’re all here:\n\n&gt;Neither your second nor third choice of arbitrator are available, and given your penchant for leaking to the media I am not providing you with the reasons.\n\nOh, snap!\n\nAnd just to put a fine point on it, Ellis pouts…\n\n&gt;Nobody will be willing to sit as an arbitrator if he or she will be the subject of your publicity machinations.\n\nWell, that’s just a shame, isn’t it?\n\nWe can hardly wait to see who Valerie nominates next. Who do you think it should be, gang?\"  \n\n\nFrom Tony Ortega, Scientology Beat Reporter, [The Underground Bunker](https://tonyortega.org/scientology/)",

One of the houses she cleaned was owned by a very strict, no-nonsense, ex-military lady. My mom cleaned her house about once a week for a few months, but they were never on very friendly terms.\n\nThe owner of the house had a lot of boxes full of paperwork and other miscellaneous items. She would occasionally ask my mom to organize some of them, but whenever my mom asked where she wanted a particular box or folder of paperwork, the lady would just say \"put it anywhere, I'll find it.\"\n\nThis happened a few times as my mom would try to clean around the boxes. She always asked if the owner would like certain papers/boxes in a particular place so she could keep track of it, and it was always the same, impatient and somewhat annoyed response \"put it anywhere\"\n\nOne day, the owner of the house was moving some of the boxes around, presumably looking for something. She asked my mom for some help, and in her search, my mom noticed that the owner had dropped her keys into one of the boxes. (I believe she had just came inside from her car, but I still don't understand how her keys ended up in a box.) \n\nSo my mom picks up the keys, and says to the iwner who was across the room, says \"Hey 'Owner', I -\"\n\nBut \"owner\", without turning around, interuppted her by yelling \"I DON'T CARE 'my mom's name,' LIKE I'VE SAID, JUST PUT IT ANYWHERE!\" Assuming my mother was going to ask her about some files/boxes.\n\nSo my mom nodded, said okay, and abruptly turned around, walked downstairs, and threw the owner's set of keys into the freezer and left. She didn't say another word and never heard from the owner of that house again.\n\n\nTL;DR: My mom was obnoxiously told many times to \"put items anywhere\" and did just that when she found her boss's keys and threw them in her freezer.",

        "text": "This happened a few years ago at a restaurant I worked at. Long story short we had a newer night manager, I’ll call him M. He was about 25 and a bit of a creep. He was always sleezy and showed favoritism. If you were a cute girl and flirted with him or a dude and his bro you were on his good list. If you didn’t want to do certain tasks or called out without a cover than no problem! \n\nHowever, if you were anyone who didn’t flirt back or kiss his ass then let’s say you were on his “shit list”. Those on that list being the ones given the worst shifts and tasks that came with even more complimentary BS provided by M. From day one M tried to flirt with me and I was friendly but did not reciprocate. Very shortly I was moved to the “shit list”. M would go out of his way to piss me off, especially if I got scheduled with his buddies and no one to share the blunt force with. M would even make snarky comments about me from the sidelines as he watched me bust my ass running back and forth from the kitchen. I could see him giggle his ass off. I remember his last sly one about my weight that he tried to desperately shy off when I called him out. Yeah, he was a real douche\n\n\n\nAnyways, I found a new job and put in my 2 weeks with another manager (one who was respectful). Well M also being a manager was told this. I had not told anyone I worked with yet and was going to after my shift. Well Low and behold another coworker runs up to me and asks: “Today is your last day?!”. I pulled them aside and quietly said, “no but who said that? I didn’t tell anyone yet”.\n\nCoworker: “M came up to everyone smoking out back and just blurted it out to us. He was even laughing and smiling about it”\n\nThen a couple more coworkers walk up saying the same thing! \n\nI was pissed. I had been nothing but respectful to this man regardless of everything. Worked my ass off every shift, even went beyond to help everyone out. Yet he celebrates me leaving and invades my privacy by shouting it in his excitement?! All because of what? Because I didn’t give him attention?! \n\n\nI was naive back then and he did so much I should’ve reported. Yet in that moment I decided not another second will I stay quiet. I made sure to go to the back office where the managers were including the GM, M and a lot of other staff. I called out to M loud enough for all to hear\n\nMe: “So todays my last day M?! Is that so? I didn’t even know that”\n\nM: *O_O silent \n\nMe: “I actually just put in my two weeks today. Yet since you couldn’t wait to spoil that to everyone I will consider today my last day! Just for you! since you were so excited about it!\n\nThe GM pulled me aside. I explained what just happened and all the BS M had put myself and others through. That I knew others have complained of M, yet clearly nothing was done. I apologized, thanked him for the opportunity and kept my word as my last day\n\n\nAfter that I heard M changed his tune. They also made him fill in some of my shifts due to being suddenly short staffed",

        "text": " When I worked at a POPULAR Fast Food chain the Manager and I had it out multiple times, to truly understand I will go over each 1. First was due to B (the Manager) mistreating my ex T, due to the fact he had a thing for me and she was my GF.  After about a month of it I lost it on him, I called him out about it and made it clear that I am straight so no matter what I will not ever do anything with a guy.  I also told him if he didn't start treating her fairly.  By the next day he was not only fair with her but she could do no wrong, &amp; I went from doing no wrong to never doing anything right.   \n  Now about a month later I was not Feeling well and when  tried to call off I was told by B that I MUST come in or I will be fired. Part way through my shift I went to hit the restroom to relieve myself and return to work. As I headed towards the restroom B stepped in my way and told me to get back to the grill, I let him know that I had to hit the restroom quick cause I am not feeling the greatest.  B said to just push through it and get back to my station.  All of this is going down right by the fry bin in full view of EVERYONE and it is the Beginning of the dinner rush.  I looked at T and she even tried to tell B it would be best to just let me go quick.  B laughed and said I was just trying to get out of work, I responded with that if he doesn't let me go now he will regret it.  B just continued to laugh and said that there's nothing I could do. WELL I agreed to not go to the restroom and let him know that we had seconds left. While he was laughing I vomited up blood all over him, the floor and it hit the surrounding counters (when I worked fast food I got ulcers which always led to vomiting up blood from the ulcer)  this was the first time it actually happened so I didn't know exactly what will happen. Since It was in front of everyone and he had to reimburse EVERYONE their money and close the store in the beginning of the dinner rush.  A couple days later the owners came in to find out what happened and after speaking to staff that was there and watching the Camera they had him finish up the day and transferred him to another location.   \n  One of the thing he had to do that day was the schedule so he thought he would get the last laugh and schedule my that Saturday (which I had in writing that I do not work cause I was taking EMT Classes every Saturday and walked 10 mile to and from) . Everyone knew that I was “calling off” due to that and after getting home I had a couple of cold ones, when I received a call from 1 of the AM's saying 2 other people called off and really needed me to come in. I let her know that I was already drinking and being under the influence of anything was grounds for immediate termination, she came back with she didn't care that they really need the help and an intoxicated me is still better then an 2 people they might get and that she will pick me up and bring me home. I told her I will not stop drinking till she got there.  A little it after the owners personal manager (an area manager for them over their stores not from corporate) came in cause she heard about the short staffing and noticed me there and asked questions.  The AM admitted to everything with our conversation and then I noticed she started to ask other employees questions but never came to me.  I came to find out that the next day B was FIRED for creating an unsafe work environment and sex harassment.   \n  Turns out she was asking about what happened between me and B and they ALL said about his mistreatment of T and how I called him out then the 180%.",

        "text": "Some background:\nI'm in Australia, I'm currently a 32 year old male and this occurred this year. \n\nI used to do admin work in Defence and during that time I got rather qualified and experienced. Specifically in people management and training people. I then left the uniform for various reasons including depression caused by my time there.\n\nI got a new job and intentionally got a position way below my capabilities so I could focus on my mental health while still working. It was a hotline for a government assistance programme.\n\nThis position was good for about 4 years. Over that time I started using some of my skills more and built up my confidence again. I also was acting in higher positions almost the entire time.\n\n\nInitiating incident:\nSo after all the Covid lockdowns finally finished there was a permanent spot in a higher position available. By this time I was the longest serving person remaining in the team and I was the most qualified. I knew they planned on getting the incumbent to do 2 roles, both of which I knew thoroughly.\n\nWent through the interview process, answered all the questions, explained how I could do the role immediately without training, etc. Had to wait a few weeks to find out the result since it's still government and they don't do these things super fast.\n\nThen I got told that I was found not suitable. I was floored. I asked for an explanation and all I was told was \"it was a very competitive round.\" When I asked what I could have done to be more competitive I got the same answer.\n\nTo make things worse they asked me to train the guy who got the role. Immediately I brought up the duty statement which had the list of tasks for my role (remember it's super easy, basically just answer the phone and reply to emails). I also got out the public service level expectations and highlighted the appropriate bits for my level.\n\n\nCue malicious compliance\nSince I wasn't suitable to work at higher levels, I immediately stopped all work that wasn't at my level or in my job description.\n\nTo say this put a dent into the extra work I was doing would be an understatement. I used to help out management with sorting out interpersonal disputes, I used to run a bunch of reports to find and sort out work that was missed, and I used to help the other teams do their work.\n\nSo at this point my days became super easy. I would do about 10% of what I used to as that 10% was my actual job. \n\nThe training I was doing was directing the guy to the procedures and if he had questions directing him to ask a supervisor.\n\nIt was about a week of this before management noticed the training wasn't very in depth. One by one they asked me what was going on. Our structure had 6 supervisors at the time. Each and everytime I said the same thing. \"Unfortunately I was found unsuitable for the role so I can't teach someone how to do it.\"\n\nTo say they were pissed would also be an understatement. But they tried to stay professional.\n\nThey then started questioning why I stopped doing all the extra work that I had been doing for years. I directed their attention to my duty statement and asked where it lists that work. They said the extra duties as directed. I then asked how that aligns with the level expectations (which are surprisingly clear and helpful). At this point most stopped trying.\n\nDuring all this sudden free time I had I started to search for a new job. It only took 2 weeks to go for interviews, be found suitable and get a new job. Apparently I'm incredibly competitive at this level. Who knew?\n\n\nThe fallout:\nThe new job is significantly easier, at the level I was \"unsuitable\" for and gives me much more money than they were offering.\n\nAdditionally, I have kept in touch with some people there, the management are floundering as interpersonal problems are cropping up, the team can't keep up with the work load and at least 3 more people have gotten new jobs with at least 2 looking for other employment, leaving 1 person left in the hotline team that will know what they're doing.\n\nIt's a shame really because I liked that programme and probably would have stayed for a long time.\n\nTL:DR\nI was found unsuitable to work at higher levels so I stopped working at higher levels, watched things break while I got a new job at the higher level.",

        "text": "When I was between undergrad and grad school, I worked for a year as a secretary in a Wealth Management Firm. Now, if you're like me and thinking 'what is that' the answer is that it's a bunch of suck-up wannabe stockbrokers that mostly kiss ass of ultra wealthy people and do kitschy things like golf with them and throw them elaborate holiday parties so that they can take a percentage scraping of their portfolio's interest that year. Sounds harsh, I know, but these are NOT high yield or unstable portfolios that require a lot of tending. These are \"here's forty million dollars, please put it in a low risk investment account and send me the interest as my annual income, plus half a percentage (or whatever) for yourself.\" Most accounts were reviewed annually. \n\nNow I was 23-24, and a woman. I was younger than most of the partners' children, which made me the *perfect* target for all sorts of gruntwork, sexist BS and being hit on (things like take my car to be washed / go buy me a salad and pick yourself something sweet / bring me a coffee and crawl under my desk to fix my printer / pick up my dry cleaning / buy my kids christmas gifts / oh your hair is so soft / I like the way that dress looks...on your body) Some aspects of my job required data entry, spreadsheets/basic excel, basic budget/finance, outlook, and client relations (e.g. making coffee for the wealthy people and offering to change the tv channel in the lobby). I made $18 an hour and I'll happily admit all my \"work\" for the entire week could be accomplished in 2 hours in one day, or in 20 minutes every morning. This led to me writing a lot of fanfiction, devouring PDFs of books four hours (I read all 42 Discworld novels back to back), and just generally clicking through popular social media of the day. \n\nMid year, the entire office staff (15-20 people) including the only two other women in the office (office manager and \"marketing\" person - e.g. a wife, both 50s) flew from US to the UK to woo a huge, super wealthy client. There was absolutely no need to take everyone, but the head owner of this firm, who I will call 'Howie Jim' and willingly went by his first/middle name &amp; abbreviated to HJ unironically, decided that it was a good 'morale boost' and 'bonding experience' for everyone. Partners were also encouraged to bring spouses/children as desired. Everyone was excited to go. Everyone, of course, but me. \n\nOh, a ton of excuses were made; \"this is a family trip\" and \"this trip was planned a year ago before you were here\" and \"all of these people are paying for their families, it'd be unfair if you were paid for by the company\" etc. etc. But the reality is there would be 0 excuse for me to do anything on the trip except order more company lunches and chauffeur them. Delightful as traveling would be, the idea of traveling with 60+ year old wealthy jerks as their built in on-call servant was not enticing. I honestly *genuinely* didn't care, but everyone walked on eggshells like I might start crying because I was so excluded. The only thing they wanted me to do while they were gone was unlock the building, sit there for business hours and turn anyone away who came in, and lock up again. 10 hours, to be sure, but I could literally watch Netflix or read or even skype people the entire time. \n\nAs a last ditch attempt at comfort, HJ told me before he left that I should 'help myself to anything I wanted in the office.' What he meant: coffee creamer, stale muffins, office supplies. What he didn't think about: the customer gift closet. \n\nNow see, in even more blatant attempts to suck up to rich people, this firm has an entire closet full of embroidered &amp; personalized gifts that we assured clients we had made \"just for them.\" When a client left their annual review, they would leave with a gift bag full of goodies that I put together for them. (Now if I REALLY wanted to be good at my job - which I didn't, because it was gross - I would have suggested taking notes on favorite candy, hobbies, names of children, etc.) But the gifts weren't *actually* personalized; that would be too much work. In reality, we just had a bunch of A-Z branded things; lettered marble coasters, sherpa blankets, silver picture frames, desk clocks, bronze desk statues of famous American war heroes, ash/jewelry trays, whiskey glasses, and other pointless BS. So I complied with HJ's suggestion and helped myself. \n\nI found the key to the closet and had a good time looking through it, and shaking my head at some of the insane stuff they bought. To be honest, I could have 'stolen' it all or whatever, but since I still continued to work there for another six months, and because I knew what HJ meant, and because even though I was feeling fed up and petty, I was (hopefully am) still a fairly rule abiding person. I did not take the clocks or silver picture frames (also they had the stupid firm's logo on them so...no thanks). I didn't even take a sherpa blanket, though I really wanted one. It was like a $200 blanket. Instead, I took a small stack of marble coasters with the initial of my first name. I've seen similar stacks of marble at tile depot warehouses sell for \\~$8. It's been almost 10 years and I still have 3 of the 4 (one did break at some point). They're very faded, water stained, and the letter is almost completely rubbed off, but I still love them. ",

When my daughter was 5 years old they took it upon themselves to sit her down one afternoon and tell her that Santa wasn't real and was a tool of the Devil.  \n\nNow, I've never been a believer in lying to my daughter so I had never particularly enforced the belief in Santa.  I let her believe what she wanted and -- of course -- she chose to believe.  Wonderful.  I think a little magic is great for children.  Nobody should take that away from them, especially without a parent's permission.\n\nHowever because I never wanted to be in a position where I was lying to her, I decided not to start loudly protesting that Santa was real.  Instead I sat her down and decided to turn it into a lesson in critical thinking.\n\nI asked her if she believed in Santa.  I asked her if she believed in God.  I asked if she had ever seen Santa.  I asked if she had ever seen God.  I asked if Santa had ever given her a gift.  I asked if God had ever granted a wish for her.  I asked if she believed in a man -- whom she had met -- who lived at the North Pole.  I asked if she believed in an invisible man who lived in the sky who grants wishes.  \n\nIn the end, without me telling her anything at all, she decided that she believed in Santa but didn't believe in God.  I called her grandparents and let them know about the conversation we had had and asked if they had really thought that decision through.  Sheepishly they replied \"no I guess not\" and it never happened again.",

A 150mm Gastronorm 1/1 tray produced in India in 2008 is (to the layman) visually identical to one produced in China in 2019.\n\nNote that at this point we also offer a choice of CSV or XML feeds with product data including URI's for every image variant for every product. All freely available for download from our CDN and provided with liberal license terms.\n\nThis one customer (a pretty large Cash &amp; Carry chain) created a Master Image Database system. The initial upload was easy enough, I exported the first (packshot) image of every product, transferred the archive to their team and they imported all 2000+ images to their system.\n\nDone, right? We can just repeat the same every 4-6 months and stay up-to-date, it's only a few GB's and products rarely change -- some have not been changed at all in my 13 year employment here.\n\nBut no! This Master Image Database system requires monthly MANUAL verification of images, and if you don't do it in time, then there follow a bunch of unpleasant e-mails.\n\nSo this customer expects all their suppliers to manually click through their website, and indicate whether images are up-to-date or not, and master images or not. I pleaded with the head of their department, explained why I believe this approach doesn't fit, can't we come to a sensible compromise?\n\nNope. No room for exceptions. We must manually review all 2000+ images every month.\n\nNo way am I wasting anyone's time on that bullshit.\n\nSo I quickly wrote a VERY dirty script to run every time the first reminder message arrives, while I go for lunch and visit some other offices to ~~shoot the shit~~ have impromptu meetings for approximately 100 minutes.\n\n    # -- coding: utf-8 --\n\n    import pyautogui\n    import time\n\n    x = 0\n\n    # On a 1440p screen, in Chrome at 100%, this automates the clicks for [Censored] Mediabase.\n\n    while x &lt; 2023:\n\t    pyautogui.click(x=2443, y=212) # \"Nächster\"\n\t    time.sleep(1)\n\t    pyautogui.click(x=2166, y=302) # \"Ihre Entscheidung: Beibehalten\"\n\t    time.sleep(1)\n\t    pyautogui.click(x=2272, y=343) # \"Hauptbild: Keine Angabe\"\n\t    time.sleep(1)\n\t    x += 1\n\t    print(\"Saved you {} clicks\".format(x*3))\n\nThe customer is happy now. Every once in a while when our salespeople sell them a newly added product, we send an image or two manually, which they add, and I change the length of the while loop accordingly.\n\nA word of thanks to the web designer at this customer who made the page automatically scroll (and request the next page if needed) whenever the \"Next\" button is clicked. My script would have to be a lot more complicated without that feature.\n\nIt's been two years and we should probably do a bulk update again soon, but the dog is currently asleep.",

He does not like sinking into the couch he’s sitting in and prefers some structure. \n\nIf you know anything about sofas you know that after a while of breaking in a new couch the cushions get softer and (should be) more comfortable. \n\nWell one day my dad got sick of “sinking” into the couch and decided to get these cushions re-stuffed. So he went to whatever place they got their couch to consult the firmness of the cushions. \n\nWell, whatever the store offered, even the firmest option they offered, my dad wasn’t to happy about it. They were all to soft for him and re-affirmed that he likes them FIRM and asked the consultant to make them so as much as possible, beyond what the store typically offers.\n\nAnd so, the cushions are sent away for about 10 days and in that time my parents went on vacation and I was left alone at home with a couple cushion-less couches.\n\nThen it happened. A couple days before returning from vacation the re-stuffed cushions were delivered. I brought them in and unwrapped the over-stuffed cushions. They looked more like luxurious building blocks than they did cushions, and they couldn’t even fit together back into the couch they were so thick. Can confirm though, if you tried sitting in them, you wouldn’t be sinking in them anytime soon. Needless to say, they were NOT comfortable.\n\nI called my parents and explained the situation and they didn’t totally believe me until they came home and saw how awful they looked. Dad wanted them to work so much but under his grumbles knew where he went wrong and had to admit the cushions had to be returned to be stuffed at the levels offered.\n\nOur couch went back to normal and although my dad’s content he’s not satisfied. Today we’re getting brand new couches. I guess he got sick of the couch we had. \n\nShout out to the consultant and whoever fulfilled the order because my family still holds it against my dad to this day. He was taught a valuable lesson.",

        "text": "A recent post about following a manager's request at work reminded me of my own malicious compliance story:\n\nI once had a terrible manager that thought she could control and manipulate people. When I got tired of her and needed a new challenge, I applied to another department and got another position. My manager was upset. Instead of claiming her part in my success (as good managers usually do) she decided I was betraying her. I know this because of actions she attempted to take after finding out I was approved for the job transfer (long story).\n\nHowever, there was about a 6 month transition time before I switched to help the current department find and train my replacement. When a woman was hired the manager pulled me into another room, closed the door, and said something like \"You have to work with her closely and I'm concerned you won't get along. Just remember she's just learning for the job and not trying to replace you, so be nice to her.\"\n\nNow, I've always been nice to people regardless of workplace politics or whatever, but this was completely out of left field. I wasn't sure what manipulative angle she was going for but it was laughable. I *wanted* her to replace me and do well! My new department had little to do with my old one, and I was excited to settle into my new role and ditch the old one so why would that bother me?\n\nBut, I took her comments to heart. I made sure I paid special attention to my new coworker. We went to lunch together every day during training and spent every day working together. I was delighted to find out she was quick at picking up things and quick to understand the motivation of her new manager. Two months in I finally told her the full situation regarding the manager and the state of the department - not just what she had already guessed. I explained my understanding of the type of manager she now has and listed out previous incidents (there were many) where the manager tried to manipulate her staff or actually got in trouble for it. I also told her of the manager's specific request to me - I must be nice to her (we laughed). I apologized to her that I would be leaving her with this person but if she had any additional questions I'd be happy to give her my thoughts on how to navigate situations if she asked.\n\nTime went on and honestly, the new employee is still one of my best friends today, many years later. You could tell our manager noticed our lunches and wasn't pleased. Here was her new employee being influenced by the one who betrayed her by leaving! So of course the main malicious compliance here is I gained a new best friend because I was required to \"be nice\". \n\nBut here's the icing on the cake. My friend, with her previous knowledge of the department via our friendship somehow managed to join the department together despite the manager's constant attempt to divide them. The whole department demanded HR needed to be done about the Manager.  Shortly after that, the manager was promptly removed from that department to a smaller one with no management duties. Now the ex manager hates my replacement. \n\nI was just trying to be nice..",

        "text": "Some years ago our firm was asked to do a number of building condition surveys for a council in NW England, you know, council houses, community centres etc. There was one site we visited which was listed as a community centre and when myself and the other surveyor arrived we found it was derelict. In fact it was lacking a number of important bits, you know, windows, roof, internal fittings etc.\n\nCalled back to our office and said there was no point surveying it as the only option was demolition and any survey would just be wasting time. Boss says we're getting paid for doing it so go ahead anyway. Cue MC: our survey forms had boxes for marking the condition out of 5 plus a few other headings and a space for comments. Almost everything got marked down as condition 1 (worst) with comments like \"Roof: requires replacement\" \"Replace plumbing\", \"Draughty windows, replace\".... you get the idea, each with estimated costs for rectifying it. The total came to about £500k!\n\nWe ended up spending about 3 hours surveying the place and taking photos (actually more like 1 hour surveying and 2 hours drinking coffee in a local cafe) then went back to the office and printed out our report and handed it to the boss. He did query the photos we took as it looked like a bomb site but we told him that was what the place looked like. The complete report was sent through to the client and we never heard anything more. Total waste of time but I suppose the client was able to tick that box!",

        "text": "Just before COVID I worked for a small telecom company that did contract work for a national cell carrier. We'll call them crap inc, and Big wireless.\n\nI was hired on as a full time employee for crap inc along with every other technician, and WE were not contractors (important later).\n\nI was damn good at my job. I've been in the field for over 20 years, so I knew my stuff and most problems were easy enough to troubleshoot and repair. But sometimes we needed a second tech to help out with bigger issues which is understandable in our field.\n\nCrap Inc was shady, unbeknownst to us at the bottom of the ladder, but we were about to find out.\n\nAbout 4 months in, new orders came down the chain that from henceforth, \"we were to do double trips on EVERY ticket\". This ment we had to drive out with no parts, assess a problem, then make a return trip with parts to fix it. (2 trips = double pay for company). Even on simple things like pushing a reset button. TWO TRIPS...no excuses.\n\nThen they began cutting our hours, tracking our every move, and redoing our timesheets after submitting it. With the excuse of \"employees are stealing time and we're gonna prove it\"\n\nThe latest rule was a good one. \"All employees must work a least 2 tickets each day in order to be considered for a full 8 hours of pay and 40 hours per week. No ticket, no pay.\"\n\nWith this, they began holding mandatory bi-weekly meetings to go over every MINUTE of our trips, overlaying GPS data, timestamps, travel distance, etc. They docked pay for gas station stops, pee breaks, phone calls, everything. They even tried to not pay us for these very meetings because our \"trucks were off and couldn't prove we were working\"\n\nBuddy, I'm not a contractor. I'm a damn full time employee. \n\n...Enter glorious malicious compliance.\n\nSee, the thing is, I don't take to kindly to people stealing from my paycheck and gaslighting me about it. And apparently the other employees felt the same way. give me one solid night of prep work and  I'll beat you at your own game.\n\nThe next weekend I held a meeting of my own with the techs, And after some explanation, we all decided that the company was absolutely right. 2 tickets, 2 trips, every minute accounted for. And the GPS data to prove it.\n\nMonday morning meeting rolls around and every tech drove to the nearest site to have our mandatory 2 hour meeting. The trucks aren't at home and running the whole time.\n\nOur daily Tickets come in and we drive directly to the site, idle for 2 hours while we \"check out the problem\". Then do our second trip to get the parts (as instructed) and spend 2 hours fixing it. Drive time not included.\n\nA Second daily ticket comes in and...what's this? I can't seem to figure out the problem. I guess I'll have to call another tech who only had one ticket to help me. Glad he was free.  Let's ponder this problem for 2 hours waisting fuel. \n\nNow we need parts. Looks like we both have to go get them. Return trip complete. Another 2 hours to kill...er fix the problem. \n\n-- Let's see how we did:\n\nFirst ticket.\n2 hours assessment +1 hour travel time (GPS logged)\n2 hour return trip + 1 hour travel time (GPS logged)\n\nSecond ticket\n2 hours assessment +1 hour travel time (GPS logged)\n2 hour return trip + 1 hour travel time (GPS logged)\n\n2 hour Meeting x 2 (GPS logged)\n\nHey boss... Crap inc owes every tech 64 hours of work this week...let's check the math and GPS logs just to be sure.\n\nOh, and for some reason the fuel expenses went up. But at least we have the GPS data you need for our extremely accurate power point presentation. \n\nTL;DR never mess with my money. I'll beat you at your own game.",

        "text": "Im 29, 5ft 3\" 65kg, English and have no family here in Australia. Ive only recent in the last few months become a resident.  \nMy partner 36, 6ft 3\", 105kg has family and friends as he's lived here his entire life.  \nThe size difference is huge, so physically I'm at a huge disadvantage.\n\nOkay so onto the chaos that is my life....\n\nI started dating my partner 2 years ago, at the start we met in a bar things went well and we started hanging out regularly, obviously while hanging out a lot I asked for clarification and asked \"what are we?\" his response was \"we don't have to put a label on things\". I was okay with this, as I think its a very subtle way of saying I don't want anything serious.  \nso I proceeded forward with caution but also didn't invest to much into this suitation.\n\nThis went on for a few months until he broke down crying one day and said \"I don't want this to carry on this way, we either get together or we can't hang out anymore\" so we officially started dating.\n\nNow here's where things get interesting...\n\nI didn't move in until we'd be dating for about a year, this is because there is only me here in Australia so if anything goes wrong I only really have me to fall back on. He owns his home and has multiple people he can go to if he's stuck.  \nAnyways, I explained all this to him and requested we rent together, and although I logically I agree it doesn't make sense to rent somewhere when he owns his home but it would have given me something to fall back on if things went south.  \nI moved in with him, and I'd try talking too him about \"our future\" together. As people do when they've been dating for over a year, you kind of want to know where the ship is heading so you aren't wasting your time floating around in an empty ocean. Anyways he gives me no guidance or direction.\n\nAs I our relationship progressed I needed my IUD (contraception) changed, so I went to the GP, got it replaced and ended up with an infection, had it removed again. When going back to get another fitted after the infection had cleared my partner said don't go to the appointment, you don't need it, I don't care if we have a kid but you won't get pregnant. Now I'm no Dr, but science has proven for many many years without contraception the end result is pregnancy. So after a few months I was convinced something was wrong with me and said its weird nothings happening and he flippantly declares \"oh, you won't get pregnant I run low dose testosterone\" again, I'm no Dr but if you do this long enough this must have an effect on your body?  \nAgain, I wouldn't have minded this but felt id been lead to believe in a future that wasn't there and he influenced my decision on not having my IUD replaced by using sentences like \"contraception isn't good for you\" - \"I don't mind about having a kid\" \"I'm getting older, I want to settle down\". I also requested he go get checked out because if he's been on it that long, I want to know if he's even able to have kids because if he doesn't that is a huge sacrifice he's expecting on my behalf.\n\nThis leads onto me giving up talking about kid's.\n\nWhen I became a resident, I asked if we could buy a house together, he said no again. Apparently we both need our own house. He will however help me with the deposit. Make that make sense?  \nHe says we can't buy a house together because he's self employed and if he gets sued we could be homeless. Keep in mind, we are both currently living in his house, he's still self employed, if he gets sued now what is the difference? I asked about Tennant in common, said let's make it fair but id like the commitment, again, nothing.  \nIve spent HOURS doing up his house also, and I mean HOURS!!\n\nin-between all of these future red flags, there has been a lot of little things also.  \nother examples are;  \n\\- Having sex and him declaring its like shagging bone.  \n\\- Messaging other women things like \"ill come over and give you a back rub and a coffee\", yet apparently some random guy I've barely spoken to and NEVER flirted with asking me out for dinner is somehow considered far worse. He later changed his apology to I'm overly dramatic and his message was sarcasm.  \n\\- I bought the wrong tomatoes - I am wrong for this because he's told me many times he doesn't like them and I should have gone to three different Coles until I found the exact ones.  \n\\- He asked how much meat did I add to a salad, I said \"a lot\". He checked the bowl in the fridge and said I lied and I'm a compulsive liar.  \n\\- I mowed the lawn (first time using a lawn mower), he asked if I emptied the grass draw, I had emptied it a few times so responded yes and showed him where id thrown the grass clippings. He checked the catcher and again I was a liar because I didn't empty it on the last lap.  \n\\- He has hidden cameras in the house (he literally does)  \n\\- He doesn't talk about feelings I'm just meant to guess.  \n\\- He isn't affectionate  \n\\- if he's getting ready for bed I tiptoe around not turning on any lights because if I wake him I'm selfish and don't care about him, but when he wakes up at 4am he makes as much noise as he likes.  \n\\- Normal name calling - whore, slimy, idiot, stupid etc.  \n\\- I donated money to a friend in need as they had to get their dog put down and the pet insurance wouldn't pay out. I was stupid and selfish because I'm just giving away money and what if we have kids one day that could be used for us.  \n\\- Poured beer on me one day because I shouted \"just give me a fucking cuddle\" at him\n\nNow, a month or so ago he broke up with me right before my birthday.  \nI lost my shit, and had a mental breakdown and really really wanted him to hurt back but physically I can't do anything. The only way I knew I could get to him was to steal his money and testosterone.  \nNow there was a fair chunk of cash sat there but I literally just grabbed a handful of it and the box with the test in it. Threw it in the back of my car and drove allll they way to the other side of Australia. Which I did. In my defence I gave it all back, and stupid me, went back to him thinking things would change as he said he'd do couples counselling.  \nWe've done two sessions, now he's cancelled stating the councillor is shit. Im back to square one but this time he has justification to have the cameras etc in the house now because I'm branded a thief.\n\nHe likes to say I've broken his trust, but he broke mine periodically throughout the year, messaging other women, calling me names, punching holes in walls, silent treatment, threats etc  \nI'm currently seeing a psychologist but I would like my own battle plan, I want ideas.  \nThis man has a lot of money so suing him would just be long and drawn out but would piss him off.  \nI want to know how to really get under his skin. This mans ego is his most important thing, he cannot handle the thought of people thinking bad of him. He's already threatened that if I post any messages from him its a breach of privacy etc. I want ideas, I'm fed up of him always having the ball in his court.\n\nI want to know if I'm being stupid too, like I know logically I could just leave but with the housing crisis and having limited friends in the area I'm in a little bit of a precarious situation. I feel beat down, trodden and disrespected.\n\nIf you don't want to give me petty revenge ideas that won't land me in to much trouble, please leave me ideas how I can protect myself while I make arrangements",

        "text": "This is a story of how hate blinds you.\n\nI work in  radiology. About 15 plus years ago i was working with a radiographer(x-ray tech) called Smith. Now Smith  had recently received two official warning of duty. One for abusing the boss and one for abusing me. Smith was told to change their attitude and behave. Smith however went on a path of revenge that was endless.  I was dying a death of a thousand tiny paper cuts,. Nothing terrible but just lots of little things which i knew Smith had done but i couldn't prove it.\n\nOne Monday morning one of the A&amp;E doctors came over to complain about how poor the X-ray image quality was a couple nights ago. Smith goes over the roster board and sees my name corresponding to that shift (you worked afternoon shift by yourself). Smith charges into the boss's office demanding a full complaint process . Smith demands since clearly the boss and I have it in for them, HR should run it independently. The boss tries to talk Smith out of it but Smith basically say they don't trust the boss to deal with me fairly. The boss tells Smith he will hand it over but be careful of what you ask for. Apparently Smith was in  quite a lather and so excited that they had got me.\n\nTwo days later I'm been interviewed by two HR guys and an independent chief radiographer from another hospital. We go through each of the images and i agree the work is really poor .It's clear no one has actually looked too carefully at the paperwork with the x-ray images. The HR guys finally asks why did you such poor work. I reply i didn't and if they bothered to look on the online pay system i had called in sick that day. In fact Smith had done the overtime shift. They looked stunned. I reminded them I expected the same process for Smith. I also lodged an official complaint about false allegations be made by Smith  for this case.\n\nApparently Smith tried to stick to the roster but they showed Smith their pay slip plus that they had signed off on all the images .While HR was deciding what to do with Smith(fire them or not) Smith had two more incidents at work and was eventually fired.",

        "text": "When I lost my part-time job due to covid, a good friend (let's call her \"Kate\") helped me get hired at the after-school learning center her dad owns. She did warn me, though, that her dad was unapologetically racist. I'll call her dad \"Owner\".\n\nAnyway, Owner and Manager loved me as an employee. At the 2020 Christmas party hosted at Owner's house, I got offered the role of assistant manager. We chatted for a while after, and Owner and I briefly bonded over our dislike of corrupt establishment politicians. (I just prefer progressives, but I didn't disclose that part). I think he came out of that conversation with the incorrect assumption that I shared his politics (and social views), and his racist tendencies immediately got less subtle.\n\nIn January, Manager hired a new employee to fill in for the role I left. The new guy was a very-dark-skinned Indian man around my and Kate's age, 24 at the time. On this guy's first day, Owner was visiting (he has another job so he only comes in on Mondays). Right before students start arriving, Owner pulls me aside and asks me to **\"keep an eye on (NewEmployee)\".**\n\nI don't remember the exact wording that followed (this is over a year ago), but basically... without saying anything directly, Owner implies that he suspected NewEmployee would steal something, or do something to the kids. Despite not saying the actual words, his intentions were clear, and it was the most overt racism he'd displayed so far. But, rather than say something in the heat of the moment, I decided to just maliciously comply.\n\nI've kept an eye on NewEmployee ever since, watching him to make sure he succeeds. I made sure he had all the support he needed. I shielded him from Owner's racism as much as I could. I invited him to grab drinks after work a few times, and we ended up becoming really good friends. And last month when I told Owner I had to leave at the end of this year, I knew no one else was interested in my position as Assistant Director, so I got most of the staff to endorse him as my replacement. I'm now training him to take over for me. He's doing so well today that I was able to just sit around and write this post.\n\nBut my favorite part in all of this is that at last year's Christmas party, I introduced NewEmployee to Kate. They clicked like no other couple I've ever seen, and have now been dating for almost a year. NewEmployee proposed to Kate at Thanksgiving and she said yes, and I know they're definitely trying for kids real soon. Owner knows they're engaged, but he didn't come in on Monday like he usually does and we haven't heard from him, so I don't know how he's taking it.\n\nAnyway, can't wait for this year's Christmas party ;)",

        "text": "So a while back, ( I'm retired now ) I worked as a field tech for this company. they were big on us not coming into the workshop ( we had company vehicles and would start and stop our pay via low-jacked company vehicles ) but wanted us to be on the road a half hour before our assigned start time of 8 am. we would usually work a lot of overtime after our shifts ended and it was normal for us to start later than 8 am to help rectify hours. The HR person would throw a fit and demand that we be in our trucks and on the road when he told us to, and we usually just blew him off. On one occasion, ( there were many ) I was on a job that had everyone baffled and it was a large customer. I ended up talking my boss into ordering a specific piece of test equipment that would plot power coming to the equipment over a 24-hour period. I connected the equipment to the machine and let it run. meanwhile, I was called into the office for my weekly ass-chewing, and the owner of the company was present. after getting an earful from the HR guy, I looked at the owner and told him, I was the only tech who knew what troubleshooting equipment was needed, and how to use it. However, He could lose this guy and hire another more qualified guy by tomorrow. I was asked to leave the meeting and go back to work. I ended up finding a power spike that was happening at the same time every night and rectify the issue. I don't know what was said that day in the meeting but I continued setting my own hours and never heard another peep out of the HR fool.",

        "text": "Long time stalker, first time poster. Only doing this now because it FINALLY came to fruition last week.\n\nI used to work as a spare parts estimator for a fairly niche industry. My job was essentially to work out what parts of our main product the customer wanted, find out how much it would cost us to make, add a little mark up and send them a quote. My boss was pretty strict on traceability so everything needed to be recorded, including why a certain mark up had been applied to a particular product.\n\nNormal value of these quotes is somewhere between £200 and a few hundred thousand. Very rarely do we get orders for anything more than that (once or twice a decade in my experience)\n\nA request for quotation landed on my desk when I was WFH during Covid, and it was a biggy. Just looking at the list of parts the customer wanted, this was going to be an absolute killer, over a million pounds all by itself. I was told by the sales guy that if this one went well, there was another to follow of an even bigger size, ultimately looking at ten million over the next four years. So I set to work.\n\nNormally I can do five or six of these quotes in a day, but this one quote took me six weeks to put together. I was in constant contact with 20+ vendors getting specifications, technical details, prices and lead times for over four hundred items. Finally, my masterpiece was complete.\n\nThen came the snag.\n\nSales guy then says that because of the country this customer is in, they need to have four or more quotes in from different customers in order to get it cleared by their government (some anti-corruption policy that had been instituted). We were the OEM of the product and there’s nowhere else on the planet they could get these parts from, so we’d have to work through third parties to get it done, and he knew just the guy.\n\nIn comes a one man band with a dodgy looking entry at companies house to save the day. Sales guy and him go way back, so he was going to be the “preferential supplier”. I was asked to do the normal quote to him, then to bump the prices up by 30% and send that to three other companies who had been asking about it so they would absolutely not get the contract with the end user. I argued the point, saying that the whole purpose of the anti-corruption policy is to prevent situations exactly like this, but I was overruled. The COO of the company now tells me to just do it over a phone call, at which point I request that in writing before I go ahead and do it.\n\nFast forward two years and there’s still no order been placed. Then I find out through a different sales guy that the One Man Band has been put on a blacklist by this country’s government over this project, the other three companies have been turned down, and the end user is asking other companies to come in and take our product out and replace it with their own. A huge investigation is called for by senior management, my quote is ripped to pieces and examined in microscopic detail, and the question gets asked “why did you give different prices to these other three when you knew it was all to do with anti-corruption, we should fire you! That’s millions of pounds of order you’ve lost us!” Out comes the email from my little black book, on the desk it goes, everyone suddenly gets veeeeeery quiet, and the COO starts packing his desk in a box the next week.\n\nAnd the moral of the story is, if someone tells you to do something borderline illegal, make sure to get it in writing.",

        "text": "Note: Hi! This is my first post on Reddit and I stumbled upon this subreddit. Not sure if this story fits within the bounds of MC, but thought this would be a fun story to tell. Enjoy!\n\nAbout 2 years ago I worked at a mom and pop boba shop, owned by my aunt and uncle’s friend. Along with selling boba we also sold food items like popcorn chicken and fries. The popcorn chicken was very popular amongst costumers and we got orders for it frequently.\n\nThis story begins with a women placing a phone order of a few drinks and popcorn chicken (exact details may be lacking due to incident occurring two yrs ago).\n\nDialogue:\n\nWoman: “Hi! I’d like to place an order for boba and popcorn chicken please.”\n\nMe: “Of course! What can I get for you?”\n\nWoman: *tells me what drinks she’d like then asks about spice levels on popcorn chicken.\n\nMe: *I explain we have no spice, mild, medium, spicy, and very spicy.\n\nWoman: “I’ll get the medium please!”\n\nMe: “Sounds great!” *I repeat her order asking if I missed anything and if she was good with her order.\n\nWoman: *confirms and says thank you.\n\nMe: “Awesome! Your order will be ready in about 15 mins. See you soon!”\n\nSo far this all just seemed like a typical phone order where the customer places the order, our baristas make the drinks, and I go to the back to make their chicken (the shop manager assigned tasks to everyone, and typically the guys make the chicken, do most of the cleaning ie dishes, mopping, machines. The girls were in charge of inventory and making drinks.) I go to the back to start the chicken as it takes a bit to weigh out the chicken, bread it, and fry it. Another coworker takes over register while I cook the chicken.\n\nMaking the order was standard procedure and the woman came in and grabbed her order. I greeted her and went over her order asking if everything was how she wanted. She responded saying it was perfect, grabbing her drinks and popcorn chicken and leaving. I thought that was just any other order and went on with my shift. The MC occurred when her husband walked back into the shop with the popcorn chicken in his hand.\n\nMore Dialogue:\n\nHusband: “Who made this chicken?”\n\nMe: “I did. Was something wrong with it?”\n\nHusband: “Yes, you gave us medium spice chicken but we ordered no spice!”\n\nMe: *I explained to him that his wife had no problem with the order while on the phone or while picking it up, showing him the receipt\n\nHusband: “No, you put it in wrong. We can’t have this chicken! Our baby cannot eat it. Remake this!” \n\nHe was raising his voice and acting as if I was incompetent for making their order “incorrectly”. At this point other costumers were glancing our way. I was very confused with the whole situation as the wife had no problem with the order. I was a bit offended that he barged in and challenged my competency, so I decided to just comply with his request, free of charge.\n\nMe: “Okay sir, I’ll remake your popcorn chicken. No spice, correct?” \n\nHusband: “Yes” *visibly irritated at this point\n\n I return to the back telling my coworkers about what happened, and they apologized to me for having to experience that (this was about a month into the job and everything had gone smooth prior to this). I told them that it was to be expected with costumer service, but proposed that we delay his order a bit, since we had other costumers waiting on drinks and popcorn chicken. So while the man waited in the store we completed our other orders before I started the popcorn chicken. While waiting the man would come to the register demanding his chicken, but I was persistent and simply replied with, “still cooking!”. \n\nAfter about 20-25 mins of waiting, I brought out his popcorn chicken, with no spice. He grabbed it, and without a single word scampered out the door while I smiled and said, “have a great day!”\n\nFinal words: Not sure if this was a story to be shared on this subreddit or another one, but after reading a few post I thought it may fit.",

If not, please forgive me. \n\nMe: Me\nSM: Store Manager\nDM: District Manager \n\nYears ago, I used to work as a Hardware Manager for a (now defunct) retail company in Canada, who's name started with an \"S\" and ended in \"ears\" \n\nIn the spring time, we were setting up for the inevitable warmer weather, and we unveiled this absolutely amazing BBQ. Kenmore made by Charbroil, 5 burner 75000 BTU, with a 10000 BTU side burner, stainless steel construction with cast iron grill, all for the low low price of $499. \n\nThe exact same Charbroil sold for $899 at the time, so as you can imagine, it was very popular. Maybe sold.....12 to 1 of it vs any other BBQ in my department. \n\nAlso, due to that, I rarely if ever had any on hand, and would have to special order them for customers. I begged and pleaded with my District and Logistical Managers to send me 100 of the things, because I know I would have been able to sell them, but they refused. \n\nNow, at this point in the company (2012) The Canadian operations of the company were going through some transitions, and they had recently initiated a \"Say Yes!\" policy. Say \"YES!\" to the customer, whenever possible to complete the sale, and secure that excellent, salesman/customer relationship. The customer buys a BBQ and asks if we can throw in a cover for free?? YES! The customer doesn't have tools at home, and asks if we can build it in store for them? YES! \n\nYou get the point. \n\nSo, June rolls around. BBQs are flying out of my department at an alarming rate, with a majority of them, being this Kenmore BBQ. It's Wednesday, and a customer comes in, after hearing about the price, and his BBQ had just broken on him the day prior, and he's got family coming this weekend. \n\nMe: \"Well I can order it in, we've got another truck arriving Friday, so it may be on there, but I cannot confirm. If it's not on this Friday's truck, it'll be on the following Tuesday truck for sure.\"\n\nCustomer: \"I can't take that risk man. Is there any way that I can buy the floor model?\" \n\nNow, to note, selling floor model BBQs wasn't really allowed during the traditional BBQ season, but since the customer asked....\n\nMe: \"Yeah for sure man!\" \n\nCustomer: \"Do I get any discount off for the floor model??\" \n\nMe: \"Ordinarily there would be if it were closer to clearance time, but with it being pre-built and ready to go right now, I think you're getting a decent deal, with no extra hassles\" (Utter BS, but w/e that's neither here nor there)\n\nC: \"Alright man, I'll take it.\" \n\nSo I get it packed up, wheel it out, and walk by SM, and she gives me *The Look*. You know the one. The \"You weren't supposed to do that\" Look. Hey, I was just saying 'Yes'. \n\n*Next Day* \n\nI'm sitting in the center office, stuck on a conference call that could have been an email, listening to the ramblings of sales numbers and things I'm not too concerned about, because I was good at my job and my numbers were good. (At that point, I was up 25% over the previous year)\n\nThen something jerks me out of my lulled state of boredom. It's DM, with whom I don't get along with at the best of times.\n\nDM: \"Just going over hardware sales, DefsNotRandyMarsh, I noticed that you sold your floor model Kenmore BBQ. That's our #1 selling BBQ right now, why would you take it off the floor before clearance?\"\n\nMe: \"Well DM, I had a customer come in, and they were in a bind, family coming in from out of town for a huge get-together, and his previous BBQ had just died on him. I attempted to show him other models, but he was set on this one for obvious reasons. I told him I could order one in, but I couldn't guarantee that it'd arrive on my Friday truck. He then asked if he could purchase the floor model, and I, remembering the last few conference calls and your guys' introduction of our new \"Say Yes!\" Policy, looked at the customer, and I fuggin said YES!\"\n\nI immediately heard roughly 7 people laugh and then mute their call \n\nDM: \"Appliances, we have a new Bosch dishwasher arriving.......\" At this point I tuned out. \n\n5 minutes later, the call ends. I grab my notes, walk towards my department, and then there's an announcement over the intercom....\n\nSM: \"DefsNotRandyMarsh, please report to SM's office.\" \n\nOh this is gonna be good....\n\nMe: \"You wanted to see me?\"\n\nSM: \"Why is DM calling me literally as soon as your conference call has ended?\" \n\nMe: *recounts story for SM*\n\nSM: \"You know she doesn't want you on any conference calls from now on, right? The CEO and COO were on that call.\" \n\nMe: \"Whoops...but also not whoops, because you know I hate conference calls...\" \n\nSM is just glaring at me, but smirking at the same time.\n\nMe: \"Soooooo can I go sell some BBQs now?\" \n\nSM: \"You're lucky you can sell...\" (She was joking around) \n\nSo I headed on back to my sales floor, and continued to sell 3 more of the BBQs without them even being on display. \n\nAftermath - They were serious about me never being on anymore conference calls, they were all handled by the ASM from then on, and he just gave me notes, and the gist of what the call was about, but even that, could have been an email. CEO &amp; COO remembered me when they made a visit to my store a few weeks later. DM tried to rush them past my department when she saw I was working, but the CEO made a point to stop and say \"So THIS is the Outspoken Hardware Salesman that I've been hearing so much about\". Him and I laughed, while DM looked like she wanted to murder me. \n\nI also finished that quarter, 33% up for the period, the best increase in sales the company had ever seen in our district at that time. I left the company in October 2012 after 4.5 years, and the whole company shut down roughly 5 years later.",

        "text": "I work in the hotel industry in a busy city. This specific property was completely ran down after covid and EVERYONE left except one person so EVERYONE there is new to the property, most even new to hospitality. Even managers. Even HR. A few of the “rules” set by the new management was that 1) We can’t even have as much as a bottle of water behind the front desk to drink between guests or when there’s a lull in check-ins or checkouts. We have to put it in the bell closet that is nowhere near the front desk. I have to exit my pod, go around the corner out of sight into the lobby, and go in the closet to take a sip of water. Sweet. Got it.  \n2) We cannot use the public restrooms on the  main floor because it is “unprofessional” to guests. We have to go down to the basement (which is around the corner from the front desk, down 2 flights of stairs, into the security office, down a long hallway— next to the housekeeping office. This bathroom is the housekeepers bathroom. All their clothes are in there. They have a shower. They’re always getting ready in there at the sink and every stall is always taken. Ok. Got it. Sweet. \nMind you, not even two months ago I was hospitalized for dehydration so drinking water is vital for me. Therefore I require a lot of fluids, and a lot of bathroom trips follow. (ESPECIALLY during that time of that month.)\nSo what could’ve easily been gulps of water between groups of guests at the desk and simple 3 minute bathroom trips on the same level as me, are now 15 minute ordeals each time I am thirsty or have to use the bathroom combined. So I got it. Full line of guests arriving that need to get into their rooms? Full line of guests leaving that need to catch their taxis to get to the airport? I’m sorry, I need water and to use the bathroom, be back in 15. My manager quickly realizes that I am gone for more than 2 minutes and the lines are building as they’re watching from the cameras downstairs and scold me when I come up. He tells me that we don’t get breaks, only 1 unpaid lunch during our shift and I am abusing time paid. That I need to save those activities for my unpaid meal. I tell him, “I am sorry, I was told it looks unprofessional to use this bathroom around the corner in the lobby and also told I cannot keep a water bottle with me. My only option is to go where you tell me to go and with those instructions, it takes me 10-15 minutes to drink some water, make the trek to the basement bathroom and wait for a stall to open, and then wait for a sink to open, and then make my way upstairs again.” He knew he couldn’t tell me I can’t drink water during my shift or that I can’t use the bathroom on the clock, and he sticks by his shitty rules. So he now has to keep his mouth shut when I’m gone for whatever time I please. Other employees have followed suit and reviews pointing out long wait times are pouring in. As my managers sit their butts in their offices and don’t assist with the lines in any way. We’re just doing what we’re told, sir. Us poor working slaves cannot be seen with the big money spenders in their fancy bathroom quarters and under no circumstances can the card swipers see us lowlife associates hydrate with water. Got it!",

        "text": "This happened to me over the summer  and I just signed the papers so I can finally talk about it. TLDR at the bottom.\n\nI leased a new car from a common, cheaply manufactured dealership in the US. Now, the car is 18 months old, and I brought it to the dealership before work to be checked because it was driving a bit sloppy. I get a phone call while I'm at work and It turns out to be a major component and they would not let me drive it home because it wasn't safe. The part was also on back order with no estimated return. The manager informed me there were no loaner cars I could use, because they had to sell them all due to the car shortage. They offered to reimburse me $50 a day for a rental, but a rental would cost me over double that. I couldn't use my insurance to cover any rentals because my car hadn't been in an accident. \n\nI called my mom in a panic, and she came to the dealership with me after work. We walk in at closing time and ask to speak with the manager. A man excitedly announced that he is the manager. So my mom explains the situation and that they need to provide me with a rental. All the sudden the manager gets an attitude and says, \"well, you need to speak to the manager about that!\" Confused, we reminded him that he said he was the manager. He tells us, \"oh I'm just the manager of sales, you need to speak to the manager of service, and he already left for the day.\" Since there is no public transportation in the area and I need to get back and forth to work, we ask him to get the service manager on the phone. By the time my mom ended the conversation with him, he assured me he would find a loaner car for me to use. And they ended up being able to find one for me the next day.\n\nAfter this rough start, I decide to call corporate. I get transferred back and forth between departments and customer service reps dumber than the last. I was so worked up that I decided to go full Karen on them, and eventually got my case escalated to a regional manager in corporate. \n\nIt was over 3 weeks later by the time I ended up getting the email address for the regional manager. I respectfully asked for corporate to cover my lease payment while the car was in the shop. After a few emails, corporate ended up saying there was nothing they could do and I needed to wait until the part came in. \n\nQue malicious compliance.\n\nWhile I waited I researched the Lemon Law for my state, and it seemed like if the repair took longer than 30 days I could actually have a case against them. I was already 20 days in and I since I had a loaner car I decided to wait it out. I did everything by the book, sent official letters and kept track of all my communications with the company.\n\n2 months in I end up speaking with corporates legal department and they immediately offered me a settlement. I dragged out the process asking dumb questions, and spending long periods of time to consider their offers. I was happy using the loaner car, and actually liked it better than my lease. I was getting free mileage and free ez-pass/tolls. And it was a car that would have a much higher monthly payment had I been leasing it. Overall I was happy with the situation and content knowing I'd be getting some money out of this deal.\n\nIt took over 3 months for my lease to get fixed, and 4 months to come to a settlement with corporate. Since they made me so mad in the beginning and refused to just cover my lease payments while the car wasn't operable, I decided to really make them pay. I ended up having to be my own lawyer (because none would take my case) and cost them thousands. A check for $4000, a 5 year additional extended warranty (No way I'll even be keeping this car), and I put on almost 6,000 miles on the dealerships loaner car. (Which I really needed because I was starting to use more than my allowed amount on my lease) All because they would not agree to cover my lease payments while the car was in the shop.\n\nTLDR; New car had a faulty part, the dealership and corporate pissed me off and I ended up getting paid $4000.",

So, I was thinking I could make him a fruit salad, which are sweet and tasty. BUT, I automatically opened the freezer (because that's what we always go through when he asks us to make him food) and I saw the mini pancakes we got. Funfetti mini pancakes.\n\nPerfect.\n\nI put some on a plate, cooked them in the microwave, then paused. We have two types of syrup: Regular maple, and fruity pebble. I go downstairs and ask him \"Which syrup do you want?\"\n\nHe chooses the fruity pebble.\n\nI put a very generous amount of fruity pebble syrup and some honey on the pancakes, then took them downstairs. I give him the plate and he looks at me, bewildered, and says \"thank you\"\n\nIn a couple of minutes, my bell rings again and he hands me plate \"I will never ask you to make me something sweet again.

When I interviewed, I applied for the sales position in plumbing (no longer exists). It was Monday - Friday, 9-5, with a commission program. Since I had years of plumbing experience, I was offered the job. The day I started I was told the sales job went to an internal promotion, only thing they could offer me was 'part time'. Lower hourly rate, no commission, had to work alternating weekends. I was young and had a new baby so I said sure as long as I could go full time in a few months with weekend off. My manager agreed. \n\nFast forward 3 months, not a word has been said. The guy who got the sales job (an electrician), asked me questions about plumbing all day. I ask my department manager about full time, a sales job, anything. Sorry! Nothing available. I reminded him of what I was hired for, the schedule I was promised, the pay I was originally offered. DM: if you don't like it, look for another job. \n\nJobs at the time were hard to come by. But, a job that WAS available, in that store even, was a stocking job. This position was always available as the pay wasn't great and it was a lot of physical work. But, the hours were Monday - Friday, full time. So, I applied for that. When I interviewed, my manager found out. He went to HR to stop me from transferring. I informed HR that if the position didn't get filled, and I was excluded from transferring, I would filter a complaint. So, I got the job.\n\nFast forward 2 months and the quarter ends. No actual plumber in the department meant sales dropped. So manager didn't get his bonus. He now begs me to come back. No thanks! I'm making more money on Saturday doing side jobs than I made Monday - Friday. So he asks, \"what can I do to get you back in plumbing\"?\nI have him a ridiculous price! He laughs and said 'that's more than I make'. Oh well. \n\nFast forward 3 more months. Store manager  doesn't get her bonus because plumbing hasn't made budget in 2 quarters in a row. Time to fix the problem. I get called into a meeting with store manager (SM) &amp; department manager (DM). \n\nSM: \"What will it take to get you back in plumbing?\"\n\nMe: stupid salary\n\nDM: I told you! Not reasonable!\n\nSM: give us a minute please\n\nI stand up to leave and... SM: oh no I'm sorry, I meant DM should leave. \n\nDM: surprised Pikachu face! 😯\n\nSM: if I pay you that you'll have to work weekends. We're busiest on weekends. \n\nMe: I'll do Saturday. With every Sunday, Monday off. No rotating days off like before. I get my commission back.\n\nSM: done! You CANNOT talk about your rate. I'm the only person in the store making more than this. \n\nMe: well, I CAN, but I won't. \n\nThe look on DM face when we came out was priceless.

His contract had provisions for annual increases, overtime, weekend, and holiday rates, on-call, and fixed time off. All was well until he got a new boss, we'll call him Richard. \n\nRichard set about marking his territory and crapping on everything. He decided that John was going to become the permanent on-call person. He sends an email to that effect, to which John replies, \"sure - you have read my contract, right?\" \n\nRichard fires back a not-nice email explaining that John wasn't getting out of this - he was on-call immediately and that was that. On-call response time was 30-minutes from notification to being in the office. \n\nAt the end of the month, John submitted his monthly invoice - for 672 hours. 160 hours at regular rate, 80 hours at time and a half, 240 hours at double time, and 192 hours at weekend overtime rate - triple time. Instead of the normal bill of about 190 hours (with overtime, equal to 205 hours pay), this bill was for over 1,300 hours worth of pay, once you multiplied out the overtime. \n\nThe fallout? Richard fired John, who was the only guy working on a particular project that was 90% complete. John enjoyed his 30 days paid termination vacation. The CEO called John to find out the status of the big project and found out that nobody was working on it. Richard found a new job, John was rehired with a bump in pay, and he never had to pull on-call again.",

This was back in the days of Windows NT &amp; Novell NetWare, both of which were on premise at this client. Since we were self employed we were a little isolated from the political minefield that was the corporate cube farm.  We were content to put in the time necessary, typically only billing 8 hours/day for each of us since we essentially became their IT department due to the rest of the staff quitting in droves.  \nApparently one of the VPs got it into their head that we were overbilling them - we're hourly, so there's no way our daily hours would ALWAYS be 8 hours. We were told that from that point forward, we were to badge into Kronos like every other employee. And to make sure we badged out for lunch!  \nMy partner and I happily obliged.   \nWhile badged out for lunch, we did not answer calls. We started taking our lunches off site so there would be no more interrupted breaks.  \nThe absolute best part is that our billable time went from 8 hours a day to 10-16 hours a day, each.  \nThe VP was too proud to admit that they screwed up, so they never asked us to go back to retainer billing.  Every week when we handed in our invoice, we asked the controller to thank the VP for us.   \n\n\nAnd yes - weekly invoices - they were so bad at paying other vendors that the only way we would continue working for them was on Net 7 terms.  \n\n\nTL/DR: requirement to badge in/out increased our invoices by 25% to 50% per cycle.",

The expected productivity according to my boss is laughably easy achievable by myself, however, others on my team seem to only be able to complete what is expected. (Keeping things vague bec my compant is large and I'd prefer to vent safely)\n\nAnyways, every day I achieve above average uploads, like I said, it's super easy for me. I don't do too much over the top and generally can complete my whole workload, accurately, within a max of 4 hours every day. This leaves a lot of time to myself. I always stay by my computer however in case my boss or a coworker needs help with other things.\n\nJust this past week however, I have been reprimanded for \"productivity\" issues. Basically being told I need to be doing something at all times and that the time gaps in no work is unacceptable. This comes after having worked in this fashion for the last 10 months by the way.\n\nSo, my boss demands that when I am clocked in, my upload records must always show that I have recently done something, and that there cannot be a gap in uploads longer than 10 minutes unless I'm clocked out. Basically demanding I do more work for the same amount of pay.\n\nWell, my solution is to set a timer that goes off on my phone every 3 and a half minutes telling me to complete one upload. So now I do the exact same amount of work over the course of 8 hours instead of 4.\n\nDon't want to pay me more for doing 3x as much work as others? I'm not putting the effort in then. It's silly to think I would. \n\nPs. Sorry if this is slightly ranty or incoherent, I'm tired as hell and pretty upset at being reprimanded for being efficient.",

        "text": "I messed up the original post, so I am reposting.\n\nI applied for a job to install equipment for a large company that sells cleaning and sanitation chemicals and tools to every place you can imagine, they have a separate pest control branch and hospital supplier branch. I applied to install their leased equipment, but was immediately promoted to sales and service in a bait and hook scheme. It was 25% more hours, on call 24 hours, some weekends but the did the math so the annual pay was the same.. They \"couldn't\" give me a raise within the first 2 years but apparently could bend the promoting before 2 years rule. Whatever, I needed to get promoted to a salary position anyway.\n\nI talked to my district manager, he agreed to let me work 5 more hours overtime a week and sell new accounts. Giving me more cash and working towards promotion. I got many recognitions, met with global management to share my ideas, was on product development teams as field tester, 6 of my ideas were rolled out nationally and I was still second from bottom of the chain.\n\nGot promoted to a salary and commission sales and service role (40 hour weeks, no lease machines, no late night calls), used my sales skills to making 3-4k a month above my old salary just in commissions. 4 months in this role they bring us all in, tell us they are removing all salary positions and everyone was getting new titles with lower pay. They were going to reasses pay in 4 months\n\nI told my bosses boss it wasn't a 50 hour a week job, I can do it in 40. We agreed if I did it in 40 with highest numbers in my district they would adjust pay during reassessment. I was now making less than I was hired 2/3 of my salary for same job. I drained my savings to make it work. 4 months passed and after 10 emails that I escalated until manager of entire west coast operations was included did my boss tell me they had no intentions of adjusting anyone's pay.\n\nFine. I am hourly now, I will be hourly now. Get paid for phone calls? I will clock in every. Single. Call. I get paid for commute? I will take the long, slow route. I get paid for answering emails? My emails will be very detailed with all the product info I can find. You want me to talk to customers? Every customer wants a long conversation. Sales is out of my job description? I sell nothing, no new customers, no product suggestions unless asked, no extra tools (unless customer is struggling, I'm not a monster). Invoice issues? Above my pay grade, they can wait on hold with customer support. Customers can't call our work phones directly? No requested service until I get work order from customer support. Against state law to transport chemical? No chemical runs to customers that under order.\n\nMy customers need my attention, it's not in my job description to order more than I use and no one else stocks or organizes our shared storage. State law says we only work 5 out of every 7 days? Those 2 days my work phone is off, if a coworker on coverage needs a part ASAP? They should have restocked our shared storage because my perfectly stocked work truck is parked and locked. No one restock storage? I run out of stock on the weekend and storage is out? Customer will be down until Monday.\n\nIt takes me 10 minutes to fix what it takes other people more than an hour. Someday they will call me after 6 hours on an issue and I will solve it in 3 minutes over the phone.\n\nI am \"working\" 55 hours a week. Only 10 of that is actual work, 25 of that is driving and listening to podcasts, 20 is chatting or waiting for customers to notice I am there. My numbers are still best in the district. The hours and flexible and the benefits are good but still looking for new job. I can only be bored to tears for so long.",

        "text": "First, please forgive any format errors, I'm on mobile. I've finally decided to share this story and it's a blend of malicious compliance and entitlement, either way the behavior from a school teacher was abhorrent. Context: in middle school my kid was one of those popular kids. We raised him to have many interests, hobbies, and an open mind. He was the quarterback, but also a \"nerd\". So he had a wide friend base and we always had a few kids at the house and honestly it was a blast listening to Star Wars arguments quickly turn into why a certain NFL team drafted who. My kid refused to fall into any stereotype category and it made my Gen X heart proud.\n\nIn the fall of 2014 my son was assigned to do a book report on a Young Adult novel. He struggled to choose what book and finally settled on Divergent because it was the book we last read together. Now, my son doesn't like to read a lot but he loved to listen. We would take turns reading chapters out loud and discussing what we had read, it was just our bonding dynamic and it was fun. My kid also has a real hard time stringing sentences together to make sense on paper so he needed help. This english teacher was made aware of this during the open house before school started.\n\nSo my dude and I work on his book report and the required visual, he turns it in and he gets it back with a very low grade with the reason that it was not up to required standards. I emailed her and asked to explain and she pretty much said what she meant and he has a week to re-do the report. Ok, my son and I was livid because it was done correctly the first time. So we decided to go all out. We went to the craft store and got the supplies we needed. We really over did it to be honest, but it looked awesome. \n\nI'm a bit of an artist so I drew each character and taught my son how to do a character chart. We drew a picture of an apocalyptic Chicago skyline, to set the scene and used fairy lights to make the skyline twinkle. We rewrote his report and added more details of the book. Before he turned it in, I had a teacher friend look it over and she was floored on how detailed and eye catching it was. He turned it in. On the following Monday he came home with his book report project crying. She gave him a 0. I emailed her and asked why, the response was \"I never met a football player who could articulate a book like that and he clearly had someone else do the project\" I called the Principal and set up a meeting. \n\nDuring the meeting when the principal asked what was wrong with either project and she said that it was clearly plagiarized, I asked her to point out the websites or articles to indicate plagiarizism. Of course she couldn't and backtracked saying that she couldn't and doubled down that football players cant comprehend books\" I asked her why she thought that and she said she taught a certain NFL player in the Hall of Fame and she knows how they think. My response was \"all that explains is that we now know the reason why that guy is a dick\" and yes, the principal bought spewed her coffee everywhere. It was glorious. Needless to say, my son got an A and was switched teachers. That teacher was later fired (I wonder why). I know it's anti-climactic but it strengthened our bond knowing that his mom 100% had his back.",

Our gloves really need to fit well to avoid damaging samples. \n\nThe manager of our stock went on holidays for two weeks and it was back then already clear that we would run out of the size S gloves. I told my manager that it would be best that she tries to make an order for these gloves herself. But she insisted that we would not run out of gloves before the stock manager came out of holidays. \n\nTwo days later, we ran out of S gloves. She said we can just use M gloves instead. This would seriously affect our samples because with a size too big we drop and scratch them easily. \n\nSo now everyday I take 10 M gloves (as instructed) and cut off the pinky fingers. I wear the pinky fingers from the M gloves on each finger now.\nWe change gloves multiple times a day and the manager is using M gloves. Let's see what happens when we run out of M.",

Scored a new (contract) position with a major auto maker.  Sweet.\n\nExcept it was second shift, due to the availability of computer terminals.  Invariably, I'd finish up the work assigned by the first shift engineer I was supporting, and have way too much free time before the end of my day, and at that hour there were very few people in the facility with which to shoot the breeze or play cards to pass the time.  I wasn't allowed to clock out (determined by my being logged into the computer), the contracting firm wanted a 40-hour week on their books.\n\nI had already been writing custom tablets (digitizing menus, this was before mice were a thing) to stay busy.  So after a few months I began teaching myself the 3D modelling aspects of the software - but there was little opportunity for me to use it, and I got bored.  Then I started looking into the mainframe system itself, under the hood so to speak. I got to know the file system and most of the commands, and felt pretty comfortable with writing some simple batches.  This was a VAX/VMS system and the help menu was, well, helpful.\n\nThen I learned a command that was to set me free.  \"Wait\".  This was a command that when encountered in a batch would wait for a specified time period before executing the next command.  So each night, when I was done and wanted to go home and watch late-night TV, I wrote a batch.  The first thing the file did was to delete itself, although it was still running in memory.  Then it waited.  For whatever period of time was left in my shift.  And then ran the final command: \"logoff\".\n\nI called up a random project, started the batch, locked my screen, and left.  If anyone came by, they'd assume I was in the restroom or taking a smoke break.  I did this for about five months, never got called on it, they still got to bill their 40 hours.  My contract ended and I went on to another job where I wasn't so bored.  Some may question why I didn't just stick around and slack off 'til the end of my shift.  Look, folks, this was back before cell phones, back even before Internet, and you can only twiddle your thumbs for so long.  You may not agree with my choice, but I still remember with a grin that time in my life where I got paid to sit on my couch and watch Johnny Carson!",

As is normal in I.T., there were crises, patches and new software installs where it was all hands on deck for 16 hours, and other times when everything was humming along and there was not a lot of work to do. Old Boss understood this well. When we had to work late into the evening, he was fine with us coming in late the next day, leaving early, or even if a couple people didn't come in at all as long as we rotated who got to stay home so that there was some coverage. We were all salaried exempt but, overall, the hours were fair despite the occasional very very long days.\n\nNew boss comes in from a non-IT background and sees this system and decides everyone will be hourly and, worse, work set hours. If we were 10 minutes late, we had to use 10 minutes of PTO or be docked pay for the time, rather than just staying 10 minutes late. He also declared there would be ZERO overtime. This worked for about a week. It was slow and the people who would normally leave an hour early had to just sit at their desks and wait to clock out. \n\nThen the first major system issue happened where the email server crashed. We all punched out at 5 and went home. System stayed down until the following morning.\n\nWell, big boss comes down and wants to know why it took so long to bring the email system back and how it hurt the business. New boss mumbles something about no staffing in the evening. Big boss says it's never been a problem before. New boss tells us, from that point on, when something breaks we stay to fix it. Overtime starts piling up. Bis boss asks about budget. Several of us on the team decide to be brave and tell big boss what's going on and ask if things could just return to the way they were. Shortly after, an email is sent out saying new boss \"has decided to leave to take on another opportunity,\" i.e. was fired and that the I.T. dept was returning to salary exempt.",

I spent two hours making this place look about as perfect as it could. I cleaned up two half dead palm trees, trimmed all the bushes, mowed, edged, string trimmed, and cleaned up all the leaves I was able to. \n\nAn hour later Karen calls my company (me) to complain about the work done. Apparently “they” blew leaves into the corner of her property and left them. Well, that’s complete bullshit but okay, I’ll entertain the nonsense. The leaves in question were already in the back corner of the property embedded in the pine straw as they’d been there for quite awhile. Standard practice is blowing out any LOOSE leaves from garden beds and mulching or bagging them, which had been done. Karen didn’t really want to hear reason when I tried to explain this and insisted I send someone out to get the remaining leaves. \n\nI went back and got every leaf off of her property, including over 75% of the pine straw. Of course she called again to complain about her missing pine straw, at which point I reiterated the same thing I told her before. I let her know I’d be happy to replace the pine straw for $400.

He pulled out the ones furthest away from the house and let that regrow into native bushland at the back.\n\nThe neighbours in behind weren't a fan of this, as they used that land to tend to their grapes and now had to be more careful with their tractor so they didn't hit anything. They complained to nonno several times, eventually threatening to get a surveyor in and forcing him to prune his property back to that line. He told them to get off his property and slammed the door.\n\nWell, said neighbour DID get a surveyor in; want to know what they found? There was indeed a discrepancy - the last row of vines planted by that neighbour *was on nonno's land all along.* Nonno knew this, he just had never been bothered to call in a surveyor as it hadn't been a problem up until now. After the verdict came through, he happily removed the offending plants on the property boundary and the neighbours lost a row of vines.\n\nTLDR: neighbour tells nonno to remove plants on boundary and calls a surveyor in, neighbour's vines are on boundary so nonno pulled *their* vines out.\n\n\n Here is the other story: https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/vq3pld/wont_shift_your_bike_hope_you_like_it_now/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button",

So I grabbed my toothbrush, knocked on his door and smiled as sweetly as possible.\n\n“Neighbour, I need to use my electric device now and since you offered your help…”\n\nHis face lit up until I shoved my toothbrush in his face and realisation dawned. I’ve never seen anyone turn this red this fast.\n\nFor the next few weeks I knocked on his door every time I brushed my teeth. And since I decided my dental hygiene was a priority now, I upped brushing my teeth from twice to thrice a day.\n\nHe got super uncomfortable every time I knocked and asked him about dental hygiene tips, but he never was creepy towards me again.",

It's worth pointing out that our daughter LOVES laying al fresco on the changing pad and is always happy and giggly when doing so.  Just as we're about to try the swapping process a 2nd time I say to her \"Do you think you could not shit for the next 10 seconds?\"  Cue the malicious compliance!  The moment the old diaper becomes free of her, she pees all over the changing pad, and her mom's hand.  A lot.  All we could do at that point was just laugh. \n\nMaybe it was malicious compliance, or maybe it was just a coincidence.  Either way, it's a funny story we fully intend to share with her when she's older.",

        "text": "I applied for a job to install equipment for a large company that sells cleaning and sanitation chemicals and tools to every place you can imagine, they have a separate pest control branch and hospital supplier branch. I applied to install their leased equipment, but was immediately promoted to sales and service in a bait and hook scheme. It was 25% more hours, on call 24 hours, some weekends but the did the math so the annual pay was the same.. They \"couldn't\" give me a raise within the first 2 years but apparently could bend the promoting before 2 years rule. Whatever, I needed to get promoted to a salary position anyway. \n\nI talked to my district manager, he agreed to let me work 5 more hours overtime a week and sell new accounts. Giving me more cash and working towards promotion. I got many recognitions, met with global management to share my ideas, was on product development teams as field tester, 6 of my ideas were rolled out nationally and I was still second from bottom of the chain.\n\nGot promoted to a salary and commission sales and service role (40 hour weeks, no lease machines, no late night calls), used my sales skills to making 3-4k a month above my old salary just in commissions.  4 months in this role they bring us all in, tell us they are removing all salary positions and everyone was getting new titles with lower pay. They were going to reasses pay in 4 months\n\nI told my bosses boss it wasn't a 50 hour a week job, I can do it in 40. We agreed if I did it in 40 with highest numbers in my district they would adjust pay during reassessment. I was now making less than I was hired 2/3 of my salary for same job. I drained my savings to make it work. 4 months passed and after 10 emails that I escalated until manager of entire west coast operations was included did my boss tell me they had no intentions of adjusting anyone's pay.\n\nFine. I am hourly now, I will be hourly now.\nGet paid for phone calls? I will clock in every. Single. Call. I get paid for commute? I will take the long, slow route. I get paid for answering emails? My emails will be very detailed with all the product info I can find. You want me to talk to customers? Every customer wants a long conversation. Sales is out of my job description? I sell nothing, no new customers, no product suggestions unless asked, no extra tools (unless customer is struggling, I'm not a monster). Invoice issues? Above my pay grade, they can wait on hold with customer support. Customers can't call our work phones directly? No requested service until I get work order from customer support. Against state law to transport chemical? No chemical runs to customers that under order.\n\nMy customers need my attention, it's not in my job description to order more than I use and no one else stocks or organizes our shared storage. State law says we only work 5 out of every 7 days? Those 2 days my work phone is off, if a coworker on coverage needs a part ASAP? They should have restocked our shared storage because my perfectly stocked work truck is parked and locked. No one restock storage? I run out of stock on the weekend and storage is out? Customer will be down until Monday.\n\nIt takes me 10 minutes to fix what it takes other people more than an hour. Someday they will call me after 6 hours on an issue and I will solve it in 3 minutes over the phone.\n\nI am \"working\" 55 hours a week. Only 10 of that is actual work, 25 of that is driving and listening to podcasts, 20 is chatting or waiting for customers to notice I am there. My numbers are still best in the district. The hours and flexible and the benefits are good but still looking for new job. I can only be bored to tears for so long.",

        "text": "Background - I work for a kind of ISP doing inhouse testing of systems to design new solutions for customers.  This some times requires an active internet connection, which had to be activated by our airtime department, as it could be quite expensive in theory. Only the accounting part is done by the airtime department, the actual activations is something we can do ourselves, but not allowed to do so without airtime consent.\n\nPreviously I had merely asked our local airtime team to activate a system for the duration of the test then deactivate again once test was completed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd this is where our story begins.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA change from upper management meant that our local airtime department got cancelled and all its functions were moved back to HQ in another country.\n\nThis worked out ok for a short time, until someone in management brought in a new boss for the companys airtime department.\n\nMeet \"Powerboss\". A new boss with little insight in how operations work, but with extremely anal desire to make sure every little rule is followed to the letter, does not matter if it makes sense or not.\n\nI quickly started to get a massive dislike towards this boss. We have all sorts of little conflicts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExample 1.\n\nI file a request to have a system activated within the current week as we have a MAJOR (one of the biggest companies in the world) customer coming by to see the systems late in the following week. It takes time for the databases to fill up once the system is activated, so it is important this this done in good time to allow for this.\n\nI hear nothing during the week but assume all is ok. Until Monday morning where I found out the system is not activated. (for data to fill up, only airtime can do this portion of the activation)\n\nI call the airtime department and ask what is going on, why it has not been activated.\n\n\"Powerboss\" decided to take the activation out of the standard queue to show it to the team for an internal training how to do activations.\n\nI am of course furious at this point, why they have not called me or informed me about this as this is a major problem. I insist they do this now. \"powerboss\" informs me that this is his decision and he is ok with this.\n\nAt this time I kind of lose it and inform him politely but firmly that he has one job and that is to ensure that systems get activated, and he best do that job, if not I will have to take it to his superiors in order for the system to be activated ASAP so it can be ready for presentation with the potential customer.\n\nSystem gets activated during that day, but the following day I learn from one of the upper management bosses that \"powerboss\" had reached out to HR and threatened to file a personal harassment case against me. HR denied this though as they saw no reason for it.\n\nI am like \"WTF??\" A harassment case over asking someone to do their job?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQueue example 2 and the MC.\n\nI need an urgent activation of a system, and for this we - with the new system - have to file activation reports with all details, quite tedious for something purely internal and temporary. None the less I do this and send it over.\n\nIt gets rejected by \"Powerboss\" because all it has not been signed by one of the VPs who are the only one authorized to activate a system for a customer with a writeoff in the thousands of USD. Though it is kind of a theoretical thing, as the internal cost is virtually nothing. I try to argue that it is quite a lot of work to chase down a VP for a signature when it is a very limited time and purely internal. \"Powerboss\" denies this and says very firmly \"Only people on the list in the bottom of the activation form are allowed to approve this. Your name is not on this list, so you cannot approve. Talk to a VP\"\n\nHmph! It takes time but I chase down a VP in another country and get him to sign the document and get the system activated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA couple of weeks later, \"Powerboss\" is in our new call center in Asia, out to do a demonstration on how the systems work and what it looks like in real life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurns out that \"Powerboss\" needs a system activated and calls in and requests this. By some stroke of absolute luck, I pick up the phone.\n\nPB - \"Hello I need system XX activated\"\n\nMe - \"Do you have a signed activation form?\"\n\nPB - \"I dont need one, I am telling you to activate the system\"\n\nMe - \"According to yourself, all activations MUST have an activation form\"\n\nPB - \"Fine I am sending it in now\"\n\nMe - \"I do not see any signature on this form, it needs to be approved by a VP\"\n\nPB - \"But I am head of airtime, this is me writing these forms, I decide who can approve and who cannot\"\n\nMe - \"Your name is not listed on the form as one of the people who are allowed to approve\"\n\nPB(who at this time is yelling at me)- \"CLEARLY THAT IS A MISTAKE ON THE FORM, JUST ACTIVATE!!\"\n\nMe - \"Only authorized personnel can do this, your name is not on the list\"\n\nPB  - \"FINE!!!\" Then hangs up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy god it felt good :D\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPowerboss obviously complained to one of the VPs about this, but they merely shrugged and said that he himself had made the rules and the documents, that I was merely following the rules that he himself had set.\n\nHilarious :D",

Everyone had found their seats and were enjoying those precious few moments before we were told to stop talking.  I was far from a rebellious kid, nor did I ever really swear, but for whatever reason a four letter word that began with the letter “s” slipped out of my mouth. Apparently my teacher took classroom discipline quite seriously, and was paying more attention than anyone thought, because she immediately singled me out. I was told that that kind of language was not tolerated in her classroom and as a punishment, I was to write out that word 500 times. No joke - 500. \n\nI took this as a person challenge. Upon getting home from school, I went to my dads office and found the biggest sheets of paper I could find. At the time, he had a large Dot Matrix printer that used large legal size sheets of paper. These were continuous sheets, so they were connected into one enormous ream. I then grabbed a big black sharpy and went to work. For the next hour or two I took great joy in writing “SH$%T!” in huge letters - one word per page. Perhaps the fumes made the process more enjoyable than it should have been.\n\nThe next day at the start of class, I walked to the front of the room, slammed a thick stack of paper on her desk and said, “Here’s your pile of sh$%ts.” Without another word I turned around and sat back in my chair. Amazingly, I don’t remember her saying anything in response. But I never had another issue with her again. \n\n\nack in the 7th grade, which would have been the early 90s. It was the golden sliver of time when everyone had gotten to their seat but class hadn’t started",

I'm not going to go into family history details, but my father-in-law has not, does not, and will not ever like me. I married his little girl, and thus I am the enemy. I can do zero right in his eyes, and he always thinks I'm against him.\n\nThe holiday weekend started fine and we were getting along. But as the days passed, FIL could not contain his disdain for me and the subtle insults and underhandedness began. I've always just shut my mouth and took it to keep the peace.\n\nWell, on the final day FIL planned a surprise party for his wife since it was their wedding anniversary. We were all hiding in the dining room with cake, food, and some gifts for her and being quiet. Well, I look over and see my 8yo son looking very green in the face. I could tell he was about to throw-up. I go over to him and ask if he is going to be sick. He nods. I tell him to run upstairs to the bathroom.\n\nWell at the door my FIL grabs him and refuses to let him leave. I tell my son \"go upstairs now.\" FIL looks at me with a death stare and asks \"Why are you trying to ruin this?!? He can't leave!\" I turn to my son and say, \"Okay, throw up there on the floor.\" FIL looks at my son and sees the green face....and it was too late. It all happened in slow motion and the look of terror on his face was amazing. My kid blew chunks right there on the floor. It was amazing.",

(He also made kids ask permission to take our uniform sweaters off in class and once reprimanded me for taking mine off even though I'd asked him as soon as I walked in the room...but I digress.)\n\nThis was in the early 2000s when those gel/milky pens were popular. I had one in a REALLY light blue. Looked great on black paper, not so much on regular white paper. So I turned in at least one written assignment in that pen. The teacher made a comment that was difficult to read and I pointed out that he'd required blue or black ink and this was in fact blue ink. He just nodded and said ok.\n\nI wish I could say I started using my far more legible dark purple ink after that without complaint, but it was a long time ago so I don't remember for sure. Can confirm that I felt like a 16 year old genius using the light blue pen though.",

        "text": " \n\nMany years ago I was doing some installation work at a customer’s site. It was a multi-week job and included running fiber-optic cabling, power lines, and installing various terminals and nodes. The customer had negotiated a weekly payment plan based on progress. Due to the fact that the site was an operating business, we did everything we could to minimize the disruption. To that end, we worked Wednesday to Sunday and stayed away Monday and Tuesday\n\nAt the end of the first week, the finance department contacted the customer to process the first payment. The customer explained that they wouldn’t pay, and understood now why it costs so much when “your staff aren’t working during the week and only working at the weekends so they can get double pay” (it was fairly common for Saturdays to pay time and a half, and Sundays to pay double time…but ONLY after you had worked a full week). My manager didn’t get the chance to explain that we were working our weekends to minimize the impact on her business because she never stopped ranting and raving.\n\nSo, we stopped working at weekends and instead went back to Monday to Friday…blocking doors so customers couldn’t enter the store, turning off power so we could run and connect cables. It was amusing to hear the customer begging my manager to change the working hours because they were losing business. I remember laughing when he did that typical salesman approach of sucking through his teeth as he was saying “well..of course if we have to work at weekends there would be an increase in costs”",

Okay, then. Ask and ye shall receive. \n\nI replied to all, apologizing. “I am so sorry for the misunderstanding. When you called and said the meeting was canceled, I assumed that minutes were unnecessary. I have attached the agenda with your responses to each line item.” You see, despite being new in the position, for some reason *I* was expected to know and ask what to be trained on.

        "text": "Here I am again folks (after 5 years I guess), with another professional malicious compliance. \n\nIn June of 2021, I joined a tech startup (last-mile grocery and food delivery app) as financial controller. I was told my task is to bring the gross profits into black within a year and before next round of investment / fund-raising. \n\nThe senior team comprised of me, Group CFO, COO and head of grocery. The CEO was stationed outside in another country. \n\nThe CEO comes to the country within a month of my joining but does not bother to meet me. I say ok no problem, keep your head down and do what you are tasked with. Within 2 months, I have the grips on operations and financials and I have laid down my plan with Group CFO and he agrees to it. I make some changed in my team and I get to working on fixing things. \n\nDuring October, one of our competitor raises $85 million in investment and our CEO is irked. He comes again and starts an impromptu investment round. The conditions are better than before so we get an offer of $50 million (because our overall plan was a lot smaller and realistic than our competitor). The CEO rejects the offer he needs an offer of at least $100 million to beat the competitor. \n\nLuckily, we get offered $200 million but the CEO refuses citing this is greater than what I need and goes back without accepting anything. \n\nCome February, Group CFO suddenly quits (But I knew he quit since our funds were depleting rapidly and the economic conditions in the country and globally were getting worse). \n\nI have an emergency meeting with COO and Grocery Head and tell them that we need to rationalize our expenses further and this is the plan; according to which, we will be profitable by June 2022. They agree to it and I get to work with my team. The CEO again does not talk to me and the CFO post remains vacant despite me being next in line and eligible for it. \n\nCome March 2022, My plan is on track and we are expecting profitability a month earlier in May 2022. I plan to take a week-long vacation and travel abroad with my spouse. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the 3rd day of vacations, I get a text from COO that I need to come back as something has happened. I tell him I'll come back as planned and not to worry. I come back and find out that the supply-chain team made an error and bought inventory $30 million more than planned for the festive season coming up in May. In my absence, the grocery head gave the go ahead without consulting me and the error was only identified once the vendors started fulfilling the order. This has shook our overall plan and our cash funds are at bottom. \n\nMr. CEO comes to know about this (I was the one to inform him) and he immediately comes down and started literally abusing me and other members of the team verbally. This is his first ever face-to-face meeting with me. I was quite taken aback by his rudeness and hurt as he put all blame on me saying I am the CFO (when I was never appointed as such so no payments / purchases were approved by me. They were being approved by COO / Head of Grocery). \n\nThis verbal abuse goes on for about a week during which I had broken down twice in front of my wife as I had never faced such horseshit before in my career and I had worked really hard to bring the company where it was at that point.  The CEO warns us that whoever is found guilty of negligence will be fired on the spot. This is where the malicious compliance begins. \n\nI prepare detailed documents pointing out my plan and who approved the extra purchase and how I was consulted only after the error has occurred. I even prepared a plan to sell of the excess inventory and bring the money back in the fold. I try to reach him to explain but he brushes me off every time saying you cannot be right. \n\nAfter 7 days, the CEO calls us in office on a weekend. I arrive and head of grocery is there. They are arguing and it is getting heated up. It gets so heated up that the head of grocery, shouts back and leaves citing that he quits. \n\nAs soon as leaves, the CEO pounded his fist on the table and shouted \"If you don't agree with me, leave right now! Only I know how to run this company and if you think I cannot work without you, think again!\"\n\nThe moment I heard these words spewing out of his mouth, I switch to auto-pilot, I type in my resignation, e-mail him right there, get up and say to him: \"please check your e-mail, my notice starts now.\" \n\nI leave the building before he could respond. Immediately, I call up my one of my ex-boss / mentor and tell him I need to meet him.\n\nWe meet, within a week, we planned to start our own consultancy firm and six months from then, our firm has started to grow. We are working on our startup, setting up another business and managing top-tier clients. \n\nThen... I get a message from that CEO through the COO after a few months of my leaving: \" Hey.... we need your help managing the books and finances. Our position is really bad.\"\n\nI simply say \"The CEO won't agree with what I have to do to fix the company, and I don't work with clients who don't agree with me\". \n\nTL;DR: The CEO dared to leave if you don't \"agree\" with his tactics. I accept his challenge, resign on the spot and start my own firm whereas the CEO and his company are on the verge of bankruptcy.",

        "text": "This happened several years ago. \n\nAfter onboarding a new job, I was told I could hire an assistant. The HR director, Kelly, handed me a stack of resumes, told me about a friend's daughter, and bumped \"Kat\" to the top of my interview list. Kat passed the tech test with high scores and interviewed well so, I hired her.\n\nKat showed up to work on time, had a good attitude, performed well on assignments, and was generally a pleasant person all around. After probation, Kat was excited to tell me that her last raise was enough to get an apartment with her BF.\n\nIt was a couple months after her raise I started to notice Kelly spending an inordinate amount of time talking to Kat. The convos sounded personal / cordial and Kelly was friends with Kat's mom so, I didn't think much about it... until one day Kelly barges in my office.\n\n\"Did you know Kat moved into an apartment with her boyfriend?\"\n\n\"I might have heard something about that.\"\n\n\"Well, Kat is pregnant and her mom is devastated...\" and proceeds to fill me in on the details on Kat's personal life.\n\nUncomfortablly, I interrupt acting like I have a lot going on.\n\n\"This really isn't any of my business.  If there's something related to Kat's performance that we need to discuss, please fill me in but as for me Kat is doing a great job.\"\n\nA few months pass. Kat's baby bump is starting to show. Kelly is again in my office.\n\n\"Kat is not in compliance with the dress code.\"\n\nLast staff meeting, Kelly handed out a dress code policy with a collage  various womens shoes and dresses and suits presumably cut from fashion magazines to assist us determine what was acceptable from what was not. I picked up the policy and the Clipart sheets with a stare reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's I'm Of A Mind To Make Some Mookie! Batman / Joker scene.\n\n\"Is she wearing something in the 'not allowed' clippings?\" As I began to spread the clip art around my desk.\n\n\"She isn't wearing maternity clothes\" as Kelly points to the bullet about maternity clothes in the policy.\n\n\"Well, the policy clearly says maternity wear is allowed. Kat is clearly pregnant and she is wearing clothes, so...\"\n\n\"You know what I mean when I say maternity clothes. Clothes from a maternity store!\"\n\nI told Kelly that I would talk to Kat, which I did. Kat filled me in that there was some drama with her mom not liking her BF, that Kelly is involved. etc. etc. I just told her to read the policy and be sure she complies - and no matter what, to trust me: I had her back.\n\nThe next day Kelly is in my office telling me that Kat is again not in compliance with the dress code. At this point Kelly knows I'm getting frustrated.\n\n \"OK. I'll talk to her again. This time I want you present because I'm going to give her a formal warning and assign remedial training.\"\n\nI bring Kat into my office with Kelly present and formally read off my prepared statement making it clear that it will go into her permanent file.\n\n \"Kat, you were given a verbal warning yesterday to comply with this dress code. Because it is not clear to me what is or is not a violation of this policy, you are to report to the HR office 10 minutes early every morning for the next two weeks for dress code inspection. Report to me if HR finds your dress unfit. If you are found to be in violation of this policy and are unable to correct your dress before the start of the work day, your employment will be terminated.\"\n\nBy the time I'm finished, Kat is tearing up and Kelly is staring at the floor, speechless. I dismiss Kat.\n\n\"I hope that this is the last I hear about this because if I do, I'll fire her.\" as Kelly, speechless, walks out of my office.\n\nI told Kat not to worry about any of this; we have them where we want them. So, for a week Kat reported to me that her clothes were fine per HR inspection. At the beginning of the second week she was chuckling, \"Kelly told me that I look 'very nice' today.\" Attitudes began to change and everyone was smiling.\n\nI got called to the red carpet by Jim, the CEO. He tried to keep a straight face as he recited what he heard was going on and asked me to cut the remedial training short becuase it was embarrassing the HR staff.\n\nStraight faced I said, \"Well, Jim, if I stop the remedial training, I'd have to fire Kat. Company Policy clearly states that failure to complete a formal remediation plan is immediate termination. It is very clear... there is zero tolerance.\"\n\n\"You can't fire a pregnant woman for what she wears. I'm asking... no, I'm TELLING you to stop.\"\n\n\"Stop following company policy?\"\n\nLaughing he concedes \"Ok. I am rescinding that ridiculous dress code policy effective immediately.\"",

        "text": "This story starts out malicious, but becomes kind of heartwarming.\n\nA couple of years ago I was working temp services as a pc tech and got assigned to a company for what was supposed to be a couple of days, but got extended to a couple of months. The first day I walked in, I noticed that one of the enmpty desks had a huge pile of broken laptops behind the chair. Every couple of days, one of my fellow techs would walk past and put another broken laptop on top. I finally asked one of them why they were doing that. That's when I was told that the desk belonged to \"Dave\", one of the shift supervisors.\nHe had put a rule in place that nobody was allowed to recycle a broken laptop other than himself. We could recycle parts, but not the whole thing. Apparently he had gotten in trouble in the past because one of the techs accidentally recycled a computer that was supposed to be held on to, and he decided that only he could recycle them.\nWell Dave got seriously sick and was out on medical leave for several months, and since he was the only one authorized to recycle the computers, the other techs just piled the broken systems up behind his desk. After the first pile got to about 6 feet tall, they started a second pile and so on.\nWell, as his leave extended from 1 month to several months, the guys started leaving post-it notes on the pile. First it was little snarky stuff like, \"We raise a shrine to our lord Dave\". \"All hail Dave, the Great Recycler.\" \"If Dave can't recycle these, no one can.\"\nThen it later turned to stuff like, \"I miss Dave.\" \"We all miss Dave.\" \"I hope Dave comes back soon.\" The piles eventually became a shrine to Dave.\n\nSo Dave finally comes back and sees the three huge piles of broken laptops, and first he is pissed. Then as he's going through them, he starts seeing the notes and alternates between laughing and sniffing. I know it took him 3 days to clear them all out, but I don't know what happened after that because my contract was over.",

I reply that I'm disabled and cannot stand for the trip.

        "text": "2 yrs ago, I hit a warthog sized raccoon on my way home from work. I was driving an 09 Suzuki sx4 hatchback. The raccoon did a good bit of body damage to the front bumper and wheel well. \n\nThe estimate to repair it was $2200. I giggled at the adjuster when said the insurance company was approving the  repair instead of totaling the car. He insisted it was work just under 5k so it should be fixed. \n\nI told him that having owned the car for a decade, it’s a PITA to get some parts since Suzuki closed their US business. \n\nHe insisted. \n\nInsurance provided a rental. It ran ~$800/week. (Had a rider for a better rental.)\n\nSo 4 weeks go by. The car isn’t repaired. The shop can’t find a wheel well to finish the job. \n\nAdjuster calls, a bit mad a me that I wasn’t pressuring the body shop. I reminded him that I have insurance to make me whole and that’s not my job. The repairs were a bit more expensive than anticipated. $2500 repairs+ Covid cleaning fee $200= $2700+$3200 for the rental. They had now spent more than the alleged value of the car. \n\nSo no the adjuster insists the car is drive able without the wheel well while he finds the part. I offered that was a stupid idea and it’s there to protect the engine compartment. He insists. OK…. \n\nI drive it. My work is 30 miles away.I drove it through a snow storm. With no wheel well the snow was thrown into the engine compartment. Immediately in-front of the affected wheel is the battery, fuses and computer. They were all absolutely caked in snow, salt and ice. \n\nNow all the dash lights are going off randomly and the car is shutting itself off. \n\nI called the adjuster and told him that driving without the wheel well has likely ruin the computer, fuse box and battery. I asked which shop has a contract with them to fix these issues. \n\nBig Sigh on the other end. Pregnant pause. \n\nWe’ll I think we’ve spend enough on this car. We’ll just total you out. It’s probably on worth 2k so that’s what will pay you. Mwah ha ha ha. Nope you said just under 5k. That’s what I want. \n\nThey wrote me a check for ~$4700. All in I figure they spent about $10,000 on a vehicle worth at best 5k. I would have accepted 3k or less if they offered it originally. \n\nTL;DR: insurance company refused to listen to me and paid 2x the value of the vehicle for the claim.",
