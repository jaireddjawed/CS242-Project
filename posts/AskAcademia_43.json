I am looking at PhD programs right now, and, despite how arbitrary such rankings may be, looking at NRC departmental rankings and \"global\" rankings (QS, THE). However, sometimes the differences between the two can be quite substantial. I'll give one example to illustrate: the NRC ranks University of Oregon somewhat significantly higher than Cornell; however, UOregon clearly doesn't have remotely the reputation or prestige of Cornell. So I'm wondering how one should go about balancing the two considerations - and, for example, to what extent something like NRC Rankings are taken into consideration. Like, if I decided to go to UOregon over Cornell because of its NRC ranking, would any university at which I wanted to do a post-doc recognize that the program is supposedly better, or does the gleam of institutional prestige normally ultimately look better? lol. (Also I know there are of course many other factors that go into choosing a school but)\nThanks in advance!",

I love what we do in class (Calculus, complex number, basics like that) but I LOVE just reading online about all sorts of more abstract mathematical things, like Godel's theorems and dimensional mathematics, manifolds, all that awesome stuff.  \nMy ideal career would basically be pure mathematics - researching new and interesting concepts in Mathematics. The thing is, I don't know how one goes about pursuing a career like this. Do I get a Bachelor of Mathematics, then go on and do a PhD and become a professor at a university? Or would the best option be to become highly proficient in Mathematics then apply it to a career in another field I enjoy.\n\nAll advice and feedback is welcome!\n\n(yes, I did copy and paste from my comment in r/maths)",

She even convinced me to retake the GRE about 18 months ago to keep my scores up to date. \n\nAnd last week, she showed me a savings plan she put together that would have us saving $35k over the next three years for supplementing our income if I was a student again. That doesn't touch our retirement savings or savings for our kids' college funds.\n\nThing is, I don't want to make the same mistake as before.

I've been building this career for several years. \n\nI'm pursuing research because I have unanswered questions I've always wanted to investigate, and I pretty much want to think for a living. But honestly? I'm terrified.\n\nI'm a chronic avoidant procrastinator. I don't want to waste my life paralyzed, *almost* ready to actually do my work. And I don't want to come home after a long day and know that I have *more work to do.* \n\nI'm also quickly bored. I'm an idea man who hops from interest to interest, and I seem better suited for a career in rapid problem-solving or revolving cycles of innovation. I've thought about taking my sociology and psychology background to advertising, for instance. Perhaps there's also other options I'm not considering.\n\nI don't know if long-term commitment just isn't in my personality (and I need to work with that), or if I just need to somehow develop that grit. But it's been a while, and I've only succeeded with obsessive energy or all-consuming, desperate will.\n\n**TLDR:** I constantly procrastinate and I'm quickly bored. I basically want to think for a living, but I wonder if I'd be happier in a more rapid-fire career. How do I know if a PhD is really right for me? ",

There is one student who legitimately should not be there. He isn't a bad human being, but when it comes to the stuff done in class, he doesn't know what he is doing and really needs help and more time to learn some of these things. Also, when it comes to being a team player or working in a group, there have been conflicts and issues. An example of this is when he asks for assistance doing a task, then you try and help him, and he will snap at you and he says that he knows what he is doing. When given a task solo, he never completes it and leaves others to do it. An example of this is when he was tasked by our project manager to create a base installation of an operating system and a few select programs, install them, then clone to other drives. 4+ weeks later at 3 days a week, still never finished it, we had to do it for him. When he asked why, we politely said that we are behind schedule and need to get it done. In a team based project, he does \"just enough\" and everyone else has to pick up the slack. And like the occasional team, he tries to throw people under the bus and blame others for what he did/didn't do.    \n\nThe issue is to how to not be mean, but to be honest without being a jackass.",

        "text": "Hi AskAcademia, I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to post, but I just really needed to hear answers from people who have been through this, as I will likely find myself in similar--if not more difficult--situations. \n\nI am currently a rising junior at an Ivy. I have been accepted into a year-long study abroad program at Cambridge. At the time it seemed like an opportunity impossible to pass out, especially since one of the professors in my college house is someone whose work I admire immensely. \n\nHowever, since I have been accepted into the program, I have started seeing someone very seriously. It has only been going on for a few months but it feels much longer. The caveat is, of course, that I will be moving away for two semesters, whereas he will stay in my college town. \n\nHe is a few years older and works full time, which means he does not have as much free time to just fly around and visit me. Moreover, finance is also a huge issue for the both of us. Right now it feels like the only way going forward is breaking up, and I really resent that. He's mentioned before that he broke up with his ex girlfriend of 5 years due to distance (among other issues, of course). It will definitely be hard, since right now we spend all of our time together, and next year I won't be able to see him at all. \n\nOn the other hand, even if we follow through with long distance, I will only be back in my college town for a year, before I have to begin thinking about grad school, which will most likely result in me moving again... Beyond that, just by speaking with my professors, it seems that the \"two-body\" problem is pretty common among academics. \n\nI have always moved around a lot as a child due to my mother's work, which is why at first I didn't expect myself to mind all the traveling all that much. Now, however, I am really afraid that it will prevent me from forming important relationships with other people, especially romantically. \n\nThis is my first serious relationship, and I feel like I already have to make the decision between my \"career\" and my personal life. I feel very overwhelmed about the future. I am absolutely certain that I wish to be in academia, and I am definitely on the right track, at least academically speaking. However, now I am worried about a whole other aspect of that: I genuinely think that I might never be able to find a long-lasting relationship, due to all the potential traveling.  ",

        "text": "TL;DR Is it okay for a random undergrad to email a few professors at my university asking them to explain the field they study in order to better understand what I might want to research?\n\nA few months ago I finished my first year of my dual degree in computer science and math (I consider myself more a CS student than a math student even though I have deep interest in both). About half way through my second semester I was talking with a professor and he told me about a program through the university that gave undergraduates funding to do research in the summer. At the time I was talking with him the deadline had already passed for that summer, but he told me how I should be thinking about it for next year/the future. \n\nAs of right now it's half way through the summer, and I've been thinking about how I can best figure out what exactly I'd want to be doing in research as well as increase my chances for getting into this program (I believe the majority of the funding comes from NSERC in Canada btw). One field I've been interested in is computational geometry, but the only textbook I can find on it is supposed to be for graduate level and above, and goes way over my head. I'd be interested in anything on the mathematical side of CS though, but I haven't been able to find anything specific to focus in on yet. \n\nI was wondering if I'd be okay to email professors whose research interests align with what I have some interest in and ask to meet with them. I'd basically ask if they could give me a broad overview of what the field is they research is before explaining what their current research is so I can both get a grasp on what they do, and whether I have interest in it. I'd do some reading on the topics beforehand so I'm not blind going into it though (which is what I want to be doing for the rest of this summer). I guess my question is whether it's okay to ask this from professors I've never had classes or strong interaction with, and whether this is the best way to go about increasing my chances of getting a summer research position? If not, how could I go about learning what I want to focus on without reading textbooks I barely understand?\n\nQuick Edit: Please tell me if this question better suited for the weekly undergrad thread.",

Everything I've read about getting a data science job indicates that one of the best ways to get an interview is to have some projects up on git that you can show off. I have 3 parts of my concern.\n\n1: I want to put up some of the codes I used, mostly for data analysis, on git. I wrote it 100% myself. However some of the ideas came from my PI. I'm sure I could put this on git if I wanted since it's just my own original python code, but what do you think would be appropriate as a reference to the PI? Just \"thanks to X for support\"? Do I need to notify the PI that I'm doing this? I would ask him, but he has left the uni permanently and has not sent any emails in nearly a month. I'm not sure if I can even contact him anymore. \n\n2: A data analysis code is not much use without showing the data, right? So the code mentioned in #1 would probably have some data alongside it. However it's my research data, generated with commercial computational chemistry software. The research is unpublished, and won't be published, since my project is basically DOA. The data is mostly just some numbers, out of the context of what it means, it wouldn't be very useful for anyone \"scooping\" the idea. However since I generated the data using the uni's supercomputer, how would the permissions for this work? And since it was generated with commercial software, would I need to cite it?\n\n3: Another code that I want to put up is a custom module for an open-source freely distributed molecular dynamics package. I would not be distributing the MD package itself (even though it's open source and free, anyone can get it). Rather I want to upload a C++ code I created that heavily calls upon the MD package's math libraries but does not include the package's source code. Since it's open source, do you think this would be OK?\n\nI know that all these questions should probably be directed at my PI, but that seems impossible for now, unfortunately. Maybe I can ask one of his collaborators or see if the uni has a legal office...",

Most of my contact with them occurred about 5 years ago:\n\n* They taught me one 4th year undergraduate seminar course\n* They encouraged me to turn one of my projects in the above course in to a project to be presented at a university-wide function and they oversaw (acted as an adviser) the project. \n* I conducted a small amount of paid research as an undergrad student for them (8 hours worth of summarizing existing literature on a topic)\n* They wrote me one letter of reference for one of the four graduate programs I applied for (the only school that required 3 letters of reference; the other schools only required 2 so I used 2 professors who I was more familiar with at the time).\n\nGiven my above experience, is that experience sufficient for me to write a letter of recommendation on? If so, what sort of details should I include in the letter? Are there any examples of what I should write? Any information or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",

There are many reasons why this is the case:\n\n1. They are bad at stats and analysis.\n2. They make questionable (to put it nicely) design choices\n3. Their actual process of science is inefficient/bad, sometimes outright unsavory- driven by intuition and ego rather than literature reviews, fishing/p-hacking, etc.\n4. They have no funding/money and have not indicated any ambition to get any.\n5. They aren't suggesting conferences to go to, helping me network and introducing me to other researchers.\n6. They aren't respected within our department because generally everyone thinks they are an idiot.\n7. Their writing is bad, and guidance is also generally bad.\n8. They are not allowing me to do work I am interested in or came here to do. Every time I bring it up, they just don't listen and keep telling me about things they want me to do for other projects. Essentially, it doesn't seem like they want to train me to be a good scientist, but rather use me as a tool to do the research they are interested in.\n\nAll the problems above are not just things I've experienced. I've seen them manifest in their other grad students' and honors students' work. It's gotten to the point where I dread going to our meetings because not only is it unhelpful, I'm usually in a worse off position than before we had met. I know what I need to do, I know that I need to switch advisors, but I don't know how to navigate this politically and handle the social ramifications of doing so. Especially since my advisor thinks we have a great relationship and everything is great. Also because there really isn't anyone else in the department who is doing anything close to what I'm interested in, or that I have a relationship with (I'm still relatively new so I haven't developed many faculty relationships). \n\nThe whole process has been extremely stressful, and I haven't been excited about doing research/science in a while, which sucks. So I guess I'm looking for some input/validation here. Thanks!\n\n*Edit- just to clarify: I am funded by my department, so I am not explicitly beholden to my advisor in any way (fiscal or otherwise), also, a typo.",

My goal is to be a PI at a primarily undergraduate institution, and it seems like the Institutional Research and Academic Career Development Award ([IRACDA](https://www.nigms.nih.gov/Training/CareerDev/Pages/TWDInstRes.aspx)) program might make me an attractive candidate for a PUI. However, part of me worries that a PI might be reluctant to have an IRACDA postdoc in their lab because they wouldn't be doing research full time. Has anyone here participated in this program and if so, could you share your experience? Thanks!\n\n## ",

However even [Noam Chomksy, most affaimed anti-colonialist of all time, *defended* Gilley](https://www.thecollegefix.com/post/36998/) on the grounds that this opens \"dangerous doors\" if they articles are allowed to be censored because it conters prevailing opinion. \n\nGilley's adversaries claim that \"free-speech\" was abused, however research findings does not always give the researchER (s) the intended results. It woudn't do scholars any good to ignore established fact. If a controversial finding is to be overcome, then it must be challenged by means of counter-evidence, not cenosorship.\n\n* By academic standards, was the paper *The Case for Colonialism* retracted fairly? If so, how did Gilley use \" poor scholarship?\"\n* Should academic speech have exceptions in terms of free-speech protections?",

Also I have used the two hand technique for more precise processes, and this takes care of most of it; I'm just talking about  shaking when aspirating something with one hand, or doing anything else that requires 1 hand only. Though when I'm alone it's fairly steady and fine with 1 or 2 hands. I was wondering if this was normal. I'm a 1st year undergrad, so I don't have much experience, if that means anything. \n\nAny tips/advice? ",

So given that I want to go into a more applied physics field, would it be easier just to go into an a job and potentially earn more, or do I continue on my intended path of a PhD?

It seems this is a position that doesn't require a PhD from what I've gathered\n\n-Do you have any kind of certification (like ASCP) and was it hard to get this certification? I will not have any clinical experience after the MS and this seems to preclude me from applying for jobs at hospitals and some other labs\n\n-Has anyone moved from a technologist to a manager of a NGS sequencing core?\n\nI apologize if this isn't the right subreddit for this kind of post.
