        "text": "Gary Trauner is a democrat running for the United States Senate against incumbent John Barrasso in ruby red Wyoming. This is probably the least talked about senate election this cycle, which is understandable; Wyoming is a tiny state with uncontroversial politicians that is typically too partisan to be worth discussion. It doesn't draw the interest of larger, more heavily contested races like Texas and Florida. Also, it will never be a tipping point seat as if democrats take this seat it's very likely they won control of the senate hours before. However, in the senate spirit of all states having equal legislative power, I think it's only right to give even the most seemingly unexciting races their day in court.\n\nTrauner is running on a mantra of \"Washington sucks because of corruption, extreme partisanship and money in politics, and I can help change this\" similarly to Joe Manchin of WV, the only state redder than WY at the moment. In a humorous youtube ad over folksy strumming hat gained a relative traction, [he highlights these points](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7kg0jv4TxA) \n\nCan his persona and hammering down on relatively bipartisan populist issues that are popular with both sides potentially win over some moderate republicans?\n\nDespite never having won a statewide election, Trauner came very close in a race for the House of Representatives seat for Wyoming at large in 2006. [losing in a plurality by getting .5% fewer votes, or roughly 1000 votes, less than his opponent.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives_election_in_Wyoming,_2006) He ran again in 2008, losing by a more convincing 10%, but a lot of that could have to do with Obama's unpopularity in the state boosting republican turnout.\n\n2018 is shaping up to be a similar political landscape to 2006 with an unpopular incumbent president and an even more motivated left wing. With no unpopular nationwide candidate to tie Trauner to, we may see a tighter race. Also, Trauner is well funded by both local and out of state donations. In a tiny state like Wyoming, this matters heavily.\n\nObviously, Trauner is a very much an underdog. John Barrasso is a very popular incumbent, at 61% approval rating from [an admittedly older poll taken in 2017,](https://morningconsult.com/2018/01/23/senator-rankings-jan-2018) and no significant poll or analysts has this race under anything but a safe republican seat. History shows this senate seat consistently performing at roughly 70\n\nEven then, does Trauner have a realistic path to victory?  Can any democrat ever or should democrats consider Wyoming a lost cause? Even if it is, what are the chances of his candidacy potentially helping smaller democratic candidates win state senate seats or take away republican resources from more important races races?",

        "text": "I'm normally extremely cautious about considering the current time I live in as special or different, but I get the nagging feeling that I've seen the last constitutional amendment in the US. The last ratified amendment came in 1992 for what I consider a pretty low key procedural issue (congress' pay rises). I'd say the last major amendment effort on a major social issue came in 1972 which was ultimately iced. And then not since the civil right era of the 60s have we actually seen reform in the US via constitutional amendment. Even in this half of the century, roughly half of those dealt with D.C. Issues and the other half with election rules (as they pertain to civil rights mostly). \n\nSo here's my question - Why has the creation of any (but also highly meaningful) constitutional amendments seemed to have disappeared? Do you predict they will return and how? What does this trend say about SCOTUS' job, most notably, the call of originalist judges to put laws on the books, not via judicial rulings?",

Feige, it would replace most federal taxes with a single tax on every transaction in the economy. With a rate of below 1%, Feige claimed that the tax would be revenue neutral. This would drastically simplify the tax code, make tax evasion very difficult, and cut down on the costs of collect revenue and IRS bureaucracy.  While it hasn’t gotten much publicity, some supporters believe that it could be used to increase tax revenue and provide more social services without significantly impacting the economy. \n\nSo what would the impact be if this tax were implemented in place of most or all federal taxes? And how much revenue could realistically be raised given the necessary microscopic rate?\n\nFeige’s paper on the tax: https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=583078083024092007122124097111099124033019081079037056018099103075098028014085093087062026096028010010047023001097029110111068033073037085088108076023120126127127006060083009123116103116008091085065020089120019069072112003011081092075075096106087067&amp;EXT=pdf\n\nA more brief summary: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Payment_Transaction_tax",

When looking through political news, it is rare to find an article about the future of the US space agency.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo more broadly, what role should the government have in space exploration, and do you believe it to be beneficial in some way? And if so, how?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm also curious to see where the various political parties come out on this issue. Do republicans generally believe one thing about space exploration and democrats generally believe another, or does each party have lots of variation?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I'm excited to see what everyone has to say!",

        "text": "So this thought just occurred to me so I have not entirely fleshed it out, but I think it is fleshed out enough to warrant a bit of discussion.\n\nThe gist is that basically, the accusations against Kavanaugh were leaked due to political pressure from inside the Democratic party. Feinstein knew since July but apparently did not think it was worth bringing up if the accuser did not want to go public. The leak so close to the vote, was most likely intentional to stir up pressure on moderate Republicans and Democrats in conservative states to vote no. Now that the accuser has named herself, it is possible to have hearings similar to the Anita Hill case and may sway enough support to block Kavanaugh's nomination. Full disclosure, I think that the Republicans and a Democrat or two will likely confirm Kavanaugh regardless but in case they don't, I think the Democrats are playing a dangerous game for two major reasons which they might not be forseeing.\n\nFirst of all, if red state democrats vote no it might endanger their chances in the midterms. The Democrats are likely to win the house based on current polling, but I believe they are posed to either retain the same numbers or lose a few seats in the Senate. Manchin appears safe for now, but if he votes no his election could become a toss-up again. Tester is similar, I believe he is leading but a no for supreme court could hurt him in Montana. Otherwise, there are several states where the democrats could lose seats including Missouri, Indiana, and North Dakota.\n\nSecond, as far as Trump's SCOTUS finalists go, Kavanaugh was among the most moderate. Perhaps Hardiman was more centrist, but certainly not Barret, Kethledge, or Thapar. If Kavanaugh withdraws, Trump will get another pick. Unless the democrats control the Senate, the new pick will most likely be to the right of Kavanaugh and, given the nature of Kavanaugh's departure, I have a feeling it will be Barret who will (probably) be immune to a #metoo type scandal. The Collins and Murkowski may not like a far right SCOTUS nomination but the Senate can not just keep rejecting SCOTUS nominations without upsetting the voters so I feel that if Kavanaugh is not confirmed, we will see Justice Barrett soon.\n\nOn the flip side, I can see the Democrats using a Kavanaugh scalp as a way to increase turnout and take the house, but I don't see the math to help them win the Senate, at best only retain the current margin. \n\nAnyone have any thoughts?",

Is there a difference if it is the male or female who is younger and if it is the male or female who is the politician? \n\nI know we have some good examples of successful elections of major age difference couples with the US and French Presidents but I’m curious to hear what others think about this and especially what others might think of the odd ball combination of a younger female politician married to an older male.   Thoughts? ",
