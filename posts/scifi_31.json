It was like I was reading through Dan Simmons' dungeon master notes for a particularly obtuse game of Eclipse Phase. Retcons left and right. Long stretches of people expounding about crap that they had no way of knowing except that they're magic. About the time I got to The Amazing Loli Space Jesus And Her Fawning Disciples Go Forth To Spread The Good News Of Becoming Space Telepathic To The Universe, I wanted to throw my E-reader at the wall.\n\nAlso, the final revelation of the Shrike's identity pissed me off.

It just seemed like Adrian Tchaikovsky had a great idea that just needed to be put down on the page but was rushed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhatever the case may be, I always try to pick out the themes of the books I read and discuss the ones that impact me most.  \n\nThe first of which is a theme touched on early in the series with the beginning of the first book: the importance societies place on culture and how the surrounding environment not only gives birth to but further sculps the culture. \n\nThen, comes a theme that is touched on later in the first book and is the prevalent theme of the second book, what is the proper way to use technology to adapt our environments; particularly in the sense of exploration and colonization? \n\nI love reading books with these kinds of themes do you guys know any more that explore these topics? If you've read The Expert System Series, what did you think about it? What were your favorite themes?",

In fact most people, including the protagonist, believe there is nothing outside the steel walls of the ship, that the ship is all there is and humanity itself was born on it.\n\nThat is until a group of mutant renegades who know the purpose of the ship kidnaps the protagonist and try to convince him of the truth because they need him to pilot the ship to their intended destination. (I'm guessing because the ship's nav computer is keyed in with the pilot's DNA and this kid is a descendent of that pilot and thus is the only one with authorization)\n\nThat's what I remember from the description, do you know it?",

        "text": "Hi,\n\nI love any kind of sci-fi content dealing with situations where the entire existance of the human race, life, civilization, or anything else of similar magnitude are in question. I am not talking about the run-of-the-mill superhero movies where each movie ends with massive outcomes for everyone, but instead content whose whole theme revolves aroung the problems introduced. As examples, I would like to talk about a few:\n\nI have recently watched the 2007 movie Sunshine where the sun is dying, and the fate of humanity depends solely on the success of a singular mission undertaken by a team. Though full of mistakes and loss of direction (imho) at the end; I found the atmosphere of the movie very exhilirating and I definitely crave more of it. I loved to see the struggles of the characters under the weight of the mission, and to feel connected to them. The only thing that I have experienced that can come close to this is the video game Outer Wilds, which was absolutely the video game that I enjoyed the most.\n\nI am also a huge fan of the Halo games involving the Flood. The stakes in question are huge for the events in the games, and the whole premise of Forerunners and the revelation of their solution to the Flood problem has given me a high that I still chase to this day.\n\nFoundation novels from Asimov are also great, they are full of interesting ideas, and I love how these stories develop without ever needing to explain the technology, physics ideas behind it. You see a grandiose story playing out without ever getting lost in it.\n\nI also like concept albums such as Ayreon - The Final Experiment, IOTUNN - Access All Worlds.\n\nIn light of these examples, I am looking for similar content. Does anyone have interesting opinions of these material and can recommend similar things. Thanks a lot.",

        "text": "How the RDA handles Pandora makes no sense.\n\nIn the first movie the RDA are shown to be actively prospecting pandora, not colonizing this will be important later. From what I can gather the RDA is closer to what the British East India Company or the Dutch ROC was than a traditional mining or resource development company today.\n\nIn the first movie they‚Äôre also shown to be actively mining unobtanium, a room temperature superconductor. The ramifications of this are ground breaking, like whoever discovered and refined it instantly wins a Nobel prize huge. It would make commercial fusion power viable, as seen in the movie, and would be a huge step forward into the viability of so called ‚Äúcold fusion‚Äù along with making bullet trains actually viable among countless other applications we can‚Äôt even dream of. To say this rock is in-disposable to humanity and saving it from the situation that‚Äôs presented is an understatement. The real tragedy is not that the RDA are choosing to strip mine Pandora it‚Äôs that for the survival of humanity they can‚Äôt stop. To stop is to condemn billions to slow and painful death by war, disease, and starvation and this one mineral fixes that. The entire expansive narrative seems to be an unstoppable force (the RDA and by extension humanity) meets an immovable object (the Navi and Pandora). The overarching themes of the universe is environmentalism and the damages colonialism but I find myself finding it hard to sympathize with the Navi and to choose them over my own species like Jake and some others did in the first movie. Putting the Navi and their villages to the torch for Unobtanium is a bit extreme but more understandable when the survival of your species is at stake especially when the natives are shooting first and unwilling to cooperate despite your best efforts. \n\nTo that end with such an important material the RDA have a minimal presence in comparison to its value. Sure, in Avatar we see the RDA have a sizable operation but for a rock that enables fusion among a whole host of other applications, the RDA just seem to be taking a relaxed approach to their operations. The ISV‚Äôs take roughly 13 years to complete a round trip, 6 years to and back from back pandora and one year for loading and refueling, and from what we know the RDA operates 12 of such vessels. The question is why only 12? The RDA have been at this for 77 years by the events of avatar and their only lifeline to earth arrives twice a year, if anything goes wrong everyone planet side is SOL. Making more ISV‚Äôs seems like a natural option, even if they‚Äôre only meant for one way trips IE go to Pandora and be disassembled in orbit to make orbital infrastructure and manufacturing to build more ISV‚Äôs Pandora side. These cheaper one way ISV‚Äôs can be launched faster and made cheaper as they‚Äôre not meant to last beyond the six years they‚Äôre in transit to Pandora and can turn the trickle of man and material from earth into a torrent to bring back the Unobtanium to save it. \n\nBeyond that the colonization effort or complete lack thereof is baffling. Sure, the atmosphere contains more CO2 which makes it hard for humans to survive without the eco packs seen in universe but beyond that everything else is earth like. The RDA has already shown to be able to completely regrow spines and nervous systems, as seen by the throw away line about Jake getting his legs back on his return home in the first movie, and we see they have such complete mastery of genetic engineering and human neurology that they can grow alien beings and then pilot them around like a damn video game. To bring over civilians and modify them in route to process the extra CO2 to colonize the planet would be trivial. It would allow for greater civilian oversight of the RDA, and probably prevent the massacre of the original tree village, and it would also make it harder to push the RDA and humanity off planet as you now have at the very least a generation or two of humans who have known nothing but Pandora as their home. On top of that the constant in flux of humans from the Sol system will allow for a decrease in population of earth that is badly needed as shown in the movies. It will also allow for further exploration and exploitation of the Alpha Centauri system with Pandora as a strong home base and allow the Alpha Centauri to be the first step in a link of rest stops on an interstellar highway highway system that could allow humanity to be a truly interstellar species. \n\nFinally the Navi, the RDA aren‚Äôt handling them the best. With how the planet is presented as being a pseudo super organism it makes sense that the RDA and the Navi would eventually reach an impasse but neither side are making an effort it seems. I know there have been attempts but it seems the RDA just showed up and started strip mining without going to the locals and saying ‚Äúhey there‚Äôs a rock here that can literally save our species from extinction and we would like to mine it‚Äù and while it is a gross simplification of diplomatic discourse it‚Äôs better than shooting and looting. This would probably be helped by a civilian government I posed earlier as it would allow diplomats, anthropologists, etc to come over which would facilitate a cross cultural dialogue that would hopefully allow both species to live in peace and maybe even see mixed communities crop up. \n\nThis was a completely unhinged rant about how the RDA doesn‚Äôt make sense and if you made it this far that you so much for reading I really appreciate it! Let me know your thoughts and yes before you ask I do read r/hfy.",

        "text": "Let's get the positives out of the way. The soundtrack, visuals and casting are all great \n\nBut the story is at war with itself \n\nThe \"main\" story is about Superman becoming Superman in a modern ( 2010s) world. However this is done in the most baffling and frankly awful ways. The most infamous being the scene were his dad just decides to die: https://youtu.be/yodVQ5QAc88\n\nBut yet the movie opens with one of the best Sci fi concepts I've ever seen: https://youtu.be/bVJqJvuCa5g\n\nThe \"plot\" of the film is that Krypton didn't just die due to natural causes. But was the result to the stagnation of the Kryptonian race due to them all being genetically created for particular purposes. Seeing that their race was destined to die Jor-El and his partner decided to have a biological child. This child would have his DNA combined with the registry of all Kryptonian genetic bloodlines. Thus at any point in future the race could be brought back and the child being not designed for a particular purpose could make decisions freely \n\nThis is the first big conflict with the Superhero story \n\nJor-El and  Lara don't have or send their son to earth out of love. It's a plot to save the Kryptonian race. Yet the film acts as if they did and sent him to be a \"protector\" or bridge between the Humans? It's never really clarified, because once again in the story Jor-El and Lara were designed to be scientist to solve Kryptonian problems. Kal-El not  Superman is that solution. However this conflict is never brought up in fact they rather push the idea that they wanted him to be earths protector \n\nHowever in the scene when they are discussing this they clearly state they are sending him to earth because \"he will be a God to them\". He will be super powerful this protecting himself and the biological registry inside him \n\nThe second issue is around Zod. Who similar to Jor-El is a genetically engineered person with the task of protecting Krypton. But while Jor-El is made to look for scientific methods, Zod is made for military solutions. Thus the attempted coup at tyr start makes sense as he like Jor-El is simply following his programming \n\nThis is never properly brought up in the movie. Zod isn't a villain, yet he acts like a villain. He is a biological response, a man sized antibody. His plan to remove the genetic bloodlines that have literally consumed the planet to death should be viewed as the body attempting to remove cancerous cells. \n\nSo when he has conflict with Superman it should be in this context. He is programmed to protect Krypton ( which is now Superman) yet Superman wants to protect humans because he feels more human than Kryptonian. \n\nWhich is the third issue. I think them trying  to make Superman \"morden\" was a huge mistake. If they had kept him like old school Superman. Happy and saving people with a great childhood, except his dad dying of a heart attack. It would have been great. Plus if they made the reason he has powers be the registry in his DNA; even better! \n\nTherefore in this version the Kryptonian Zod forces would be basically human. Fighting with their advanced Kryptonian weapons and genetic engineering. Maybe show how Zod has been trained in all ways of war and the only reason he lost on Krypton was because he was trying to save as many lives as possible while also killing the \"bad\" bloodlines. Showing that he has possibly gone insane from the task he was created to do \n\nUltimately I would have wanted the movie to play out the same. With the terraforming plot ( but Kryptonian's don't have powers). The military stopping them with the phantom projector. Yet there is no epic fight with Zod because Superman is you know Superman. Thus in the end Zod kills himself infront of him \n\nThis would be both a  victory for Superman but be a loss for him as he failed to save Zod ( stand in for Kryptonian ideology). Thus the race is effectively dead forever. The Kryptonian genetic bloodlines are destined to self destruction. This is why all the colonies collapsed ( not explained in the movie why) \n\n\nAlmost every mistake in the film leads back to them coming up with this great idea about the Kryptonian collapse. Yet trying to bend Superman (classic)  into that narrative. Rather that just have the two ideas fight each other. I would have loved a scene were we start realising that Jor-El and Lara weren't even capable of love. That they truly are aliens; not even born but made to just keep Kryptonian culture alive. Kal-El the result of that purpose \n\nThe Kent's classical goodness being what made Superman not the powers \n\nHopefully someday someone will make a good film with these ideas",
