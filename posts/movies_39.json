Her favorite show is Dark too so anything involving a time paradox would be great.",

He never finds a loving family like his boss and he fails to enter the elite society.\n\nThe movie also shows how people's values change over time. Jordan Benedict goes from being uncaring to Mexicans to being loving to them, and I think Jett goes the opposite way. And Jordan Benedict goes from hating oil drilling to accepting oil drilling in exchange for more wealth and power.\n\nIn 3.5 hours it's quite a movie, what are your thoughts?",

He goes when ur watching a movie instead of laughing or paying attention to ur phone actually pay attention to the movie and really pay attention to the story what happens with each character and the plot analyze it. Same goes with shows why do most shows end after season 4 or 5 maybe 6 cuz it’s all about the story it usually takes 5 or 6 seasons to finish the story but with movies that’s why there’s part 2 the story don’t get resolved in first part so they have to make part 2 is this true?",

We haven’t had much of that classic Disney villain that’s evil for the sake of being evil.\n\nBut Mr. Crystal is reminiscent of those classic Disney villains, in an illumination film!\n\nHe’s portrayed early on as an antagonist, a jerk who has enough money and power to get away with whatever he wants. He has all the power and influence in his hotel to select any performers he chooses, which is how he meets with our protagonists. He explicitly tells Buster Moon that he’ll throw him off the roof if he “makes him look bad” and I was shocked to see he actually tried to! In the climax of the movie he grabs Buster and throws him off a ledge! He was about to straight up murder someone in an animated film. He has the idea that all his fame, money, and power means that he’s above it all. He states as much when he says “I can do whatever I want” before he throws buster off the ledge.\n\nIt made it all the better when he does get arrested later on, bringing him back down from the pedestal he placed himself on.\n\nOverall I enjoyed Sing 2 but I really had the most fun with the villain.",

        "text": "Other than films that are openly propagandistic (I'm looking at *you*, Triumph of the Will), what movies, in your eyes, serve largely as political or military propaganda despite being presented as entertainment? Just about anyone who's ever read an article on film has probably heard that Top Gun is basically a recruitment video for the Navy. What other films fit the bill?\n\n(Note: As an American who watches mostly American movies, the films I'm going to name will naturally skew towards being American propaganda, but feel free to add films from other regions, as well.)\n\nA few that i can think of off the top of my head:\n\n**Black Hawk Down** \\- An adaptation of  Mark Bowden's non-fiction book recounting the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu, the film largely downplays the legitimate grievances the locals had against the American and allied UN forces, largely presenting the battle as absolute good vs. mindless evil. The film also downplays or eliminates the part played in the battle by allies such as Pakistan and Malaysia.\n\n[Said](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1773466.stm) one Malaysian commander:\n\n&gt;Malaysian movie-goers will be under the  wrong impression that the real battle was fought by the Americans  alone, while we were mere bus drivers to ferry them out.\" \n\nIt should be noted that the film was released mere months after 9/11, when American jingoism was at a zenith. The public may not have had an appetite for a movie that questioned the absolute  righteousness  of an American military venture. According to actor Brendan Sexton, the script did include \"hard questions of the US regarding the violent realities of war and the true purpose of their mission in Somalia\", but these scenes were cut prior to release.\n\nAs for the filmmakers' response to criticisms upon the film's release, producer Jerry Bruckheimer made an appearance on the Fox News program The O'Reilly Factor and blamed the pushback on \"political correctness\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Zero Dark Thirty** \\- Made with the cooperation of the Central Intelligence Agency, the film follows the efforts of a CIA analyst and others to find Osama bin Laden in the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks. Besides the usual complaints about movies based on true events, such as using composite characters to combine two or more real-life characters, the film has been criticized for seemingly justifying enhanced interrogation techniques, a.k.a. torture. The film frames torture as a necessary evil that yields results. However,  in the wake of the War on Terror, the use of torture as an effective interrogation technique has been largely [debunked](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/09/senate-committee-cia-torture-does-not-work), instead yielding a mix of faulty intelligence or things that were already known to the intelligence community thanks to traditional intelligence-gathering means (e.g. signals intelligence, spies, covert agents, etc).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Patriot's Day** \\- A film covering the events surrounding the 2013 Boston Marathon Bombings. Besides the protagonist being a fictional character who Forrest Gump's his way into every major event in the hours and days following the bombings, one scene that smacks of propaganda is the scene where one of the suspect's wives asks for a lawyer during an interrogation. She is denied a lawyer. To her response that she \"has rights\", she is told that she \"ain't got sh\\*t\". I can't help but feel this was meant to be a fist-pumping scene, 'America, f\\*ck yeah!\" moment, when in reality we are seeing an American citizen being denied a fundamental right.",

        "text": "**\\*\\*\\*I don't think I've spoiled any plot points, but some properties of the cinematic universe are revealed\\*\\*\\***\n\nNow I get that questioning preference is inherently problematic, but I really don't get this one. I just rewatched it 6 years later and I struggled to appreciate it just as much now as I did 6 years ago. Is it something that that only diehard fans of the franchise like or am I actually in the minority here?\n\nIn short, my gripes are:\n\n1. The world feels incredibly empty of life, just vast cities with barely anyone living in them. And of the few who do live there, none seem to live or even strive for a bearable life. Everyone's just sitting in their misery, waiting for the protagonist to make his next move.\n2. Tying into the previous point, I find the characters very unconvincing. Everyone has given up on anything that matters and simply exist for the sake of it. The replicants neither behave like humans nor like 'robots' &gt;!(yes, I know they're not exactly robots). The antagonist wants to 'spread to new worlds' but has no credible rationalization for it, and thinks 'reproduction' is the only way, again without rationalization. !&lt;\n3. It's dystopic for the sake of being dystopic. Nothing is said about why the world is what it is and none of it makes much sense. There are no plants or animals despite that there's obviously nothing in the way of that. There is no wealth despite there being unlimited resources, technology and space for living. Everything is just concrete and no one seems to care.\n4. The story? I don't know, what story? The movie is nearly 3h long and yet I don't feel like much happened.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nCinematography is clearly one of the key points in the praise the movie has gotten, I just don't see how that alone can ever carry a movie personally. I'm I alone in thinking the movie just kind of dull and forgettable? \n\n*PS. Since I know the question will come, no, I haven't really watched the prequel, I gave it a try but got bored of it quite quickly. I figured a sequel 40 years later should hold up as a standalone movie anyway but maybe I'm wrong.*",

People seem to have mixed feelings about Hemsworth’s character. I will say that he sure does talk his head off in the movie and it gets a bit tiring, but he is a cult leader, and I thought Hemsworth gave a scary performance. In my opinion, it’s better than Pulp Fiction. I’m probably biased, because I don’t like Pulp Fiction that much anyway, but one thing this film you could say “ripped off” from pulp is that this film also has a secret, unrevealed valuable item. However, I think a photo of a historical figure with a prostitute is more interesting than some shiny thing in a suitcase.",

        "text": "\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI just watched The Hills Have Eyes (2006), a remake of Wes Craven’s 1977 film of the same name, directed by Alexandre Aja and co-written by Aja and Grégory Levasseur. It stars Aaron Stanford, Kathleen Quinlan, Vinessa Shaw, Emilie de Ravin, Dan Byrd, Robert Joy, and Ted Levine.\n\nThe film follows a family that is targeted by a group of cannibalistic mutants who were deformed by nuclear tests conducted by the US government from 1945 to 1962. The family is traveling through the New Mexico desert to California when their trailer breaks down near a former nuclear testing site.\n\nI have to say that this film was one of the most intense and brutal horror films I have ever seen. It was not for the faint of heart or the squeamish. The violence was graphic and realistic, and the mutants were terrifying and grotesque. The film did not shy away from showing the horrors of what humans can do to each other when pushed to their limits.\n\nThe film also had some interesting themes about survival, family, morality, and revenge. The family had to overcome their differences and work together to fight against their enemies. They also had to face some moral dilemmas about how far they would go to protect themselves and each other. The film showed how both sides of the conflict were victims of circumstance and how violence can breed more violence.\n\nThe film was well-acted by the cast, especially Aaron Stanford as Doug Bukowski, the son-in-law who goes through a major transformation from a timid pacifist to a fierce warrior. He had some of the most memorable scenes in the film, such as his confrontation with Big Brain (Desmond Askew), one of the mutant leaders, and his rescue mission for his baby daughter Catherine (Maisie Camilleri Preziosi).\n\nThe film also had some impressive cinematography by Maxime Alexandre, who captured the stark contrast between the beautiful desert landscape and the dark underground tunnels where the mutants lived. The film also had some effective sound design by Tom Myers, who created a tense atmosphere with eerie noises and screams.\n\nOverall, I think this film was a well-made horror remake that paid homage to Wes Craven’s original while adding its own twists and shocks. It was not an easy watch, but it was a thrilling ride that kept me on edge throughout.\n\nWhat did you think of this film? Did you like it or hate it? Did you find it scary or disturbing? Did you prefer it over Wes Craven’s original?",

        "text": "You would think that a film that opens with the main character beating his dog to death would be an instant turn off. But somehow this movie works and think it is brilliant. You may know Peter Mullan from Ozark (Jacob Snell) you may be surprised to know that he is actually a Scottish actor and I think he is amazing. The film also stars Olivia Colman (The Favorite, The Father) if you are a fan of hers definitely check this out because she also brings a heart breaking power house of a performance. THIS FILM IS NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART but I have seen it twice now and was very invested in the story on both viewings. I would say that this is more for UK audiences but hey films are for everyone of course. Lemme know your thoughts!",
