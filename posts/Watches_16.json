I want to hear peoples opinions since dropping 5-8k on a watch from a manufacturer that you are not familiar with feels kinda strange. \n\n Rolex isnt for my budget right now, breitling seems like a really good valued piece and i like some of them, seriously considering to get one, so drop me all the pros and cons that you know of, i dont buy watches to flex or to show it off, actually sold my rollie after guy tried to rob me (and failed), i value quality and reliability and seems like breitling is just that, but i dont see people talking about them that much.",

Firstly, I would like to know if someone can tell me about this model as I cannot find any information about it online. I believe it was purchased in the late 90s, but I'm not sure. \n\nSecond; where should I go to get this watch serviced? I've never done a service before and understand there may be some nuance with it being a few decades old now. The watch loses around 60-90 seconds a day. \n\nAny information and advice is appreciated, thanks!",

        "text": "Hello experts! I inherited this watch years ago from my great uncle. It seems it was a company gift when he worked for Canadian National Railway (CNR), in 1955. It's Tissot Automatic, but other than a 10K gold filled stamp, and an L&amp;K, there are no markings. Any ideas what model this might be?\n\nIt's currently non-functional, and I'm trying to decide whether or not I want to spend the money to get it repaired. If I'm going to spend more on repairing it than it's worth, I'll probably just keep it as is to remember my great uncle. But if it's worth more than a repair, I would love to repair it and wear it. Any thoughts on ballpark value (after repair)? $100? $500? $1000?\n\nThanks for your time!",
