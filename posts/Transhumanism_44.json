        "text": "I honestly feel that one of the most important things we can do at this point in time is to actively work on extending our lifespans. We do not need to make huge advances all at once, but many smaller advances that incrementally extend the runway before we reach the end. An extension of just a few years buys time for additional methods of life extension to come to fruition. If we become good enough at this, lifespans may indefinitely expand out in front of us.\n\nOne of the keys to creating viable life extension technologies is a factor of increased research on extending lifespans and more specifically funding for that research. To get funding for the research, it is key to raise public awareness to the idea that death and aging are a disease which infects all of us. As of now, most people just accept that death is inevitable, especially around the age of 70-80, but it has not always been this way. Just 100 years ago, the life expectancy of most people around the world was under 40. Japan, for example, has more than doubled life expectancy from under 40 in 1900 to 82.7 years in 2012.\n\nWe may be in a similar position now, that by 2100 life expectancy can double again to 150. It may sound crazy, but it is possible. The issue is that if we (those alive now) miss the advent of a significant life extension technology by even a day, we are out of this world forever. It may not seem obvious, but due to the exponential advances in technology, every additional day an individual is alive, there is an outsized chance to live even longer. An advance of \"just\" 5, 10 or 15 years, gives us a significantly higher chance of being alive when additional life extension technologies are invented, which significantly increases the chance of living indefinitely (but worse case having a much longer life).\n\nSo what can you do then to increase your chances of a significantly longer and healthier life? Well, the most important thing we can do now is work to speed up the speed of advances in life extension technologies. The most impactful way to do that as a layperson is to raise awareness and demand for life extension technologies or to directly support those who do. One way you can do this today is to support [Zoltan Istvan's Immortality Bus on Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/immortality-bus-with-presidential-candidate-zoltan#/story). He plans to drive the bus across the country to kickstart a debate on mortality, and I support the idea personally and may also join in at some points on the tour! There is under a week left on the campaign, so please support it!\n ",

        "text": "I've long been an adherent of aspects of trans-humanism. I was invested in this way of thinking since I was young being exposed to works like Ghost in the Shell. It hasn't been until /relatively/ recent, though, that I've been more of an advocate than just an idle observer. One of the thoughts that pioneered that for me is the fact that I realized that other people actually do think almost as exactly as I do. This being as it is I started looking into whatever subject material that I could to educate myself on aspects of trans-humanism that I was not aware of.\n\nHonestly I'm surprised I haven't learned of Kurzweil sooner because seems almost a superstar and if not that at least a fellow advocate. However, I try to exercise some skepticism of his predictions. There is nothing more than I would like than to full-heartedly believe the theories he has, they're quite romantic and align with my own beliefs, but I'd like to know what you guys know about discrepancies in his predictions or in general your thoughts on them. Of course I'm going to be doing my research, but I'd be hard-pressed to think someone hasn't already. Maybe I can even start a dialogue.",

        "text": "I am Andrés Gómez Emilsson, the former president of the Stanford Transhumanist Associations. I just graduated from Stanford with a masters in computational psychology. I would like to request your attention for a moment:\n\nThere is a wide number of transhumanist strains/clusters, and we don't really understand why. How do we explain the fact that immortality is the number one concern for some, while it is a very minor concern for others who are more preoccupied with AI apocalypse or making everyone animated by gradients of bliss?\n\nA possible interpretation is that our values and objectives are in fact intimately connected to our background assumptions about fundamental matters such as consciousness and personal identity. To test this theory, I developed a questionnaire for transhumanists that will examine the relationship between transhumanist goals and their background philosophical assumptions. If you wish to contribute, please find this questionnaire here (it takes ~15 minutes): \n\nhttps://stanforduniversity.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8v9vIIyIOCBV8c5\n\nThe link will be alive until July 30 2015. Please complete it as soon as possible. Once the results are out you will be happy you participated. \n\nThe very sense we give to words requires an underlying network of background assumptions to support them. Thus, when we don't share implicit background assumptions, we often interpret what others say in very different ways than what they had in mind. With enough transhumanists answering this questionaire (about 150) we will be able to develop a better ontology. What would this look like? I don't know yet, but I can give you an example of the sort of results this work can deliver: qualiacomputing.com/2015/06/09/state-space-of-drug-effects-results/\n",

However, it will be expensive. \nVery expensive. \n\nI'm not intent on dying. It's just not my style. The future is looking more and more amazing and I don't want to miss a thing. Not to mention that pesky \"blink out of existence\" thing that no matter your beliefs is pretty damned terrifying. \n\nI intend to live as long as I can. Then I intend on living forever. \n\nIt's going to cost money. Lots of money. There will be a gap between the rich and poor that's wider than we've ever seen. I see more of an \"Elysium\" than a \"Star Trek\" in our future, and as much of a social scientist that I claim I am, I'm fully intent on being on the receiving end of all this tech. \n\nSo what all are we as a group doing to better position ourselves for this future? I know we want to think this will be available to everyone, but it won't. That's capitalism. Amazing innovations, but they only go to the top earners. That's just the way it goes. \n\nI've given up ever having children so I can experience the future, and I push so hard to become part of that top % that will experience the next step in evolution.\n\nSo I ask. What is it that you all are doing to experience the future? And a follow up, what can we do, as transhumanists, to make sure this future can be experienced by all those who choose to do so?",
