        "text": "I'm a beginner (I know Hiragana and Katakana, and I'm about 1/5 of the way through learning Kanji meanings with RTK). Recently I've been really curious about the limits of the character っ. Can it be used to double the consonant sounds of the h-group (は, ひ, ふ, へ, ほ)? Do words with something like っは exist? Would that even be pronounceable? If so, how would you pronounce it? ふ seems doable, but I figured I'd include it in the question since, as far as I know, it's still technically considered to have an \"h\" sound to it even though it's represented as \"fu\" in romaji.\n\nAs I thought of this, it also made me wonder about other sounds, like the y-group (や, ゆ, よ) and わ. They seem a little more pronounceable than the h-group, but they stick out to me since the \"consonant\" sound involved in them is more of a vowel blend (y is \"i\" blended to the next vowel and w is \"u\" blended to the next vowel). Do words with structures like っや or っわ exist?\n\nAnother weird one is the r-group. Trying to pronounce a double r is difficult, as extending the consonant seems to change which consonant it is altogether (unless I'm doing it wrong). I don't think I've seen anything like っら before either, so is that ever a thing? If it is, how should it be pronounced?\n\nI also can't recall ever seeing a doubled m or n consonant using っ, though this may just be my lack of experience showing. Do these structures exist? I do know the n consonant sound can be doubled by placing ん before it, though. Is something like っな considered identical to んな by native speakers, or are they subtly different in pronunciation?\n\nMore generally, I'm wondering if, if some of these structures don't exist in real words, are they theoretically possible? If you gave a Japanese person a made-up word in Hiragana that included a っ structure that doesn't naturally occur in the language, would they be able to pronounce it?\n\nThose are all the questions I have at the moment. Any interesting information on the topic of atypical uses of っ that I haven't asked about is also appreciated.",

I've currently memorized the kana and am almost finished with Memrise's Japanese 1 module. However, after finding this subreddit, it made me realize that Memrise wasn't going to teach me Japanese very well, so I've decided to go about studying a bit differently.\n\nMy current plan is:\n\n* Work through Genki I/II\n* [Use Nihongo No Shark's method of memorizing the Kanji](https://nihongoshark.com/learn-kanji/)\n* Read through Tae Kim's guide\n\nFrom my understanding this should get me to about N4 level. However, I'm looking on your opinions on whether this is the best approach I could take. I'm pretty new to Anki so if you have any tips I'd appreciate those as well. \n\nI also have a pretty lengthy train commute (about an hour back and forth) so if there is something I can do to study on my phone other than Memrise that would be greatly appreciated. \n\nAs an additional question, I'm wondering whether I should take the test as early as December, and if so at what level? I'm willing to dedicate around 10-15 hours a week or more studying for reference, since I have quite a bit of free time. I want to take the test as it allows me to benchmark myself and keep myself accountable- it gives me a hard, real goal.\n\nAgain, if there's any tips, or any advice you could give me, I'd appreciate it.\n\nみんな、ありがとう",

That's my main problem.\n\nDo you have any tips for memorising or learning Japanese in general? For a beginner :)\n\nAnd another question, is there a discord server for Japanese learners? It's easier and faster asking there, or at least something similar to discord, I'd appreciate it. Thanks.\n\nSorry for my (kind of)bad English, I tried my best.",

As with the original post this update is obviously a bit meta.\n\nSo it's now September, I'm enrolled in [Asia studies (Japenese) at  Copenhagen University](https://studier.ku.dk/bachelor/japanstudier/)^^Danish ^^only ^^link along 30 or so other (mostly young) hopefuls.\n\nLast week was a pre-introduction week with some general \"welcome to university\" events as well as social \"get to know your classmates\" events. It ended off with a couple of parties (and I learned that I no longer have the capacity to party at college level).\n\nToday was the first real day. Four 45 minute lessons in Japanese; very basic stuff obviously and nothing I hadn't already picked up from my self-studies. (Even though I more or less shelved my self-studying after deciding to apply for university, I still remember most of it.)\n\nBut just speaking and listening is obviously already a big difference. In total it's 14 x 45 minute language lessons per week, plus a roughly equivalent time spent in preparation, group study, self study, etc., outside the classroom.\n\nThe education is planned to run for 4 years; a normal bachelor degree is 3 years, but the additional language classes pile on another year. The first year is 75% language and 25% history. The second year starts off with a semester as an exchange student at a Japanese university, so we'll also be spending some time the first year figuring out how to apply for that, research grants, find accomodation, and so on. \n\nAfter that the language classes should be mostly over and the rest of the education focuses on history, culture, and so on, with some forays into translation practices and some slots open for studying outside the main field of interest. It all culminates with a bachelors project at the end of the fourth year.\n\nAccording to our senpai students we should be able to converse fairly normally by the end of the exchange semester, ie. after a total of 1½ year of language studies.\n\nI'm psyched!\n\nI'll post another update later on (maybe at the end of the semester) if there's still interest.",

Some people will watch Japanese shows often or have them on in the background, but some people neither have time for the former nor would enjoy doing the latter. This leaves music with Japanese vocals being a superior choice for subconsciously surrounding yourself with the language.\n\nSo, if you listen to music with Japanese vocals, which artists are your personal favourites? \n\nI only have a small list myself, it's mostly rock and metal. I would recommend [Myth &amp; Roid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4SVjs3CFPc), [Kalafina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwquipMpsiQ), [Ling Tosite Sigure ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQddMl2FMG0) and [Babymetal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRb4YEer0_A).

I need advice on what level to go for. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI studied Japanese at university for 3 years and lived in Japan for a year (period from 2009-2013). I covered both Genki I and II officially but the thing was I was always really bad at Japanese and rote learning. Also I was lazy. I worked throughout this period at university and had some stuff happening in my life when I lived in Japan which prevented me from really learning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I am treating this like I'm a full beginner. I plan to demolish both Genki books but I think that I'll be able to get through them quickly because of previous studies. I work full time now and am very busy (like all of us) so it's not excuse to study hard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy method will include: \n\n\\- Twice daily SRS (Anki) for vocab\n\n\\- Working through the Genki text books for grammar, reading, etc. \n\n\\- Was thinking of subscribing to WaniKani\n\n\\- Watching a heap of Japanese movies and TV\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuestions: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) Should I push myself hard to go for N3 or should I aim for N4 and N3 in 6 months time? \n\n2) Is my method solid? Should I add anything else? \n\n3) Do you need to write the kanji in the JLPT or just read it? I'm asking because I've been reading the tofugu blog and I tend to agree that writing kanji is not as important as reading it for what I want to learn for. \n\n4) Any other tips or advice? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks so much!",

I then re-evaluated if it was a good idea to continue learning German, since the potential for me actually dropping things in the USA and moving there was decreasing.\n* At this point, I was already having fun learning a language, so I decided to begin learning Japanese. This is due to the fact that even if I don't ever move to Japan, I still consume Japanese media (anime/manga), so it be more useful to me in the US than German will be, in theory.\n\nMy issue is that I am having trouble sticking with Japanese because sometimes I miss Europe and will want to flip-flop back to learning German. I also think about how much easier it would be to learn German than Japanese (since I wouldn't have to learn an entire new writing system).

I’m on HelloTalk, but I also feel like I’ll just waste people’s time struggling to form a sentence. But I don’t want my speaking ability to lag behind. \n\nDo you have any advice for getting over shyness to improve speaking ability?

        "text": "So I've made some attempts at learning Japanese in the past, but I never had the patience to even remember the Hiragana so I stopped, all I had was the reading of a few of them. A few years later I downloaded Duolingo and started doing those chapters with the Hiragana while also using Tofugu's mnemonics to remember them and I managed to remember them in 2 days, then I moved on with Katakana but since Duolingo's tutorial didn't have chapters where they teach you just Katakana I just memorised the ones they taught me so far. \n\n\nNow I want to begin with the Kanji using the mnemonic + radicals guide described by Tofugu and learning only the Kanji that I meet along the way on Duolingo's tutorial for now but I already have questions:  \n\n\\- Do all radicals have meanings? Or just those that also happen to be standalone Kanji? Like 日. I read KanjiDamage's page about radicals and I think he said that only the standalone Kanji that cannot be separated into radicals have a meaning. But another page said that all radicals have meaning. \n\n\\- On some website I read that 日 is a standalone radical, while on KanjiDamage's page he described it as being formed of two 口 on top of each other, how do I know which is true?\n\n\\- If all radicals have meanings then should I ditch the made up meanings made by WaniKani so I don't learn wrong things? Does anyone think about those radicals when they write/read kanji? Most of them are not used on their own so their meanings are lost anyway, right?\n\n\\- Is there a better way of learning the Kanji? How do Japanese students learn them? What do you recommend? (I do not wanna pay for WaniKani or otherservices)  \n\n\\- Should I learn just one Onyomi and Kunyomi reading for all of the Kanji? If a Kanji's Kunyomi/Onyomi reading is way more used than the other reading should I just learn the popular one? I had problems with figuring that out for 日, it seems it has a lot of readings like Niki, Hi, Bi, Shini and in  今日  I am not even sure what it is read as since there's no Furigana above it  on [Jisho.org](https://Jisho.org), the Furigana spell Kyou above the left Kanji.",

I can't tell if it's talking about muted colours in a positive or negative way. I also cannot figure out the meaning of 手を出す and ゴーイングマイウェイ. I understand that it says \"going my way\" but I don't know what it actually means. I'm also not sure if I've properly understood the meaning of こびる either. I think in this context it's supposed to mean to flatter/to suit. ",

        "text": "I've been studying for a few months now with the usual resources learning the usual beginner stuff, and it's of course not \"easy.\" Grammar in particular is the major hurdle for me as opposed to Kanji, which feels more like a very time consuming and draining chore to be completed as opposed to an intellectually daunting task. Learning all the different conjugations, forms, exceptions and subtleties coming from English is quite difficult, as they are clearly so linguistically distinct. Even as someone who as always done well in English and other foreign language subjects, I feel like its been rather difficult just internalizing the material in Genki, particularly listening skills on the CD. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my chief concern is is it harder at the beginning, where you must break into and become comfortable with how completely different Japanese is, and perhaps once you make it over the initial hurdle of different grammar, structure, conjugation patterns etc. gradually learning more complex material will be \"easier,\" when one has a higher comfort level for the linguistic structure and flow of the language. Or it could be that as the material becomes more advanced, the things that are so difficult in the first place become more advanced, and the difficulty with each increasing level of advanced material simply stacks upon one another. What do you guys think? I have no answer as I probably wouldn't even pass N5 right now. ",

I finished both Duolingo &amp; Lingodeer last month so was under impression that I should be able to judge pretty well. I was not just rushing through app courses, I was working on it for 6 months daily.\nJP Book store in London has a good variety of textbooks as I understand now. I could pretty soon find most titles mentioned  here.\nOpening books put me in a terrible shock as I realised that I cannot remember the meaning of even familiar kanji. \nWho am I kidding, I thought. I will never be able to understand the most complex of languages. Not now - in my 40s. \nStill in shock I paid for Genki l cards workbook and left - only to realise at home that CD does not have any sound files. Wasted £27.\nAfter a week of thinking about switching to learning something more useful instead, eg. organic chemistry or carpentry, I am back to daily revisions. Working on Kanji\n&amp; listening understanding. Hopefully it will get easier.  \n\nEDIT:\nI bough “GENKI picture cards on CD” instead of textbook. I did not realise that CD may contain pdf without audio files. My fault. Should have ask the seller. \nAlso the level is not right. I need level 2. Blame it on nerves.",
