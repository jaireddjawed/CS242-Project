        "text": "I mentioned this in a comment on here, thought I'd add it as an actual post.\n\nMy department is next door to a live call center. I am friends with a lot the agents as they are hard-working and just need to catch a break. One of them is a woman who i highly respect (and totally snagged to come over to my department finally). One day about a year or so ago she was having a shit day when a guy SET. HER. OFF. I have access to their call notes system, so i ask for the phone number &amp; pull the file. This guy called 3 times in two days, each time getting a female &amp; each time demanding a male agent because \"women cannot be technicians\". My friend was the third one to deal with him, and even went into a spiel about how she could not transfer the guy to someone else because of her sex &amp; made it clear that all of the level two techs are trained similarly (hell, she was one of the smartest of all of them). The guy retorted that he wanted to speak with a supervisor so she could be fired &amp; demanded her agent # \"since you need to go back to being a secretary &amp; stop pretending to do a man's job.\" Obviously, she was livid. I closed out his notes and went about my day.\n\nFast forward a week. I'm setting up orders for customers requesting service, and came accross a familiar phone number. I pull back up the call center info, it's him. I sent an email off to my manager, letting her know that this customer was shitty towards women &amp; gave her a snip of the call center notes. I got a reply asking me to call the local hardware store this request came from &amp; let them know in detail why this customer will not be serviced by us in any capacity. The store was surprised but very understanding, and we never heard from him again.\n\nTLDR: guy unleashes sexism 101 on call center techs, I have him barred from any service from our company.\n\nEdit: spelling, ty u/Melechdaviid for catching",

        "text": "Most of our calls are starting to settle down after Irma. However, two days ago, the third party who provides On Demand had a server crash, and therefore, our customers lost it. \n\n...And they lost it...\n\nI mean, it was non-stop back to back calls for 18 hours straight. People were holding for an hour with the automated message saying, \"we're having issues with On Demand. If you're having an error code, we're diligently working on it. We do not have an estimated time of resolution.\" Then it would say \"most of the time, rebooting your cable box, blah blah blah\", and back to \"on demand is a known issue, still no ETA.\" \n\nSo you think people would listen and be like, \"oh there's an issue\", but no. They don't. \n\nAnd after they would get to me, they'd demand a credit. On demand is a free service, unless you order a movie. Then it's a ppv movie rental. But 9.99/10, you're trying to watch a free show. \n\nIt's frustrating. I get it. But no, I can't credit you for a free service like the guide. No. No ETA. No. I'm not useless. Your normal HBO channels are working, on demand is free and separate from that. Yes, the automated system was right. Okay, thanks for calling. \n\n\nI reach the end of my eight hour shift. I'm done. I'm over the yelling. The arguing over credits. The name calling. I'm done. Last call of the night: \n\nMe: -asks for name and address on account-\n\nCst: why. Why do I have to keep doing this?! Fucking shit, lady. I'm so over this. \n\nMe: okay, I'm sorry. I'm really happy to help, but nothing pulled over, and I need it to see your account so I can help. \n\nShe finally gives it to me. One small victory. Yay. \n\n\"How can I help, Ms. Cst?\" \n\n-screeches- there's so much yelling and cussing. I can't understand. I make out one word: playback. \n\nMe: \"I'm happy to help. I'm so sorry. I'm a little confused. When you mean playback, are you trying to watch a recording or on demand?\"\n\nCst: \"WELL YOU'RE SO HELPFUL. NEITHER. NEITHER. Why are you so useless?!?!?!\" \n\nMe: \"....okay. let's try this. What channel are you on?\" \n\ncst: \"1. I'm on channel 1.\"\n\nMe: \"thank you. That's our on demand channel, and -\"\n\nCst: -cuts me off- \"That's what I said. On demand. I'm having issues with on demand. I held for 1 hour for you to finally figure out I'm having issues with on demand.\"\n\n(And 15 automated messages about on demand errors. Lol.)\n\nAnd I'll just sum up the rest of the call. It didn't go very well. After I told her about the outage...There was lots of yelling. Lots of screaming. Lots of name calling. Lots of belittling. I didn't say a word over the next 10 minutes. \n\nShe goes on about how sorry she is for me while the CEO makes millions off of me taking the heat for stupid shit.\n (My only thought here was that if she was so sorry, why wouldn't she shut the fuck up already. Her voice was just like nails on chalkboard.) \n\nShe was a supervisor at a call center. She would fire me if I worked for her.(Doubt it, screech lady. Most call center employees are nice to other call center employees.) \n\nAnd finally she concludes with \"I should cancel. I hate you all anyways. Yeah, I want to cancel my fucking services. How about that?\"\n\nAnd I finally got to speak. \n\"Sure, let me get you to the people that can help you with that.\"\n\nAnd she was silent. Finally. For like 30 whole seconds. And she finally muttered, \"do it.\"\n\nAnd then hung up before I could transfer. \n\nI went home after that call. And I ordered an on demand movie just because. And it worked. Surprisingly. \n\nAnd I didn't even watch it. I just ordered it in spite. Best $2.70 of my life. :) \n\nEdit: \"for\" to fire****",

Generally either 200 or 250, depending on the retail value of the phone. Most customers are never happy to find out about it, but it's printed on the damned receipt at the time of purchase. So I don't have any pity.\n\n&gt;Me: Are you aware of the deductible on this plan?\n\n&gt;SC: ...No?\n\n&gt;Me: Well, with every insurance plan, we require a deductible for every claim made, and it looks like for your phone, the deductible will be 200 dollars.\n\n&gt;SC: What? That's not right, I've filed three other claims when my phone was broken without paying anything, why do I have to pay now?\n\nI don't even know how that would be possible, so I checked his account and found out there wasn't anything in the notes about him filing any claims. I didn't question it, but I went along with it.\n\n&gt;Me: Sir, unfortunately, for us to file a claim today, we do have to collect a deductible. It is listed on your receipt, as well as your T's&amp;C's.\n\n&gt;SC: Just get me to a Supervisor then, they can bypass it for me.\n\n&gt;Me: I'll get you to a supervisor, but I *assure* you, they won't be able to help.\n\n&gt;SC: Yeah they will.\n\n*clicked over*\n\nHe hung up before a supervisor answered.\n\nWhat's funny was, he called us back twice. Once more to our department with the same complaint, and another to our Accidental Damage and Handling department, where they actually flagged his account for fraudulent activity. I stalked his account for a month to constantly check the status and found out he eventually filed the claim, and paid the deductible. Whatever he was doing, he finally stopped being stubborn.\n",

In this story it was the wife of an employee who called with questions about her husband's paycheck. She will be known as HW (housewife).\n\nMe: Thank you for calling *** today. This is cspot. How may I help you?\n\nHW: I just got my husband's paycheck and it looks short. I need you to look into this.\n\nI did the usual verification and pulled up the husband's account and pay stubs. The first thing that I noticed was the size of the check. It was almost $35k. At that company we got paid twice a month, so the dude was making over $800k a year. \n\nMe: Ma'am, the check appears to be for the correct amount. What issue are you seeing with it?\n\nHW: The amount us all wrong. It's less than the check we received earlier this month.\n\nI looked at both pay stubs and I did see a difference.\n\nMe: Ma'am, I see a difference of 5 cents. Is that what you're referring to?\n\nHW: Yes, of course it is. Why is the check I received today short?\n\nMe: The 5 cent difference in the check is due to the way the company distributes funds. Instead of 24 even checks every other check will be for 5 cents more. I'm not exactly sure why it's done that way, but every employee's check will either end with a 0 or a 5.\n\nHW: That doesn't make any sense. I want my 5 cents.\n\nMe: I've gone through the last two years of your husband's pay stubs and they are all correct. I can see that the value of every other paycheck changes by 5 cents.\n\nHW: You're wrong.\n\nMe: I assure you ma'am that I am not. I've also added all 24 checks up and they equal your husband's annual salary.\n\nHW: That can't possibly be true. I want my 5 cents.\n\nMe: If you have the pay stubs you can verify what I'm telling you.\n\nHW: Who keeps those things? What possible reason would I habe for keeping them.\n\nMe: A situation like this is a possible reason.\n\nHW: Just give me my 5 cents.\n\nMe: Ma'am, your husband is not owed 5 cents. I'd be happy to mail copies of his pay stubs to you, so that you can see exactly what I'm looking at.\n\nHW: No! All I want is my goddamn 5 cents!\n\nAt this point I realized that I had been on the phone with HW for over 10 minutes and my patience was running low. I had already given my two weeks notice, but I didn't see that as an excuse to be rude to people. However, it wasn't lost on me how much time I've wasted over 5 cents. I took a deep breath and continued trying to explain why her husband's paycheck was correct. After several more minutes she had become increasingly belligerent and my patience was gone.\n\nHW: Send me the fucking 5 cents or I'll have your job!\n\nMe: Ma'am, you're welcome to my job, but in the meantime if I promise to send you a nickle out of my own pocket will you hang up the phone right now? \n\nWithout another word she hung up the phone. I never sent her the pay stubs or the 5 cents. I also never heard about any complaints from boss. Even though I have very little pity for the people making over  $800k a year I would have fixed the problem had there been one.",

There’s two things I can do here. I can give you an appointment with this clinic in December and add you to the wait list for any cancellations or I can forward your referral to the [city an hour away] clinic. \n\nDL: Are you telling me you don’t have ANY appointments in [my city]?

        "text": "As per u/Sigilus request, I have a story about the first time I ever put on a headset. Ever.\n\nTL;DR: Threaten to sue, performance ensues. Newbie watches.\n\nCast your mind back to the dim, dark age of 2005 (Shut up. It's a long time for me.) I was working retail \"hardware\" at a large Candian chain store (I'm still finding the \"money\" around the house), when I saw an advertisment in the local paper, for inbound call centre agents, at $3 over minimum wage. Grade 12 and police check required, but that's it. I had just been refused a promotion to department manager (probably correctly, but it was still a factor), so I thought \"What the hey?\", and dropped off my resume. The *next day* I got a call from the HR recruiter's intern, for an interview and test. No alarm bells, they were in a hiring frenzy due to expansion. Hence the intern making the call. (Legitimate intern - 1 or 2 week \"work experience\" as part of a business or HR diploma from the local college). For anybody tracking my career via Reddit, this was an outsource contractor for US cell carrier $Pink, in their \"credit-challenged\" queue.\n\nSo I go in, and (as far as I can tell) I waltz through the computer test (simulated call, multiple choice test). Then the regular interview (with the intern. O_o ) Then on to the most interesting portion; the call floor. I sit down next to, with hindsight, a veteran call centre agent. I could tell by the nicotine stains on his right index finger and thumb. By the dead eyes that stared at the screen. The monsyllabic grunt and hand wave that passed for \"yes\" when the HR intern asked \"Can I place this applicant with you?\" The multiple, empty, energy drink cans.\n\nI settle into the chair, and gingerly place the headset on my ears, for the very first time. \n\n**Beep!**\n\n&gt; $John (in a peppy voice, completely at odds with his expression): Thank you for calling $Pink, my name is $John. How can I help you today.\n\n&gt; Angry Lady: Y'all have cut ma phone off! Cut it back on! Naow!\n\n(Sorry for the spelling, but that is as close as I can force myself to writing out her words phonetically. I won't torture you any more.)\n\n&gt; $John (still peppy): I'm sorry to hear that. Let me see what I can do to help. :) \n\nAccount verification ensues. The weirdness of the peppy voice coming from this dead-eyed automaton was starting to creep me out. Put alongside the obvious anger of the customer, I didn't know what to think.\n\n&gt; $John (*still peppy*): So I can see you have exceeded your minutes, and reached your account balance. At this point, a payment of $XX is required to turn your service back on.\n\n&gt; $AL: WHAT?? ~~Ah've payed ma be-ill~~ I've paid my bill! You need to cut my phone back on! I could have a family emergency!\n\n&gt; $John (**still peppy**): Is there a family emergency?\n\n&gt; $AL: I don't know! I CAN'T USE my PHONE!\n\n&gt; $John (yep...still peppy): Well then, we just need a payment of $XX to restore your service.\n\n&gt; $AL: ~~Yew know whut?~~ You know what? I'm going to get my cousin, who's a lawyer, to sue you!\n\n&lt;Snap&gt;\n\nI practically heard $John's entire personality change, without him saying a word. His posture straightened, his eyes became bright and alert, and a genuine smile spread across his face. As his right hand elegantly extended towards the release button on the phone, like the CanadaArm controlled by a retired Prima Ballerina with OCD, his next words were uttered with such passion and conviction, that Sir Lawrence Olivier would retire in shame, Robert de Niro would become a pasta chef, and Tom Cruise would join the Church of Scientology.\n\n&gt; $John (utterly serious, even reverent): Ma'am. As you have decided to pursue legal action regarding this matter, I have no option but to terminate this call, and direct your representation to our legal department at 123 Fake St, Springfield, State, Zip code. All future discussion of this matter will be via written correspondence only, and I have noted your account as such. Thank you for being a valued customer of $Pink, and I hope you have a blessed day.\n\nSuch was his control, that as the last word \"day\" escaped his lips, his finger made contact with the release button, and gently, yet firmly, pushed it.\n\n&lt;Click&gt;\n\n$John slumped back in his chair, practically the pictorial definition of post-orgasmic bliss. He turned to me, and noted my wide-eyed expression.\n\n\"That, my friend, is how it is done.\" \n\nHe turned back to the computer, and added his notes to the caller's account.\n\n\"Cx disputing pymnt to restore. Legal action threatened. Legal Dept info provided and call released as per article AA-23\"\n\nSave. Exit.\n\nDeep sigh. Auto-in.\n\nI still took the job.",

        "text": "Hi! LTL, FTP, you know the drill. \n\nI work as a fraud advisor for a payment processor, and we do both inbound and outbound support (aka call requests). This guy opens a ticket via email: \n\n\"I lost a dispute!!! Did you not get my evidence? Call me now!\"\n\nI pull up this guy's account and it looks pretty bad. He's had a payment of over £6000 disputed as fraudulent and lost the dispute. I look at the payment and see that it had been flagged by our system as likely fraudulent straight away, which the guy had obviously ignored. I take at look at the evidence he submitted and nearly fall off my chair. There's a screenshot of an order confirmation form from a popular e-commerce website that's bright red with fraud warnings. There's a whole lot of documents proving that, yup, this was definitely credit card fraud - for context, this is the worst thing you can do as a merchant, as you're liable for all credit card fraud that happens through your website.  What you actually need to do is prove the person who made the payment is the cardholder. We have extensive guidelines on what to do, which the guy ignored just like he ignored the fraud warnings. \n\nSo I call the guy, verify him etc. I will be ME and guy is WF for Wannabe Fraudster. \n\nMe: \"I'm sorry you've lost your dispute. I'll be happy to answer any questions you have about the process.\" \n\nWF: \"I don't understand. Did you not get the evidence I submitted?\" \n\nI start to explain that, unfortunately, this looks like a genuine case of credit card fraud and... WF interrupts me. \n\nWF: \"Of course it was. That's what my evidence was for!\"\n\n-\n\nIn the conversation that follows, it becomes clear that the guy understood perfectly well that the payment was likely made with a stolen credit card and shipped the merchandise anyway, thinking that either the issuing bank or we would pay for it because the charge was authorised by the network. I tell him nope. \n\nWF: \"But that's what credit cards do, right? When you say it was stolen the bank gives you your money back.\"\n\nMe: \"Correct, and they take it back from the merchant at the same time, plus fees.\"\n\nWF: \"But I proved it was fraud, so you're going to pay for it, right?\"\n\nAt this point, I'm honestly struggling. Um, no, dude. You can't cash in on someone else committing credit card fraud and get away with it. And you can't just call a company, tell them you expected to cheat them out of thousands and ask them why they won't go along with it. \n\n-\n\nI give him my usual speech about due diligence with a few more ahhhs and uhmms than usual, but at some point the line went dead. I guess he wasn't interested. In any case, I passed the guy's file and the recorded call on to our internal risk assessment team to check if they want to close his account. \n\nWhat the everloving fuck? I can't decide if he's a criminal, or just stupid, or criminally stupid. \n",

Most of these calls are straightforward and quick, after install you call us, just agree to our terms via email, choose paper or e-billing and that’s about it. \n\nHOWEVER I get calls ALL THE FUCKING TIME from people who have not only never used a computer before, but have quite literally never been on the internet before. Why they chose to walk blindly into the world of computers with no one to help them but their ISP is beyond me. That’s like going to Honda after buying a brand new car and asking for driving lessons. We are not paid to sit on the phone with Barbara for 3 hours teaching her how to watch cooking shows on ‘The Youtube’. I am here to take payments and troubleshoot your internet. If the issue is that you have no idea what a browser is, that is not my problem. \n\nAnyway, call comes in for a new activation, older lady, intro, verification etc done. She has NOT told me at this point that she’s never been on the internet before. \n\nMe: Alright so all you need to do to complete the activation is log into your email and follow the link we sent you to agree to our terms. \n\nC: Ok I’ll do that! \n\n(Cue about 3 minutes of silence. I really try not to rush people but she wasn’t doing anything)\n\nMe: Have you been able to log into your email?...\n\nC: Yup almost there!\n\n(Cue another 3 minutes of silence. It should not take this fucking long to log into an email)\n\nMe: Do you need help or...\n\nC: Well I’m typing in my email but I don’t know how to make the curly A. \n\nMe: *spends another 5 minutes teaching her how to type that @ symbol* Now type in your password...are you logged in?\n\nC: Well I’m putting it into the Google and it’s not working!\n\n(Cx has a Gmail account so I’m ASSUMING she’s logging in via the Gmail log in page...)\n\nMe: So you’re at Gmail.com?\n\nC: YES!!!\n\nMe: Is it telling you your password is wrong or...\n\nC: Yes it keeps saying Incorrect password with a big blue screen!\n\n(Holy shit, she is literally just typing her email into the lock screen on her PC)\n\nMe: Ma’am, does it say Windows at the bottom of your screen? With a red square shaped button at the bottom right? \n\nC: Yes!!!\n\nMe: Ma’am... have you ever logged into your email before?\n\nC: Well to be honest my son made it for my last night when he was setting up this new computer and I’ve never used a computer before...\n\n*NO NO NO NOT TODAY*\n\nMe: Is your son there by any chance and can help you?\n\nC: No he went back to (place hundreds of miles away)\n\n(At this point we’ve been talking for 45 minutes and have gotten precisely no where. She has no idea what she’s doing and there is no way I’m gonna teach someone who has NEVER USED A COMPUTER BEFORE how to use a brand fucking new one.)\n\nMe: Ma’am I’m sorry but I think you need to go back to the place you bought it from or a local tech support outfit and ask someone for help, or even a friend or family member who is better with computers...\n\nC: Well you have to help me you’re the internet people!!\n\nMe: Yes, we get your internet working, but we cannot teach you how to use a computer over the phone. I’m sorry but you’ll need to find someone who can help you in person...\n\nC: Well this is just great, I spent all this money and I can’t even use the damn thing! All I want to do is watch quilting videos!\n\n(Well maybe your dumbass son could’ve taught you how to use the fucking thing before he left)\n\nMe: (an hour into the call now) Again, I’m sorry but until we have someone who is a little more tech savvy on the line I cannot help you. \n\nShe finally ended up hanging up THANK GOD. I feel bad for these people to a point but it’s just so short sighted to pay for internet and a computer and a router etc etc and not at least go to the library or to a friends house to learn how to use one before spending all that money.

        "text": "So I used to work for a luxury car brand in their call center. Said luxury car brand had many problems with their brakes being too loud when it was wet outside. Now, this is a normal phenomenon with performance brakes, you'll hear the brakes squeal whether you're driving a Porsche, Audi, BMW, or any other sports/luxury car. But of course because it's a *luxury* car, that's not acceptable and a good 50% of our calls at the center between the months of October and March were about brake noise.\n\nSo we're rolling into April, and I've already decided I've had enough. I'd been working at the center for eight months at that point, and after waking up on a near daily basis by stress-vomiting the remains of my dinner from the last night I decided that the meager wage I was being paid to get screamed at on a regular basis wasn't worth it. \n\nAnyway, a guy calls in with a **Flagship Vehicle**. For those who don't know **Flagship Vehicle** owners are supposed to be treated with kid gloves because they spent six figures on the **Flagship Vehicle** and the luxury car brand wants to make sure that they buy another **Flagship Vehicle** when they want a new car. And as I'm sure you can guess by this point the brakes on his **Flagship Vehicle** were making noise when he stepped on the brakes.\n\nOkay, lets give him some troubleshooting options. Brakes squeal when metal dust builds up on the brake discs, brake hard to clean it off, same way you would with rust. Nope, unacceptable, fix my brakes now. Take it to the dealer, they can clean your brakes for you. Nope, unacceptable, fix my brakes now, and I don't want to pay anything for it. Sir, your car is three years old and you have 60,000 miles on it. You are way outside your brake warranty, which doesn't even cover this. I want to speak to a manager.\n\n*sigh*\n\nOur \"team leads\" take calls, in theory. In practice, they spend 80% of their clocked in time training new hires because the brand can't keep anyone on the phones for even a full year. I do not have a manager available. I'll have one call you back.\n\n\"Fine, but you know? I expected more as a **Flagship Vehicle** owner. You don't sound very upset about this.\"\n\nI snapped. Eight months of constant verbal abuse finally wore me out and I uttered the words I'm sure everyone who has ever worked in a call center has longed to say.\n\n\"You know what buddy? Suck my dick.\"\n\n*click*\n\nHe never called in again. I never heard anything from the higher ups, so I'm guessing the call wasn't recorded. I quit the position two weeks later, and after three months of unemployment where the only job offers I received were for other call center positions, I am happily employed as a bartender on the other side of the state.\n\nI love my new job, but every time I see one of those cars on the road I'm reminded of how good it felt to finally tell one of those entitled fucks to blow me.\n\n\nEdit: Fixed a timing mistake in my second to last paragraph",

        "text": "Hey, u/Majahzi back at it with another tale from my call center. \n\nI work for $LargeCellCompany’s customer service. I am in Management so I take a mix of supervisor calls and normal incoming calls. \n\nMe: u/Majahzi\n\nC: Customer\n\nMe: Thanks for calling, this is u/Majahzi, Can I have your name please?\n\nC: Hi, this is Customer. I was promised $100 a few months ago and never received it. Can you look into it for me?\n\nMe: Absolutely! Give me a minute to look over the notes on your account. \n\nSo 9/10 when someone calls specifically for a credit on their account, there are no supporting remarks and we have to negotiate an inconvenience credit. Luckily, this time I found a notation where a rep promised her $100 to offset a charge for service disconnection that was due to a (very) late payment. \n\nUnluckily for her, the rep was mistaken about *when* she would get it. Someone had given her a credit two weeks prior and they spoke a day or two before the bill came out that reflected both the charge and the credit. That bill was back in July so the amounts canceled out to be a normal looking bill. Easily overlook-able. \n\nMe: Okay I see here in July you spoke to someone that said you would be receiving a $100 credit in August. They were mistaken. It looks like someone else had given you the $100 prior to that bill and you had already received this money a few months ago. \n\nC: No I didn’t. And even if I did, I was disconnected in August and my September statement has more charges. I want those taken off. \n\nMe: I don’t see any more charges on any of your bills since July, where we waived the $100. You wouldn’t be owed anything if you haven’t been disconnected since then. \n\nC: Well maybe someone forgot to write it down!\n\nMe: Disconnections are automatically stamped in your account notes as well as in a separate system in our computer. I have checked both of those locations and you have not been disconnected beside the time where we have you your $100 back. \n\nC: So you aren’t going to give me the money that I was promised?\n\nMe: No, I am not because someone else has already given it to you. If you have time I can show you on our website where you can see your bills and I’ll point out the $100 we gave you. It is even categorized as a reimbursement of your disconnection charges. \n\nC: I am not near a computer so I can’t. \n\nMe: I see we are talking on an iPhone. If you put me on speakerphone I can show you how to view it on our app. \n\nC: I can’t browse the internet while I am talking\n\nThis is a standard feature but a few customers either opt out or it slips under our raider to add it to the account. \n\nMe: I just added that feature to your account free of charge. Now please open the $LargeCellCompany app. \n\nC: I am at work and I don’t have time. I can’t believe you aren’t going to give me my money!\n\nMe: Trust me, I would if I found that we didn’t already give it to you. I’ll send you a text with a link that will bring you to the bill that shows your credit. Is there anything else I can do for you today?\n\nMy “supervisor” status gives me leeway to add well more than $100 to an account if I see fit. And honestly if she didn’t already get the money, I would have given it to her with no hassle. \n\nPlease, check your bills.\n",

Ok then please look it up, there should be 821,45€ posted yesterday.\n\nC: thanks, i will\n\n\nreally i do not understand, why so many people call us, where their money is, before they even looked, if it isnt already in theiry account.\n\n\n(i fully understand, that it is possible to overlooking it, if your account balance is negative (and stays so, but you thought it will be positive, when the money is received) or if the bank takes some of it, as soon as it is posted in their bank account, cause they are owning theiry bank money)\n\n\n\nSecond tale:\n\nOur Callcenter is a half a hour longer available than the physical branches.\nit is few minutes before the branches are closed.\n\ni will be me, client will be C\n\n\nme: standard greeting\n\nC: Hello, how long are you open today?\n\nme: per phone you can reach us till (closing time callcenter) and personally we are open till (closing time branch, half an hour before callcenter closes - and as for time of call, in a few minutes). \n\nC: ok, i will be there in 15 minutes.\n\nme: sorry the branch closes at (time) – that is in a few minutes. Maybe i can help you?\n\nC: no, i will be there in 15 minutes.\n\nme: im sorry, but the house will be closed, when you arrive in 15 minutes\n\nC: so i cant go in?\n\nme: Yes, i'm sorry - maybe i can help you?\n\nC: no, i will go tomorrow.\n\n\n----------\nand as it happened today, a very nice bonus happy tale i also want to share - from someboby who was \n\n1) friendly, \n\n2)prepared and  \n\n3) thought ahead and took care of his responibilities!\n\n\nwe all have too often calls, where the people do not qualify for some (and more rare for all) of this points - so i want to share this nice call with you :)\n\n\ni will be me - he will be C (client).\n\n\nme: standard greeting procedure - followed by verification process with him.\n\nC: i only want to be shure, you know, that i will stay in hospital for an op next week.\n\nme: yes it is noted, that you will stay in hospital from (date). i see in your account, that we still need the papers for september.\n\n\n(some clients needs to send us montly papers - at the end of the month, so we can proof, they qualfify for the money of this month. Also: insurance is linked to this money - when you do not qualify, you are not insuranced with this agency. Normaly no problem, if we get the papers later within a timeline - when he qualifies for money, he will be insuranced during this time backdated. But, he will stay in hospital next week and i do want to avoid problems for him with his insurance, so i mention it previously for him - cause from hospital it will be difficult for him to handle it)\n\n\nC: thank you!  i know - i already prepared them and will send them via mail in a few minutes - then all should be prepared and i will receive my money in time (and as i mentioned - more important in this case is the insurance on time).\n\nme: i hope so - but i can not asure you, it will be handled in time for payday (cause many people are sending papers at the end of month), but the money and insurance will be sent, when it is executet from our part. \n\nc: no problem, i already talked to the insurance company and my landlord - if the money and insurance is a few days late, so they know and there will be no misshaps during my stay in hospital.\n\nme: it seems you have prepared, what you can - from our side, we can check your qualification when we have the papers and all is set. for the time you are sick, your money will come in the same height from the insurance and not us.\n\nc: should i contact them, do you know this?\n\nme: i recommend it, when you havent gotten money from them in the near past, check if they have your current bank account number, or they will send you the money via postal service to your home adress - and as you are staying in the hospital, that could be inconvenient.\n\nc: thank you very much - then i am prepared as i can be.\n\nme: yes it seems so :) please contact us, when you know from what date you will be well again.\n\nc: i will - i wish you a great weekend\n\nme: thank you, you also - and get well with your op.\n\n\n\nit was a really pleasant call and i do like it so much, when the people think ahead and avoid problems :)\n(had some calls with the same situation - but they called, when they were already in hospital and had no possibility to send us the needed papers so we could qualify them the money and insurance)\n",

Here is a tale from a previous call center I worked at where we offered 3rd party repair for a popular company on appliances and phones that have the company's insurance. This one is about a lady and her broken dishwasher.\n\n**Me** = Me\n\n**PW** = Privileged Woman\n\n**Me** - Thank you for contacting Generic Call Center, this is Agent SpiralingViolence, and how may I assist you today?\n\n**PW** - Yeah, my dishwasher is broken and I need someone to fix it.\n\n**Me** - I'm so sorry to hear about that, but I would be more than happy to help. Let me get your account pulled up and we can see about getting you the earliest available appointment.\n\n*Okay so boring part where I verify her info, set up the claim etc. This call was on a Thursday, and the thing about setting up an appointment, is you can't do same day or next day, due to the way MOST Service Providers schedule their days. We also can't schedule weekends for the same reason, so unfortunately she would have to wait until the following Monday before the repair, but that was the best option available to her for a repair that was completely free through her insurance.*\n\n**Me** - Okay, PW, I am seeing here the earliest available date for X/XX, which is this coming Monday, The Service provider Would be--\n\n*PW cuts me off* \n\n**PW** - UM, No, that won't work. I need you to get me an appointment today or tomorrow.\n\n**Me** - I'm sorry, unfortunately I am unable to do that for you, since our service providers set up their schedules a day in advance, Thursdays and Fridays are already booked up.\n\n*And as I was about to explain to her that we can't do weekends, she interrupts and asks me to schedule it for Saturday, and when I tell her we can't do that either, she gets really upset.*\n\n**PW** - Well, I have a party this weekend and I CANNOT wash these dishes by hand. You're going to have to get me an appointment tomorrow or connect me to a supervisor.\n\n*I also hate when customers ask for a Sup even though they have the same systems as us and can only do literally exactly what we do, so I try to let them know calmly.*\n\n**Me** - I'm sorry, I won't be able to do next day appointments, as I have said prior, and a supervisor won't be able to either, but if you would like, I could place you on a brief hold while I get in contact with a supervisor to assist you.\n\n**PW** - FINE, I'LL JUST FIND MY OWN REPAIR MAN! YOU ARE USELESS AND I WON'T BE BUYING PRODUCTS FROM [company] AGAIN! \n\n--\n\nShe hung up. I couldn't schedule a date since she didn't make any effort to tell me that Monday was okay or not, so now she has a broken dishwasher and probably has to pay out of pocket for a repair we could have done for free.\n",

I'M OLD ENOUGHT TO HAVE A CREDIT CARD. \n\nMe: Then the options that I have for you at the moment are: being added as an authorize user to this account, or get a prepaid card. If you are interested in a prepaid card...\n\nSG: I DONT WANT A PREPAID CARD. I WANT TO BE ADDED TO HIS ACCOUNT, AS AN PRIMARY LIKE HIM.\n\nCH: Is there any way to add her as primary on this account.\n\nMe: I'm afraid there is not, Sir.\n\nSG: WELL FIGURE SOMETHING OUT, OR I'LL TELL MOM. \n\nCH: Please, I really need to do this (He sounds desperate right now).\n\nMe: Sir I understa...\n\nCH: No, you don't understand! My wife told me she will kick me out of the house unless I added our daughter as an owner of my account. You don't know her, she will do it. I have nowhere to go.

The ivory tower people in my building were very not happy expected me to get the customer to scan and email in the official change of name form to prove they weren’t trying to sneakily transfer an account to someone else.\n\nConsidering I spent 20 minutes talking to the lady I refused. The postal address, phone numbers, date of birth and attached online details were all the same. I won eventually and now they are reviewing the policy.  :( \n\nI just wanted to know if your centre had any guildlines/policys for transgender/gender neutral customers and updating things to reflect their wishes? \n\n\nTL:DR transgender MtF emails in, I call do every single bit of DP and disclosure I can think of.

And that actually turned out the case for the next 4 years. Christmas Day was closed but Christmas Eve or Stephen's Day was a regular day/normal holiday with normal holiday availibility requirements. \n\nThen, management had a brilliant idea: Let's open the callcenter on Christmas Day. So, they decided to use the same plan they had been using for Christmas in the USA in Europe: Ask for volunteers for the 25th and offer double time (instead of time and a half), tell people that if they volunteer, they will likely be selected. What could possibly go wrong? Weeeelll,  let me enumerate:\n\n* The American callcenters hire local people who could see their families if they had a day off, the European one hired expats in the RoI who, due to the ban on taking vacation days could not see their families anyways\n\n* Christianity is a Big Thing in the USA, but not only is it a lesser affair in Europe, but also ĝere quite a few of the employees Muslims\n\n* The big family festivities in our language team are on the 24th anyways - a day where we already had to work. \n\n* Ireland is an expensive place to live and visiting the family at home requires money.\n\nSo, it came as it had to: the managers were swamped with volunteers. Then, there was a huge blowup when only a small amount of the people who volunteered to work on Christmas Day were scheduled. Several team meetings were used to attempt to keep the mood from boiling over... then, the day happened. The people who did make it onto the roster arrived for work, set themselves to Available... and remained that way for more than one hour. Apparently, the fact that the callcenter was open had never been communicated to the customers, who did not expect to the callcenter was open during a federally-recognized holiday. So we got Double Time to do in the callcenter what we would've done at home: mostly surf the web.",

Backyard or front yard? \n\nCx: front. No fence. If my kids trip over this lawn, I'm suing! Okay, you hear me.

This is because not all providers can treat the same symptoms so they make this easy on us by giving us a list of symptoms and specific scheduling instructions for each symptom. For example, the list of symptoms for the orthopedic clinics will have you schedule with one set of doctors for a hand injury vs. a knee injury. I have to follow instructions or clinics will cancel patient’s appointments because they’re mischeduled and it’s just bad for everyone. \n\nMe will be me. IL will be impatient lady. \n\nMe: Thank you for calling the medical center. How can I help you?\n\nIL: Yes I need to know if Dr. X has any appointments on Monday. \n\nMe: Sure I can take a look. [verifies basic HIPAA info and once I get the chart up I see the address and phone haven’t been verified in 3 months, protocol is to verify these] It looks like we also need to go over your address and phone number. Can I start with your address?\n\nIL: No! I don’t need to do that. Just check if Dr. X has any appointments. \n\nMe: [This part is also protocol for when they decline to go over this part] Alright we don’t have to do it now but just so you know, the next person you speak to will ask you as well. \n\nIL: No they won’t! Do you job and read the notes! Just get me an appointment \n\nMe: [wtf?] Alright... and what would you like to be seen about? \n\nIL: I want. To see. Dr. X. Get me. An. Appointment. \n\nMe: Yes, what would you like to see dr. X about. \n\nIL: ugh! [symptom redacted]\n\nMe: Thank you. Just a moment while I look at my instructions. [instructions for this symptom say to refer the patient to an urgent care clinic and if they decline to send call the clinic and in the case of after hours as was today to send a message] So it looks like the clinic recommends you to see an urgent care clinic...\n\nIL: No! Did you not hear me? I want an appointment with Dr. X. \n\nMe: I understand that but I’m following protocol. If you’d like to see Dr. X about this I’ll have to send a message and have them call you back on Monday. \n\nIL: No no no no no! Get me a supervisor! Now!\n",

All CC staff were based in a local office as people in this country will not speak to an outsourced (foreign) office. \n\nSo I'm there about 4 months and working solely on bill pay accounts. Dealing with everything from billing queries to basic tech support (switch it off and back on).\n\nI'll be Me, upset customer will be UC\n\nMe: Thank you for call Large Multinational Telecoms, Me speaking, how can I help? \n\nUC: My phone isn't receiving calls\n\nMe: I'm very sorry to hear that. (Proceed to verify account). What exactly is happening, are you calling from the phone right now?\n\nUC: YES I'M CALLING FROM THE PHONE HOW ELSE WOULD I CALL??!!!! YOUR NETWORK WONT LET ME RECEIVE CALLS! MY WIFE IS IN A HIGH DEPENDENCY UNIT IN (Large hospital specialising in cancer treatment) DYING AND I HAVE TO LEAVE HER EVERYTIME I NEED TO MAKE OR RECEIVE A CALL!! FIX IT NOW! MY FAMILY CANT CONTACT ME FOR UPDATES ON HER CONDITION!\n\nNow, immediately I know what the problem is. \n1- Not supposed to use phones in a hospital anyway. I believe some special care units even install signal blockers\n\n2- The building itself is blocking coverage (this was a few years back when signal was 85% coverage at best in this country and certainly couldn't get through to high dependency unit in the middle of hospital)\n\nThis \"gentleman\" would not stop talking long enough for me to tell him what the problem was. He shouted at me for a solid five minutes. When I eventually got to speak, it went like this\n\nMe: (stunned from being shouted at and also the situation this man was in) Sir, I'm terribly sorry about your wife. \nMy apologies, but unfortunately there is nothing we can do as \n1- your phone is working, you are calling me right now and\n 2- there is no signal outage in the area, we are not responsible for providing coverage inside the building. \nI can log a ticket with our tech team to check if there is a potential outage in the are but there is no guarantee it will resolve your issue. I'm very sorry there is no more I can do\n\nAfter I tell him this, there's a further two minutes of incomprehensible yelling saying he didn't want to log a ticket he just wanted to be able to use the phone inside. I got quite upset and had to mute the phone. It was obvious he was upset himself over his wife being on deaths door, and was lashing out at the faceless person to blame for his phone not working.\n\nIn the end, he gave me enough info to log a tech ticket, it didn't seem to placate him at all, and he hung up on me after saying \"my phone better work\" \n\nI'm not a robot, and certainly didnt envy his situation, but Im sorry, go spend this time with your wife, don't waste her last hours on the phone with anyone!

        "text": "I've worked with quite a few morons in my time. I've worked on the phones for years and been a supervisor/trainer. I thought I would share 'Rob' with you.\n\nI fully believe the word arsehole describes him perfectly.\n\nA fellow coach/trainer was in charge of training Rob though he was being added to my team. Quite common. For the six weeks he was in training, my colleague grew more disillusioned with the world. She constantly complained about him since he paid no attention to her and made up what he didn't know with absolute confidence. Even the folks he was in training with didn't want to know him since he was a know it all and was plain disrespectful to any female figure in such a sleazy way there was no way to handle him except walk away. There were some males who were uncomfortable with it since he was quite obvious about it.\n\nWe handled life insurance calls so you have to know what you're talking about, or ask an experienced agent if no coach is around. That's why there is so much training.\n\nWe do a new seating plan so new agents are next to agents that have been there the longest so they have support and can get to know the team.\nWithin a week, he was pissing my team off so much he was moved to sit next to me. Yippee.\nNot only was he giving completely wrong information, he was also 'helping' by taking calls for other departments. Big no no. People would phone back and scream at others in the team for the shite he'd told them.\n\nSo he was given to me as a project. I told him I'd be listening into him sporadically through the day. Ran over the basics which he fluffed his way past, continued his look of casual surprise at a female being professional and actually expecting him to do his job.\n\nThis didn't stop the 'helpful' calls which were breaching Data Protection. Sitting next to him, in full hearing while he continued spewing utter nonsense was grinding me down. I'm still unsure how someone can have so much balls and sheer ignorance.\n\nEven when I signalled him to stop talking and put a client on hold, he'd just carry on giving wrong info and ignore me. \n\nHe would run his hands through his hair and stretch as I spoke to him, attempting to give me bedroom eyes. I think this was so I would instantly fall in love with him and do all his work and stop giving him feedback. Didn't work.\n\nHe was next to the printer so it was his perfect chance to chat up anything female that walked past. More complaints against him. He believed a call centre would be full of lads going to the pub and shagging whatever skirt was in the office. I know because he told me that.\n\nBut the straw that broke the camel's back for me and finally managed to get rid of him was one call. \nAlthough the managers were mostly useless, mine could be relied on to follow procedure.\n\nI start scoring Rob's calls. Mr Smith was calling to register the death of his wife.\nWhen I heard the reject ask how the funeral service went, I nearly reached over and punched him there and then. If there is one thing not to fucking ask. The most sensitive call we get and this tosser is asking ridiculous questions. If the client chats about it, of course respond but never open such a huge can of worms on your own.\n\n\"I only ask as I'm a Catholic and we take these things seriously\" \nWhen I heard him say that, I pulled out my earphones and handed them to my manager.\n\nI watched my managers neck go red as he listened in, hearing Rob talk about when his grandpa died and how important it was to him and basically prattling on like the incompetent fool he is.\n\nEven at the meeting to discuss this, Rob couldn't understand what he had done wrong. Literally playing the call for him and he still couldn't understand.\nLuckily that day he apparently had been head hunted by another company and been offered this amazing job because of his 'experience' and they were begging him to go. Since we were being \"unfair\" to him he would take the new job. Halle-fucking-luyah.\n\nI got a new job about a year later. I found out 2 weeks in that this was the company that had \"head hunted\" him. That was a load of shit. The salary he said he'd been offered was a complete lie and he only lasted a week since he was hated there too. \n\nI am still mystified as to how he sees the world. To be that self involved must be quite cosy. But insanely frustrating for everyone else. I've never been so close to slapping the headset off someone. ",

Pls stay safe and call back after the hurricane has passed.\n\n\nDC: oh its basically gone now so can you send someone.\nMe: I can try (basically just to humor her)\n\nI get laughed off the phone by 2 more providers and tell the customer basicay no dice and again, she sounds like shes going to cry.\n\nKind of sad cuz I feel like she just was worried about her husband but you had weeks to plan for this and I'm pretty sure its safer to bunker down then to try to make a mad dash away from a hurricane on flooded/debris filled roads that youre legally restricted from using at the moment.

My order qualifies!\n\nMe: sir, it's the product total that has to add up to $49.

        "text": "&lt;Note: Speech will be a bit embellished so that it don't get boring in translation!&gt;  \nSo this happened ... Quite a few years back now that I think about it.  \nI was working for a major mobile phone service provider back then (well, still am, but yeah).  \nThey had a standard operating procedure that if you didn't pay your invoice on time, after a certain amount of time it being overdue, your calls would get automagically routed to us in customer support and if you still didn't pay, the service would get suspended.  \n  \nWell, in comes this call from, let's call him FFBS (short for Famous football star (soccer for you 'muricans)), on the direct line for overdue invoices.  \n  \n*#me == Well, me.*  \n*#FFBS == The customer.*  \n  \n  \n#me: &lt;standard opening spiel about who answers and for what company&gt;  \n#FFBS: Yo, I didn't call you guys, why are you answering all my calls?!  \n#me: Well, sir, we can take a look at that, if I could just have some info from you for security reasons &lt;asks for stuffs&gt;.  \n#FFBS: &lt;gives stuffs&gt;.  \n#Me: &lt;pulls up his account&gt; Well sir, it would appear that you've been direct connected to us here at customer service since you haven't paid your invoice from last month yet.  \n#FFBS: The F*** YOU MEAN I HAVEN'T PAID MY INVOICE?!?!  \n#FFBS: I sure as hell have paid it!  \n#Me: Well, from what I can see here, we haven't received your payment yet. When did you pay your invoice?  \n#FFBS: On! F***ing! Time!  \n#Me: If that is the case, then I would advice that you contact your bank and see if there have been some trouble on their side.  \n#FFBS: I sure as hell won't do that, it's your fault, now open up my calls again and then fix the bloody payment problem yourself!  \n#Me: I'm sorry, sir. I unfortunately cannot do that, since you have, for a fact, made sure that the payment have arrived with us and closed the amount you owe us, as I'm sure you are aware, you are legally obligated to do.  \n#FFBS: &lt;Random curses against me personally about something how he's gonna f*** me up and other stuff that's par for the course if I don't fix his service right away&gt;  \n#Me: Sir, if you don't calm down then I'm going to have to disconnect this call and you can call back after you've calmed down and talked with your bank about your payment.  \n#FFBS: &lt;More screaming&gt;  \n#Me: &lt;disconnects the call&gt;  \n\nAt this point in the story, something clicked when I was typing up my call interaction note, something about his named sounded familiar.  \nOff I go on a quick google search with his name, year, month and date of birth.  \nLo and behold, google spits out as the top hits on the whole first page that this should be Famous Football Star.  \nAnd now I use some of my powers and pull up the national register of residents (Yeah, maybe not the best power to give a lowly service rep, but, I wasn't (and still aren't) complaining!)  \nLo and behold, this is, for a fact, said FFBS!  \nGoes to show you, money in the bank don't a brain give!  \n  \nTL;DR: I pretty much told a famous guy that he'd better fess up the cash he's due if he wanted his phone service back!",

My job is inbound but sometimes issues come up on customers accounts where we need to reach out to them, or they email us and ask for a callback. They do this so they can jump the line and don't feel like waiting on hold. I really don't like these ones, they clog up our outbound time and they're always SUPER entitled about wait times. \n\nAnyway, I really love outbound because 80% of the time they don't answer so I just get paid to leave voicemails all day. The customer in question has been emailing us for MONTHS to no avail. Her issue MUST be dealt with over the phone and she flat out refuses to call us because of our 'wait times' and never answers when we call her. Now, we have VERY generous hours, and literally NO wait times on the weekends. \n\nSo I give this lady a call and Jesus take the wheel she answers. I introduce myself and tell her I'm calling about her ongoing issue. \n\nCustomer: UGH finally you people call! I've only been trying to get a hold of you for months! \n\nMe: Oh I'm so sorry to hear that...

        "text": "So I work at a research call center. We conduct all kinds of studies over the phone (and some through mail)--mostly on behalf of state entities. State Health Department, CDC, Voc Rehab, Office of Traffic Safety, etc. \n\nI can share hundreds of stories (and possibly will share a few of them) where I was left with boiled blood and grated teeth by the end of the call, but I figured my first story should be about my favorite call encounter, or rather, the one that's impacted me the most. It happened about two years ago.\n\nWe operate from 10am-9pm on weekdays, 10am-5pm on weekends. It was 7:53 at the time, and I was calling for a study that took on average 4-7 minutes. I had one of my worst refusals earlier that day, so I was feeling down. It was a rough night. However, I then called this woman. She sounded middle aged and tired. She was curt, and obviously annoyed that I dared to call her at 8:00pm. I, bracing myself for a flurry of insults and complaints, explained I'm calling on behalf of Sponsor, and wanted to speak with Fname Lname. \"Oh, that's my mom,\" she said, \"I'll give you to her and she can deal with you.\" I let out a sigh of relief (silently, of course) and waited. \n\nFname Lname had a rather raspy voice--one afflicted by years of cigarettes and ravaged by time--but she didn't require that I speak up or slow down any, as similar voices do. She was nice, and agreed to partake in the study without any complaint.\n\nWe started the interview and after almost every question she'd elaborate. And by elaborate, I don't mean on the answer necessarily, but rather, she'd simply talk. She would weave stories from her childhood in between the questions as I slowly moved the interview along. She'd talk about her participation in the marches with Martin Luther King; she discussed her view on the current state of the world and her hopes for the future. She shared with me that she was on her death bed. That in a few weeks she'd mostly likely be gone.\n\nAt the end of our interviews, we always ask: Do you have any questions or concerns that I can address?\n\n\"Yes, well. Not a question, nor concern really, but I really wanted to Thank you. Lately I've more or less been forgotten in my wheel chair. People speak for me, over me. They don't listen anymore. I guess it's hard for them since my time is coming so close now, but I wanted to thank you for listening, for letting me talk. I know a lot of it didn't have to do with the survey, but it was nice to speak again and be heard. I hope you lead a good life--pursue higher education and stick through it. And if that's not your calling, that's okay! but pursue your dreams--find what gets you energized, what gets you impassioned, and go for it! Be it music, or art, or family, or research,\" she laughed softly at this point and I thanked her. \"You have a wonderful life ahead of you and its yours to do with as you please. I think I'll get some sleep now, thanks again, and have a great night.\"\n\nI'm not allowed to really show emotion--to show praise or positive feedback, nor negative feedback or disgust. We can't, as it has the potential to introduce bias in their answers. We are to be realistic robots who must read the questions a certain way and take only the answers listed, to prod respondents along as they answer so that we can get the data needed and hang up. I never hated this more than I did that night. But alas, rules are rules.\n\nI changed my college major after that. (And again, after that.) It'll be a harder future for me at first, but it'll be MY future, and I'm excited for it. And I have that raspy voice, now absent from this world, to thank for it.",

I'm personally impacted by the hurricane, and still don't have power after 6 days in 90-100 degree heat...and people are complaining about not having cable. So I think I'm just a little frustrated and taking the yelling personally when I know I shouldn't. I'm working crazy overtime to make up for the 3 days of non pay since they refused to close the call center down, but closed the store and techs. (We're all in the same building, but agents in call center were required to work, and everyone else was absent/pay compensated) \n\nBut anyways, this customer today put me over the edge: \n\nCustomer calls in regarding not having service after he was digging in his yard and sliced his cable. He's not in a hurricane impacted state. And he's livid. We'll call him Mr. Professional Electrician or Mr.PE for short. \n\nMe: Thank you for calling company. How can I help?\nMr. PE: omg finally I held for 30 mins. Yeah, I cut my cable line while I was digging in the yard, and I fixed it already, I already patched up the line, but I need a bullet sent bc I have no service. \nMe: I'm sorry to hear about that line, and I'm happy to help! Let's take a look at some signals here. \n\n(Check area just customer is out. No service at all. 9/10 when the cable line is cut from underground, the line has to be replaced, and not repaired.) \n\nMe: well, Mr.Pe, my apologies but I'm not showing any service to the home at all. I think the best thing would be to schedule a technician. There's a good chance that whole cable line has to be replaced now. Would that be okay? \n\nMr.Pe: no. That's not okay. Send a bullet. \n\nMe: do you mean a signal? The automated system does when you first call in, and that's the same one we send here. I always send that signal when a  customer calls in because you're right, that usually can fix the issue. But In your case, we need that line replaced.\n\nMr. pe: -screech cuss screech- I personally repaired that line. I know it's fixed. You're lying to me. Send another one. \n\nMe: sure! I'm happy too! -sends a hit that I'll know will fail- I'm sure you did a great job repairing the line, but it needs to be replaced. So can I schedule a technician while we wait? \n\nMr. Pe: no. I don't want one. I want your bullet to work. \n\nMe: it failed, Mr. Pe. That line is not working. We need it replaced. \n\nMr.pe: -cue 5 minute rant about how worthless the company is and why \"bullets\" worked before, etc etc. - ...... well, listen here little girl, you don't know what it's like to be without service. You work for the damn company. I bet you have service all the frigging time. \n\nMe: -snaps- actually, Mr.pe right now, I don't. I don't even have power since Sunday because of the hurricane. And let me tell you, I get it. I'm sorry. But the line needs to be replaced. Now would Monday morning or afternoon work for a tech?\n\nMr.Pe: Monday morning. I'm not happy. That line is repaired. It works. \n\nMe: you're all scheduled. We'll see you then! \n\nMr.pe: why isn't the line working. It's been repaired.\n\nMe: who repaired the line, sir? \n\nMr. Pe: a professional electrician. \n\nMe: then my apologies, Mr. Pe, because a professional electrician would hopefully know a damaged coaxial cable or a fiber can't be repaired 90% of the time. It needs to be replaced if there's a slightest crinkle in it. You're all set with the appointment. Anything else? \n\nMr.Pe: you can f off.  \n\nMe: I'm sorry again! Have a nice day! :) \n\nedit: 90% of the time****",

        "text": "This tale is from a couple years back.  Long time lurker of this sub, first time poster. \n\nI was essentially CSR for an online university, but I mainly dealt with Admissons/ Enrollment into the university. I was a trained sales monkey, basically.  I was fresh out of college and up to my ears in student loans, and this job was a real soul sucker, but by God they paid me $20 an hour. I lasted 3 months. (Fired. Didn’t get enough enrollments.  :/)\n\nIn that 3 month period, however, I dealt with all kinds of stupid. This particular story happened on more than one occasion, to the point of where I still have a feel for how the conversation always went. This is that conversation:\n \n(I'll be testicklercanzer, or \"TC\" and Derpy Person will be \"Derpy\")\n\n...after my spiel about the university and the many positives to online degrees ...\n\n\nDerpy: \"So, I really want to be like, a nurse, so do you guys have that?\"\n\n\nTC: \"Uh, no, we do not offer nursing courses as we are an online university, but we do have Bachelors and Masters Degrees available in Healthcare Management. Do you have any interest in being an integral part of the behind the scenes of a working hospital or clinic perhaps?\" (one of those canned responses they make us say)\n\n\nDerpy: \"No, I want to be the one who heals people and gives out prescriptions and things.\"\n \n\n(OK. admirable. They may be derpy, but I will respect the fact they  want to help people, that's actually pretty awesome.)\n\n\nTC: \"Well that is great! I love your passion for helping people. Have you ever considered taking that passion for helping people and going for an associates or bachelors in the criminal justice? (More courses we offer. Can’t just say no, have to keep offering up more things we offer. Trained Monkey.)\n\n\nDerpy: “ Well, no, I just was calling today just to see if you have any online nursing courses ‘cause I can’t afford those big in person universities and I have two kids I have to care for myself. So, you guys don’t have a nursing program?\"\n\n\nTC: No, we do not, but we do have-\n\n\nDerpy: \"Why not though?\"\n\n\nTC: \"Well, it's just not the kind of thing that can be learned in full only online-\"\n\n\nDerpy: (Clearly getting frustrated) Ugh! You would think in this day and age-its just, its like you have to be a millionaire to just become a Nurse! \n\n\n(Wished at this point I could break script and be real with this person. Help her out. But, when you know your supervisor is listening in...)\n\n\nTC: \"I know, things are tough out there, but we do offer other avenues-\"\n\n\nDerpy: \"Ok, look, Do you know of any other online universities that offer nursing degrees??  'Cause otherwise I gotta feed my kids here.\"\n\n\nTC: No, I'm so sorry, we do not, but you will be pleased to find we offer courses in so many high demand-\"\n\n\nShe hung up.  Rightfully so, as we clearly could not help her, and our “script” is just terrible. However, this is just one of the conversations I had with a person who was looking for a nursing degree at an online university, and it always floored me that there were people who thought you could become a NURSE OR DOCTOR --ONLINE.  Would you want to go to a doc or nurse that got their degree online? \n\nOver the months I began going more and more off script and saying things like this to people, in a very polite, encouraging way though, as I did want to keep my soul leaching cubicle job at the time. But I just wanted to be real with people. I didn’t like “scamming” people into pledging to pay for a $30,000 degree they weren’t ready for/ couldn’t afford with their current life situation. The company didn’t care though, and wanted me to stick to the script, get their info, get them to enroll. All in one 30 minute phone conversation.  Ugh.  Even though some people weren’t the brightest that I spoke with, I still felt for them. I rarely felt good about any of the enrollments I did get. \n\nOnce I was fired I eventually got a new job as a CSR for a hospice medical supply company, which was much more fulfilling as I really was helping people in a sense.  Lots more stories there, I’ll save those for another time…mostly sad ones, as it was hospice after all, but very heart warming. \nAnyone else have a good soul sucker job story you felt skeevy about? And thank you for reading.   Apologies for any formatting/grammatical errors.\n\nEdit: formatting\n",

As customer service we dealt with (horrendous) customers over phone, email and chat. The majority of queries were from angry old people who couldn't use computers or late delivery queries.\n\nA little relevant background on the website; when you sign up you enter your postcode and it gives you a drop down menu with all the available addresses under that postcode. An extremely standard thing that pretty much all websites do. As staff we can change your address for you but not choose your address at sign up and we also have a system to see all clicks and move you make on the website. \n\nAnyway, on that glorious day my phone started doing its dreaded ringtone and I braced myself for yet another shitty customer. From now on known as HSL (horse sanctuary lady).\n\n\nMe: Good afternoon welcome to [business] my name is BigEyesBambi, how can I help? \n\nHSL: Yes. You PEOPLE keep delivering my parcel to the wrong address . IT IS NOT hard. This is ridiculous \n\nMe: (actually genuinely as the delivery service are known to be useless) Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear this. Let's get this rectified for you. Can I please take your [details to find account]\n\nHSL: ok BUT this is ridiculous. It's not hard, just deliver it to my address it's in the account. This is ridicous.\n\nMe: I'm sorry about that, could I just take [details] and run through some security and I will get straight on it.\n\nHer: why the hell do you need [details]???? I entered my [details] on your website, which is ridiculously hard to use by the way. \n\nMe: I'm sorry about that I just need to confirm quickly for security.\n\n\nThen follows her reluctantly giving me her details and confirming her identity. I look at her address and notice is a Horse and Pony sanctuary and I'm about to comment on it as I love animals but she cuts in abruptly \n\nHSL: yes anyway, for some reason you stupid people have been delivering my order to the national horse and pony sanctuary next door. It's absolutely ridiculous. My address is clearly on my account and what's more the driver told me the HORSE AND PONY SANCTUARY PEOPLE HATE ME NOW AND ARE TALKING ABOUT ME AND SAYING THEY ARE ANGRY AT ME. HOW COULD YOU DO THIS????\n\nMe: okay well looking at our account I can see the horse and pony sanctuary is listed as the address on your account and - \n\nHSL: (now shrieking) IT ABSOLUTELY IS NOT WHY THE HELL WOULD I DO THAT ???? I KNOW MY ADDRESS???? YOU HAVE CHANGED MY ADDRESS WITHOUT MY PERMISSION THAT IS ILLEGAL!!!!!!!!!!!!! \n\nMe: okay let me look into this. I'm checking the activity on the account and I can see at sign up you entered your postcode [confirms postcode with her] and then the national horse and pony sanctuary was selected as the delivery address so - \n\nHSL: YOU CLEARLY DID THAT. YOU STUPID PEOPLE DID THAT. WHY. WOULD. I. DO. THAT. I. KNOW. MY. ADDRESS. !?£?!?!?!?!??!??!?\n\nMe: I understand that and I'm really sorry about this however we aren't able to select your address at sign up and we also have access to all the activity on your account and I can clearly see that at sign up the horse and pony sanctuary was selected. Don't worry though I've changed it to your address now. \n\nHSL: well if it was selected at sign up. That sounds like it was something I did. It seems like it might be my fault but - WHY WOULD I DO THAT?????\n\nMe: accidents happen but it's fixed now. Your deliveries will come to the right address. Can I help with anything else? \n\nHSL: Oh. No. I need to go and apologise to the woman at the horse sanctuary. \n\n\nWith that she was gone. I checked her account and she'd had 18 monthly orders but only just decided to get in touch..... \n\n",

He wanted to pay off his bill and find new svc. Good shit, lets see what can be done. Call quality was shit, so I had a hard time hearing him, and I informed him of it. Cue the \"I've been on the phone for 1 hour\" noise that occurs when a cx is frustrated with a complicated issue (not a seriously complicated issue, just coworkers not being able to understand him). Something just kinda snapped, and I calmy said \"and I've been on the phone for 6, almost 7 hours, so I understand but I'm trying to help so please let me try\". Absolute peach after that. Call quality was still shit, but much easier for me to verify what was said and get him where he needed to go. \n\nThen an outbound call somehow ended up in my call flow. Fucking hell, a risk account too. I could have sworn this was fixed! Apologize after pre-recorded script about it as he's apologizing for music. Wtf. Okay, lets get right into it. Tell him the reason for the call is a past due balance, says \"oh yeah, meant to pay that. Lemme get my card\".\n\nWtf is this sorcery. I'd normally be interrogated or told they'd take care of it and click. Guys super chill about it. Then, he asks about something else and I say \"that'd be a cx care question, sorry I can't help with that\" and, I swear, \"oh I understand man, you're the payment guy and you can't help there\". I'm just star struck. Felt like I saw a unicorn. This guy was chill as all hell and realized that I wasn't his personal trained monkey. Offered to transfer him, he accepted, and he has (hopefully) gotten his issue fixed. \n\nJust two cases of hey, these are decent people.

He asks for me to rush the card.\n\n&gt; Me: \"Not a problem we can definitely do that, it will be 1-2 business days instead of 5-7-.\"\n\n&gt; ED: \"No, you're going to overnight it.\"\n\nIt's 3PM, the deadline for same day shipping is like 10AM.\n\n&gt; Me: \"Sir, 1) we cannot do that, 2) it's several hours too late for the card to even be sent out today, it will not be sent out until tomorrow at the earliest, likely 1 business day from then.\"\n\n&gt; ED: \"You people are absurd, wasting my time out of my *busy* day like this and leaving me without access to my card.\"\n\n&gt; Me: \"I'm very sorry sir, you can always go into a branch and get a temp card to hold you over.\"\n\n&gt; ED: \"More time wasting, typical.\"\n\nI finish the call like normal, and I'll be honest, I might have \"forgotten\" to waive the $20 rush order fee. \n\nI don't understand some people, I can't even leave your card open if you were in Florida or Houston right now, but this guy expects his $2000 balance to mean we have to treat him like royalty, no. \n\n",

        "text": "I work for an outbound call group. We take pre-scheduled calls that are assigned to us. \n\nWe live on the east coast and we go off eastern time. \n\nSo a client wants a call yesterday at 7PM Arizona time. It's assigned to me. I get to the call a little early and realize that 7PM AZ time translates to 10PM ET, which is when we close. We had to reschedule the call. I asked him for another time *in MST*. This is an important detail.\n\nSee, Arizona is one of two states in the USA that does not observe daylight savings time (the other being Hawaii). This is where the difference in MDT And MST is important. Currently we are in eastern daylight savings time (EDT). If we were to call Montana, they are on MDT, so they are two hours behind. However, Arizona is on MST and NOT MDT, so in addition to being 2 hours behind, they didn't set their clocks forward this year--so they are 3 hours behind. Got all that? Well good.\n\nBecause i got into an empassioned argument with my coworkers who insisted that I illegitimately shoved the call off. I explained the time difference, but they kept saying I was wrong because I asked for another time in MST, which would confuse the client. Idk why, since the client *lives* in MST. It would be more confusing if I asked for a time in EDT. \n\nPlus they kept pulling up Google to \"disprove\" me. Google kept telling them that 7pm MST is 9pm EST, which is correct. However, that's EST and we're in EDT, so we add an hour to that. I also looked up \"current time in Arizona\" and Google correctly displayed a time that was 3 hours behind us.\n\nMy team wasn't having it.\n\nI asked my boss what we should do because this is a clear misunderstanding. He brings us in, we talk about it, my coworkers make the same case that I \"confused\" the client with his *own timezone*. I pointed out the correct conversion and why I gave the time in MST. It was a mini argument. \n\nMy coworkers concluded that I should have clarified with the client what MST means and asked him what time he REALLY means by saying \"Arizona time\". We cannot take a client saying \"call me at 5PM AZ time\" as-is anymore--we have to clarify what that means for us in EDT--which I am sure will only confuse clients further. \n\nAll because I pointed out that 7PM MST is 10PM EDT. \n\nThese people handle your money every day. \n\nI need a drink.",

He wanted to get a quote for a product that costs about $7000, but apparently doesn't trust us enough to give us enough information to make the quote possible.\n\nNonetheless, I pressed for details.  His surname was the final straw.  Fine.  Our supplier has a request in their system to provide a quote to Jim Ah, you don't need my surname.  Hopefully, at least they'll get a laugh from it.",
