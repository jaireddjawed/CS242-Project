        "text": "Recap of previous GameTales:\n\n* [Chapter One:](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3smiit/twitch_trolls_pokemon_part_one_the_meta_creation/) In the Twitch Plays Pokemon world, Lord Bill is a Bad Dude and Magnificent B+A+Start, and, despite his apparent death, through a series of \"coincidences,\" manages to break the fourth wall and crash my computer IRL (I'm only halfway joking). This leads to the very meta creation of my first Twitch Trolls Pokemon RP character, a sentient virus called Lord_Bill.exe. (The character was inspired by a character of the same name created by /u/ZetsuTheFirst, who Zetsu used under the /u/Lord_Bill account.)\n* [Chapter Two:](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3so1b3/twitch_trolls_pokemon_part_two_methinks_the/) Bill.exe is trapped on my laptop, and over time actually learns to be a semi-decent human being, or a reasonable facsimile thereof. He is, however, completely clueless as to how to *actually* be human, which is awkward because, thanks to the proddings of my online friends, the character develops a crush on me.\n* [Chapter Three:](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3w3wm1/twitch_trolls_pokemon_part_three_the_bane_of/) Bill.exe gets an enemy in the form of another computer virus named /u/Bane_of_BILLEXE. His efforts to defend himself nearly destroy said enemy, but has a change of heart and, along with friend /u/Gadzooks3, repairs Bane into a virtual [Zigzagoon.](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/File:263Zigzagoon.png)\n\nSo Ziggybane wakes up, having lost his memory of being antagonistic towards Bill.exe, and his tail starts to wag. So hard that it falls off, but being a virtual construct, Ziggybane says he can easily reattach it. \n\nBill.exe mentions under his breath that he hopes that this \"Zigzagoon\" idea doesn't go south, which Ziggybane interprets as that he and Bill.exe are going on a trip south, to Hoenn.\n\nBill.exe runs with it; he thinks it's a great idea. Go to Hoenn, bring the Zigzagoon, bring his crush (me), and have a grand old time, right?\n\nWrong.\n\nYou see, /u/Gioz2, the guy who gave Bill.exe the Very Bad Idea of giving his crush knives as a token of affection (although in fairness, /u/Bytemite actually did think it was a romantic and practical idea),  kept threatening Bill.exe to the point in which Bill.exe started threatening back. Gioz claimed he knew where I lived; Bill.exe claimed that no he didn't, it was a fake IP to a nuclear testing site in Tanzania. Gioz claimed he was sending [Mightyenas](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/File:262Mightyena.png) riding [Talonflames](http://archives.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Category:Talonflame) to my house to pick me up, and by this point, I was IRL getting kind of annoyed at Gioz's tenacity at being obnoxious. (For the record, Gioz himself said OOC he was enjoying being \"the bad guy.\")\n\nBill.exe decided that the smartest thing to do was take me and Ziggybane to Hoenn as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, he made the naive mistake of bragging to Gioz about it, which is something the actual Bill would *never* do. For obvious reasons, because it tips Gioz off as to what's going down, and Gioz (who, from this point forward, shall be known as G to distinguish his RP character from the actual Gioz2) plans to have something *particularly nasty* waiting for us.\n\nThis wasn't the *official* beginning of the inaugural Twitch Trolls Pokemon RP campaign that was later known as 28, but it was definitely the buildup. So while it's not the most epic GameTales story, it's necessary exposition and it has to go somewhere. \n\nTrust me, the next chapter is DEFINITELY better, in which the party learns how *not* to hack a lifeboat motor.",

        "text": "Somewhere in fantasy bullshit portugal, all was not well. It never was, but today, it was extra unwell. You see, three british \"spies\" with the subtlety of James Bond wearing only a PPK had been assigned to sort out some nefarious business having to do with a false king and a coup. Or something. But what it basically equated to was doing asenine sidequests around the portugese countryside. Our \"secret\" \"agents\" consist of Destan the vampiric spider-controlling witch, John Goltz the shitfaced human sorcerer, and Rory the offensively irish gnome bard.\n\nTheir first quest was to investigate why [a batshit crazy preist was up on a soapbox ranting and raving at maximum volume](http://i.imgur.com/1CYagUy.jpg). He was screaming \"UNCLEAN THIS AND HOLY WAR THAT\", almost verbatim, and throwing books at local passersby. upon closer inspection, they turned out to be copies of Don Quixote. But he was having SOME effect, and the main track of his screaming was that goblins were bad and everyone should go out to the nearby encampment and murder them because ***HOLINESS***. The party, who were not terribly religious, were a bit miffed by this.\n\nAfter Destan found himself screaming admonishments into the terrified preacher's face and holding him a solid foot off the ground by the neck of his robe, the party proceeded to tell the preacher that it was generally a bad idea to try to incite race wars and riots. The preacher insisted he had good reason! That being, the goblins had once heard the preacher talking and reflexively knocked him out and gagged him. For [some](http://i.imgur.com/LNG3BP6.png) [reason](http://i.imgur.com/JWkgmeW.png). And that was clearly a justification for genocide, right?\n\nThe party summarily smacked him until he stopped being stupid and delivered him into the care of the local clergymen, who were about as embarrassed as could be by this whole business. But, goblins walking the roads near the town sounded like trouble, so they decided to investigate anyway.\n\nDestan then proceeded to ninja his way into the goblin camp (with the help of his trained spiders), hide in a bush, and witness the leader of the little tribe going about his business. Turned out that, surprise surprise, the [Goblin King](http://i.imgur.com/GSzqniN.jpg) was gearing up for a raid on the pesky humans in order to take the land in the name of the goblin empire! Well, that wasn't entirely unreasonable, as the party may or may not have been there for the same reason. Plus, the king made some good arguments, had a great singing voice, and would you LOOK at that hair. Well, Destan then proceeded to act like a Holy Bush (which was not on fire, but was very on spiders) in order to conduct a reasonable discussion with the good fellow and convince him that maybe sacking a town full of humans wasn't the best idea. But the King had another motivation: the humans had long ago stolen the goblin crown, and he needed it to prove his legitimacy! And, by sheer coincidence, it was being kept in the town cathedral.\n\nThe party had a serious debate about whether or not they should have just set the camp on fire and laughed, but sidequests were sidequests, and they were curious. So they went to the cathedral, grabbed one of the more sane priests, and demanded to know where the hell the \"crown\" was. Turns out, they didn't know. It had been misplaced, and the only lead was in some spooky woods which were teeming with undead. Encouraging.\n\nAnother suggestion of wanton arson was put forward, and unfortunately shot down (the crown might get damaged). So they set off into the spooky wood, and found... guess.\n\nThe motherfucking preacher, performing a spooky ritual, and wearing an ornate headband that matched the description of the goblin king's \"crown\".\n\nDestan tried to work some mind mumbo jumbo on the crazy idiot, but this didn't work, because he had plenty of voices in his head already. So he whirled around, cheerfully greeted Destan after recognizing him from the \"sermon\" earlier. Destan responded by vomitting a butt of venomous spiders into his face. The poor preacher screamed in surprise and pain, fell through a trap door, hit every step on his way down the staircase, covered the entire general area with (non-spidery) vomit. Things were off to a great start.\n\nThe party followed him down into his little homemade dungeon, dodging various puddles of spider guts and half-digested paint chips, then found themselves in a tightly-wound series of corridors. Lovely. John Goltz drunkenly took the lead, meandering down a corridor decorated by a fancy gargoyle on the corner. Which he completely failed to notice was actually a zombie in disguise. It pounced, wrapped its rotting hands around John's neck, and started squeezing.\n\nAs John Goltz flailed and struggled for air, or even release, Destan and Rory started loudly discussing whether they should help, leave, or set the zombie on fire. Several rather pathetic attempts to \"assist\" later, John Goltz was on the verge of losing consciousness and the godsdamned zombie was completely unfazed. So Rory decided to do what he did best, whipped out his fiddle, tuned it, and then smashed it over the zombie's head. It immediately released Goltz and slumped to the ground, seemingly dead.\n\nGoltz rose up, got his breath, and then proceeded to kick the everloving shit out of the unresponsive body until he started hacking up gouts of blood from the exertion. The party then immediately set off, only for the zombie to spasm up in a corona of necromantic energy and start strangling RORY. Destan facepalmed, and Goltz lost his SHIT. He immediately ran screaming down the corridor, leaving the rest of the party behind while they figured out a way to pry zombie fingers off a trachea when the closest thing the party had to a melee fighter was indisposed. Destan fumbled for a more suitable weapon, Rory successfully freed himself, and the zombie immediately went for DESTAN, because everyone had to get in on this action. Rory grabbed up his fiddle, set it on fire, and smashed the strangly zombie until it stopped twitching.\n\nMeanwhile, Goltz was having some fun. While screaming at the top of his lungs like a little girl, he charged past two more statues, both of which whipped out hands to trip him up. But Goltz's adrenaline-soaked brain became spontaneously proficient at parkour, and he leapt and tumbled past the flailing arms without taking a single point of damage. Straight on and into a big old dead end. Filled with zombies. And with another horde behind him. Hm.\n\nWell, Goltz being the sorcerer, he did the reasonable thing and SPAMMED FIREBALL EVERYWHERE. When the rest of the party caught up, he was in a giggling, booze-and-zombie-guts-soaked mess, and was a little scorched. But all in all, that had been extremely cathartic. Rory and his atrocious accent stepped in, healed everyone up, healed the face off a few zombies while he was at it, and then the group proceeded on to a little room with a gargoyle statue in each corner.\n\nHow about NOPE. The party kept back in the entrance hallway, identified the statues as glamers, and attacked the skeletal monstrosity lurking beneath the one on the far side of the room. With grenades. Lots of grenades. The monster roared in pain, shambled forward, had its femur shattered by some well-placed magic from Destan, and was then killed when Rory threw his fiddle at it. The fiddle that was, by the way, STILL ON FIRE. That done, he confidently strode into the room... past the OTHER two statues which the party HADN'T checked.\n\nTo no one's great surprise, the nutty preacher was crouching behind that one and pounced on Rory, slapping him with a curse that reduced his constitution. The party won initiative, charged in, smacked him a little, and then used a blast of wind to nail him to the ceiling. The preacher flashed into invisibility, so Destan webbed up the exits. And then John Goltz casted Glitterdust. Seeing as every single party member was still in range, the action was met with... [disapproval](http://i.imgur.com/kLrTiDG.jpg). But damn if it wasn't effective! Destan sicced his spiders onto the preacher while Rory swore viciously and assaulted the walls. The preacher once again failed his save versus nausea, and with his last act of defiance, vomited on every party member in range before being beaten unconscious.\n\nSo, there they were, three dipshits with strangle marks on their necks, burns on everything, covered with glitter, vomit, and spider guts, beating the shit out a crazy preacher using mace handles, boots, and the goddamn fiddle which was STILL ON FIRE. Once the idiot preacher stopped struggling, they looted him, grabbed the stolen goblin crown, tied him up, and sent their bosses an angry note demanding a vacation and a pay raise.",

Our Druid disguised himself as a member and attempted to get information out while the rest of us waited outside.       \n       \nHe was doing fine until they offered him a drink that turned out to be half potion of ravenous hunger (DM made it up) and half human blood. He failed the will save and became mad with cannibalistic urges.

        "text": "So, I recently posted about how I am a horrible roller with bosses, and it happened yet again. One session after the dragon incident, the party found themselves in yet another boss battle, this time with a giant mummified priest/wizard. How this thing was mummified, I don't know, I just made it up so that it would actually challenge them. Either way, they still fought this pseudo boss. \n\nThe monk had recently managed to give himself a concussion, and had temporary brain damage, so he sat this one out, so no, monk fans, he won't be the subject of today's miracle.\n\nI've spent a long time describing the monk's player, but not really any of the others in the party. We had some shuffling, and a new set of characters arose under the same members of the real world group. The focus of this tale is the two toughest characters to manage: the monk and the wizard. They will both read this so I will leave my rant about them off the page (mwahaha! now you will wonder what I would have said!) and suffice it to say that both are rule-lawyers and power players. The initial round had the barbarian of the group getting paralyzed with fear, the rogue getting knocked out and the ranger missing every shot. The wizard and cleric had decided to fly high up and cast spells, except that the mummy was immune to their spells. So the wizard casts prismatic wall, trapping the mummy on one half of the room. As the party regroups, the actually player turns to me with an evil grin and asks \"What is this guy immune to, as an undead?\" I was suddenly a bit worried, this mummy was supposed to be a tough battle, but knowing this wizard, he'd have some overpowered super spell delved from some obscure expansion text that was only produced in Ghana and had to be translated to English for the internet version he found on DnDINTENZMODE.com or some other shit. I gave him the sheet that listed the Undead traits and sat there. His grin grew bigger. \"I Cast Baleful Polymorph to turn it into a badger!\". Everyone looked up. As usual, half of them were only paying attention because of his tone (don't even get me started on the phone/computer problem. I've tried.). The player of the Cleric says, \"remember last time this happened?\" and winked at me. I told him to shut up. In time honored tradition, I rolled the die of fate in the open, to let them see the doom of their party. And just as traditionally, I roll a 1. \n\nAfter a gratuitous amount of stabbing (200 coup de graces in total) the badger that formally was a badass party-wrecking boss is now a small pile of gore at the wizard's feet. They were ecstatic. I, on the other hand sat in my chair, a dejected person, cursing my bum luck over and over in my head: \"FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK WHY THE FUCK?! HOW THE FUCK. GODAMN EVERY FUCKING TIME!\" Out loud I said: \"Well fuck me.\" ",

        "text": "[Previous entry](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/41sy0n/call_of_cthulhu_a_player_of_mine_wrote_up_an/)\n\nFrom the Journals of Rufus Sweineke, 1893\n\nI am not mad. I feel so long as I can write these words I can force my mind into order. I am not mad. I am not mad.\n\nI have read over my previous entry, and can hardly recall the moment of writing. It is as if an epistolaric spirit had descended upon me in sleep, compelling the hand to write. My memory remains, as yet, untainted, and I feel compelled - perhaps by that selfsame spirit - to chronicle the events as I understand them.\n\nI am not mad.\n\nIt was in July of 1893, several months after my dreadful adventures in Garreth's Landing that I was introduced to Dr Milton Roland, an anthropologist and a friend of Miss Clarke and Miss Wong.  \n\t\nIn the weeks during and after our mutual ordeal, I had come to know and depend on the ladies.  There was no one else in my admittedly small social circle who could believe half of the fantastic things that the three of us had experienced.  \n\t\nOnly George Hall, who's disappearance had sparked the series of dreadful event, might have been any consolation to me.  As it was, Hall had no family, no known next-of-kin, so it was left to myself to put his affairs in order.  It seemed impossible that he had survived the ritual that we found remains of in his basement.  After his debts were settled, there remained his house, his books, and a small amount of money that I took possession of.  Indeed, I was grateful to have inherited my friend's incomes, for truth be told, the book shop was not doing at all well.  I found I could no longer bear the sight of newsprint, and refused to carry any.  Business, as you might imagine, began to decline.\n\t\nSo it was that I spent quite a deal of my time at the Occult Books Store of Detroit, of which Miss Clarke seemed to have wholly taken over the operation.  It was there that I met Dr Roland.  The Doctor was a stout, bluff fellow with a scholarly, yet excite able demeanor.  He had spent most of the last six months on an expedition into the northern part of the state, in search of answers after his own encounter with the outlandish and bizarre.  He was gravely disappointed to have discovered nothing, and even more so to hear that he had not been present to lend his aid at Garreth's Landing.  However, he showed a keen interest in the artifacts we had recovered.  I still retained possession of the strange documents written by George Hall and Guy Manson, a pair of indecipherable texts in what was to all appearances an alien language.  I had tried at first to follow in Hall's footsteps and pry open the mystery of his last work, but I fear it had defeated me.  Dr Roland was certain he could do better.  I offered him all the assistance that I could, and the two of us busied ourselves in the slow, scholarly work of decoding the strange messages.\n\t\nIt was at about this same time that a certain Mr O'Patrick began to frequent the Occult Book Store.  I would run into him on my visits, as Dr Roland and I kept the ladies appraised of our progress.  I hardly spoke to him at the time.  He seemed to be a sort of mystic, though I suspected at the time he was mostly a fraud.  Why else would he have worn such a ridiculous hat?  Miss Clarke had heard of him before, and he had quite a reputation with the local Occult Society.  Upon questioning Miss Clarke about him, I gathered that he had seen photographs of the thing that we slew in Garreth's Landing.  Inevitably, the strange creature was making its rounds through all the modern occult magazines, and had been picked up as something of a sideshow attraction.  I had avoided much mention of it (not reading newspapers helped) but I had heard it being sold as the “Star Flier” or the “Devil Kite”.  O'Patrick had somehow traced the increasingly wild stories of its origin back to us, and was under the deranged impression that he “wanted in” on whatever occult knowledge we possessed.  Despite our sincere protests that such knowledge could not be healthy, he persisted.\n\t\nIt was late July, after several days of frustration, that Dr Roland had his breakthrough.  He had succeeded in translating the first page of Guy Manson's journal.  As far as he could tell, it seemed to describe a “Ritual of Clarity” which would imbue an object with the “Power of Clarity”.  The Doctor was eager to attempt the spell, but Miss Clarke, Miss Wong, and myself advised caution.  We finally agreed that we could perhaps test the safety of the spell by encouraging Mr O'Patrick (who still wouldn't go away) to attempt it.  We reasoned that the man would be pleased by our inviting him to participate in our investigation, and that if the worst were to happen, we might at least be altogether rid of him.  That particular evening, however, was destined to be a long and eventful one.\n\t\nMiss Clarke, thinking to make use of O'Patrick herself, had convinced him to host a book-signing at the Occult Book Store.  A number of volumes of his book, “The Shadows of Fear (and the Lights which Banish Them)” had been ordered, and it seemed the entire Occult Society of Detroit had come out for the event.  I had never seen the store so busy.  Dr Roland and I waited near the back of a long line, watching as Mr O'Patrick gregariously signed and sold his book.  \n\t\nAfter a quarter hour or so, I noticed an unusual figure amongst the crowd. Though the varied members of the Occult Society could hardly be considered normal, this man seemed to exude a nearly palpable aura of wrongness and menace.  He was pale and unkempt, wrapped in a tattered jacket, and had a sort of dull, unseeing gleam in his eyes.  He had come in towards the back of the line, but was quickly making his way to the front as other patrons shuffled out of his way, unnerved by his nearness and his awkward intensity.  The man hardly seemed to notice the effect he was having.  He merely shuffled forward until he was face to face with O'Patrick.\n\t\nThe Irish mystic greeted the man with his usual hearty jocularity, and reached out to take the book to sign.  At that moment, the sallow man dropped the book, and drew a long and wicked looking dagger from his coat!  Instantly, chaos erupted.  Miss Wong, having grown increasingly high-strung in the last months, immediately drew her pistol and began firing on O'Patrick's attacker. I could have sworn that several shots connected, but they barely seemed to phase the strange man.  I did my best to clear the innocent bystanders from harms way, and by the time the store was empty of patrons, my comrades were well on their way to subduing our assailant.  Miss Wong's shots had disarmed the villain, after which O'Patrick had grappled him, and now pinned him awkwardly.  As the man struggled, he began to babble, but in no language that any among us had ever heard uttered by human tongue.  Yet, even as Miss Clarke proceeded to club him into unconsciousness with a large dictionary, Dr Roland and I exchanged knowing glances.  This man had spoken in the very language we had spent the last weeks decoding!\n\t\nWe knew that we had scant minutes until the police arrived.  Dr Roland retrieved the weapon, as O'Patrick at the ladies searched and hog-tied the strange man.  The dagger was unusual in a number of ways.  It was long and wavy double-edged blade, made from bronze.  Along its length were stamped or carved a number of foreign markings all too familiar to us.  We could now hardly doubt that this man was connected somehow with the journals of George Hall and Guy Manson. A search of his person divulged nothing further of interest, until one of his shoes came loose.  They were poorly fitted, and the toes were stuffed with newspapers.  To my horror, the crumpled documents were moths-old copies of the Great Lakes Times, the publication which had led to all my current troubles.  It was with trepidation that we handed the felon over to the constable.  I think we all feared that there might be more that natural agencies that might come to his aid. \n\t\nOf course we now had no choice but to bring O'Patrick fully into our miserable company.  He seemed undaunted by our stories, eager even to be a part of what he saw as a great adventure.  Though we doubted his buoyancy would last, it at least meant that he would quite willingly undergo the Ritual of Clarity.  \n\t\nNone of us wanting the magic to be cast near to our own homes, we decided that we would use George Hall's basement as the site for our experiment.  While Miss Wong kept watch upstairs, Dr Roland walked O'Patrick through the steps that he had gleaned from Manson's journal.  The mystic seemed to take it all very well, and assured us that it was very similar to rituals he had performed in the past.  A web of chalk lines were drawn on the floor, candles were lit, and a pair of eye-glasses were produced to be the focus of the ritual.  O'Patrick slit his palm with a pen-knife, and intoned the words of the alien tongue that Dr Roland had taught to him.  He seemed somewhat shaken afterward, but no immediate effect was apparent, until the Doctor handed him Manson's journal. \n\t\nWith the eye-glasses, O'Patrick claimed to be able to read the alien scrawl as clear as plain English!  Indeed, when Dr Roland and I took our turns to peer through the enchanted lenses, we found that what had been obscure was now perfectly clear!  The Ritual was a success.  Caught up by Dr Roland's enthusiasm, we created several more Lenses of Clarity, and set to work with vigor to decipher the rest of Manson's journal, and Hall's notes as well.\n\t\nThese last I took upon myself.  Now, finally, I was able to discover more of the fate of my lost friend.  Hall's notes told of a journey past the edge of sanity.  He describes his early curiosity with the irregularities of the Great Lakes Times, a newspaper whose contents shifted and altered with successive readings.  He became convinced that there was a code embedded within the shifting of the words, hinging around those few words which remained steady and unchanging. As Hall's obsession grew more frantic, his notes grew more erratic.  Though the language remained recognizable through the Lens of Clarity, the nature of the notes began to grow strange.  Hall would write in spirals, or leave strange blank spaces, compose his lines on odd angles.  As the night wore on, the reading became increasingly difficult.  As we compared notes, Dr Roland told me that Manson's journal followed a similar trend, though rather than the newspapers—which so far as we knew, Manson had created himself—Manson thought he was following a code in a book entitled “The Vagueries of the Universe”, which had been named to me before.  It was a title that filled my companions with dread, for they had encountered it before, and claimed to have destroyed one such book.  It was their greatest fear that other copies existed.\n\t\t\nAs the morning dawned, we at last called a close to our studies.  Dr Roland and I agreed that we would continue the work, and attempt to glean at the very least if there was any further danger. I began to suspect that the good doctor was far less terrified of these events than Miss Clarke and Miss Wong.  He treated the whole affair as a mater of scholarship, taking the bizarre circumstances on the chin.  Indeed, he expressed an intent to publish a piece, or series of pieces on the matter once we had come to understand how this “unorthodox mythology had sprung up out of no-where” as he put it.\n\t\nOne further event marred the morning, however.  As Dr Roland and I engrosed ourselves in study, Miss Wong and Mr O'Patrick had gone to the police station to see what had become of our unwelcome visitor.  They returned quite shaken.  O'Patrick described looking at the strange man through the glasses he had enchanted.  He raved that there was a “fold or hollow” inside the man, and that someone, or something, sat inside him, wearing the fellow like a mask!  Dr Roland resolved to look into the matter himself the next day.\n\t\n\nAfter a fitful sleep of some few hours, I began my research again.  In between the growing madness that seemed apparent in Hall's notes were passages of lucidity.  These entries eventually ceased to take the form of journals, and rather seemed to be letters or missives to a certain person, though no name is ever given.  Towards the end of the notes, he began to write frantically of a symbol which I recognized as the inter-woven bird's nest shape that I had seen made into a charm by his bed, and twice repeated on walls at the sites of terrifying rituals I had done my best to forget.  As I reached the end of my friend's last testament, and finished my transcription, I felt that I was on the verge of a terrible understanding.  However, I had also uncovered another piece of the puzzle.  At the very last, he wrote frequently of “Mushkeeki”, which I slowly realized to be a name, quite possibly a place.  \n\t\n\nI went to discover my findings to Dr Roland and the ladies, but when I arrived at the Occult Book Store, it was to find the good doctor nearly catatonic.  He sat wrapped in blanket mumbling as Miss Clarke prepared one of her special calming drinks for him.  From Miss Wong I gathered that Dr Roland had attempted to speak to the prisoner in the alien language.  She said the man had responded, staring at Dr Roland and pressing himself against the bars, at which point Dr Roland had collapsed, and she had been obliged to carry him from the station.  The doctor, having regained his nerves at this point, added that he had seen the same emptiness in the man that O'Patrick had described earlier, but that when he spoke in the alien tongue, a terrible darkness had filled that emptiness, and looked out at him through the prisoners eyes!  He speculated that there was little left of the human that that man had once been, if indeed he had ever been anything but a puppet for whatever dark force lurked inside him.\n\t\n\nOn that unhappy note, I delivered my own news.  Dr Roland soon regained his excitement, for he too had found reference to Mushkeeki, in Manson's journal.  However, as I handed him my notes, he looked at me askance.  When I asked him what was wrong, he gently asked that I remove my spectacles.  Then I looked at my work with horror!  Without the Lens of Clarity before my eye, my own notes were indistinguishable from Hall's!  Somehow without realizing, I had begun to write in that unearthly language.  I felt sick to my stomach.\n\t\nBut the Doctor had his wind back now, and was determined to continue forward.  With some research (and asking at the post-office) we discovered Mushkiki to be a tiny town on the north-east coast of the state, not far in fact from where Dr Roland had but lately finished his last fruitless dig.  He was eager to depart at once, and the rest of us began a feverish preparation.\n\t\nAs a precaution before journeying into the unknown, Dr Roland spent some time consulting the *Grimoir of Pope Honorious*, a spell book that he claimed had helped him in the past.  In the mean time, Miss Clarke conducted some research on Mushkiki, and I steeled myself to take a glimpse at the horrible prisoner.  When I arrived at the station, the receptionist informed me that the man had been determined insane, and would soon be removed to a facility that would attempt to care for him.  I told her I wished them the best of luck, and then dared my peek.  \n\nI can hardly describe the strangeness of this man better than Mr O'Patrick and Dr Roland already had.  Through the Lens of Clarity, I could see a sort of indistinct space within him, an emptiness that other people did not have.  Whatever abominable force Dr Roland's speech to him had awakened earlier, the man seemed once again quiescent.  Indeed, he had the look of one totally without motivation, a dumb brute who seemed totally unaware of my presence.  I could not bring myself to utter any of those horrid words which might garner its attention, and so left to prepare myself for what I felt certain would be another terrible ordeal.\n\t\nThe next day we boarded an early train bound for northern Michigan. As usual, Miss Clarke and Miss Wong seemed eminently prepared, bringing equipment for first aid and exploration, as well as a rather shocking amount of ammunition for Miss Wong's ever-present revolvers.  Dr Roland brought with him an ornate saber, which he claimed to have spent the evening invoking a sort of blessing over, one of the spells from Annorious' spell book.  I myself had come equipped with my own firearm, matches, brandy,  and the various documents that we had acquired, including my own horrifying notes.  Only Mr O'Patrick seemed ready for less than battle, and he carried himself with the air of man going on holiday!\n\t\nAs we whiled our way north, Miss Clarke offered more elucidation on our destination.  Mushkiki had been part of land purchased from the indians, and settled within the last fifty years.  It was set in a particularly primeval wilderness, an area that the ancient tribes had left untended.  The name, Mushkiki, was a derivation of the indian word for Medicine, or Magic, but even that had apparently been corrupted.  The old name was \"Mudjimushkeeki\", which meant Bad Medicine, or Black Magic.  I shuddered and tried my best to steel myself for what was to lie ahead. \n\t\nIt was mid-day when we first beheld Mushkeeki, after a miserable motor-car ride from the train station which left us at the top of a ridge, half a mile yet from the little waterside town.  As we made our way down to the main street, I was struck by the similarity to Garreth's Landing.  A few houses, a general store, a church, a post-office, and little more was there.  The greatest incongruity was the two-story building which reared above the rest.  Though small compared to other such edifices, the Mushkiki Library dominated the landscape of the sleepy village.\n\t\n  Indeed, it seemed more that merely sleepy.  As we walked cautiously down the road, not a soul was to be seen.  Where were the townsfolk?  The post-office door stood ajar, the mail desk was empty and unmanned. When Miss Clarke opened their record book, we beheld with dismay a writhing mass of words, clearly infected by the terrible linguistic plague spread the Vagueries of the Universe.  Such an ill omen should have been enough to send us all fleeing.  If the corruption had engulfed the entire town, what could we five do against it?  But we foolishly pressed on, calling out for anyone that might still be around.  I prayed that they had all fled.\n\t\nWe found the first townsfolk in the church.  They sat motionless and unresponsive in the pews, and betrayed no hint that they were sensible of our presence.  Through the Lens of Clarity, we could clearly see that they were hollowed out, just as our assailant back in Detroit had been.  With great caution, Dr Roland drew out the sword that he had worked Pope Annorious' enchantment on, and gently tapped one of the motionless forms.  The result was instantaneous.  Whatever fold or hollow was within the man collapsed.  He blinked and looked at us with the true and human emotion of puzzlement written plainly across his features.\n\t\nBut at the same moment, horrible shadows erupted within the others!  In disturbing unison, they turned and fixed their gaze upon us.  Wearing the Lens of Clarity, I saw all too well the nature of the thing that dwelt inside each of them.  It was all one, a vast shadowy entity, that formed to my eyes and distraught mind like a coiling of shadows, each hollowed victim but an outlet for this horrible and noxious being to emerge from, a tool that it grasped in its manifold and sinuous arms.  It was all too much for me, and I fled from consciousness.\n\t\nI was awakened some moments later on the cold stone of a cellar floor.  Flickering lantern light revealed my companions standing nervously about the cramped space.  Miss Wong was grimly re-loading her pistol, and there was blood on the blade of Dr Roland's sword.  A black woman I did not recognize was doing her best to answer their frantic questions.  Somewhere overhead, I heard a repeated thudding noise.  Miss Clarke quietly informed me of the situation.  We had been mobbed outside of the church.  Hollowed townsfolk had appeared from a number of buildings and attempted to waylay us.  The touch of Dr Roland's sword seemed to free them, but there were too many to hold off.  They were saved by this woman, whose name was Juliet.  She claimed to have been hiding in the cellar of this house for over a week.  The sound of gunshots had brought her above ground, and seeing us, she had made the decision to lend her aid.  She seemed now to be regretting her decision.  The unrelenting sounds above us were a band of a dozen or so townsfolk trying to batter down the door.\n\t\nSlowly, we worked together a plan.  Dr Roland and Mr O'Patrick could both perform the spell to bless objects with Annorious' enchantment.  After some consideration, we chose a broom-stick and a pound of salt.  Thus armed, we decided to divide our efforts.  While Dr. Roland, Miss Wong, and Juliet held the house and the attention of the horde, O'Patrick, Miss Clarke and myself would make for the Library.  O'Patrick would take the broom-stick, and we divided the salt between us.  As we made our way out the back door, I wished my friends luck.  I feared I would never see them alive again.\n\t\nThe three of us slipped unnoticed through the falling dusk towards the library.  The plan seemed to be working.  More and more of the Hollowed moved woodenly towards the sound of Miss Wong's gunfire.  The thought struck me that beneath these controlling masks of evil, innocent people might be dying.  I tried to put the thought from myself, and focus on the task at hand.  The library door was unlocked.  Within, it was totally dark.  We carefully lit our lanterns and began our exploration.  Miss Clarke made her way to the main office, where she hoped to find some unstained record of the *Vagueries*, and I made my way among the shelves.  Every book I turned to was full of the slithery corruption of the *Vagueries*, and it took all my willpower to continue.  What we would do once we found the book was beyond me, even if it was here.  Miss Clarke and Miss Wong had told me of the extraordinary lengths they had been obliged to go to rid themselves of the last copy to cross their path.  \n\t\nAs I neared the back of the library, I caught a glimpse of another light.  At first I thought was Miss Clarke or Mr O'Patrick, but it was not the wavering illumination of a lamp-flame.  It came flickering up from a flight of stairs leading down into a basement or cellar at the back of the library.  I was filled with a dread certainty what we would find down there, and rushed back to collect Mr O'Patrick and Miss Clarke.  As O'Patrick and I entered the office, though, we saw rising up from the gloom a horrible shadow that reached out towards Miss Clarke!  O'Patrick lunged at it with the broom-stick, but the shifting shadows were further away than they appeared.  In a panic I fired off a wild shot from my revolver, but either the bullet went wide or had no affect on the ethereal creature.  Miss Clarke quickly ran from the room, as O'Patrick fearlessly squared himself to face the thing.  \n\t\nThis time as the dark and insubstantial claws reached out, O'Patrick brought his blessed weapon straight through the heart of them.  The darkness rent and tore beneath his blow, only to reform, now into two smaller vortexes of writhing shadow!  I called out to O'Patrick to join us outside.  As he cleared the door with the shadows at his heals, I flung down a handful of blessed salt across the threshold.  To my relief, the demons were arrested by this barrier, though I could see that it would not hold them for long.  With mounting fear, we made our way back to the basement.\n\t\nIn the fell and flickering light, we beheld a sight I had hoped never to see again.  Across the wall of the basement were spread a multitude of pages torn from books, plastered to the walls in  a form that coincided perfectly to the symbol from Hall's notes.  The same symbol had decorated his own basement in tattered newsprint, and had likewise adorned the home of Guy Manson in Garreth's Landing.  From a small heavy desk, four lanterns cast haunting parabolic shadows across the surface of the symbol, and standing before the desk was a man, Hollowed like the others, filled with the Dark Presence, working steadily away at an open panel of the desk.  He seemed to take no notice of us.  O'Patrick thrust at him with the broom-handle, and just like the others, the presence left him.  But no sooner had it done so, but a horrible pressure filled the room.  Shadows cast from no clear source crawled across the walls until they converged before us, rose before us in a figure almost like a man, but composed entirely of whirling appendages of darkness.  It seemed to suck light from the very air, dimming the flicker of the lamps and our own lanterns till it was almost invisible in the pitch blackness of that chamber of terror. It's malevolence hove against my mind, and I must admit that I ran screaming from the building, unconscious of anything but the preservation of my self and my last shreds of sanity. \n\t\nSome moments later I found myself wandering through an unfamiliar town.  For a moment I thought I had somehow been transported back to Garreth's Landing!  In one hand I clutched my revolver, in the other I held a bag of salt.  People stood around me in the dark, but they were strangely still and silent.  Suddenly I was hailed by Miss Wong.\n\t\nMemory came crashing back upon me.  The horde of the Hollowed seemed to have given up their assault on Juliet's home, but the price had been high.  Dr Roland was bleeding from a terrible wound in his side, and Miss Wong was running perilously low on ammunition.  I tried not to look at the bodies that lay scattered about.  But the seige had lifted.  Whatever power had impelled these people to attack seemed to have left them.  It was with a sudden dreadful chill that I recalled what peril I had left O'Patrick and Miss Clarke in.\n\t\nWe hurried back to the Library, which seemed to be practically vibrating with power.  As we rushed to the basement steps, Miss Clarke, hauling an unconcious Irishman in one arm, beating off horrible tendrils of darkness with the broom-handle in the other, emerged.  With Dr Roland's sword and the remained of the salt, we beat back the questing tentacles, and sealed both the stairway and the door of the library. \n\t\nThough she seemed near exhaustion from her heroic exertions, Miss Clarke declared that she knew where the book could be found.  Her search of the office had not been in vain, and in a nook up on the second floor, we found at last the dreaded book, the *Vagueries of the Universe.*\n\t\nAs Miss Clarke frantically opened the dread tome, in hopes of finding some way of halting the monsters around us, Dr Roland called up to inform us that more and more of the Hollowed were gathering at the door.  The salt held them at bay, but we were hopelessly trapped.  I tore at the pages of the book, but to my astonishment they simply grew back, folding out of the pages that remained.\n\t\nIn frustration, O'Patrick struck the book with the enchanted broom handle.\n\t\nThe Vagueries of the Universe... rippled.\n\t\nIt was as if it were somehow disrupted from reality for a moment.  Heartened, O'Patrick struck again and again, with the same results.  As he did, inspiration struck me.  I grabbed up the book and shouted for Dr Roland to strike it with his sword.  The blade clove through the pages with ease.  They fluttered to the floor, now blank... and did not regrow.\n\t\nWith gusto, Dr Roland and I set about destroying the accursed book.  As the last pages were shredded away, there was a brightening.  The Library had ceased its hum of unearthly power.  Light flickered once more from the basement stairs... and the townspeople outside staggered about in bewildered shock.\n\t\nThough I knew what to expect as we once more essayed the basement room, I was no less staggered.  The four lamps were electrical, but their wires ran only inside of the desk, to an iron box that still seemed to hum and radiate power.  Intent on understanding this strangeness, Dr Roland ordered the vessel prised open.  With some of the tools scattered about by the man who had been working there, Miss Wong succeeded in opening the box.  It seemed to contain nothing but blinding blue light that grated harshly on the eyes.  When O'Patrick cast a handful of the blessed salt into it, it seethed and bubbled dangerously.  We could make nothing of it.  At last confounded, Dr Roland inscribed Pope Annorious' Sigil of Sealing into the box, and wedged it shut once more.  To our astonishment, the iron weld re-sealed itself, and the humming power of the box went silent.\n\t\nWe had survived.  Battered and nearly broken, but we had survived once more.  As we picked through other remains, we found more writings, a stack of notebooks all inscribed in the Alien Tongue.  These Dr Roland and I carried out, hoping they might contain more answers, that they might lead us to some means of utterly ending this threat.  All the other books of the library were deeply corrupted by the Vagueries' ill, and we decided that it was best if the whole place were destroyed.  Like Manson's shack before, we left the Mushkiki Library in a pillar of flame, the iron box hopefully destroyed in the inferno, or at least buried beneath the rubble.\n\t\nThe townsfolk were still catatonic.  There was little we could do for them except make the long walk back to the train station, and inform the authorities.  Juliet came with us, unwilling to stay a moment longer in the town that had been so long her prison.  It was a long a difficult walk, but at last we made our way back to a vestige of civilization, and were soon resting exhaustedly on our way south and home.\n\t\nSince then I have delved into the research of the texts we recovered, assisting Dr Roland however I can.  I find that I am now driven to understand these horrors, though in terrible, fearful moments in the night, I fear that I am but walking the same path that others have walked before me.  Guy Manson, George Hall, the nameless man we found in the basement at Mushkiki, am I to become like them?\n\t\nI pore over George's notes endlessly.  There has to be a key, a code, something that I can crack to end this horror, to preserve the sanity of mankind!  Miss Clarke has divulged to me some of what she read in the Vagueries before it was destroyed.  There were proofs in that book, unrelentingly mathematical proofs that we are nothing before the Great Abyss that lies beyond.   All our history is but the blink of an eye for the Watchers in the Deep, and for all that we scramble for their attention, one fraction of their notice would doom us all to unrelenting creeping madness.\n\t\nI am not mad.  These events are real as I write them.  We few stand at a brink, and must persevere for all the others who do not know, who cannot know.  I am not mad! ",

        "text": "So it has been quite a while since my last tale, we had a stupid month-long hiatus from gameplay completely unintentionally. And after the bothersome break we decided not to proceed playing like 4 campaigns at once so we ultimately decided on what we call the explorer campaign, what I have referred to as the bumblefuck group. But swapping campaigns doesn’t stop the group from breaking it [as we have seen in the past.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3sa7qb/efficient_adventuring_dd5e/) \n\nSo here we go, for my roughly thirty or forty fans here is how the party wrecked a boss by pushing it somewhere else. For this the party is mostly the same: Kiki the drow rogue who can’t speak, Verlan the human wizard who thinks everyone is stupid and Django the ranger who is starting an adventuring franchise. Due to the aforementioned franchise they have a slew of npc allies making missions a mess to manage including two clerics two rogues and two fighters that accompany them into the area they are about to go in. The break here was totally my fault as the dm for giving them a wizards tower powered by an op macguffin that lets it cast any 9th level spells available to its past owner, a 20th level wizard named Maximillian who died of the Nothic curse (see monster manual). Maxie was a conjuration wizard and specialized in demiplanes and interplaner travel and storage. \n\n**Background:** The arc was winding to an end, the party was mugged of their belongings by some gang that no one likes to talk about and have been pursuing them ever since, slowly discovering that they are based because of a cult that lives in a mountain near town and eventually becomes responsible for earthquakes and fires the plague the city. The players based in their wizard tower are informed by its undead Jarvis, Maxie that some bad shit is going down on that mountain tonight. They use the tower’s time slowing room to get 8 hours rest in a single hour at the expense of any of the tower’s other functionalities and head off on foot to the mountain. They discover some secret passages, kill some kobolds and cultists, scare some other kobolds, give a horse a knife to defend itself, sidestep a wyvern and other dungeon antics before coming upon the room where the cult’s big old ritual was happening. The wizard summons a shield guardian he happened to have, the drow throws down a figurine of wonderous power that conveniently has an activation word that needs to be thought rather than said, bypassing her inability to speak. And they have their party of eight and a shield guardian and a griffon assaulting cultists, the weakest npc hodor the rogue nearly gets killed by kobolds before being saved by the pocket healer and the party nearly stops the ritual from happening.\n\nNearly.\n\nBut alas some really bs concentration rolls on the part of the cultists have them succeed in the ritual and summoning their god, back.\n\n\n**Encounter:** The being that emerges from the well the ritual was held around was known to be called Red-Eye by his followers but only now did the party see him in his true, not so majestic form. An Adult Red Dragon, just turned Dracolich. Upon seeing it Kiki takes her griffon and her lover, Lauren the cleric and book shit out of the dungeon followed by those of the party that did make it away from the dragon. Excepted by a rogue named Sheala who died at its claws. Direction was some tough decisions as they had to pick between the wyvern room or a narrow, fire-leading hallway but ultimately everyone made it out in once piece. They all grabbed horses and started running back to the tower, followed by the Dracolich who just exploded out of the mountaintop. A magic earring forward called Maxie at the tower and he asked for something unique to find them by, it led to a funny scramble to give anything in particular to different party members before they were teleported horse by horse back to the tower and left to plan.\n\nThe tower put up a prismatic wall to give them time as the dracolich flew in the direction of the tower. Then the party had to find a way to be rid of this monstrosity that could tpk in a single move (keep in mind the party was lv 4). After much deliberation they brought up Max’s ability with making and destroying artificial rooms behind doors. He had once told them he could void any room in or around the tower into a plane of their choice and they had a game plan. They needed a REALLY big door. Max lowered the prismatic wall and conjured a 60ft door outside the tower along with a matching room, one end linked to the door and the other to a door inside the tower. They used Kiki with a potion of swiftness as bait. She lured the Dracolich in and ran like all hells. She avoided enough fire breath to only be knocked out and the room was sealed magically before ejecting its contents into the positive energy plane which is much akin to the heart of a star. The party assumes that it was incinerated instantly. \n\nThat is how the party got from lv 4 to 7 after a single encounter and skipped an impossible boss fight. They then found out their “dead\" rogue friend miraculously survived and fled to the underdark, thus we begin playing the “Out of the Abyss” module which has spawned some fun tales on its own. I will be telling one of those next, maybe two if it is asked for. \n\ntl;dr – Not all wizard towers are created equal, never underestimate the power of conjuration and Dracoliches probably burn very nicely in radiance.\n",

The trap not only blinds, but also deafens him, leading to him staggering through the hidden door he had just opened. Like Inspector Jacques Clouseau of Pink Panther fame, he Macgyvers his way through a series of small traps, but still manages to stumble into an inconveniently placed teleport circle. This circle teleports him around the map, separating him from the party, and leaving this clueless monk in a very bad place. As the party members conclude their combat, the monk's solo adventure begins.\nHe does a 180, looks around and walks up to a door, deciding he's going to go inside. I look at him funny, he looks back at me, uncomprehending. I say something along the lines of \"this door is wrought iron and covered in dragons, you can't hear anything inside but the deep breathing of something big\". He is unfazed, and insists that he will open the door. At this point the whole party is paying attention, and more than a few are saying \"don't go in there\". \nRather than heed the obvious warnings, he enters the large room. Inside is an old blue dragon, which instantly awakens when he enters, at the same time a trap triggers, locking him into the room. He panics, shouting \"OH GOD NO!\" as I stare at him and calmly ask for initiative. After a short and desperate scramble around the room, with the dragon doing its best to crush him, he's finally pinned in a corner. As a desperate last ditch effort, he uses quivering palm. \n*Side note: quivering palm is a once a week 15th level monk move that insta-kills anything that fails a fortitude check\nNow, this an old blue dragon, and it can't fail this check. It literally has a fort mod bigger than the DC. Naturally, with everyone's eyes on me, I decide to be flamboyant and roll the die outside of my screen, so that they could all see the impending doom of the monk. Just as naturally, I roll a 1. The dragon crumbles, with the simplest of punches the monk has just knocked off a boss with so much armor, hit dice and damage that he could not have survived a few rounds, let alone a prolonged combat. \n\nI face palmed and sat while the shock wore off and they celebrated. I concluded the combat in the best way I knew how:\n\"fuck...\"",

Never mind that this now causes the party to have to hide the fact that Bob the Guard is still okay. (Patrols around the warehouse check in on him.)\n\nSo the party Wizard instructs the party to go searching and he'll deal with the problem. Using a mix of cantrips, telekinesis magic, and simple illusions the wizard 'puppets' Guard Bob around his office and answers passing guards who come by. \n\nThe wizard's skills to bluff are not all that great and \"Bob\" is moving around like a Gary Anderson puppet and his voice movements are off like a bad Chinese dub. \n\nThe guards call in their support and captain who walks up and checks in on \"Bob\". The wizard still trying his best to win over the Captain that everything is okay rolls a wonderful 10. The captain rolls a 1. See the Captain telling Bob to get more sleep and then cuffing the other guards for starting a false alarm. By then one of the other guards notices the wizard can calls out. \n\nThe wizard says \"Screw this\" and tosses Bob at the guards and drops a Obscuring Mist. He exits through the building as the party stumbles out themselves and run on.\n\nOh did they find the proof they needed? Not quite, but they did find a clue to a hidden cottage the Duke had out of town. Oh well.",

        "text": "Me and my younger brother (I was 18, he was 17) were at a convention late last year, Con on the Cob. (http://cononthecob.com/ if you're curious, RPG convention.)\nThey were running a sort of open table with a large, many-sided war going on, where you could jump in and play a little to contribute and learn their favorite wargame, Kings of War. Pretty simple game.\nMy brother is a very smart and tactically minded person, the type you have nightmares about how bad he beat you at chess smart. We love the idea of wargames, but have tight wallets, so when we saw the open table... We couldn't resist.\nHe walked up and we talked to them a little, and he was offered to play a pitched battle of Lizardmen versus Dwarves. The battle was to delay the Dwarf march to the final castle battle in the middle of the table. He was quite outmatched and they expected a quick loss and weren't sure if he was ready to be crushed his first time. He got a look in his eye that I know well, and said he wanted in.\nAs background, in this game, the Lizardmen are sort of reliant on their carapace as defence, with most other stats being poor, while the Dwarves are hardy with fantastic morale, though usually less numerous.\nNot this time, though, the tougher Dwarves far outnumbered the Lizardmen. The only possible advantage they had was a little hill they were sitting on, granting some defense.\nThe early game went surprisingly bad for the Dwarves as the cocky veteran gamer blindly charged my brother with his fearless melee shieldmen. They were mowed down by archers and finished off by skirmishers once they got up the hill.\nStill outnumbered about two to one, my brother was complimented by the older men who were now consulting each other on why he'd done so well.\nThe mid game saw the veterans being more careful and collaborating, trying to siege the hill mostly with archers and drawing the Lizardmen down out of necessity. He left his archers behind, and pressured the ground troops out of cover towards the hill where his advantage was, and he suffered heavy losses.\nLater it got mind-blowing as the Dwarves kept charging up the hill to finish him off, and fell one by one, some by the dice and some by simple outplaying.\nIn the end, he stood triumphant and got his picture taken with the veterans and his two remaining Lizardmen.\n\n(x-posted from /r/rpg at a user's suggestion)",

        "text": "Warning: **Mild Spoilers for Dragon's Dogma story below**:\n\nGran Soren had burned.\n\nThe traitors from Salvation, in their mad quest to cause ruin and devastation, had smuggled a cockatrice into the safety of the mighty citadel's walls. You might think this the story of how the then magick knight slayed the beast and was saviour to the city. You would be wrong.\n\nAlthough driven off, the beast still yet lived, and would surely return to terrorize the city.\n\nA time after the beast had ravaged the city, the Knight had made her way to the farthest edges of the realm, to the Soulflayer Canyon in the shade of the Greatwall, in order to find means or method of slaying the great dragon that ravaged the country.\n\nDescending into the bowels of the earth, slaying monsters from above and below, the Knight and her companions found themselves at the head of a slick slope leading down a chasm. They could hear sounds of some fell terror screeching at the base of the slope, but there was no way to know what would face them should they descend, or if there would even be a way to return.\n\nSteeling themselves, and armed with naught but their courage and steel, they descended the slope, barely managing to stay righted as they slid.\n\nLo and behold, at the very bottom of the chasm, what should the Knight and her companions find but what could very well be the cockatrice that ravaged the citadel weeks prior. With an ear-splitting screech and battle cries meeting, the opponents charged.\n\nHaving thought herself and her allies well prepared for this fight, the Knight was distraught to find that all the healing magic and curatives could not prevent her allies from falling foul of the beast's petrifying breath.\n\nOne by one they were struck.\n\nOne by one they fell.\n\nIt seemed that all of a sudden, the mighty party that had started the duel with the beast was reduced so that only its champion remained. With what gear she had brought, and that which she had reclaimed from her fallen companions, the Knight's resolve hardened. She would either slay the beast and avenge her fallen allies, or she would die trying.\n\nThe battle seemed to rage for days as the two titans clashed, again and again. Able to shield herself from both poison and claw, the Knight endured. She could see the beast getting weaker and weaker; death from a thousand cuts. Sooner or later it would fall.\n\nExhausted, the beast was no longer able to fly within the cavern whence the battle raged. A frenzied blow laid the Knight down, and brought her within a hairs-breadth of the abyss, but she did not give in. No surrender, not even to Death, would be allowed until the beast was slain.\n\nSensing the end was near, the combatants once again charged each other. Giving a heroic leap, the Knight flew at the beaked head, and near severed it from ear to ear with her airborne slash.\n\nThe deed done, the Knight turned to catch her breath, taking trophies from the slain monster. She thought of her companions; surely in the great city of Gran Soren there would be means to resurrect them, and restore the party to it's fullest strength.\n\nGathering herself, she began the slow climb back to the surface.",

        "text": "*The following tale has no grounding in real life. Any resemblance to people real or fictional is entirely coincidental and hilarious. Please, ABSOLUTELY try running Shadowrun at home.* \n\n\nHello again! This story is brought to you by the wacky adventures of Twtich and Co. You can read about them here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/41ivw9/shadowrun_how_to_transplant_your_team_from_one/. \n\nA little bit of background for this particular game: New Zealand is surrounded by swirling mists, making it incredibly difficult to enter NZ territory by boat. There is a colossal creature rumored to reside in the deep waters of the Pacific Ocean, a Leviathan of unusual intelligence and power. Both Lone Star and Government-based law enforcement have been forced out by A.L.E. (Auckland Law Enforcement). The most common method of public transportation is a country-wide rail system, fluctuating between subway and railway as needed. \n\nThis is not the tale of bad-ass mercenaries. There are no hyper-active psychopaths with mono-filament blades, nor will you hear of any Matrix-esque feats. What you will hear about is accidental acts of terrorism, a man named Ghost and a bond formed from one common goal: Survival. Allow me to introduce the unfortunate cast of our tale, these four pitiful souls and the maniacal overlord that torments them. A small game, for those have read the story of Twitch: Try to identify who is playing which character. Without any further delay, here are our intrepid Kiwi's. \n\nBenjamin Poindexter - A perpetual quitter, Benjamin dropped out of school at a young age to embrace his only real passion: Racing. A devil behind the wheel, the human made a name for himself in the Auckland underground until an unfortunate incident led to the nickname 'Crash' and a new appreciation for life. Deciding that his racing days were behind him, Benny boy used all of his savings to purchase a vehicle and open up his own taxi agency. Despite his promises to save every penny, he would often end up broke after each all-night bender.\n\nHautangi Jackson - Once a promising potential pick for the 'All Blacks' football team, a fractured knee put an end to his career. Hautangi turned his physical prowess towards other prospect, albeit a much less glamorous one. As a bouncer for several of the local bars, the Maori youth started developing the skills of a hustler and conman. Whatever his amicable manner and quick fingers couldn't get him out of, Hautangi's size certainly could. He had developed a reputation for fighting, hustling and drinking.\n\nLeilani Hunter - Always enjoying the company of animals more so than that of humans, the young woman dove head first into her veterinary studies. The years passed in a blur until Leilani had managed to open her own veterinary clinic somewhere away from the cloying scent of eucalyptus, an allergy of hers. A farm out in the middle of nowhere, inhabited by all manner of rescued animals, was where this young human spent her off-hours. Every now and then, she would indulge in a few scant hours of her favored hobby: Hunting. \n\nNellie Smytheson: A corporate event planner for Renraku, Nellie was the life of the party. Her job required that she be in the know for any social, intellectual or political debate. On top of that, her near encyclopedic knowledge of pharmaceuticals and drug-dealers was often enough to seal the deal. When it wasn't, her own natural charm and silver tongue were able to turn a poor situation into a net win for Renraku. Human and proud, Nellie stood out among the many elves in her profession for her willingness to go that extra step. Unfortunately, she had something of a habit regarding revenge: Even the smallest slight against her would result in disproportionate retribution. \n\nRed Leader - The same bastard from the adventures of Twitch and a native to New Zealand, our Game Master designed this scenario around one concept: What happens when a group of bog-standard civilians gets thrust into a dangerous situation? Thus, we created characters far less capable than a typical shadowrunner would be. We each had a single set of skills that we were proficient in and very little else.\n\nOur tale begins, unlike so many others, with complete and utter peace. While Hautangi and Benjamin may have been somewhat discontent with their lot in life, they at least had a stable living. Nellie and Leilani were more than happy with their employment, taking enjoyment from the small things. There was no danger for any of them, save what they faced in their usual occupation. Life was good.\n\nThese four, entirely separate individuals found themselves aboard New Zealand National Train #46. Each of them was heading towards Auckland for some reason or another: Benjamin was heading there for work, Hautangi had just finished hustling in Christchurch, Leilani needed to head city-side for an appointment and Nellie was recovering from a night-long client introduction. They were not, it should be noted, the only people on-board the train. Dozens, if not hundreds, of average people going about their standard lives filled up the cramped compartments. Those that were lucky enough to procure a seat were shoved up against walls by the standing masses, those who were jealous of their comfy chairs. It was life as normal. \n\nThen the train squealed to a stop inside a long, dark tunnel. Everyone was jolted forward, unprepared for the sudden deceleration that occurred. People crashed into each other, knocking the less sturdy off their feet. The dimly-lit carriage was a chaotic mess, filled with flailing wage-slaves and panicked recriminations. Terrorists were blamed more than once as everyone tried desperately to contact some form of authority. Their attempts were met with disappointment:  The train was so far within the confines of this thick-walled tunnel that any kind of wireless signals were basically useless. With no way to call for help, and no response from the operators, there were two possibilities. \n\nA) Someone would realize that something had gone wrong when the train did not arrive within three or so minutes of the intended time frame. These trains were notoriously punctual, so this would spark some panic. Help would come because of this.\n\nB) Another train would collide with them from behind, killing everyone aboard both vehicles. Remember the notoriously punctual timetable mentioned earlier? Another train was meant to inhabit the same space as us in about ten minutes. \n\nDistinctly displeased with the options presented to her, Leilani decided on option C: She would disembark the train, run to the nearest hard-line terminal and call for assistance. The veterinarian activated the emergency exit hatch and pointedly asked if anyone else was coming with her. Hautangi, ever one for a good time, was right behind her with a grin on his face. Nellie swaggered after them, holding her heels in one hand while bare-feet pattered across the stone. Benjamin was the last to leave, shuffling forward hesitantly to round out the group. There were calls for them to stay on the train, that it might be dangerous out there, but they were ignored or laughed at. \n\nAs this rag-tag assortment of personalities marched into the darkness, there was only one question on each of their minds. Actually, each of them was asking a completely different question. \n\n\"Is this illegal? Shit, I can't get in shit with A.L.E. again but I don't want a train ramming up my arsehole.\" Benjamin was a nervous one, hands buried in his pockets. He was already out of breath at the fast pace, his paunch heaving. \n\n\"Damn these girls have some fine asses. Wonder what the odds are of me and them? Shit, I'm hungry now.\" Hautangi was the simplest of the group, whistling while they walked through the shadowy tunnel. \n\n\"The train shouldn't have stopped like that. I'm going to file a complaint, make sure this doesn't happen again. I have precious fucking time to myself, goddamn it.\" Nellie had hit the problem on the head, even if her reasoning was more selfish than anything.\n\n\"Trains don't stop out here. Nano-repair systems make sure they run all the time and they retire any carriage that can't keep the schedule. Something's wrong.\" Leilani was a practical individual, less concerned with the 'why' and more with the 'how'. Her brow furrowed with concern, she was completely unaware of Hautangi's gaze on her ass. The group continued on without conversation, shoes crunching across gravel and Hautangi's whistling were the only sounds to break the silence. The four strangers continued along, moving further and further into the tunnel. By this point, the sounds of their train had died away completely. \n\nThe darkness closed in around them, leaving them blind save for the dim illumination provided by their comm-links. Hearts beating in their ears, our headstrong group came to the realization that they were completely lost. It was Nellie who, with a disgusted scoff, asked the question.\n\n\"Does anyone know where the hell we are? Or where we're going?\" \n\n\"Down the tunnel.\" Hautangi was as helpful as ever, his smirk hidden by the darkness. Sensing an argument brewing and wanting no part in it, Leilani rolled her eyes and surged forward. Having found himself in the role of mediator, Benjamin tried to calm everyone down without much effect. Whatever they were doing was interrupted rudely and effectively by a resounding explosion. The sound was enough to deafen them, echoing throughout the tunnels, before the shock-wave threw a wave of dirt and dust into their face. The force of the blast knocked them from their feet, sending them sprawling across the concrete with a hefty thud. \n\nEven with the ringing in their ears and the wind knocked from their lungs, each of the disoriented civvies realized that this was a very bad thing. It took a few moments for Hautangi to pull himself together before he started stumbling back towards the train. The others followed his example, flailing in the direction that their Maori companion ad gone. The trek back was slower, each painstaking step a journey in it's own right, until they arrived at the shattered frame of their train. Broken corpses littered the tunnel, covered in flaming detritus and cracked concrete. \n\nThey were in shock. The devastation that surrounded them was nothing short of horrific, certainly nothing that any of them had been prepared for. Benjamin's face turned ashen half a second before he dropped to his knees, emptying the contents of his stomach. Nellie shied away as her foot was covered in splash-back, her disgust temporarily allowing her to operate past her shock. Hautangi just continued to stare, his haunted gaze roving over the utter destruction before him. What did Leilani do? She immediately burst into action, leaping into the wreckage to search for survivors. It was a futile hope but the vet refused to give up, flinging rubble aside with reckless abandon. \n\nBarely seconds had passed when a new sound made itself known over the flames: Sirens ripped through the air, accompanied by emergency response vehicles appearing from the darkness. Officers and aid workers piled out, combing through the scene with professional efficiency. Each of us was pulled aside, questioned thoroughly and told not to leave town. Leilani had to be physically pulled away from the destroyed train, her fingers bloodied. With very little option left to them, A.L.E. carted us into separate patrol vehicles and driven away from the site. \n\nNews reports were running rampant, theories appearing and escalating in moments: It was a terrorist attack, it was the start of a terrorist spree. It was a malfunctioning train-car, every train in New Zealand might explode. As each car headed in a different direction, the survivors were immediately being messaged by media outlets and journalists. They had transformed from ordinary people into hot commodities and none of them were happy with this. Even Nellie, with her highly public position, was trying to stay out of the spot-light. Thankfully, A.L.E. released a blanket statement shortly after, stating that the survivors were not to be harassed and that they would not be able to speak about their experiences for some time. \n\nIt was the only time that Hautangi or Benjamin would ever say that A.L.E. had ever done anything good for them. The officers were surprisingly kind, their voices filled with sympathy for the survivors. Promises were made to catch the people responsible, that our group would not have to speak with the press if they did not want to. Each of us was returned to our homes, with A.L.E. contacting our employers or clients to tell them that we would not be in for the next few days. This was fine for most of us but Nellie's Renraku manager was less compassionate than most, requiring a firm proclamation from the A.L.E. chief to back down. \n\nHautangi returned to his roots soon enough, blocking out the tragedy with his typical night of swindling and violence. It was an odd twist of fate that he encountered Benjamin, drowning his sorrows in copious amounts of booze. Though they knew little of each other, there was an unconscious draw that brought the two together as drinking buddies. Leilani was the most well-adjusted, returning to her property to care for the various fluffy creatures she called her own. Nellie curled up in her penthouse suite with several designer drugs, riding a pharmaceutical high through the waves of her pain. \n\nIn the midst of their coping mechanisms, each of them received a message from A.L.E. Their presence was requested at a group counseling session, two days from now. None of them were the type to speak about their feelings but the invitations were worded in such a way as to suggest a command. Not wanting to jeopardize their standing, or get into any more trouble, they all accepted. The time leading up to this day was time wasted. Few productive ventures were attempted, save by Leilani. There was always some adorable creature requiring aid, or an incredibly ugly one that needed a little love. \n\nLunch rolled around two days later and we found ourselves gathered in the conference room of a restaurant, sitting on the third floor and overlooking a picturesque park. Our host, an unusually forgettable man, gave us all a questionnaire to fulfill while he busied himself with our meals. It had been a terse reunion, with short introductions and some very awkward small-talk. Save for Benjamin and Hautangi, we were each reminders of the horror we had witnessed. It didn't help that Nellie saw herself as being above all of them, with only Leilani worth knowing. The vet in question was simply irritated to be there and even more irritated that this was being dragged out. \n\nAfter a second round of stilted conversation, the group's attention was snatched by an explosion outside. They rushed to the window, a sinking feeling in each of their stomachs. Smoke was rising from the park, tendrils of black smog twisting through the clear skies. People were screaming, rushing away from the green gardens in a panicked frenzy. A massive form brushed a tree aside, granite arms easily uprooting the kauri with a causal gesture. The earth elemental glared balefully at the fleeing masses with eyes of gleaming obsidian before raising it's stony appendages. Tapered spikes of rock shot forth, tearing through flesh and bone alike. Waves of these projectiles shredded the crowds, entire families mowed down by this eldritch monstrosity. \n\nThere was a moment of stunned silence from the group as they watched this behemoth devastate the area. They looked at each other and burst into action, shock replaced with determination. Leilani reached the stairs first, taking them three or four at a time in her haste. She was almost to the ground floor by the time Benjamin reached the second, intent on doing...something! Hautangi and Nellie both seemed to have the same idea, barreling past terrified customers and staff alike. Leilani hit the streets as the monster roared a challenge, the noise reverberating through her very body. Benjamin almost crashed into her, having taken the time to apologize to anyone in his way.\n\nThe unlikely duo stared at this earthen spirit made manifest, unsure of what to do, when it crumbled into a mossy pile. Leilani, ever the professional, immediately went about helping anyone that she could. Benjamin, already scared and certainly not qualified for this, chose to abscond from the situation. Unknown to him, he was joining Nellie and Hautangi in their flight from all of this. The two of them had decided to look after numero uno and legged it as soon as something went wrong. A.L.E eventually arrived to find a very familiar figure tending the wounded. I imagine that the officers in question stared for a moment before their eyes narrowed, a suspicious thought springing to mind.\n\nLeilani was questioned regarding the events, as was standard, but then the A.L.E. agents began to ask why she was here. When she told them about the group therapy session that their department had ordered, they seemed mollified. The duo released her and thanked her for the assistance that she had rendered. With far too much blood on her hands for her liking, Leilani went home to rest and recuperate. Alas, it was not meant to be. \n\nA.L.E. appeared at each of our doors, requesting that we come with them. Since it was very difficult to refuse such a suggestion when they are standing outside your door, the group was gathered at the local station for questioning. We were all sent to a separate room, where we underwent a rigorous interrogation at the hands of an A.L.E. detective. As the facts were laid out before us, we all knew that something was very wrong: There was not and never had been an A.L.E. approved therapy session offered for any of us. There was no record of it and when we tried to show them the invitation on our comm-links, the file had been deleted. There was video footage of us fleeing the scene after the attack, except for Leilani. So now, we had been found outside the scene of two major crime scenes that were being linked to a terrorist group. Calling themselves Earth First, the organization threatened further action if their ludicrous environmental demands were not met. \n\nThe only thing keeping us from being held was that we had absolutely no links to each other. There was no evidence, save the circumstantial, that could be used to prosecute us or that even suggested we were responsible. Though we were released, we all knew that this little 'support group' was now suspect number one. Everything that we did from here on out would be closely monitored and analyzed until Earth First was dealt with. This was made painfully obvious when Nellie's drug stash was raided and confiscated, with Renraku barely managing to keep her out of A.L.E.'s custody. It was suggested that we all keep to ourselves for some time by our various employers.\n\nA week passed, filled with tension and dread. Leilani received less and less work as the rumors about us circulated. Her hunting trips were cancelled as well, since they might have been seen as potential evidence against her. Hautangi got involved into a number of tricky situations, typically involving bludgeoning someone half to death with a pool cue. A.L.E. was called several times but he always found somewhere else to be before they showed up. Nellie boozed and slept her way through her list of one-night stands, as her manager politely suggested that she take a month off from work. It was hard to complain, save that she knew her hard-earned reputation would suffer because of this. Benjamin was surprisingly busy, having used that week to pick up his water pilot's license. He had been ferrying people by land and by sea for some time, enjoying it immensely. \n\nOn the final night of this week, the world changed. Hautangi was enjoying his evening bar crawl when a sharp prick in his neck facilitated his unconsciousness. Nellie was mid-coitus break when something similar happened to her, her form hitting the floor with a dull thud. Benjamin arrived at the predetermined pick-up point for his client, sitting happily at the helm of a small taxi-boat. The smile dropped from his face when something embedded itself in his body and he passed out. The three of the had been taken by surprise, though it would not have mattered for Nellie or Ben.\n\nLeilani was a different story entirely. Alerted to something wrong by multiple hounds barking at once, the pragmatic woman snatched up her hunting rifle before leaving the home. It was a cautious Leilani who padded down the stairs, keen eyes searching for movement in the darkness of night. Her care was shattered at the sound of a loud yelp, caution thrown to the wind. Leilani went hurtling towards the sound, sliding to her knees next to one of her dogs. Sprawled across the rocky ground, the canine had been shot with a small dart. It was very much like the one that appeared in Leilani's neck, as if by magic. A blurry glimpse of a dark figure was her last sight before entering the sweet Embrace of Morpheus. \n\nThus, our tentative band found themselves groggily awakening tied to each other. Bags covered their heads, a rough material that filled the mouth and nose while obscuring their vission. In a moment of panic, Hautangi strained at the rope. It was to everyone's surprise when they popped off, the nylon snapping in two from the exertion. Free of their restraints, each of them began removing their hoods. There was a grim acceptance from the group in general, awareness dawning of some greater plan in which they were the pawns. Benjamin was the exception, whimpering and replacing his hood once he realized who was beside him. It took several moments for their surroundings to stop shifting but a few key facts made themselves known rather quickly: First, we were in a dam somewhere. Second, the exit door was ajar and leading outside to a dark sky. Third, but perhaps most important, was the presence of many explosive devices around the area. \n\nAnd they were counting down. \n\nPanicked shouting broke out as everyone made a run for it, Leilani snatching Benjamin's hood from his face as she ran. She and Hautangi burst through the doorway, up the stairs in a heartbeat. Nellie was right behind them, desperation providing her with enough adrenaline to kill an elephant. Benjamin, the least healthy of the group, staggered behind them. His lungs wheezed for air, his legs were already cramping up and his chest was starting to hurt but he kept running. It was the thing that made sense, after all: The timer was counting down from five minutes. The group found themselves atop Ohakuri Dam, racing across the concrete structure. Their goal? Anything resembling a road that lead away from the impending detonation. As hard as they were running, there was no way that any of them would make the exit path, almost two kilometers away. As it was, they were simply going to die exhausted. \n\nOr so it would have been if a flat-bed truck hadn't pulled up alongside them. Inside was a man wearing a wide-brimmed hat and a tan coat. \n\n\"Get in. Now.\" Not one to look a gift-Dragon in the mouth, everyone pilled in and on the vehicle. Hautangi and Benjamin clung to the tray while the girls sat inside. The driver floored it, accelerating far faster than was considered safe. The group roared down the exit ramp and along the path, each bump threatening to throw the vehicle on it's side. Our driver was either incredibly skilled or entirely over-confident but we had fare more pressing concerns at the time. We reached the bottom of the path in little more than a minute, though we were far from glad. There was a town at the bottom of Ohakuri Damn, we realized. A dam that was bout to explode, unleashing the thousands of tonnes of water that it restrained. \n\nWater that would wipe this idyllic vacation town off the map. \n\n\"We have to warn someone!\" Leilani roared at our saviour, her knuckles turning white from her grip on the window. \n\n\"No time. Besides, you're already suspect number one. Once the dam goes, what do you think will happen to you?\" Nellie shifted forward, glaring at him.\n\n\"Who the fuck are you and how do you know so much?\" He chuckled in response, eyes fixed on the road.\n\n\"I call myself Ghost. I know because I've been told to watch you.\" The obvious follow-up question was prevented by sirens behind them. An A.L.E. vehicle was steadily gaining on them, shouted demands for them to pull over roaring from the speakers. \"Someone do something about them or we're fucked.\" Ghost's demand was said with the same tone one might expect of a man reciting his shopping list: Dispassionate with the slightest hint of boredom. His words seemed to get through to the duo clinging to the exterior of his truck, as they begun frantically searching for something to use. Hautangi discovered a half-full can of gasoline beneath a tarp, holding it aloft with a triumphant holler. \n\nBy this point, the A.L.E. officers were through with the polite routine. One of the started firing at the madly swerving vehicle, trying to pop a tire and force us to stop. It may have been this coupled with the stress of recent events that drove Benjamin, the most anxious about the law, to do what he did next: He snatched the gasoline from the much larger Hautangi's hands and hurled it at the pursuing enforcement officials. At the speeds we were traveling, the windshield was lucky to survived at all. As it turned out, the gasoline canister split on impact with the glass and lodged halfway inside. Liquid began pouring forth from the canister, some of it spilling onto the bonnet and some leaking inside the car.\n\n\"FUCK THE PO-LICE!\" As I mentioned before, it was likely a result of the compounding stress that caused Benjamin to react in the way he did. His scream of defiance was punctuated by throwing a lit lighter directly at the officers. In the presence of an ignition source, the gasoline did what any good fuel would do: It burned. Suffice to say, we lost our pursuers in a cacophony of screaming and crashing. Hautangi stared at his heavily panting drinking buddy, torn between congratulating him and throwing him off of the truck. In the end, he hesitantly decided on the former.\n\n\"Nice one. Now, shut up and hold on. I don't know if we can make this.\" Ghost drove so quickly that we almost missed the deafening crack that heralded Ohakuri Dam bursting open. Hautangi and Benjamin watched in horror as colossal fragments of the dam broke away, holding back the flood for but a moment before shattering like fine porcelain. None of us wanted to imagine the screams of the townsfolk when they witnessed a man-made tidal bearing down on them. The sound of roaring water was deafening, a physical embodiment of nature's wrath that sought to wipe us from the earth. The truck rounded a bend in the road and Ohakura Dam vanished from view.  We hurtled away from the burning wreck, away from the doomed town and away from our lives. \n\nIt was a pensive trip. No-one could bring themselves to speak, not even to demand answers from Ghost. All we could do was think about what had just happened. Hundreds, if not thousands, of lives would be lost. The water would remove any trace that there had ever been a town there. This would be the largest act of terrorism that New Zealand had ever seen, far exceeding anything that had come before. \n\nAnd we would be the prime suspects.\n\n\"Right. What just happened, that was shit. I can drop you off somewhere if you want but A.L.E. will snatch you up and then string you up. To the rest of the world, you're the bad guys.\" Ghost kept a steady tone, like he was talking about the weather instead of mass murder via exploding dam. His words were enough to shake us from our reverie, drawing our attention to him. Leilani was the one to speak, some anger finally bleeding back into her voice.\n\n\"What the fuck are we meant to do? There's nowhere else to go.\" Ghost finally looked awAs ay from the road, just for a moment. He smiled, a pathetic thing bereft of humor, and shrugged.\n\n\"I know somewhere. If you come with me, then it means you're in. No if's, no but's, no nothing. You come with me, then my employers can keep you safe. All you have to do is whatever the hell they tell you to do.\" \n\nWith a chaffing lack of options and a desire not to end up in prison for something they didn't do, there was only one thing to say.\n\n\"Fuck.\" \n\nGhost laughed, the first genuine reaction we had pulled from the man. \n\n\"Alright then. Say goodbye to your old lives, kids.\" He said nothing further. \n\nWe drove for hours, taking back-roads and dirt paths to avoid seeing anyone. The pace became more sedate, the trip less tumultuous. Soon enough, the adrenaline exacted it's price from each of us and we nodded off. However long we were asleep, it was enough that the sun was setting once more by the time we awoke. The truck had finally come to a stop, rolling in front of a large mountain range that spanned seemingly forever. Ghost was already out and about, stretching his legs with a yawn.  \n\n\"Alright boys and girls, last stop. Out of the truck and into the cave.\" This was met with some confusion until we realized that really was a cave entrance, hidden between several trees. We trudged over to them, half-awake and entirely anxious. Deeper into the cave stood a sturdy metal door, preventing anyone from moving beyond. Ghost punched in a code for some sort of electronic lock and the door opened with a low groan, scrapping across the bare stone. Past the threshold lay a single, cramped room. Four aluminum frames sat with threadbare mattresses settled atop them, barely enough room between them to move. A large box sat in the middle, marked 'rations', and what appeared to be a natural well had been formed in one of the walls. To top it off, a chemical toilet was stationed in the corner of our incredibly tight living space. \n\n\"This will be your home for the foreseeable future. There should be enough soy rations to last one month, if you don't mind eating light.\" Ghost marched us inside, barring the way out with his body. \"You're going to have to lay low here until the heat dies down. Speaking of which...\" He pulled a small case from the depths of his coat and opened it. From it's confines, he produced an injector and four vials of liquid. \"This solution should muddy up your astral signatures, make it that much harder for someone to find you. Magically, at least.\" Unwilling to inject themselves with an unknown compound on a whim, the group refused.\n\n\"What's in it?\" Nellie was the first to ask, having the most experience with designer drugs. Ghost stared at her quizzically. \n\n\"Do you have a degree in biochemistry with a specialty in astrally awakened solutions? Because I sure as fuck don't. Either it works and you live or it doesn't and you die. Got it?\" Benjamin gave a discontent whisper as they all lined up.\n\n\"Do we have much of a choice?\" Ghost came to him last, injecting Ben slightly harder than necessary.\n\n\"Find yourself asking that question a lot lately?\" Without waiting for an answer, Ghost gave the taxi driver a gentle push towards the cave. \"Go on, get inside. Hunker down and get used to it. I'll be back as soon as I can.\" With the four of us packed into the cave like sardines into a can, Ghost gave us a jaunty wave and pushed another set of keys on the lock. The door began to swing shut, sealing us away. No-one knew if this would be the last time that we would ever see the sun. Ghost's face was the last thing that we saw in natural light. \n\nThe dull glow of a fluorescent bulb burned at our eyes as we surveyed our domicile. This place was barely big enough for two people, let alone four. Nellie in particular was horrified at the conditions we were experiencing. We started to settle in, pick beds and ration out our meager food supplies. The bulb turned off at what we could only assume to be nightfall, bathing us in darkness. As distressing as all of this had been, it was nothing compared to what would come next...",

        "text": "Me and my group were chatting on skype, as per usual, when one of our members (if you read my previous story, he's the player of Fuyu, but this is before that time) decided to recant our newest player with a tale of old. \n\nThe topic of the Deck Of Many Things had been brought up, and J (we'll call him J) decided to tell the story. This is word for word, all of his writing. I can't make this up, this is how he actually talks.\n\nFor clarity, the new player is R, the storyteller is J, the Paladin was L, our GM is W, and our other friend is M.\n\n---\n\nR: \"Deck of Many Things, huh? Interesting...\"\n\nJ: \"Oh, you weren’t here when we tried that were you?\"\n\nJ: \"It wasn’t a good idea.\"\n\nR: \"It sounds really cool though.\"\n\nJ: \"Beholden yourself to the wisdom of those who came before you, for they have made your mistakes.\"\n\nJ: \"Perhaps you’d like to hear the tale?\"\n\nR: \"Sure\"\n\nJ: \"So we had started a new campaign.  I believe it was the beginning of the second session that we stumbled upon a mysterious peddler, or one of those antique genie fortune teller things, I forget which.\"\n\nM: \"oh boy\"\n\nM: \"I remember this\"\n\nJ: \"Both we and our characters were intrigued by his wares, for he carried nothing but a deck of playing cards.\"\n\nJ: \"He offered us to take three from the deck at random while W, the DM, offered us a deck in real life.\"\n\nJ: \"I, being the suspicious, genre savvy debonair that my character was, immediately suggested that we go into town before our crap got ruined by the obviously dangerous old man and his funky deck.  Nobody listened.\"\n\nJ: \"I forget who drew the first cards, but before you knew it, there was chaos.  I became the Lord, then the Duke, of my home nation.  One of us went up a level.  One of us was severely poisoned.  Fortunes both fair and foul were upon us left and right as we continued to draw.\"\n\nJ: \"When it ended, all the cards had run their course and changed our characters radically.  All, but one.  One could say it was the master of all cards, for it’s effect was the most potent and dangerous.\"\n\nJ: \"My final card allowed me to compel any being, any being whatsoever, to follow a single order.\"\n\nJ: \"That order could not be subverted or disobeyed, and the target was immediately under it’s control from the moment the card was activated.  No saves and no amount of cleverness could subvert its terrible power.\"\n\nJ: \"I, knowing the true value of the card and wishing to save it for when I would have most use of it, kept it on my person for the rest of the day.  But the Paladin, directed by L, sensed the Evil in the card itself.  Evidently, the power of ultimate compulsion was too great a threat to Good for him to allow the card to remain in existence.\"\n\nJ: \"That night, he snuck into my tent and searched my belongings for the card.  He found it, and tore it in half.\"\n\nJ: \"When the deed was discovered, he promptly claimed his intentions as noble.  I was furious.  A power suited for intelligence, a power whose use was limited only by the logic and creativity of the user, was a power I thought most suitable for my character.  Indeed, for most any character I would like to create.  It was a power I admired on a practical and thematic level.\"\n\nJ: \"The others party members took to my side, and the Paladin, sensing hostile intent, took to his horse.  He fled before my retribution could be brought down onto him.  And I knew that L would just make another character to take his place, while my most perfect power was lost forever.\"\n\nL: \"I read my name and instantly remembered the story.\"\n\nM: \"LOL L\"\n\nJ: \"The argument quickly rose between us in reality.  Nothing could quell my indignation; no amount of L’s claim to good roleplaying assuaged my righteous anger.  W, quickly hating the argument as much as I hated the act itself, returned us to the game where he, as a godly figure, told us to stop being such pissbabies.\"\n\nL: \"you talk purty\"\n\nJ: \"After arguing philosophy and my right to the card, it was decided by God W that the Deck of Many Things was a terrible idea that never should have happened.  And with his divine power, he made it so.\"\n\nM: \"lol\"\n\nJ: \"We returned to where and when we met the old man, sans the old man and his accursed deck.  The deck that had nearly ended the campaign and torn us apart.  We went on with our journey, the lesson heavy in our hearts that one does not introduce godly artifacts to characters who are on their second session.\"\n\nJ: \"I don’t think I’ve ever been more angry with this group than when that glorious Ace of Spades was sundered.\"\n\nJ: \"You just can’t expect a party of people who’ve only known each other for a little while to responsibly handle the twists in fortune that come with that deck.  It must be done as a group, and where we were, and where we are now, we have no such cohesion.\"\n\nJ: \"Had we known each other for some years, maybe the Paladin wouldn’t have acted so brashly.  Maybe, having known him, I’d have been more reluctant to keep such a malicious power.  But we hadn’t, we didn’t, and we reaped the consequences.\"\n\nR: \"...\"\n\nR: \"So you're saying to give this on our third session?\"",

        "text": "Having grown tired of dungeon crawling and endless trecks across the wastelands me and my players were in the mood for an urban, low-fantasy campaign. While they were rolling up characters I picked the city of Daval to be the setting. With half a million inhabitants Daval was one of the biggest cities in the game, not unlike late Imperial-era Rome: Lots of marble villas, palaces and temples in the walled-off centre, all surrounded by vast slum areas. The basic idea of the campaign was that the PCs would start out at the bottom and work their way up into high society. How they chose to achieve that would be up to them.\n\nThe PCs:\n\nTertius, the son of a fairly prominent merchant; cast out of the family after getting his cousin pregnant. Face, conman and unofficial leader of the group. Charismatic as all hell, good with numbers and fluent in several languages. Fairly capable with a sword.\n\nSnöboll, human barbarian warrior from the Eastern Mountains turned prisoner of war, turned gladiator. He managed to buy himself free after seven years in the arena. Found work as an enforcer. Wields a gigantic two-handed sword, absolute beast in combat, not too bright.\n\nKinarya, elven (very rare in this part of the world) alchemist and unofficially educated mage. Knows first aid and can cook up some nasty poisons, but apart from that not much use in combat.\n\nPeryxus, skilled cat-burgular and hitman. Sneakiest son of a bitch this side of Asharia. Ruggedly handsome; considers himself quite the ladies man. Carries one heavy crossbow (takes him eight turns to wind the fucking thing up, but pretty much anything hit by it will drop instantly) and a brace of pistol crossbows. Dude likes crossbows.\n\nTheir backstory was that they had all worked for the same gang in one of the wealthy Southern port cities. They skipped town when that operation went tits up, and now they're planning on starting their own criminal organization right in the capitol of the empire. I dig the idea, it's kinda like a Roman-fantasy themed GTA.\n\nSo they head off to one of the poorer districts to set a base of operations, and they're immediately off to a bad start. No one wants to hire out an apartment to four obviously sketchy unemployed assholes, especially when one of them is an elf (\"Don't you know they steal babies from their cribs!?\"). Finally they manage to lease a room from a half-blind elderly cat lady. The room smells like cat piss, but it's big enough for them all to sleep and stash their stuff in, so whatever.\n\nOnce that's done they split up to get the lay of the land. Kinarya scopes out the nearby apothecaries with limited success (\"Why did you let an elf into the store!? Don't you know their presence sours the reagents!?\"). Tertius and Snöboll tour the taverns to speak with the locals and listen to rumors. Peryxus picks some pockets and hits the brothels; whores tend to have quite a bit of street knowledge that they don't mind sharing if their client is generous enough. When the four meet up late in the evening to share information they find there are four things virtually all locals agree upon:\n\n1. They're scared shitless of elves. (\"Don't you know they can curse you just be looking at you!?\")\n\n2. There's a myriad of small independent gangs in the district and one large Thieves Guild.\n\n3. You only get to join the Thieves Guild once you get noted by them for pulling off an impressive job. *They* will contact *you*. Never the other way around.\n\n4. Don't fuck with the Guard.\n\nThe last point they find a bit confusing. The few guardsmen they have seen so far have been bored looking men in ill-fitting uniforms patrolling the streets alone. The Guard hardly even seems to have a presence in the district, but despite that everyone seems almost as wary of them as they are of elves.\n\nAnyway, after a few weeks of break-ins, robberies and picked pockets the PCs have gained a bit of a reputation. Some of the other gangs have tried to intimidate them into getting off their turf, but have all backed off once they've spotted the barbarian and the elf. Kinarya has managed to set up a simple laboratory in the room where she cooks up various drugs which are then sold to street urchins for further distribution to the many junkies in the city. This gets them the attention of the Thieves Guild who send them an official invitation.\n\nMemebership would hook them up with a better class of fences, gang leaders and other potential business partners, so this is good news indeed! However, before they can become initiated they all need to pass a test under supervision of a high-ranking guild official. They've heard of this before, and supposedly it's not that difficult.\n\nPeryxus is chosen to go first. A man in a grey hood and cloak wakes him up in the middle of the night and leads him to a large house in one of the less shitty parts of the district. His task is to break into the top floor of the building, steal a golden statuette from a small shrine and then sneak out without waking any of the people inside. No problem, this is what he maxed out his build for. He's in and out of there in under two minutes, statuette in hand. Now he just has to sneak back across the street and into the alley where his supervisor is waiting.\n\nThat's when the guardsman appears. He's strolling through the street carrying a lantern, stops right at the entrence to the alley, leans against a wall and lights up his pipe.\n\n\"Shit\", says the player. \"Is he alone?\"\n\n\"You can't see anyone else besides him.\"\n\n\"Is he carrying any weapons?\"\n\n\"Well, yeah, he's got a cudgel and a shortsword strapped to his belt and a crossbow on his back.\"\n\n\"Does he see me?\"\n\n\"Not as far as you can tell. He's facing you, but you're hidden in the shadows. He's just having a quiet smoke.\"\n\n\"I shoot him then. He's just a guard.\"\n\nSo he takes out his gigantic crossbow and shoots the poor bastard right in the forehead. He's dead before he even hits the cobbles. Peryxus dashes across the street to meet up with the guild official who is staring at him in wide-eyed horror. After a few tense seconds he draws a crossbow of his own.\n\n\"Sorry to have to do this. You seemed like a talented kid.\"\n\n\"SHIT! I try and dodge it!\"\n\n\"You try and dodge a crossbow bolt fired at short range in a cramped alleyway?\"\n\n\"Well, yeah!\"\n\nWith some amazingly lucky dice rolls he actually manages to sidestep the bolt, draw one of his hand bows and shoot the guy in the heart.\n\nKinarya's player, who has been facepalming for the last five minutes turns to me. \"We're in deep shit now, aren't we?\"\n\nAnd yes, they were.\n\n**This got way longer than I thought it would, and it's getting pretty late. Will finish the story tomorrow.**",

        "text": "Malaney Belrue is a bard I'm playing in a 5e campaign. She is my first bard and how I've designed her, she's found herself in a similar position as Bilbo Baggins when Gandalf sent him on his way with the Dwarves. May Malaney's adventure bring out her best as her limits are tested by learning about her Godly potential and finding her courage.\n\n*Rucejk La’Dwa ab Jujnis, 2997*\n\n“Thank you for letting me travel with your group, Rueben,” I told my once boss.\n \n“Aye, it was a great pleasure. Your music will be missed. ‘Twas good moral for everyone, all things considered,” he said, paying me fifteen silver pieces. I kept my smile on my face though a flashback of the bandits crossed my mind. I then pulled my hood down over my head and with my lyre clutched in hand, headed into the market of Asura. With money for a few days at an Inn, plus whatever I could make while performing my music, I was confident I’d be able to find another caravan in that time frame. \n\nThe capital city was bustling with folk and soon I came to the Drunken Lion. It would have to suffice considering I needed to make what little I had stretch. There was a good amount of folk moving in and out as it was the lunch hour. I walked on in and intuitively spotted the fliers. Actually it was rather impossible to not notice. Immediately upon entering, about ten feet from the entrance was the board, that folk could tack up pretty much whatever they wanted, and it was cluttered with advertisements. It was hard to tell if the Innkeeper was just lazy and didn’t bother to dispose of the expired fliers or if it was a particularly busy week.\n\nI sifted through the papers, looking for keywords that would indicate a caravan being put together. As I did that, one flier caught my eye. I wish I hadn’t taken a moment to look at the poorly scribbled note. Some guy was in need of help and asked any and all who were interested to meet him at night by the stables. The hairs on the back of my neck prickled at the thought of going. It seemed too shady.\n\nPromptly I began to peruse the other fliers, but I didn’t get very far into my search when I felt a firm hand rest on my shoulder. I whipped my head to look at the masked face of an acquaintance. Automatically I put a smile on my face to hide the fact my stomach was knotting and my heart was racing. My hand clutch the lyre more firmly and my legs yearned to move away. Let alone my mind loudly wondering why he was there! I had thought I would never see the humanoid again after our travels with Rueben.\n\nWith my shoulder firmly in my fellow caravaner’s grasp, he pointed back to the scribbled note I had dismissed. I looked to him and watched the childlike face bob up and down. \n\n“Me?” I questioned. He then gestured between the two of us. “We?” I corrected. Again the childlike face bobbed. I wanted to laugh. I wanted to cry. I wanted to scream at the guy and ask him why the hell would I run off into the dark with him to meet some random guy? I, a woman, was traveling alone and had more than enough common sense to know a bad situation when I saw one. Rape and death were the likely outcomes if I went with.\n\nYet on that same note... if I refused the masked figure, would he unleash the fury I saw him unveil with the bandits? \n\nI groaned internally as I realized the awful situation I was in. Perhaps I was being too nice and trusting, but I nodded in agreement.\n\nMy fingers nervously reached out and began plucking at my lyre. I needed to play and calm my nerves. And that is what I did once I got the Innkeepers approval to perform for coin. \n\nWith my back to the far wall, sitting on a chair, a single cup near my feet, I began to let my fingers get lost in the strings. Soon I forgot about my strange companion, the folk that stared in my direction, and the note that ultimately could be my doom.\n\n✻   ✻   ✻   ✻   ✻\n",

        "text": "Just like in my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3owv56/wod_in_which_the_dm_proved_his_impartiality_for/), our World of Darkness group consists of a mish-mash of different modules. This little escapade mostly involves our Werewolf and Demon. \n\nWe were nearing the end of our first \"dungeon\", a mental asylum tethered in another dimension. 3 members of the party, myself (Life Mage 'Monk guy'), the Fae, and a Demon (named 'Lilith'), had taken on most of the dungeon together. At this point there's an interesting relationship triangle going on between these 3 characters. I've sworn an oath to protect the Fae, who has also saved my butt more times than I can count now. Lilith and Fae also have a long-standing alliance.\n\nBut me and Lilith don't get along at all. Out of game we're cool with eachother, but in-game our characters are ideological opposites. She values self-interest before all else, and I'm a militant altruist. The pretenses for not killing eachother was basically just survival. To make matters worse, the demon and I are both in search of an evil magic sword- her to wield it, and me to destroy it. We knew this in meta-game, but our characters were blissfully unaware of this fact.\n\nThe two other players, a vampire and the werewolf, came into the dungeon under similar pretenses. The vampire died upon merely touching the blade (the spirit inhabiting the blade asked him 'are you worthy of wielding me?', he really shouldn't have responded \"maybe...\"). The shambling vampire corpse lead the blade right to us. \n\nLilith's higher initiative roll makes her able to snatch the sword first.\n\nBut, things don't go quite as smoothly as she would like.\n\nTo get out of this dimension, there needed to be a demonic sacrifice. Lilith had some NPC vassals with her- so it was a matter of negotiating and picking which one to be executed. The DM made the decision fairly obvious, as one demon (named Abadon) was acting disloyal to Lilith, his lord. Even still, the player wasn't comfortable executing him.\n\nAnd so there was an impasse.\n\nNegotiations go sour and Lilith is pinned in place by a large gravity well- basically unable to move.\n\nWhile this is going on, the werewolf, hot on the vampire-zombie's trail, finds our party. The Fae and Demon are still having a vocal argument on who has to die, meanwhile I really don't care about demons, so I talk to the Werewolf. \n\nWe have a little conversation, he talks about how alone and scared he is, and I attempt to comfort him and offer my friendship. He explains how he is losing his sanity and needs to return home. I basically fill him in on the situation. I also nonchalantly mention how Lilith has an evil sword and...ya'know...probably should be stopped.\n\nHere's where things get fun:\n\nEvery time the Werewolf shows up, he does something profoundly reckless and jeopardizes the other characters. For our group, this has made him 'That guy'.\n\nBut this time- that's exactly what I want to happen. I want 'That guy' in on the action.\n\nThe DM mentions, once again, how Lilith is pinned in place. Out of game, I glare at 'That guy' and then dart my eyes over to the Demon's player a few times. I figure this will get the message \"hey, you should try killing her\" across.\n\nBut, that message didn't come across right. The werewolf walks straight into the argument and says to Abadon \"You my possess me as your vessel.\"\n\nEveryone turns immediately to him. The DM starts speaking in Abadon's character \"You wish for me to consume you, Mortal? On what grounds?\"\n\nThe werewolf lets out a word salad basically saying \"I've been stuck here for days on end, I just need to escape- and if you can make that happen I'm willing to offer myself to you.\"\n\nAbadon accepts. All the other player's mouths are agape. The DM and I are absolutely delighted with the plot twist.\n\nAnd so begins a gigantic frenzy between the Werewolf and Lilith. Lilith's demonic vassals all take sides, and the fight begins.\n\nWhat follows is the most absurdly broken battle I have ever seen in a tabletop game. Both Lilith and the possessed Werewolf are using all their firepower at once.\n\nThe average damage dicepool at this point in the game is around 3-4. I remember one attack involved 22 dice being rolled for attack damage, and the other party soaking all the damage by burning through demonic faith. The entire battle consists of things like this, and both players ardently checking their stat-sheets.\n\nThe battle continues, lesser demons die left, right, and center. Azrael, demon-god of death gets his arms ripped off and thrown at Lilith. The Fae sides with Lilith, casting spells weak enough to keep her from being noticed. I stay the hell out of the fight and try to evacuate bystanders from the blast zone. \n\nAt this point, all the other players are PISSED at 'That guy' for orchestrating this situation. I am having the time of my life witnessing this.\n\nThe Werewolf, burning through nearly all of his ragepoints and faith, tries an intimidation roll saying he will devour the souls of all those who choose to defy him. At that point, I finally step in, and use my life magic to cause aggravated, **non-soakable** damage. This tips the scales towards Lilith, who gains traction on her next attack, and slaughters Abadon/Werewolf.\n\nSuffice to say, this is where our game left off. I plan on opening next game by telling Lilith \"I guess there are worse things out there than you\", and making our little team just a bit more civil.",

        "text": "Just found this subreddit and remembered something that happened to me in a game that makes for an amusing story.\n\nSo, once upon a time I used to play Skyrim on the Xbox 360. Compared to the PC version, it's a painful experience. But I didn't have a good computer then, so I made due.\n\nSomewhat minor spoilers for Skyrim.\n\nOne day, I decided to make a new character. As I always do, I made a Khajiit (Cat person) because I LOVE their Night-eye ability. But this time, I decided to play on Expert (Typically playing on Novice) without resorting to either Archery or Stealth, just to challenge myself. I planned on a mix of Sword/Board and Battleaxes, but eventually branched out to include Archery, but not Stealth.\n\nAfter getting through the first part of the game, I finally made it out into the world. I made my way over to Whiterun and informed the Jarl of the Dragons and all that. I did what business I needed to do in Whiterun and left the city.\n\nAnd that's when the game decided not to screw around because there was a god damn Ancient Dragon waiting for me outside the damn gates! I was level 1! I was a fresh character! Those things aren't supposed to show until level 45! Hell, Dragons aren't supposed to show up until you complete a certain quest and I sure as hell hadn't completed that quest yet.\n\nAll I could do was run... There was no way I could fight such a strong enemy at that level. He followed me, but I managed to get away. But it doesn't end there. Throughout that game, at every turn, I was harassed by this Ancient Dragon. I'd come out of a cave, there he was. I leave a city, I had to flee. Leave a ruin, yep there he is... Just out exploring the world? I'd hear him roar or occasionally catch a glimpse of him.\n\nAnd he just kept harassing me over and over.\n\nFrom about level 15 to about 25 or so (I can't exactly remember) I thought I got a break and he finally despawned or whatever, because thankfully I didn't see him. I thought I was finally rid of him. (I would to note that I STILL hadn't activated Dragons yet in that game.)\n\nBut I was just wishing. By that point I had powered my smithing skill up and was clad in Ebony armor with Ebony weapons, and finally he showed up once again, as I was leaving the Storage Room (Where I set up my base) at Mzulft (A dwarven ruin which has a small room on the exterior which is a safe spot to keep gear)\n\nFrom then, an epic battle between Dragon and ~~man~~ Cat began. After a long while of me plinking him with arrows and occasionally smashing him in the face with a Sword when he decided to land but take off again, I finally started getting the upperhand (About a hundred health potions didn't hurt either) and he crash lands.\n\nI start wailing away at his face with my Battleaxe, when he gets in a lucky Firebreath just as my Fire Resist Potion wore off. I almost died and I back off so I can heal...\n\nAnd then the unthinkable happens. Despite having less than 5% life remaining... He takes off. He's not supposed to be able to fly at low of life. Wait a minute. What's he doing? No... No! He's flying away. HE ACTUALLY FLEW AWAY. THE BASTARD FLEW AWAY AND ABANDONED ME.\n\nAnd with that, he left. And he was never seen again. I never got the satisfaction of revenge after being harassed so much.\n\nIn fact, even AFTER activating Dragons? I never once saw an Ancient Dragon show up. Talk about a middle finger.",

I've never found horses to be useful in Skyrim, but they're a faster way to travel if you don't have any method of fast travel available. They also break the laws of physics, being able to walk on pretty much any angle. So I was climbing over this mountain, reached the top, and prepared to go down the bottom, when I went a little too fast and found myself, and the horse, falling straight down at a terminal velocity. When I hit the ground, I had 1HP, the horse was dead, and I was in front of a town where I can get some proper starting equipment. And if it wasn't for that horse, I would've died in that fall.",

This was my first time GM'ing, so it left a lot to be desired, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Let me introduce our characters: \n\nPete: a guy with a saxophone.\n\nBob 2: a blind guy carrying a grenade in his mouth (and an unhealthy obsession with finding grenades)\n\nGary: a tall, fat and sassy guy with a ketttle\n\nSally: a young Victoria girl with a rope (that was apparently used to strangle her governess) and a penchant for screaming at extremely unhelpful times. \n\nThey started in the car park of an abandoned amusement park, where they immediately used the grenade and saxophone to blow down the gate and escape. I refused to let this happen, so in they went. Sally found a cellophane bag, they encountered Shia and he got away. At this point, Bob 2 developed an obsession with finding grenades, I told him he would find one if he got a 20 on a d20, with 12 attempts. Also, around this time the group - without discussion or debate - decided to pursue and kill Shia, instead of the other way around. \n\nThe main interesting points of the story are:\n\n*Pete tried to throw his sax at Shia - who was stood on top of a rollercoaster\n\n*Bob 2 broke his cane trying to climb a tree\n\n*Bob 2 searched for a grenade inside a tree (attempt 5), found a rabid squirrel which bit him (giving him rabies) before he killed it and searched it for a grenade (attempt 6)\n\n*Pete took a bear trap to use against Shia\n\n*The party set fire (on purpose) to the house in which they found themselves. The fire spread and nearly burned the whole house down\n\n*Pete set the bear trap on fire \n\n*Sally tied a rusty spoon to Bob 2's broken cane and set it on fire\n\n*Bob 2 used his last 3 grenade-finding rolls to get 19, 18 and then a 20 on his final roll. I told him that he saw a grenade with its pin pulled by the opening door. He rushed across the room and jammed a grenade pin he found into the grenade, stopping it. Sally's player then reminded us that Bob 2 is blind. I shrugged and went with it\n\n*Pete tied the grenade to the flaming bear trap\n\n*Gary ate beans which gave him flatulence, which he later used to clear a room\n\n*Pete's dangerous device blew up and killed him (to no-one's surprise)\n\n*Bob 2 tried to punch Shia using a rusty grenade pin, which failed and caused him to contract tetanus\n\n*Shia disembowelled Bob 2, who asked to use Pete's saxophone as a bypass to prevent blood loss. I allowed it\n\n*Gary attempted to eat Pete's remains, felt morally and physically wrong, but still tried to eat it to gain super powers\n\n*Sally went Wile E Coyote and fashioned a dangerous Shia-killing trap with a chandelier and her rope\n\n*Bob 2 bit Shia and gave him rabies\n\n*Bob 2 set fire to Gary's giant flabby butt to attract Shia\n\n*Bob 2 attempted to stab Shia with a plastic gardening trowel, stabbed himself in the leg and died\n\n*Sally attacked Shia with a homemade knife\n\n*Gary bodyslammed Shia and eventually killed him\n\nSomewhere along the line, Bob 2 also managed to give Shia tetanus too. As you can see, my party went a bit nuts. I'm not sure how common it is for parties to hunt and kill Shia, rather than killing him in self-defense, but it happened. I'm really looking forward to gaming with these guys again, just maybe not as GM.\n\n**TL;DR: party actively tries to hunt and kill Actual Cannibal Shia LaBeouf, succeeds with half the party dead and a total mess of a house left behind**",

Her name was Rivia, and she was on the run from some angry thieves' guild members.\n\nOne of the party members was an Elf Samurai/Magus named Fuyu (it was much longer, but we called him \"Fuyu\"). During the introductions, Rivia decided to steal a sizable amount of gold from Fuyu, as a prank. The plan was to cut his purse, jump up on a table, and wave it in his face. Impressive feat, good fun. Right?\n\nWell, right before Rivia could jump up on the table, thieves' guild members stormed the area, looking for Rivia. Seems like they were waaaay closer than anyone expected (I seriously thought we'd get halfway into the campaign before they showed up).\n\nIn the confusion, the gold was never returned. Turns out, our Cleric/Monk saw Rivia steal the gold and told Fuyu, thinking that she was going to keep it. We fight off the guild, and we turn in for the night (we were in an inn).\n\nFuyu decides to enter Rivia's room and demand his gold back. Alerted by his no-attempt-to-stealth, the halfling decides that she's grown fond of the extra weight in her purse. And before Fuyu could even move, my rogue/swashbuckler vaulted out the window and took off running.\n\nEventually, he caught up to her. And backed into a corner, Rivia decided to challenge Fuyu to a contest.\n\nA **dagger-eating contest**.\n\nI'll be honest, I was joking at first. But it clicked in my brain, and I decided to roll with it. Rivia produced two daggers, and the rules were simple:\n\nFuyu and Rivia both eat a dagger at the same time. Whoever is still standing, wins (whoever lost the least amount of health). If Fuyu wins, he gets his gold back. If Rivia wins, she gets to keep it.\n\nAfter *much* convincing, and a lot of hidden laughter, the samurai actually agreed to the challenge (very reluctantly). And with a resolve, he shoved the dagger in his mouth and swallowed it whole.\n\nRivia, failing her sleight of hand check, poorly mimed eating the dagger while also failing to hide her laughter. \n\nOur Cleric/Monk had to punch the samurai in the uvula and make him throw up before the dagger killed him from the inside. He eventually got his gold back, and I have 0 doubt that \"dagger-eating contests\" will now become a running joke.",

This story is from the same group as one of my previous posts over at /r/DnD, which you can find [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/3z7j16/why_we_dont_give_dave_flammable_objects/), but was a diffeerent campaign with different PCs. I can't exactly remember what class everyone was, but that wasn't important. Let's start at the beginning, at Gnome Towers! Gnome Towers was a fortress inhabited by gnomes, as should go without saying. For some reason I can't remember the big bad human empire was attacking with a MASSIVE army, I'm talking thousands of soldiers for this level one party. So, instead of fighting this army, we set off on a ship that was conveniently right next to the fortress so we can make our escape. There was only one problem... the entire human navy. Most of the enemy ships were off supporting the army, but one was on our tail, and it was faster than us. Instead of fighting the enemy ship normally, I decide that I will make the absurdly loyal cabin boy go on a suicide mission. His job? Why, to swing on a rope to the enemy ship while holding a lit keg of powder and then attempt to place it into the enemy cannon. Surprisingly, this worked, and the cabin boy even managed to swing back to our ship for a congratulation. The powder keg blew half the ship up and the rest sank. After staring in disbelief at how the cabin boy was still alive for a few minutes, we set off for the nearest port while I played sea shanties on my phone to get us in the mood for high seas adventure! there was only one problem, the port we were sailing to was the human capital. We managed to lay low in the city for a while, during this time my character got black out drunk and passed out for the next 12 in game hours. Not much else notable happened until the guards found us, and raided the inn we were staying at late at night. In the ensuing chase we jumped from rooftop to rooftop and made many a Assassin's Creed joke. Eventually we decided we were going to steal a boat to escape (that's two this session) and headed for the harbor. On our way to the harbor, we stopped to pick up a lobster on the beach which we promptly named Carl, ad then stopped the game for ten minutes to write a song about. Then we realized we were still being chased and dropped Carl in the ocean, where he was promptly eaten by a giant squid. The rest of this session was fairly boring, but in a later campaign I was DMing I decided that Carl had escaped from the squid (by killing it with his might claws), became a powerful wizard, and eventually ascended to godhood as the new god of the sea. Carl was then captured a few years later inside an amulet by a cult of assassins, an amulet which one of my players took of the corpse of one of the assassins, but can't release Carl from... yet.\n\nTL;DR Lobster is eaten by a squid and then ascends to godhood",

The story of this campaign isn't as important so long story short, the party consists of A pyromancer sorceress who was the no pun intended definition of a hot head, a swashbuckler who was trying to be Wesley from Princess Bride, A monk who was all about peace and the herb (he would ask to buy marijuana in game if he could), a battle scion who was a former member of the King's army until he deserted after seeing the atrocities of war, and lastly a Bounty Hunter who was known for his eccentric ways that hid the killer underneath. The group had a couple sessions where the battle scion and the bounty hunter miss due to real life issues. They missed 3 days in game time, and I jokingly said they were doing something as the rest of the party worked for the King's army. So when the bounty hunter and the battle scion came back, I had a plan. The bounty hunter had to represent the Battle Scion in court due to the Battle Scion being a deserter (this went over very well as we knew the comedic value would be high). So after the funniest trial ever with the Bounty Hunter acting like the Lawyer Chicken from Futurama, the judge decides that the only way to determine the fine is to do the traditional Judgment by Combat (homebrew world, homebrew society). So they prepare and they expect some thugs or some minor monsters. I toss at them the most dangerous force I could think of. 1,000 house cats..... the cats had 1 hp, and did 1 damage with a 19-20 crit x3. it was insane. The bounty hunter was using his rapier to stab the house cats that were jumping all over him while the battle scion was trying to cast aoe spells. I honestly have no idea they survived it. They were level 7 and I thought this would be a funny pushover fight but the house cats almost got them. and yes, they did get to 1,000.... \"I have yet to see a battlefield as horrifying, gory and full of hairballs as I did that day\" became the quote of the century and we still quote it to this day.",

The cast is as follows:\n\n- Calbo Bobax: Played by a long-time friend of mine; Mandalorian Scoundrel; around 36 years old, veteran of the Mandalorian Wars; captain of the ship, The Dusty Trollop; master of disguise, hacker, demoman, and fantastic with a vibrodagger.\n\n- Ludvusal Ash: Twi'lek Fringer; goes by \"Ash\"; best pilot in the group; able to fix nearly anything and everything; she is the only one able to speak Binary.\n\n- Akuna Maralka Tata: Human Soldier; from Tatooine; he is a combat \nmonster that is also trained in field medicine; uses a self-crafted vibrosword called \"Wookie's Razor\"\n\n- Bizas Seraal: Miralukan Noble; Gifted in The Force and a sort of \"Fallen Noble\" archetype; able to utilise several different Force powers, despite a lack of real training; she is the other master of disguise.\n\n- Sedri: Zabrak Force Adept from as-of-yet-undetermined planet; toes the line between Light and Dark, as per her Force tradition- though she leans a bit Dark; uses a quarterstaff and bow in combat (I allowed Force Weapon to apply to the bow at a lowered die type for like, half the duration).\n\n- Jackie Milgil: part-Echani Jedi Sentinel; on a mission to find her master, Alennic Dansark; does not have the support of the Order, due to her master's lack of popularity and mild ostracization because of his Grey-er philosophy; was found and trained after spending her early life on the streets of Coruscant; silver lightsaber; toes the line, leans Light.\n\n- Rickale Nazhar: Human Scout; from Corellia; NPC doctor, more or less; secondary pilot to Ash and Calbo, as well as replacement for if a character dies.\n\nThe other characters will be explained when they come up.\n\n[CRAWL]\n\nDESPERATION\n\nThe crew of THE DUSTY TROLLOP are desperate. Their contacts have all but dried up thanks to the JEDI CIVIL WAR. Having called in their last favor, the crew makes their way to The Smuggler's Moon, NAR SHADDAA, in order to meet a new ally that can hopefully find them work.\n\nMeanwhile, JEDI PADAWAN JACKIE MILGIL has arrived on NAR SHADDAA as well in order to secure safe passage to the planet ERIADU, an Outer Rim planet under the control of THE SITH, in order to locate her master, JEDI KNIGHT ALENNIC DANSARK. Without the support of the JEDI ORDER, she is operating in secret.\n\nLittle do they know, they will soon find themselves in serious trouble...\n\n[CRAWL END]\n\n(At this point, only Calbo, Ash, Sedri, and Akuna were playing. In the next session, Bizas and Jackie got players.)\n\nWe open on The Dusty Trollop, a heavily modified Barloz class medium space freighter, exiting hyperspace and docking at a Nar Shaddaa spaceport. We see the ramp go down and the crew exits.\n\nBizas had made a Favor roll at the start in order to get a meeting with a former bounty hunter turned fixer- a Rodian that goes by Gundark. They were to meet him in the Tarr'Tarr Jekk, the sister cantina to the Jekk'Jekk Tarr. They arrived without incident and found Gundark shortly afterward. Calbo ended up threatening him without realizing it and ended up with a heavy blaster in his face- followed by raucous laughter that he joined in on. After a bit more roleplaying and endearing themselves to Gundark, he mentions that he's got the perfect job for them. \"A real blue milk run\" as he puts it.\n\nAll he needs the crew to do is to escort this Coruscantian (Coruscantan?) rich kid to Eriadu. The payday is around 5,000 credits altogether. Simple enough job for a simple enough pay. At this point, Jackie arrives and Sedri perceives that she is Force Sensitive- but doesn't immediately out her. Calbo haggles a bit with the price, managing to secure three favors from Jackie that can be called in at any time.\n\nAfter finalizing the deal, the group is startled to see a small group of Sith and some merc-looking types come in. Jackie immediately asks for help to be hidden- she mentioned that she got into a fight shortly after getting to Nar Shaddaa earlier, having disarmed and killed her attacker. The group accepts this for now and Calbo, using his small make-up kit and some food and drink (for texture) to disguise Jackie. Rolled a 27 total for the check.\nohshitson.jpg\n\nThe crew, with Jackie disguised as a shaven Wookie, manage to fast-talk their way out of the cantina and back to the spaceport. I had planned for a small fight and then a chase scene, but they managed to find the diplomatic and subtle solution to the problem. For a group that had never played together and was made up of generally novice roleplayers, I was very proud of them.\n\nThey then have to make an Astrogate check to reach Eriadu- their maps were way out of date and a slew of other modifiers later, they roll 1 above the DC and manage to make it to the planet with little mishap. Along the way, they roleplayed a bit more and managed to set up decent alternate identities for them all, but that's for next time.\n\nEDIT: Formatting Fix Attempt #2.\nEDIT #2: Oh crap, I forgot the name of the game in the title. It's pretty obvious and I mention it in the text, but still. Sorry about that.",

        "text": "It was silent as we flew back to base in the skyranger, it was silent as we carried Lance Corporal Donovan to the medibay where he would spend the next month and change, and it was silent until we were a couple drinks deep back in the barracks. Operation Bleeding God is what the higher ups had chosen to call it. Accurate. Except it was us doing the bleeding and not the sons of bitches higher up in the command chain who ordered us to be there.\n\nIt was a civilian rescue operation. Our first as a unit. We landed in what was formerly a military base in Russia and immediately began to work our way forward under cover. Things were going well until Lance Corporal Campbell saw a civilian and rushed forward to get him to cover. Before the rest of us even knew what was happening, four [chryssalids](http://hornshaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/XCOM-EU_Chryssalid.jpg) had burst out of the burning warehouse behind the civilian and had Campbell against the wall. A couple of us got off grenades and a few shots, but it wasn’t enough to take all four of them out. One of them eviscerated him and left him to die in a pool of acid and his own vomit while the other one tore the poor civy apart.\n\nIt was our first time seeing those freakish creatures so after the initial rain of gunfire died down, Specialist Tabet panicked, running straight towards the freaks and collapsing next to the puddle that used to be LCrp Campbell.\n\nOur sniper, Lance Corporal Bose was the first to properly react, and she blew the hell out of the insect that had just finished ripping off the civilians head. Betweem our medic Schwarzkopf, LCrp Donovan, and I, we managed to finished off the other.\n\nBefore we’d even finished reacting to the shitshow that had just happened, our dead squadmate’s corpse got back up and ripped off Tabet’s head who was hunkered down right next to it. The civy got back up too. I’ll never forget how Bose was the one who saved all our asses. She took out one all on her own as the other three of us put our friend back down for good.\n\nI’ve never seen two soldiers work more in sync with one another than Schwarzkopf and Bose did the rest of that op. Shit had started bad, and it just got worse. The majority of the civies were too far out for us to get to them in time. In the process of trying, LCrp Donovan and I both took some significant hits from a clusterfuck of fourteen [floaters](http://images.gamersyde.com/image_xcom_enemy_unknown-19205-2418_0001.jpg) that surprised us. Schwarzkopf was running through heavy plasma fire with his medkit patching us up. Then Donovan turned a corner too fast and ran straight into three rounds of plasma. Somehow Schwarzkopf even managed to piece Donovan together and then turned around to take down two floaters himself to give the rest of us time to get over there and cover him dragging Donovan to safety.\n\nI must have killed about five myself, but Bose had me far outstretched. She singlehandedly killed eight floaters and was responsible for keeping Schwarzkopf and I from getting flanked and poked full of a few new breathing holes multiple times.\n\nAt the end of the op, there were eighteen confirmed ET kills, two dead XCOM operatives, and three rescued civilians. It was one of the worst operations I’ve ever been a part of. Also, somehow I was the only one who got a promotion despite the fact that Bose and Schwarzkopf saved the rest of our lives more times than I can count.\n\nYou know how some stories you save for telling rookies, and some you save for sharing with other veterans after you’ve both had a few too many to drink? This one had some of both. You tell it to the rookie to let him know exactly why you never go running straight towards a civilian, and you tell it to a veteran because he understands that sometimes, XCOM just makes no goddamn sense, and the man who least deserves the promotion, gets it.\n\nRest in Peace Spec Tabet, LCrp Campbell, and the fifteen civilians who we couldn’t reach in time.\n",

        "text": "Through an interesting and slightly...very illegal turn of events, our party found ourselves directly involved in the summoning of a demon to destroy a Dwarven city. The evil players (Jack Goff the fighter,Thea the druid, D-Man the (shitty) sorcerer, and Ron Jeremy the Wandering Wood Wizard) arranged a deal with the demon: he spares their lives if they assist him in destroying the city and completing the mission bestowed upon him by the fuccboi necromancer who we fucked the fuck up. Meanwhile, the not-so-evil players (Shoelace Cagspur the monk of Ra, Adotomol the retarded half-orc barbarian, and myself (ACHTUNG VERNHEIMER VON DUNKELHAUSEN the bard con-man)) fled to the city itself in order to set up defences. The heads of the city sounded the ancient evacuation alarm, causing the thousands upon thousands of citizens to begin bottlenecking out the only exit of the city: the front gate, where the four evildoers were making their way into the city. Us three anti-demon folk found our way the cemetery where we began formulating what the hell to do. First, since the city was in panic and we needed supplies to kill a fucking demon (we're level 4-5), a bit of looting was in order. Shoelace headed for an alchemist's shop and grabbed tons of health potions, as well as two alchemist fires and two *wizard's fire breath* potions. He then set up a shrine to Ra who blessed his sword.\n\nWe met up back at the cemetery while the four evils began moving inward through the fleeing crowds; Thea simply turned into a bird and flew to a jewellery shop while Jack and D-Man had to intimidate their ways through (Ron Jeremy's player is on hiatus so he was a vegetable this session). The city guards were doing the best they could to settle the crowds, but to no avail. Moreover, smoke was beginning to rise from the mines where the demon was to emerge. We were in way over our heads. But Shoelace had a spark of genius.\n\n \"Achtung, take these alchemist fires and tie each to a rope, and hang them over the front gate - also, while you're at it, try and calm the crowd so they'll get out faster. Adotomol, bring me two goats. I have an idea.\"\n\nWe exchange quizzical glances and set out. Adotomol heads over to the residential area of the city and looks for folks with livestock - most have left, but one man is having trouble with his stubborn goats. They eventually break his grasp and run away with him in pursuit, so Adotomol overtakes him and snags the goats from him.\n\n\"Hey thanks, guy! Damn things just won't listen.\"\n\n\"I borrow these. Give back to you later.\"\n\n\"...what.\"\n\n\"Hey, hey, look at me. I'm the shepherd now.\" *walks off with goats\n\n\"god FUCKING damn it!\"\n\nAdotomol heads back towards the cemetery with the two goats while I'm making my way towards the gate. At first I was hopping across rooftops to avoid the crowds but hit a pickle when the buildings were just carved into the walls of the mountains. So I ghost-sounded my way through the crowd and eventually passed Jack and D-Man, who at this point had resorted to much more violent methods of moving through. Eventually, I make it to the gate and climb to the top. At this point I've realized Shoelace's plan: lour the demon under the gate and drop the fire on him. What the goats were for...that was still up for debate. But whatever, my job was done. I stand atop the gate and look into the city, and see just what kind of shitshow we had really gotten ourselves into.\n\nTo give some context: In the center of this city is a MASSIVE mine quarry. Which also doubles as a prison. Which is ALSO where the demon is coming from. The smoke we saw wasn't from the demon's grand entrance show, it was from a prison break he started. As I stand on the city's gate I watch as a demon and THOUSANDS of prisoners go to town on the crowds of bottlenecking dwarven citizens and vastly overpowered guards. The gate-trap plan shattered. I bolt back into the city. Over by the mines, Shoelace and Adotomol (still carrying two goats) made their way towards the massive fighting from one direction while Jack and D-Man (and eventually Thea) approach from the other - the two groups are roughly a mile apart. Jack, D-Man, and Thea's objective are to help the demon, and also they're escaped convicts (my doing, actually), so they clash with guards. Meanwhile, Shoelace and Adotomol want to make their way to the demon, but in their path stands a massive mob of (magically) angry prisoners. But Shoelace knows a way through: the goats.\n\nThose *wizard's fire breath* potions Shoelace picked up earlier: I think they're a homebrew my friend made in our other campaign(correct me if I'm wrong), but our party had a run-in with it before: You drink it, and out your mouth spurts a GIANT cone of fire that does retarded amounts of damage. It also singes your throat and innards, hurting you and making you mute. Shoelace, always loving the sound of his own voice, wanted to use these potions on the demon, but obviously he didn't want to drink them himself. Enter goats. Adotomol hoists up one of the goats, breaks its legs to make it scream, dumps the potion down its throat, and aims it at the mob of prisoners.\n\n\"Baahaaahaa**GRAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUGH**\"\n\nAdotomol is using this goat as a fucking flamethrower. The evil group see and hear a huge burst of fire even from where they are. After a few blinding seconds, the goat's stomach explodes dealing 11 damage to Adotomol. The smoke and guts clear and it is revealed that he just parted the Red Sea. Everyone is silent. He and Shoelace prance through the aisle of ash they just created towards the demon. Along the way Adotomol spots the owner of the goats and throws the charred carcass at him.\n\n\"I give back. You welcome.\"\n\n\"God FUCKING damn it!\"\n\nThe battle picks back up but Adotomol and Shoelace have gotten close enough to attack the demon from range. Shoelace turns to Adotomol and says:\n\n\"You know what to do.\"\n\nApparently yeah he did, because Adotomol shoves his dick into the goat's ass, ties its leash around his waist like a belt, snaps its legs and dumps the potion, and points it at the demon. \n\n\"Baahaahaa**GRAAAAUUUUUUGGH**\"\n\nAdotomol thrusts and thrusts as fire spurts from his goatfleshlight and engulfs the demon in his sizzling inferno of shame. This was enough to anger and distract the demon just so, and a full-fledged attack was waged. The demon was eventually defeated after a cleverly placed bag of holding by yours truly, a betrayal by Jack Goff, and the blessings of Ra. Ron Jeremy and D-Man perished, but the day was ultimately won all thanks to the goat flamethrowers.",

For the second session, I had Tomb of Moving Stones slated but was worried that there wasn't enough content for a four hour time slot.\n\nI decided to create set the session on Highharvestide, with Red Larch throwing the biggest festival in valley. I sent the players a copy of the [Red Larch Gazette](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IYOFwGmjn-NoFPncCpkwI_C_5ihBtoqPzVgMiIWaras/edit?usp=sharing) in advance and it contained lots of info and foreshadowing. Pertinent info included:\n\n* Cookoff between the towns main poultry providers\n* Kids from Womford created chaos at the last festival\n* Judges are in town from Waterdeep, gathering data for 'Best Village of the North' contest\n* Battle of the Bards with a cash prize\n\nWhile running around town, two players spotted Womford boys sneaking into the back of a local tavern. They caught the punks adding laxative to a keg of ale, meant for the feast later that day. Our heroes let the kids go with a scolding, after forcing them to drink the remaining laxative.\n\nThe crew convinced our Bard to sign up for the Battle of the Bards and he choreographed a reenactment of the battle that led to Lance Rock (local mythology). There was an interpretive dance and of course heavy use of the Rain Stick (our Bard's instrument). The performance was a huge hit and the the group won the contest; it helped that the Rogue had tampered with the competitors instruments.\n\nAs the towns ovation subsided, there were tremors in the earth and a massive sinkhole opened up across the square. This led the players on to the Tomb of Moving Stones - a story for another time.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "From the Journals of Rufus Sweineke, 1893:\n\n   The events of the last weeks have left me shaken, doubtful even of my sanity, and yet, if there is any truth in my memories, they must be recorded, that some warning may be left for the future, even though I fear that any knowledge may be more dangerous than beneficial.  I have been prevailed upon to make this recording in blood, that it might be proof against the horrible corruption of words and letters that I have seen and struggled against, though I must admit I quailed at the thought of draining myself for such.  I hope the pig's blood I have purchased will be equally effective.\n\nMy travails began some four weeks ago, innocuously enough.  George Hall came to visit my bookshop, a regular customer, who rarely went more than a week without stopping by.  Mr Hall was an intelligent man and a bachelor like myself, and often had need of my skills in obtaining this or that obscure volume.  He had recently been taken with the notion of printing as a hobby, perhaps even to publish a sort of personal local journal of the sort that are sometimes popular.  When he arrived in my shop that day in late March, he seemed excited.  He did not stay long, only told me that his newest project was close to bearing fruit, and then gave into my keeping a spread of a newsprint.  I assumed at the time that they were his own work, though he quickly corrected me of the notion, and when I began to read the spread in question I could why he would be eager to disabuse me of his authorship.  The “Great Lakes Times” was an awful publication, a sort of Democratic rag, spewing racial vitriol and full of grammatical errors.  Of course I asked Mr Hall what on earth could be his interest in such a hateful publication.  He then drew my attention to certain qualities of the print, the format, and such which he found worthy, though I could hardly agree.  In fact, even then, I conceived of a sort of unsettling feeling when gazing upon the Great Lakes Times, and quickly put it away.  I promised Mr Hall that I would keep it for his sake, though I had no interest in carrying such an awful piece of trash.  He seemed satisfied, and went on his way.  It was to be the last time I ever saw him.\n\nAt first, I was unconcerned with Mr. Hall's absence.  It was not entirely unusual, nor was it inconceivable that he should take a trip, or be ill, or otherwise occupied, though he had hardly failed to stop by the shop on a weekly basis in the last fifteen years.  So it was not until fully two weeks had passed since his visit that I truly began to worry.  In the meantime, something about the Great Lakes Times continued to bother me.  I found myself going back over the pages, for all their poorly conceived invective, Mr Hall was correct... there was something about the print.  If only I had left it.  If only I had destroyed the accursed document then.\n\t\nI began to notice discrepancies.  From reading to reading, the Great Lakes Times seemed to subtly change.  Though I could hardly be asked to tell one article from another, so full of unequivocally slurious hate they were, I began to sense that they did not always fall in the same place on the spread.  Misspellings I noticed in one reading seemed to be corrected in another, or moved to different sentences.  As Mr Hall's disappearance grew longer and I began to worry, I turned to this hateful document as some sort of possible clue to his whereabouts.  \n\nTwo facts remained consistent through my readings:  The Great Lakes Times was published in a town called Garreth's Landing, of which I had never before heard, and the articles were almost exclusively published by one “Guy Manson”, an obvious pseudonym.  Though I was disturbed by the strangely fluid contents of the newspaper, I was as of yet undaunted.  Sweineke and Son has specialized in the antique and unusual for many long years.  Though this was the first time I had heard of such strangeness being associated with a newsprint, it was not outside of the scope of my belief to think that I had stumbled across some profound mystery, and so of course I reached out to Mr King. \n\nThe Occult Book Store of Detroit had seen some trouble recently.  Everyone of course will be aware of the incident earlier this winter, which had been cited by the local news sources as an attempted robbery, unrelated to the shop's occult nature, which had somehow spiraled into a gunfight.  It garnered them a certain amount of celebrity, which they seemed very much to regret.  I had hardly heard from Mr King in the months since, though that was not surprising, since we were hardly regular correspondents before.  Never-the-less, my letter of inquiry was promptly answered by his secretary, and a meeting was arranged.\n\nThe very next Tuesday, I took myself along with the foul document across town.  I was very much surprised when I found that Mr King was not in residence at all, and I was greeted by two women.  Miss Persephone Clarke was Mr King's secretary,  a young, bookish woman with a somewhat haunted aspect.  I remembered that she had been rather directly involved in the incident some months prior.  The other lady was a mysterious oriental named Miss Wong.  She seemed to be a close friend of Miss Clarke, and claimed to also have been involved with the events leading up to the shooting at the Occult Book Store.  In fact, looking back, I would think she may very well have been responsible for some of the gunfire.\n\nThe two ladies assured me that Mr King was not at all well, but that they could certainly assist me.  When I described the curious nature of the Great Lakes Times, and showed it to them, they both turned very pale, and began to tell me a story which at the time, I could hardly credit to be true.\n\nThey claimed to have come into possession of a powerful occult book entitled *The Vagueries of the Universe*.  I had never heard of it before, and was tempted to dismiss it, as it sounded like some progressive astronomical treatise or the like, but Miss Clarke recounted how the text of that book had been nearly unreadable, and altered and flowed even as one looked on it.  Furthermore, this tome seemed to infect the printed material around it, leaking its fluidity like a sort of literary plague.  I could not deny that the story seemed to fit.  Perhaps this newspaper had once come into contact with the tome they spoke of.  They claimed to have disposed of the book, though they seemed uncertain of its total destruction.   Both seemed loathe to speak of their dealings with it in any detail, and I gathered that they had lost a friend in the ordeal.  Despite their dire warnings that I leave off any further investigation, and give up Mr Hall for dead, my curiosity was piqued.\n\nUpon returning to my shop, however, I received a dreadful shock.  While sorting through the papers in my office, the latest batch of receipts caught my attention. There was something unaccountable wrong  with them.  The numbers did not add up.  To be sure, no one had purchased four thousand dollars worth of books from my humble store.  As I checked, and double checked, I became aware that the inconsistencies themselves did not stay constant!  It was at that moment that I became to fully believe the tale told to me, and I fell into a kind of madness.  I burned the receipts in the waste-paper bin, emptied my safe of all written material, and locked the Great Lakes Times within. I then began a frantic inspection of my stock.  You can imagine my panic, as a bookseller, the threat to the solidity, the permanence of written language, was somewhat jarring.  \n\nI had been at this for perhaps an hour when Miss Wong arrived.  When I told her of my discovery of the infection of my receipts, she rushed to my office.  Using a steel hairpin, she inscribed a kind of sigil into the front of my safe, a warding symbol which she claimed would contain the evil power of the document inside.  She then told me that she and Miss Clarke had discovered a horrifying possibility:  that it was not merely a single issue of the Great Lakes Times that was infected by proximity to the Vagueries of the Universe, but rather a printing press that had become corrupted!  Every copy of the horrible publication would then bear this same, maddening taint!  Incised by the possibility, I immediately offered whatever aid I could in finding and ending its source.\n\nMiss Wong suggested that the content of the Great Lakes Times might appeal to some of the strongly Democratic minded citizens of the city.  Indeed, she said that the offensive and racist sentiments of the rag were a near echo to some of the opinions published in the Detroit Free Press.  She proposed that I might undertake a sort of scouting mission, going to one of the Democratic Party's local meetings, and seeing if anyone there had heard of the Great Lakes Times.\n\t\nAs unpleasant as the prospect was, I could find no fault with the strategy.  As fortune would have it, there was a meeting taking place only a few blocks away that very afternoon.  I girded myself for the ordeal.\n\nThe meeting hall was full to bursting with bearded men in suits and top hats.  The air was thick with the smoke of cigars and the smell of brandy, and voices were raised all around.  I was greeted nearly at once by a Mr Neil Brookfeild, who seemed to be a person of some importance.  He claimed to take especial interest in new faces, and I was able to convince him that I was a local citizen, concerned with the direction of the city.  He seemed pleased enough with that, and entreated me to listen to the gathering.  \n\t\nThere were several speakers, all of whom seemed to talk at once.  There was much invective directed towards the good Mayor, but these gentlemen seemed to me to have very little productive to say.  They were soon drawn into a lengthy discussion about a Mr. Goddard's new Automobile, and I was free to quietly circle around, asking after the Great Lakes Times.  \n\nI was eventually directed to a Mr George Sumpter, an editor with the Free Press.  He was indeed aware of the Great Lakes Times, and to my dismay, claimed that he was even considering in collaborating with the author, the horrible “Guy Manson”!  He told me to speak again to Mr Brookfeild for more information.  Brookfeild was eager to tell me more, even giving me a more recent edition of the awful publication, which I could hardly refuse.  He did however also give me an address, from which a subscription might be obtained.  I thanked him, and as quickly as seemed socially polite (though it seemed an eternity) I made my exit.\n\nThat evening I met once again with Miss Wong and Miss Clarke at the Occult Book Store.  They had not themselves been idle, and had—through means I chose not to ask after—obtained access to Mr Hall's post office box.  The fruits of their work included another copy of the same edition of the Great Lakes Times given to me by Brookfeild.  Side by side, the unsettling nature of the documents were even more pronounced, as it was clear that while superficially similar, and bearing the same date of publication, and even many of the same articles, the two were not the same.  Furthermore, the feeling of wrongness was intensified, and I thought I could even see a subtle motion in the print, an eagerness to rearrange itself into the characters of madness. \n\t\nWorst of all was one of the letters also obtained from Mr Hall's box.  It was one of my own.  A regular newsletter of the sort I periodically send out to my regular clients.  To my horror, I found that it was gravely altered, advertising titles which I knew with certainty were not in my shop, titles in some cases of which I had never before heard!  The scale and scope of this monstrous brutality to the stuff on which I have made my life—the written word—grew in my brain, and I am afraid to say that I was overcome.  I remember nothing of the next several minutes, as thoughts of horror filled my brain.  What awful fate must have befallen George Hall?  To what dark insanity might prolonged exposure to these corrupted things lead?  When I came to myself, I was crouched under a desk with a taste of wood-pulp in my mouth.  It seems in my madness I had devoured the letter which caused me so much grief.  But out of that madness and grief loomed an awful certainty.  There were answers to be found with George Hall.\n\nBefore departing, the ladies informed me that they had found other information as well.  Garreth's Landing, the town from which the Great Lakes Times claimed to hail, was out on the western coast of the state, in lands fairly recently purchased from the indians. Furthermore, they told me that in their last encounter with the corruption of the Vagueries, they had gained some succor from certain charms, taken from the Grimoir of Pope Annorious, a book with which I had some passing familiarity.  They showed me how to fashion a protective amulet by scratching a symbol into the back-casing of my pocket watch.  The experience was a strange one.  The words they had me speak over the symbol, and the drop of my blood which was to seal the charm made me feel light-headed, and my stomach was still queasy from consuming the letter.  I still have no real proof of the efficacy of these amulets, but I will admit that its presence comforted me as we set out. \n\nI knew roughly in which part of town he lived, and after a short ride by carriage and a few questions, Miss Wong, Miss Clarke and I arrived at the residence of Mr George Hall.  It was a small, well kept house towards the edge of the city, though even the dusk light showed that it was in an obvious state of neglect.  There was no answer to our knocks, but when Miss Wong turned the handle, it opened easily.  The gas was still on, though none of the lamps were lit.  Mr Hall's house seemed entirely that of an ordinary well-to-do bachelor.  I had never asked what he did, and there seemed to be little evidence of any profession about his abode.  All was orderly, if somewhat dusty, reflecting some weeks of neglect. In the dinning room, which he had made into his study, we found the first signs of Mr Hall's last project.\n\nAcross the table were spread several copies of the Great Lakes Times, some of them so warped that they no longer seemed to be intelligible.  Along with them were several books.  I admit, I was expecting something far more occult, some eldritch tome of magic that Mr Hall had used to plumb the mysteries of these documents, but they were far more mundane, if rather unusual.  The most prominent, laying open close to chair that seemed the focal point of the arrangement, was a book of cryptography that I had sold Mr Hall myself.  It was an usual work, containing a great deal of history, as well as theory and mathematics.  A single glance told me that it had suffered from proximity to the Great Lakes Times.  The others were mostly books of mathematics, geometry, and calculus. Scattered across it all were sheaves of hand-written notes, but these were utter unreadable.  Their characters were strange, even to the oriental Miss Wong, and we assumed that it must have been some personal code Mr Hall had used to conceal the nature of his work, or else they were so corrupted by proximity to the newspapers that they had been reduced to gibberish.  We collected them none-the-less, and I trepiditiously copied down the titles of the books Mr Hall seemed to have been working from.\n\n\t\nThe rest of the house revealed little of interest.  We found no signs of violence, and no signs of departure, swift or premeditated. It was as if Mr Hall had simply vanished.  In his bedroom, Miss Wong discovered a curious charm hanging from the bedpost.  To me it resembled a half-finished bird's nest, or perhaps one of those indian charms they call dream-catchers.  A rough circle of sticks was intersected by a number of other twigs.  It seemed innocuous enough, but we could make nothing of it, not even Miss Clarke with her extensive knowledge of the occult.\n\nWe were about to take our leave, when Miss Clarke noticed that there seemed to be a light on in the basement that had escaped our attention before.  Consulting each other, we affirmed that none of our party had ventured downstairs, and so it was with great caution that we proceeded.  Miss Wong produced a revolver, and I felt quite ill at ease.\n\nI called down the stairs several times, but got no response, and so ventured down.  The illumination came from a single gas-lamp, burning at its lowest setting.  As I looked about, I was beheld the east-facing wall, and was filled with dread.  Across the stone pavers were pasted countless copied of the Great Lakes Times, cut and shredded, and full of oily, fluid wrongness.  They were arranged in a way that was instantly recognizable, like in form the the crude stick-charm that we found near Mr. Hall's bed.  Seated on the floor in front of this dire symbol were four metal lanterns, and a small wooden bowl.  I was spellbound when the two women came down the stairs behind me... at which point confusion broke out.\n\nSomething in the nature of the symbol caused violent distress in both my companions.  Miss Clarke collapsed, raving that she could not see, a fit of some sort of hysterical blindness.  Miss Wong, to my dismay, began firing her revolver wildly into the wall, quickly exhausting its chambers.  When I tried to gently take the weapon from her, she kicked me into a corner, spilling the contents of the wooden bowl across my shoes and trousers.  The bowl was full of thick, congealed blood.\n\nAfter several minutes, when we all had regained our composure, we tried to determine the nature of what was obviously some horrible ritual.  The lanterns, it seemed, were designed to cast a certain pattern of shadows across the symbol on the wall, creating another layer of light over top of it.  I attempted to light them, but my hands were still shaky, and I knocked them rather badly out of place.  Whatever meaning might have been revealed was lost.  Miss Clarke was clever enough to suggest that we might take copies of the lantern's designs, and study them later.  We all agreed that we had had quite enough for the day, and went our separate ways, agreeing to meet again at the Occult Book Store the next morning. \n\nSurprisingly, I slept well and deeply, untroubled by dreams.  In the morning, I had quite forgotten the ordeal of the day before, and went about my regular routine.  I was just sitting down to a quiet breakfast when I noticed a letter that had been slid beneath my door.  It was a curious thing, of antique design, the sort that has no real envelope, but is merely folded across itself.  There was no post-mark or address, only my name written across the back in an antique hand. \n \nUpon opening the missive, I was dismayed to see a sheaf of writhing symbols, far more motile than anything I had yet beheld in my dealings with the Great Lakes Times.  They meant nothing to me at first, yet I could not wrench my gaze from them.  There seemed to be layers and layers of them, flickering like a magic-lantern show.  Slowly, a sort of vision began form in their midst.\n\t\nI saw myself, standing alone, surrounded by books.  I looked old, and very alone.  Vague figures began to swirl about me, vital, lively figures, that made me long for the sons that I never had—shall never have.  Out of there lively tumult, one figure began to rise taller, standing above me, shadowing me with his legacy... I knew it to be my father.\n\nHow long I sat transfixed by that page, I do not know.  Hours, certainly.  It was after noon when Miss Clarke and Miss Wong pounded open my door, breaking the spell.  I tried to conceal the letter, but Miss Wong spotted it, and recognized it.  It seems both ladies, and some of their other companions, had also received similar letters.  They had attempted, and been unable to to destroy them, and they recommended that my letter, like theirs, be placed within the pages of Pope Annorious's spellbook, where it might be kept powerless.  After some consideration, I acquiesced.\n\nWe then began the work of deciphering what information we had so far gathered.  Miss Clarke and I did our best to determine the proper symbol projected by the lanterns, but met with little success.  All we could discover is that it seemed to be a very regular and mathematical shape, something like the arc of a parabola or spiral, but bent and fractured and overlayed in unsettling ways.  We supposed that without the newspapers arranged underneath, the shadow symbol meant as little on its own as the newspapers meant without the shadow, and truth be told, we were not eager to place the two together.\n\nWe moved on to Mr Hall's notes, and there we made several interesting discoveries.  After several hours of study, we determined that this was no simple substitution code.  While there was a clear pattern and grammar at work, it was beyond either of our comprehension.  What was more astonishing though, was that Hall's notes, as strange as they seemed, were utterly static.  No trace of the corruption seemed to be upon them.  As uncommunicative as the figures were to us, they stayed to their places, a vast relief after so much uncertainty.  Miss Clarke theorized that perhaps this was some alien language, imbued with mystical properties that resisted the contamination.  It seemed absurd to me, but I was in no place to discount it.\n\nIn the meantime, Miss Wong had not been idle. She first sent a letter to the address we had found for Guy Manson, the supposed editor of the Great Lakes Times.  She then questioned Mr. Hall's neighbors, and was able to ascertain that the last time he was seen was a mere day after he had put the dreadful newspapers into my hands.  He had not been seen leaving his house, had given no word to any friend, and had no relatives that we could discover.  The completeness and mysteriousness of his disappearance was most unsettling.\n\nWhile we waited for a reply the Miss Wong's letter, Miss Clarke and I continued to puzzle after Mr Hall's notes, but with little success.  We both found that looking too long at the strange characters caused us uncomfortable headaches.  \n\nIt was a week later that we finally heard a response form Guy Manson.  It was very brusque, and offered little in the way of enlightening information, but it included another edition of the Great Lakes Times, full of the same vitriolic invective, and the same infectious curse.\n\nHall's notes, for now, were a dead end.  We felt we had few choices.  Either re-create the ritual in Hall's basement, or else travel to Garreth's Landing, and confront Mr Manson.  Not knowing what the ritual might do to us, we opted to go, reasoning that at least Mr Manson seemed to be nothing more than a hateful man, perhaps even ignorant of the real danger that his distasteful publication was spreading.\n\nThe train ride to Garreth's Landing took most of the day, and we ended the trip with a bone-jarring jaunt in a motor-car into the village.  Garreth's Landing was a small town, rather close the to lake shore, and consisted of little more than a general store, a post office, and a smattering of houses next to a modest jetty.  Though we asked a number of people, no-one had heard of Guy Manson, nor even the Great Lakes Times.  At the post office, however, we found out more information.  A very helpful postman told us that the owner of Guy Manson's box came to collect his mail on a very regular basis, and in fact should be in to do so any minute.  We waited with some anticipation.\n\nI no longer recall what sort of a man I expected Guy Manson to be, but the sallow, unhealthy looking character who stumped brusquely into the office was shocking to see.  His hair was ragged, and he was wrapped in a stinking coat on the verge of unseaming itself.  Through a ruse, Miss Wong was able to bump against him and obtain one of his letters; a piece of correspondence with one of the readers of the Great Lakes times.  It told us very little we did not already know.\n\nWhile Miss Clarke and I waited an uncomfortable hour in the local tavern, Miss Wong followed this unsavory character.  While we waited, I asked in idle curiosity how the town had come by its name.  The barman told me an unusual tale.  He claimed that, according to legend, long ago, someone—or something—named Garreth had crawled up out of the lake here.  It was supposed to be some sort of monstrous fish, and you could still see the long sandy swathe were it had hauled its bulk ashore.  The native Indians had slain the creature, and constructed their homes out of its bones, and lived and fished here for many years, until the land was purchased from them.  The barman laughed, dismissing the tale as folk-lore and nonsense, yet it gave me a shudder to think of some primeval hulk dashing its sodden body from the waves, only to be set upon by the ancient savages of the land.  So enraptured was I with this strange tale that I was much surprised when Miss Wong returned in something of a state.\n\nShe had followed Mr Manson north along the road following the lake shore, and into the woods.  There she had seen him enter a house, but had become frightened by the sound of wings above her head, and fled back to town.  Such timidity seemed uncharacteristic of Miss Wong, and I tried to comfort her, supposing it to be merely an owl.  After a while, she calmed herself, and suggested that we obtain rooms for the night.  The hour having grown late, this seemed like a sensible suggestion, and the friendly barman pointed us to the local hostel.\n\nThe hostel-keep was an elderly lady named Mrs Nice, who offered us a pair of rooms for a quite modest sum.  Though there were entirely serviceable, I found I could not sleep.  The entire situation seemed unreal, and I sat up, pacing and smoking long into the night, fingering the carved charm on the back case of my watch.  \n\nIt was well after midnight when I heard a most unusual sound coming from outside.  It was like a bird call, or the bellow of a cow, but somehow bone-chilling and phlegmy.  At first I dismissed it as some local nightbird, but as the call repeated itself, I heard sounds of wakefulness from the women in the adjoining room.  I timidly tapped on their door, asking if they could see anything amiss.  Miss Clarke hurriedly opened the door, and through their window across the green, I beheld a most horrible sight.\n\nHigh up in a towering tree, too large to have bothered clearing for the village, stood a figure, pale in the moonlight.  It was shaped like a man, but long curved horns spread from its brow, and a long sinuous tail switched back and forth behind it, and two leathery wings were spread above it.  It seemed to be the very shape of the devil!  I had no more than a moment to observe it, when it dived straight into our window!\n\nFor long horrible moments, all was chaos.  Foolishly, I had left my revolver back in my own room, so in haste I grabbed up a lamp and attempted to belabor the horrible creature.  It had grabbed ahold of Miss Wong, and though she grappled with it, it seemed to get the best of her, working towards her with its dreadful tail.  Then Miss Clarke began to shoot at it with her own pistol.  It was distracted enough that Miss Wong was able to win free, and add her own firearm's report to the uproar.  Though at the last, the thing turned and fled, some last shot clipped its wings, and it plummeted to the earth, stone dead.\n\nOf course the broken silence of this small village attracted attention.  The thing laying outside of the hostel baffled both the sheriff and the doctor, and a general uproar ensued.  Looking at the thing lying there upon the earth, leaking terrible ichor, I was put in mind of Miss Wong's complaint of the sound of wings outside of Manson's house, and I felt a sickening feeling in my stomach.  In vain, we tried to convince the sheriff to follow us out to the house in the woods, but he refused.  The only help we garnered was that of Mrs Nice's son, Teddy, who lived with her in the attic of the hostel.  Though he is not that much younger than myself, Teddy seems very much a child, and armed himself with an antique saber, which he waved about somewhat awkwardly.  \n\t\nWith great trepidation, we made our way to Manson's dwelling.  Though I jumped at every small sound, and flinched at every imagined sound of wings, our way was unchallenged.  Manson's home was a bare hovel, a shack in the wilderness, and all seemed dark, save for a bright light coming from the sole basement window.  Miss Wong, ever capable, moved stealthily across the yard to peer into the window.  Whatever she saw must have horrified her, for the next thing I knew, shots broke the night once more as she began to fire wildly through the window.  Knowing it might be with good cause, Miss Clarke and I ran to assist her, adding our own firepower.\n\nThe scene through the shattered window was a strange one.  Kneeling on the floor was the person we knew only as Guy Manson.  He sat between four lanterns, carved in dreadfully familiar shapes.  Before him stood a figure which defied comprehension.  It, like the monster we had so recently felled, was shaped in form something like a man, but there all comparison ended.  It seemed to be composed of writhing shadow, and its motion sickened my stomach.  Manson seemed to be conversing with the thing, and between the blasts of gunfire, fragments of speech could be heard, guttural and alien, in a way that made the ears uncomfortable to hear, and filled the soul with loathing.\n\nBut it was visible only for an instant.  One shot, and then another struck Manson, and he toppled forward, towards the writhing shape, which leapt forward and wrapped him in an embrace.  With the suddenness of an explosion, darkness fell.\n\t\nWhen we regained our courage enough to enter the house, we found no lamps, no gas-lights... but most unusually, I discovered what appeared to be an electrical light-switch upon the wall.  When I pressed it, the whole shack hummed with the energy.  It was unthinkable that such a tiny dwelling, so far out into the woods, so far from any real city, could have electric lights.  The single room revealed little, messy as it was, and so we once again descended into the basement, terrified of what we might find. \n\t\nTo our relief, all was quiet.  Of Manson and the horrible shadow, there was no sign.  As I feared, on the wall was a near exact replica of the pattern we had so recently encountered in Mr Hall's basement, only in addition to the pasted newspapers and lanterns, there seemed to be a third, deeper layer that was carved into the stone of the wall itself.  It revulsed and horrified the senses, and poor Teddy went nearly mad, shredding the papers off the walls till his fingers were bloody.\n\t\nOn the opposite wall, just as we had feared, stood the press, stacks of a newly printed edition of the Great Lakes Times set about it.  But as we examined the device and house, a further terror beset us.  We could find no generator.  No wires or lines, buried or otherwise, came into the building.  Instead, everything led back to the press, and a sealed iron box in its heart.  \n\t\nWhat manner of terrible science Manson had unlocked to power his hateful press, we will hope never to know.  Besides the warped editions of the Great Lakes Times, we discovered one thing more... a journal, bound in leather, filled with the same mysterious writing as poor George Hall's notes.  It now seemed only too clear what had befallen my friend, snatched away perhaps by the same horrible shadow that in the end had swallowed Manson as well.  The journal we kept, but everything else, we destroyed.  Teddy and I took a sledge hammer to the basement wall, knocking out the accursed symbol, with Miss Clarke and Miss Wong gathered all the remaining firewood from the hearth, and liberally soaked the house in kerosene.  I threw the match in myself. \n\t\nWe watched the fire burn until dawn, hoping it was hot enough to thoroughly destroy, or forever bury the terrible secrets of Manson's Press.  Amidst the chaos in Garreth's Landing, with the terrible beast, there was never an inquiry as far as I have heard.  The monster that we slew, at last was determined to be some sort of large bird, a goose or a swan, supposedly damaged and mutated by exposure to electrical lines.  A convenient falsehood to keep panic from spreading.\n\t\nMiss Clarke, Miss Wong, and myself have journeyed back to Detroit, and I have burned every remaining copy of the Great Lakes Times. It seems for now that the dreadful affair is over.  But several items still give me unrest.\n\t\nThe language of Manson's Journal, and Mr Hall's notes seems oblivious to the corrupting influence of the Press.  To be able to guard against such horror would surely be worthwhile.\n\tAnd there is still the matter of the strange letter I received, so like the others given to Miss Clarke and Miss Wong.  We know nothing of where they came from, or for what purpose they were sent to us.\n\t\nIt occurs to me that these questions may be best left unanswered, but only time will tell.\n",

On the second floor we discovered an inactivated robot and decided to boot him up. So we activated him and not a second too late because we were swarmed by a small army of synthetics. To my surprise this robot had begun dropping them left and right trying to clear this building with us and he was kicking ass with me and my partner for a solid 20 minutes until we were rummaging through the remains of the robots and a straggler jumped us. We dispatched him relatively quickly but my robotic companion then lit up red and began targeting my follower and I (he must of accidentally shot him or something) and this mother fucker just starts hunting us down through this building killing everything in its path. Slowly stalking us through the halls we ran with only the distant sounds of his animatronic voice and laser blaster in the distance. As we get cornered in a dead end I see a door in the corner of the room and once inside realize its an elevator and I frantically begin searching for the button to take us to a different floor. Arriving on the basement level and thinking we lost him we carry on until we reach the end of a long hallway and the elevator doors open. The robot just slowly steps out and starts walking towards us. My follower rushes it and gets fucked up and I sprint to the last room and shut the door. None of my guns did any real damage to it but I had some mines and grenades, so I planted the mines at the door and after a few seconds the doors fling open and I toss every piece of explosive I have at the doors and after about tens seconds of explosions everything is calm, spare the crackling of the fire and the sparks of what could only be the sparse remains of my once robotic friend. Then the robot, legs torn off from the explosion, on fire and almost beyond recognition comes crawling at me through the flames with his laser arm still attempting to fire. I put the barrel of my rifle to his head and finally put my little robot buddy out of his misery. He followed his protocols to the very end",

        "text": "I recently joined in a campign set in an alternate history version of world war 1 europe, except with magic and orcs and stuff. Seeing as a lot of the other players were going gritty and somewhat grimdark, I decided to go with something a bit more lighthearted for a character.\n\nEnter Roger Harlen, a down-on-his-luck street magician. He'd been recruited into a secret british spy agency, which did sexy spy stuff like wanton murder, getting drunk, and mass property damage. Roger was a Mesmerist, a man who dealt with influencing minds and opinions, but he was old and frankly terrible at combat.\n\nIn today's story, the secret spy base had been attacked by a shadowy organization whose name and motives were mysterious and unknown. Supposedly. It was the goddamned Inquisition, okay, we get it. Well, suffice it to say that a bunch of armed Inquisitorial G-men were patrolling the halls, stealing things that we liked having, and shooting things that we preferred that they did not shoot at. This had to be stopped. And sadly, the only team available was team Collateral Damage. So the party immediately went to work making a mockery of the faux-horror atmosphere and bickering amongst themselves about whether it was more cost-effective to dismantle our incredibly expensive equipment ourselves or let the kind men with the machine guns do it. Roger was following along, listening in, and not really contributing much to the overall discussions, as he was still new to the team.\n\nFinally, the party arrived at some Creepy Stuff^^TM and were forced into actual combat. Except that the hostiles that we had spotted were still unaware of us and rummaging through our stuff. We had the opportunity to set up one HELL of an ambush. And nearby, there was a set of observation chambers holding an extremely pissed-off Banshee.\n\n&gt; Witch: \"Wow, that Banshee looks really pissed. We probably shouldn't mess with it. If it busted out of the cage, it might kill us, and if we opened the cage, it might kill us, too.\"\n\n&gt; Roger: \"Really? Try looking again.\"\n\nRoger patted the witch on the shoulder, triggering his ability to see through other people's eyes. Then, he used the witch as a vector to cast the most powerful spell Roger had... Sow Thought. Now, the banshee had a will save of +18, which was normally a big fat NOPE to any spell you'd care to name. But Roger had been built very carefully, in order to make full use of his mental magics. The DC of a simple first level spell was a galling 21, and Roger was only at level four (though he had some help from class abilities and stat boosts, including stuff that allowed it to work on undead and machines). The banshee just BARELY failed, and roger successfully planted a little thought into the poor spirit's head, with it none the wiser.\n\nThat thought? \"The inquisition did this to me.\"\n\nWith that, everyone ducked into cover as the fireworks started. And what fireworks they were! The banshee went absolutely BALLISTIC on the unsuspecting soldiers, getting their brain-meats and various other important organs turned into a fine paste. But, sadly, we were in the Banshee's rampage path and the rest of the party needed to step up and put her down before she could wreck us, too. Thankfully, a critically wounded banshee is much easier to defeat than a fully-fledged one, and the party took it down with little trouble.\n\nThe party was now suspecting that the humble old street magician was not all that he appeared to be. But still, he hadn't done much when combat actually got underway. He was still an old man.\n\nWell, as we traveled onward, the party tank opened a door and discovered that there were some security bots inside that had been tampered with not to recognize our identification. The tank and his giant fuckoff tower shield flew back through the door amidst a hail of gunshots that would almost certainly have spelled his doom had he stood out in the open. That was bad... how would the party handle this one?\n\nRoger went up and calmly entered the door, looking the angry security bot straight in the cameras, and once more used Sow Thought on the machine's software brain. And this particular thought was \"Delete System32\".\n\n&gt; Witch: \"Roger, how in the seven hells did you manage to take on a deathbot, on your own, and unarmed?\"\n\n&gt; Roger: \"Ahh, my son showed me a few things about those 'wan-dows' computers.\"",

Everything.\n\nRolls 2d6 + 1d6 fire and 1d6 ice. crit on a 18, 19, 20. anyway....\n\nBoss time, it's a giant fucking spider or some shit. Doesn't matter. Party member had 24 alchemist fires in this bag. I tell her to throw bag into spider's mouth. It works. \n\nMy turn. I stab at mouth and activate the fire.\n\nThe spider explodes.\n\nAfter that we spend six months in a town, during which time I get the jovar enchanted to deal 2d6 + (1d6 ice, 1d6 fire, 1d6 elec).\n\nPretty much rain chaotic neutral fury over the countryside. Most problems can be solved by a +3 jovar-wielding min-maxed fighter.\n\nEventually get monkey grip, which DM agrees lets me wield the jovar in one hand. Get a spiked tower shield for the other.\n\nFriend is playing a minotaur. He manages to roll some amazing diplomacy and impregnate the local Duke's wife. Other friend is a sneaky rogue, basically invisible. \n\nLast friend is a druid who made her animal companions a pony and a tiny flying lizard. She shot ice cubes from a slight shot and was terrible.\n\nMinotaur lets his parents send him to rehab. Replace with terrible bard who fights with pirate pistols and literally missed every attack ever. Never cast a heal spell.\n\nIce-cube druid? Never cast a heal spell.\n\nFight a vampire. Tom decapitates in 1 hit.\nFight a goblin. Decapitate 3 with superior cleave.\nFight an ogre. You guessed it.\n\nThat campaign was fun, but ended in the worst possible way: fizzled out when the DM and ice-cube-girl broke up. We were in the middle of this underworld dungeon, and just stopped playing. Literally we were walking into a room or something as the final session ended, no one aware that serious shit would go down at an upcoming party.\n\nI like to think that Tom is still down there sitting with the skeletons of all the other PCs, just waiting.\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/41ivw9/shadowrun_how_to_transplant_your_team_from_one/",
        "text": "Hello again. I apologize for not posting last week, I just had some personal business to attend to. This week's session is brought to you by Renraku Suborbital Transportation Services. This will be the last post about Twitch, Kit-Kat, Sargan and Kitten: Their wacky antics have come to an end, I'm afraid. I will be starting up another series after completing this tale, situated in the sprawling heart of New Zealand. Great Leviathans, acts of terrorism and a series of unfortunate events await. But I digress, for I am getting ahead of myself.\n\nIt is fitting that the end of our story is also the beginning. In https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3y1jhe/shadowrun_how_to_kill_a_van_with_a_sword_or_why/, I mentioned that Twitch originally had another partner and that he had fallen afoul of the local law enforcement. Each member of our ensemble has had their day in the sun by this point but I feel that it is only fair to tell the tale of our very first operative. Our story takes us from the sprawling urban metropolis of Seattle to the war-torn reaches of Bogota before landing in the center of Sydney. \n\nThis is the tale of Automaton and what might have been.\n\nThis journey begins, as many do in the Sixth World, with desperation. A young woman, down on her luck and looking for her next payday, had come to a small bar named Nowhere. A comfortable hangout for underworld types that evoked the feel of the Mos Eisley Cantina, this bar was renowned for hooking runners up with well-paying jobs. They were also well known for their strawberry sunrise but it was not mixed alcohol that Layla was looking for: It was employment. The young woman was a well-trained fighter, having been privately tutored in the art of hitting people with large lengths of metal, and was looking to capitalize on her skill-set. There was always someone looking for skilled violence technicians after all.\n\nIt took about four seconds for one of the fixers present to take pity on the obviously inexperienced girl. He pulled up next to her, poured Layla a drink and asked what she was doing here. The response, that she was her to offer her services as muscle, surprised him somewhat. The girl was tall and lean, like a sprinter, but certainly did not fit the typical street samurai profile. She had even developed something of a Rabbit, shifting sightly in her chair each time. \n\nHe had intended to let her down easily, I like to think, when he notice that was idly playing the knife game while watching him. The blade clacked against the table, faster and faster, all the while Layla stared straight in the eye. There were two things of note here: This girl displayed exceptional skill with an edged weapon and she had somehow managed to smuggle said weapon past Nowhere's bouncers. In the business of fixing, sometimes you had to take a gambit and hope that it worked out. \n\nThe man, who went by the oh-so-clever moniker 'Wrench', actually had something that might be up her alley. He had a wet-working mission that needed completing and only one field operative had volunteered for it. It was good pay as long as you were alright with a bit of the old 'ultra-violence'. As it so happened, Layla was. Wrench winced, sighing. If she wanted to make a living out of shadowrunning, she would need runner name. Most people get theirs from working with a team, sort of like expendable asset initiation, but it wouldn't hurt to have her own. After a few moments deliberation, Layla Addison decided on her own moniker.\n\nRabbit.\n\nAn indescribable chill ran up Wrench's spine. At the time, it didn't make sense but looking back...Regardless, he needed to introduce her to her partner for this run. One of his best runners, the man was a precision instrument of annihilation and acquisition. He was skilled with any weapon, handy with a wrench and passable on the 'Trix. His name, Rabbit was told, was Automaton and he was a machine. Cold, calculating and incredibly paranoid. \n\nHe was, in a word, boring. It was like the Terminator crossed with Jason Bourne, lacking only a coltan-alloy endoskeleton and any semblance of a personality. His backstory was a mish-mash of ridiculousness that led to him being an almost emotionless black-ops specialist with a vengeful streak longer than the Mariana Trench. It was like the love child of angst-ridden anime characters and your traditional comic book anti-hero. \n\nIt was also my first Shadowrun character. I was young and impressionable, so I ask for some small leniency. At the time, Automaton seemed like a really interesting, almost tragic character who had the potential to be so much more. Looking back, I agree. He could have been so much more and he was tragic for a very different reason.\n\nRegardless, Automaton marched on over to this little meeting. Clad head-to-toe in matte black combat armor and equipped with the arsenal of a small nation, the runner cut an intimidating figure. Or he would have, if he wasn't hilariously out of place: Everyone else was in their casuals here, not their tactical gear. There was a quiet chuckle through the room, though it died down quick enough. Wrench offered his wet-work operative a seat, knowing that Automaton would decide to remain standing. This particular brand of runner was known as 'Dangerous-and-Paranoid'; Air filter in his helmet, camera neutralizer and chemical scanner in his armor. Still, the man got results and that was really all Wrench cared about.\n\nAfter a somewhat terse introduction, the fixer outlined this job. There was no contact to meet as the job had come through the shadownet, so Wrench would present them with the task. There would be no option to decline but the pay more than made up for that. He transmitted the data packet to Rabbit and Automaton before pouring himself a stiff drink. Even Rabbit, with her many social hang-ups and inadequacies, figured out that this was some serious business. As it turns out, she was right.\n\nThe mission was seemingly straight-forward: Locate and assassinate a man currently operating out of Bogota. The secondary part of our objective was to rescue a hostage he had taken, a young girl who was not to be harmed.  There were many problems with this but here are the biggest: First, Bogota is an active war-zone that is tenuously ruled by Aztlan (The resurgent Aztec empire, complete with sun spirits and barely-concealed blood magic). As such, travel is restricted into and out of the area. Second, the area in question was just outside of Bogota proper. This means that we would have to get to the city covertly and then haul ass out of the battle zone. The third catch was, perhaps, the most concerning of all. \n\nOur target was a cartel lord. Admittedly, he was so low ranking as to be off the list entirely but he was still high up enough to be protected. That didn't even go into the ramifications of killing someone working for the drug cartels but fuck it, we had no other options. Our professional reputation was at stake and, more importantly, so was our money!\n\nFor our first run, I think we handled the planning stage quite well. We picked up nigh water-tight SINs so that we could enter Bogota legally, with the incredibly risky cover of volunteer aid workers. Rabbit arranged for our gear to be transported via a somewhat morally-grey courier company so that it would be waiting for us when we arrived. Automaton had a series of inconceivably good rolls to locate our soon-to-be-departed friend, currently reclining in a luxurious two story home outside of Bogota. We planned a rough route to the location, agreeing to just steal a damn car when we got there. Automaton even had the forethought to plan an escape route; a small boat would be left for us at an inland dock. We would be able to follow the river out to the sea and sail our way back. \n\nWith a plan laid out and our preparations made, the duo decided to call it a night. Automaton headed home via several circuitous paths while Rabbit did her damnedest to shadow him. In the end, she actually followed him back to his home without alerting her quarry once. Like a methane-rich gaseous excretion in a tornado, Rabbit was undetectable. Until she got lost and had to knock on Automaton's door, sheepishly asking for directions. Stunned at the appearance of his erstwhile teammate, he dully offered to call her a cab and asked if she wanted a beverage while they waited. Thus begun a surprisingly strong friendship between the pair, punctuated with Rabbit's best efforts to annoy the piss out of Automaton.\n\nThe days passed quickly until their flight was due. With no contraband on them and nothing to suggest that they weren't who they said they were, Jane and John Goodman boarded a commercial airline to Bogota. The trip was decidedly more difficult given that 'John' was a nigh emotionless mercenary with little interest in helping anyone out of compassion and 'Jane' was a vibrating, barely restrained murder-beast with a penchant for mayhem. After several slip-ups on both parts, Automaton made an executive decision. The next time that Rabbit asked for a cup of soy-kaf, her ninth at that point, he would place a sleeping pill in. The inevitable request came and 'John' carried out his stealth operation...which had absolutely no effect whatsoever. Because of her extensive bioware, Rabbit was actually quite difficult to drug. Her metabolism burned through the relaxant with little difficulty, leaving the elf to enjoy her caffeine substitute. Automaton narrowed his eyes, irritation with the whole scenario quickly approaching imminent-violence levels.\n\nA slight modification was made to the stratagem and so, when the tenth cup was called for, Automaton emptied the entire packet of sleeping pills into the small, Styrofoam container. At last, blissful peace was achieved...for approximately an hour. At which point, Rabbit sprang back to life and requested an even stronger soykaf. Cue the internal screaming from our usually calm and collected shadowrunner. The rest of the trip was filled with inane questionnaires, sickeningly sweet proclamations of love for her 'dear husband' and thousands of cat GIFs. By the time they arrived in Bogota, almost nine and a half hours later, Automaton welcomed whatever the constant conflict would bring.\n\nAfter a flawless security check and a quick trip through the airport, our duo entered Aztlan territory. While the war and it's scars were kept to one side of the city, it was obviously a city besieged. Dark tendrils of smoke coiled lazily above , huddled groups of anxious people hurried through the streets and the atmosphere was tainted with a sense of discord: a palpable sensation of terror. We knew that our time spent in this hellish war-zone should be as limited as possible, so the intrepid murderers sprang into action. One stolen truck later and the pair were cruising through Bogota. Our equipment was exactly where we had been told, hidden among several shipping containers. It was easy to acquire, requiring the smallest of bribes to dock workers and a quick spot of brutality to those who refused. \n\nProperly armed, Rabbit and Automaton made a mad dash out of the city. They blasted through one of the ongoing conflicts, narrowly avoiding a shrapnel-filled end more than once. Thankfully, their heart-pounding expedition was soon over and the twosome found themselves cruising along a mostly open highway. The time was passed with Rabbit hollering along to a few local tunes and Automaton threatening anatomically impossible acts against his partner. Soon enough, they began to encroach the outskirts of this property. A long, narrow road wound around hills and descended into a small clearing. Our client's home was located at the bottom, surrounded by high walls and protected by hired guns. \n\nIt was at this point that Automaton and Rabbit realized that they hadn't actually planned this far ahead. There was no strategy in place for breaching this secure facility, of killing the Cartel Lord without attracting attention. They certainly were not expecting this shoddy road of gravel and dirt, where the lack of traction could send one careening off the edge of a tall cliff. It was a perfect use of natural resources: No one could drive quickly down the path without risking imminent defenestration, allowing the guards time to prepare for an assault. All of Automaton's careful planning was essentially useless and we had little time to prepare anything, especially in full view of whoever was watching. \n\nSeeing her calculating partner frozen with indecision, Rabbit took the reins. She slammed her foot down on top of Automaton's, sending them squealing down the worryingly slight road. Snapping back to attention, Automaton took the wheel and did his best to prevent any unfortunate drops. With the smallest amount of concern leaking through his otherwise calm demeanor, he asked if there was a plan here. Rabbit cackled loudly and replied with a surprisingly diverse number of variations for the word 'no'. With the amount of road between them and the gate dwindling with alacrity, Automaton did what he absolutely did not do best: He improvised.\n\nShouting at Rabbit to get in the back of the truck, he started desperately fishing out the grenade launcher that he had brought with them. All the while, the truck began accelerating until the frame was shaking. Sparks flew and metal squealed as the vehicle dragged along the cliffside several times but Automaton managed to keep the truck's wheels firmly on the ground. Finally locating his quarry, the runner awkwardly passed his partner the weapon. This was made more impressive by the fact that Rabbit was holding onto the truck cab with one hand, laughing manically the entire time. Automaton had no idea how she loaded the grenade launcher one handed but he had little time to care. Just as they hit the bottom of the road, Rabbit tossed her payload into the cab. It was a moment straight out of 'Karl Kombat Mage': Automaton caught it and, in a single motion, aimed out of the driver's side window and fired.\n\nA faint 'thunk' was all the hired help heard before the gate exploded, a wave of force rippling that tore through everything in it's path. The guards behind it were thrown from their feet, shrapnel tearing through their vulnerable flesh. A single thug remained standing, far enough away that the shockwave barely touched him. It was his pitiful reward for surviving such an attack that Rabbit beheaded him personally, lashing out with her mono-filament blade as she hurtled past. Some sort of alarm was raised but it hardly mattered by this point: We were inside their perimeter. Gunfire roared from the second floor as Automaton bore the truck up the stairs and through the front door. Wood and aluminum crumpled from the impact, along with the hapless street soldier behind it. \n\nThe rest of the account reads something like this: Rabbit brutally maims and murders her way through the house, leaving a trail of bodies in her wake. Automaton, once he recovers from the shock of what just happened, follows close behind to clean up. Though the defenders wage a staunch battle, they simply aren't prepared for the incarnation of raw violence that called itself Rabbit. The pair find both targets huddling together in the master bedroom, as the cartel lord tried to protect his girlfriend. \n\nWait, what!? It turns out that the 'hostage' was there of her own free will. The two of them had fallen in love and run away together on a whirlwind adventure, culminating in an extended vacation in his brother's summer home. Rabbit and Automaton look at each other. Rabbit is confused and a little disappointed while Automaton is just irate. Silent communication passes as the couple looks on fearfully. Rabbit sheathes her sword with a shrug, apologizes and asks to talk with the girl about who sent them. Seeing a small window of hope, the love-struck lass agrees and moves besides the woman who murdered many of her new friends. As her beau starts to thank Automaton for sparing them, he is promptly cut-off by a pair of gunshots: One to the head and one to the heart. \n\nThe girl screams, Rabbit hits her with a tranquilizer patch and hoists her over a shoulder. Automaton takes a photo of the target, receives confirmation and reports that the are bringing the hostage back. The trip back is more sedate, despite the sheer amount of gore covering both runners. Automaton even croons along with Rabbit but the energy from before is gone. They arrive at their vessel, load their unconscious cargo aboard and leave. The trip back takes the better part of a month but few people look twice at a small fishing ship puttering along the shore. Frequent sedation is required for their hapless guest, lest she try something silly like hurting herself or either of them.\n\nThe duo have been paid half of their fee, ostensibly for wiping out their target. There is a strong connection between them now, one born of spending every second with the other. It is a bond cemented by constant aggravation and a burning desire to throttle each other but they trust each other now, a miracle considering Automaton's rampant paranoia. When they finally make it to the drop-off point, a stern woman with a resemblance to their 'rescued' victim steps forth to greet them. More accurately, she ignored them and gently guided her daughter towards their car. Their departure was accompanied by heart-broken complaints about how monstrous we were and how happy she was to see her mother...who we identified as a high-ranking executive with Renraku. Before they drove away, we received an approving look and the rest of our payment. It was at that point the duo decided to separate and lay low for a while.\n\nRabbit has some more bioware implanted and improves on her sword-craft. Automaton did some maintenance on his Ares Roadmaster and did a little digging into their latest target. They discovered that her mother was indeed an executive for Renraku and was considered an incredibly important employee to the Mega-corporation. Her daughter was rumored to have gotten herself caught up with a small time crime boss, which we already knew. The fact that chilled Automaton's blood was that their target, who had caught a terminal case of the 'murdered-as-fuck', also happened to be the younger brother of a real Cartel Lord. His brother was on the Interpol Top Twenty Most Wanted list and headed up some of the most violent executions seen outside of Aztechnology. \n\nIt was at the moment that Automaton was contacting Rabbit that they both received a message. It read as follows:\n\n\"Due to the services that you have done for us, we are offer you a unique opportunity. There are currently several well-armed hit-squads sent by your last target's family. They will not be dissuaded and, even if you kill them, more will replace them. You can take your chances with them or you can be at this address within half an hour. The choice is yours.\" \n\nRabbit, possessing a strong survival instinct, legged it. Automaton was, as always, far more paranoid. After trying to back-trace the communique, something far beyond his meager skills with the matrix, he did some physical recon. He found several well-armed hit-squads creeping up on his front door. With few options left to him, Automaton hurried down the escape tunnel into the sewer and rendezvoused with his partner. The meeting place was an unexceptional warehouse along the dockyard. Inside waited a pair of suited agents and a limousine. The offer was thus: Strip out of your armor, remove your weapons and get in the car. From there, you would be taken to safety and given a fresh start. \n\nFurious but helpless, they acquiesced. They were given new clothes and freshly forged SINs before being bundled into the limousine. Automaton remained silent as Rabbit questioned where they were going, receiving only monosyllabic answers. Hours passed as the pair of runners were driven out of town, along highways and interstates, before coming to a halt outside a private facility. The guards told them to go inside and join the queue. With little in the way of options, Automaton and Rabbit did so. They were greeted by smiling servers who informed them that their flight would be leaving in twelve minutes, twenty three seconds. Rabbit was the first to speak, angrily asking what flight!? \n\n\"Please head to gate two. You will be seated there.\"  They reluctantly followed, trying to discern their location. It was revealed to them as they came across gate two: The duo were standing in a colossal suborbital launch hanger. Their awe at the towering vessels was short-lived as they were shepherded aboard. Seated across from each other, with barely half a dozen passengers total, the runners realized just how lucky they had been. Exactly twelve minutes and twenty three seconds after they had arrived, the suborbital shuttle rocketed away. It was an odd and wholly disturbing sensation of not being in control of your own destiny in the slightest...very much the same way they had felt for the past few hours.\n\nThe shuttle exited the atmosphere for a few breathtaking moments as the stars glittered like jewels across the bleak cosmos. The setting sun set the void aflame, streaks of orange light scorching their way across the night sky. Then, just as suddenly, it was gone. We were plummeting towards Australia: A land full of strange mutants, dangerous flora and vast mana-storms that raged across the continent. We landed at a private terminal in Sydney airport, where we were greeted and scanned by the security. Each checkpoint had a mage to assensse potential threats, or at least someone pretending to be a mage. It seemed like they were using it to keep people in line, to capitalize on people's fear of the mystical. Worked pretty damn well, on us at least.\n\nThere was nothing to worry about though. We passed by without question and walked out into the city state of Sydney. The two new comm-links that we had been provided had a single message on them.\n\n\"Go to this address and lay low. You will be contacted by an employment mediator soon. This will be the last time you hear from us. Consider the debt repaid.\" \n\nTired, isolated from everything they know and angry regarding the circumstances that brought them here, they complied. It was a sparsely furnished home for two, a little on the small side but manageable. Further inspection of their SINs revealed that they were a recently married couple who had decided on a fresh start in a new place. It should have been easy for the two of them to live the quiet life until a fixer contacted them. This should be where our story ends until they started running again, attempting to make a name for themselves in the Australian shadow community.\n\nExcept for the blasted possum. For those of you who don't know what a possum is, please read: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possum. Adorable, right? Now, here's the sound they make when they're pissed off: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5E8UIZWt29Q. The very first night that our intercontinental dynamic decimation duo are in Sydney, this is the noise they hear in the wall. Somewhat worried, Rabbit did the only logical thing and started hacking at the walls with a kitchen knife. After she righteously slaughtered the terrified animal, Automaton noticed a small electronic listening device hidden in the plaster. As his paranoia kicked in, fueled by recent events and his subsequent powerlessness, the calculating runner began hunting for bugs in a decidedly unsubtle fashion.\n\nRabbit, her work done, started the cleaning process by dragging the several chunks of mutilated possum outside to the rubbish bin. Sadly, this was noticed by several concerned neighbors who did the only thing they could think of: They called the police and reported suspicious activity possibly involving a body. Well isn't that swell? In minutes, there are sirens blaring and patrol vehicles pulling up outside our new domicile. The officers wanted to speak to us about a possible murder. Automaton and Rabbit looked at each other before acting in unison. Rabbit invited both men in, commenting on how dashing they looked in their uniforms, while Automaton offered rushed to the kitchen, hollering an offer for something to drink.\n\nThe law enforcement professionals, while somewhat taken aback by the Stepford Smiler routine unfolding before them, went against their better nature and entered. What followed next was some of the most cringe-worthy dialog in our roleplaying history as we desperately tried to convince the officers that we were: A) Absolutely not criminals of any kind and B) Madly in love. This was not assisted by the fact that IRL, I was head over heels in love with the stunning lady playing Rabbit. Red Leader, our everpresent bastard of a Game Master, thought our act was hilarious. By the time he stopped laughing, we had devised a new plan. \n\nAutomaton asked if anyone could smell something burning and Rabbit shrieked that she could. The officers confirmed this as Automaton had just taken a fucking cleaver to the electrical line. As one of the upstanding young men ran to the patrol car and the other went to pacify everyone, the runners sprinted out the back door and away. They began leaping fences, vaulting over parked cars and generally trying to vacate the area with as much haste as humanly possible. Apparently, this did not go unnoticed as the house caught fire. Sparking electrical lines and flammable material, who knew?\n\nAs the cacophony of sirens rent the air, emergency services vehicles hurtling past us at breakneck speeds, another message appeared on their comm-links.\n\n\"I fail to see what was so difficult about my previous instructions. Be glad I have such a defined sense of honor. Move to this location and remain there until you are extracted. This is the last mercy I grant you.\"\n\nDressed in their night clothes, with no back-up and armed with naught but a fairly dull meat cleaver: Automaton and Rabbit made a beeline for the rendezvous. It was an intersection, almost deserted at this time of night. The silence was only broken by the faint wail of sirens in the distance and the pounding of their heart-beats. Rabbit looked to Automaton for something; reassurance, comfort perhaps? What she saw instead was a fuming egomaniac. The man who relied on being in control, in always knowing what was going on, had had enough of being helpless.\n\nA van screeched to a stop next to them, almost mounting the curb. An elven woman sat in the driver's seat, glaring at them angrily. The side door was thrown open by a sharply featured man, an elf of great confidence. He offered them a hand, beckoning them inside.\n\n\"Hello kids. Get in the van, we've got to move.\" Rabbit grinned, half from a giddy joy and half from nerves, as she leaped inside. She turned back to her partner, expecting the same. \n\n\"Who the fuck are you? Who are you working for?\" It would only be a slight exaggeration to say that foam was flying from Automaton's mouth at that point. I had rolled for my overcoming my paranoia check and come up with a critical glitch. Sometimes, the dice gods aren't with you and you need to react accordingly. As Rabbit tried to convince her friend to join her, he waved the dull blade at the man.\n\n\"Answer me, you bastard!\" The driver, already off-put by this damned job, swiveled in her chair and snarled at him.\n\n\"Get in or fuck off, those are your choices!\" Rabbit went wide-eyed, knowing what was about to happen but not quite believing it. Automaton, his mind fractured by paranoia and a loss of control, fled into the shadowy embrace of a dark alleyway. Rabbit watched on disbelieving as her partner and friend vanished from her life. The man slammed the door shut, muttering under his breath as the driver accelerated away. \n\n\"One out of two isn't bad, right?\" He jokingly asked the lean woman beside him. Rabbit looked at the man furiously before the fight drained out of her and she smiled weakly. \n\n\"Yeah,  I guess not. What's your name?\" The man grinned, buckling into a seat. \n\n\"Sargan. Cranky bugger in the front seat's Kit-Kat. What do we call you?\" \n\nRabbit looked back at the alleyway her friend had vanished down, his form lost among the shadows. She squeezed her eyes shut tightly and shook her head, dispelling any thought of him. \n\n\"Twitch. Call me Twitch.\"\n\nThe rest, as you know, is history. \n\nThe moral of the story? Sometimes you just need to go with the flow, chummer. \n\nThank you for everyone who read this series and I hope you enjoyed it. As previously mentioned, I will be starting another tale about shadowrun next week. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.",

        "text": "Continent map, huge size, 8 civs, 16 C.S. the map was three continents two main large land masses, and a narrow third that was at minimum 2 tiles so no canal city porn but never got thicker than four. This thin strip was what I called the wall because im creative that way. It was mountainous and hilly as well as lakey. Basically it was impossible to get across. It was also connected to both islands with shallow water so it would be the first way to the other island.\n\nNow on my island there was me (japan FTMOE), the celts who were total bros, the english who sucked SOOOO MANY BALLS. And poor poor venice. On the other island there was china, attila, roman, and Zuul wait no I mean the zulu. I never meet rome. Or china. Or attila. I only meet zulu. By the time anyone could get across the pond, he had the ENTIRE FUCKING ISLAND TO HIMSELF. We still had land to settle on our island, but on his bigger island, there was no land to set up a coast city or any thing. \n\nI sent my forces to the wall, and built a few cities there to take the brunt of the his first wave. There was no wave. It never ended. I was constantly trying to hold the wall, and then I saw it. I had bribed the celts to help me in the war, but england and zulu teamed up to take out the celts. She never stood a chance. Venice was busy being venicey and england forgot the only rule of the zulu. There is only ZUUL. She was murdered almost immediately.  holding the a few cities in non-strategic locations that couldn't really do anything. \n\nI had a plan though to beat zuul that didnt require me crossing streams with three other dudes. I would take his capital and grab a dom victory. Now to place some context on how long this war was, this was around the time I had swordsmen getting samurai. When I started to implement my plan, on long speed, I had muffin men. You've heard of the muffin man right? There would be 13 of them, leveled up on the wall, the lowest level being like 7 I think. I would also bring along several artillery. My plan was to make a third fleet of boats, run through the boats the zulu had against my north route, go around the world, end up on the other side of the wall. To make a safe passage for my troops. I had about 14 ships to make my one last attempt of winning this.\n\nOnly five ships made it to the other side. Thanks to autocracy and that wounded warrior or what ever it was called, my ships were doing more damage than when they were fully healed. 13 muffin men renamed the fighting 1st and about 5 artillery units moved in. His capital was close to the coast, but id still have to get past the first city and what ever army waited in the darkness. Those brave ships weakened the city so only one muffin man was needed to capture the city.\n\nThe rest landed on now new japan, only to find several zulu coming towards them. It did not matter that my men possesed guns, or could rain hell from three tiles away, death for them seemed like a better thing than turn tale to what ever demon that lay in their capital. With a big push, 4 muffin men and 5 artillery had made it into striking distance of the gates of hell. The artillery opened fire, the muffin men ran at the walls but the city held. For this turn.\n\nThen venice won a cultural victory.",

        "text": "It was early on in a Kingmaker campaign and I mean early; we had managed to capture Happs and had him bound and gagged in Oleg's stables overnight until we figured out what to do with him. I was playing a Neutral Evil Kitsune Dirge Bard (disguised as human) who was using the whole scenario as a way to get out of dodge since there were a number of copycat thieves in his part of town and security was beefing up - let them get caught and security relaxes and then he can come back. Well, among his spoils is an esoteric item that nobody knew what it was, let alone how to use it. He was able to because his magic is innate, not learned - it was a magical musical instrument that was effectively a keytar. As a side note, he loved collecting what were effectively made for Pathfinder Creepypastas - you know scary stories. Jeff the Killer became Geoffrey the Slayer, etc.\n\nSo we have captured Happs and people are bedding down. We've set a watch on the ramparts so no worries there. Well, I decide to pay Happs a visit to see if I can get some scary stories and info out of him - he's local color and so far, we've only tried talking to him in a group, so he might be more persuaded by a single person, especially one as charismatic as myself. It's not that hard to get him spilling the beans; get him off guard with scary stories and he drops a few hints to which I press him for more info. I manage to pull a fair amount out of him, including info about the Temple of the Elk and I milked him until he was dry. A lot of it was conjecture about how many there were in the Stag Lord's employ but I saw it as an opportunity to get a few thugs together and rebuild the name of Stygian Fawkes (his alias) here in the Greenbelt and beyond. And Happs is a loose end who has been rather belligerent and unwilling to cooperate until now. So I start playing my keytar.\n\nThe rest of the party is quite aware of what I do - I've already grilled them for some scary stories and I play my keytar for mood every now and again to keep myself in practice - so this is nothing out of the ordinary. Happs is enjoying the music so far and as I play, this plan comes to fruition. As I play, I cast prestidigitation several times and lay out the tools of my murder. I create a length of rope and about a pound of warm, melted candle wax, still liquid. Through the power of bardic doing-shit-while-still-playing-my-bloody-instrument-no-matter-what-it-is, I tie a knot in the end of the rope and approach Happs. I ask him if he likes the music and he - with eyes closed - says that he is enjoying it. To which I responded with \"At least you'll go out with a funeral dirge\" as I shove the knotted end of the rope into his mouth and down his throat.\n\nHe starts coughing and trying to get it out but he's failing miserably, tied up like he is. Forcing his head back, I pour the wax down his throat. It catches on the knot and begins to cool, his low body temp (it's winter and the only insulation he has is hay and not much of it) keeping it there. It starts to cut off his air flow and his struggling intensifies. His breath begins to whistle as the room he has to breath narrows and at this point, I stop pouring and smile at him, showing the fact that my human form's canines are longer than they should be - not prominent like a vampire's but on the side of rare, not uncommon.\n\n\"There, there, Happs. It's okay....\" I say, shooshpapping him.\n\nBy this point, he's understanding what I intend to do and he is staring daggers as me and struggling, his wrists beginning to bleed from where he's trying to force his way. I lean in, still smiling with black orbs for eyes and the last thing he sees before the change are my eyes turning crimson. I press my lips against his in a kiss and revert back to my natural form, using the narrowness of my foxy muzzle to get leverage in his mouth to be able to bite his tongue off. When I pull back, he sees a black furred kitsune with silver tail and ear tips and a bloodstained muzzle spit his own tongue onto the ground.\n\n\"Give my regards to Charon, won't you?\" I say as I gag him once more, vertically to keep the blood mostly in his mouth.\n\nI sit back down, fully foxed out and continue playing his funeral dirge, both of my tails swishing to the rhythm as I watch him suffocate/drown/bleed to death, grinning with bloody fangs the entire time as the light in his eyes slowly dies. In an hour's time, my prestidigitated items vanish from reality, leaving behind a scene of suicide. I pack up my things, remove the vertical gag and replace the horizontal gag, go to human form and return to my bunk for a good night's sleep.\n\nUpon waking, Oleg informs us that Happs was slain in the middle of the night. The party goes to investigate and we find the suicide scene as I left it, though with a pool of blood underneath him and one trailing down his chest. The first thing the wizard sees is the tongue on the ground just in front of him and asks about that.\n\n\"Based on what I can see, it looks like he committed suicide by biting off his tongue. Must have had information he would take to his grave.\"\n\nNo check needed because of how I phrased it. The party shrugged and we went on our merry way.",

        "text": "Quick disclaimer; I play fast and loose with the rules, as per the spirit of my friend /u/ego_dominus and his old campaign.  As a result, shenanigans ensue.\n\nThe party begins in the basement of a dungeon they had been exploring in a previous session where they killed a bunch of spectral undead, including but not limited to a banshee and wraith at the same time.  This time, they are clearing out the basement of its blight infestation, and also a shambling mound.  Combat over, the party collects a fancy looking black opal and head on their way.  Back in the city (the one from my previous tale, [found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3xjmuo/dd_5e_how_the_glorious_chucklefucks_did_in_an/)), the party decides to split up to explore a bit more.  The bard and fighter team up to take on a troll in the city arena, the ranger goes to the cheapest bar and ends up with a minor case of alcohol poisoning, the cleric goes to the library and finds the next plot hook (more on that later), and the barbarian does his physics homework.  \n\nThe fight with the troll ends up in a technical stalemate, with my players having no slashing, fire, or acid damage to prevent the regeneration of the troll, so to avoid any complications, the fighter just slams the head off with a natural 20.  \n\ncloseenough.jpg\n\nThe cleric, while looking for an interesting book, finds a record of accounts about a figure known only as \"the Mad God\", an entity whose abilities and magics do not follow the rules of nature or the Weave, and who also has a rather peculiar sense of humor.  The librarian, seeing the cleric's choice of literary entertainment, begins to talk of a group calling themselves the \"Mad God Counterforce (or at least until we find a better name)\" who are researching this Mad God in an attempt to stop him from wreaking his chaos and havoc upon the innocent lands of Zawordo.  The cleric enthusiastically signs up the whole party to become members without their consent.  The Librarian says for the whole group to meet again in the library in two days.\n\nOver these two days, the party goes to the local gymnasium to train for a quick strength boost (originally it was just the fighter, but everyone joined in much to his chagrin).  One training montage later and three party members have +1 to strength.\n\nAs the time for the meeting arrives, the party heads to the library on a cloudless night.  They meet and the two present counterforce members give some exposition on what they do and who they are and why they are the good guys, when suddenly three rounds of thunder are heard from this cloudless sky.  Thunder that sounds almost like the sky laughing maniacally.  The counterforce members exchange a quick glance, say \"three days\", then bolt to prepare.  \n\nAs soon as they have left the scene, a book begins to talk to the party.  \"that laugh sounds a little old.  Looks like he's been traveling.\" Book becomes a large serpentine creature with mismatched limbs of different animals.  This is a creature the party has met before, and was revealed to be on the run from his old master. \"I can't stay long, or else my old master will find me again, but I think you may want these\" and produces a pair of high heels.  The party cleric, who is also the gayest of gay men after an accidental magical sex change in a previous session (and maybe a tale here, I can't remember), immediately takes the heels and dons them.  Almost had disadvantage to all dex related rolls were it not for a successful fabulous check.  Aaron (ay-ay-ron) rocks those heels.\n\nThree days pass with nothing of true importance.  On the next day, the fighter, barbarian, and bard go on a picknick, skeptical as to how legitimate the warning could be.  The cleric is watching from the rooftops.  The ranger is taking a nap.  Snow begins to fall, and then a bolt of lightning strikes a few hundred yards away from the city.  However, this bolt is odd.  It persists for a few moments, while strange reptilian creatures begin to pour forth from this bolt.  The dinosaurs have invaded.  Behind the first wave, and actually chasing the first dinosaurs, is a T-Rex.  The fighter, being dragonborn, uses his breath weapon to try and damage the non-hostile dinosaurs, but due to their fear it does not change their motives.  The bard casts darkness on the Rex, effectively blinding it until the cleric and ranger can come and assist.  Party defeats, and subsequently harvest all valuable materials, from the Rex, and turn around to see that the city guard, with help from some local druids and horsemen, have calmed the stampede and the dinos are all now docile.  The party is then presented with a nice reward and a house for helping the city twice now in a single week (thrice if counting the assassination situation).  With that, I call the session as over, as I had finished my planned material, when the fighter's player says \"wait, I want to fire Stafford!\"  Stafford being his nickname for the [wabbajak](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2zun42/dd_5e_when_a_surprise_character_betrayal_failed/cpmy3i9).  And so with that he goes into the field and just has a party.  The cleric, holding Dwight (the [jakkawab](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/32fqtc/dd_5edeadlands_hoe_the_consequences_of_playing/cqarjxw)), joins in.  The following happen: Hedgehogs rain from the sky, a lightning storm is cast on the entire area, the fighter tripples his max hp, the T-Rex reanimates seeking revenge (and procedes to fight the cleric and fighter with the only party assistance being the bard via Rocky-Talkie^tm), a young black dragon being summoned with designs on killing everything in the area (whole party was present for that, so not as bad as it could have been), the cleric (and a rock) getting a currently unknown superpower, a tree being turned into solid gold, and the corpse of the T-Rex turning to cheese.\n\nBut these are not the best part. No, the best part is when everyone within 100 miles of the cleric swapped gender, except the cleric himself.  This means the entire party, the city, and I'm pretty sure all the inhabitants on the continent are having a crash course in, uh... exploratory and gender studies...\n\nI really need to put a charge limit on those staffs....",

        "text": "Just a quick little thing that happened at the end of our first session that they all keep bugging me to write about so here it is. \n\nSo when we [last left off](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3xw2u1/the_investigation_bureau_in_splendid_beginnings/), Douglas the human monk, Corrick the catfolk swashbuckler, and Nauss the albino tiefling investigator had just ran like sissies after pulling an ornate box from a trap filled catacomb and turned it in to clear up false charges of assaulting guardsmen. With that done, it was time to get themselves an actual paying job. Fortunately, Tavaga, the owner of the inn they were staying at, had a job board with a few openings available. How convenient! The group picked the one job that wasn't demeaning or would get them in trouble with the law yet again and went to the address on the flier.\n\nSurprise surprise, it was Knight Captain Roberts again, the man who sent them on that fetch quest into the trap filled catacomb to begin with. Roberts was very happy and smug to see the party take up his offer for more work so soon which made Corrick even more irritable around the guards than he usually was. Despite Corrick's piss-y behavior, Nauss acted as the face of the group (despite his face including horrible needle-like monster teeth that he hid under a scarf and sporting a whopping 6 charisma) and got the details of the job without any problems. The guards of the Legacy district had recently captured a important member of a hobgoblin gang called the Guttersnipes and needed extra men to patrol to make sure nothing happened while they transferred the man to prison. Simple work for 30 gold each, not a bad deal at all.\n\nThe party donned the Legacy district guard insignia and futzed around across the street of the shady brothel they were told to keep watch near. A few hours of sleep-standing and blowing spit bubbles later, a hobgoblin walked up and offered to pay us to go somewhere else for a few minutes. Nauss and Douglas turned him down immediately as they had enough honor to do the job they were already being payed to do but Corrick asked how much he was willing to pay in goblin. (Corrick was the only one that spoke goblin due to his time working with the ones that operated the cannons on his old ship. He wasn't very fond of them though, something about being too crude and focused on exploding things if I recall) It was apparently a good offer but Corrick turned it down, feelinging better opportunities would come if he stuck with the party. The hobgoblin seemed a bit disappointed but calmly left as his four buddies ran down the street to shank us in the kidneys. Initiative was rolled and Douglas went first.\n\nNow this story is about Douglas and what he's about to do, but first some backstory. Douglas' player had made his character in secret and wouldn't tell the rest of us anything about him. When we talked to Douglas in role play, he gave us a little bit of information. Before Douglas became a monk, he was a renowned bounty hunter, known for taking on enemies bare-handed. His monk robes were blue and he wore a yellow scarf. His full name was Douglas J. Falcon. All the pieces finally came together when Douglas lept at the nearest hobgoblin, pulled back his flaming fist, and turned that hobgoblin's face into a smoking crater as he shouted the words -\n\n\"**FALCON PUUUNCH!!!**\"\n\nOur reaction- Oh. Oooooooooooohhhhh.\n\nHe was so happy. He had been planning this moment for almost a year and he was finally able to pull it out to the surprise of everyone at the table. He just spent the rest of the fight throwing punches and smiling to himself, honestly he deserved it. The rest of the fight was fairly uneventful aside from Corrick not being able to hit anything and Nauss going [stretchy arms and extendo fingers] (http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/l/long-arm) and only being able to hit for one damage. We killed three and hauled the one we knocked out to jail then got paid after we finished our rounds and turned in for the night.\n\nI still can't believe I didn't see that coming, it's so obvious in hindsight. but whatever makes people happy I guess. Stay tuned for next time when the Investigation Bureau searches for more ancient stuff and screams in the face of nature.",

Then John Cena jumps on his back and starts choking him with his biceps. The barb has two people on him and is now over encumbered. Our wizzard casts levatate on the barb, but since he has bullshit badger and john cena \"equiped\" they lift them up too. \n\nWarrior get's nat 20 on goading strike, so john cena's fking pissed off.

        "text": "Warning: Wall of Text, if you read you'd better be in it for the long-haul\n\nCast of Characters:\n\n- Urgaan - Orc Barbarian\n- Gimmdren - Dwarf Ranger\n-Gylwynn - Elf Rogue\n- Me - DM\n\n     This is the second entry in the series The Urgaan Chronicles. If you have not read the first chapter, click [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3z7qq7/urgaan_and_the_cave_of_shenanigans/)\n\n     This chapter will cover two sessions, this weeks and last weeks, as nothing remarkable enough happened last week to warrant a full post.\n\n     So, after leaving the general store from the last chapter, the party went to the castle, where the man who gave them their previous task said to meet. Upon arriving there, the man approached them, asking if they had finished their task. They said they had, and the man introduced himself as Gregor Nelles, the king of Ivendale's most trusted advisor. Gregor instructed the party to speak with the king, who gave them 2000 gold pieces as a reward, and assigned them another task, to find a traitor within the city who had been letting enemy soldiers in. It was at this point that Urgaan's player left for the day.\n\n     The party then went to the tavern where the campaign started, The Dancing Kobold, and befriended the tavernkeep and persuaded him to give them the key to a room rented a few days before by a possible suspect. After searching his room, they find a note that says to meet at a house across town. After interrupting the meeting and killing both hooded figures attending it, they find orders to kill the party from someone called Ianxidor on one of the bodies.\n\n     The Party goes to the town's other tavern to ask about Ianxidor, it's morning and the tavern is empty except for one drunkard, who yells \"IT'S 5:00 SOMEWHERE\". The tavernkeep tells the party Ianxidor is hiding in a nearby ruined temple. On their way there, the party encounters a wid boar which they kill, and a tiger, which Gimmdren makes friends with, but leaves after about 10 minutes because the only reason he was following Gimmdren was because he had meat in his pack, and the tiger realized he wasn't going to get any, so left. The party arrives at the temple and answers a riddle to open a secret passage, this was when the session ended so the rest of this post will be about today's session.\n\n     This week, Urgaan's player was back. So the party walked down the secret passage, and entered a door straight ahead. The room had a chest in it, which Urgaan did a disable device check on to check for traps... he rolled a 2 and obviously found nothing, but thought he had checked thoroughly and opened the chest anyway. The chest, of course was a trap, and 12 skeletons rose from coffins to fight them. During the fight Urgaan tried to intimidate the skeletons, and since he failed, nothing happened and one of the skeletons flipped him off. And just to add insult to injury, the chest was empty.\n\n     So, the party continued through the temple undercroft, fighting a few undead, until they came across a study. In the study were several bookcases, all of the books were magically sealed except for one, \"The Bucket of Oraziel\". The book told of a legendary bucket worn as a helmet by a powerful mage, I made the book especially for Urgaan, as he is obsessed with buckets, but I forgot he was illiterate, so he didn't know what the book was about. Since Urgaan is quick to anger, he attempted to burn down the study as he was upset that he was illiterate and couldn't  read anything in the study. Gylwynn was able to calm Urgaan down by promising to teach him to read though.\n\n     Through the next door was a gelatinous cube, who I had meant to be a miniboss but had underestimated my players who killed it in one round and one attack of opportunity. Also, inside the gelatinous cube, digesting, was the same drunkard who had called out \"IT'S 5:00 SOMEWHERE\" in the tavern, don't ask me how he got there. The next door was locked, so Gylwynn attempted to pick the lock, but she failed, and someone in the room heard the lockpick breaking and went to investigate. Panicking, Urgaan attempted to kick down the door before whoever was behind it reached it... and rolled a natural 20. It turns out there was a necromancer and 4 skeletons behind the door, but because of the natural 20 the door was knocked from it's hinges, sent 15 feet backwards and crushed on of the skeletons. That was the last thing that happened before the session ended.\n\nExpect chapter 3 next week, or two weeks from now at the most.\n\nEDIT: Wall of text warning and better fromatting.",

        "text": "Our story starts in 1936. I pick Russia, and decide to go with the Wrangel path. Pyotr and his agents seize the assets of state after the assassination of Kerensky begin to assert their dictatorship. Pyotr picks a loyal lackey as his second in command, and begins his dictatorship. The first thing I decided to do (after re-inforcing my divisions) was to undertake a massive industrial plan in metropolitan Russia. From the Ural mountains to the Mitteleuropean Ostwall, every Russian province was to have it's industry and economy completely revitalized (basically I built 2 IC in every non-Siberian province, maybe about 5 IC in major cities like Moscow and Saint Petersburg)\n\nLet's shift our focus to Germany for a second. Germany has an event during the first year of the game in which they can ban the Syndicalist parties in Germany. France has the option to declare over this, but they nearly never do, since Germany is unquestionably superior in military at this point.\n\nBut they did this time.\n\nSouth Italy, France and Great Britain were now at war with the world's unchallenged superpower. Within a month, France and South Italy had been totally overrun. Britain continued the fight, but they stood defiant against the entirety of Europe. The Internationale had doomed itself before the game even began.\n\nBack to Russia. By this point, the first wave of 5 or so factories had been completed. Pyotr pushed for an economy that was more and more in the hands of the state. He had also given state funding to a Russian film industry and a youth organization. The new Russian state was in the wallets, the minds and the nurseries of the Russian people. And nobody seemed to mind, considering my 0 dissent\n\nNobody, that is, except the communists. Those little bastards thought they were so big and tough when they went on strike demanding political concessions. What they weren't counting on was for Wrangel to fold completely to each and every one of their demands. Pyotr may not have been a communist man, but he was a loyal Russian nationalist and a strong proponent for the centralized economy. The Vozhd was more than happy to give into the unionist's demands for better working conditions, higher wages and a more state controlled economy. What loyal Russian wouldn't? The unionists only seemed to make the process of reforming the economy faster. Russia was still reeling from it's feudal history, but it was fast on it's way to being a modern, industrialized nation.\n\nThe USA, on the other hand, was in much more dire straits. Syndicalists had won the election, and it didn't seem like anyone was happy about it. Reed Jackson was barely able to pass a single reform before MacArthur marched on the White House and had him removed from office. With this, the Pacific States, the American Union State and the Combined Syndicates of America rose up and declared war on the US.\n\nWrangel saw particular potential in Huey Long, the leader of the southern \"AUS\". A couple weeks after the civil war began, Long was sent an offer from Moscow for military support and a formal alliance. Long declined. The Vozhd, not willing to bother with a long diplomatic campaign turned elsewhere.\n\nIt was time to begin developing the military. I had a good +25 (at least) extra IC than when I started. Coinciding with Pyotr's decision to support the Manpower doctrine, the Russian State began to produce 3 sets of 30 infantry + artillery divisions. Upon the completion of the first wave of 30, work also began on a preliminary airforce (3 x 4 int) and a couple armored divisions.\n\nEarly 1938, the Vozhd's attention was drawn back to America. Headlines read \"Union State captures Chicago\". Perhaps it was once again time to offer an alliance to Huey...\n\nEnd of part one. To listen to part two, flip the cassette tape.",

I usually go with the Eden Initiative, but I just felt like polluting the environment today.  Well, I started off on an OK island, but it wasn't THAT good.  I ended up meeting Vadim Sokow, so I got oil pretty quick.  Long story short, I ended up getting plastics.\n\nSounds like the perfect environmental issue, right? Well, I populated another island with food factories, coal power plants and extractors, and both islands had more smog than China.  It was amazing any of my citizens could breathe.\n\nI lost all my coal on both islands after prospering for a while.  I tried getting eco power plants up(since I had executives and unlocked the Edens), but it just didn't produce enough power.  So I lost all of my power, my islands went into anarchy, my buildings were burning, and if THAT wasn't bad enough, a tornado started on my main island.  After that, I raged and stopped playing since.\n\nSo the main lesson here is: DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, PLAY AS GLOBAL TRUST.",

        "text": "This is the campaign logs of an ongoing campaign of Star Wars Saga Edition (the D20 setting that ended up with everything from films to games up until The Force Unleashed). I'm the DM, there are 3 permanent players as well as 2 other who sometimes drop by. That's what I call a physical tabletop game, we were all around the table, not on an online chat. It's also a recollection of everything, so it might not be excatly what happened (especially the dialogs).\n\n\nTimeline setup: The campaign takes place in the Old Republic, 300 years after the KotOR games, and just before the TOR MMORPG. It is 2 years after the sack of Coruscant by the Empire, in the middle of the cold war between the Sith Empire and the Old Republic (the MMORPG is said to start in around 8 years from now). In that time, superweapons, fleets of warships, masses of Jedis and Sith of somewhat unclear alignment to the Force are common place. This being the start of cold war, proxy-wars are someting going on in a few places ; it's not all out cold-war \"conflict\" on every planets like in the MMORPG.\n\nThe Party: As when we started this session.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n- **Esylis Aeon** : Mon Calamari M, Noble ; expert in Diplomacy, actualy Calamari minor diplomatic crew member, the Face of the group. Jokingly named \"the Octopus\" by the party.  \n- **Rumpawarro** : Wookiee M, Scoundrel ; droid expert, technology expert, pilot. Has a protocol proto-droid --just the core and vocabulator-- to help being understoud. Roleplays the wookiee and/or droid speach sometimes.  \n- **Jenseen** : Miraluka F, Jedi ; Has levels in the Jedi Class, is actually an escaped Sith Apprentice on the run. Hates the Sith Empire, wants revenge.  \n- **V3-RD** Ordo : 4th Degree Droid M, Soldier ; DMPC, to add some firepower and I wanted to have a PC if we ever swaped DMs. Is actually a prototype droid in the Mandalorian armor of his defunct creator.  \n- **Sadonac** : Human M, Sentinel Jedi ; stealthy guy with 2 sabers, barely what you could call a Jedi in behavior.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Let's start.**\n\nThe Mon Calamari diplomatic bureau asks Esylis Aeon to help some friends in one of their errands. He's instructed to join a space transport run by the Independant Merchants Guild (IMG), on whitch he'll be joined by a bodyguard for the mission. Mission consisting on assisting the IMG in recovering one of their cargo stolen during transit. Being the he is also the only one to know that the cargo is indeed a bunch of weapon crates inbound to some resistants on an Empire-controled planet and that the IMG is in reality the Republic smuggling corporation.\n\nArriving at the spaceport dock, he encounters the Sentinel Jedi, they great, and depart for another stop to pick-up another person. On their way, it looks like the Jedi doesn't even know why he's tagging along the Mon Calamari except to protect him. On the planet of Vena, they pick-up the Wookiee. He was asked to come along by a friend of a friend that works for the IMG.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n\t- \"What is that hairy thing !? We're not going to take that on board !\", Sadonac said pointing at the Wookie  \n\t- \"*I'm a Wookiee little stupid guy !*\", threw Rumpawarro  \n\t- \"Informative: My master is a Wookiee. A Wookiee could rend your intestines appart with his claws if he wanted to.\", added the proto-droid  \n\t- \"Ok, ok, I didn't say anything\"  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nAnd off they go for Nar Shaada, where their Chadra-Fan pilot (an IMG pilot) told them that they'll meet a local guide to the city.\n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n    \nSo, Nar Shaada, the moon of Nal Hutta, much like Coruscant, that's planet-city ; except it's populated by all the scum of the galaxy and controlled by Hutts. They soon land on a private dock where a shady woman, in a dark grey cape meets them. Jenseen, while hiding from the Sith on Nar Shaada, was tasked by her landlord/job dealer to act as their guide of the city. After some discussion, they head up to the Old Market District where one of the Black Markets should be. They manage to find it, and get entrance to the area.\n\nThe Old Market District's Black Market is a really big warehouse, with lots and lots of shops like a bazaar, a mezzanine housing a cantina, and below it some hacker heaven with consoles and an hourly fee. The 4 heroes scatter around the place:  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n\t- Esylis is going to talk to people in the cantina, asking who might have done that kind of highjack ; and gets a few information about a pirate captain.  \n\t- Jenseen goes with him but stops at the bar to take \"the strongest drink available\" ; I have her roll against her Fortitude, and she beats her own resistnce to alcohol ... Jenseen is now drunk (-2 to all defenses and all rolls).  \n\t- Rumpawarro goes in the hacker den and starts fumbling around for information ; he ends up with a long list of starships that could have transported the cargo and that docked in Nar Shaada in the last week.  \n\t- Sadonac just goes through the market and asks \"HEY ! WHO KNOWS SOME SPACE PIRATES ??\" ... (he rolled a 1 on his gather information check) ; needless to say, not a single person talked to him after that.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nNow, you should know that for any non-combat situation like this, I use the \"skill challenge\" mechanic : the heroes need to gather X successes on a few skill checks before gathering Y failures on those checks. That was their first game, so there was only small maluses for failure (1 failure for a roll more than 5 away from the DC), except for fumbles, fumbles always gives you 2 failures. So in the end, Esylis gathered 2 successes, Rumpawarro 1 success too, but Sadonac just got them 2 failures. The challenge was 5 succeses before 3 failures ; and i didn't told them that.\n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n1 hour pass where they make those rolls. Sadonac goes in the cantina to take care of Jenseen (read drink. Yes, that's a Jedi, those were troubled times), while Esylis and Rumpawarro cross-check their findings : it look like 2 captain names match the transports list. So, back to takling to people and hacking the starport database again. While Esylis managed to get information from some shady looking guys in the cantina, passing himself for a entrepreneur trying to acquire some cargo owned by someone else and offering to hire a pirate captain (he totalled 2 more successes), Rumpawarro went back down to do some computier things. He managed to get the same information that the Mon Calamari did, but he tried to go further and fumbled his roll to. He got logged out of the system. little did they know was that an alert was sent to an undisclosed party.\n\nIn the end, they had : a drunk Jenseen ; Teth, the planet where the pirate they think did the highjack came from ; the pirate captain name ; and a bunch of pirates aware that they were looking for a firend of theirs. Until now, they had no fight, and I aimed to solve that problem. In a shady alley of Nar Shaada, they were suroundedd by 4 pirate goons.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n\t- \"You messed with the wrong people guys, time to pay with your lives. Blast them !\"  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nInitiative rolls were done, the Mon Calamari went first. He drew his blaster pistol, he rolled his attack dice. He rolled a '1'. I made him roll a d100, he rolled 98. That ugly Mon Calamari managed to put his power pack the wrong way inside his blaster and fried it ! Cue 10 minutes of laugther ... Folowed by the second attack of the game : fumble by the Wookiee player (67) ; it only disabled his arbalest for the next turn. Cue 5 more minutes of laugther ... In the end, the goons were dispatched, they headed back to their ship and went flying away from Nar Shaada, heading for Teth.\n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nThey had the planet, but nothing more. Teth is a forest-covert planet, with near-perpetual pink/purple mist. Upon arriving in orbit, they saw that there was only 1 city. So they decided to scan the whole planet for life signs, and ended with too many results (wildlife is abundant there). They then made a second orbit around the planet for civilisation signs, and found something that could definatly be a camp on the opposite side of the planet from the capital. So they headed there.\n \nThey made the error to ask their Chadra-Fan pilot to put them down as close as possible to the camp while staying undetected. Big mistake ... That Chadra-Fan is a crazy smuggler and blocade runner that delivers weapons to Empire occupied planets ! He went down in the athmosphere blazing like a torch, at full speed, hidden from the camp by the nearby mountain. He only stopped 50m from the groud to flatten the trajectory and landed safely in a clearing. I rolled against their Fortitude and none of them managed to puke. They were on the ground, but still had 7-8 hous of walk in the mountain to get to the camp on the other side.\n\nThe climb was uneventful, but while going down, exhausted, one managed to hurt his ankle. Then they arrived on a plateau overlooking the camp. That's the moment I chose to have a tch-altered voice hail them from the trees :  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n\t- \"Hold it right there travelers\"  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nDetection checks were made, weapons were drawn, and they saw a unarmed Mandalorian waving at them to follow him. They looked at each other like \"wtf is happening\", but still followed the Mandalorian as they were exhausted and the night was falling. They arrived on top of a small overhang, a perfect place to watch the pirate camp without being seen. Up there was the wreck of a small starship, a realy old wreck. A technology check later, the Wookiee knew it was some sort of scout/exploration ship with enougth room for 1. When they approached, the Mandalorian had taken out of the ship a portable heat generator and had put it in the middle of the camp. While everyone seated around the \"fire\", the Mandalorian stood up, looking at the pirate camp.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n\t- \"You are here for the pirates, aren't you ?\", said the Mandalorian  \n\t- \"Hum ... Yes, how could you know that ?\", asked Esylis  \n\t- \"There is nothing around here except those pirates\"  \n\t- \"*You're alone up here ?*\", asked Rumpawarro  \n\t- \"Inquisitive: Are you alone up there ?\", translated his droid-thing  \n\t- \"Affirmative\", answered the Mandalorian  \n\t- \"Could you tell us anything on the pirates ?\", said Esylis  \n\t- \"They are 25, of several races\", started the Mandalorian in a monotone voice. \"The leader is away in the space transport with the 2 fighters. 18 of them are still in the camp at the moment. The first mate, the assault crew and the support crew. They got a lot of crates a few weeks ago from one of their robberies. It is stocked in the big warehouse where the anti-air gun is located. The second anti-air battery is on top of the cantina. What you see around are housing for the pirates.\", and he then started giving every bit of information about everyone and everything in the camp.  \n\t- \"Excuse me, but how long have you been there ?\", interrupted Jenseen  \n\t- \"Longer than them\", the Mandalorian answered  \n\t- \"And how long have they been there themselves ?\"  \n\t- \"3712 galactic standard days.\" (a bit more than 10 years)  \n\t- \"You've been there alone all this time ? Why ?\", asked Esylis  \n\t- \"I am not powerful enougth to get their ship alone\"  \n\t- \"*If you help us, we can get you a ticket out of this planet*\", groared Rumpawarro  \n\t- \"Informative: If you help us, we can get you a ticket out of this planet\", translated the droid  \n\t- \"Affirmative\"  \n\t- \"Hum, how can we name you ?\", enquired Esylis  \n\t- \"Verd\", said Verd (note: Verd is the Mando'a word for 'Soldier', I went that far to find a name for my DMPC). \"You should rest before the night, tactical advantage will be achieved this way\".  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nThey agreed and rested until later that evening. When half of the pirates went in their tent to pray, and the others were still drinking, the heroes decided to infitrate the camp. Now, when I say camp, it's more like a junkyard made into a camp. Everything is placed around a plaza : at the north is the landing area, big enougth for the transport and the 2 fighters ; close by, at the east are the repair bays and fuel systems ; just on the west side is the warehouse ; and at the south is the cantina. There are also some housings and tents around the cantina back and side walls.\n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nSo the heroes descend from the mountain, stalk on the side of the camp and manage to get entry into the warehouse. You see, the cargo they're trying to take back are weapons ment for the resistance. They ask Verd, who looks like he knows his way around weapons and because he can see in the night, if he can make a quick inventory of what they have in there. The Mon Calamari also tells him to take anything he wants as a paiment. Several minutes later, Verd comes back with more guns, a blaster canon (read bazooka), some grenades and mines. Then Rumpawarro asks him if he can make bombs ... and they end up with 10 bombs that could toplle the cantina if used correctly. (My players are crazy)\n\nThey discuss a plan, and here it is :  \n- The Jedi is to stealth and go plant the bombs into the tents where 10 pirates are praying. He is to come back on the side of the entrance of the cantina afterward.  \n- The other scramble in the plaza for cover and prepare a firing zone outside of the cantina  \n- When the Jedi comes back, the Wookiee will detonate the charges and they'll pick up anyone comming out of the cantina.  \nA sound plan as it is. Except when luck isn't on their side, almost isn't. The Jedi didn't fumbled any of his rolls to plant the explosives, but failed every single one of them : the bombs did as little damage as they could (1d6dmg instead of 10d6dmg at max, each). I said that luck almost wasn't on their side, that's because the Wookiee went overkill. He asked the Jedi to plant all 10 of the bombs. So, he cliced the detonator, the bombs exploded, dealt enougth damage to kill all the pirates (even with the bad rolls, 10d6 total are still enougth to kill non-heroic characters). Then chaos came by.\n\nThe first 2 pirates to exit the cantina blew on mines planted by Verd. The next 2 were executed by a Wookiee arbalest and blaster fire. The next 3 splited, lasted a bit longer, giving time to the first mate to make his exit. Some rolls, more rolls, some spray and pray on the Jedi, a few blaster canons shots, a Wookiee raging, charging and clawing, and the pirates were all dead ; some damage done to the players, but still ok. They were happy with their fate. While looting everything, the eard and explosion, looked up to see Verd switching from a smoking hole on top of the warehouse to the second anti-air battery. They resumed their search for loot, then went inside the cantina, asking Verd to stay outside as sentry.\n\n&amp;nbsp;  \nI secretly made some rolls to see if the pirate captain would come back at this time, but I had no luck there ...\n\nSo, Verd is outside, sweeping the area like an automaton would do (at this time, none of them knew he was a droid, Mandalorian armor and all, and you don't ask a Mandalorian tou put down his helmet). The heroes were inside the cantina looting. Jenseen almost went for a drink, but decided not to, and went out to search the repair bay then start moving the crates of weapons. Sadonac went with her to move the crates ; they had asked their pilot to come with his ship. Inside the cantina, Rumpawarro found a bit of loot : a datapad, some credits, a few weapons (all weapons not taken by the heroes were added to the crates). Esylis found the captain room, and stole his red pirate coat and his hat ! (they look like Hook coat). After more moving of crates, they departed to space in their transport with Verd and the crates on board.\n\nHyperspace in Star Wars is not instant, it can take up to 1 month to go from one side of the galaxy to the other if not using hyperspace highways (at least in my setting). So in the meantime, Verd put himself up to date, and decided to stick with the heroes to crush some fool Mandalorians following a puppet Mandalore. You see, Verd is the creation of XXX Ordo, of the Ordo clan (the same clan Canderous Ordo is from). Esylis is still the de facto leader of the group, and working for the Republic. Sadonac is a Jedi. Rumpawarro don't like Sith and slavery, but likes Esylis, so he stuck around too. Jenseen hates the Sith, the Sith Empire, what they did to her people, so yeah, she too stuck around so she could kill them.\n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nThey soon met with a IMG big transport, unloaded the crates into another transport so he could finish the run, were paid and transported to Alderaan to chill out until the next session.\n\nAll in all, it was a good first session to have them do some roleplay, have a look on a few combats, a lot of fun with the aliens and the dice. That was their first game of Star Wars, and they wanted to continue it.\n\nNext time : how the pirate captain tried to take revenge on them.\n\nTL;DR : how a bunch of guys took back some weapon crates from a pirate.\n",

        "text": "In our last adventure, our home town was in danger of being destroyed by a hobgoblin army, so, being the most handsome and intelligent of the party, the town sent me to negotiate for the city. Upon arriving, the hobgoblin warlord tells me that they will leave the city intact if they get the mystical sword of Maglubiyet (the goblin god) back from the city. \n\nUnfortunately, the sword is no longer there. It had been moved to the capital city years ago, but when I tell him this, he claims that a demigod of  Maglubiyet told him this and accuses me of being a liar. Knowing a bad diplomatic situation when I see one, I continue to dig a hole in the ground by claiming that the demigod is a liar. He then tells me to leave before he kills me. I then attempt to charm both him and his two guards. He crits.\n\nThe DM rules that he knew exactly what I tried to do and draws his sword, reiterating his previous statement. I take a look at my situation, look at my spell slots available (1, warlock is a bitch at early levels), and eldritch blast the Warlord and run (aka kick him in the dick and leg it), casting invisibility on myself after the warlock wastes his turn brutally murdering one of his guards that I had charmed. The diplomatic situation is pretty terrible, but he maintains that he will leave once he has the sword, whether or not the town survives is moot.\n\nSo after this, we go back to the town and decide to make a fake sword, making sure it seems legit while making sure that the warlord wouldn't be too OP if he has it. One of the items required is holy water, and the paladin manages to obtain it from the head priest. However, he is very concerned about the sword, mainly that the sword would be used for great evil and it would be a perversion of the holy water. Once the sword was completed, they sent me again to give it to the warlord. \n\nNaturally, I used Disguise Self so that I wouldn't be murdered as soon as I set foot in the camp, and I proceeded to comply with all of the warlord's demands. I hand over the sword and leave... promptly disguising myself again as a nondescript hobgoblin and following the army back home. At night, I turn invisible and prepare to steal the sword back.\n\nI approach the warlord's tent and, taking a page from any good spy movie, whistle to get the attention of the guards outside of the tent and sneakibreeki my way inside. The warlord is sound asleep and the sword is placed on a shelf. As I slowly move the sword to my bag of holding, one of the guards notices the sword in a slightly different place than it was before. The DM makes me roll a stealth roll. I crit fail.\n\nFuck.\n\nThe guard returning startles me so badly that I lose my invisibility, and I now look like some jackass hobgoblin attempting to steal the warlord's holy sword. As the warlord wakes up, I accuse him of being a false warlord and yell that I am the chosen of Maglubiyet. I than say, \"The power of Maglubiyet beseeches me!\" and waste my last spell slot turning invisible. The warlord then moves his guards in front of the tent flaps so I can't escape.\n\nKnowing I'm screwed, I summon my familiar outside of the tent side adjacent from me and have him slice open part of the tent. Unfortunately, the warlord notices this, and attacks the sprite. My sprite takes 14 damage. \n\nA sprite's average HP is 2.\n\nWhile the warlord obliterates my familiar, I, slightly traumatized and very guilty, attempt to open the tent on my side. The warlord also notices this, but due to my invisibility, fails to hit me, and I run out the other side of the tent into the forest and escape.\n\nOnce I returned to the town, I gave the sword to the magicians and promptly spent 5 gold getting severely, severely drunk. \n\n",

        "text": "Our party had just started the campaign and were in some little town (Sandpoint I think?). We had hitched a ride from another continent on a slaver ship. Which one of our party members bought (Unintentionally). \n\nSome background: Our party is a bunch of level one first-time players. I am the only person who actually made their own character and read the rulebooks. Our GM has all kinds of homebrew systems in place, so things may be different than normal. I play a paranoid wizard with a cape and mask obsession. Also, the party has twelve people. More evidence that our GM is insane.\n\nWhile the rest of the party was enjoying some kind of hippie festival, I was buying dog sausages from some guy in a back alley. Our alchemist, however, was attempting to purchase a child from an orphanage. Our alchemist is an alcoholic. Our alchemist reeks of booze. Our alchemist is covered in burns from numerous mistakes. Thankfully, they didn't give him the baby he wanted. Unfortunately, he inspired the last guy in the turn order (Some kind of Psychic class, a Occultist I think) to steal a child from his mother. This is how we gained possesion of a nine-year-old named Jimothy. \n\nAfter wiping the floor with some goblins and smoking a boar with a lightning spell, our party was in a tavern of some kind (I wasn't paying much attention; I was helping somebody make a bard character) and upset a serving wench. Actually it may have been my calling her a serving wench. Whatever. Anyways, the Occultist goes down to the orphanage and adopts a child. I was incensed. \nThanks to my authority as party leader, I took the kid back to the orphanage. Do you know what the orphanage told me? No. Refunds. What kind of orphanage cares more about profits than helping kids? Apparently Sandpoint Orphanage Number One! Do you know what the occultist did after I gave the kid back to him? Gave it to the alchemist. Who now thinks it is his son by birth from the wife he misplaced while drunk. The kid turns out to be nine as well, and named Timothy. Apparently Jimothy's mom sold her son's identical twin into an orphanage to make ends meet. So maybe being stolen from that lady was a good thing. I'd just like to know how a party of batshit crazy adventurers (On of them tried to EAT Jimothy) are going to raise two children. Just wait. It gets better.\n\nOur racist (fantasy not ethnic race) orc barbarian decided he wanted a kid too. So, later that night he goes out to find a child to steal. It's a running joke that his character is so stupid he has to roll for everything non-physical. He rolls. He gets a one. The GM interprets this as his orc character not knowing the difference between a child and a calf. The orc walks back into the inn with a cow named Melvin draped around his shoulders. I was literally banging my head on the table at this point.\n\nLast time we played most of the party was going to kill some skellybones in some dead dudes tomb. (Why was every member of the family buried with swords and armor?) Timothy was with his \"Dad\" the drunk-ass alchemist (Who was also watching the cow for the orc under threat of death), while Jimothy was going with his \"Dad\" to become \"A real adventurer\". Both of them have 1 HP and have alternated between crying and picking their noses the entire time they have been in the party. \n\nWhile all of this is quite annoying, I must admit I enjoyed the reaction of the afore-mentioned serving girl when the Occultist started hitting on her. Of course, Jimothy decided that was the best moment to call him \"Daddy\"\n\n      \ntl;dr GM running Rise of the Runelords campaign. Players adopting/kidnapping orphans/baby cows instead\n\n[Edit: First post ever on Reddit, so I screwed up. Wrote the whole thing in edit]",

        "text": "We begin our adventure in a storage room in the lair of Krampus.  The cold dead body of ash is propped against the far wall.  After breakfast, the party salvaged what they could, and headed north to search for an exit.  \n\nWith Gylian in the lead, they carefully made their way along the icy corridors.  Gylian inadvertently walked right into an Ice Cube.  The cold cousin of the gelatinous cube.  He was instantly engulfed and frozen.  Gylian managed to get himself out, and the cube attacked.  Both Gylian and Alli were able to jump out of the way as it slowly moved forward.  Herb slipped on the ice and fell into the slushy mess.\n\nGylian and Alli attacked and reduced the monster to a slushy heap.  Herb got the healing power of Gylian's god as Gylian healed his comrade.  The combat had brought some unwanted attention though.\n\nAlli charged into the next room and attacked a trio of Ice Guardians.  Realizing this was a bad idea, she disengaged and got behind Gylian.  Gylian defended himself as the skeletons attacked.  Their platemail armor giving them considerable defense against the arrows raining down from Alli's bow.\n\nOff in the distance, a strange draconian joined the fray.  It broke its bonds and engaged one of the Ice Guardians.  Herb, while hidden in the shadows, saw this new addition to the fight and jumped in to attack with his quarter staff.\n\nThe draconian blasted his enemy with cold breath, but it was surprisingly not very effective.  The two guardians near Herb attacked and dropped him unconscious.  Meanwhile one of the guardians near Gylian dropped his sword and another is dropped by Alli.  Herb seems stabilized, but to the west, the fight is not going well.\n\nAliru, the draconian, has his throat torn out and then falls unconscious.  Gylian also gets a hit that drops him.  Alli is the last one standing.  She knocked her magical healing arrow and got Gylian back up, getting hit in the process and falling unconscious herself.\n\nBefore getting up Gylian layed on hands and Alli was back in the fight.  By this time, Alli was low on arrows.  She picked up a few from the ground and fired until she took more damage.  She was unconscious again.  Gylian got Herb up with the last of his healing powers, and tried to kill the last of the guardians.  Slipping on the ice, he accidentally slashed Herb in the throat.  Dropping him in the process.  With a final yell, he killed the last of the Ice Guardians.\n\nHis three comrades stabilized, Gylian began a search of the area.  He found the magical longsword, Quintessence, a mysterious blade that the skeletal ice guardians seem to have avoided.  He also found three potions and a small jar of salve (detailed below).\n\nAfter a few hours, the unconscious PCs were up and eating.  They licked their wounds and decided to hole up in the Ice Guardians dining room for the night.  Crad was tied up and could not sleep well.  He woke up exhausted the following morning.  Eating the last of their food for breakfast, the party decided to start the day.\n\nCrad and Gylian tried out the platemail they found on the Ice Guardians, and found it to their liking.  Alli managed to fit a half plate on her human half.  Crad went through three long swords cutting holes for his wings.\n\nGylian decided to have some fun.  Heading to higher ground to the north, he jumped on his shield, and rode through the caverns.  Missing a turn threw him off, and he bounced to the east, flying over a 60 foot cliff, and catching himself at the last second before falling off the next drop.  His shield crashing into the depths.\n\nThis clutter seems to have broken the hibernation of two large dire polar bears.  Their attack interrupted the attempts to get Gylian up.  Herb was able to transform into a bear, but found himself not nearly as powerful as the dire bears.  The first one slipped and fell on top of Gylian, sliding off to smash itself in the depths.  The second one suffered the same fate, but did not die immediately.  \n\nMoving south into the depths of the cavern, the party skinned both polar bears and took as much meat as they could carry.  As they were out of food completely, it was a well needed addition to their supplies.  Gylian managed to find his shield and moved along, searching the rest of the area.  All the while in the depths, the party felt a sense of foreboding.\n\nThis turned out to be true as they rounded a corner and happened on a white dragon ...\n\nWe will begin next session at level 5\n\n**Loot**  \n\n* 3 Doses of Keoghtom's Ointment\n* Potion of Greater Healing (Heals 4d4+4 HP)\n* Potion of Heroism (Adds 10 temp HP and grants the benefits of the bless spell for 1 hour)\n* Potion of Water Breathing\n* Quintessence - +1 Longsword\n* 2 Suits of plate mail armor\n* 1 Breastplate (half a set of plate mail worn by Alli)\n* Everburning Torch (has continual flame cast upon it)",

        "text": "In the frozen wastes around Eleum Loyce, a coffin slammed to a halt at the foot of a circle of broken statues, leaving a great furrow of battered snow. When it finally roared, shifted and squeaked to a halt, it began to move. The heavy lid ground aside just enough for the occupant to squeeze out.\n\nPiff, paff, piff, paff...\n\nThe sound of footfalls crunching and squeaking in the fresh powder was devoured by the enduring hush of the wintry landscape. The snow, whipping through the air, seemed to devour all. The inhabitants. The buildings. Hope. Sight. Dreams. Warmth. None of it existed in this blizzard.\n\nPiff, paff...\n\nThe winter wind bit at the skin of the Bearer of the Curse, freezing and destroying the already mangled mess that was his exposed face. It split against the iron crown atop his head, and every now and then, it would let loose an eerie wail and a haunting light. The wind stirred up the fallen snow and whipped it into an impenetrable wall of white, impossible to navigate through, concealing everything in the frozen wastes. But none of that interested the Bearer. His frostbitten skin was of no importance. Nor was his old and battered crown, frozen to his head. He did not even need his milky white eyes, empty and atrophied, as they occasionally strained against the wall of winter white.\n\nPiff, paff, piff, paff, piff, paff...\n\nThe Bearer shifted his grip on his rapier. That tiny, deadly piece of steel, wrought of iron and fire and darkness and poison. But he didn't even need that. Not yet. Its bite had already found all the threats this land had to offer. There were no shambling figures still wandering these wastes. No, not even a one... they had all perished. The Bearer had killed them. Not hunted them, as sometimes happened, but killed. For the simple reason that they were in his way. The Bearer did not appreciate distractions on his journey.\n\nPiff, paff, piff, paff... thump.\n\nThere it was. The Bearer's foot had just slipped downwards onto a sheet of ice. He was close, now. The snowstorm thinned...\n\nClip, clap, clip, clap...\n\nThe bearer navigated the icy bridge over the menacing gap, wind whipping at his cloak. It didn't scare him. He'd travelled the path a hundred times.\n\nPiff... paff...\n\nHe entered the little crag, and stood still before the wall of fog. This was it. Again.\n\nHe shuffled through his meager possessions. Cloak, crown, boots, gloves... all in working order. Sword, ready. Staff, on standby. Spells, ready to be cast. Rings... first, second, third and... the fourth had to be switched out, as it was broken. He had forgotten to take care of it during the journey. And his consumables... Twelve swigs of his glowing flask, and twoscore of those curious yellow gemstones. Everything ready. Everything accounted for. The Bearer thrust out his hand, and the fog parted. he stepped through, his vision adjusting to the new scene.\n\nA great bowl of snow with one entrance and one exit, both now sealed. And on the sides of the bowl, the Bearer's opponents. Lud and Zallen. Great, black, smoking beasts in the manner of enormous tigers, each of which capable of destroying the feeble Bearer with a single strike of its paws. Lud lazily rose from his position atop the snowbank while Zallen merely watched with curious detachment. Cats...\n\nThe bearer wasted no time. He charged in, rapier flashing with fire, steel, poison and dark, all rolled into a single deadly stroke. And it landed. And he struck, again and again and again. Lud would raise his great claw, and the Bearer would move quick as oil, dodging under the fearsome beast to stab its unguarded flank. A few times, the Bearer was launched free by a lucky strike, and forced to drink from his flask of estus. But the Bearer did not fear the laggard Lud. He was slow, he was stupid, and he was predictable. But just when the Bearer gained the upper hand, Zallen arose from his spot and prowled into the bowl.\n\nThe Bearer hastened his assault, attacking with more frantic strikes. Many of them missed, but enough met their mark. Lud was nearly felled. But now Zallen was complicating things, throwing in the odd claw and the occasional burst of ice. The Bearer could easily dodge one of these beasts, but he could not keep track of two. He retreated. He dodged, he ran, and he used every little opportunity to keep himself alive. Strength meant nothing if you weren't alive to use it, after all...\n\nFinally, the opening he needed. The Bearer did not strike like lightning, but rather like a clumsy cannon, aimed in just the right direction. The rapier plunged into Lud's flank, and the beast roared in agony as it fell, dissolving into the ash from whence it came. Now it was just the Bearer, and Zallen...\n\nThe two circled each other, taking stock, waiting for the opening. Zallen struck, and the Bearer leapt back, quickly using his staff to restore his weapon to peak condition. Another strike. The Bearer dodged, and used the opportunity to renew the enchantment on his weapon. Now it was time. Another dodge, and then he struck. But his eagerness carried him too far, and he was swatted aside by the follow-up attack by the enraged Zallen. The Bearer reached for his flask, lifted it to his mouth...\n\nEmpty.\n\nAs he weaved around the pacing Zallen, he fumbled for the yellow stones. Not optimal, certainly, but they would do in a pinch. He crushed one into powder as he watched the Zallen rear up. He dodged just in time, and countered with a devestating blow. One after another, he dodged, he got the space he needed, and he crushed the stones whenever he took a stray hit. He was winning. But Zallen would not be felled so easily... The beast roared defiance, and with a great tremor, his shimmering black-and-silver coat seemed to ignite with eldritch flame.\n\nThat was alright. It was just more of the same. Same attacks. Same enemy. Just a bit longer before the finish. The Bearer kept his head, and kept up his strategy. Dodge. Stab. Mistake. Reparation. Repeat. He slowly whittled the beast down with his powerful jabs and quick feet, despite Zallen's increasingly desperate attacks.\n\nThen, an opening. The beast was nearly slain, and the Bearer had an opening. He lunged in, sword flashing, laying stab after stab into the exposed flank. Zallen reacted quickly, whirling around and sending the Bearer flying. Both of them on the teetering edge of death. But the Bearer knew not to be overambitious. He dodged the odd strike from the lumbering Zallen, and reached into his pack for the yellow stone...\n\nZallen struck like thunder. He lunged forward, the moment before the Bearer finished crushing his healing stone. His jaw, with his single fang, found the mantle of the Bearer's cape. Triumphantly, it lifted the helpless undead into the air, bit through his heart, and threw his scattered ashes to the ground.\n\nZallen had won.\n\n*Again.*\n\nSome time later, the Bearer of the Curse awakened at the top of a tower, dessicated hands trembling. He had been so close. He sulked in the warmth of the bonfire for a moment, but no more than a moment. He rose to his feet, gripped his trusty rapier, and heaved himself into the heavy coffin perched above the precarious slope. With a scrape and a rumble, it began to tumble into the frozen outskirts below... again...\n\nEventually, he would kill that damn tiger. If it took him until the world itself came an end, he would drag himself up from the ashes, plow through the snowstorm time and time again, and he would fight. And one day, one day, he would win.\n\nPiff, paff...",

        "text": "I thought this episode from out last session was worth sharing.  This story definitely includes the best Deck of Many Things draw I've seen.  \n\nThe characters involved here are Leo the human inquisitor(me,) Jason the suli bloodrager, Novan the tengu bolt ace, and Bruuls the greasy goblin gunslinger.\n\nOur party had just finished clearing out the few remaining guardians of an abandoned cult temple and we were inspecting the contents of the cult's coffers.  We found a large sealed stone chest that contained a several thousand gold and a few magic items.  Leo was the one who opened the chest, and upon seeing that much gold he immediately closed the lid and indicated to Novan that he should keep Bruuls distracted for a bit.  Novan decided that the best way for him to do this was to 'accidentally' fire one of his flare bolts into Bruuls' general area.  With Bruuls temporarily blind and deaf, Leo opens the chest again and scoops the lot of the treasure up into a bag of holding so that the greedy greasy goblin can't get his grabbers on it and demand a bigger share.  Goblin greed avoided and senses restored, we all gathered round to inspect the interesting items.  Aside from gold and gems, there was:\n\n* A whip\n* A suit of leather armor \n* A golden scarab\n* A deck of cards\n* Another deck of cards\n\nAs these objects are drawn from the bag, Bruuls immediately demands the whip for one of his 'escorts,' having recently made an infernal contract that gained him a pair of succubus cohorts amongst other things.  Novan, being a crow person and therefore having an affinity for shiny things, requests the scarab.  Jason, already wearing demon plate and wielding a heavily enchanted greatsword, makes no request.  Leo sets about identifying the items, starting with the three that are still in his hands.  The armor turns out to have a fairly useful enchantment on it, the first deck is a [Deck of Slivering Fate](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/specific-magic-weapons/deck-of-slivering-fate), and the second deck is HOLY SHIT THAT'S A DECK OF MANY THINGS.  Leo, being a paranoid bastard, hides his shock at this discovery and turns to identify Novan's scarab.  This becomes unnecessary as the [Scarab of Death](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/cursed-items#TOC-Scarab-of-Death) comes to life and burrows into Novan's flesh.  Novan has to make a DC 25 Reflex save or he has six seconds before the scarab reaches his heart and kills him.  He's got a +8 Reflex though, so if he's really lucky he might make it.  He rolls and...\n\nNat 1\n\nAt this point there's only one thing that can save out bird friend.  Leo holds out the Deck of Many Things and tells Novan to quickly draw from it.  Since he's about to die anyway, Novan decides to draw four cards.  \n\nI said this story included the best Deck draw I've seen.  Unfortunately it's not this one.  The card Novan drew in order are:\n\n* Talons:  All magic items you possess disappear permanently.  Unfortunately this doesn't include the scarab.  Well at least I still have my magic crossbow...\n* Ruin:  Lose all of your nonmagical wealth and property.  Fuck.\n* Vizier:  Know the answer to your next dilemma.  \"hmm...  you have about five seconds to keep a cursed item from killing you eh?  Hope you last card can help you.\"\n* Comet: Defeat the next creature you meet to gain one level.  Too bad you're about to die.\n\nSo now Novan is still going to die, and on top of it he's broke, naked, and sad.  With only a few seconds left, Jason offers to draw from the deck.  He's either incredibly brave or extremely stupid, because e decides to draw five cards.  After all the players are done reeling from this number, the cards are drawn and the DM swears beautifully about Jason's stupid luck.  In order, Jason draws:\n\n* The Star:  Immediately gain a +2 bonus to one ability score.  Jason's Strength is now 26 when he's raging.  \n* The Moon:  Gain 1d4 wishes.  DM rolls a 4.  Use wish 1 to save Novan and save the other three for later.  That scarab still deals 3d6 damage when it comes flying out of his chest, but that's certainly better than death.  \n* The Jester:  Either gain 10k XP or two additional draws from the Deck.  He took the additional draws.\n* The Fates:  Avoid any situation you choose, once.  well, no concern for drawing The Void now.\n* The Knight:  Gain the service of a 4th level fighter.  Some guy who looks a lot like Jason steps out of the hallway and nods.\n* Eurayle:  Gain a permanent -1 on saving throws.  Fort save is still insane, Ref and Will are exactly as shit as they were before.  \n* Gem: Gain 50K gold in either jewelry or gems.  Diamonds rain from the ceiling.  \n\nMotherfucker drew seven cards and only got the mildest negative card in the deck.  We ended the session there, with a naked tengu in lots of pain, a bloodrager looking very pleased with himself standing in his pile money with his new cohort and even larger muscles, a goblin in a near-catatonic state from seeing that much money appear out of nowhere, and a very confused inquisitor torn between doing something about the naked birdman, fending off the growing goblin greed surge, and drawing from the deck himself.

A Drow society that has been practicing eugenics on Dwarves to create the perfect subservient drones, creating massive slave armies and even bending trolls to their will. \n\nMy party and I were brought to the Drow's City at the command of their Sovereign, whom we had unintentionally been working for.

After many harrowing missteps and near death experiences, we found a large cavern filled with many Harvesters, the magical drill.\n\nOur entrance had attracted the attention of a Drow task master, who was a little unpleased by our presence and moved to eradicate us. After sending some Military Duergar to deal with us and finding out that we were not so easily dispatched the Drow, which we lovingly started referring to as ..... well it was rather unpleasant we'll just call him Captian, ran to his Harvester and began preparations to bring it into action. \n\nSo at this point in my story we’ve met our bad guys, and their tool of Destruction, but not my party (shame on me). First our DM has rules about characters in his play spaces, none of our characters are from anywhere near the setting of the campaign. He’s had bad experiences in the past with people’s ‘home towns’. So there’s my character a Dwarven Cleric named Strax, he’s your average Dwarven Cleric of Moradin, who’s had major issues with the Drow labor program. Then there’s the Party Rouge Mordecai, the players inspiration for Mordecai was the assassins from the Assassin’s Creed series, that kind of code and a general level of sneakiness, our DM even invented a wrist blade for him. We also have a fighter/sorceress Corryl, who’s become famous for a short temper and inquisitive nature, also killing goblins by the score. Last but certainly not least is the Ranger John Jameson, who seems to hate elves beyond all reason, and Drow by extension. So now that I’ve introduced our cast of characters it’s time to begin the story. \n\nWe’ve just exited a tunnel and are staring up at the monstrosity that is the Harvester, when suddenly an arm whiped out from behind the drill head scanned across our group and let loose a [sonic blast] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzY099ihULs). The sound knocked us all prone as the monstrosity began to advance toward us on eight of its many legs.  We stood up, and scattered so as not to provide a single target to the great machine, with the hopes of wounding it to the point of inoperability. I summoned a pair of celestial owls to provide myself and Corryl a more mobile platform from which to operate against the harvester. As my owl flew me closer to the beast another arm appeared from behind the drill head and quicker than any hunk of metal should move snatched me from the owl’s grasp. At this point John had moved into melee range with even more arms that had appeared from behind the drill head. Each of the four arms seemed to be armed with one of the sonic devices, whose primary function seemed to be the softening of stone and ore in the path of the harvester. Corryl and Mordecai had managed to get behind the drilling machine and were attempting to find an access. There was a promising door, which happened to be about 40 feet off the ground. I'd instructed my owl to hang around and be ready to catch me should the arm let go of me. From beneath me, I had ended up sitting on the sonic device, I heard a clicking sound as if the device had warmed up. In response I readied to cast Searing Light should the device open up. John continued to attempt to wound the machine having switched to a leg as the machine relentlessly churned past him. \n\nThe device below me cycled open and I sent Holy fury down into the device which simply shuddered and then was silent. Meanwhile Corryl was sending fireballs into the rear access hatch with little success, and John was having similar amounts of success damaging the leg that had damn near crushed him. Mordecai you ask? Well he was freaking out about suddenly being hauled skyward by a celestial owl he hadn't yet seen. About this time the Harvester or whomever was controlling it decided I was more trouble alive than I was truly worth, and attempted to dispose of me by tossing me into the furiously spinning drill head. If my celestial owl buddy hadn't been paying attention I would have been quickly been turned into a greasy red mist. Instead the owl swooped in and snatched me out of the air mere feet from the spinning drill of death. I then instructed the owl to land me on a cat-walk I had spied behind the drill head. I landed on the empty cat-walk and saw before me a small control room that seemed walled off from me by a magical force, inside was our friend Captain, but he was engrossed in a magical view screen which seemed to allow him to view the outside world from any point on the outside of the vessel. Behind me inside the outer skin was a building which was closed off to me by a set of double doors. I was able to see through the floor to two levels below me, first was the drive shaft for the drill with a cat-walk over top of it, second was another structure of similar size to the one before me which seemed to have a large 'landing' possibly for the handling of ores. \n\nI took a moment to collect my thoughts and what came to me was at the time rather brilliant, I summoned a pair of celestial black bears inside the control room with the Captain. The bears being slightly displeased with their new surroundings took the opportunity to rend the Captain's flesh and bite into him. He had been so focused on piloting the harvester that he had been completely helpless. While all this had happened, my owl had gone to collect John and bring him to the cat-walk I occupied, Corryl and Mordecai had decided fireballs were not helping and instead Mordecai began attempting to take the door off its hinges, a slow process. After being ravaged by the bears The Captain refocused on his surroundings, and simply reached out and drained the life from one of the bears causing it to return to the celestial plane, while the bear became weaker the Captain grew stronger. Suddenly the doors behind me burst open and before me lay half a dozen Duergar. John was dropped off at my side, and together we engaged this latest threat, I told the remaining bear to return to the celestial plane before the captain could attack it. Corryl and Mordecai had finally gained access to the inside of the Harvester and began to creep up a staircase at the rear of the craft. The Captain meanwhile placed a call into what could only be described as Central command for the ongoing Harvester operation, and in Elven began to report our interference here. In plain view of the scrying spell on the other end was the first map of the underdark we’d ever seen. The large chamber in which we fighting the Harvester seemed to be directly below the Dwarven Citadel of Garub-Dur. John understood the conversation in Elven and began to shout objections to the Captain's version of the story, while I started calling the Captain a series of inventive derogatory names. All while slaying a rather large parade of Duergar. Around this time Mordecai and Corryl reached the top level and were confronted with a choice, the staircase they had climbed led to a small landing with two sets of doors heading in opposite directions. They chose to take the set of doors to their right which pointed them toward the back of the Harvester.\n\nInside they found four Drow seated at consoles apparently operating the craft. Deciding to take matters into their own hands Corryl and Mordecai killed one of the Drow and wounded a second. At this point all the Duergar stopped what they were doing and entered a trance like state, apparently one of the Drow had been controlling the Duergar. John and I took the moment to situate ourselves and prepare for the inevitable, John readied his bow and I prepared to cast a Searing Light should the barrier protecting our foe fail. At the back of the craft our companions continued to wreak havoc among the other Drow crew members, until one of them cast darkness upon the chamber, unable to see much of anything Mordecai and Corryl tried to find their targets by memory. As soon as the darkness enveloped the aft end of the Harvester the shield protecting the Captain failed and a number things happened all at once. The Captain cast Prismatic Spray catching John and I as well as all the Duergar in the corridor behind us; John was hit by an orange ray and instantly drenched in acid which began to eat through his belongings and him, I mean while was hit by an indigo ray and was almost over come by a multitude of inexplicable compulsions upon later examination I had almost been driven insane, of the Duergar behind  us all that remained was a single statue. John loosed the arrow he had drawn in the same instant as he'd been hit by the spell but his aim held true, and he was able to hit the Captain in the chest, unfortunately my aim did not hold true as the torrent of thoughts thundered through my mind, instead of the Captain I managed to hit and subsequently disintegrate half the control console. The Captain was quicker to react than either John or myself, and simply stepped forward reached out his hand and drained the life from my body. Thankfully Johns response was to let loose a flurry of arrows which all hit the Captain in the heart. He looked into my face and chuckled, then uttered a simple sentence in common, “It's too late.”\n\nAs the Captain's body crumpled to the catwalk Mordecai and Corryl stumbled out of the darkness to the rear of the craft. We decided to wait until the darkness dissipated before hunting after the remaining Drow crewmen, during that time I scrawled a note to the Dwarven people warning them of the impending attack in the hopes that I could warn them. I attached the note to a feather token and sent it off preying that Moradin would guide it swiftly to his children and they would use the warning to reach saftey. With that done and the darkness gone we all advanced to the stairs and began to descend, about halfway down the staircase we found one of the Drow crew, she had apparently snapped her neck as she tried to flee down the stairs in the pitch black we continued on weaving our way through a group of docile Duergar that had apparently been working on the lower level until we reached the rear access door, from there we could see armies march out of a number of the tunnels, and nearer to us we could see two Drow running away from the Harvester and towards the great lava pit at the center of the cavern.  About half way between the fleeing crewmen and the lake of liquid fire appeared a familiar individual, the Sovereign and in his up raised hand he clutched the crystal Immaru who would grant him untold powers.\n\nI am working on Novelizing our adventures from Strax's perspective if anyone is interested in the whole story.

        "text": "About a year ago I recounted [this tale](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2r3js8/homebrew_how_my_friends_burned_my_pub_down/) of investigation and arson. It was the 2nd part of a 3-act campaign. Now I shall tell you of my part in the 3rd act.\n\nAs with the 2nd act, it's been 15 years since the last act so it's 1909 and the smell of war is in the air. All our PCs have moved on in life but still have that inquisitive nature. Except I suppose for Honesty who's settled down and became an NPC. My guy John has moved in these years from publican to arms broker, a decidely lucrative profession. He no longer fully relies on his muscle to win fights and carried the latest sidearm.\n\nSo enter the mystery. Once again, mysterious killings. Just the one this time, though. But killed in a particular manner, with a red carnation left at the scene. A *modus operandi* that fits one other murder case the Yard kept on file. That of Violet (another PC)'s late husband. So the PC party minus Violet pay her a visit and rope her back into being a PC and away we go. We follow a trail to and across Europe, splitting the party when a second assassin is thrown into the mix (I'll add the result of that as a bonus story at the end).\n\nThe PCs John, Bertie and Violet all end up in Lyon, tracking this \"carnation killer\". We split up to seek him out and, at the end of the session John finds Violet. Dead. - We did this over Skype so the GM was apparently silently RPing over text with Violet's player as the death became a thing.\n\nSo John gives chase. He deduces an exit route and finds a man cleaning off a blade. Immediately John fires his pistol and pursues, meeting up with Bertie along the way. They eventually able to capture the man and find him to be someone known to the PCs (at least the ones from Act 1) - He was a former PC in Act 1, now turned hired killer, and utterly remorseless. Cue the most chilling RP I have ever witnessed, as Bertie and the killer - an old friend - have a calm, sedate talk about what he's done and why. How he feels about it. It ends as Bertie stands, says goodbye, and leaves the room to John, the man, and John's gun.\n\nGunning down mooks in games is utterly detached. Coldly placing a pistol to the head of a named character, a former PC. That's something different.\n\nSo... Bonus story with a dark but different tone.\n\nSo the other guys end up going to I think Hamburg. It's Jack, Nelson and Rosina pursuing an Austro-Hungarian assassin who, in the interim 15 years, had caused a fire that had killed Jack's wife. They planned to capture the guy alive as he was a prominent and important figure. Well. Nelson and Rosina planned to capture him alive. And they did. Then they left Jack alone with him for a few minutes...\n\nThey return to find the man doused in paraffin and set ablaze.",

        "text": "Several months ago I decided to start a series of short stories called Critical Hits and Shits. Then classes started and I decided to be an adult for a while. With that awful experience out of the way, I think it's time for a few more installments. In this episode we'll explore my brief adventure on the GM side of things.\n\nThe cast:\n\nRegulator as the Witch\n\nWazilla as the Other Witch\n\nCuz as the Not Witch\n\nCrucible the barely legal GM\n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n**Prelude**\n\nWazilla was GMing a game for Regulator, my cousin who we'll call Cuz, and myself. He ended early one day and everyone wanted me to run my campaign. This campaign was supposed to be a one off mission only taking one session as a demo to a bigger campaign in a magic school I’d been working on for a while. The problem is I was only half done, and that half wasn't with me. But I pulled something together. The party was sent to the older parts of the school by a pretty...eccentric teacher in order to hunt down a magical clockwork robot with the ability to learn. It wasn't everything, but I decided to use darkness to make the environment and certain details up as I went. \n\n-\n\n**The Trial**\n\nAfter charming their way past 2 guards they get to the place they need to.\n\nMe: *As you push open the doors, you see nothing but pitch black…*\n\nRegulator: *I have darkvision, 60 feet.*\n\nWazilla: *I have darkvision too.*\n\nCuz: *Me too.*\n\nMe: *Oh.*\n\n&gt;PSA: Know your party\n\nAfter a little therapeutic internal screaming, I made a generic, straightforward layout because I’m not creative and we were running out of time by then. They went through a few old, rotting classrooms without much in them. At that point I really just wanted to get them to combat to ~~punch them in the face for making my job difficult~~ get a little experience with the mechanics. \n\nReaching the doors at end of the hallway, they pushed them open to find a large room with a ceiling towering high above them. The opposite side had a door massive enough to cover most of the wall, on either side stood 8 clockwork soldiers in total with a halberd each. They inspected the room and the desk, figured out that behind the giant door was a large storage room for a variety of magical items, and gained the scroll needed to open it. Upon doing the final task, the clockwork soldiers whirred and clicked to life. Well some of them did anyway. The years were not kind to them, so 3 of them started slowly and one kinda just fell over and crawled at them threateningly. \n\nOddly enough, Regulator’s witch, who specialized in head games like charming and shit got first and second place for kill of the week in one turn for setup and another for double execution.\n\nCombat not exactly being her element, the witch backed up until she could jump up on the large desk in the center of the room, after the tinkertoy stabbed at her legs a bit, Regulator looks at me, pauses for a moment, and asks one question that changed my perspective forever.\n\n“How much does this desk weigh?”\n\nYou see, witches have an ability that allows them to use their hair as an appendage with their intelligence determining how much weight they can lift. After a bit of research, my team of desk experts determined that it was probably just within her limit. \n\nSo on her turn she steps back off the desk, grabs it with her hair, lifts it in the air, and as the old soldier looks up at it as confused as a non sentient creature can be, she smashes it down, crushing its lower half and leaving it upper half hanging out from under the desk. After it takes a few hopeless jabs at her ankles, the witch grabs its torso and violently divorces it from its legs. Using the momentum of the sudden snapping apart, she whips her head back like she’s modeling for a demonic shampoo commercial, and marries the recently separated torso with another clockwork soldier in the vicinity, ending in the “til death” part of the vows. There was not a dry eye in the room.\n\nThat’s about where combat ended and we ran out of time. I never actually picked it back up, and at this point I would either restart it or run something entirely different, so there isn’t exactly a satisfying conclusion on the horizon here. Either way I hope the journey was enough of a destination or some other proverb.\n",

        "text": "I sometimes reminisce on my mortal years.  Raised in the North, my barbarian clan followed the paths laid out by a great Lunar.  She taught us to play to our strengths, and work together.  She looked after us, but never coddled us.  I was born to the chieftain of the Full Moons - the warriors and hunters - so I always expected I would fight.  Our lives were simple, but I was happy.\n\nThough peace, especially in the North, sadly cannot last.  One piece of history which is bound to repeat itself is war.  One dark summer day a wounded group of tribesmen was spotted near my home.  I went with my father, brother and other men to meet them.  They were barely alive, bearing the mark of the waning moon; the tribe closest to my own.\n\nThe enemy was unlike anything they had seen.  Great white monsters adorned in unusual armour and viscous looking weapons; lanky human-like folk of unnatural beauty, summoning fire and lightning from their hands; runty creatures who swarmed over their people, pinning them down.  My father heard this and looked troubled.  He asked me, my brother, and some of the greater fighters in my tribe to meet at his home.\n\nWhen we gathered, my father called this meeting a 'battle council'.  Such a council was never called before in my lifetime.  He began with a warning.\n\n\"Whatever enemy attacked the Waning Moon tribe will come here.  We must be ready.  Those creatures are from the Wyld, a place beyond our world.  I have been lead to believe they are known as 'fair folk'.  Moonlight's Talon -\" the Lunar who watched over us \"- did express concerns that a war on our tribes may erupt this decade, and told us to gather weapons.\"  He walked over to a corner of the room and kicked back some furs to reveal an armoury of iron weapons.  \"It is not enough to arm each member of our tribe.  However, I wish to speak of strategy with this council.\"\n\nWe speak of bringing the fight to the monsters themselves.  \"We should scout out their location and learn their numbers.  Gather our resources to defeat them.  This is the best way to ensure we aren't heading to a battle we cannot win.\"\n\nScouts were sent.  Their numbers were in the hundreds, outnumbering us four to one.  But we did not lose faith.  The monsters would have to travel through a mountain pass to reach our tribe.  We would meet them there.\n\nOn the horizon we saw many enemies advance as we took our places, springing a trap.  We caused the snow to fall in a great avalanche.  We watched as it buried most of the small ones, but the graceful and larger ones avoided the trap completely.  Having no other choice, our battle began.\n\nDuring the fight I tried to find my father.  He was engaged fighting with a particularly cruel looking man, ears long and pointy.  The man's armour seemed ornate, wielding an almost delicate looking mace.  I moved through the battle toward him, to try and help.  After an effortless parry, the man slammed his mace down, my father's skull crumpling beneath it.\n\nI ran to him, seeking revenge.\n\nI tried to sink my blade in to his side, but the man moved with incredible speed.  I was knocked backwards by a hefty swipe, as the world turned silent and fuzzy.  When I regained my senses, I looked upon the battlefield and saw that my people were not winning this fight.  My eyes were drawn back to the man as he glided toward me, mace held low.\n\nI struck at his arm, determined to disarm him, but he avoided me with ease.  He pulled his blow, toying with me, knocking me down a second time as my weapon slid out of reach.\n\n\"Stay down.  You entertain me.\"\n\nOnce again I found my feet, throwing myself into a tackle.  Yet again he stepped away, this time smashing the back of my head as I fell.\n\n\"Oh please, stay still.  I want to show you my world!\"\n\nI felt the warmth of my blood drip down my neck and across my jaw, offsetting the cold of the snow.  For the last time I stood, concussed and dazed, driven only by one thing.\n\nThe desire to protect my family.\n\n\"...I will not kneel to you.\"\n\nI threw myself at him, putting all that I had left into one final punch.  The moment my fist connected I felt a rush of power surge through me, from my feet up through my body, my arms and my head.  The man was knocked flying by the force of my attack, landing several feet away from me.  I looked down at my hands as my vision came back into focus, feeling the unbelievable sensation of power beneath my fingertips, coursing through my veins and burning in my chest.  I was no longer human.  I had become more.\n\nI noticed the man approach once again, only to see him struck from above by arrows.  I looked up and saw flying men and women with the wings of birds, raining down a barrage of arrows onto the monsters.  The man with the mace was grabbed by a huge bird of prey, picked up and tossed miles in the direction of the sea.  The bird then quickly changed into the shape of a woman: Moonlight's Talon.  She let out her battle cry, signalling her birdmen from above to swoop down and join the fray.\n\nTogether with our patron's forces, the fey menaces were slain.\n\nAfter the battle, Talon took me under her wing.  I learned that I was now like her, the chosen of Luna.  She taught me what it meant to be Exalted, of the Silver Pact and the Solars, and guided me through training.\n\nI left my family as Bjorn Månunklo, oldest son of our chief.  When I returned to them, I was no longer that man.  I had become who I am today - Wyld Skinner, Seneschal of the Sun Kings, and defender of our lands.\n",

If you don't get any of the terms (it's very Doctor Who) then I'll refer you to: http://tardis.wikia.com/\n\nSo plot is: AU Whoniverse where the Master chose to regenerate (into Idris Elba) and travel with the Doctor after the events of The Last of the Time Lords. In this universe, the Doctor dies in the events of Journey's End and the Master goes on a mad quest to bring him back. It involved creating a clone of the Blue Box and attempting to destroy the solar system so Torchwood 4 stepped in. With the help of Jack Harkness, River Song and Susan Foreman, we managed to stop the destruction of the solar system, causing the Master to time ram us with his TARDIS while we were in the Blue Box TARDIS (we stole it from UNIT)\n\nIf you don't know what I time ram is, it's where two time travelling devices attempt to occupy the same point in space-time, resulting in the destruction of one or both of them. Since these TARDISes were practically identical (and sentient) this wasn't completely catastrophic but it did shunt half of the party into the Master's TARDIS. We were able to have some manner of communication and the final \"episode\" culminated with my character (named John) in the Master's TARDIS while the rest of the party was in the Blue Box. We managed to resolve the time ram by simultaneously travelling in different directions in time.\n\nAnd then the Master shows up. 'Cause he was still in his TARDIS. He's not happy with our meddling and starts a fistfight, which John wins. And he's sort of... Human+. When John hits, he hits **hard**. So the Master gets all his ribs smashed and is forced to regenerate... Into River Song! (This is AU so that whole Melody Pond thing isn't canon in this universe).\n\nThe Master/River then, because newly-regenerated Time Lords are OP as all hell, sidesteps John's next attack and throws him out of the TARDIS doors into the swirling Time Vortex (did I mention the TARDIS was in-flight?). Hell of a way to leave a hell of a campaign.",

I’ll probably be by the phone today.”\n\nThe sun was bright, but the city was peaceful and calm. Despite the bright noon light, Larry found plenty of dark shadows around Sara’s house. With a deep patience developed over years of office drone tedium, he sat in the shadows, observing through the windows, vigilant. He saw a very depressed girl looking sadly at something, but he could not see what was in her hand! He sensed no danger, so the three decided to knock on her door and attempt a simple deception: tell Sara that Trevor said they should ask her for help.\n\nSara answered the door, and at the mention of Trevor’s name invites them inside. Larry sees that she was looking at a picture of Hugo. The four became fast friends, and bonded over the loss of the troubled philosophy student. Sara, meanwhile, slowly filled in the gaps in the story:\n\nShe and Hugo, Trevor and Elizabeth; the two couples became friends this semester. Soon they met an older friend, Mondo Green, who had a lot of money... and “jobs.” The jobs were to beat people up, people that owed other people money. Last week, Hugo took it too far, and almost killed a deadbeat. Trevor and Elizabeth finished the job; they killed the guy they were supposed to beat up. Hugo felt guilty, he told me all about this, and said that he was going to go to the police and confess everything. Trevor and Elizabeth didn’t like that, so they killed him and made it look like a suicide.”\n\nSara announced her plan: she was going to kill Elizabeth and Mondo. The group was in. Hugo’s vengeance was at stake. \n\nSara showed the group a handbill for a concert: “Warehaus 1, 12/23, THE END OF THE WORLD!!! Featuring, JULIE JULY, NO COVER.” \n\nElizabeth and Mondo were huge fans of Julie July. They would be at this concert; Sara knew where the secret “Warehaus 1” was on the west coast of the island, tucked away in a desolate wasteland of concrete and alien industrial mysteries.\n\nPeople were already walking toward the warehouse. The group split up, to watch the back door and front door, but it didn’t matter. The place is soon flooded with people. The concert is packed; anyone could have gotten past them, they decided. The group went inside.\n\nJulie July sang on stage, and the song inspired Larry, Soren, Sara, and Jade. Sara felt her fandom renewed, and the rest of the party were quickly fans of the singer’s fast-paced technopop. \n\nThe crowd swelled, and the group had difficulty staying together. Soren and Sara ran off to the side, into a large dark alcove away from the concert.\n\n“Hello Sara.” It was Elizabeth, axe resting on her shoulder. Quickly she swung, nearly gutting Soren. Soren stared in horror at his own intestines could be see through the wound! He fired back; she dodged. The bullet only grazed her.. \n\nLarry saw the flash, and ran to help. Jade followed, unsure what the hell was happening.\n\nSara pulled out a large knife, swung, and missed. Elizabeth was fast. Very fast. She chopped again, a terrible smile on her face, hacking into Soren’s shoulder. Soren fired back; Elizabeth dodged again! Fuck!\n\nLarry has been waiting his entire life for epic combat, and as the music pulsed, he attacked with everything he had, slashing Elizabeth across the face. Blood poured down her face.\n\nJade finally understood what was happening. She prepared for combat.\n\nElizabeth threw a smoke grenade, filling the area with a cloud and hiding inside. One by one, the friends swung and fired into the cloud. Nothing happened.\n\nOut of the shadows, she attacked, sending her axe deep into Jade’s thigh with a laugh! Sara noticed Elizabeth still had a bandage from the spike that had impaled her the day before. She jabbed her knife into the wound, and Elizabeth just grinned back. She kicked Jade and chopped with all of her might, driving her ax deep into Jade’s back. Jade would die, and Elizabeth just stood there in the flashing lights, as the music pounded in the background, as Soren fired three shots into her chest. She died smiling. Larry checked her pulse, nothing. \n\nSara was small, but she was head Cheerleader at Sol Santo State; she had no trouble carrying Jade outside into the alleyways to the nearest payphone.\n\n“Zhang you gotta come get us!”\n\n“I have a truck, give me the address.” \n\n10 minutes later, Zhang showed up and they loaded Jade into the bed of the truck. Zhang sped the group back to his lab. Surgery was fast; it was successful. Jade would live. The other wounds were stitched and stapled; the slow healing process could begin. \n\n“Looks like you’re staying here again.”\n\n***\n\nLate at night, Soren called Adam Blaze.\n\n“What do you know about Mondo Green.”\n\nFor a while the phone was silent.\n\n“You’re really in the shit, aren’t you?”\n\n“Really?”\n\n“Mondo Green is bad news. I’d stay away. People around him have a habit of being dead. No one knows where he’s from or what he’s doing but people in the bar sometimes whisper his name... and they shudder as they do it.” He hung up.\n\nSoren decide that now would be a great time to give in to his paranoia, and would not sleep or move for hours from Zhang’s security feed. He watched the door to the lab. He had no intention of fighting Mondo Green. He would stare at the cameras and he would be safe.\n\nZhang, Jade, and Sara basically said “Fuck it all” as well. They watched a Christmas special on television, but inside each of them thought about what Soren told them his contact said. \n\nJade left her manic phase, and fell deep into depression. The commercials on television didn’t help much.\n\nOnly Larry stayed on task, determined to find out something on Mondo Green. After hours of sorting through results, he found a forum post by “Mondo Green” on a philosophy forum. The post simply read.\n\n“Life is meaningless, nothing matters.”\n\nLarry checked every post on the forum, most were gloomy nihilistic arguments. Some were about the logical necessity of suicide. Larry thought he might have nightmares. Several posts were by Hugo. They were darker than he expected.\n\nHe hacked the forum server, and found Mondo’s email address. He sent a simple message:\n\n“Meet us at Warehaus 1; Noon.“\n\nWithin minutes, “See you there.” \n\nDepression or not, it was time. “Be careful,” Zhang said, “I’ll have the operating table ready and the engine running.”\n\n“Thanks. We’ll need it,” grunted Soren. It was time to take the offensive.\n\nThey walked across the city, with the memory of Julie July’s song still stuck in their heads. It gave a strange sense of courage in the face of unknown odds.\n\nThe city was quiet at noon. It was cold and thunder ripped through the air. The warehouse doors were open.\n\nInside, Mondo, a man in his thirties with long hair and a trench coat, stood contemplating the three corpses hanging from the ceiling.\n\n“What the fuck!” yelled Soren. he drew his gun.\n\n“You don’t have to attack me, I won’t hurt you.”\n\nSoren believed him. Mondo had no weapon, he made no sudden motions, he seemed at ease. Still, he didn’t lower his gun.\n\n“I didn’t kill these people, they killed themselves.”\n\nThe friends were horrified to think that Mondo might be right. “I just suggested,” he said,”that they end their suffering.”\n\nLarry and Jade felt nauseated.\n\n“Let’s talk,” Mondo said, “and if you don’t like what I have to say, you won’t have to kill me. I’ll kill myself.”\n\nSoren wanted to shoot Mondo Green in the chest, but he put his gun away and prepared himself to listen to what Green had to say.\n\nMondo looked at the four friends: “I see your guilt, your frustration for losing Hugo, whom you loved.”\n\nEveryone knew it was true, and Mondo’s words infected their minds with an unnatural gloom.\n\n“You’re afraid,” said Larry, “afraid you aren’t as tough as you pretend to be. You really didn’t kill anyone did you? You’re afraid you couldn’t kill someone if you had to, that you aren’t as dangerous as some of your friends.”\n\nMondo’s face showed only the slightest sign of registering the provocation, but Larry felt inspired. Fuck this guy.\n\nOther launched insults. Mondo shrugged them off. He smiled. “There is more… the guilt of murder. Even though Trevor and Elizabeth were your enemies you feel responsible for the loss of human life.”\n\n“Bullshit,” yelled Soren, “I don’t a damn thing about their death!” But then, why was his hand shaking so badly? He tried to muster a retort, but the words jammed in his mind, a confusing babble and an endless loop of nonsense. He could say nothing. It was true.\n\nHe dropped his gun. Soren stared into the darkness; he gave into total despair and refused to help his friends anymore. Nothing mattered.\n\n“Fuck you Mondo Green,” Larry said, drawing help from Sara and Jade, “You’re just a bully. You hurt others because you’re afraid.”\n\nMondo was take aback. Yes, he felt good. This was true. Maybe he did want to die, but he’d make everyone else die first. Anger filled his thoughts, buzzing in the background. Anger at the world, for being so painful no matter what one did. Anger at himself, for becoming a monster. Anger at Hugo, for dying so easily to his suggestion.\n\n“I know what it’s like. I feel in you the pain and suffering of an unfair life, of condition stacked against you. Look at these these,” Green motioned at the hanged corpses, “look how peaceful they look, no longer burdened by the world’s inequalities. You can end it now, and be at peace”\n\nSoren stared off into the distance, already far gone, ready to accept a noose.\n\nEveryone else thought thought Mondo had a point. They were all afraid of failing, guilty about Hugo’s death, and worn out from fighting. Maybe it was time to cash out.\n\nSara let herself feel the full force of this despair, bringing her to the brink of sanity. For an instant, she accepted the darker aspects of her depression and even wallowed in how she missed Hugo. “You think you know depression Mondo? You don’t know shit. You’ll never know what it’s like to lose someone. You don’t even care. Enough. There is your rope, just fucking kill yourself: that’s the only thing left for you to know, the cold embrace of nothing. You’re afraid of yourself because you hate yourself and deep inside it’s you that wants to die so just do it.”\n\nMondo Green smiled and handed a crumpled note to Larry. Larry read it to himself, unbelieving. He showed it to the rest. In Mondo's scrawling hand it said \"------ is ready for you,\" with an address scribbled near the bottom of the page.\n\nIn the middle of the warehouse, there was a fourth noose already hanging. Mondo dragged a metal chair under it, climbed up, and fit the rope around his neck. Without saying a word, he kicked the chair away and a few minutes later spasmed in death.\n\n***\nLarry, Soren, Jade, Zhang, and Sara will return in Part 3…\n...Merry Christmas Eve, Sol Santo, 1996",

        "text": "Orders fly through the air like bullets.  \"Court, man those guns; Kaleb, help Odette with the sensors and make sure our men keep their Nerve!  Zez, keep this boat afloat,\" Klaus tightens his grip on the helm, \"and Odette, I don't know what your powers can do but now would be the time!\"\n\nWe all take up our places.  While Odette is still dazed I frantically type away, leaving no rock unturned as our sensors scan the area.  Any normal scan would come up empty with all of this interference from the asteroids.  I however, am no ordinary crew member.\n\nThe secrets of the ships are revealed to me, their locations around us as well as their class and weapons.  First there is a light cruiser, equipped with macrocannons and lance.  A tempest class frigate, also with macrocannons, and a sword class frigate - with only a lance, indicating that all ships perform best at close range.  As I look at them all I realise, we don't know which is Fell's.  The transmission could have been sent from any of the three.  When we met him those weeks ago we never actually *saw* his ship (this is a terrible oversight on my part).  Is it worth the time and effort trying to trace which target we should aim for?\n\nConsidering if the Inquisitor gets away, it could spell much more trouble for us later.\n\nOut from in front of us the warp itself opens up once again, as the beast makes its entrance.  I can only imagine the confusion and terror our enemies are experiencing.  This should give us an edge.  I don't believe they will be quite as suicidal as we are to try and fight the kraken.  Slowly it begins to swim through the void, looking as if it has not decided on which ship to swallow first.\n\nIt's times like these I wish I found comfort in prayer.\n\nOne of the ships - the tempest class - immediately starts to flee.  The light cruiser, furthest away from us and the kraken, appears to be deciding on a plan of action while the sword frigate manoeuvres around us, ready to strike with its lance.  It fires, but our shields hold strong.\n\n\"No you don't!\" Our ship sways as Klaus performs another crazy piloting feet.  Somehow managing to swing our hefty vessel around ninety degrees, he lines up our guns with the sword frigate whom worked so hard to strike us from the aft, and the monstrous warp kraken.  With the ship so close by, away from the asteroids, our sensors have no trouble getting a closer look.\n\n'The Gilded Vision' as it seems to be named, is equipped with all manner of luxuries and ancient components from Mars.  The Titanforge lance is but the tip of the iceberg, with much of the ship space dedicated to decadent passenger quarters, an observation dome and trophy room.  Despite this, there is a strong military presence with sizable barracks, leaving it at anyone's guess whether this is Fell's ship or one lead by the Inquisition.   \n\n\"Our guns are locked and ready when you are Court.\"  Odette relays, a message no sooner received than acted upon.  Court commands the crew in our macrocannon chamber, who are now completely made up of the mysterious strangers from the Righteous Path.  All twelve of our guns fire into the Gilded Vision, powering through their shields and crippling its hull with critical damage.  The new crew appear to be not only capable, but exceptional.\n\nAs if just getting warmed up, Court continues his onslaught bringing our bombardment cannons online.  Aiming between the warp-beast's eyes our ship fires from the other side.  The hit connects, pelting the kraken with magma bombs.  Our weapons seem to anger it, but fail to leave any scars.  It however, seems to have finally decided upon a target, stretching its tendrils out towards us.\n\nKlaus begins to give orders for evasive action when our fore is suddenly struck by powerful torpedoes, fired from the light cruiser.  Our shields are useless as our marcocannons take damage once again, undoing Zez's hard work fixing them before.  They are still operational, but limited heavily.  The cruiser begins to move closer but carefully, using the asteroids to its advantage as cover.\n\nSeeing we are weakened from a surprise attack, the kraken lashes out at us with a gargantuan ungainly tentacle, latching onto us.  It wraps around another, pulling us closer to its hellish maw, simultaneously crushing our hull and preparing to eat us alive.  In a panic Klaus twists and turns, but not even his exceptional skill can force the beast to relinquish its grip upon us.  Time is growing short; with the beast literally upon us our guns would do us damage as well as it.  Will an all out attack be enough to kick it back while not blowing ourselves to pieces?\n\nDo we have any alternative?\n\nI use our ship's eyes to scan for a weak point, but even at such a close range find no notable part of it to lock on to.  Odette picks up from where I left off, using her superior senses of perception.  \"I've locked on sir - only just.  Make this one count.\"  Thankfully she has managed to give Court a place to aim: into the mouth of the beast.\n\nCourt takes a breath, looking over at Zez next to him communing with the machine spirits.  \"After I destroy this thing Zez, I'll need you to be ready.\"\n\n\"Aye Sir!\"  Zez enthusiastically replies.\n\n\"Because\" Court turns back to his screens, \"this is going to hurt.\"\n\n\"...aye sir...\" After a more dejected response we all brace ourselves as Court barks orders to the marcocannons, shortly after launching shells from all of our guns straight into the inners of the fleshy warp kraken.\n\nThe bridge shakes uncontrollably as the impact from our own guns begins to scrape the hull to pieces.  Alarms sound, warning our ship integrity is at seventy percent and falling.  Through all the madness my Lord remains at the helm, waiting for exactly the right moment to strike.  After the first round of shells is launched, Klaus pulls back hard on the wheel, kicking off as the marcocannons once again fire rapidly into the kraken.  It flails in agony, not able to soak such a beating at once, as we wiggle free of our impending doom.\n\nThe force from our cannons blow us back further, the alarms signalling our hull is once again heavily damaged, closing in on fifty percent.  However I am glued to the screens watching the warp monstrosity writhe in pain, until finally the last few rounds of the marcocannons strike it true, searing its maw and blowing away chunks of its face.  When our guns are finished firing, a silence falls over us as we watch for its next action.\n\nBut it no longer moves.\n\n\"Don't think I've forgotten about you.\"  Court like a man possessed takes no time soaking in this victory, firing up the bombardment cannons.  The specialised crew target the light cruiser, our shells soaring through their shields in answer for their torpedoes, finding their mark flawlessly as their hull takes critical damage.\n\nInterrupting our comms, we receive an unexpected call from below decks.  My Lord answers, and on one of the screens appears an unknown man - now clothed - whom the others seem to identify as the leader of the Righteous Path's crew.  He looks to be of similar age to my Lord and I, though just by looking at his face I see something incredibly off-putting about him.  Devoid of all emotion, his face is not only neutral but completely empty of feeling.\n\nLike a living machine.  \"Lord Winters, I have a suggestion.\"\n\n\"I'm listening...*you*.\"  Klaus responds.  Don't tell me we never found out his name...\n\nHow did my Lord ever convince him to help us without learning such vital information?  Why do I always seem to miss opportunities my talents lend themselves to?\n\nI suppose it's too late to lament this now.\n\n\"There are more people than we need down here.  I noticed you had ships we could use at the ready.  Some of my crew and I could board one of the enemy ships.\"  I look to my Lord, having no battle experience to draw upon myself.\n\n\"Why not take the Teleportarium?\"  Klaus asks.\n\n\"With all the asteroids,\" the stranger replies, \"I trust more in my people's skill to get us there safely.\"\n\nKlaus' eyes light up, the rest of his face following, as he gets what is bound to be another daredevil's idea.  \"Then I hope to see you join me aboard the light cruiser shortly.\"  The stranger nods, ending the call as his men rally to our ships and make their way to the light cruiser.  My Lord turns to us, yelling.  \"Somebody take the wheel!\"\n\nOne of the void farers catch the helm as Klaus sprints off towards the Teleportarium, Oathsworn guard in tow, hell bent on risking his life to travel through the asteroid field.  The void farer moves the ship towards the light cruiser, making the jump more likely, but the crew seem shaken by all that has happened left in the wake of their captain leaving.\n\nDoesn't that fool realise just how much his presence inspires the men alone?\n\nWith no time to worry about Klaus' reckless plan, I take it upon myself to jump onto the vox, spouting stories of our esteemed and noble Lord's heroism.  I go on and on as he does when trying to impress the ladies of the court, a stream of words so farfetched it's akin to more of a work of fiction than reality - so outlandish it's as if he were here himself telling it.  While I blather on Zez rushes about to our damaged macrocannons, returning again in record time having made them as good as new.  A mixture of my babbling and our Explorator's astounding skill puts the men at ease, inspiring them to finish this confrontation once and for all.\n\nOver comms we hear that my Lord has successfully arrived on the light cruiser with his men, as he starts to cause mayhem from the inside.  The stranger hails us once again, requesting that we take down the light cruiser's shields.\n\n\"Without their shields, boarding will be considerably easier.\"\n\n\"I think I can manage that.\"  Klaus gleefully responds, having a trick up his sleeve.  Our captain begins to run through the vessel, throwing a healthy supply of melta bombs throughout the place, causing quite the fire, as the Oathsworn do what they do best.\n\nSince my Lord is tarnishing the light cruiser, the rest of us set to work on the other two ships.  Odette - now manning the sensors seeing that I control the vox - locks onto the Gilded Vision with fatal precision, as Court and the stranger's crew overpower it with sprays from the macrocannons.  It is now completely crippled - unable to run or fire back.  A sitting target.\n\nCourt then turns his attention to the tempest class frigate that has been desperately trying to escape ever since the kraken first appeared.  In accordance to his pattern thus far he fires our bombardment cannons in its direction, hindering its escape, as for the third time on as many ships our strikes inflict critical damage.\n\nMeanwhile my Lord's attacks upon the light cruiser have started to take their toll.  Their shields are successfully taken down, allowing the stranger and his men to swarm and join the fray.  Dressed in our Oathsworn garb and armour the crew of the Righteous Path display their exceptional prowess for killing and brutality, ripping the crew to shreds and making tactical use of my Lord's excursions.  \n\n\"Their crew is approximately at seventy percent... sixty percent... fifty percent...\"  He updates us periodically.  Such an effective killer on our side is astounding, but dangerous if we do not take the time to know his motives.  I make a note to speak to this very intriguing individual once this is all over.\n\nSeeing that the stranger and his crew have the light cruiser more or less handled, Klaus calls upon the Tech Priests in the Teleportarium to beam him back once again with his crew, to deal with the remaining ships.  He returns to the bridge, wiping the sweat off his brow, just in time to see the tempest frigate powering up its warp drive.\n\nWe try to out manoeuvre and strike it, but our bulky vessel is unable to do so in its state against one more designed for evasive action.  The tempest class rips into warp, through the void - and lost.\n\nSoon after one of the Junior members of staff relays that the light cruiser is hailing us.  Klaus strides over to his throne, taking his seat before answering the call.  Our holograms power on, displaying the stranger from the Righteous Path.  He is covered in blood, but none appears to he his.  His expression is the same robotic look as before, seemingly unchanged by the violence or the pandemonium still going on behind him, while his crew begin to execute our enemy's staff.  He holds the captain of the vessel in an outstretched hand - A woman, who we have not seen since so long ago at the start of all this in Port Wonder.  One of Fell's commanders.\n\n\"What would you have me do with her?\" He asks.  I wonder, would she ever divulge any of her Captain's secrets?\n\n\"Dispatch of her.\"  Klaus commands, waving it off as if it were nothing.  \"We have no need for her.\"\n\n\"Very well.\"  Before anything else can be said - before even she has time to react - the stranger takes her head between his hands and crushes her skull.  I quickly close my eyes prior to witnessing any explicit gore or viscera gush out of her head, only re-opening them once her body thuds to the floor, no longer visible.  The stranger is still there, shaking the woman's remains from his fingers.  \"Now seems like the time to bring up the topic of payment.\"\n\nI turn to look at Klaus, unsure if he is as shaken as I am from the shocking dispatch of our rival's subordinate.  He is, as always, completely unreadable to me in this situation.  \"What is it that you want?\"\n\n\"This ship.\"  His answer is short and simple.  \"My people took it for you.  It seems only fair.\"\n\nMy Lord ponders this.  \"If you declare your allegiance to House Winters and fly under our flag, you may keep the vessel.  Providing you pay a tide.\"\n\nThe stranger stares silently for a moment, giving the offer some thought.  \"Done.\"  With that, the deal is complete as quickly as it began.  \"I also request this ship be amended for my needs.\"\n\n\"Of course.\"  Klaus claps his hands together.  \"By the way - what is your name?\"  So we really didn't know his name...\n\n\"Khan.\"  Our new captain reveals.\n\n\"Well Khan,\" Klaus nods, \"we'll be in touch.\"\n\nShortly after our brief conversation with Khan, the defeated Gilded Vision hails us, officially surrendering.  We see the face of, to no one's surprise, an old man draped in symbols of the Inquisition, meaning that the ship who slipped through our fingers could only have been controlled by our enemy Fell.  It would seem that today would not be the end of our rivalry, but instead just the start of our inevitable victory against him.  We cut our losses, put the Inquisitor's crew under arrest and bring Aeskepolis himself aboard into the brig.\n\nAfter everything that's happened today, it seems that we have finally won.\n\n[Start](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3dfr45/tales_from_a_seneschal_rogue_trader/) | [Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3xlc9d/rogue_trader_tales_from_a_seneschal_part_16/) | [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/43ljsf/rogue_trader_tales_from_a_seneschal_part_18/) | [Last](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/43ljsf/rogue_trader_tales_from_a_seneschal_part_18/)",

        "text": "I wrote this up a while ago. It's cheesy/cliche, but bear with me: There were three of us. M:myself, R:my wife, and J: my wife's brother/my best friend.\n\nWe were normal modern people living normal modern lives. We played dnd/videogames, worked nightshifts at convenience stores, this was our real life.\n\nOne day, we slipped through a crack in reality, (a long and unimportant story) and found ourselves in the Forgotten Realms, all level 1.\n\nI became a Fighter and eventually Ur-priest, J learned to wield a blade as well as arcane magic, and R took up the shield and code of a paladin.\n\nWe adventured, we grew in power, we had fun and saved worlds, that's what dnd is all about right?\n\nJ and I got bored, we wielded immense power and were always seeking to test it and the world around us. To us, the npcs were just that, npcs. \nWe didn't care if one or two got hurt, not really. We started experimenting with some stuff that we had read about sacrifice, and had a blast making fun and interesting new gear.\n\nR had a problem with this.\n\nSo we stopped telling her what we did. We started to play around with grafts, warping creatures, building monstrosities. It was all a game to us.\nSo long as no one we cared about got hurt, it didn't matter. We were having fun.\n\nThen R found out, she got angry, she felt betrayed, we both loved her, but couldn't empathize with her point of view.\n\nShe eventually tried to stop us.  She had established herself as a champion of all that is good and holy.  With some heavy support from a collection of good deities, she set out to stop our evil and save our souls.  \nShe came at us hard, leading an army of angels and inevitables against our twisted workshop and various headquarters.\n\nWe cut them down, unleashing our hordes of twisted half-men. We didn't care if our \"forces\" fell, necromancy was easy at this point.\nThe armies clashed again and again, but neither gave way.\nShe didn't want us dead, she wanted us stopped.\nWe didn't wish her harm, we just wanted to carry on with our \"harmless\" fun.\n\nFor her holy crusade, she was gifted with beautiful white-gold armor, wings made of light, a halo of fire. It was incredible to behold.\n\nJ and I didn't recognize her as she carved through our undead and mutants. We assumed it was just a powerful angel, crashing through our latest base. We figured it was just another pointless npc when we cut her head from her shoulders.\n\nWhen her head fell from the helm...we broke.\n\nThe shock, guilt, and pain was unbearable. I immediately tried to restore her. I used every Resurrection magic I knew, but to no avail. **You can't bring someone back if they don't want to return.**\n\nWe didn't care. J and I, we climbed through Mt. Celestia.  Our armies devoured everything in our path.  We tore her soul back from the heavens. We bound it, screaming, to her body.\n\nThe evil that we had invoked to do so, the inherent *wrongness* of what we had done, it violated that sacred armor. The gold was stained blood-red, the white ivory charred black. The shape twisted, as if had been rent by a pair of immense hands.\n\nWe were done. Almost everything in that local cosmology was dead, twisted, or some form of the same.  It was Game Over.\n\nJ and I? We had a new purpose, the end of all existence. What cruel reality would allow this?\n\nWe started hopping dimensions, learning what we could of how to end all things. We kept R with us, tethered as a reminder of what fate had forced upon us. Through a combination of transmutation and necromancy, we commanded her body to fight for us and lead our armies.\n\nIt remembered the skill it had in life, but served as an unthinking construct. We made it keep the helmet on, neither of us could bear to look in her eyes, to see the soul we had bound there.\n\nAs we journeyed, we experimented, both in philosophy and physics.\n\nWe'd kill someone, then pop over to their \"afterlife\" to observe his soul reform.  Destroying a soul on a higher plane simply caused it to reform, or break down into other forms of sentience.\n\nWe dug around for artifacts, followed legends of heroes and villains who never moved on, instead becoming artifacts of great power.  \n\nI began to tinker on Anti-Magic Fields and Disjunction Spells, J took time off to relax and return to our other evil pursuits.  \n\nHe found a relatively untouched material plane safe-guarded by three powerful champions.  It struck him as a little too reminiscent of who he, R, and I were before our fall.\n\nIn a fit of madness, he attacked the champions, but did not let them die.  He crystallized their souls, and hid them deep underground, before rejoining me in our pursuit of reality-ending knowledge.\n\nThat's essentially how I set up the Antagonists.  I let them run rampant in the game world as the first PCs started looking for their first quest, and what followed was the greatest story I could ever hope to be a part of.",

        "text": "[WELCOME BACK to the supereme ridiculousness that is my campaign!](https://redd.it/3j482q) Meet our humble players: [Barrel the halfling rogue, Fishnaut the gillman sorcerer, Tokenhuman the, well, human druid, Pratena the punchy cyclops, Thoth the shabti magus, and Rose the dullahan ranger](http://imgur.com/a/GMt9n). These guys were seriously high-level, decked out with COOL SHIT, and prepared to take on just about anything.\n\n&gt; DM: \"ANYTHING, you say?\"\n\nSeeing as halloween was coming up, I decided to get the party ready for a spookfest. Everyone was called in for a super-serious mission: Hell was coming back. Or, at the very least, something very much like it. Towns were vanishing off the map, numerous adventuring parties had died investigating, and everywhere this shit happened, the only thing left in its wake was death, destruction, and the soulless husks of former citizens. This needed to stop. So the Asshole Patrol called in their most powerful force... The party! Unfortunately, Thoth and Fishnaut could not be reached, but 4/6 isn't bad, right?\n\n**FOUR HOURS LATER**\n\n&gt; ROSE: \"THE FUCKERS PUNCHED A HOLE IN MY SHIP! IT'S GONNA CRAAAAASH!\"\n\n&gt; PRATENA: *incoherent swearing*\n\n&gt; BARREL: \"WHERE IS THE BASTARD? I'LL BLOW HIM OUT OF THE SKY!\"\n\n&gt; TOKENHUMAN: \"GUYS WE ARE SO GOING TO DIE WHERE ARE OUR DEDICATED CASTERS?\"\n\n&gt; PRATENA: *incoherent swearing*\n\n&gt; ROSE: \"YOU'RE A CASTER! MAKE US FLY HIGHER!\"\n\n&gt; TOKENHUMAN: \"WHAT SPELL DO I USE!?\"\n\n&gt; EVERYONE: *incoherent swearing and screaming*\n\n***CRASH***\n\nMiraculously, everyone managed to somehow survive the fall and their airship wasn't COMPLETELY totaled. And there they were, in the ourskirts of the latest town to be devoured by... whatever the hell it was, complete with an ominous black butt dome thingy. It was abundantly clear that they were going to have to enter the evil whatsit, and there would be no turning back. So, they solemnly set off... and made it about three steps before being ambushed by [Betty the Adamantine Golem](http://imgur.com/PHBtEsk), previously seen [being cheesed to hell-and-back by loophole abuse during a multi-man melee](https://redd.it/3d7sil). There was no cheesing this time. It was after THEM, and it had even been equipped with grip legs that prevented suprise breakdancing. Oh, the party was well and truly fucked now. They ran, ran across a massive stone bridge, as the damn thing collapsed behind them under Betty's weight. There really was no going back...\n\nInside, they were confronted with a scene of horror and despair. The town was overrun with Shades and Nightmares- Shadowy creatures that ate souls and spirit creatures that fed on fear, respectively. They had teamed up after their [last outing](https://redd.it/3iflv2) and were now under the command of a powerful, but eccentric, evil overlord that wanted to completely overthrow the living \"flesh bags\" and put spirit creatures in power once and for all. The evil bossman himself even showed up to taunt the party, and throw a few powerful shadowy creatures at them that just so happened to take the forms of things the party feared.\n\nWell, the party got through that okay, then fought off a few waves of crazed villagers that had suicide bombs forced into their mouthes. That was traumatic. Then, just to add insult to injury, Count Von Evilguy whipped out some spells to cripple the party even more- he specifically targeted Pratena's translator amulet, which allowed her to speak without a mouth. That pissed them right the fuck off. The evilguy then sped off, cackling.\n\nThe conclusion was obvious: This fucker had to DIE. But how? First things first, they had to gather info- which meant poking around a town that was intentionally designed to horrify and disgust as much as possible. Posed corpses, fearful illusions, jump scares, other such things. All in all, it was an unsettling and infuriating experience- the party retaliated by dispelling the magic, disposing of the bodies, and doodling butts and crude insults into the walls. Some battles are fought with swords, and some are fought with childish drawings. But finally, they had a lead! After bursting in on a bunch of shadowy minions in a break room, Tokenhuman adoped a disguise and managed to get a bit of info by acting like a clueless idiot. And with that, he was cleverly told to go to the local Evil Understudy to talk about minion labor laws.\n\nThe evil understudy, for his part, was a fairly creepy fuck- a shadowy creature made up of four fused shades that all had a driving intellect and powerful curiosity. So basically he was a nightmarish scientist who, upon meeting the party, expressed genuine interest in cutting them open and seeing what all their organs did. Despite that, Pratena managed to pantomime reasonably-diplomatic stuff and talk the \"vivisecting\" down to \"overthrowing that infantile dipshit of a 'boss'.\" And also some strange small talk, along with the rather traumatic bombshell that Tokenhuman was not, in fact, actually human. So he needed a new nickname, and maybe a therapist. But back to the point- the shadowy scientist was willing to help overthrow his whiny, cackling dumbshit of a boss, but on one condition: the scientist wanted to stress-test his newest experiments... by having the party fight them.\n\nWhich was when Fishnaut was fired out of an enormous cannon, hit the shadowy dome of evil at mach 2, and crashed directly into the building at terminal velocity, braking at the last second with a well-timed Feather Fall. he then proceeded to expound about how he wouldn't stand for the evils of these shadowy fuckers, and he would save this city, and then promptly shot a Prismatic Spray into the scientist's face.\n\nNegotiations broke down after that. Shadowy creatures popped out of the woodwork, charging toward the party, various appendages raised. They were the standard fare of punchy dudes, armored dudes, spitty dudes, blindy dudes, and sneaky dudes that all had little gimmicks to make them challenging. Except that every third abomination was some sort of well-rounded shadowy wolf-thing that breathed hellishly cold ice blasts and gave the party serious trouble. Nevertheless, the party made do with various stabs, shots, flamey stuff, sneak attacks, a bit of fire, and a Mass Hold Person spell. Oh, and for good measure, Fishnaut slapped the scientist with a maxed-out Touch of Idiocy. Which wasn't even necessary, as the scientist hadn't been attacking. Fishnaut was just caught up in the whole \"hero\" rigamarole and decided to piss the scientist off.\n\nOUR HEROES: PARAGONS OF TRUTH, JUSTICE, PUNCHING, CHEESE, BAD TABLE MANNERS\n\nWith combat wrapped up, Fisnaut spontaneously exploded, and a very confused Thoth appaered in his place. That was a bit strange, even for the given situation... but things wound down, and without Fishnaut around to rile things up, the shadowy scientist was a bit more cooperative (if somewhat irked). They re-confirmed that the shadowy scientist dude was not, in fact, really all that evil, just weirdly calculating and self-interested. Futhermore, Count Von Evilguy, the shadowy asshat, had only one mode- infuriating. He was particularly adamant about finishing up a mysterious Project of Vagueness^^TM that was set to be deployed in three days, when it couldn't possibly be ready. Because, see, All Hallows was in three days, and if he couldn't take over the world then, then what was the point? This just solidified the party's mental image of their big evil villain being basically a shadowy two-year-old throwing a whiny tantrum.\n\nBut how to overthrow him? Well, how about starting with the stronghold where he keeps all the terrified villagers that are literally feeding his army of fear? With their plan in mind, they charged out, intent on putting a stop to this business... when Thoth was suddenly overcome with stomach cramps and vomited out a very confused Fishnaut.\n\nTO BE CONTINUED...",
