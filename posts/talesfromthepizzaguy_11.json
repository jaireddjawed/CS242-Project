        "text": "Original story https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/7r88ge/was_backed_into_called_a_liar_and_threatened_to/\n\nInsurance company is still trying to confirm with the other person's insurance company whether or not they even have an active policy. The estimate came in at $1385. I'm not holding my breath on getting my deductible back. So probably what I'm going to have to do is get a new bumper cover, have it painted the factory silver (~$750), then redo all of the custom work myself and hope I don't have to buy too many supplies. So I'll probably end up even on the money but out all of my time and effort. \n\nUpdate: Just got off the phone with my insurance. They were able to confirm that the other party has an active policy and went ahead and waived my deductible, so I'll be getting the full amount of my estimate. So as far as I'm concerned, it's a happy ending!\n\nUpdate again: Some takeaways from all of this. The cops don't make the payouts, the insurance companies do. It was confirmed by my insurance company that it doesn't matter where your car is, if it is parked and someone hits it, they're at fault. They were the only party that was in control of a moving vehicle and could have done anything to avoid the collision at the time. I've been hit far more times than my share in the last 5 years and this has been by far the fastest resolution I've received, usually it stretches out for a couple weeks at least. \n\nIf at all possible, get insurance with a decent company, and get full coverage. That way it doesn't matter if the other person has a shit company that you can't even find a phone number for, your insurance company will pay out and go after the other to get their money back. \n\nIf you're walking away from your car with your hands full and someone hits your car and looks like they're going to drive off. Drop the food and get your phone out to get a picture of the license plate. That would have saved me all the hassle with the cops and proven her a liar right then and there. She was saying that she hadn't been there for hours, but any picture of her car, especially her license plate, would have proven the lie with the timestamp on the picture. \n\nDashcams are critical. I need to pay more attention to when my settings are changed back to default and make sure to have the collision detection on at all times. ",

        "text": "Imagine robots delivering pizza to you.  Imagine a little R2-D2 rolling up, or hovering up to your door with a couple of beef and bacon BBQ pizzas for you to woof down.  It’s not only going to happen it’s in the making and some countries are allowing companies to already do so.  Soon you’ll probably have to unplug you brain stem GPU adapter to answer the door.  \n\nAs of right now I feel like I’m the robot that is about to short circuit because I haven’t had a upgrade in 10 years.  If you deliver pizza as a adult you’re nothing more than a food-bot going around to drop off food to people in exchange for some money that you have to give to the owner while you keep a lil bit.  It’s almost like how cryptocurrency mining works, driving around is kinda like the mining part and solving the problem is sort of like paying the owner, you as a miner get a little spare change for the trouble.  The thing is with being a 30 something year old delivery driver you almost are a robot, running in circles waiting for your hard drive to fry, and when it does the mainframe just gets another one and throws you away.  I’ve been delivering pizza for about 5 years on and off for the same place, the money is enough to get buy but not enough to get ahead, the job is a dream job when you “have” nothing and “need” anything but as far as making it a career, it’s about as low as you can be on the social totem pole.  \n\nPretty soon the option won’t be there for a lot of jobs, from pizza delivery to police and fire fighters all will be autonomous, you wont even be allowed to drive a car once the proof shows autonomous cars are safer for the general public.  I figure it’s probably a few more years before the basic shit jobs go then the medium paying jobs will be next,  no one is going to be safe from technology but at the same time the people who are alive right now have a chance to see the technology threat and have the choice on to either adapt or die, unlike the kids of the future where the opportunity to get ahead of the curve will be less likely because things are in motion already.  \n\nAnyone who is delivering pizza or working a dead end job that’s going to be replaced by robots just remember that things only get better if you try and make them.  I am struggling with the classic mistake of falling in love and having a relationship with a pizza delivery driver co worker and I absolutely fucked the whole thing up completely as Kirk Lazarus once said “you never go full retard” and I did.  I will probably look for another subreddit to vent about that whole mess but my point is that the pizza delivery game is not only the best shitty job it’s the worst storm someone could try and weather.  Not only do you have to understand that you’re a disposable piece to the game, but the company, industry, and society is actively practicing how to not need that piece in the future once determined its a liability. The fact that you work so many hours, co workers are part of your life and unfortunately pizza delivery drivers are the shadiest people you’ll ever meet all the stereotypes are true, so you’re left out of the group if you’re not like the group.  My feelings towards pizza delivery driving in the last few years are compounded with the fact that I am getting older, I don’t get much of a life working weekends and I don’t have much to eat if I don’t, I know that eventually this job is not going to be available because of tech, I got mixed up with a co worker it didn’t work and I still have to see her at work after going full retard and not understanding when something is over its over, and now cryptocurrency is a factor and I am doing like I always do and putting all my eggs in one basket, I am getting on the “bitcoin bandwagon” to learn anything that has anything to do with it and hopefully retain the information and utilize it to the point where it might make it possible to not have to deliver another pepperoni pizza to some asshole who’s going to stiff me, who has no idea or doesn’t care that gratuity is how some people have to survive ever again. \nThank you Reddit for existing",

So I had a few hours Friday,  The boss gave me twenty bucks in change, and Said just make sure to put 20 back when you’re done, and I did when I got sent home two hours early because it wasn’t busy, but I got the gyst of delivering. \n\nToday I came in, was the only driver and it started busy. I made small talk with the cashier who I’d never met, she only works Saturdays. I started orders and everything was going well. One deliver didn’t have a credit card receipt printed, by the time I got there it was too late. The customer made a big deal to prove to me they paid and make sure I got my tip (hoorah faith in humanity). I sorted it out when I got back, and apologized for forgetting to check for the receipt.\n\nLater in the night I got a triple, one credit, two cash. I’d brought forty dollars in smaller bills of my own money for change so I didn’t have to remember to put it in the register or forget and look like an ass. I got done with the order and had all the cash and receipts in my pocket. I began paying for the orders with my wad, I noticed the cashier eying me. She started helping me by reading the total. After I was all done and paid out, I realized I paid three when only two were cash. So I checked my cash wad, and I was about 27 short. So I brought it up she talked her way around it. My brain was fuzzy from math and shit so I brushed it off, maybe I lost the money I’m new after all.\n\nIs this a thing do cashiers pocket money by claiming credit card payments? I have to hand it to her its perfect, I have no way to prove it because the money I gave her was tips that weren’t on paper anywhere.",

        "text": "I delivered pizza for a total of 10 months. First time was  for 7 months in the less bad part if town, second time was for 3 months in the bad part of town. The first seven months actually weren't that bad. It was a more open area, less shit tips, and decent co-workers. This is the store that broke my spirit.\n\nEvery night, I'd be out there for 6-8 hours, burn a whole tank of gas, and get just enough in tips and delivery fees to cover gas. This was the store where we delivered to some less than nice hotels that lined the freeway. At one of these hotels, I had a guy tell me \"he liked little white boys, because they don't fight back as much.\" I ran into a different guy at a different skeevy hotel who got in my face and made it clear he was probably going to go find the person who messed up his order and kill them. That was probably a drug deal gone bad, and I was the messenger.  There was the crazy schitzophrenic lady who forcefully grabbed me by the wrist and tried to drag me inside and take my watch when it was raining \"so the lightning won't see us\". Those are the big ones that stand out, but I dealt with that kind of stress on a nightly basis for seven months. And keep in mind, this was the *good* store.\n\nI finally quit one night when I had a breakdown and shouted in my car until I lost my voice. I wasn't shouting about anything, just... Shouting and making as much noise as I could. I was also driving dangerously fast and stupid. I usually drive quickly, but still with enough margin that I can avoid getting into an accident. That night I was driving like a bat out of hell and knew it. I had broke and I knew it.\n\nI quit, took some time off, got a job bagging groceries, but eventually my hours were cut to less than ten a week and I needed an actual income. So I went back to delivering pizza. I knew what it came with, I knew what it did to me, mentally, emotionally, spiritually, financially. But I went back anyway. If I don't regret that one decision for the next decade, I'll be surprised.\n\nThe first store was in the safest, most affluent part of town. This new store was the exact opposite. This part of town looks like someone took Detroit and tossed it I to the desert. This part of town is where I heard gunshots on an almost weekly basis. This part of town is not good. \n\nI went in telling myself I'd go it for 5000 miles or four months. I made it 5000 miles and I don't know if I'll ever be the same person again. At least, that's what if feels like right now. Thus is the part of town where I thought I might die more than once a week. This is the store that broke me down so much I forgot what it was like to be fine.\n\n There was one delivery in a dead end street at the very end. I was going down the street, and a guy was backing his truck into his driveway, so I stopped, waited, and let him do his thing. As soon as he made it out if the street, I went, but apparently his wife was in the opposite driveway in a van I couldn't see because of bushes. I only saw her as she almost t-boned me, and narrowly avoided it. She started shouting at me, but I was tired and just wanted to go make this delivery and get back to the store. The delivery took a few minutes, and as I started back up the street, the guy had pulled out of his driveway and had blocked me in. He was standing by his truck. I was slowly moving up the road, seeing if he would let me pass. He didn't. He started coming towards me, and shouting, saying \"Hey, get back here you little fucker! You almost hit my wife! *I am going to make you pay, and learn you something on top of it!*\" He turns around, and reaches into his truck, and I'm convinced he's going to pull out a gun and start shooting me. I think I'm dead. Instead, he gets in, puts the trunk I reverse, and *starts chasing me down the dead end in reverse, trying to ram me*. He's leaning out the side, shouting at me, and this part is fuzzy, but I somehow ended up using my speed to get onto a walking path by a ditch at the end of the street. I sat there, in gear, gripping the wheel for dear life, convinced the only way I was getting out of this was finding a way around his truck when he found me, or running him over if he got out. I sat there like this for fifteen minutes convinced it was \"me or him, me or him, *and I'm gonna pick me*\" \n\nI never saw him again, but I speed my out of the at narrow little dead end street at 60mph because I thought he might follow me. That was the beginning of the end for me, or of me. I was already carrying a roll of quarters at the time if I ever needed $10 or to Puch and run. After this, I thought I'd need a knife, and eventually a gun. Every delivery was \"Me or him, me or him, always hit first if you think you have to\". I didn't trust anybody. Walking up to any delivery filled me with this white hot, primal fear. That turned into a general fear that would turn into an almost homicidal rage on a hair trigger. I wasnt myself anymore.\n\nEventually, my car got broken into, and I was done. I was already having flashbacks, but I thought it was just going over the events of the day, or the week.\n\nMy last night delivering pizza, I called in sick, and went on a date with a girl who is now my girlfriend. That was probably the best thing I've done in a long, long time.\n\nAnd that brings us to now.  I realized I had several lasting problems from this job, and I knew it. I was incredibly twitchy. When we went on our first date, there was a flash of lightning, and I just about jumped out of my chair. I didn't used to do that. I would take a mental snapshot of people's faces and clothes as they walked past, in case they did anything.\n\nMy worst days are when I can't stop living in a flashback. The worst one I had was about a month ago. I was taking a shower in the morning, I closed my eyes, and I could see was those reverse lights chasing me. I tried to get it out of my head, but it wouldn't go away. All these things wouldn't get out of my head the whole day, and I could barely see what was in front of me. Instead of eating on my lunch break, I hid in the walk in freezer and cried.\n\nI've never had anything like that happen before or since, but I'm scared that it could. I don't want it to. I want help, but I'm scared of that too.\n\nAfter that first date, my girlfriend and I have been going out for four months. She's found out what I went through, what I felt, what I thought, and it has scared her and made her worried sick. I think sometimes she questions whether or not the guy she sees on the outside is the same as the inside, and I don't blame her. \n\nI love this girl. Words don't do justice to how I feel about her. And I kind of hate myself right now because this is my fault. I made her worried, I made her wonder who I really am, and it's just snowballed in her mind, and I don't know what to do. I'll do everything I'm my power to make her feel better, and to fix the problems that have lingered with me from this job. I want everything to work out and be fine, but there's this nagging voice that says I'm not good for her. Not, \"I'm not good enough*for* her\".\n\nI just want everything to be better.\n\nI want my flashbacks to go away.\n\nI want her anxiety to be better.\n\nI want us to be together and fine.\n\nI wish I'd never gone back to delivering pizza. It has wrecked my life.\n\nI'm not even sure if I want to post this.",

        "text": "“Tits for a tip”  - Todays pizza delivery story is about receiving a tip in the form of tits.  So basically short story involving some big boobs.  It was a busy Friday night in Providence and all the clubs were packed, I think it was “lil rapper” night, I remember seeing one of the club marquees reading like “lil Thotty Fots” or “Lil P. Stains” there was a few clubs with musicians playing this particular night.\nI noticed that there was a large amount of girls waiting in line outside the clubs. So just like every Friday night you deliver to a bunch of drunk college kids, some sober chinese kids, and then you get some of the people that are watching Game of Thrones that of been inside the house the last three days, it’s a mixed crowd on a Friday night but this night something was different.  So as a single male pizza delivery driver I haven’t had to many crazy girl stories, I mean every driver that’s a male hopes that he can get the chance to cut a hole in the pizza, put his dick through and deliver the big sausage pizza and get a hot drunk chick to blow ya, but realistically there never has been in a situation where I could tell if the girl was getting turned on by me delivering garlic sticks, and a white sauce, red pepper and onion pizza and no girl has ever given me their number and said come back after you’re done working. Thats how it works in porn and porn mimics real life situations so whats up, wheres my “fuck the delivery driver” moment? \nSo needless to say I could feel it in the air, and no, that wasn’t the song playing that’s a genuine feeling I had that somethings going to happen this night, I just didn’t know what, when and how.  So now 2:30 a.m. rolls around and we get the after the club rush, calls are coming in and people are drunk and hungry and our place is the only place thats open for delivery!!  \nI take 3 different deliveries to 3 different addresses all of the delivery slips had girls names, not womans names like “Judith”, “Margret”, or “Phyllis” they were more like “Jenny”, “Nikki”, and “Lizzy” which Lizzy could be a lesbian, I mean the odds are greater nowadays especially when a female has a funky letter in their name like a Z or Q.  In that scenario I always expect 1 out of 3 is probably a lesbian.  So I remember one of my co-workers saying one of the delivery’s I have called to order and sounded wasted, but thats a usual Friday night thing because of the college kids learning the ways of alcohol.  \n\nSo anyways now I get to the first stop and call up customer #1 “Nikki” she answers and says shes on her way down, I get the front door and some shaggy looking dude answers the door and signs the receipt which is cool but the fact that he didn’t tip me tells me he’s probably a douche of a boyfriend.  Stop #2 is “Lizzy” and just as anticipated Lizzy is 100% a carpet muncher, she has the spiked out orange hair with face piercings that match, black jeans with rips and tears, and a bowling shirt, no make up and all around the outside of her mouth was shimmering like she missed putting on chap stick, so Lizzy tips me $5 bucks and I keep it moving.  Now I get to stop #3 “Jenny”, I call Jenny and she sounds wasted, I never heard someone slur the word “hello” so badly. She comes down and has a receipt to sign and normally I dont even give the super drunk ones a pen let alone expect them to sign a legible signature with a tip and total, but I said fuck it, lets watch this chick try and figure out how a pen and paper work and see if shes capable of doing some math. Surprisingly she actually did a decent job signing then she says “hey do you take boobs for a tip?”, and I said “uhhhh, what was that” and she replied “can I tip with my tits?” and I thought to 34 year old self “is it ok to say yes”, “Am I contributing to a rape by allowing this young drunk college chick to flash me in exchange for a tip?” and the thought “is this technically prostitution?”  All these thoughts came after I said yeah of course and then “fa lumph” “fa lumph” 2 big ol titties fell out of her brah!!!  She drunkenly lifted her shirt up like how drunk girls do, you know, it looks like a three year old learning how to take a sweater off for the first time, real  goofy looking, you know?  So these balloons are hanging and im obviously stunned and shes like “what do you think?” and I’m all like “yuuum yuuum yuuum” and then she laughs and laughs and runs upstairs with her extra cheese, mushroom, and pepperoni pizza and leaves me with this image in my head of 2 perfectly balanced college boobs in my head.  \nThe scary part of the situation was after I left my phone starts ringing, it was Jenny I thought she was calling to say “hey sexi pizza guy, come over after you get out and bring me your large.....sausage...pizza” but of course my luck wouldn’t be that good and she just drunk dialed me and got my hopes up, I was left holding my phone saying hello, hello, hello, and later that night, I was left holding something else by myself.  So thats my pizza delivery story of the day “Tit for Tips” and the lesson learned is, next time keep the camera accessible and get pictures for later when I’m home in bed. ",

        "text": "I delivered to an apartment complex tonight and parked out front. Parking was full in front of the building with all perpendicular parking. I parked behind 2 cars that were directly in front. As I was walking to the door I heard a crunch, turned around and saw a silver dodge neon pushed up against my car. As I started walking back to my car they pulled away and left the complex. They had been parked across the lane from the building, not one of the cars I was directly behind. I was on the far right side of the lane and they came from my car's left. \n\nI called the police, reported the hit and run and gave them the plate number and description of the vehicle, then I finished the delivery and waited. The sheriff showed up, said the plate number matched the description I gave and that they were looking for them, but that highway patrol had to handle the investigation.\n\nThe car came back about 20 minutes later with 2 sheriff cars right behind it. They blocked her in and started to question her. Of course she said she didn't hit anyone, wasn't there for hours before hand, all the damage on her car was from previous accidents (car was busted to hell). I asked the sheriff if she thought I had pulled her plate number and description from my ass, he said *chuckle \"apparently\". \n\nAfter waiting a while the sheriffs were called away to a priority call but gave me their number and told me that they had all her info and that if she left again then she would be arrested. So we waited. At no time did I talk to the other driver. 40 minutes later the highway patrol shows up. Heard me out, then looked at my car. The front bumper is cracked quite badly. He then looks at her car and comes back to tell me that \"In my professional opinion, that damage is old and you weren't hit tonight and certainly not by her.\" WTF! He wouldn't listen to a thing I had to say. Why would I make it up? Why would I stand around in 26 degree weather losing money to try to frame her? Where did I get her description, plate number etc from if I hadn't seen her? He just said that \"people do funny things sometimes.\" \n\nThen the real bombshell. \"If you want to push this, I'll write you a citation for improper parking. I can write up a report if you want, but if you try to file an insurance claim against her you will be arrested for insurance fraud.\" I managed not to blow up at this threat so that I wouldn't get myself arrested on the spot. I got his name and badge number and the report and had his sergeant call me a little while later. The sergeant only seemed surprised about the fraud threat and told me that I could file with insurance if I wanted to, but that if I pressed further about the FHP officer that they would write me up for where I parked. (private property btw).\n\nBefore anyone assigns blame on the parking vs being backed into. I have been in this exact situation before with my wife. She was backing out of our driveway, our townhome is on a private road. Behind her was a car she just didn't notice parked illegally on the street in front of a fire hydrant. My wife hit the woman's car, FHP said at that time that it wasn't up to them to assign blame, wrote the report and said that if we wanted anything more official than both parties would be cited, her for her parking, my wife for improper backing. The woman filed an insurance claim and was paid out because in the insurance companies eyes my wife was the one in control of the moving vehicle and therefor the only one who could have seen what was about to happen and acted in the moment to prevent it. \n\nEdit: I looked at the report to see who I needed to file the claim with. Surprise, surprise, she has First Acceptance Insurance. A company that offers \"non-standard insurance policies\" for people who can't get regular policies. Pretty sure I've dealt with them before and getting them to pay out is going to be damn near impossible. Soooo...fuck.\n\nEdit 2: I have filed the claim with my insurance and have an appointment for an estimate on Tuesday.\n\nMany have said I should get a dash cam. I have one, a rear camera too. The problem is that the battery keeps going dead at work because the motion sensor gets tripped so much in that busy lot. This results in it going back to factory settings all the time, meaning motion sensor off, mic off, impact sensor off. So when I parked it turned off and didn't catch the accident. \n\nI called the appt complex, no cameras there.\n\nAs much as I would love to fight this as hard as I can, I don't just have me to think about. I have a wife and kids that rely on my income. I can't afford to get tied up in a petty battle with someone who can harass me constantly while I'm out on the road working. If they had cameras I fully intended to hunt down his superiors and force an apology out of him, but without proof I don't feel comfortable risking the fact that we barely keep our heads above water as is. \n\nThank you all for the support, I'll update this again after the estimate, or if anything else happens that's interesting.",

This is a bit of a rant so bear with me. \n\nSo it was 10 degrees out, not the worst weather here in Chicagoland, but still something you don't want to be standing in for too long. It's about 10:45pm and we receive an order for 4 medium pizzas, nothing too bad, going to one of the colleges we deliver to. So we make the pizzas, I hop in my car, and head to the location. As it is procedure to call the college student so they can come out of their dorm, I do so as I parked my vehicle. \n\n\"Hey, this is Jedi from large pizza chain, I'm at the east entrance between this hall and this other hall.\" \n\"Ok cool, be down in a sec\" \n\"Thank you\" \n\nI hang up the phone and walk to the door. I stood there, pizzas in hand as the wind is blowing for 10 minutes, called them twice afterward with no pick up. I was on the verge of leaving when they finally came down in their sleeveless shirts. The dude looks me in the eye as I stand there shivering and says \"wow it's a cold night.\" He then crosses out the tip line and signs his name. \n\n10 minutes, I waited in the cold to only get mileage. I'm not usually one to be upset at a stiff, but this one particularly urked me. I told him where I was even before I was there and they still made me wait in a below freezing climate with a windchill. What a time to be alive.",

Not sure how appropriate for the sub but it's a small story that stuck with me and makes me smile when I remember it.\n\nSo I used to live in a fairly rural town before moving to the city. When I was there I fell into the habit of ordering pizza every Thursday. My regular order totaled to just under $20 so I'd always hand over a 20 + at least 3 singles, sometimes more depending on what cash I had on me. Since it was a small town and it was always Thursday the delivery guys and I got familiar with each other. Anyway, one night Pizza Guy (PG) who was usually a pretty quiet dude did the usual handoff but then gave me a 2 liter of soda and a thing of wings. I'm worried there was a mistake but he goes,\n\nPG: Nope, no mistake, that's for you. Wings are hot but you like hot sauce, right?\n\nMe: Yeah, but I didn't pay?\n\nPG: No worries man. We love coming to your place! You always tip well, the drive's short, and you're chill to everyone, just felt we'd take care of you tonight.\n\nHe walked away as he finished talking so I didn't get to ask anything else, but for the next two-odd years every couple of nights there'd be something extra next to my pizza. I know it was probably a misread ticket or another customer returning a side item, but it was always appreciated, and I made sure to tip at least 20% from then on. Curious about how common that is, do you have a \"good house\" that you give unasked-for bonuses to now and then?",

Our store is a small chained store that is known for staying up much later than other Pizza places, so a lot of our buisness comes late at night. This means that we get people who order at last second too, which like any service place means it can keep people there longer than need be. \n\nWe got a new regular though who saw us as a late night place, and saw our closing time and thought to himself that \"this is a good place to order from 2 mins before closing, every night\". I'm going to name him 'the blob' from here on out. The dude actually defered 4 orders to be made at 1:50pm every night and its infuriating. \n\nThe blob lives about 14 or so minutes away from our store, he lives down a gravely unlit path with a broken mailbox, and refuses to put his lights on as \"it wastes power\". The blob also always orders the same thing every night. One Large Cookie. Nothing else. There is never a tip with this order either. \n\nAnyways, the blob is a disgusting person. He is a 35 year old overweight guy who is wearing a ripped up Pokemon shirt and he smells like burnt taco meat. The thing that made me want to rant about this shitty guy was when I gave him the phone to sign, he had 'cheeto dust fingers', but instead of alerting me about it, he went and licked his hands, wiped them off his dirty as fuck shirt and then signed his stuff. \n\nThe blob doesn't speak a lot, but when he does he is very rude. \"Just give me the phone so I can get out of here\" or \"damn this snow looks bad, guess that explains why it took so long?\". There is rarley a thank you, let alone a smile from the blob. \n\nI dunno man, our cookies are a side project. Its just what you'd find online to make chochlate chip cookies from scratch. Dude pays 6 dollars a run, when he could have all the damn cookies he wants. This is the blob though, and it only exists to consume and to cause suffering. \n\n\nThank you for listening to my ramble. It has been a hard two days, as I got the bad end of the stick. Walked home tonight from an 11 hour shift with 35$ due to being stiffed 5 times out of the 11 orders we got, and the blob helped make that number 5. \n\nTL;DR - Fuck the blob and his dirty ass cheeto hands.",

Upon closer  inspection, there were two singles that’s were dated 1935 silver certificates in really good shape. After googling them later, I found out there were kind of rare because of a misprint. \n\nSold them to a pawn shop for $200 each. \n\nTL;DR - lady gives $100 tip accidentally.

Some of the people are completely ignorant to the point where they’re too stupid to understand I work for tips or they don’t give a fuck, and either way however they look at it I don’t care, it’s gotten to the point where I just want to escape this fucking cycle of having to get up and deliver pizza every day so I could pay my fucking bills.  The phrase “I could become anybody I want to if I believe in myself” goes through my head all day every day and I do not react, I have no action towards anything except for delivering pizza!  My customer service skills are impeccable, but my self service skills are horrible.  I feel so bad for people that are locked up in prison and that can’t escape. I am stuck in the free world and all I have to do is make my life better, I have to build my life and at 34 years of age I have never took in a serious step into building my life, I took a couple swings but I’ve never took it seriously. The visceral feeling of “I can escape” and “I have the opportunity to escape, all I have to do is go for it” Is starting to make me vituperative towards the incorrigible people. I’m not behind bars physically but mentally I feel like I am.  It’s come down to the point where I have so many ideas in my head, some might not be feasible, but most are executable.  I bought a camera, I want to be a photographer, I want to make comedy skits, I want to go do open mic nights at any comedy club, I write down goals and ideas constantly and I know things take time and money, but fighting the resistance is the hardest part when I say to myself just do it.  This is one of the reasons why I started posting on social media outlets like Steemit.com, Twitter, Instagram, Reddit,(Fuck FaceBook) I’ve been trying to upload YouTube and DTube, but all these things are a shot in the dark.  I get into these projects and I do not stay consistent with the creativity.  So now crypto currency is a thing and yes, I want to have “Lambo cocaine slut parties” like everybody but in reality I just want to escape the fact that I got to deliver pizza for a living. I’m grateful that I have a job don’t get it twisted, I wake up everyday thanking “something” that Im fully capable of living life to it’s maximum, but delivering pizzas to shit heads just to pay the bills is becoming my demise. I want to escape, I want to escape so bad that I started to cry out on social media to people I have or will never meet in my life, looking for sympathy with the idea that it’s going to work and someone is going to reach through my computer and hug me, that’s sadder than expecting to win the lottery with no ticket!  I’m smarter than that whether I graduated high school or I have a goddamn PhD it doesn’t matter unless you do something proactive, you pick something that you wanna love and you do it, because life is fucking short and the worst thing is looking back at all the things that you could’ve accomplished, that you would’ve attempted, that could’ve, should’ve, would’ve bullshit will kill you later in life.  Do you’re self a favor get out there and do something that you love find a passion or at the very least find something that you think will get you out of the daily struggle and study it inside and out, use it as a tool to get out from behind the fucking bullshit of waking up and doing a job that makes somebody else rich.  Those of you that think that you have it all sewn up and that you beat the game, realize that it can all go away at anytime, there is no such thing as a guarantee! Things change, nothing remains the same.  I’m going to post a daily blog on Steemit, I’m gonna try to come up with a pizza story every time I work, I’m going to try to reflect on something I have noticed during my shift, most of the time it won’t be this serious, but the idea behind it is to actually document my ability to climb out of this formidable pizza delivery job and climb into that condo/mansion with the balcony thats overlooking water that I dream about when I close my eyes.",

        "text": "Didn't know this sub existed!\nAnyhow, here's what happened:\nOn weekdays we were slow enough that I would take calls, make the pizzas, and do delivery and the manager would be my backup while I was out, and when it was dead we wold just hang out and talk about whatever. It was on a day like this that I got this call. I'll skip the part where I confirm who he is. Our system pops up with a message this guy is a chronic complainer, which is code for \"scams for free pizza\". Great, fml. Order was for delivery.\n\nMe:\"Ok, what would you like to order? \"\n\nC:\"I'd like a large meat lovers pizza with no pork. And no chicken. No pork, no chicken. And extra cheese.\"\n\nMe:\"OK, a large... Sir, a meat lovers pizza comes with... \"\n\nC:\"I KNOW WHAT IT COMES WITH.\"\n\nMe: \"Ok, but..\"\n\nC:\"Meat lovers, NO CHICKEN, NO PORK. EXTRA CHEESE.\"\n\nMe:\"Sir, if ring it up...\"\n\nC:(under breath)\"Jesus Christ.\" (Normal voice) \"Just put in the order for a meat lovers, no CHICKEN , no PORK, EXTRA CHEESE.\"\n\nAt this point I loudly repeat this back into the phone, to make sure my manager hears it. Here is why:\n\nA meat lovers pizza is one of the most expensive ones you can order. Adding toppings to it costs more, typically, because you won't get any special pricing. It's not cost prohibitive, but this comes into play in a minute.\n\nThe toppings on a meat lover are: \n\nChicken (chicken) \n\nHam (pork) \n\nBacon (pork) \n\nPepperoni (pork) \n\nPork sausage (pork) \n\nItalian sausage (pork) \n\nBeef sausage\n\nSo, literally, he is ordering a large beef sausage pizza extra cheese for the price of a large meat lovers, extra cheese. Also, we had a two toppings large deal for half the cost of a meat lovers extra cheese.\n\nMe: \"Will that complete your order?\"\n\nC:\"Yes. How long?\"\n\nMe:\"I can have it to you in twenty minutes.\"\n\nC:*click\"\n\nMe:\"Rude. Did you hear that, boss?\"\n\nManager: \"Yeah. One large sausage, extra cheese. You good?\n\nMe:\"Yup.\"\n\nSo I make the pizza. I cut it when it comes out of the oven. I put it in a box. I drive it out to him. I like doing all the steps myself in these calls especially because customers often play the \"someone there made a mistake\" card.\n\nThe guys gives me the cash (exact change, no tip) and opens the box. He gives me a death glare and says \"WHERE are the rest of MY TOPPINGS ?!\"\n\nMe: \"That's what you ordered, sir. It matches the ticket.\"\n\nC:\"NO IT ISN'T. I ordered a meat lovers!\"\n\nMe:\"Yeah. All the other meats have pork or chicken.\"\n\nC:\"I meant like, no ham or bacon! I'm calling your MANAGER. This is unacceptable.\"\n\nMe:\"You do that, sir. Have a good one.\"\n\nWhen I get back the manager looks at me and said \"That guy is gonna die of a heart attack, that's for damn sure. He ordered another one. Full price. Go look at the ticket.\"\n\nI do. Cheese, beef sausage, Italian sausage, and pepperoni. So I did it all again. Make, bake, cut, box, deliver.\n\nWhen I arrived the guy looked kind of smug, but I couldn't figure out why, since he hadn't scammed us this time. I asked for the payment, and he asked to see the Pizza first. I opened the box, and he went to grab it out of my hands. I barely evaded by jerking backwards, and said \"Money first, dude.\" He tried to grab it again so I dodged and jogged back to the car with the pizza. I saw a neighbor watching and shaking their head while the \"customer\" was yelling all kinds of things like \"I'm going to get you fired\" and \"F*** you\", and so on. I locked the pizza in the car, jogged over to the neighbor, and asked them to do me a small favor...\n\nBy the time I got back, the neighbor had called my boss and described what happened. And he asked me if that's what happened, and I said yes. So he logged an attempted theft from that customer. And that's how we got a system update to not deliver to that customer anymore.\n\nAnd yeah, we ate the pizza.",

If asked I will be honest about it but I know it'll be a huge deterrent. I'd love to find a place where the application on says \"convicted of a felony in last 7 years\" lol. Looking to deliver pizza as a 2nd job as I have done it before (prior to DUI). Maybe somebody who is a hiring manager or has been through this process could give me some insight? Thank you!",

So I asked this girl, that I have worked with for a while, “what is wrong?” Then she says oh nothing this is just my “resting bitch face” and I chuckled so it got me thinking, what is a resting bitch face? Now mind you delivering pizza is not a man’s job nor a woman’s job it’s a job for monkeys To me I would think to have a resting bitch face while delivering pizza has it’s benefits and it has it’s disadvantages and when customers pick up on the resting bitch face when you go to deliver a pizza you have the opportunity to change their whole spirit for that meal because if they see you walking up with a not so happy face it can be contagious so your bitch face that is resting has woke up and transported on over to the next face available now this person is probably looking at his or her black olives, onion, and green pepper cheese pizza with a look of discern, with a look of emptiness “somethings missing” is what the customer is going be thinking. The happy excited feeling of sucking down a black olive, green pepper, and onion cheese pizza somehow is lost the joy, the first bite bliss is gone Why? Because when she gave that customer that pizza somehow she transferred her resting bitch face over to the happy I’m about to eat pizza face and now that customer is going to never look at a green pepper, black olive, and onion pizza the same ever again.

The lady opened the door holding a newborn baby blocking a mid size dog from escaping out the door, all while holding a $20 bill to pay me for the two pepperoni and bacon pizzas.  I have come accross a few incidents where this is happening, the multitasking mother who’s feeding the offspring that are running around rampant with a fat lazy husband who’s sitting on the couch waiting to shove greasy slices of heavenly cheese pizza down is face hole or vice versa.  To me it’s incredible how someone can juggle a baby, hold a german shepherd back and excgange money for pizza. That’s the part that blows my mind, the hand off. I always drop my change at drive thru’s and thats as easy as just putting your hand out to have the lady drop your change in it, and still sometimes you lose a quarter or a dime slips through the fingers.  Now imagine trying to hold a squirming baby while your hungry german shepard is trying to break through the door when you are opening it for a pizza delivery driver who you also have to give $20 dollar bill to in exchange for a couple of bacon pepperoni pizzas?",

        "text": "I work at a pizza place, let’s just call it Pomino’s. I work as an insider and just witnessed this unusual situation that happened to one of my coworkers and had our managers and the police involved.\n\nSo this customer comes in for his carry-out like any usual costumer. Then, once he has his food, he starts talking really loudly and complaining about how one of our drivers is “parked illegally” and he “can’t back out of his spot”. Let’s not forget to mention that this guy has a big ass car and probably needed a lot of room to back out. Our crew denied our driver being parked illegally. A manager even said with a sassy tone, “Last time I checked, we own the property” and kept saying that over and over again even after the situation was over.\n\nSo the guy decides to leave anyway after complaining even though our driver was not parked illegally. He flips us all off as he walks out the door.\n\nOur driver that was so called “parked illegally” just decided to back his car up to not cause any trouble. Our driver backs his car back about 6 feet which gave enough room for the guy to back his big ass vehicle out. Let’s keep in mind that our driver still decided to back out for this guy that flipped us all off. Our driver didn’t want to back up any more than what he had because he wanted to give the driver behind him more room. The guy gets in his car, backs out, then once he got close to our driver’s car he kept backing up but instead slower than normal. Keep in mind that our driver was in his car when this whole thing happened. The guy ends up bumping our driver’s car while our driver was inside it.\n\nMost likely this was done on purpose because: the guy was angry with the driver beforehand, he tried to do a minor bump by driving slowly to avoid huge trouble, and after he bumped the driver, he just left the scene. Everyone inside all agreed that this was done intentionally.\n\nThe guy tries to flee away as fast as possible after that but our driver gets his phone out and records the other guy’s vehicle and tries to get the license plate. I’m unsure of what was recorded with the phone but what I do know is that my GM and the manager that said “last time I checked, we own the property”, went outside to investigate the car damage. They end up calling the police which came over to our store and looked at the damages. I don’t know what happened afterwards with the evidence and the guy that fled the scene.\n\nThe driver was deciding whether to call the police or not because he wondered if he was actually parked illegally. \n\nEveryone in our store agreed that the guy had some anger issues especially since just flipping us all off wasn’t enough. When you really think about it, this guy was creating all this drama for some space he “needed” to back his vehicle out. It was obvious if you saw it that the guy had plenty of space to get out before he hit our driver’s car. I never saw the driver on the road for the rest of that day.\n\nI have never seen any situation like this where a guy has this much anger for a very minor thing.\n\nTL,DR: customer freaks out over one of our drivers being parked “illegally” even though he wasn’t. He gets mad, flips us off, then leaves the store. He then bumps into our driver’s car after our driver gives him space to back out. The guy flees the scene and our managers called the police.\n",

Plus driving his car and with his ID didn’t make me feel any better. I assumed he didn’t have whatever is legal about delivering pizza if that’s even a thing anywhere?\n\nDrove for a while on highway and side roads until somehow and obviously very late I arrived at what was some sort of factory or office building and then it hit me all these people were on break and he sent me out to deliver the entire shifts meal run. \n\nPeople were all chill and kind putting me at ease about my lateness, and then started telling me what order was theirs.  I swear I don’t recall how I got the food orders right maybe they were written on the bags but what in hadn’t been told was what the prices of anything were much less a menu to go by. \n\nSo people are handing me money and I am handing them white paper bags of food and nobody’s complaining about change I just kind of winged it by what they gave me like a big bill I’d break and small money I’d just keep. \n\nGot some strange looks maybe but again everyone was really chill and nobody complained. \n\nSomehow magically I made it back to the shop and he was a bit miffed it took me so long but then he started giving me looks as I pulled more and more crumpled money out of my pockets to put into the register to complete the total bill (which had no breakdown). \n\nObviously whatever was left sure was an insanely large tip and i felt guilt and glee at the total score but more a bit panicked that he wondered how I’d scored so much big money on a run surely he’d made many times himself or more. \n\nSo I did actually return for a second day on the job, and endeavored to make the run right and give people their proper change and then obviously didn’t make insane money but also just didn’t like the weirdness of the whole under the table fly by night shadiness of it all.

        "text": "About two months ago I made a post here talking about how the pizza shop I had GMed for five years got bought by new owners and they offered me my old GM job back (after having left for 8 months). I was going to have to fire like half the staff and clean house because it had been mismanaged in my absence. Expired product, untrained/unmotivated employees, huge sales slump. The place was a mess.\n\nWell I've gotten like 20 PMs and several post comments asking for an update and I've finally found the time to write one.\n\nLong story short the place is a work in progress but it is significantly better than it had been. I tossed all the expired product, got the staff involved with deep cleaning everything. We made a big stink with advertising about the place being under new management/ownership.\n\nI fired two shift managers who didn't like that they were now expected to work during their shifts. Fired two cooks who just don't belong in a fast paced work environment. I got rid of several drivers who had no customer service skills and one who was forging tips on credit cards.\n\nBrought back a few old employees I used to work with. All my great people moved on and have better jobs than they did when they worked for me but some of the people I used to think of as the B-crew came back and they are amazing compared to the people who I inherited from the store take over.\n\nThe employees I didn't fire are actually trained correctly now - or mostly trained. There are still the oddball things that come up. My biggest issue is shift managers. I have the best team of them it was possible to put together given the applicants but I'm hoping to replace two of them the minute someone better applies for the job.\n\nPissed off a lot of my driver's when I started staffing the correct amount of people. My Saturday night guy (well former, he got fired) was livid when he saw I scheduled three drivers that night rather than just him. He was used to taking every single delivery on a Saturday night and couldn't wrap his head around the fact that I wanted to bring in more people so that all the orders didn't take 2 hours or more to reach people's doors.\n\nI made a cleaning checklist and make people initial what they check off so I know who keeps busy when I'm off (and who doesn't know how to clean things correctly). I got our dough management under control and we aren't using over or under proofed dough every day.\n\n\nAll the employees who survived the purges have told me how much better it is to work for me.\n\nEvery day when I go in I feel angry at how slowly people do everything. Right now the average length of employment for everyone is measured in months. Back before I quit most of my employees had worked there for a few years. I'd give my right arm to have just one or two of my good employees back.\n\nOh well. I'll just keep on micro managing the hell out of the people I have until they are living up to my high standards. Only took a few years the first time around.... I'm sure a few of you cringed reading that. I'm laid back and fun to work for. But I expect things done right. \n\nOverall though. I'm mostly happy with being back. The money is good(ish) and I'm expecting a pretty sweet bonus in the not so distant future as the sales start to climb back up.\n\nAMA, tomorrow I'm off and will be taking any questions. ",

Sometimes this job is awesome. \n\nNew Years Eve was such a ridiculously good day for me, for once most people tipped appropriately (extra for holiday/having to work while you party!!). I made $192 freakin dollasssss (not counting hourly). In 7.5 hours, I took 19 deliveries. Here were my tips, biggest to smallest: 40.00, 25.00, 23.00, 12.92, 10.00, 9.00, 7.00, 7.00, 6.77, 5.49, 5.00, 5.00, 5.00, 5.00, 3.00, 3.00, 2.03, 2.00, 2.00. Obligatory screw the two people at the end of the night, an hour to midnight, who both tipped me $2, one who didn't answer the door for quite a while because they were out back partying, and the other forgot to put his apartment number on the ticket then didn't answer his phone for several minutes. But I've definitely learned to shrug off the stiffs, bad tips and no-answers because there will always be that one badass dude eventually who says, it's New Year's Eve isn't it? And pulls two twenties out of his wallet for you, and makes up for so very many stiffs. \n\nAlso, I work for a PH that pays a flat $10 an hour. If anyone is in Utah and wants the info on which store, you can message me. It's a new store, in a very good area, and they are \"testing\" the wage increase, so they may end up raising all the wages in the state. Hopefully!\n\nBout to head to work, hope everyone has a good day! ",

        "text": "So I moved from a place with very warm climate all year round, to the north east, a large city. This has been my first winter ever and it has been horrible. Seeing snow fall and such. This past week and weekend I was home with a very bad case of the flu and pneumonia. Being a single guy living alone, i have all of my meals out. But obviously being home sick I couldn’t go out specially in the freezing temps we got this weekend. I ordered all my meals from restaurants, pho, pizza, salads, etc... mostly pizza, its my favorite. When I order, i do it on my phone app and I always tip 20% or at least 6 bucks minimum the greater of both (I delivered for a restaurant in college and I hated being stiffed so I always give something). And in the special instructions I say “ I am sick, please come up. Concierge is notified and will let you in.” There is a loading zone in front of my building. A large loading zone for trucks that fits 2-3 cars. It says loading zone 30 minutes max. And I always get a call from the delivery guy/girl saying they cant park. My window faces the street and I direct them to the loading area as I can see them from upstairs. When they park they tell me they are not allowed to leave their car unattended and that I must come downstairs and pick up the pizza. So I have had to come down during the freezing temperatures shivering with fever to pick up the pie. Is it really a policy that the larger chains, and most restaurants have to not allow the delivery car out of sight? I mean I am paying for delivery fee and a tip for someone to drive the pizza to my building but doesn’t even get out of their car? Is this normal or I can call bs on the driver and call and complain? I haven’t done so because I don’t want to get anyone in trouble at work but where I come from the driver would almost always go up to my door and hand out the pie with a smile. The pizza chains are all over the city and they are within a .5 mile radius. It’s not like they are driving cross country. I feel like sometimes Im over paying on tip to basically have a guy hand me a pizza through the window of their car and sign a check while I stand in the freezing cold. Am I wrong or crazy? Please delivery guys let me know. Thanks!",

Not that kids older than 12 are more likely to tip, but mostly because parents will send their small child to the door to get out of tipping. Most of the time when a kid answers the door I just expect to get stiffed. \n\n\nBut anyway I had a delivery like this the other night. It had been unusually dead for a Thursday so when I took my third delivery and a kid answered I was braced for a stiff.  \n\n\nThis kid was super excited though. Like yelling, jumping up and down, just generally going crazy. Then his dad comes down the hallway apologizing for his son. Really no apology necessary I’m glad his kid’s so excited to eat pizza. \n\n\nI get paid (and tipped) so I say “Have a great night!” and turn around to head back to my car. As I’m walking back the kid yells out “Bye! I love you!” and I thought I was gonna fall over from laughing. I could hear his parents laughing as I was walking away. \n\n\nDefinitely made my night my slow night 10x better. ",

I asked the AM why we did that if the training video I just got through watching specifically said not to recycle the cheese that doesn't make it on the pizzas. Her response was that the GM wants it that way. My problem is that #1 I think its gross, #2 I have integrity/work ethic and I know the day is coming when they're going to assign me to do the \"picks\" and I can't bring my self to do it. Now I'm wondering if this is common practice at other Dominos locations or if its just my location. If its just my location, does any one have that policy handy?",

        "text": "So it snowed here on Wednesday, quite a lot for our area.  We stayed open as long as we could, I had a delivery to a 'project' area.  When they opened the door, one person inside exclaimed, \"It's raining outside.\"  I corrected them, \"No, it's sleeting and snowing!\"  The matriarch of the family was sitting in the living room, and said, \"Normally I tip you guys, blah blah blah blah blah\"  I kinda tuned out what she was saying because after the first 5 words I knew I wasn't getting a tip.  She was speaking the truth, though, she normally does tip.  My question would be why would you decide not to tip on the DAY IT'S SNOWING?  She paid with credit card, so there's really no excuse, she could have left it on the card.\n\nWe opened for lunch yesterday (Thursday) and person after person called.  The first statement was to the effect 'Thank God You're Open'.  The next question would be 'What are your specials?'  Since most restaurants in town aren't even open, our special for today is WE ARE OPEN.  We closed at 6 because the roads were freezing over again and because no one was tipping.  I took 12 deliveries and made 80 bucks.  Doesn't sound too bad.  The truth is we got paid double mileage, so I got $25 for mileage.  Then a $25 and a $10 tip from two businesses.  So we've accounted for $60 of the $80 with mileage and 2 runs.  4 other tips accounted for the other $20 which mean 1/2 of the deliveries didn't tip at all.  Screw these people.  Normally we make pretty good money in the snow, but normally the students are in town (this storm happened right before they came back from Christmas break, many delayed their return due to the snow.)  So when the manager asked what time I wanted to close, the lack of tips made a big impact.  So to all the people calling and wondering why we're closed, it's because your neighbors are all worthless.",

        "text": "So yesterday, one of the other drivers was having a bad night, he said he's been getting tipped pretty badly even at this bank he went to. \n\nToday, I got the same bank the other driver got so I got to see for myself. The total was exactly $22 for a medium pizza. As soon as it was ready, I drove it immediately to the bank which was at the very limit of our coverage area. The customer also put notes in saying to call him and deliver to 2nd Floor. Today was a cold winter day, -20C, so I'd been getting good tips all day.\n\nAs soon as I got there 12 min before quoted time, I called the guy, went up to the 2nd floor, and gave him the machine, he paid with his Credit card. It was as smooth a delivery as it could go. \n\nI went back to my car and finally read the receipt seeing he only paid $22 exactly. Now, I don't mind being stiffed. I understand if some people are down financially but this guy worked at major bank, wanted the driver to go to the 2nd floor and call him too in the middle of rush hour, in winter. And he did it to other drivers too. So I thought maybe, this guy doesnt know how pizza delivery works. I started to write a text as gently as I could put it, \"hey sorry, dont mean to be rude, but if you could give maybe a dollar or two to the driver, it would help out a lot. we did follow instructions and drove pretty far to get there. Sorry to bother you like this.\"\n\nAfter about an hour he texted back, with a text double the length of mine. The gist of it was, \"i dont mean to be rude either, but soliciting money is blah blah blah rude. You're being paid an hourly wage plus mileage so you're supposed to drive pretty far and follow instructions. Tipping is only when the service is exceptional, just so you know. Dont txt me ever again, I asked for a pizza, not a courtesy lesson.\"\n\nAfter that, I already have this guy pegged. So I just said, \"okay, understood.\"\n\nI brought this up with my supervisor and he knew the guy too, He said he always complained about something. After I told my supervisor what he said about hourly wage and mileage, he said \"Ah I see, I'll take care of it.\" I told him maybe next time this guy orders if ever, just send the driver out with another delivery and do this guy very last so that the driver at least gets something out of that one trip, even if the other order is a couple blocks away. \n \nI guess there are some people who are just like that. Been delivering for only half a year but this was the only time I felt compelled to see what these kind of people truly thought. Im actually glad he replied, gives me a lot of insight into what they're thinking. \n\nWhat do you guys think? Of course Im going to tell every driver about him, but if I see his name on the order screen again, what do you think I should do? Other than of course his order being last and slow.",

I think i was the first manager who manager to get it right with her. Even though she was wrong anyways lol.\n\nSo it was in my first several weeks of working. I had gotten it down pretty good at this point, the manager who trained me was there at the shop with me just about to leave. The call from the cabin lady comes in. I don't take the call but one of the younger guys does and tells my manager Paulette, \"hey it's her\". She was already pretty grizzled from having worked there to long. This at the end of her shift almost pushed her over the edge of fuck this from /eh. So she gives me the whole schpeel. This lady liked to order Hawaiian pizza, that is ham and pineapples. Yes I know, pineapples on pizza; I know. Then every damn time she calls in and \" why is my pizza so soggy? I tell you people about this every time and it is always soggy!\" You would think she would, I don't know order another pizza or maybe go somewhere else? Guess she just loved that red wheat dough or something. Anyways, I make the pizza but before I put any pineapple on it I drain those pineapples, I mean press the juice out even.  They came out slightly golden brown on the pizza I was like hell yeah. The pizza guy delivers, she never called about my pizza it wasn't that big a deal. However,the next week she is back at it again. I was not there but she came in and threw the pizza at the kid working the counter and demanded we make it for her the right way like the last one was. She got banned from our store lol! *(run-ons and horrific grammar)",
