        "text": "\nI (22M) have been with my girlfriend (22F) for about 6 months. I really like her and enjoy the time we spend together, however I find our relationship to be quite restrictive as she expects me to only have sexual relations with her and no one else. I’ve proposed making it an open relationship on various occasions but she shuts down my proposition every time and is very against the idea. While I respect her choice and wouldn’t want to upset her, I also have to listen to my own feelings and ultimately prioritise what I think is best for me. This has left me in a really difficult situation that I’ve been in a few times before. All my past relationships have left me feeling the same way, as any girl I’ve become romantically involved with seems to hate the idea of not being sexually exclusive. While I’ve met a small number of people who are open to the idea, I haven’t been attracted to any of them. Also, I enjoy the deeper emotional connections committed relationships provide, so staying single has never really been my cup of tea either. I’m not at all sure how to proceed with this side of my life, because it feels like any relationship I get into will be unfulfilling and my SO will never see things my way.\n\nTL;DR: None of the people I’ve been attracted to and in relationships with, want an open relationship and I find it too restricting. It feels like I’ll never find someone who I see eye to eye with on this, and will spend my life romantically unfulfilled while looking for them.",

She came out to me as bi a little over a year ago, and ever since I’ve felt like she was a little attracted to me. Last night, we were out at a club (just me, her, and her boyfriend)and she asked if she could kiss me. I said yes because why not and we spent the next half hour making out on and off. Sometimes stopping to dance and include her bf that way. At one point we’re all holding hands, she kisses me again and now I’m just holding hands with her bf while we make out. Like he’s even doing the thumb thing. I start to think to myself, “huh. This feels like a threesome set up”\n\nI notice her bf does not let go of my hand after and she’s just okay with it??? And that he keeps looking at me funny so I pull her over and tell her that I think her boyfriend is trying to kiss me. She looks me dead in my eyes and goes “Do it! :D” and I’m like “do it?????” And she says “DO IT! :D” So I did it. I kiss him for maybe 15-20 seconds and turn around and Sarah has walked away and is talking to someone. I’m like this is awk? Like did she expect us to keep going? Then Sarah starts kissing the girl she was talking to and I was like huh. Maybe she does?? So I danced with her boyfriend and kept kissing him. Turn around again and she is nowhere to be found. I even have to enlist the help of the girl she was kissing to find her. She comes up smiling and goes “I’m going to robs!” (This guy she was seeing before her and her bf became official)\nI’m like ???? I make her bf walk away so we can talk and I’m like “I’m so sorry are you mad? I would never want to do something that made you uncomfortable” \nShe says “no I’m not mad at you, I told you to do that but I’m just mad that [boyfriend] kissed you”\nThen he comes over to talk and I take that as my cue to go. She isn’t answering my texts or calls now though. \n\nOne friend thinks that Sarah owes me an apology for including me in what essentially became a big test. \n\nA different friend thinks that I fucked up and should never kiss a friends boyfriend. I was looking at it as a bunch of consenting adults having a rowdy night. I’m not typically monogamous myself so the dynamic wouldn’t really have been anything new to me, and my friend gave me the okay beforehand. But I still feel awful. \n\nHow should I navigate this?\n\nTL;DR \nMy friend and I were making out, she told me to kiss her boyfriend too so I did. Now she’s not answering my calls. What do I do?",

        "text": "I'm not sure if this is the right place for this but I really need some advice right now, and throwaway beacuse my bf sometimes uses my reddit. TW for SH, suicide, PTSD.\n\nMy boyfriend has a huge amount of truly awful trauma from about a year before we got together, which he is now gradually managing to work through. In the first 6 months or so we were together he was struggling massively with SH and there were multiple occasions where I had to talk him out of suicide. He's diagnosed with PTSD and depression. He had frequent flashbacks of the trauma, and I had to watch him relive it, often with him screaming in pain and shouting in fear. \n\nThe worst times, however, were when he would revert back to a time before the trauma, or in the months that it was occurring, and he didn't remember me at all. He would try to get to places or do things that were relevent at the time and were often dangerous, and when I tried to stop him he would sometimes try to intimidate me (he's 6'8 and I'm 5'6 so that's not difficult for him), back me into corners or threaten me. He was never violent, but it was extremely scary for me.\n\nIt's been about a year since any of this has happened, but today we were talking on a video call about something relating to his trauma, and he mentioned how things used to be compared to now, and I just felt myself getting so overwhelmed with all the feelings I felt then, and I was so scared. I didn't mention anything though, because he was being very vulnerable and I didn't want to take the attention away from him. After the call, I just burst into tears and cried for about an hour, because I just kept seeing it in my head, him screaming and shouting, or backing me into a corner if I didn't let him leave his house, or the look on his face not recognising ne.\n\nI realised that I get scared and emotional whenever we talk about his trauma, and I don't know what to do. I still want to be able to talk about it with him and help him heal, and I can't tell him about this because then he'll stop talking about it and try to deal with it on his own. If anyone has any advice I'd be eternally grateful.\n\nTL;DR I get scared when my boyfriend talks about his trauma because of how his PTSD used to affect him and how it made him act towards me, but I don't want to tell him this in case it makes things worse.",

        "text": "About three months ago, my boyfriend and I were scheduled to go to a local pub for a quiz night that we regularly attended.  The truth is, though, that I really hate this event.  It's full of a bunch of yahoos all trying to spar with one another's superiority complexes, the food and drink are too expensive and my boyfriend often becomes neurotic over these events.  I don't like what he becomes prior to the event and I've been looking for a way to stop going with him altogether.\n\nOn top of that, I didn't really have enough money to pay for drinks, which I need many of to deal with the 2+ hours of trivia.  He usually pays for the food and the first drink and I pay for anything beyond that.  Which is fine, except on that particular week, I had already budgeted money for some clothes I needed to purchase online later that night.  I told him that I couldn't afford to go this week and this look of utter despair and pain crept over his face.  Which then let to confusion and outright anger.  This quiz night means everything to him and It hurt tremendously to see him so bent out of shape over it.\n\nI suggested that he just go with someone else or meet someone there.  Or even go solo for that night.  He simply waved me away, said the events were \"boring if he's alone\" and walked away pouting.  So the night of the quiz came and he opted to stay home.  I really wish he hadn't.  I was going to order the clothes while he was away that night but, since he was home, he kept hovering over me and looking at my laptop screen.  When he saw that I'd purchased a new pair of jeans to supplement my very small wardrobe, he flew into a rage and accused me of lying about not having money for drinks at the pub.  He glared at me with murder in his eyes and stomped off to his room to post something online.  \n\nNow he says these strange and 'creepy' things on the often.  I'll be getting ready for work and he'll say \"be sure not to \\*lie\\* to anyone today...\" and then pretend he didn't say it.  Or \"I have a TRIVIA question for you; what costs more, a couple of drinks or a pair of pants?\"  It's becoming quite irritating and I'm not sure what to do at this point.  He spends most of his free time on online forums these days and alt-tabs whenever I get close to the computer.  There's another trivia night coming up and, he hasn't asked me about it yet, but I'm fearful of how to respond if he asks.  Also, I really want another new pair of pants.\n\ntldr: boyfriend got upset that I didn't want to go to his stupid pub night and now holds it over my head constantly.  Advice?",

Love knowing he was having a good time. Now? I HATE his cackle. To the point where when he does it in public I’m embarrassed. But it’s his laugh, I shouldn’t hate it. \nToday he was talking to me and his mouth was somewhat dry..kinda cotton mouth-y. Again, not really intentional but I was SO bothered I had to stop talking to him. \nHe farts a lot. So what. That’s fine it’s natural and never bothered me. Now? I can’t stand it. I’m in the kitchen and he comes to grab something or do something…I leave. \n\nI find myself so annoyed with every little thing he does and somewhat just repulsed. \nI struggle a lot with figuring out what I want out of the relationship. To end it or to continue. There’s alot I just can’t get over and forget about but he’s all I’ve known for my entire 20s. \n\nIs this my brain subconsciously telling me that I need to move on? Is there a reason for this? Is this what they call the 7 year itch?\n\n\nTl;dr everything my boyfriend does annoys me.",

        "text": "So to preface this, I (M29) met this gal, let’s call Jaguar (F27) when I was dating another girl let’s call Lynx (F22). Lynx moved away from the town that I live in and I couldn’t handle the reality that we were in a long distance relationship (I've tried long distance before and it has only turned into mutual resentment and eventually a failed relationship and no recourse for a friendship) and decided it was best for me to end the relationship with Lynx- we had been in a partnership for 10 months at this point. Jaguar and I had been cultivating a friendship before (2 months) and after the breakup process (3 months) with Lynx and admittedly meeting Jaguar and seeing how we vibed together and wanting to see where that would go was a motivating factor to end things with Lynx.\n\nI felt like Jaguar and I really connected and I felt myself evolving emotionally and communicating in ways that I never thought possible of myself. The transparency and honesty surrounding our communication was unprecedented compared to any other relationship I had ever cultivated. We share so many interests and I felt really comfortable leaning into our companionship. I did make it clear that it would take some time for me to properly move on from my relationship with Lynx, but we had a hard time holding back our sexual drive and soon found ourselves sharing some of the most potent sexual experiences I've ever had.\n\nWe would go to the farmers market together, cook together, read together, and do most things under the sun and moon together. We still had plenty of days apart, but our line of communication was consistent and we checked in with one another at least every other day, if not everyday. As things were heating up, she did mention that she would get extremely attached as we moved forward in our sexual intimacy. I went to South America for a week and she joked that I shouldn't 'get with any Argentinian chicks' and I wasn't even considering the thought of that until she mentioned it. I felt sexually connected with her and because we were having unprotected sex, wasn't planning to have sex with anyone else.\n\nAt some point in our relationship, I was feeling really mushy gushy about her and slid in the word 'partnership' when we were chatting and she was quick to correct me that we were in a 'companionship'. This will be a topic that comes back up in a conversation I have later with Jaguar.\n\nWe always joked about 'what would our first fight be about?' because we had yet to have a proper argument or conversation that led into disagreement. Don't get me wrong, we had plenty of difficult discourse that we navigated together, but it always resulted in mutual understanding and moving forward with clarity because of the conversation. This almost brings us to our 'first fight', which at the time, I didn't even realize was a fight because I didn't feel like I was arguing during the conversation. We went to an ecstatic dance class (where we danced together and separate and had a slow dance together at the end). I felt super connected with her and was happy that we could experience a social event together without puppy dogging each other.\n\nAfter the class, she approached me and told me how she was irritated about my friendship with another girl, let's call Tiger (F29), that I've known for almost 2 years. Tiger and I have a proper platonic friendship and really enjoy spending time together. We like to practice art, go on neighborhood walks, and watch films and undoubtedly get along quite well as we both have at times, a crass sense of humor, and don't judge each other for our sometimes off-color jokes. Sometimes Tiger sleeps over in my bed when it gets late watching movies or hanging out so she doesn't have to drive home and she conveniently has work around the corner from my house the next day. I've had this relationship with Tiger throughout my partnership with Lynx and it has never been an issue.\n\nI had mentioned the context of my relationship with Tiger at one point to Jaguar, and she had mentioned that she found it weird, but didn't really go any deeper than that. This takes us back to the more present conversation with Jaguar, where she had mentioned she was irritated about my relationship with Tiger and that it makes her uncomfortable. I had sensed there were some not-so-mutual-happy feelings between the two, but did not fully grasp it until Jaguar and I talked more about it. Jaguar told me that she felt hurt that I would have another woman in my bed, even if it wasn't sexual and I was a bit surprised and unsurprised at the same time. Because it was never an issue in my relationship with Lynx, I guess it became normalized in my head, but taking a step back from that conditioning, I realized that it could very easily be seen as a hurtful thing. I thanked Jaguar for expressing her feelings to me and told her how I saw it and how we might have different perspectives on the subject, but assured her that I was sorry that I hurt her and that I was willing to compromise and have that not be a part of my friendship with Tiger.\n\nMaybe not the most opportune time to bring it up, but I mentioned how she corrected me recently that we were in a 'companionship' and not a 'partnership' and how she felt about those labels and what they meant. I think I was poking the bear looking back on it, but I couldn't help myself when it seemed like I wasn't doing anything wrong as we were in more of a companionship right now. She said that she saw the trajectory of our relationship to be headed towards a partnership, but we just didn't have that conversation yet and that it would happen in due time. I reminded her that it was probably a good idea to move slow, but that I also agreed that I'd like to have our relationship move in that trajectory. We ended with a kiss, she told me how much she cared about me, and we went our separate ways for the night. She later texted me that night \"Appreciate you and our relationship, Thinking of you\"\n\nAnd that was the last I heard from her, for one week now...\n\nI texted her a few times on Saturday, inviting her to a few functions, asking how she was etc.-- Nothing. I gave her a bit more space on Sunday after trying to call her,..nothing. I told her I was feeling anxious and uneasy on Monday morning and that I hope she was ok and if she could please reach back out in some capacity,... nothing. I went to back to back yoga classes on Monday evening where I saw her for a brief moment, but decided not to approach and have her approach me if she were comfortable.. She left as I went into the studio and did not attend class, effectively avoiding any sort of interaction. I bought her this cool surf art book, wrote her a letter and drew a picture for her, delivering it on Wednesday,..nothing so far.\n\nI realize she has a busy work schedule and maybe just needs time on her own to process what's going on in the relationship, but in turn she has left me out high and dry after we had such an open communication style before. I feel like she just dropped me like a sack of potatoes. I didn't even need a solid reason why she wanted to avoid me or end things, or whatever else ---but just avoiding the whole situation by ghosting me was what really hurt- all while she's been aware of my anxious attachment style. Especially after the night we had our talk and she told me how much she cared for me. None of it adds up in my head, which has lead to feelings of abandonment and betrayal. Ultimately I've tried to refocus it as an opportunity to cultivate a deeper relationship with myself by working through these visceral feelings through acts of self-care. I especially don't harbor any negative feelings surrounding what she did, or didn't do in this case. I just hope we can move on from this at some point and find some understanding and either move on and be friends or use it as an opportunity to reshape our relationship in some other way. I'm still figuring out how I feel day by day, but it definitely has catalyzed a rocky week for me. I'm super grateful to have such a supportive network of friends and family so I've been able to process it a lot quicker than I would have otherwise. But still it has kept me wandering and wondering in my head to a degree that I find a bit unproductive. Pushing through and doing productive things regardless of how I'm feeling has been the most mature way I can handle it, but it's definitely been mixed in with some escapism and ruminating about the course of our relationship.\n\n**Is there any recourse for our relationship or friendship? What could she possibly be feeling right now? Will she reach back out to me? Why is she ignoring me? What do I do to move forward? Am I even asking the right questions?**\n\nThank you so much for reading-- I hope this experience provides some insight and spurs some productive conversations about radio silence/ghosting in situations where everything seems to be going well. If you have any questions for me or want clarification on anything, feel free to reach out in the comments or slide into my DMs. I am a hopeless romantic and have been in a number of relationships and have learned something extremely valuable about the world, myself, and them in each one and am super thankful to have been in a situation where I could love and be loved. I love love and don't love how love can make one hurt so bad sometimes. Peace and love.\n\ntl;dr: Girl that I've been in a relationship with for a few months and has always been communicative about her feelings and needs has been ghosting me for the past week after everything seemed to be going swimmingly between us.",

        "text": "My (21M) boyfriend moved to my city from his hometown to be with me short distance to spend more time together. We were in a long distance relationship from 2020 till the beginning of this year. I’ve (21F) noticed that the more time he’s spent here is that he’s kind of passive when it comes to decisions and doesn’t really take initiative. For example… my mom told him he should probably look for a job here so he doesn’t fall behind on rent and bills. He wasn’t going to do it until my mom told him to apply to specific places that might make him a good fit. He also didn’t look into this one school that had an excellent trucking program (what he really wants to do) and apply to it until I told him to. He comes over for dinner at my place but only because I tell him to. He doesn’t ask to come over and doesn’t really plan anything to hangout with me. In my city there are many free and very cheap things to do and I really want to go to places but I wish he could just initiate a bit more. His excuses are either that his car “has problems” or that or the “I’m from a small town, I don’t know Houston well”. Hear me out in these things… look.. he has plenty of free time to go and research cheap and free places to do here and even understand how everything in Houston works. He does NOT work right now nor is in school. He has internet access. I’m not telling him to know houston like the back of his hand but jeez I’d wish you could know a bit more about here snd what to do esp since he’s been planning on moving here for a good while. Like for example, if imma move to a different country or city imma at least want to know what the customs and ways of life and general info so I don’t get lost or feel out of place. I just don’t like telling him because I feel like I’m parenting him. and hear me out on this… I get that he doesn’t want to use his car cuz it had problems and that’s totally understandable but anywhere that we’ve gone so far we use either my car or my moms car and I pay for the gas. He pays for food but then more than half the time either my mom gives us money for food or she’ll prepare us something to eat before we go out. Idk if this might be a red flag or not but for wanting to have sex at his place he’s good at suggesting that and staying at his place. The other day I told him I’m going to Florida with my mom and her friend and he was like oh nice and just continued to stare at his phone and I told him to come and he looks hesitant because he told me that his friends didn’t like it and seemed like he wasn’t too fond of it. And now I’m kinda upset because his friends have only been there once and I’ve been there many times already and there’s so many neat places and have told him before many times and seems like he believes his friends more :/\n\nTl;dr! is becoming too passive and doesn’t take initiate and it’s starting to irk me",

        "text": "TL;DR  Bf slept with one of his friends in his friend group\n\nBefore we were a thing, during our talking stage, he admitted that he slept with one of his friends after getting drunk. We were very close at the time and I even turned down dates because I was into him even though nothing was official and we weren't exclusive. I took it badly and wanted to stop talking with him when he told me but then he convinced me otherwise, he said that he felt like he cheated but I could see reason behind his actions. I could not expect him to be loyal since we weren't a thing.\n\nI found that he liked on fb (heart reaction)  a very recent photo of hers. Confronted him. And apparently he was lying all the 1.5 year we are together. \n\nAll this time he was telling me that he just slept with her ONCE after getting drunk and had 0 communication with her. My gut said otherwise. And I asked him a million times throughout the time we are together. And he gave me the same story every time. That they slept once and have no communication at all. He even told me that he would prefer not meeting her if I had an issue with it rather than creating problems in our relationship. Which I stupidly believed.\n\nThe true story is, they slept together more than once. Multiple times until he left the country for work. And they still kept contact through dms. And he of course met her from close when he visited his country during holidays.\n\nThis triggered major trust issues. I believe that nothing happened between them since she's now in a relationship.\n\nWould you be okay if your partner was friends with a girl he slept with? Theyre both in the same friend group they had since they were in high school. I cannot ask for him to drop all his friends because of her. Nor would I do that since its not my thing to be controlling and demand stuff.\n\nAny advice on how to handle this maturely?",

        "text": " I recently had a guy (27M) online that started discussing a date with me. He suggested we go out for dinner and then asked me if I expected men to pay. I ghosted him.\n\nThen he found me on another site and said \"Sorry if anything I said rubbed you the wrong way, happy to invite you out for dinner, on me\"! so I said okay I'll be nice and give him a chance.\n\nI picked a restaurant near me since I have no car and he drove up to see me. However when we looked at the menu he started sighing and groaning about the prices and when I questioned him as to whether it was too expensive (nothing was over 30 dollars), he said \"No I want to\". I thought he meant it. He paid but seemed upset.\n\nThen he suggested we meet again, and also talked about taking me to a theme park this weekend. So I decided to give him one more chance. This time, after we ate, he just left the check sitting there and refused to touch it. A long time passed and I had to ask him \"Do You wanna get that?\"\n\nBefore I could finish my sentence he just gave me a blank stare and said \"NO\". This insulted me because I thought he wanted to be a gentleman and keep courting me. He then noticed I was upset and I thought he would realize he was being mean, but instead he got FURIOUS. He said \"cut it out\" or I'll get up and leave\"! viciously. Then he started bragging about all the other women that wanted him.\n\nI wanted to walk out but I was afraid he would run after me and stab me or something. So I was like whatever and I took out my card and handed it to the waitress with his, so I thought we were splitting it. Honestly I was overwhelmed and stressed so just put my card down. Then the waitress came back and said \"Sorry his card got declined, I had to put the dinner on yours\", and this guy was SO excited and happy when he saw the shocked look on my face. He also warned me I'll get bigger if I keep trying to go out with guys for meals. He said I was supposed to pay this time cuz \"EqUalIty\".\n\nI wanted to ask for his half of the meal back but the waitress said the manager wasn't there and I was so embarrassed. This guy then tried to talk me home and put his arms around me and then said he had to pee really badly when we reached my house. I didn't even want him to walk me home, but he tried to get me to go in his car and I said NO so he followed me down the 12 minute walk back to my home.\n\nI have a roommate so I said fine just go to shut him up, then after he got out of the bathroom, he kicked off his shoes, sat down, and started relaxing then looked shocked when I asked him to leave, and asked if we could go outside and talk about it. I said no and my roommate was there so he finally left.\n\nThen I week later he said he's sad I asked him to leave and it was mean of me to ditch him just because he didn't automatically pay for dinner and he wishes we could have kissed a bit and was hoping to meet again. Thoughts? \n\nTLDR: guy locked his card and got angry at me/intimidated me so I would pay in full on second date even though I didn't want to",

        "text": "I met my ex boyfriend January ‘22 waiting tables. I left my number long story short we fell head over heels in love. A month and a half into us dating he said I love you and I genuinely felt the same connection so thought nothing of it- I was happy. I thought he. Was. My. Person. We spent every day attached at the hip, but not in a seemingly unhealthy way. We hung out with each other’s families and friends. The first red flag was him telling me it was bossy of me to ask him to finger me in a certain way. the second being, him telling me the bottoms I wore on the boat and to the beach were grounds to break up. He did grow up Mormon left the church at 18. Not saying I was perfect in the relationship I wouldn’t give him space when he asked when he would be upset- I would try to fix it. He had severe anger issues and would punch himself. You couldn’t tell him he had anger issues though. It was his way or the highway, I remember him apologizing once, in our entire relationship. I probably apologized over 300 times no joke. He threatened to break up with me so many times. The one time I didn’t say, I was unhappy and wanted to talk about it. He goes well if you’re unhappy we should break up. So of course I was like, “Oh no that’s not what I meant”. He was incredibly sensitive- couldn’t take a joke. I wasn’t allowed to have an opinion, but in his eyes, he allowed me to. when we broke up I wrote him a letter, explaining why I didn’t feel heard, and that blew everything up. I constantly walked on eggshells and watched what I said. I was convinced I was anxiety ridden because he would tell me I need to love myself to be able to calm down, looking back I never really suffers from anxiety before him. Outwardly he is this calm, enlightened, and spiritual guy. He skates, surfs, snowboards, rock climbs. My family was shocked by the way things went down- never suspected it. He lived at our house while we were working on building out a shuttle bus to live on. Told me he didn’t owe me the money anymore for the bus ($4500) after we broke up because of emotional damage-he told me he wanted to kill himself because of me. I’m having a really hard time healing, and still feeling incredibly guilty for the hurt I put him through. Told me I will never be loved like he loved me and had he stayed with me he surely would have killed himself. I need answers- what they are I don’t know.\n\nTL;DR: is my ex boyfriend a narcissist?",

She told me that most of them were hookups that didn’t mean anything.  I honestly don’t believe her.

My girlfriend and I got into a huge argument because I found out she was hanging out with her ex behind my back, this is a problem that has come up more than once in our relationship because she claims that this guy is important to her as a friend even though it’s obvious that he wants to get back with her. I was sick of arguing with her about it so I left our apartment and went to my friend’s place. When I got to my friend’s I started getting really drunk because I was very upset about the situation with my girlfriend.\n\nThis next part I literally don’t remember any of because I was blackout drunk by the time that it happened, so I’m going purely off of what was told to me by my friend and my girlfriend. But apparently what happened is that a couple of hours later my girlfriend followed me to my friend’s wanting to try to talk things out more. My friend went into another room so that we could have privacy and left me and my girlfriend in his living room to talk, and then he says that he heard us start shouting after a few minutes and that when he came back out to see what was going on my girlfriend was crying and saying that I hit her, like slapped her across the face.\n\nMy friend is saying that she’s making this up because all he heard was shouting and nothing that sounded like anyone getting hit and she didn’t have any mark on her face, but my girlfriend is saying that I hit her and I was too drunk to remember and my friend just didn’t see it. I can’t imagine myself hitting anyone and especially not my girlfriend but I’ve also never been blackout drunk while I was mad before. I also don’t think that she would lie about something that serious but my friend is convinced that she’s trying to make me forget that the original argument was her fault for hanging out with her ex.\n\nI really don’t know what to think or do, does anyone have any advice for me?\n\ntl;dr: My girlfriend is saying that I hit her and my friend is saying that this didn’t happen, I was too drunk to remember what happened and I’m not sure what the full story is.",

I do not want to be in a relationship right now but I'm ok with going out on dates.\n\nI'm thinking about going out on a date with this guy. He's been asking me a lot of different questions. Like what do I think about sex, do I have any boundaries, telling me his love language is physical touch. And for whatever reason, he felt it was ok to tell me that he's been on dates with women who wanted to sleep with him on the first date. So it's clear that he just wants sex so I don't see why just going out to eat with him for food would be an issue. When he's just trying to use me for sex.

Honestly I know in my head the advice I would probably give another person but bringing myself to it has me feeling it to be an impossibility.\n\nFrom the start we were under a-lot of relationship pressure bc we were involved in a church that was very religious. We moved away and tried to start something new. Unfortunately I spiraled mentally, lost all my friends, and he started to recluse and shut down emotionally. Honestly the situation surrounding us was so charged it created chaos where there shouldn’t have been. \n\nWe get married pretty quickly (again with the pressure) in hindsight I wish we would have waited and slowed ourselves down. We got pregnant on our honeymoon and all of our plans for traveling the world before children completely crumbled. \n\nI ended up gaining a significant amount of weight, got married, had a baby, lost all my friends (bc we weren’t involved in the church anymore) and moved halfway across the country to be with this man all within a span of 1.5 years. Complete and total mind f**kery ensued. \n\nOur relationship quickly turned toxic. He recluses and leans hard into his corn addiction, would lock me out of the office for hours while he jerks off or does whatever he was doing, spends as much time alone as possible, told me he is disgusted with my body and gave me an ultimatum that if I didn’t lose weight and get healthy he would leave me. \n\nI lose 140lbs thinking I’m doing this for us and our future. \n\nHe has rarely opened up and when he does it’s a mixed barrel. He’s told me he would have to lose his mind to ever want to walk away from me. I have a feeling this is bc I’m conventionally pretty. High cheekbones/sharp features and an hourglass figure (now that I’ve lost weight) \n\nHe hates that I cuss, doesn’t like tattoos (I have some and got them before I got with him) shades me for reading romance novels (calls them porn- he’s not wrong but he’s not right)\nDoesn’t like to give me attention, I have had to beg for dates. In the last 6 years I can count on one hand how many we have gone on. I’m literally not exaggerating. I don’t feel valued or loved or appreciated. Wears sound canceling headphones the entire time he is home, stares at his phone all the time, gets really agitated when our family is out and about, so much so that I feel like I have to compensate for his attitude. I am constantly feeling like I have to make myself small for him. \n\nHe in the past (multiple times) has told me he isn’t in love with me and that he has to imagine other women to get off while having sex.\n\nI’m feeling like a crushed rat right now. I try to engage and ask him questions about his day and he literally says he doesn’t want me to ask him questions. I was in the middle of trying to have a conversation with him yesterday and he got up and walked away, when he came back he didn’t try to continue the conversation- instead he went back to YouTube. \n\nRecently (last week) I had an actual stalker situation  happen which caused me to cancel my gym membership. (Keys went missing/a man verbally spoke to me + entered my space and told me he was stalking me) my husband got mad at me and told me I needed to do better. \nHe lectured me about safety then said our children’s safety comes first.  I had to ask him for a hug and had to explain to him why I needed physical comfort. I literally had to say I feel scared and need a hug.\n\nHe said he doesn’t want to lose me and he wants to go to marriage counseling and believes we could have a really good relationship. I’m feeling empty, and exhausted and just ready to move on but don’t have any financial security (SAHM) or physical support bc we live 12 hours away from family.\n\nShould I press on or throw in the towel? \n\n\nTL;DR I’m in an abusive relationship and have no idea how to let go or how to move forward.",

        "text": "Honestly I think in the past I had let slide a lot of things in regards to my boyfriend. I always try to be empathetic to his situation (he has social anxiety) but lately I've been reaching my limit.\n\nSome days ago he asked me for a break, we agreed to be separate for some days but we didnt explicitly broke up. He changed his status to single on social media without telling me tho, so I told him that I'd have appreciated him telling me so I could change mine too, that it was impolite of him to do so. Well, he snapped, told me that I was crossing a line and basically said that how do I dare to talk to him like that, that he is having it bad enough right now.\n\nHonestly I just didnt understand his reaction but I have had enough too. Also, this exact situation happened in the past and when I kindly told him the exact same thing he just ignored me, didnt even reply the message. I then told him that I cant believe that he thought I was crossing a line knowing how comprehensive I had been towards him and his behaviour, and then I enumerated some instances in which he hurted me in the past (ghosting me, ditching me plenty of times when meeting up to see the movies, not saying anything to me in Christmas, New Year's Eve or San Valentine's....) and I never said anything. Mind you this are things we never talked about, I just decided to let them slide because I didnt want to pressure him, but I wasnt going to let him yell at me for something like that while I have been so forgiving with him in the past.\n\nAfter that he told me that I have hurt him inmensely by enumerating those things, and that I evidently didnt love him and left. I feel bad about the whole situation, maybe I shouldnt have said anything? But at the same time what was the alternative, let him walk all over me?\n\nTLDR; My bf snapped at me for telling him that he should have been more mindful about how he treates me, after which I reminded him of some instances in which he indeed hurt me in the past. He hated that and left me.",

I asked her to try to put it in its place next time. I always put my keys in one spot at the entrance, exactly to avoid looking for them, her constanly misplacing it messes with my system.\n\nAnd her answer to this frankly angered me quite a bit. She told me, I shouldn't have taken her keys in the first place, instead should have looked for mine. And actually I should make it a rule not to take her keys, because like this if **I** (refering to me) **misplace** mine, or **I lose** them, we won't know. For the record I've never actually misplaced my keys, ever, I put them in their place, I find them always in their spot - easy. I've a better rule, how about you don't take my keys, or if you do at least put back where you found them.\n\nOh, and while I was explaining absurdity of what she told me, she managed to throw in an usual insult that I don't listen to anyone, that it's me who doesn't undesrtand it.\n\nI remember that one time she took our only car key with her in the bag (she forgot to take it out when home), and I was late on my tennis training session looking for it, and had to take taxi.\n\nThis probably sounds extremly petty, but I don't care about the damn keys - what angered me was the abnoxious response.\n\nIt's sad, I am turning 36 and to have to fight about this bullshit. Now I am sitting in the dark study and sulking alone. I've seen those old couples who fight about everything, and often smirked imagining it would never be us. But hey, I cannot wait to see what else awaits me down the line.\n\nTL;DR! - we fight about keys.",

        "text": "TL;DR - can't control my frustration and I hate feeling hurt when I know she's not at fault and has no control over certain circumstances. I want to learn how to be a more understanding boyfriend. \n\nWe've been dating for 2 months but have known each other for around 7 to 8 months. She's amazing. She puts in a lot of effort into our relationship but the problem here is, because I haven't worked on my trauma, I get extremely insecure over the smallest of things and overthink a lot and end up getting really annoyed, frustrated and angry at certain things. We are long distance right now, but we do try to meet at least once a week because she's close. But I try to spend a lot of time with her and we both love staying on call together literally 24/7 but there's always something or the other that happens and she needs to cut the call. It's either she has chores to do because her mother called or her friend snatches her phone and doesn't give it back and such. And it's starting to get really frustrating because at this point my phone vibrates for longer compared to the amount of time we get to speak. Although I understand it's not her fault, I can't help but feel like this. I'm also extremely insecure about her guy best friend because she used to like him before but never told him, so there's unrequited love there. Although she tells me that they've drifted apart, they still exchange at least 5 to 10 messages per day on snap and WhatsApp. And moreover, we were just watching a show together on call while I was streaming and she did tell me that she isn't tired and won't pass out and such but she did, and it kinda hurts a lil.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is, why can't I be the understanding boyfriend? Why can't I just not have those feelings and be able to treat her with love and kindness when these situations arise because I know she's doing the best she can. Why can't I be normal? I mean, I know why, like my ex did leave me for my own best friend and she never gave me proper attention or cared about my feelings. And my current girlfriend knows about that but it's killing me every day to have these feelings and not being able to give her that care. \"couples should grow together because no one is perfect\" or \"I don't wanna bleed on her nor see her sad or carry my burdens. I want to be her rock. I wanna heal myself\" and I know a lot of people would say the latter is actually right if not reasonable, although I am quite tired and lost. Any kind of advice will be highly appreciated.",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo to preface this, I met this gal, let’s call Jaguar when I was dating another girl let’s call Lynx. Lynx moved away from the town that I live in and I couldn’t handle the reality that we were in a long distance relationship (I've tried long distance before and it has only turned into mutual resentment and eventually a failed relationship and no recourse for a friendship) and decided it was best for me to end the relationship with Lynx. Jaguar and I had been cultivating a friendship before and after the breakup process with Lynx and admittedly meeting Jaguar and seeing how we vibed together and wanting to see where that would go was a motivating factor to end things with Lynx. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI felt like Jaguar and I really connected and I felt myself evolving emotionally and communicating in ways that I never thought possible of myself. The transparency and honesty surrounding our communication was unprecedented compared to any other relationship I had ever cultivated. We share so many interests and I felt really comfortable leaning into our companionship.  I did make it clear that it would take some time for me to properly move on from my relationship with Lynx, but we had a hard time holding back our sexual drive and soon found ourselves sharing some of the most potent sexual experiences I've ever had.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe would go to the farmers market together, cook together, read together, and do most things under the sun and moon together.  We still had plenty of days apart, but our line of communication was consistent and we checked in with one another at least every other day, if not everyday.  As things were heating up, she did mention that she would get extremely attached as we moved forward in our sexual intimacy.  I went to South America for a week and she joked that I shouldn't 'get with any Argentinian chicks' and I wasn't even considering the thought of that until she mentioned it.  I felt sexually connected with her and because we were having unprotected sex, wasn't planning to have sex with anyone else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt some point in our relationship, I was feeling really mushy gushy about her and slid in the word 'partnership' when we were chatting and she was quick to correct me that we were in a 'companionship'.  This will be a topic that comes back up in a conversation I have later with Jaguar.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe always joked about 'what would our first fight be about?' because we had yet to have a proper argument or conversation that led into disagreement. Don't get me wrong, we had plenty of difficult discourse that we navigated together, but it always resulted in mutual understanding and moving forward with clarity because of the conversation.  This almost brings us to our 'first fight', which at the time, I didn't even realize was a fight because I didn't feel like I was arguing during the conversation.  We went to an ecstatic dance class (where we danced together and separate and had a slow dance together at the end).  I felt super connected with her and was happy that we could experience a social event together without puppy dogging each other.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter the class, she approached me and told me how she was irritated about my friendship with another girl, let's call Tiger, that I've known for almost 2 years.  Tiger and I have a proper platonic friendship and really enjoy spending time together. We like to practice art, go on neighborhood walks, and watch films and undoubtedly get along quite well as we both have at times, a crass sense of humor, and don't judge each other for our sometimes off-color jokes.  Sometimes Tiger sleeps over in my bed when it gets late watching movies or hanging out so she doesn't have to drive home and she conveniently has work around the corner from my house the next day.  I've had this relationship with Tiger throughout my partnership with Lynx and it has never been an issue.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had mentioned the context of my relationship with Tiger at one point to Jaguar, and she had mentioned that she found it weird, but didn't really go any deeper than that.  This takes us back to the more present conversation with Jaguar, where she had mentioned she was irritated about my relationship with Tiger and that it makes her uncomfortable.  I had sensed there were some not-so-mutual-happy feelings between the two, but did not fully grasp it until Jaguar and I talked more about it.  Jaguar told me that she felt hurt that I would have another woman in my bed, even if it wasn't sexual and I was a bit surprised and unsurprised at the same time.  Because it was never an issue in my relationship with Lynx, I guess it became normalized in my head, but taking a step back from that conditioning, I realized that it could very easily be seen as a hurtful thing.  I thanked Jaguar for expressing her feelings to me and told her how I saw it and how we might have different perspectives on the subject, but assured her that I was sorry that I hurt her and that I was willing to compromise and have that not be a part of my friendship with Tiger.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe not the most opportune time to bring it up, but I mentioned how she corrected me recently that we were in a 'companionship' and not a 'partnership' and how she felt about those labels and what they meant.  I think I was poking the bear looking back on it, but I couldn't help myself when it seemed like I wasn't doing anything wrong as we were in more of a companionship right now.  She said that she saw the trajectory of our relationship to be headed towards a partnership, but we just didn't have that conversation yet and that it would happen in due time.  I reminded her that it was probably a good idea to move slow, but that I also agreed that I'd like to have our relationship move in that trajectory.  We ended with a kiss, she told me how much she cared about me, and we went our separate ways for the night.  She later texted me that night \"Appreciate you and our relationship, Thinking of you\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd that was the last I heard from her, for one week now...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI texted her a few times on Saturday, inviting her to a few functions, asking how she was etc.-- Nothing.  I gave her a bit more space on Sunday after trying to call her,..nothing.  I told her I was feeling anxious and uneasy on Monday morning and that I hope she was ok and if she could please reach back out in some capacity,... nothing.  I went to back to back yoga classes on Monday evening where I saw her for a brief moment, but decided not to approach and have her approach me if she were comfortable.. She left as I went into the studio and did not attend class, effectively avoiding any sort of  interaction.  I bought her this cool surf art book, wrote her a letter and drew a picture for her, delivering it on Wednesday,..nothing so far.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI realize she has a busy work schedule and maybe just needs time on her own to process what's going on in the relationship, but in turn she has left me out high and dry after we had such an open communication style before.  I feel like she just dropped me like a sack of potatoes.  I didn't even need a solid reason why she wanted to avoid me or end things, or whatever else ---but just avoiding the whole situation by ghosting me was what really hurt- all while she's been aware of my anxious attachment style.  Especially after the night we had our talk and she told me how much she cared for me.  None of it adds up in my head, which has lead to feelings of abandonment and betrayal.  Ultimately I've tried to refocus it as an opportunity to cultivate a deeper relationship with myself by working through these visceral feelings through acts of self-care.  I especially don't harbor any negative feelings surrounding what she did, or didn't do in this case.  I just hope we can move on from this at some point and find some understanding and either move on and be friends or use it as an opportunity to reshape our relationship in some other way.  I'm still figuring out how I feel day by day, but it definitely has catalyzed a rocky week for me.  I'm super grateful to have such a supportive network of friends and family so I've been able to process it a lot quicker than I would have otherwise.  But still it has kept me wandering and wondering in my head to a degree that I find a bit unproductive.  Pushing through and doing productive things regardless of how I'm feeling has been the most mature way I can handle it, but it's definitely been mixed in with some escapism and ruminating about the course of our relationship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow would you feel given these circumstances?  Is there any recourse for our relationship or friendship?  What could she possibly be feeling right now?  Will she reach back out to me? Why is she ignoring me? What do I do to move forward?  Am I even asking the right questions?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you so much for reading-- I hope this experience provides some insight and spurs some productive conversations about radio silence/ghosting in situations where everything seems to be going well. If you have any questions for me or want clarification on anything, feel free to reach out in the comments or slide into my DMs.  I am a hopeless romantic and have been in a number of relationships and have learned something extremely valuable about the world, myself, and them in each one and am super thankful to have been in a situation where I could love and be loved. I love love and don't love how love can make one hurt so bad sometimes.  Peace and love.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: Girl that I've been in a relationship with for a few months and has always been communicative about her feelings and needs has been ghosting me for the past week after everything seemed to be going swimmingly between us.",

        "text": "My gf (23f) used to hangout with a older co worker that happens to be her supervisor a couple months before we met. They would mainly just go get drinks together, etc. However when we started seeing each other and I would come around this woman would get pissy and I was told she didn’t want me there when they where hanging out because we where too “lovey”. The. One night the 3 of us where drinking at a bar and she had a breakdown after seeing us holding hands and stuff saying we where “too much”. After this I told my girl I didn’t like her hanging out with this woman bc she wasn’t right. So my woman started to distance herself, this woman still would ask to go do things but would get turned down. Fast forward to last weekend she offered my gf $200 to help clean her apartment up and assemble some furniture, she agreed bc of the extra cash, but she lives 25 mins away and said for her to just leave her car here and she’d pick her up. I had to drive to her apartment to get my gf that night. Then she asked her to come Wednesday after work and help/hangout so she leaves her car here again and then tells me that this woman changed the schedule at worked and gave her Thursday off to go 4 hours out of town to buy a car and that she did that without her knowing. I thought that was odd considering apparently she just did it and then roped her into a road trip. So she was supposed to come home last night late but I get a text saying that she was told by her supervisor (other woman) that is she was late to work she would get wrote up but if she stayed the night she mark it as a vacation day and she’d drop her off today. So she stays another night and doesn’t go to work today. And this morning I got a text saying that she asked if she could help with her kids birthday party and do her hair, my gf said she didn’t want to stay for the party itself but could help. I have a weird feeling this is going to turn into another night spent or something and I’m pissed off already. I don’t like this supervisor I think she’s manipulating. But also my gf can say she needs to go if she wanted. This woman is pushy and is desperate and I don’t want her around. \n\nTL;DR My (23f) gf is spending too much time with a co worker and it’s odd.",

It feels wrong as I don’t have anything specific and toxic to bring up if I were to have a conversation of why I no longer want to spend time with her. \n\nWe now live in different countries and go months without speaking which is fine, however I seem to reach out a bunch and she leaves me on read. And then suddenly pops back in after months asking to hangout when she’s in my area. This has been happening for the last few years. I brought it up and she mentioned it is because she’s been going through a lot (which she has) so I’m trying to understand and not add to her mountain of stress but it triggers my issues with abandonment. \n\nThe last time we hung out I realized I just don’t want to hang out a lot anymore. But how do I go about this without hurting her?\n\n\nTl;dr - I don’t want to be friends anymore but she has done nothing objectively wrong.",

        "text": "So my (soon to be ex) wife, this girl, and I all work at the same place but not all in the same area. We've worked together for about 3 years but she's started talking to me more in the past year, specifically since I've become a dad.\n\nShe's quiet, shy, and reserved but she's become increasingly chatty with me and I find these days she really tries to keep the conversation flowing. She asks me a lot more personal stuff and volunteers it often as well. I thought maybe this was because she knew my wife, but apparently they aren't really friends (don't dislike each other just don't interact much). This girl has even forgotten my wife's name a couple times when asking about her.\n\nWe had a particularly good conversation the other day, and I feel like her body language was good. It may not be interest, but I feel like she's at least comfortable with me. She was making a lot of eye contact with me, much more than she used to. She was sitting across from me and had her legs crossed, but her uncrossed leg was pointing towards me, and her crossed leg was making her pants noticeably tighter. She also had her head tilted to the side (resting on the wall) kind of exposing her neck, but she wears her hair back so it's hard to say whether that was purposeful or just comfortable for her. We would occasionally break eye contact and then regain it, not sure if that's good or bad? She would look away when telling me something that seemed like it was painful. For example, when she told me her mom passed away she'd look down for a few seconds. But when talking about happy things (like our kids) she'd usually maintain prolonged eye contact. If she did look away she'd look down for a couple seconds and then look back. My friend also said to see if her voice is higher pitched when speaking to me, and I would say occasionally yes imo.\n\nWe actually had a really in depth talk about personal stuff such as where we grew up, our family members, parents who have passed away, our kids (she's a single mom), etc. She also started asking about where my family live now, what nickname I have for my son, etc. She's also started getting more... vulnerable I guess, talking about cost of living pressure and stuff like that. Not super in depth, just passing comments but still ones revealing personal information. She also started telling me how she feels about our town, frustrations she's had with finding things to do (particularly with her kid), etc.\n\nMy friend happened to be there for the conversation and afterwards he said \"She sure likes you.\" I asked what he meant and he said she never talks to him that much, only pleasantries. Upon talking to some of the other guys I work with, they've all basically said the same thing. She did briefly interact with this guy while I was there, but only when I brought him into the conversation and she didn't seem like she knew what to say to him.\n\nAnother thing, she's been making more jokes with me and laughing my (very lame) jokes. The other day I could tell she was looking for someone and I said \"Hey you look lost, you ok?\" Our eyes met, she had a really big smile, and then looked down. She giggled a bit and said \"Oh yeah, I'll find myself in a minute.\" or something kinda dorky like that.\n\nShe could just be more comfortable with me, but I feel like she's taken a particular interest in me the last 6 to 12 months as I said. About 7 months or so back, we had a conversation about my son and ever since then she's much more talkative to me. Not sure if they're related. She's said once she's good at judging people's vibes, so maybe she just thinks I'm a good dad and is more comfortable with me now idk.\n\nAgain, not going to get mixed up with this, at least for the foreseeable future (until wife and I are officially split and also my wife is changing jobs eventually) but it would be good to know at least for future reference because I kinda suck at taking hints, but also don't want to make something out of nothing.\n\nI guess part of me thinks she knows I'm married and she knows my wife directly, so I think why would she be interested/showing interest. She doesn't know my wife and I are splitting yet. It's really hard to say because she isn't as expressive as most women I know.\n\nTL;DR - Not sure if my coworker is reservedly flirting with me because I'm (technically) still married, or whether she's just comfortable with me.",

I knew she has some chronic illnesses that interfered greatly with her life and she is really depressed about it. \n\nOne day after I admitted I checked her facebook page (which has some info about her illness and other stuff), she told me it’s ok and she expected as much, but asked me to not check her tiktok. I promised her not to and she said it’s not such a big deal, but it’s very depressing.\n\nWell, about 2 weeks later, curiosity got better out of me and I looked up her tiktok and it is indeed very sad and painful (making me also realise how little I actually know her). \n\nAnyway, now I feel extremely guilty about it and I don’t know what I should do. Part of me wants to keep it a secret and not tell her, but I would feel like I’m lying to her, and I really want to have an honest relationship with her. That’s why I want to tell her even if she loses all trust in me and would even want to break up, however I don’t want her to feel even more hurt than she already is. I know I messed up and I’m a jerk, but I’m wondering what you guys think I should do.\n\nTl;dr: I betrayed my girlfriend’s trust to not check her tiktok and now I’m at a loss of what to do",

        "text": "Hey all,\n\nI need some affirmation that my recent breakup was warranted - we fought A LOT. Keep in mind there are many more subtle examples where we fought; it was about twice a week we would get into a big fight. I’m embarrassed for what my neighbor heard\n\nExamples:\n\nI was traveling from week 2-6 of our relationship so we did not fight over the phone of our first anniversary lol\n\nOur second anniversary, we fought for hours through our dinner reservation so we went to ihop hours after we were supposed to eat.\n\nShe was looking at apartments; looked at 2 bedroom units for weeks only to end up wanting to live alone. She carelessly missed the cutoff date to get an apartment so she put her stuff into storage and live with me for a month. She looked for 3 days into the month and gave up/haphazardly committed to a shitty basement unit (#pests) for 30% more than market rate. She didn't run it by me that she was just diving into commiting to such a bad decision which caused a massive fight.\n\nAfter that we were supposed to get dinner and go to a Super Bowl party together. She decided to go to her friends Super Bowl party  first - I told her how upset I was that she couldn’t stick to plans so we fought in my apartment for an hour before showing up right before half time to my Super Bowl party. She told me she loved me for the first time while fighting before leaving for the Super Bowl…not how I imagined us saying we love each other for the first time. This was a bad sign\n\nOur third Anniversary, we didn’t even acknowledge it as we fought leading up to dinner and the night was awful. Never talked about our third month anniversary lol\n\nBefore we officially broke up: that night, she stormed out of my apartment saying “we’re through, I’m over this”, slamming the door, only to call me apologizing from my lobby. She came back up crying then left, doing the same thing. She called me again and came back up only to leave a third time!!! This was the last night I saw her\n\nShe came to pick up something of hers that got delivered to me. Showed up unannounced 90 minutes after she said she was going to show and I was in the shower. She waited for a total of 5 minutes outside my building and said this was the meanest thing anyone’s ever done to her. She was crying outside my building and texting my hysterical stuff\n\n\nShe has now blocked me on instagram.\n\n\nWe dated for 3.5 months and this is a glimpse of some of our bigger fights. She broke up with me technically but it was obvious it wasn't working. We fought at least weekly and the fights were getting crueler and less reasonable. It seemed like she wanted to make me feel guilty or bad in a lot of our fights; we just could never get on the same page.\n\nCan y'all affirm that I got out of something that was just not going to last? Lots of emotions tied up here and this is the second major/in love relationship that I've been in. I know we both still feel awful and I'm having trouble grasping that I need to move on\n\n\n\nThank you!\n\n\n\ntl;dr: dated a girl for 3.5 months, very much in love with each other but had nasty fights 1-2x/week and it just ended with a major screaming fight. Having trouble getting over it",
