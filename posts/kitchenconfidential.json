It was an employee first restaurant and they really tried to care about their employees. It was a good gig with a reasonable amount of bullshit that\u2019s to be expected of a kitchen, but overall a good place to work. I loved my coworkers, and management was even pretty good. The servers were cool and it really was like a family restaurant without even advertising it like that. But I fucked up one night at close leaving the sink we thawed meat in on hot instead of cold and they had to throw out 19 pounds of waygu beef. A pricy fuck up, but it would be my last as they said they have to let me go after that. I had some other minor fuck ups before that, and management at my branch wanted to overlook it, but orders came from higher up to let me go and that\u2019s all she wrote. It was a good time and Imma miss it, but it\u2019s time for me to move on. It may be a bit before I work in a kitchen again because of some circumstance and situation, but imma always be a kitchen rat at heart. Love y\u2019all and hope your closes go smooth and your opens are without a hitch <3\n\n\nEdit: ok guys I made this post in less than 5 minutes while I was making dinner last night and didn\u2019t think it\u2019d blow up this much so a few things to add \n\nI worked in a small bar with an even smaller kitchen. \nOur walk in was where we kept most of the beer so there wasn\u2019t much room for food as it is, but we did have reach in fridges in the kitchen where we kept a lot of a our food. We only had the one sink in the kitchen, so we made do and we very much would not do dishes while it was being used to prep food. We also only did burgers and fries, so there wasn\u2019t very much we needed to use the sink for food anyways. The most it would be used for food was for straining pasta out for the Mac and cheese we put on a burger.(weird burger I know, but don\u2019t knock it) As I mentioned in a comment, we are open pretty late, and the last thing we do at night at 2:30 at the earliest, 3 or 3:30am on average is put our frozen meat in the cleaned out dish sink under cold running tap water to thaw. Prep comes in at 7am. We have no signs or evidence of rodents or other pests that would tamper with the meat, and on top of that, we only do it in the winter time when it it\u2019s consistently under 50\u00b0F outside. Once it starts getting warmer, prep thaws meat when they come in. The quality of the beef is actually a little higher in the winter time. During the summer time, even though the meat is more closely watched and monitored, some of the fats binding the beef together will sometimes start to melt which makes the burger patties more prone to falling apart on the grill and just generally less pleasant to work with. Also if a tube does get punctured or ruptured, which is surprisingly rare, we toss it. The reason we thaw meat last thing at night is because we have a par amount of meat we need prepped for each day based of traffic. We don\u2019t know how much meat we need for the next day until the end of the current day.  I think that wraps most of it up. I\u2019m going to try to respond to comments through the day to answer any more questions.\n\nEdit 2:\nI just had a more knowledgeable culinary friend break down exactly why this is bad and y\u2019all are right. I didn\u2019t realize how fucked this was but god damn. I don\u2019t know how we haven\u2019t been shut down after doing that for years now. Thanks for making me feel better about being fired from that whack ass kitchen. It was a fun place, but maybe now I can move on to somewhere with better food handling procedures. Thanks y\u2019all. Sorry I\u2019ve been dumb in some of the comments.","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1678598816.0},{"title":"After 6 years of working in this field, I ask my fellow cooks, chefs, dishwashers and all BOH staff.","author":"thefoxygrandma","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/KitchenConfidential\/comments\/11pxaip\/after_6_years_of_working_in_this_field_i_ask_my\/","text":"How do yall cope and manage to never have a weekend to enjoy by going out?\n\nAnd how much has it affected your social life and friendships\/relationships?\n\nI feel like I do this job because I love to cook and I want to become a great chef in my own eyes, but man do I wish I could experience a real weekend that's not a vacation where I have to cram everything in one week.","upvote_ratio":0.76,"created_utc":1678673823.0},{"title":"What noises have come to haunt you?","author":"mrduncansir42","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/KitchenConfidential\/comments\/11ptfoy\/what_noises_have_come_to_haunt_you\/","text":"What noises do you hate in your kitchen?

It's still under construction, but they've installed the hood\/hot line, and plumbed the dishpit exactly next to each other. Like you have a fryer, flat top, 4 burner stove under the hood which goes STRAIGHT into the edge of the dish sink. I'm talking about sink sprayer flying into saut\u00e9 pans close. They haven't actually purchased or installed the sink yet, but with the plumbing where it is and the amount of room in the kitchen, there's no way to avoid this layout.\n\nThey want nothing but the smallest size low-boy in front of the hot line, the only food storage fridge is a huge triple door upright, and I cannot even see where there will be room for it if you're creating a functional line. They have it butted up against the edge of the hood vent...blocking all that space which should be the hot line... : |\"So the cook can go in the fridge while they're cooking!!\" They've opted to put breakers, hvac, and security systems on every other wall so nothing can block it, there's no room for metro shelves or appliances...it's a mess. Just the idea of making this into a functional food service area is giving me anxiety, yet that's what they're hiring me for. I am not even sure that the department of health would approve this arrangement, or that the fridge will function properly right next to a 500 degree flat top, let alone the headache it would be to work in here. I want to tell them there's nothing I can do to change where they've installed permanent fixtures, that they should have spoken to chefs or ergonomists before the contractors came in. Maybe I'm just not seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, but this is looking really bad. They only need finger food, so I guess a full entire kitchen isn't necessary, but the shit they've got going right now isn't even a place where I'd be comfortable making french fries.\n\nAs is typical, these guys have zero industry experience and are just telling me \"WE ARE FOODIES, WE LOVE GUY FIERI. WE PLAY CHOPPED AT HOME!\" And I'm like fuck....that's not...sigh ok. I can already see them coming to me with ridiculous food network gimmicky ideas they saw on \"triple D\" and want me to work them into the menu. I want to help, they're the sweetest people, but I get the feeling they're fucked and don't even know it. Yet, they're coming to me to turn this into something better than they can do alone.\n\nIs this a scenario where I should think bigger and work harder make it happen, or let these people work out their own issues?","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1678413454.0},{"title":"When you and Charlie's is here but not Chef","author":"ForestsNplants","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/47m5ulssdsma1.jpg","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1678381463.0},{"title":"The feeling on the first day of the new job as a rookie.","author":"KushVII","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gGsy9bqpbaU","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1678379472.0},{"title":"AITA? for walking out of a job interview?","author":"Abject-Lab-1752","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/KitchenConfidential\/comments\/11mcb1e\/aita_for_walking_out_of_a_job_interview\/","text":"Very short story.

It\u2019s a casual upscale seafood joint, and I\u2019m a hostess. I make 16$\/hr, a dollar more than the other hostesses. When I started out, the hours worked perfectly with my school schedule and it\u2019s 5 mins from my apartment! Who wouldn\u2019t take that when you know your manager will be great, no commute, good pay\/flexibility, etc? \n\nWell, since the beginning of January my hours have steadily declined. I noticed it was really off right after Valentine\u2019s Day. I\u2019m barely making enough to pay my bills. I love the working environment but as a college student I\u2019m making like 600-800 a month if I\u2019m lucky (rent is 425 along with a few other small bills). Im getting just weekends now. The GM I followed explained that they had to cut hostess hours and that I could train as a server if I\u2019d like. The thing is, I really don\u2019t want to serve when the daily average is 4 servers and MAYBE 10 tables for the shift. and I have offers from some very notable establishments in town that would match or exceed my current pay, with benefits. \n\nThe GM I currently have is genuinely the best manager I\u2019ve had in years and I don\u2019t want him to think I don\u2019t care by leaving, bc I do, but the restaurant is sinking. I\u2019d never say that to him because this restaurant is one of his dreams. I\u2019m torn on leaving because I\u2019ve said in the past I didn\u2019t plan to, but things have changed. What would you do? Train to serve or take the new offers elsewhere? He\u2019s the first manager I\u2019ve ever had to believe in my skills and work ethic. I just hate disappointing people and I love hospitality. This job was the first time I haven\u2019t felt insane for working hard and rewarded for my contributions. \n\nIdk, I may sound silly for wanting to stay just because I\u2019ve found someone who believes in me after years, but I do.","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1678393533.0},{"title":"It's no milk crate, but it sure is fancy.","author":"GreatBigHomie","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/k101gfgc3nma1.png","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1678317416.0},{"title":"How did you go from sous to executive?","author":"formthemitten","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/KitchenConfidential\/comments\/11nc8v3\/how_did_you_go_from_sous_to_executive\/","text":"Id love to hear how you have all bridged the gap.

It's a steady\/consistent 9 hour shift doing prep work with fruit, veggies, , mushrooms, sauces, salads, desserts, and occasional shellfish. My teammates are super supportive and everyone has been great at helping each other out and teaching each other different things and methods. I've quickly become comfortable with my daily work and Chef even gifted me my own knife a few weeks in.\n\nWell, earlier this week the GM and Chef sat me down to talk and said I was doing an awesome job. They said if this were a performance review I would be at 100% and they wanted to know what my goals in the kitchen were. Having never actually worked in a kitchen I have barely a clue of the hierarchy and really didn't have an answer. Two months ago I would have never even thought I would be here working in a kitchen like this and was just taking the job to try, and yet it has made me the happiest I've been in years. Because I didn't really have a clear answer, Chef said he would like to see me keep learning and the next step would be either Sushi or Line (which from what I see on this sub, Line sounds like hell, and the sushi team is already asking for me so...)\n\nBut this is all happening so fast right? I just don't feel like I'm that great and watching these other cooks who have been in this same kitchen for decades makes me think I'm waaaaay out of my league.

Then yesterday we were supposed to add Jerk chicken skewer on the menu and we got full chicken breasts to make them, but apparently that wasn't the cut we ordered and I marinated them anyway thinking we're supposed to just cut them. Today I got walls of texts telling me we never ordered chicken breasts in this kitchen in over 3 years and that I should of ask what to do with them, instead of doing what I thought was right, meaning marinate those fuckers and cut them after and put them on skewers.\n\nSo I told him over text, by the way I'm on my weekend, and apologize and just got told that I should use my logic instead of my guts when it come to the prep, but as I said I never knew that it was a bad cut, he ordered it, the shop gave us a wrong cut, and I tried to make do.\n\nBut then he started antagonizing me over the group chat that I should have known better and I need to step my game or else, then he follows that text by saying we just gonna have to cut them in a butterfly cut and then slice them up, so he founds a solution to a problem but just continue to put the blame on me for something so simple.\n\nNow he wants to a have real talk with me in 2 days, so he can put me on the right way.

I've been an executive chef in different places and in several parts of the country since 2013. I've worked for awards winning Chefs, done private dining, multi account management, catering, and upper education dining. I can manage large staffs, budgets,  P&Ls, and inventories successfully. With all that said, if I don't get out of this industry, I'm going to lose everything. \n\nI have a beautiful house and an amazing fiance. She's very supportive of what I'm going through. No kids and a few dogs. We moved to a new city in December and the EC job I just started in mid January was a massive failure. It caused me to have a blackout panic attack after 6 weeks. I quit. I can't take it anymore. I'm scared this shit is going to ruin my psychological wellbeing and I will push my fiance away until she leaves me for good. \n\nKitchens have destroyed my mental and physical health. I have no motivation to live my life outside of them and when I'm in them I'm miserable. I resent food and even cooking at home at this point. I'm depressed, unhealthy, have very little motivation, and need to get my shit together, which I'm urgently working on right now. \n\nI KNOW there are others out there who know exactly what I'm going through. I'm already talking to a career counselor and an agent at my local unemployment office to receive guidance on how I can translate my resume and experience in culinary arts into another career direction. I have 3 years of college under my belt, but never finished. I studied music at that time. I did not go to culinary school. \n\nI'm considering taking a 100% commission based job as a recruiter for a Nationwide recruiting firm. I'm sure many of you know about it, but I will keep the name to myself. It's remote work with tons of freedom and high earning potential, but feels more like a competitive sales job than anything else. It will also be months before I see a paycheck. \n\nI also have creative ideas for producing products for sale at grocery stores, markets, delis and local shops. Grab & Go stuff. I have a kitchen I can produce in a well, which is already licensed. It seems pretty straight forward,  but that does not get me out of kitchens, which is really what I want at the end of this. \n\nAny and all comments are welcome.

The problem is that it\u2019s a complete disaster of a kitchen.  The kitchen is just a little bigger than a food truck and they crank this absolutely freaking turn and burn chaotic breakfast and then lunch out of there from 6 in the morning until 4 in the afternoon.  There is zero time to set up or prep for what we are attempting at fine dining.  It\u2019s literally impossible, when I walk in it\u2019s the biggest shit show I\u2019ve ever seen in a restaurant.  There are zero cooks in this town and it\u2019s going to be impossible to get reliable ones, and while I\u2019ve created a badass menu it\u2019s just completely unsustainable with zero time in the kitchen.  This weekend was a big weekend for us due to an event in town and it was our first real opening weekend, I told the owners last week there was no way we were prepared and we were going to look like idiots and we went for it anyways and looked like idiots and had to close last night, not necessarily because of dinner service because I\u2019ve been busting my ass, but because the whole thing isn\u2019t functional at all.

When I got offered the job, I was told they were hoping to redo the menu with more Americana inspired dishes, and were hoping my back ground could bring that along a bit. I've got about 3 years of full time experience in the industry, starting in a diner, then a higher end steak house, then a really fun night life hot spot before making thr big move. This is my first foray into a more leadership role, although I've done other jobs in leadership capacities. I thought the menu would be a fun project, and very doable. Boy was I wrong.\n\nThis place is a disaster. Chef is an incompetent buffoon, but at least he's nice. He refuses to sharpen any of the restaurant knives, and insists on serrated blades for everything. Not that there is much cutting. Everything, and I mean everything, is done by him. He only works Mon-Fri, 830 - 330, isn't present for lunch or dinner service, or our weekends ever. He's essentially a prep cook, and insists on cooking everything in HUGE batches, freezing, microwaving, and rebaking dishes. Like who bakes microwaved precooked chicken wings with a straight face? None of the line cooks have any clue what to do because he isn't there to enforce standards, and hasn't told me what he wants, and dodges me when I ask. Front of house manager has a very specific idea about how she wants stuff done, but he gets furious whenever we try to change one of his dishes to be palatable. He doesn't season any food and is upset if you do. He doesn't taste his dishes, and says it's a waste of money if you do. \n\nThere's no stations on the line. People just grab tickets and try and fire them off asap without any communication from FOH to BOH. There isn't anyone there who knows what a passe is, or why it's necessary. I swear, this chef is literally stealing a living.\n\nSo the question is? Do I keep grinding to make it better? Or do I jump ship. It's difficult because 1) I get paid EXCEPTIONALLY well especially compared to Canada, and 2) it's not easy to find  job when you don't speak the local language. On the other hand, I got into the business because I like cooking food for people, and this just isn't cooking. I don't see a way forward or improvement with him staying there.

Some details. We ran out just over a week ago, at least that'w when I realized the red quarts sanitizer hooked up to our 3 compartment was sucked dry. I told a manager, she said she thought we had more in storage so hadn't placed it in the order but would get it next week. Well here it is, next week, and we didn't get any because the other manager swore they saw some and took it off the order. Technically we could be sanitizing our dishes with the food safe chemicals to clean our shake machine, but no one has been mixing the packets into the sink. Just hot water. \nIt's all a shitshow from top to bottom because no one wants to do the work properly, and everyone cuts corners, it means that there's no way a single dish has been properly sanitized for A WEEK. No one has checks the bag before filling sinks and I constantly remind people to use the other chemicals because not properly washing dishes that customers eat food from every single day is soooo dangerous.  Another thing is management couldn't give a fuck. They just tell me to keep doing my part and letting other people know as if this isn't a huge health concern. \nWorst part is I know people aren't always using the soap! This cursed 3 compartment. At best some of these dishes are being sprayed with hot water, dunked in hot water for 10 seconds (shorter than the recommended time in sanitizer, but at this point just add it to the list), and then being refilled with sour cream or our promo sauce that'll be used on multiple items throughout the day. It's sadly just one of those truths of working in the food industry that you just have to get over this and look over it until the problem becomes too problematic or fixes itself.","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1678023951.0},{"title":"\"Cost effective\" premade drink recipes","author":"genregasm","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/KitchenConfidential\/comments\/11jjc77\/cost_effective_premade_drink_recipes\/","text":"What are some of the cheapest drink recipes your restaurant sold to customers?\n\nWhen I worked at a casino I had to make the premade margaritas.

Worked from cashier up to AGM position is various spots (trust me - I am NOT boasting about it). I started my local community college beginning of Jan and landed a decent hourly kitchen gig at a chain restaurant. After two months of working, I can say that that place has very low standards in FoH and BoH. \n\nFor most of my younger years I was a decent hourly employee; obedient, respectful, and always did my job. I called in to call out and was given a hard time, and told to \u201cfind coverage\u201d. Now, from my experience, whenever I\u2019ve said this to an hourly it was because I did not want to be the body to fill those shoes. How come these other guys can literally just call tf out and not getting any bite-back? I\u2019ve fallen behind in my classes and I know it\u2019s because I cannot dedicate the required time to work (on school assignments) with the current 4 day work schedule, so Im cutting it down to 3. Blah blah blah.. I don\u2019t want to talk anyone\u2019s ear off.
