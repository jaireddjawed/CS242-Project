        "text": "[](##My submission does not run afoul of the submission guidelines.)\n\nOver the past few days, dozens of tech companies have filed briefs in support of Google in a Supreme Court case that tests online platforms‚Äô liability for recommending content. Obvious stakeholders like Meta and Twitter, alongside popular platforms like Craigslist, Etsy, Wikipedia, Roblox, and Tripadvisor, urged the court to uphold Section 230 immunity in the case or risk muddying the paths users rely on to connect with each other and discover information online.\n\nOut of all these briefs, however, Reddit‚Äôs was perhaps the most persuasive. The platform argued on behalf of everyday Internet users, whom it claims could be buried in ‚Äúfrivolous‚Äù lawsuits for frequenting Reddit, if Section 230 is weakened by the court. Unlike other companies that hire content moderators, the content that Reddit displays is ‚Äúprimarily driven by humans‚Äînot by centralized algorithms.‚Äù Because of this, Reddit‚Äôs brief paints a picture of trolls suing not major social media companies, but individuals who get no compensation for their work recommending content in communities. That legal threat extends to both volunteer content moderators, Reddit argued, as well as more casual users who collect Reddit ‚Äúkarma‚Äù by upvoting and downvoting posts to help surface the most engaging content in their communities.\n\n‚ÄúSection 230 of the Communications Decency Act famously protects Internet platforms from liability, yet what‚Äôs missing from the discussion is that it crucially protects Internet users‚Äîeveryday people‚Äîwhen they participate in moderation like removing unwanted content from their communities, or users upvoting and downvoting posts,‚Äù a Reddit spokesperson told Ars.\n\nReddit argues in the brief that such frivolous lawsuits have been lobbed against Reddit users and the company in the past, and Section 230 protections historically have consistently allowed Reddit users to ‚Äúquickly and inexpensively‚Äù avoid litigation.\n\nThe Google case was raised by the family of a woman killed in a Paris bistro during a 2015 ISIS terrorist attack, Nohemi Gonzalez. Because ISIS allegedly relied on YouTube to recruit before this attack, the family sued to hold Google liable for allegedly aiding and abetting terrorists.\n\n... rest of the article at:\n\nhttps://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/01/supreme-court-allows-reddit-mods-to-anonymously-defend-section-230/",

They are unable to find nuance because nuance makes things complicated \n\n- If a ''bad'' person says something it is automatically wrong. Doesn't matter what the person is saying. If he doesn't think the way that they want him to, they're incapable of divorcing his/her words from the person that is uttering them. \n\n- Personal responsibility. I can't stress enough how much this annoys me. It is never YOUR OWN fault. Everything bad that has ever happened to me and you is the direct result of someone else's actions. Either some scary evil corporation that is deliberately targeting you, some asshole on the street, cookie monster, etc. Anyone but you and me.

All of the trendy lol buzzwords/phrases like 'this' and 'fuck around and find out', us people outside of reddit have been using them for years. Shits popular in the hood and the shits popular on literally every other social media platform. Yet it took Redditors this long to get with the times. Shit reddit just now started accepting emojis a lot more. \n\nAnd the thing is it isn't just a few Redditors that have started using or saying these things, it's a large amount of them. Reddit hates everything popular and trendy (unless it's some rock or metal band or some video game shit), it takes forever for something that's actually trendy to happen here and then people overuse it. It isn't like some casual thing, it seems like a lot of try hards trying to seem cool and hip.\n\nIt's like all the social trends, the internet trends, the popular things, the memes, all come to reddit way later than when it was actually popular, and then they just continue to overuse it to the point it lost all relevant meaning and doesn't even seem cool anymore. And the same people were just talking shit about the hip social trends a month ago and now they're doing it. \n\nIt's just something I realized. Reddit is not cool. Being a redditor isn't cool. Reddit has never been known as being cool. So when people try to overuse these things on here, it's definitely noticeable, especially when the shit just seems so unnatural.\n\nNot to mention all the nerdy boys on reddit (and the internet in general) that go around saying Gang, brody, my guy, etc tryna seem cooler than they really are üòÇ \n\nThe inauthenticity behind these things are noticeable to everyone else besides ig people on reddit ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",

        "text": "[](##My submission does not run afoul of the submission guidelines.) Five days ago u/IITgeek made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/zu13qr/how_the_heck_does_reddit_search_work_a_very/) putting forward the theory that Reddit might be using automatic OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for its search function:\n\n&gt;  I made a search on Reddit... I searched only the 'first name' of a person... I got 3 search results...\n\n&gt; Now, there was an image post in the search results with 2 comments on it. Now comes the interesting part. When I clicked that result, there was no 'first name' of that person... neither in the title nor in the comments. But the name existed in the image!\n\n&gt; If I need to make a safe assumption, I can say Reddit OCRs (Optical Text Recognition) the image. Or is there some other thing going at the backend?\n\nIn the comment section other alternatives to OCR were also proposed: that the keyword existed in the metadata of the image or in a since-deleted comment in the post.\n\nIt is easy to prove that a deleted comment containing a keyword does still make that post appear in the search results if you search for that keyword, whether or not that is what happened in this instance.\n\nBut what about the other alternatives: is Reddit using OCR? Or metadata? Or perhaps the filename of the picture?\n\nSo I did a simple experiment by making six posts to my private subreddit featuring either 1) a plain [photo of a donut](https://i.imgur.com/K6aQQ1w.jpg) or 2) a [photo of a donut with \"DONUT\" written beneath it](https://i.imgur.com/yXLsfUo.jpg):\n\nNo. | Image description| Filename |Metadata\n---------|----------|----------|----------\n1a | Picture of a donut\t| picture 1a| | \n1b | Picture of a donut\t| picture 1b| Subject: Donut\n1c | Picture of a donut\t| donut 1c| | \n2a | Picture of a donut with \"DONUT\" written beneath it\t| picture 1a|\n2b | Picture of a donut with \"DONUT\" written beneath it\t| picture 1b| Subject: Donut\n2c | Picture of a donut with \"DONUT\" written beneath it\t| donut 2c|\n\nThen I put \"donut\" in the subreddit's search box. At first I got no results. But then after 2 minutes images 2a, 2b, and 2c came up in the search results: the three posts with the word \"DONUT\" written in the image.\n\n**Conclusion: Reddit does indeed use OCR to read the text in images for its search function. And I saw no evidence that the filename and metadata are used in the search.**",
