What am I missing?\nUrl: https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/what-happened-with-the-try-guys-ned-fulmer-drama-explained/436587\n\n\nFull confusion: So I did not even hear of these guys until the whole Ned cheating thing and I did not even start caring until this past week when I watched some videos. While I’m not saying cheating is okay and I completely understand some of the HR issues involved (I’m an attorney so i really do), the decision to remove a founder and the level of animosity is surprising to me. When I first heard of the removal I thought maybe the other guys didn’t really like Ned and he was already kind of the odd guy out or perhaps they really rested on a like innocent image, but after watching the videos it’s clear Ned was not the black sheep and they literally have videos where they get drunk, high, discuss sex and penises, etc. \nThe level of animosity expressed by the guys is really surprising, and the level of betrayal the felt was really shocking. It was like they learned he was involved in god awful crimes or was actively trying to poison them or sell their trade secrets. \nSo I feel like their is a puzzle piece I am missing. Was Ned otherwise problematic or possibly on thin ice? Does the whole fan base feel like this?\n\nThank you!!!",
