        "text": "About to turn 31. I have a great life that I’ve worked hard for, but struggle when it comes to relationships.\n\nI often end up in situationships or don’t get past the 2 month mark. I recently went out a handful of times with someone I really liked (met OLD) and tried to be vulnerable with because I felt chemistry and compatibility, but he was flaky and non committal. I asked him if he wanted to seriously see if we had potential and he ghosted me. \n\nIt’s hard to see some people go from one official relationship to the next with almost no time in-between, I don’t know how they do it. Most of my friends who are now married met their husbands when they were in their 20s.\n\nI moved to NYC when I was 20 and treated dating as a fun, social thing. I was focused on my career. I then moved across the country at 27 for work and did not seriously date the few months leading up to that move and the year or so that I was there because I knew I’d return to the northeast. Then Covid happened and even though I returned to the city and started dating again via the apps, none of the guys seemed to be looking for a relationship. I met someone in real life that I liked at the start of 2021, but it was long distance and only lasted 2 months.\n\nThe past 10 years I’ve probably gone out with 75-100 guys, mostly from online dating. I left the city in the middle of 2021 and have found dating to be even harder where I live now (suburban area, but with lots of bars and restaurants so there are other millennials). It’s a sleepy town in the winter and I don’t go out as much compared to the summer.\n\nI’v never been in love nor in a serious long term relationship. I do talk to a therapist and although I have some anxiety issues and fears of rejection, she feels I have a healthy outlook.\n\nRecently, I had bumble for about 3 months, bought premium, and received about 10,000 “likes” - from that I matched with maybe 20 guys and only went out with 2. It feels like guys just use the app as a game and don’t actually review profiles of women looking for real matches. I’ve since deleted my bumble and hinge to take a break from the apps. \n\nI know I have a lot to offer. I also know I have high standards, but I have a certain lifestyle that I want to share and not give up. I feel most of the men where I live are much more laid back and have different goals.\n\nAll I need is one. I’m trying to manifest that I’ll meet and start dating my future husband this year, but aside from the apps I’m trying to be realistic of how to make our paths cross. So how did you meet your husband and how did you know you were in love and when he was the one?\n\nThanks for reading my long ass ramble.",

        "text": "Hi ladies - dramatic title but not really that dramatic of a problem. Would first like to say I am in therapy and I discuss this often, but sometimes it helps to know someone else has gone through something similar and made the best of it. Long story short, I moved somewhere for an ex, not particularly expecting to like it (mostly because of his bad attitude about the place). But then we moved there, I found cool restaurants and music venues and coffee shops and just really started to love it. I joined hiking groups or solo hiked, volunteered at a farmers market, spent normal weekends in a National Park I just tried to make the best of it whether or not my ex would join. But then my ex cheated and I made a gut decision to move home, the place was too painful as I'd moved for his job. I've now permanently moved somewhere closer to my parents and friends, thinking its what I needed, and on some levels it has been great. But almost daily I think about this city and the life I could have had there and I just really miss it. To clarify \\*NOT\\* the relationship, but this place.\n\nRealistically I couldn't have stayed or couldn't move there now because of my ex, and because it is so far away and I know no one. It was also never really my dream, and now it is and I feel so foolish for leaving. I know staying would have been hard, but this city is close to so much stuff that I love that my current city just doesn't have. Its been a year plus since the breakup so I really don't think I'm romanticizing things, but I guess I could be?  I guess some small part of myself is angry at me/my ex for ruining a chance for an adventure, and I know I am mourning the life my ex promised me/the life I thought I would have, which is why I am in therapy.\n\nI am actively working to find things I enjoy in my current city but I just feel like I'll never shake the what-if. Have you ever had to give up on a dream or gotten stuck on a life you almost had? How did you get over it or make peace with your current situation? How did you let go of what you thought your life would look like?  I do yoga, get outside, go to meetups...but nothing can compare to the access to nature I used to have. Any advice or encouragement from someone who has been through it would be appreciated. Thanks &lt;3",

I spent YEARS  drinking wine late at night  searching the Internet for \"How to stop drinking.\"   \nMy searches  FINALLY led me to a Ted talk where a woman explained how she had taken this one pill (50 mg Naltrexone)  and it had helped her to stop drinking alcohol.  \nSo I went to my doctor and I asked him for a prescription for naltrexone. I've been taking it for about five years.\n\nThere was a period of time where I CHOSE  to drink again due to depression and sadness ( my son died) and I stopped taking the naltrexone and started using alcohol again.\n\nThis period of using alcohol again lasted for more than a year, and then once again I got sick of it and I took the medication AGAIN and oh my God it is a miracle!!\n\nIt really really really helps with the cravings and helps with withdrawal symptoms. \n\nI cannot express  how much it helps.  \nEven though I miss my son very much,  I am very happy and content these days.\n\nIf any of you reading this  are struggling with AUD ( alcohol use disorder)   and you feel like you need help, I strongly recommend that  you ask your doctor for a prescription of 50 mg of Naltrexone. \n\nAlcohol use disorder is a medical problem, and there is a medical treatment to help you! \n\n[https://riahealth.com/blog/a-complete-miracle-how-naltrexone-works-on-your-brain/](https://riahealth.com/blog/a-complete-miracle-how-naltrexone-works-on-your-brain/)",

Far away from family without lifelong friends, single, etc.\n\nI’m curious to hear your criteria for when you should actually stay in a difficult situation. What would have to be true? When do you build resilience vs tell yourself that it’s not worth it?",

        "text": "Hi. I’m 31(f) and recently broke up with my 34(m) fiancé. We were dating for a little over 2 years and got engaged over the summer.\n\nI knew there were red flags early in our relationship but I chose to ignore them thinking that if I brought up my concerns, things would get better. Not to get into too much detail, but his words hardly matched his actions. He would get upset over me for little things and give me the silent treatment. His go-to response whenever we got into an argument was ‘maybe we wouldn’t be together’ or ‘we’re done’. He threatened to break up with me at least a dozen times. He’s lied to me about big and small things in the past (you can see my past post on my page). It took me longer than it should to realize how manipulative and immature he was. You can easily tell that he used to live with his parents before moving in with me. He’s forgetful and complains when I ask him to do a simple chore. Vacuum? He’ll huff and puff while he does it. He sulks and pouts when things don’t go his way. Our sex life has been lacking recently because of me. His past actions and words have been pushing me away to the point where i’m just not as interested in him. He recently told me that if we had more sex then that would make him more responsible. I told him I was depressed one weekend so I wasn’t in the mood to have sex and he got mad at it about it.\n\nHe’s called me neurotic, said he can’t stand me and even said he hated me. He has always apologized and the cycle would repeat itself. I’ve set boundaries but that never mattered. He would avoid communicating with me about our issues and would instead walk away.\n\nHe’s noticed how unhappy I’ve been lately and said that I rarely laugh and smile anymore. I’ve been holding my feelings in because I don’t really have anyone to talk to. Whenever I bring up a serious conversation with him, he says I’m too sensitive and that he’s not the man that I want. I always wondered if it’s my fault. Maybe I’m too tough on him or maybe I am trying too hard to mold him into what I want. I don’t see it that way though. He tells me what I want to hear and then when he doesn’t follow through, he wonders why I get upset.\n\nHe’s a huge people pleaser. It’s frustrating because he’s so polite and sweet to strangers. Every outsider would say how nice and respectful he is but I don’t see that. \n\nWe got into an argument last night and he said he wants to take a break. He said he’s unsure about me and doesn’t know if I’m the woman of his dreams. It hurts equally every time he says things like that to me. This morning he apologized and said he didn’t want a break. For the first time, I stood up for myself and said that I don’t want to be with anyone that is unsure about me. He packed up most of his things and went back to his parents.\n\nI knew months ago that this might not work out. I’m so mad at myself because I knew that and I just kept going. I’m mad because I wasted my time with someone that didn’t deserve me. I was afraid to leave because I didn’t think I would be able to find someone else. I don’t know if I will honestly but I know I can’t just pretend that things would get better. I kept telling myself that he’s not that bad…he doesn’t hit me or cheat on me. But it doesn’t matter, I’m mentally checked out and exhausted. \n\nI just needed to vent somewhere. I’m dreading having to tell my family and friends. It makes me feel like a failure.\n\nAnyway, ladies, have you been able to find love again after leaving a bad relationship? What’re you tips for moving on? I could use some positive stories and tips on how to not feel lonely while I work to move past this. I appreciate anyone that took the time to read this. :)",

I liked his personality too and we just clicked. However, at the end of the summer we knew we would be living in different countries, so our dating had a time limit on it. He is a self proclaimed player and has slept with a very large number (40+) of girls, while I don't have a lot of romantic experience. I don't know how much of this is true, but he also said girls throw themselves at him and try to \"sex\" him. For the above reasons I tried not to fall for him, but he was sweet, kind and supportive, so I did. I got attached to him and I started to really care about him. He told me I was \"special\", that he \"hurts girls, but I hurt him\", and that a player wouldn't invest as much energy and time into me as he did. Though he admitted he pursued me at first just because I'm \"one of the most beautiful girls\" he has seen (it could be something he tells all girls) and he liked the way people stare at him when he is with me. However I'm certain he also cared.\n\nAfter the summer ended, we started living in different places, and our situationship was over. For around 2 months after that we still acted like a long distance couple (having phone calls and saying how we missed each other). This ended when we said we will be just friends. Since we parted ways we've talked and are still talking almost daily. We encouraged each other, we share private thoughts and introspections, we have deep conversations, and we also have fun conversations. Overall we are a good influence on each other. We no longer have romantic conversations, but sometimes he still flirts with me, calls me cute, etc. He is a very closed off person, but he opened up to me. He also doesn't love himself and he has had pretty distant parents. And he is surrounded by fake people who are trying to use him.\n\nOverall it doesn't feel like we are 100% just friends. I don't talk with my male friends daily. And I'm getting sick of it. It was hard for me to get over him because it was like a puppy love for me. He is dating other girls and he told me about how someone asked for his number, how he went on a \"hot date\". That's fine, but I need him to stop treating me like I'm his long distance gf and therapist. He says he doesn't like texting, but he has conversations with me for hours. He should be forming a bond with the girls he is dating, not with me.\n\nStarting next autumn we will be living in the same city again. What I want: for us to remain friends (just friends) and to keep in contact, but not as much as until now. This whole situation took too much of my energy.\n\nWhy is he still talking to me daily, what is the point of this?

        "text": "My  office is mostly men, and mostly male customers with a lot of turnover (no negative reason, it's normal) so I'm constantly meeting new people. I don't have issues with being treated poorly but -frequently- men ask me way too many personal questions. It's like a conversational Trojan Horse where it starts about work and then causally transitions to my career then transitions into my personal life. It seems like they're trying to vet me to see if they can ask me out or send a friend my way. This is frustrating because I don't want to have to be on guard every time I meet someone or assume someones intentions.\n\nTo  be clear- I am NOT interested in dating anyone I meet through work. At  all. I am there to work.\n\nThe specifics: I'll  meet a man and he will immediately try to figure out my background, how  old I am, if I'm married... but asks in a casual \"getting to know you\"  kind of way so it's hard to shut down without being rude - especially since isn't outright flirting. But it's annoying because I can tell that's why they're asking and I don't want to keep having the same conversation over and over again where I turn people down who haven't even asked without outright turning them down. I shouldn't have to give out personal info for them to decide whether to ask or not. Also - they're taking time away from my doing my job. I've had men sit at my desk and \"chit chat\" for 30+  minutes and I want to be more comfortable with ending the conversations but I don't know how. It's like they're exploiting my lack of assertiveness and holding me verbally hostage. \n\nAnd when I do say \"Why do  you ask?\" or \"Does that matter\", \"I need to take this call\" they take it as a challenge and double down on the questions or they just wait to see if it's going to be a long phone call. I've literally had men ask me \"How old are you?\", \"Where are you  from?\", \"Do you live in the area?\", \"Did you move here for work?\".\n\nHow do I shut this down? I've noticed some guys sense discomfort or irritation and instead of backing off they get more aggressive. And other guys are just.... dense. They see it happen and totally excuse the behavior. I've had male coworkers rescue me in the past but I don't have that where I currently work.",

        "text": "Soo. Like the title says, my partner told me I was controlling, displaying toxic behavior, and passive aggression and even though this happened a while ago, it's been bothering me again lately. I thought I would post here because I still don't really understand what I did wrong, and my therapist hasn't been much help at all. \n\nFor context, I grew up in a very religious household where I was not allowed to date, except for marriage. I had very few boyfriends and met my ex husband at 22. I was with him until 33. I'm currently in therapy because communication and setting proper boundaries are very difficult for me. \n\nCurrent SO is the first person I dated after the divorce, and at the time of this incident, I'd been with him about a year.\n\nI work 9-6, and I have to stay on a fairly regular sleep schedule to function.\nPartner had gone back to school, and was on summer break at the time. He joined a discord for a specific game and added me one weekend to join the group and play. I noticed that most of the people in this discord were women, and I just did not gel with them personally. I got a really weird vibe from two of them, so I played one or two rounds and dropped out of the voice chat to go do my own thing, which wasnt really a big deal at first. \n\nI did stay in the overall discord, and over the next few weeks, started seeing partner post weird shit, like talking about getting drunk and posting photos of himself holding liquor when he told me he was doing something completly different. He posted photos of his dog laying in his parents' bed, and he was implying it was his bed... he and one of the women were talking at about the size of the bed amd how fluffy the pillows were, and how comfy it looked. Idk, it just seemed... weird? Like... its a bed and not even his like he's saying it is so whats with that? \n\nSo I would have to go to bed around 10pm for work, but wake up in the middle of the night and would see partner in voice chats with some of these women. 1 am, 2am, 3am 4am. It was usually him and the same two women.\n\nIt really bothered me... not necessarily that they were other ladies, but the time of night. He wasn't talking to me as much at the time, but spending all night in these voice chats.\n\nI finally brought it up to him and expressed my discomfort, because I thought that was what good communication and setting boundaries looked like. I asked if he could try and stay a bit more on my schedule so that we could spend time together afterwork, and I talked about how hurt I was that he was up all night talking to other ladies instead of making an effort to be present when I'm off work.\n\nThis was when he said he appreciated me speaking to him about it, and that he would limit his time a bit, but he was having fun gaming with these people and aside from spending a bit less time, he was not going to change his behavior. Me expecting him to do so was 'toxic and controlling'. I did not 'get to dictate who he spent time with, especially when I have many male friends and he doesnt have a problem with them'.\n\nIt's true, I do have more male friends than female, but when I explained it was more to do with feeling ignored by him and him staying up all night amd sleeping all day, he just got angry and I dropped it. \n\nThis continued on for several more nights, with no change. Same voicechats in the middle of the night, ans weird posts from him bantering with these two people. I slipped back into my non communicative mode and did not bring it back up with him because it seemed pointless, but I finally said fuck this and dropped out of the discord completely.\nMy logic was if I am the one with the issue and I am hurt by this, I need to remove myself from the situation instead of torturing myself by continuing to check and see what was happening, or looking at the weird things he was posting.\n\nHe called me out on this too, and told me that my passive aggressive attempts at control were not going to work, and that maybe I should have made more attempts to get to know these women instead of immediately feeling threatened by them. He said that if something was going on, why would he be doing it in a discord where I could see everything?\nBut with them all playing in the middle of the night meant even if I DID like them, there was nothing I could really do because I have to sleep for work.\n\nAnd this part has always really confused me, because I still don't understand how leaving the situation was passive aggressive? \n\nCan someone help me with insight? I'm not looking for validation if I was truly in the wrong, I'm trying to get better at communicating and boundaries and thought that's what I was doing here.",

I definitely don’t believe this because that theory rules out certain factors (like how some people age differently for example). However, I’m curious how women over 30 perceive their level of physical beauty. I’ve seen women glow up in their 30’s and even 40’s. Hell I’ve seen absolutely gorgeous women in their 50’s.  But as I near 30, the thought of being seen as less attractive by society by default is frustrating and gets me down, even though people always assume I’m 5-6 years younger than I am. \n\nTLDR; Do you think you’re as attractive as you were in your 20’s?

        "text": "Hey lovely people - Just need some input on this. Please be kind :)\n\nI'm (30) involved with a lovely man (36) and we both want a future together. Little backstory: We've known each other for about 10 years. We use to bump into each other on nights out from 2011 and have fun and laughs together. I could tell he liked me but he was never sleazy toward me. We just enjoyed each other's company and I thought he was attractive but heard he was a bit of a player. \n\nSo, 10 years later...after a year of random messages and catch-ups, we properly reconnected in November 2022 by going on a 3-day last-minute holiday in Barcelona. We had an amazing time and got on so well. Laughed and emotionally connected. Then I visited him in the UK in early December (3 days). On the last night of this trip, we discussed what we wanted to do because I'm still living away and going through this weird transitional period. He's in Central America for 3 weeks alone in January (right now) and I'm going to Cambodia alone for a few weeks too (leaving next week) so visiting each other is off the cards for a few months. It's also still quite early days. We agreed to not put pressure on things and in his words \"to give it a better chance of developing into something more in the future\". I was on board with this. Starting a relationship long distance would be a pain. I thought what's the rush if we both have the same goal (a relationship, marriage, kids)? He also isn't on dating apps. He mentioned it on the first night in Barcelona and I couldn't see any when he was swiping on his homepage in front of me the last time we were together. \n\nAnyways, it's been a little tricky as I've felt he's been a little more distant from Christmas until his solo trip. I could sense he wanted to create distance so he could go on his trip feeling like a single man. I get it to a point. I've been patient as my gut feeling says to let it flow and if we're meant to be it will happen.  \n\nHowever, one night he put up some stories in a nightclub and he was filming everyone dancing and of course, it's all very sexy. It's Panama. The camera ended on an attractive woman facing him and she was smiling at him/ flirty and dancing toward him - it really bloody hurt. I messaged him the next day in a calm way and basically said I completely respect our let's not put pressure on things conversation but that particular video felt inconsiderate. Some cousins and my sister follow him (who knows we're involved with each other), It added a layer of embarrassment. Also added to this is the fact we've barely been in contact. He messaged back soon after with a long message apologizing profusely and saying he can see how that looks and he didn't think anything of it at the time. He said it's a different world traveling. He asked if we could have a phone call as he felt he wasn't coming across well over message. He said the last thing he wanted was to hurt me. I said no to the phone call (was worried I might be emotional) and said let's take space and said enjoy the holiday and we can maybe speak properly sometime after. \n\nWhat are your thoughts? Is this a red flag or a dealbreaker? Or did I totally overreact? I'm trying to figure out what to do. \n\nTLDR: Long distance and not official with a guy but we're heading that way. He put what felt like an inappropriate instagram story of an attractive woman flirtily dancing toward him  - too disrespectful to continue? Or was I completely overreacting?",

I originally moved from my city to be with my partner at his house which is in a secluded area. I found a great job where I can work from home, but I do need to be in the area.\n\nThe relationship is not physically abusive, but he beats me down emotionally a lot. I've become isolated from friends and loved ones and lost all self-esteem. I'm currently in counselling and now on medications for my mental health. In our time together I feel he's used me a lot. I have helped him advance in his career, with projects, emails, applications. I look after his pets 3 days 2 nights a week, and over the weekend when he goes on sporting trips etc. But in turn he won't even spend time with me or my friends. He makes us get into a fight anytime there is an opportunity to spend time together doing what I would like. Then it never ends up happening. I feel very down and lonely.\n\nFinancially I could move out (just barely), but as I have a dog I would either need to rent a very expensive property. Also, there are not many in my area. If I did that, I would have no money to my name and end up even more depressed.\n\nI've decided to detach myself mentally from the relationship, but to still stay in it. I'm doing this to give myself a bit of time to work on a plan, my own wellbeing, and get myself set up in a good living and working situation. I dont want to throw out everything I have worked for because of him.\n\nIf you've read this far, I'm just wondering what I can do to help my wellbeing while staying in this relationship but checked out mentally and working on my plan.",

        "text": " Hey all,\n\nThrowaway account.\n\nI'm struggling a bit with my LDR relationship (32F) with my boyfriend (29M) and we've been involved for 3 years and dating for 1.5 (we couldn't meet IRL because of covid). I love him deeply and he's my best friend. He's also the best relationship I've ever had, I've never been with someone more kind to me and he's very emotionally mature. The challenge is that he's not financially stable at all and I'm in a place where I'm ready to have kids in a few years.\n\nWe're both freelance creatives, though I work more in the tech sphere and make a comfortable amount of income. He's moving to my country in a couple of months to start a life here and try to make it work. I completely acknowledge that he is making a big life shift and I appreciate it.\n\nHe comes from a very comfortable upbringing and my family are immigrants who had to fight tooth and nail to be able to be able to make a life for themselves when they moved here (they also faced a lot of racism). I think this, in part, has influenced our work ethic and the survival modes we have.\n\nDespite his comfortable upbringing, he doesn't have financial literacy and I think he made about 12k last year, which was not enough to support himself in the major city he is living in. He had some help from his parents and also moved back in with them for 6mo to save a bit before moving to me. Even though he made so little, he is not very responsible with his money and spends a lot on Uber eats, etc., and doesn't really have any savings. He also has a big issue with his weed usage (which encourages his depression), smoking throughout the day. He struggles a lot with procrastination, often of some important things. We've spoken about all of this and he says it will all change when he moves (and maybe it will, who knows). Because of his depression, I find that more weight is on me to get us out of the house (when we are together) because he would rather just stay home, smoke, and order food. On my end, I also sometimes feel resentment because sometimes he’ll say he’ll do something (like go to the doctor for medical ailments, look for work, etc.), but his challenges with weed and depression make it difficult for him to follow through. \n\nI know my situation is fortunate in many ways. I'm okay with making more and being more of the breadwinner when we're married, but I just need him to have \\*some\\* financial stability and literacy. He says he could see a future with me, but he can't make any further commitments until his financial situation is better, which I also get. He's a great artist, but I don't know he's going to be able to get it together financially within a timeline that could work for us.\n\nI guess I just would love to talk about it with some of the people here and hear stories. I want to see where it goes and I'm not ready to leave now and I want to see how it goes once he moves, but I also can't stay too much longer and I'd like to be able to be in a relationship that has the legs to go where I need it to go.

They have two other good tours but they’re 15 days which I think is too long for me (thanks work)\n\nG Adventures: I’ve done a tour with them before so I was going to do their best of Spain or something tour until I found out its mostly 50-60s yr olds. And their 20/30s trip stays in hostels and I just feel I’m too old to put up with that lol\n\nTravendly and FTLO: I’m very interested in both these companies. They just don’t have a specific Spain trip so I’m sad. They have some really good tours but I really want to go to Spain next. One has a southern France and Barcelona trip, then maybe I could add 4 days to go to some other cities but I still kind of would like to be a group thing. They also both have Portugal trips which would be cool but I’d have to still work in Spain too somehow.",

As an adult, it’s pretty hard to make friends, but I’ve done it successfully! This is a fact I am very proud of. So, I always try and keep that in mind when people put themselves out there (to me).\n\nAbout a year ago, I was on a work call with some of our project consultants. We have a friendly working relationship. Sometime after that, one of the project consultants reached out to me on my work email to ask if I’d be open to meeting for coffee. I said yes, assuming this was some kind of informational interview or networking opportunity for her. We met for coffee, and it was totally fine, and she asked if I would be open to doing it again. I said ok - at this point, I still wasn’t sure exactly what she was looking for, but it seemed professional and as we just talked about work and city life and how our companies were handling COVID. I asked her why she reached out to me, and she said, “Oh, you seemed cool, so I figured I’d reach out.”\n\nAfter our second coffee meet up, which was again fine, I started to feel a little confused. We were cordial, but we weren’t exactly fast friends. Had some things in common, but I didn’t find she was super open about herself. After this, I was like, well, see you around.\n\nShe then reached out to me for a third meet up, and asked if I’d be willing to hang out - but didn’t suggest anything. I wasn’t super receptive, but figured I would go and basically ask her what this as about. What was starting to feel weird to me was the lack of friend chemistry, the lack of an ask, and the frequency with which she suggested we meet (all within 6 months). I should mention that I am open to dating women, so I started to think perhaps this was intended to be a romantic connection? I’ve never dated a woman before though, so not sure.\n\nOn our third meet up, which was lunch at a place I suggested, we talked about work again, and then I started asking more questions about her, her life, because she hadn’t really shared much with me at that point. She shared she had a husband and a few dogs! Okay, so, not romantic?\n\nSo, at that point, after our lunch, I decided I didn’t need to invest anymore time in whatever this was. She then reached out to me again, and asked if I had time to hang out over the summer and that she “wanted to hear about all my life updates” (I left the company), and I effectively said, I’m too busy, but have a great summer!\n\nThen, finally, I got a message from her recently saying she was moving out of the city and was really hoping to see me before she left. I ignored it.\n\nWhat do you all make of this? Is there something I’m missing here?",

        "text": "She was very pushy in the beginning. She wanted me to care for her 93-year-old mother and I repeatedly told her that it wasn't a good idea and that she should find somebody else or have her mother come live with her in the bay area. I'm in Los Angeles. Her mother was as well and her mother wanted to stay in Los angeles, but with all her health issues and everything, I told the persistent daughter of this woman that \"I can't really help you.\"\n\nThat did not stop her from pursuing me further and eventually I just caved and started looking after her mother. This lady told me all kinds of things like \"you're family\" and paid me nice sums of money. The employment relationship went on for about one and a half years before we ran into some trouble. \n\nThe trouble was that this elderly woman had a son who had schizophrenia and smoked cigarettes like a chimney, ate sugar like it was going out of style and ate meat every single chance he could get. He also would come over and destroy her apartment to the point where I was basically a cleaning lady and mopping his piss up off the floor and doing all the dishes that he left behind. It was a total shit show. Eventually, his behavior got really bad to the point where he attempted to attack me and so I maced him.\n\nLooking back, I probably shouldn't have maced him but it seemed like the best idea at the time. I was very stressed in that situation, cleaning up after him for about 3 hours and then he decided to attack me. So I didn't know what else to do because I was completely alone in the apartment and no one was going to help me. We had run into several situations like this before where he was combative and I had to assist his brother (who lives about 20 mi away from his mom) in 5150ing the guy, which was stressful. \n\nAnyway, after the macing incident, I was let go from the position and from what I heard, the crazy son kept visiting his mother despite attempts to put him in a boarding home for mentally ill adults. It seems like this is what the elderly woman wanted. Even though he was a total pain in the ass, she loved him very much and wanted to be with him despite the protestations of her other children.\n\nWell fast forward about 5 months and the guy suddenly drops dead. So the 93-year-old woman is now left without her favorite son and obviously she's devastated. To top it off, she has to move up to the Bay area to live with her daughters, who she loves but finds to be a little overbearing.\n\nThe woman (one of her daughters and the employer mentioned at the beginning of this post) who contracted me to take care of her mother contacts me out of nowhere and tells me that this has happened... That her brother has died and that there will be a funeral online. I offered to send flowers and she refused my offer. I spoke to her a couple more times and offered my help in case she needed it\n\nJust recently, I sent a couple Christmas cards and New years cards over text and got no response. Today, I texted to ask what's going on in the Bay area with the flooding and if everything's okay and no response. \n\nSo I'm being ghosted I guess. This woman had told me previously that she would be a good reference for me. I've always gotten the feeling that she really begrudged paying me because she would slip in passive aggressive comments here and there about how I was being greedy. But I could never really take those seriously because she was the one who hounded me despite me saying repeatedly that she should find someone else to care for her mom.\n\nI guess I'm just having trouble understanding why somebody would ghost me like that after we had what I thought was an okay relationship. I'm looking for some answers, maybe some ideas as to why she would just stop talking to me? I just have no idea and it kind of hurts.",

        "text": "Friendship breakup coping needs\n\nFriendship Breakup how do I cope\n\nThis seems absolutely ridiculous to even type this out so I apologize if it is lengthy and a bit train of thought. I was in a toxic and quite honestly abusive friendship for about 6 years and now that we have broken up I’m very very lost and could use some advice or words of encouragement.\n\nBackstory: we met because we mutually did the same work (photographers) we became instant close friends very quickly traveling together. At the time I had a 1 year old son. \n\nI’m a people pleaser and a victim of abuse so it’s hard for me to see red flags. I had a miscarriage once and she had asked me if I was still planning on working a wedding with her the next day. That was it. Not how are you doing are you ok. So I worked the wedding with a dead fetus inside of me and the next day I had my D&amp;C\n\nWhen she miscarried years later she apologized for how she acted and said she had no idea what this pain felt like.\n\nLater when I found out I was pregnant with my now daughter and we found it was a girl (first girl) her response was “oh idk if I see you as a good girl mom”\n\nWhen I had the baby I had an elective c section again, she was complaining all morning about a work situation. I told her hey I’m having my baby now. It took her 6 hours to ask me about the baby but still the entire time texted me about this work situation while I was having a baby. But don’t worry when she gave birth she got the space she needed. These are the big things but of course the day to day happened. Shaming my opinions etc. but it was good too. She always talked to me. Made the days less lonely and sad. Encouraged my work. \n\nIt all culminated when I sent her a text saying our friendship was done finally. She freaked out. I found out my son had a form of lymphoma. So I needed the comfort. She reached back out and I let her back in. \n\nWhen it was his birthday party it was so important to me because he had been sick with lymphoma but she sent me a text the morning of essentially just saying she will never be able to come to the party because seeing my husband and mom after our fight causes HER too much anxiety.\n\nAnyway if you made it this far after that I never texted her again. Deleted her from socials \n\nTurns out though I’m still very emotionally messed up from all of this and idk how to manage",

He ended up stopping asking how my day was and walking with me for 20 minutes. \n\nOur rooms were next to eachother and we were both there with family. He spoke to my mom a few times over the course of the vacation. \n\nDuring the conversation he asked about what i did and I mentioned i was a developer/graphic designer. He says I should take his number because he has this business idea he wants a website for. Which when he explained it, was a vague description of another LinkedIn. \n\nWe talked about family and the trip, before I head back and he reminded me again to take his number so I gave him my phone to add himself as a contact. He pat me on the back for some reason. \n\nWhen I told my sister this, she was sure he was hitting on me. And i was too considering how generic of a business idea he had and how he approached me without knowing what i did. I won't lie, i was excited because he was attractive, was also a lawyer and seemed respectful/nice.\n\nWhen I got home I texted him a few days later. He replied saying he was sure I was going to ghost him. Made some small talk. And then he just said \"will you be able to help me with the website and the backend\" which kinda crushed me because I realize he wasn't hitting on me and maybe just trying to get cheap labor? \n\nIdk. I told him his idea needs to structured out in a plan to see the scope of work and that it's a big endeavor because there are already dominating social networks. \n\nHe replies saying he hasn't worked it out yet but will discuss it with me. And then I said sounds good and ended it there. This is over the span of 2 days. He's currently travelling somewhere else. \n\nI'm usually pretty good with rejection or when something doesn't go as i intended. I'm not sure whether it's because I'm on my period or that i actually thought a guy out of my league would be interested in me, but man it's disappointing. What makes it even worse is his business idea is literally just an idea of a website where people connect. It's so generic, that I thought he made it up on the spot. \n\nI'm also neurodivergent so I never even initiate contact with men because it's hard for me. I just let them approach. \n\nAnyway, why am i taking this so hard and what can i do to not let this happen in the future? I dont think I have the right mindset/perspective but for whatever reason it's made me quite sad.",

        "text": "I \\[35F\\] am worried I've made the wrong choices and totally screwed up my chance at happiness and the life I want.\n\nI'll try to keep it brief but I'm not very good at that usually. Forgive me. \n\nI grew up in a pretty turbulent home, with two very emotionally unavailable parents and no semblance of a good relationship modelled to me (my Mum and Dad divorced when I was 8, my mum dating unsuitable men throughout my teens, Dad visit once a week but very uninvolved) and also had a school life where I lived in fear of physical violence every day. As you can imagine, it shattered my self-esteem and sent me into my 20s an emotional and mental hot-mess. But I always dreamed that one day I'd have a home and a happy-ish, healthy-ish family of my own.\n\nOf course, I didn't realise any of this at the time until I had a 5 year relationship between 21-26 with a guy who was manipulative, threatening, controlling, etc; but being who I was, with my low self-esteem and anxious attachment, and his avoidance, stuck around for far too long because I thought (and he repeatedly told me) no one else would have me. I then got into a relationship with the most wonderful guy – everything I could have ever wanted – but at that point he was the only person who had *ever* told me they loved me or that I was worth having around, so again my anxious attachment went wild and I clung so hard to him, he bolted. With hindsight, I don't blame him.\n\nIn both situations, I was partly so reliant because I was earning a fairly low wage and living with those guys in London. Stability, security and having a safe place to come home to has always been a big deal to me because again, I didn't have that throughout my early years.\n\nNewly single, 'homeless' and unemployed at 28, I moved back home and in with my Dad to get myself sorted and vowed I would a) go to therapy, b) get my own life, money and housing and c) not date until I had made some headway on A and B. Again, I still felt optimistic that there was plenty of time to find a that home and a happy-ish, healthy-ish family of my own. \n\nA few months later, I applied for and got my dream job. I knew it was only temporary and not something I could do forever due very physical work and anti-social hours. I started working with an OK therapist within my budget. I travelled a lot, particularly to the US where I had a ton of friends from my college semester abroad. I also became more observant in my Judaism.\n\nFast forward to 31, I knew I wanted to be able to travel more, keep more normal hours, earn more money and not be tied to London rental prices ... I started a graphic design business and put my college credits to good use. I left my job, took it full time, paid off £20k debt and doubled my income to £70k in the space of a few months, then upgraded to a much better therapist.\n\n32-33. Corona. Plans to spend more time in the US and any dating totally off the table, I turned my attention to purchasing a property. I bought a little house in Leeds and felt a huge sigh of relief that I had a cosy, safe space of my own that no landlord could shake me out of ... and a huge sense of accomplishment too.\n\n34, renovating house. Who has money or time to think of anything other than when tf my builders are turning up.\n\nNow I'm here, at 35. Feeling like I've got all my ducks in a row. Perfect work-from-home, my own business with great money, work I enjoy and family-friendly hours. A secure roof over my head. My mental and emotional health is 1000x what it was before and I know I'm actually ready to bring a sh!t load to the table as a partner. \n\nBut.... it feels that I've ignored dating and relationships for too long and now it's simply too late for me. It sounds so stupid when I write it all out but I can't shake the feeling that I've missed the boat on a husband and family of my own. I love the security my house gives me but I don't love Leeds much. I don't have much contact with my own family for the sake of my sanity, and all my friends are either in London, NYC or LA – places I'd much prefer to settle forever.\n\nSearching online gives me tons of rhetoric about women in their 30s having prioritised their career or partying and regretting it. It was never like that for me, I certainly was never a party girl, it was all about building myself up to be OK on my own and make a life for myself that was different to what I'd been born into.\n\nI've had four short term partners of a few months each since the big break-up at 28 but it just isn't where I've focused my energy and now I'm practically and emotionally ready to do that, I feel totally on the back foot in terms of my age. Has anyone else put off dating until their mid-30s and been successful??",

It was a summer beach holiday and I wore a one piece cut out swimsuit. \n\nMy cousin was wearing a sun safe swimsuit that was more covered up. \n\nI have felt some weird vibes since the trip ended and I’m worried that perhaps she was displeased or uncomfortable that I was confidently wearing a swimsuit (nothing revealing really). \n\nIt wasn’t a g string type bottom or low cut or anything. I thought I was stylish. \n\nDo you think that I was inconsiderate to not cover up a lot or wear a long sleeve coverup swimsuit? \n\nI wasn’t trying to show off to anyone I just wanted to wear my new swimsuit. \n\nAfter the holiday ended I began to wonder whether my cousin thought I was purposely wanting to get attention from her partner. I’m probably being paranoid. \n\nI worry she’s telling my aunt that I was wearing a revealing swimsuit and how uncomfortable she felt.",

We ain't talked in the year since because I figured she needed the space.\n\nShe decided to reach out a few weeks ago after about a year just to say hey hope things are going well. We chatted for a bit and caught up. She had a tough year but was pulling through. Figured that was the end of it.\n\nNow she's texting/calling me every week, sometimes twice a week, and she's pitched meeting up and maybe even getting back together. I still feel that spark too on some level but this just seems like a bad idea that don't make no sense since she's better off on her own. That's a big reason we split in the first place was figuring out she'd be happier single like a lotta women out there.\n\nI tried telling her that this is better for both of us but she ain't hearing it even when I been pretty blunt. I ain't a bridge burner so I ain't looking to cause a buncha heartache or nothing with something that oughta be settled. How do you tell someone to respect a breakup without coming off like an asshole? We got mutual friends and I really ain't looking to put them in a bad spot where they feel like they gotta choose between two folks who fall out.\n\nTL;DR how do you get your ex who's super persistent to back off without being an asshole?",

This is a relatively big shoe store with 3 flagship stores in major cities across my country. \n\nWhat happened was that I tried on two pairs of leather slip-ons. One pair was $220 and the other $380. I snapped a pic to my mum who preferred the more expensive pair, as did I. I decided the price tag would be worth it. When I went to pay for them however, I noticed that the more expensive pair I was about to buy had been put in the box for the cheaper pair. I was sure they would notice but the shoes the  went through 3 different people and not a single one noticed they were the wrong shoes in the box. The cashier scanned it and I ended up paying $220. \n\nAt the time I felt lucky and decided not to say anything. But now I'm just feeling guilty profiting off someone else's mistake. My family and friends are split on the decision and I'm considering calling them back to let them know there has been a mistake.\n\nWhat would you do?",

I've searched reddit for women who've used male escorts and the very few experiences I've read about were very positive. Yes women technically don't have to \"pay\" for this kind of attention but I've considered the pros and cons of doing so. I want to acknowledge that escorts and tantric/yoni massage therapists are two different services and not the same thing however I've considered both for the future for different reasons. Also if any women has experienced either please share.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Escorts*\n\n**Pros:** \n\n\\-Adult workers usually get tested\n\n\\-You get to select someone you're physically attracted to\n\n\\-When you find someone in the wild, you're playing Russian roulette and the sex might be lame and mediocre and not worth the potential risks of dealing with some crazy stranger but with an escort it's pretty much guaranteed it'll be good\n\n\\-you can specifically request what you want versus have a lame sexual experience with someone whose selfish and one sided (see above point)\n\n\\-there aren't the same complications you experience with FWB's or casual partners, this is more clear cut \n\n**Cons:**\n\n\\-it's a paid transaction\n\n\\-it can be costly \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Tantric/Erotic/Yoni Massage:*\n\n**Pros**\n\n \\-improves mental health benefits, can be relaxing, sensual, and empowering\n\n \\-the reviews I've read on reddit sounded pretty explosive and amazing\n\n\\-Working with someone who knows their way around a body and has skillful hands \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Cons**\n\n\\-not sure \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYes, this is a taboo topic.
