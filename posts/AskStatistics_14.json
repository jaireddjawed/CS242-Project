(Is there a clear answer to this?) In this context I'm talking only about simple RT, e.g. to make a response as quickly as possible whenever a stimulus occurs.\n\nClearly one cannot have a negative RT, so there is a lower bound of 0 ms. Often the response period will be capped as well, enforcing an upper bound (generally a second or two). Either of these negates the normal distribution (I think), and on top of this they often have a positive skew.\n\nIs it really correct to log-transform these in order to analyse them, and then continue as usual since there is some idea that RT is log-normal? This was what my friend said but I am not sure if it is accurate.\n\nAnother related question, if we were to take the median as a robust estimate, then keep doing that for all subjects in our hypothetical experiment, would the mean of medians be normally distributed?\n\nI am not interested in a specific recommendation for a test, I'm more interested in understanding how to approach the problem itself (of analysing this data with an unknown distribution).",

Long story short, I am at the part where I am running the logistic regression.  \n  \nNow I have a two models.  \nA - very simple model with 3 variables.  \nB - Much more complicated model with ~20 variables.  \n(For context train size is ~55k obs with ~1k 'bads'.   \n  \nNow for both models, all variables are statistically significant with p values well below 0.05. However, I'm using AIC and AUROC as a means of comparing the two models. My understanding is the higher AIC, the better and same for AUROC.  \n  \nThis is where I am getting mixed signals. Model A has an AIC in excess of Model B (10000 Vs 9500) but Model B has a higher AUROC (0.82 Vs 0.74).  \n  \nWhich is better to use to interpret the two models? Also, is there any other tests which could help?  \n  \nThis is all new to me so if it seems obvious to you it probably isn't to me, I'm just looking to learn!  \n  \nAs a side note I have run a likelihood ratio test too which seems to indicate Model B is superior.  \n  \nBonus question (is that allowed?) Is there a limit to how many variables I should be using in my model? 20 seems like a lot.  \n  \nThanks!",

        "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nIn my last stats class, we learned about a bunch of nonparametric alternatives to the t-test, like the permutation test and bootstrapping. However, I am getting a little hung up on the framing of the null hypothesis for these tests.\n\nIn most of the examples I've seen, the null and alternative hypotheses are no different from those used in the t-test: the null is equality of population means, while the alternative hypothesis is that they aren't equal/one is larger than the other. However, it seems to me that these resampling techniques operate under the assumption that the two groups being compared not only have equal means, but are drawn from the same underlying distribution. In bootstrapping, we repeatedly resample from the pooled data, and in permutation tests, our reshuffling is motivated by the null assumption that the two groups could've been arbitrarily picked from the same population. \n\nGiven this, I don't understand how it's possible to use these tests to solely assess a difference in means unless we assume the variances of the two populations are equal, which then seems contrary to the definition of a nonparametric test. It feels like the only hypothesis these resampling tests are equipped for is that of different population distributions, yet I've read that bootstrapping can be leveraged to calculate p-values for almost any summary statistic.

This was during the height of the pandemic and if all the parts of the outcome that we could assess by phone were good, we did not force patients to come in to take blood for the final component of the outcome which was a lab value. \n\nTherefore we end up with data where the component 5 is selectively missing in patients in whom components 1-4 are quite favourable. We considered this missing at random of component 5 depending on the values of component 1-4 and imputed the missing values.\n\nThe statistical reviewer (at a good enough journal that I am starting to doubt our interpretation) responds that \"missingness is selective and systematic rather than random.\" I feel like the reviewer doesn't seem to use the standard MAR/MCAR/MNAR terms here and says that the missingness isn't random, which it isn't by definition under MAR.\n\nBecause of this they want us to primarily do a complete case analysis, which IMO is biased because it excludes the patients who were doing best (and because they were mostly in the treatment group, which makes sense if a treatment actually works better than placebo, this reduces the effect size). Our pre-specified protocol also had the imputed analysis as primary for this reason. \n\nSo, do I have a point or am I just completely off here?

For example, if all respondents gave their opinion on some issue on a scale from 1-10, the unstratified mean would simply be the sum of all responses divided by n. But for a \"true\" or truer mean, I'd multiply each individual response by each individual's weight, and then calculate the mean. Please correct me if I'm already wrong at this point.\n\nBut what I want to do now is something different. I have three items that I use to assign a dummy variable to individuals. The items probe support for a generous welfare state, and for those individuals who express a strong opinion (i.e. agree or disagree strongly) consistently across these three items, I create a new variable that assigns them a \"1\", otherwise a \"0\". There are then two of these dummy variables, one for those strongly in favor of generous social policy, one for those against. Then I want to calculate the proportions of individuals with a \"1\" in the whole sample, by country, by education, by employment status, etc.\n\nBut I don't know what to do with the weight now. All individuals with a \"0\" would still have a zero after multiplication with the weight, whereas the \"1\"s would then have their weight as their value. Is the post-stratified proportion of individuals with quality \"1\" then simple the mean of that corrected dummy variable?\n\nThanks in advance!",

Is excel respectable for this use case or should I be using R (or an alternative?)\n2. With respect to the Excel regression output appended, would p-values for the dependent and intercept use the respective dependent and intercept t-values and degrees of freedom values?\n3. What is the difference between F and Significance F? Is one of them critical F or am I just remembering the wrong things?\n4. From a statistical perspective if you are looking at bond yields/how they influence each other what metrics would you focus on?

When I took a course on probability theory this past summer, we spent some time on convolution integrals and related integral transforms that made certain calculations a variable's PDF/CDF easier (can't remember the terminology for the type of transforms) which seemed quite analogous to using the Fourier and Laplace transforms to convert between the time and frequency domains in electrical engineering.  \n\nSo now I'm wondering, do we ever try to represent empirical distributions (i.e. the distribution of an actual data set that doesn't match any of the common distributions) as infinite sums of the common distributions (e.g. normal distribution, exponential, poisson, etc.)?",
