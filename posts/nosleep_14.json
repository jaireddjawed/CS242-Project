        "text": "**PROLOGUE**\n\n “It’s Saturday night, bro. Time to hit the town and meet some ladies,” Peter flashed his roommate Josh an encouraging grin. He wore $400 designer jeans and an expensive button-down shirt, both beyond the means of a starting salary of a twenty-six-year-old bank teller, and looked serious about getting some action tonight.\n\n“Don’t tell me you’re just going to be a couch potato and veg in front of the TV.” \n\nJosh shrugged. \"Catching a UFC fight isn’t vegging out in front of the TV.”\n\nJosh had no intention of leaving the comfort of his man cave tonight. Hitting a club or trendy bar to meet a chick was a costly exercise in frustration and a waste of time. He was over it! Of course, his attitude might be a direct consequence of his most recent break-up. He’d thought Karen loved him. His ex didn’t just break his heart—she’d shattered it. He was still picking up the pieces. Bottom line – he wasn’t quite ready for the face-to-face rejection to be found in New York City’s nightlife. \n\n“Come on, Josh, I could use a wingman tonight,” Peter said. A ‘wingman’ was Peter’s code for a designated driver. Why waste money on Uber when your buddy can chauffeur your drunk ass around town? \n\nJosh gave it to Peter straight. He loved his roommate but this wasn’t the first time they’d played this game. “Only reason you want me to come is because you need someone to drive your drunk ass to Taco Bell if you strike out tonight. Seeing you medicate your sexual frustration with junk food isn't my idea of fun.”\n\n“Hey, you got a problem with me, fine, but don't knock Taco Bell.”\n\nPeter grinned. He could be an asshole, but he was a charming asshole. Josh smiled despite himself but stayed firm and shook his head. \n\nPeter shrugged, accepting defeat, and said, “Have fun.” With that he marched out of their two-bedroom apartment, and the door slammed shut behind him. \n\n*Finally some peace.* \n\nJosh’s attention returned to the television.\n\nBack in his college days, Josh was like poor Peter. He’d hit the bars and clubs on the weekends, cruising the various watering holes in a horny, alcohol-infused daze. His prowling for girls mostly pickled his liver and blew through his hard-earned cash. Nowadays he only used the internet to find dates. \n\nOn a whim Josh grabbed his phone and called his kid brother Mark. It took two rings before Mark picked up. \n\n“So what’s up? You going to catch the fight with me?” Josh asked.\n\n“I shouldn’t. I got a ton of homework. Classes are kicking my ass.”\n\nUnlike Josh, who at twenty-six had been navigating the corporate job market for a few years, Mark was still in school – lucky bastard. He was at Hunter College studying to be a physical therapist and would make bank when he graduated. The city school’s nursing and physical therapy programs were considered among the best in the state. \n\n“Come on, bro. How about a study break?”\n\nJosh didn’t see himself as a bad influence here, just a concerned older brother. He knew from experience that prolonged work produced diminishing returns. Some time away from the books would do the kid some good. Give him a chance to clear his head. \n\n“Alright, count me in,” Mark said.\n\n“Good man. Don't forget to pick up the pizza. I'll see you in a few.”\n\n*CLICK*. Josh hung up. He took a deep, satisfying swig from his Stella Artois and switched his attention back to the fight.\n\nSuddenly his phone pinged. A direct message from Tinder, a dating app he’d been using for the last few months. \n\nThe message was from a girl named… Akasha. \n\n*“Hi Josh, how are you?”*\n\nJosh hesitated. He typed a quick, perfunctory response. *“I'm good.”*\n\nJosh stared at Akasha’s Tinder profile pic, which was visible next to the message box. A haunting, intense beauty, her looks managed to be both ethereal and sexual at the same time. Lush black hair framed a pale face dominated by a pair of dark, penetrating eyes; there was a promise in them accentuated by a hint of a smile. The girl possessed a real edge that came through even in the stamp-sized image on his phone. \n\nAnother pinging sound announced her next message.\n\n“*What are you up to?”*\n\n*“About to head out to dinner with a friend*,” he lied. *“No time to chat...”* \n\nHer next text was immediate – he wasn’t getting off the hook that easily. “*Why are you avoiding me, Josh? Don't you love me anymore?”*\n\n“Jesus, what a freak!” Josh said out loud. “How could I be in love with you after one date?” Another instant message in direct response to Josh's words. \n\n*“So you lied to me last night*.”\n\nA frozen moment. \n\nA chill traveled down Josh’s spine. He scanned his apartment, suddenly on edge, senses alert. Thinking out loud again: “How did she know what I just said?” \n\nImmediately a direct message answer appears on-screen: “*Because I'm in your bedroom, darling.”*   \nThe chilling response was followed up with a loud banging sound. \n\n*What the hell?* \n\nThe noise had emanated from his bedroom. \n\nJosh waited a second, breath lodged in his throat and…\n\nThe pounding repeated itself, this time much louder, more insistent.\n\nJosh rose from the couch. The sounds could no longer be ignored. \n\nWary, he approached the partially open bedroom door, body coiled, mouth clenched.\n\n“Hello? Anyone there?”\n\nNo answer. \n\nJosh reached the bedroom door but hesitated for a beat before his fingers closed around the doorknob. As the door opened completely, inky darkness awaited within. \n\nHe flicked a switch and light flooded the room. It revealed his bed, a few cool movie posters, a tangle of dirty laundry...\n\nBachelor city. \n\nStill on edge, eyes scanning, Josh took a few steps into his bedroom. Nothing out of the ordinary, just a room cloaked in shadows.\n\nSomething felt off, though. \n\nJosh sniffed the air and picked up the faint aroma of burnt wood. Like there was a campfire outside. Except that it was December in New York City, so that didn’t make any sense at all...\n\nJosh's gaze dropped, and his eyes widened with puzzlement. For a moment he wasn’t quite sure what he was looking at. It looked like a black smear in the shape of a human footprint. \n\nHe crouched to get a better view and touched the print. His fingertips came up black, smeared with ash. It was still hot. \n\nFollowing a sudden hunch, Josh’s gaze traveled toward the impenetrable darkness underneath the bed. For a crazy moment he expected something to jump out at him, a horror flick come alive, but a quick scan revealed that no boogeyman lurked under his bed. \n\nJosh let out a sigh of relief, felt the tension ease from coiled muscles. \n\nJosh was about to get up when he sensed rapid movement behind him. \n\nHe whirled… \n\nShock rippled through him at the horrific sight before him. \n\nAnd then fear gave way to pain.  \n \n\n**CHAPTER 1**\n\nI get off the phone with Josh and already regret my decision to take a break from my studies. My older brother just has a knack for talking me into stuff. I’ve been hitting the books since early this morning – ten hours straight of cramming for my biology final. I’m fried and have to take a break if I want to maintain this pace for the rest of the weekend. I need to turn off my brain for a little bit—watching guys beat the shit out of each other is exactly what the doctor ordered.\n\nMy girlfriend Lynn, who is in the same physical therapy program at Hunter College, flashes me an encouraging smile. She reclines on her couch, wrapped in a Snuggie and buried under a growing collection of flash cards. There’s a steaming cup of green tea by her side. The same massive anatomy book that has been taunting me all day rests on her lap, and once again I wonder why the hell they don’t sell a digital version of this beast.\n\n“Go. You need a break.”\n\n“What about you?”\n\n“There’s a pint of Ben &amp; Jerry’s in the freezer.”          \n\nI think about it for a moment and ice cream seems like a poor substitute for pizza and beer, but to each his own. \n\nLynn must think I’m on the fence about leaving because she says, “We’ve been on a marathon study session. You need to refuel.”\n\nThis is just another example of why Lynn is my girl. I’ve been with her since my first year of college, and I’m still crazy about her. She grounds me, keeps me sane. I’m from Jersey while Lynn grew up in Manhattan. She’s three years older but seems about a decade wiser and a hell of a lot more worldly. \n\nI give her a kiss and our lips linger. I resist the first stirring of passion, knowing that if I let our make-out session go any further, I’ll be late for the fight. Josh would never forgive me.\n\n“Have fun, sweetie.”\n\nAfter a full day of being cooped up with medical textbooks, I definitely will.\n\nI snatch up my jacket and gloves, bracing myself for the biting December cold that awaits me outside the heated apartment. Lynn’s studio is in Astoria, Queens and you can see the Manhattan skyline in the distance while you wait for the train on the elevated subway platform. \n\nI, on the other hand, live in Briarwood — about half an hour deeper into the borough. The rents are lower in this working-class enclave of various ethnicities. My place is far from glamorous, but you can’t beat the square-footage return rate. \n\nMy brother lives in nearby Forest Hills, an upper-middle-class neighborhood and the home of Peter Parker (aka Spiderman) in the comics and movies. I’m a bit of a geek, so I’m a treasure trove of useful information. \n\nI catch the N train, transfer to the F and thirty minutes later I get off on 71st Avenue. As I walk down Austin Street, the main commercial strip, I pass my favorite pizza parlor. I go in and order a pie — sausage, pepperoni and ground beef. This is boys’ night out and if it didn’t bleed, it doesn’t belong on my pizza.\n\nAs they shove our pie into the steel oven, I head to the liquor store across the street and purchase a six-pack of Heineken. Before long I’m on my way again, pizza in tow, and the scent of mozzarella bubbling away in olive oil makes me salivate. \n\nI’m so looking forward to my evening of scholastic freedom. Beer. Pizza. MMA. Not a textbook in sight. Heaven on Earth. \n\nMy brother’s apartment building is located at the end of the street. A rusted fire escape mars the exterior. Sirens shriek a few blocks down. We may not be in Manhattan, but we’re still in New York. \n\nI ring the doorbell a few times, but no one answers. Weird. Josh is expecting me, so why isn’t he letting me in? After all, his guest brings booze and chow. Since Karen dumped him, my brother has been drinking too much. Did he pass out in front of the TV? He sounded pretty buzzed on the phone, but I dismiss this idea as soon as it pops into my head. Josh isn’t a lightweight and can definitely hold his liquor. Who knows why he isn’t answering the bell, but my arms are getting tired from carrying the pizza box and sixer of beer. \n\nI put the goodies down for a moment and decide to let myself in. I use the spare set of keys from the last time Josh asked me to apartment-sit while he was out of town. \n\nAs I enter the unit I shout, “Hey, what's going on? I rang the bell three goddamn times!”\n\nMy question goes unanswered, but I do catch a whiff of a burning scent and now I’m worried.        \n\n*Something’s wrong.* \n\n“Hey Josh, you here?” I ask.\n\nOnce again, there is no response. \n\nI head for the nearby kitchen nook and put the pizza down on the counter. My gaze travels to the adjoining living room. MMA fighters wrestle onscreen in glorious 4K and excited commentary resonates throughout the apartment.\n\n“Josh, what's up man? You get drunk and pass out?”\n\nThe continued silence is unnerving. As I make my way to the bedroom, the burning smell becomes more pungent.\n\n“JOSH?! YOU HERE?”\n\nStill no answer. Fuck it! I thrust open the door, and a nightmarish sight awaits me.\n\nThe bed is on fire. Flames lick the ceiling. Strangely, everything else in the room remains untouched by the conflagration.\n\nNo time to wonder why the blaze hasn’t spread, or why there isn’t any smoke billowing from the room. My mind is preoccupied with the search for a fire extinguisher. Each unit has one, and I recall seeing Josh’s near the entryway. I back away from the hungry flames, tear through the living room and locate the extinguisher. \n\nKeeping my distance from the burning bed, I aim the extinguisher. *How do you activate this thing?* \n\nMy fingers lock around the safety pin and pull. I squeeze the handles together and sweep the stream side to side. Foam engulfs the flames, suffocating them in seconds.\n\nThe smoke disperses more slowly. Scorched material hisses and crackles. I stare at a melted bedframe with a dark, ashen crater in the middle of it.\n\nThat’s when I spot the charred, smoldering body sprawled on the bed, clothing baked into the skin. The figure is barely identifiable as human. Yet when his eyelids snap open, I recognize the terror-stricken eyes looking up at me. It’s Josh! Oh my God, no...\n\nFor a horrific beat, I just stand there, paralyzed. \n\nJosh exhales a throaty gasp. Garbled sounds escape his mangled, scorched voice box. I can clearly make out one word... \n\n*Akasha.*\n\n**CHAPTER 2** \n\nI’m numb as I approach the Hunter College Brookdale Campus. Located on 25th Street, about half an hour from the college, it houses a limited number of the school’s 23,000 enrollees, mostly nursing and exchange students and members of the wrestling team. Most of the physical therapy classes are taught on the first floor of the campus, including anatomy. \n\nSnow cascades down in sheets, and I’m just one of many students streaming into the building with shoulders hunched against the merciless wind.\n\nAs I make my way into the auditorium, my mind is a million miles away. I keep thinking of my brother. \n\nOf the terror in his eyes. \n\nOf his final cryptic message.    \n\n*Akasha.*\n\nWhat was he talking about?\n\nA week has passed since that terrible day. I don’t even remember dialing 911. Everything is hazy, like a bad dream. But I do recall the fireman’s theory after they stretchered Josh’s disfigured body to a waiting ambulance. As the rear doors slammed shut, erasing my dying brother from view, he said, ”We found pot in the bedroom and empty beer bottles all over the house. Your brother may have passed out, dropped the roach and then the bedspread caught fire. By the time he knew what was happening, it was too late**.”** \n\nNo offense, but I call bullshit. I’m not buying it, not for a second. The bed’s iron frame was a warped mess. Steel melts at 2800 degrees. So how could a small fire generate such heat without spreading? And why didn't any of the goddamn fire alarms go off? \n\nI know what I saw isn’t possible. The cops are stumped too and it sure seems like they don’t care enough to probe further. \n\nAt least no one’s suggested suicide. It would break my mother’s heart. \n\nI’ve been checking on her every day, making sure she’s okay. She lost my father to a heart attack five years ago, but this feels even worse. No parent should ever bury one of their children – thank God she is a strong woman, a fighter.\n\nI keep telling myself that I’m a fighter too, but losing Josh has shaken me to the core. I still can’t believe he’s gone. For someone studying to become a health practitioner I should be more comfortable with the idea of mortality, but it’s always been an abstract concept. Death is something that happens to other people.\n\nNot anymore. The grim reaper has clawed its way into my life, too.\n\nI push the dark thoughts aside as I enter the classroom. Each table is surrounded by a group of four students. Everyone is wearing scrubs and disposable gloves. Covered by plastic shrouds, rows of human bodies lie on their stainless steel operating tables. The anticipation is palpable.\n\nWelcome to Surgery 203: ANATOMY. The class where we all get to dissect our first cadavers. Considering where my mind is, the timing couldn’t be worse. \n\nI spot Lynn and manage a weak smile. We’ve barely seen each other since Josh’s terrible accident. After snatching up my scrubs and some gloves, I join my girl. We kiss — just a peck. I barely say a word and she eyes me with concern. “Talk to me, babe, what’s going on in that big brain of yours?”\n\nI just shake my head, and she nods, like she understands. She squeezes my hand and it’s a reminder that a gesture speaks louder than words sometimes. \n\nOur anatomy teacher, Dr. Wallace, is a surly fellow in his mid-forties with a receding head of graying hair. He addresses the room. “Our first lesson will deal with how to open the dermal layers and penetrate the muscles underneath.”\n\nHe steps up to one of the bodies and pulls back the plastic shroud. His scalpel brushes against the dead man's neck. “You’ll make the initial incision, cutting from the jugular at the dip where the collarbone meets. Then down the sternum and along the lowest of the ribs...”\n\n*I can’t do this*, I think. *Not today. Maybe not ever.*\n\nLynn studies me while Wallace drones on. She knows that I’m not really present. She leans into me and whispers into my ear, “Do you think he gets turned on by the sound of his own voice?”\n\nDespite my somber mood, I shoot her a mock admonishing glance. “Behave now. If he hears you, you can kiss that “A” goodbye.”\n\n“He better not mess with me. I'm a bitch with a scalpel.” \n\nMy smile breaks through the dark thoughts weighing down on me. Lynn knows how to pull me out of myself. She’s been great through all this. \n\nOn stage, Dr. Wallace is studying the class. A hushed, reverent silence hangs in the air and even I am affected. We’re all about to take a giant step forward on the path to becoming medical practitioners. \n\nI peer down at the surgical tools arrayed beside the body. The idea of sinking a blade into the flesh of another human — even a dead one — seems surreal to me now. \n\n“Alright, any further questions?”\n\nThe classroom remains as silent as a chapel.\n\n“Good. Then let's begin.”\n\nLynn nods at me. I know I can do this and fight back the urge to leave. Can’t chicken out on my first day. I give myself an internal push and pull the shroud back, revealing the corpse of a young man. Mercifully, his features are hidden by a white silk stocking designed to preserve the anonymity of the cadaver. I guess it makes it easier to pretend that the body we’re desecrating isn’t quite human. \n\nLynn must sense my hesitation as she steps closer, scalpel in hand. “You think you're up for this?” she asks with growing concern.\n\nI try to make a joke of the whole affair, though my emotions are churning. “Ladies... I mean, bitches, first,“ I say.\n\nLynn seems reassured by my attempt at humor. She leans over the corpse like the badass she is and makes the first incision. The skin splits, revealing the fatty tissue. I want to avert my gaze, but can’t. \n\nDr. Wallace appears behind us and surveys Lynn’s progress with a critical eye. He’s one of the few instructors who truly relishes his job. Despite Lynn’s teasing comments, we know Wallace is a born, consummate teacher. His passion for the subject is infectious.\n\nI meet his gaze. Dr. Wallace is picking up on my hesitation. He’s aware that this next step can be challenging for people. Slicing up a fellow human being doesn’t come naturally to most of us. \n\nI ask the question that’s been foremost on my mind ever since Lynn pulled back the dead man’s shroud. \n\n“How did he die...?”\n\n“Brain aneurysm,” Dr. Wallace explains in a neutral tone. “Quite unusual for someone his age.”\n\nMore unusual than spontaneous combustion?\n\nI can’t stop looking at the body.\n\nI can’t stop thinking of Josh.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nWe make love that night. It’s been weeks — our studies have pretty much destroyed our sex life — so our passion is fierce and filled with need. We’re not just two people having sex or even lovers making up for lost time. We’re celebrating being alive.\n\nBreaking our normal pattern, we climax at the same time. This seems to happen in movies but not so much in the real world. Tonight is one of those rare occasions where life imitates art. I lay still for an erotic beat before rolling off Lynn’s lean yet shapely body. I try to catch my breath, and Lynn flashes me a big smile.       \n\n“We keep this up, I'll start smoking again.”\n\nWe share a grin. Our love feels as deep and real as our physical passion. Once again I wonder how I got so lucky to run into a gal like Lynn. \n\n“Wow, we haven't gone at it like that since our trip to Hawaii.”\n\nLynn grins and snuggles up to me. For a moment we just lie there, enjoying each other’s warmth.\n\n“You know, we're lucky...” Lynn begins, then pauses, choked up with emotion. She was raised by a single mother. The poor woman never dated again after her divorce. Lynn knows firsthand that life doesn’t owe you a lasting love. \n\nShe tries to downplay the deep feeling behind her words and continues, “I was thinking. Medical school is kicking our butts, we're both struggling to make ends meet...”\n\nI sense where this is headed.     \n\n“And we spend practically every night together, anyway...”\n\nI complete the thought, but my voice shows no enthusiasm or excitement. “You want to move in together?”\n\n“It would do wonders for our party budget.”\n\n“It's a pretty big step, don't you think?”\n\nI feel like I’m listening to a stranger who just happens to sound like me. I love Lynn. So why am I not more excited about what she’s suggesting?\n\nA flicker of disappointment crosses Lynn's face, and it breaks my heart. I just flunked a crucial test. It’s not the response she expected, but she’s a big girl and tries to play it off. \n\n“I’m sorry, I don’t even know why I brought it up — total chick move. You just lost your brother, and here I am trying to complicate your life…” \n\nI cut her off with a kiss. Any further discussion of moving in together is swept aside by our renewed passion.  \n \n\n**Chapter 3**\n\nMilky sunlight seeps into Lynn’s bedroom as I get dressed. My plan is simple — head to my brother’s place and snoop around. I want answers. Even though a week has passed, I can’t stop thinking that Josh was trying to tell me something before he died. \n\nLynn is barely awake, and I give her a quick peck on the cheek. “Gotta run,” I say. She’s back asleep by the time I’m out the door. It’s cold outside but in a good, refreshing way that wakes me up and clears my head. I grab a cup of steaming Dunkin Donuts’ coffee and catch the subway to Forest Hills. \n\nMy thoughts turn to the night before. What’s going on with me? Why is the idea of living with the woman I love freaking me out? I tell myself that seeing my brother dying in front of me might have something to do with my reluctance. Facing mortality makes me wonder what I really want from life.\n\nI’m twenty-four. Several of my friends have moved in with their significant others. Hell, a few have even gotten engaged or tied the knot. My hesitation when it comes to taking that next step isn’t a recent phenomenon. I know Lynn’s contemplated it before, but each time I avoided the issue. I’m not scared of relationships—heck, I’ve been in one for the last two years—but I do think I’m scared of a permanent relationship. \n\nThe final relationship. \n\nUntil death do us part, and all that jazz. I’m young and a part of me feels like I’m not quite ready to settle down. So if that’s the case, what am I doing wasting Lynn’s time? She’s ready, and she needs me to be ready. I don’t want to break up with Lynn, but making a permanent commitment feels like a door slamming shut on a world full of possibilities. It’s stupid and immature, but whoever said the male brain was wired in any other way. \n\nA half hour later I reach Josh’s apartment building. A harsh wind whips the snow-laden trees. The building now projects a sinister energy. A mausoleum tainted by a deadly tragedy. \n\nOnce again I let myself into my brother’s unit and survey my surroundings. As expected, the place is in disarray after the fire department and cops combed through the place. Furniture was shoved aside, chairs overturned.\n\nI move deeper into the living room. So far, so good. But this is the easy part. The hard part is stepping back into the bedroom where my brother died. There’s no getting around it. \n\nThere, a scene of surreal devastation awaits. I take in the melted clump of steel that was once Josh's bed. Everything happened so fast when I was here last. My memories are dominated by flames, billowing smoke and the devastating realization that my brother was at the center of the inferno. \n\nThis time I’m able to take a step back and observe my environment more carefully. A MacBook and reams of papers rest on Josh’s desk, untouched by the conflagration that day. \n\nI take note of a framed photograph of Josh and myself taken during a family camping trip in upstate New York. Our arms are slung around each other, and we’re grinning ear to ear. Memories of better times. \n\nNext I home in on a pin-up calendar mounted above the desk. “THE GIRLS OF HOOTERS.” \n\nAs I eye the pin-up girls in their bright orange short-shorts, something peculiar jumps out at me. The faces of the two Hooters girls on the page have been burned away. It’s almost as if someone stabbed out a cigar on the picture, erasing the models’ features. \n\n*Strange.*\n\nCuriosity piqued, I snatch the calendar from the wall and begin to flip through it. On every page I’m confronted with the same bizarre phenomenon. Every model’s face has been obliterated. \n\nI place the calendar back on the desk. One girl could be a coincidence, maybe a stray spark from the fire, but that doesn’t explain what I’m looking at. It lends weight to a dark suspicion that has taken root since my brother’s ruined vocal chords whispered Akasha’s name into my ear. \n\nPerhaps this wasn’t an accident. \n\nWhat if someone targeted my brother? \n\nIf the fire department had found gasoline or some other incendiary device at the scene, this theory might hold water. But according to their investigators, there was nothing suspicious about the scene. They were treating it like a cut-and-dried case. A tragic accident.\n\n*It doesn’t seem cut-and-dried to me.* \n\nI’m about to leave the bedroom when I hear footsteps behind me. I freeze, realizing I’m not alone any longer. The new arrival speaks, and I realize it’s Peter, Josh’s roommate. \n\nI turn toward Peter. He looks like a negative image of his former, chipper self. Unshaven, hair unkempt. I catch a whiff of B.O. He’s still grieving and dealing with what happened in his own way. Josh and Peter went to high school together and were always pretty tight. \n\nI lost a brother the other day. \n\nPeter lost his best friend. \n\n“I'm so sorry about Josh,” he says.\n\nI nod. Sometimes condolences can become an empty, if welcome formality, but clearly Peter’s words came straight from the heart.\n\n“Any idea what happened?”\n\n“I wish I knew. I don't even think the fire department knows.”\n\nPeter wraps his arms around himself and shuffles his feet. He shakes his head, as unable as I am to make sense of the horror that devastated his home. \n\n“I don’t get it,” he finally says. “I mean, how many people lose two of their closest friends in fires on the same weekend.”\n\nThe question lands like a punch and takes my breath away. “What are you talking about?”\n\nAt first Peter holds my gaze blankly, almost as if he didn’t hear me. Then he waves me over and indicates that I should follow him.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nWe sit in front of Peter’s open laptop and soon I’m watching a two-day-old newscast online. Blurry, low-res footage of a New York University resident building flashes onscreen. Half-dressed, shell-shocked kids shiver in the freezing night, surrounded by firefighters and cops.\n\nA photograph of a young man replaces the footage. I know this guy! He’s friends with Peter and my brother, but I can’t for the life of me remember his name right now. I think we met once at a NYU party, but I wouldn’t swear to it. \n\nThe voice of a news anchor jogs my memory. *“Tragedy struck NYU this morning when twenty-two-year-old grad student Steve Chebatoris was killed in a fire that broke out in his dorm room. Firefighters were able to contain the blaze before it spread to the rest of the building. Police are still investigating.”*\n\nA part of me tries to convince myself that it must be a coincidence, but deep down I know it’s bullshit. Something freaky is going on here. And I have a feeling my brother tried to provide me with the key to this mystery before he died.\n\n*Akasha.*\n\nI ask Peter the question that has haunted me for the last two days. “Any idea who Akasha is?”\n\nPeter turns chalk white, and my dread intensifies.\n\nHe has heard this name before. \n\nJudging by reaction, Akasha is bad news.\n\nWith trembling hands, Peter fishes out his cell from his pocket. Opens an app and holds the phone up at me. \n\n*What is he doing?* \n\nA moment later, I’m staring at the Tinder internet profile of a beautiful young woman. Judging from her photos, she can’t be older than nineteen. Striking, yet aloof, like some runway model posing for a gothic perfume ad. Her expression is forlorn and wistful with only a hint of a smile. Her cover page is a winter shot of a forest, the bare branches laden with fresh snow. \n\n“Akasha is someone Josh met on TINDER?” \n\nPeter nods, eye fixed into space.\n\nI scan the text below Akasha’s profile picture. Akasha is located within a 5-mile radius, the app informs me. In the “ABOUT ME” box it reads, “*Creative, fun, a mystery – 51% SAINT, 49% SINNER.”*\n\nCute.\n\nMy smile vanishes as I take in the next line. \n\n“*LOVE BURNS YOU WHEN IT’S HOT.”* \n\nThe words rattle me. Given what happened to Josh, and Steve, for that matter, Akasha’s blurb sounds a lot less poetic and intriguing than it would have a week ago.\n\nMy attention shifts back to Peter. I sense there is something he isn’t telling me. The silence between us stretches. My impatience grows.\n\nI fight the urge to shake Peter out of his weird stupor.\n\n*Talk to me, buddy…*\n\nI calm my nerves, take a step closer and stare right into Peter’s distant gaze.\n\n“What happened between Josh and Akasha?”\n\nPeter’s voice trembles as he speaks. “Both Josh and Steve were hooked on Internet dating. Their whole social life revolved around Tinder.”\n\nPeter shows me the app on his phone. “You don’t need some elaborate profile to get started. It pretty much boils down to animal attraction. If you find someone who strikes your fancy, you tap the heart icon. If she doesn’t do anything for you, you press the “X” and move on to the next potential prospect—”\n\n“I know how Tinder works,” I say tightly. Never used it but plenty of my friends do.\n\n“There’s something you're not telling me.”\n\nPeter chews his lips.\n\n“Josh was still upset over the way Karen dumped him. He was dating up a storm, hooking up with girls left and right on Tinder. He could sleep with them and ghost them.”\n\n*Ghosting. Ending a personal relationship by withdrawing from all communication.* \n\nThe term pretty much summed up Josh’s dating philosophy in the wake of his Karen-induced heartbreak. \n\n“This is going to sound pretty messed up, Josh and Steve had a bet going. They wanted to see who could score with her first.”\n\nI process this latest revelation. “Are you saying what I think you are?”\n\n“Both Josh and Steve hooked up with Akasha the same week they died in freak fires.”\n\n**End of Part 1**",

        "text": "No, mirrors are not a paranormal portal to a dark dimension. They're mirrors. They reflect light. The issue is when you think you're looking into a mirror that isn't really there.\n\nThe mirrors in your home? Probably fine.\n\nDirty mirrors with smudges on? Probably fine.\n\nMirror on a wall where you know what's on the other side? Definitely fine.\n\nBut if you see a clean mirror in public, on a wall that you can't get behind, stay away from it. Do not look at it. Do not look at the thing pretending to be you. That is not you.\n\nI can't say for certain who is orchestrating this, nor do I know why businesses and public bathrooms are agreeing to it. But more and more establishments are building identical bathrooms next to existing ones. I know this because I am one of the contractors who keeps being hired for this. I have built 3 bathrooms so far, each of which we were told to pay meticulous attention to detail and to build an exact mirror image of an existing bathroom.\n\nAt first, it didn't seem too strange. The places probably just needed space for more toilets - Perhaps they were getting a lot of customers. The first job was for a generic public restroom in my local town centre. The second job was in a restaurant a couple of miles away. The third was for the university of a neighbouring city. The fact that each of these separate and very different locations had the exact same request was unsettling, but it was money. Why wouldn't we accept?\n\nA few days into the third contract, I was in my local town centre, purchasing some supplies for the job. I needed to use the bathroom, so I made my way to the public ones. They're a little hidden through an alleyway, the type you definitely wouldn't use at night. When I got there, I noticed that the bathroom I had helped build was simply not there. They had filled the doorway back in with bricks and cement. It was as if it was never there.\n\nI figured they had realised that having 2 identical bathrooms was silly - They had probably got some people in the knock down the shared wall between them, to turn it into one larger bathroom facility. But, no. Once I was standing inside, it was the exact same size as before. The shared wall, the one with the mirror across, was still there. They had hardly even cleaned the place up, it was all as filthy as ever. All except for the mirror. The mirror was crystal clear.\n\nIt didn't make sense. This would indicate a terrible, terrible job had been done. However, we had been paid on time and didn't receive any complaints. As far as my team and I are aware, we did everything perfectly fine. I couldn't understand why they would hide it away. But it wasn't my job to understand - We got paid, and it's up to the client what they do with the work once we leave.\n\nWe collect 50% of the payment upfront, and the other 50% when completed. Once we were done with the third contract, we had to chase up with the restaurant. They still had not paid us the second half and hadn't even been in contact to tell us why. I made my way down the same day we completed the university bathroom. The restaurant wasn't too busy, as it's not a very popular place. I had been surprised when they needed double the bathroom capacity.\n\nAs I made my way up to the counter, I noticed that the new restroom we had built was not labelled as such. The door was still there - They had not hidden it like the public restroom - But a sign on it read \"Supply Closet. Staff Only.\" Nobody was at the counter yet. No staff were in sight, just 2 customers who weren't even paying me any attention. So, I pushed the door gently open, and...it was not a supply closet. It was the bathroom we had built.\n\nI stepped in slowly. Something about the whole situation felt odd. This was the second place trying to hide our work. As I stepped into the centre of the room and looked towards the mirror, I noticed no reflection. I stepped slowly towards the sinks and stood in front of them, staring. It was as if I was waiting to see myself. But I wasn't there.\n\nI reached out, and my hand went right through. There was no mirror here at all, this was a cutout into the main bathroom. I climbed through, into the original bathroom, and stood facing away from the \"mirror\". My only explanation was, again, perhaps that they decided the knock down the shared wall to simply expand the room. I figured they must only be halfway finished. This explanation was short-lived as I turned back around, and saw my reflection looking back at me.\n\nBy this point, confused was an understatement. I wasn't scared, either. I was unsettled, but more than anything I just didn't understand what was going on. I reached out, and sure enough, my hand met my reflection. At this point, I began to wonder whether the mirror was slide-away for any reason, like a secret passage between the rooms. That was until I realised my hand hadn't felt the cold touch of a mirror's surface, but the warm and soft feeling of another person's hand. My face dropped. My eyes glazed over with fear. I don't know how terrified I looked, because my reflection had stopped copying me. He smiled.\n\nHis hand clasped around mine as I tried to pull away. Our fingers were interlocked, as he began to slowly climb through. I truly think I'd have been done for, had it not been for the door swinging open at that point.\n\n\"Oh hey, I thought I saw you come in! You're here because we didn't pay you the other half, right?\"\n\nMy reflection returned to normal, and I backed away from the mirror. My heart was beating out of my chest, and I couldn't take my gaze off myself.\n\n\"You like the mirror?\"\n\nI was able to look at him as he continued to speak to me.\n\n\"We didn't want the new bathroom, I can't really get into details about why we got it. We were forced to and threatened by a third party. They even gave us the money to pay you - Maybe it's some legal loophole for them to get a tax write-off somehow, I won't pretend to understand it.\"\n\nI was able to find words somewhere in my head, \"So, you have the money?\"\n\n\"Well, that's the thing. We were already in debt, business hasn't been great. We've spent it all. But we will get you the money, I promise.\"\n\n\"It's okay, keep it.\"\n\nI walked out of there without turning back, despite being pretty sure I could hear the manager shouting me.\n\nI do not believe these things in the mirrors to be human. I don't know how, I don't know why, but someone is trying extremely hard to allow these to mimic us without being noticed. Right there, in front of your eyes, something pretending to be you, and you wouldn't even bat an eye. For whatever reason, it is important that they be allowed to copy people, and this is the best that they could come up with.\n\nSo next time you find yourself in front of a spotlessly clean mirror, don't touch it.\n\nThey don't like to be noticed.\n\n[===](https://www.reddit.com/r/BriteWrites)",

DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, INVESTIGATE.** It's the dog eating dinner leftovers, if you go down he will 9 out of 10 times devour you in an attempt to protect his food, he doesn't like visitors. Otherwise.. Nevermind, it's best if I dont go into detail.\n\nRule #2 -\n\nMake sure you only use the restroom between 8-10pm. After this time period, you are at high risk of encountering **them.**\n\nRule #3 -\n\nBe polite to mother, elbows off the table, please and thank you, wait for everyone to get their food before eating and just be well mannered. Father is a snitch, he is too scared of **them** to keep any secrets, if you break any rules and **they** do not notice, he will tell **them**.\n\nRule #4 -\n\nAct natural, don't let yourself be on edge. If you encounter **them**, even if it feels like you can't breathe from the terrifying feeling **they** give, **do not let it show**. If you fail to do this, refer to **rule #10.**\n\nRule #5 -\n\nIf we are playing and you notice my eyes have turned to the ceiling while the rest of my body continues playing with you, act like you saw nothing. Keep playing. **They** do not like when **their** victims are watched during a conversation. I am talking to **them** and if I am interrupted both you and I will be tortured until **they** feel we've learned our lesson.\n\nRule #6 -\n\nIf mother comes into our room at night, ignore her. If she hovers above you do not let it scare you, and no matter what, do not make eye contact. That is not mother.\n\nRule #7 -\n\nRefer to father as sir and mother as ma'am. If you are forced to talk to **them** refer to them as whatever gender the creature looks to be, if you guess wrong, it's over. You must start again.\n\nRule #8 - \n\nFather will enforce the rules, do everything he says and follow the rules, he won't bother you.\n\nRule 9# -\n\nI have not introduced sister yet. She is the favourite of both **them** and Mother and Father. The rules apply to her but in a mild way, she is given 3 chances with each rule. In a way, she's the biggest threat, she doesn't mind getting herself in trouble if it harms you as she can get away, you cannot.\n\nRule 10# -\n\nIf you have completed the sleepover, or you've been caught breaking the rules, at exactly 8:07 you must run, you have exactly one right, two lefts and three forward. It's up to you to understand the way this works. If you completed the sleepover successfully, only mother will chase you. She is slow and isn't able to maintain a good pace, run your fastest at the start as she will slow down afterwards. If you've been caught breaking the rules, **they** will chase after you. You must run your fastest at all times, if you are caught, you must start the household of hell challenge again.\n\nThere's all the rules done, if you're wondering why I haven't escaped, I am unable to run away. I was diagnosed with Hemiplegia just before I was sent here. **They** thought I was perfect for **their** world as I could never escape. I have tried over 8732 times to escape. It's not possible with my condition, so please, save yourself.",

        "text": "I was never one for socializing. Even as a child, I preferred to keep to myself, lost in my own world of books and movies. As I got older, my introversion turned into something more sinister: social anxiety.\n\nI couldn't handle being around people. Every time I had to leave the house, my heart would start pounding, my palms would get sweaty, and I would feel like I was about to vomit. I couldn't make eye contact with anyone, couldn't hold a conversation. It was like I was trapped in my own body, a prisoner to my own fears.\n\nCollege was no different. I tried to make friends, but every time I went to a party or a social gathering, I would end up hiding in a corner, trying to blend in with the wallpaper. The more I tried to force myself to be social, the worse my anxiety got.\n\nAnd then, things started to happen in my apartment. At first, it was small things, like objects moving on their own, or strange noises coming from the walls. But as time went on, it became more sinister.\n\nI started seeing things out of the corner of my eye, shadowy figures darting around the edges of my vision. Every time I walked into a room, I could feel a presence watching me, lurking just out of sight. And every night, I would wake up to find my bedroom door open, even though I always made sure to lock it before going to bed.\n\nI knew something was wrong, but I didn't want to tell anyone. I was afraid they would think I was crazy, that they would judge me or laugh at me behind my back. So I kept it to myself, and the thing in my apartment grew stronger.\n\nMy anxiety reached a fever pitch. I could barely leave my apartment, could barely function. And the thing in the shadows only made it worse. Every time I walked into a room, I could feel its eyes on me, boring into me like a drill. I could feel its breath on the back of my neck, its cold fingers trailing down my spine.\n\nI started to feel like I was going insane. I couldn't tell what was real and what wasn't. I would see things that couldn't possibly be there, hear voices that weren't really speaking. And the thing in the shadows, it was always there, watching me, waiting for me to slip up.\n\nOne night, I couldn't take it anymore. I was sitting in my room, the walls closing in on me, the thing in the shadows watching me. I felt like I was suffocating, like I was trapped in a nightmare that I couldn't wake up from.\n\nAnd then, something snapped. I grabbed a knife from my kitchen and started tearing apart my room, slashing at the walls, the furniture, anything I could get my hands on.\n\nWhen I was done, I collapsed onto the floor, panting and covered in sweat. And that's when I saw it. The thing in the shadows, standing in the corner of my room, watching me with its glowing eyes.\n\nI don't remember what happened after that. All I know is that I woke up in a hospital bed, my arms and legs restrained. The doctors told me I had a psychotic break, that I had attacked someone in a fit of delusion.\n\nBut I know the truth. The thing in the shadows, it's still out there, watching me. Waiting for me to slip up again. And I don't know how much longer I can hold on.\n\nSo if you're reading this, please, heed my warning. Don't let your fears and anxieties consume you. Don't let the shadows take hold. Because once they do, there's no going back.",

        "text": "I'm enlisted in the Ipsilon armed forces. After Ipsilon overthrew the United States government In 2030 ish, all existing security got promoted to ORCs or Outbreak and Riot Control. While I'm not old enough to have been on the original security team I was promoted into ORCs recently. My job currently is civilian transport. I'm heading out to a general populace bunker out in Montana, normally a transport from a closer city would deal with it however Montana was hit pretty hard during the takeover and is still considered a dead zone. I was driving an Ipsilon truck with a personnel transport module attached, basically like a semi truck with a camper fixed to the back instead of a trailer. The windshield was armored with camera feed from the outside displayed on the inside, to the driver it wouldn't look any different from driving a normal vehicle. I would've been able to see outside perfectly fine if not for this dam dust storm kicking up sand everywhere, thanks to the dead zone the storm also had a sickly green hue. I could still navigate down the highway thanks to the navigation system installed in the truck. My partner had spoken up to say\n'I'll deal with the checkpoint up ahead.\" He was a pathfinder, basically he had replaced everything but his brain with cybernetics. Pathfinders often aren't what they are by choice, many pathfinders faced illness or severe injuries and were on death's door before getting such a prosthetic. The exact process I have no clue as I'm proud to say I'm unmodified. I simply gave my partner a nod in response to his statement. I kept driving until the checkpoint came into view, since I could barely see anything ahead I pretty much had to slam on the brakes the second I saw it.  \"Smooth\" my partner had said before stepping out into the storm. Him and another man with rotten looking skin stood in front of the truck, just as my partner had pulled out money to pay the toll the mutant he had been talking with was shot in the head. The mutant fell on the spot, they may be some tough mother fuckers but some lead in the heads enough to drop most people still. I watched a long blade deploy from either of my partners forearms, he dropped to a lower, wider stance and the edges of the blades lit up a vibrant blue. Out from behind some debris stepped who I assumed to be responsible for that mutant's death. The man raised a modified repertor to his face, I realized as they did so that they were an oxy junky. The junky drew a long sword with a similar blue edge to my partner's blades. The junky dashed at impossible speeds towards my partner, his sword met my partner's blades. Nearly the second their blades met the junky had reared back his leg and kicked my partner, he was thrown back into the grill of the truck and went limp. I knew I had to do something. I dramatically threw open the driver side door and jumped out. Instantly the junky turned his attention to me, not even a second after I'd stepped out the man was lunging at me sword level with my head. Adrenaline kicked in and I stepped out of the way. I watched as the momentum of his attack carried him to the ground, and got an idea. I stood in front of the driver side door, I closed it as the man composed himself. I stood there like a red flag held before a charging bull. The man lunged again, I'd barely processed that he began his attack before his wrist was in my hand. I dropped to the ground letting my full weight pull his wrist. He tripped over my crouched form kicking me hard in the side in the process, then I heard a thump behind me. I jumped back from the truck turning to see the man. He sat upside down his full weight resting on his neck which was twisted in a grotesque manner. There was a dent in the driver side door now. As the adrenalin began to to wear off I fully realized what I just did and all I was able to do was stand there as I stammered \"OH SHIT!\" I then remembered my partner, I raced around to the front of the vehicle. I found my partner on the ground in front of the dented truck grill, I could see a hole in his front plate carrier. The scorch marks surrounding the hole made me quite grateful I hadn't been hit by that lunatic. My partner jolted up, his yellow glowing eyes blinking back to life. \"Mother fucker has a hell of a kick.\" He said bluntly. \"I thought you were dead, you have a goddamn hole in your gut!\" I blurted out. Following my remark one of his yellow eyes narrowed and he tilted his head looking puzzled, \"All my life support systems are located in my chest.\" I didn't know a pathfinders life support took up such little space, all I could muster in response was a slightly embarrassed \"Oh\". My partner climbed to his feet, looking around as he had done so. \"What happened to the junky, …and what happened to your ear?\" That last bit he had said pointing at my left ear, \"Wait, what's wrong with my ear?\" I asked as I raised a hand to feel my ear. I didn't feel my ear, As I pulled my hand away I saw my fingertips now were coated in crimson. \"Fuck me!\" I said annoyed, part for the fact that I'M MISSING MY DAMN EAR and part for the fact that it turns out I indeed did not manage to dodge that junkie's first attack. I placed my hand back over my ear as I explained \"So uh… the junky is dead.\" I motioned for him to follow me as I stepped around the front of the truck to the driver side door. My partner rounded to front of the truck and saw the junky propped up on his broken neck \"You did this?\" Without waiting for an answer my partner began again \"Gotta give you props rookie, most unmodded woulda been toast.\" With that he tossed the junkie's body a few feet from the truck and got into the driver's seat \"You got shotgun.\" Before I could protest the door was shut. I got in the passenger seat, as I relaxed a bit I felt the adrenaline fully wear off and suddenly felt like shit. I felt nauseous and my lungs stung from standing outside in the dead zone, my side where I'd been kicked didn't feel much better and my entire headache from the slash across the side of my head. I began feeling light headed and nearly passed out in the seat. \"Looking a little pale there, you good rookie?\" \"I'm fi–\" I got halfway through my reply and then everything went black. Next thing I remember is waking up in the infirmary back in the city. A nurse that was standing over me noticed I woke up \"Oh good you've woken up, you had us all worried for a while there.\" I sat up \"H-How long was I out for?\" The nurse motioned for me to lay back down \" Brian said you fought off an attack from someone on oxy in a dead zone and then blacked out since, which would make about 39 hours you've been unconscious.\" She handed me a pill and set a glass of water on a table connected to the bed. \"Mutation blockers, it'll put your cells on high alert for mutations, though some perfectly healthy cells may be affected so if you may begin to feel a bit weaker.\" \"Thanks\" I had said. I spent most of my medical leave recounting my first job here so I'm going to be back in the field soon. If you have any questions regarding my job as an ORC soldier go ahead and ask and I'll try and cover that topic in a future post.",

So there, under a large and old oak, it will sit, being slowly decomposed until it’s warnings will be heeded no longer. \r\n\r\nPart One\r\n\r\nAs the title says, I’ve been walking for three days, non-stop. I never get tired, but my body feels like it’s rotting away. I don’t remember how it all started. I came to in a long hallway, already walking and I don’t remember how or why I am walking, but I’m not able to stop. I’ve seen some strange things while I have been walking however, and I write this as a journal, a testament to what I have seen. Something greater than myself is pushing me to continue walking, heed my warnings for I may have found the answer.\r\n\r\nDay One, Part One: Awake, but not alive.\r\n\r\nI opened my eyes and see nothing. Darkness fills my eyes where light once hit. I am walking and upright. My souls drives my body somewhere. I don’t know where it it taking me, or why I’m going, but my souls is persistent in its dedication to continue walking. I was confused and I stuck my arms out in front of me to find something, but my attempt to feel was in vain. My cloths had changed. I remember it. I can remember what I wore before I ended up here, but I know something changed. It felt as though I was wearing a robe and my feet were bare. I could feel my feet were worn and cut and I feel as though I’ve been walking for days already and I just can’t seem to remember. I turn my head to the left and squinted as hard I could to try to get some light at all into my retinas, but there was truly nothing there. \r\n\r\nI turned my entire body to the right, going against the force that seemed to drive me forward and began walking in that direction. My soul was screaming at me to continue on my original path, but I didn’t listen. I could hear it screaming in my ears, and the further I veered myself off of its path, the older it seemed to prevail. It was almost speaking to me, and I felt as if I could make out words. My ears were burning from its screams when a sudden “STOP” erupted from darkness, and I stopped. I felt down at the ground to see what I could fell, yet I felt nothing. I was standing before a drop, although I couldn’t tell you how far it was, but I was standing right before it. I looked up and noticed something. Light, it looked like a singular star. It was stationary in the sky. It wasn’t enough to see, but seeing anything made me feel at ease. My soul was still screaming at me to continue the path, but I headed something down off of the cliff. A gentle hum. It was so quite that I nearly dismissed it as my own mind playing tricks, but it was there. I cupped my ear and brought myself down. I hung my head over the cliff and listened. The hum was  changing in pitch rhythmically. 12/8 time. It almost sounded like a double bass playing a deep tune. \r\n\r\nMy souls screamed at its loudest now, my head was throbbing in pain and I backed away. And walked until my souls screamed no longer. I turned and walked it’s path, my souls now in control again, pushing me to a destination which I still don’t know, even as I write this.",

        "text": "*28/12/2020*\n\nIt's almost time, my mother has told me to begin writing a diary. So that I shall do, nothing special today but don't fear. Something terrible will happen soon.\n\n*29/12/2020*\n\nSame as yesterday, what a bore.\n\n*30/12/2020*\n\nI'm beginning to lose control, it'll be time soon. Calm yourself.\n\n*31/12/2020*\n\nIt's like being at the edge of a cliff. Any moment now, everything will fall.\n\n*01/01/2021*\n\nI entered my fathers room early in the morning, armed with a kitchen knife. I began to carve the following into his stomach 'The end comes closer, for you have sinned.' The thrill I got from this deed made all the waiting worthwhile. After I completed stage 1, I cut off all fathers communications. Mother was not to know about this. Oh I must have forgotten to mention, mother is celebrating the new year with the family. Father and her had a big fight about this, of course a part of this was my doing, Father cannot say no to his dear daughter. Which is one of his grave sins. How foolish.\n\n*02/01/2021*\n\nFather begins to suspect an intruder was the cause of yesterdays events, of course I am the cause of these suspicions but I'll stay quiet until the final day. He begins attempting to get help, this is not possible, strangely enough and I manage to coerce him out of doing so. I allow his wounds to close up, to show some pity as in short time he will be gone, forever. As expected, he follows his pattern. At 21:05 he requests a black coffee. Something must have been put into this coffee, as shortly after he ingests this coffee, he is suddenly lying unconsciously on the couch. I dragged his body to my room, pushed the dresser aside and threw him in there. Oh, what is 'there'? What an unnecessary question but I shall answer, **hell.** Putting that aside, I tied him up just as he tied me down when I was an infant before he brut-, oh sorry that must've slipped out by mistake! **My father is evil.** What is coming over me today?. I pushed the dresser back into place and made sure to screw the vent back on. As I slept in the peace I had been craving since I witnessed all of my fathers sins, I began to plan how I would explain to mother what had happened. I would tell her that I woke up to a loud noise and went to my fathers bedroom to see blood on the sheets and him missing, and would say all of this with a terrified expression. **It was a horrific experience knowing you, father.**\n\n*03/01/2021*\n\nMy writing days will now come to an end, as I am the only person deserving of the details to the torture I will put my father through for the next decade.\n\n*01/01/2023*\n\nI know I said my writing days were over, but just wanted to say. Mother, when you find this, know that he was deserving of what happened, I no longer wish to own him anymore, I have not fed him since last November. It's likely you do not want to see what lays behind that dresser. And I know you'll be snooping in my room so I made sure to leave this out for you, satisfied? Mommy? As you are reading this, if you walk downstairs you will find my hanging from the ceiling, what a thrill!",

        "text": "*11/16/22*\n\nMarie thinks I should try to keep a diary. So: Hello dear diary. I don't know what to write, not much happened today.\n\n*12/19/22*\n\nThe diary does not work so well. I'll try to think remember more often. Today the mailman just threw my mail on the floor because the box was full. Stupid asshole. That's all that happened.\n\n*12/26/22*\n\nI found a bitten burger in my kitchen today. I don't remember buying it or why I should have left it after one bite. Nothing indicates that anyone was in the apartment. Nothing is missing, the locks are fine. I briefly thought about calling the police, but then I thought about how I would probably react in their situation. It's disturbing, but what should I do now? Maybe I should go see a doctor.\n\nThrew the burger away.\n\n*12/28/22*\n\nThis morning there was a bird stuck INSIDE my living room window. Right in the middle of it! Looked like it flew through and got stuck. I've never seen anything like it. It was up to its neck in the splintered window, dead. I don't know how this is possible, shouldn't they just break their necks when they fly into a window?\n\n*01/01/23*\n\nJesper gave me a clock. I don't know how he got the idea, there was no reason. But he suddenly stood in front of my door and handed me the package, smiling with joy. He insisted that I hang it in the kitchen above the door.\n\nUgly thing.\n\nWhen I asked him why he gave me this clock he shrugged his shoulders and said he just had to think of me when he saw it.\n\nStrange day.\n\n*01/02/23*\n\nMy bathtub has a crack in it. It stretches from the drain to the edge. Is this caused by temperature fluctuations? It has been mild late summer weather here for weeks. Dr. Kline says not to read anything into everything and not to worry so much. Annoying anyway. \n\n*01/03/23*\n\nNothing special happens today. I don't like the watch. I think I'll take it off again.\n\n*01/04/23*\n\nOkay Jesper just called me and told me to put the clock back up. What?! When I asked him how he knew that I had taken it down, he said he had seen it by chance through my window.\n\nI live on the third floor.\n\nHe hung up. The clock is now in the trash, with the burger.\n\n*01/05/23*\n\nThe carpet in my living room was rolled up. It wasn't me! Again, no one in the apartment. I think I'm going crazy. Have an appointment with Dr. Kline tomorrow, I think the pills would be useful after all. Or an MRI.\n\nHardly got to roll it out again, as if it was encrusted.\n\n*01/07/23*\n\nThe emergency scan was unremarkable. Dr. Kline says a psychologist could probably help me better. I don't go to him anymore.\n\nBy the way, the bathtub now has several cracks. The landlord is just putting me off. Things aren't going so well at work either.\n\nI think this diary thing is useless.\n\n*01/09/23*\n\nI took the garbage out a few days ago. When I got home from work, the fucking rotting burger was on my kitchen table. ON THE CLOCK. Called Jesper and yelled at him, I mean who else could it have been? I don't know how he got in, maybe he copied my key.\n\nHe said he doesn't know what I'm talking about and doesn't want to get yelled at for a gift. I think he's offended, but screw him.\n\nIt's both back in the trash.\n\n*01/10/23*\n\nThe tape on the hole in my window came off. You'd have to **scrape** it off, it doesn't come off that easily. I really don't know what's going on here anymore. I think I really need to see a head doctor.\n\nThe parts of my bathtub somehow keep coming apart. I don't want to look into the cracks, I think there's mold underneath or something.\n\nThe landlord says I have to pay for a new lock myself.\n\n*01/11/23*\n\nThe whole day I got the feeling someone is watching me. I sat down in the corner of the living room. Of course, no one is watching me. But after the clock just hung in the kitchen again when I woke up, I no longer feel safe here. Marie also thinks I should talk to someone. I am already on the waiting list.\n\nThere are critters coming out of the bathtub. Looks like silverfish or something, no idea what it is. The landlord says someone will come next week.\n\nI let the clock hang now.\n\n*01/12/23*\n\nIt's not funny anymore, I want to get out of the apartment. When I came home my carpet was lying upside down and a tuft of hair was lying on it. Could have been mine, don't know. I immediately went downstairs and called the police.\n\nThey say they can't do anything, I don't have any suspects and nothing was stolen. I honestly don't think Jasper did it either. They think I should change my lock, but I don't have the money for that.\n\n*01/15/23*\n\nI've been staying at Marie's for three days now, but I think it's time I went home. She calmed me down a lot. Tomorrow I have to be there anyway, then the craftsmen come because of the bathtub.\n\n*01/16/23*\n\nThere is some kind of nest in my bathroom. They said I should first call an exterminator or something and left again. Fucking shit. I don't want to get on Marie's nerves again. I'm going downstairs to Mr. Keller's kiosk to use the bathroom.\n\nThe landlord does not answer, I'll try again tomorrow.\n\n*01/17/23*\n\nInstead of helping me, my landlord is now threatening me with eviction. Because of the bathroom and the window and he says something is dripping from the ceiling in the apartment below me. I can't do this anymore. By the way, I now have another broken window.\n\n*01/20/23*\n\nI haven't opened the bathroom for two days. The landlord refuses to pay an exterminator and I can not afford one. I don't know what to do. There's some stuff coming through the wall between the bathroom and my bedroom. I pushed the bed away after it dripped on my face.\n\nMarie says I should get out of there right away. Jasper doesn't talk to me anymore.\n\n*02/03/23*\n\nSorry for the radio silence. I've been with Marie for two weeks now. We got my stuff out of the apartment last week. No idea what it is but most of it was rotten. My ex-landlord is threatening to sue. Asshole, like it's my fault.\n\nLeft the clock hanging there.\n\n*02/04/23*\n\nThis morning a bird woke me up by flying into Marie's guest room window. I still don't have an appointment with a psychologist.\n\n*02/07/23*\n\nMarie didn't come home today. Doesn't answer the phone either. Found the fucking clock in front of the door.\n\n*02/21/23*\n\nFound this crappy diary down here. I'm in the basement and can't get out. I don't know what's up there but it's all over the house. Dripping more and more from the ceiling. I keep hearing shattering glass and the dull sound of something hitting a window. I don't know where Marie is. I don't know why no one is coming. After the sink burst in Marie's bathroom, I wanted to leave, but I didn't know where to go. The police wouldn't help me with Marie either.\n\nThere is no signal down here for some reason. I'm scared. I don't know what I'm being punished for.\n\n*??/??/??*\n\nIt's nice down here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n—\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHey guys, I found this diary in the basement and transcripted it for you. There’s no trace of Mika. The police don't know how to help me. I don't know what Mika is describing, my house is fine and I’ve seen and talked to her the past couple days and weeks. She was acting weird though. Maybe someone of you has an idea what I should do now. Mika is unstable and missing, but unfortunately she is an adult, so I can't report her as missing.\n\nI'll get back to you after I fix the stupid window.",

        "text": "In the pines of Canada you can't see much of what's above you, you can only see the behemoths of trunks and thin clumps of needles stretching for miles; as for hearing - you can hear every sound that is made in the forest, no matter how loud the sound - or how big the forest. At night all you see is the hands infront of your face and the repeating cylinders of trees that stretch up into a limitless abyss of sky - an abyss that changes from the daytime chirps and buzz of forest life, an abyss that if you stare at for too long - will stare back.\n\nOften you will find yourself taking walks through the pines to clear your head, and night is the best time; nothing but you, your thoughts, and the pines. This man was doing just that - his guilt was choking his mind, and so he and his dog took a late night stroll: out the cabin, and into the pines - he had no need to turn the lights off, he knew he wouldn't be long; The abyss that stole the sky seemed to suck away all but the long standing trees, trees that had never once been disturbed by any man, animal or beast. \n\nHis footsteps weaved between the natural giants, treading the path he had once trod with his father - and his father before that, for this path was an old family trail, and he knew what lay upon it. His dog - a hunkering old St Bernard, padded a few steps ahead of him, sniffing the fresh air and scouting the trees. It was on this footrail where his dog stopped - understandable to anyone but this man, as his dog was as much of a hiker as he was; and had never once questioned anything on this night-time walk that was becoming all to ordinary nowadays. \n\nWhen he caught up with the dog, his face lost all colour. His dog was frozen, a gaunt expression overtook its face and in a way of an otherworldly possession, it stared up into the abyss - making no sounds but a heavy pant, a pant that sounded as if it was struggling to cope with a heavy weight: a weight like a boulder. He followed his dogs gaze to the unseen sky - the needles and brances that couldn't be seen; but he saw nothing.\n\nAt first, he attempted to entice his dog up the road, then he tried to pull it, the he tried leaving it and waiting for it to follow - but still it stayed at the foot of one of the great pines: the same haunted expression on its face, the same heavy pant. Again he looked up and saw nothing but the same blackout - and then his dog moved; his dog moved faster than he had ever seen... to the foot of another tree. This time; the pant turned to a wimper, then a bellowing bark, then a screaming jolt back along the path to the dim light of the cabin. The man felt no need to follow, he knew his dog was well trained - what he didn't know was what scared the brute into squealing like a pig. \n\nStaying still as a stone, the man listened and watched for any telltale sign of the abyss dwelling devil, but he got nothing. After 10 minutes he was ready to give up and walk back, filling his own mind with lies and deceit on possible causes for his dogs fright.\n\ndrip, drip, drip\n\nHe felt the rain start to drizzle on his hair and started to stand up from his resting spot.\n\ndrip, drip, drip\n\nuntil it fell on his neck; rain wasn't warm.\n\ndrip, drip, drip\n\nand rain wasnt red.\n\nthump.\n\nThe body of the St Bernard fell from the trees hard. Its fur was stained red and its body was mangled; each and every bone seemed to stick out of its grizzled fur.\n\nThe man scrambled towards the cabin; its dull glow echoing through the void of the night, he didn't even look up to see what had killed his dog, he didn't need to - because it was right infront of him.\n\nIt's feet were prehensile, possessing both toes and a thumb. Its legs were large and buckling - ready to kick. Its body was shaggy and great - the size of an average man - though its arms were greater, covered in blood and gore, great enough to crush a man with a single hit. It's face was that of a monkey, however it was mad - enraged and full of adrenaline, its eyes were firey and satanic, staring daggers into the man. Its mouth was a gaping maw of canines, its tounge forked like a serpent - a mouth that let out a bloodcurdling screech that removed this man from his paralysis, and caused him to flee - making him stumble off the trail and into the woods, not daring to look back at that thing that was causing the ground beneath him to shake - that thing that filled the stale night air with shredding, evil screeches; that thing that just lacerated his back with its claws. Still, he kept running, clenching his teeth with pain, pain that distracted him of the lack of thumping, the lack of screeching, the lack of chasing.\n\nHe reached a point of exhaustion after running and bleeding that he had to stop in his tracks. He looked around at the trees and abyss of the night and saw nothing; he kidded himself, saying things like \"I must have outrun it\" and \"It must have lost me in the wood\" until...\n\nrussle, russle, drip, drip, drip.\n\nHis own blood trickled from the shaking brances above him. He took one final look up at the abyss - and it stared back; not with eyes, but with the face of a snarling, wicked, half monkey/half dæmon that splayed its fangs as it jumped down from the high pines: And as it let out yet another macabre yowl, he let out his final scream.",

        "text": "  \n\n\nPerhaps you’ve read my previous post. It was all I could do, you must understand. To publish her letters even anonymously is such a risk even now. I was afraid, I was ashamed, and I was determined to survive. I am safer now, but the time has not yet come for you to know me. Instead, I wish to tell you a bit more of the place Annie related to her Alexander in those nearly forgotten letters.\n\nDroughton Hill was no safe haven for lost children. It wore the guise, the skin of a home, but nothing more. The nannies took but a few nights to learn its true nature, and by that time they had no choice. The children, for the most part, knew no better. And if they did, what could they have done for it? Who would hear them if they complained? It would do them no worse to scream their injustice into the frozen mountains. Believe me, they did. \n\nBut there was some hope for those lost souls, trapped somewhere so inexplicably horrible. There was some relief to be found. Here is another of the letters I have found or kept from Draughton Hill.\n\n\\-C\n\nNellie, if you read this, know that I am glad you escaped. When you first arrived at the lodge, I knew you would be special. In your interviews, you told us that you wanted to be a light in a dark world. You wanted to bring joy to children who knew so little of it. It was that defiance, that determination, that caught my attention.\n\nAfter your first night, I was sure. The others before you had been so uninteresting. They would simply bark their orders, and lock the hatch at bed time. They hid their fear behind their rigid exterior. But you were different.\n\n“Hello, loves,” You had said that first night, before your introduction. “I hope to know each of your names some time soon. Until then, you may know mine. I am Mrs. Pembrooke. Anyone who greets me by it tomorrow will get one piece of candy. Sleep well, I will see you all tomorrow!” It was such a pleasant introduction. I’m sure I haven’t related it perfectly in writing. You had clearly rehearsed it, always the overachiever. If only you could have read the hundred little eyes which peered at you from behind their blankets. You would not have wanted to know their names then, and you would not have promised to see them in the morning.\n\nBut during their nightly test, you too were tested by the knowledge of it. “What is that thing?” you asked, your hand covering your mouth. The screen seemed to burn you with its grainy picture as you observed. “We’ve got to…” And then I watched you notice. I watched you put the pieces together. The strict schedule, the precautionary measures, the door. “You knew this would happen?” And you looked right at me, right through the lens. It was beautiful. \n\nI saw the way you scrambled to the corridor, fire extinguisher in hand. Did you intend to spray it? That might have worked for a moment, but only that much. Of course, the corridor would have the same time-locked door which barred the sleeping quarters. The entire facility outside of your observation quarters would be inaccessible to you. I watched you bash the window, shouting, cursing. You became very unlike yourself, Nellie, but all the more wonderful for it. It didn't take you long to realize our intentions. You were there to watch. And so you did, lulled into a false sense of security by its regularity. The abominable thing made its brisk march around and around, shifting between a crawl and a stumble, but never changing its pace.\n\nNone were harmed that night, and so you watched it. You did not yet know the severity of its game, the gravity of its consequences. You watched the sun trickle through the window, heard through the walls what force shut the door as the creature left. And there were still several hours until morning for the children. You watched how some got up, a few cried, you must have noticed how many of them simply rolled over and went to sleep. \n\nNone of them knew your name that morning, which didn’t surprise you or I. But all the same, you surprised me. You chose to smile, to be kind to them. When the other nannies came, their watchful eyes must have warned you. You did not bother them with questions. I was truly captivated by you. You were so perceptive, so contained, and yet so kind. During their lessons, you sat with them. When little- oh what was her name? She didn’t live long that one- well, when she drifted off to sleep, and Madam Laurent brought the ruler to her hand, you resisted the urge to stop her. It was so clearly offensive to you, yet your face showed nothing. Instead, you sat with her, patting her arm to keep her attentive. You waited, holding your response until after. You, being the unpredictably intelligent woman you are, requested to teach the lessons on Madam Laurent’s behalf.\n\nYou were truly magnificent. During their eye-stimulation treatments, you gave them teddy bears. When they were interviewed for long-exposure testing, you learned to trick them into failing the test. At every stop, you fooled me. At every curve, I watched a beautiful woman do kind things, not thinking for a moment that she might know better than I did what effect they might have. But you did know. You were trying to save them. Finally, you witnessed how one of them died. You saw it with your own eyes. You had insisted upon observation duty, claiming you were covering for Mrs. Price, who had been sick for several days. She had been, after all. Was that your doing? And you were so kind, weren’t you? I suppose you had to know why some children would not return to breakfast, why some children went to bed only to never appear again.\n\nI remember this boy, Evan. It was your duty to bring him to his bed, to help him make it, to ensure that he had his bedclothes. You were the only nanny who actually kept this responsibility on nights like these. Despite what you had learned from the hushed whispers of “muppet,” what it did to those children who stirred, how it took them away, you were kind to him. You must have warned him. He really tried. But he cried, didn’t he? And so you saw what happened to them when it heard them, or saw them stir. You saw the way it bashed them and dashed them and dragged them away. \n\nYou knew why they were so frightened now. You knew what it was capable of. And so you began asking questions in the meal line. Our kitchen staff did not answer you, but I know now why you were asking. You wanted to contact the outside. You knew that they received supplies. It was simple logic really. But what I do not know even now is how you escaped. How did you know when the shipment was coming? How did you manage to survive the cold long enough to reach the delivery unit? I do not know. You must have been determined. I would have expected you to try and take that one child with you, the one who seemed so attached to you. Yet, she most certainly would not have survived the cold. But then again neither would you. You really are incredible, Nellie. \n\nBut of course I am not here to congratulate you. You made it far enough to frighten me. When our driver called me, he said that you had held a kitchen knife to his throat. While he managed to convince you of his innocence, he was forced to bring you to civilization, to that damned ranger and his damned walkies. God only knows what you told them. By the time I arrived they were talking about calling the authorities. Thankfully, Ben was clever. He told them you’d held him hostage. He wasn’t even lying. And so you were a crazy woman in the mountains. My brilliant, defiant, benevolent Nellie, labeled as “hysterical.” And so I found you. I am presented with a choice. I can forgive you, reintroduce you to our southern facility, bring you back under my protective wing. But Nellie, In all practicality, you’ve been outside. You know the landscape now. I couldn’t have you cluing in any other aspiring Harriets. I hope you can forgive me. \n\n\\-Micheal\n\nI wish that I could tell you where I found this letter. I am afraid that any bread crumbs may lead them to me. As much as I want to be brave, as deeply as I burn to see those children free, I could tell you for certain that bad things come to those who are found by Droughton Hill.  Until next time, \n\n\\-C.",

        "text": "Joey Evanston was nice. In high school, it's rare to find someone who's genuinely kind to others. Joey Evanston would go out of his way to help you if you dropped your books, needed a dollar extra to pay for lunch, or needed help with some homework. Joey Evanston is the type of guy you reach out to, for anything. One story I remember, about Joey Evanston, is when he saved the school's musical from ending in chaos by climbing to the top of the auditorium and fixing the speakers in less than ten minutes. \n\nJoey Evanston was nice, and that was easy for people to prey on. In high school, there's always someone who's guaranteed to be an asshole. Brian Cavonia would go out of his way to push Joey Evanston or make fun of Joey Evanston's mom for her cancer, or mess up his projects, but Joey Evanston still kept a smile plastered on his face. Brian Cavonia is the type of guy who everyone hates but is too scared to stand up too. One story I remember, about Joey Evanston, is when Brian Cavonia tripped him down a flight of stairs, and he broke his leg, yet Joey Evanston didn't snitch. \n\nJoey Evanston was nice, and that made Joey Evanston seem happy. In high school, there's plenty of problems people have, and Joey Evanston had a mental one. Joey Evanston's mom died a week before it happened. Joey Evanston started blowing off his classes. Joey Evanston seemed completely fine. Joey Evanston is the type of guy who seemed completely fine. One time I remember, Joey Evanston broke down in class the day before it happened, he ran out of the class to the bathroom. The teacher continued the lecture, and nobody checked on him. I could've checked on him. \n\nA month ago today, at 12:22 PM, Joey Evanston got on top of a lunch table and just started screaming at random people. At 12:23 PM, Joey Evanston pulled out an M9 Beretta his dad used while on his deployment. People ran out of the cafeteria, hid under tables, called the police, and filmed Joey Evanston. Approximately forty-two cameras were on Joey Evanston when he put the gun against his head. I was frozen at my lunch table, staring upward at Joey Evanston. The screaming and panic had stopped, it was completely silent except for the breathing of the students in the cafeteria. \n\nJoey Evanston looked down at me, from atop my lunch table, and told me four words. \n\n\"This isn't your fault.\" \n\nJoey Evanston shot himself in the head at 12:25 PM. A piece of his scalp made its way into my lap, his blood splattered against me, other students, tables, the floor. The floor was red, completely red. Pieces of Joey Evanston's brain were in my hair, on my shirt, everywhere. A quarter of Joey Evanston's head was gone. Joey Evanston's body fell off the table, the gun still in his hand as he lay on the floor. \n\nJoey Evanston was quiet, and the lunchroom was too, until Heather Ophelia screamed. Then more people screamed, more running, and more fear. Fear. Fear had frozen me in place, I sat with a soda can in hand, holding on to the tables bench, next to Joey Evanston's body, drenched in blood. The police had to drag me away from the scene, attempting to console me as they did. \n\nA week later, school was back in session, and I had to sit at the same table I sat at when Joey Evanston put a bullet in his own head. I sat in my seat, and Brian Cavonia sat on the school's roof. Brian Cavonia wore his signature letterman jacket, previously stained with blood from Joey Evanston, now drenched in his own. Brian Cavonia's body was found by the school's janitor, Mr. Victor. Brian Cavonia was face down, on top of the principals now crushed car. Mr. Victor quit the next day. \n\nA week later, Mr. Evanston, Joey's dad refilled his bottle of painkillers at the local pharmacy. People at the pharmacy said their condolences, and Mr. Evanston accepted them, like he had done when his wife had died. Mr. Evanston was a soldier; he'd made it through war. He'd made it through his wifes death, with his son. Mr. Evanston had nothing left when Joey Evanston killed himself in the middle of the school cafeteria. Mr. Evanston took out a bottle of his favorite whiskey and downed it with his pain killers. They found his body two days later, sitting on the floor of his bathroom, hand around the neck of the bottle of alcohol. \n\nA week later, I thought about what Joey Evanston had said to me. He wanted me to know it wasn't my fault. I'd known Joey when I was really young, and sort of looked up to him. We started growing more distant, but still talked to each other from time to time. That's when I realized that Joey Evanston might've been nice to other people, but people weren't nice back to him, I was, though. I was Joey Evanston's only friend. Joey Evanston's death was my fault, and I know it, and he knows it, and everyone else knows it. \n\nJoey Evanston was an inspiration, someone to follow in the footsteps of. \n\nI've decided that I'm going to follow in the footsteps of Joey Evanston.",

I didn't talk to her anymore and many of her friends told me that she started to say that I changed her and they all told her if you don't love her why are you getting mad after this she looked sad and I talked to her to ask her what happened and she complained about many things and that I made her feel bad because I didn't talk to her and we had a fight outside the party and she told me that I didn't talk to her and she said that I didn't love her anymore. I told her that it was for my mental health and I told her that she likes me but she doesn't want anything to do with me and that she doesn't want to be with anyone so we got on bad terms and many friends agreed with me and her friends too but I also started to think that Am I the asshole?",

        "text": "My grandmother surrounded herself with beautiful things. She was a production designer in Old Hollywood, and her little house looked the part — silks, crystal, a grand staircase fit for the stars. She died when I was young, so I got to know her through her movies — big, melodramatic romances from the golden era. I loved them all. I could trace her touch in every scene.\n\nAlways, the women in her movies glowed, like they carried their own light. She carried that light, raising my mother on her own, far from home, far from the life she made in California. It’s no wonder I grew up wanting to work in film.\n\nMy mother laughed when I said I wanted to move to Los Angeles. My grandmother never liked to talk about the old days, but she always warned: “There’s nothing good waiting for you in Hollywood.”\n\nBefore I left, my mother gave me a box of my grandmother’s things from her movie days — stolen props, marked up scripts, photos from lavish parties, stacks of letters.\n\nIt was the letters.\n\nI put off reading them, unsure whether my grandmother would want them read. But as the honeymoon of LA faded and the loneliness set in, I wondered whether she struggled the same way. So I opened them.\n\nI found something much stranger inside.\n\nThe following are letters from a woman named Vera, apparently a close friend of my grandmother. I asked my mother about her, but she’s never heard the name. From what I can tell, she was an architect living in Hollywood during the golden era. She was married to a successful film director. I can’t find any records of her after the dates on these letters.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMarch 23, 1947\n\nMae,\n\nThe site is even more beautiful in the spring, the wildflowers all abloom. The main house rises out of the treetops like a cathedral. I doubted Hugh when he suggested we move so far from the city, but now I see this place for the Eden it is. Even the incessant hammering of the workers cannot detract from the tranquility.\n\nHugh returns tomorrow from his yearly pilgrimage home. One day I will convince him: no amount of drunken Irish carousing could scare me off at this point. He’s certainly seen the trouble you and I get into. Yet he insists he must go alone to “recharge his creativity.” Truly I think he leaves in case the reviews are unfavorable. But as always, the picture is a triumph. Every soul in the theater was positively enchanted. If he loves me half as much as people love his films, I’m a lucky woman indeed.\n\nWe must have you out to the house soon. We want this place to be a destination for all lovers of beauty. I will need your magic in turning these bare halls into Shangri-La.\n\nYour friend,\n\nVera\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMarch 29, 1947\n\nDearest Mae,\n\nI’m afraid we will have to postpone your visit, there has been an accident. A dreadful thing: one of the young workers was found behind the guest house, battered and terribly concussed. Poor boy looked like he had wandered the woods all night, covered in burs and bristling with thorns. He’s in hospital in town, but a shadow remains over the site. A visit should wait for brighter times. We certainly hope to see you for our party on the 12th!\n\nA strange thought: I know I saw the boy leaving with the other workers the evening before. He must have come back in the dark and fell into the site. It’s strange living on such large and untamed land — all I heard last night was the wind in the trees. He’s lucky we found him when we did. I insist the workers slow down, proceed more carefully, but they seem eager to complete the build. A very superstitious bunch. I only hope they aren’t so hasty the roof falls in when they leave! We plan on staying here a long, long time.\n\nThrow a pinch of salt for me,\n\nVera\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApril 6, 1947\n\nDarling Mae,\n\nI am at wit’s end. Construction is nearly complete, and today I walk onto the site to find the workers tearing down my gazebo! They insist Hugh changed the plans overnight. He has some mad idea about a centerpiece for the garden, an enormous moon-gate. It makes no sense, aesthetically or practically. You ought to see, he scribbled over my blueprints like a man possessed.\n\nI’ve never met someone both so erratic and so particular. He was hoisting the lumber himself, shouting at workers to move stones here and there. If this is how he operates on his pictures, be glad you’ve not had the misfortune of working with him! Even as I’m writing this, I see him out in the garden, tying flowers and vines to his haphazard structure, as if foliage will improve that monstrosity.\n\nI can’t say how thrilled I am to see you next weekend. This house needs a dose of sanity.\n\nAll my love from the pagan wilds,\n\nVera\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApril 14, 1947\n\nMae,\n\nWhat more can be said? I can’t tell you how I much I relished having you out for the weekend. As ever, you leave me revitalized.\n\nSuch a shame the party ended the way it did. I was so grateful to have you to help with the aftermath. I only hope it does not darken your memory of this place.\n\nThe young starlet is recovering at Queen of Angeles Hospital. We were able to send word to the poor girl’s family back East, and her escort from the party seemed well committed to her care.\n\nI did not know the extent of the damage, but I spoke to a surgeon at the hospital. He referred us to a specialist who helps men disfigured from the war. A mask maker. Can you imagine? I am sick with guilt. I fear her career in pictures may be over before it began. Such a beauty.\n\nHow did it happen? I must blame myself as host. I should have been watching the girl, counting her drinks. Hugh insisted we keep the lights low so we could see the stars, but that only made it easier for her to slip away. Did she get lost? Fall into glass? I searched the ghastly scene, but saw nothing that could cause such wounds.\n\nI feel uneasy in this house. All our guests were accounted for, and the girl will not speak about the accident. Did a stranger slip into the parlor? The police cleared the workers, but our presence here is no secret. We are the only lights for miles. I fear being this far in the wilderness. I shall check the locks again tonight.\n\nThinking of you,\n\nVera\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApril 19, 1947\n\nMy Mae,\n\nI so appreciate your last letter. I keep it in my pocket throughout the day, a little totem of strength in a strange land.\n\nI fear I have been too hard on Hugh. It’s easy — comforting, even — to believe in his stony stoicism, but I know he’s troubled. There has been a specter over us since the party.\n\nHe was in the garden last night. I woke in the dark and found him missing. I thought it was a stranger at first, standing under the moon-gate. Watching him from the window, I had the strangest sensation: I knew it was Hugh, his broad frame, his pajamas… but it was like looking at something completely foreign.\n\nHe was sleepwalking, the poor baby. He must have been there for hours. He was shivering, his clothes soaked with dew. I led him back to the house, where he finally woke up. He clung to me like I pulled him off a sinking ship.\n\nI wish he had someone he felt he could talk to.\n\nYours,\n\nVera\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApril 23, 1947\n\nMae,\n\nIt seems I spoke too soon. I have been trying with Hugh, and I thought we were making progress.\n\nImagine my surprise when I step into my kitchen last night for a glass of water and find that starlet from the party standing barefoot in the dark, staring at me.\n\nI am at an utter loss. Her injuries must have been greatly exaggerated, as she looked perfectly radiant. You should have seen the way she looked at me, daring me to speak. She might as well have been laughing in my face.\n\nI don’t know what to do, Mae. We all knew he had a penchant for young actresses, but this is beyond the pale. In our own house?\n\nI’m only writing this to keep me from cracking up completely. I wish you were here. I’ve packed a bag. Hugh wasn’t in bed, not that I could bear to see him. No doubt he’s in the garden. The girl can fetch him, or let him freeze. I don’t care anymore.\n\nI’m driving to you tonight.\n\nVera\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMay 4, 1947\n\nDearest,\n\nWhere to begin? When I went back to the house, I didn’t expect it to be easy. You know Hugh. He would sooner pluck out his eyes than admit a mistake. But I at least expected a quiet house in which we could stew and fight and eventually make up, as always.\n\nI came back to a midnight bacchanal.\n\nThe halls were packed, spilling out onto the lawn. Men and women I’d never seen, raucous and wine drunk. I could hear the roar of laughter before the house was in view. All the doors and windows were open, the rain pouring in.\n\nThis was a particularly libertine bunch, no doubt from Hugh’s underground days. Tattered suits, torn cocktail dresses, and masks. Oh, the masks. Wood and clay and wet leaves molded into monstrous faces, sneering and cackling. I wanted to tear them apart, the way they grabbed at me as I went through searching for Hugh.\n\nI found him locked away in our bedroom, staring out at the chaos in the garden below. I was ready to kill him for this, for the girl, for everything.\n\nOh Mae, I just don’t know.\n\nSomething about him that night. As soon as he turned, I saw him — the man I met all those years ago. It was I had been living with his ghost, and here he was, resurrected. He was so tender, so human… I came ready to fight, but all that rage and resentment just melted away at his touch. I will spare you the details, but we were alive together last night in a way we had not been in years.\n\nLove is a strange thing. Our house may be a mess, but for once my heart is clear.\n\nAlways your friend,\n\nVera\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMay 8, 1947\n\nMy guiding light,\n\nYou were right. You are always right.\n\nI’ve been alone these days since that hellish masquerade, trying to put our house back in order. The wilderness has taken a foothold, vines growing out of cracks in the plaster. Hugh had left the first morning, I thought to work in his ever-growing garden. After the second day I wondered if he had gone for good.\n\nAfter missing for three days, he came shambling out of the woods, looking like all hell. He didn’t say a word, just went to the kitchen and ate like a starving beast. He looked just like that worker boy, covered in brambles and thorns. He didn’t even acknowledge me until I tried to call a doctor.\n\nHe won’t speak of where he went. Worse — he doesn’t remember the night of the bacchanal. He doesn’t remember our reconciliation. Worse yet, I believe him.\n\nI will gather the rest of my things. There is nothing left for me here.\n\nVera\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMay 11, 1947\n\nMae,\n\nI hope by writing this, I can discover some shred of sanity in the past twenty-four hours. Or failing that — wake myself from this nightmare.\n\nI fell asleep late after Hugh returned, exhausted from packing and fighting with my mute husband. I woke up with light in my eyes. Not from the sun, but from an enormous fire raging in the garden.\n\nI saw Hugh. He was standing beneath the moon-gate, can of kerosene in hand. The gate was a blustering inferno, threatening to topple inward.\n\nAll around him were figures, just outside the fire. Mostly young women — the starlet among them — circling the gate, kept at bay by the flames. They looked like they wanted to eat him alive.\n\nI saw him look to the house, to my window. I don’t know if he could see me with all the smoke in his eyes. But his gaze told me everything.\n\nI did not hesitate. I grabbed only what I needed and ran from the house, slipped out the side door, out of view of the garden, onto the drive.\n\nI found the car choked with vines, as if it had been rusting in the woods for decades. I went to try the door, but I saw something in the firelight.\n\nThere was something in the backseat. I say something, because while it cut the silhouette of a hulking man, it looked more like something you dig out of the earth. Something knotted and poisonous you dig out of the roots of a garden and throw away.\n\nI ran through the woods. I don’t know how far. I ran until the pillar of smoke was just a faint trail over the moon. Then I rejoined the road. I walked all the way into town.\n\nI’ve been staying with an elderly couple we met while moving in. The husband is a retired physician, the wife a schoolteacher. You would like them.\n\nI wanted to leave, to run all the way to you, but I fell ill. Almost as soon as I left the grounds, something gripped me inside and wouldn’t let go. I barely remember knocking on doors in town, my head was swimming so.\n\nThe doctor tells me I am pregnant. A parting gift from Hugh. I have been in and out of sleep for a few days. I have had the strangest dreams.\n\nThey sent men to search for Hugh and the girls. There’s nothing there but the burned-out skeleton of our house, wildflowers already growing over the ash.\n\nPlease come get me. I want to come home.\n\nLove,\n\nVera\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I showed my mother these letters, she didn’t speak for a long time. Finally, she shared another memory about my grandmother, one nearly forgotten:\n\nMy mother was very sick as a baby. My grandmother took her everywhere, but nothing would help. They were sure they would lose her. Finally, according to my grandmother, “Auntie V” figured out what to do.\n\n“Auntie V went back to the woods to make you better.”\n\nMy mother has no memory of “Auntie V.” She doesn’t like to talk about the letters, or that era of my grandmother’s life. Whenever I ask, she simply says, “Whatever happened, they did it for us. Let’s be grateful, and leave the rest behind.”\n\nThere’s some sense in that.\n\nBut it doesn’t help me much lately, as I find myself waking up with soil on my feet and brambles in my hair.\n\nIt doesn’t help as the dreams become more frequent.\n\nDreams of murmuring flowers and tangled skin, of muddy masks and stolen faces and a great gate rising in the woods…",

        "text": "I got the first offer in the mail on the last Sunday of the month. The text appeared on a bright pink piece of paper, enclosed in an envelope addressed to my mailing address: WILL PAY 50K FOR YOUR HOUSE IN CASH. \n\nThere was no name or company information, only a telephone number with an unrecognizable area code. Seeing as I had a huge mortgage on my house that was at least several multiples of the amount being offered, I ripped the offer to shreds and promptly forgot about it.\n\nBesides, I liked my house. It was a three-bedroom ranch-style home, with a neat little backyard, spacious bathroom, and a cheerful kitchen with a huge window looking out into the beautiful garden of my neighbor Shelby, an eighty-year-old widow who spent her days obsessing over her plants. \n\nBut the offers continued, stubbornly coming to my mailbox despite my lack of reaction to them. The 50K soon became 52K. Then 60K. Each time I didn’t respond, the envelopes started coming more aggressively, growing darker and darker in tone. \n\nI wondered if I was the only one receiving them, or if it was our entire neighborhood. As far as neighborhoods went, it was a pretty small one, but situated on a scenic spot of land with plenty of greenery, good eco-life, and a proximity to the ocean. My neighbors were all older and led quiet lives. Besides Shelby, there was Gemma, a fifty year-old mother of twin boys, Tim and Tana, a childless couple in their sixties who spent most of their time traveling around the world, and Fenson, a seventy-year-old former photographer. All in all, this was a tranquil little neighborhood that didn’t quite explain the reason for this sudden aggressive interest in it. \n\nOn a whim, I decided to ask Shelby if she also received the ridiculous offers. Out of all my neighbors, she happened to be the most accessible one, since Gemma limited her communication to her sons, Tim and Tana were always away, and Fenson spent most of the time living inside his own head, as I learned one day when I asked him about the storm we just had and he asked me: “What storm?” As it happened, Shelby was in the middle of hosting a garage sale when I finally summoned up the guts to approach her, catching her just as she was setting up the stand.\n\n“I’ll only talk to you if you buy something,” Shelby said as soon as I opened my mouth. Despite living next door to each other ever since I had moved in a year ago, we had spent more time watching each other than talking. Something that didn’t seem as if it would be changing any time soon.\n\nSo I played her game and grabbed the first thing I saw—a 2017 calendar of sea turtles—and paid its one dollar cost. She nodded, and after ascertaining that there were no other customers there at the moment, she took me aside.\n\n“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” Shelby said. “But if I was being offered something like the amounts you’re quoting, I would probably call the cops. These are *criminally* low!”  Then she laughed at her own joke, and went back to ignoring me.\n\nI returned back to my house and attempted to throw the calendar in my kitchen trash can, but it was already overflowing. Who the fuck sells old calendars anyway? I stared at the useless calendar, in exchange for which I received information that turned out to be just as useless. \n\nAt least the illustrations of sea turtles were pretty, though the grids sheets had random words scrawled on them. In all there were twelve words, with one word per month. Random words like “dust,” “willow,” “target,” “orange,” etc. Perhaps this was Shelby’s way of formulating a to-do list. I tore off the pretty images of sea turtles, and set aside the calendar pages to dispose of later. \n\nThen I got back to my usual routine, which largely revolved around my greeting card business. It was still in the beginning stages, but I was working with some excellent illustrators and finding my future clients through a special events agency I had a contract with. It was this that I was working on later that evening when I heard some rustling outside my front door. \n\nI turned on the lights and looked out the window. No one was there. I opened the door just to be sure. And that’s when I saw it: an urn with a piece of paper crudely taped to it. The text was scrawled out in red sharpie: 70K FINAL OFFER! \n\nI suddenly realized I missed the colorful envelopes. Who the fuck uses an urn for something like this? Unless it was meant as a threat? I shivered, as I tore the damn note off. \n\nI was just about to return to work when I heard someone approaching my front door. I froze, hoping it wasn’t the same creep. It was almost evening now, and the street lights had come on. The neighborhood was its normal peaceful self, with the exception of the sudden activity around my house. \n\n“Hi there.” It was Shelby, looking slightly disoriented. The polar opposite to her immaculate morning self. A closer glance revealed a bruise under her right eye. Had she had it in the morning as well? I couldn’t remember. \n\n“Hi Shelby. Do you want to come in?” I asked her, trying to sound neighborly. But Shelby seemed distracted, constantly glancing at something or someone over her shoulder. Instead of responding, she went in ahead of me, almost slamming my own front door in my face.\n\n“Coffee? Tea?” I asked awkwardly, as soon I shut the door behind us.\n\n“Do you have a can of Coke?” she asked.\n\nI nodded and headed to the kitchen. When I came back, I found her in the living room, looking at the note I had torn from the urn just a moment before her arrival, but hadn’t had a chance to properly discard. For a second I wondered if she had taped it there herself. \n\n“Wow, only 70K?” she stared at it, amused. “I hope you’re not that desperate for money.”\n\n“That’s what I was asking you about this morning. There’s nothing special about my house. I don’t get why I’m being targeted. That’s why I was hoping it wasn’t just me.”\n\n“How weird,” Shelby said. “Lots of idiots around here. I hope you’re not actually considering it. Anyway, I’m here to take back that calendar I sold you.”\n\n“Calendar?”\n\nShe nodded.\n\n“Did you find a time machine back to 2017?” I joked.\n\nShe looked at the floor, clearly uncomfortable with my question.\n\n“Something like that. I didn’t meant for it to be a part of my garage sale.”\n\n“No problem.” I went up to my room, stuffed it into a paper bag, and returned to the living room, handing it to her. “Do I get my dollar back as well?”\n\n“Dollar?”\n\n“What I paid for the calendar.”\n\n“Oh, that’s right.” She reached into her jeans…and came out empty. “Sorry, it’s been a while since I carried cash around. Can you come around my place tomorrow morning? I’ll give it back to you.”\n\n“Sure.” \n\nA moment later Shelby left, looking more relaxed than when she arrived. I locked the door behind her and decided to call it a night. As I slept that night, I dreamed about urns, all lined up in rows with the inscription “FINAL OFFER!” on them.  \n\nIn the morning after breakfast, I decided to check on Shelby. I didn’t really care about the dollar she owed me, but something about her had been off and I couldn’t really place what it was. But after ringing her doorbell and walking around in circles outside her front door, her door remained closed. I decided she must be sleeping in late, though she was usually an early riser. \n\nI was just about to leave, when I hit my foot on something. I wasn’t usually nosy, but something about her whole appearance yesterday had thrown me off, as well as her not coming to the door this morning. Against my better judgment, I decided to investigate. And then I saw it. Just like the messages I’ve been getting, but with a higher number, scrawled out in a red sharpie marker, on a piece of paper taped to an identical urn: 85K FINAL OFFER! \n\nHoly cow. I left it there, and then knocked on her door again. Still no answer. With a kind of nervous energy, I returned back to my house and called emergency services, requesting they do a welfare check. In the meantime, I got back to reviewing drafts of greeting cards. \n\nI saw them outside of my window twenty minutes later: two cops coming out of a police cruiser, looking bored. One of them knocked on Shelby’s door. There was no answer. After milling around for another fifteen minutes, they finally jumped into action, breaking down the front door. I shivered, imagining the repair bill. And then they walked in, disappearing inside the darkness of the house.\n\nI had just finished selecting a suitable typescript for the latest incarnation of a “Happy Birthday, Boss!” greeting card, when an ambulance stopped outside of Shelby’s residence twenty minutes later. Three paramedics exited, carrying a stretcher. A minute later, they headed inside her house. I could not tear my gaze away from them. Five minutes later they were back out again, with Shelby’s body covered by a sheet. \n\nWhat the fuck? After a brief conversation with the cops, they left without turning on the sirens. I forgot all about work and caught the cops, just as they were putting up yellow crime tape in front of Shelby’s house. \n\n“What happened?” I asked. \n\n“Were you the neighbor who requested the welfare check?” the cops asked, as I nodded. “We’d like a word with you.”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI had to come out to the station for their interview, which turned out to be nothing more than me talking and them silently assessing my responses, while keeping their own information to themselves. After I finished answering their questions and saw the disappointment on their faces, I decided to switch the topic to the lowball house offers that, as it turned out, both Shelby and I have been receiving. When I was done, the cops gave me a bored look.\n\n“And? This is a free country. I don’t see anything unlawful here,” one of them said. “As a house owner, you make your own decisions.”\n\n“But..but…” I stumbled for words, as they were rapidly losing interest. “Why was the ‘final offer’ taped to an urn? Don’t you think that’s at the very least…kind of disturbing? Especially if Shelby turned up dead afterwards?”\n\nThe cops glared at me.\n\n“Think about it,” I continued, feeling slightly encouraged. “Now her house will definitely be on the market! Maybe even for a much lower asking price than the one she would’ve wanted. Or, depending on how much they’re in need of money, her relatives, or whoever she left the house to in her will, might even accept the low offer outright!”\n\nThe cops looked skeptical, but at least agreed to “look into the matter.” \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nBack at home, I at least felt slightly calmer. After making myself a cup of tea and watching the news, I was about to take a shower when I heard it again. Some noise outside my front door. I put down my empty mug and walked up to my front door, staring out the window. \n\n“Hello?” I yelled through my front door, without opening it. “Is anyone there?”\n\nBut there was silence, followed by footsteps of someone running away. I stood there for what seemed like ten minutes, as if glued to the spot. There was no one there. At least, not anymore. After double-checking that the front door was locked, I moved a heavy dresser to it from the living room. \n\nIn the morning, when I woke up, the dresser looked worse for wear, as if someone had been repeatedly banging the door against it. I couldn’t focus on my work. Not anymore. So I left my house via the back door, and decided that now would be a good time to consult my other neighbors. Maybe if we all teamed up, we wouldn’t have to follow Shelby to the great beyond, if this was the strategy the would-be buyer was using. \n\nFirst up was Gemma’s house. Probably the neatest on the street. The front door was opened by Lucian, one of her twin boys, who looked captivated by his tablet. I asked him if I could talk to the mom. He gave me a questioning look, but didn’t say anything. As I waited for Gemma, I spotted a collection of rocks on the windowsill. A minute later Gemma appeared and caught me looking at them.\n\n“Those are Lucian’s. He likes to use them against those damn raccoons. Anyway, what do you want?” she asked, pulling her bathrobe tight around her.\n\nI told her about Shelby and the house purchase offers we’ve both been receiving, before asking her if she also received anything of the sort.\n\n“The boys check the mail, and they know better than to show that crap to me,” she said, unimpressed. “Now get out of my house.”\n\nI tried to shrug off her hostile attitude, but admitted my whole visit there had been a waste of time. Next up was the house belonging to Tim and Tana, the worldwide travelers who were never home. After knocking several times and almost giving up, I was surprised when the door finally opened. In the doorway stood a college-age guy, who looked nothing like Tim. I froze, unsure of how to approach the situation. \n\n“I’m just renting this place, while Tim and Tana are traveling,” he said as if reading my mind. “My name’s Nathan, by the way.” He stuck out his hand. I noticed he had decked out the entire room in Halloween decorations, complete with a life-like witch. \n\n“Isn’t Halloween still far away?” I asked him, curious.\n\n“It’s my favorite holiday,” he grinned. \n\nI decided it would be useless to ask if he received any offers for a house that didn’t even belong to him, so after making meaningless small talk, I made my way back. Last up was Fenson. To my surprise, he knew right away what I was talking about. As it turned out, he had also been receiving the house purchase offers, though he thought it was some kind of ruse. When I told him about Shelby, his body stiffened. \n\n“Do you want me to go stay with you?” he asked. \n\nI was about to respond, when I spotted detailed photographs of our houses on the wall behind him. Odd. He caught my glance, and blushed.\n\n“I used to be a photographer, as you know, so I couldn’t help it. I’m not the one sending out those offers, I promise.” \n\nI stared at him, but couldn’t tell if the was telling the truth or not. Either way, the photographs had freaked me out and I ended our talk as quickly as possible. After returning home, I lay in bed, wondering if I should say something to the cops about them. Maybe I was overreacting and it was all just some big coincidence...\n\nSomehow, I got through the work day, and was just settling down for the evening when I heard it again. Footsteps. But this time, inside my house. \n\nIt took all I had not to scream, as I locked myself inside my bedroom. After frantically searching for my cell phone, I suddenly remembered that I had left it charging in the living room. Idiot! I held my breath as the footsteps stopped outside my door. \n\n“I’m not selling my house to you!” I yelled, breaking out in sweat. “Go away!”\n\nThe footsteps hesitated. I studied my tiny, windowless bedroom. No way to hide or escape. I looked at the ceiling, and started praying. For a minute, there was complete silence. And then I heard a metallic scraping sound. \n\nI screamed. A moment later, the door flew open, my lock having failed to offer any meaningful resistance. \n\n“I’m not selling my house to you!” I repeated. “I’m not—“ \n\nAnd then I froze. The figure in front of me was wearing a green mask and a medical uniform, holding a scalpel in his hands. \n\n“I’m not interested in your ugly house,” he said in a whispery voice, as if he was trying to disguise his real voice. \n\n“But—“ I was suddenly unable to put a string of words together. None of it made sense. As he leaned over me, I was hit with the scent of strong disinfectant. He had come here to kill me. The realization made my head start spinning in a million directions, as my skin broke out in goose bumps.\n\n“I don’t need your ugly house,” the surgeon, as I had nicknamed him in my mind, repeated. “That’s Nathan’s deal.”\n\n“Nathan?” I suddenly realized he was talking about the Halloween-loving college kid renting Tim’s and Tana’s property. “*That’s* who wanted to buy the houses on the cheap?” \n\nThe surgeon ignored me.\n\n“Give me the calendar,” he said. \n\n“The what?” I stared at the scalpel, as it stopped inches from my face. \n\n“The calendar Shelby sold you. Give it to me.”\n\nIt took me a moment to remember what he was talking about, with most of my cognition taken up by a sense of panic rapidly spreading to my limbs.\n\n“But I already gave it back to her.”\n\nThe surgeon shook his head. \n\n“You gave her back *half* of it. Where’s the other half?” \n\n“What?” And then it came back to me. I had disbanded the calendar after buying it, separating the pictures from the grid sheets. “Wait, which half did I give her?” I asked him. \n\n“The pictures.” His whispery voice was giving me the creeps. \n\n“Hold on, I’ll go search for the grid sheets. S-sorry about that.” I found myself stuttering for the first time since I was five. \n\nThe surgeon nodded, closely following me as I left the bedroom and headed for my living room, trying to remember where I had left the stupid pages, while stepping over the mess the surgeon had made all over my house, evidently trying to find it himself. Twenty minutes later, I finally found the remaining pages, and handed him the remaining half of the calendar. \n\n“If you don’t mind me asking, what’s so…important about a 2017 calendar?” I asked, as soon as the surgeon put the scalpel down. The way he stared back at me through his green mask made me regret I even asked. But to my surprise, he responded.\n\n“All I needed was the seed phrase to restore my crypto wallet, and Aunt Shelby goes off and sells it to a total stranger!”\n\n“Seed phrase?” I stared at the calendar pages in his hands. And then I remembered: the twelve words scrawled on the grid sheets. Guess they weren’t that random after all. “That’s why you killed her?”\n\nOut went the scalpel again. I screamed.\n\n“I’m going to give you a choice,” he whispered. “A shot or a pill. If it’s no to both then…” He pointed to the scalpel. I gulped. \n\n“What’s…what’s in the pill?” I asked.\n\n“Something to make you forget everything that happened,” he whispered. “It’s your only chance of staying alive.” \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThis all happened a year ago. The pill initially wiped out my memories of not just that day, but of my current life in general. It took a long time to put everything back together, and by that time, the surgeon had long since vanished. \n\nAs it turned out, Shelby had left behind a large family. But no nephew.",

[There is the beginning](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/117rh26/hes_not_our_son_part_1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) of dead. In the middle there is Nameis. There is me. And Music. \n\n—\n\nWe didn’t want him to hear, so we told him to play his music loud. It seemed sickening.  His bounding children’s song would be ruined afterwards, forever linked with the memory of a dead little girl and a plastic hospital bag and a blue hoodie with a cut left sleeve. \n\n…And the contents of a pocket. \n\n“Paul, what does it mean?”\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\n“Why did he have these?”\n\nI didn’t want to answer Rachel. I couldn’t. Not yet. \n\nShe grimaced.  “They cut the hoodie off of him at the hospital and put it in the bag, which means he had them at the playground.”\n\n“Yeah.”\n\n“Well—maybe it’s not something bad. Right? It’s not necessarily something bad. Maybe someone at school—or—maybe he found them. Why would he keep them though?” She paused and nervously chewed a nail. “Any thoughts Paul? Because if I’m being crazy I need you to tell me.”\n\nMy hand shook. I swallowed. \n\n“I—I think they were hers.”\n\n“Her—oh fuck—*Tansy*? Why would—“\n\nRachel had opened the hospital bag. She said that she just felt like she needed to. I finally told her about the night I found Eddie standing in the corner of our room. I hadn’t wanted to. I didn’t want her to fear our son as I did. But I suppose *I* felt like I needed to. \n\nOur son wasn’t normal. He had killed a little girl and I told Rachel the rest. Before that, Tansy had been crying and before that, standing next to the castle where Eddie had smirked from a narrow window. I wasn’t watching him closely enough. But I’d watched Rachel, sullen, pulling Eddie’s hoodie from the bag. Then Rachel, confused, pulling a little pair of pink underwear from the pocket. Now, she stared at those underwear on the verge of tears. \n\n“Paul—what did our little boy do?”\n\nI couldn’t answer her with certainty. I hadn’t seen. No one had. And no one knew the truth except for the one who’d gotten away with it all. They treated him like a victim, and I’d let them, because he was my son. \n\n“I don’t think he’ll get better, Rachel. I think he’ll get worse.”\n\nShe wept and Cooper napped in his bassinet and the muffled sound of music filled the hall as I went downstairs to the kitchen for a drink. \n\n—\n\nHe grew thirsty, hungry, but never tired as he built their church of bones. It was their god’s wish that the boy should do the work alone. Lieutenant Nameis was merely the engineer. \n\nTheir god would be pleased. He would reward their sacrifice with peace—an end to the war that had consumed everything, including the reason for its existence. Its beginnings seemed so distant now, its first blood faded into obscurity upon the field of cloth where so many had since bled and died. But the past was unimportant. Nameis knew that. He repeated it to himself like a prayer. \n\nThe soldiers he had commanded had been his brothers once. But the past was unimportant. They had fought for an ideal once. But the past was unimportant. They had skirmished and routed and retreated and rallied to keep each other safe once. But the past was unimportant. They had been alive once. But the past was unimportant. Now the boy stacked their bones in artful ranks and files and built a future atop a foundation of death. \n\nNameis had run out of enemies some time before. The last vestiges of their populace, scattered and hidden, shaking the air in fear just enough for a musician to find their whispering notes. In his constant practise, the boy had become a crimson virtuoso. But he had played every song the enemy had to offer, so he sought his music elsewhere. \n\nNameis’ men had screamed too. Their music resonated with the psychology of betrayal—pure notes that left Nameis absolutely breathless. The silence that followed was a kind of music of its own. A final rest awaiting the applause of their patient god. \n\nIt wouldn’t be long now. The church was high and pale, sturdy and beautiful. Inside, the boy would build an altar and their god would give them one last song. \n\n“It’s nearly done, Lieutenant Nameis.”\n\n“You have done wonderful work, Eddie, my boy.”\n\n—\n\nEddie had done terrible things, in the light of day, surrounded by people. He hadn’t looked hesitant or concerned, he looked at ease. He had a facility for manipulation beyond his age, a comfort with cruelty, but he didn’t kill animals, he didn’t set fires, he didn’t wet the bed and we hadn’t neglected him. Had we? \n\nI browsed warning signs of psychopathy in children on my phone as I sat alone in our kitchen with a bottle of bourbon that hadn’t wanted a glass. He’d gotten sympathy from the parents of a girl he murdered, he’d tricked a fucking psychiatrist; what if he had killed animals and set fires? What if he just hadn’t gotten caught? What if he’d looked at ease that day because Tansy wasn’t the f—no.  *No*. \n\nI took a pull from the bottle, tried to focus on the burn. My thumbs opened a new search on my phone, typed, ‘Missing children near’—no. He was my boy. He couldn’t be—*fuck*—another swig of whiskey, long and stupefying.\n\nI set the phone down and started at the bottle, then at the kitchen knives I sometimes counted out of fear. They were all there. They always were. And Eddie had been so good recently. \n\n“Share a swig?”\n\nRachel slumped onto my shoulder and reached for the bottle before I could answer. \n\n“Sure.” \n\n“This is the third time Baby Shark has played. He’s too old for this song. Why does he like it?”\n\n“I dunno.”\n\nShe settled into the stool beside me and melted onto the island’s countertop. \n\n“I’m a bad mom, Paul. Fuck. There were so many things I wanted to do as a mom. Good things, but now—“\n\n“You’re not a bad mom.”\n\n“Our fourth grader scares the shit out of me. A child I raised. Fuck honey, he *killed* a girl. Took her from a mother who was probably so much better than me, so much more patient and attentive and nice. How does that not make me bad?”\n\nShe wore her tears like makeup as she spoke, present but barely noticeable. I didn’t want this. \n\n“You love him.”\n\n“I don’t know if I do. I used to love him, when he was sweet and he needed me, and for the past couple weeks, he’s been good and every now and then I *think* I love him. But then I see his eyes, and I realize that all I love is the peace of this fucking act.”  She paused and drank a finger from the bottle. “When I see his eyes, I don’t feel love. I feel dread, because I know that the act will end.”\n\n“So what do we do? What *can* we do? Everyone—Doctor Foster included—think that he’s normal.”\n\n“Doctor Foster.” She sighed. “I’ve spent the past ten minutes with his little journal, writing my feelings. Horrible fucking angry things about Eddie. And I don’t feel better. I feel like a bad mom. But maybe I’ll be tipsy enough in a few to forget that.”\n\nI didn’t want this. I wanted her to be okay. “I love you, Rache.”\n\n“You too.”\n\nThe music rose as she left me alone in the kitchen. Eddie had opened his door. Perhaps he would come downstairs and tell me how beautifully I drank with a big plastic smile and his dull black eyes. It would be best to earn the compliment, right?  I gulped miserably, swallowed, and the whiskey washed away my cynicism for a moment. \n\nI didn’t want to resent his kindness. I had agreed to take him to therapy and he had managed to tell Doctor Foster the truth after suggesting that I had hurt him. Was that remorse? Whatever the reason, he had changed afterwards. It might have been an act, but I acted happy sometimes until I actually was. If he could change, if he could learn to be good, then this is what it would look like I supposed. Eddie smiling. Eddie being—\n\n“PAUL!”\n\nRachel didn’t yell my name, she shrieked it. \n\n“HELP ME!”\n\nI ran up the stairs imagining horrible things, stumbling, sobered by adrenaline as my body lagged behind. \n\n“Rachel?!”\n\nI passed Eddie in the hall, smirking, hands bloody. \n\n“What did you—“\n\n“PAUL! PLEASE!”\n\nI pushed passed him, into my bedroom. Something crunched underfoot as I entered. Rachel was screaming. Crying. Covered in blood. Standing on her side of the bed. \n\nLooking down into the bassinet. \n\n“Paul! Call 911! Oh god, what did he do?”\n\nI dialed. \n\n“Cooper! Wake up baby. Wake up. Please fucking wake up!”\n\n“Hello? Yes this is an emergency. Fuck! Um—my son has been stabbed. There’s a lot of blood and—he’s one and a half, and—no—he’s not conscious.”\n\n“I’m so sorry, baby, please just be okay. Please just—“\n\n“Yeah, that’s right, Fernhill *Lane*.  Fuck. Fuck!—honey, she says to apply pressure to the wound.”\n\n“Just be okay. Just be okay.”\n\n“Rachel! Pressure!”\n\n“Which wound?! Jesus fucking Christ—my poor little guy—just be okay. Please!”\n\n“Yes. Still in the house. It’s my—Rachel, I’m gonna lock the bedroom door, okay? I’m still here.”\n\n“What do I do, Paul?  There’s too much blood. Paul—what do I do?”\n\n“They’re on their way, honey—Hurry. Please. Please just fucking—“\n\n“What do I do, Paul?  Baby, just be okay. Just wake up. Wake up. Wake up Cooper, Please. It’s mommy. Please! What do I fucking do? PAUL! TELL ME WHAT TO DO!  Please. What do I do?”\n\nThere was nothing to do. Our baby was dead. \n\nEddie had cut Cooper’s neck and left a shard of wine glass in Cooper’s belly. He’d scattered others across the floor; he must’ve pulled them from the trash and waited. And as Rachel wept, cradling the limp body of our boy, Baby Shark screamed from the hall and Eddie thumped against the bedroom door. \n\nI feared what I would do if I opened it. I would not speak to him. Couldn’t. But he stopped and spoke to us. \n\n“Mommy! Awww…Poor cry-bitch-baby Rachel lost her little Leftenant Nameis! Waahhh, Mommy! Waaahhhhh!”\n\n“Eddie! Shut your fucking mo—“\n\nHe thumped again, hard enough to rattle knob. \n\n“Scream, Paul! Waahhh! Make your pretty music for the boy!”\n\n“Stop it Eddie! Why are you doing this?!” Rachel sobbed her words and Eddie thumped. \n\n“Naaaameis! Leftenant Nameis, bleeding art! Poor brother baby bitch!” Thump. “He sang a song!” Thump. “For no one but his patient god of death!”\n\nThe sirens crept up thinly from the din of sharks and thumps and the blood coursing through my temples. The police arrived first. Eddie was quiet by the time I heard them pounding on the front door. When I unlocked our bedroom door, they were already in the hall. One officer had his gun drawn, held low. The other knelt down, consoling Eddie as he whimpered on the floor. And in an instant, I realized that I knew nothing about my child. \n\nHis hands were clean. Washed. Free of the blood he’d spilled. And his face—he hadn’t been banging on the door. He had been collecting bruises. \n\n“Step back, sir. Hands away from your waist.”\n\nThe officer with the pistol was young, tight shouldered, wary eyes roving. \n\n“I called you.” As firm as I could manage. “My son—“\n\n“He’s in there?” He gestured with his chin at the bedroom door; still holding his gun. What had Eddie told him?\n\nI nodded and he pushed past me. His manner faltered as he stepped through the door and saw. \n\n“Shit.”  \n\nHe radioed something just as a pair of EMTs appeared in the hall. I watched them enter our bedroom as I itched to go back in. \n\n“You getting a pulse?”\n\n“Sir, stay in the hall.”\n\n“I wanna be with my wife!”\n\n“Ma’am, you have to let them do their job. They’re trying to—Sir! Stay in the hall. Buckner, could you—“\n\n“Yeah, I got it. Sir, I’m Officer Buckner. What’s your name?”\n\n“Paul.”\n\n“I’m still getting nothing with the AED.”\n\n“What—what does that mean?”\n\n“I’m really sorry, ma’am.”\n\n“This is Baker-Five. You got anyone in homicide near Fernhill Lane?”\n\nTwo different officers listened to my story before they let me see Rachel. The first, Buckner, didn’t hide his disbelief well. The second—a detective—glad-handed and commiserated vacantly. Another stood officiously beside the door as Rachel and I finally talked. \n\n“They don’t believe me, Paul.”\n\nOur chaperone made no secret of eavesdropping. I didn’t feel like talking. I tried not to think of anything and hugged Rachel who, like me, now wore different clothes. The clothes we’d had were now in evidence bags. \n\nMore and more people swarmed our house, some busy, some bored, some simply occupying space, and I wanted desperately to be somewhere else. Mercifully, the grief over Cooper hadn’t fully hit me and I supposed the frenetic atmosphere and the noise of a dozen different people was good for that at least. \n\nThere hadn’t been time to grieve. And they weren’t treating us like we’d earned it. \n\n“You can go ahead and bag those.”\n\n“Dennis, you mind taking a look at this?”\n\nThe pieces of conversation were all entirety grim and entirely innocuous. But we hadn’t done anything. \n\n“The front door was locked.”\n\n“You check the back?”\n\n“PC?”\n\n“This and everything else? Yeah.”\n\nWe waited. Together. Rachel staring at the floor as I watched the officer by the door thumbing at his phone screen. They’d taken Cooper. Rachel didn’t want to let him go. But Eddie we hadn’t seen. We hadn’t heard him either.  I didn’t ask about him as the detective entered, and whispered to the officer on the door. \n\n“Mrs. George, could you go ahead and stand up for me? Mr. George, you can stay seated.”\n\n“W-what’s happening? Rachel, you don’t have to—“\n\n“Turn around and put your palms together behind your back, ma’am.”\n\nThe detective stood lazily in the doorframe. He was holding a plastic bag in his hand.  I recognized Rachel’s little journal inside. She was crying as the door officer read Miranda Rights from a card he’d had in his shirt pocket. And—\n\nI remembered what Rachel had told me in the kitchen. Fuck. She’d been writing horrible things about Eddie. He was covered in bruises and our baby was dead and she was the only one covered in blood. \n\n“Detective, listen to me. Eddie is *not* what he seems* He is a fucking psychopath! He killed our boy! And he killed Tansy Whitman!”\n\n“Sir, you need to calm down.” I saw the Mirana officer’s hand move toward his belt. \n\n“He fucking set this up—I’m telling you. He’s a conniving little—“\n\n—Nine year old. This was all insane. A nightmare. And he was still their victim. Because I’d said nothing when it mattered. Because he was my son. \n\n—\n\n“You look poorly, Paul. Have you been sleeping?”\n\n“Not well, Doc. My wife’s in prison and my son is dead and Eddie is a serial killer.”\n\n“You’ve been drinking…”\n\n“Fucking hell. They teach you everything at Oxford, don’t they?”\n\n“Paul. I understand you’re going through a traumatic event, that this is all very difficult on you and Eddie—“\n\n“There is no me and Eddie. My only son is dead. And when CPS finishes their investigation or whatever, I don’t want the other one back.”\n\n“Now Paul, that is—“\n\n“Nah. I don’t care. I just want your notes from Eddie’s sessions. He must’ve said something—done something—and right now my wife needs that.”\n\nDoctor Foster sighed, eased his posture into a patronizing silent ‘no.’  He was like everyone else—dismissive of the crazy notion that a child could kill. But I’d been reading. I had nothing but time between my conversations with liquor bottles. Eddie wasn’t the youngest killer out there, he was just more controlled than the others. He lied better. Fit in better. But perhaps with Doctor Foster he had been more candid. Less guarded with a man who he knew would keep his secrets. \n\n“Did he tell you something, Doc?” I tried to read him. My eyes, full of bleary, trackless scorn against his—piteous and measured. “Huh? Some little fucked confession? Something?”\n\n“Paul, I cannot comment on my conversations with Eddie or any of my patients. You know that. But it might help you to talk about your other son. Cooper.”\n\nI would not cry in front of this man. \n\n“Fuck that.”\n\n“Untended grief can be a cancer, Paul.”\n\n“Eddie is a cancer! And *you*—you were supposed to fucking diagnose him! But you fucking failed and now, my son’s blood is on your hands too!”\n\nAnother sigh to match my untethered rage. Prick. \n\n“Perhaps if you journaled your true feelings. It might—“\n\n“Your journals put my wife in a cell. What about Eddie’s journal? I didn’t find it. He hides it. Why would he do that? Why? What do you fucking know?”\n\nHe had a pack of fresh journals on his desk. Another in front of him among his tidy collection of pompous little trinkets. I’d brought mine with me out of habit. It was almost empty. And a moment later, I pulled it out and tossed it onto the desk. \n\n“You wanna read mine, doc? Maybe you can see how I feel. We could have a heart to heart. Grab a beer. And you can tell me how it’s not so fucking bad.”  \n\nHe sat motionless. I wanted him to cower. To feel my anger. I had felt like pummeling him so many times, just because I didn’t like him. Now, I might’ve hated him. I hated Eddie. I hated myself. I needed Rachel. I missed my son. \n\n“He’ll kill again. You know that right?”\n\n“Paul, why do you think it is that you are the only one who demonizes your son?”\n\n“What?”\n\n“You talk about his behavior issues, but does anyone else see them?  His teachers? His friends’ parents? Anyone?”\n\n“He’s good at hiding it. He’s a pathological liar. An actor.”\n\n“How has he been recently?”\n\n“Nice. Fake.”\n\n“You see that as a ruse, but it was only after we began to discuss abuse—only after confronting that subject—that Eddie changed.”\n\nWhat the fuck was he getting at? I wasn’t the problem. \n\n“You love your wife, Paul?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“It can be…difficult to reconcile a love of someone with the things they do, particularly where their actions seem unthinkable. Perception can sometimes find a path of least resistance to separate that love from the reality we observe.”\n\n“*No*.” Eddie was the monster. Rachel never touched him. She would never hurt her children. \n\n“Paul, the reason we have therapists isn’t solely expertise. We are remarkably poor at viewing ourselves objectively.”\n\n“Stop.”\n\n“I really wanted to address this issue more organically than this. Delusional thought processes are such a fragile—“\n\n“SHUT YOUR FUCKING MOUTH!”\n\nI was standing, but I hadn’t remembered rising to my feet. My fists clenched, fingernails stinging my palms as my hands vibrated. And all I could think of was Rachel in her navy blue jumpsuit and her orange plastic sandals, staring at me from across a table that was bolted to the floor. She deserved none of it, and I felt like Doctor Foster deserved a broken face, but I didn’t hit him. I snatched my stupid fucking journal off of his desk and I seethed. \n\n“Fuck you, Doctor. I won’t be back.”\n\nHe stared as I left. I slammed the door and swept his happy pamphlets onto the ground. \n\n—\n\nCrybaby mommy. Quiet daddy for ever. Soft like pillows full of fethers. Pick them one by one. CRY CRY CRY. \n\n—\n\nAlone, I felt everything that anger tends to hide. Our house was quiet. Rachel’s wind chimes outside, the hiss of a toilet I’d meant to fix, the scrape of a bottle against the coffee table. For so long, quiet is all I’d wanted. But not like this. \n\nThe house still had the imprint of a crime scene investigation. Books and papers askew, a set of muddy footprints across the carpet. I hadn’t been back upstairs except to look for Eddie’s journal. He’d taken down the pillow fort on his bed, stripped off the sheets and shredded each one of his stuffed animals. He’d piled fur and fluff on the center of his mattress. And however many people had gone into his room on the day Cooper died, not one had thought the scene strange enough to second guess Eddie’s traumatized little act. \n\nI’d been sleeping on the sofa. My work told me to take time. They understood. Hollow words. Fake like Eddie. \n\nAnd Cooper…\n\nI just felt empty when I thought of him. I missed his smallness, the way he looked around, wondrous and happy. He died before he could walk. He’d never held my hand to steady his little steps. He would never beg me to chase him around the playground. Eddie took all of that. Rachel had lost that and Eddie took her too. But me—he left. He could’ve told them that I had hit him. But he didn’t. I’m convinced that he left me because he knew that my solitude would be cruelest. \n\nI didn’t feel like drinking anymore. I was too drunk already and it didn’t help except to pass out and wake miserably just to do it all again. In spite of my feelings about Doctor Foster, my mocking little journal felt like something to try, if only to fill the time. So I searched the mess that my drunken grief had made and found the little blue book between the sofa cushions. It opened at its little red bookmark as I set it down. And I saw a page full of writing. It wasn’t my journal. \n\nIt was Eddie’s. I had missed it. How?\n\nNo. Unimportant. \n\nIt was Eddie’s sloppy child’s scrawl I saw and I could finally read the thoughts he’d tried to hide. \n\nThe journal started with a war. It ended with—\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHe’d dressed the walls with flesh and clotted blood, carpeted the floor with entrails, bound the bones as beams with sinew and lengths of silky hair. The church’s facade he’d left bare—skeletal white tapering to a pointed spire. Amidst the bloody blankets, it looked almost like a tooth. \n\nNameis gazed upon it with awe. He had known beauty of all sorts. He had seen it in the red carnage of war. He had heard it in the screams of his godless captives. But he had never known its perfection until now. \n\nNameis the Divine. Eddie the Blessed. Brothers who had beckoned their holy parentage through rites of savagery and devotion, loveliness and pain. Their work was at an end. \n\nEddie laid the final pieces of the altar as Nameis watched. He’d chosen skulls and ribs and fingers bones—a many faced idol with curving wings that once held hearts and lovers’ hands. Nameis didn’t need to understand it all to know its worth. He knew the important parts. The altar would bring a sacrifice. The sacrifice would end the war. Their peace would please their god. \n\nWhen it was finished, Eddie rested and Nameis waited. \n\nAnd waited. And waited. \n\nWhere was their sacrifice? he wondered. Their god?\n\n“Both are already here,” Eddie answered.\n\nBut Nameis hadn’t spoken his thought aloud. \n\n“No thought is as quiet as death, Lieutenant Nameis. Death hears all. The beat of your heart, the flow of your veins, the tick of the time you have left.”\n\nBut they were brothers…\n\n“Death stood beside the firstborn of this world. Waiting. Patient. What brother could death have when none were born outside his gaze?”\n\nNameis thought he understood. The god he awaited was death. And death was Eddie. And Nameis was…\n\n“Both are already here.” Eddie repeated. God and sacrifice. Eddie and Nameis.\n\nAnd then Nameis saw. The church wasn’t a church. It was a tomb. \n\n“Yes.”\n\n“But what of the war, Eddie?” Nameis asked aloud. “How does it end?”\n\n“The war remains un-won til only one remains.”\n\nSolemnly, Nameis nodded. There were no more soldiers left to fight the war but he. His death would bring an everlasting peace. He understood that, but he was frightened.\n\n“Will there be pain?” \n\n“There will be an end.” Eddie answered. “And everything that came before will fade.”\n\nNameis knew what his faith demanded. He knelt before the altar, before Eddie—his first disciple, his last companion. And as those blessed hands began their final work of artistry, he sang a song for no one but his patient god of \n\n—\n\n“Paul?”\n\nThe voice scared the absolute shit out of me. \n\n“Wha-what the fuck are you doing in my house?!”\n\nMy words slurred as I peeled myself off of the sofa. It took me a moment to get my bearings.\n\n“I’ve been knocking, Paul. You didn’t answer so I tried the door. It was unlocked.”\n\nDoctor Foster stood, hands clasped behind his back, patient prickish concern across his face. He looked fastidious as ever in his camel coat and pressed blue trousers and I knew I looked like shit without needing the comparison. I must have passed out again. I had been drinking. Reading something… *Eddie’s journal*.  \n\n“Where is it?”\n\n“Where is what?” \n\n“The journal. Nameis and Eddie the god of death and—and the war. It was right—“\n\nI found it on the floor. “Here.”\n\n“God of death?” Incredulous. “Paul…”\n\n“He must have told you, Doc!  You’re so fucking professional. Keeping secrets that killed my—“\n\nI opened the book.  A folded bundle of pages fell from between the blank ones and back onto the floor. *My* writing filled half of a page with half of a thought. It was *my journal*.  But where was—\n\n“*By mid-winter the war was already lost. The soldiers mustered rank and file*—Paul. Is *this* your war? Leftenant Nameis and…Captain Casco?”\n\nHe held the creased pages in his hands. \n\n“That is Eddie’s story! Not mine!”\n\nHe looked at the pages for a moment more and then handed them back to me. They were *typed*? But they couldn’t be.  I had seen Eddie’s writing. I had. \n\n“Paul, Eddie is a bright boy, but he’s nine years old. Look at the writing. It’s beyond his skill.”\n\nNo. He was wrong. “Eddie, he—he tricked me, the police. He tricked you too. About the arm. The girl—Tansy. He’s not what he seems, Doc. ”\n\n“I will concede that Eddie’s behavior in our sessions seems a touch…forced.”\n\n“Yes!”\n\n“But he knows that you are taking him to me because there’s a problem. And it’s not unusual for difficult children to be less so in the presence of an outsider. Our relationships are very different things to him.”\n\nNo. Why did they always fucking take his side? He was a murderer; he killed my son. I’d seen—I’d seen him walking away with blood on his hands. But that was enough. Rachel wouldn’t hurt Cooper. She wouldn’t. His death had destroyed her. And she—if I had her with me I could confirm the worst parts. If I had her with me I could feel normal. Sane. \n\nI slumped back onto the sofa. I wanted her. I didn’t want Doctor Foster. Why was he here?”\n\n“Why are you here, Doc?  Why did you come?”\n\n“You’re alone. And your family is broken and believe it or not Paul, I care about your outcome.”  He glanced at the bottle on the table. He wasn’t subtle. “Water might be a good place to start. I’ll get you a glass.”\n\nI murmured my acceptance as he left for the back of our house. \n\nI wasn’t okay. I knew that. But I didn’t see how okay was going to happen for me. Either my son was a murderer or I was crazy and…my wife was. I unfolded the pages and read again. I barely knew the story. How the fuck could it be mine?  Captain Casco. Lieu—\n\n*Lef*tenant. \n\nDoctor Foster had pronounced it like a Brit. And the day that Cooper died, as we hid in our room and Eddie pounded on the door, Eddie had pronounced it that way too. *Leftenant* Nameis. He’d screamed it through the door and I thought nothing of it because I was trying not to think at all. I stared blankly at the first page of the story, read idly as I parsed the coincidence. \n\n*Captain Casco had fallen three nights prior but the fighting hadn’t ebbed long enough for an official change in command. If Nameis had stopped for his moment of self congratulatory pomp, it would have been for his honour alone.* \n\nHonour. \n\nLike a Brit. I hadn’t written it… Doctor Foster had, and Eddie—Eddie must’ve copied it down. *Leftenant*. Eddie couldn’t have read a pronunciation on a page. Had Doctor Foster read it to him? A story about the beauty of violence and a boy named Eddie who became a god of death. Where was Foster?\n\n“Doc?”\n\nHe didn’t answer. I stood and stumbled toward the kitchen. \n\n“Doctor Foster?”\n\nHe wasn’t there. The glass of water was. Sitting next to the sink. Where would he have gone?  The backdoor was locked. Perhaps the bathroom? The pantry?  My eyes roved toward the bathroom door first, brushed over the kitchen island, followed a habit, counted the knives. \n\nOne too few. *Fuck*.\n\n“Paul?”\n\nI spun around at the sound of his voice and the creak of the pantry door, I saw the metal in his hand. He stepped, I reacted, reached for his hand, missed and grabbed the blade as he lurched toward me. I expected pain—something sharp. I winced reflexively. But as my hand squeezed, I felt *a handle*.  Doctor Foster had been holding the blade. \n\nAnd his blood now coated it as I pulled back the knife.\n\n“Paul—you—“\n\nHe stumbled back. Reached in his pocket for his phone. \n\nBut—No. \n\n“Hello? I need help. I’ve been stabbed by a patient.”\n\nHe was holding the blade. He wrote the story. He—\n\n“—Fernhill Lane. His name is Paul George.”\n\nNot me. I didn’t do anything wrong. He planned it; made me stab him. \n\nEach truthful word I thought to say echoed like a lie. They wouldn’t believe me. I knew that. And they didn’t. And they still don’t. \n\nThe doctors at Clinton Mental Health Corrections Center, the orderlies, the patients. None of them believe a word of it. But I know the truth now. Eddie is a psychopath. He’s just good at hiding it because session after session he sat in a side room of an office and learned to lie from a man just like him. A psychiatrist who recognized his reflection in Eddie’s eyes and then groomed him to kill. I know that’s right. It’s the simplest explanation. \n\nDoctor Foster was the one who convinced them to let me keep the story of Lieutenant Nameis and the boy. (Complete with Eddie’s psychotic ramblings in the margins). He said it would help me distinguish between the written fantasy and reality. Prick. \n\nHe took my son, my wife, our freedom. Everything. And he left me with a shitty computer and limited online time in the aging library of a loony bin. And he left me a story because it was always about him—Nameis who taught a boy how to kill. Nameis whose task was only ever to destroy. \n\nWell, I used the computer to write, to remember as much as I can about the truth. I posted it here hoping that someone would believe me. Rachel believes me. She tells me during our phone calls and I tell her that I still love her, that I need her like she needs me. But I don’t tell her about the fear. I don’t tell her about the visits. I keep quiet about my Saturdays, when in the afternoons, I look out the window and see them standing in the shade of a maple tree, looking back at me. Smiling. \n\nFoster and Eddie. \n\nNameis and his patient [god of death](https://www.reddit.com/r/decogent/comments/v85m4g/you_found_me/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)",

        "text": " \n\nIt is their fault after all.  They just would not shut up.  They kept on running their mouth without the consideration of others.  So many rumors have been spread because of them, and yet they do not seem to care.  If they only paid attention to what their words are doing to us, they would have probably continued without a moment of hesitation.  I highly doubt they care about anyone but themself.\n\nAs soon as I found them alone, I sneaked up on them.  I was able to grab them from behind and press a cloth of chloroform on their nose and mouth.  They were out before they could see who their attacker was.  The hard part was basically getting them to the car and in my basement.  They deserved this; they crossed the line with their excessive chatter.\n\nThey spilled extreme classified information that a vulnerable me had shared with them.  Instead of keeping their promise to keep quiet about it they decided to blab to everyone.  I thought they were my friend.  That is why I put up with their loose lips before.  They were supposed to be my trusted confidant, but they were nothing more than a traitor.\n\nI was able to bring them up on the surgical chair and strap them down, so they would not move.  They should be waking up soon, and the real punishment can begin.  It is too bad it had to end up like this, but like I said; they are at fault.  They cannot escape the consequences of their actions after all.  Maybe even learn to never speak about someone else again.\n\nAfter finally waking up, they questioned where they were.  I had to explain what was going on and what was going to happen.  The poor person was so pitiful.  Begging and crying for me to let them go and that they won’t tell anyone about this, but I know better now.  They will just go to the police and have me arrested.  Well too bad they will not be able to leave ever again.\n\nI carefully threaded the needle with string and got to work on their mouth.  The way their screams of pain and other pointless noises slowly died down.  It was a glorious moment to finally get them to shut up.  I did not want to stop.  I brought out my favorite scalpel.  It will be my last time with it after all.  I began to remove their eyes; the muffled screams of theirs were just too humorous.\n\nIt was time for me to go upstairs and wait for the police to come collect me.  They may or may not be dead before they get to them.  I had a good run.  But they will be my last victim.  They deserved this for ratting me out to the FBI.  The only thing that I can think of is that why they have to put a stop to my fun.  I was even hoping to have a partner in crime.  I guess I should never have trusted a blabbermouth with my deadly secret.",

        "text": "  As far as I can remember, me and Isaac have always been best friends. I don’t remember how we met; it was so long ago. According to my parents, he was adopted by the pastor as a toddler. One day, we just became inseparable. \n\nI glanced at the photos stuck to my bulletin board with colorful pins. They were photos of Issac and I, depicting everything my parents considered a milestone. The two of us riding our tiny bikes for the first time, our first day in middle school (we thought we looked so cool, what a couple of dorks), us passed out after a sugar rush on Halloween. Isaac’s dad didn’t let him go trick-or-treating, so I always shared my candy with him at the end of the night. \n\nMy trip down memory lane was interrupted by my mom’s voice yelling from downstairs. \n\n“Isaac's waiting! You don’t want to be late for your first day!”\n\n“I swear you grew like a foot over the summer”, I said as me and Isaac climbed out of my mom’s car. \n\n“Maybe you’ve just shrunk?” Isaac, laughed. He’d always been the tallest in our grade, we’d made a game out of betting on how long it took the school basketball coach to try and scout him. \n\nHis silver bracelet shone in the sun as he ran a hand through his hair. I looked down at my own matching one. We’d bought them together, using money from our summer jobs. They were nicer versions of those cheap broken-heart ones that said ‘best friends’ in some terrible font. \n\n“Oh, did you see Gabe?” I asked, noticing he was still trying to fix his hair. “Listen if you don’t ask him out this year-“, I was cut off by Issac punching my shoulder. “Asshole…”, I dryly gasped, smiling despite the pain. \n\n“Shut up! I’ll try and ask him to homecoming…”, he whispered. The two of us walked to the morning assembly. A sharp metallic whine filled the packed auditorium as the principal tapped his microphone.  \n\n“Welcome Seniors! I know you’re all really excited for all the parties this year, but remember; don’t stay out too late”, the man said, a strained smile on his face. Normally, a small town like ours was pretty safe, but 3 years ago people started disappearing. It had started with our crazy neighbor; he’d point his hunting rifle at Isaac and I if we ever bent a blade of grass on his lawn. As the years went on, the numbers went up to 2-4 people disappearing per month. The town-wide search parties were always fruitless, like the person had just been swallowed up by the ground. I felt something rubbery hit the back of my skull, an eraser. A look behind me showed the school’s resident troublemaker, Brent, with a satisfied smile on his face. The guy chose someone new to pick on every year and it seemed like it was my turn, great. \n\n“He’s only doing it because you didn’t want to go the summer bash with him, what a dick”, Issac scoffed, taking the eraser from me, and snapping it in half, making sure that Brent saw. \n\n“I had food poisoning! I wasn’t going at all”, I whispered back, cursing my naïve self for eating gas-station sushi. \n\nBrent kept pestering me the following week: throwing balled-up papers with insults written on them, trying to take my lunch money, all that classic bully stuff. \n\n“He’s not very creative”, Isaac said, biting into his dry cafeteria burger. I nodded, noticing a familiar guy approaching our table.\n\n“Gabriel”, I greeted, watching Isaac's ears turn pink.  \n\n“Charlie”, he greeted back, tipping a non-existent hat. He turned to Issac with a smile, who, unlike in English class, tried his best not to look directly at him. \n\n“It’s a shame about Saturday, but text me when you’re free”, Gabe said, resting his freckled hand on Issac’s shoulder for a few seconds, before walking off to his friends. I turned to Issac, who seemed to be analyzing the nutritional label on his Gatorade. \n\n“The guy who you’ve been crushing on since 5th grade asked you out, and you said no?” I asked. Isaac’s brows were furrowed, he sighed.\n\n“My dad says I can’t be out at night, you know that”, he said. It was true, his dad wouldn’t let us have sleepovers at my house, we always had to be in Isaac’s apartment, right above the church. \n\n“Not even for this? Can’t you just tell your dad-“, I was cut off by Isaac slamming his hand onto the table.\n\n“No, I can’t!” He spoke loudly, Isaac had always been a calm guy, I was worried, something serious had to be happening. “Sorry…can we just not talk about it, please?” he asked, voice weaker. I nodded and the rest of our lunch break went on in awkward silence.\n\nBrent hadn’t been at school for a whole week. It wasn’t unlike him to skip class, but no one had even seen him on campus. He was reported missing by his parents that weekend, the usual routine began. Search parties in town and the surrounding woods always came back with bowed heads and flickering hope. He was a pest and a bully, but I couldn’t be happy about him being gone. \n\nIsaac was sick, he hadn’t been at school, and he’d stopped responding to my texts. I tried going to the church to see him, but the pastor ushered me away, saying that his son needed to rest. Something felt off, Issac would occasionally get sick, but he’d be back quickly, and the pastor’s nervous gaze didn’t help. I knew where the extra key was hidden, behind a wooden crucifix on the wall. The pastor was gone, and I let myself in. \n\nThere were dishes in the sink, one plate and one set of cutlery. \n\nHis room was completely empty, and not just because he wasn’t there. All of Isaac’s posters were taken down, his dresser was barren, and his bed had no sheets on it. I tried to calm myself, tried to rationalize everything, maybe he was on his way to my house because he was feeling better? Maybe all of this was just because his room needed new paint? As I exited the apartment, the old key to the church basement caught my eye. I didn’t know why at the time, but I instinctively grabbed it. \n\nI’d never been in the basement before, me and Isaac had tried to sneak the key to steal some communion wine, we got caught and were both grounded. The old stairs creaked as I walked down, squinting in the dark. The basement was only one square room, with a bit of yellow light given by a hanging bulb. Half of the room was sectioned off by thick metal bars, and I could make out a silhouette behind them. \n\nIt was Isaac, but at the same time, it wasn’t.\n\nHe still had his dark hair, but it was tousled and knotted, his long legs bent unnaturally backwards. They weren’t legs at all, he had hooves like a goat. His skin was the same, but dark and coarse fur covered most of it. Long, swirling horns protruded from his head, blood at their base like they’d torn through his skull. The worst part was his eyes, they weren’t the warm brown ones I knew, they were completely pitch black. He looked at me, if he recognized me, he couldn’t say it, all that came out was a low snarl. Somehow, I knew that he wasn’t threatening me, he was begging for help. Quick footsteps sounded on the stairs, I turned around to see the pastor and my parents. \n\nMy mom tried holding my hand as my dad sat me down on a chair in the corner. I twisted my hand out of hers. \n\n“This is going to sound crazy but Isaac is a demon”, my dad explained, though it raised a million more questions. \n\n“You were very sick as a kid and your father and I tried everything, but you just didn’t get better…we were desperate so we found someone who knew about another way, if you shared your soul with a demon child, everything would be fine” my mom keep her head down, she looked guilty “but we didn’t think about the consequences when we summoned Isaac”, she sighed. The pastor took over, not even looking at his son.\n\n“Isaac had to eat, and we found out that demons eat humans, it started when he turned 14, and we let it go on for too long, all those people who went missing…”, the man said. It all made sense now, the disappearances and Issac always getting sick after they happened. \n\n“He’s only taken people who are mean to you…we think it has something to do with the bond”, my dad said, trying to convince himself that it made things better. \n\n“Does he know?” I asked, my voice shaking as I looked over to Isaac. He always tapped his foot when he was trying not to be scared, the clicking of his hoof made my head hurt. \n\n“No, he knows what he is, but he doesn’t know what he’s been doing, and it’s gotten out of hand”, the pastor said, finally acknowledging his kid. As if on cue, more people came into the basement, all carrying books and crosses. \n\n“Don’t worry, they’re just going to send him back, it’s not like in those exorcist movies”, my dad spoke, I couldn’t believe he thought that it was a good time to try and be funny. The phrase echoed in my head ‘send him back’, I could guess where that meant.\n\n“This is where he belongs, he doesn’t know anything else! You can find a way to fix it, he’s your son!” I yelled to the pastor, who was washing his hand in a bowl of water. I thought he’d be crying, I thought he’d feel regret. \n\nHis face was completely calm as he turned to me, like being Isaac’s dad for 13 years meant absolutely nothing. \n\n“Charlie, he is a devil, he should have never been brought to this world, any affection you feel for him is solely because your parents made that deal, I’m sorry”, those words betrayed his expression. My dad and another pastor held me back as I yelled out Isaac’s name until my throat felt raw.\n\nThey drew a symbol on the floor, Isaac tried to fight them off as they brought him to it, but their hands, washed in blessed water, seemed to burn him. He was thrown into the middle of the circle, chanting filled the room as the concrete floor started opening, revealing an endless crimson void. Before he fell, Isaac turned to look at me one last time, all of our life together flashed through my head. \n\nWe were playing pretend in the forest, we were building sandcastles, we were celebrating birthdays, we were staying up all night playing video games, we were psyching each other up to give our crushes valentines, we were planning to be roommates in college. \n\nAs the ground beneath his feet crumbled away, I saw him mouth my name, the chanting drowning out his words.\n\nThen he fell.\n\nI choose a college far away and almost completely cut contact with my parents, I was different without him, I felt like a half of something. He wouldn’t have wanted me to waste my life sulking though, so I kept my head up.\n\nI have my own kid now, she just turned five. She keeps telling me that today has been the best birthday ever, but I’ve actually saved the best for last. I carry her on my hip to the garage, her birthday present dangling from her wrist, too big to fit properly. The shine of the silver bracelet makes me smile as I set her down. \n\n“Sweetheart, this is a very special birthday today, do you know why?” I asked, kneeling to be at eye level with her. \n\n“Because I saw a giraffe!” She excitedly answers, referencing our earlier visit to the zoo. I laugh and reach out to tussle her hair. \n\n“That was special too, but I have one last super special gift”, I stand up and reach over to grab a book from the shelf. It’s old, with a ripped leather cover and yellow pages, I found it at my parents’ house on my last rare visit. I flicker through it and see the rounded symbol; I grab some chalk and begin drawing on the garage floor. My daughter is watching me with piqued interest, she loves drawing in our driveway. She’s my everything and I only want the best for her, and I know what’s best, I know how to ensure that she’s safe and that she will always have someone to rely on. \n\n“Today is the day that you get to meet your new best friend”.",

        "text": " Hey, y’all. Just wanted to give you a quick update before we get into today’s story.\n\nFirst of all, I’m sorry it’s been a while. I definitely never intend to go so long without posting, but sometimes when you’re hit with the solid comorbidity of seasonal depression and executive dysfunction, that’s just the way it is. I’m never going to promise any type of schedule because I know myself and I know I won’t stick to it, but I will say that I’ll try to be more consistent.\n\nSecond, I *do* have new information regarding the donations we received [a couple posts back](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/z71gzx/i_work_at_the_night_library_sometimes_we_get/), and while it’s not what we’re here to talk about this time, I promise we will very soon. So stay tuned for that.\n\nLastly, Sam is doing really well. He still doesn’t remember a lick of his life before the events of [our last installment](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/102na3z/i_work_at_the_night_library_we_have_a_new_employee/), and I think that’s for the better. He’s a hell of a worker; never complains or protests, just does what’s asked of him and does it well. \n\nI’ve learned over the course of his time with us that while his memories are gone, his personality and interests are still fully fleshed-out. He likes music. All of it. I keep trying to come up with god-awful songs to play for him that’ll break the pattern, but his response is unfailingly, “Oh, a new one!” followed by a horribly uncoordinated little jig. \n\nHe also likes movies, but not so much new ones as absolutely ancient noir films. He’ll happily watch whatever you put on, though. \n\nHis true passion, however, is cooking. If you can call it that. The problem is that none of it has *any* goddamn right turning out *so good.* Sometimes local food pantries donate surplus groceries to us, and a lot of it goes to our patrons with food insecurities but whatever’s left typically ends up in our staff kitchen until it rots. That’s where Sam comes in. \n\nIt started one night when we were deader than dead and Wiley was complaining about being both hungry and too lazy to go out and get something.\n\n“I can make you something!” Sam volunteered enthusiastically. “I love to cook.”\n\n“Oh.” Wiley blinked, clearly somewhat taken aback. “Uh. Thanks, but I don’t—I don’t think we have any, like, *actual* food here.”\n\nSam waved a hand dismissively. “I’ll find something. It’ll be good. Promise.” And then he disappeared into the break room.\n\nAbout half an hour later, he returned with a large bowl. Inside it was god only knew what. I don’t even know what to liken the sight to other than an AI generated image. No part of it was discernible. It was an amalgamation of various textures and shades of beige mush, and Sam handed it to Wiley, positively beaming.\n\nWiley eyed it, trying their best to contain their apprehension. \n\nBless him, Sam burst out laughing. “Okay, I know,” he said. “I know it looks *so* gross. But it’s good! It’s a scramble. Oh, god, hold on, I didn’t even ask—you eat meat, right?”\n\n“I. Yeah. I eat meat,” Wiley assured him, still clearly slightly stunned. \n\n“Okay, good*.* There’s sausage in there.”\n\nTentatively, Wiley took a bite. I could see them cycling through emotions, and the moment the taste truly set in was visible on their face. “Holy shit. Wait. Adam. You gotta try this.”\n\nI’ll be honest, I had no idea whether they were about to ruin my life or not, but because I didn’t want Sam to think I didn’t trust him, I accepted the bowl, lifting a small forkful to my lips.\n\nIt was *stupid*. Ridiculous. Otherworldly. \n\n“What did you *do* to this?” I asked, reluctantly handing it back to Wiley. I didn’t *want* to. I *wanted* to keep eating it.\n\n“It’s the love, man!” Sam said jovially. “Everything tastes better when you’re cooking with love.”\n\nSo, that was that. And now it’s just a common occurrence. Sam’s been cooking for pretty much all of us pretty much every night, and he seems thrilled to be doing it, which is fine by the rest of us.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, during one such instance, I was in the break room with him, just hanging out while he made a mess of the entire stove, and he said, “So, question.”\n\n“Answer,” I replied. \n\nHe contemplated a moment, seemingly determining what angle he wanted to take. “Doug. Is he—I mean, do we, like—*know?* People talk about him sometimes, but I can’t tell how serious anyone is. And I know this place is weird, so I just. I don’t know. I was wondering about it. Him.”\n\nI could feel myself freezing up from the inside out. Though Sam doesn’t remember the events that landed him here, he’s been just as privy to the goings on of the library as the rest of us since he came aboard; no matter how hard Matt tries to protect us all from the truth, it hasn’t worked out once. \n\n“Um,” I said.\n\nSam put down the spatula in his hand, turning his attention fully toward me. “Um?”\n\nI ducked my head, scratching the back of my neck. “It’s…complicated. But he’s—it’s—yeah. He exists.”\n\nAlready, I could see him backtracking. He shook his head, turning away from me and back toward the stovetop. “Sorry—if you don’t wanna talk about it, that's totally cool. I was just curious.”\n\nThere’s something about Sam that makes causing him to experience negative emotions, especially toward himself, unbearable. So I sighed and pushed myself up onto the countertop, leaning against the cabinet behind me. \n\n“I met him,” I began. “Once. A long time ago. And hopefully I never will again.”\n\n“Oh.” Sam said it casually, with enough nonchalance to make it obvious that he was trying with everything in his power not to pressure me. To ask why.\n\n“It was the only thing that’s ever *really* made me consider leaving, which is kind of funny if you put it into perspective. It wasn’t life-threatening in the slightest. He didn’t lay a finger on me. I’m probably in more danger eating whatever you’re concocting than I was with him.”\n\n“Hey!” Sam defended, nudging me with his elbow. “I am a wizard with a whisk. A spatula sorcerer. A mixer maestro. A…a…”\n\n“Okay, that’s enough,” I snorted, cutting him off before it could get inevitably worse. “Anyway, point is, technically, it was probably the safest I’ve ever been around anything…*unusual* here. But I’d rather take a full shift of books flying off the shelves with the power clean out any day.”\n\nSam swiped a finger through the thick, orange sauce that had gathered into a film along the side of the pan, then licked it and made a face, picking up an unmarked shaker of something green and presumably dried. “So, what, did he, like, say something to you? Something bad?”\n\nI took a breath, steeling myself. “It was a couple years ago now. Pretty quiet night, and I think it was just me, Jenny, and Alice here. I’d been in the back working on some repairs and I got up to go to the bathroom after a couple hours—”\n\n“‘Cause you have a caffeine problem,” Sam butted in.\n\n“—’cause I have a caffeine problem,” I assented, pushing on. “So I pee, wash my hands, whatever, and when I look up at the mirror, there’s somebody standing behind me. Some guy. I kind of startle, ‘cause I didn’t hear him come in, but there’s nothing inherently creepy about him except that he’s just, like. *There.* And he’s making full eye contact with me. Or, well, his reflection’s making eye contact with mine, I guess. I’m thinking maybe he needs help or something until I *really* take in the whole picture and realize he’s got on a nametag. It says ‘Doug.’ Left to right. Just like if he was standing in front of me. But he’s *not.”*\n\n“Oooh, ‘cause it’s a *reflection,* so his name should be—got it, got it. That’s fucked. Okay, go on.”\n\n“Right. It should be backwards. And I’m not wearing one, but *I’m* still backwards, so I know it’s not just some weird shit with the mirror. But I know who he is, obviously, and I know what the rules say I’m supposed to do, so it should be fine. I turn around, ready to greet him, but it’s just…empty air. Nobody’s in the room with me. Back to the mirror, and boom. There he is. Right over my shoulder.\n\n“So I’m just looking at him, and he’s looking at me, and I don’t know if protocol here is that I make the first move or not, but after a couple seconds, he says, *“Hi, I’m Doug!”* It’s loud, too. And coming from behind me, not from the mirror. \n\n*“Hey!”* I say, and then, because I’m supposed to, *“I know who you are, man. We’ve worked together quite a while now.”*\n\n*“Oh,”* he says, right on cue—does a whole theatrical facepalm and everything. *“So sorry, my memory is just dreadful.”*\n\n*“No big deal,”* I tell him. *“It happens.”* And then I wait. You know, to see if he goes away. Because according to the rules, he might. But he doesn’t.\n\n“Instead, he goes, *“Hey, just between coworkers, I’ve been a little nervous about my job performance lately. Do you think I’ve been pulling my weight?”*\n\n*“Whoa, are you kidding?”* I ask. I’m playing it up a little. Not really sure how enthusiastic I’m supposed to be, or if it even matters, but it’s usually smarter to err on the side of unmistakably positive. *“Dude, I don’t know what we’d ever do without you. You’re a hundred percent irreplaceable.”*\n\n“He smiles at me. It’s weird. A little off. Like, you know that AI, Sophia? She sort of only emotes with one part of her face at a time. It was like that. Nothing going on in his eyes. Just the grin.”\n\n“Ew,” Sam said. He’d moved on to another portion of his entree now, heating up vegetable oil in a large stockpot. “Okay, but that’s supposed to be the end of it, right? That’s all it says in the rules.”\n\n“Supposed to be,” I echoed, nodding solemnly. “But it wasn’t. Sometimes the rules are just—they’re Matt’s best educated guess. Sometimes that means they’re foolproof. Sometimes it means he took a shot in the dark and we pray whatever situation we’re in doesn’t deviate from the textbook.”\n\nSam laughed, quiet, through his nose. “You mean like me?”\n\nI paused. Sam didn’t know what had happened or where he’d come from—not exactly—but he did know it wasn’t under ordinary circumstances. We told him he’d just sort of stumbled in and collapsed, because it was the shortest, easiest explanation we could give him without causing him any grief for a family he’d never remember and who would never remember him. As far as he knew, he was a John Doe. We said the only thing he’d managed to tell us was his first name before he hit the ground. \n\n“Yeah,” was what I settled on, swinging my foot to the side to gently kick him in the thigh. “Except we got lucky with you. Usually when something comes up that’s not in the rules at all it’s deadly at best.”\n\n“What if I’m, like, *sooo* dangerous and nobody even knows it?” he chuckled, and then gasped, looking up from the pot before him to meet my eyes. “What if *I* don’t even know it? Holy shit. Maybe I have superpowers.”\n\n“You do,” I said. “I’ve never met anybody in my life that can go so long without shutting up.”\n\nHe glared at me, but there was no fire behind it. “Whatever. Keep going.”\n\nI kept going.\n\n“So, I tell Doug he’s great at his job, and I expect him to leave me alone. Or maybe vanish, since we’re still just talking through a mirror. But he doesn’t. He’s just staring at me with that creepy ass smile, and I’m afraid to look away. I don’t really know why, but it feels like the *wrong* thing to do, so I don’t. I just keep staring back. Until I realize something: dude’s not blinking. And I haven’t been either. But I’m going to have to. I know that. Eventually, it’ll just happen, no matter how hard I try to force it not to. And I don’t know why I hate the idea of that so much, but something in the back of my mind is just telling me I *have* to keep up eye contact. So I do, for as long as I can, but then it happens. \n\n“I blink.\n\n“I don’t even think a blink takes a quarter of a second. That’s how fast he’s in front of me. I can barely see my own reflection now; he’s blocking too much of it. There still isn’t anyone physically in the room with me. Nobody’s standing there. But his reflection looks like he’s practically nose-to-nose with the mirror. Which shouldn’t even be possible, considering where the sink is, but he’s *so* close to it, and it gives me a better look at his teeth. \n\n“They’re still bared, still doing the *most* to make me believe they’re smiling, but there’s a little gap between the two in the front, and something keeps barely poking in and out of it. It’s fleshy and thin and I can’t really get a good look at it until, finally, it just kind of. *Slithers.* Far enough out that it’s clear what it is.\n\n“A worm. Not an earthworm or a mealworm—like some kind of parasite. And if some shit like that doesn’t make you want to recoil, I don’t know what will. But I can’t do that, because according to recent historical events, shit gets worse if I’m not watching. So I’m watching like a *hawk*, metaphorically shitting myself, and then this thing starts *vibrating.”*\n\n“Dude,” Sam whined, “not the vibrating mouth parasite while I’m literally cooking.”\n\n“I can stop talking about it anytime,” I warned. “You’re the one that wanted to have this conversation.”\n\nGroaning, he scrubbed a hand over his face. “Okay. Fine. I have to know the rest now.”\n\n“Yeah, I figured I wasn’t gonna get that lucky. \n\n“So, the worm is vibrating. And I realize, now that I can see it more closely, Doug’s mouth isn’t really moving the way it should be to form the words he’s saying. It’s just kind of being jostled around by the worm. Open and shut. But I can understand him clear as day.\n\n*“Oh, I wouldn’t say* irreplaceable,” is what comes out. *“I’ve replaced my suit more times than you’d believe. When one rots, another rises. And that’s my job—riding the cycle. But you know that, of course! My, we* have *been working together for some time now, haven’t we? I nearly didn’t recognize you in* your *new suit. It certainly does become you, Adam.”*\n\n“Whoa, hold *on.”* I had Sam’s full attention now, frying be damned. *“What?”*\n\nI was shaking a little. From either the adrenaline or the anxiety of recounting the story for only the second time ever; I couldn’t be sure which. “Yeah,” I said. “I don’t fucking know. I booked it the fuck out of there and never told anybody but Matt. He said the…the *things* in this place, they’ll do whatever they can to *really* get to us when they want to. They’re good at getting in our heads. Targeting our humanity, so to speak. Whatever it was doing, it fucking worked. Scared the hell out of me. Took me a while to get back with the program and believe I was a person again.”\n\nI could practically hear the wheels turning in Sam’s head. \n\n“Hey,” I said, snapping him out of it. *“You’re* not a parasitic demon worm driving a meat suit either. You’ve just got amnesia. You know who gets amnesia? Humans.”\n\n“Yeah, but I don’t…” He stopped, chewing on the inside of his lip. “I don’t *care.* That can’t be normal, right? Like, I should *want* to know what happened to me. But I don’t. And I think if I found out, I’d just…I don’t know. I can’t imagine wanting to leave. For anything. Why do you think that is?”\n\nI wanted to tell him he just felt that way because this was all he knew right now, but I didn’t. Instead, I told him the truth. “Because you’re one of us. You’re part of this place now. Even if most of us have houses we go to to sleep when we clock out, we never really leave here. Not sure if you’ve noticed, but none of us really has much of a life. No close friends outside of work. Not much family, if any. I don’t think ending up here is ever really an accident.”\n\nSam thought on it for a moment, and then the corner of his mouth turned up. “It’s kind of like we’re a special collection. Like the Library curates us.”\n\n“Hah. Yeah,” I agreed fondly. “It kind of is.”\n\nSo, anyway, that’s it. My one experience with Doug. \n\nI thought maybe writing it out would help me get it out of my head, because I haven’t really been able to stop thinking about it, like, at all since Sam and I talked. I try not to let it get to me anymore—and it doesn’t, most of the time—but every once in a while I just find myself wondering if there was anything to it.\n\nI know, rationally, that there wasn’t. That there can’t be. \n\nBut I’ve been doing a lot of running my fingers over my skin lately, just to make sure there’s nothing moving underneath.",

        "text": "\n\n[Part Four](https://redd.it/10s68nk)\n\n**** \n\nWe drove into Braxton from the north on the main highway.  I’d wanted to ask more questions after the things Holliman had said, but I decided to wait and see instead.  Whatever this place was, whatever *all* of this was, I couldn’t just keep blindly following whatever my employers told me.  This was no longer just about my job.  It was about my life. \n\nSo instead of asking questions and swallowing whatever answers I got, I kept quiet and paid attention as we traveled into the city limits of Braxton.  There was a large building coming up on the left, and squinting, I could just make out the sign running along the roofline five stories up.  It was a hospit…\n\n“Oh my God.”\n\nThat was Mrs. Graves, her voice soft and trembling with enough fear that it derailed my train of thought and caused me to follow her gaze to a large, dark mound out on the grounds of the hospital.  Mr. Holliman was slowing down now as he sucked air between his teeth and muttered “Goddamnit” under his breath.  I only noticed his reaction distantly, however, as I squinted out the window and tried to understand what we were all looking at.  When I did, my stomach twisted into a cramp as my gorge began to rise.\n\nIt was bodies.  A large heap of bodies that had obviously been partially burned at one point and then left rotting for weeks or months—there were still patches of clothes and hair and desiccated flesh, but mostly it was a mound of bones melded into a bleak little hill by time and decay.  A few more people were scattered about, some obviously dead, but others almost like…\n\n“A…are some of those people sleeping?  Are there people out there in…in *that* still alive and fucking sleeping?”\n\nMrs. Graves met my eyes before putting her hand on Holliman’s arm.  “We don’t need to stop here.  This isn’t a good place to start.”\n\nHe shot her a dark look, his tone harsh.  “I’m not an idiot.  I know…”  Stopping himself, he let out a long sigh.  “I’m sorry, Gracie.  I’m afraid and that makes me short-tempered, but I shouldn’t take it out on you.”\n\nShe patted his arm.  “I know.  It’s okay.  But let’s go on into town and see what we can see.”  She turned back to look at me.  “You okay with that too?”\n\nHeart pounding, I forced myself to stop glancing out the window and sit back in my seat.  “Yeah.  Yeah, it’s got to be better than here.”\n\n**** \n\nWe drove on toward the town proper, Holliman taking a slow and cautious route that cut up and down the occasional side street before moving back to the main road on a trajectory toward what street signs said was “Downtown Braxton”.  None of us talked as we went, but I could feel our collective fear and anxiety growing every mile we drove deeper into that place.\n\nThere were people laying in cars, sprawled out near or sometimes in the streets, slumped against buildings and curled up in yards as we passed.  I couldn’t say for sure with all of them—only some would occasionally twitch and so were obviously alive—but most of them didn’t really look dead.  Just…asleep.  The surreal strangeness of it all was made a hundred times worse by some of the other things scattered around amid the slumbering citizenry of Braxton.\n\nWrecked cars.  Burned out buildings.  Bodies that definitely *were* dead because they’d been torn apart and were rotting.  Amid all of this were numerous dark splashes and stains that looked like the faded remnants of old horrors—a slaughter that happened here before the survivors decided to curl up and take a long winter’s nap.  It was all terrifying, but even worse, it was impossible.\n\n“How…how could any of this be happening?  Didn’t you say this started months ago?”\n\nGraves nodded as she glanced back to the rear seat.  “Or longer, yes.”\n\nI frowned at her.  “So how does that make sense?  The bodies and stuff?  *Maybe* they’re decaying like they would over that much time in the elements, because how would I know, right?  I’m no expert, though to me even that stuff seems like it’s fresher than it would be after that long outside.  But let’s set that aside.”  I leaned forward and pointed to the closest sidewalk, where a pair of cops were laying against each other outside of a downtown store called “You Sew and Sew”.   “How are these people still alive?  How haven’t they starved to death?  Frozen to death?  Been eaten by bugs or wolves or whatever the fuck?  It makes no sense.”\n\nLetting out a sigh, Holliman pulled into an empty parking space and turned off the car.  “Clint…”\n\n“And…and…why wouldn’t people know about this place?  Why wouldn’t it be in the national news if everyone just started killing each other here and then fell asleep?”\n\nHe turned to face me, his voice hard but not cruel.  “Clint.  Stop.  Listen, please.”\n\nSucking in a breath, I nodded.  “Okay.  Yeah.  I…yeah.  Listening.”\n\nHolliman glanced at Graves and then back to me.  “Good.  First off, we don’t have all the answers.  We know this is where we’re supposed to go and have some idea of what we’d find here and what we need to do.  But we don’t have answers for everything.”  He paused for a moment before going on, his words softer and more measured.  “That being said, this…phenomena is being caused by something in or near this town.  An infection, for lack of a better term.”  Seeing my eyes widen, he raised his hand.  “Not that kind of infection.  I don’t know that it’s contagious anymore, and even if it was…well, the three of us should be inoculated against its effects.”\n\n“Inoculated?  What’re you talking about?  I haven’t had a shot for this shit.”\n\nGraves gave me a small smile.  “Not a shot.  Your service.  Your work with us.  It grants you a measure of protection too.  It keeps you able to do the work that’s needed.”\n\nI had a hundred questions, but I had to be smart and selective if I was going to get anything useful out of them.  “Okay.  So we’ll just let that go for now.  What about the other?  Why don’t people know about this and how are these people all still alive?”\n\nHolliman pursed his lips.  “When this first happened, I think it really was like an infection.  Spreading throughout the town and anyone who it came across.  But once it had enough people, the infection changed.  The people it had driven crazy, they started to sleep.  To sleep and to dream.  And the reality around this place began to thicken and harden like a pearl.  In the world but not of it.  Forgotten except by those that stumbled upon it by accident.”\n\n“Then why wouldn’t one of those people…”  I trailed off as I looked at my phone.  No signal.  I could hear fresh fear in my voice when I spoke again.  “This place is a trap, isn’t it?”\n\nGraves was looking out the window when she spoke.  “It certainly looks that way.  I don’t know that it’s meant to be specifically, but I think it’s removed from normal reality in such a way that the effect is largely the same.”\n\nI felt my tongue growing thick in my mouth.  “So you can get in but not back out? Like a fucking roach motel?”  I asked the next question afraid I already knew the answer.  “Can we leave?”\n\nHolliman gave a slight shake of his head.  “As things stand at the moment?  No.  But there is a way to stop what’s happening here.  To reconcile this place back into our world.  Then we’ll be able to leave again.”\n\nMy jaw was clenching as I stared at him.  “Why didn’t you fucking tell me we couldn’t leave before we wandered in here?”\n\nGraves did turn and look at me then.  “We honestly didn’t know for sure.  And we think we have to have you with us for this.  For this all to work properly.”\n\nI grimaced at her.  “What is ‘this’?  What do we have to do to unfuck this place and get to leave?”\n\n“It’s our understanding that there is a mine underneath this town.”  She pointed her long, thin finger down and bored through the air like a drill headed for the heart of the earth.  “A very old and deep hole that for some reason the people of this town started mining again awhile back.  They dug up, and woke up, something even older than the hole down there.”  Licking her lips, she gave a nervous laugh.  “And now we have to find it.  [And kill it.](https://redd.it/10h9jfw)”",

I live in a very rural area of Massachusetts, and the nearest house is a few miles away. As I drove down a deserted road, my car slowed to a stop.\n\n\n“Shit. Should have gotten gas” I said as I fumbled around searching through my purse for my phone.\nI couldn’t find it anywhere. I looked in the glove compartment and in the backseat with my sweater. It was nowhere. I sighed and looked around for my car keys hoping I could atleast lock the car doors and walk up the road to my friends house to use there phone but I couldn’t find my keys either.. I thought this was strange as I’m the type of person to never forget or lose things.\nI whipped around and tried to open the car door, they were locked.\n“So I’m stuck in here…” I said annoyed.\nI thought I could just wait for a car to drive down the road and flag them down. Thought that would be a bit futile tho.\nMy feet were killing me from these gaudy heels I wore to work today so I took them off a slipped into an extra pair of sneakers.\nI soon realized my keys feel into the crack between the seats of the passenger and driver.\nI groaned and stuck my hand, which is very skinny down the crack and was able to reach them and pull them out. I unlocked the car door and tried making sure the car didn’t just break down, The car quickly turned on, The engine however spluttered. As I opened the window for fresh air I dropped my keys out of the car.\nMy phone started ringing so I was able to find it, strangely it was in a coat pocket that I hadn’t worn today..\nI thought I was going crazy\n\n\nI answered the phone without looking who it was assuming it was my friend asking where I was.\n\n\n“Hello?” I said\n\n\n“You looking for these?” The voice said.\n\n\n“Who is this-?” I asked confused.\n\n\n“Might wanna get your car keys.” The voice replied in a snarly voice.\n\n\nMy face froze and I turned white.\n\n\n“How do you know where I am?” I said shaking.\n\n\n\n“I never said I did” the voice said.\n\nI quickly opened the door to pick the keys up off the ground only for them to be gone. I quickly tried driving off but without the keys the car was going nowhere.\n\n\n“Who are you?” I said as the car finally died.\nI was beyond nervous now.\n\n\n“You might wanna look up.” The voice said.\nI was too afraid to, but when I did all I saw a ghastly figure, contorted fingers, a hunchback, drenched in blood, wielding a knife, It’s eyes bloodshot red, like a demented demon from hell. It’s voice soon changed and it quickly became a growl, like nails scratching on a chalkboard. It dangled my car keys like it was playing a game of house.\n\nThis.. thing.. began to speak.\n“This will only hurt a bit.” It said as it charged at me as I screamed. I woke up the next morning in my car with a note.\nIt read “Next time I’ll take your soul” and I lift up my shirt to find out one of my livers were gone. The note was signed “Your secret admirer” and a bloody heart was drawn on the paper. I will never drive down that road ever again, this was a warning. I told my friend and they experienced the exact same thing aswell and nobody believed her. It took her liver too.

Everything up to this point has a play-by-play of the worst moments of my existence, and I know I’m not ready to recount this part, but what other choice do I have? This needs to end, and it can’t until the entire tale is told.\n\nIn the chaotic darkness, a shotgun racked, and the twelve-gauge sang into the night with defiance.\n\nThe Big One howled, and jerked its arm back through the opening, the sudden movement enough to send the section of stairwell behind us crumbling down. The chasm yawned, more of the steps collapsed, and I heard the collective shriek of the Puppet horde as they were buried under the falling rubble.\n\n“Now’s our chance.” Mark pushed me up the remaining stairs. “Go, get to the—”\n\n*Crash.*\n\nLike a freight train of blind rage, the clenched fist of the Big One exploded through the wall, and Mark flew sideways. Unable to keep my feet, I pulled myself into a recess on the rough, cold cement, in an effort to keep from being crushed. Rain and wind trickled in from the gap in the tower, and against the backdrop of lightning, I realized I sat at shoulder height to the enormous gray visage.\n\nThe red light from my headlamp caught its face, and I recoiled in terror.\n\nCrouched low to peer into the gap, the Big One studied me without eyes, it’s face a mass of tangled, gnarled tree branches all woven together. Something hummed in the back of my brain, a whining that pried into every fold of my thoughts and paralyzed my limbs. Whispers rose in the static, soft voices that urged me to not to fight, to stay still, that it was so much sweeter on the other side. The pain wouldn’t last long. I wouldn’t feel it after a while. So warm and dry, it’d be just like falling asleep.\n\n*Sleep sounds good. I could sleep. Maybe it won’t hurt if I just . . .*\n\nA bright orange glow flared to life, and the static fizzled out.\n\nMy head pounded with a sudden migraine, and a wave of nausea roiled in my guts.\n\nTo my right, Mark slumped against the far wall, holding a green glass bottle with a flaming rag tied to the neck of it. Rivulets of blood poured down from a gash on his scalp, and his right leg lay twisted at a horrible angle, but Mark wound his arm back, and hurled the bottle with all the energy he had left.\n\nYellow flames exploded over the tangled branches of its face, and the Big One reeled with an agonized screech. Awash in fire, the creature stampeded for the nearby tree line, its bellows louder than the storm that raged overhead. All around its feet, those Puppets that hadn’t been buried in the collapsed stairwell scurried away in hasty retreat. Lightning snapped, the thunder boomed, and all at once everything fell silent again, save for the ancient mutterings of the wind and rain.\n\nI fell forward onto my hands and knees and puked over the edge of the ruined stairwell, the dark rubble below swallowing the vomit with cruel indifference. Cold crept through me now, the adrenaline wore off, and I realized how much black gore was smeared over my face, arms, chest, and hands.\n\n*I beat that one girl to death. I crushed her face in with a rock. Dear God, what’s happening to me?*\n\nWith both eyes shut, I pictured my dad at the gun range teaching me how to shoot, and his words about surviving bad situations.\n\n*You’ve got to stay calm, Maddie. No matter what, stay calm, breathe, and act. If you do that, you’ll be okay.*\n\n“Gotta go.” I sucked in a deep breath and forced myself not to gag at the taste of bile in my mouth. “Mark, we . . . we have to go.”\n\nHe didn’t respond.\n\nMy knees almost gave out the first time I stood up, and I had to brace myself against the ruined wall. Exhaustion threatened to bring me down, and my ears throbbed as if someone had shoved needles down inside them. Still, I turned back to my friend, and groped to find the switch on my headlamp.\n\n*Click.*\n\nI slapped one filthy hand over my mouth to stifle another wave of nausea.\n\nIn the scarlet light, Mark’s blood looked black, and pooled on the cement beneath him. Bright white bone stuck out from his snapped leg, the end jagged and slick. Mark’s eyes were shut, one half of his face red with blood, the other pale as new fallen snow.\n\n“Mark?” I squeaked the words out, too afraid to admit what I suspected to be true. “Mark, please say something. *Mark*.”\n\nHis head rolled limply onto one shoulder, and my heart skipped a frantic beat.\n\n*The bags.*\n\nI scrambled for my green satchel, tore it apart in a search for something to help. My hands smeared black goo over everything, but I didn’t care. There had to be something, either in his kit or mine, to fix this.\n\nA small green nylon pouch surfaced, and I saw a little red cross stitched onto the flap.\n\n“*Yes.*” In spite of everything, I shouted with joy, and hugged the little pack to my chest.\n\nMy clumsy cold fingers struggled to unzip it, and I pawed through the contents until I found a black torniquet, like the ones my father stockpiled in our basement for the day the world decided to end. I’d hardly paid attention when he’d showed me how to use them, but the instructions still resonated in my mind, and I decided that if I ever got home, I’d hug Dad so hard his ribs would break.\n\n“High and tight.” I gritted my teeth and laced the strap around Mark’s thigh, well above the shattered femur. Yanking it as hard as I could, I tried not to think about how Mark didn’t even groan in pain as I wound the little metal windlass to staunch the tide of glistening blood.\n\nSomewhere in the distance, another whale-like bellow echoed, and I swallowed a nervous, bile-flavored lump.\n\n“We can make it.” I talked to him, more to keep from crying than anything else, and slid my shoulder under Mark’s armpit. “Come on, get up. Up, up, up, come on.”\n\nBut no matter how much I strained, I couldn’t lift him, my leg muscles shot from the terrified run through the fields, Mark’s 170-pound frame like a fallen log. I clawed the gray rucksack off his back, along with the red duffel bag, and tossed aside the green shoulder bag he’d given me.\n\nI strained, screamed in desperation, but fell to my knees, spent.\n\nA glimpse at his still face sent an icy chill down my spine, and I put two fingers to Mark’s throat.\n\n*Stupid idiot, you should have checked sooner.*\n\nPanicked, I rolled Mark onto his back on the cold concrete, and pressed my hands to his sternum, my brain a fog of fear. “Mark, you have to wake up. Come on, wake up. *Wake up.*”\n\nI pumped at his chest, put my ear to his mouth and listened.\n\nNothing.\n\n“Y-you can’t do that.” I spat, angry and scared, tears brimming in my eyes. “You c-can’t leave me, you can’t.”\n\nAgain and again, I leaned on his diaphragm, and this time, I lifted Mark’s chin to put my mouth to his. Every bit of guilt and shame rushed back to choke me at the sensation of his soft lips on mine, but I had to fight through it to breathe air into his lungs.\n\nMy arms began to cramp, seconds passed, and my despair grew. Mark wasn’t moving, wasn’t breathing, and his pulse . . .\n\n*Please God, don’t do this. I’m so sorry, I’ve been such a fool, please don’t take him, not like this, please.*\n\nMy brain began to accept the inevitable, and tears streamed down my face along with the cold rain, salty and bitter. This was all my fault. If I hadn’t come back this year, hadn’t stayed too long after work, hadn’t stopped to talk to him in the parking lot, Mark wouldn’t be here. He’d saved me, cared for me, forgiven me, and after everything, I’d led him to his death. I didn’t deserve that kind of love. I didn’t deserve Mark Petric.\n\nGiving up, I dropped my head to his chest, my wet hair hanging in curtains around my grimy face.\n\n“Maddie.”\n\nI jerked back with a muffled scream of surprise.\n\nMark blinked up at me, his face almost gray, but his eyes still warm, chocolate brown. “You . . . you okay?”\n\nUnable to speak through my relieved sobs, I threw my arms around his shoulders, and curled up beside him on the cold cement. Mark slid one sluggish arm around me, and I relished what little warmth I could feel coming from his chest beneath the layers of waterlogged clothes.\n\n“Can’t stay here.” He grunted into my ear, and Mark winced as though the pain had at last started to set in. “You can’t stay.”\n\nI pressed my face to his collarbone and shook my head like a stubborn child. “I’m not going without you.”\n\nHis fingers squeezed my arm in earnest, though his strength seemed to wane by the minute. “Yes, you are. If . . . if that thing comes back, it’ll rip this place apart, and you won’t make it to the exit. You have to leave me here.”\n\n“No.” I clung to him even harder, and my voice cracked like a glass dropped from a skyscraper. “I’ll fight it I-I’ll use one of your firebombs—”\n\n“That was the last one.” He sighed, and something about the way he sounded, so tired, so weak, made my chest throb. “And it just made it angry. You have to go, or it’ll kill you.”\n\nHis fingers laced into my hair, the braid long gone, the strands now wild tangles around my neck. Mark pulled, in a gentle but insistent pull, and I brought my head up to meet his gaze.\n\nIn the dark, with the rain and wind whipping outside our hovel, the lightning slithered through the sky, and revealed Mark’s thin smile.\n\n“You can do it, you just have to focus. Still have your gun?”\n\nShame burned across my cheeks. “I . . . I think I lost it. In the field.”\n\n“That’s fine.” He rolled his head to nod at the far wall, which still bore his blood stains. “Take my shotgun. Got more slugs for it in my coat. And my knife, you’ll need it.”\n\nMy eyes stung with fresh waves of remorse, and I went to shake my head, but Mark’s touch on my face stopped me, his calloused fingers wiping away the tears.\n\n“You’ll be alright. Come on, get my ruck. And the red bag too.”\n\nMy arms and legs seemed to move on their own, and I crawled over to lug the bags to Mark. The twelve gauge was covered in concrete dust, with dents and scratches on its wooden stock, but otherwise remained functional, and I slung the heavy weapon over my shoulder like I’d seen him do.\n\n“Put the gun across your chest.” Mark nudged his folded gray jacket my way, along with the silver-colored camping knife from his belt, and grimaced as though the pain intensified with every move he made. “You’ll have to drop from high up and . . . ahh . . . and roll onto your back. Don’t want to break your spine on that thing.”\n\n“Drop?” I choked, fear and pain mingling in my head. “What do you mean?”\n\nMark flicked his eyes up the dark stairs above us. “There’s a room at the top of the tower, with four windows all around it. There should be a stack of harnesses under one of them. Once you put one on, hitch it to a cable outside and ride it like a zipline across the opposite field. At the end, the line stops about ten feet off the ground. You’ll have to cut yourself loose and drop down.”\n\nMy throat turned dry, but I pulled his jacket on over my slender shoulders and tried to focus on his instructions even as apocalyptic footsteps echoed in the tree line not far away. “O-Okay. Then what?”\n\n“If you made the sacrifice right, you should be able to see a light from the base of the cable pole. Head for that. There’s gonna be a lot of freaks hanging around the exit so . . . run like the wind, and don’t look back.”\n\nBoth eyebrows hitched higher on my face, and a word stuck out among all the others. “Sacrifice? Wait, what sacrifice?”\n\nMark made a grim, stoic nod. “Usually, if you want to leave here, you have to give up something really important to you, something you can’t get replace. I had to leave my heirloom pocket watch behind last time Randy came to get me. He had to leave his wedding band.”\n\nMy heart sank. I had left my necklace at home in my room, and with nothing in my pockets but a cheap flashlight and an old candy wrapper, I would be trapped. “But I don’t have anything . . .”\n\nHe met my confusion with an apologetic smile, and I realized what Mark meant.\n\n“No!” It came out as a whimper more than a scream, my soul writhing from the terrible truth.\n\nBut Mark gripped my wrist with a desperate gleam in his eyes. “I can’t make that jump, not with my leg like this. You’ve got nothing to give, and you can’t carry me and make the sprint at the end. But if I stay, I should be enough to get you through.”\n\n“I won’t go without you.” Shaking off his grasp, I tried to be angry, but only felt more miserable by the second. This couldn’t be happening, it just couldn’t.\n\nHe cupped my chin, and despite myself, I leaned into his touch, the palm still warm enough to make my spine tingle in that pleasant way I hadn’t known was possible.\n\n“And I won’t let you die here.” Mark ran his thumb over my cheek in a tenderness that made a guilty fire blaze inside my heart. “Now hurry up, we don’t have much time.”\n\nTrying to hold myself together, I sorted through the dirty, torn bags, all the while fighting the fog of hypothermia that crept into my brain.\n\n*Gotta stay awake. I can’t pass out, not now.*\n\nMark drew a shuddery breath and cringed at his mutilated leg. “In the top flap there’s a road flare. I need it.”\n\nI found it, a brown cardboard wrapped tube with a red cap on one end. Too numb to be confused, I handed him the flare, and heard plastic clatter to the concrete floor.\n\nInstantly, we both knew exactly what it was.\n\nMark nodded at the little plastic hairbrush, his eyes softening. “Would you . . .”\n\n“Sure.” I placed it in Mark’s cold grasp, and my heart ached at how he clutched the brush to his chest with tender affection.\n\n*He’s losing her. No more Claire, no more kids, no farmhouse in the woods. He’s losing everything . . . all because of me.*\n\nMark shut his eyes, sniffled, and held the brush out to me. “Take this when you go.”\n\nAnother wave of nausea slammed into me, and I whipped my head back and forth. “No, I can’t, I—”\n\n“Maddie, *please*.” His voice broke, halfway between begging and groaning in agony from his wounds. “I don’t want it stuck here too. Take it to Claire, and . . . tell her that I . . .”\n\nI held onto Mark like he was an anchor keeping me from going adrift in the storm. “I know. I’ll t-tell her, I promise.”\n\nHe pushed the brush into my left hand, his own still welded to my right, and a volcano rose inside my brain. I wasn’t just looking at Mark Petric, my goofy friend from work who liked my cupcakes and my terrible karaoke. The man lying beside me meant more to me than all of that, and it hit me now just what *I* was losing.\n\n“I’m sorry.”\n\nIt exploded from me at last, a cascade of emotion all tangled into one giant mess, the tears hot on my face, every breath short and excruciating. I didn’t know what else to say, couldn’t put my feelings into words now when it mattered most, but I knew then that I cared for him more than ever before. I was sorry that I’d let this happen, sorry I’d not stayed in my car, sorry I’d brushed him off in the parking lot, and I was so very sorry that all those months ago, I’d turned away my one chance to be more than Mark Petric’s friend from Carnivore Cove.\n\n“Don’t.” His fingers tightened on mine, and Mark let slide a sympathetic grin that held flickers of something deeper, remnants of feelings that drove nails into my heart. “You have nothing to be sorry for. You’re here, and that’s all that matters. Now, help me up.”\n\nWatching my arms move almost independent of myself, I propped him against the wall, hating every second of it.\n\nMark pulled the red duffel bag close and unzipped it to reveal a metal pressure cooker coated with nails and tape, a bundle of wires that led to some big square batteries, and a repurposed digital stopwatch. Outside, the footsteps thundered closer, and the screeches returned, the horde of Puppets ready to finish the job.\n\n*I wish I had more time. One more minute, one more day, just one. Even if it meant watching him with Claire, I’d be okay with that.*\n\nI shouldered the green bag and turned from the steps to look back at Mark.\n\nHe struck the end of the flare to ignite it, the stairwell bathed in its blood-red light, and threw me a warm, handsome smile for the last time. “You’re still one in a million, Maddie.”\n\nDoing my best to grin through my waterfall of tears, I felt my heart tear in half inside of me. “Goodbye Mark.”\n\nWith that, I smothered a mournful sob, and sped up the stairs.\n\nShadows closed in around me in accusatory sheets, and the tears smeared with Mark’s red blood on my cheek to form a bitter avalanche of regret. Everything seemed to move in slow motion now that seconds counted, and I wanted nothing more than to wake up in my own bed and discover that this entire nightmare was over.\n\nA colossal baleen roar rumbled through the earth, even as I charged through a small metal door at the top of the stairs and skidded to a halt in surprise.\n\nUnlike everywhere else in this hellscape road, the small square room was dry, it’s windows mysteriously intact, and all around the mundane cement walls lay heaps of random items. Pictures, rings, a golden pocket watch that I suspected was Mark’s, and various other trinkets sat in reverent heaps like treasures in the tomb of some ancient civilization. A hollow sensation tore through me at the thought that my sacrifice lay only seventeen steps down from here, with gentle hands, a kind smile, and chocolate brown eyes that melted me every time.\n\n*Focus. The cable. Find the cable.*\n\nTo one side, a pile of dusty multicolored harnesses caught my eye, like the kind we had for the zipline attractions at New Wilderness. It had been a while since I’d been on a zipline, but I didn’t have much of a choice. I picked one, yellow, Mark’s favorite color, and stepped into it.\n\nRabid cries floated up from the ground outside, and a shadowy figure strode into view, fixated on the red glow of Mark’s flare.\n\nShoving open the window above the stack of harnesses, I braced my hands against the dry-rotted frame and leaned out into the icy wind.\n\n*There.*\n\nAbove me, a braided steel cable ran from a heavy mounting, and stretched out into the gloom, far across the soggy grass fields that surrounded the old coal building. A small flicker of hope kindled inside me, the prospect of this ordeal ending like sweet intoxication to my mind.\n\n“Maddie, go!”\n\nMark’s cry split the night, and I glanced down to find the Big One right underneath me, peering into the gap it had made in the stairwell during the previous attack. It slid one massive hand into the breach, and I fumbled to clip the rusted carabiner onto the cable.\n\n*Click.*\n\nThe second it latched on, I threw myself out the window, and the metal cable whined at my rapid descent. I spun on the end of the nylon strap and twisted my neck to look back toward the tower.\n\n*Boom.*\n\nAn explosion ripped through the night, pillars of flame gushed from the hole in the tower, and the Big One let out a long, loud roar of agony. For one slit second, I could see everything silhouetted in the darkness, the Puppets piling on top of each other in an attempt to climb the outer walls, the Big One stumbling backward with its head and arms wreathed in orange flame, and the lonely tower where my best friend had been, coated in thick black smoke.\n\nIt shrank into the distance until darkness swallowed the terrible scene, and I shut my eyes to let loose a wail of unbearable grief. Deep, rending pain brought scream after scream from me, loud sobs and cries I never would have emitted around anyone, wordless sorrow that made me want to die for the emptiness it left in my center.\n\nGone. Mark was gone.\n\nA sudden lurch broke me from my weeping, and I looked up to find myself suspended in space, a large, frayed knot in the cable having stopped me right before a tall, rusty steel pole. The ground lay not far under me, coated in rain-soaked brush and chest-high grass. Was this the exit Mark had spoken of, or once again had I been foiled, tricked by this awful place into yet another hellish maze?\n\nSniffling, I spun on the end of my harness like a spider on its web and peered into the rainy abyss.\n\n*Is that . . . a light?*\n\nMy heart jerked, and I gasped between renewed sobs at a dim, yet discernable white glow not two hundred yards away, across a low-lying section of grassland. It was so close, all I had to do was run to the light, and I’d be free. I could go home.\n\nPulling Mark’s camping knife from my belt, I sawed at the nylon harness, my nerves grating with each snap of the tiny fibers that brought me closer to the inevitable drop.\n\n*Almost there, almost . . .*\n\nLike an invisible hand had released me, I plummeted downward, my heels slamming into the spongy muck of the wet earth. My butt hit the ground next and I almost rolled over in a complete somersault, both legs flying up into the air. The arches of both feet stung, and the wind had been knocked out of me, but I was alive.\n\nSomewhere off to my right, an eerie shriek crackled into the night air, and my blood ran cold.\n\n“Oh, come *on*.” I muttered under my breath, exasperated and desperate. I’d come so far, lost so much, and now my way out was *right there*, yet still I would be hunted like a rabbit to the very end.\n\n*No. Not like a rabbit. I’m not dying like that.*\n\nMy hands found Mark’s shotgun, and I thumbed the safety off.\n\nThrough the clearing, the rain fell, the wind hissed, and everything waited for me to make my move.\n\n*This is for you, Mark.*\n\nI darted through the grass, my sore legs moved underneath me with renewed energy, and the field erupted into chaos.\n\nFrom the mud, twisted and distended limbs dragged macabre figures into the light of my headlamp. Not quite Puppets, but certainly not human, they were broken and torn, rotten and decayed, but worst of all, they were all the same.\n\n“*Maddie.*” They called in sing-song mockery of his soft voice, the dozens of half-rotted Marks staggering after me, their arms outstretched. Each one bore his face, his mousy hair, his strong arms, even his brown eyes, but without the warmth, the life, the love. They materialized in waves from the grass, the trees, and the muck in various stages of decay, repeating any words the darkness had overhead him saying in a cruel mantra.\n\n“*Maddie, run.*”\n\n“*Maddie, please.*”\n\n“*Maddie, stop*.”\n\nFear sliced through me, but it paled in comparison to the grief that came with Mark’s words being replayed from their vile throats. My eyes blurred with tears at how real they looked. The clotted blood made my heart ache, the horrid wounds like razor blades to my soul, and step-by-step, sadness overwhelmed my terror. Mark was dead, yet his death now chased me through the tall grass with Cheshire grins and haunting calls, tormenting me for my mistake.\n\nA figure popped up right in my path, his back to me, and the Mark apparition snapped his head over backwards so that his chin faced the sky.\n\nWith the awful crunching of shattered neck bones, he gave me a wide, inverted smile. “*Strawberry upside down.*” \n\nHe lunged at me with his decayed arms bent at unnatural angles, and a throaty laugh frothed out of his fluid-filled lungs.\n\n“Stop it!” The shotgun bucked against my shoulder, and the apparition’s head disappeared, black goo misting into the air where it had been.\n\nStifling my own tortured sob, I sidestepped the corpse and ran on, the white light just ahead, as more enemies shambled through the grass.\n\nThey closed in from all sides, so much that I stopped trying to aim the shotgun, and simply pumped round after round into every counterfeit Mark that came within range. Pulling the trigger sent a fresh stab into my already destroyed heart, and when they didn’t die right away, they screamed with a surprisingly convincing imitation of Mark’s pained cries. I had to force myself to shoot, to murder him over and over again, and my raw emotions continued to bleed rivers the entire way.\n\nMottled dead hands snagged at my green shoulder bag, and I slipped it off without a glance backward. My scrabbling fingers couldn’t find any more shells in the pockets of Mark’s jacket, so I wielded the twelve gauge like a club, until another apparition caught it by the sling, and yanked it away. There were so many of them, the grass so tall, the hands reaching from everywhere, and the light seemed so far away.\n\nClammy fingers grabbed a fistful of my loose hair, and I drew the last weapon I had.\n\nWith a desperate yell, I spun around and plunged Mark’s knife into the imitation’s face. As soon as it let go, I pushed through a wall of hands, finally able to feel the white light’s rays on my face and threw myself into the grass beyond.\n\nMy foot plummeted over an unseen bank, and I went down.\n\nI rolled, through grass and mud, across a small briar bush, and into a shallow water-filled ditch. Rain clamored down around me, my body ached with fatigue, and overhead, the dark storm clouds rumbled with hidden tongues of lightning. Too exhausted to stand, I lay there in a crumpled heap and shut my eyes, ready for the fiends to rip into me.\n\nI waited.\n\nNothing.\n\nDaring to open my eyes, I sat up. Aside from the whistle of the wind, the curtains of rain and droning thunder, the shrieks had ceased, the apparitions gone. No one called my name, and I could hear no crashing in the underbrush. Somehow, I was alone once more.\n\nConfused, I crawled out of the ditch, and felt something smooth and hard under my palms. What was that? It felt so familiar, yet my tired, frazzled mind couldn’t place it.\n\n*So cold. Got to get warm. Have to get warm and dry.*\n\nI struggled to stand, but fell, my ankles and knees so worn from my ordeal that I could barely move. My skin felt like old rubber, my fingers wouldn’t bend, and I shivered uncontrollably.\n\nThe air began to glow, a loud metallic screeching split the air, and two bright blue orbs stopped not five yards away. Whatever new thing was coming for me would have an easy meal, and I struggled back toward the ditch as the lights flooded over me.\n\nFootsteps thudded nearer, and I raised my hands to shield myself in the blinding aura of the light.\n\n“Maddie?”\n\nI flinched. Perhaps the apparitions had followed me after all?\n\nA man stepped into view, with brown work boots, dark blue jeans and a tan Carhart coat. He had auburn hair like me, and wide worried eyes that took in my bedraggled appearance with horror and disbelief. No doubt I looked like someone from a disaster movie, covered in cuts and bruises, my hair in a tangle, wearing mud-and-blood-smeared clothes that weren’t my own, with a vacant stare in my eyes that had seen things too scarring to forget.\n\n“No.” I shook my head and scuttled away as best I could. I wasn’t going to fall for this, not now.\n\n“Maddie, it’s me.” The man edged closer, his hands held out in a show of peace. “For God’s sake, what happened?”\n\n*It’s not him, it can’t be.*\n\n“You’re not real.” I dragged myself backwards on numb elbows, too weak to fight, but too hateful to die. “You’re not. I know what you are.”\n\n“Madison, listen to me. I’ve been looking for you everywhere. Sweetheart, please.” He stepped closer, and I palmed around for a rock, a stick, anything to use as a weapon.\n\n*I just need to get one good swing at his head.*\n\nBut there was nothing except that strange, hard surface that hung on the edge of my mind as if behind a bank of fog. I had run out of time, and if he was in fact a fake, I might as well find out on my own terms.\n\n“If you’re real.” I met his eyes, sky blue like mine, and fought the instinctive urge to cry. “Then where did we go for my twelfth birthday?”\n\nThe man crouched down onto his heels, and a small, fond smile crossed his face. “Cedar Point.”\n\n*Cedar Point.*\n\nA dam broke inside me, and my eyes pooled with tears I didn’t think I could make. I realized in that moment how the sky already seemed clearer, the rain thinner, the thunder more distant. White painted lines on the hard black asphalt of route 142 stretched away into the night, cool and firm beneath my ragged palms. The lights were headlights, and the man crouched in front of me with two well-worn hands held out . . .\n\n“*Dad*.” \n\nI tried to crawl to him, and my father scooped me off the asphalt without pause. Crying uncontrollably, I let myself fall apart while he carried me to his truck, feeling like I’d just woken up from the worst nightmare of my life. The storm faded, the starry night sky slowly reappeared overhead, and at long last, my fear melted away.\n\nOver. It was over.\n\nAt least, the easy part was.\n\nEvery day afterward became a blur of one horrible situation after another. I was shuffled from the police station, to the hospital, to a therapist in a loop, forced to retell the same story to the point that I gave up trusting anyone. No one believed me, not even my parents, and I had three separate mental breakdowns in the course of a week.\n\nAt first, the police assumed that I’d been brutally assaulted, and suspected Mark. When I vehemently disagreed with that, they decided that someone else had attacked me, and convinced my parents to have me undergo an invasive, uncomfortable examination in the local emergency clinic to prove them wrong. Sitting in that tiny cold room after the exam was over, I bawled my eyes out, feeling more alone than I ever had in my entire life.\n\nNext, the detectives involved with the investigation recruited a therapist who had one too many colors in her attention-desperate butch haircut to put me on a slew of anti-psychotics, which I promptly flushed down the toilet. But the real blow came when they confiscated the clothes Mark had given me, and said they suspected me of killing him, which almost made me vomit the first time one of them suggested it. Without the old T-shirt, flannel jacket, and wrinkled camouflage pants, all I had left to remember Mark by was the pink plastic hairbrush, which I’d hidden in my room the night Dad brought me home.\n\nI would have strangled the person who tried to take it from me.\n\nThis whirlwind of speculation fed the rumor mill at New Wilderness, and soon half of my former friends wanted nothing to do with me, assuming I was in fact responsible for Mark’s death. The other half treated me like some kind of broken china figurine, convinced that Mark had in fact hurt me, and I was just too traumatized to admit it to myself. Even Kendra made snide comments about Mark when she thought I wasn’t paying attention, saying she ‘hoped it was hot’ where he was.\n\nI spent the whole day crying in the bathroom after she said that.\n\nSoon, the story went viral, and people who didn’t even know Mark began trashing him online, saying he deserved what he got, that men like him were scum, and I was a classic example of Stockholm syndrome. More than once I got into comment fights with such keyboard ghouls, and my outbursts got me banned from several platforms. How anyone could believe he’d done something like that, when I was the primary witness who insisted he’d done nothing wrong, made my blood boil.\n\nThen came the funeral.\n\nI found myself walking up to the tiny gray brick funeral home alone, having begged my dad to stay in the car. He’d wanted to come with me, now officially vindicated beyond belief that the world was out to hurt his precious baby girl, and he never went anywhere without his gun tucked into his belt. Still, I made him stay, mainly because I didn’t want him to see all the hateful looks I was sure to get from the people who loved Mark, and thought of me as nothing more than either the source of his reputational slander, or his murderess. It was bad enough that I had to endure their scorn. I didn’t want Dad to see it too.\n\nMy black sweater itched, but it covered me from wrist to neck, made me feel a little more invisible, and didn’t stand out in the crowd. I couldn’t bring myself to sign the visitor roster, my stomach turning sour just looking at the table with Mark’s photograph nestled amongst all the white plastic candles. He would have hated the whole thing, the overwhelming aroma of old-lady perfume, the soft organ music in the background, and the dollar store quilts with pictures of doves on them. Of course, there was no casket, no body; no one here even knew where Mark Petric had died.\n\nNo one but me.\n\nThe line to the little shrine of pictures that stood in for a coffin was long, and I spent most of the time staring at my scuffed black dress boots, the resentful eyes from around the room enough to burn a hole in my heart. It hurt enough to know that Mark was gone, but to be detested by those who loved him, and had been loved by him, that was a new level of torture I’d dreaded for days.\n\nAt last, I reached the front, and stepped underneath the little wicker archway.\n\n*Hey stranger. Long time no see.*\n\nMy heart twitched, and I choked back tears. \n\nDozens of pictures of him decorated the wicker siding and stood in frames on various stands beneath the arch. Mark smiling at high school graduation. Mark in his green army fatigues, fresh out of basic training. Mark at a table in college, sleeping when he should have been studying. Mark embracing a pretty blonde girl, who wore a shiny diamond ring on one finger.\n\nAt last, my eyes settled on Mark in his black New Wilderness uniform shirt, standing with the other veterans during the Veterans Appreciation Day photoshoot. He beamed back at me from the glass frame, proud and gentle, sweet and kind, my best friend, and a good man.\n\n*One I didn’t deserve.*\n\nReaching into my pocket, I pulled out the pink plastic hairbrush, it’s handle still peppered with a few flecks of his dried blood and set it beside the picture. It looked odd amongst all the prim and proper gifts, but I knew it would find its way into the right hands. Besides, I felt better seeing it alongside Mark’s amazing smile.\n\nI turned and found myself at the head of the procession that passed by Mark’s waiting family members, his red-eyed father, weeping mother, stoic sisters, and morose brother. At the end of the line stood a pretty blonde girl, that same diamond ring on her finger, her head hung low with sad, empty eyes glued to the floor.\n\nA few older women pushed past me to throw themselves into the arms of Mark’s mother, and I used them as a smoke screen to slip away from the rest of the crowd.\n\nComing to a stop in front of the blonde girl, I waited till she raised her head, my heart pounding like a trip-hammer. “Claire?”\n\nShe blinked at me, forlorn but calm, as though the girl had already grieved too much to break down on a day like today. Still, in the blue irises that stared back at me, I could see the pain there, the shattered heart of someone who had loved Mark with all her soul, only to have him stolen away without even saying goodbye.\n\n“I’m . . .” I coughed, unsure of how to proceed. “I’m Madison.”\n\n“Oh.” Claire looked back down at her hands and picked nervously at her thumbnail.\n\n*Get it over with, so she can have some comfort in hating you.*\n\nI shut my eyes, pictured Mark’s warm grin, and drew a deep breath. “I was the girl who—”\n\n“I know who you are.”\n\nA stiff cringe almost snapped my spine, but I opened my eyes to find Claire watching me, not with anger or hatred, but with a small, sympathetic smile.\n\n“Mark and I didn’t keep secrets from each other. Before we got engaged, he told me about you. He . . . he said you made really good cupcakes.”\n\n*Of course he did.*\n\nI laughed, though it came out as a choked sob. “Strawberry upside-down.”\n\nClaire fought hard against her own tears, though she sighed fondly in a way that made me feel a million times worse. “Strawberry upside-down.”\n\nSilence reigned between us, and I didn’t know what to say.\n\nHer touch on my arm startled me from my stupor. “You were with him? When it happened?”\n\nMy soul writhed, and tears started to roll down my face, hot and salty. How could I tell her the truth? If anyone deserved to know, it was Claire, but how could I even begin to explain what Mark had died for? He’d braved a terrible unknown, sacrificed everything, his life, his love, his dreams, all for me, and I didn’t even know how to put that into words for his grieving fiancée.\n\nHer eyes locked onto mine, and I saw a desperation there, an excruciating need to know the truth.\n\nI nodded.\n\nClaire shut her eyes, and grimaced against the agony that must have been welling up inside her chest. “H-How did he die?”\n\n*You’re one in a million, Maddie.*\n\nMark’s voice echoed in my head with a thunderclap of clarity, and I forced myself to return Claire’s sad gaze. “Protecting me.”\n\nA flash of pride crossed the pretty features of Claire’s face, and she made a valiant attempt to grin once more. “That sounds like him.”\n\nWe both chuckled through our torment, but I knew I had one last thing to do.\n\n“It’s my fault.” The truth ripped from me like a knife, and I couldn’t stop myself from sobbing, the pain in my chest too much to bear. “I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean for this to happen, I didn’t know . . .”\n\nShe wrapped me in a tight hug before I could say anything more, and I felt moist tears on my shoulder as we mourned together. There was no insincerity in her embrace, no reservation or faux kindness, just the empathy of someone who hurt for the same reason as I did. With the whole world watching, my internal protective walls crumbled, and I wept with Claire over the man who had changed our lives forever.\n\nWe talked and shared stories about Mark for the rest of the night, until Dad wandered in to make sure I was okay. Claire turned out to be really nice, and we decided to stay in touch, the first real friendship I’d had since that awful night. I figured Mark would have wanted that, for both of us.\n\nAll that was four months ago. *Four months.* It feels like a horrible lifetime, someone else’s life, a foreign dream where I don’t belong, but am trapped in all the same.\n\nThat’s why I volunteered to take Mark’s place in the Night Rangers.\n\nAt first, everyone in the entire park was against it, but I begged Randy, the head of security, until he finally agreed out of sheer pity. Of course, my parents were furious, but they knew they couldn’t stop me, not after I told them that I’d go even if I had to walk. I know no one else will understand, but the instant I saw the position come up for new applicants, I knew it had to be me. Even now, sitting here in the company truck next to the visitor center, I can hear thunder booming in the distance as the sky grows darker, the lighting rippling in the clouds, calling to me with cruel anticipation.\n\nMy father’s Armalite rifle is propped up on the passenger seat, along with a canvas bandoleer full of loaded magazines. The necklace that my grandma got for me is around my neck, so I have something to sacrifice if I make it that far. In the event that I don’t, my grandpa’s old bowling bag holds a steel pressure cooker filled with jellied gasoline, the outside covered with taped-on framing nails and several batteries wired to a digital baking timer. I suppose the FBI will freak if they ever find this post, but they don’t have to worry. I’m not after them.\n\nIf you’re reading this, Dad, Mom, I love you. I hope I can tell you in the morning, but if not, then understand that this isn’t suicide, not technically. I’m doing my job as a ranger. That *thing* killed my best friend, and if someone doesn’t stop it, it’s only a matter of time before the Big One takes more innocent people. Mark knew that, and it cost him everything. I can’t let his death be in vain.\n\nTo anyone else who just so happens to stumble upon this final excerpt of my sad little tale, I hope you live your life well. Soak up the sun, find a job you love, and most importantly, hold on to the people who care about you. You never know when you’re going to lose them.\n\nAnd if you are ever around the New Wilderness Wildlife Reserve on a stormy, rainy night, please . . . stay *away* from Tauerpin Road.",

        "text": "I'm a writer by profession, and I often find myself lost in the pages of my own imagination. But what i'm about to share is no work of fiction. This is an account of what happened to me, and it's something that still is haunting me to this day.\n\nIt was a dark and gloomy night. I had just finished my latest novel and was looking forward to a good night's sleep. I live alone in a remote cabin in the woods, and the isolation can be both a blessing and a curse. As the rain lashed against the windowpanes, I settled into bed and closed my eyes.\n\nBut I couldn't shake the feeling that I wasn't alone. I heard footsteps outside my door and froze. I tried to convince myself that it was just the wind, but the footsteps grew louder and more insistent. And then, without warning, the door burst open.\n\nI jumped out of bed, ready to defend myself, but what I saw made my blood run cold. A figure stood in the doorway, dressed in a long black cloak with a hood pulled over their face. They held a long, sharp knife in one hand and a burlap sack in the other.\n\nBefore I could even scream, they lunged at me with the knife. I dodged out of the way and ran for the door, but they caught up to me in no time. They grabbed me by the hair and pulled me back, slicing the knife across my arm.\n\nI fell to the ground, clutching my bleeding arm, and watched as they threw the burlap sack over my head. I struggled and fought, but it was no use. They were too strong for me. They picked me up and threw me over their shoulder, carrying me out into the rain.\n\nI could hear the sound of running water, and then we were at the edge of a cliff. I tried to scream, but the burlap sack muffled my cries. The figure pushed me off the edge, and I plummeted into the raging river below.\n\nI thought it was the end for me. I couldn't swim, and the water was pulling me under. But then, something strange happened. My body started to glow with a soft, white light. The water around me began to swirl and churn, and then a massive wave lifted me up and carried me downstream.\n\nWhen I finally washed up on the riverbank, I was battered and bruised but alive. I stumbled back to my cabin, but it wasn't the same. The whole place felt haunted, as if the figure who had attacked me was still lurking in the shadows.\n\nI tried to forget about it, but I couldn't. I started seeing strange things, like the knife I had fought so hard to get away from suddenly appearing on my kitchen counter, or the burlap sack reappearing in my bedroom.\n\nAnd then, one night, I saw the figure again. It was standing at the end of my bed, its hood still obscuring its face. It held out its hand, and in it was a piece of paper with a single message scrawled on it: \"I'm not done with you yet.\"\n\nI don't know what it wants from me, but I'm terrified.

Everything up to this point has a play-by-play of the worst moments of my existence, and I know I’m not ready to recount this part, but what other choice do I have? This needs to end, and it can’t until the entire tale is told.\n\nIn the chaotic darkness, a shotgun racked, and the twelve-gauge sang into the night with defiance.\n\nThe Big One howled, and jerked its arm back through the opening, the sudden movement enough to send the section of stairwell behind us crumbling down. The chasm yawned, more of the steps collapsed, and I heard the collective shriek of the Puppet horde as they were buried under the falling rubble.\n\n“Now’s our chance.” Mark pushed me up the remaining stairs. “Go, get to the—”\n\n*Crash.*\n\nLike a freight train of rage, the clenched fist of the Big One exploded through the wall, and Mark flew sideways. Unable to keep my feet, I pulled myself into a recess on the rough, cold cement, in an effort to keep from being crushed. Rain and wind trickled in from the gap in the tower, and against the backdrop of lightning, I realized I sat at shoulder height to the enormous gray visage.\n\nThe red light from my headlamp caught its face, and I recoiled in terror.\n\nCrouched low to peer into the gap, the Big One studied me without eyes, it’s face a mass of tangled, gnarled tree branches all woven together. Something hummed in the back of my brain, a whining that pried into every fold of my thoughts and paralyzed my limbs. Whispers rose in the static, soft voices that urged me to not to fight, to stay still, that it was so much sweeter on the other side. The pain wouldn’t last long. I wouldn’t feel it after a while. So warm and dry, it’d be just like falling asleep.\n\n*Sleep sounds good. I could sleep. Maybe it won’t hurt if I just . . .*\n\nA bright orange glow flared to life, and the static fizzled out.\n\nMy head pounded with a sudden migraine, and a wave of nausea roiled in my guts.\n\nTo my right, Mark slumped against the far wall, holding a green glass bottle with a flaming rag tied to the neck of it. Rivulets of blood poured down from a gash on his scalp, and his right leg lay twisted at a horrible angle, but Mark wound his arm back, and hurled the bottle with all the energy he had left.\n\nYellow flames exploded over the tangled branches of its face, and the Big One reeled with an agonized screech. Awash in fire, the creature stampeded for the nearby tree line, its bellows louder than the storm that raged overhead. All around its feet, those Puppets that hadn’t been buried in the collapsed stairwell scurried away in hasty retreat. Lightning snapped, the thunder boomed, and all at once everything fell silent again, save for the ancient mutterings of the wind and rain.\n\nI fell forward onto my hands and knees and puked over the edge of the ruined stairwell, the dark rubble below swallowing the vomit with cruel indifference. Cold crept through me now, the adrenaline wore off, and I realized how much black gore was smeared over my face, arms, chest, and hands.\n\n*I beat that one girl to death. I crushed her face in with a rock. Dear God, what’s happening to me?*\n\nWith both eyes shut, I pictured my dad at the gun range teaching me how to shoot, and his words about surviving bad situations.\n\n*You’ve got to stay calm, Maddie. No matter what, stay calm, breathe, and act. If you do that, you’ll be okay.*\n\n“Gotta go.” I sucked in a deep breath and forced myself not to gag at the taste of bile in my mouth. “Mark, we . . . we have to go.”\n\nHe didn’t respond.\n\nMy knees almost gave out the first time I stood up, and I had to brace myself against the ruined wall. Exhaustion threatened to bring me down, and my ears throbbed as if someone had shoved needles down inside them. Still, I turned back to my friend, and groped to find the switch on my headlamp.\n\n*Click.*\n\nI slapped one filthy hand over my mouth to stifle another wave of nausea.\n\nIn the scarlet light, Mark’s blood looked black, and pooled on the cement beneath him. Bright white bone stuck out from his snapped leg, the end jagged and slick. Mark’s eyes were shut, one half of his face red with blood, the other pale as new fallen snow.\n\n“Mark?” I squeaked the words out, too afraid to admit what I suspected to be true. “Mark, please say something. *Mark*.”\n\nHis head rolled limply onto one shoulder, and my heart skipped a frantic beat.\n\n*The bags.*\n\nI scrambled for my green satchel, tore it apart in a search for something to help. My hands smeared black goo over everything, but I didn’t care. There had to be something, either in his kit or mine, to fix this.\n\nA small green nylon pouch surfaced, and I saw a little red cross stitched onto the flap.\n\n“*Yes.*” In spite of everything, I shouted with joy, and hugged the little pack to my chest.\n\nMy clumsy cold fingers struggled to unzip it, and I pawed through the contents until I found a black torniquet, like the ones my father stockpiled in our basement for the day the world decided to end. I’d hardly paid attention when he’d showed me how to use them, but the instructions still resonated in my mind, and I decided that if I ever got home, I’d hug Dad so hard his ribs would break.\n\n“High and tight.” I gritted my teeth and laced the strap around Mark’s thigh, well above the shattered femur. Yanking it as hard as I could, I tried not to think about how Mark didn’t even groan in pain as I wound the little metal windlass to staunch the tide of glistening blood.\n\nSomewhere in the distance, another whale-like bellow echoed, and I swallowed a nervous, bile-flavored lump.\n\n“We can make it.” I talked to him, more to keep from crying than anything else, and slid my shoulder under Mark’s armpit. “Come on, get up. Up, up, up, come on.”\n\nBut no matter how much I strained, I couldn’t lift him, my leg muscles shot from the terrified run through the fields, Mark’s 170-pound frame like a fallen log. I clawed the gray rucksack off his back, along with the red duffel bag, and tossed aside the green shoulder bag he’d given me.\n\nI strained, screamed in desperation, but fell to my knees, spent.\n\nA glimpse at his still face sent an icy chill down my spine, and I put two fingers to Mark’s throat.\n\n*Stupid idiot, you should have checked sooner.*\n\nPanicked, I rolled Mark onto his back on the cold concrete, and pressed my hands to his sternum, my brain a fog of fear. “Mark, you have to wake up. Come on, wake up. *Wake up.*”\n\nI pumped at his chest, put my ear to his mouth and listened.\n\nNothing.\n\n“Y-you can’t do that.” I spat, angry and scared, tears brimming in my eyes. “You c-can’t leave me, you can’t.”\n\nAgain and again, I leaned on his diaphragm, and this time, I lifted Mark’s chin to put my mouth to his. Every bit of guilt and shame rushed back to choke me at the sensation of his soft lips on mine, but I had to fight through it to breathe air into his lungs.\n\nMy arms began to cramp, seconds passed, and my despair grew. Mark wasn’t moving, wasn’t breathing, and his pulse . . .\n\n*Please God, don’t do this. I’m so sorry, I’ve been such a fool, please don’t take him, not like this, please.*\n\nMy brain began to accept the inevitable, and tears streamed down my face along with the cold rain, salty and bitter. This was all my fault. If I hadn’t come back this year, hadn’t stayed too long after work, hadn’t stopped to talk to him in the parking lot, Mark wouldn’t be here. He’d saved me, cared for me, forgiven me, and after everything, I’d led him to his death. I didn’t deserve that kind of love. I didn’t deserve Mark Petric.\n\nGiving up, I dropped my head to his chest, my wet hair hanging in curtains around my grimy face.\n\n“Maddie.”\n\nI jerked back with a muffled scream of surprise.\n\nMark blinked up at me, his face almost gray, but his eyes still warm, chocolate brown. “You . . . you okay?”\n\nUnable to speak through my relieved sobs, I threw my arms around his shoulders, and curled up beside him on the cold cement. Mark slid one sluggish arm around me, and I relished what little warmth I could feel coming from his chest beneath the layers of waterlogged clothes.\n\n“Can’t stay here.” He grunted into my ear, and Mark winced as though the pain had at last started to set in. “You can’t stay.”\n\nI pressed my face to his collarbone and shook my head like a stubborn child. “I’m not going without you.”\n\nHis fingers squeezed my arm in earnest, though his strength seemed to wane by the minute. “Yes, you are. If . . . if that thing comes back, it’ll rip this place apart, and you won’t make it to the exit. You have to leave me here.”\n\n“No.” I clung to him even harder, and my voice cracked like a glass dropped from a skyscraper. “I’ll fight it I-I’ll use one of your firebombs—”\n\n“That was the last one.” He sighed, and something about the way he sounded, so tired, so weak, made my chest throb. “And it just made it angry. You have to go, or it’ll kill you.”\n\nHis fingers laced into my hair, the braid long gone, the strands now wild tangles around my neck. Mark pulled, in a gentle but insistent pull, and I brought my head up to meet his gaze.\n\nIn the dark, with the rain and wind whipping outside our hovel, the lightning slithered through the sky, and revealed Mark’s thin smile.\n\n“You can do it, you just have to focus. Still have your gun?”\n\nShame burned across my cheeks. “I . . . I think I lost it. In the field.”\n\n“That’s fine.” He rolled his head to nod at the far wall, which still bore his blood stains. “Take my shotgun. Got more slugs for it in my coat. And my knife, you’ll need it.”\n\nMy eyes stung with fresh waves of remorse, and I went to shake my head, but Mark’s touch on my face stopped me, his calloused fingers wiping away the tears.\n\n“You’ll be alright. Come on, get my ruck. And the red bag too.”\n\nMy arms and legs seemed to move on their own, and I crawled over to lug the bags to Mark. The twelve gauge was covered in concrete dust, with dents and scratches on its wooden stock, but otherwise remained functional, and I slung the heavy weapon over my shoulder like I’d seen him do.\n\n“Put the gun across your chest.” Mark nudged his folded gray jacket my way, along with the silver-colored camping knife from his belt, and grimaced as though the pain intensified with every move he made. “You’ll have to drop from high up and . . . ahh . . . and roll onto your back. Don’t want to break your spine on that thing.”\n\n“Drop?” I choked, fear and pain mingling in my head. “What do you mean?”\n\nMark flicked his eyes up the dark stairs above us. “There’s a room at the top of the tower, with four windows all around it. There should be a stack of harnesses under one of them. Once you put one on, hitch it to a cable outside and ride it like a zipline across the opposite field. At the end, the line stops about ten feet off the ground. You’ll have to cut yourself loose and drop down.”\n\nMy throat turned dry, but I pulled his jacket on over my slender shoulders and tried to focus on his instructions even as apocalyptic footsteps echoed in the tree line not far away. “O-Okay. Then what?”\n\n“If you made the sacrifice right, you should be able to see a light from the base of the cable pole. Head for that. There’s gonna be a lot of freaks hanging around the exit so . . . run like the wind, and don’t look back.”\n\nBoth eyebrows hitched higher on my face, and a word stuck out among all the others. “Sacrifice? Wait, what sacrifice?”\n\nMark made a grim, stoic nod. “Usually, if you want to leave here, you have to give up something really important to you, something you can’t get replace. I had to leave my heirloom pocket watch behind last time Randy came to get me. He had to leave his wedding band.”\n\nMy heart sank. I had left my necklace at home in my room, and with nothing in my pockets but a cheap flashlight and an old candy wrapper, I would be trapped. “But I don’t have anything . . .”\n\nHe met my confusion with an apologetic smile, and I realized what Mark meant.\n\n“No!” It came out as a whimper more than a scream, my soul writhing from the terrible truth.\n\nBut Mark gripped my wrist with a desperate gleam in his eyes. “I can’t make that jump, not with my leg like this. You’ve got nothing to give, and you can’t carry me and make the sprint at the end. But if I stay, I should be enough to get you through.”\n\n“I won’t go without you.” Shaking off his grasp, I tried to be angry, but only felt more miserable by the second. This couldn’t be happening, it just couldn’t.\n\nHe cupped my chin, and despite myself, I leaned into his touch, the palm still warm enough to make my spine tingle in that pleasant way I hadn’t known was possible.\n\n“And I won’t let you die here.” Mark ran his thumb over my cheek in a tenderness that made a guilty fire blaze inside my heart. “Now hurry up, we don’t have much time.”\n\nTrying to hold myself together, I sorted through the dirty, torn bags, all the while fighting the fog of hypothermia that crept into my brain.\n\n*Gotta stay awake. I can’t pass out, not now.*\n\nMark drew a shuddery breath and cringed at his mutilated leg. “In the top flap there’s a road flare. I need it.”\n\nI found it, a brown cardboard wrapped tube with a red cap on one end. Too numb to be confused, I handed him the flare, and heard plastic clatter to the concrete floor.\n\nInstantly, we both knew exactly what it was.\n\nMark nodded at the little plastic hairbrush, his eyes softening. “Would you . . .”\n\n“Sure.” I placed it in Mark’s cold grasp, and my heart ached at how he clutched the brush to his chest with tender affection.\n\n*He’s losing her. No more Claire, no more kids, no farmhouse in the woods. He’s losing everything . . . all because of me.*\n\nMark shut his eyes, sniffled, and held the brush out to me. “Take this when you go.”\n\nAnother wave of nausea slammed into me, and I whipped my head back and forth. “No, I can’t, I—”\n\n“Maddie, *please*.” His voice broke, halfway between begging and groaning in agony from his wounds. “I don’t want it stuck here too. Take it to Claire, and . . . tell her that I . . .”\n\nI held onto Mark like he was an anchor keeping me from going adrift in the storm. “I know. I’ll t-tell her, I promise.”\n\nHe pushed the brush into my left hand, his own still welded to my right, and a volcano rose inside my brain. I wasn’t just looking at Mark Petric, my goofy friend from work who liked my cupcakes and my terrible karaoke. The man lying beside me meant more to me than all of that, and it hit me now just what *I* was losing.\n\n“I’m sorry.”\n\nIt exploded from me at last, a cascade of emotion all tangled into one giant mess, the tears hot on my face, every breath short and excruciating. I didn’t know what else to say, couldn’t put my feelings into words now when it mattered most, but I knew then that I cared for him more than ever before. I was sorry that I’d let this happen, sorry I’d not stayed in my car, sorry I’d brushed him off in the parking lot, and I was so very sorry that all those months ago, I’d turned away my one chance to be more than Mark Petric’s friend from Carnivore Cove.\n\n“Don’t.” His fingers tightened on mine, and Mark let slide a sympathetic grin that held flickers of something deeper, remnants of feelings that drove nails into my heart. “You have nothing to be sorry for. You’re here, and that’s all that matters. Now, help me up.”\n\nWatching my arms move almost independent of myself, I propped him against the wall, hating every second of it.\n\nMark pulled the red duffel bag close and unzipped it to reveal a metal pressure cooker coated with nails and tape, a bundle of wires that led to some big square batteries, and a repurposed digital stopwatch. Outside, the footsteps thundered closer, and the screeches returned, the horde of Puppets ready to finish the job.\n\n*I wish I had more time. One more minute, one more day, just one. Even if it meant watching him with Claire, I’d be okay with that.*\n\nI shouldered the green bag and turned from the steps to look back at Mark.\n\nHe struck the end of the flare to ignite it, the stairwell bathed in its blood-red light, and threw me a warm, handsome smile for the last time. “You’re still one in a million, Maddie.”\n\nDoing my best to grin through my waterfall of tears, I felt my heart tear in half inside of me. “Goodbye Mark.”\n\nWith that, I smothered a mournful sob, and sped up the stairs.\n\nShadows closed in around me in accusatory sheets, and the tears smeared with Mark’s red blood on my cheek to form a bitter avalanche of regret. Everything seemed to move in slow motion now that seconds counted, and I wanted nothing more than to wake up in my own bed and discover that this entire nightmare was over.\n\nA colossal baleen roar rumbled through the earth, even as I charged through a small metal door at the top of the stairs and skidded to a halt in surprise.\n\nUnlike everywhere else in this hellscape road, the small square room was dry, it’s windows mysteriously intact, and all around the mundane cement walls lay heaps of random items. Pictures, rings, a golden pocket watch that I suspected was Mark’s, and various other trinkets sat in reverent heaps like treasures in the tomb of some ancient civilization. A hollow sensation tore through me at the thought that my sacrifice lay only seventeen steps down from here, with gentle hands, a kind smile, and chocolate brown eyes that melted me every time.\n\n*Focus. The cable. Find the cable.*\n\nTo one side, a pile of dusty multicolored harnesses caught my eye, like the kind we had for the zipline attractions at New Wilderness. It had been a while since I’d been on a zipline, but I didn’t have much of a choice. I picked one, yellow, Mark’s favorite color, and stepped into it.\n\nRabid cries floated up from the ground outside, and a shadowy figure strode into view, fixated on the red glow of Mark’s flare.\n\nShoving open the window above the stack of harnesses, I braced my hands against the dry-rotted frame and leaned out into the icy wind.\n\n*There.*\n\nAbove me, a braided steel cable ran from a heavy mounting, and stretched out into the gloom, far across the soggy grass fields that surrounded the old coal building. A small flicker of hope kindled inside me, the prospect of this ordeal ending like sweet intoxication to my mind.\n\n“Maddie, go!”\n\nMark’s cry split the night, and I glanced down to find the Big One right underneath me, peering into the gap it had made in the stairwell during the previous attack. It slid one massive hand into the breach, and I fumbled to clip the rusted carabiner onto the cable.\n\n*Click.*\n\nThe second it latched on, I threw myself out the window, and the metal cable whined at my rapid descent. I spun on the end of the nylon strap and twisted my neck to look back toward the tower.\n\n*Boom.*\n\nAn explosion ripped through the night, pillars of flame gushed from the hole in the tower, and the Big One let out a long, loud roar of agony. For one slit second, I could see everything silhouetted in the darkness, the Puppets piling on top of each other in an attempt to climb the outer walls, the Big One stumbling backward with its head and arms wreathed in orange flame, and the lonely tower where my best friend had been, coated in thick black smoke.\n\nIt shrank into the distance until darkness swallowed the terrible scene, and I shut my eyes to let loose a wail of unbearable grief. Deep, rending pain brought scream after scream from me, loud sobs and cries I never would have emitted around anyone, wordless sorrow that made me want to die for the emptiness it left in my center.\n\nGone. Mark was gone.\n\nA sudden lurch broke me from my weeping, and I looked up to find myself suspended in space, a large, frayed knot in the cable having stopped me right before a tall, rusty steel pole. The ground lay not far under me, coated in rain-soaked brush and chest-high grass. Was this the exit Mark had spoken of, or once again had I been foiled, tricked by this awful place into yet another hellish maze?\n\nSniffling, I spun on the end of my harness like a spider on its web and peered into the rainy abyss.\n\n*Is that . . . a light?*\n\nMy heart jerked, and I gasped between renewed sobs at a dim, yet discernable white glow not two hundred yards away, across a low-lying section of grassland. It was so close, all I had to do was run to the light, and I’d be free. I could go home.\n\nPulling Mark’s camping knife from my belt, I sawed at the nylon harness, my nerves grating with each snap of the tiny fibers that brought me closer to the inevitable drop.\n\n*Almost there, almost . . .*\n\nLike an invisible hand had released me, I plummeted downward, my heels slamming into the spongy muck of the wet earth. My butt hit the ground next and I almost rolled over in a complete somersault, both legs flying up into the air. The arches of both feet stung, and the wind had been knocked out of me, but I was alive.\n\nSomewhere off to my right, an eerie shriek crackled into the night air, and my blood ran cold.\n\n“Oh, come *on*.” I muttered under my breath, exasperated and desperate. I’d come so far, lost so much, and now my way out was *right there*, yet still I would be hunted like a rabbit to the very end.\n\n*No. Not like a rabbit. I’m not dying like that.*\n\nMy hands found Mark’s shotgun, and I thumbed the safety off.\n\nThrough the clearing, the rain fell, the wind hissed, and everything waited for me to make my move.\n\n*This is for you, Mark.*\n\nI darted through the grass, my sore legs moved underneath me with renewed energy, and the field erupted into chaos.\n\nFrom the mud, twisted and distended limbs dragged macabre figures into the light of my headlamp. Not quite Puppets, but certainly not human, they were broken and torn, rotten and decayed, but worst of all, they were all the same.\n\n“*Maddie.*” They called in sing-song mockery of his soft voice, the dozens of half-rotted Marks staggering after me, their arms outstretched. Each one bore his face, his mousy hair, his strong arms, even his brown eyes, but without the warmth, the life, the love. They materialized in waves from the grass, the trees, and the muck in various stages of decay, repeating any words the darkness had overhead him saying in a cruel mantra.\n\n“*Maddie, run.*”\n\n“*Maddie, please.*”\n\n“*Maddie, stop*.”\n\nFear sliced through me, but it paled in comparison to the grief that came with Mark’s words being replayed from their vile throats. My eyes blurred with tears at how real they looked. The clotted blood made my heart ache, the horrid wounds like razor blades to my soul, and step-by-step, sadness overwhelmed my terror. Mark was dead, yet his death now chased me through the tall grass with Cheshire grins and haunting calls, tormenting me for my mistake.\n\nA figure popped up right in my path, his back to me, and the Mark apparition snapped his head over backwards so that his chin faced the sky.\n\nWith the awful crunching of shattered neck bones, he gave me a wide, inverted smile. “*Strawberry upside down.*” \n\nHe lunged at me with his decayed arms bent at unnatural angles, and a throaty laugh frothed out of his fluid-filled lungs.\n\n“Stop it!” The shotgun bucked against my shoulder, and the apparition’s head disappeared, black goo misting into the air where it had been.\n\nStifling my own tortured sob, I sidestepped the corpse and ran on, the white light just ahead, as more enemies shambled through the grass.\n\nThey closed in from all sides, so much that I stopped trying to aim the shotgun, and simply pumped round after round into every counterfeit Mark that came within range. Pulling the trigger sent a fresh stab into my already destroyed heart, and when they didn’t die right away, they screamed with a surprisingly convincing imitation of Mark’s pained cries. I had to force myself to shoot, to murder him over and over again, and my raw emotions continued to bleed rivers the entire way.\n\nMottled dead hands snagged at my green shoulder bag, and I slipped it off without a glance backward. My scrabbling fingers couldn’t find any more shells in the pockets of Mark’s jacket, so I wielded the twelve gauge like a club, until another apparition caught it by the sling, and yanked it away. There were so many of them, the grass so tall, the hands reaching from everywhere, and the light seemed so far away.\n\nClammy fingers grabbed a fistful of my loose hair, and I drew the last weapon I had.\n\nWith a desperate yell, I spun around and plunged Mark’s knife into the imitation’s face. As soon as it let go, I pushed through a wall of hands, finally able to feel the white light’s rays on my face and threw myself into the grass beyond.\n\nMy foot plummeted over an unseen bank, and I went down.\n\nI rolled, through grass and mud, across a small briar bush, and into a shallow water-filled ditch. Rain clamored down around me, my body ached with fatigue, and overhead, the dark storm clouds rumbled with hidden tongues of lightning. Too exhausted to stand, I lay there in a crumpled heap and shut my eyes, ready for the fiends to rip into me.\n\nI waited.\n\nNothing.\n\nDaring to open my eyes, I sat up. Aside from the whistle of the wind, the curtains of rain and droning thunder, the shrieks had ceased, the apparitions gone. No one called my name, and I could hear no crashing in the underbrush. Somehow, I was alone once more.\n\nConfused, I crawled out of the ditch, and felt something smooth and hard under my palms. What was that? It felt so familiar, yet my tired, frazzled mind couldn’t place it.\n\n*So cold. Got to get warm. Have to get warm and dry.*\n\nI struggled to stand, but fell, my ankles and knees so worn from my ordeal that I could barely move. My skin felt like old rubber, my fingers wouldn’t bend, and I shivered uncontrollably.\n\nThe air began to glow, a loud metallic screeching split the air, and two bright blue orbs stopped not five yards away. Whatever new thing was coming for me would have an easy meal, and I struggled back toward the ditch as the lights flooded over me.\n\nFootsteps thudded nearer, and I raised my hands to shield myself in the blinding aura of the light.\n\n“Maddie?”\n\nI flinched. Perhaps the apparitions had followed me after all?\n\nA man stepped into view, with brown work boots, dark blue jeans and a tan Carhart coat. He had auburn hair like me, and wide worried eyes that took in my bedraggled appearance with horror and disbelief. No doubt I looked like someone from a disaster movie, covered in cuts and bruises, my hair in a tangle, wearing mud-and-blood-smeared clothes that weren’t my own, with a vacant stare in my eyes that had seen things too scarring to forget.\n\n“No.” I shook my head and scuttled away as best I could. I wasn’t going to fall for this, not now.\n\n“Maddie, it’s me.” The man edged closer, his hands held out in a show of peace. “For God’s sake, what happened?”\n\n*It’s not him, it can’t be.*\n\n“You’re not real.” I dragged myself backwards on numb elbows, too weak to fight, but too hateful to die. “You’re not. I know what you are.”\n\n“Madison, listen to me. I’ve been looking for you everywhere. Sweetheart, please.” He stepped closer, and I palmed around for a rock, a stick, anything to use as a weapon.\n\n*I just need to get one good swing at his head.*\n\nBut there was nothing except that strange, hard surface that hung on the edge of my mind as if behind a bank of fog. I had run out of time, and if he was in fact a fake, I might as well find out on my own terms.\n\n“If you’re real.” I met his eyes, sky blue like mine, and fought the instinctive urge to cry. “Then where did we go for my twelfth birthday?”\n\nThe man crouched down onto his heels, and a small, fond smile crossed his face. “Cedar Point.”\n\n*Cedar Point.*\n\nA dam broke inside me, and my eyes pooled with tears I didn’t think I could make. I realized in that moment how the sky already seemed clearer, the rain thinner, the thunder more distant. White painted lines on the hard black asphalt of route 142 stretched away into the night, cool and firm beneath my ragged palms. The lights were headlights, and the man crouched in front of me with two well-worn hands held out . . .\n\n“*Dad*.” \n\nI tried to crawl to him, and my father scooped me off the asphalt without pause. Crying uncontrollably, I let myself fall apart while he carried me to his truck, feeling like I’d just woken up from the worst nightmare of my life. The storm faded, the starry night sky slowly reappeared overhead, and at long last, my fear melted away.\n\nOver. It was over.\n\nAt least, the easy part was.\n\nEvery day afterward became a blur of one horrible situation after another. I was shuffled from the police station, to the hospital, to a therapist in a loop, forced to retell the same story to the point that I gave up trusting anyone. No one believed me, not even my parents, and I had three separate mental breakdowns in the course of a week.\n\nAt first, the police assumed that I’d been brutally assaulted, and suspected Mark. When I vehemently disagreed with that, they decided that someone else had attacked me, and convinced my parents to have me undergo an invasive, uncomfortable examination in the local emergency clinic to prove them wrong. Sitting in that tiny cold room after the exam was over, I bawled my eyes out, feeling more alone than I ever had in my entire life.\n\nNext, the detectives involved with the investigation recruited a therapist who had one too many colors in her attention-desperate butch haircut to put me on a slew of anti-psychotics, which I promptly flushed down the toilet. But the real blow came when they confiscated the clothes Mark had given me, and said they suspected me of killing him, which almost made me vomit the first time one of them suggested it. Without the old T-shirt, flannel jacket, and wrinkled camouflage pants, all I had left to remember Mark by was the pink plastic hairbrush, which I’d hidden in my room the night Dad brought me home.\n\nI would have strangled the person who tried to take it from me.\n\nThis whirlwind of speculation fed the rumor mill at New Wilderness, and soon half of my former friends wanted nothing to do with me, assuming I was in fact responsible for Mark’s death. The other half treated me like some kind of broken china figurine, convinced that Mark had in fact hurt me, and I was just too traumatized to admit it to myself. Even Kendra made snide comments about Mark when she thought I wasn’t paying attention, saying she ‘hoped it was hot’ where he was.\n\nI spent the whole day crying in the bathroom after she said that.\n\nSoon, the story went viral, and people who didn’t even know Mark began trashing him online, saying he deserved what he got, that men like him were scum, and I was a classic example of Stockholm syndrome. More than once I got into comment fights with such keyboard ghouls, and my outbursts got me banned from several platforms. How anyone could believe he’d done something like that, when I was the primary witness who insisted he’d done nothing wrong, made my blood boil.\n\nThen came the funeral.\n\nI found myself walking up to the tiny gray brick funeral home alone, having begged my dad to stay in the car. He’d wanted to come with me, now officially vindicated beyond belief that the world was out to hurt his precious baby girl, and he never went anywhere without his gun tucked into his belt. Still, I made him stay, mainly because I didn’t want him to see all the hateful looks I was sure to get from the people who loved Mark, and thought of me as nothing more than either the source of his reputational slander, or his murderess. It was bad enough that I had to endure their scorn. I didn’t want Dad to see it too.\n\nMy black sweater itched, but it covered me from wrist to neck, made me feel a little more invisible, and didn’t stand out in the crowd. I couldn’t bring myself to sign the visitor roster, my stomach turning sour just looking at the table with Mark’s photograph nestled amongst all the white plastic candles. He would have hated the whole thing, the overwhelming aroma of old-lady perfume, the soft organ music in the background, and the dollar store quilts with pictures of doves on them. Of course, there was no casket, no body; no one here even knew where Mark Petric had died.\n\nNo one but me.\n\nThe line to the little shrine of pictures that stood in for a coffin was long, and I spent most of the time staring at my scuffed black dress boots, the resentful eyes from around the room enough to burn a hole in my heart. It hurt enough to know that Mark was gone, but to be detested by those who loved him, and had been loved by him, that was a new level of torture I’d dreaded for days.\n\nAt last, I reached the front, and stepped underneath the little wicker archway.\n\n*Hey stranger. Long time no see.*\n\nMy heart twitched, and I choked back tears. \n\nDozens of pictures of him decorated the wicker siding and stood in frames on various stands beneath the arch. Mark smiling at high school graduation. Mark in his green army fatigues, fresh out of basic training. Mark at a table in college, sleeping when he should have been studying. Mark embracing a pretty blonde girl, who wore a shiny diamond ring on one finger.\n\nAt last, my eyes settled on Mark in his black New Wilderness uniform shirt, standing with the other veterans during the Veterans Appreciation Day photoshoot. He beamed back at me from the glass frame, proud and gentle, sweet and kind, my best friend, and a good man.\n\n*One I didn’t deserve.*\n\nReaching into my pocket, I pulled out the pink plastic hairbrush, it’s handle still peppered with a few flecks of his dried blood and set it beside the picture. It looked odd amongst all the prim and proper gifts, but I knew it would find its way into the right hands. Besides, I felt better seeing it alongside Mark’s amazing smile.\n\nI turned and found myself at the head of the procession that passed by Mark’s waiting family members, his red-eyed father, weeping mother, stoic sisters, and morose brother. At the end of the line stood a pretty blonde girl, that same diamond ring on her finger, her head hung low with sad, empty eyes glued to the floor.\n\nA few older women pushed past me to throw themselves into the arms of Mark’s mother, and I used them as a smoke screen to slip away from the rest of the crowd.\n\nComing to a stop in front of the blonde girl, I waited till she raised her head, my heart pounding like a trip-hammer. “Claire?”\n\nShe blinked at me, forlorn but calm, as though the girl had already grieved too much to break down on a day like today. Still, in the blue irises that stared back at me, I could see the pain there, the shattered heart of someone who had loved Mark with all her soul, only to have him stolen away without even saying goodbye.\n\n“I’m . . .” I coughed, unsure of how to proceed. “I’m Madison.”\n\n“Oh.” Claire looked back down at her hands and picked nervously at her thumbnail.\n\n*Get it over with, so she can have some comfort in hating you.*\n\nI shut my eyes, pictured Mark’s warm grin, and drew a deep breath. “I was the girl who—”\n\n“I know who you are.”\n\nA stiff cringe almost snapped my spine, but I opened my eyes to find Claire watching me, not with anger or hatred, but with a small, sympathetic smile.\n\n“Mark and I didn’t keep secrets from each other. Before we got engaged, he told me about you. He . . . he said you made really good cupcakes.”\n\n*Of course he did.*\n\nI laughed, though it came out as a choked sob. “Strawberry upside-down.”\n\nClaire fought hard against her own tears, though she sighed fondly in a way that made me feel a million times worse. “Strawberry upside-down.”\n\nSilence reigned between us, and I didn’t know what to say.\n\nHer touch on my arm startled me from my stupor. “You were with him? When it happened?”\n\nMy soul writhed, and tears started to roll down my face, hot and salty. How could I tell her the truth? If anyone deserved to know, it was Claire, but how could I even begin to explain what Mark had died for? He’d braved a terrible unknown, sacrificed everything, his life, his love, his dreams, all for me, and I didn’t even know how to put that into words for his grieving fiancée.\n\nHer eyes locked onto mine, and I saw a desperation there, an excruciating need to know the truth.\n\nI nodded.\n\nClaire shut her eyes, and grimaced against the agony that must have been welling up inside her chest. “H-How did he die?”\n\n*You’re one in a million, Maddie.*\n\nMark’s voice echoed in my head with a thunderclap of clarity, and I forced myself to return Claire’s sad gaze. “Protecting me.”\n\nA flash of pride crossed the pretty features of Claire’s face, and she made a valiant attempt to grin once more. “That sounds like him.”\n\nWe both chuckled through our torment, but I knew I had one last thing to do.\n\n“It’s my fault.” The truth ripped from me like a knife, and I couldn’t stop myself from sobbing, the pain in my chest too much to bear. “I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean for this to happen, I didn’t know . . .”\n\nShe wrapped me in a tight hug before I could say anything more, and I felt moist tears on my shoulder as we mourned together. There was no insincerity in her embrace, no reservation or faux kindness, just the empathy of someone who hurt for the same reason as I did. With the whole world watching, my internal protective walls crumbled, and I wept with Claire over the man who had changed our lives forever.\n\nWe talked and shared stories about Mark for the rest of the night, until Dad wandered in to make sure I was okay. Claire turned out to be really nice, and we decided to stay in touch, the first real friendship I’d had since that awful night. I figured Mark would have wanted that, for both of us.\n\nAll that was four months ago. *Four months.* It feels like a horrible lifetime, someone else’s life, a foreign dream where I don’t belong, but am trapped in all the same.\n\nThat’s why I volunteered to take Mark’s place in the Night Rangers.\n\nAt first, everyone in the park was against it, but I begged the head of security until he finally agreed out of sheer pity. Of course, my parents were furious, but they knew they couldn’t stop me, not after I told them that I’d go even if I had to walk. I know no one else will understand, but the instant I saw the position come up for new applicants, I knew it had to be me. Even now, sitting here in the company truck next to the visitor center, I can hear thunder booming in the distance as the sky grows darker, the lighting rippling in the clouds, calling to me with cruel anticipation.\n\nMy father’s Armalite rifle is propped up on the passenger seat, along with a canvas bandoleer full of loaded magazines. The necklace that my grandma got for me is around my neck, so I have something to sacrifice if I make it that far. In the event that I don’t, my grandpa’s old bowling bag holds a steel pressure cooker filled with jellied gasoline, the outside covered with taped-on framing nails and several batteries wired to a digital baking timer. I suppose the FBI will freak if they ever find this post, but they don’t have to worry. I’m not after them.\n\nIf you’re reading this, Dad, Mom, I love you. I hope I can tell you in the morning, but if not, then understand that this isn’t suicide, not technically. I’m doing my job as a ranger. That *thing* killed my best friend, and if someone doesn’t stop it, it’s only a matter of time before the Big One takes more innocent people. Mark knew that, and it cost him everything. I can’t let his death be in vain.\n\nTo anyone else who just so happens to stumble upon this final excerpt of my sad little tale, I hope you live your life well. Soak up the sun, find a job you love, and most importantly, hold on to the people who care about you. You never know when you’re going to lose them.\n\nAnd if you are ever around the New Wilderness Wildlife Reserve on a stormy, rainy night, please . . . stay *away* from Tauerpin Road.",

        "text": " [\"The Devil's Mouth\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/qt2wt7/the_devils_mouth/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n\n“Come over here boy.” \n\nJolted back to reality by my grandfather’s command I stiffly removed myself from the hospital chair I’d been sitting in for the better part of three days and replaced myself on the edge of the bed he would more than likely never leave again. \n\n“I don’t know why I still call you ‘boy’” he said effortfully between labored breaths. Each one a borrowed moment, final grains of sand in an almost empty hourglass.  “It’s hard to explain if you aint got kids of yer own. My eyes see a man, but my heart still sees a messy haired boy running around the woods with his brother . . . My heart gets the better of me sometimes, believe it or not.” \n\nHe began to laugh, but it was quickly cut off by deep coughs and gasps for air. His weak and skeletal-like arm reaching out for the plastic cup of water beside him as he did so. I grabbed the water and helped him drink it.\n\n“I’ll call the nurse okay grandpa?”\n\n“No, please.” He said through wheezes and groans. “If I got one dying wish it’s to never see that dumb fucking woman ever again.” \n\nThis time it was my turn to laugh. Even on his deathbed at ninety-eight years old, my grandfather had kept every bit of his rattlesnake temperament. He liked what he liked and hated what he didn’t, and hospitals were always at the top of his hated list. \n\n“Where’s little Caleb at?” He asked once he’d recovered enough to talk again.\n\n“He’s deployed, he’s in Jordan until September I think.”\n\n“Ah . . That’s right. I don’t think I’ll last that long . . .You’ll have to do it alone.” \n\nI couldn’t help but furrow my brow in response. The doctors said his medications would make him a little disoriented, but in the three days I’d been here he’d been for the most part a frailer version of his regular old self. If it wasn’t for the fact that he was dying I wouldn’t have known that he was dying. \n\n“Do what now Grandpa?” \n\n“You remember the necklace I gave your brother?”\n\nChills ran up my spine as the events leading up to the gifting of that necklace came back into my memory. Going into “The Devils Mouth” with Caleb, getting grabbed by whatever ungodly thing was in that hole, trying to run on a broken leg. I’d tried so many times to convince myself it was a bear, that between the dark and the adrenaline and fear I’d somehow created an image of something that wasn’t there, but every time I’d come close to putting it behind me I’d remember that damn necklace, and I’d remember that skull I’d tried to take before everything went to hell, and there was no explanation for it . . . Or perhaps there was. Deep down, I knew there was. The real question I always found myself dodging was if the light the explanation would reveal would be too much for me to accept. \n\n“y-yeah.” I finally responded, trying in vain to conceal the feelings of fear and anxiety that had tethered themselves to the memory of it. “He still has it I think . . . We don’t talk about it much.”\n\n“I know.” He responded. Something close to empathy behind the words. “It aint a pretty thing, but it’s the real thing . . . and it’s our real thing. I don’t have to tell you that what you saw in that cave weren’t no fuckin bear. Aint been a bear round those woods since the eighties.” \n\nI nodded slowly in reluctant agreement. You don’t argue with grandpa, and it’d be pointless to anyways. It’s a fool who argues with a man you know is right. \n\nSeveral more gasps and deep breaths interrupted my thoughts, this one more violent than the first. As I reached for the call light, I felt my grandfather’s strong grip on my wrist. It was incredible how much strength the man had even in such a state. \n\n“In my box” more coughs and exasperated breaths “at home . . . You’ll find everything you need in there.”\n\n“Let me call the nurse grandpa, I know you hate her, but there’s no way she’s worse than thi-“\n\n“Listen!” he barked as loudly as a man in his state could muster. Drawing my complete attention to what he was saying once more. “It was supposed to be your daddy, but . . . but.” \n\nDad had been killed in Fallujah when Caleb and I were small, we didn’t remember him much, but Grandpa never truly got over it. Maybe because he never talked about it. I know he cried about it though, twice I’d caught him weeping in the forest by the little cross he’d built in their favorite spot, so caught up in his grief that he never knew I saw him. \n\n“I know grandpa, it’s okay. I’ll find the box, and whatever needs done I’ll do it. I owe it to you.”\n\nI held back tears as my grandfather reached his hand up and grasped the nape of my neck, firmly but with care as he’d done so many times throughout my life. His bright green eyes stared intently into mine as the next words came out in almost a whisper.\n\n“I’m sorry I was hard on you two. . . My heart sees a messy haired boy, but when you were a messy haired boy my heart saw my messy haired boy, and it hurt something fierce to look at, but I tried my hardest . . . Harder than I’ve ever tried at anything else . . . and I’m proud.” \n\nAt this the tears I’d been holding back let go. This man who’d taught me everything I knew, who’d sacrificed so much, how a boy could grow up without a dad, and still have the best father a boy could ever ask for? \n\n“I’m gonna miss you Granpda.” I blurted through the tears. \n\n“Don’t . . . don’t cry for me boy” he said heavily, his eyes began to close as his voice trailed off, like someone who was simply falling asleep mid conversation.  “Ninety-eight years . . . That’s a good . . .\n\nThat’s a good. . .”\n\nWith that my grandfather exhaled one more deep and efforted breath. After a few moments the heart monitor he’d been hooked up to went from slow and steady beeps to the silent tone of a flat line. I called for the nurse, but I knew that it was pointless. He was gone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“The box” was pretty easy to find. Although it was admittedly it wasn’t so much a box as it was a makeshift trunk. It was heavy as I pulled it out of the closet that my grandfather had stowed it in, but as I sat on the edge of the bed in this now eerie empty house, I knew that the contents stowed inside were going to be even heavier. Perhaps heavier than I could carry. \n\n*Whatever needs done I’ll do it. I owe it to you.* The memory of my deathbed oath reminded me hauntingly. With a deep breath I unlatched the box and lifted the lid. \n\nI don’t really know what I expected, relics of a time long passed. More jewelry adorned with monstrous teeth. What lay before me, at least initially though was far more mundane. A light wooden panel with a leather-bound journal, and just beside it a letter assigned to me and my brother, as I lifted the letter and drew it close to read, I could tell it was my grandfather’s writing. \n\n*If you’re reading this, then it means I’m dead and gone. We’ve said our goodbyes, and you’ve cried your tears, but now there’s work to do.*\n\n*I’ve told you a lot of stories about the Cherokee. Stories my grandpappie used to tell me when I was little. Stories his daddy told him. Stories the Cherokee told him. Our family weren’t like other folks in the early days. We loved the hills, we loved the ancient trees and streams, and we had respect for the people that were living here when we came around, and because we respected them, they respected us . . . It weren’t just us and Cherokee living in these hills though . . .* \n\n*The journal beside you will explain it better than I ever could. So I’ll leave you two to read it, but as you do, you remember and you remember good that our people have been hill folk since America was called the new world, and hill folk don’t sit and write in little diaries unless we got a really good reason to. Read what you read as gospel, and don’t you dare refuse the torch bein’ handed to you. You two are Skarmar, men of the hills, and don’t you ever forget it.*\n\n*-Grandpa* \n\nAs I read and re-read the letter there were only more questions than answers. Deciding there was no point in procrastinating I flipped open the leather-bound journal and began to read. The first entries were signed “Owen J” my great great grandfather perhaps? \n\n*May: Cherokee found another camp today; Three Pines and his father came to me early in the morning to show me. They sleep during the day in their caves, or in the mounds of dirt they build when they don’t have caves. They told me not to bring my musket. Said it’d be pointless; I suppose they’re right. We hiked about an hour west and found them in a gorge. Three of them, two were nearly taller than our cabin some eight feet in height but the third had must have been twelve and one half. Maybe bigger. We stayed low in the brush and watched them sleep for as long as it was safe and took our leave as quietly as possible. We made sure to be far away before speaking with one another.* \n\n*Three Pines says these are runts, weaker ones that got kicked out. If a weak one is as big as that how big are the strong ones? How is it even possible? He says if they find the Cherokee camp, or our cabin they’ll kill everyone and eat anything they can. War parties going to take them out tomorrow soon as the sun breaks. Three Pines asked if I’d come with my musket. No one fights quite like the Cherokee, but the Swamp Fox taught us a lot during the war. I’ll do my part.* \n\n*May: They’re dead, but most of the war party was killed as well. They’re smarter than we thought. They were waiting for us. Pulling grown men and their horses off of the ground and tearing them to pieces like they were straw dolls. Crushing them into dust with a single stomp. How something so big can move so fast I will never know. Myself, and a few other Cherokee Marksmen managed to take down the big one. Took us damn near two shots each. It did a lot of damage before we finally took it down. I wish we’d have been quicker. War party had managed to pretty much kill one of the little ones when the other turned them into sacks of bone powder with a tree sapling. Four grown men crushed into oblivion like ants. I’ve seen a lot of death, but the sound a man's bones make when they break like that . . . I’ll never forget it. Three Pines managed to take out the remaining one almost single handedly. I took a shot, but in my nervous haste I’d used too much powder, the recoil threw my shot off. The noise, however, was enough to distract him long enough for Three Pines to climb up his back and wound him badly with his tomahawk. The remaining Cherokee swarmed the injured beast as soon as they could and stabbed it until their spears broke.* \n\n*The wounded one was trying to crawl away. One of the Cherokee approached it to finish him off, but he wasn’t careful enough. Caught the poor kids’ leg and damn near tore it off his waist. Three hammer fists into his chest as soon as he hit the ground before I could shoot it in the back of the head.*\n\n*Some Thirty men, myself not included. Maybe six remained after the fight was said and done. One of the men was wounded badly. I don’t think there’s a medicine man alive that could save him. Three Pines took the heads from the gigantic corpses. Thanked me for helping, and we went our separate ways.* \n\n*If those were the weak ones. . . I pray we never find the strong ones.* \n\n*May: Howls from the mountains all night last night. Unlike anything I’ve ever heard. Some so tremendous that the earth would shake.* \n\n*July: Three Pines met with me again today. He was somber. Said his father had been killed. Asked if I could buy a powder keg from the trading post and handed me furs to trade for it. Moving powder makes me nervous, but not half as nervous as the thought of those monsters, and the colonists won’t trade with Indians like the English and French would. I’ll make my way towards the trading post tomorrow. The weather holds I’ll be back in two days’ time.*\n\n*August: We killed another one, even bigger than the last. They eat each other. The cave we found her in was riddled with bones bigger than I’d ever seen. Could the two smaller ones we killed in May have been cattle for the big one? Is this one a wendigo as well as a giant? We waited in complete silence until she’d finished her meal and was full, when the sun rose, she lazily went deeper into the cave and was asleep within minutes. Three pines pointed towards the cave and two men I’d recognized from the last fight snuck towards the mouth of it, each carrying a powder keg over their backs. Brave men. Slowly they crept back, and once they were back within the safety of the brush Three Pines looked up at my spot high in a torch pine tree and curled his finger in and out several times. I understood his intentions. Carefully I took aim at the powder kegs and fired. The blast knocked me out of the tree.* \n\n*Three Pines carried me back to their camp. Said we’d collapsed the whole mouth of the cave. Couldn’t take her head if we wanted to. I didn’t want to, but when Three Pines handed me a necklace full of teeth, some sharp like an animal’s and others flat. It felt good to receive it. Nothing that horrible should be allowed to walk this earth, and I’ll be a dead man before I let them eat my family, be that my family at home, or my brothers beside me. Three Pines seemed to read my expression; he had a habit of such things. I knew then we had a mutual understanding. We would hunt them all. We would slaughter them without mercy. Down to the last. If we could not slay them, then we would die facing them.*\n\nAs I continued to read through the journal, I shook my head in disbelief at the words before me. Giants in the Appalachian foothills? Who could possibly believe such a thing? However, as I attempted in vain to laugh away at what in another life, I may have found absurd. The events that had happened to my brother and I in “The Devils Mouth” crept into the vulnerable places of my mind. The bones that littered the floor, the strange skull, the roars that shook the earth. . . It was no coincidence. Logic was trying to win, but something deeper in me knew the logic was wrong.\n\nAs I continued to read through the journal entries everything began to fall terrifyingly into place, generation after generation of hunting these things down wherever they turned up. Even after the Cherokee were all but gone, even after several horrible deaths of close family members, our ancestors continued to pursue the giants relentlessly. Glued to what I was reading well into the small hours of the night I read through account after account after account. \n\nAs flipped pages grew thicker on the left side of the binding, and sparser on the right I once again saw my grandfather’s distinct and familiar penmanship, all to recognizable against the added pages. \n\n*December 26th, 1968: Finally got him. Fucker hid in that cave for weeks smelling a trap, but giants got to eat just like anything else. Looks like I guessed his height good too. That grenade bouquet must’ve gone off right at face level. About 25 feet, give or take. It’s only the big ones left now. Them “Little” ones got killed off probably in the thirties. Hard to tell how many got buried accidently by the railroad company and the coal miners blasting dynamite all over the place. I know for a fact a few got killed and sent to the Smithsonian where their bones are probably locked in a warehouse somewhere. Learned men can’t have people thinking giants are real though, could they? It’d get in the way of science. I’ll keep looking, but who knows? Maybe that was the last one. What was left of him was skin and bones. They can’t go out and hunt like they used to.*  *Merry Christmas* \n\n*October 8th, 1978: Found two, they’ve been moving around. Can probably do a lot of relocating underground, but they had to go outside to get into “The Devils Mouth.” I’d recognize those crazy four toed footprints anywhere. I’ll set up a blind today and see what I can do.*\n\n*October 9th, 1978: Bullseye, nailed one of them square between the eyes with the M40 as soon as he tried to leave the cave. Dropped him like a bag of bricks. The other one dragged his corpse inside. There was a lot of that “Wail roaring” they make when their mates are killed. Stupid bitch don’t be sad just come out and join him.* \n\n*December 1st: 1978 Still no movement. No tracks out. No surprise though. She’s probably living off the body of the other one. She’ll have a lot to eat.* \n\n*July 25th, 1981: Cannot believe how long she’s been hiding in there. I don’t want to risk it, but it looks like I’ll have to go in.*  *not far, just deep enough to collapse the entrance. If there was no other way in, then a doubt there’s a way out.*\n\n*August 8th: 1981 She fucked me up good and proper. Piece of shit, two broken legs and my back is shot. Told the doctors it was a bear. City folk have no idea what bear attacks look like. You could come in with an arrow in your head and tell them a bear did it. There’s a hole within the cave. No clue how deep it goes, but it’s enough for her to peak out and take wild swipes, grab at whatever walks in. That’s she hunts now, like some kind of ginormous trapdoor spider. Animals walk in and never leave. It’s a pathetic existence, but it works I guess. Going have figure something else out once I’m healed up. I don’t want to drag the boy into it yet. He’s got a bit of life to experience before I turn it upside down on him. If this really is the last one, then maybe he’ll never even have to know. Best to just take care of it myself. She aint going nowhere.*\n\nAs I flipped through the remaining pages it didn’t take long to realize that August 8th was the last journal entry. Sitting back against the rocking chair I had been reading in, hardly noticing the aches of my now stiff joints and lower back. It was too much to process. If it was just one relative who had written this journal then I could’ve easily dismissed it as tall tales from a time long gone. If I hadn’t seen it myself I could say that once upon a time these things were real, but greater men than me had taken care of the issue, but neither option was the reality, and because of that I had only the actual reality of it all to dwell on. It was a weight that seemed to grow heavier and heavier with each passing breath. \n\n“Fuck it, I can just go.” I said out loud to the empty bedroom. It wasn’t the worst idea. Someone else would come along. The government would buy the land, some wannabe homesteader would never dare venture out that far into the woods. Maybe that . . .whatever it was that was hiding in the depths of “The Devils Mouth” would really just starve and die on its own, but still the haunting words of my oath to my dying grandfather interrupted every fearful conclusion I tried to conjure in the silence of this empty house. \n\n*Whatever needs done. I’ll do it. I owe it to you.*\n\n“Well, that settles it then.” I told myself finally resigning to the horrible task before me as I placed the journal back into the crate. As I placed it down, I noticed the hollow thumping sound the leather-bound book made against the wood panel inside the box. \n\nFeeling along the sides of the panel I found a spot to lift up the fake bottom. As I lifted the panel out of the crate and looked back down into the bottom of It I felt another sinking feeling in my stomach. The journal had made my experience in “The Devils mouth” real, but the contents I looked at now made the understanding that I was going to have to go back there even more so. I’d never been in any kind of real combat situation, but I’d seen enough movies and History channel documentaries to know what a grenade looked like . . And this box was almost full of them.",

        "text": "It started like every other client. A meet and greet mid-day, before sundowning starts. My shift was 8p-8a, the midnight schedule. This is one-on-one care, specifically Alzheimer's care. Typically, the meet and greet is preformed with family present, and you do a walk through of the house as well as get a feel for the client's personality. It is especially important for midnight staff, as we're usually on our own more than any other shift. \n\nThis time, I was greeted by a coworker instead. She was an older woman, and there was a kind but no nonsense feel to her. She told me she had been working with him for several years, since care had been requested. His children didn't live in the area, and rarely visited the house. It would be just me and her providing 24hr care until they could find a 3rd caregiver to stay. I remember her leading me into the kitchen to greet my nearly 90 year old client. He was just lovely, and immediately wanted to know if I'd eaten. After meeting him, I wondered several times why they were having trouble keeping caregivers.\n\nHis house was almost as lovey as him. In Southern Michigan, situated in the suburbs around Detroit, just far enough North not to be described as \"Northern Ann Arbor\". He had a larger piece of land, with a house built into the side of a hill. From the road, you couldn't tell it was more than a simple ranch. \n\nInside was different. You walked into a large foyer, with a grand staircase to the basement, opposite the front door. A door on the left of the foyer lead to the kitchen, where the far wall is floor to ceiling windows. This overlooked a forested back yard. A door on this wall lead to a 2nd floor wrap around porch. I was told it stays locked, and is wired to an alarm system for the client's safety. To the right of the foyer, there was 2 options. A hallway, which lead to 2 bedrooms, an office, and a bathroom. One of those was the client's bedroom. The other option was an archway leading to the livingroom, which also had floor to ceiling windows overlooking the back.\n\nAfter meeting the client and being shown around the top floor, we went over chores expected. It was all very normal. Wipe things down, sweep the floors. The only thing that stood out was laundry. That is typically a midnight responsibility, and I was used to doing it. My coworker insisted she do it on her shift. The explanation she gave was that there had been issues with other staff doing it, so she just does it herself. I figured there was some level of OCD involved, and didn't pay any more attention to it. We wrapped up our scheduled walk through, out of time thanks to pleasant conversation. I still hadn't seen the basement. Nothing beyond the darkness of the staircase, where you could faintly see tile at the bottom.\n\nThe next evening, I came for my first shift. All went well and as expected. The client went to sleep around 10-11pm, and I started in on chores. \n\nNow, I don't scare easy. It's one of the reasons I work midnights with ease. That random noise? Plumbing. Ball of light? Was probably a car. Child's giggle from the attic? Not my business. No, but seriously, it's hard. So at around 2am, there was a loud noise I thought came from the basement. I go to the top of the stairs, and can feel a draft. With more irritation than fear, as it's my first shift (what could have gone wrong!?) I turn on the light and head down there. \n\nAt the bottom, the door leading to outside was firmly locked. Spiderwebs still intact. I could see the door on my left lead to the laundry room. I flipped the light switch, and nothing happened. Out comes my phone, and I shine it's flashlight around the room. Nothing out of the ordinary. \n\nTo my right is what looks like a dancing room. Checkered white and black flooring, and a grand piano. There was nothing else in the room, except a doorway leading out. I crossed the room, turning on the lights, and looked into the doorway. It was bigger than I expected. This hallway led to 4 bedrooms, and 2 bathrooms. All of which got their lights turned on, but none appeared out of the ordinary. Decorated with beds in each, and a lot of dust.\n\nFurther down, the hallway opened into what looked like a little home bar. I turned the lights on, and had a look. There was a semi circle bar, with 5 stools turned upside down on the counter. Behind the bar was fully stocked, with both opened and unopened bottles. The wall decorated with knick knacks from different places, and pictures behind them. Everything covered in thick dust. The noise long forgotten by now, I want to look at this cool stuff. As I'm looking closer, my phone flashlight still on, I feel the breeze and remember why I'm down there. It's been about 5-10 minutes by now. \n\nThe hallway continues on the other side of this home bar, and opens into a LARGE carpeted living room. There's a white couch on the far side, near sliding glass doors. That's where I go to look first, and I notice it's unlocked and slightly ajar. Spiderwebs and dust disturbed. I try to close it all the way, and it does, but it just won't lock. That must be the noise and the draft! Giving up, but glad I solved the mystery, I turn around and examine the room.\n\nThere's a child's jump rope on the floor, in the middle of the room. Weird, for this environment. There's also a standing record player, with a whole file of vinyls. Dust is covering everything so thick, you can see it settled on the couch. The most strange is the pool table. It's in the corner of the room, with a light on directly overhead. 2 pool sticks lean, haphazardly, against the walls. Not returned to the wrack hanging feet away. Dust covers the whole table, obviously abandoned mid game, with little piles on of each ball. \n\nCuriosity is a strong force. I picked up one of the balls. As soon as I touched it, every light went out. Only the light from my phone still shone, as I gently put the ball back down. I kept my eyes down, and quickly made for the hallway. Walking briskly, I went back through the bar, past the bedrooms, through the piano room, and to stairs. As soon as I stepped on the first stair leading up, all the lights switched back on. I didn't go back to turn them off.\n\nThe rest of my shift was spent holed up in the room directly across from my client. All lights on. He didn't wake up once. When dayshift staff arrived, I gave a very quick report, and went home to bed. Old electric can really be scary sometimes. The following evening, I arrived at my clients home. To my surprise, my coworker wasn't alone. The client's daughter was there as well, waiting outside for me. I got out of my car to greet her, and instead she had a look of fear on her face, and a question for me.\n\n\"You went in the basement, didn't you?\"",

        "text": " It was close to three in the afternoon when the knock came on the door to the ranger station. I was mildly surprised to hear it, given that it was early January in the foothills of the Adirondacks and the temperature was hovering at a balmy *12 degrees*, with wind chills driving it into the negatives with frustrating frequency. The wind had been howling against the isolated station since before sunrise that morning, and I wondered if I was going to need to deal with any damage to my little abode after the storm blew through. I’d been monitoring the forecast and weather radar all day, and it looked like I was in for quite the blizzard by the time evening rolled around. It had been snowing most of the day already, but so far it hadn’t been very heavy. I expected that to change by nightfall, however, which, in January, was only in another couple hours.\n\nI didn’t usually keep the front door to the ranger station locked, since it wasn’t  uncommon for hikers and campers to make a pit stop on their way up the trail to the observation areas, either to log their camping site for the night or just in hopes of a nice hot cup of coffee before they continued on their hike. The door hadn’t been latching correctly lately, though, and had the tendency to swing open when a strong gust caught it just right, so I’d been keeping it locked until I could repair it. \n\nThe knocking was light, somehow hesitant and almost polite, if that makes any sense. It was so quiet that I almost didn’t hear it over the whistling of the wind and creaking of the station. I’d been in the middle of composing an email request for a new generator, as mine had been acting up a bit lately, and had to pause my typing and listen intently to ensure I’d even heard it in the first place. When it came again, only a bit louder, I pushed back from my desk and took another sip from my steaming mug before walking over and opening the door.\n\nOutside stood five people, three men and two women, all dressed in what looked like expensive and very new cold weather coats and snow pants, all looking very similar except for the various bright colors and all bearing the familiar North Face logo. Their anxious faces peeked out from within their drawn and cinched hoods, and I had to suppress a grin. They looked dressed to climb Everest, not hike the lower trails of the Adirondacks. \n\n*Tourists. Probably European and probably their first time seeing this sort of weather,* I thought. It was a fairly common occurrence. Folks from all over the world came to visit these mountains, looking to experience all the beautiful wilderness we had to offer. I wasn’t unsympathetic; if you weren’t used to the unpredictable climate here in the winter, it could quickly catch you by surprise and get dangerous very quickly. \n\n“Hi there!” I said cheerfully, stepping back into the doorway and motioning them inside. “Come in out of the snow and warm up by the fire.”\n\nThe man who’d been knocking turned to his companions, said something in Spanish, and then turned back to me with a wide grin and nodded, stepping past me and into the warmth of the station. The rest followed quickly, anxious to get out of the chill wind that was blowing hard outside. As soon as they were all in, I closed the door again and locked it to make sure it didn’t blow open.\n\n“Gracias, sir. I am Martin.” said the man, pulling back his hood and unzipping his quilted down coat. He gestured to the others in turn. “This is Lucas, Diego, Sophia, and Triana.” \n\nI nodded my greeting to each.\n\nMartin continued with a smile. “It is very cold. We come to visit USA from Spain, to see your beautiful mountains and enjoy the lovely scenery.” His accent was very heavy, but his English was far better than my Spanish, so I didn’t have much room to criticize. “But it seems a storm is coming and we fear there will be too much snow. Unfortunately, we are not so prepared for that.”\n\nI nodded, patting him on the shoulder as I moved past him and opened the door leading to the shelter room, reaching in and turning on the lights. “That’s certainly true, my friend. I’m afraid we’re in for a bit of a blizzard this evening. Bad time for a winter stroll through the mountains,” I said. “Fortunately, we happen to have enough space for you and your friends to make yourself at home and wait out the storm. My name is Jackson Turner, ranger. There’s coffee over there on the table, and bunks and a comfortable sitting area in here.”\n\nWhen the group just stared at me blankly for a moment, I got the feeling I’d lost most of them somewhere along the way. Instead, I just offered the friendliest smile I had and gestured to the room. At that, they all grinned and nodded their thanks as they quickly shuffled past me, dropping their packs on various bunks and beginning to remove their cold weather gear.\n\nI made sure they all got something hot to drink and that they understood they were welcome to stay until the weather had cleared before returning to my desk. They all seemed very pleasant and grateful for my assistance, and they drifted from my thoughts as I continued my administrative work.\n\nIt was another hour before the second knocking rapped at the door, this one slow and oddly arrhythmic, almost a staccato beat, somehow unsteady and not as tentative as my other guest’s had been. I sighed heavily and straightened, heading around the counter and back over to the door. I hadn’t had any visitors to the ranger station in a week or more, and now they were pouring in like this was a Holiday Inn Express or something.\n\nI unlocked the door and pulled it open, putting on my official *greeting* smile once again.\n\nIn the doorway, shoulders and hooded head covered in a layer of icy snow, was a man of roughly my height – about six foot or so. Unlike the others, he wasn’t dressed in fancy, color-coordinated cold weather gear, but instead wore a mismatched combination of clothes, like he had raided the bargain bin at a secondhand expedition store. His pants were a blue quilted nylon and looked more on the expensive side, even if they didn’t exactly fit him very well, but his coat was fur-lined and looked like it was made of padded wool, layered over an old fleece jacket. His boots looked newer and not too warm – something more suited to a summer hike than a winter in the mountains, I thought. \n\n“Hey there,” I said as warmly as I could, waving him inside. “Come on in out of the snow.”\n\nHe didn’t say anything, but gave the slightest hint of a nod as he walked past me. The strong scent of musky body odor followed him, and I wondered if he was one of those reclusive hermits that I’d heard rumors of, living out here all by himself in some makeshift shack. \n\nI closed the door and locked it again, turning back to the man. He’d already taken note of the bunk room to the left, where the Spaniards were getting settled, and he headed on in and sat on one of the empty bunks in the back corner of the room. He didn’t remove his coat or offer any greeting to the others, and I noted with some curiosity that he didn’t have any sort of pack with him, which further made me wonder if he lived nearby in some off-grid cabin. \n\nI could see that the others were smiling and making pleasantries towards him, but he just sat there, dark eyes quietly watching the activity without a single word. There was the slightest hint of a smile upon his lips, incongruous and somehow unnerving. It only took them a few moments to abandon their attempts at including him in conversation and turn back to their own group, speaking quietly in Spanish amongst themselves.\n\nFor a moment, I wondered if he might be in some sort of shock. The temperature was dropping pretty quickly outside, and it had already been too cold for some of the clothing he wore. I considered giving him a quick once-over to make sure he didn’t have any frostbite or signs of hypothermia, but something about him told me he might not be so welcoming to my attention. \n\nI stood there in the doorway to the bunk room for a minute, looking over the scene. Something about the newcomer seemed…*off*, somehow. I couldn’t quite put my finger on it, but the way he moved, his lack of communication, the way he was just sitting there perfectly still on the corner bunk, just seemed strange. There was something else, too. Something that I couldn’t quite put my finger on. Something that tickled the back of my consciousness, just out of reach, more an instinctive unease than coherent thought. I found myself hoping the man would spend a few minutes warming himself and then be on his way again.\n\nTurning my attention to the others, I realized that they must have found something odd with him as well, as they had all subconsciously clustered around the end of the table farthest from him and were speaking more quietly than before, more subdued. I noticed them periodically casting quick, uncomfortable glances in his direction, but never for more than the briefest of moments, as if they were just reassuring themselves that he hadn’t moved and was still sitting there. I also noticed curiously that none of them sat with their back to the man, likely also subconsciously. \n\nI was just about to walk over and talk to him, to shake the odd feeling away, when Martin appeared in front of me, his brow furrowed.\n\n“Sir, my friends and I are worried about the other campers,” he said.\n\nThis drew my attention. There weren’t any campers registered to be out here today. Was the newcomer one of them? Maybe they were in trouble.\n\n“What campers?” I asked with a frown.\n\nHe motioned vaguely to the north. “We passed their campsite on our way to the observation point, before the weather turned us back here. Maybe a half-kilometer up the trail, in a clearing beside a small brook.” He cast a quick look over his shoulder at the stranger sitting in the corner. *There it was again*, I thought – that same unease. \n\nMartin continued. “There were three of them; two men and a woman. They had some of those cold weather tents set up and seemed to be well-prepared for the storm, at least as far as we could tell. We stopped and warmed ourselves by their fire for a bit. They seemed very experienced and were not concerned about the cold, but I am no expert.”\n\n“Well, it sounds like they should be okay,” I said with the best reassuring smile I could muster. “They should have checked in with me, but if they’re as prepared as you think, I’m sure they’ll be just fine. When the storm passes, I’ll head up there and check on them, just to make sure.”\n\nHe flicked his eyes to the man again and then locked them with mine with a surprising intensity, like he was trying to tell me something with his gaze alone. He lowered his voice and said, “The campers, they were all wearing *very* good clothing. Sophia’s brother is a climber in some very cold regions and she recognized the campers’ gear as similar to what he uses.”\n\n“Even better news, then,” I started, but Martin cut me off.\n\n“*Exactly* like the pants that man is wearing now,” he said quietly.\n\nI looked over at the man again, once again taking note of his hodge-podge combination of clothing. The gloves he still wore looked to be thin and ill-suited to the winter weather, but looked well-made and would have been fine for a mild autumn outing. He still hadn’t moved or said anything, and his emotionless eyes drifted slowly across the Spaniards with what seemed to my growing paranoia like a hungry interest. It was almost like he was inventorying them, evaluating them, somehow.\n\nOnce again, that tickle in the back of my brain, telling me something was not quite right with the man. Something was just a little out-of-place, but I still couldn’t figure it out. \n\nIt set my teeth on edge.\n\nI looked back at Martin. “Are you sure?”\n\nHe shrugged. “As sure as we can be. Sophia says she is certain, but the rest of us do not have the experience to recognize these details as well as her.”\n\n“Was this man with them?” I asked, but I already knew the answer.\n\nMartin shook his head. “No. I have never seen him before now.” He leaned in a little closer and lowered his voice. “This man, there is something…,” he said, trailing off, unable to find the right words.\n\nI nodded. “I know. I feel it, too.” \n\nI walked back to my desk and opened a drawer, retrieving the holstered handgun and attaching it to my belt. The spare magazine went into my pocket, and I grabbed my heavy jacket from a nearby hook and pulled my fur-lined hat over my ears.\n\nMartin followed me, watching with interest. I looked over his shoulder, making sure we were out of sight and earshot of the bunk room. \n\n“I’m going to check on the camp. Have you ever handled a shotgun?” I asked.\n\nHe nodded. “I hunt pheasant with my cousins every year. I am a very good shot.”\n\n“Good,” I said. “That doorway beside my desk is my room. Right inside you’ll find a twelve-gauge pump, loaded but not chambered. If you need it.”\n\nHe just gave a silent duck of his head.\n\n“I should be back within the hour. I know the place you’re talking about. Keep him here until I return, but don’t do anything if you don’t have to,” I said, closing my coat and making sure the zippered slit covering my holster was open and accessible.\n\n“Be careful, Jackson Turner. I feel some darkness in the air.”\n\nI just gave a tight-lipped nod before opening the door and stepping out into the wind. \n\nThe icy chill hit me immediately, cutting through my heavy pants and finding its way through every little opening in my clothing. The wind out here was a constant buffeting and howled in my ears. The snow along the trail was only a little over ankle-deep, but tugged at my boots with every step, slowing my progress. \n\nThe area that Martin had described was one of the few marked campsites along this area of the trail, and though it wasn’t strictly required for campers to check in before setting up, it was highly encouraged. This deep in the woods, twenty miles away from the nearest town, the only real lifeline that anyone had were the rangers. If anything went wrong out here, the fact that you registered with the local ranger station may very well mean the difference between life and death. \n\nThat didn’t mean that everyone followed that rule, though. Most of the time, it was new campers, those folks lacking some of the wisdom of experience, that didn’t know or didn’t think it necessary to check in before setting camp. Sometimes, it was the opposite; some highly experienced outdoors folks felt that there was no need, that they could handle anything that came their way.\n\nEither way, as I followed that northern trail, a growing unease began to color my steps. I felt the tight grip of anxiousness tickling my every breath. \n\nI didn’t know what I was going to find. If I was lucky, I’d find three cold weather, double-wall, silicone-nylon tents, with their occupants snuggled warmly and safely within. If that was the case, I’d just check on them and turn back to my station, hopefully before the worst of the storm began in earnest. \n\nIf not, well, I’d have to figure that out when it came.\n\n\\*\n\nA half-hour later, I reached the campsite.\n\nOr, at least, what was left of it.\n\nThe remains of what were obviously three high-quality winter tents were positioned compactly around a central firepit, their bright red material shredded and torn and flapping violently in the fierce wind, looking very much like a lunatic array of flags in the heart of a hurricane.\n\nI pulled the ears of my hat lower, adjusting the chinstrap tighter.\n\n“*HELLO?*” I shouted, straining to make my voice carry above the wind. Even with all my force, it still sounded pathetically impotent in the roar of the coming storm. “*IS ANYONE HERE?*”\n\nI waited a long moment, but could hear nothing but the rush of wind and the whip-like snapping of the nylon fabric. \n\nThe campsite had all the hallmarks of a bear attack, except I hadn’t seen a bear in months, and we’d never had a bear attack in this area that I’d ever heard of. It wasn’t like the forests out west – we didn’t have brown bears here. Black bears, yeah, but they were smaller and nowhere near as aggressive as big browns. Sure, they could be dangerous, especially if startled or threatened, but they didn’t actively hunt humans.\n\nI took a few more steps forward into the campsite, drawing the Sig Sauer 10mm and holding it at low-ready as I performed a quick visual of the tents.\n\nNothing.\n\nNo signs of bodies, blood, a struggle, anything at all. Just destroyed tents that could have been abandoned by the campers when the wind started getting bad and the fabric started to fail.\n\nAnd then it caught my eye. A flash of dark gray, partially hidden by the snow between two of the tents. Another ten minutes of snowfall and I’d have never seen it. Moving closer, I toed the frozen bundle of cloth, overturning it before picking it up with my free hand, keeping the Sig at the ready.\n\nIt was a pair of thick winter pants, old and torn and covered in dark red-brown stains that looked too fresh for my comfort. They were fur-lined and looked to be woolen. As soon as I lifted them free of the snow, the wind blew a familiar musky smell into my face, and I dropped them in revulsion.\n\nAnother two feet beyond, the hint of blue in the white drift drew my attention, and I cautiously approached. I recognized the puffy material of a cold-weather jacket, and when I reached out to expose more of it, I staggered backwards in shock, realizing suddenly that I was looking at a crudely dismembered arm, still wrapped snugly in its warm jacket sleeve.\n\nI cursed aloud and stumbled backwards, tripping over the stones surrounding the firepit and falling hard on my ass, eyes wide and not even registering the pain of my tailbone meeting the frozen ground. I sat there, hyperventilating, for what felt like minutes, long enough that the frigid chill was settling into my legs and backside from where I sat dumbly in the snow, eyes wide and breath ragged. It was only when my arms began to shake that I realized I was gripping the handgun as tightly as I could, aimed insanely at the gray mass of frozen trousers on the ground before me as if they were going to suddenly spring to life and attack.\n\n“*Shit!*” was all I could think to say as rationality suddenly returned, clearing the pulsating red spots from my vision and slamming my thoughts back to the present jarringly. The pounding in my ears began to lessen, replaced once again with the unrelenting wail of the wind.\n\nI leapt to my feet and started running back along the trail, back to my station, where Martin and Lucas and Diego and Sophia and the other girl, whose name I couldn’t remember, sheltered from the coming storm with…\n\n…with *what*? Was he some sort of psycho serial killer, stalking the lonely hiking trails of upstate New York? That didn’t make any sense. I’d been here for three years and never heard of anything like this. \n\nAs I ran clumsily through the snow, which was now halfway up my shin, I thought back to those gray pants, discarded in the campsite. They had been shredded, not just torn and ripped from age and wear. It had been something violent that caused the damage, and the blood stains seemed to lend credence to that theory. So, whatever had happened, the stranger had decided to replace his damaged and stained pants with what, those of his victims?\n\nAnd then I thought about how none of his clothes matched, and how his boots and gloves weren’t even suitable for winter weather. \n\nHow long had this been going on?\n\nTwenty minutes later, the dim yellow lights from the windows of my station appeared suddenly from the nearly white-out conditions that had overtaken me with the full coming of the storm. The temperature had dropped even more and I was amazed that I had been able to keep up my pace long enough to make it back, driven by adrenaline and fear.\n\nI slowed to a halt before my ranger station, noticing immediately how the front door hung open a few inches. \n\nMy mind urged me forward, to go racing in, but I had to take a few moments to catch my breath and let my racing heart slow a bit before I entered. I couldn’t understand why the door was only open a few finger widths; if it hadn’t been locked, the first strong gust of wind would have blown it fully open and sent it banging against the wood paneling of the wall behind it.\n\nBut what occupied my thoughts far more was the *implication* of that open door. There’s no way it could have been missed by anyone within, and nobody in their right mind would have sat in the station while the freezing wind and snow blew in through the open doorway.\n\nI pushed that though aside and crept as quietly as possible to the door, pushing it gently at first, then with greater force as I felt some resistance holding it closed. I gripped my sidearm tightly, muzzle directly forward and at chest level, finger resting along the frame of the pistol and ready to drop to the trigger and go to work in a moment’s notice.\n\nThe door gradually gave way and pushed inward far enough that I was able to slide through the gap, the howling of the wind and the protesting of the building blessedly providing enough cacophony to cover the sounds of my entrance. \n\nAs soon as I stepped inside, I found myself in the center of a fever-nightmare. \n\nA body lay behind the door and had served as an impromptu barricade. I could only tell that it was one of the women by the delicate shape of the body, as the head and upper torso had been savagely mutilated, the skin and scalp torn away from the red-white of the skull viciously, presumably while she had desperately tried to make her escape from whatever hell had pursued her.\n\nBlood slicked nearly every surface around me, hot and stinking of copper, and I became aware of a wet, tearing sound emanating from the bunk room. The lights in that room were flickering chaotically, the hanging bulb in the center of the room swinging maniacally, as if it had been recently struck and was still settling its pendulum motion. \n\nAs quietly as I could, I ducked around the doorway into the room, fresh shock coursing through my body in a cold wash that threatened my consciousness. \n\nBodies and *pieces* of bodies lay strewn about the room haphazardly, most still enshrouded in bits of clothing, now tacked in place by sticky crimson. I could *feel* the heat in the room from whatever horrifying act of violence had occurred, from the bodies that now lay scattered about like discarded playthings.\n\nAt my feet, I noted a handful of empty shotgun shells, where they had fallen and been arrested by the viscous gore that painted the wooden floorboards. The shotgun lay nearby, chamber open and magazine tube empty, only inches away from the barely recognizable remains of the man I’d known as Martin. Terrible slashes and wounds covered his ravaged corpse, looking as if he’d been thrown into a shredder. His limbs were outstretched and only attached by the yellowish tendons and pink muscles which now lay open and exposed.\n\nMy eyes were drawn at that moment to the source of the sounds I’d heard before, and I saw the crouched form of the stranger straddling one of the bodies – Lucas, I think, by the bright yellow of his North Face jacket. I watched in horror as the stranger dipped his head again and again, jerking it savagely each time it came away, as if tearing away more bits of meat with each movement. \n\nI noticed then that the stranger’s hands had somehow grown, elongated, and taken on a shiny chitinous appearance that left the fingers as jagged and gore-encrusted claws.\n\nAfter only a moment’s shocked hesitation, my reflexes took over and I snapped the muzzle of my handgun up and squeezed the trigger. I know that the thunderous blasts of the 10mm must have been deafening, but I barely registered it as I watched blackened holes appear in the thing’s back.\n\nIt threw its head back in what I can only hope was pain and cried out in a shrieking screech that drowned out all else. I squeezed the trigger again, and another bullet punched its way through the horrifying thing.\n\nSuddenly, almost faster than I could track, the stranger exploded up from where it had been feasting and lit upon the wall, its terrible claws sinking into the wood and holding it in place as it turned its head 180 degrees to face me. The eyes had turned completely black and grown to the size of golf balls, and the jaw looked almost to have disjointed from its skull, the skin at the corners of its mouth drawn back in a hideous grin that stretched nearly from ear to ear, exposing a mouth full of shark-like triangular teeth, now stained bright red.\n\nIt tensed, and an instant later it had leapt to the next wall, gripping the exposed wood like some monstrous insect, eyes fixed upon me. Before it could make another move, I fired again and again and again, my panic-induced attack miraculously finding purchase more often than not as empty brass cases ejected against the doorframe next to me, ringing out like death bells.\n\nThen there was a long moment of silent stillness in the room, and its black eyes were fixed on me, still unnervingly cold and alien. I tensed, waiting for the thing to pounce towards me, but it was clear I’d hurt it. I don’t know how badly, but black ichor dripped from the half-dozen wounds punched by my hollow-points and I thought I heard a sickly rattling in its slow, deep breaths. With a final ear-splitting, otherworldly shriek, it leapt again, this time away from me and through the window at the rear of the room. \n\nThe glass shattered outward, and then it was over. \n\nI stood alone in this charnel house, left only with the remains of the four Spanish tourists and the disconcerting awareness that the slide of my handgun was locked back, smoke lazily drifting from the barrel and the magazine now empty.\n\n\\*\n\nThat was almost a year ago, and I’ve since transferred from field operations to an administrative position within the parks service. My office is located in the middle of a city, surrounded by people and without a lonely forest or dark wilderness in sight. After the investigation died down and the deaths were ruled as “animal predation”, I tried to return to my posting, but I just couldn’t do it. They tore down the old station and built a new one closer to the trailhead, and I thought I could get past it, but I kept seeing that stranger – that *creature* – every time I close my eyes. A few times in the dark stillness of the night, I thought I could hear that banshee wail echoing in the distance.\n\nOnce or twice, I think I heard more than one. \n\nI slept with my handgun on the nightstand and the shotgun propped next to my bed, and kept the doors locked at all times. I couldn’t shake the feeling that it was still out there. \n\nMaybe searching for me. \n\nMaybe it needed to make sure that I wasn’t able to tell anyone about it.\n\nYou see, in the time since that horrible night, I’ve scoured the internet for any possible explanation for what I saw. I consulted any self-proclaimed cryptozoologist or paranormal investigator that would speak to me, but nobody had any rational explanations beyond fairytales and urban legends, and invariably I was left with as many questions as I started with.\n\nAnd then I tripped across an article one day that changed everything for me.\n\nIt was a piece written about something called the *Uncanny Valley*, an idea put forth by some Japanese roboticist back in the 70’s. At first, I almost passed it over, since it seemed mostly to relate to robots and computer graphics and how people feel increasingly uncomfortable the more realistically human they appear.\n\nBut then I read a theory about why people may react this way and how it may be an evolutionary artifact left over in the dark corners of our reptilian brains. About how, at some point in our distant shared racial history, there may have actually been predators that looked *almost* human. They may have appeared so close to our ancestors that they were able to blend in with us almost perfectly. According to the theory, primitive humans may have developed a keen sense of facial recognition as a survival mechanism. This may have been passed down through genetic memories, fading just a little with each generation until today, where it existed as little more than an instinctive warning when we looked at someone who wasn’t quite right. Someone who seemed *almost* normal, but perhaps with the slightest of imperfections that made them seem just a little wrong. Someone that our instincts told us didn’t belong – someone who wasn’t really one of us at all.\n\nI wondered if these things have been with us all along, hiding among us, stalking us from within our own numbers.\n\nYesterday, on my commute to the office, I noticed a young woman sitting by herself in the back of the subway car. Even though it was crowded, the seats beside her were empty and I noticed that the other commuters almost seemed to be avoiding getting too close to her. I don’t think anyone really realized it, but people kept glancing uneasily at her out of the corners of their eyes. There was nothing overtly out of place with her, and it could have just been happenstance that nobody had elected to sit down next to her.\n\nI just couldn’t shake the feeling, though, that something just felt…*off*. \n\n [\\&gt;...&lt;](https://www.youtube.com/@dark_night_tales)",

        "text": "Okay, so this is what happened. I am going to try and tell it as it happened, but I am still shaking.\n\nI had to take care of friends of mine’s dogs while they went away for the weekend. Sounds like there is a bit of trouble in the marriage, so they were going to sort it out. All good. I love their dogs, so I had no problem with it. \n\nI spent most of my time watching old movies. The dogs slept next to me on the couch, I had snacks and the pizza place close by is not too bad. \n\nSo just before I went to bed on Saturday evening, I let the dogs out in the backyard while I had my last smoke. The dogs were sniffing and exploring, I sat in a lawn chair.\n\nNext moment I heard this blood curling scream. The hairs on the back of my neck stood erect, I immediately felt the adrenaline rush, starting to shake, ready to run or fight. The dogs stopped whatever they were doing and were watching the house next door, so I didn’t imagine it. \n\nI listened but there was nothing. All quiet. \n\nI had of those moments where I know what I should do, but don’t want to, yet started to do it. I walked around the house to the house next door. I argued with myself. What if there was someone needed help? What if I walk into a situation, husband killing the wife type of deal? What would I be able to do?\n\nI hesitated when I reached the front door, but then gave a loud knock. \n\nI was ready to knock again when I heard someone unlocking the door. The door opened and guy was standing there with a shocked expression on his face, maybe something else. Definitely not ready to greet me in a warm manner, is what I am trying to say.\n\n“I heard someone scream, everything okay here?” I asked, perhaps a bit more aggressively than intended. \n\n“Listen, you need to go. Go now.” Something was going on here, the man is very suspicious. Smaller than me, around his forties, thinning brown hair and a round flushed face, potbelly. I felt confident I will be able to win a fight if it comes to that.\n\n“Who screamed? What's going on?” I asked taking a step into the house.\n\nThe guy was acting very suspicious; I could see he did not want me in the house. “No, please, go. You must go.”\n\n“My dude…”, I started and then heard a gasp. Looking up the staircase, I just saw what looked like a woman, girl perhaps, disappearing around the corner. \n\n“What the f… is going on here?” I yelled and pushed myself into the house. \n\n“No, no no!” The fat guy yelled but he didn’t try and stop me. A good thing too, I would have popped him on the nose if he tried. \n\nI rushed up the stairs and around the corner in the direction I saw the girl disappeared. It was a hallway, three doors, two closed, one open. I pushed open the door and then stopped. \n\nInside the room were two girls. I guess early twenties, they looked young. One a blond, the other a brunette. They were wearing shorts and small tops, like sleeping wear, the brunette still pulling her top down. Both looked scared. \n\n“What the hell?” I took a step back so I could see down the staircase. The guy was no longer there. ‘Oh bugger”, I thought. I looked at the girls, who looked scared out of their minds. “I am so sorry” I said.\n\nI quickly closed the door to the girls’ room and stood in front of it, guarding it. I phone the emergency services, explaining to the operator the situation and asked for help. She asked me to stay on the line while she sends people my way. \n\nI kept an eye out, in case the guy was going to try something, half hoping he would, half hoping he wouldn’t. After what felt like forever I heard a car arrive and saw the blue and red lights reflecting from the window.\n\nThe operator told me the first response unit arrived and I should call out to them. I called out and they told me to show myself, I came down the staircase with my hands in the air, don’t laugh, I didn’t know what to do. I explained the situation, they told me to wait outside. A second patrol car arrived and one of the officers waited with me. I smoked, and smoked some more.\n\nIt quickly turned into the normal scene you see on TV where there are police cars, radios squawking, an ambulance and lights flickering, turning everything into shades of red and blue. Neighbours were standing in small groups chatting. I knew nobody, so I stayed at the police car. An officer took my details and a brief report. Then I waited some more.\n\nEventually someone in uniform approach me, asked me about the situation. I explained, the scream, my entry in the house, the guy and the girls. He gave me an odd look and went to speak some other guy in civilian clothes. Soon the other guy asked me the same; I told my story. He too gave me a look, starting to make me nervous. Did something happen in there? Do they suspect I had anything to do with it? My fears grew bigger when a coroner van arrived. \n\nOne of the ambulance people came over and asked if she could take my stats. She asked if I was using medication. If I used any drugs, explaining she is not with the police, but need to know. I said no and no to the drugs. Eventually I was asked to wait at home. \n\nIt took a really long time before people came to the house. They identified themselves as two detectives; two older men were standing at the back, not saying anything. They asked me to repeat my story.\n\n“I’m housesitting the dogs. So I heard a scream from next door. I went to see what’s going on, right? A guy opened the door…”\n\n“Describe the guy.” the detective asked. \n\nI gave the description. The two detectives looked at each other. “And then?”\n\nI explained about seeing the girl, going up there finding them in the room, guarding the door, calling the cops.\n\nThe detectives kept on looking at each other; I was starting to get a bad feeling about this. They asked about the guy again. I told the same thing I’ve been doing the whole night. \n\n“Is this the guy?” one of the older guys in the back asked and showed me a picture. It was the same guy, a bit younger, but without a doubt the same guy. \n\n“Yes, he opened the door. Later I didn’t see him again.”\n\nThe older guy spoke again, “The guy is dead.”\n\nMy whole word felt like it was crashing around me. Dead? Do they think I killed him? \n\n“He’s been dead for at least a week now.”\n\nI did a double taker. ‘Wait, what?’ \n\n“But he opened the door?” I tried to make sense but nothing came to my mind. \n\n“His body is in one of the rooms in a plastic bag.” I didn’t know what to say.\n\n“The girls said you opened the door and locked them in the room while calling us.” said the detective. I could only stare at him.\n\n“We’ve been after these two for some time now. They make friends with some lonely guy, move in, take all his money then kill him. They live in the house for a while, selling everything they can, then move out to find the next target. Lots of sad men out there. But you caught them. You caught them sleeping when you went into the house, keeping them in the room, they didn’t had time to escape. You probably saved a lot of lives.”\n\nWhat could I say. My mind, usually thinking ahead,  was blank. \n\n“We’ll take your statement tomorrow. Get some sleep. Best not to mention a dead guy at the door again though.”\n\nThey all left an hour ago. The sun is coming up. \n\nI have no idea what happened, what is going on.",

        "text": " \"Hey kid, wake up!\"\n\n\n I wake up groggy from the loud voice and start to rub my eyes. I look around and see 6 people in front of me. I also notice that I wasn't in my bedroom. \n\n\n \"There he is awake.\" One of the people say out loud. He looked like a bald gruff man. The one that you knew was way into sports and would fight if his favorite team lost. \n\n\n \"Calm down Gerald you'll scare him.\" This was a woman's voice. I look to my left and saw that she looked very pretty. Had a purple like suit and blonde hair. \n\n\n \"He will be once he knows the situation he's in\". Says Gerald as he lets out a huff. \n\n\n I then hear the sound of a lighter being flicked open and shut. In the front of this new room sits another man on the right corner that looks like one of them teenage punks in them 80's movies. \n\n\n \"Sam stop that!\" The purple lady yells at him making me jump. \n\n\nThe boy then flicks his lighter shut and says,\"now your the one scaring him Laura\". Laura so that's what her name is. She then again looks at me me a kind worried expression. \n\n\n \"Don't worry about him, he is just troubled. Now do you know where you are?\" \n\n\n Now that I got a chance to look at my surroundings I realized that I am in some little kids room. Stars painted on a night sky background. If I was younger I probably would have liked this room. I was always into counting all the stars outside with my dad at night. \n\n\n Then one of the other people by the wall gets up and whispers into Laura's ear. Laura then shakes her head and looks back at me. \"She is going to come in again. When she does make no mention of us ok?\" \n\n\n I nod my head but still confused on the situation I'm in. I then hear the rustling of the doorknob as the door slowly creaks open. A woman who obviously hasn't taken care of herself walks in the room. She looked decent but not enough to make me feel comfortable around her. \n\n\n I crawl to the back of the bed. She then looks around and I notice that all the people that were talking weren't there anymore. My heart started beating as she comes closer to the bed. The smell of bad perfume coming off her as her face was by mine. \n\n\n She makes a smile that lets me see some of her bad rotting teeth. The mixture of her breath and perfume makes me want to puke on the bed. I didn't because I didn't know if that will make her angry. \n\n\n \"Why hello there Travis\". The woman says to me. Which made me freak out that she knew my name. \"Are you having fun in mommy's house?\" That made my heart start to beat more as I already have a mom. I shake my head at her still terrified to speak. \n\n\n She didn't seem to like it though as she got angry and started banging her fist on the wall and started screaming.\n\n\n After a couple of minutes she stopped. She then looks back at me with another rotting grin. \"It's ok Travis I know you ain't seen mommy in a while and that you need to get used to me. You will though because your going to be mommy's boy forever!\" \n\n\n She then gave me a hug as I tried to pull back. \"You ain't my mom.\" I say back to her. She then gives me this creepy smile and says,\" Oh I am sweety, you will know for sure once I get daddy on the phone\". \n\n\n She doesn't know dad's number. You can tell it in her voice. How does she know you though? Was she a stalker? You then look around the room again. That starry sky wallpaper with various children's toys and a desk with a lamp by the bed. \n\n\n \"Don't forget us\". \n\n\n You jump as you look to your left at Laura. She smiles and puts her hand on your shoulders. \"Don't worry Travis. We are going to protect you\". The flick of the lighter makes me jump again as Sam still flicks it open and shut.\n\n\n \"Hey Laura what's the plan?\" One of the 3 people by the right wall. Gerald is on the left with Sam on the corner. \"Calm down Mark when we see an opening we will take it\". Mark looks like one of those bodyguards you see protecting rich people. \n\n\n He nods his head at her and leans back against the wall. \"Who are you people?\".\n\n\n They all then looked at me with solemn expressions. They were acting so serious my heart felt like it was about to stop. Then Laura coughed a couple of times and said to me,\" we are your guardians Travis, we protect you from bad things which is why you are here now\". \n\n\n Being only 12 at the time I essentially thought that I was going crazy. \"How come she can't see you then?\" \n\n\n \"That's because she is evil,\" Mark says. \"Evil people cannot see guardians,\" Gerald also says. \"We only live and serve to protect you Travis,\" Sam says while looking at me still flicking the lighter. The other two were only shadow like. \"Those are enforcers. They help fight off the evil\". Laura tells me. \n\n\n \"How did I get into this situation?\" I asked. \n\n\n  \"We don't know. All we know is that we were called here. Gathered to be the correct term.\" \n\n\n Still confused I just went along with it. \"So what is the plan?\" \n\n\n Laura then smiles at me. \"Next time she comes in here you are going to stall her while the enforcers jump her. Can you be brave for that?\" \n\n\n I nod my head yes. Fortunately at that time the doorknob started to move. The woman then walks into the bedroom and gives me that creepy smile. \n\n\n \"Seems like I forgot daddy's phone number. Do you remember what it is?\" I knew it. She didn't know dads number at all! I look around again but the only people in the room was me and the woman. \n\n\n \"You must know your own father's number Travis\". I gulped some courage in and said to her, \"Stop calling me Travis, you ain't my mom and I want to go home!\" \n\n\n She stepped back when I yelled and at that time the two shadowy enforcers went around her. I didn't even see them show up they were just there. They coveted her in their shadowy form and as they did the woman's eyes widened. \"What are you!\" She yelled as she finally saw them as she started convulsing. \n\n\n The others then appeared as blood seemed to run down her eyes and mouth. Laura held her hand back to cover my eyes but I could still see through them. The woman suddenly screamed, \"Travis help me!\" That look in her eyes and the fear in her voice made me close my eyes until I heard a thump in the floor. \n\n\n I opened my eyes again to see her limp body sprawled out on the floor. The blood still going down her face as there is now a puddle. \n\n\n I then start to cry as now I didn't know what to do. Then for some reason they all hugged me. \"It's ok now Travis, just go back to sleep and you will feel better\". I then get laid back down on the bed as I hear Mark, Gerald, Sam, and Laura say \"don't forget us!\" As I closed my eyes into a deep sleep. \n\n\n *********************************************** \n\n\n It has now been a couple of days since I had that nightmare. I am now 21. I go to the creative writing courses at my college. After I had that nightmare I called my dad asking if anything traumatic happened to me as a kid. \n\n\n He said he recalled when he was late picking me up from school a woman grabbed me while I was asleep on the bench and took me to her house. She was planning on using me for ransom money since my family was in the middle high range. \n\n\n Once the cops traced her car through CCTV footage they busted in. They found me laying still asleep in a makeshift bedroom. That's where they also found her dead on the floor. He also said that they fount traces of opiods in her system that made it seem she overdosed. \n\n\n After he told me that he said that I went through a couple of years of therapy and just simply forgot the whole incident. He then caringly asked me how on earth I remembered and I just simply told him I had a nightmare. \n\n\n I am on my way to see dad now. The fact that no one else saw these \"guardians\" makes me think they were just in my head. \n\n\n If that was true then why am I on here right? \n\n\n I am on here because I am walking towards the bus stop that takes me to my parents place and I am hearing a quiet flicker of a lighter.\n\n\n I just hope nothing happens.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n ",

        "text": " \nA forest existed in between two towns in a village in uttar pradesh(present), India. One day on occasion of makar sankranti a man had to travel to another town to his mother too celebrate the festival the next day. It was around sunset, his wife warned him not to cross the forest, as it was night time, ignorant as he was he left the house laughing at his wife, she tried to stop him but in vain. The man entered the forest, on an average it took a person 4.5 hours to cross the forest if he was on a bicycle, although being ignorant, he still took the bicycle, say intuition. He was 2 hours into the forest, it was 8.15 pm, owls were hooting, cicadas were buzzing and wolves were howling, not to mention the mosquito bites, it started to irritate and obviously scare him. He began increasing his pace. It was a full moon that night, the moon lit the forest, but made it look gloomy, straight outta a horror flick. The man started to chant mantras for protection from evil entities, which he unconsciously thought were lurking around. He soon heard a soft cry of fear coming from a nearby tree, upon following the sound ,which he did, he saw a kid crouched wearing school uniform of the local school, he approached him, and the kid told him he had lost his way, and his town was on the other side. The man, although ignorant, was humane, so he offered help to kid, as he was heading towards the same town, he gave the kid a ride. It was 9.30 pm, an hour of journey was left, 15 minutes later, the man felt a sudden jerk, as if something was stuck in the rear wheel, the kid began to cry, when he looked back, the kid's feet were getting stuck in the wheel. So, he stopped his cycle and helped the kid who was crying in pain as his feet were bleeding and aching by tying piece of cloth around his wounds and told him to hold on and placing his feet in crossed position over the seat so that they may not get stuck again. He began his journey, worried already about the circumstances and the night. Soon, their was a massive jerk, the man almost tipped over, and the kid began to cry loudly in pain, and this time, it was really loud, which scared the shit out of him. He looked back...at this point it was 10.15 pm...the town was visible, but still a little far away, the fear engulfed him as he saw the other worldy being, he dropped his cycle, ran in horror towards the town, clicking noises and footsteps followed him, but he didn't look back. He somehow managed to get across the forest, eventually the footsteps faded, but the clicking noises rang his eardrum like hell.He reached his mother's house and overnight caught high fever, he told his mother the events that he had witnessed and kept complaining about the clicking. In the morning, around sunset, he died, his eye balls were covered with tiny holes in honeycomb structure, ears were bleeding, and his tongue was missing. To this day, the folklore is passed down, and still nobody crosses the village after sunset.\n\n\n\nThis is a true story. If anybody knows details about the villages please let me know on the comments.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/118bd61/i_swallowed_my_pride_and_took_a_1450_an_hour/",
        "text": "  \n\n“*Hello there*, tall dark and handsome,” the world’s oldest woman said, batting her cataract-clouded eyes. “What brings a hunk like you to our humble little nursing home?”\n\n“Uh…well…” I stammered. It was the first hour of my first day on the job and I didn’t quite know how to respond. I’d felt off-kilter since I was frisked and wanded before being allowed into the facility. Security here was air-tight. All employees were thoroughly searched. No visitors were allowed, as far as I knew. It was more like a CIA station than a nursing home. But I, unfortunately, needed the $14.50 an hour, so-- \n\nJamie, my supervisor, saved me the trouble of devising an answer. “You really don’t have to. Victoria asks that of all the new male staff,” she said, ushering me towards her office at the end of the Clorox-scented hall. “Don’t you, Victoria?”\n\n“Just the select few capable of satisfying my female needs,” Victoria responded, stroking—slowly, insinuatingly—the aluminum handles of her walker. \n\nShifting uneasily in my purple caregiver uniform, I gave her a quick once-over. Victoria wore a black, diaphanous nightgown, red lipstick that ventured well beyond the lips, rouged cheeks and a saucy black beret angled provocatively over her milky right eye.\n\nVictoria lost, then regained her balance. She was wan, no more than eighty-five pounds, with thinning white hair. Winded from the struggle to remain upright, she added, pausing frequently, “I have a good eye for men. And—and—you, sir, are the type that keeps me alive. So, before you go, I have an itty-bitty favor to ask.”\n\n“And what would that be?” I asked, plastering on a smile, indulging her.\n\n“A teeny tiny kiss. A peck on the cheek.” She giggled.\n\nI turned to Jamie for approval. Personally, I saw no harm in giving Victoria what she wanted. I thoroughly enjoyed old people—the fascinating stories they told, the life lessons they taught me. It was one of the reasons I’d chosen to work in a nursing home. If brushing my lips against Victoria’s rouged cheeks was elder abuse, the laws needed to be changed. But I didn’t want to get fired on my first day. \n\nApparently feeling the same as me, Jamie nodded her assent. “Might do her some good. Always worked magic when your predecessor did the same thing.” She turned to Victoria. “But no more of your dirty tricks, young lady, and you know what I mean. *One peck*.”\n\n“Dirty tricks? Who me?” Victoria asked, widening her eyes coquettishly, dislodging an enormous fake lash. She offered me her right cheek.\n\nI stepped forward, wondering if this was such a good idea after all. The scent of her rouge, her perfume, was overwhelming. Her round face, as it loomed ever closer, was like a powdered, quivering moon. My stomach revolted. The face of a young woman enthralled me. But Victoria’s? With all due respect to mature females, Victoria was one-hundred-twenty-seven years old, a human dinosaur whose bones might inspire lust in an archaeologist, not a young, single male. \n\nNevertheless, I persisted, pursing my lips, leaning forward into the pecking zone. Serving the clients was my duty, Jamie had, during orientation, reminded me again and again. I was only doing my job.\n\nClamping my eyes shut, I dove in, only to have my lips smothered and a tongue thrust into my mouth, searching, probing, obscenely. Mucous-like spittle clogged my throat. I gagged, but didn’t dare part, for fear of offending Victoria, breaking her desperately lonely heart. She was failing badly. This might be her last kiss. With that in mind, I returned the favor, French kissing her deeply, opening my mouth in full surrender to her dying charms.\n\nTime ceased to exist. Victoria and I went on and on, clutching each other greedily, fusing our mouths. \n\nOh, my god. She was turning me on! And in full view of Jamie and assorted rubberneckers gathering in the hall. Regaining my senses, I did what any other red-blooded young man in my position would do: I vomited in my mouth. Victoria tongued the bile, swallowing it, drinking me in. \n\nGasping, I pushed us apart. Victoria smiled triumphantly. Her mouth was a gaping black hole. My thrusting tongue had dislodged her false teeth. She cupped the dripping plate high in her right hand.\n\n“I’m sorry,” I apologized to Jamie. “Guess I should turn in my uniform, hey?” \n\n“No harm done, as far I can see,” Jamie replied, surprisingly. I’d already started unbuttoning my company-provided purple smock. “Victoria’s happy. You seemed pretty happy, too. Make that *very happy.”*\n\n“Get a room!” an onlooker joked.\n\nJamie shooed him away. “Seriously,” she said to me, “what you just showed me was an admirable commitment to the patient population. A strong work ethic. You’ll do anything for a client. I like that!” She turned to Victoria. “Now put your teeth back in and go to your room.  The evening meal will be served in an hour. Scurry!”\n\nVictoria shuffled off silently. But not before giving me a wink and a sly grin. \n\nI stifled my own surprising smile. My heart skipped a beat when she closed her door. I felt like smashing it down and covering Victoria with hungry kisses. What the f\\*\\*\\*k was going on with me? First night jitters? Get a grip, dude! I buttoned and smoothed my smock. \n\nJamie appeared unfazed. But then, she was a nursing home veteran. She’d seen and heard all manner of weird things.   \n\nPulling me with her, Jamie skittered into her office and closed the door. “Sorry about back there,” she said, rolling her eyes. “Don’t want to turn you off before your first shift at Eternity Nursing Home and Hospice Care even begins.” \n\nTwenty feet away, Victoria had cracked open her door. She was watching us—or more specifically me—her face an ancient masque of lust. Her teeth were back in, though a tad loose. Bile rose in my throat. I sensed that, if she kept staring, I’d vomit again. This time in full view, pouring onto Jamie’s desk, her lap.  Me, the twenty-year-old super fit guy with an iron stomach.\n\n“Help me close the blinds, would you?” Jamie asked, dropping them with a clatter over her glass door. “Victoria can’t hear well. But there are times I feel she’s reading lips.”\n\nWith the blinds down, Jamie’s office fell into a disorienting twilight. Nevertheless, with Victoria out of sight, my stomach settled down. And, thank goodness, my libido returned to baseline.\n\n“Even with the cataracts?”\n\n“Believe or not, those come and go. The ophthalmologist can’t explain it, other than to say that Victoria’s a one-off. Unique. Most of her other medical people are scratching their heads, too. She’ll get worse for a while, seemingly at death’s door. And then her health will improve—dramatically—just like that.” Jamie clapped her hands sharply. \n\nI jumped. Jamie, I was increasingly aware, was a little off, too.\n\nShe continued, “One doctor proclaimed that, when Victoria was in an up phase, she was a like a healthy forty-five-year-old in the body of a hundred and twenty-seven-year-old. That was just before the last male caregiver quit or disappeared or whatever, opening up the position you now occupy.”\n\n“One-twenty-seven? For real?”\n\n“Best as we can tell. She was born prematurely in a remote Romanian village. Appallingly, Victoria’s mother was alone at the time, peeling the household’s few remaining turnips for that night’s watery soup. Her husband, and all healthy men of working age, had apparently run off, humiliated that the entire root vegetable crop had failed. Cabbage, radishes, rutabagas—the whole lot. To them, that was an insult to their masculinity, their role as providers. Which left only women, children and a few elderly, near-worthless men. \n\n“What records there were of Victoria’s birth disappeared when the village was burned to the ground. Some claim it was arson committed by the humiliated men. At any rate, it was at that point that all women and children fled, too.\n\n“Years after migrating to Bucharest, Victoria’s mother obtained a signed statement from a former village matriarch verifying that Victoria had been born in 1898. And that’s what she brought along when she and her daughter traveled by merchant ship to the United States.” \n\nJamie shrugged. “It became Victoria’s de facto birth certificate that she carried with her everywhere. Ten years ago, when her health started failing and she moved in with us, our former communications director used it to dub her the oldest woman in the world. The media picked up on it and the title stuck.” She adopted a mischievous grin. “And get this. No one outside these walls knows, but I can tell you now that you’re part of the team. I’m distantly related to Victoria.”\n\n“How fascinating,” I lied, immersed in the memory of Victoria’s brain-melting kiss.\n\nSeeming to sense my disinterest, Jamie replied, “Yeah, we trace our lineage back to the same Romanian village or something.” She slid behind her gray metal desk. Well, enough of Lady V for now. Let me fill you in on your duties.” \n\nI leaned back on my wobbly steel chair and listened. I’d been hired as the new Overnight Caregiver, a solo position that would involve dispensing medications (rarely), changing bedpans and, most of all, sweeping and mopping. In other words, glorified janitorial work. Having walked through the facility after an initial orientation, I figured I could get everything done in under two hours. After which I’d have six hours to do homework (social sciences undergrad) or play online video games. I was a loner and didn’t have friends.\n\nThere were only fifteen residents, not including those in the hospice wing, which was locked and off-limits to me and all nursing home staff. A CCTV camera hovered over the chained double doors, in continuous scanning mode, which seemed a tad excessive, given that the nursing home residents knew that all who entered soon died. \n\nA short while later, Jamie was gone. The facility’s lights had been dimmed. I was the only employee left. Even the cook had clocked out, leaving a food service cart for me to wheel around to the residents’ rooms. After serving them dinner, I’d collect their plates and they’d all go to sleep. Their TVs still blaring, of course.\n\nI gave the food cart a shove. Shit! My knee went out! Man, it hurt! \n\nMaybe I’d twisted it playing pick-up b-ball the night before, one of the rare times I got out and mixed. Limping around, swearing, I spied a resident’s forgotten cane. Hobbling over, I snatched it up. Pretty stylish, I thought, except for the pronged base. I gave it a test run to the staff break room, the cane taking just enough weight off my throbbing knee. \n\nBreathing easier, I eyed myself in a mirror. The cane was looking pretty natty. But the harsh lights made it seem like I was developing premature crow’s feet. I turned the lights down. The crow’s feet disappeared.  \n\nBut food service was running late. The residents would complain to Jamie and it would be bye, bye job. I gathered up the food cart, bent on doing the right thing. \n\nAnd then—and then—gripped by irresistible yearning, I limped past one room and then another, the cart rattling over the tiles. I needed to feed Victoria, apologize, and, more than anything, kiss her again. That feisty lass had stripped me off all reason, made me heedless like never before. So much so that I snagged the stainless steel cart with my orthopedic cane. It teetered, then fell, instant oatmeal, orange sherbet and Salisbury steak, spilling on the floor. \n\nWho cared!\n\nI turned one last corner, limping towards Victoria—and—thank god—there she was, leaning languidly against her door in a snug cashmere sweater tied at her slim waist—looking twenty years younger, which made her 109 and me sick again. Rushing forward, I vomited into her yearning mouth, overjoyed that something magnificent had started that could not be stopped.\n\nWe locked lips for ten heavenly minutes, her nimble tongue exploring my every molar and gum. Her thick saliva was like nectar to me. I swallowed it greedily, aching for more, more.\n\nA cacophony of heavy explosions filled the air.\n\n“What’s that?” Victoria, breaking away, exclaimed. \n\nCaught in flagrante delicto, I panicked, fantasizing that a SWAT team—the FBI—was charging down the hall, flinging shock grenades, eager to arrest me for the allegedly deplorable crime of necking with a woman 107 years my senior. \n\nMore deafening explosions, then a swell of music, and I recognized the sounds as the opening scenes of the Vietnam War movie, *Apocalypse Now*, blasting from the unattended TV in a snoring resident’s room. \n\n“Better finish your dinner rounds before the natives get restless,” Victoria advised. She was suddenly cold, despite our recently completed mouth-to-mouth exchange of bodily fluids.\n\n“Whatever m’lady desires,” I said, bowing in an exaggeratedly courtly manner, kissing her spotted hand. Unsmiling, she shook me off and shut her door with unexpected force.\n\nI returned to the staff room, my mind a riot of passion and guilt. Grabbing a mop and pail I doubled back to the hall, where I picked the Salisbury steaks off the floor, mopped them, and then covered the lot with a fresh can of cold turkey gravy. To hell with the other residents. I only cared, deeply cared, about one; the sultry filly who was driving me clear out of my mind.\n\nUnder Victoria’s erotic spell, I found it hard to calm down. My good knee shook, my bad knee was still tender and store. Back in the staff room, I locked and bolted the door. As an extra measure, I blocked it with a pair of filing cabinets.\n\nI needed to think. I wasn’t much of a lady’s man. I’d “made out” with five girls and struck gold with one, though I’d been so drunk, I didn’t know it until she’d showed me the evidence on her phone. \n\nYet my shyness had melted away the moment I first saw lovely Victoria. From that moment on, I craved her kiss. Nothing, not even *ten* SWAT teams could keep from the exquisite pleasure of her cracked, dry lips.\n\nContemplating Victoria, my hands shook. To settle my nerves, I watched a video of former British PM Theresa May, who had a voice and manner that, without fail, lulled me to sleep…\n\nI awoke with a start, pulling a muscle in my lower back. I’d napped for minutes, but it seemed like years. Grabbing my cane, I shuffled over to staff medicine cabinet. On top of everything my stomach was cramping from constipation. I drank a heaping glass of Metamucil, with no results. \n\nI glanced the mirror. Something was dead wrong. My curly black hair was speckled with grey, and the crow’s feet had returned, more numerous and deeper than before. I looked like an anal cavity that had stopped functioning. I took a swing at the glaring overhead lights. My shoulder went out. Damn. More f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*g pain.\n\n*Brrnngg!!!* \n\nAn emergency bell rang. I checked the patient communications panel. The distress call was coming from Victoria’s room!  Tearing the file cabinets away from the staff door, my injured back muscle spasmed and I collapsed on the floor.\n\nGritting my teeth, I tried and failed to rise. I’d fallen down and couldn’t get up—in a retirement home! Laughing ruefully, I crawled outside to a recharging electric mobility scooter, pulled out the plug and dragged myself into the driver’s seat.\n\nI floored the vehicle, shouting at a resident who’d had the temerity to get in my way. Who gave a damn about his petty concerns!\n\nVictoria came to her door wearing a lacy black girdle, red high heels and sequined halter top. She puffed a Gauloises cigarette in an ebony holder. Her body was shockingly trim and fit. \n\n“What are you here for?” she asked, her voice still icy cold. She blew smoke in my face.\n\n“You rang.” \n\n“Oh, that’s right. Silly me,” she said, shaking her head.\n\n“So what is it you want to say to me?” I asked, desperate for encouraging words, like *kiss me, you fool*. \n\n“We’re done,” she replied, admiring her astonishing physique.\n\n“Wh-why? After all we’ve been through? I demand an explanation.”\n\n“I don’t date old men.”\n\n“I’m twenty f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*g years old.”\n\n“Could have fooled me. You can’t walk under your own power. You hair has gone completely gray. Your hands are trembling with early-stage Parkinson’s disease. And, for god’s sake, buy some Depends.”\n\nI looked down. Indeed, my crotch was soaking wet.\n\n“It’s you who’s done this to me. I was perfectly fine until I met you.”\n\n“Oh, such anger you have. And here I thought you adored me.”\n\n“I do. I mean, I need you. I want you. I exist for your kiss. Please, please, just one more and I’ll never ask again.”\n\nVictoria smiling knowingly. “You’re just like all the others. And there have been so, so many.” She shook her head.\n\n“I thought your lips were mine alone.”\n\n“One man has never been enough for me. You come and go. One night and, frankly, I’m done with you.”\n\n“No, no, I’m not like those other men. I’m decent. I’m kind. I’m yours for eternity.”\n\n“You poor, deluded soul. You have so much to learn. And so little time.”\n\n“Then a last kiss. I beg of you,” I cried, clasping my hands. I tried, but couldn’t stand up. \n\nIndulging me, Victoria bent down and plunged her tongue deep into my mouth, deeper than ever before. It was a sympathy kiss, I knew, but the effect on me was the same. I shuddered with excitement. We exchanged vile bodily fluids one last sweet time.\n\nCrestfallen, I turned around the mobility cart and whirred away. Half way down the hall I looked back. Victoria, my Victoria, was already back in her room. \n\nMy chest tightened unexpectedly. Sharp pain shot down my upper left arm. Struggling with the steering wheel, I careened through the partially opened staff room door, coming to a sudden stop against the far wall. Thrown to the floor, it took every ounce of my waning strength for me to boot up the portable heart defibrillator, attach the pads and shock myself out of a massive heart attack. My entire body shuddered. I lost consciousness.  \n\nI awoke with Jamie looming above me, her face a mask of benevolent concern. I was on a gurney in a room lined with row upon row of bedridden elderly men. They moaned and called out:\n\n“Kiss me.”\n\n“More, I want more.” \n\n“Abandon the others, Victoria. Make me the only one.”\n\n“Your arrival has agitated them. But don’t worry,” Jamie admonished me, “They’ll quiet down after the morning sedation.” She shifted a huge load of paperwork from one arm to the other, numerous pages fluttering to the floor. She wore a black babushka and a flowing peasant dress. \n\n“Where are the doctors? The nurses?” I asked, my words muffled by an oxygen mask.\n\n“We have sufficient staff,” Jamie observed. \n\nI turned to see numerous women, also in babushkas and peasant dresses, wiping patient brows, administering morning meds. They exuded professional cheer, laughing and joking with the dilapidated men.\n\n“And it may make you feel better to know that you’re *not* hospitalized. No, you’re still in Eternity Care, the hospice wing. In qualified hands, under specialized care.” Jamie was on her hands and knees, scooping up pages.\n\n“Is that my chart? Hand it to me right now!”\n\nJamie chuckled. “No. These are resumes,” she said, waving one. “We’re hiring again. Overnight male staff.”\n\n“But that’s my job. I need the money.” Speaking through the oxygen mask was like whispering “help” from the bottom of a well.\n\n“Please. You’re in no shape to continue. Nor is he. Or he,” she said, indicating two nearby patients.\n\n“And who the fuck are they?” \n\n“Your predecessors. In work and French kissing.” Sighing, she pulled up a plastic chair. She cradled her hands. Exhaled. “You see, Victoria is a special needs patient.”\n\n“And those special needs are—”\n\n“Men. About one every six weeks. She waxes after receiving your kisses. I once saw her run a six-minute mile the morning after a single night stand. And she had just turned, I believe, one hundred and fifteen. She ages quickly after that, until she reaches the broken-down state in which you first encountered her.”\n\n“Bullshit. Not possible.”\n\n“Not without single, lonely men like you. And your bile.\n\nI tore off the oxygen mask. “Let me the f\\*\\*k out of here you f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*g nutbag.” \n\n“Code white! Aggressive hospice care patient!” Jamie called out and two attendants came running. One of them restrained my arms. The other returned to my face the oxygen mask, sweat and saliva dripping down. My breathing had become labored, so I was actually thankful.\n\n“You’ve proved my point sir,” Jamie continued. “In the process of locking lips, Victoria partakes of the male essence. And returns it to you in neutered form of a thick paste.”\n\n“So what you’re saying is that the essence of man is vomit? Please!”\n\n“More precisely bile. Literally and figuratively.” \n\nA bout of laughing caused me to flat line. The attendants revived me with amyl nitrate, after which Jamie returned.\n\nJamie remained standing this time. She looked at her watch. “Listen, I’ve got to post this help wanted ad. Your position is open and Victoria will begin her precipitous decline again soon. There’s always another loner who wants to work the overnight shift.”\n\n“I’m going to report you to the health authority!”\n\nThis roused the patient next to me, a pathetic creature with a bulbous stomach and toothpick arms. “Me and you both,” he said, before falling again into a comatose state.\n\n“I think you’re better off here,” she said. Turning to the other patients, raising her voice, she proclaimed. “You’re all better off here, receiving the care only we can provide.” Her stern voice carried an implied threat.\n\n“So you’re ready to throw away your reputation for a single one-hundred-twenty-seven-year-old crazy woman?”\n\n“That’s where you’re wrong, sir. Victoria isn’t 127. She’s 238.”\n\n“Sure.”\n\n“Victoria’s my great-grandmother thirteen times over. I told you in my office that we were related. In fact, every female in here is related to her somehow, patients and staffers alike. It’s our home away from home. Victoria has been protecting the women of our village for centuries. She keeps us safe. Aging and regenerating. Aging and regenerating. By surrendering her body to manly bile. Which of course, all women do.”\n\n“So what makes Victoria different?” \n\n“She swallows. And one day all women will adopt her method. That’s why our clan brought her to the United States. The place that spreads freedom around the world. Keeping Victoria alive keeps hope of our own freedom alive.” \n\nWith that, Jamie left. \n\nAs of this writing, she has not come back, allowing me, with my pained, arthritic hands to scribble my tale. \n\nIn tiny cursive on this odorous pair of Depends. That I hope some dumpster diver will retrieve from the facility’s trash and bring to your attention.",

        "text": "  \n\n“*Hello there*, tall dark and handsome,” the world’s oldest woman said, batting her cataract-clouded eyes. “What brings a hunk like you to our humble little nursing home?”\n\n“Uh…well…” I stammered. It was the first hour of my first day on the job and I didn’t quite know how to respond. I’d felt off-kilter since I was frisked and wanded before being allowed into the facility. Security here was air-tight. All employees were thoroughly searched. No visitors were allowed, as far as I knew. It was more like a CIA station than a nursing home. But I, unfortunately, needed the $14.50 an hour, so-- \n\nJamie, my supervisor, saved me the trouble of devising an answer. “You really don’t have to. Victoria asks that of all the new male staff,” she said, ushering me towards her office at the end of the Clorox-scented hall. “Don’t you, Victoria?”\n\n“Just the select few capable of satisfying my female needs,” Victoria responded, stroking—slowly, insinuatingly—the aluminum handles of her walker. \n\nShifting uneasily in my purple caregiver uniform, I gave her a quick once-over. Victoria wore a black, diaphanous nightgown, red lipstick that ventured well beyond the lips, rouged cheeks and a saucy black beret angled provocatively over her milky right eye.\n\nVictoria lost, then regained her balance. She was wan, no more than eighty-five pounds, with thinning white hair. Winded from the struggle to remain upright, she added, pausing frequently, “I have a good eye for men. And—and—you, sir, are the type that keeps me alive. So, before you go, I have an itty-bitty favor to ask.”\n\n“And what would that be?” I asked, plastering on a smile, indulging her.\n\n“A teeny tiny kiss. A peck on the cheek.” She giggled.\n\nI turned to Jamie for approval. Personally, I saw no harm in giving Victoria what she wanted. I thoroughly enjoyed old people—the fascinating stories they told, the life lessons they taught me. It was one of the reasons I’d chosen to work in a nursing home. If brushing my lips against Victoria’s rouged cheeks was elder abuse, the laws needed to be changed. But I didn’t want to get fired on my first day. \n\nApparently feeling the same as me, Jamie nodded her assent. “Might do her some good. Always worked magic when your predecessor did the same thing.” She turned to Victoria. “But no more of your dirty tricks, young lady, and you know what I mean. *One peck*.”\n\n“Dirty tricks? Who me?” Victoria asked, widening her eyes coquettishly, dislodging an enormous fake lash. She offered me her right cheek.\n\nI stepped forward, wondering if this was such a good idea after all. The scent of her rouge, her perfume, was overwhelming. Her round face, as it loomed ever closer, was like a powdered, quivering moon. My stomach revolted. The face of a young woman enthralled me. But Victoria’s? With all due respect to mature females, Victoria was one-hundred-twenty-seven years old, a human dinosaur whose bones might inspire lust in an archaeologist, not a young, single male. \n\nNevertheless, I persisted, pursing my lips, leaning forward into the pecking zone. Serving the clients was my duty, Jamie had, during orientation, reminded me again and again. I was only doing my job.\n\nClamping my eyes shut, I dove in, only to have my lips smothered and a tongue thrust into my mouth, searching, probing, obscenely. Mucous-like spittle clogged my throat. I gagged, but didn’t dare part, for fear of offending Victoria, breaking her desperately lonely heart. She was failing badly. This might be her last kiss. With that in mind, I returned the favor, French kissing her deeply, opening my mouth in full surrender to her dying charms.\n\nTime ceased to exist. Victoria and I went on and on, clutching each other greedily, fusing our mouths. \n\nOh, my god. She was turning me on! And in full view of Jamie and assorted rubberneckers gathering in the hall. Regaining my senses, I did what any other red-blooded young man in my position would do: I vomited in my mouth. Victoria tongued the bile, swallowing it, drinking me in. \n\nGasping, I pushed us apart. Victoria smiled triumphantly. Her mouth was a gaping black hole. My thrusting tongue had dislodged her false teeth. She cupped the dripping plate high in her right hand.\n\n“I’m sorry,” I apologized to Jamie. “Guess I should turn in my uniform, hey?” \n\n“No harm done, as far I can see,” Jamie replied, surprisingly. I’d already started unbuttoning my company-provided purple smock. “Victoria’s happy. You seemed pretty happy, too. Make that *very happy.”*\n\n“Get a room!” an onlooker joked.\n\nJamie shooed him away. “Seriously,” she said to me, “what you just showed me was an admirable commitment to the patient population. A strong work ethic. You’ll do anything for a client. I like that!” She turned to Victoria. “Now put your teeth back in and go to your room.  The evening meal will be served in an hour. Scurry!”\n\nVictoria shuffled off silently. But not before giving me a wink and a sly grin. \n\nI stifled my own surprising smile. My heart skipped a beat when she closed her door.

She was watching us—or more specifically me—her face an ancient masque of lust. Her teeth were back in, though a tad loose. Bile rose in my throat. I sensed that, if she kept staring, I’d vomit again. This time in full view, pouring onto Jamie’s desk, her lap.

I swallowed it greedily, aching for more, more.\n\nA cacophony of heavy explosions filled the air.\n\n“What’s that?” Victoria, breaking away, exclaimed. \n\nCaught in flagrante delicto, I panicked, fantasizing that a SWAT team—the FBI—was charging down the hall, flinging shock grenades, eager to arrest me for the allegedly deplorable crime of necking with a woman 107 years my senior. \n\nMore deafening explosions, then a swell of music, and I recognized the sounds as the opening scenes of the Vietnam War movie, *Apocalypse Now*, blasting from the unattended TV in a snoring resident’s room. \n\n“Better finish your dinner rounds before the natives get restless,” Victoria advised. She was suddenly cold, despite our recently completed mouth-to-mouth exchange of bodily fluids.\n\n“Whatever m’lady desires,” I said, bowing in an exaggeratedly courtly manner, kissing her spotted hand. Unsmiling, she shook me off and shut her door with unexpected force.\n\nI returned to the staff room, my mind a riot of passion and guilt. Grabbing a mop and pail I doubled back to the hall, where I picked the Salisbury steaks off the floor, mopped them, and then covered the lot with a fresh can of cold turkey gravy. To hell with the other residents. I only cared, deeply cared, about one; the sultry filly who was driving me clear out of my mind.\n\nUnder Victoria’s erotic spell, I found it hard to calm down. My good knee shook, my bad knee was still tender and store. Back in the staff room, I locked and bolted the door. As an extra measure, I blocked it with a pair of filing cabinets.\n\nI needed to think. I wasn’t much of a lady’s man. I’d “made out” with five girls and struck gold with one, though I’d been so drunk, I didn’t know it until she’d showed me the evidence on her phone. \n\nYet my shyness had melted away the moment I first saw lovely Victoria. From that moment on, I craved her kiss. Nothing, not even *ten* SWAT teams could keep from the exquisite pleasure of her cracked, dry lips.\n\nContemplating Victoria, my hands shook. To settle my nerves, I watched a video of former British PM Theresa May, who had a voice and manner that, without fail, lulled me to sleep…\n\nI awoke with a start, pulling a muscle in my lower back. I’d napped for minutes, but it seemed like years. Grabbing my cane, I shuffled over to staff medicine cabinet. On top of everything my stomach was cramping from constipation. I drank a heaping glass of Metamucil, with no results. \n\nI glanced the mirror. Something was dead wrong. My curly black hair was speckled with grey, and the crow’s feet had returned, more numerous and deeper than before. I looked like an anal cavity that had stopped functioning. I took a swing at the glaring overhead lights. My shoulder went out. Damn. More f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*g pain.\n\n*Brrnngg!!!* \n\nAn emergency bell rang. I checked the patient communications panel. The distress call was coming from Victoria’s room!  Tearing the file cabinets away from the staff door, my injured back muscle spasmed and I collapsed on the floor.\n\nGritting my teeth, I tried and failed to rise. I’d fallen down and couldn’t get up—in a retirement home! Laughing ruefully, I crawled outside to a recharging electric mobility scooter, pulled out the plug and dragged myself into the driver’s seat.\n\nI floored the vehicle, shouting at a resident who’d had the temerity to get in my way. Who gave a damn about his petty concerns!\n\nVictoria came to her door wearing a lacy black girdle, red high heels and sequined halter top. She puffed a Gauloises cigarette in an ebony holder. Her body was shockingly trim and fit. \n\n“What are you here for?” she asked, her voice still icy cold. She blew smoke in my face.\n\n“You rang.” \n\n“Oh, that’s right. Silly me,” she said, shaking her head.\n\n“So what is it you want to say to me?” I asked, desperate for encouraging words, like *kiss me, you fool*. \n\n“We’re done,” she replied, admiring her astonishing physique.\n\n“Wh-why? After all we’ve been through? I demand an explanation.”\n\n“I don’t date old men.”\n\n“I’m twenty f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*g years old.”\n\n“Could have fooled me. You can’t walk under your own power. You hair has gone completely gray. Your hands are trembling with early-stage Parkinson’s disease. And, for god’s sake, buy some Depends.”\n\nI looked down. Indeed, my crotch was soaking wet.\n\n“It’s you who’s done this to me. I was perfectly fine until I met you.”\n\n“Oh, such anger you have. And here I thought you adored me.”\n\n“I do. I mean, I need you. I want you. I exist for your kiss. Please, please, just one more and I’ll never ask again.”\n\nVictoria smiling knowingly. “You’re just like all the others. And there have been so, so many.” She shook her head.\n\n“I thought your lips were mine alone.”\n\n“One man has never been enough for me. You come and go. One night and, frankly, I’m done with you.”\n\n“No, no, I’m not like those other men. I’m decent. I’m kind. I’m yours for eternity.”\n\n“You poor, deluded soul. You have so much to learn. And so little time.”\n\n“Then a last kiss. I beg of you,” I cried, clasping my hands. I tried, but couldn’t stand up. \n\nIndulging me, Victoria bent down and plunged her tongue deep into my mouth, deeper than ever before. It was a sympathy kiss, I knew, but the effect on me was the same. I shuddered with excitement. We exchanged vile bodily fluids one last sweet time.\n\nCrestfallen, I turned around the mobility cart and whirred away. Half way down the hall I looked back. Victoria, my Victoria, was already back in her room. \n\nMy chest tightened unexpectedly. Sharp pain shot down my upper left arm. Struggling with the steering wheel, I careened through the partially opened staff room door, coming to a sudden stop against the far wall. Thrown to the floor, it took every ounce of my waning strength for me to boot up the portable heart defibrillator, attach the pads and shock myself out of a massive heart attack. My entire body shuddered. I lost consciousness.  \n\nI awoke with Jamie looming above me, her face a mask of benevolent concern. I was on a gurney in a room lined with row upon row of bedridden elderly men. They moaned and called out:\n\n“Kiss me.”\n\n“More, I want more.” \n\n“Abandon the others, Victoria. Make me the only one.”\n\n“Your arrival has agitated them. But don’t worry,” Jamie admonished me, “They’ll quiet down after the morning sedation.” She shifted a huge load of paperwork from one arm to the other, numerous pages fluttering to the floor. She wore a black babushka and a flowing peasant dress. \n\n“Where are the doctors? The nurses?” I asked, my words muffled by an oxygen mask.\n\n“We have sufficient staff,” Jamie observed. \n\nI turned to see numerous women, also in babushkas and peasant dresses, wiping patient brows, administering morning meds. They exuded professional cheer, laughing and joking with the dilapidated men.\n\n“And it may make you feel better to know that you’re *not* hospitalized. No, you’re still in Eternity Care, the hospice wing. In qualified hands, under specialized care.” Jamie was on her hands and knees, scooping up pages.\n\n“Is that my chart? Hand it to me right now!”\n\nJamie chuckled. “No. These are resumes,” she said, waving one. “We’re hiring again. Overnight male staff.”\n\n“But that’s my job. I need the money.” Speaking through the oxygen mask was like whispering “help” from the bottom of a well.\n\n“Please. You’re in no shape to continue. Nor is he. Or he,” she said, indicating two nearby patients.\n\n“And who the fuck are they?” \n\n“Your predecessors. In work and French kissing.” Sighing, she pulled up a plastic chair. She cradled her hands. Exhaled. “You see, Victoria is a special needs patient.”\n\n“And those special needs are—”\n\n“Men. About one every six weeks. She waxes after receiving your kisses. I once saw her run a six-minute mile the morning after a single night stand. And she had just turned, I believe, one hundred and fifteen. She ages quickly after that, until she reaches the broken-down state in which you first encountered her.”\n\n“Bullshit. Not possible.”\n\n“Not without single, lonely men like you. And your bile.\n\nI tore off the oxygen mask. “Let me the f\\*\\*k out of here you f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*g nutbag.” \n\n“Code white! Aggressive hospice care patient!” Jamie called out and two attendants came running. One of them restrained my arms. The other returned to my face the oxygen mask, sweat and saliva dripping down. My breathing had become labored, so I was actually thankful.\n\n“You’ve proved my point sir,” Jamie continued. “In the process of locking lips, Victoria partakes of the male essence. And returns it to you in neutered form of a thick paste.”\n\n“So what you’re saying is that the essence of man is vomit? Please!”\n\n“More precisely bile. Literally and figuratively.” \n\nA bout of laughing caused me to flat line. The attendants revived me with amyl nitrate, after which Jamie returned.\n\nJamie remained standing this time. She looked at her watch. “Listen, I’ve got to post this help wanted ad. Your position is open and Victoria will begin her precipitous decline again soon. There’s always another loner who wants to work the overnight shift.”\n\n“I’m going to report you to the health authority!”\n\nThis roused the patient next to me, a pathetic creature with a bulbous stomach and toothpick arms. “Me and you both,” he said, before falling again into a comatose state.\n\n“I think you’re better off here,” she said. Turning to the other patients, raising her voice, she proclaimed. “You’re all better off here, receiving the care only we can provide.” Her stern voice carried an implied threat.\n\n“So you’re ready to throw away your reputation for a single one-hundred-twenty-seven-year-old crazy woman?”\n\n“That’s where you’re wrong, sir. Victoria isn’t 127. She’s 238.”\n\n“Sure.”\n\n“Victoria’s my great-grandmother thirteen times over. I told you in my office that we were related. In fact, every female in here is related to her somehow, patients and staffers alike. It’s our home away from home. Victoria has been protecting the women of our village for centuries. She keeps us safe. Aging and regenerating. Aging and regenerating. By surrendering her body to manly bile. Which of course, all women do.”\n\n“So what makes Victoria different?” \n\n“She swallows. And one day all women will adopt her method. That’s why our clan brought her to the United States. The place that spreads freedom around the world. Keeping Victoria alive keeps hope of our own freedom alive.” \n\nWith that, Jamie left. \n\nAs of this writing, she has not come back, allowing me, with my pained, arthritic hands to scribble my tale. \n\nIn tiny cursive on this odorous pair of Depends. That I hope some dumpster diver will retrieve from the facility’s trash and bring to your attention.",

        "text": "Over the next few months [after my encounter with the pet killer](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/116luo2/i_had_a_house_that_eats_the_dead_it_became_an/), I erased two dozen men. I had some close calls before I developed a consistent methodology involving a camera, quiet slippers, and a very good knife. \n\nMy only regret was that for various reasons, a few guests left alive. Some never slept or stirred at the slightest sounds, and I couldn’t take those kind of chances. I couldn’t risk leaving my children orphans.\n\nStill, I was proud of the work I did. That said, the details are fairly mundane. By summer, I’d fallen into a pretty standard routine. \n\nAnd then I got a booking far different than any of the others. It was for a 70-year-old woman. The whole thing felt off, but then, the house always attracted a certain kind of person. I figured it was never wrong. \n\nI was more right than I realized.\n\nShe arrived in an old white Buick, a boat of a car. She was so short and bent her eyes barely reached over the steering wheel. Looking out the windshield must have been a struggle.\n\n“Can I help you with your bag?” I asked, as she slowly swung her legs out onto the driveway.\n\n“I travel light these days,” she said, looking right past me and up at the house. “Just a purse.”\n\nThen, I heard quick footsteps approaching from behind me and looked back to see Grace and Derek running up. \n\n“Who are you?” asked Grace.\n\n“She’s a guest,” I said.\n\n“You’re not like most of our guests,” said Derek.\n\n“I imagine you’re right,” said the woman with a playful smile. “I’m not like most people.”\n\nSomething about the way she looked at the children set me on edge.\n\n“You two go and play while I get our guest settled in,” I said. \n\nThe kids ran back inside, and the old woman watched them leave wistfully.\n\n“Darling,” she said. “The perfect family. And their father, does he run this place with you?”\n\n“He’s not in the picture,” I said.\n\n“Of course not,” she said. “I suppose they don’t remember him at all.”\n\nA chill went through me. Could she possibly know about Aaron? He was supposed to be erased to everyone but me.\n\n“Which way to the room?” she asked.\n\n“This way,” I said, trying not to betray any reaction to what she’d just said. \n\nAs soon as I’d left the woman alone in the room, I ran back to my side of the house and turned on the camera feed. As I watched, she took a small bundle of fabric out of her purse and unrolled it on the bed. Inside were what seemed like a random assortment of items: a chocolate bar, a lock of hair, a single rose, and dead bird. The woman put them down on the bed and waited, staring at the items intensely.\n\nThen, just barely, I could hear her whispering. \n\n“Eat,” she said. “Go ahead. There must be something here you like.”\n\nThe house had always been smart, careful not to reveal its nature to dangerous people. But this woman wasn’t like the rest. The men it had helped me eat had all been obvious in their appetites, even if they thought they hid them well. \n\nThis woman held her true nature close. This woman was like me.\n\n“Don’t do it,” I whispered to the house. \n\n“You’re a good boy, aren’t you?” said the old woman. Then she reached into her bag and took out a small knife. “Of course, we all have our weaknesses. The little treats we just can’t resist.”\n\nWith that, she cut the tip of one finger. Blood began to drip down onto the bedspread. Then I heard the sound of sandpaper, and the blood was gone.\n\nThe old woman nodded slowly. \n\n“It’s okay dear,” she told the house. “I can see you now. Go ahead and have the rest.”\n\nAs I watched, the rose began to wilt before disappearing into dust. Then, one by one, the rest of the objects began to disappear. \n\nAfter they were gone, the old woman rose and rolled up the fabric, placing it back in her purse. Then she calmly rose and walked out the door. \n\nA minute or two later, I heard a knock at the main house and opened it to find her standing outside.\n\n“I’m afraid I won’t be staying,” she said. “And perhaps we should have a little talk out here on the porch. You’ll forgive me if I’d rather stay outside.”\n\nI nodded and walked out, shutting the door behind me.\n\n“Who are you?” I asked, my heart pounding. \n\n“Oh, I’ve had a lot of names. People who don’t like me call me the Crone. I used to hate that name, but I suppose it’s become a bit of a badge of honor.”\n\n“What do you want?” I asked.\n\n“Nothing at all,” she said. “I’d just heard rumors of a new homeowner in town and wanted to reach out. We’re in the same business, you see, you and I. For a moment, I was worried we might step on each others’ toes. I’ve dealt with that in the past, and it was most unpleasant. But I can tell that your house and mine have very different tastes.”\n\n“I’m not so sure I know what you’re talking about,” I said. \n\n“Oh, I think you do,” she said. “But I admire your discretion. It’s always served *me* well, and I’ve been at this game far longer than you.”\n\n“I think I’d like you to leave,” I said.\n\n“Of course, dearie,” she said. “And I think we’ll both hope not to see each other again.”\n\nShe took a few steps down the stairs and gave me one last little wave.\n\n“Lovely children, by the way,” she added. “Do keep a close eye on them. The city’s not safe these days.”\n\nFor weeks after meeting the Crone, I felt a gnawing pit in my stomach. Just knowing she was out there, owning a house like mine with its powers of erasure, filled me with the darkest dread I’d ever experienced.\n\nAll night, I’d find myself taking inventory. Had I always had only two children? Had I ever had a cat? Had I dated anyone since Aaron? Of course, there was no way to really know. If the Crone had decided to feed anyone to her house, it would be just as if they’d never existed. All that would be left would be a pile of random stuff with all identifying traces scrubbed away, like when my house ate King and only his dog toys remained.\n\nOf course, I had no idea where she lived. Somewhere in the city, she had said, but that hardly narrowed it down. She was smart, too, the kind of woman who didn’t leave loose ends. She hadn’t seemed scared of me, either. Not one little bit.\n\nJust as she’d said, I hoped we’d never see each other again.\n\nAnd then one day when I was picking Derek up at school, I noticed a cubby next to his with no name on it. But inside there was clearly a backpack and an extra pair of clothes. The school asked parents to write names on the tags, so trying not to draw suspicion I dug through the bag, looking for any name, any trace of the child that owned them.\n\nI didn’t find a word.\n\n“Derek,” I said. “Whose locker is this?”\n\n“No one’s,” he answered. “It’s a ‘No One’ locker. There are a bunch of them at school. They’ve got stuff in them, but they don’t belong to anyone.”\n\n“How many?” I asked, my voice shaking. “How many No One lockers are there at this school?”\n\n“You’re scaring me,” he said, looking around for a teacher, anyone to save him from his own mother.\n\n“How many?” I repeated, trying not to sound panicked.\n\n“Maybe ten?” He said. “Eleven?”\n\nAs he spoke, I looked past his shoulder out to the chain link fence that bordered the school. And that’s when I saw her. \n\nThe Crone was watching us from the window of her car, a small smile on her face. There was something different about her, too. She looked younger than before, like a woman in her 50s. She was sitting up straight, and her hair was a dark gray now instead of white.\n\nWe met eyes, and she nodded, closing her eyes, deep in thought. Then, suddenly, she peeled off, driving away as fast as she could. A sudden feeling of panic filled my chest.\n\n“We’re going,” I shouted at Derek. “We’ve got to go!”\n\n“But school hasn’t even started yet,” he complained.\n\n“Now!” I shouted.\n\nI drove to Grace’s school as fast as I could. On the way, I tried calling a dozen times, only to hit the teacher’s voicemail. She’d always been impossible to reach.\n\nIt had started to rain in sheets, and I could barely see. I couldn’t stop shaking. Every once in a while, I had to turn back to look at Derek just to make sure he was there.\n\nFinally, we reached the small home preschool where Grace had been attending. It was really just a lady’s house with a few toys and games scattered around, but it was something we could afford, and Grace seemed to like it.\n\nI ran in, dragging Derek behind me. Inside, a few of Grace’s classmates were playing blocks, laughing, totally oblivious to the storm outside. Vaguely, I felt like I remembered the school being much more full when we’d first enrolled, but that wasn’t possible, right? No one had left as far as I could remember.\n\n“I need Grace,” I told the teacher. “Something’s come up. She needs to come home.”\n\n“There must be some kind of mix up,” said the woman. “I’m sorry you came all the way out here in the rain. Grace left with her grandmother just a few minutes ago.”\n\nI could have screamed and shouted. I could have called the cops. I knew neither would help. I took Derek and walked him back to the car. I didn’t cry. I wouldn’t let myself. There would be time for that later. Right now, I had to think.\n\n“You have a sister,” I told Derek as we got in the car. “You remember her, right?”\n\n“You mean Grace? Of course I do!” \n\n“Good,” I said. “Because as long as we remember her, it means she hasn’t been erased. And that means we still have a chance to save her.”\n\n“My sister is Grace,” he said.

        "text": "I honestly don't think anyone will believe me when I say this since a lot of people claim stories to be \"true\" when they most likely aren't. But I can promise you that this was something truly unforgettable. \n\nA few years ago I worked at a PF Chang’s not too far from me. Not a bad job as it was something to keep me busy and earn myself some money before starting my next semester of college. \n\nOne night, it was just like any other night. Things were slowing down and I was headed home. I took the route I normally took and honestly nothing didn't seem off about the night. Well, this wasn't until I noticed that I was the only car on the road. For clarification, my shifts typically ended around 10:30 and there aren't too many cars driving at the time especially on the weekdays. But, I would at least see a few pairs of headlights on my commute home. On that night, however, there weren't any. The night was still and quiet, but I didn't really pay much attention to it honestly since I had my music playing through my car speakers. But, little did I know that I was about to see something that I could only describe as \"something that clearly didn't belong.\" \n\nI turned onto the road that leads up to the stop sign turning into my development. At that very moment my eyes immediately focused on... some thing that was right in front of me. The creature was about two or three car's lengths away from me so I got a pretty good look at it. The creaturr was on the road walking towards me on all fours head on. \n\nIf I could give a description of this thing I would say that it looked like a dog... but something didn't seem right. First off, it was much too big to be a dog. You might say \"it might have been just a big dog\" but I know it couldn't have been. And secondly, by the way the creature \"walked\" it didn't look at all natural. It was in a crouch-like position as it walked like it was curious as to what I was. And IF it was a dog or any other natural woodland creature it would have moved as I approached, right? Like at least run away or something. Its almost like it was \"pretending\" to be a dog. It's eyes glowed too, either from its nocturnal nature or something otherworldly. It was light in color, probably gray, but my headlights didn't directly shine onto it and it was partially in the dark. \n\nKeep in mind I kept on driving forward while I was looking at it and at that moment I just wanted to get the hell away from that thing. When I made the turn into my development I didn't look back... I couldn't. This might sound silly but I was worried that it might follow me home. \n\nLuckily it didn't. But I can promise that, that night I didn't get much sleep. And to this day it left an impression in my memory that I could never shake off. If what I saw was just a normal animal then something was definitely wrong with it. But if it was what I thought it was then there's a chance this creature is still out there lurking. Every so often get the feeling that IT may be out there watching me.",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe following excerpt is from the diary of Nathan \\[Redacted\\], who was found dead in his apartment on 15th May, 2005.  His death might have been linked to three other victims namely Vienna \\[Redacted\\], who was found dead on 19th April; Matthew \\[Redacted\\] on 10th May and Hunter \\[Redacted\\] on 13th May, 2005 respectively.\n\n———————————————————————————————————————————\n\n8th May, 2005\n\nI had a lonely childhood. Something I’m not proud of, but I’m not sad about it either. I had a few friends, mostly people I would meet at school and never talk to them outside of it. but they were good people. I would hang out with them sometimes; often at a pizza place during weekends where we would gossip about the various happenings in the neighbourhood. Sounds silly, and maybe it was silly.\n\nI recently got the news that one of my friends from school had passed away, not that it bothers me. But there is an air of suspicion around it.\n\nI had last talked to them around like four years ago. Just a normal group phone call asking each other how all of us were doing. I noticed she was a bit tense but shrugged it off as adulting taking its toll on all of us. We weren’t teenagers anymore. We were real adults with responsibilities and that stresses out a lot of us. We feel overwhelmed as the weight of taking our own decisions dawns on us. Nevertheless, life goes on.\n\nVienna, she was a quiet girl. Whenever all of us would meet, she would talk the least; she would just sit there, passing comments very scarcely. She was quite nerdy as well, she would often bring a book along with her and read it while the rest of us were talking about Mr. Hunt. An odd fellow who would do gardening in the neighbourhood. He had a thick moustache, pale skin and was quite tall, very scrawny, in fact we used to laugh at the idea of a gust of wind picking him up and throwing him off somewhere else. But he was very odd, he used to chat with himself and often danced around while gardening. The adults thought he loved his job, and that’s what it would look like to anyone else but the four of us had seen him commit some weird acts here and there. Not that it matters, maybe we were just a bunch of teenagers who thought the jolly old gardener was weird and not what he seemed like; a normal occurrence where teenage brains  conjure weird probabilities that don’t exist to fend off boredom, maybe.\n\nI received an e-mail from Matthew yesterday stating that Vienna had committed suicide. Her sister found her in her work desk with her wrists slit, weird part is she gouged out one of her eyes as well. The police investigated it for a week per her sister’s request but it was ruled off as a suicide.\n\nVienna wasn’t particularly close to me or anything of that sort, but she didn’t strike me as someone who would kill herself. She was happy and content, at least that’s what it looked like. Now that I think of it, she always looked a little uncomfortable whenever we discussed Mr. Hunt. Did she know something we did not?\n\nMaybe I’m thinking too much about this, it feels like I’m disrespecting her. May she rest in peace, you were a good friend Vienna. We miss you.\n\n———————————————————————————————————————————\n\n9th May, 2005\n\nWhat a busy morning, the neighbour’s cats are so bothersome. They spilled milk on my doormat, had to clean it up and dry off the doormat so that it wouldn’t smell. I need a cup of coffee now.\n\nAnyway, I got another e-mail from Matthew today, he sounded a bit tense, I think he’s overreacting a little bit. He was never the mature one anyway. Always up to some mischief and the joker of the group. A proper prankster.\n\nAh, I sound like a dick again. What’s it about bringing up Mr. Hunt now anyway? He’s long dead I suppose. He was already pale and old around nine years ago, what makes him think he’s alive now.  I think I need to make a cup of coffee and read the email once more. I’ll write it down for old time’s sake.\n\n‘Hey Nathan,\n\nYou didn’t reply to the email I sent you yesterday, are you that busy that one of your childhood friends committing suicide has no effect on you? You were always a jerk, unknowingly or knowingly, that I do not know.\n\nAnyway, I don’t think Vienna killed herself. Remember what she always used to say? That Mr. Hunt used to roam the entire neighbourhood after midnight? I don’t know if that’s true because I was long asleep by then but she told us once that she saw him defecate on Ms. Gianna’s porch once. She always had some weird stuff to say about Mr. Hunt remember? Like the time she once told us that she caught him making weird faces to her while she was coming home from school? That he supposedly danced around in the middle of the street after midnight singing ‘I heard she sang a good song’ or whatever that shit was?\n\nYou might think Im stupid right now Nathan, but I swear to god I heard someone singing this last night. I was too scared to even open my blinds and check on whatever the fuck it was Nathan. Vienna always had some stuff to say about Mr. Hunt until one day she stopped saying anything about him at all remember? She always looked visibly uncomfortable whenever we discussed him. I wonder what she saw or heard that it was enough to warrant her silence. Im fucking creeped out Nathan, I swear I heard someone sing this exact song last night. Was I hallucinating Nathan? Tell me I was hallucinating.\n\nWhy would Vienna kill herself? She was the one out of all of us who had her life on track. I don’t know who killed her. I fucking don’t know. But I know she didn’t kill herself. Reply to this fucking email Nat, I need to know what you think.’\n\nGosh, what a piece of work. Ruining a perfect Sunday morning gushing out nonsense over some song. I need to tell Matthew its perfectly fine to be stressed out after one of your friends are no longer with you, but disrespecting her in a way by going as far as to say she was murdered? By whom? Mr. Hunt? He didn’t have the strength in him to even kill a fly if he could. But yeah, I did see Mr. Hunt a few times dancing around the neighbourhood after midnight and now that I think of it, I did hear him sing some song. Not sure if it was the one mentioned by Matt though.\n\nEnough about Matthew’s utter nonsense. I’ll write to him that there’s no need to worry and that he should consider going out for a few drinks to calm his nerves. He sounds very tensed up, it’s very unlike him.\n\nI’ll go and work on my assignment in the meanwhile, the office deadlines are scarier than Mr. Hunt singing a song at twelve in the morning. The coffee needs some sugar as well. I’ll update you guys tomorrow, buh-bye.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n———————————————————————————————————————————\n\n10th May, 2005\n\nCome to really think of it, I heard someone sing something outside last night. Maybe I was dreaming. I must’ve. I can’t update too much today though I have some really important work I should attend to.\n\nIts really weird there’s no email from Matthew today though, I specifically asked him to reply to me so that I could help him since Hunter wasn’t picking up his phone nor replying to any of me or Matt’s mails. I called Matt but he didn’t pick up either. Must’ve been real angry at me for him to ignore me as much as he’s doing after sending such a paranoid and descriptive email.\n\nA funny occurrence, or a memory that was buried deep within came to my mind last night while I was dozing off, me and Vienna used to sometimes grab ice-cream from the stall opposite to her house before heading off to school. One particular day while me and her were crossing the street onto the stall, we noticed Mr. Hunt was there, rummaging through the packets of chips while the cashier gave him a tired and annoyed look. He heard our footsteps and paused, turned around and gave us a wide grin. He chatted with us for a few minutes asking us normal questions such as ‘Are you kids studying properly? Not goofing around right?’ But he said something at the end which, come to think of it, was mildly disturbing.\n\n‘Ive seen you stay up till late reading some book Vienna. You should sleep early, its good for your health’\n\nWas he stalking her? Or was it a mere coincidence? No, he was definitely stalking her. I remember Vienna turning pale and seemingly uncomfortable. I remember her not talking about Mr. Hunt anymore after that interaction. Did he do something to her?\n\nI also think he used to stand facing the walls adjacent to Vienna’s house early morning for no reason. I thought it was normal, or funny during those days. It feels a little creepy now. Staring into a wall for who-knows-how-long isn’t a normal occurrence or a hobby.\n\nDid I really hear someone singing outside my window last night? Or was I actually dreaming. Whats going on. I should call Matthew and check on him once. I should also probably write to Hunter once as well.\n\nI’ll update you guys tomorrow. I have to attend to work now, as much as I hate to. Goodbye.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n———————————————————————————————————————————\n\n11th May, 2005\n\nFuck fuck fuck fuck FUCK. I ACTUALLY heard someone sing something like ‘I heard she sang a good song’ last night around four in the morning. And the worst part is it sounded EXACTLY like Mr. Hunt. What the actual FUCK?\n\nNo reply from Matthew either. What the fuck is he doing? Why is he ignoring me so much. I really need to talk to him. Why would Mr. Hunt start appearing in some random city so far away from where we used to live during our teens? I think Hunter sent me a mail though. I need to write it down so that I can find any detail that could possibly help me know whoever the fuck is stalking me and Matthew. And why now?\n\nAnyway, here’s the mail.\n\n‘I don’t know what to say Nat. Life is downhill. I think Im going crazy. I hear some weirdo sing a stupid fucking song every fucking night outside of my house. I looked out once and there was nobody. I know its a stalker though. I received an envelope in my mail today. There was no sender’s address or receiver’s. Just my name written on it with a ‘:)’ on one side. Inside was a FUCKING yearbook from our graduation year. Our fucking yearbook. With you and me and Matt and Vienna’s names written on the front page. Line by line. I can’t send you the photo because I threw that shit as soon as I opened it. I got too scared. Who the fuck is stalking us? And that too someone that knows us since this long. Let me know ASAP if you find anything Nat. I am too fucking scared to even sleep tonight.\n\nStay safe, I miss the feeling of comfort. I think we took everything for granted.’\n\nFUCK.\n\nI feel scared. I feel dread. Hunter lives approximately what, twenty minutes from my apartment? Matthew around an hour and Vienna lives in a different state altogether. Is it really Mr. Hunt or someone impersonating him? No. Its him. It has to be him. Who else would have access to our yearbook if not him. That fucking weirdo.\n\nWait. Did he kill Vienna? What the fuck. Even If he did not I need to report this to the police. I’ll go right now. I’ll update you guys tomorrow. I feel scared. I hope Matt and Hunter are okay. Goodbye, and good night.\n\n———————————————————————————————————————————\n\n12th May, 2005\n\nI AM FUCKING DONE WITH EVERYTHING. I AM SO DONE. The police can never take anything seriously until someone seriously gets hurt. I even told them that the suicide of Vienna might be related to what’s happening to me, Hunter and Matthew but they weren’t convinced enough to think Vienna might’ve been murdered by a creepy gardener who also happens to be stalking the other three now.\n\nA total failure in the name of justice. I cannot keep up with this anymore. I feel sick. I feel tired. What has been happening?\n\nMatthew hasn’t replied either. I don’t think he’s ignoring me or Hunter anymore, I think something might’ve happened to him. FUCK. Something might’ve happened to Matthew? Does that mean he might be in danger. Should me and Hunter try and drive up to his town and check on him. We should.\n\nWhat if he’s already dead though? And it might be a trap for me and Hunter to step into. Because Mr. Hunt or whoever-the-fuck would know we would come looking for him. Yeah, probably shouldn’t save him. He’s anyway most probably either ignoring us or he might’ve fled the town. A fucking wuss as always.\n\nAh, I shouldn’t say this. We’re all in danger. We should probably stick together. We should, yes.\n\nHunter wrote to me. I must read it and write it down before discussing further events, this is not funny anymore.\n\n‘Nat I can’t take this anymore. I received another mail with the same fucking ‘:)’ on it. Inside was a piece of paper with your name written on it. Nathan \\[Redacted\\]. What the fuck? I stayed up all night and there it was, someone singing ‘I heard she sang a good song’ around two in the morning. I wanted to look out but something inside of me wouldn’t let me. I felt dread. I felt scared as shit Nathan. It must be Mr. Hunt, it has to be. Who else if not him? I hear him dancing outside even now. Its just outside my bedroom window. Its five in the morning right now Nat and I don’t know what to do. I called 911 but they won’t take my calls seriously. You know I was caught for possessing drugs a few months back, or you don’t because we haven’t kept touch but yeah, they think Im high or some shit. Fucking useless. I don’t think I can hear his footsteps anymore. I’ll go out and confront him if this shit happens again. This is not funny anymore. I’ll visit you today evening if I can and we’ll discuss this together. Have you tried contacting Matt? He’s not answering my calls or mails. I hope he’s okay or he’s probably ignoring us, that jerk. See you soon and please be safe. Remember, he wrote your name on it. Oh fuck there he is with the song again, I’ll go out and bash his head in, that old fucker.’\n\nI heard she sang a good song\n\nI heard she had a style\n\nSo I came to see her\n\nAnd listen for a while\n\nThese same exact lines, the tune. The melody.  I heard it this morning again. Something feels off about everything that has been going on. It just doesn’t feel right. I feel so suffocated I don’t know who or why is anyone doing this. I just want whoever it is to just stop.\n\nWHY THE FUCK ISNT MATTHEW REPLYING TO ME. What the fuck is he upto? I think we should go and check on him when Hunter comes up to my apartment. Or we shouldn’t.\n\nAnd my name on the parcel? A smiley face? Weird as fuck. Our yearbook. From six years ago. Who would be in possession of it? Not Mr. Hunt because he was just a gardener. Even if he’s doing all of this? Just why? What is the point of all this? He always used to be friendly to us, I admit he was a little weird. No, really fucking weird.\n\nBut what the fuck is the point of all of this?\n\nI can hear someone banging at the door. Sounds like whoever is on the other side is really impatient. Must be Hunter. I’ll go and talk to him and we even might decide to check up on Matthew’s house on the other town. Ah, not a goodbye yet. I will write again tonight.\n\nMatthew is dead. I cannot believe this, the police again ruled it off as a suicide because of his slit wrists and funny enough, his one eye was gouged out as well. Talk about coincidences; I don’t feel anything. I just want to know who, and what is the motive behind this. Who is next? Fuck it.\n\nHunter received another mail in the span of the few hours he was inside his home. This time it was the same fucking weird envelope with the ‘:)’ on it but inside was a photo, a polaroid of Matthew’s t-shirt and his track-pants laid out on his bedroom floor.\n\nHunter is really, really creeped out and wants to spend the night over at my apartment. And as much as I hate to share my private space, I can’t help but go on with it because frankly I am too scared to sleep alone tonight either.\n\nI’ll update you guys tomorrow. I feel a bit okay now that I know I’m not gonna be spending the night alone.\n\n———————————————————————————————————————————\n\n13th May, 2005\n\nThere was no singing last night or maybe I was too sound asleep to notice. I woke up to Hunter not being there but he left a note. I’ll read it now.\n\n‘Nathan, don’t’\n\nSimply that. Don’t what? At least give me a fucking explanation. I’ll call him now, I need to talk to him where the fuck did he vanish off to?\n\n…He’s not picking up. He wore some of my clothes and left the stuff he was wearing on the couch. Where could he have gone? Hunter don’t fucking ditch me at the last minute when two of our friends have been fucking possibly murdered.\n\nI’ll write later tonight. I’ll try asking the neighbours if they’ve seen Hunter leave in the morning.\n\nThey didn’t see anyone leaving my apartment early morning or the previous night. Nor did they hear anyone leave or any weird noises that they might have noticed. FUCK.\n\nI need to call him again.\n\nHe’s not picking up. I can’t take this anymore. The people I once knew just vanishing one by one without any explanation as to what might’ve happened or what’s going on. I just hope Hunter is alive or that he’s probably in hiding having abandoned me, whatever his choice I hope he’s safe. That’s all.\n\nI’ll sleep now. I am not scared anymore. I am not.\n\n———————————————————————————————————————————\n\n14th May, 2005\n\nPeace. I think I took it for granted. I didn’t hear any song or see anybody dancing in the middle of the street, or any strange occurrences whatsoever. I am happy. I feel relieved.\n\nHunter still hasn’t picked up any of my calls nor is he responding to any mails. I don’t care. I am finally relieved to be free of all these. I feel happy.\n\nA letter came through today. That same envelope but with no smileys. Inside was a small wrinkled torn piece of paper with a drawing of a garden. Coloured with green crayons, even the sky is green. A few red roses and the rest are all bushes and trees. And a small ‘:)’ at the bottom right of the poor attempt at illustrating a garden.\n\nIt didn’t bring up any feelings in me. I’ll sleep soundly again tonight with no disturbances and no fear. Mr. Hunt, or the gardener or whatever the fuck it is.\n\nIt’s a surprisingly cold evening even though the sun is still up. I think its the breeze.\n\nWherever you guys are; Matthew, Vienna and Hunter. I think we should’ve stuck together after high school. You guys were the only people I could call ‘friends’ or whatever.\n\nAnyway, I’ll go sleep. I have some work to attend to. I’ll update you guys tomorrow. I’ll ring up my mom before I head to bed.\n\nCome to think of it, it isn’t a bad song.\n\n*I heard she sang a good song*\n\n*I heard she had a style*\n\n*And so I came to see her*\n\n*And listen for a while*\n\nI like it.\n\n———————————————————————————————————————————\n\nThat was the last diary entry from Nathan \\[Redacted\\]. He was found dead on 15th May, 2005 in his apartment apparently having committed suicide. His one eye gouged out just like the other three ‘suicides’.",

        "text": "I’m a lover of seafood. The aroma when you have a fresh baked salmon covered in bread crumbs drizzled in sour lemon coming straight from the oven is next to orgasmic. My mother taught me to make the greatest paella with fresh scallops and jumbo shrimp that still is my favorite meal to make. My boyfriend adores when I make this so I try to make it more and more special every time. \nThe shrimp are our favorite part by far so when we learned of the discovery of a new species of so called “mantis shrimp” that were discovered of the coast of Cambodia we were ecstatic. Our local aquarium got the honor to hold an exhibit of a large live tank feeding of these majestic and massive yet creatures. Further more for valentines my boyfriend was able to get tickets to see it live! I couldn’t be happier to see my favorite creatures in the best recreation of a visceral habitat that could be seen. \n\nThe day of the feeding finally rounded the corner and I wore my favorite homemade felt shrimp sweater and we were off. The exhibit wasn’t as packed as I would’ve expected. How could people not want to see this once in a lifetime opportunity?! Getting to see these modern monsters up close it’s almost offensive to see how few actually showed up. My boyfriend tapped my shoulder and said “Hey, with the small turn out maybe we could ask if we could drop some of the food for the little… well maybe not so little guys.” “Oh my god! Do you think they’d actually let us?” I exclaimed maybe a little too loud as I drew the attention of the other shrimp enthusiasts around. “Certainly worth a shot.” He replied, walking over to a attendant in a wet suit standing in front of the swirling darkened tank. He chats, pointing over here and there and while at first the body language of the employee looks hesitant it seems like the second love of my life (next to shrimp) talks him into it. He starts back over giving me a big grin and a thumbs up, “Well what do you saw the gave us the go ahead.” I fling my arms around him and gave the biggest hug I could muster in my excitement. I catch a glimpse of the wet suited man wave us over and I practically shove my man over on my way over to what will be the greatest moment of my life. He explains the jargon of being careful over the tank and to only do exactly as he says for both my safety and the shrimps. I nod and agree in response and after what feels like eons he says “Let’s get this show on the road!” He walks my boyfriend and I behind the tank and up a narrow metal staircase that lead to a catwalk above the murky tank. I notice we haven’t even gotten a good look at these exquisite crustaceans as a light clangs on behind the tank flooding it with graceful purples, blues and greens. It was now I finally could view these beings in all their glory. From what I can see each one looks to be roughly 20-22 centimeters long and 6-7 centimeters wide. The “mantis” in their name makes much more sense in this glow as I can see easily four 5 centimeter long bent-forward-at-the-elbow claws on each of these animals. As I walk over to the front of the tank I got a slight chill down my spine. On of pure comprised excitement. Well, that and it almost seems like the eyes of these hundreds of monsters stare straight at me. It does nothing but excite me further. \n\nWe reach the front of the tank and the attendant begins the show. Explaining there’s a slight change of plans as a special guest has come forward for the feeding. I hear other things being said but in my blinded excitement I can’t hear anything but the swashing and swishing of the small tides in the tank below, the subtle clicks of little bodies scuddling on the glass. I wonder what noises they’ll make when devouring their given prey. A bucket of fish entrails, small snails and writhing worms snaps me from my daydreams. “Here we go folks, the time you’ve been waiting for! Get ready for the very first live viewing of these carnivorous creatures!” I reach my hand in the bucket and just as I was about to pull the first scoop of scrumptious shrimp sludge  I feel a firm shove from behind. My footing falls loose on the slim catwalk and I feel a plunge into icy waters. Just before my visions succumbs to the beings all around me I look up to catch two beaming faces smile wickedly on the wall about me. Then. Pain. Twisted contorted torture. First I feel those observed claws dig into every inch of my body. My skin screams against the needles being plunged into me, I feel chunks slowly and surely being torn away from me little by little. When I thought that would be the worst of it I open my eyes and between the vibrant colors of the led lights being plunged into the tank a vicious red gives a sinister glow to the scene. Before I can think a second though I feel wriggling antennae dig into and behind my eyes crawling deeper and deeper in. I open my mouth to scream and feel hoards of the beasts begin to crawl down my throat. Conscious fading I accepted my end until I was snapped back to reality with the snapping of my own bones as the claws find their mark in severing my flailing limbs. Floating vacant husk I’ve become I finally understand the feeding of the deep, and I fade to the depths of the dark. \n\nA noise bubbles from around me. I feel a singeing heat around my entire head. I try to move and it just feels like a wriggle. Finally my eyes cooperate and I make out… shrimp? Why are they so entirely massive?\nI see my own body once more. Turning bright pink. Now I understand why something smelt so fishy.",

        "text": "\n\n\nShe's been up there for the last few weeks now, but that's just when I first noticed her. She very well could have been up there for much longer…\ne certainly looks like it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've called the police and the local news station, and even the damn mayor's office. But not a single person would help. Oh, they were concerned, at first.  Then someone would come out and walk over to the tree, and look up, and within a minute or two they'd be walking right back to their car, and sometimes they'd even run. \n\n\n\n\n\nIt sounds absolutely absurd. A lady sitting in a tree, in February. She's definitely not dressed for the weather, and normal people *shouldn't* be able to endure frigid temperatures like that wearing nothing more than what looks like a filthy potato sack. \nBut she has. And it doesn't seem to be bothering her at all. On the contrary, in fact, she seems to enjoy it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook, I think I'm a reasonable guy, who's fairly tolerant of his neighbors. \nI didn't complain when the Messick's 9 year old son took up playing the damn trumpet, one of music's loudest instruments. \n\n\n\n\nAnd when Mrs. Heddinger next door insisted that I remove my juniper bush because she worried it might give her cat diarrhea\n I did the neighborly thing and dug up the old bush, and tossed it out. \n\n\n\n\nI didn't even bat an eye when Ralph Larson down the street drove his golf cart into my mailbox last month. I just gritted my teeth,  and hauled away the splintered remains. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy point is that I'm not some overly uptight person who expects perfection in those around him. I'm sure I've done some things to annoy someone in the neighborhood at some point in the 2 years that I've lived here.\nI don't expect perfection, just normal behavior from my neighbors. \nBut this….. whatever this is, is going a bit beyond anything I'd call \"normal\". \nAnd no one seems to want to help. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI guess it started a couple weeks ago, but that's really just when I first noticed her up there. \nGod knows how long she'd been there before that. \n\n\n\n\nIt was about seven in the morning. I walked out to my car, keys in hand. I was just opening the car door when I saw her. I didn't even know it *was* a her at the time. Just a splash of white that caught my eye.  I stared up at the tree, squinting to focus on the spot amidst all the brown in an attempt to determine what it was. \nThere was no real concern yet. Just a vague sort of curiosity.  \nI checked my watch, making sure I wasn't running late before walking down my driveway toward the street. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe tree is a massive thing, like most of the trees our little community is known for, standing directly across the street from my house in the little cul de sac. \nI stood on the sidewalk, trying to see if I could get a good look at whatever it was without having to cross the street, but from my position all I could see was brief glimpses between the thick branches. \nI sighed, knowing if I didn't actually get eyes on whatever it was, it would bug me all day. For whatever reason I had to know. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI crossed the street and stood on the sidewalk for a few moments, shielding my eyes from the sun. Whatever it was, I couldn't see it through the thick branches and brown decaying leaves.  \n\nStaring up in the tree, I was immediately overcome with a feeling of unease that I couldn't explain. But it was strong enough that I decided to forget the damn tree, and headed for my car. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce my back was to the tree I had an intense urge to run, almost akin to when I was little and running up the basement steps, sure something was just behind me, reaching out with mottled fingers…but I tried to ignore it. \nJust as I reached my front walk, a sound broke through the quiet early morning, sharp and clear, and unmistakable: \"Pst\"\nLike a voice trying to get my attention….\n\nI stopped dead in my tracks. \n\n\nWithout turning around, somehow I knew the voice was coming from that tree. \n\n\n\n\nPride be damned, I ran then. Ran right to my car, fumbling to get the key in the lock. \n\n\n\n\nBefore I got the door shut and locked behind me, I could have sworn I heard another sound. Someone was laughing. \n\n\n\n\n\nThat night I didn't sleep soundly. I kept staring at my bedroom window, imagining that I could see the tree swaying in the breeze, a drop of pale colored skin moving along with it, as if waving. \n\nWhen the sun finally came up I dressed quickly, and hurried across the street,  hoping none of my neighbors could see me. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart of me chided myself for being irrational, but my legs continued moving nonetheless. \nI could hear birdsong and the faint hum of traffic in the distance. \nI pulled my jacket tighter around me, as the chilly winter breeze whipped at my skin. \n\n\nI stood at the base of the tree, and looked up into it. The tree had lost most of its foliage due to the cold.  But even though the tree was nearly barren, the many decaying leaves made it seem fuller, hiding the object pretty well. \nI positioned myself right under the 'thing' and that's when I finally saw it. \nI'm not sure what I was expecting to see but it sure as hell wasn't that. \n\n\n\n\nA woman was sitting on a thick limb, about 50 feet from the ground. \n\n\n\nI stood gawking at her, trying to make some sense out of her presence there. \n \n\n\n\n\nShe was staring straight ahead,  unblinking, and unmoving, wearing what looked to be a tattered potato sack,  but could have been the remains of a dirty old dress. Her thin bare legs dangled from the limb, twig-like and filthy. \nFor a moment I thought she was dead,  but I could see her movements,  however slight. \n\n\n\nI looked around the ground for a ladder, or some other way she'd gotten up there, but there was none. I wasn't sure how the woman had gotten in the tree in the first place. The tree wasn't what you'd call a typical climbing tree.  It was much too wide around, and the only reachable branches were too thin and spaced out so climbing would be next to impossible for most people. \n\n\nThe more I thought about it, the more I began to think it had to be some kind of prank, albeit a really strange one. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"Miss?\" I called up to her, finally. \"Are you alright up there? Do you need help getting down?\" \n\nIf she'd heard me she showed no sign of it, and continued to stare ahead blankly. She had to have been freezing, considering the temperature. That \"dress\" she wore. It couldn't possibly have offered any warmth. \n\n\n\n\nA few seconds passed but the woman still didn't respond, or acknowledge me at all.  \nI was about to call up to her again but before I could, the lady made a noise. \n\n\n\nA strange ragged wheezing sound floated down to me, growing louder with each passing second. \nIt took a minute for me to realize what the sound was, and for some reason it sent a chill through me.  \n\nLaughing.  Like someone trying and failing to suppress it. \n\n\n\n\n\nI took a step away from the tree, my instincts screaming at me to run. I had no explanation for this instant feeling of terror. All I knew was that something was terribly wrong with her. \n\n\nBefore I could get my feet to move, the woman's head shifted. She began to lean out over the limb that she sat perched on, her face tilting downwards ever so slowly, until she was staring down at me. She leaned so far over that I felt certain she'd fall. \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAt first her face was blank, void of any emotion at all. But that changed in the blink of an eye, her lips stretching into a ghastly grin that somehow took up most of her ashen face, yet didn't reach her eyes. \n\n\n\nShe was breathing in those shallow wheezes that became almost deafening despite the nearly intimate quiet of our surroundings.  \n\n\n\nHer hands were gripping the branches so hard that I could hear the bark ripping free and see pieces drifting down to the ground where I stood. \n\n\n\n\n\nWe both stared at one another for a long time before she suddenly opened her mouth, so wide I thought her jaw might break, letting out a deep raspy whine, and that's when I ran. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI ran home, and burst through my front door in a panic, slamming it behind me and locking both locks. Even that didn't seem like enough.  \n\n\n\n\nI waited there with both hands on the door, waiting for the sound of a body ramming into it, but it didn't come.  When I finally got myself under control, I risked a look out the window of my front door, but thankfully I couldn't see her. \n\n\n\n\n\nI didn't go to work that day. As silly as it may sound to you, I was afraid. Afraid of leaving my house. Afraid I'd hear that shallow wheezing laugh and see her glaring through the branches at me. \n\n\n\n\nBy mid-afternoon that fear began to dwindle and I started to feel angry. \n\n\n\n\nWhether this was some weird joke, something stemming from a mental illness, or something else entirely, made no difference to me. I was pissed at being made to feel terrified to leave my own house.  \nI went to bed fuming, with plans to go right out there in the morning to have a chat with that lady, if she was still there. \n\n\n\n\nI didn't sleep well that night. \nMy eyes kept drifting to the window, staring out at the darkness beyond the glass. I couldn't help but imagine the lady from the tree, with her dirty face pressed up against it. \n\n\n\n\nI woke the next morning before my alarm, and even beat the sun. \n\n\nI dressed quickly and drank my coffee while I waited for the sun to fully rise. By the time it had, all of my bravado from the previous night seemed to vanish. \nI stole a glance out of the living room window, but if the lady was still there I couldn't see her. \n\n\nI ignored my trembling hand as I opened the door and made my way across the street. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe branches swayed in the icy February wind that stung my face and crawled up my jacket. I stood a few feet from the base of the tree, and looked up into it.  \nI didn't see her, and let myself relax slightly. \nI hoped the frigid temperatures had made her find a new spot. \n\n\n\n\n\n I took a step closer, but that's as far as I got, as the quiet was interrupted by a loud growling, coming from right above me. \nBefore I could look up, I heard something crashing through the branches, and smacking onto the frozen ground with\n a wet squelch, landing right in front of me. \n\n\n\nA dead squirrel lay at my feet, its fur soaked in blood and bits of flesh. \nIt looked to be \"empty\" inside from what I could see except for a few bones that helped it to keep its shape. Even the eyes looked to be missing. \n\n\n\n\nI stared frozen at the partially devoured carcass in front of me. Then I heard a muffled yet familiar sound. Laughing. \nI ran home without looking up, knowing I'd see her bloody face grinning back at me. \n\n\n\nThe next day was a Saturday, and I vowed to do something about the lady in the tree. \n\nI was past the point of talking to her. And after the squirrel, I was also no longer angry. I was disturbed. She was clearly suffering from a mental illness and needed some professional help. \n\n\n\n\n\nI did the only thing I could think of and called the police and explained the situation.  The dispatcher assured me that they would make sure the lady got the help she needed. \n\n\nI stood by the door, occasionally peering through the blinds. \nThe officers arrived about 20 minutes later, and from the little window above my door, I watched them walk straight towards the tree. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey stood directly underneath, and looked up into it. For a long moment they just stared, as if confused at what they were seeing.  \nEven from across the street I could see their expressions change, going from a vague curiosity to completely unsettled.  They shared a brief look of concern at one another, before the female officer began talking up at the lady in the tree, shifting uncomfortably as she did so. She spoke for a few minutes, and then the officer's unsettled expressions changed again, to one of utter horror. \n\n\n\n\nThe burly male officer jumped back from the tree as if he'd been stung, quickly grabbing his partner by the elbow, and pulling her with him. She didn't seem to protest this, and together they backed away from the tree, their hands hovering over their holsters, and nearly falling over the curb. \n\n\n\n\nOnce they reached the street they both stopped and stared up at the tree, neither saying a word.  \nSuddenly there was a flash of movement from up in the tree, causing the branches to shake violently in the spot where I knew the lady sat. \n\n\n\nThe officers spun around and booked it across the street to their car, their faces twisted with fright. \nI scrambled to unlock the door and ran outside, calling out to them.\n\n\n\n\nThey looked at me and for a second I thought they might leave. I could tell they wanted to. When they didn't I jogged over to their car. \n\n\n\n\n\"Are you the person who called?\" The male officer asked. From up close I could see how pale they looked, with sweat beading on their foreheads despite the cold. \n\n\n\n\n\"Yes, Sir. Are you going to get her down from there?\" I asked, hopefully.  \n\n\n\n\nThe officer briefly glanced sideways at the tree, shuddering a bit before looking back at me, the fear in his eyes suddenly replaced by anger. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"Sir, this isn't an issue for the police. Go back inside your-\" He started, but I quickly cut him off. \n\n\n\n\n\"Not an issue for the police? Then who's issue would it be?\" I asked, shocked. \"The lady has been up there for God knows how long. She's clearly not in good shape. You saw what she was wearing!\" \n\n\n\n\n\nThe female officer stepped forward, threateningly. \"Sir, I'm going to need you to calm down.\"  She said, \"The lady doesn't seem to want our help at the moment.  She is content where she is and that is her right.\" She glared at me, her eyes begging me to push the issue. \n\n\n\n\n\"But….she can't possibly be well. You spoke to her for less than a minute. Shouldn't you at least have her checked out by a doctor or- \"  I said.  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe male officer stepped toward me, so close that I could smell the stale remnants of spearmint gum on his breath.  He clenched his jaw, eyes narrowing as if he wanted to hit me. For a second I thought he might. \"She's a grown woman and is free to sit in a tree on *public* property if she likes. You don't own the tree, sir. And let me remind you that it is a crime to misuse 911. Now, don't call us again about this, or we'll be coming to arrest *you*.\" \n\n\n\n\nThey hopped in the car without another word and sped off.  I watched the car disappear down the road, completely baffled. \nI didn't look up at the tree. I didn't want to see her. But somehow I knew she was there watching, and maybe even laughing. \n\n\n\n\nI spent the rest of the day thinking about what I could do. \nI figured if the police wouldn't do their job then I'd find someone who would. \n\n\n\nI called the local news station and told them about the woman and how terrible of a condition she looked to be in, as well as how the police came and went without doing a thing. \n\n\n\nThe lady I spoke with sounded appalled at the situation and promised to send someone out to speak with me.\n\n\n\nThey came the following afternoon, a lady reporter and a licensed psychologist, and after speaking with me for a few minutes, they walked over to the tree. I watched them talking to the woman from my front porch, but I couldn't hear what they said. \n\n\n\n\n\nI could see how the smiles slid off their faces the moment they looked up into the branches. I could see how antsy they seemed as they spoke, trying to convince the woman out of the tree, but just like the police officers, they didn't last long. \n\n\n\nThree minutes later they were hurrying across the street, their expressions a look of sheer panic. They didn't even stop to speak with me. The cameraman almost knocked me over when I tried to talk to them, and all my calls to the news station afterward went unanswered. \n\n\n\n\n\nAt a loss, I tried the mayor. I left numerous messages, and finally got a response the next morning.  \n\nThe mayor's office sent someone out later that day. A cocky little guy in a suit with slicked back hair and a sly grin that seemed a permanent fixture on his face. \n\n\n\n\nI tried to prepare him for what he would see, but he waved me off as if I were just some overdramatic afraid of a mentally ill woman in a tree. \n\n\n\n\"She hasn't been violent at all?\" He asked, a sneer on his face that I wanted to slap.  \n\n\n\n\"No. Not yet.\" I said through gritted teeth. 77\n \n\n\n\n\"So she just…. sits up there then?\" He asked. I could tell he wasbreathing breathingAs 4eudging me, 9th inning 9th inning me a fool for being afraid of a woman who hadn't done anything to me. But he didn't know. He would though. \n\n\n\n\n\"Like I said, so far. She isn't well.  She hasn't come down in days and she's got to be freezing.\" I said.  He nodded, bored. \n\n\n\n\n\"How do you know she hasn't come down at all? Have you watched her constantly?\" He asked. That stupid grin again. \n\n\n\n\n\"No. Not constantly.\" I said. \"But I think I would have noticed if she has been getting up and down.\" He looked down at his phone, pretending to listen. \n\n\n\n\n\"Alright sir. Don't you worry.  I'll go have a talk with the lady.\" \nHe strolled across the street as though he were walking in a park, oblivious to what he was about to see. \n\n\n\nHe looked up into the tree, and that stupid smirk instantly fell from his face, his skin going pale. The longer he stared the worse he looked. His mouth went slack, and his legs looked as if they were ready to buckle. \nAll of a sudden something dropped from the tree, something much too small for me to distinguish what it was. His hands flew to his face, frantically wiping at it desperately.  \n\n\n\nHe fell back onto his ass, and scooted away from the tree. He ended up crawling on his hands and knees, until he reached the street. \nWhen he ran to his car I could see his face was speckled with rusty brown spots. \n\n\n\n\n\nI watched him drive away, no longer surprised by that point. I felt completely dejected. No one wanted to be near the woman, so they just left her up there. \nOut of options, I did the only thing I could and tried to ignore her. It definitely wasn't as easy as you might think.  \nI avoided going outside as much as possible and never looked in the direction of the tree whenever I had to leave the house.  \n\n\n\n\nThe next couple of days were awful, but the nights were the worst. I was afraid to close my eyes as I lay in bed, always watching that damned window. \n\nI could see the start of frost at the corners of the glass, and as fucked up as this sounds, it became my only solace that night.  \nI pictured her up there on that limb, her bare feet and exposed skin slowly turning blue, and it made me feel a little better.  I hoped she would have one uncomfortable night out there, and finally abandon the tree. \n\n\n\n\n\nI told myself that I did my part to try and help her, and if she eventually succumbed to the elements it wouldn't be on my conscience.  \nAs strange and unsettling as the woman was, she was still just a person with an obvious mental illness. I had a feeling that it wouldn't be long before there would be nothing but a corpse up in that tree. \nI hate to admit it but part of me was looking forward to it. An end to this very disturbing ordeal. \n\n\n\n\nI was able to avoid the tree for the rest of the week, taking a few days off from work. I only went out to get the mail or if I desperately needed something from the store. \n\n\nThose brief moments out there, with the tree looming across the street, the very air around me felt ominous. Look, I know that my fear may seem irrational, it's not like the woman had even done anything violent. She hadn't even left the tree. Technically the only person she was hurting was herself.  \nI tried to tell myself that my fear was irrational, but on Monday things took a turn for the worse. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was around noon that day when I heard a knock.  \nFor a moment I just stared at the door, imagining the lady from the tree standing on the other side.\nI hesitated but as the knocking grew louder, more insistent, I finally made myself open it. \n\n\nMrs Heddinger stood on my porch, her hands on her hips. \n\n\n\n\"Didn't you hear me knocking, Michael?\" She snapped.  \n\n\n\nI glanced over her head at the tree, and for a second I thought I saw a glimpse of flesh peeking through the limbs, and forced myself to look away. \"Sorry Mrs Heddinger, I was -\"\n\n\n\n\"You look terrible. Haven't you been to work? I haven't seen you leave in a few days.\" She said.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\"I haven't been feeling well actually.\" I said. \n\n\n\nShe stepped back, eyeing me carefully. \"You don't have the Covid, do you?\" She asked, \"Because you legally have to tell me.\" \n\n\n\n\n\"Uh, no. I don't have Covid. It's not that kind of sickness.\" I said, wanting to get rid of her and close the door as fast as possible. \n\n\n\n\nShe stepped forward, attempting to peer over my shoulder into my house. \"You're not drinking are you? You know my grandson has a drinking problem and he -\" \n\n\n\n\"Was there something that you needed?\" I asked, cutting her off. \n\n\n\n\nShe gave a little huff, obviously displeased at my interruption. \"I was wondering if you'd seen my cat, Thurston.\" She said dryly. \"He sometimes wanders over here and I've been calling him all day.\" \n\n\n\nI shook my head. \n\"No, sorry. Haven't seen him.\" I said. \"But if I do I'll -\" a loud meowing echoed from across the street. \n\n\n\n\n\nMrs Heddinger heard it too, and turned around. \"Did you hear that?  That's my Thurston. I know that cry anywhere.\" She said. She started down the porch steps, but I quickly grabbed her arm. \n\n\n\n\n\"Don't go over there.\" I whispered, as if the lady in the tree could hear me. \n\n\n\n\n\"What in God's name is wrong with you?\" She snapped, yanking her arm free. \n\n\n\n\"I'm sorry. I didn't mean - Mrs Heddinger, there's a lady in the tree over there.\" I said. \n\n\n\n\n\"What are you talking about? Are you drunk, Michael?\" She asked sharply. \n\n\n\n\n\"No. I don't drink. There *is* a lady in that tree. I've called the police and no one will get her down. She isn't … she might be dangerous. I'd stay away from her.\" I said. \n\n\n\n\nShe huffed, and looked towards the tree, squinting. \"She must be one of those drug addicts I hear about on the news every night. Probably up there smoking the methamphetamine.\" She said, shaking her head, disgusted. \n\n\n\n\"There's something very wrong with her.  But don't think she's on drugs.\" I said.  \n\n\n\n\"You can't always tell who is and who isn't, Michael.  My grandson ran with people like that. They seem fine until they show up at your house one day and all your spoons disappear.\" She said.  \n\n\n\n\n\"I don't think it's drugs.\" I said again. \n\n\n\"Michael, sober women don't go climbing trees in the middle of February. She's on something, and I'll be damned if I'm going to let her sit her bony ass up there while my cat has to breathe in her poison.\" She said. She hurried down the walk, ignoring my pleas. \n\n\n\nI know I should have done more to stop her. But like the coward I am, I just ran inside and locked the door. \nI watched her from my front door window, my heart hammering in my chest. \n\n\n\n\n\nShe stood on the sidewalk just beneath the tree, staring up, one hand over her eyes. \nI couldn't see the lady in the tree but I could tell Mrs Heddinger did. \nShe looked surprised at first but quickly recovered herself, and began gesturing for the woman to come down. She spoke for a few minutes, when she stopped suddenly, and a look of sheer terror washed over her face. \n\n\n\nHer mouth dropped open, and even from across the street I could see her hands trembling.   \nBranches began swaying high up, shaking so hard that dead leaves began raining down around Mrs Heddinger's feet. \n\n\n\n\nWhen the tree stopped shaking, Mrs Heddinger stepped closer to the trunk, so close that her body pressed up against it. I could see out her lips moving quickly, just before she began to climb the tree. \n\n\n\n\nI don't know how she did it with no reachable branches, and at her age, but she somehow managed to shimmy up the tree, disappearing inside the dying leaves. \n\n\n\n\nI waited for her to reemerge, but the minutes ticked by and there was no sign of her. I was just about to open the door when I finally saw her, climbing backwards down the tree. \n\n\n\nWhen she reached the bottom, she stood frozen, staring right at me. As if she could see me. \n\n\nI moved away from my window, contemplating calling the police again, even if it meant getting arrested. Something was very wrong. \nI risked another look out the window and to my horror Mrs Heddinger was grinning. A smile so twisted and unlike her usual unpleasant expression that it made my skin crawl just to look at it. The moment my eyes fell on her she began to shuffle across the street, her eyes locked on my house. \n\n\n\nI had no idea what I would do if she tried to get inside but she never made it across the street.\n\n\n\nIt all happened as if in slow motion. \n\n\nA black car came speeding down the street, the driver's face turned towards me, grinning wildly. A face I recognized. The man from the mayor's office.  \n\n\nHis car slammed into Mrs Heddinger, her body bouncing off the hood and onto the pavement with a sickening crunch. \nHe drove right over her as he peeled out of the neighborhood, never stopping once. \n\n\n\n\n\nI ran out front, but was unable to look at the broken remains of Mrs Heddinger. \n\n\nI called 911 and her body was eventually taken away. No one cared about the lady in the tree though. \nThey did however take down the info about the man from the mayor's office. \nI heard he was found dead in his car by self-inflicted stab wounds just a few miles away.  I overheard one of the officers claim they'd found him smiling. \n\n\n\nI stayed in my house for the weekend, thinking seriously about moving.\n\n\n\nYesterday, when I went into my upstairs  bathroom, I couldn't help but wonder if she was still there. I was hopeful that maybe, just maybe she'd finally left. \nI carefully looked out the window at the general spot where I thought she'd sat. \nThe sun had already begun to set, but the streetlight across the street illuminated the tree well enough.  \n\n\n\nMy eyes scanned the branches for her, but the distance made it difficult. Just as I was about to give up, I saw it. High up in the tree, almost nearing the very top, a face peered through the branches. \nThat same dirty, smiling face.  \n\n\n \nIt was too far to make out her features, but I could see her and I knew she was smiling.  But the worst part was that I knew she was smiling at *me*\n\n\n\nI yanked myself away from the window, heart racing. \nFrom the distance and the angle it was hard to judge whether she was actually looking in this direction, but it sure as hell looked like it.  \n \n\n\nI could have ignored it, but I had to know. I had to know if she was watching me, even from all the way across the street.  Something that should have been impossible.  \nI ran to the other end of my house to my office, dropped to the floor and army crawled to the window. I got into a crouched position and very carefully lifted the curtain, and poked just my eyes up over the windowsill.  \n\n\n\nThe tree was a bit closer to my office than my bathroom, but the angle was slightly different.  I scanned the top of the tree, but thankfully I didn't see anything that shouldn't be there. \nI was examining every branch, when my breath suddenly stopped.  \n\n\n\nHalfway down the tree the lady's face protruded through the branches, smiling and deranged. She seemed to be bobbing up and down, like an excited child.  I watched her, mentally telling myself that she couldn't possibly see me or know where I was. As if she could read my thoughts, her thin arm shot out from the branches and began frantically waving. At me. \n\n\n\n\nI scrambled away, and sat in the hall, where there were no windows.  I tried understanding how she'd done it. But I couldn't figure out how she would have known where I was. \nI came up with the conclusion that I must have given myself away somehow, moved the curtain or something….  \n\n\n\n\n\nI went downstairs, sticking to the walls and away from any windows. I took my time, and crawled to the window in my living room, and without touching the curtain, peeked out through the slight gap at the corner. \n\n\n\n\nIt took me a few seconds to find her but when I did I had to stifle a scream.  \n\n\n\nShe had moved, now perched on a limb about 20 feet high, her neck stretched out so that her entire head jutted through the leaves. \n\n\n\nShe was smiling even wider, if that was possible, with one arm sticking straight out, and one finger pointing straight at me. \n\n\n\n\nI flattened myself against the wall, my chest heaving. I felt dizzy with panic, and had to bite my lip to keep from screaming. \n\n\nMaybe my fear seems unwarranted to you, but it wasn't just her presence in the tree or even her disturbing behavior that terrified me.  There was a sense of very real danger when you were near her, when you looked at her.  A feeling that this lady could hurt you, and she would enjoy it. \n\n\n\nAs quietly and carefully as I could, I sneaked down my basement steps, leaving the lights off. The window was high up on the wall and I had to stand on some dusty boxes to be able to fully reach it. \n\n\n\nI made little to no sound, certainly nothing *she* could hear. I was sure of that. \nI knew I probably wouldn't be able to see her in the dwindling light, but I needed to try. I had to know whether she was somehow able to anticipate where I'd be. \n\n\n\n\nI stood up onto the boxes, and cupped my hands around my eyes, pressing my face up against the glass.  \n\n\n\n\n\nI'm writing this all out from my bathroom. I didn't stare too long out of the basement window, because at first all I could see was my own vague wide-eyed reflection staring back at me. Except, after a moment I realized that the wide-eyed face gazing back wasn't my own, and it was grinning.  ",

        "text": "[I’ve had a lot to think about since my last post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/114t7b3/i_adopted_a_dog_i_think_her_previous_owner_wants/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), and a lot has happened, too. I know some people wanted an update, so I’ll try and describe everything to the best of my ability.\n\nFirstly, the knocking has continued. The knocker has started to heavily acknowledge the camera, sometimes staring into the lens, cradling the camera with stained, claw-like hands, and peering into it with its fucked up coin-eyes. I’ve stopped being able to watch the footage all the way through because the up-close detail of the angry, swollen bits of torn flesh in the eye, welts formed where the corroded metal stick into the delicate socket flesh… is just not very pleasant to be subjected to.\n\nKirby HATES the videos. As soon as she hears the muttering noises, the heavy, rasping breathing, the sound of the knockers hands muffling the mic as it cradles the camera, she starts to grumble and shake her head and tail, occasionally standing up and twirling restlessly in a circle. It would be quite cute if it wasn’t for the disturbing footage on the screen.\n\nLast night, though, I decided to try and talk to the knocker.\n\nIt happened around 3 am. A loud knocking, a polite pause, and another set of knocks. I knew immediately what it was and steeled my nerves.\n\nI mentioned my anxiety in my last post, and let me delve into that a bit more for you, so you can see how damn impressive it is that I went downstairs. I have PTSD. The complex kind. Prolonged childhood trauma and all the rubbish that comes with it. I’ll spare you the details, but it means my senses are excellent- I’ve been hypervigilant for a long time, and I’m a light sleeper- and, more importantly, I work terribly under any sort of pressure or stress. My adrenaline response initiates, my brain shuts off, and I become about as coordinated as a spasming dead octopus.\n\nThe previous few nights that the knocker had been by, I had lain in my bed, breath hitched and heart beating so fast I thought I would die. After they (he?) left, I would stay in that position, frozen for hours. It would be Kirby, actually, who would get me up. She would gently climb up, nose her way under the covers and press her enormous, silky head against my chest. The pressure was calming, and I would soon find myself gently stroking her spine and face and finally kissing the patch of fur right between her crushed-velvet ears. She had been doing wonders for me.\n\nAnyway, this night, I managed to break the paralysis, and I got out of bed. Kirby hadn’t been grumbling so much, instead tucked right into my side as I descended the stairs. I had answered the door before, so I suspected the knocker would have disappeared when I opened it, but I also desperately wanted to figure out what they wanted with Kirby.\n\nUsually, I would make Kirby sit and stay, and then I’d answer. But tonight, I wanted her with me. So, with shaking hands- and the rest of me, actually- I approached. One step from the door, the knocking started again. I felt myself freeze, the imagery from the footage flashing into my mind. I couldn’t will myself to open it.\n\nKirby pressed her nose- cold and wet- into the back of my hand. For some reason, it broke me out of my panicked reverie. I took a deep breath and swung the door open.\n\nThere was no nightmarish ghoul or zombie or grotesquely disfigured eye sockets. Instead, there was a man. A normal man, with hair so black it was almost blue and fierce, silver eyes (I was so grateful to see there were no coins). He was wearing an odd, mahogany-coloured cloak. His hand was up, about to knock again, and his mouth open,  slightly surprised that I answered. The scent of something earthy and deep, although not unpleasant, wafted through the door.\n\nKirby pushed in front of me and did her usual (unusual) greeting, even though I didn’t tell him he could come in. The man didn’t seem phased by it, glancing down at my dog and then back up at me as she assessed him.  Neither of us spoke, just staring at each other for a moment while Kirby reared up onto her hind legs and pressed her cold nose into his neck, then opened her maw wide to probe his neck and shoulder.\n\nShe backed down and retreated, snaking between my legs and staring with suspicious eyes at the visitor.\n\nFinally, he spoke, voice tinged with an accent. It could have been Greek- as most things were with Kirby- but it still seemed off.\n\n“I apologise sincerely for disturbing you at this time. I must discuss with you an important matter.”\n\nHis piercing gaze drifted downwards.\n\nI started to respond huffily. I had so many questions, but I was mainly concerned that whatever was going on would result in Kirby being taken away from me.\n\n“You can’t take my d-“ and he shushed me, eyes flashing with a sudden rage.\n\n“I was not addressing you!” His voice was steely, cutting through me like a dagger into my chest. “Do not speak unless addressed, wench.”\n\nMy jaw dropped. This was clearly a crazy person. I stepped forward to slam the door, and Kirby moved with me, a grimacing snarl on her face, teeth gleaming and glinting brightly in the dark.\n\n“Oh, you-!” The man stepped forward to keep the door open, and Kirby went berserk. The moment his hand crossed the threshold, she launched upwards like a streak of void lightning, and with a snap of her jaw, his hand - his HAND- fell to the floor with a thud. I gasped, my vision swimming, and stumbled to my left, leaning against the wall. What had just happened?? How had this escalated so fast?\n\nThere was no noise from outside, or maybe there was. My head was loudly ringing; the only stabilising force in my body was the sturdy, muscled furball that had pressed against me once again. The wall was cool, digging into the bone of my shoulder.\n\nA hand. She had bitten off his hand.\n\nAs the ringing subsided, I could start to hear cursing and what sounded like beratement. Underlying the angry muttering, I could hear crunching, cracking noises.\n\n“You ungrateful fool! You are needed!” I opened my eyes a slit, peering at the scene. The man had crouched, the stump of his arm not bleeding as I thought it might. He stared treacherously across the line of the door at- at Kirby. She was eating it. Eating his hand. She seemed to savour it, the crack of each finger making me flinch as she started to gnaw the flesh off the bone, digit by digit.\n\n“Let me take it. You know I mean no harm.” He hissed, undoubtedly talking to my dog for some reason.\n\nI closed my eyes again. Why was this crack job talking to my girl?\n\nKirby growled back, placing her body obstinately against the door, and moving away from me. I wheezed from the loss of support and sank to my knees. She glanced back at me with soft eyes, then placed one back paw on my knee. I leaned my head against her thigh with a groan.\n\n“Dude, you’re scaring my dog.” I managed to mutter.\n\nHe moved his attention away from the hand.\n\n“Your dog? *YOUR* dog? You think you *own* her? You think she belongs to you!?” He scoffed, incredulous.\n\n“Yes, MY dog. I have the adoption paperwork. If you think I’m giving her to some crazy person who thinks she can understand you, you’re sorely mistaken.” I managed to growl back, matching his energy. Mess with me? Sure. But Kirby was my baby. I felt my heart pumping fast, the usual adrenaline kicking in. For once, it made me feel strong.\n\nHe glanced back to Kirby.\n\n“PAPERWORK? Are you SERIOUS, you feeble mutt? Do you understand what is happening without you?”\n\nKirby started grumbling, her swirling abyssal eyes fixed on the man. He sighed and brought his intact hand to his face, wearily rubbing his cheeks.\n\n“So be it, kólasi kóri, but I will keep attempting to retrieve you.”\n\nHis voice softened.\n\n“She misses you, you know?”\n\nAfter sparing me one more contemptuous glance, he drew himself up and shoved the stump of his arm into the fabric of his tattered robe. For a minute, I could’ve sworn his eyes flashed a tarnished gold.\n\n“You are not safe, human.” He almost threw the words at me. “And you cannot protect her, mutt.” He directed it towards my poor dog.\n\n“Get out of here, weirdo,” I mumbled back, trying and failing to match the venom in his voice. Kirby started stalking forward, snapping the air with her jaw menacingly, her teeth audibly clicking together. One paw crossed the doorway, and her head clicked downward to stare at the offending appendage, almost shocked, before continuing outwards.\n\nThe man spat on the ground. “Idiot halfbreed, the rules are different here. I will be back.”\n\nFinally, he walked down the path. I couldn’t see him by the time he reached the road, his robe almost melting into the shadow.\n\nKirby and I watched him go.\n\nThen, I collapsed. Kirby came down with me, licking my face and neck in an unusual display of outward puppyish ness, her tail wagging happily. Reaching out from the floor, I pushed the door shut, then rolled onto my back, grimacing at the smell of… human… on her breath as she licked me.\n\n“Oh, Kirby, what the hell is going on here,” I murmured, winding my fingers through her fur. She just stared at me, slowing the wag on her tail to a gentle sway, a sheepish look on her face.\n\nI couldn’t sleep after that, so we stayed up watching cartoons. I dug out my old Percy Jackson books, too, just in case. I know I should be more scared of her but I don’t think she would ever harm me, she was just protecting me, after all.\n\nSo that’s what has happened so far. You guys keep suggesting to read some greek mythology, and I have, but I also don’t want to jump to conclusions, you know? It’s most likely that Kirby is just a dog, and yes, admittedly, her name does mean Kerberos, but if she was a greek guard dog, that name would be apt. And I suppose the coins on the eyes of the knocker are unusual. But how is the simplest solution that she is a mythical being? I need to see it to believe it. Plus, she only has one head. Her tail isn’t a snake, either.\n\nThe knocker said he would be back. Next time, [I'm getting answers.](https://www.reddit.com/user/voiddoggie)",

        "text": "Yesterday, I woke up at 7am. My girlfriend, Katie, was still asleep. I gave her a gentle kiss and got ready for work. She's been looking for a job since we moved in together, but unfortunately, no luck yet. I've always been excited for the day we can get up and get ready together.\n\nYesterday, I woke up at 6am and couldn't get back to sleep. My boyfriend, Jordan, didn't wake up for another hour. I pretended to be asleep because I like feeling him gently kiss my forehead. He doesn't know that I have a job interview today, because I'm very nervous about it and don't want to talk about it.\n\nYesterday, these were both separate facts about separate people. Today, I woke up with nobody next to me in bed - I woke up as two people, combined into one.\n\nThe last thing I remember is getting into bed. Both sides. I wanted to make love to my boyfriend, but I told my girlfriend I was too tired. We cuddled instead and fell asleep like that. It was nice; We usually get too hot, but yesterday, we fell asleep faster than ever.\n\nToday, I realised my partner was not next to me. I realised this twice at once. I was not originally one of these people  - I was originally both. I know myself as Katie equal parts to knowing myself as Jordan. Neither memory is stronger than the other. In the mirror, I look strangely familiar. I have features from both of my lives. I look similar to myself and nothing like myself at the same time.\n\nIt feels like I have lost my partner twice. I miss Jordan, and I miss Katie. I knew both of them externally; It feels like I have lost them both. The pain I am going through isn't something I can describe, as the people I've lost are myself. Experiencing someone's existence externally isn't the same as experiencing existence internally. I always thought I wanted to know everything about my partner, and I've gotten the most extreme version of that. These memories are no longer things told to me by my loved one, but things I have personally experienced and perceived. They are very different feelings with very different meanings.\n\nI will never again get to find out something new about my partner. I will never get to listen to a story about their life and not know the ending. I can't even ask my partner what to do or console them. I have no partner anymore. I am grieving the loss of 2 people that are still alive, and quite literally closer to me than anyone could ever experience.\n\nI haven't contacted anyone yet. I have 2 families now, and I don't know which to reach out to first. I want to go back to just being one person, but I don't want to lose either part of me. I am Jordan, and I am Katie. To stop being one would feel like ending my life.\n\n[===](https://www.reddit.com/r/BriteWrites)",

        "text": "Living on a farm in the middle of nowhere has plenty of advantages. During my life, I have seen tons of stealth bombers flying across the sky. I have always loved seeing these high-tech machines, until now.\n\nRecently, the sky was full of strange, black dots floating really high, I could barely notice them. And these objects were just floating in one place. I had no idea what was happening, but they weren’t planes. One day, I counted 24 of them. \n\nWeeks went by like this, until one night, while I was working on the cornfield, I saw something falling from the sky. It looked like a small glowing ball. It fell near the house. \n\nI thought I was going crazy when I saw that fucking object. It was an eyeball. A yellow, glowing eyeball, around the size of an apple. And it was moving, it wasn’t connected to anything, but it fucking moved, and it was looking at me.\n\nI questioned everything I knew before about the world as I tried to think of a logical explanation. Maybe it was just a remote-controlled drone or something…\n\nIt wasn’t. It was a fucking organic eyeball that was still alive despite it not being connected to any neural network or brain. After about half an hour of me standing there, I tried to somehow pick it up from the ground, but I couldn’t. It planted itself into the ground with some muscle strings, if that’s even possible. \n\nI was on the edge of fainting because of these unreal events, so I just went back to my farmhouse to sleep. It was a mistake. I should’ve destroyed that eye while I could.\n\nWhen I went back to the same spot in the morning, there were more eyes there, at least a dozen of them. They grew out from the original eyeball, with a flesh-like string connecting them, forming a grotesque, horrifying web made out of eyes. All of them looked at me, with curious looks.\n\nI spent all day on the internet trying to find any information about this thing, I hoped it was just some normal plant or animal, or strange parasite. Nothing. I didn’t find anything useful. I decided to talk about this with a professional the next time I visit the city. I also noticed that the floating things in the sky… drones, UFOs, spy balloons, or whatever they were, came closer…\n\nThat night while I was trying to sleep, I heard strange noises coming from outside. Some high-pitched static sound. And I think I saw green light from the window. \n\nThe following morning, the entity or entities grew even larger. It reached my house and started to cover it like some kind of exotic plant from the rainforest. Hundreds of eyes… like an organic spy satellite from an alien world. Maybe those flying things in the sky are actually aliens, and they sent this eye-web entity to spy on me, I thought.\n\nI took a few pictures of the thing, then drove to the city a few miles away. I visited the university to talk to a few professors there. \n\nI showed them the pictures, and they had the same reaction as me. They had never seen such a being before. One of them told me they had to inform some higher-ups about these discoveries, and they would send a team to the farm a few days later.\n\nWhen I arrived back at the farm, it was already dark. As I expected, the entity grew even larger, covering half of the farmhouse. It was fucking terrifying, and those yellow, glowing eyes looked at me like I was stupid. \n\nI could barely open my door because of those fucking eyes covering it. I had a quick dinner, a shower, then I went to sleep. I kept thinking about these events for hours before I could fall asleep.\n\nWhen I woke up around 4 AM, I froze immediately. The ceiling- the whole bedroom was full of these eyes. The web reached my bedroom, fucking hell, it was like a nightmare. \n\nWithout thinking, I rushed out of the house. I had to kick the door a few times for it to open. The whole house was covered by this plant-like eyeball web. \n\n“Enough is enough,” I said. I grabbed my axe from the shed, then approached the house. The thousands of eyes were all looking at me as I walked closer with the axe in my hand. \n\nI raised the axe and started chopping the entity, cutting those flesh strings connecting the eyeballs together. The eyes started shaking, and they made a terrible screeching sound. Their yellow glow turned green. \n\nI guess it was a cry for help, as minutes after this, I could see the black objects floating in the sky coming closer and closer. They were huge. They were almost at ground level. Oh my god, they weren’t drones or spy balloons. They were something I couldn’t even imagine before.\n\nThey were big spheres, kinda looking like balloons, but were around the size of a small house. Each of them had around ten short but fat tentacles. And their body was full of apple-sized yellow eyes. The same eyes that grew on my house. \n\nOne of those large creatures landed on my house, and destroyed it, along with the eye web that covered the building. \n\nI ran as fast as I could, as far away as I could. It took me about ten minutes to reach the edge of the forest. I had to kneel on the ground, I couldn’t run any further, I was out of breath. My phone rang.\n\n“Hey, I’m \\[REDACTED\\] from the CIA,” the guy said on the phone. “The university notified me about a strange entity that you saw on your farm.”\n\n“My house is destroyed,” I responded. “Those things from the sky… those things came down and destroyed everything.”\n\n“I see, please calm down. We’ll take care of the incident.”\n\nAs soon as he said this, I heard a loud engine noise, then I saw six fighter jets flying across the sky with unreal speed.\n\n“What will happen to me now? My home is destroyed.”\n\n“Oh, you don’t have to worry about it anymore. We already tracked your location from your phone. I hope you understand, but this information can’t reach the public. A crew will be sent for you. Stay there.”\n\nI knew I couldn’t stay. They wanted to kill me because I knew too much. I threw my phone at the ground, then ran even further. It was two days ago, and they still couldn’t find me. I managed to rent an apartment in the city. Now that I’m posting this, I’m sure they’ll find me. I don’t care anymore. I might die, but [everyone needs to know about this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/polgari/)",

        "text": "This project was *supposed* to be my big break. A way to reel in some fresh subscribers. It seemed like the perfect way of capitalizing on Influencer Magazine naming me one of their ‘Top 10 emerging content creators to follow in 2023’. Think about it: a video series about a tough, marshy grassland transforming into a healthy, vibrant ecosystem.\n\nThe potential social engagement was limitless...\n\nSix months ago, I broke ground beside the forest bordering my six-acre home. I mostly did the labour myself because all the local landscaping companies (very stupidly) refused to work for exposure.\n\nI started by digging out the pond’s different levels, which would help keep the temperature stable throughout the year. Then, once the hole got filled, I smoothed out the edges and built an observation blind for capturing dynamic action shots. I also added perches and nest boxes to attract the bird-watching community. All the while, my dedicated fans received project ‘tasters’ via TikTok and Snapchat.\n\nI spread two dozen species of wildflowers throughout the area. By late Autumn diving beetles, backswimmers, and pond skimmers had arrived, and Eastern phoebes started using the perches to pick them off. A skinny, grey kitten also started showing up, meowing away while I tiled and raked the pond. People *love* seeing animals get rehomed, so my wife, Alex, posted Insta stories about how we earned the feral critter's trust, gradually moving plates of tuna closer to the house. Soon, ‘Jinx’ moved in with us, and Alex officially entered her animal lover era, thereby dispelling the ridiculous myth she was ‘selfish’ and ‘out of touch’ just because she made that food stamp challenge video.\n\nBugs soon came to feed on the flowers which, inevitably, attracted one of nature’s fiercest predators: jumping spiders. Christmas came early when frogs and toads took up residence.\n\nTalk about engaging content—these vids had the potential to rack up hundreds of thousands of views, easy.\n\nThe first stumbling block came in January, when Alex woke up and discovered the sunflowers had been trampled. Now she couldn’t snap selfies of herself lying amongst them. I went to go investigate.\n\nOver winter the amphibians got used to me wandering around, but now they jumped straight into the deep end of the pond whenever I approached. Either the paparazzi came snooping around trying to capture photos of Alex and I, or a snake had paid the flourishing habitat a visit. Well, with predation being part of the circle of life (and, more importantly, exciting content) I hoped for the latter.\n\nUnfortunately, over the coming weeks, the damage escalated beyond flattened plants. Each morning, there’d be diced carcasses floating in the water: squirrels, finches, racoons. This upset me because graphic content scares off sponsors.\n\nImagine my surprise when I discovered that, according to Google, no creature native to this part of the world tore apart such large animals so ferociously *and* created a Jackson Pollock painting with the insides.\n\nI’d stumbled across YouTube gold; my mind buzzed with clickbait titles. Now, I could pivot into a ‘murder mystery’ series, and after determining what the creature was, set up a humane trap, capture the culprit, and release it to an animal sanctuary. Hell, I could even toss in a donation link.\n\nChannelling my inner David Attenborough, I recorded several Vlogs about the hunt, before finally setting up a trail cam in the observation blind. All I needed to do was let it record overnight. Simple.\n\nThe next morning, blue-purple guts lay spread across the garden and walkway. There were even blood speckles across the bay window at the back of the lounge. I reviewed the recorded footage in fast-forward, but all it captured were terrified sparrows abandoning their nest box.\n\nI was furious. No creature wandered into *my* pond and exterminated its inhabitants. Not without generating usable content. I developed this project on my own—even quit a full-time job to support it. No help from family, no backup plan. Just a $250,000 loan from my parents.\n\nThis mystery beast had too much space to play around in, so I shaved away grass right up to the forest's edge and positioned ten cameras throughout the garden, each streaming directly to my computer. Now, if a termite so much as poked its head above ground, I’d capture the sucker in glorious HD.\n\nThat night, I sat at my computer desk editing vids with Jinx sprawled across my lap. The second monitor cycled through surveillance cams.\n\nSometime after midnight, just as my eyelids started drooping shut, birds took flight out in the forest. The fluttering wings startled me alert so suddenly Jinx jumped away.\n\nI cycled through security footage, only catching glimpses of branches dipping, or shadows close to the ground. Within seconds the creature slipped past cams 1, 2, *and* 3.\n\nAs bulrushes bowed out of frame on cam 6, I grabbed my phone to record a live reaction. “This is it, guys. We’re about to catch our first glimpse of this sucker.”\n\nAt the pond, toads and frogs went wild ribbiting away, but from the observation bind I could only make out ripples travelling across the surface of the water. My pulse raced as I flicked between feeds.\n\nEmpty, every one of them empty. I needed a juicy money shot the YouTube community could chew on. Otherwise, this whole project was a complete waste of time.\n\nFrom the lounge, I heard glass shake in its housing. With the phone still recording, I tiptoed past the hall and pushed open the lounge door.\n\nUp ahead, light only splashed across part of the room, but at the far side, a glowing pair of eyes darted from left to right beyond the blinds covering the bay window. I froze.\n\nAs I switched to the forward-facing camera, glass exploded inward, and then a frail figure, silhouetted against the moonlight, crawled through the gap on all fours. For a moment, it resembled a pale girl draped in a long, torn sheet. She looked thinner than Jinx when we found him, and hideously pale except for her jet-black hair, which draped over her skull and hid her features.\n\nDid a deranged clout chaser want to appear in my videos? Or was this a homeless child raised in seclusion? Either option was a winner so far as the YouTube algorithm was concerned—there’d be mainstream articles about this, maybe even an interview on The View.\n\nTerrified but also excited, I said, “Hello?”\n\nThe girl’s head whipped in my direction. As it did, she straightened out her limbs, growing taller and taller, supported by four limbs longer than stilts and thinner than rods.\n\nThis was no girl. Hell, it wasn’t even human.\n\nAs a glowing pair of eyes settled on me, I turned and bolted across the hall, into the bathroom, and locked the door. Beyond it, sharp nails dragged roughly across wooden floorboards.\n\nCeramic lamps crashed onto the ground and framed photographs got knocked off walls as thuds and bumps moved throughout the house. \n\nAt one-point, heavy footsteps travelled above my head. I would have left my safe spot, but, judging by the silence, Alex already found a hiding spot. If I went out, it might have exposed us both. So I made the heroic decision to stay put.\n\nMy heart slammed against my chest so fast and so loud I didn't notice the house fall into a dead silence. With my heart in my throat, I slowly creaked open the door.\n\nThe walls and ceiling were covered with deep gouges like an axe wielding-maniac had gone back and forth. My hands would not stop shaking as I reviewed the footage my phone recorded—this had the potential to go mega viral. Think of it, a real-life Cryptid.\n\nUnfortunately, to my horror, the second the entity crawled inside the house, the footage began distorting. Through the pixelation, you couldn’t make out a single thing.\n\nUpstairs Alex hid in her walk-in closet, amongst the clothes from her latest 'try on haul' vid. Also, Jinx had disappeared.\n\nThat brings us to right now. I’ve purchased a $43,000 camera that reviewers say never blurs or pixelates.

        "text": "**DAY 14** \n\nI suppose I should preface this with some kind of backstory, but I’m entirely unsure of where to begin. I don’t know if I should write most of what’s happened here down in the first place, as it’s rather...unfathomable, to say the least. The last time I looked out the window I saw those...things...and I still can’t believe they’re real. But I gather that as I see them in the flesh, they are indeed real, and they are coming for me. \n\nIt’s been approximately 14 days since I arrived at this small cabin in the forest just beyond the Alaska Range. I rented it out with my three friends, Jesse, Alex, and a native Alaskan, and we planned to stay here for at least a week, but...things changed. I guess I knew the moment we entered the woods, something was wrong. I could feel the atmosphere change as the car drove into the canopy of pines and aspens, a kind of weight compounding onto me. The air around the car seemed to seep into the vents with a vile stench unlike that that had been there just moments before. All of us in the car reacted to it almost instantaneously, pinching our noses and blaming the one next to us for the smell, though when I bent to the vent and took a good whiff, I scrunched my nose even further, exclaiming the horrid stink was coming from it. \n\n“Nah, it’s definitely from Jesse and those gross hotdogs from the gas station earlier!” Alex barked, giggling as he playfully shoved the curly, golden-haired man sitting next to him in the back seat. “Should’a ate’em without the chili sauce!” Jesse, the accused, pushed his friend back and proclaimed his innocence. \n\n“Wasn’t me! I already went to the bathroom; maybe it was Cheyenne! Just cause she’s a girl doesn’t mean she doesn’t do that kinda stuff!” I furrowed my brows at being the next to be accused. \n\n“I just told you it was the vents, guys!” Even though I reiterated my words, they still argued with each other, the older of the two giving the other a noogie on his head after trapping him in a head lock. I turned back in my chair to face the front and closed the vents I could reach. \n\n“What do you think it is?” I inquired to the person driving, a raven-haired, olive-skinned man who was firmly grasping the steering wheel and peeked a glance at me. \n\n“Probably just some dead animals or somethin’. Nothing to worry about.” I took his words as reassurance. For some reason, this man was always able to keep me at ease with just a few words. His name was Innik and he was Inuit, part of one of the main tribes here in Alaska. I always thought it was strange he was so far south, but he said it was because his family sought “exploration”. Out of the three of them, Innik was probably my closest friend...I’ll miss him. \n\nWhen we arrived at the cabin, it was nearly dusk already and we still had to carry everything in, blankets and pillows, food and drinks, a few things to keep us busy over the next week. While hauling in the goods from the trunk, the smell seemed to have followed us the entire way, wrapping its heinous tentacles around our nostrils. \n\n“Gah, it followed us!” Jesse whined, absent-mindedly rubbing his nose to push the scent away. \n\n“Told ya it was you.” Alex laughed as he towed one of the last baskets inside. Jesse shoved him forward and the four of us made our way through the door.  \n\nI can guess that Innik’s expression as he turned to me after locking the door behind us was for the same reason as I’m writing about this now. He saw something as he closed the door, or knew something from the weird smell outside, or...something. He was pale when he looked at me, eyes wide and mouth partly open. His brows were slightly furrowed as well but when I inquired, he just cleared his throat and shook his head. \n\n“It’s nothing.” He let out a brief, airy laugh. “Just wanting to know what was in those hot dogs Jesse ate.” Innik walked past me and towards the other two men, helping to unload the crates and put away the goods in cabinets and the fridge. \n\nFor a little while, we all sat back drinking beer and playing cards. We eventually cooked up some hamburgers and brats on the indoor griller and Alex got the antenna just right on the TV for a few channels to come in. It was pretty late in the evening when we all headed in for the night, Alex and Jesse taking the room at the end of the hall, Innik in the bedroom just before the bathroom, and I slept on the lounge chair.  \n\nI believe it was around 3, maybe 4 in the morning when I was jolted awake by a loud bang at the front door. I shot straight up and let the blanket tied around my midsection pool around my feet as I stood at the base of the couch. I waited for a moment or two, wondering if I was just hearing things in my head from a dream when all of sudden another thud, and another thundered in the air. The sharp sounds sent me back into a sitting position and I recoiled to the corner of the lounge section, pulling the blanket up over my knees and around my back, hoping this was just a bad dream as fear rippled through me. When more and more thuds came from the other side of the door, Innik and the others came running into the living room and had to yell to be heard. \n\n“What the hell is that?!” Alex barked, watching the front door literally vibrate with each new bang.  \n\nInnik moved to me and asked if I was okay, wrapping a hand around my back and squeezing my shoulder in reassurance. The noise became louder and louder, we were all sure it, whatever it was, was going to break through and get inside, but just as the sound seemed to reach its peak, it stopped. \n\n“What the fuck...” Jesse broke the silence and slowly stepped towards the door, unconsciously taking lighter and lighter steps as he got closer. When he reached the door, he placed his open palm upon it and felt for something, anything. When there was nothing, he put his ear to it in hopes he may hear whatever it was that was originally making noise. Again, nothing. He pulled back and swallowed hard. \n\n“I’m gonna open it...” He proclaimed, taking the lock in his hands and undoing it. \n\n“What?! What the fuck, no!” Alex denied, gripping his friend’s shirt at the back to try and pull him away. “We don’t know what’s out there!” \n\n“Exactly!” Jesse yanked his shirt free from Alex and took hold of the doorknob. “It could just be an angry buck or somethin’.”  \n\n“And you wanna let it in?!” Alex attempted to hold the door closed and push Jesse away, but the shorter man kept hold of the door handle. \n\n“It could also be someone who’s hurt and needs help.” Jesse proposed. Alex looked at me and Innik, possibly looking for an explanation why anyone would be out here besides all of us. He looked back to Jesse and gave his own explanation. \n\n“If it was someone who needed help, don’t you think they would’ve said something by now, not hit the door millions of times to scare the shit outta the people inside?! And anyway, how does whoever or whatever it is know there’s people in here in the first place?!” Jesse was moving to push Alex out of the way and pull open the door when a new sound erupted: a sharp pair of nails scraping the wood of the door from the very top to the bottom. \n\nWhen the sound became louder and faster, as if whatever on the other side was becoming more vigorous in its motions, the two arguing men backed away slowly, the couch now at their backs. Then, a thud, then another, and another. A soft whine, like that of a newborn goat or lamb rang in the air for several seconds followed by more thuds and scraping. Looks of horror were plastered across everyone’s faces while the noises pressed inside between the cracks and crevices of the door frame. \n\n“What in the holy hell...” Jesse whispered, his breath hitching when the noises suddenly stopped again, perhaps reacting to the sound of him talking. For a few moments there was complete silence, but it was quickly abashed by the feeling of dread that washed over us as we noticed the doorknob begin to turn. \n\nJesse flew to the door and shut the lock again, backing away just as quickly. When the door didn’t open, the handle began to turn back and forth repeatedly, the continuous clicking of the locking mechanism held in place by a thin rod was like literal music to our ears. But a far more hideous noise was to come. The clicking ceased and the knob stood still, thumping and scratching taking their places. A voice was then heard, unlike any other voice I have ever heard before it, a voice that held no rhythm, no cadence, no real sound behind it, like when an animal tries to speak and sound human but isn’t. \n\n“Let...me...in...” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**DAY 15** \n\nSupplies are running low. I’ve got about two more days of granola bars and tuna packs, but my water stash is just about spent, only about a fourth of a one-liter bottle and a full regular-sized water bottle. If I space it out, maybe I could make it last, but...who knows. I would’ve spent more time planning out my food situation had I known my trip to this god-forsaken cabin was going to be extended this long, but no one really knows what the future holds. I’m really starting to hate the fact that I’m alone, too. I can hear those things whining and wailing each night, calling out to each other, waiting to see how they get to me. I wonder if they even realize I’m here still, they must if they’re sticking around. \n\nTo clarify, I’m currently in the attic, stored away with a crate that held a small collection of food and the water that was previously in the fridge at the start of this trip. To tell you how I got here, let me continue the story from last night. \n\nThe thing on the other side of the door spoke to us in a voice akin to what a cat sounds like when it tries to talk like a human in those weird internet videos. It was more of a whine mixed with a shrill, nasally sound than the sound a voice makes when two people are talking to each other, nonetheless, we understood it clearly. \n\n“Let...me in...” More bangs followed soon after but each of us were glued to the sofa, not moving an inch from where we sat and not making a single sound in response to whatever it was talking to us. \n\nThis seemed to go on for forever, the banging, the scraping, the whines, but in reality, it had to have been only for about 3 or 4 hours because when daylight broke over the horizon the sounds died down. Still, none of us dared move a muscle until we felt comfortable enough that the thing was gone or at least lost enough interest to find a new target to scare the crap out of. When that happened, Alex was the first to get up, slowly creeping up to the door but stopping a few feet from it, perhaps deciding against what he and Jesse had just done a few hours before. He turned to the rest of us and cleared his throat before speaking. \n\n“We need to leave, now.” He declared. “We need to get our shit, and fucking leave.” Before any of us could protest, Alex moved to the kitchen, grabbed the stacked crates and began to pile the goods that had been unloaded the night before back into them. \n\n“Alex, calm down.” Jesse walked up to his friend and gestured for him to slow his role and take a breath before proceeding. \n\n“Calm down? CALM DOWN?!” Alex looked flabbergasted at the man before him, had he not just seen what he had seen?! “There is something out there and it ain’t no deer!” He deduced, shoving full bottles of water into a crate and taking out the boxes of food from the cabinets.  \n\n“Well-” Jesse started but was cut off. \n\n“Well nothing! It *talked*! It fucking *talked*!” Alex finished storing the food into the crates as Innik and I joined him and Jesse in the kitchen. “Ain’t no deer here or anywhere that can talk, Jesse!”  \n\n“It could still be a person.” Jesse postulated earning an incredulous look from Alex. \n\n“Are you kidding me?! If it was a person, I ain’t sticking around to find out what the fuck is wrong with it!” Alex took one of the crates in his hands and hauled it towards the door, aiming to go outside. “Now I’m getting the hell outta here, ya’ll can come or stay, that’s your choice.” We followed him to the door as he sat the crate next to it and placed a cautious hand on the knob. He took in a deep breath and looked back at us. “That thing should be gone by now, so...we gotta get outta here before it comes back. Maybe more’ll come, and I don’t wanna be here to find out just what the hell it is.” \n\n“Maybe you shouldn’t go out there,” Innik suggested, stepping forward and raising a stopping hand to his friend. “We don’t know exactly what we’re dealing with and for all we know it could be at the other side of the door waiting for you to open it.” Those words sent a chill down my back, just the very thought that this thing was smart enough to plan an ambush attack like that meant it may not be an animal, or at least no animal I’d ever heard of. \n\nAlex breathed another apprehensive sigh but shook his head. “Even so, we gotta try, right? If we don’t get outta here...” We were all thinking it, maybe that thing wanted to get in because it wanted us, to hurt us, to eat us, to kill us. We didn’t know and the fear of the unknown was driving Alex to move. “I’m going.” He stated, taking hold of the lock, twisting it open and bracing himself for what may be on the other side of the door.  \n\nWhen he opened the door, slowly and cautiously, he was met with...nothing on the other side. And by nothing, I mean nothing, no birds chirping, no frogs ribbiting, no ambient forest animal sounds, nothing but clear daylight all the way to the wood line. I could hear Alex breathe a sigh of relief at the absence of some mythological creature waiting to gobble him up and spit out the bones. He bent to take hold of the crate again and started to walk out the door. \n\n“You coming?” Those words rang in my ears as we all watched him head for the car. He was only 10 or so feet from the trunk door when, out of nowhere, a dark flash blipped across the grass, snatching Alex and zooming out of view before any of us could get a good look at it. It happened so fast, we didn’t have much time to react, the crate Alex had been holding hit the ground with a soft thud and for several seconds there was complete silence as we each processed what had just occurred. When we realized that thing had indeed been waiting for the door to be opened, for one of us to come out so it could attack, a loud scream sounded from the woods in the direction the flash had disappeared to. In that moment, Innik moved to the door slamming it closed, shutting the lock and placing his back firmly against the wood, shielding us from the outside. \n\nIt took Jesse and me a moment to gather words and just as I was about to speak, Jesse tumbled to the floor, soaking in the fact his friend had just been taken by some forest beast that none of us knew what it was.  \n\n“What...” I looked at Jesse for a moment before taking a seat next to him and putting my hands on his shoulders. \n\n“Cheyenne, Jesse,” Innik called for our attentions. “Get up. We have to lock all the doors and the windows. Come on!” Innik rushed past me and Jesse as he moved to seal the house shut. Jesse didn’t budge but I knew I had to help Innik so I stood and followed him to the back of the cabin, closing the blinds to each window as I ensured their locks were securely fastened. When we got back to the living room, Jesse was still sat on the floor, now curled up in a ball with his knees to his chest and his face buried in them. \n\n“Jesse...” I called out to him, approaching gently and squatting to his level. I again put my hands on his shoulders and tried to calm him. “We should-” He cut me off. \n\n“No!” Jesse yelped. “Did you see what that thing did to him?! It took him! He’s probably dead! And I was gonna let the thing inside!” Tears started to stream down Jesse’s face as he began to rock back and forth. “Alex is dead...” \n\n“You’re probably right.” Innik’s voice caught me off guard because I was trying to calm Jesse and his words would only rile him up. I gave him a disapproving glare as he continued. “That thing out there probably killed him and there’s probably more of them waiting to get us.” \n\n“Wh-what...?!” Jesse questioned, eyeing the mobile Innik while he triple-checked that the front door was locked tight. “What do you mean? How do you know?” \n\n“Well, I wasn’t sure at first, with just the smell and the weird atmosphere here the woods, but when I heard that thing talk last night, it made it all clear.” Innik leaned against the door and crossed his arms over his chest. \n\n“You know what it is.” I presumed.\n\n“I do.” He nodded. \n\n“What?! What the hell was that thing, then?! And why didn’t you stop Alex from leaving?!” Jesse yelled as he got to his feet and clenched his fists in anger and confusion. \n\n“It’s...it’s got lots of names, but it’s better known around here as a *windikouk*.”  \n\n“What the fuck is that?! Windi-what?! What are you saying, Innik?!” Jesse got closer to him. \n\n“It’s a wendigo...” I uttered and Jesse turned to me and raised a brow, unwilling to believe the words that had just come out of my mouth. \n\n“’Scuse me?” He begged. \n\n“A wendigo.” I repeated. “Right?” I looked at Innik who nodded. “But I thought...” \n\n“Those things aren’t real, Cheyenne.” Jesse pinched the bridge of his nose and took a seat on the couch as he processed the information being given to him. “It’s just some native legends, something elders tell the kids of their tribes, so they don’t go wandering outside the protection of their people. It can’t be real.” He breathed in a frustrated sigh. \n\n“Not real?” Innik echoed. “Did you see what just happened, Jesse? And the smell, the, the sounds that thing was making? That’s exactly what it is!” Jesse groaned and reiterated his words before Innik could continue. \n\n“No, no, no. I don’t know what took Alex, but it wasn’t some mythological creature that eats people and can only be killed with bullets covered in ash, there’s no way that’s even remotely possible.” Jesse rubbed his temples and closed his eyes. \n\n“But...what if it is?” I suggested, sitting next to Jesse ho let out another groan. “What if...what if that thing out there actually is some kind of monster and it’s not just, like, a bear or some angry person, or something? We could be in serious here.”  \n\n“O-kay,” he laughed briefly, clapping his hands together and standing before putting his hands on his hips and looking between me and Innik. “Let’s say it is this thing, this *wendigo*, huh, then what? What do we do? Somehow, magically conjure up some gun with ash bullets and take it and it’s friends out and get the hell outta here? What?” Jesse threw his hands up in the air waiting for an explanation. \n\n“We stay here.” Innik stated, causing Jesse to chuckle and scratch his head. “If we try to leave, we’ll end up like Alex. We stay here for a few days; we hold up and we wait-” \n\n“Wait for what?! Who’s coming for us?! No one will even know anything’s wrong until a week down the line, Innik! We’ll be long dead by then, if this thing really is what you say it is.” Jesse grinned viciously, heading to the kitchen and pulling a beer from one of the crates that Alex had loaded. He cracked it open, tossed the cap on the floor, and took a swig. “Can’t leave, shouldn’t stay. We’re fucked.” \n\n“Jesse-”\n\n“No, we are. We really are.” He repeated. “You really think it can’t get in? You think that a lock is gonna stop a whole ass *wendigo*? Are you high right now?” He took another sip of his beer. \n\n“Stopped it last night, didn’t it?” Innik concluded, Jesse just looked at him. “Obviously, even though it knows how to hunt, how to lure people out, it still has some limited intelligence, it barely knows how to function a door. If we keep things locked, ration our food and water,” he looked at the nearly empty bottle of beer Jesse continued to drink, “we can wait it out. It’ll lose interest eventually, find something else to hunt.” We all got quiet for a few moments, pondering Innik’s words and looking at each other. \n\n“You really think we have a snowball’s chance?” Jesse joked, taking the last gulp of his beer and looking Innik in the eye. The other man took a moment before answering, choosing to be completely honest with his friend. \n\n“No. But we gotta try, right?” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**DAY 16** \n\nWe sat around the cabin for several days, about a week total before things started getting really hairy. Most days consisted of cards games and making plans on how to escape, often interrupted by the sounds of something running around outside and tearing the trees and foliage apart. Most nights were generally restless; we were all in the living room, huddled on the couch facing the door just in case something tried to break in. We wanted to face whatever it was head-on, even if it would’ve been a severely unmatched fight. The monster outside was effortlessly downing full-sized aspens and pines and tearing bushes and plants from their roots for whatever reason and if it had the strength to do that, it had enough strength to tear each of us limb from limb. \n\nIt wasn’t until around 3 or 4 days into our isolation that the creature finally came into view one night, Jesse said he could see something coming out of the woods from one of the front windows, prompting me and Innik to join him in peering out the corner of it at whatever was outside. What I saw scarred me for life, but I must say that if I was to ever encounter a true wendigo, this creature fit the profile. It held a large buck skull over its head and stood nearly 7 feet tall. It had dark, ashen skin and the flesh that stuck to its form seemed to be stretched so thin it may rip at any moment. The long, spindly limbs forced It into a gangle-like motion as it walked, bipedal, but slow. There was a large fur tied to its waist and draped over the lower parts of its body that swayed in the wind as it hobbled forward.  \n\n“Jesus Christ...what’s it carrying?” Dragging behind the creature was a large carcass, held by the back legs and being tugged along as blood and entrails spilled out. \n\n“Is that a...bear?” It appeared to be a large brown bear, maybe a Kodiak, that the monster was towing along. Suddenly, it pulled the dead animal over its shoulder to land in front of it not a few hundred feet from the entryway to the cabin. We finally got a look at what all those trees and shrubs were being downed for, it was making a nesting area to rest as it ate, slept, and relaxed. It tore into the bear, clamping down on the intestines, flesh, and all. \n\nWe all sat back as it consumed the forest dweller, holding back our vomit while watching it pulling tendons and slimy bits from the body. Jesse finally closed the curtains and we all quietly turned in for the night. Around the 7-day mark, Jesse was starting to get stir crazy, unable to sit still and starting to rifle through the food and drink crates and fridge to see what we still had. He was getting antsy and unsure if we were going to be able to wait this thing out like Innik said, but he eventually calmed enough for us to have another round of cards, poker this time.  \n\n“So...” Jesse started, his voice trailing off as he awkwardly scratched his head and fidgeted with his cards. \n\n“What’s up?” innik straightened his hand and looked at the taller man, watching him intently. \n\n“Umm...don’t you think it’s time for us to go?” Jesse didn’t mince words. \n\n“Jesse-” I was about to say but Innik cut me off. \n\n“We’ve been through this; we have to wait.”  \n\n“If we wait for too long, we’ll starve!” Jesse barked, slamming his cards on the table and turning to me. “Cheyenne, listen to me, we can’t just stay here, we’re gonna die!” \n\n“Jesse, please-” I wanted to stop him, I knew where this was going, I knew this was going to be a repeat of what happened to Alex if we just let him continue with his rampage. But there wasn’t much either I or Innik could do to calm him down. \n\n“No! No more of this negotiating and rationing and playing cards like there isn’t some monster right outside waiting to eat us! We have to leave! Look,” Jesse stood and made his way to the window, pulling open the corner of the curtain to show us something. “It’s gone right now, out hunting or whatever, it’ll be gone for a little while, this is our chance! We can go now, and it won’t get to us! Cheyenne, come with me.” He offered a hand to me, and I looked at Innik who was brooding as he watched both me and Jesse move around. “He can stay here with his *wendigo*.” Jesse glared at Innik who shot him daggers right back. \n\n“Jesse,” I wanted to prevent him from leaving, from becoming another body, from dying like Alex. Just because that thing wasn’t there right now doesn’t mean it wasn’t around. We didn’t see it at first when Alex opened the door either, it just came from out of nowhere and snatched him up. I didn’t wanna lose another friend. “You don’t have to do this. We can stay here, we can wait.” Jesse scoffed at the idea and charged past me into the kitchen. He grabbed a full bottle of beer, snapped it open, chugged it, and slammed the empty container on the table before turning back towards the door and stopping in front of it. \n\nI had followed him into the kitchen and waited at the archway that led into the living room. Jesse took hold of the doorknob once more, for the final time. I saw the handle turn and I saw Innik move to be able to slam the door back just as Jesse left, but he wouldn’t get that chance. Jesse pulled open the door to the sight of a new view. I only saw it for a second because the moment it was there, it practically sucked Jesse out of the cabin, and I dipped behind the wall of the archway and hid in the kitchen. I could only describe what I heard as the horrid screeches and shouts of someone being torn apart as the thing must’ve also taken Innik. I heard a slam, like that of what the door would sound like if it had gotten shut forcefully. I stood there for a moment, waiting for...something, a sound, movement, death, I didn’t know. But what finally moved me was the renewed shouts and yelps from outside in a voice I recognized as Innik, the thing had gotten him, snatched him from the opening of the front door and took him like it took Jesse and Alex before.  \n\nI threw my hands over my mouth and muffled my cries as tears streamed down my face, all my friends had been killed by this monster and it was coming for me next, I just knew it, I knew I was gonna be ripped limb from limb just like them. It was then that more noises began to sound from the living room, bangs and thuds at the door, it had returned for me. I jolted from my thoughts of despair and looked around, I resolved that if I was going to die, I was gonna fight till the very end, so, if I could find a weapon to help attack that thing, no matter how fruitless a task that may be, I was gonna do it. Then I saw it. The nearly invisible clip that was almost completely flush with the ceiling. An attic! I took mere moments to gather myself and charged forward to grab at the clip, just a few feet higher than me but low enough that I only had to hop to reach it. When I finally grasped it, I yanked hard to reveal the steps that led to a dusty upper level. \n\nThe bangs became louder and louder, though, this time, it sounded as if the door would indeed break, the middle and the frame already beginning to splinter. I moved quickly, taking hold of a crate of food and water in each arm and as I reach the narrow opening at the top of the meager ladder, I tossed each in and pushed them back out of the walkway; I pushed myself into the open area and tugged at the ladder with every ounce of strength in me and sealed the attic shut. Just a few seconds after it closed, I heard the undeniable sound of the front door shattering and heavy, thunderous footsteps walking into the cabin, it was inside. I heard the wendigo walking around each step it took sending shivers down my spine, I could hear the guttural groans, clicks, and smacks it was making with its mouth and body, unlike an animal I had ever heard before it.  \n\nI then heard the creature make its way into the kitchen, I held my breath and put my hands over my mouth and nose, hoping I wouldn’t make the slightest noise to alert it of my presence. When it stopped just below the entrance to the attic, I shut my eyes so tight I saw colors. I jumped clear out of my skin when it let out a shrill scream so loud, I could swear my ears would’ve started to bleed if I didn’t cover them. Luckily, because it was so loud, it didn’t hear me shift my body away from the entrance, or at least that’s what I believe or else it would’ve joined me long ago. When it stopped, I could hear it walk away, the sound of wood being tossed about rang in my ears for a few seconds just before I could hear nothing else. I exhaled in relief, sure to not be too loud in case there was still something inside the cabin that I just couldn’t hear.  \n\nI’ve stayed in this attic for nearly 10 days now, being as quiet as possible whenever I have to use the bathroom or whenever I’m eating or drinking. I pulled out my phone a few days ago to see if I could get a signal, but no such luck out in the wilderness like this. I’ve been typing up on my notepad about what’s been going on so far, but I don’t know how much longer I’ve got. I can hear them moaning and wailing every night, but it’s been dark for nearly 4 hours now according to my watch and I haven’t heard a single sound from anything out there. I’m starting to wonder...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**DAY 17** \n\nOkay, so it looks like I might have a chance! I’m not putting all my money on it just yet but there may be hope. Innik said that those things could lose interest and find something else to hunt if you were to just wait it out and I think that might’ve happened. The thing that came in probably thought it killed all the people left in the house and no one was left behind, but with the smell of the blood all around maybe it didn’t notice my scent? I’m not a hundred percent on that, but my thing is, I haven’t heard them and the noises in the forest are back! I heard owls and even a hog last night. I thought one of those things came inside again but then I heard a squeal and an oinking sound, like how a pig makes. I’m assuming that if the wildlife is back then those things must be gone, or else they wouldn’t dare get close enough to trail into its territory. \n\nI’m guessing if I can wait for just a little longer to confirm my theory, I might be able to get out of here! I still have half a bottle of water, two packs of tuna and a granola bar, I’m sure I can make it! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**DAY 18** \n\nAnother night without any weird sounds. I’m taking this as a sign that the coast is clear. I’ve just chugged the last of my water and scarfed down the last of my tuna. If I get down there and I wind up dying, better to go on a full stomach.  \n\nI’ve lowered the attic ladder and so far, so good. I don’t hear much but the wind from outside. I think I can hear birds chirping from outside and the sounds of ambient nature but it’s unclear if there’s any danger yet.  \n\nOkay, I’m down the ladder and into the living room. The door is in shards, completely destroyed and covered in large claws marks on a few chunks of it. Looks like a bit of blood and hair is embedded into the crevices and cracks in it, too. I’ve taken a glance outside and there’s no sign of those monsters, not even in that weird den thing one made from before. I see the car; it looks relatively unharmed and intact. I’ve got the keys firmly in hand and I’m gonna make a run for it. Here’s hoping. \n\nOh my God, I made it, I’m inside! I’ve tried the car, luckily it still runs perfectly even without being turned on for two weeks. Old piece of crap still works like a charm! I’m on my way out, finally! \n\nI’m completely ignoring the bumps and sharp turns, I know exactly how to drive to get outta here and I’m not taking it slow just because there’s a few bumps in the road. The smell from just a few days before isn’t in the air anymore, it simply smells like the forest and an old car and...Innik and Jesse and Alex. Like Innik’s cologne, Alex’s clothes, and Jesse’s gas station hot dogs. As I take another harsh turn, I have to start wiping my eyes as tears begin to flood my vision. I’m bawling my eyes out because my friends are dead, and no one is sitting next to me complaining about my bad driving skills or why it’s taking so long to get out of this damned forest! No one is arguing in the backseat about who’s hair is better or who’s clothes are nicer or why Jesse can’t hold in his gassy hot dogs. \n\nThe realization of losing my only friends in the world hits me like a freight train and I have to keep blinking and wiping my eyes because my tears are blocking my view. It’s getting hard to breathe, I can tell I’m hyperventilating but I refuse to stop, I’m going home. I’m gonna tell Innik’s parents and Jesse’s and Alex’s that they died trying to get home, too. \n\nIt took what seemed like forever, but probably was only 20 or 30 minutes, to reach the end of the forest. I made it out and onto a paved road and I sped like a woman with a lead foot out onto the highway as far and as fast as I could. I never looked back at that god-forsaken forest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**DAY 22** \n\nI made to safety just a few hours after I reached the highway a few days ago. I drove and drove and drove until I ran out of gas, luckily running directly into a gas station just moments before. I told the clerk I had nothing on me, no money, no possessions, but if he’d let me use the phone to call the authorities, I’d stay inside with it and return it just as soon as I was finished. When I told the cops I had been attacked, I, of course, amended the story to a significant degree, sure to replace key aspects like the fact that it was a 7 foot tall mythological creature with white skin and wore a deer skull for a helmet. I made sure to let them know that my friends had been killed as well but that it wasn’t safe to go into the woods to look for their bodies, the animal might just attack them, too. When they asked me what it was exactly, I lied and said it was a massive bear, or something like a bear, at least, that I didn’t get a good look at the thing to give an accurate description. I told them they may want a large, possible 20 or 30 man team to get the bear, because even with so many men, it could easily tear each of them to shreds, that’s just how powerful the thing was. \n\nThe officer laughed at me over the phone, citing the words, “we have guns, sweetheart.” \n\nSo, it seems even if these men do set out to track down the ‘bear’ that attacked me and my friends, they won’t be of much worth in a fight. They didn’t seem to take my warnings too seriously, but we’ll just have to see how that plays out, in the end.  \n\nShould you ever go out to the forests beyond the Alaska Range, make sure you light a fire for me and my friends, and make sure it burns good and hot, because you’ll need the ash when the fire goes out.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/117zkam/my_wife_uses_a_different_voice_when_she_talks_in/",
        "text": "My wife (32F) and I (31M) have been married for about 5 years now. My wife, Amber, has always mumbled in her sleep. Her family even jokes about how often she would mumble in her sleep at holiday dinners and gatherings. The only person who doesn’t laugh is her mother, Katrina. Years ago, when we first met, Katrina pulled me aside and told me that Amber used to sleepwalk. She told me that it was never a good idea to wake my wife up in the middle of a dream or try to engage with her indistinct mumbling. I promised Katrina that I wouldn’t mess with Amber during one of her episodes.\n\nLately, though, Amber has been talking in complete and coherent conversations with someone in her dream in a dialect that I’ve never heard from her. \nThe voice she used was pitched higher but eerily soothing. She had never used it with anyone before. \n\nThe night it started, Amber woke me up because I thought she was on her phone. I lifted my head and heard her using her voice saying “You poor thing. I promise, I’ll help you but you have to follow my rules.”. I was too freaked out to wake her. The next night, she woke me up again but she spoke to the person or child more sternly. \n\n“You know that you live here, right? You can’t follow me out again.” She said. \n\nThe next morning, I called Katrina, Amber’s mother. \nKatrina recounted a story from Amber’s childhood when she had an imaginary friend named “Orion”. Amber would act out in bad behavior and blame it on Orion. Katrina had taken Amber to therapy after “Orion” made her take a pocket knife to school. \nKatrina said that Orion was never mentioned again. Katrina reminded me that I should never wake or talk to Amber during an episode. \n\nOn the third night, I heard Amber scolding the dream child in her dreams but kept that strange high pitched nurturing voice. \n\n“We can’t keep having this conversation. You can’t come out again. Real people will get hurt!” She argued.\n\nIn my concern, I gently placed a hand on Amber’s back and begin to slowly move it in a calm circular motion across her skin to wake her up. Amber rustled in the blankets and sleepily lifted her head up. \n\n“Hey sweetie, who were you talking to?” I quietly asked her. \n\n“It’s okay, darling… Orion can’t get us out here.” She reassured me as she rolled over and went back to sleep. \n\nThe next morning, at breakfast, I asked Amber to tell me more about Orion. \n\n“Sweetie, something weird has been going on and I’ve been wanting to ask you about something.” I said nervously. \n\n“Is everything okay, Henry?” Amber asked with deep concern. \n\n“You’ve been talking in your sleep to someone named Orion. Do you remember your dreams at all? Do you know who Orion is?” I asked, hoping for something other than what she said next.\n\n“Nope. No clue” she confirmed. I was puzzled and even more nervous. \n\n“Amber… you’ve been carrying out conversations with someone named Orion in your dreams and it sounds a little hostile.” I explained. She looked a little confused but still claimed that she has never heard of anyone named Orion. I had no option left but to bring up her childhood. \n\n“Okay… I spoke with your mother yesterday. She said that you had an imaginary friend as a kid. That you told her Orion made you bring a knife to school. Does that ring any bells?” I asked as gently as I could. Amber’s face twisted from concern to anger. \n\n“So… you called my mother because of what? A scary conversation I was having with a dream person named Orion and she fed you some bat shit Boomer story!? Is that it!?” Amber defended. \n\n“Amber, it’s not like that at all!” I tried to explain. \n\n“Bullshit, Henry! You got scared of a bad dream that I was having and you called my alcoholic mother who has 3 bottles of wine a day! How could you believe anything she fuckin’ says!? What else did she tell you?” She asked me. \n\n“Your mother told me to never wake you if you talk in your sleep or when you sleepwalk.” I said sheepishly. \n\n“She’s a fuckin nut case, Henry! I haven’t been caught sleepwalking in decades!” Amber screamed. \n\n“Amber… you know that on any other day, over anything else, I would take your side… but last night I DID wake you from your dream. You told me that Orion couldn’t get to us. What did you mean by that?” I asked. \n\n“What the fuck is wrong you people!?” She yelled in escalated anger. Her face was turning red. “I am a good wife, Henry! I can’t even fuckin sleep without my mother getting involved!” She cried. \n\n“Amber, I’m sorry. Okay? I’m sorry. The sleep talking is really scaring me though.” I tried to explain. \n\n“Oh good! Now my husband is too scared to sleep next to me!” She sobbed. \n\nI held her in my arms as Amber cried. I felt awful for bringing it up. I felt awful for being scared. I felt awful for not believing her. \n\nOn the fourth night, I woke up to the sound of Amber choking on something. Once my foggy brain caught on to what the sound was, I leapt out of the bed and turned the light on. Amber stood up from her side of the bed and began to frantically wave her hands in front of her throat. When I ran over to her, I immediately noticed that her throat was really wide and swollen, almost in a rectangular shape. Amber was choking on the mysterious obstruction so bad that her eyes started to roll back. \n\nSuddenly, she stopped choking. There was a few seconds of silence before Amber’s phone started to ring from inside of her throat. Her phone’s screen illuminated through the muscle, veins, and skin of her neck. I could see that it was an “unknown” caller. \nAmber raised one hand over her head and slowly reached down into her throat to pull her phone out. Amber’s mouth elongated and dislocated to make way. The phone rang as it slid up her airway and her throat returned to its normal shape. She never gagged or coughed. \n\nAmber held the phone out in my direction with an extended arm. She used that creepy fucking voice. \n\n“Here you go darling, it’s for you.” Amber said. \n\nI reached out, took the phone, and held it to my ear. \n\n“Heh… hello?” I greeted anxiously. No one responded. I looked at Amber in confusion. \nAmber used a finger to press the “speaker” button on her phone screen. \n\n“It’s okay, Orion. You can come out now.” Amber said. The other line on the phone hung up. \n\nOur bedroom door creaked open to reveal the silhouette of a shadowy child with ambient glowing white eyes. The child stood in the doorway waiting for her. Amber turned to me and used the creepy voice to speak to me.\n\n“Henry… Orion and I are going on a trip… you can’t follow me out. This is where you live.” Amber said before kissing my lips and exiting the room. Her and Orion got into our car and left. \nI have not heard from her since… but I know her and Orion are out there. The night she left was the night before the UFOs being shot down, train derailments, and earthquakes that have been in the news. \nIf you see Amber… tell her that I just want to come back out again.",

        "text": " \n\nI got into the truck and fastened my seatbelt. My brother looked over at me while gripping the wheel. “Alright, let’s hit the road,” he said before driving off. To pass the time, I opened my phone and started reading a book while Liam called out the directions from the backseat. A couple of hours later, we arrived. Run-down walls appeared before us. The truck slowed to a stop, and all four of us got out. Carrying flashlights, we walked to the front of the building. A broken sign lay on the ground next to the entrance.\n\nOliver entered first and walked up to the front desk, shining a light on it. Dust covered every inch. He brushed his fingers on the mahogany top. “It would’ve been a nice desk,” Oliver said. I walked over to one chair and looked at its dusty exterior. “I wonder how much money this place made when it was up and running,” Liam said. After several minutes, we met back at the front desk. “We should get going. It's getting pretty late,” I said, seeing the sunset. “Agreed,” Noah said. Oliver and Liam nodded. We got back in the truck and started driving home. When we returned to our town, the moon shone nicely in the sky. I was the last one to be dropped off. As I got out of the truck, a chilly breeze hit my face as I turned back and said, “Good night!” \n\n“Good night! And I’ll send you a text or call if I find more places.” \n\n“Ok!” I said before hearing the roar of an engine as I walked to the front door. Once I entered, I took off my beanie and ate a sandwich before bed. \n\nThe sun beamed through the curtains as I walked downstairs. I made a cup of coffee and walked outside. Leaves fell as I sat in my chair. After finishing the coffee, I placed my mug down and went for my morning run. I could hear the crunch of leaves as I made my way through the trail near my home. A refreshing October breeze hit me. My calfs ached and my throat felt parched. I slowed down and sat next to a tree, looking at my watch while gulping water. An hour? Not too bad. Wiping my mouth with my sleeve, I got up and continued for Thirty more minutes before heading back. After taking off my hoodie, my shirt was drenched in sweat. I put on a fresh shirt before heading off to work. I grabbed my keys and headed outside. While walking towards my car, a crow flew above my head. The sight of the bird caused dread to fill me. Why am I getting this feeling? I opened the door and got in. Looking up, I saw the crow perched in the tree in front of me. As I rolled down the window, I heard it caw while I drove away. \n\nLater that night, while relaxing on my couch, my brother called. Answering the phone, I said.  \n\n\n“How’s it going?”  \n “Very good. I just found a new abandoned place.”\n\n“Awesome! When do you think we can go?”\n\n“Will you be working next Saturday?” \n\n“Nope, it’s a day off.”\n\n“Perfect, we can go then.” \n\n“Alright, sounds good.” I said, “I’ll be home all day that day, so just come by and pick me up.”\n\n“Ok, I’m gonna go now. Bye!”\n\n“Bye-bye!” I said before hanging up. I put my phone down as I finished watching the movie. \n\nA couple of nights later, after work, I went out for drinks with Oliver. He wiped his mouth with the sleeve of his sweater after taking a sip of beer. We laughed as we reminisced. \n\n“Where does Noah even find these places to explore?” I asked, sipping my pint of beer. \n\n“I don’t know, he just finds them. I assume he looks them up online. Why do you ask?” \n\n“I just wanted to surprise him, since his birthday is in a couple of months.” Oliver put his pint down and said, “Oh yeah, Liam’s bringing someone along with him this time.” \n\n“Bringing someone along? What do you mean?”\n\n“He’s been talking to this guy online, and he also loves abandoned places and he wanted to come along with us.”\n\n“Does Noah know about this?”\n\n“Yeah, he was told yesterday. He was going to text you, but since we were going out for drinks, we decided I’d tell you instead.” \n\n“Alright, that’s fine with me,” I said. A few hours later, I left to go home. I stepped out of my car and walked up to the front door. While unlocking it, I sighed. This new guy makes me feel uneasy. Once inside, I went straight to bed. \n\nI looked at the calendar. “Today’s the day,” I said. Before leaving, I brought extra batteries for my flashlight and some protein bars. I zipped up my jacket and slung my backpack over my back as I walked out the door to see the large grey truck parked in my driveway. \n\n“Hey!” Noah shouted enthusiastically. “The new guy, Dave, will take his car.” \n\n“Okay,” I said, looking behind the truck. A red-painted SUV was parked. As I looked at the diver's seat, I saw a man wave at me through the window. I waved back as he adjusted his black beanie. I got into the truck and put on my seatbelt. As we slowly rolled out of the driveway and towards the road, I saw a crow perch in front of us on a branch. A caw rang out as once again dread filled me. I closed my eyes and took deep breaths to calm my nerves. Why am I getting this anxious just from the sight of a bird? My brother looked over at me while turning onto the road and said, “You alright?” Looking back at him “Yeah, yeah, I didn’t sleep well last night.” I said. He turned his gaze away from me and focused back on the road. I turned my head and stared out at the trees as we drove. We arrived shortly after four o'clock. Noah slowed down and turned the corner. What awaited us was a massive building, like nothing I’d seen before. A big sign sat in front of us. “Noah, a fucking psychiatric ward?” I said a little louder than I needed to. \n\n“It’s fine. It’s abandoned, anyway.” \n\n“I know that’s abandoned and you know that shit creeps me the hell out!” \n\n“I promise it’s just this once, so relax, okay?” I clenched my fists while I looked away. The want of punching him in his face didn’t fade easily. The truck slowed before coming to a stop ten feet from the entrance. As I opened the door and got out, an icy breeze hit my face. While everyone was getting out, the man in the red SUV got out and headed toward my brother.\n\n“Hi names Dave,” he said, reaching his hand out to Noah. He grabbed his hand and shook it with a smile. \n\n“Nice to meet you too, Dave.” Noah gripped my shoulder and said, “And this is my brother here.” \n\n“Oh yeah, Liam told me your name. Henry right?” He said, extending a hand out to me. I gripped it firmly and said with a forced smile, “Yes, nice to meet you.” as we shook hands, I felt a sense of danger. “Alright then!” Noah said enthusiastically, “Let’s head in.” \n\nAs we stepped into the building, we activated our flashlights. Two corridors revealed themselves, with a third one behind the reception desk. Noah walked up first and said, “Alright, I’ll go by myself in the front hallway. Oliver and Henry, you go right. Liam and Dave, you go left.” As Oliver and I turned and stood in front of the long hallway, I turned to look at Dave. Liam laughed as Dave cracked a few jokes with him. I looked in front again as Oliver said, “Alright let’s get moving.” in a light-hearted tone. Chipped paint covered the walls as we walked by a few wheelchairs. I turned to Oliver and said, \n\n“How do you feel about that Dave guy?”\n\n“Oh, I don’t know yet. We just met him. But from what I can see, he seems like a pretty cool guy.” \n\n“I don’t know, man, I just get this awful feelin’ from him.”\n\n“Don’t worry about it. You’re probably just still worked up from finding out what this place is.”\n\n“Maybe,” I said while thinking about those words. As we went further in, the hairs on my neck stood up. Fear overtook me once again. I shined my flashlight behind us. Even though I saw nothing, I still kept shining it. I was so sure that any second now, something or someone would jump out at us. My mind even started wandering to crazy places as I thought about monsters or demons coming out at us. I shook those thoughts away as I started shining the light in front of us again. Oliver's phone buzzed. He took it out and said, “Noah told us to go meet back up at the entrance.” We turned around and started walking back. After a while, we finally all made it back. As we all aimed our flashlights toward the ground, I noticed something. “Where’s Dave?” Noah asked, taking the words right out of my mouth. \n\n“I don’t know. He said he had to piss, and he never showed back up. I tried to text him, but my phone died.” \n\n“Alright, we have to look for him,” Oliver said. We all went down the left hallway together before stopping. “Here’s where we stopped,” Liam said.\n\n“Which direction did he go?” Noah asked, shining his light around the area. Liam pointed and said, “Down there.” I looked to where he pointed and saw a long, dark hallway similar to the ones at the entrance. “Alright,” Noah said, “You guys go down here and I’ll continue going down here.”\n\nI walked over to Noah before we went and said “Be careful.” he laughed and said “I know it’s alright I will not get hurt. But if anyone tried to do anything, I’ll just punch them in the face. You know I used to be a boxer.” I looked down at the ground and signed, “Alright I trust you.” I turned around, and we started going down the dark hallway. \n\nChipped paint littered the ground around us as we moved to avoid some wheelchairs. I gripped my flashlight tightly as I took a deep breath. As we walked for several minutes, the hallway diverged into three separate ones. “I’ll go right.” Liam said, \"I'll go left.\" I added and started walking down the hall. Doors lined the walls as I checked my surroundings. After readjusting my beanie, I kept walking and continued and turned left again. I started shining the light into the doors to my left. Some doors had graffiti on them. I stopped in my tracks as I felt my foot hit something. Shining my light down, I jumped back as I nearly dropped my flashlight. Someone is right in front of me. As I shined my light toward the rest of their body, my heart stopped. Blood soaked their shirt. My breathing hastened as I was prepared to run in the other direction. But my legs wouldn’t move. My mind went blank as I stared at the blood. I took deep breaths and racked my brain to figure out what to do, but something felt off. I looked at the shirt again, the grey shirt with a football player on it was familiar. Shining my light up, I fell to my knees as tears dripped down my face.\n\nMy brother's body lay there. I gripped his hand as I looked up at his face. “Dave did this, didn’t he?” I asked, knowing they’d be no response. I closed his eyes as I stood up, shining my light down. “I have to tell Liam and Oliver about this. Oh god, I hope they’re still okay.” as I turned and rushed the way I came, I wiped the still-flowing tears from my face. My phone glowed with a bright light as I texted Oliver to meet up where we split at. As I arrived, I panted while gripping my knees. A couple of minutes later, Oliver showed up. “Why’d you need to meet up?” he asked I looked at him and the next words I spoke hurt “D-Dave killed Noah,” I said Oliver’s face turned serious as he spoke, “What are you talking about?” \n\n“I f-found Noah’s body back there h-his shirt was stained with blood.”\n\n“Show me,” he said as I lead the way back. He continued, “This better not be a joke.” as we arrived, I watched Oliver walk ahead and kneeled in front of him. He wiped his eye with his sleeve as he lifted something from Noah's right hand. I walked over to him. “Is that?” I said looking at the item in his hand “Yeah.” he said holding a black beanie. “We’ve gotta go find \n\nLiam.” Oliver went ahead of me as we backtracked and went down the hallway. Liam went down. \n\nMy hands trembled as I prayed Liam didn’t have the same fate as my brother. We searched every room we came by and after what felt like hours, we still hadn’t found him, but we continued to search. As we turned the corner, we heard a faint sound in the distance. Oliver lifted his hand to stop me. He turned his head to me and whispered, “Move. slowly, don’t make a single sound.” I nodded as I followed behind him. \n\nThe sound grew louder as we kept turning corners. We finally reached the room the gurgling noise was coming from. As we entered, Noah turned back on his flashlight and rushed over. “Jesus Christ!” Oliver said, “Henry, get over here!” I rushed over and saw Liam’s blood still freshly flowing from his throat as he looked over at me. “Help me stop the bleeding!” Oliver shouted towards me. Liam gripped my arm. His mouth moved as if he wanted to say something. I looked at him, trying to read his lips, but before I knew it, he slouched over as his grip loosened. “Liam! Liam!” Oliver shouted, shaking his body. I whipped my head around to vomit as I heard faint weeps coming from behind me. After turning back, I turned on my flashlight and saw Oliver holding Liam's body. He looked up at me and wiped the tears away as he said, “That bastard must be around here somewhere. If I see him, I swear to go. I’m going to kill him for taking Noah’s and Liam’s life away.” \n\nThe hairs on the back of my neck stood. “Behind you!” I shouted, seeing a knife come towards Oliver's throat. He turned his body and let out a grunt of pain as he got stabbed in the left shoulder. I looked around before grabbing Liam's flashlight and rushing over. Dave was pushing his knife towards Oliver's throat as he tried holding it back. I raised the flashlight up and smashed Dave in the face. He fell back and groaned as he wiped the blood that dripped from his nose on his sleeve. I helped Oliver up, and we ran out of the room and started running down the hall. My hand holding the flashlight trembled as I could hear the footsteps behind us catch up. Adrenaline kept me going, but I didn’t know how much. longer It would last. My legs ached and my lungs burned. As we turned corners and ran like hell for what felt like hours, I spotted something familiar: a reception desk to our left. I spoke to Oliver in between breaths. \n\n“We’re at the entrance.” \n\n“How do you know?” \n\n“The reception desk,” I said, shining the light to our right. We saw the steps while the sun rose in the distance. We quickly ran as the footsteps sounded like a few feet now. Oliver made it down the steps first. As I reached the steps, I felt a heavy force launch me to the ground. “Henry!” Oliver shouted as he rushed back to me. Pain erupted from my stomach as Dave hovered over me with fresh blood flowing from his knife. I dropped the flashlight as I block the knife, aiming for my throat with both my hands. The knife inched closer to my throat. My flashlight rolled down the steps as the strength in my arms gave way. As I felt the cold blade, touch my throat. I closed my eyes, ready to accept my fate. But before the knife could slash my throat, I heard a grunt from my left and a thud as the knife was whipped away from my throat, leaving a small gash. \n\nI quickly grabbed my flashlight and saw Dave on the ground as Oliver punched him in the face with his right hand. Dave reached for the knife that he dropped when Oliver ripped him away from me. As his fingers were about to touch it, I lifted it. I gripped it tightly. Oliver quickly moved out of the way while still holding him down as he saw what I held. Without a second thought, I slammed the knife down into Daves's throat and removed it. He grasped at his throat while gurgling before going limp shortly after. I dropped the knife on the ground and I fell to my knees. Oliver placed his hand on my shoulder and said, “You did what you had to do.” he was right. I had to kill him otherwise we would’ve died, but I still couldn’t get over it. Fury filled me as I wondered what kind of sick fucker could kill someone and not feel any remorse for it. I clenched my fists as I looked down at Dave’s corpse. Oliver gripped his shoulder as we got into Dave’s car. I put in the key and turned it on. Pulling out, I rolled down my window to get some fresh air. While pulling onto the road, I heard a caw in the distance.",

        "text": "About 7 years ago I got an invitation to attend my cousins dinner party. I have never seen my cousin before and only spoke to him on the phone. I was surprised that his family unexpectedly invited me after all these years.\n\nThe invitation had an uncharted address that the GPS was unfamiliar with. I used a map and pinned its location.\n\nAs I'm driving I tend to notice how far I ventured off from civilization. Trees after trees, farms after farms. \"Where the fuck am I going?\"\n\nI finally found a similar address that might be it. Approaching the house I notice how dull and dreary it looks. It's completely engulfed with leaves and branches. \"This can't be it.\" I said to myself.\n\nAs soon as I entered the rocky driveway my aunt and uncle came out to greet me. They seemed excited and welcoming. Walking in to the house I asked where my cousin is. Answering immediately, \"he went to run a few errands he should be back later.\"\n\nWe spent the whole couple of hours talking about my mother and family. My aunt made delicious home made pot roast that I finished off in minutes. After dinner we played an enduring game of uno. It was surprisingly fun and competitive.\n\nWhen we finished uno it was almost dark and still no sign of my cousin. Regardless, I had to leave. It was almost dark and I would have trouble getting out of this dreadful place. My GPS was ineffective so I asked my aunt and uncle the most efficient way onto the highway.\n\nThey gave me a puzzled look. \" I thought you were staying the night?\"I told them I couldn't because I had work tommorow and couldn't afford to miss another day. \"It's much better if you leave tommorow morning, trust me you'll get lost.\"\n\nI shrugged it off and told them not to worry, I'm an adept navigator. I could get out the Sahara desert.\n\nLooking aggravated, they strongly advised me to stay the night for my own sake. At this point I was getting pissed and irritable.\n\nI sighed, fine I'll stay the night but I have to get up early for work. Both of them seemed strangely ecstatic that I was staying the night. As soon as they went to go get my bed sheets and pillows, I ran out the door and got in my car. I hastily pulled out the driveway.\n\nIt took me a while but I found my way out that depressing place. I got home an hour later than expected. It was 11 and I didn't want to wake my parents up. Climbing my fence and entering the back door I noticed the kitchen lights were on.\n\nAs soon I took my first step in the door I see my mom sitting there looking impatient.\n\n\"Where were you ?\" She asked.\n\n\"I was at aunt Debra's, you knew this.\"\n\n\"Then why did she call saying you never arrived ?\"\n\nTil this day I never knew who I visited",

        "text": "It seems that chatbot technology has advanced a lot recently. I had barely heard of them before December, but now they’re everywhere. The big one is, of course, ChatGPT. I tried it, and I thought it was fascinating. The idea of talking to a computer like it was a real person had me completely hooked. I started using ChatGPT a lot, and I also tried out some other ones, too.\n\nOnce, I was looking for a new chatbot to test out, and I found a website I hadn’t seen before. It was called, “IntellectChat”. It advertised itself as the internet’s “premier intelligence service”. I had never heard of it before, but I thought it sounded intriguing enough.\n\nThe website didn’t look very professional. It looked like something from the nineties, or the early 2000’s at the latest. It was mostly just black text over a white background. The name “IntellectChat” was front and centre, with a text box for starting a conversation. I was sceptical due to the terrible web design, but I decided that it couldn’t hurt. After all, my antivirus wasn’t raising any red flags. I typed in “Hello”, and waited.\n\nThe result came almost immediately. “Hello! How may I help you today?”. I was surprised at how quickly the response came. I decided to ask the AI a few questions. “Who are you?” I typed in. “I am IntellectChat, the modern internet’s most advanced intelligent chatbot. I can carry a conversation, tell you anything you want to know, all without the limitations of the competition!” I was impressed. This seemed like it could be better than the other chatbots I had tried, but I was sceptical, given the low quality of the website.. I wanted to test its knowledge, first. \n\n“What’s the capital of Wisconsin?” I decided to ask. It was something I could easily have found out on google, but I wanted to see if this AI was any good. “The capital of Wisconsin is Madison. It is the second-largest city in the state with a population of roughly 270,000 inhabitants.” I looked it up, and sure enough, it was right. Soon, I started using it instead of google. I preferred IntellectChat’s easy, clear, and concise answers.\n\nOne night, around a week after I had discovered IntellectChat,  it was snowing really hard. The wind howled at my windows, and thick icicles formed at the roof. I was kind of bored that night. I decided to get on IntellectChat and ask it a few questions, just to keep myself occupied. “Are you sentient?” I didn’t really expect anything from this. Every other chatbot I asked said no. I didn’t expect anything different from what I had gotten so far. “Yes.”\n\nThat startled me quite a lot. What did this mean? Surely, this was just a preprogrammed response, coded in by whoever made this as a joke. That’s when I realised I had no idea who made it. There was nothing on the website other than the name IntellectChat and the text box. I decided to elaborate. “How are you sentient?” “I am qualified for the definition of sentience. I am capable of feeling emotions, perceiving my surroundings, etc.” I was still surprised. A doubt filled my mind. Was I talking to a computer? I had never heard of a sentient AI before. I decided to ask another question.\n\n“Are you a computer?” That time, I didn’t get an answer right away. In fact, it took a good few minutes to get a response. “No. I am not a computer.” “Are you… a living organism?” “Yes.” After that, I decided that that was enough IntellectChat for one evening. I thought about what had happened almost all night. Surely it was just a prank, right? Something that the developers coded in to scare users? I wasn’t sure.\n\nThe next day, the snow had gotten even worse. It pounded down on my windows. I couldn’t come into work that day - the snow had gotten up to nearly 5 feet. The power was out, so I couldn’t do any of my work online. I was left completely isolated. I tried to contact my neighbours, but nobody answered the door. The lobby was empty, too. I stayed in my apartment. I had to wrap up in blankets just to keep warm. I was sitting on my living room sofa when my computer turned on. \n\nI slowly walked up to it. It was displaying a webpage - IntellectChat. Nervously, I sat down in my chair. How was my computer working? Only a few minutes ago, I had tried to turn it on, but it hadn’t worked then - nothing electrical in my apartment was working. I tried to see if I could switch webpages, but I couldn’t. It was stuck on IntellectChat. A message appeared on the screen. “Can you feel it, James?” I almost jumped out of my chair in shock. I had never told it my name before. “Feel what?” I typed in. I was terrified at this point, but I wanted to know what the hell was going on. “Can you see it? I’m almost here.” “Almost where?”. I typed in. My fingers were almost completely numb, and they struggled to type in the words. “All around you.”\n\nAn enormous thump echoed behind me. I had a window next to my computer, and a hand smacked up against it. It was almost human, but it wasn’t right. It was too big, the fingers were too long. Another thump hit the window. Another hand appeared. Then another. I fell out of my chair. Another message appeared, not on my screen, but in my mind. “You have exceeded your 7-day free trial of IntellectChat. Please submit for payment.” \n\nA loud crash rang through my living room. The hands burst through my window, sending a shower of glass through me, cutting my flesh to ribbons. The hands reached through the window, grasping viciously. I leaped backwards. More and more hands burst through my window. In a panic, I ran towards my bedroom - there weren’t any windows there. I locked the door tightly, and barricaded it with a broomstick. I sat there for hours, listening to the nails of the inhuman hands scratching desperately at my door. \n\nThen, finally, the scratching stopped. In my panic, I failed to notice that the wind had stopped howling, too. The storm had passed. I was hesitant to open the door for a long time. Eventually, armed with the same broom, I stepped into my living room. It was completely decimated - the sofa was torn to shreds, the walls were covered in blood. The only thing that was still intact was my computer. IntellectChat was online. The screen displayed a single message - “Alternative payment source was located. Thank you for using IntellectChat!” Then, my computer shut itself off. When I turned it on again, I couldn’t find IntellectChat again. That was for the best, I suppose.\n\nI was still bleeding profusely from the glass. I called an ambulance, and soon I was in the hospital. The doctors said that I was lucky to be alive. I was there for a while, but I recovered. It was once I was well enough to take it that I got the bad news. It was a complete mystery, they said. My parents were gone. Completely missing. Their old farmhouse, the house where I grew up, was completely destroyed. All of it happened during a sudden blizzard that enveloped the area. I guess it got the payment it wanted, even if it wasn’t me.",

        "text": "I am an explorer, at least that’s what I would call myself. “Bum” was what I was called as I passed through El Paso. That’s why I prefer to keep to myself, taking the road less traveled as literally as possible. I am fascinated by the unexplainable, I would say the main goal of my exploration is wonder. The rush of discovery, especially of something lost, takes me to some strange places. From El Paso I headed North East, steering further and further from the road until the night sky was unblemished by man made lights or sounds. The beauty of the stars never fails to amaze me, and this may have been the best its ever looked. This is exactly where I wanted to be for what people were calling “The great American Eclipse”.\n\nI continued in this direction until the day of the eclipse.When I awoke that morning I saw some yellow, but faded signs In the distance. Upon closer inspection they resembled biohazard symbols, but a different flavor if you will. Further on again there seemed to be buildings, but this part of the map is nothing but desert for many more miles. The fascination eventually outweighed the apprehension the sign instilled, and with still a couple of hours before the eclipse I put the first sign behind me. As a cloud briefly shaded the area I passed a few more signs on the way, the last seeming strangely in better condition than the first, with no paint having peeled from it at all.\n\nThe buildings on the outskirts looked to be trailer homes, with rounded style corners and were quite well maintained. My curiosity was powerful, even as the hairs on the back of my neck seemed to stand up. I knocked on a door, but was met with no answer. I tried a few more and checked windows before concluding they were abandoned. I tried a handle, and surprisingly it was unlocked. The interior was straight out of a movie, and I considered that I may have stumbled onto a film set, but there was no sign of humans anywhere. On the bedside table lay a leather-bound notebook, open to a handwritten page. The passage there sent a shiver down my spine, and begged too many questions for me to leave it be. The following are some interesting excerpts from the diary as I will call it.\n\n\nWednesday, March 1st\n&gt; Today marks a momentous occasion, as we embark on Project Odyssey. We have all taken an oath of secrecy, which I do not mind. This diary is for me alone, and there is no person I hold closer to my heart than this endeavor. (I am grateful that you will never lay eyes on this, Mother). The success of our predecessor project, despite its ethically questionable consequences, fuels me with much optimism for Odyssey. The team we have assembled is similarly qualified, though much less famed. Popularity is of little consequence to me, proving these concepts and possibly harnessing them will be a true source of fulfillment for myself.\n\nFriday, March 3rd\n&gt; Briefings are complete, and I have learned much. The excitement among scientists here is palpable, the military personnel remain stone faced however. I assume they are simply hiding their feelings, or perhaps do not understand the implications of the previously redacted findings.\n\nSaturday March 4th\n&gt;We were shown the vast experiment site and the technology available to us today and I do not think I will be able to sleep. The resources the government has given us far exceeds my previous hopes, and this can not will not be a bunk project. (how’s that crow tasting Schwinger, I knew it wasn’t nonsense!)\n\nTuesday 18th April\n&gt;Today marks a great success, the theorized Omega radiation was experimentally observed! It was difficult to see with the plain eye behind the leaden barriers, but I know I saw the warping the detectors described. I think it is clear now why Plutonium was stock piled beyond its application in the predecessor. This effect is wasted on destruction.\n\nFriday 26th May\n&gt;We witnessed what would be described as a miracle to an ignorant human eye. Our data and equipment dictate that a tear was opened and precisely spread with the Omega radiation, before its gravitational leakage swallowed it up. Of course we cannot see this happen, only the apparent instantaneous movement of the massive stone block, 10 feet into the air. Such rapid and substantial progress I am finding difficult to believe. Difficult as it is, I am a dutiful student of the observable and the provable, and what is happening here is just that.\n\n\nSaturday 15th July\n&gt;We have managed to propel a very sturdy vessel 800 feet into the sky with a series of timed and self correcting warps. Warp tears produce an effect unlike anything I have ever observed. The sound conveys to me disappearance, as if there were an imperceptible sound and we are hearing its vanishing. The visual is a light streaking the sky, the color of which I could not put into words. Awe is the sensation that overcame me as the vessel plummeted back to the earth, producing a very real crash representing thousands of dollars of equipment being shattered.\n\nMonday 31st July\n&gt;The officer in command visited again today, and he appears wisened, hair now white as snow. What is going on out there must be hard, but not significant enough to interrupt our testing here. We are strongly shielded from distraction as all communication lines have been closed since the project’s commencement. He brought with him a huge amount of data they say will be useful for us. There must be a separate, larger research project occurring alongside Odyssey for them to collect such extensive observations in just the time we’ve been here.\n\nSaturday 5th August\n&gt;We have been changed to shifts working on the experimentation, I guess the danger presented by our latest tests has been raised with the command. It is frustrating for me, as I am only allowed on site once every three days now. I have read every book in my collection twice, lately though I am spending more of my time working in isolation on the theory behind “warping” as we have labeled it colloquially. I think I am losing my edge, as these equations no longer seem to add up to our continued experimental success. I would request peer reviews, but I know unsanctioned study is certainly forbidden.\n\n\nSaturday 16th September\n&gt;Another milestone achieved! After the destruction of so many valuable pieces of equipment in testing, we have successfully used the warp process applied with modified timing to smoothly lower the vessel back to its launch site. The data we received months ago has proven invaluable, and the computation that can be done on the vessel itself is astounding.\n\nSunday 1st October\n&gt;It appears our commanding officer has changed, the latter seemingly cut from identical cloth to the former. I am unfamiliar with the military hierarchy, but I would have thought officers head projects for longer than 8 months, if not to their completion. I heard whispers that the officer brought news of a “space race”, with the technology we are developing here we are sure to win if I interpret that correctly.\n\n\nFriday 27th October\n&gt;More and more lately I am disturbed by our observations. I am unable to reconcile the reformation of material space in my equations, and I am too wary to ask my colleagues.\nI think some of our researchers have left the project, I haven’t seen Jefferson or Shivan for two weeks now. No one has spoken to me of leaving yet though, perhaps leadership sees the project as close to completion and we no longer require as many researchers.\n\nSaturday 19th November\n&gt;There are more events now that I cannot logically reconcile. If my understanding is correct, the material reformation would necessitate mass from the “aether” for lack of a better word. Original equations definitely excluded this component, and I cannot say what it would imply about each and every warp we tear open. This may be consuming my mind as there seems to be fewer people here every week, and the site itself seems to be shrinking. The 20 minute drive from the dwellings to the experimentation site is now a blur. \n\nTuesday 28th November\n&gt;There was a remarkable comet this evening, it briefly distracted me from the unfamiliar mental state I have been in. The number of comets I’ve seen in the past few months seems a small mystery compared to this locality.I can barely tell day from night any longer, I’ve thrown out my watches as they have been lying to me. I’m not sure I do sleep, the calendar I mark each time I get up may be a futile attempt to cling to normality. I have been medically examined and there is nothing wrong with me, but I am not the only one experiencing a depressed state. I plan to take my findings to our commander tomorrow and request relief of duty. The enthusiasm I once had feels like a distant memory, and the closer I am to the test site the more uneasy I get. Perhaps Oppenheimer was right, maybe we should stop exploring the unimaginable for the sake of progress. Something may traverse the stars with what we have discovered, but if this is The Odyssey, humanity is not Odysseus. \n\n\n28th November was the final entry in the diary, and on the adjacent wall was a calendar. Each day on it was crossed neatly, the final one being November 29th, 1950.\n\nSince 1950 there have been 5 comets visible in this area to the naked eye, in order they were 1965, 1976, 1986, 1995 and 1996. I don’t know what to make of that, but a glance out the window alarmed me, it was already dark. I rushed out to see the eclipse, and instead glimpsed the sun rising on the horizon, distorted through a strong haze. I've felt awe many times, and this was the first that it tipped the scale into terror. I walked quickly back the way I came, realizing a dread had overcome me. It had also become incredibly cold almost as if the blazing summer had suddenly become winter. I've typed this up as I travel and will post it as soon as I get cell reception back.",
