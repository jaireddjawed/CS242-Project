The majority of people in the server racist (akin to 4chan) and there's somehow still thousands of members. It's ridiculous how this server is allowed to continue to exist on discord. Has anyone else had a similar experience?",

I mean not stuttering because the language is new to you and you have to think for a while to construct a good and understandable sentence but, stuttering in also your native language. I think it’s called “吃音症” (kitsuonshou) in JPN. I have a “speech-block” which prevents me from saying certain words (mostly words that starts with letter “B” “P” “W” and “vowels”, but also very very much on “K” “N” “S” “D” “T” and the impossible letter “R”). Notice that, those letters listed inside the parentheses are what mostly in Japanese words so I don’t really have the ability to hold a conversation. If i try to talk i’d be stuck in a block for 2-5 secs which is really awkward. it’s a severe stutter by the way and it’s much worse in Japanese.\n\nSo, to those who stutters here too (if there is) what kind of methods or techniques are u using to atleast hold a little JPN conversation? And what encourages you to learn Japanese more even with this “disability” that you have? ‘Cause i’m literally slowly losing more and more of my motivation for studying because of this.. i mean, what’s the point if you can’t speak the word in the end of the day? Just wanted to know. Thank you 😊",

He already has four massive arm &amp; leg sleeves covering his body and having misspelled Kanji added would be a real heartbreaker. We both love Japanese culture, and I was the one who gave him the idea for the tattoos he has now. He's my best friend and I want to make sure his next tattoo is just as cool as the ones he has now. **Please help me!** He's been asking me for advice for a week because I know more about Japanese culture than he does (took 4 years in high school), but this one is out of my area of knowledge. **どうもありがとう!**",

Language school - either Fukuoka (Meiji) or Tokyo (GenkiJACS). 2 weeks with homestay + 1 week travel after. I have done this before in Spain for 2-3 weeks at a time for Spanish and found that helpful and fun - but this was years ago before online options were available.\n\nThe main appeal of this is the homestay aspect and the chance to meet other students - but then I'm worried that the classes may be no more useful than just having a week of upping the pace on italki and self study.\n\n2. Travel for 3 weeks. This would be my 2nd trip (first trip was Tokyo to Hiroshima via Japan Alps) so was thinking Kyushu &amp; Shikoku. However - besides simple tourist/service industry interactions and going to izakaya I'm worried I wouldnt be able to meet people in wider situations (vs the homestay with language school - but then what if the host family aren't particularly sociable)?\n\nAs you can see there's quite a few competing confusing thoughts going on so any advice would be very welcome - thanks!",

Which in my case is a lot.  He majored in English in college, so he's fine at it.\n\n*  He made a custom lesson format just for me.  However, he has many stock lessons if you want that instead.  Basically when you sign up, you can choose what lesson type you want, and this teacher has \"custom\" lessons as a type.\n\n*  For one custom lesson, I wanted to read something and make sure I was understanding it.  So I uploaded pictures of what I wanted to read (pages from a book) to imgur.com and basically linked him it during the lesson.  He was able to help me with the tricky sentences.\n\n*  For speaking practice, he has a textbook which focuses on that.  You don't need to buy the textbook, he has a camera set up to zoom in on it and he does a screenshare.  He then goes through the speaking exercises with you.  I found this fun and also helpful.\n\n*  Before the lesson he makes smalltalk with you which is really good practice.  I got to say a lot of things about myself and hear a lot about him (he has had a fairly interesting life actually!)\n\n*  He has a teaching certificate, so he's not just an unaccredited tutor.  Though I'm sure many of those are stellar as well.\n\nIf interested PM me and I'll give you his iTalki profile and you can look at if you want to try it.\n\nTY",

I think I'm going at a very slow pace than what I wish I would be going at and I can't help but feel like I'm not using the right methods. My main question is, should I be learning kanji by just memorizing them? (which is what I have been doing so far) or should I learn the radicals and then use those? but I tried that and it didn't help very much, it made it more confusing lol. Or at least which kanji should I learn first or just where should I go from here? sorry if this is vague or a stupid question.",

In particular, there are many wonderful ways of thinking about the tea ceremony, so I would like to share it with everyone. Of course I also love anime and manga. I would like to study English and introduce Japan to everyone in an easy-to-understand way. So my stream is English study and Japanese language courses, and games.\n\nAs a personal goal, I aim to increase my understanding of English through Duolingo and fun and easy English games to help with reading and comprehension. I enjoy studying English with the help of people who come to see me. As a thank you, I decided to give back by teaching Japanese. I want to study together!  \n\nThank you for reading♪I am looking forward to seeing you.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/zhsvfz/why_you_shouldnt_rely_on_chatgpt_for_japanese/",
        "text": "There have been a number of posts referring to the use of ChatGPT as a resource for learning Japanese. It could be used as a resource, but there are a number of problems with doing so. It also helps if you understand what ChatGPT actually is and why it might give unreliable (yet convincing) answers.\n\n# What is it?\n\nThere are a few videos (linked below) that explain all this in much greater detail, but I'll try to summarize it for you. \n\nGPT is, at base, a language model. What's a language model? Well, unsurprisingly, it's a model of a language. Such a model has many uses, but one particular use that you'll probably be familiar with is the text prediction function on your phone's messaging apps. It takes a word or two that you've just typed and generates a selection of words that you might choose from for the next word. You can actually write an entire message by putting in a starting word and then continuously selecting one of the offered options. Doing this blindly will result in obvious nonsense because the language model available on your phone is limited by memory, processing power, data set size and algorithmic implementation. Despite this it is fundamentally the same kind of \"AI\" as GPT.\n\nGPT stands for \"Generative Pretrained Transformer\". 'Generative' in that it generates text to follow some input (like your phone's app does); 'Pretrained' in that it has gone through an intensive training phase to set the weights of its architecture (basically read a lot of language text from a data source - such as the internet - e.g. reddit, wikipedia, and other specialized data sets); 'Transformer' in that it's algorithmic approach uses the concept of 'attention' to what's come before - i.e. it can remember stuff that is in the original prompt and it's output so far and can use that to make better guesses at what to generate next.\n\nThe original GPT was quite small and only used 117 million parameters (the number of 'knobs' it can twiddle in it's 'brain' in order to improve it's abilities). As an indication of size, GPT-2 used 1.5 billion parameters and GPT-3 used 175 billion parameters (over 1000 times as many as GPT-1). In addition, the training data set size for each increased significantly - more data generally means more opportunities to learn.\n\nGPT can be further trained, or 'fine tuned' for specific tasks - e.g. the accuracy of a fictional story generating application has different requirements to that of a medical advice application. Outputs from the initial training can be further trained to meet specific quality responses with poor outputs effectively discarded. ChatGPT is essentially a version of GPT-3 that has been fine tuned to be good as a chatbot - i.e. good at generating it's part of a natural sounding conversation.\n\n# Problems\n\nAs you might imagine, given its parameter size and training data size, GPT-3 is quite an accomplished language model. ChatGPT is particularly good at producing fluent and convincing output. There are hazards for inappropriate use of ChatGPT however, that particularly apply to Japanese learning...\n\n* **A misalignment problem**. People asking for answers to questions expect a truthful answer - that is (normally) their goal. ChatGPT's goal is not specifically to provide accurate truthful answers - it's goal is to provide convincing responses to questions based on what it has already seen in the corpus of data on which it was trained. To see how this may cause issues, [watch this video](https://youtu.be/w65p_IIp6JY) (which doesn't specifically mention ChatGPT, but the issues are basically the same). So you can't tell whether or not you'll get a factual answer and the way you ask the question may get you a different answer.\n* **A gullibility problem**. As ChatGPT is fluent and can seemingly provide explanations for it's 'facts' it appears to be an expert. In addition, its fast responses can be interpreted by naive users as indication of established knowledge (because that's how people answer - if they already know something the response is quick). This can easily lead to people accepting answers because the answers look good and appear to come from an expert.\n* **A testability problem**. How do you know if the answer you get is correct - and correct in the context you asked it in? The data set used to train ChatGPT will contain more than factual answers to questions - it will include different valid answers based on context, misunderstandings and deliberate misinformation. ChatGPT is designed not to provide answers to things it doesn't know, but if it has seen an answer in it's training data then, as far as it's concerned, it \"knows\" an answer. People usually ask questions because they don't know the answer (or haven't found it elsewhere) so the problem of testability can be huge - especially for beginners in Japanese language learning who don't have a solid framework of the language that might otherwise flag the answer as flawed.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nI think that AI in general can be a very useful tool in learning Japanese - especially if that AI has been fine tuned to the task. However, users need to recognize the fundamental limitations of these tools and should always take answers from them as '*pending verification*' by some other means. AI can be useful as part of an investigation of an answer but great caution is needed particularly as AI systems become more and more fluent, human-like and convincing. \n\n# Further Information\n\nRobert Miles has done an informative series of videos on language models and GPT. Worth a watch for a greater understanding of the subject.\n\n* [AI Language Models and Transformers](https://youtu.be/rURRYI66E54). Basic stuff on what they are and how they work.\n* [Unicorn AI](https://youtu.be/89A4jGvaaKk). A story GPT-2 wrote about English speaking Unicorns. Shows the benefits of 'attention' in Transformers.\n* [GPT-3: An Even Bigger Language Model](https://youtu.be/_8yVOC4ciXc). Interesting stuff about GPT-3.",

When should I stop to take a note? How often? If anyone has solution, it would really help me and I would appreciate it.",

Maybe an audio version of Anki? At least until I have enough of a basis that I can start following along with the standard podcasts.",

I know that 新完全マスター is great, and have used it to study for N3, but I would like to know if you guys like it or have any other suggestions. I would also like to focus a bit more on reading than when I was preparing for N3, as I didn't find many materials at the time.\nAnyway, is a bit late where I'm from, so I'm sorry if I take same time to answer!\nよろしくお願いいたします!",

I wanted to use the 2k6k deck but the Problem is my first language is german and although I can speak, read and understand pretty much in English there will be definitely some words that I don’t understand and I know I can look them up but I won´t remember the meaning after only looking once. So, my question is if there is the 2k6k deck in German? The second problem is I already tried to learn with the 2k6k deck but I always tried to translate the vocabulary to german like I said earlier. My question is if it is better for me just to learn the meaning in English and not to translate it in my head.\n\nThank you for your opinions and your advice.",
