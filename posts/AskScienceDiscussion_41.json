Would it be possible using Gravitational Lensing or other phenomenon that I am not aware of, to look into a telescope and eventually see all the way back to earth?  Of course, this light would be much older so we would actually be looking at the past!\n\nI do not have the knowledge to figure out the arc of the light or anything to try to calculate this... But, if we had enough objects perfectly aligned... Could it work?  We know that black holes and other massive objects can bend the trajectory of light.  Some materials actually slow down light.  What if we found the perfect combination to peer back in time, say, 150M years?\n\nI guess the question really is... Would it be possible for light to bend or misdirect at such a degree that it would loop around back to earth.  Let's just assume that we have the optics that are strong enough to see it when it does.",

I like real science, applied in impossible ways.\n\nI've been thinking about Mercury and if you could solve the logistics of actually building a powerplant on Mercury, how would you go about making it work?\n\nHere's what I have so far.\n\nVery Hot, Very cold \\-173\\*C to 427\\*C, would anything we build be able to stand those temperatures long term and without human maintenance? considering Mercury would have no atmosphere aside from what is slowly being atomized by the sun, how does that affect what kind of machinery we can use?\n\nIt is highly unlikely any human will ever set foot on Mercury, so all infrastructure would need to be built remotely, could swarm a.i operate in such a way as to construct and or assemble an entire power facility? I'm thinking, firing these giant liquid snot\\-balls at mercury, the thick mucous membrane would harden under the heat of the sun while the machines within quickly assemble themselves and their maintenance facilities. Because nothing has been assembled, nothing breaks and the robots assemble themselves from thousand of pieces of modular equipment, like a beehive if bees could build themselves into whatever tool they needed. \n\nAnything built would need to be built to last forever, long\\-term maintenance is a burden we could not afford to take on for the future generations of humanity, electronics may not have the requisite lifespan, could we build a giant series of mirrors? Could we turn this light into something that is usefully transmissible to Earth? Is it just easier to get it straight from the Sun?\n\nAnyway, I'm not sure if this is going anywhere, I'm being purely speculative I'm just interested to hear if there's any interesting real science in the potential for building remotely on other celestial bodies.

Just give me some gentle encouragement and a reason to keep progressing.*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n-----\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI have always had my *'faith'* deeply routed in science to provide the answers - heck, I started the science club in my school because I was passionate about the subject!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLater, I pursued a degree in computer science and upon finishing was ready for the world to be my oyster.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI addition to science, I have always had a passion for the natural world - the natural world combined with science of course.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWith a degree in computer science and a passion for the natural world there was only one path to take; a path where by I could use my skills to focus on some of the major environmental issues today.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Wow, just think of the possibilities!*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNow, if you want to eradicate something - you focus on addressing the **root cause** right?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI started looking deeply into the root cause of a number of environmental problems:\n\n* Climate Change\n* Pollution\n* Waste\n* Resource Depletion\n* Loss of Habitat\n* Loss of Biodiversity\n* Ocean Acidification\n* Deforestation\n* Urban Sprawl\n* and so on\n* and so forth\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter careful analysis of the problems I could think of a number of solutions we could employ to mitigate these issues - and I saw they are in all cases already in progress - that's great!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHowever, I couldn't help but notice that using science to improve our technology was only really a means of mitigating the issue - it's not going to stop it from happening - so I dug deeper as I felt distressed that the solutions were not to eradicate the problem but only to alleviate some of the environmental strain. Even some of the solutions that could reverse the effects seemed a temporary solution - we'd have to return and redeploy the solution or a better one, time after time.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*It's rather like finding out you have a genetic predisposition to cancer and then being told by a doctor that you can reduce your risk by living a healthy lifestyle - yes, it's going to help, but you'll still have that looming dread that one day, eventually, the chances are it's going to get you.*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*So that's exactly what we're focusing on, we working on cures for all these diseases - yes, you'll still be expected to lead a healthy lifestyle - but finding the cure for those predisposed to the disease is what we strive for.*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBack to the environmental issues, *what's the root cause and how can we address this?* So, like I was saying, I dug deeper to look at the leading cause and more and more **I couldn't help but ignore the correlation between our technological advancements and our environmental woes**. More and more I'd search for scientific, technological solutions but more and more I'd question them, scrutinizing them, time after time realising that each solution was again no more than a mitigative one.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs time went on, I stopped trying to think of a cure but the environmental woes remained... I started to turn my focus onto the world around me, observing where we were going wrong.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**That's when it hit me**, **science and technology are not the problem** - yes, our usage of it correlates with our environmental woes - but the problem belied with people; our environmental problems (and some others) seem to all have the same root cause - **the root cause is our own greed and ignorance.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf that's the root cause, how do you even begin to address that? \n\n**I need to spread peace, love and appreciation of all life.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**So what, have I gone from scientist to hippy!?**",

The website will not be available after July 16, 2018.\n\nWill this have any sort of measurable impact on medicine and research? In some of the work that I do, I see it referenced somewhat often, so I feel like it has at least some utility. Is this going to be a big loss? If so, is anyone/anything planning to step up to fill the gap?\n\nI don’t have an agenda or anything. I’m genuinely curious to know if the website shutting down will mean anything or not.",

        "text": "I spent the better part of the morning writing up a hypothesis on how ADHD affects sensory perception as a laymen who was diagnosed almost two decades ago and have been researching as a hobby ever since.\n\nI am in no way a professional, nor do I consider my hypothesis as such or have any intention of trying to publish it professionaly. The hypothesis draws heavily from own experience and discussions I have had with medical professionals who specialize in the condition over the years. Beyond that it is my own speculation drawing from many different things I have read about the condition as well as other related topics. This is purely to advance my own understanding of the condition and the workings of the brain. \n\nI had intended to post it in the ADHD sub and ask for feedback and discussion as I have seen plenty of very intelligent people on there and a neurotypical individual wouldn't be able to give me feedback of the sort I am looking for unless they have an advanced understanding of such things. Considering that the condition is still a point of controversy in the medical field I imagine such feedback will be hard to find. However I was told that sub was not the place to have such a discussion. \n\nWhen I asked if there is a better sub to post it in I was told that I should do proper scientific testing instead of asking random people to validate my opinion. \n\nFor reasons that should be obvious I can't test it. It focuses on sensory perception and I have only my own to draw from and one person is far from conclusive.\n\n I am not affiliated with any scientific body so there is no possible way for me to test it, though I believe it could be tested with the right resources. As I will almost certainly never have the resources to do so my only option is to ask for feedback and discussion from people who have experience or an interest in such things. \n\nAt this point I don't know of any other place to do so and don't want to think I wasted all that time to not even get someone to point out how dumb I am if I'm wrong. I will never know either way on my own.\n\n",

If that's true, *how much* and *what kind* of an improvement are we talking about?\n\nAnother consideration is the \"entourage effect\" where marijuana advocates claim that CBD is more effective when consumed with THC (what that amount would be is still unknown) than when consumed alone.

The measurement is truncated to a defined last significant decimal place. This means that shown results will always be less than the actual measurement.\n\nTo counteract this discrepancy one can add the number 5 after the last shown digit. This will increase the accuracy by halving the average discrepancy when computing lots of numbers. Furthermore higher and lover values are possible which can cancel each other out resulting in even more accuracy. With both effects combined this method more than quartered the discrepancy between two scales of different precisions.\n\n**Materials and Methods**\n\nAn unknown quantity of saccharose was measured first with a Sartorius BP221S scale (3 decimal digits display) and then a Sartorius PT2100 scale (one decimal digit display). Another unknown quantity was added to the sample and again weighted on both scales. This was repeated for a total number of 20 weigh pairs.\n\nTo the less precise results of the Sartorius PT2100 scale a …5 was added (2,2 g becomes 2,25 g) resulting in 20 weigh triples.\n\nThe sum of the weights were regarded as the comparable result.\n\n**Results**\n\n[Results](https://imgur.com/a/9ExNizV)  \n\n(Summe = sum ; Mittelwert = average)\n\n**Discussion**\n\nThe sum of the more precise measurements of the Sartorius BP221S scale is the “truer” result and the sum of the second scale was modified with our method to successfully draw it to the truer value.\n\nThe average discrepancy per measurement was approximately halved from 0,0417 g to 0,0220 g.\n\nThe total difference of the sums was more than quartered from 0,8359 g to only 0,1641 g.\n\nThis improvement will not only occur in sums but in all forms of computation.\n\nWith our method the precision of any digital measurement device can be increased without the need for additional equipment.\n",

It’s strange and for as long as I can remember, my dreams have been in black and white. \n\nToday I took a nap and had a dream. I was hungry in it and wanted to get fried chicken so I started thinking of places to go, there’s a place in my dream I like eating at that serves fried chicken in a purple and black building. But it had closed down months ago (in a previous dream months ago) and I recalled this in my dream so I went to KFC instead. \n\nAll of my dreams, it’s like I’m living a second life. Not too many weird unnatural things happen. From time to time I might have a nightmare but for the most part it’s like I go to sleep and I have a second life.\n\nWondering if anyone here can explain this or can relate? \n",

        "text": "\nSo we had some electrical storms in the UK the last couple of days, the intensity of which we are not used to seeing in this country.\n\nYesterday I was watching TV with my daughter, and the storm was very close but I’m not sure if it was directly over us or not. I could not believe what happened next. My daughter let out a scream and shouted for me to run, and I saw a blue ball of electricity with sparks coming off it seem to move slowly in front of me before dying in a pop and a flash. We ran out then heard another, seemingly bigger pop along with another flash. When the storm had got further away I switched the power to the house off and went around switching all the plugs off (the tv was still fine by the way). I’ve since put the power back on but haven’t plugged anything in the living room back in.\n\nI’ve ordered a surge resistant extension for all the good that might do, but it’s just starting to sink in what could have happened and it’s quite frightening.\n\nCould this have been caused by a surge in electricity, or could it even have been ball lightening? The lights and TV flickered when it popped too.\n\nHappy to answer anything you might need to know, it’s all a bit of a blur though.\n\nOh and I did try calling the non emergency fire brigade but they were inundated with calls due to flooding so was never able to get the house checked but I checked it all myself and there were no fires/scotch marks or any sign of anything having happened.\n\nAny theories greatly appreciated and I hope this is the right sub to have asked!",

The atmospheric pressure is usually a couple of millibars different. I was wondering it would be possible to utilize the differential pressures to create a significant air flow to produce some form of work. ",
