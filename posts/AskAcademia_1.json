As I'm sure you know, the academic market is dire.\n\nI want to increase my chances of getting a TT position as much as possible.\n\nMy question is, what matters more: the stature and quality of the professor or the stature and quality or the major program?\n\nFor example, let's say one of the top professors in carribean literature is at a university which only recented added carribean lit as a major field in its broader lit phd program. Would working with that professor carry more, less or equal weight to a program that is historically strong in carribean lit as a major field?\n\nMerci pour votre aide",

The lab I currently work in is awesome and I really want to stay there. Right now, I'm completing a senior thesis, but was just told by the department that I could not be approved because I submitted my materials too late. I submitted everything mid-February, then again a few days ago because I never got a response from the department and wanted to make sure. Despite there not being an official deadline to submit those application materials, they're saying I turned in everything too late.\n\nI told my PI about this (he's my mentor/comittee chair) and he said that he could maybe make me a co author on a paper or two which is really really awesome. However, I feel like he and most others in the lab view me as an irresponsible shit head now, and I'm no longer sure if he'll let me stay for next year. I've been freaking out and have alreadt profusely apologized, what would any of y'all suggest I do to handle the situation? I've already applied to a few jobs as a back-up plan but probably won't get hired, my GPA is low and my current PI probably won't say nice things if I use him as a reference given my most recent fuck up.",

Currently, I have let the students work individually/together in small groups, and I come over and help when they raise their hand. So I don't actually do any teaching on the blackboard, because I find that the students work in different paces, and some like to do other exercises than the ones prescribed by the professor. \n\nThis approach has had the advantage of being flexible and intimate, imo. But I see how it might come across as a bit passive, or that it might make students do more work on their own. The idea has been to encourage independence while being available whenever they need a helping hand.\n\nShould I walk around and talk to the students more, even if they are concentrated working? Now I just sit and wait until somebody asks for help. Should I do more stuff on the blackboard? I have no experience with that, so I find it a bit intimidating. I'm not a shy person, but I can get nervous when I have to take charge of a room. \n\nAny advice on how to be a more active and engaging teacher would be appreciated.",

I'm posting about a situation that is a little unusual, but I hope you can bear with me and hopefully provide me with some much-needed guidance.\n\nI am incredibly fortunate to have received a scholarship that will cover my cost of attendance for all four years of college. The program will also give me a placement as a research assistant for all four years of undergrad. As someone who wants to go to grad school one day for clinical psychology, I recognize that this is an amazing opportunity and I want to make the most of it. \n\nFrom my understanding, students in this program have quite a bit of freedom when it comes to lab placements. A current student told me that professors are generally very happy to work with students in our program because we come fully funded, so our wages don't come out of the lab budget. The labs I'm interested in are studying topics like the environmental effects on internalizing disorders like anxiety and depression and possible interventions that would improve the mental health of students on campus.\n\nThe only thing that worries me is that I don't really have any first-hand knowledge of the research process. I don't have any family members who went to grad school or did research in college. Of course, ever since I found out I got the scholarship I've been reading all I can about research methods in psychology, experimental design, getting familiar with reading and writing research, and things like that. I understand that as a research assistant, and especially as a first-year student, I probably won't have any weighty responsibilities and there's probably not that much room for me to mess up. But I want to make the most of this experience and feel prepared by the time fall rolls around.\n\nWhat recommendations/advice do you wise folks have for me? I'll take anything I can get, book recs, online resources, even just words of encouragement. Thank you all so much!\n\nTL;DR I'm an incoming clinical psych major who will have placement as a research assistant for all four years of college.

The deadline has since passed 3 days ago (it's 5 months before the start of the conference) and they've answered they rejected the application due to the form.\n\n\nI've asked if it's possible for me to send in the form and still be considered but I think it's unlikely. I'm so angry at myself and I don't even know how to tell my supervisor.\n\n\nMostly venting here but does somebody know of any travel funds for PhD students in Europe?\nLuckily I haven't applied yet for the conference but I really want to know as covid totally ruined any such chance for me in the past 3 years.",

I am familiar with grounded theory and postqualitative research and thematic coding and such (at a beginner level), but as the theory is about the field of educating people to promote better information behaviour, delivering classes/interventions to evaluate it sounds like a must. But the problem would be the limited resources a PhD student seems to have access to, do not seem to suffice the purpose. Or maybe there are processes and methods of developing a robust theory that requires little resources?",

I don't have another career path waiting for me. I have a weekend job as a care worker and I really love art (my passion since I was a kid) - which is what I spend my time doing right now. I know I love my subject but have struggled to survive in academia. \n\nAm I just running away from something that is hard? Will I regret leaving as I have genuine love for my subject? Am I giving into fear by not overcoming this difficult challenge? Or am I making the right choice to prioritise my mental health? Even though I don't have a clear future or plans? \n\nPlease help :(",

        "text": "I got my degree in Mechanical Engineering a year ago from a UC School with a 3.5 GPA. My original plans were to go from undergrad straight to graduate school for a M.S and a PhD in Mechanical Engineering with focus in Dynamic Systems and Biomechanics.  I had a lot of issues that rose during undergrad when I started getting the hang of it (COVID/Major Depression//Issues I only have myself to blame) that derailed my ability to get high quality research work. Most of my work I have to show from undergrad is a single internship and a few projects. Most of the programs I have been looking into were the University of Washington, University of Michigan and various UC Schools in California, although some of them are a big reach at this point in terms of getting in and also affording them.  Its been a year since I graduated and in that time looked for work in the medical device industry and post bacc research positions since then but have had horrible luck. \n\nNow I'm shifting back into wanting to go to graduate school and academia as a whole. I've since worked on my depression and  the job market doesn't look like it is going to improve any time soon anyway. Most grad program applications i have been looking into for 2023 are done except University of Washington (top choice but cannot afford) and some state schools in California where I live. My only realistic option I can think of is to start an M.S. Program at a CSU school and then apply to for a PhD at my preferred schools in the future. This way I can get myself out of limbo, qualify myself again for most co-op programs and internships, and also gain more research experience I have a few universities in mind already that I am really starting to like.\n\nIs it worth going to a state school for an M.S. program if i eventually want to go for a PhD?  I personally don't mind that much going from a UC school to a CSU school especially if my only goal was to get a M.S. at first but I am worried it might look frowned upon when I eventually apply for PhD programs at research universities. I've also heard that doing an M.S at one school and then a PhD at another might cause matriculation issues and might have to retake courses from a previous M.S. program. Thoughts?",

It's interesting for me now since I am applying for PhDs.  And frankly, I am quite confused. I wonder if this is field dependent, or maybe it depends on the country or continent? Apart from the obvious fact that  a renown University looks good on the CV, I thought there was a lot of nuance to it. I am in Europe for context. I did my bachelor's in a totally peripheral, small and young University. I am still in touch with some people I studied with, I can see how their careers develop. Since there were some excellent labs, quite a few people I know who were  PhD students there when I studied, now work in decent institutions as postdocs or professors. Of course, this did not happen out of nowhere, there were some great specialists and infrastructure  but the whole place is small and private, not prestigious at all. Then I moved countries and did a masters in a big institution with traditions. But  PhD students were mostly miserable, forgotten by the institution, and the program did not seem to prepare for an academic career at all.\n\nSo now I am kind of confused. I see interesting offers, in European project for example, in places that are not top, and debate with myself if it would make sense to apply and give it a try. Because what if a diploma from there will close my door to an academic career forever?  On the other hand, a program with a good pay and  a bunch of interesting training and options to network sounds interesting.",

I have read the journal's policy and it accepts preprints. I have always been interested in open science practices, but I am a bit worried because I don't know any colleagues who have done it. In my country almost all journals are open access and few social researchers use preprints. \n\nI have some questions:\n\n* Do you think it is advisable to publish preprints in social sciences? I ask because it is still rare in the social sciences. \n* How do you think more established researchers view preprints? \n* Do you think social science publishers approve of this? Beyond publishers' discourses on support for these practices, do you think that publishers really have a favourable stance on preprints or is it just a discourse? \n* Do you think it may lead to reprisals? I don't think I benefit from being a young researcher from a developing country in the global south, so I don't want to accumulate new disadvantages.\n\nNote: I know there are other previous posts that address this question, but they are over two years old and I think it is an issue that may have changed in that time.",

        "text": "Hi Academia community,\n\nI am a part-time lecturer for an undergrad class at a university, I've been teaching for 4 years already. My class initially lived in a limbo, but in the last year was included as one of the classes needed to get a new minor, and since then it has gained popularity, and I, as a teacher, has gained popularity. Being one of the few experts on the area on the school, sometimes I get requests to help other professors, and the dean and the chair of the department where I teach seem to like me a lot. In the last few years too, part of the team that initially made me join the school has left, the chair that initially contacted me moved to another school, and the department has had a lot of changes. Also, my work situation had changed so much in the last year and a half and I am not longer feeling exciting about teaching, to the point I feel my teaching is getting affected. I am less engaged, and I take my students lack of interests more personal... I've taught this semester, probably one of my worst classes ever. \n\nAll these things, are making me feel I want to be out of academia... However I only teach one class a week, once a year. Sometimes I do work for them outside of my official semester (consult on stuff, or work as a contractor). Given how little I actually teach, should I send a renounce letter at the end of the semester or just wait for them to reach out again and letting them know I am not longer interested? I am not an unicorn, but I am on a field that gets like 15 tenure track postings every semester across the country and I am aware that finding a replacement could be tough (I asked around some of my friends that also work in R&amp;D in the private sector if they would be interested and everybody was put off by the salary) What is the correct etiquette here?\n\nI also took a semester break already last year (I was a whole year and a half without teaching) and I think I don't want to ask for another break... Maybe I'd like to get back in a few years, but definitely not in the next 3 years at least.",

        "text": "I try to apply to positions that match my interests at least 80%, but those are not really common (or I am not qualified for them) so I need to expand my reach if I want to find a job after graduation. So I apply to some that match my interests only about 60-70%. But if a position like this ends up being my only/best offer, I am getting very anxious about the idea of spending a couple of years, the first years of my academic career, in a subfield I'm not the most passionate about. I'm sure some aspect of the research will excite me, but I'm not sure if that will be enough to get me through the tedious/monotonous parts of the job. It's easy for me to work on very time-consuming/complicated things if I'm passionate about them and very difficult if I'm not (especially when the pay is not great).\n\nFurthermore, I have noticed how important networks/connections are in academia (it seems like everyone who's research I'm most interested is connected in some way) so I'm worried about spending a post-bac making connections that aren't as valuable to me as others could be. \n\nI have heard from people that good mentorship is the most important thing. But it would be very hard for me to get a job offer from an institution I like, matching my interests well enough, and then reject it because the mentorship doesn't seem like it will be great. I feel similarly about the location of the job -- it is important to me but I don't know if I am in the position to be picky about it. Just the competitiveness and difficulty of the job search makes me very doubtful that I would be able to find anything better. But is that a risk I should be more comfortable taking? I would appreciate hearing people's personal experiences with this.",

Lab based and it would allow me to conduct my own experiment which would be included in a paper to be published in PNAS. It'd be similar to the work I've already done the previous 2 summers.\n\nMy question is: how much of a boost would job B be in terms of being accepted into a masters program? My grades aren't an issue in regard to my target universities but I'm a little worried about not having my own project. I'm equally interested in both positions. \n\nThanks!",

        "text": "We know students rob themselves of learning experience and disrespect university faculty and culture when they have chatGPT do their homework for them. However, do we think chatGPT and its more sophisticated future iterations are appropriate tools for research? If so, when, where, and how? To what extent should academic work integrate chatGPT into their working environments?\n\nI am a research coordinator/lead author at a university think tank. I frequently work on several projects simultaneously that involve much grunt writing (too often I find if I want something done right I have to do it myself 🙄 OR have chatGPT do it and then revise its work). I have found that chatGPT has greatly reduced the bottleneck of mundane writing that I often face. My main responsibility in my role is ensuring conceptual coordination and academic consistency, which is detracted from when I have to spend hours editing other peoples writing or write basic but time consuming sections. By using chatGPT, I have been able to spend less time on my more menial tasks and have become incredibly more productive. Since discovering chatGPT I have doubled my academic output. I am not using it to recuse my effort but to increase the fruits of said effort. I care deeply about the integrity of my work, I care deeply about uncovering truths and interpreting/presenting them appropriately/responsibly. I believe honestly that chatGPT greatly enhances my potential contributions to human knowledge. Do my fellow academics disapprove of my chatGPT use?",

        "text": "Looking for advice. I'm a PhD student with one 2nd-author publication, getting ready to submit my first first-author pub here soon. I invited the three other authors on my 2nd-author pub to be on this pub, because they've contributed substantually to the data collection. That being said, none of them are particularly familiar with the bulk of my paper - what I've done with the data, some modeling I've done with the data, results, the whole shebang. It's all new, and definitely a deviation from the first paper we have together. \n\nI emailed them beginning of January asking them to be a co-author. One accepted immediately, the other confirmed they wanted to be a co-author on a phonecall with me for an unrelated matter. Here's my problem - it's now been 2 months, and none of them have looked at the manuscript. I've sent multiple emails over several weeks. I originally sent them a completed draft for everything but the discussion, because I wanted to hear their thoughts on the results before crafting my discussion (although I still had a rough discussion approximately 2,000 words long). Now that it's been two months, things are buttoned up, and I'm getting ready to start the final formatting for the journal. I obviously cannot submit them as co-authors if they haven't read my manuscript and told me they agree with my science ideas, and frankly, I'm a annoyed that I've received 0 input from them regarding ANYTHING for this paper. As a first time publisher, I was hoping to utilize their expertise throughout more of the editing stage, but now I feel like if they didn't agree with my science ideas, then it's almost too late? I feel really annoyed that I'm trying to move this forward, and I have moved this forward completely alone, and now I'm waiting on them to even just read the stupid paper. My advisor is hands off, has read the paper (EXCEPT the discussion).\n\nI'm at a loss. We don't go to the same universities, so all I can do is continue to shoot emails into the void. Is this really publishing? If I want to give credit where credit is due, then my co-authors can hold me hostage with regards to my timeline? I'm worried moving forward that the editing process will have the same problems. Any advice for how to clear up this communication issue and/or approach the obligations of co-authors would be greatly appreciated ): \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: My co-authors haven't read my manuscript at all and it's been over 2 months - they're the only thing holding up my submission timeline. How can I get them to respond/feel the same urgency as me? I've already expressed my concern for the timeline via email multiple times.",
