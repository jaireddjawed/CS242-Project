You have your light source it goes off you start a stopwatch, at the other end you have a fixed variable something like sound or even an rc whatever you want but you know that it will travel at a constant speed, this object sound or whatever goes off when it detects light, then this car sound or whatever you choose goes to the stopwatch the stopwatch stops when the sound/object has reached it. After this we can subtract the known variable from the timer and get the speed of light. It's just an idea I had while in the car with the radio on.",

It was not always that way; I was actually fairly good at it in middle school but one day in high school things just stopped making sense. I didn’t put it enough effort to salvage it afterwards so now you can say I have almost zero knowledge in physics. But recently I find myself watching hours of physics-related content on Youtube and actually think it is interesting even though I don’t really get the science behind it. Is it enough of an excuse to become a physics major, because I know those videos barely scratch the surface and the subject is only gonna get harder down the line. For extra context I was a good student in school for other subjects including Math.",

PBS Spacetime and Sixty Symbols is what really got me into it, today I watch a lot of Sean Carroll's and some of Sabine's videos too 🤭.\n\nThis past week's news about early galaxies from JWST got me looking for the perspective of physicists on these kind of discoveries. It's apparent to me that there is a lot of differing opinions on what the observation could mean, from \"our galaxy formation models are broken\" to \"thats a MOND prediction!\". \n\nI appreciate Sabine for her weekly comments on science news, but I wish for something in longer form and ideally with multiple scientists discussing their different perspectives.\n\nIt doesn't necessarily need to be podcasts, how do you keep up with physics news and the experts opinions on them?",

She was doing this \"timed\" test last night and with only 37 minutes left on the clock, she texted me an image of a question and called to ask me for help....at just after 11:30 pm. I was sound asleep.\n\nAfter waking up enough to tell her that I had no clue and that it had been over 40 years since I had studied high school algebra, geometry, trigonometry and \"calculus,\" my ability to help her was limited to answering part \"B\" of the question since I remembered that the circumference of the \"soup can\" had to do with \"2πR,\" so figuring out the distance the can would travel was pretty simple. The rest of the question, I was clueless. It seems to me that the mass of the \"can of soup\" is needed but not provided.  \n\nSo, can anyone explain this to me? I'm guessing this should be straight forward but for the life of me, I can't figure it out.   \n\n\nHere is the question:  \n\n\n***\"A young girl is playing with a full soup can (treat the can as a solid disk, l=1/2MR2) Her mom measures the radius of the can to be 0.0500 m and sees that it travels at a constant velocity of 2.00 m/s across the floor.***\n\n***A.

Calculate the total number of revolution completed by the soup can from the time it started up the ramp until it came to stop.\"***",

        "text": "So we recently started learning about phonons, and we derived the dispersion relation by considering normal modes of a 1-d lattice of atoms, held together by spring like potentials. So if we have N atoms in a line that loops around, we say that every atom is identical to the others, so the only difference between the atoms can be a phase shift. Then from this we derive the dispersion relation.\n\nWhat I'm very confused on is:\n\n1. Why do we say the atoms loop around? What if they didn't, which is what I think would be the default. Would the normal modes change? Surely now you don't need to impose that delta times N equals integer multiple of 2 pi you have continuous range of possible phase shifts. \n2. I thought when we derive normal modes using a mass matrix and potential matrix (both real), then we find that the eigenvalues are also real (and positive or zero), so real frequencies. Then if real eigenvalues and real matrices then real eigenvectors too, but obviously you can multiple the eigenvector by e\\^iphi, where phi is a phase shift. But this phi affects all the generalised coordinates in that specific normal mode, ie if we have omega=2 as a normal mode then we have (A1,A2,....AN)\\*Ccos(omega\\*t+phi), where A1....AN are all real. So why now do we say that the A1,...AN can have relative phase shift? Doesn't make sense to me. How would this be derived from the mass and potential matrix rather than just by saying that by symmetry the only difference they can have is a phase shift. If we take the example of a triangle of atoms connected by springs we don't even impose this symmetry condition, and we don't get normal modes separated by a fixed phase for each normal mode.\n\nAny help is appreciated.",

        "text": "Note: \"gravitons\" would be equally distributed particles in the cosmic web to fit the amount needed to replicate Gravity force. Space-time deformation would lead to a higher amount of graviton particles near to the mass nucleus, being always equal to the original Gravity force effect. In this case \"gravitons\" aren't the same as the ones in string theory variations, they would be designed to replicate Gravity force, which could make them have a stronger mass if needed to fit, and the equal distribution amount in the cosmic web could be modified to make it perfectly fit.\n\nHey there, I might be clueless about something but as everyone does I tried to guess how could gravity force be explained in a quantum size. What if gravity correlation to mass is just how many gravitons are being pulled in the cosmic web?\nI suppose that those \"gravitons\" have to be equally distributed in every point of the cosmic web with the proportion needed to copy the exact behaviour of normal Gravity force. The reason of these gravitons equally distributed would be roughly the same case as the distribution of energy and heat in the microwave background radiation.\nWhile dark energy does its work gravitons would be already on their place causing any mass to have it's normal gravity by curving space-time while getting the amount of \"gravitons\" needed to simulate his big brother behaviour on a quantum size. It wouldnt change the normal Gravity/mass correlation but add the amount of \"gravitons\" to fit.\nGravitons in this case would be only used to finally explain Gravity force on a sort of equivalent graviton distribution in the cosmic web.\nSo when space-time curves it would only be the way more mass gets a higher graviton amount. If this is applied, Gravity force should be explained as a constant in the cosmic web, which shouldn't be affected by dark energy.\nI obviously guess this has many problems I didn't notice, not even tried to calculate the correlation of the amount of gravitons needed to replicate Gravity force yet.\nAnyway, feel free to give me a hand on why this would be so wrong so we can learn! \nThank you on advance guys",

        "text": "I think the link is that if acceleration of the expansion of the universe is caused by dark energy, and black whole growth correlates with that acceleration, then it is possible for there to be some link between the two. Since dark energy works against the attraction force of gravity, the dark energy wouldn't be consumed by a black hole. That could mean that the dark energy is therefore being emitted from the black hole. And if something is coming out of the black hole, there can't be a singularity. This is just a lay man's interpretation from watching a few vids and reading a few articles, I could be way off. Edit 1: Since reading more carefully it seems like the black holes contain this dark energy instead of emit it. Edit edit 2: maybe the emit it too. Continuing: it seems to me that black holes are converting their mass at a quantum level into dark energy, maybe through hawking radiation (which can also create mass I think) and this is able to escape the event horizon and somehow expands the space around it which adds to the expansion of the universe itself. Therefore the more matter they consume  the larger they become, containing more dark energy (which also increases their size) and thus increasingly accelerating how fast the universe is expanding. If this is true, then the Mass of a Black Hole in comparison to the rotation of a steady Galaxy, can give us how much Dark Energy its Black Hole is emitting? So basically and in conclusion, by the rotation and geometrical formation of each galaxy, we can measure how many Black Holes exist in each galaxy?",
