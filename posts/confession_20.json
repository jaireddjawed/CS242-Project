        "text": "When I was in highschool we had gym class and most of the class were doing sport and stuff. At the end when we returned to the changing rooms we saw two classmates were already there but we didnt think anything of it. We changed our clothes and while I was packing my clothes in my backpack I noticed it was kinda overstuffed, but I shook it off as me not remembering it correctly. We moved to the next class which Im not sure which one it was. As the class started a person reported their Physics textbook being stolen by someone during gym class, as gym class was the first class we had that day. The professor then had us show our physics textbook to the classmate as he could recognise it. They started from the beginning of the classroom and went to the the back of it, I was sitting almost at the back. As they began I didnt really think much of it because I know I didnt take mine because it was so bulky and my backpack could hold so much and that my friend would let me look at his, however guess what I remember to noticed in my backpack as I was putting in my gym clothes earlier. Yes it was a Physics textbook. I started to panic internally, I didnt do anything wrong but if I get caught I would be in super trouble and would have everyone look at me as the quiet kid who has a secret agenda rather than the quiet kid who is just quiet. The textbook was in my backpack and I had to think of something. So a thought came to me, if I damage the front cover a bit secretly, I could get away with it. As I was sitting with my backpack opened right behind me I bent my arm behind my back and reached in the backpack and then thorn a bit of the cover. When the kid came to check it he said it wasnt his. That was a huge relief.\n\nLater on that day and even months later, the kid who had his textbook stolen kept blaming one of the troublemaking kids in the class for it and I never said anything about it, all I could do was just look and not comment on it. I still have a leftover Physics textbook at home, we usually return them every year since we dont pay for them, we just borrow them from the school. The kid whos textbook was stolen had to pay for his missing textbook.\n\nAlright here is what I think happened: The two classmates who were in the changing room before everyone else were studying for the test that day, but since they were one of the \"cool kids who only brought a single notebook and pen to school\" they had no book to look from, so they took one from any of the available backpacks in the changing rooms. please note that the changing rooms are not under surveillance so none knows what happens there and we just gotta trust our classmates not to steal. And once these classmates were done they didnt remember where they got it from so they placed it in mine as I was the 2nd best in grades and a person who did their schoolwork regularly and all that. It also made sense it was mine since I didnt have mine in my backpack that day.\n\nIf I were to say the book somehow got i my backpack but didnt report it earlier then that would be a bit sketchy. I mean it was 8 in the morning when gym ended and I wasnt fully awake to remember I didnt bring my textbook that day.",

It's been like that my whole life, until recently, when I started a job as a self-employed gardener. Now I've had a realisation.\n\nNow, my dad suddenly loves and respects me like he never has before. Meanwhile, my mother is having a mental breakdown. She demands that I give her the money I earn so that she can \"care for me\". \n\nI've realised, my dad hated me because I was lazy. He, being a successful, hardworking, manly man wanted me to amount to something. Now, I have, and he's actually being nice to me. He treats me like a man rather than a child. He respects me, even said he'll buy me a car. \n\nMy mother, despite often complaining about being a housewife, felt that her purpose was to care for me. My brother was already very independent, and now I am too. She feels like she no longer serves a purpose, and so she's become angry, and demands that she should have my money, so that she can continue to look after me like I'm still a child, which is basically how I acted until I got my life together recently.\n\nI know this is headed towards my mum no longer liking me. I still let her buy me food for my job, and I spend half of what I earn on her, but it's not enough. How do I stop our relationship from becoming cold? Will she eventually accept that I've \"flown the nest\"? I still live with my parents for now and the foreseeable future. I don't want my new life to cause conflict.",

I should be excited and grateful. \n\nI'm not. If I could stay at home I would. Its not a question of travel time, my parents house is right next to a train station that directly takes me to the stop closest to my university. I'm not being kicked out either, if I wanted to keep living there I could. But living with them is severely impacting my mental health. Especially after an incident a couple of weeks ago (my grandmother died and my parent's forgot to tell me that she did die that night, and my dad proceeded to indirectly blame me for him not telling me) I can't- I just can't anymore. \n\nBut I'm terrified. It's such a big change. The studio doesn't feel like home yet. I know it will but at the moment that feels so far away. Since I got the key I've been fighting back tears on and off since its just so real now. I'm excited to live closer to my friends but I don't really want to do this. I have to, and I'm excited to have my own place, but at the same time I don't. And I feel guilty. There were 70 people who applied to this place. So many of them would be nothing but happy to get this place yet I'm almost crying over the idea of moving out. I know I'm doing this for my own health but now that it's real it's almost too much. \n\nIt's just a mess.",

        "text": "I am a teacher at a very academically intense and competitive high school. Students here are incredibly focused on their grade point average and their overall class ranking. The pressure is intense mainly due to the parent community as well as administration. \n\nOne policy the school has is that teachers are never allowed to offer retakes on any test, no exceptions. I don't agree with it but I have to enforce it or I would be in trouble with the administration. \n\nI gave a rather large multiple choice test that was worth about 100 points the other day. I gave students over a month to prepare and the test was in preparation for their upcoming mid-term. \n\nOne of my students, lets call her Anna, has been struggling with her mental health lately. Without going into too much detail there was a tragic event in her life that has left her dealing with a lot of trauma in her day to day. She was a straight A student prior and has truly been working hard to get back to that point. \n\nThe day of the test, Anna was clearly not in the best place. She was tired, emotionally distressed, and just doing well. I am not allowed to give her an extension so she had to take the test. \n\nShe got a 26% on her test. I knew she would be devastated and it would hurt her emotional progress. But again, I am not allowed to give retakes so I made a plan. \n\nWhen I put her scantron through the machine, I purposefully jammed it. The scantron was shredded and crumpled. I made sure there was no way to read the scantron. I showed it to my administrator who was frustrated but understood. I was allowed to give her the test again. \n\nShe scored a 91%. If anyone ever found out about this, I would be severely disciplined if not fired for this. \n\nI don't even feel guilty. I am here to teach students not to enforce a policy that only cares about the grades and not the students emotional and mental health.",

All of my alcohol and other illegal items (pills, gummies, etc.) were recently discovered and seized by my parents, so I have had to start over with what I have. Because it runs in my family, I'm concerned that when I become older, I'll develop alcoholism (if im not already considered one).\n\nI couldn't resist myself when I saw their Huuuuge booze collection while house sitting and boredly looked around the house. I'm so sorry for what I did, but I'm also (frustratingly) glad I can start drinking again. Even though I didn't take much, I'm confident I will get caught because I think the house has cameras. The worst part is that, in my opinion, I will wind up doing even worse things in the future just to get drunk.",

My favorite team was Miami heat, I had a shirt that I lived in and everything.\n\nI never really have much access to teams but the gyms at school and one day while in the 6th grade I applied to a basketball team. I admit I did miss one day of practice but that was because I had forgotten it was that day and not the next. I looked at the list of people who made it on the team and was distraught I wasn't on there. I remember crying and shortly after leaving the school. I remember what the coach told me. He told me \"Well I you didn't miss practice you would have made the team.\" It reminded me of when I applied to the cheer team only to be rejected. I blamed myself for not going to practice and never wore my heat shirt for no other reason than to have clothes on.\n\nI am an adult now, when I see anything about basketball, I get excited and then I remember what I could have been and quickly turn it off. This bit of rejection has caused me to also doubt myself in other sports. I was fond of baseball, soccer and track I never joined or stayed for a while due to this one rejection I received. I hate how I could have gone so far and became the dream athlete I would hope to be because of this one rejection. \n\nI don't think my mom knows the full guilt that I have in my soul, but she says she understands when I talk about it.",

        "text": "I don't think my confession is bad nor do I feel guilty about this, I 20 F live at home with my two brothers and my dad. In Nov of 2020 we had to move out of the house and into a new one in a cheaper area. After moving in my grandma on my mom's side started coming over every day to cook and clean and my dad in returns pays her. Well sometime in early 2021 she had to move in, we already weren't getting along bc she always had something to say, I once got in trouble for stirring the chile rellenos when really the spoon she had for us to use made it difficult to pick it up, she told me that I shouldn't drink cold water then eat hot foods immediately after, she gives me the dirtiest looks whenever I'm in the kitchen cooking and will get mad if I don't cook whatever it is I'm making a certain way, her way bc any other is wrong to her. Everyday I end having to tell my dad to have her back off. She got mad at me when I said I don't believe in God, when she said I needed to serve my brothers their food bc I'm a woman and I told her no they can do it themselves. She no longer lives with us but she still comes over every day. I've talked to my dad about not allowing her over anymore bc my brothers have also complained to him about her behavior towards us but he has continuously refused. I no longer eat let alone leave my room until she goes home, I have to wait till she leaves to wash my cat's food and water bowl to avoid getting in trouble bc she's superstitious and thinks cats are dirty and once said that if my cat gets out and none of us are home she wouldn't do anything to bring back in and would lock her out and has hit my cat twice, my cat is scared of her. But in the same breath tell me I'm a bad owner bc I don't let my cat outside on a walk and that my cat is depressed bc she keeps scratching up the furniture, in reality my cat is a very reckless but happy cat. I currently don't work so bc of that I started making my oldest brother(24) lunch for work and a bit over a week ago I made enough tofu eggs for everyone and although she didn't say anything my grandma was upset I made breakfast and that my dad ate it. I asked my dad later that same day after he came home from work why it bothered her so much when I cook especially if I'm cooking for them. He told me that she probably thinks I'm trying to replace her and at first I laughed at the idea bc the entire thing was completely ridiculous and just sad for her to try and compete with me. My brother(21) ended up telling me the same thing the next day I told him that I wasn't trying to but after thinking about this whole thing,  if it means she'll stop coming over then I'll gladly replace her.",

        "text": "I don't have anyone to express my current state. I wouldn't call it as depression as I have yet to consult with a professional. But, I have always had this sad feeling on my chest, one of which i know is caused by my dad. I was born in a Muslim household, you could pretty much guess that my dad is in a polygamy setup, one that he abuses the context of, and never really asked my mom for approval. My dad only had three wives when my mom was still alive, got worst when she died. He had strings of mistresses, and kids that we had no knowledge of, he never had time for us, as he would always reason out that he was busy with \"work\" and the grief for the loss of our mom. He wasn’t, he was as worst as he could get, a week after my mom's death he immediately got with a new girl, not once asking for our approval. My dad had this toxic pattern of forcing us into accepting his new girlfriends, he never actually marries them, but would rather just be there for sex and company. He would often get frustrated and pour his anger at us for the slightest mistakes that we do, given that he feels \"mad\" for having to hide his girls, and so to ease his anger, we the first family, are forced to accept and live with his girls, the two other families of my dad never had the need to cater to my dad's girls as they had their own moms. The 5th girl my dad introduced to us was half his age, pretty and smart. She was nice at first, but soon came their marriage she changed, not that I didn't expect it, but she also became very stingy, acted as if she had a say to all the finances, she even got rid of our weekly allowances, and only shopped at her mom's mini grocery, shi\\*\\*iest food I would say. Eventually, it got worst, she would stir dramas amongst our house staff, fire them for petty reasons, and eventually replace them with that of her own relatives. I just gave her the side eye of how money hungry she became lol. She progressively got worst and would nitpick about my weight a lot and how I was too dark, colorism at its finest, she was very conscious of her skin, and so she dermas go to our house for her monthly skin peel and facials, she barely goes out, as my dad is quite possessive. He eventually cheated again, and got another girl pregnant, she got really upset, but to say the least, I was happy, i’m out of that sh\\*thole. Then came another girl, which he introduced to us, and told us that she was the one and would never cheat again, boy I was right, he cheated after getting her pregnant. My dad had a chain cycle of romancing a girl, giving her all the material stuff, getting her pregnant, then dumping her on a Wednesday. I hated my dad, but he gave us all that we asked for, I was given everything I wanted as compensation for his lack of presence, and him not being able to muster the word “sorry.” There was a time he counted the times he said sorry, told me and my siblings, that it was the last time he would apologize as his ego could not bear it, and that shattered me in the most painful way possible. He brought his mistress to my mom's house, made that bi\\*\\*\\* sleep in my mom’s room, and all I could do was silently cry to sleep. His new girl had a 24 years of gap, same age as my older sister, made me we want to vomit, she came from a very poor background, my dad started grooming her when she was still a teen, and came when she was 22, he formally courted her, gave her parents big dowries, her parents immediately sold her off, bowed liked a pet to dad's money, my dad liked her, why? She was a dog for him, she was \"different\", wasn't as feisty and dominant as the other previous girls, she never once questioned him, nor got mad of his cheating ways, she condoned it, and that for him was an ideal girl, one that he could tame and shape in his liking. I have never met a genuinely stupid person till I met her, she had minions of which would tender to her lack of brain ce\\*\\*s, and they entertained her, as my dad could not bring her out to the public, he admitted to us that he was ashamed of her, he better be. My dad would bring her to meetings, one time she was asked of her current stand with a political issue in our country, a discussion she brought up was a source from tiktok, the way my dad just face palmed. Another was when she was rather worried of my brother unfollowing her on social media than that of other important matters. All she knew was get an appointment for her plastic surgeries, and shop, she wasn't pretty, my dad had to pay for it, the least he had to do to make her more pleasing in the public eye. She had ghost writers make her captions, message us, of which I reply back with a petty message at all times classic me; I would reply on how she should just message me, and not have to be backed up with someone else's writing, the way her message was composed as a try hard, with all the complex words that they could muster lmfao. My last tring of patience triggered when she came to my sister's wedding, stole the spotlight, and since she had to cause that scene, midway I grabbed her hair, dug my nails, and said \" learn when to show up, puta\\* like you don't deserve to be seen in the public eye.\" My dad got mad, but he could never directly tell it to us, he had no right to, he was at fault, and what angered me more was that my sister, who got married told me she didnt know that bi\\*tch was coming, but to my dismay, it was my sister who invited her, all of us got disappointed at her, as we already told her not to, but she didnt listen, she wanted my father's approval, thats why she did it. I blocked her, currently removing her from my life already, what she did was very disrespectful to our mom. I couldnt handle being in that toxic household, and so im currently studying overseas, and hopefully never come back.",
