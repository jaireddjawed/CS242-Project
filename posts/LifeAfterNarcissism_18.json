        "text": "Posted by request, from the “change my name” thread comment section.  ❤️\n\n......\n\n I’m going to go out on a limb here- please feel free to step up and tell me to can it. ❤️\n\nThe toxic shame ( ([info here](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.psychologytoday.com/blog/overcoming-destructive-anger/201704/overcoming-the-paralysis-toxic-shame%3famp) ) you feel about inconveniences to others is one I deeply identify with. I also identify with the absurd feeling of posturing that goes with giving yourself a nickname, rather than “properly earning it” from another person. So, here’s a stab in the dark at maybe how this cycle plays out, if it’s anything like my own:\n\nFor you, it’s all connected. The name is connected to the abuse. The triggering  to the abuse. The shame is connected to the abuse. The fear of rejection, abandonment, and even the overwhelming response to the mere concept of explanation?  All connected to the abuse. \n\nBut our conditioning is also directly connected, and that reality is a lie. So you may believe that changing your name will lead to having to voice the abuse. You may also believe that having to voice the abuse will mean having to reassert that you didn’t deserve it, and standing up for yourself feels disingenuous, if not outright dangerous, because you were conditioned to believe that your own needs or desires are selfish and shameful. So there’s a clear path, from changing your name, to having to own the abuse, which makes it all too real, and no longer something we can actively disassociate as a form of self care. Maybe that line is as firmly drawn for you, like it is for me. \n\nWhich is awesome. Because it means we aren’t alone in this. *grabs your hand (assuming you’re consenting to touch)*. So. Together then?\n\nI’m asking you, if you’ll ask the same of me:\n\n- To change your name to literally any joyful thing of your own choosing. I am giving you this nickname, because when you say this name out loud, I see the joy and the peace we, the scapegoats, rightly deserve. I see it like a point of sunlight on a raindrop, cascading a chain effect of colors into our world, and I want that in the world for everyone to see. So I dub you with this joy you keep locked inside a name,  ready for the world to enjoy. \n\n- To break the conditions of that name and that shame. To recognize that when you feel the new name connects you in a line of cascading fears to the abuse, it is only because you are conditioned to believe that any choices you make for yourself are open to those same conditions. It is terrifying to come to the realization that the only person driving this runaway stage coach is you. That only you are there to take up the reins and stop the horses from charging onward. But it doesn’t feel like the power others say we have, because we aren’t in the driver’s seat. We are back in the coach, jostling around and only trying to make sense of the tumbling madness within. We struggle to keep our footing, stuffing fistfuls of clothing back into suitcases as they pop open and fling the contents about the cab. Our chaos is only this micro universe within the carriage, and we lack the presence of mind to ignore the chaos and look out the window at the truth. \n\nThe truth is:  Fuck the baggage. \n\nLet it spill all over the place. And yeah, maybe when you first open the door and climb out to get into the driver’s seat of the carriage, some of the baggage spills out. But why on earth would anyone stop and actively explain to an onlooker on the roadside,  “I’m so very sorry about that skirt and three pairs of knickers. You see, I know that I was incapable of maintaining the baggage inside the cab, and even though I had no control over how those bags were packed, I understand that I accepted full responsibility for the care and safety of those particular garments, even though their owner abandoned them years ago, and they actually do not fit any single person here.  Please excuse me a moment, whilst I run back to collect them, and then I shall return and attempt to remount this runaway carriage and climb up to the reins.”\n\nThat’s... absurd. But the conditioning we suffered is often the only outcome  we experienced, so it’s all we understand to do, and doing it any other way is immediately filed as a direct path to failure and shame. \n\nSo here I am, standing on the side of the road, looking on as you start to open that door. And instead of wondering why you’re scooping up fistfuls of knickers, I’m saying that I’ve been in a similar situation.  Here’s the truth, as I know it. \n\n- People don’t usually want full explanations. The unbottling that we do, because we are conditioned to offer up all the information to our abusers?  Most people don’t want all that.  It’s because they aren’t filing it all away to hurt us with at some future time when they feel that conditioning needs to be reenforced. \n- You’re conditioning (falsely) demands accountability, but your joy does not. Your new name is a path to your joy. You are not beholden to any strings your conditioning has automatically attached. \n\nI hope you’re ready to change your name soon. I hope you remember that only your abusers demanded explanations, and the vast majority of people who ask why you’ve changed your name, are only asking out of curiosity, and do not require the accounting of abuse in order to accept the name you’ve chosen. And I hope you remember that your joy is worthy of the world. Because we all love to see a rainbow. \n\nThis got way longer than intended. I’m guilty of some of my own unbottling here. I hope it’s helpful to both of us, though, and that I’ve not overstepped any boundaries you might have. ",

So basically, I'm paralyzed/trapped in this situation where it feels \"too late\" to change my name (I'm 28), and too bad to go through life with the name that was screamed, taken from me, and used by my Narc parents as proof that they were wonderful (it was a unique name and I got compliments on it. I didn't deserve this \"good\" name that they came up with).\n\nSo...basically, I'm afraid to see people/interact with them because I can't explain my identity, and my name is triggering. I've given out nicknames, but that makes me uncomfortable because I don't believe people should give themselves nicknames (I don't care if other people do it - I just like to have them given by friends). \n\nSo...what do I do? Legally change my name? Bite the bullet and stick to my old (new) name? \n\nIf I tell my new friends about my name change, then I have to admit to the abuse, and I've been hiding that from them...\n\nSo I have to explain I was abused, which I don't want to do.\n\nHow do I start putting my own needs/safety above others?

        "text": "N-ex runs extracurriculars where my friends are, and after he went apeshit after he heard I was confiding in my friends about his NAbuse and the breakup and banned me from everything. I successfully appealed the bans and got clearance to return.  My friends wanted me back, they mostly agreed that N-ex banning me was unfair since he banned me without even letting me present my side or without allowing anyone else to negotiate or contest the ban even though it was solely based on his private life which speaks to his inability to empathize. \n\nI wasn’t sure if I should return at first. I feared N-ex’s inability to understand that my relationships with others in our social group do not depend on or center on him would cause him to think I’m trying to seek him out, which would open up the possibility of more manipulative behavior, hoovering, or social assassination since he’d accuse me of stalking him, being obsessed with him and trying to get back to him through other people even though he had absolutely zero problem doing that last one with me himself earlier last year. But he’s an N, so he doesn’t have to make any sense because he’s above that. That’s exactly what made return so daunting because I have no idea what he could do and how he’ll RVO and twist my words. \n\nBut then, I realized by retreating into fear, I was still letting N-ex control me and isolate me, which is exactly what he wants. I decided I was going to take back my space from him and return. I spoke to my friends about wanting space from N ex and saying what happened was not their fault and that N ex was being unfair and they agreed. So we arranged times that I can come in when N ex will probably not be there and if I get unlucky I’ll just leave. I was careful to have the conversations orally or word any texts unambiguously and in large chunks (which is unusual for me) because Nex has manipulated people for screenshots of me before talking about my relationship with him the breakup and his Nbehavior and then cropped out context to gaslight me and RVO and Shame me.\n\nBut I feel 10 stories high right now. It was more nerve racking than the midterm I wrote yesterday, but it feels so damn good to shut down an N trying to control and isolate you and those around you. ",

        "text": "I reached out to my younger brother tonight, to talk about what life was like for him growing up.  I had moved to the southwest eleven years ago, and kinda fell off the map.  I don't use Facebook because of how toxic it can be, but I haven't kept in close contact with my brother all these years.  I realized that I had spent the last decade wrapped up in myself, trying to logic myself out of the emotional problems of my past, never once thinking about how my brother had gone through the very same abuse and abandonment I had.  I felt horrible when it dawned on me that I had all but abandoned him and his story, in the search for the truth about mine. \n\nI called him up, and invited him to share his story; what he remembered, how the abuse had colored his adulthood, and what damages remained.  This was one of the most eye-opening conversations of my life.  For me, my mother was my primary abuser, but for him, she was not.  We both knew at a very young age that our mother was... difficult, to say the least.  But he had learned to tune her out and grey rock her, and to not take anything she said personally.  He knew the well was dry, and while he was forced to live with her, he did not internalize her verbal assaults as I did.  I kept going back to the well, thinking that if only I could have pleased her, if only I could just do what she wanted, she would love me.  He knew that there was no love to give, and nothing would ever be good enough. \n\nHis demons stemmed from our father, who had abandoned us when my brother was eight.  My father, after enduring our mother's abuse for so long, finally snapped; he grabbed my mother by the throat, slammed her down to the tile floor, and tried to strangle her with his bare hands.  I was upstairs, trying to get away from mom's tirade, my brother saw the assault and tried to pull dad off mom.  For a sense of scale, 6'0\" 200lb man, trying to choke a 4'11\" 120lb woman to death, while their 3' eight-year-old son tried to pull him off her.  I can only imagine the horror in my brother's mind.  Good news, he didn't kill her. Bad news, that was the start of my father's abandonment. \n\nMy father didn't see us for almost a year after that; involuntarily committed to a mental hospital, then jail, then a restraining order agains him seeing us.  We only got to see him again in a psychologist's office, then only on supervised visits, then only in public settings, and eventually every other weekend after the divorce.  He couldn't hold a job for long, especially with a felony conviction on his record.  Child support was essential to my mother, but dad almost never had it to give.  And even when he did eventually see us on weekends, we would just hang out in his dinky studio apartment watching TV or playing video games; not real quality time.  \n\nI appreciated that time with him, because it was time I didn't spend with mom and her emotional abuse.  But my brother resented him for it; mom was already a lost cause, and now the other parent had checked out, first physically, then financially, then emotionally.  Looking back it was clear in retrospect, dad was depressed and disconnected.  And that hit my brother especially hard.  Their relationship did not get better as the years went by.  My father found a new love with a lady from the other side of the country, and moved to be with her.  This was almost full abandonment, since now we weren't even in the same state, and dad was bad about keeping in touch.  Visits went from once a week to once a year.  Calls were maybe once a week...maybe.  \n\nI never saw how strained my brother and dad's relationship is, until our talk tonight.  My father rarely reaches out to me, and we live 30 minutes apart; it's much worse for my brother.  Three months ago he turned 30, and he got no phone call or presents from dad.  Dad's fine by the way, mid 60's and looking just fine, no disabilities, full cognitive functionality; just forgot to acknowledge his youngest son's milestone birthday.  I cannot help but to look at our father in a new light, and it is not flattering.\n\nMy brother told me of his unique struggles; how he always must have employment, even if it's shitty employment.  How he is a peacemaker because he cannot stand conflict.  How he is afraid of ending up in a marriage as toxic as our parents did.  I commented that it must have been terrifying to propose to his now wife; he went silent for several moments.  How he is afraid of having children until he has enough money saved, or his fear of abandoning or abusing his own kids when he has them.  How he had no male role models in his life until late high school.  How he is afraid of all the mistakes that dad made, and repeating them himself.  \n\nI told him of my struggles with our mom.  How she routinely told me \"why can't you be normal\", so I am defensive and confrontational about my own quirks.  How she would storm into my room and break everything she could get her hands on, so I am very protective of my personal possessions.  How she would berate me when I did not perform well in school, so I feel that if I have not done something perfectly, I am a failure.  How she would yell at me for everything, so I cannot accept any attention today, since all attention is negative attention.  How I was a horrible child and a failure, even though I didn't drink or use drugs, consistently got As or Bs and was on the Honor roll, didn't cause property damage, and didn't get a girl pregnant; and therefore I was not enough.  I wasn't good enough, strong enough, smart enough, friendly enough, likeable enough, helpful enough... I just was not enough, and I never will be.\n\nMy brother then told me that this was ludicrous horse shit.  I'm one of the smartest people he knows, one of the funniest, I have all of these great things going for me, he could never grasp concepts as easily as I did in school, and he has not met a single person who had met me who doesn't like me or love me, I bend over backwards to help whenever I can, and I'm just one of the coolest people he knows.  If it was anybody else in the world, I would tell them they were full of shit, and I was none of those things.  But this was my brother, and I believed him.\n\nThe call ended shotly after that, we had been talking for hours and it was getting late, but we promised we would continue the conversation later.  I hung up, sat down, and cried.\n\nGuys, I bawled my eyes out for over twenty minutes.  I just sat on the couch sobbing and ugly crying into my wife's shoulder until I couldn't breathe, then when I caught my breath I broke down again.  I feel like I lost a gallon of tears and snot to that one sentence by my brother; the brother who I had almost drifted entirely away from. \n\nI AM enough.  I had not ever, ever, in my life, heard that from my immediate family.  I am not a screw up, I am not a failure, I am not a burden on my friends and acquaintances, I am not simply tolerated to be polite, I am not nothing, and I am enough.  I'm crying writing that down even now.  Over two decades of believing I'm not enough, and one sentence from my sibling is enough to open the floodgates.  \n\nI will be talking to my brother more, there is a lot more ground to cover and memories to compare.  But this is a good start.  And maybe tomorrow will be a good day.  Not just an alright day, not just a not too bad day, not just a mornings are hard day; a good day.\n\nRemember:  whoever, whatever, and wherever you are, you are enough.  You are enough.  You are loved, you are valued, and YOU ARE ENOUGH!",

        "text": "Hi Everyone,\nI am at the tail end of my second narcissistic relationship. The difference with this one is that instead of staying for 3 years, it thankfully ended at 4 months. There are so many things that I can share with you to highlight the amount of abuse and horror that I went through but I honestly wouldn't even know where to start.\n\nWhat I would like to mention, however, is that my ex girlfriend had a history of narcissistic relationships and I chose to ignore it because I believed that I would be different. Oh was I wrong. I have never experienced this level of evil within a person before going through this particular breakup.\n\nWe met in October of 2017 and went through each and every horrific stage of a narcissistic relationship that you could expect: Love, Devalue, and once I started to stand up for myself, Discard. We've been broken up since Valentine's Day (I know, right) when she stonewalled me after talking me into giving her another chance within the same couple of days. Followed by the past few weeks of her randomly unblocking to harass me until I finally blocked her a few days ago in order to regain control of my life.\n\nFast forward to today, I have been talking to a new girl who came into my life almost right when my ex and I broke up. I don't know where it's going because I'm still healing myself, we haven't slept together, but we definitely both enjoy each other's company. Anyways, we went to a concert last night and I saw my ex. I tried my best to make it appear that I didn't see her and spent the rest of the night just trying to focus on having a good time with this new girl and not acknowledge the fact that my ex kept bringing random guys around us in order to get my attention and even tried to shoulder check me as she walked by at one point. The new girl that I am seeing didn't know that I saw my ex because I didn't want to make her feel uncomfortable. We finished out the night, and then went home.\n\nThis morning, I woke up to an email (the only way my ex can contact me) stating \"the guy that you saw me with last night, fully knowing that you would run into me there, invited me to his concert [he was one of the DJs] and then took me back to his place afterwards. You're welcome.\"\n\nI spent the entire day carefully crafting my response in a way that communicated that she was a narcissist and needs to find ways to love herself and let me go. Until I had an epiphany: She wants me to respond. She wants to get a reaction out of me so that I re-hook and she can draw me back in. So about an hour ago, I deleted it and decided not to say anything at all. Because the best way in which I can communicate that I am in control of my reality, and not her, is to turn around and walk away with my integrity still intact. Had this been a couple of weeks ago, I would have completely came unraveled. It still hurts, and most likely will for a while. But tonight, I feel empowered that I am finally taking my power back and diverting my attention into my own well-being instead of hers. \n\ntl;dr: stay strong and continue no contact, it gets easier.\n",

        "text": "Hi, ok long here.....\n\nLong time since i've been here! My friend works for me as a rehearsal assistant (i'm director of a small ballet company). After almost 20 yrs we ran into each other and realized we've lived in the same area for a few years and didn't know it!! \n\nSo she helped me with Nutcracker (and also performed--very good dancer). Though I use \"help\" liberally. She mostly just sat in rehearsal and didn't help a lot at all. But she had another job and we agreed for her not to be paid....whatever. \n\nSo now it's spring and lucky for me we aren't doing a big show! Just a small outdoor festival with a 30 minute slot to dance. I am due with baby #2 in a few weeks and told her she is in charge for now, make it happen. And she is getting paid, though dance jobs do NOT pay a lot!!\n\nDoes anyone have any insight on this type situation? Ever employed a friend? I tried asking her to help more in the fall, but it didn't help. The two of us are *very similar, with very similar personalities and issues.* Like, carbon copies. I feel like she is the me from 2 years ago--easily overwhelmed by small things (like more than 20 or 30 hrs of work/week) and unable to connect feedback or consequences of her actions (we both run massively late almost all the time). \n\nSo for the festival she's performing--doing the Lilac Fairy (for the ballet fans out there!! :)  ) and is still getting the cobwebs off her dancing. I met with her and asked her what's her plan for being in shape (it's not on pointe though). Because I know she'll rehearse it, sort of, but not really take any class. Probably just once a week, like she did for Nutcracker. She's all caught up in thinking she needs to make money (with her other job), so she doesn't prioritize dance. I also told her we're not young, and this window won't stay open forever. My husband (who is really good at strategy with people/employees) thinks i should basically not say anything and just deal with it, as it will mess with our friendship.\n\nI am trying to help her and be a good friend. I mean, I'm her boss, so you know, it is my business that she is late, or doesn't help me. I can also see how her choices affect her life, and I think I should, without being controlling, give her some guidance and push her a little with a little tough love. I have a TON of insight on this, especially with this company. I have grown SO much as a person because of it, and I have tons of guidance I could share.\n\nBut even if she just dances and isn't rehearsal assistant, I've told her I won't put her on stage if she doesn't take class. Period. That is not how I want to run my company. And I've told her that. I'm nice, but direct. \n\n**TL/DR: My friend works for me and isn't prioritizing the job and is wishy-washy about it. I want her to commit or not and I need someone who can do the job well. I want to give her feedback on this and for her to have a good life and be able to function, even if she doesn't work for me. What do I say to her/what type of advice do i give??**",

        "text": "That's a quote from [this](https://www.psychotherapy.net/article/complex-ptsd#section-responding-functionally-to-emotional-flashbacks) article.\n\nI've known about CPTSD and narcissistic abuse for a few years now but reading this article finally made me feel a clarity and sense of optimism I've never felt. I've always just put Youtube videos of various coaches/therapists who deal with CPTSD/NPD but it was really just soothing background noise, which was a pretty ineffective way of learning about this stuff. \n\nI've been in a particularly terrible year from hell, which is sort of like the capstone to a life of ever increasing difficulty and insanity. The pain has been so bad and I was just googling some CPTSD resources to actually pin down the definition of emotional flashbacks because I was having one but realized I wasn't even sure if I really understood the definition. \n\nSo many lines in this article hit me hard (but in a good way!). I've heard this stuff before, but it never \"stuck\" like it is right now.\n\nI've felt so hopelessly trapped in so many toxic thought and behavior patterns. I always just lose control of my emotions and always end up making my life so much more difficult than it needs to be and compounding my lack of faith in ever being able to feel grounded, mature, wise, strong. Also I'm tortured and triggered by the thought of never being able to handle the predatory and abusive behavior lurking around every corner (a bit of a stretch, but in my experience there really is small forms of abuse everywhere, I experienced them daily as I'm sure we all do, whether or not we recognize them as such).\n\nI just feel like a weak lamb in a jungle full of vicious predators, and like this is just the shitty, grim, dark reality of life. I've felt so SO trapped by predatory harm anxiety, fears of abandonment, humiliation, abuse, and more alarmingly I've felt such a toxic impotent rage at not really feeling like I'll ever be able to keep my cool and stop and think before responding. It's so easy to trigger me and I just make things worse for myself!\n\nI'm so happy there is a dedicated and compassionate CPTSD community working hard to heal our wounds. Now that I'm starting to actually allow feelings I'm able to truly feel connected to my fellow warriors.\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/80xzk5/was_my_ex_a_narcissist/",
        "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am just now coming to terms with what happened to me in August-December 2017. I was so stunned by how my (now ex) wife behaved that I still can't comprehend it, even knowing what I know now about narcissism. Her words and actions made me lose faith in the basic goodness of people. I'm left wondering whether she ever cared for me at all or was just using me to get what she wanted. I don't know and may never know. In a normal breakup at least you have the consolation of knowing that they cared for you at some point. With my ex, I have no idea what she really felt. \n\nI crashed hard - I couldn't sleep or eat for weeks. I smashed most of my furniture into match sticks to get the anger out. I only got through the depression with the love of my family and support of friends. But the whole experience profoundly damaged me. I'm only just now recovering. It's like waking up one day with Capgras Syndrom for real. \n\nThree years ago I married the woman of my dreams: beautiful, intelligent, and wild. She had no boundaries. We traveled the world together. What I didn't know then, and couldn't possibly have guessed, was just how hurtful and damaging the relationship would prove to be. And yet it was also the most intense and extraordinary of my life. \n\nThe warning signs were there I suppose. A long, long line of broken relationships behind her, none of which lasted more than 2-3 years. Dramatic breakups. She told me once that her emotions could switch off in a relationship in a heartbeat and then that was it. That worried me, obviously. But I thought I can reach her through love and kindness, because I am a good man. \n\nShe began her first affair (that I know of) two months after our marriage. I was putting her through college at the time. She started sleeping with a fellow student - this continued for at least six months. I only found out about it by accident almost a year later. I should have broken off the relationships then, but she had me convinced it was my fault that she strayed. \n\nAnd then on our second wedding anniversary, she ran off with another man that she'd literally met two days before, while we were on vacation. When she finally came home (with his ring on a chain around her neck), she was cold as ice to me. It was like my wife had been replaced by an unfeeling robot. She casually demanded that I rent her an apartment and buy her a car so she could be independent. I couldn't bellieve her sense of entitlement. There was no empathy. I had been tossed aside like an old pair of shoes. She manipulated my emotions to get me to support her financially. I finally gave her enough to get on her feet (since she was in a foreign country)- and then she used the funds to go visit the new boyfriend. How's that for gratitude?\n\nShe'd actually demanded a divorce several times. She always went right to the brink when she was angry. I was always walking on egg shells with her. She had no control when she was angry - sometimes she could be violent with me. It was so disorienting. I thought it was something I was doing wrong. I couldn't understand how her moods could swing so violently. \n\nOne of my friends - who had a narcissistic spouse - told me that my wife was a narcissist. He spoke from hard experience. So I did some reading, and then I did a LOT of reading, and I think he's right. But I'd really like to hear from others. Was my ex a narcissist? Something else? What the heck happened? \n\nThere was an astonishing lack of empathy at the end. I couldn't believe it. I thought this woman was my soulmate - or at the very least my friend. But she treated me with deliberate and calculated cruelty. And her sense of entitlement. My God! She said she was a cheap wife, since she didn't demand that I fill her closet with Jimmy Chou shoes or Dior dresses. And yet I put her through college. I paid for her dad's cancer treatment. We traveled all over the world. I gave and gave and she just took. And then there was no gratitude. \n\nShe had a grandiose view of herself - that she had special gifts of insight and healing. She was very into new age ideas. She said I wasn't a spiritual person. She treated me with benevolent condescention as a less evolved spiritual being. To me, being spiritual means treating others with kindness and love, not as a means to ones own gratification. \n\nBut I'm not sure about other indicators of NPD. Her early childhood and teenage years seem consistent with what Randi Kreger called vulnerable narcissists (neglect, abuse, etc). I think she was gaslighting me (consciously or no) since anytime I questioned her behavior she would retort 'ask yourself' or otherwise deflect it back on me. She magnified my flaws and filled me with self-doubts. I started wondering if I was a narcissist - but I KNOW I can love someone fully, with my whole heart. \n\nShe told me once that she loved how I loved her. She said my love was so shining and pure. She confessed that she couldn't love like I did. She didn't know how. Interestingly, this bothered her. It bothered me too! I thought through love and patience I could reach her, but I think it just fueled her narcissism until I was discarded.\n\nSo was she a narcissist? I'm desperate to understand, so I can have closure and move on. If she wasn't a narcissist, what accounts for her behavior? I'm starting to wonder if there really is evil in the world. \n\nI wrote an essay about it. I've published many articles and book chapters over the years. I wrote it for me, for my own understanding, but now I think perhaps I should share it with others - since I think it might help someone else recognize and recover from a dysfunctional relationship. But I want to make sure I'm right about the NPD. \n\nThank you for reading.\n\nKind regards,\n\n'John'\n\n\n\n\n\n",

This would go on for an hour and I often didn't get enough sleep. I was with her for almost a year and I know I was emotionally abused by her, even my friends saw it, and one of them told me the other day that my last relationship \"was bad, just bad.\"\n\nAnyway, I was looking through my medical records the other night and I noticed the big change in my weight during that time. When I got my real job and started going to the doctor, I was around 165. Less than two years later, I was at 191, and that coincided with my time with her. I wasn't a lazy couch potato during that time, I was actually more active then than I was now. I was running half marathons and 5k's regularly and was preparing for a marathon shortly before we broke up. I went back and looked at some of pictures, and yep, I definitely looked like I gained some weight, and it wasn't the muscles. Thankfully, my weight started going down after we broke up, and I'm down to 165 again. I always knew I had some emotional scars from that relationship, but I never expected physical changes. ",

I don't know if that's the reason or that because both my father and my brother used to undermine my ability in both waking up early in the morning as well as my career choices.

It also paid minimum wage. \n\nI did some part time work for a small business over the past month. On my last day I asked him to mail my check. When I get the check in the mail, the note says “contract labor, thank you!”\n\nI thought about how to respond, whether or not to just cash the check and move on with my life, but I don’t know the implications of this and in the end decided I didn’t want to risk the liability. I guess my anxiety about taxes outweighed my fear of confronting someone who was trying to take advantage of me. I didn’t want to make a mountain out of a mole hill, I didn’t want to be a problem, etc.\n\nI sent him an email saying he classified me incorrectly and we have two options going forward to correct it: the first, and one I think works best for both of us, is to classify me as an employee and give me a new check. The second is that I’ll submit an SS-8 form to the IRS and go from there.\n\nI got back paragraphs of guilt inducing illogical evasive nonsense. I waited a few hours to respond to his only question, asking when I’d come by to get a new check, amidst all the crap I won’t bore you with, with simply “I’ll be by at 4 tomorrow -mote0fdust”\n\nI’m still nervous for more in person guilt, but I’m proud I didn’t let someone take advantage of me. Five years ago I would have felt guilty for confronting him and not have done it.\n\nAny time I start to rethink NC should be LC, I think about all the progress I’ve made and have I never would be where I am without NC.",

Both Friday and Saturday he didn't call on time, or at all for that matter, with excuses such as his sim card keeps falling out, keeps dropping calls, etc. He asked me to get skype, so I complied, Sunday comes and he calls at the requested time, but not on Skype, just a regular phone call.\nThe entire weekend he was relatively polite and tried to be all buddy buddy with me. He asked me if he could just etransfer me money (rather than go thru our government maintenance program I signed up for so I didn't have to deal with being a glorified bill collector.)

She was pretty devaluing and completely ripped me apart (nothing new I guess) in her prior emails to me when I had initially moved my things out. I didn't even know what narcissism was until about 6 months ago after confiding in a close friend about a particular incident with her and he asking me if I knew what it was. But now that I've researched it, a lot of signs were/are there. \n\nHer disengagement emotionally/physically and increased devaluing in the past 6 months was crippling to me, and all I've read thus far is that usually is a sign they found new supply. So why is she circling back? And exhausting every way to contact me? Has she been waiting me out, now suddenly realizing I actually am gone for good?",

        "text": "Hi guys,\n\nI've gone NC with both parents and the entire family in the end of last year. In the beginning of NC I just felt guilty and scared, partly due to my dad showing up and harassing me (and parents sending letters, money etc). But the guilt has passed and made place for anger, and grief. \nI recently sent my grandma a letter explaining what has happened and why I can't be part of the family anymore. It was hard to come to terms with; I realised my grandma is an N too and I was her GC. When growing up, she was the only person who made me feel loved and I now realise that it was just as toxic. I sent her my letter and never heard back. Part of me still wanted to hear back, just to know that she did love me and would miss me. I know I am the one who decided to go NC with the parents but it doesn't make it any less painful. The fact that no one reached out to see what had happened made me feel truly alone for the first time in a long while. I just didn't think I would feel it as strongly as I did when no one reached out. \n\nI've been focusing on my healing as much as I am able to. I'm seeing a psychologist, I talk to my SO and friends about it, and I am still able to do all my daily stuff such as work (which I couldn't really before). But while I do all this, I feel this lingering sense of sadness/depression all the time, and it's hard to ignore. I also feel very insecure all the time; about the quality of my work, my social skills, how good a partner I am, and who I really am. I freak out about the tiniest thing and can't let things go or put them in perspective. \n\n\nI function alright when I have stuff that needs doing, but I don't do well when I have time for myself. I end up thinking about what's going on, how I am feeling and things of the past. A lot of things of the past feel like a lie now that I know what was really going on, and I can now see how I've made decisions that were really unhealthy. I also realise how many of my behaviours are toxic and a consequence of my upbringing. That's hard to come to terms with at times, and it makes me feel like I have a lot to work on, maybe too much. \n\nThere have been times where I really just want to put on my coat, walk outside to the train tracks and wait for a train to come. Or hurt myself to relieve the emotional pain by numbing it with something else. I haven't done it, but I know well enough what it means when you think of these things with a sense of relief.\n \nI guess I am just tired of fighting the fight every day, and not feeling like I get any better, or that life will get better. I realise that this isn't something new, I've felt this way since I can remember (12th birthday even). It just doesn't feel like it's getting better, not even with going NC. I haven't done anything because I don't want to hurt my SO or my friends (though part of me feels like people won't care much anyway). I could tell them, but I don't want anyone to panic, and I don't want (professional) help either. It's not a new feeling either. Also because there is a part of me that still feels that bit of hope that it must get better somehow. \n\n\n\nI guess I'd like to know if this is just me. Did you feel similar, did it go away? Did life really get better after NC?\n\n ",

        "text": "Throwaway account for anonymity. \n\nLet’s make this epic post a little more simple, and group the sections. \n\nPeople: \n\nMe [28F], June [33 F], and Rachael [35 F]\n\nSituation: \n\nI was in a “relationship” with Rachael for nine months. We were friends with June (they had a friendship before I came into the picture). We all work in the same company, and hung out together regularly. \nJune and Rachael both told me (in their own company) they were both bisexual the day I had become friends with both of them outside of work. Rachael and I commenced what became our “relationship” that evening after (secretly) hanging out after our group hang ended. \n\nI didn’t really get a chance to “assess” which of them (if either) I was really interested in, because I didn’t really know until that day, but things with Rachael “just happened” so fast and intensely: a whirlwind relationship. I didn’t really feel the need to “assess” June prior to that because I didn’t even know she was into women. If I did, I may have done things differently. \n\nRachael is not open/up front about her sexuality (or most things) at work (and in life) and she requested I do not tell anyone at work about the relationship, especially not June. As above, June KNEW Rachael was also interested in women (as was the only person at work who did), so this was definitely not the reason she kept it from her. I raised this issue many many times over the course of the relationship because of how fraudulent I felt for hiding one of the biggest parts of my life to people I would have otherwise wanted to tell, but Rachael didn’t want me to and I obliged.\n\nDuring the early stages of relationship with Rachael, I learned her sexuality was an issue for her identity more than just about other people knowing - she would deny the magnitude of her interest towards women. She denied our relationship citing various arbitrary (and false) reasons making me feel it was my fault. She also told me in these early stages that June was actually more of a lesbian in practice, and a few other things about her I liked. I’m a lesbian, and the reality is that I prefer being intimate with lesbians. \nJune was really nice and treated me really well on every occasion, and appeared to be interested in me based on the conversations her and I would have separately and her behaviour when we all hung out as a group. June was the one who would invite me to these occasions, not Rachael. \n\nRachael also noticed it and we spoke about it. Rachael said June had previously said something about me which indicated she was interested in me romantically. Rachael was very jealous of June’s interest, even though we were seeing each other (something she downplayed and denied due to the identity issues she had - all whilst being monogamous with me). \n\nRachael was awful, mean, jealous, cold, invalidating, and emotionally abusive. She made me feel horrible on an almost-daily basis. She expected me to treat her as my girlfriend (such as giving up my friendship with others, weekend trips, sharing of “love” talk, future talk, sexual intimacy, etc.), but didn’t want to acknowledge our relationship even amongst us. \nI soon learned she had done similar things (to a lesser degree, of course) to other friends, causing momentous disarray. \n\nWe soon stopped hanging out with June as a group, as Rachael started to dislike her - for both being interested in me (and showing it) and other reasons. When I’d hang out with June in social situations, I was broken up with. I would be attacked and accused of cheating, even though I did nothing of the sort because I was so into the abuse cycle from Rachael I had not even THOUGHT of being with anyone else, even though I had friends trying to set me up with others who sounded fantastic and more suited to me. I was thoroughly entrenched in the abuse cycle; my heart was solely focused on that relationship, and I ignored every other possibility with others (even if I could rationally see they would be good - or better - for me) to try and finally achieve being acknowledged as Rachael’s girlfriend. Although she would occasionally accuse me of cheating in her bouts of anger, she didn’t have any ongoing concern I was interested in anyone but her. Based on what I know about her, she would have raised this if it was even a transitory thought. \n\nEventually, I distanced from June (without telling her, of course, and without making it “sudden”) to keep the peace with Rachael. I gave everything I had to that relationship, especially my self-esteem and dignity. I would allow her to cross my boundaries, and I’d apologise to her for having those boundaries. I would feel like her awful treatment of me was my fault (because she would say it was), and I’d try to please her. I’d walk on eggshells to make sure she was always happy, but not even that was good enough. As a result, I slowly eroded as a person after the degrading treatment I received and effectively “begged” for. After a while, I no longer felt I was the same person I was when I met her.\n\nFinally, Rachael and I ended. At this point, she had already severed ties with June well prior (over something completely unrelated to me). After the dust had settled, June and I recommenced our friendship and hung out a few times. It was going really really well, and we were having such great times together, but I couldn’t bear the guilt of her not knowing. It made me feel like I was a fraud. After a lot of soul searching (because I knew it’d crush her for being lied to for so long), I told June about Rachael and I. We both had a very raw and emotional experience as a result (and had never been emotional with/around each other before), and it seemed okay for a few days because we were both glad to be away from the manipulative grip of Rachael, and happy we were still in each other’s lives. It was all very cathartic. She said she was upset with Rachael, as her and Rachael were friends and it “wouldn’t have made a difference” whether it was me or someone else as the secret lover. She understood why I did what I did and wasn’t upset with me, especially because she knows what Rachael is like. She had made her mind up about Rachael before she knew about Rachael and I. She said she was upset because she told Rachael she “really liked” me “...as a friend” and that Rachael “knew” she “wanted to hang out” with me “more often”. \n\nNow I’m completely over the Rachael thing, I can see things for how they were. I have no more feelings left for Rachael, as they were based on a false representation of who she actually was. Once the veil was lifted, I realised I felt nothing for the real person she was. To me, the good times feel like a nice dream I had with someone who didn’t exist. I’ve made peace with that part of my life and I am happy it’s over. I’m in a better place for it.\n\nI see how lovely June had been towards me the whole time, and how lovely she remains with me. I like she’s interested in women, and that she likes spending time with me. We have a lot in common, and have similar views on many things. She’s affectionate (openly through friendly touch, etc.) in the way I always wanted (and in ways Rachael would never be), and I like it when she’s affectionate in that way with me. We haven’t kissed or touched sexually. When she looks at me I know she likes me. It’s all very unspoken. \n\nHad I been given the chance and time to consider her or Rachael at the beginning, I would have wanted to peruse her - even if I didn’t know how my experience ended with Rachael. Even just knowing she was a lesbian in practice, and was as affectionate as she is, would have been enough for me. This would’ve been something I’d probably have found out through her quite quickly had I not even slightly distanced myself immediately after starting with Rachael. At that point, though, I didn’t know much about June on a personal level. \n\nCut to now, and it seems as though June is no longer feeling good she knows about what happened between Rachael and I. I wanted to be open with her from now on, so I told her she can ask me anything she wants about what happened with Rachael so I could at least somewhat try to make up for what I did. She asked me questions about who made the first move, and I was honest when I told her it was Rachael. She then asked a few other personal questions (none someone who was only a platonic friend would ask), and then thanked me for talking to her about it. A few days later I asked her how she was, and she said she kept replaying situations between us as a group, or between her (June) and I. Notice she didn’t mention anything about her and Rachael? It was just whenever her (June) and I were involved. \nMy guess is that if it really was more about Rachael being a shit friend, then she would be upset right now over their interactions, rather than the ones only involving me and her.\n\nShe is distanced from me, even though I’ve told her I feel horrible for not telling her. I’ve tried to be as supportive and caring as possible (given the circumstances), but I’m not getting much back. She just seems quite “flat”. I know she’s hurting, but she isn’t being direct about it. \n\nI don’t know what to do. I do like her and I’d like to get to know her on that romantic level. It has nothing to do with Rachael. I’m not looking for a rebound, nor do I need one. It’s just a case of the stereotypical dating triangle when the asshole’s nice friend was the one I would have preferred all along. It’s just really sad I never had the opportunity to explore it prior to the whirlwind. \n\nShe is clearly quite upset by the whole thing (which I wholeheartedly understand), but hasn’t actually told me it’s because she is romantically interested. I also understand why she hasn’t - I wouldn’t tell her if he roles were reversed, either. I’d like to tell her how I feel, but I’m not sure how to do it - or whether I should do it. I’m concerned that maybe I’m reading it wrong, or she will see this as a way of me getting back at Rachael (even though I am certain it’s not, I’m almost certain she won’t, and she knows that’s not the kind of person I am). \n\nI’ve never been in this kind of situation, so I don’t know how to handle it while conserving her feelings and not wanting to hurt or upset her any further than I already (unintentionally against my own wishes) have. I really care for her, and all I want to do is kiss her and have those moments with her I’ve wanted for a while now. \n\nBecause we got to know each other through our friendship, I’ve been able to see her as she is. I had fleeting thoughts about how lovely she was in my rational moments when Rachael and I were broken up for a few days or a week, but they quickly disappeared once I was back into the Rachael cycle. I didn’t really think too much about those thoguhts, as they were fleeting in those moments and weren’t around enough to “mature” into what I am starting to feel now that the other stuff is over. The issues with Rachael were not, by any means, caused (or even contributed to) by those fleeting thoughts, or any speckle of “infidelity” (or suspicions of) on my behalf. Rachael and I ended because of Rachael and I, and it had nothing to do with June. I also didn’t subconsciously try less with (or behave differently towards) Rachael because of these fleeting thoughts. I’m sorry if this seems a little like I’m trying to convince myself (which I’m not), I just want to make that part clear because I don’t want anyone to assume it did, or focus on something irrelevant. \n\nThis has been continuously playing on my mind, and I don’t know what to do. The only thing I can think of is to tell her I like her, but it feels “forced” because she’s distanced herself. I feel I should wait for her to “come back” once she has fully processed everything, but I’m concerned she may think I don’t care. If she doesn’t think I care, I’m worried she may not think there’s anything to “come back” to. \n\nI’m at a loss between being concerned about being seen as either too “pushy” or like I don’t care. \n\nQuestion:\n\nShould I tell June about how I’m feeling towards her, or should say nothing else and I wait for her to “come back” (if she does) and then see if it naturally progresses? \n\ntl;dr:\n\nI was involved (with Rachael) in lesbian love triangle which was (against my wishes) kept secret from the third vertex (June). Rachael and I ended, so I told June about it because I wanted to be honest. June is now upset, and seemed to have liked me from the beginning. I now also like June, and would like to get to know her romantically. Do I tell June this, even though she’s still distant and hurt by what I told her?",

I feel like my past experiences are nothing compared to yours because I only experienced hatred and emotional abuse from my NMIL for only 2 years, and it wasn't even that severe. I only endured small things like \n\n1) Being told, \"Nobody is good enough for our son\" \n2) False accusations \n3) Being ignored/excluded \n4) Being told that I have to be like them to be accepted, and then once I try being like them they still hate me. \n5) Constantly criticising/judging/belittling me \n\nThat's all I will list for now, but there are more. Now to ask my question. Fast forward to today. I have transfered to a new university. I got into a couple of groupme chats with a couple of my classes so we could help each other. In class A I was talking to them about how I was upset that our TA forgot to email my grade for my lab report. I sent a message at 5am and apparently woke one of them up on accident. He got mad and cussed me out. It scared me so I left the group. \n\nIn class B, one of the girls asked what one of the questions for our essay meant. I replied that I was only answering the first one. She got mad at me and yelled that the question she asked was the first one. Again, I got scared and left the group. I felt scared in both of these situations feeling like those two students were hostile towards me. \n\nAm I being overly sensitive (due to past abuse)? Or were these two students actually being hostile? ",

There was a botched first attempt last week, where I had to report the counsellor because we had a 25 minute session instead of at least 45 minutes, when my employer is paying for 6 sessions of 45 minutes - 1 hour. I ignored the red flags and the feeling of being rushed because I thought I was being avoidant again and looking for reasons to quit - upon talking to a close friend who is using the same company sponsored programme, she convinced me to report it. The counselling coordinator was upset about what had happened, apologised profusely and reassigned me to a different counsellor.\n\nYesterday I went there with my summary notes and read them to her while she listened and noted things of her own. It took me 20 minutes to get through it (my notes are long because it's taken me literally years to get to this point).\n\nShe then spent thirty minutes discussing some of the points I made, questioning me to get me to open up a bit more, and validating my feelings. She accepted without question that I am NC with my Ndad and the rest of the FOO, which I was so grateful for as I know some people on here and the justno subs have had therapists pull the faaaaamily card.\n\nI still can't believe how well it went, how calm I felt and how much I talked (I am very introverted, but I become very bubbly and talkative around people I am close to, so basically my husband, 2 friends and my cats).\n\nShe did give me some homework though: \" You were controlled and emotionally abused for the first 27 years of your life. You have already come so far in the 1 and a half years since you cut contact. You can stop beating yourself up about 'not progressing fast enough'. You got away from the toxic environment. You are no longer in survival mode, you can slow down now. \"\n\nI actually giggled when she said that, because my DH has been telling me that for the last few months. They are right though. I have been beating myself up about not being \"recovered\" yet, even though I logically know that's not how it works, and this will be a long term healing process. By giving mental space to these thoughts and worrying about how much time I'm wasting trying to \"fix\" things, I'm actually preventing myself from moving forward and making actual progress.\n\nFor the first time in about 8 months, I am feeling hopeful about the future and looking ahead to better things.",

I’ve always done so when I found it to be ‘important’, but kind of let things lesser things slide or ignored them. \n\nThings like:\n\nA long-time (and long-distance) acquaintance that I’ve never met in person making somewhat inappropriate comments about how close we were and how important he thinks he is to me. I’ve always just let it go by in order to not embarrass him. I told him today that I didn’t like it and that comments such as those felt possessive.\n\n“I don’t want anything from you! Geez, forget it!”\n*****\nA man that I had briefly flirted with and started texting. He pulled that thing where he made tentative plans but didn’t confirm when asked. I didn’t care because I’m also putting into practice ‘don’t invest too soon’. Then he pops up again a week later with a “Hiiiiiii” and I simply respond with “Hey :) What can I do for you?”. He tried to brush off the disappearance and asked if I wanted to do something that afternoon but I called him out on it. “Thanks but I’m not really a last minute date girl, especially since our first attempt was a bust”\n\n“Hey give me a break! I’ve been sick all week. I’m doing my best here!”\n\n“It’s fine, I’m just letting you know that if you’re interested in someone, you need to actually show them that you’re interested, and not disappear for a week”\n\nHe then disappeared :D\n*****\nAnother man that I met at work but had no interest in personally, found out that I had just moved into his neighbourhood, started to talk to me about things like ‘when we have sleepovers’.

They all got pissy and defensive instead of apologetic.\n\nIt’s an interesting phenomenon when you see the same types of behaviour, and get the same type of reaction when you put your foot down.\n",

One problem I am facing is that my ex has lied about me and things involving the breakup. She claimed I was the reason why she couldn't do certain things she wanted, when I told her we needed to be honest and upfront with eachother. I really am fine with these people hating me and saying things about me behind my back, because I know who I am as a person. But one thing that is bothering me is I depend on one of these people for my career (they are a reference). There are lots of things that they don't know, and to be honest I don't want to tell them because I don't want to stir up drama, and the past. I am doing my best to take care of myself and avoid my ex and the flying monkeys. The issue is that this person that is my reference I believe is a flying monkey. I have tried to address them and even asked them if I can count on them, but I really don't think I can. This person I am referring to is a good person, but she is the kind of person who has her mind set on something she can't be reasoned with. There have been instances where people have talked to her about things and she couldn't admit simple things. In the past when I tried to talk about things that bothered me when we worked together I have just given up because she is someone who can't be reasoned with. I have been trying to change specific details slightly from reality in multiple accounts because I am scared that my ex and her flying monkeys will attack me and potentially ruin my career. I still am unsure if my ex was a narcissist, and I don't care to label her but I do know that she was quite emotionally abusive. I have mixed feeling about her because I am don't think it is her fault that she was emotionally abusive if that makes sense because of her past. I don't think she even knows how she was emotionally abusive.\n\nTLDR- My ex (potentially narcissist) has flying monkeys one of them is a reference of mine, and I am worried that I am ruining many job opportunities by having her as a reference. I have done my best with no contact, and getting the help I need. One thing that is really bothering me is that I have talked to my reference multiple times asking if I could trust her as a reference and I still don't know if I can.\nCan't tell if I should take the risk of trusting her or just cutting my losses and starting all over again. \n",

        "text": "Long story short, my mother was abusive/neglectful/somehow also helicopter parenty/competitive/jealous/controlling my whole life. I told her that I would not have any sort of a relation with her unless she got a diagnosis and a therapist told me she was capable for change. \n\nI spoke to her therapist for about an hour, reading her a list of all the horrible things my mother has done. She empathized and was horrified at my mother's actions. I thought she understood. \n\nHere is the list I read and explained to her:\n-Calling me a bitch\n-never protecting me from being abused by the rest of the family; abusing me herself\n-barging into my room without knocking over and over again \n-constantly wearing my shoes \n-wearing my clothes \n-hair pulling \n-putting me in a psych ward, never apologizing, after my bf broke up with me she said I needed to focus on myself \n-telling me I'd be nothing without her \n-calling me 500 times when I'd be out \n-always expected me to fix our \"fights,\" even when I was a child. She'd give me the silent treatment. \n-first suicidal thought at about 7 years old after a fight with her, what could she have possibly said that would make me want to die \n-extreme depression and suicidal ideation since I was a child \n-telling us as kids that one day she'll leave and never come back\n-being absent yet also being a helicopter parent. Never was emotionally nurturing, don't think she knows how to be. \n-everything was always about her. My emotions never mattered. Hers came first. \n-always had her nails and hair done but would put up a fuss when I asked for necessities such as bras, underwear, socks. \n-she always did express a need for admiration and a need for validation\n-always obsessed with her appearance, passed that trait onto me. \n-was always competitive about our weights, would make jabs at me and my weight. Commenting on the food I was eating, how my rings fit (as in my fingers were fat)\n-moved bf in without telling anyone, got married and didn't tell me \n-she would always blow up and freak out, showed little ability to control her anger. \n-threats like \"if I find this object you lost, you're going to get it\"\n-threatened to call the cops on me if I wouldn't call her \n-threatened to sell my car if I wouldn't call her \n-denying the abuse\n-being pushy when she came to visit \n\n\nI asked her for an update on my mom and she sent me this email:\n\nHello Sushisavage,\n \nI hope this email finds you well. After further discussion with your mother, and careful consideration of both your points of view in this situation, I would like to suggest that the relationship between the two of you is perfectly resolvable, should you chose to do so, and for a number of very important reasons. First of all, and as I related to you before, I cannot diagnose your mother with a personality disorder since her behavior towards you, as you have described it, is not a pervasive characteristic of your mother, particularly since she is able to maintain positive relationships with other family, friends and co-workers without major complaint or interference in anyone’s overall functioning. As well, unlike people with personality disorders, your mother is able to show remorse, desire for more insight (so that she can understand and meet her daughter’s current needs as the daughter has defined them), and most importantly, demonstrates the ability to modify her behavior—again, none of which are characteristic of a person with a personality disorder. Finally, the behavior I have observed in session, and that has been reported to me by both her and you, appears to be, at least at this point, within the normal limits of over-protective maternal behavior towards a child in college. This is not to discount how her behavior negatively impacted you in the past, but rather represents a place to start as you move forward in your relationship—whatever form that takes.\n \nWith that in mind, I have let your mother know that you are particularly concerned that your privacy always be respected regardless of the level of contact between the two of you. It is my understanding that since that discussion I had with her, your mother has maintained minimum contact with you. As well, she has been there for you whenever you have needed any immediate financial support, and despite any rage you may have towards her. With that in mind, I would also like to caution you that: to continue to seek financial support from your mother without also interacting with her in other positive, healing ways will appear exploitative on your part. This would also be contrary to your desire to live freely and independently from her. The alternative to this, which is repair, can only be achieved through both of you coming together to discuss the ruptures in your relationship so that you can move forward with more understanding and less pain. However, I also know, and your mother too (now), that this may not be possible at this time in your life. Nevertheless, it will be important for you in the days ahead to communicate appropriately with your mother regarding the kind and level of contact you are comfortable with right now, so that your mother can continue to make progress in her understanding of your adult needs. I am hoping that some day there can be healing, as this is the whole point of trauma therapy! My own professional concern for you moving forward would be regarding the treatment you are currently receiving. It is important for you to be aware, as a consumer of mental health services, that evidence-based treatment for trauma is not supposed to last three years. Even should it be profoundly helpful for you to process your experiences over a much longer period of time, I am still perplexed that none of your more severe symptoms of trauma have been alleviated, or coping skills identified and practiced. I might suggest that you consider seeking a trauma specialist. I wish you all good things in the future, and thank you very much for your consideration of some of these ideas.\n \nYours, Brainwashed Unprofessional Therapist\n\n\n\n\nI showed this letter to my therapist and she nearly had a heart attack. She validated me that this email was incredibly unprofessional, victim blaming, brainwashed, and judging me/my life/overstepping boundaries/shitting on my life basically. I asked for an update on my mother, not to be told that it's my fault I was abused as a child and that I'm not handling it correctly. I thought it was crazy how easily she was convinced by my mother that I was the problem, and how she listened to her, and absolutely shat on my life and my treatment plan without even knowing me. I'm in talk therapy by the way and I love it. I've enjoyed my three years with my beloved therapist. My counselor also validated me that it is characteristic of personality disorders to charm and manipulate when people get too close to finding out the truth. \n\nBtw, my mother has been thought of to be this way by other people, and even though she's \"showed remorse\" and \"promised she'd change,\" she never did. \n\nI just can't believe this fucking lady critiqued me and judged me and my life and recovery like that.

I became anti-authority, hating my parents while secretly wishing they would get better and be the parents I wished they would be.\n\nI was nelectfully raised by my mother, she always had someone else take care of me so I think I had a unique experience growing up where I was rarely talked to. If I did something wrong my babysitters would expect my parents to solve it and if my parents saw me do something wrong they didn't do much. Sometimes they would yell at me or punish me but perhaps out of guilt I was usually not held accountable for my actions other than my mom getting a sick pleasure out of punishing and humiliating me. I knew if I just asked for something enough times I would probably get it. I was very spoiled and catered to. I was also very lonely. I believed that I couldn't depend on anyone because there was no one in my life who was interested in anything I truly felt. So I learned that there was no reason to talk to anybody, I believed that all people wanted was to use me for a fun time so I gave up being a good person and gave them what they wanted so I could use them, too. I became manipulative and self-pitying because I was desperate for the attention my parents weren't giving me.\n\nI have no friends and when I'm around other people I feel uncomfortable (afraid and irritated at the same time) so I spend most of my time (95%) alone. Literally, if I am not at work I can go days without speaking to people other than shop clerks and weeks without a meaningful conversation.\n\nI want to say its because of my neglectful parents and I do believe that is the cause of my inability to attach/connect with others, but I see my part in making it worse over the years. The friends I let slip away out of carelessness and opportunities that I avoided out of my own self hatred and wishing to hurt my parents by hurting myself so they could see what a shitty job raising me they had done.\n\nAll the things I now understand and wish I could tell my younger self like go to art school and believe in your talent. Don't date abusive men just because the abuse feels comforting. That drinking and doing drugs are a waste of precious time, money , and energy that you could be focusing on to do something productive instead.\n\nPeople who know me say I'm sweet, very quiet, and keep to myself. I was surprised because all my life I believed my parents when they complained about me being a mean person. I think they were projection their own anger onto me then taking pleasure in punishing me.\n\nSo any advice on how to move forward and be more social?\n\nTL DR: I know in order to be mentally healthy i need people I can rely on, so how can I go from being completely antisocial to thriving?",

I didn’t think there was anything wrong with this because I thought that was normal. \n\n\n\n\n\nSome things that bothers me about the incident though is that when we were sleeping, there were times when he would put his hands under my shorts and touch my butt. I don’t know what other word to use here. It felt good because of the warmth and plus I was too young to discern anything at all. This has happened more than multiple times and he would usually go to sleep like this with his hand placed there.\n\n\n\n\nDo you think this was incest done by my father when I was young? He never did any overt sexual acts on me, even though while growing up, he was an extreme narcissist and he used to stare at me as a teenager which used to creep me out even as a “male”. One incident I recall few years before he passed away was between him and one of my younger cousins who was visiting us after a long time. As I walked into his room, I saw my younger cousin shirtless on the same bed as my dad. I was quite surprised to see this and I never talked to my cousin or my father about this. It did not seem like they were having sex, but extremely weird to see my own cousin “shirtless” in the same bed as my father. I am still not sure what to make of this.\n",

I started standing up for myself and also not letting her trash talk my mom like she always had when my mom did nothing but support us.  \n\nI found keeping my family and friends separate and keeping quiet / not invoking her, the distance and controlled contact would be enough to keep my relationship with the kids.\n\nThen she started dating my male best friend and getting into my social circle. The lies started rolling and she was always angry at me. I told my best friend that our relationship couldn’t be the same because I didn’t want to get into the middle. \n\nShe was mad at me for distancing myself from him. Then she got mad at me for distancing myself from him. But she would also get mad at me for calling him or texting. \n\nShe would take his phone and call me if she found texts of him venting about her to me, talking about leaving her. (which I generally didn’t respond). Then she told me I am not allowed to talk to him. They eventually had a kid.\n\nFast forward to last year. I had enough. I decided to go no contact knowing full well I couldn’t see or talk to the kids in the meantime. All I wanted was for her to be treat me like a human being or be a tad bit remorseful. But I know I can’t expect it as well.\n\nAny time I had a chance to talk to them over the phone through my mom, she would tell the kids that they aren’t allowed to talk to me or would curse me out in the background and then yell at my mom for letting them talk to me.\n\nAfter 8 months she reached out about visiting for Christmas. I decided I wanted to go and see the kids. I did and she was right back to being mean and saying snarky things. I had fun with the kids but my nephew is definitely seeing the full weight of the narc Mom now and showed it.\n\nI told him again I am always there and my home is always open. \n\nI left that day and that was that. \n\nIt has been a month since I have spoken to her. I decided to reach out since my nephews and nieces birthday are coming up. I asked my mom for her number. My mom asked her and she said no.\n\nI have no idea what the reason might be, but I want to make amends he beat I can to be apart of their lives again. \n\nI don’t know what to do or how to handle it as my previous way of handling it was keeping quiet and letting her go in her narc ways. How can I keep things smooth or slightly smooth so I can continue to be in their lives? ",

        "text": "I apologize for the lengthy message I am about to write. I just need some help or insight to all of this, I have read some books and this is pretty close to a name for what I have been through.\n\nMy ex and I were together almost 8 years and share a child together. All 8 years was an emotional roller coaster. It started when I found out I was pregnant and refused an abortion which sparked this 8 year \"relationship\"...more so a bad roommate with occasional benefits. My whole pregnancy we were off and on and when I was about 7 months pregnant he had his best female friend \"sleep over\" after a long night of drinking. Then there was another female friend he would meet at the college to see. All of their messages were how unhappy he was and how happy she could make him. Then we split up when my child was 2, he was seeing another girl and we got back together around Sept/Oct they were still conversating and she sent him many pictures of her Halloween outfit to him. \nThere was always someone else in the background but never enough information to say he was cheating. His phone always had a password, he would make calls all hours of the night, his texts would be erased but I always had a gut feeling. \nSince 2014-2015 we have been steadily on the rocks, not really talking just taking care of the kid and working opposite shifts from each other. I never wanted to plan holiday trips or anything because every holiday was a nightmare. Nothing was ever good enough for him or there would be this insane argument started over something so minnutte I couldn't actually process what was happening. I have lived stepping on egg shells, battling depression and emotionally eating, drinking and smoking to deal with all of this.\n\nWe work seasonally at the same restaurant and there have been quite a few females that he has different relationships with I suspect. He always make me out to be jealous and controlling but to see their interactions or conversations with each other you would have to be nuts to not believe something was going on. \nHe said he would go to the gas station but be gone for hours. It's literally 0.4 miles away. He would go out on his longboard or paddle board and be gone for a day or so no contact at all... I would have to take our child in the car and ride around trying to find him, fearing the worst had happened.\nOne evening, he and I were going to spend together at home so I put our son to bed and we were watching a movie. He said he was going to the gas station to get beer and he would be right back. 3 hours later I finally call him and he was on the other end of town with one of our mutual friends wife.\nHe also spent time with this same wife when my son and I went out of town for a wedding, he said he was hanging out with her and her husband but it later came out that the husband was at home watching their child. I finally found out they were seeing each other after he moved out and she was my closest friend. We raised our children together, took turns watching one another's child, we hung out with her and her husband and his family on holidays because we didn't have any close by. I was absolutely devastated.\nWe finally split up in may, I planned a disney trip for my son in March and asked if he wanted to go and he declined, so I continued with the trip planning. At the end of April when I received our bands in the mail he started an argument and wanted to go and I told him no. He moved out 2 weeks later.\nHe has been to jail a few years back for domestic violence and endangerment of a child, however I had no family and no way to support myself so I dropped the charges. I had to write a letter and go to classes but the thing was he was allowed to call me from jail even with a tpo on him, I was allowed to get him out of jail even before charges were dropped. Definitely doesn't give me confidence or protection.\nHe would take adderall when he drank so he could drink more without getting sick, he did drugs occasionally but never would tell me until after the fact. One night he came home so drunk he could not stand and started an argument then began punching himself, ramming his head into the wall and cutting himself. I literally stood outside for hours trying to get anyone on the phone to come get him because I knew he would go to jail or be baker acted, no one answered. So I stood outside frozen in fear that when he gets tired of hitting himself is he going to go after me or my child sleeping in the other room. I kept weighing put whether I should leave my child and go get help or could I get my child and get out fast enough. I finally went and cleaned his wounds, gave him Tylenol and water and slept with him out of absolute fear of my life.\nI was going to therapy, for ptsd and she rx'd things for me to take but I lost my job along with all of my insurance benefits so I can't go anymore.\nHe is seeing a co worker now at the place we both work seasonally. He says she's a permanent fixture in his life, he went all out for Valentine's day for her but didn't get his child anything. He would never take any pictures but yet she has taken many pictures of them. He is the polar opposite with her that he was with me. It's maddening, I'm so hurt and I really don't understand. He walked out of out family to persue this relationship with her it turns out, he has introduced her to our child without even discussing it. He only calls to talk with our child occasionally and in the summer he went weeks without seeing or talking to him. We don't have a custody agreement or child support so nothing legal really regarding my child and his care. \nI just need help, I am just as hurt now as I was when he left in May. I'm angry and sad all the time. Confused, shocked. I really don't know what to do",

        "text": "My sibs and I grew up with Nparents. They divorced when my youngest sib was 10 and Nmother’s second husband was also emotionally abusive towards my youngest sibling. I got a lot of therapy, became a shrink, live far away from everyone because, well... N family. Sibs... ended up with FLEAS. In youngest sib’s case, she’s an enabler and a pleaser who will give in to any slight pressure if it stops anger or disapproval. \n\nFast forward a couple decades and change: My youngest sib has two kids and has been married for fifteen years. The marriage is over. Sib’s spouse gaslights, manipulates, controlled Sib’s finances for several years (He’s a gold-bug survivalist type), and has been having this relationship with another person that makes my sib feel emotionally abandoned and cheated upon, but which Spouse and the friend swear is not an affair. Any attempts to communicate about that relationship are met with both of them calling my sib paranoid, insecure, petty, and so damaged by our parents that Sib is incapable of recognizing friendship. He also does a lot of performative social media behavior, like posting about how he’s doing these self-improvement things while mentioning that he’s avoiding “negativity” and “can’t make everyone happy”. (Note that he never mentions his children or his spouse in any of his social media. Not once in 15 years.) The other person also swipes at my sibling on a regular basis, but it’s all Southern and passive-aggressive and calculated to hurt, while remaining plausibly deniable.  (Let’s see, there’s also the extensive violent, racist and misogynistic tattoos that took money out of their limited household budget, refusing to allow my sibling to continue her education, insisting on building an expensive house in the middle of nowhere as a means of controlling my sib and their children, letting his “friend” move into their first house, purposely working swing shifts for several years so he never had to interact with his young children, refusing to contribute to household maintenance chores or childcare until after he moved out, and is now documenting that he’s doing All.The.Driving and Instragramming everything he cooks as a means of showing he’s the more deserving parent.) He wasn’t a daily, all the time monster, but he’s been consistently selfish for years. \n\nMy sibling is just getting to the point of realizing that he’s a train wreck and has just realized that the divorce is coming and sib needs to fight for her side and the children. But she’s only just realizing that she’s trained and been trained to accept their judgements as truth, when they’ve been gaslighting her. \n\nI’m looking for media - preferably podcasts, audiobooks, or other AV media because sib doesn’t have a lot of time for reading right now - to suggest to help sib learn to recognize what she’s experiencing and how to work against it. I’m her sibling, so I’m not objective. (I think he’s a worm and far beneath her, but the heart wants what it wants.) Sib is at the beginning of this journey. I’m encouraging her to get a lawyer rather than mediate this, to insist on equitable community property and support, to push to be allowed to move to be near her family, but that’s the legal side. She needs something to help her build and enforce boundaries and realize that she’s allowed her own feelings. \n\nThanks! \n\n\n\n",

This past weekend was filled with the typical bouts of rage with character attacks, projection and relentless blame-shifting. My birthday happened to be Sunday and she did not relent for 3 entire days leading up to it. It was a completely humiliating experience filled with the most hurtful, personal attacks I've experienced yet. \n\nI've been existing in a fog the past 6 months, up and down the roller coaster of I love you I hate you, usually at intervals of every 20 days. I am filled with an anguish I've never experienced before. In the past 2 months, when she chooses to really cut deep verbally or scream at me incessantly, I slip into uncontrollable sobbing, incapable of holding back tears / grief. It infuriates her even further to see me like this and she pummels me with her go-to list of all my emotional problems. I have no idea how I even got here emotionally and cannot make sense of the chronic emptiness I'm feeling. The shame I feel of her seeing me like this exacerbates it and I fight it so hard every time until the floodgates open, I've ended up hyperventilating a few times and even passed out in her presence. \n\nI have tremendous anxiety at the thought of just up and leaving, no closure, no comprehension if she was ever really genuine, what I could of done differently. I see the writing on the wall, I keep reminding myself these occurrences and her behavior are based in fact, I listen to the times I had recorded her N rage on my phone to stop the repeated gas lighting. But I still long to be enough for her",

        "text": "I feel like I'm a case study. I just found this part of Reddit and I don't know what to type first.\n\nI have a few immediate sort of areas I want to talk about:\n\n1) Explaining to young children about grandparents that you have no contact with\n2) Mother not respecting No Contact with nFather\n3) What do you do if you run into them or unintentionally cross paths?\n4) How do you stay strong?\n\nExplaining to young children about grandparents that you have no contact with. \nDo you wait for their inevitable questions? (\"But mama, who is your dad?\" etc) I generally am really upfront with my kids and believe in giving them 100% truths that they're able to handle at their particular development. I sort of want to address it before he figures out that he doesn't know who my dad is. They've met but my children are 2 and 4 and don't remember.\n\nMother not respecting No Contact with nFather\nI've been no-contact for almost 2 years with nFather. This was a year after he and my mother split up for many, many full-on N-type behaviours. I'm overall pretty pleased with this NC arrangement, and while I think about him I don't miss him or his involvement in my life in any way. No-contact was relatively easy to initiate since I was living +5,000km away. \n\nMy mother seems to continually provide information about my life (mostly my children) to nFather. I have tried discussing it calmly, and very firmly. Even angrily, since anger resonates with her (at least temporarily) after having been treated horribly by nFather for 3 decades. It's infuriating that she is still drawn to him and harbours no resentment like I do. I used to get mad and ask her to just not talk to him. Now I just say, fine, you're going to talk for some unknown reason, but just please don't ever, ever talk about me or the kids. But she definitely does. We'll be together and I see his name come up on her phone so she ignores it. Good news is my son is old enough now he'd tell me if he noticed that mom was doing facetime or something. She definitely sends him pics. Side note - she was visiting and we both have apple watches. It was a gift from her late brother, so ours look exactly the same. I accidentally took her watch and went to look at a text on it and instead saw a text from nFather and was super confused. I could see a whole convo where they had a little secret code for whenit was \"clear\" for a phone call. Also a text about how proud he would be of me with this musical thing I was in, which I hadn't done since high school. The whole thing made me want to puke. I didn't know how to bring it up with mother so i just quickly put her watch back and found my proper one. Just took it as proof that i cannot trust her with regards to him.\n\nWhat do you do if you run into or unintentionally cross paths?\nRecently moved to be closer to \"home\" after living away for many years. Thankfully haven't run into nFather. I can't imagine what it will be like, since I hate confrontation. I imagine it will be this whole big fake thing and my 4 y/o will have a lot of questions after about who that was. He will be with his gf and be pretending that things are normal and in my dismay I might pretend the are too. Then he will say some guilt-inducing things? No idea. Can I just ghost him, nod and walk away? Gah I'm dreading it but it's inevitable to happen at some point. I need to have a plan so I don't make small talk and pretend things are strangely ok; I don't want him to have the satisfaction of controlling the moment.\n\nHow do you stay strong?\nWhen holidays and birthdays come around I sort of mourn the idea of a father that other people seem to have. I feel guilty, like, thinking of things that happened that were good in my childhood, that I should give another chance. That maybe my mom is right that I will regret this when he's gone, that I'm his only child, etc. But then other times I'll remember something that I didn't have any point of reference for as a child but now seems completely insane. Like when he'd come to my Jr High at random times to make sure I was wearing a headband, because he didn't like my bangs and was forcing me to grow them out. I'm very happy with the no contact and we are both stubborn so its not as though he will make the first move. If he did reach out - which he *may* now that I'm living so close - how do I make the decision to keep up the No Contact? It wasn't a real deliberate no contact, just a fade out, then a half-hearted attempt at contact on his birthday or father's day, then just radio silence which has actually been a relief.\n\nSorry this is so long. Thanks for staying with me.",

        "text": "Backstory: \"dated\" a 30 year old virgin for 8 months off and on. He is my coworker and we share an office. He kept dumping me (34F) every two weeks but each time he came back I felt for his lack of experience and tolerated way too much. I was very patient and kind to him, especially considering he had erectile dysfunction. Ugh. I know. But again, he was inexperienced, so thought this could be improved. And my feelings were at the time very real.\n\nLast time he dumped me was last week of November -- by email. A few hours before a show we were supposed to go to together. A show I decided to attend anyways and where my drink was drugged and I was left with a concussion (hospital drug test and all). His reaction to that was actually to tell me all the things he disliked about me.\n\nI went away for a month over the holidays. I was very hurt. Physically and emotionally. I get back and I obviously want nothing to do with him, but it's isolated to him. He meanwhile has decided I should be blackballed and I now have to deal with a group of four former friends who mysteriously now deny my right to exist and have friends in the office. No one has been willing to tell me what exactly he says, only that he says bad things about me. Again: he dumped me and I have a concussion. But he's the one who's butthurt.\n\nFortunately, I still do have friends there. Some old ones, some new ones. One of the new ones is 23 and he previously told me she was annoying. Now he is shamelessly flirting with her, staying late with her and generally just probably to gain another member to the blackball club or make me jealous. My one coworker I became really goof friends with (39F)  that he only knows through me (and who asked for my permission to remain friends with him) now will not look even look at me and literally THROWS herself into his arms when she sees him, right in front of me. She was the only thing I asked of him: please don't date her because she's my friend and that would hurt me.\n\nLike I don't care. But I'm still recovering from a serious concussion, and trying to deal with the aftermath of a toxic individual. I have cut all contact with the toxic segments in my office. Life is too short. I don't want to cut out the new girl because she's done nothing wrong but it's painful for me to watch and it's definitely not my place to intervene and warn her about him.\n\nTl;dr my ex has the emotional maturity of an immature 12year old and I don't know how to deal with this. Should I just be self-effacing and wait for his games to bite him in the ass? Or should I be more direct about the situation and make a stand against this kind of disrespectful behavior?",

She knows his children.  They've been together since at least October that I know of. Just this December he was telling me that he loved me. That he missed me. That if we where to try one more time we would work because we have both changed so much. He has changed SO much. He wouldn't take me for granted anymore. \n\nI called his bluff. I told him I'd go and spend the entire summer with him. He panicked. Told me it was a bad time. He would be out of town. Besides we just started talking again and I'm talking about staying with him? He wanted us to be solid before I was introduced to his children and family. He's been feeding me that line for 5 years. 5 years! I cut off all contact that day. \n\nYesterday i found out he has a girlfriend since October. And this new lady got to meet them already. And he had been keeping his new relationship from me. He told me his friends kept trying to set him up with an unattractive level 5 clinger who didn't get the hint he wasn't interested. That he didn't know how to turn her down anymore because she never got the hint. Her profile picture shows them both smiling happily. She looks like a nice girl. And here I am alone too traumatized to start a relationship with anyone. I'm so sad. I'm going to be alone forever.  \n\nI almost believed him. I almost fell for it. And now I'm a mess of tears.

Hoping for another outcome, trying to make any sense of any of it. &amp; wishing I had the balls to say more. Much much more. Wishing I didn't \"walk on eggshells\" to protect the feelings of these monsters. I can't wait until I'm driving alone in my car and not yelling and screaming at my Nmil and Nsil for the hurt and pain they caused my husband and I.... I cherish the days that do pass where I don't think of any of it. But the days where we're confronted with any of our relatives is hard. We never know what to expect and we both are immediately on edge...especially since we announced our pregnancy publicity and ya know \"put the rest of the family is a really awkward position\" because we're not speaking to my NMIL EFIL NSIL or NGMIL EGFil...and God only knows what they've told everyone else. I'm trying not to overthink but I can feel a difference in the rest of our extended family. It sucks, it hurts, and it pisses me off. We're pregnant and everyone's worried about how us not speaking to our in laws is affecting my MIL. No congrats, nothing. We're the monsters I'm sure. *insert giant eyeroll* my husband has not told them why he is not speaking to them so I'm sure they're all over there confused AF because \"what did I do?!\" Self awareness is not a trait ANY of them have. So everyone probably thinks we're just giant assholes and got whatever twisted fucked up version of their \"reality\" and that's why everyone isn't excited or happy about the new addition to the family. Again, making assumptions but normally we would've received a comment, like, txt, call...something from a few members but instead the comments we did receive just started another incident because we weren't considerate of how my poor MIL must feel.\n\nI know the hormones aren't helping.

        "text": "Oh my fellow acons, just when you think you've made some progress you discover something else that puts your brain in a bad place.\n\nThe first of two recent events was my phone booked which happens unfortunately regularly but the only backup was from a couple years ago when I was still on speaking terms with an ex fiance who I found out was an alcoholic and I realise now is very much a narcissist. Anyway I wound up sending a group text photo to my friends who are in his family comma since the rest of them are alright, and it included him in the group. He replied who is this. He has now on my number for something like 6 years. Trying very hard not to be hurt by this and failing. Trying very hard not to reply and that's why I'm posting because I'm really struggling between saying something and just leaving it alone.\n\nThe second thing was that I found out a second family member suffered childhood sexual abuse not from the abuser of one of my siblings. This family member told another family member in my generation hey person in my same generation who definitely knows better because they are not only my cousin's step parents but also they are a teacher at an elementary school. I also found out there was an ongoing domestic violence situation with another sibling in that extended family that was not addressed, which I understand given the situation, but the difficulty is the violent relative is mentally ill to the point of being institutionalized and now this same step parent refuses to provide any information to anybody in the family of the location of the institution despite the siblings and cousins and myself requesting the information since another sibling in that family had received a phone call asking why nobody visited or wroye. Apparently without telling me this step parent / teacher has cut me off as one of the people who requested to know where this person has gone and since I would hope to provide some comfort items at least as the institution is not very well funded because of the Canadian Healthcare system which talks great talk about mental health but frankly mainly medicates the mentally ill and provides treatment only for addicts not for lifelong hospitalizations such as this person requires. I also have issues with this because my parents attempted several times and once succeeded at having me committed involuntarily for disclosing their abuse. And so this one I really am struggling not only with the institutionalisation, but also with the attitude toward abuse and mental health in our family, as well as helping my relative to deal with her sexual abuse that she reported and her step parent did nothing despite being a mandated reporter but just as a human being if a child tells you they are being abused you need to do the right thing and at least check. So there's a whole tangle of issues there.\n\nThis has led to some events with my own siblings one of whom suffered sexual abuse and was not believed, and this is affecting everybody's relationship with my sibling and their children it seems to have triggered my sibling which is completely understandable but it feels like it's being taken out on people who tried to help even though we were all children and we were all ignored and abused, that it's a bit of an oppression Olympics situation with that sibling at the moment, with my siblings spouse playing gatekeeper to my sibling and the children such that it took almost 3 years just to get a current picture of the children since I don't live anywhere near them. \n\nI think it's no small coincidence that all of my family live very very far away from our parents and our aunt's and uncles. Which is the fourth issue, one of my uncles who is younger and did try to help us is currently being absolutely trashed as a bad person for choosing to go into low contact with the rest of the family. We are quite concerned that when my grandparent passes away in the next couple of years there will almost 100% guaranteed be a huge legal problem since already my grandparent has tried to give some property to different relatives and the relatives with control over her finances have insured the property was diverted or threatened her financially in order to make her comply period I also discovered this included driving her into the middle of the country and refusing to return her to her retirement home until she revealed the addresses of several of us who are no longer in contact and fortunately that situation was finally revealed and resolved but again I've had to change addresses and it has upset a lot of the people I'm still including in my family of choice since we all seem to have survived and overcome this truly awful family of origin staff.  Unfortunately the incident was not discovered until my grandparents told me by phone and I followed up with the authorities and happily there was no slip of information to the abusers but there is very little they can do because my grandparents understandably waited three or four years to report this and some other incidents and financial abuse is notoriously difficult to prove when the abuser has power of attorney and the victim is very with it but also very elderly and the abuser is a former law enforcement person who is extremely skilled at manipulating other law enforcement figures and actually obtained their university degree in psychology the better to be able to do this.\n\nAdd a bit of combat stress and frankly I'm a bit of a mess\n\nAnyway if you have read this far thank you for helping me get this off my chest. It is mainly event, but I could use some support about how to let go of the ex fiance pretending to Forget Who I Am incident since that was an accident but has brought up a lot of unresolved issues for which I'm seeking help but there isn't much help available on the weekend. As for the rest of it just hugs or good vibes would be appreciated, at least I've gotten far enough that I know the others need to work out their own issues and I am best off just being an ear for them as best I can handle, I'm just having some trouble understanding how much I can handle until it is too late and I am very triggered and angry on their behalf.\n\nAnyway hopefully you guys are out having a good Mardi Gras and if I don't respond right away it's just dealing with some traumatic stress issues and health issues I will be back in a while to reply.

Being this honest is really, really terrifying. \n\nI’m almost at a year of NC. My therapist tells me I’ve made progress. In 9 days I’ll contact my Nmother to talk, like I planned, and I feel like almost nothing has changed. I don’t allow myself to have a life. I’m still lonely. I don’t feel like I deserve anything, so I don’t give myself anything. I’m scared. Of the unknown, of being an adult. I feel like I’m fundamentally less than and I feel like everyone knows it. I have so much shame. My negative self talk(that originally came from my Nsister and Nmother) sabotages everything, and the worst part of it is that I’m not aware of it most of the time, so I can’t even fight it. \n\nMy therapist has to point out when it’s happening, and I sit there, like a 5 year old, asking her, dead serious: ”Wait, is that not true, am I not a terrible person?” I’m shocked that she keeps saying no, even after everything I’ve told her. I’m still shocked. I’m still figuring out all the ways in which I’ve been manipulated and how it’s affected my brain. I hate that and I judge myself for it. My therapist also has to point out when that is happening, the judging. Because I’m not aware of that half of the time either. \n\nI’m a positive person. I’m a fighter. I have high fucking hopes for 2018. I’m trying to reach all kinds of milestones. But sometimes all that fighting feels useless. I’m so tired, physically, mentally, all the time. I feel like I’m constantly fighting something that is going to win anyway. It’s like my core is ruined, and no matter what I do or how hard I try I’ll never erase those years and scars. I’ve missed so much already. I’m so scared of missing out on more. I want to live. \n\nSobbing now. Terrifying, being this honest. But it also feels good. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "I had a mostly sleepless night last night. I'm not sure I did the right thing. Just like the eggshells I used to walk on when I was married, I feel like parenting my children is a balance beam walk, with fiery pits on one side, and an acid lake on the other. No matter what I do, it's going to be wrong.\n\nMy 11yo daughter was talking about how her dad was giving her lots of gifts right now, and it made her angry, because it just meant that he was going to be mean again soon. When she started to get more upset, I told she was probably right. I said that lots of people like him do that sort of thing.\n\nI told her it was called the honeymoon phase, then showed her the power and control wheel. We went over it a bit, and she identified the behaviors that her dad has done to her.\n\nShe then said, \"does this mean I've been abused?\"\n\nI didn't answer her, because I wasn't sure how, and before I could figure it out, she exploded. \"I knew it! I promised myself I would never be abused, and now I am!\" She started to cry, and I told her it wasn't her fault. That she couldn't stop it. That it has nothing to do with her as a person, and everything to do with the choices someone else is making.\n\nShe then started to get angry about the abuse, and started talking about how her dad was a horrible person. I told her I wasn't going to talk badly about her dad, that he had a rough life, that he acted that way because he was raised that way.\n\nThe conversation went on from there, and eventually I got her calmed down enough to sleep.\n\nBut I'm left with mixed feelings. It breaks my heart to go through what I've come to think of as the Awakening from abuse: that phase where you suddenly realize what you've been going through, that it has a name, and that it isn't just you being crazy, that you have a legitimate reason to be afraid, and it's because of something someone is doing to you. Is *choosing* to do to you.\n\nThe anger breaks my heart. I wish she could have a dad she could love. An 11yo shouldn't have to process that kind of rage, to understand that deep level of injustice. I wish my choices hadn't made that a reality for her.\n\nI told her she was strong. That I'd already seen her strength and power. That she had the ability to get over this, and that some day she might not be so angry at her dad. She insists she'll never forgive him. I hope she does, because forgiveness isn't for him. It would be for her.\n\nFor all of us.\n\nForgiveness is what allows us to leave them behind in their morass of misery, and fly to the heights of what we are capable of. So I'm heartbroken. And proud. And scared about how he will blame me for all of this, once he finds out.\n\nShe said she's tired of pretending to like him.\n\nI'm scared for her safety, too.\n\nI wish I felt that I had the power to protect her. But all I can do is help her protect herself. I hope I did the right thing, showing her that she wasn't alone. I hope that teaching her the patterns won't come back to bite her or me. And I hope that someday, when she is ready, she does forgive.",

        "text": "I'm now 5 years NC with my Nmom, and 4 years NC with my GCsister. Other than a few passive aggressive actions that involved my wife, my Nmom has surprisingly respected my boundaries. My GCsister, on the other hand, does not. As my post history shows, she handled my request for space by bombarding me with voicemails that included gutteral screaming as well as obnoxious condescending advise on the importance of family. Soon after that I sent her an email going NC, and that's when the email campaigns began.\n\nIt has been interesting to note her evolution in manipulative tactics via email as the years have progressed. She started with the most hateful sort of shaming imaginable: \"I have no brother\", \"you're dead to me\", \"you're a coward\", \"you're a scumbag\", \"you're paranoid\", \"you're delusional\", \"you're a jackass\", \"you abandoned your family\", \"dad would be pissed off at you\" (he's dead), etc. She used my daughter's birthday to shame me for preventing them from having a relationship. She continued to use my dead father as her puppet in claiming that he believed I was more fucked up than our narcissistic grandmother. She has the delusion that she can speak authoritatively for my dad, as she previously told me how angry he would have been with me when I went NC with my Nmom. After a few years of this, she took a year off of harassing me after giving birth to an unfortunate child that will have her for a mother. More recently, she has since picked up with her crap in sending me pictures of her baby and telling me how much they both love me. When that went ignored, she attempted to shame me in a group email in response to a cousin of ours by saying how heartbroken she was without me in her life. I responded only to my cousin to wish him a happy new year, and completely ignored my sister's idiocy. Following that, I got a birthday greeting along with another picture of her kid and a guilt trip that I should miss her as much as she misses me (or else I'm \"horrible\"). When that went ignored, she returned to her tactic of comparing me to our narcissistic grandmother. The comparison amounted to my narcissistic grandmother's obsession with people's mistakes/flaws with my insistence upon \"carrying this further\" because I'm \"so consumed with hate\". She closed that email with a \"have a nice life\" and \"I'll always love you\". I wish I could believe that these are signs she is reaching acceptance of my boundaries, but that's simply not who she is.\n\nShe just doesn't fucking get it. I don't hate her. I don't hate my mom. I love them both, but they are poison to me. My life is peaceful and happy without them in it. I've grown and continue to grow as a person, and feel empowered to completely break the abuse cycle in my own family. My innocent little kids are not going to be scapegoats or golden children. My kids are going to get all of the unconditional love I can give to the best of my ability, and will get my apologies for any mistakes I've made as their father. I've made this motivation for NC abundantly clear to her, which she unfailingly ignores altogether. It makes me frightened for her own child that she appears to have no concept of making painful sacrifices for your children. In this way, she is truly her mother's daughter. Don't get me wrong: the NC isn't just for my children, but they are probably the largest factor involved.\n\nI want so much to just unload on her, and to rip open her narcissistic injuries that she is desperately trying to fend off by pulling me back into our family's abusive chaos. I want to tell her that she is a fucking loser who is clinging to a relationship that has become worthless to me. I want to tell her how nakedly transparent her pretense of love is as a mere disguise for her desire to make me suffer because she got no say in my withdrawal from our relationship. I want to tell her what a spineless coward she is in hiding from her true self, and constantly playing dress-up with these phony personalities she puts on to avoid feeling vulnerable. I want to tell her how unethical it is to ghoulishly seek narcissistic supply at the expense of other peoples' mental health, all the while conducting a mental health profession. I want to tell her that her claim of moral superiority as to what I should or shouldn't be feeling or doing is a big fucking joke. I want to share with her the horrible things our mom used to tell me about her behind her back (i.e. that she's unintelligent and emotionally weak). I want to tell her that upholding our mom's lies and denials of being an abusive monster isn't tantamount to loving her, and especially to remind her of the many ways she has espoused her complete and utter hatred of our mom. I want to tell her that she and my mom both failed in that I am happy and know my value, regardless of their efforts to make me feel inadequate and worthless.\n\nI obviously can't say all of this because it will mean breaking NC. And none of the above things I would say will agitate her narcissistic injuries more than upholding NC and continuously haunting her and my mother's psyches. More than anything, I just wish she could take these narcissistic injuries and examine them in therapy. I wish she could be brought to appreciate and understand where I am coming from, and perhaps take a healthier approach in attempting to reconnect our lives. She won't though. She's way too invested emotionally in being my mom's GC, and garnering all of the short-term rewards of narcissistic supply (which I fear is now demanded of her child). As was the case this week, I occasionally let my emotions get the better of me. I forget who she is, and begin to consider the veracity of her words. I begin to undermine my own purpose for having gone NC. I begin to think that maybe I am all of the things that she says I am. While I am fortunate to have my wife's support in these moments of weakness, I feel like I really need to get back into therapy. NC is a heartbreaking mindfuck. No matter how happy or peaceful my life has become, it doesn't change the fact that my humanity cannot come to grips with the reality that defines my family.",
