It would be a place with information and stats from research and big data to determine the best mod for the exact situation. And eventually each item would have stats that can be combined to your own biological stats you provide. In a sense you would be building a new you with reliable mathematical data. Please provide a link if you know of anything similar to this. Obviously this is a huge project, and this idea is more of the end goal. I would start the site as more of just an h+ blog, but I'm looking for people who are interested in the bigger concept, and who believe this would be an indispensable tool for the transhumanist future.

        "text": "Because my point may benefit from providing a bit of backstory, I'll start with a brief introduction. I am 28, autistic, and am without a colon or large intestine. I have a liver disease that will inevitably result in transplantation. I rely heavily on the advancements of modern medicine to lead a somewhat normal life. As for my profession: I am programmer, I deal mostly with OS development and Internet of Things type projects. Enough about me. I want to address a recurring theme within this community, point out a glaring stereotype that has already emerged, and perhaps offer a word of humble advice.  \n\nTo the outsider, which I would guess includes anyone not intimately familiar with the core ideals of the transhumanist collective, we are at the disadvantage of being a fringe oddity. We are those who choose to be weird and do unacceptable things to our bodies in the name of some bizarre ideology. The general attitude we possess towards this train of thought seems to be nothing short of apathetic. We assume that the opinions of others are inconsequential to our success as a community. I personally fear that this is inaccurate. Without understanding, man becomes afraid. When many men are afraid, they become empowered and lash out against the source of their fear. This is the behemoth that we, and many other struggling outsider groups, are up against. Without proper education, and careful individual representation, we risk having the technological advancements we hunger for struck down, ostricized, and banned. \n\nI'd like to elaborate, for a moment, on our 'careful individual representation'. The movement is young, and is still giving first impressions on a global scale. Say we purposefully dress in a threatening, militarized, alienating fashion (i.e., matrix trilogy knockoff attire), and tout ourselves as part of the superior transhuman movement. That image is burned into societal memory. We are not only a joke, but perhaps a wreckless (or worse, dangerous) sub-culture. In a world obsessed with terrorist witch hunts, this could set us back tremendously.  \n\nThe stereotype I had referred to previously is not this cocky matrix-fanboy. Its a general attitude that I'm not sure has a purpose in this community. It is the idle daydreamer. The armchair activist. I worry that too much time is spent building dreams upon dreams, rather than putting one foot in front of the other. I read a remark the other day that was something to the tune of \"we can't all be scientists or programmers\". Why not? We are all humans equipped with very similar intellectual faculties. If one can learn, so must the other. I firmly believe that the future will not be shaped (as strongly) by those in white coats on goverment payroll, but by hackers. Yes, hackers. I mean that in the purest sense of the word. Those who take apart, ask why, and rebuild to suit their needs. \n\nMy advice is to do your own assessment of what will be required of the transitional human. Will you seek out augmentation? Who will program these devices? Is it someone you trust? I would suggest that any and all members of modern society take up a programming language. It  *will* benefit you. It will seem impossible, out of your league, or even petty at first. Please stick with it. Learn all you can about available technology. Begin taking things apart and rebuilding them. Become a sponge for new, useful information. The combined brainpower of this community, when properly utilized, could do fantastic things. \n\nForgive me if at any point I came across as jaded, aggressive, or ignorant. If I have misunderstood something, please do me the kindness of correcting me. I welcome any and all criticism, it is the only way we progress. I feel very strongly that this is where I belong, and forever offer my services and technical knowledge to the advancement of our cause. Thank you. ",

Imagine that we can upload ourselves and download ourselves over an over again, and the vessel can change but the vital components of what we dub a \"person\" are transferred from vessel to vessel: it need not be biological.\n\nI'm not worried about overpopulation, I'm putting that aside.\n\nBut what about the day that all stars burn out, the universe as we know it is dark, energy is routinely distributed throughout the universe, so there's no way to efficiently harvest it. What about when everything else in the universe has experienced heat death and we have no way to keep up the means of production of immortality?\n\nAgain, not a challenge; I'd love for someone to explain how I've overlooked or misunderstood something and true immortality is possible.",

No longer would psychology solely focus on treating ill individuals and attempting to bring them to baseline. but now recognizes the need for psychologically 'healthy' individuals to enhance their happiness and well-being. I think this same logic should be applied to medicine, and soon.\n\nThe advancements in medical research are astounding and are already pushing the boundaries of \"positive medicine.\" Thync's neurostimulator, contact lenses that give superhuman vision, and nanobots that deliver drugs to specific targets are just a few examples of technology that already exists today. \n\nI have a strong hunch positive medicine field will exist in the near future. I would love to be one of the pioneering physicians to help bring it to fruition. Unfortunately, I don't have experience beyond my undying passion for revolutionizing what it means to be human. I do a lot of work in the mindfulness field, which I contend would fall into the positive psychology and positive medicine field in its own right, but I have little experience with advanced medical technology. \n\nRight now, the 'positive medicine' field is primarily research based. I think it's time we recognize the growth in this field and start heavy clinical research and eventually establish physician-run clinics that provide this service. I dream of a residency program where future physicians are trained in the physiology of human-enhancement, FDA approval and health insurance coverage of computer chips that monitor blood chemistry, nanobots that swim through our bloodstream and protect us from  disease, synthetic red blood cells that increase efficiency of oxygen delivery to tissues, and the myriad other possibilities that seem plausible within our lifetimes.\n\nIs anyone aware of physician researchers, or any major researchers within this field who may share the same vision? If you are familiar with the medical field, do you have any generic advice on where to start pursuing something like this? Who/which organization to lobby to? \n\nI want to be a part of this drastic and inevitable evolution, but I don't know where to start!\n",

        "text": "I see an issue here. Some of us believe that it is our destiny to become immortal. However, I believe that Immortality should *never* be the end goal of H+. I am religious H+ applies to me simply because there is no better label so far. I'm looking for that label.\n\nOne argument a religious Transhumanist might use is that if we weren't meant to play God, then He should not have left his tools lying around. I agree, up to a point.\n\nI believe that God gave us many gifts for us to use to simply *better* ourselves while still remaining human at heart. Cybernetic Augmentation and using Nanomachines to regenerate our cells faster than they die are two of the most realistic (and ethical) possibilities.\n\nI have a rather pessimistic view about H+. I do not believe that we are meant to \"ascend\" with technology. I believe that we must sacrifice parts of ourselves in order to survive in the face of overpopulation, climate change, pollution, or other disasters. In short; it isn't our destiny to ascend, but rather a more pessimistic necessity that we must accept in order to survive.\n\nI will embrace my future as part man part machine with my head held high. I will not be enthusiastic about it, but I will accept it as the necessity it is.\n\nI refuse to release myself from my human body, but I will augment when the need arises, and it will. When it does, however, I will not go to the extreme that most H+ers will.\n\nI do want to remain human at heart (literally or figuratively, depending on the circumstances), but if I am required to digitize my brain to survive, then I'll live out my life in misery.\n\nI will, however, saw off my arms and legs and replace my organs if need be; I will let nanobots repair my cells faster than they die. I will not clone another me just to harvest it's organs, partly because one of my dreams to discover a long-lost twin (if I have one), or to clone myself to have another me to hang out with. And I believe that human life is sacred.\n\nOur bodies are sacred, evolved in such a perfect way to how they are now, possibly guided by a being of far such power that is greater than any of us can even begin to imagine. This is our greatest gift as humans; and we must preserve ourselves as long as possible. However, death is inevitable, but if our own mistakes cause widespread chaos and destruction amongst ourselves to the point where our children and our children's children do not have a fair chance at living, then augmentation will be the answer.\n\n_____\n\nI have a friend who says that my beliefs do not match up with any Transhumanists, and that I should probably use a different label. However, Transhumanist (the H+ label especially) matches up pretty well, it's the group associated with it.\n\nWhat would be a better label for me? Are there others who share my beliefs?",

What if transhumanism get's so advanced that we get to the point that we are just brains hooked up to computers living a life of luxurious hedonism and humanity as a whole suddenly loses interest in exploring the galaxy. We found bliss and happiness right where we are. The simple explanation is that it's much easier to become a computer version of yourself than it is to explore the galaxy and all the other intelligent species think so as well. I don't know.

Imagine getting a retinal implant that increased the size of this, or in other words, expanded the high density region to more of the retina. Then you would not have to be looking directly at something to read it or notice the details. Why stop there? The next step would be getting 360 spherical vision all at high density.
