        "text": "For those of you who are not aware, r/FULLCOMMUNISM has been quarantined, effectively removing many of its privileges, and forcing you to click through a creepy screen that tells you about the crimes of communism before you access it.\n\nNow first up, it's obvious that many of us, including myself, don't really support the political stance of r/FULLCOMMUNISM, but I think if we're being honest we all know that isn't the point right now. Secondly a lot of people are going to say this is just extremely online bullshit, which, yes, in one sense of course it is. In another sense though:\n\nA) This is actually a bit of a precedent. There are surprisingly few moves by social media platforms and similar like Reddit against the left this blatant, and it's certainly Reddit's biggest and most open power move against the left that I'm aware of. It's questionable whether the internet ever was a wild west of freedom of speech, and it is certainly becoming less so, but as far as the corporate encroachment on that freedom of speech this is at least a little bit of a watershed.\n\nB) We are extremely online people, and there's something to be said about the value of fighting where you stand. Even though this is clearly VERY far from the most important thing happening right now, and we should all be organising around many important priorities, this is one of the few issues where trying to coordinate a response probably should start from Reddit.\n\nWho's got ideas?",

        "text": "I got this idea from the thread about the Kavanaugh hearing, after suggesting we all disown our horrible conservative relatives and piss them off to the point of having a stroke (flippantly, I should add - I know there's lots of reasons it's not feasible for many people to do this). A lot of us have chud parents or extended family and I saw several people struggling with watching them shit on Dr. Ford or hoot and holler about Brett Kavanaugh sticking it to the Democrats.\n\nI don't have it as bad as a lot of people. I have some chud grandparents and aunts and uncles who think Trump is turning this country around, have monstrous views on immigrants and LGBTQ people, and a lot of the selfish, entitled bullshit that comes with protestant boomer mindset. I don't see them often and they mostly keep it to themselves.\n\nOn the day of McCain's funeral, my boomer liberal parents came to visit and were just absolutely gushing about what a soaring bipartisan affair it was, quoting lines George W. Bush said, talking about how impressive Meghan was for saying Trump was bad. This follows a lot of the standard boomer bafflement at how I'm not saving for retirement, why I don't have health insurance, and inability to understand that none of my generation has any fucking money because it's all going right back out the door on rent, utilities, and debt.\n\nMy liberal dad grew up internalizing all the cold war propaganda and is constantly shitting on Bernie for promoting socialism, he considers him basically a mirror image of Trump, and now he's talking about how great Bush was by comparison. He downplays climate change. He keeps telling me to watch Rachel Maddow to find out what the Russians are up to. I don't even know where to begin, so I usually just try to change the subject, but it's harder as we slide further into hellworld and me and everyone I know are struggling to keep our heads above water.\n\nLike I said, there are people who deal with way worse. I dunno if anyone else will find this useful, but in the wake of these awful and traumatizing moments like Kavanaugh, or whatever mockery of basic human dignity is happening any given month, it's maddening being around family with disgusting views and not having an outlet to just out loud say they suck.",

        "text": "ACT I\n\nStarting in the 1980s and culminating in the 2008 financial crisis, the global economy began to meritocratize, and mediocre white men were slowly dethroned from their position of power and privilege. No longer did you have to be protected by unions and borders and the exorbitant salaries they provided for pulling a fucking lever to survive; with the advent of globalization, a PoC in Cambodia or Indonesia could find steady work making sneakers in one of the newly introduced \"sweatshops\" that was so derided by Bros. The pay wasn't great, and the working conditions left much to be desired, but for the marginalized, it was a godsend.\n\nThis triggered white, Logan Square hipsters so. fucking. bad. These male craft beer aficionados and the self-effacing women who enabled them (often sexually) couldn't stand to see the success of previously excluded groups and to realized they would now be forced to compete with a brown person halfway around the world who demanded 1/20 of their ridiculous, Wicker Park expectations. But at the same time, because they weren't Republicans so had to keep up appearances, these white hipsters tried to keep their vitriol against women and PoCs on behalf of mediocre whites like themselves indirect. Enter Bernie Sanders. Instead of explicitly attaching women and PoCs, Sanders, at least on the surface, went after the few white men who weren't mediocre, who actually earned their place in the global economy. People like (((jeff bezos))) and the (((koch brothers))), inventor of the dreaded open borders.\n\nBut even Sanders couldn't refrain from saying the quiet part loud at times, and his white hipster acolytes even less tactful. And when Hillary enters the picture, a woman who, unlike Elizabeth Warren or Nina Turner, is unapologetic about refusing to cater to their white sensibilities, all of the white patriarchal rage kept under wraps comes pouring out. They just can't resist.\n\nACT II\n\nOne of the major problems with the left is its narrative of the 2008 financial crisis, which is pretty much exactly the same as Steve Brannons. In this narrative (((the elites))) perpetrated a grave injury against )))the people((( that continues to require redress--witness the relentless white chimpouts in support of muh Glass-Steagall.\n\nIn reality, the 2008 crash, while bad, had a silver lining that complicates the story: America learned from it, and became more resilient as a result, ultimately emerging from the crisis stronger than ever--just not in the way leftists would like. A generalized attitude of risk-aversion became the norm, a narrowing of horizons and possibilities that the Left called \"capitalist realism\" but is more adequately just \"realism.\" People started saving. Businesses started paying their workers more sustainable wages. Millennials began to switch college majors from humanities, the pure sciences, and other underwater basket-weaving majors of \"intellectual curiosity\" to more lucrative majors like engineering and CS; they also began to shop at Wal-Mart instead of overpriced mom-and-pops, and even, with the advent of \\#MeToo, began to have less casual sex.\n\nAll this is great. America did get the financial reform it needed after the 2008 financial crisis. It just was not achieved by the political branches, but rather by the American people themselves.",

        "text": "Yesterday, Doctor Christine Blasey Ford spoke out. She talked about her worst nightmare to fourteen demons hellbent on silencing her. But she told her truth anyway.\n\nYesterday, Fourteen Republican senators said she didn’t know what she was talking about – a highly respected psychologist, both as a teacher and researcher. They claimed she couldn’t possibly remember her deepest trauma, that she must be wrong. Kavanaugh, the stumbling drunk, said it never happened. That was enough – he's rich and white and went to Yale. He can't do anything wrong. \n\nYesterday, Kavanaugh even lied about his drinking. He claimed he'd never been black out drunk. His gin blossoms sung a different tune, however. \n\nYesterday, the fourteen showed what a joke American justice is while trying to elect a devil. They lapped up Kavanaugh’s piss-poor lies. They slandered Doctor Ford. They grandstanded about how poorly the all-American wunderkind had been treated – loudly questioning what happened to civility and believing the rapist?\n\nYesterday is why my fire burns more red each passing day.
