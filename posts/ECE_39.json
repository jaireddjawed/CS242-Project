Hypothetically speaking, if an applicant's resume is not very impressive (queue asking for a friend bull shit), how much would self driven projects stand out in terms of applying for internships? And if so, what type of projects would be of worth? For example, if there could be a quantifiable value for each, would a coding project outweigh a hardware design project/vice versa assuming all else remains uniform? Side question, would working in a partnership or group be even more desirable? Thanks in advance!\n\nedit: spelling",

        "text": "I am really struggling with a problem for my Signals &amp; Systems class. I've never had the best intuition with series, and it's starting to come back to bite me.\n\nThe question asks to find whether the signal given by the infinite series of the function x(t-8k) (summed from negative infinity to infinity) is energy or power type (i.e., finite energy or power). In this case, x(t) is given by 5, for -2 &lt;= t &lt;= 2, and 0 everywhere else.\n\nClearly, the signal has infinite energy since it is periodic with T = 8. However, I am at a complete loss as to how to find the power of this signal using the definition, as I have a feeling it has finite power. My first instinct was that this was square wave, which I'm pretty sure it is, but I don't know how I can derive the power of this wave using the definition (e.g. not relying on V^2/R or some other predefined formula).\n\nCan anyone provide some additional clarity? This has been bugging me for a very long time. Thank you!",

I know a few people find that a bit weird as most people do EEng first and then maybe specialize in communications related topics. But anyways, there was obviously a decent amount of overlap between my program and EEng program at our school. Our program was more focused towards wireless digital comm, coding and information theory, and signal processing.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSince graduation, I pretty much took the first thing that came my way due to student loans and what not. I have been working as a software dev at bank here for the past year n half or so. Theres nothing wrong with the field, I just don't see myself doing this for too long and I miss the technicality that came with EEng. There are a few other issues too long to list here. I understand I made a mistake by getting complacent after finding a job and not actively trying to find something related to my field. But that being said, I wanna get back in the field and need some career advice and guidance. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI wanted to ask if its a good idea for me to pursue MEng. I know its not gonna be easy finding work even after doing MEng as all my work experience is in the IT field. I also have to keep the job market in mind when choosing my specialization. I cant decide if I wanna stick with communications, or go more towards electronics. The reason I this say is because of the all the jobs seem to be related to circuit design. I have a preference towards communications as my background is in it as well, but I like both programs. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**[This](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/graduates/courses/timetable/)** is the one program and the specializations it offers, and I would appreciate it if you could have a look and gimme some feedback regarding it and some of the stuff I mentioned above, or any advice for that matter. Is this a step in the right direction ? And how challenging is it gonna be finding a new grad position after doing MEng knowing that I dont have any relevant work exp. Thank you for taking the time reading all this, would really appreciate it if some of the experienced folks here could help me out, thank you again!",

My school's CpE curriculum allowed me to basically put off a majority of my EE courses until senior year, and I gotta say, I find it all a lot more interesting than software. Taking my first major EE lab course and each student is given their own bunch of equipment (oscope, DC psu, function generator, digital multimeter, breadboards, and more components than I know what to do with), and it's pretty damn cool. I can't get enough of it. MOSFETS, op-amps, scoping stuff, just messing around with it, it's really engrossing. Programming and CS, on the other, feels like work to me, but it's where a majority of my coursework (and internship experience) lies. If I'm honest with myself, I went CompE for the money and job prospects, but I'm hoping to still be able to make it into an EE-oriented career.\n\nSo, question is in the title, for those of you who are already in the industry, would you consider a CpE for EE jobs? Any CpEs out there with a similar story?",

        "text": "I recently took a course called 'Electronic Design 1' in my third year at my university. Unfortunately, the course taught as absolutely no design and instead taught as how to calculate the gain of single stage MOSFET amplifiers. \n\nI'm trying my hand at designing a single stage MOSFET amplifier using my knowledge from that course. I have chosen a gain of -50, and have no other restrictions. Here's my process: \n\n1. Pick 2N7002 transistor in LTSpice. Drain is connected to 12V supply, source is connected to ground, and gate is connected to a DC voltage source that i sweep from 0 to 10. \n2. With the sweep, I plot the Id (drain current) vs Vgs (gate-source voltage) curve. My first assumption is that transconductance (gm) is the derivative of this curve. \n3. I randomly decide that I want the circuit biased at 5V, so I calculate the slope of the curve at 5V, and arrive at a transconductance value of 0.35739. \n4. I now move on to small-signal analysis. I assume that if I throw in a drain resistor, that Av = -Rd * gm (gain equals drain resistor times transconductance). This lead me to believe that I can control gain with the value of the drain resistor. This equation gives me a drain resistance value of approximately 140 ohms. \n\nI throw in a 140 ohm resistor at the drain of the transistor and feed the transistor a 50mV sine wave with a 5V offset (for biasing). Plotting the output waveform shows a signal attenuated by a factor of around 16. \n\nI know I probably made several wrong assumptions throughout this process, but bear in mind my class did not teach me how to do any of this and this was my best guess. Could someone explain to me what was fundamentally wrong about my process and how to properly go about this?\n",

Say to about 50 MHz. This is just for general prototyping. \n\nWhat would be the best method? Of course our metrics are Noise, and EMI, so Phase/Jitter/Shot/Thermal/Flicker Noise reduction (or atleast to take into account), and reactances/parasitic minimization. Try to minimize any reflections of course lol. I mean 50 MHz is not that large a wavelength but not that small either, I wonder if treating everything as lumped element vs distributed via telegraphs equations would be better. I'm not *that* worried about VSWR and Z0 calcs on the smith chart, but maybe I should be? \n\nIn my particular scenario I have those dual \"layer\" perfboard [an example](https://www.amazon.com/Snappable-BreadBoard-Scored-Boards-2-Layer/dp/B00PX52C7Q/ref=pd_lpo_vtph_23_bs_t_1?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=NHXVXBZT6W4CBVTDQ6Y2), non caged/non pin jacket dip sockets and smt to dip adapters, copper nibbler, copper sheet metal (16 gauge and 24 gauge), dual sided copper plated boards and copper tape. \n\nI think the Manhattan style of construction is the most preferred. I was wondering of a proposed alternative that may be easier?\n\nIt may not make sense though. \n\nTo emulate 4 layers, you can use the PTH dual sided board for signal routing, with high gauge wire, or sized copper tape for impedance matching. Try to use the star topology for the signal layers, attach rf or molded through hole inductors with decoupling caps on all digital and oscillator type (VCO, XO, PLLs) circuits. For the power \"plane\" use the star topology, and make a connection to the solid power plane. \n\nStrip a large line through the ground plane for analog and digital ground to avoid ground loops. \n\nI feel like this may be easier than just doing over a single ground plane, throwing on copper islands, and using matched lines to make all connections.  \n\nThis gives two solid copper planes, I wonder if that reduces EM non idealities from entering the circuit. \n\nOr fuck this, this sounds grade A retarded, just stick to Manhattan constructions. Which I don't particularly mind but don't like either. \n\nHere's an example circuit idea:\n\nVCO paired with an amplifier and biquad filter output connected to an ADC, using SPI (max clock at 20Mhz) to a uC of some sort, further connected to an external memory source with an XO paired with a PLL to run at 50Mhz. No dev boards, all prototyped by hand. \n\nWe have oscillator circuits, mixed signal circuits, memory and general digital circuits, and analog circuits. \n\nWould it be better to stick to manhattan style or would this \"4 layer emulation\" make sense as well.\n\nI apologize if this seems obvious, contrived or moronic. I like legit am not sure. ",

Unfortunately Newton had zero understanding of gravity.  \n\nGravity, as we all should know by now, is a direct force, meaning it travels in a straight line.  It is not a curve, so it can not be replicated by a parabola.  In a Cartesian Graph it would simply be represented as a Y axis.  \n\nNow here is where things get interesting (if you read this far).\n\nAn Apple, although it falls due to the direct force of gravity, does not fall straight down. This is what Newton wanted to see, and it is what he couldn't figure out.  \n\nHe would essentially draw these little lines of what we could call a Cartesian Graph representing Slope attempting to replicate the fall of an apple. \n\nAn apple, under vacuum however would fall straight down. This is Galileo. Galileo understood gravity very well. \n\nThe X axis of a Cartesian slope, is not a straight line.  It instead is a curve.  It represents a circle.  Every Cartesian Graph is technically incorrect unless they represent the X axis as a Curve.\n\nApples do not fall straight down, because there are atoms in the way, the atoms are not squares, they are circles, so the apple will fall ontop of the atom, and then will roll slightly, and fall sideways.  \n\nResults:\n\nApples only fall straight down under vacuum\n\nApples will fall and roll when not in a vacuum.\n(The reason being that there are atoms in the way)\n\nFurther reading:\n\nSince an apple falls on top of atoms, and this is the reason why it will curve slightly as it falls (or rotate I should say), then that means as an apple hits the ground, depending on the type of ground, the resulting rotation and distance of the bounce of an apple will determine the speed at which the ground (or Mass or Earth or some other Mass in Outer Space) is moving. \n\nMore accurately, \n\nThe rotation of the apple, the distance away from the point of contact, the height of the bounce = Speed of the Mass in Space in accordance to a larger mass \n\nThis is an approximation as I have not accounted for anything beyond the Sun, since the milky way, as well, must also generate some type of speed, as well as the moon being present and all the other masses in space. \n\nEssentially what is happening is we are combining Newton and Galileo into a single equation , and this will give us the correct calculation to reach light speed. \n\nAgain to repeat:\n\nRedraw the Cartesian Graph where the X axis is a curve.

        "text": "Hi everyone.\n\nI'm working on my final course project, and what me and my group need to do is to transmit three different analog signals via Bluetooth to an Android device.\nThe data will be used in an App and then displayed with some more info. The App will not transmit any data, he should only receive from the sensors and then process it.\n\nWe're looking for a cheap/easy hardware solution to transmit those analog signals via Bluetooth (of couse, it should has an A/D converter on the hardware). We want to spend most of our time developing the App, testing and improving it.\nSo I'm looking to tips about how to transmit those signals via BT. The solution we firstly agreed is to use Arduino + BT Module (HC-05). I was wondering if that using an Arduino should be \"too much\" for such a simple transmission.\n\nIs using an Arduino a good way to do it? Is there any other good solution?\n\nWe are open to suggestions! :)",

I will pay you, not a lot, but hopefully enough to find someone who cares a decent amount. There will be multiple options for payment we can discuss if you are interested. \n\nI can show you a number of pictures I would like my design to mimic, and there are a number of specifications I will give to you once we talk money. These include size specs, integrated diodes, and matrix design. \n\nIf you are interested, PM me and we can talk about how to proceed. \n\nThank you,\n\nCole",

Seeing how stuff is actually done in industry as well as being able to work on a massive software project has been really eye opening. I've been struggling a bit with how complex the codebase is though. The majority of it is written in SystemVerilog, so it's heavily class based.\n\nI thought I had a fairly good grasp of OOP, but I find myself scratching my head at times trying to grasp how everything is connected and nested. Does anyone know resources for learning best OOP practices? Is there a website or book that walks you through implementing arbitrarily complex classes? I've been trying to think of a class structure I could implement in C++ for practice, but none of the ideas I've come up with seem any good. Thanks",
