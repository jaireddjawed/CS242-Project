        "text": "Sorry if this doesn’t quite match up with the typical relationship post on here but I consider it to be relationships since it’s the way interact with potential love interests. Also apologies for any grammar issues or just logical issues it’s late and I didn’t have a plan before I started writing.\nSo I (18M and straight) understand that I am still very young and shouldn’t be worried about finding a partner right now because I am too young and probably too immature for it anyway. 90% of the time I’m ok with that an ok with being on my own and just focusing on my education. Sometimes though, I get a little lonely and wish I had someone to go to in those times. However, the times I’m not feeling that I’m very independent and the thought of a relationship and needing to be able to be emotionally invested in a serious relationship sounds like a headache. Also for me personally I’m not the type to do one and done experiences and don’t find any joy or anything worthwhile in that lifestyle. I tend to be very reserved emotionally and keep to myself until I find someone that I latch onto. Ever since I first started feeling attraction to girls around age 13-14, which I consider to be at a much later age than the typical male, it was rare that I found myself having genuine feelings for someone. In fact I could probably still count on one hand how many times this has happened.\nNow, there are many times when I think I’m attracted to someone and then the next day my feelings are gone forever and I usually let communication die out. Then on the odd occasion my feelings are true and last I think I latch on too much and always overthink and pretty much end up self destructing before it has the chance to go anywhere. It also has been a recent thought of mine that I may just be asexual because I rarely want love, I’m not even sure if it’s real, and on many occasions have had the opportunity to have sex or sexual experiences in general and have turned it down last minute cuz I find the thought to be gross when I really think about it. What’s more is I am still a virgin by choice and I have not even kissed anyone since attending college.\nAs for my case why it may not be my fault is that I just am picky and am waiting and looking for something serious which is extremely rare to find in this day and age especially among college kids. So I take things too seriously and expect too much when I’m reality the other person is just having fun.\nIdk if this even makes any sense I just feel like I need to write my thoughts down and see on the odd chance someone can make sense of them if they have an answer for me.\n\nTl;dr I think I self destruct my potential relationships or I think I might be asexual and I need answers.",

I loved him so much , he lived with me and since he doesn’t make money yet, I’d paid for everything. He did offer and get food whenever he can. He complained about it and said it’s expensive but he did. But I can’t seem to breakup with my boyfriend. I want to breakup with him because he doesn’t treat me right and I’ve to literally tell him everything and he acts immature and childish. I hate him because I’m going through this much pain for the abortion while he’s just chilling playing and watching TV and doing the very minimum. I had to ask him to give me things and ask for him to take me to the hospital. I won’t say it wasn’t helpful, it was. But a nurse could’ve done that for me, I didn’t feel loved throughout the abortion. I want to leave him but a part of me doesn’t want to because I think no one would accept me for the abortion and I don’t have the patience to open up to someone. I have very less friends in the city because I invested everything in the relationship and I feel so so alone while he can just go live at parents and can talk to his friends. I want someone to support me and I want it to be him and I want him to be there but I get hurt and want to leave every time he’s not there. He loves me when I’m upset. Last night I was hurting so much and I told him hes leaving me after he got me pregnant and I’m still very much going through the pain of abortion and him being stoic made me say things and I wanted him to feel bad (I know how bad this sounds) but I felt like I shouldn’t be the only one who’s hurting so much. I couldn’t stop crying for hours and he calls me an abuser because I was hurting him and insulting him while I was just telling him what he did and what he was doing. I told him I hate him and that he’s never there for me and that he’s selfish. \n\nI still want to be with him and he said he’ll change but I don’t trust him and I don’t have the energy to be with anyone else ever again.",

        "text": "Context, I'm 31F, best friend is the same age. We were friends since we were 11 and went to the same school and university (different courses). We were very close and treated each other like sisters. We knew each other's deepest darkest secrets. Since FB Messenger was created, we were chatting almost everyday, even the most mundane stuff. Then we met almost every month just for a chat over a meal.\n\nWe both grew up in your typical strict asian household, but her parents were more strict. She's not allowed to have sleepovers and stay too long out at night. She is also the heir to her father's business, in which she spent her years working after graduation. Needless to say, this caused a rift with her parents and she decided to move out and live in with her BF, which her parents did not approve of.\n\nAs a friend, I have been supportive all through out her major life decisions. I reprimanded her if needed and she acknowledges that, though there were times that she ignores my advice and it's like watching a train wreck in slow motion.  \nSo around 2020, during the pandemic, this was the time she left her home to live with her BF. She told me at first that the reason she left home was because she wanted to be independent, only for her to admit that it's more on living with her BF. I didn't know why she had to lie but I just shrugged it off, thinking she has her reasons. Then she started having some financial problems because the BF was only contributing little. Her parents offered to help, but she refused though there were times she would accept some cash, or go back to her parents once in a while. Then one time, she borrowed some cash from me, and I was totally okay with it. But ever since then, I started looking at her differently.  \nI'm not sure exactly why. If I think hard, maybe it has something to do with me getting tired of looking out for all these years. Listening to the same problems over and over. Giving advice she would ignore until it's too late. I felt like she has a very comfortable life and she's just taking it for granted. yes her parents are too strict, but there were times that their actions were only due to the many times she had lied to them. So after she borrowed money from me, I suddenly felt like not talking to her. I did not care if she ends up not paying me (she did), as I thought that she's my best friend. But since then, I felt annoyed whenever her name pops out in my chat notifications. We started talking less as aside from me chatting less, she was also taking a long time to respond. Until we stopped chatting altogether, except for the usual birthday, christmas and new year greetings.\n\nIt could be that we have also grown apart as adults, but I don't want to end my friendship with her as she didn't actually do anything wrong to me. But at the same time, I'm no longer comfortable chatting with her, or even having lunch with her. Seeing her posts on IG annoys me now to that point that I hid her, and hid my IG stories from her as well as she tends to comment on those.\n\nAny advice, or if anyone has experienced something similar?\n\n**tl;dr I'm not sure exactly why but I don't feel like being friends with my best friend**",

        "text": "How do I confront my cousin sister about her insincerity, without hurting her feelings, and still expressing how much her behavior has affected me?\n\nMy cousin sister (28F) is my (22F) uncle’s daughter on the dad’s side. \nWhen we were young, we had a lovely relationship. To her, I was her baby sister, and she was my elder sister who I looked up to. Growing up, I always took her advice for things, boys, everything.\n\nRelationship length : as old as me \nThere were several things at play. I prefer to organise this information in bullet points.\n\n1) Family business and lifestyle problems: \nMy dad and uncle have a joint business, and since my uncle started it, he has a lot of say in decisions. He owns the major share, and is super well off relative to us. This creates lifestyle differences, which can be severe at times. I don’t like to complain as I am grateful to what I have right now, but my mom openly resents my dad’s inability to make his own decision sometimes. Basically, my uncle dominates my dad and that does impact my family life at home. Dad has a habit of not consulting his wife for major things, such as investing family funds in business, giving up mom and dad’s joint property for office lease without her say, and generally being drawn to the glamorous lives my uncle and aunt have, prioritising them greatly. This causes a lot of resentment in my mom, and justifiably so, and it passes onto me at times, although I stay away from it. \n\nThe good thing is, these differences have not really affected the relationship our cousins share, but our families meet rarely now. \n\n2) My cousin’s behaviour at her wedding: \nOver the years, I stayed in touch with her, like I earlier mentioned. She’s an extroverted individual and very charming. Since she belongs to the upper elite, she has a lifestyle and a social circle I simply don’t seem to mix well with. Whenever I met friends, or acquaintances, I never felt comfortable around them. It always felt like I had to put up a facade, like some weight was on me, all the time. \nSlowly, this started affecting the already strained relationship our families had. I felt more comfortable around my other relatives from my mom’s side and those cousins rather than them. I felt like I would be judged for everything I did at their place whenever I would visit them. It was exhausting. \n\nThe final straw was her wedding. I hail from a culture where bride’s cousins are the chief bridesmaids, catering to her needs, getting ready with her, just be “exclusive” in a way. I didn’t have any expectations by then, but I was so hurt that she preferred her elite friend’s company and company of her other elite cousin’s on her mom’s side, rather than me and my sister. \nThe “other” cousins and friends got to perform a ritual with her in the bridal green room that traditionally I should’ve performed. When I saw the pictures later, I was so incredibly hurt. Those friends got to get their professional makeup done, rather than me. \nI fell sick during one of the parties which I couldn’t attend, and she didn’t even notice I wasn’t there. My family was entirely sidelined, and they preferred to keep friends and “other” family at their side. I thought the wedding could bring us closer but it just created more bad feelings in me. \n\n\nNow cut to the present. I recently moved in the same state as her for my master’s degree, and she obviously lives there with her husband and she sends a very sweet message \n\n“ Hey, I miss you. I was talking to my mother in law about how close we are and how much time we’ve spent discussing our secrets. You should come visit me. Let’s catch up, my baby sis. Let’s tell each other secrets and then never stop. I love you. Call me” \n\n\nShe is obviously faking it. She is very sweet and charming, but she isn’t genuine. All those times, she said she was closest to me, she was lying and that was evident on her wedding day. \n\nI really want to call her out, why? Because I secretly really want to have my older sister back. I really want her to be that BFF in her life which I know I’ll never be. I don’t want to entertain her hollow words and empty promises if she has no intentions of keeping them. \n\nDo I communicate with her? If yes, how? How do I make my feelings known without hurting her?\n\n\n\nTLDR; When I was younger, my cousin sister and I had a great relationship, but family business and lifestyle differences caused strain between our families. The final straw was when she excluded me from her wedding festivities, causing hurt feelings. Now, she's reached out to me, but I suspect insincerity and I'm not sure how to communicate my feelings without hurting her",

        "text": "I tried to make the title as simple as possible. Just to clear the air, it is not in a romantic sense. Purely platonic, but I miss the larger than life friendship. \n \nMy best friend of 10 Years did something which led me to cut all ties with him. Not going into the details, but it involved My ex and a shit ton of betrayal, first behind my back and then some more + blatant disrespect on My face. \n\nI know there is no coming back from what he did, because even if i forgive, I will not forget. Neither does he feel any remorse for whatever happened. \n\nThe problem this has created is that even after 2 years, I have subconsciously pushed away people who attempt to be my friends, presumably due to the latent trust issues I have. My old friendship made me feel like ride and die friends do exist but after whatever happened,  that notion is long gone. \n\nThe incident led me to alienate myself from my old friends group.  The reason behind that is I didnlt like it when they chose to remain neutral over whatever happened. \n\nI am slowly coming to terms with the realization that I have essentially been all alone these two Years, as well as burnt whatever potential friendships I could have made. Even with this realization I am struggling to change my ways about making friends. This is adding to my insecurity of being a just a difficult person in general. \n\nI normally don't consider \"quitting\" from existence an option, but it's just been a bed of thorns when it comes to building friendships.  Maybe I am subconsciously trying to replace the old friends group and trying to find the exact kind of companionship they provided, I just don't understand. I don't understand.  I did try therapy, I didn't gel with the methods of two of them, and as a foreign student, money is definitely reserved. Any advice would be nice. Thank you \n\nTLDR: unable to move past what best bud did, affecting my ability to make friends.",

        "text": "Looking for tough yet fair advice about the longevity of my relationship given the large disparity in income between my partner and I. \n\nMy (28F) and my partner (36F) have been in a relationship for 14 months, and living together for 8 months of that. We do similar amount of chores around the house, share cooking etc. I take on more of the burden of life admin (financial planning, bills, insurances etc) as my partner is a bit of a procrastinator and has no experience nor desire to do it. \n\nMy partner relocated to live abroad with me, but was previously living with her parents. We met in my home country (through friends). I’ve been living here for 5 years. \n\nIn our home country my partner had an average income. Let’s say €28k. And has never had the desire to increase it (through study or skills etc). My partner had 0 assets. Not a penny to their name when we met, despite living with their parents well in to their thirties. \n\nI on the other hand, have some money insecurities (as we all do to some extent), and my way of dealing with that growing up was aspiring for independence. I studied hard, put myself through university, grad jobs etc. At 28 I’m fortunate to be earning ~€200k/year (+ non cash comp, such as stock options). I’ll soon be taking on a role north of €300k, and my earning potential is uncapped (Finance/Tech C-Suite). \n\nI also own the house we live in, the mortgage is €2k/month and incl. bills around €2.6k month. It’s a beautiful place furnished to a high standard, so our day to day living is very comfortable. \n\nGiven my partner made the leap to join me abroad, I have been funding our lifestyle. It took 6 months to get the visa through so she could start working. I referred her to a #1 place to work and she was successful and began at a job with a salary of around €40k. After 3 weeks she said she hated it and quit. \n\nI felt this was quite irresponsible as I had been funding everything (the house, food, trips, even haircuts) since she moved. I explained that when there is responsibility (e.g. bills to be paid on a certain date) you can’t quit without having something else lined up. \n\nAnyway, she quit and started doing cleaning jobs. I respect the hard graft that goes into this job massively. However, her earning potential is capped to ~€28k. She explains that she will never earn more than this.\n\nWhilst the day to day of the relationship is great, we have many arguments about money. I have aspirations/plans to retire early, and on some level feel like if we are together for the long haul, I will need to bake in her retirement fund too, or slow down my own retirement to subsidise her lifestyle to somewhat match mine. \n\nThere’s many practicalities I’m concerned about long term. At the moment I can still take advantage of doing a few trips a year with friends, as I know my partner is limited to one a year.  But how does this look when we have children? I envisioned a life of being able to introduce my children to different cultures and giving them the opportunity they of private education. \n\nI would love to not have my insecurities and this desire to strive for independence and financial freedom and be content and live an average 2.4 kids and 3 bed house lifestyle. But I don’t, and the more therapy I have, the more I realise there’s no shame in that. I’m still a kind, generous and loving individual - I just have dreams and desires like any human. \n \nMy partner and I talk often, both have our own therapists and have signed up for couples therapy today with a (mutually) new therapist.\n\nTLDR: I earn 6-7x more than my partner now, maybe more in the future. Already causing some issues such as resentment. Don’t want to feel this way. Are we incompatible or is there a way to work around this for both of us?",

        "text": "TL;DR!  I (21F) am in a seemingly happy, healthy  relationship with my partner (M22) for almost 4 yrs. Sex is great as well. But throughout relationship I have always had doubts/felt incomplete, wondered if there were better connections out there. Also struggled with my need for WLW intimacy.  Bisexual w/ OCD and I can’t tell if my desires and relationship doubts are normal in long term relationship or a sign of serious problem. \n\n\n\nI (21F) have been dating my boyfriend (22M) for over three years now. He’s such a great guy, I love him so much. I’ve never been loved by someone the way he has. He treats me like his everything. He’s funny and always makes me laugh. There aren’t any concrete  problems in the relationship. We have healthy communication, and support each other emotionally/physically. The sex is great for me, I want to make that clear. This is the first real serious relationship I’ve ever had. I’ve only dated one other person and that was in high school for a year \nHERE’S THE ISSUE- there are various problems with ME. \nSUMMARY:  \n- I am bisexual, and have emotional and physical desires that I have come to believe can never be satisfied by a cis man. It’s a constant yearning/missing. \n- I have severe OCD that makes me constantly second guess myself, my thoughts, and almost all decisions I’ve ever made. It can be hard to tell what’s anxiety based and what my real feelings are. \nI ALSO have OCD about my bisexuality and feel like imposter. \n\nWith all that in mind, the whole relationship I have never felt like he’s “the one”. I’m happy but always had feeling of wanting more or that there was something else out there. Not an unrealistic utopian relationship but more grounded things. I love him but I feel like we never have enough to talk about. We don’t share a ton of same interests. \nI feel I am never 100% satisfied and in awe of my  partner? Also I’ve had intense crushes on other people (mostly women) while we have dated, I think I even might have been in some type of love with a best friend. HOWEVER I HAVE NEVER ACTED ON THESE FEELINGS.  I would never cheat, and i haven’t physically or even emotionally been with another person.\nThis whole time I’ve thought these feelings were normal in long term relations. I always love and stay loyal to bf but still have feelings Over time I have been told by others this is not their normal experience. Is this bad for a relationship? \nIf I ever do break up with my bf I don’t think I’ll date men anymore cause I won’t be able to find a guy as good and unproblematic as him. \nI haven’t fully expressed all this to my bf yet because I don’t want to cause drama over something that might be a personal mental problem. I definitely don’t want to hurt my bf and I worry what will happen to him if I leave, I can’t stand the thought of him being alone/sad.",

        "text": "I wish I didn't care about this as much as I do, but I do.  I feel really stupid writing this but I have to get this out somehow.\n\nI am 35 year old guy and I am dating a girl that is 24.  I'd say we are both objectively attractive.  She is a dancer and works in nightlife.  A social butterfly and a really bright personality.  It's one of the things I love about her.\n\nYesterday was a little rough. It's a new relationship of a little over a month and I care about her a lot, I know she cares about me a lot.  One struggle we have is a language and culture barrier.  I live in Asia, she comes from a traditional Asian background and sometimes the communication style is very different.  I am from the U.S.\n\nWe really hit it off in the beginning because our personalities are quite similar.  She is into nightlife, so am I, she's outgoing, confident, silly, a lot of great qualities I value in a person.  I consider myself, fun, outgoing, goofy, I enjoy being around me too.  But she also really cares about appearances and we look very different.  She is very short, very fashionable and stylish, always looking done up, always puts a lot of care and effort into her look.  I am not a hideous monster by any means.   I would consider myself stylish and fashionable in my own way.  But I'm super tall, covered in tattoos, long hair, different style for sure but not completely clashing, just a little different.  The truth is, 10 years ago I was modelling at runway shows for NYFW, but I definitely don't have that same body.  Much more of an average dad bod now.  Its nothing drastically different, just more pudgy I guess.  But in this Asian country where most are smaller and thinner, I'm fat.  I'm working on being more in shape and the body will come in time.  In the very beginning, she kept saying things like I need to go to the gym more to get a 6 pack and not be fat.  I would tell her that yes that is my plan, but that I look okay now and I hope she likes how I look now and not wait for some other version of me that might come later on.  She's brought up the 6 pack thing quite a few times and every time she does, I tell her she needs to chill with the 6 pack talk.  \n\nI find myself in these weird and random situations with her from time to time.  One time she said, \"Why did I choose such ugly tattoos?\" while we were out with friends and it wasn't a joke.  It was an honest question.  They are American traditional tattoos that most people I've met think are beautiful.  Really quality work honestly. I told her that I don't want her to call my tattoos ugly because they are important to me and I like them.\n\nAnyways, yesterday, the first thing that happened, we had a difficult conversation in the afternoon that had absolutely nothing to do with any of this but we got through it.  After our conversation, as a token of appreciation, I shaved my beard.  She has been asking me to shave my beard for awhile'  I thought why not...  I haven't completely shaved my beard in a LONG LONG time and now I look so different.  I honestly don't like it very much and I'm waiting for it to grow back.  We go out and have a great evening.  But every time I run into a mirror, I'm shocked at my face.  We get home and I run into a mirror, shocked again.  This is when I try to have a nice lighthearted conversation with her but it all takes a turn for the worse.\n\n\"Hey Babe, if I met you on our first date with this face, would you go on a second date with me?\"  I'm asking in an obvious joking tone.\n\nShe responds, \"If I cared about what you looked like, we would not go on a second date.  You are not my type.\"  These words exactly and her tone is dead serious.  I'm taken aback.\n\n\"Holy fuck, I'm not your type?!\"  This was incredibly surprising.  This is a person that already feels comfortable telling me they love me.  Sleeps with me frequently.  I was floored.  \"So you don't find me attractive?\"  I can tell she doesn't really understand the word attractive so I try to change it a little bit. \"You don't think I'm hot?\"\n\n\"When you get 6 pack, you'll be hot.\"\n\n\"Oh my god, are you serious?\"\n\n\"Yeah, you're not hot, but you're cute.\"\n\nI was absolutely crushed.  I know I'm not like an influencer or in model shape like I once was but god damn that was a gut punch.   I want her to have that kind of attraction towards me, the way I'm attracted to her.  I would never say anything like, 'you'd be hot if your boobs were bigger or if your stomach was more toned.'  Because I think she looks incredible now. \n\nSo after kind of awkwardly sitting there I decide its time to go to bed.  I walk into the bathroom to brush my teeth and boom, it fucking hits me, the mirror.  My face is so different and just not what I want to see and my body is not perfect, no 6 pack.  It just breaks me.  I can't help but cry, not ugly cry, but still, it just hurt that I couldn't look at myself in a mirror and like what I saw.  She notices and asks me what's wrong.  I tell her I can't look at myself in the mirror and she starts to put it all together.  She says she's sorry and shows me a lot of affection, tells me I'm handsome a bunch.  I know she tried to make things right but it was definitely like a little bit of the spark died.\n\nWhat would you do in this scenario?  \n\n TL,DR; I have a new girlfriend.  She's hot.  She frequently makes comments about my body that I need a 6 pack and in conversation last night, told me she doesn't think I'm hot.  It was a bummer.  Should read the full thing for context.",

        "text": "In May me (18F) and my boyfriend (18M) will have been broken up for a year :( honestly, our relationship wasn't the best but it lasted over a year (my first relationship + only serious relationship I've ever had). I'll be honest, he gaslighted and lied to me multiple times and our communication wasn't great but I really really loved him. Not saying I didn't mess up because my biggest fault was relying on him way too much which ended up burdening him in the long run. After we broke up I was at first okay with it because of all of the sh\\*t he put me through, but after like a week I was super devastated and couldn't sleep because I was sobbing every night. Definitely one of the worst experiences I've ever been through and I was depressed for months. For context, I don't have very many friends and when my boyfriend broke up with me I was having a big fight with my (male) best friend so he wasn't in the picture (3 weeks until I even told anyone about my breakup lol). The friends I did tell about it already knew about the really horrible things my boyfriend said to me so naturally they wanted me to move on and stop thinking about him but it's not really that easy. All I really wanted was for someone to validate my experiences and tell me it's okay for me to take as long as I need to heal but no one ever told me that. A lot of people told me to just think about the bad things he did and it would force my mind into hating him, but that didn't work. To be honest, everything I have tried hasn't worked.\n\nFor context, I've always been terrified of dating people and my boyfriend was the first person I ever met who made me feel secure in a relationship. Since our breakup, I've tried getting to know other people, but every time I get close to dating someone I can't do it, I always get freaked out and scared and so I always end up backing out. So, to say I haven't tried is an understatement. Nothing helps me stop thinking about him. I can't stop myself from dreaming about him unconsciously, or even a random memory has me thinking about him and I can't stop. At the end of June, I'll be heading to college and my ex will be a senior in high school. Currently, we are not on speaking terms. He has me restricted on Instagram (still follows me tho) and blocked on Discord. The only time we interact is for club matters (we are on leadership for the same club). I've tried talking to him multiple times, he always shuts me out. We do have mutual friends: his best friend is a close friend of mine (this friend does not want to talk about the relationship I had with my ex anymore), his cousin is a very close friend of mine (this is the friend who told me that I should have moved on by now) and another friend of his who we send Instagram reels back and forth. I still have connections to him, but it seems like he doesn't want anything to do with me.  \n\nAs of right now, I can't imagine myself dating anyone else and I really love and care for him. Is it unrealistic to hope that in college we might be able to reconcile and date again? I can't help but have hope because I am willing to forgive him for everything and start over, but I'm not sure what to think anymore. Thoughts?\n\nTL;DR: Me and my boyfriend have been broken up for a year now and I think I still love him, is it possible that we can get back together in college despite not being on talking-terms right now?",

        "text": "Hey everyone. So for 2 years my wife has been working at this dead end job which she finished university for. For the past 6 months the job became unbearable for her, she can’t rise in the position, she was given additional responsibilities, but without any increase in salary, her team is not very nice as well.  She tried applying to a couple of job openings, but was rejected - this has led to calling herself a loser and not meant for working in that field of work also saying that everywhere’s the same. She feels depressed there, but she works fully remote and doesn’t have much work to do during the day, however she cant focus to do anything apart from watching TV and reading a book when she has no work to do.\n\nAbout 6 months back she went to a couple pastry courses and started to make cakes for fun just for friends, they liked it. She wants to quit her job and pursue a career in pastry by opening her own place. At first I was skeptical, but I said we can try to do this as a side job by making cakes for people from our place and see where it goes, but she said its nonsense and called me non-supportive. She always tells me how in other couples other boyfriends always support their girlfriends and stuff, and how every one of our friends supports the idea of a pastry place. Financially, I am worried and I told her that but I just thought Im not the asshole to block anyone out of their dreams. So later on, I said look, first quit your job because that’s the main reason you are depressed and just do whatever you want, she got angry and still didn’t quit her job because she says its because of you and that you fear we won’t have money and that I only care about money. That is going on for a while now and really has taken a negative effect on our marriage. \n\nMy question is - how to approach this, because never I was so lost in my life?\n\nTL;DR wife wants to quit her job and open her own pastry place, I was skeptical at first , but now I want her to at least quit her current job and do whatever she wants. She gets angry and is depressed, calls me not supportive",

We met our senior year of high school (March 2020) right after covid shut everything down. All us seniors had just gotten our college acceptance letters and were making all kinds of online group chats to meet other freshmen in our majors and stuff. I met him in an engineering group chat on Snapchat since we were both going to be engineering majors in the fall. Instantly we started chatting individually on Snapchat just as friends. After a week those chats turned into daily zoom calls that lasted hours. \n\nMarch - July we FaceTimed and snap chatted and zoom called all day and everything was purely platonic. He was the first guy to make me feel comfortable being myself. He made me laugh harder than I ever had before. He made me a better and brighter version of myself. By July things started turning flirty and we talking about dating once we got to campus in the fall and i played it cool but I was crazy about him. \n\nWhen fall semester started and we moved to college, we began dating. Bf expressed to me he suffers from depression and anxiety and has panic attacks too. He gave me an out if it was too much for me but i said no bc i thought it was something I could handle. Him and I hung out every day alone or with our mutual friends doing weird things because covid shut everything down on campus. We would play Pokémon go, video games, sit in the food court and people watch, drink too much, etc. we had a blast. \n\nfast forward 2 years later and we are both still engineering students in our junior year. Our relationship has been perfect. We rarely fight and always laugh. He just gets me. He’s in aerospace engineering and his school work is consistent with a 75 hour work week. His work ethic is incredible and refuses to perform any less than 100% in school. \n\nNaturally, this creates a lot more stress and anxiety for him to deal with. This has led him to come to me saying he doesn’t know if he has time for me and school and obviously he can’t not do school. He tells me he loves me and I’m perfect and he doesn’t want to break up and he doesn’t know what to do. I told him I was okay with seeing him less if the alternative was breaking up. His response was that that’s not fair to me and i deserve better. While he says all of this he also tells me I’m the only one for him, he sees a future with me, he wants to get married one day, and all that. Very mixed messages. This happened about a week ago and now we’re both home on spring break. \n\nSince spring break I started having panic attacks probably brought on by stress of this situation and a bunch of other stuff not relevant to this. I went to the doctor and got diagnosed with anxiety and was given a prescription for it. This wasn’t a surprise to bf because I’ve been showing mild symptoms for anxiety for a while and since he is familiar he was encouraging me to go to the doctor. \n\nAfter my appointment I told him about my diagnosis and he asked if he gave me the anxiety. I told him obviously not, but ever since that conversation (yesterday) he’s been distant and not wanting to talk to me. I love him so much and I don’t want to break up but I don’t know where he’s at. I think both of us need to work on ourselves but I’m hoping it’s possible we’ll be able to do that without breaking up. Idk. \n\nThis probably doesn’t make a lot of sense but oh well. What do i do?\n\nTL;DR My boyfriend is overwhelmed with life and is self sabotaging our relationship.",

        "author": "rrickrolled",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11rmooo/my_25f_dad_71m_gives_my_brother_a_horrible_diet/",
        "text": "Hello. To start off my parents got divorced when I was 17, and my mom did 100% of the food preparation. After the divorce I lived with my mom, and then I ended up moving back in with my dad when I was 22. They spilt my brother 50/50 and switch every week. \n\nI’d like to say that my mom still doesn’t really know how to cook and a lot of meals are frozen or it’s more of assembling food rather than cooking it. She also order out for my brother a lot. But she does actually try to make his meals as healthy as she can by including veggies, a reasonable carb size amount, always having fruits, etc. and when she orders out it’s from healthier places like Luna Grill (Mediterranean).\n\nMy dad on the other hand is the problem. He’s always had women cook for him in his life so when the divorce happened he really had no experience. He should’ve learned or even do what my mom does. But instead, after living with my dad for the past 3 years, I have seen a bad diet always given to my brother.\n\nFrom my dad’s side, 97% of my brother’s meals are pita bread, In-N-Out, Chick-Fil-A, and pasta. And no I am not kidding. I cannot remember when my brother had something that wasn’t these 3 things (probably a few months ago), but I remember it was pizza which really isn’t better. \n\nA typical day for my brother is having pita bread or those big Costco muffins for breakfast, having the school cafeteria lunch, either get In-N-Out or Chick-Fil-A after school (switches every other day), and pasta for dinner. Sometimes my dad will get In-N-Out for after school and then Chick-Fil-A for dinner. You get the picture.\n\nGranted, he will sometimes have fruit but it’s really only in the summer and spring. But as of now he probably only has fruit once a week (if that), and there’s definitely no veggies involved whatsoever. \n\nHis entire diet is carbs, a little bit of protein, and that’s it (when he’s with my dad). My dad prides himself that he doesn’t give my brother the “bad fast food” like McDonald’s, Jack in The box, etc., and how he doesn’t let him drink soda and he gives him milk. I will agree the two places he goes too are marginally better, but it’s still fast food.\n\nMy dad’s ego is the big big problem. I feel angry but also sad because he probably feels if he admits my brother’s diet isn’t good that means he’s an incompetent father, which isn’t the case. Ironically he became what he feared because he resists help. \n\nNow, here is where the problems occur on trying to fix this problem. When I moved in and saw the diet I told my dad and he got really defensive. My older sister used to live here too but she moved out and she laughed when I told her this because she said she tried so many times and he would just yell at her for bringing it up nicely. Over the course of the 3 years I’ve been here I’ve brought it up about 5 times and each time it ended up with him raising his blood pressure for yelling at me so much and him getting so defensive. So 1 or 2 years ago I thought I’d take the liberty into my own hands and start making healthy meals for my brother. Boy did I make a big mistake. He told me not to do that every again unless he asks me to, and that I’ve “ruined” my brother’s meals for the day. In the summer when I would be with my brother all day and be on “brother duty”, my dad would ask me to get him food from these 2 places and when I didn’t and cooked him something healthy instead (that my brother would enjoy, btw), my dad would give me a dirty look when he got home from work, so I knew I could only do this sometimes in the summer since I have a little more control. \n\nBefore I moved in with my dad, apparently my sister told my mom and since my mom and dad are on terrible terms my mom ended up telling the courts. But that obviously still didn’t change anything.\n\nOver the summer, my aunt from the Middle East visited for some months and the very first thing she noticed was the diet. She tried talking to him and my dad scolded her to Timbuktu. Definitely wasn’t brought up again. \n\nSo then I tried informing my brother of making healthier choices, portion sizes, eating fruits and veggies, etc. in the hopes that maybe the next time my dad would offer fast food my brother could request something else and that could force my dad to change his habits. It didn’t work because my brother never attempted to say anything. I thinks it’s for a number of reasons like my brother likes the food and if my dad (who has more authority than me) is saying it’s okay than he’ll listen to him. I also feel like he knows my dad might question this and get him the food anyway. \n\nI don’t know how many more people he is going to call crazy and wrong. Me, my sister, my mom, my aunt, and the courts have all agreed this is not a good diet but yet we’re all wrong. \n\nI’ve already given up hope but this is my last holy Mary. I definitely am not the healthiest eater but I sure eat a lot better than that, and he uses the claim that since I eat fast food sometimes I’m not one to talk (since I branch out of in n out and chick fil a, since those aren’t fast food places I guess) when my dad eats fast food from those 2 places pretty much everyday too. \n\nI know I may face backlash for this, but I am completely unwilling to get the courts/CPS/law enforcement involved for many reasons. The main reason is he only eats like this half the time. And my mom and dad are on HORRIBLE terms so going to her for any advice is out of the question. Like, they literally hate eachother and haven’t even seen eachother in many years. And I’m not sure if my mom could even help that much because apparently my brother doesn’t like a lot of the frozen food she prepares, so it’s a hard situation. \n\nAny advice at all? Thank you.\n\nTL;DR: my dad gives my brother a bad diet that consists of fast food are carbs for pretty much all of it. Me and many other people in his life have tried talking to him but he lashes out and gets defensive at any polite attempts we make regarding this.",

        "text": "\nMy (22F) boyfriend (24M) has a girl friend, Sarah, that he never talks about but apparently is very close to him. My boyfriend keeps his friend group very small to my knowledge he only has about 3 or 4 friends and doesn’t go socialize or go out much. He isn’t very big on social media either and deletes and restarts Instagram to keep his following around maybe 15 people, all of which i recognize as family, close coworkers, or friends I have met and talked with about before. When my boyfriend first remade his instagram more than 6 months ago he sent me his username and I checked his following (only 3 at the time, including his mom and brother) and I noticed an account belonging  to a girl named Sarah who had been following him as a mutual before I even had the chance to. I’ll admit she is very pretty, she doesn’t post many pictures of herself but I could tell she went to high school with my boyfriend because of the mutual accounts following and interacting with her. I normally don’t let things like bother me but we have been transparent with our friend groups and ex relationships, and personally I have little to none “guy friends” and don’t keep in contact with any of my exes or I have them blocked and my boyfriend said he’s on the same boat. I confronted him about Sarah following him and he tells me they’ve been close friends for years and of course he’s brought her up in the past to me even though I can’t remember him mentioning her especially since he talks about his friends and family daily. He stresses that they are nothing more than friends and says I can even ask his brother or mom about it if I was that interested. I take that response and let it go because honestly, he’s never given me a reason not to trust him and I have random people following me on all my accounts since I’m way more active on social media.\n\nNow currently, I’ve been catching up with a guy friend from high school, we’ll call him Bob and have been trying to pair him with my best friend, Jessica since she is single now and who wouldn’t want their two friends in happy relationship together? They both have similar plans for the future and are well into their careers plus Jessica has told me that she’s definitely into Bob but worried he doesn’t reciprocate, initially I assured her maybe because she hasn’t been forward or they haven’t had enough time together. But honestly she might be right because it feels like he either can’t take a hint or he’s avoiding it. I’ve noticed my boyfriends jealousy,  when I mention this Bob in the past (t’s caused a few tense conversations) and I’ve assured him 100% that there has never been anything between us and Bob has NEVER communicated any interest towards me. I do find that Bob texts me often sometimes but we have been friends now for almost a decade. He’s hung out with me in past relationships and has always been respectful and inviting. Well my boyfriend this past Sunday was using my computer to buy tickets for an event we were all going to together and snooped through Bob and i’s messages. Later he told me how it made him uncomfortable and the chat was a little “too friendly,” and how he thought Bob seemed to be more interested in talking to me than my best friend Jessica when went out earlier that day. I told him if he checked the chat then he could there was no flirting whatsoever just literally normal conversation about our plans this weekend, and Bob was doing most of the talking anyways. My boyfriend still thinks there’s something more and that Bob is playing the “long term” with me, staying friends with me over time until I am finally single enough for him to get close to me. Eventually, I agreed that I would distance myself out of respect for my boyfriends boundaries especially since it seems like there’s no hope in pairing my friend, Bob, with my best friend, Jessica so we probably won’t be having anymore outings as a group.\n\nNow circling back to Sarah on instagram, I can’t help but remember the situation even though he assured me she was nothing more than a close long term friend and she has a boyfriend, so there’s nothing for me to be worried about. We live in a major city and there’s been a few instances now where we just so happen to go to the same event, same gym, and even her work place but he never introduces me or even says hi to Sarah, he just points her out in the crowd and doesn’t even approach her. I would think if you’re that close to someone that you make sure they have your very private exclusive instagram that you only share with family and close friends, you would at least say hi if you saw them in public?At one point, I even followed her on instagram since it was private and she didn’t follow me back but accepted my request, which might be silly or shallow but I feel says a lot. I am pretty close with his friends but I have yet to even interact with this Sarah girl or hear him bring her up despite the times we’ve seen her in public. I have never gone through my boyfriends phone, but I am guilty of checking his following or accounts who like his post AND especially find his behavior about Sarah weird because of him being so suspicious and jealous about my friend Bob. I’m wondering if this whole “long term” ulterior motive situation  is what he’s planning on with Sarah. It might be a stretch but it eats me up inside, wondering if I’m the girl he’s settled for.\n\nDo I sound crazy for being suspicious of Sarah? I feel like I’m missing part of the story. Am I assuming too much, I’m worried if I confront him he will be offended or I would be causing more harm than good.\n\n\nTL;DR My boyfriend is close friends with a girl who never speaks about and assures me they are nothing more than friends but asked me to cut off contact with a guy friend when I assured him the same thing, because he believes he has ulterior motives. Should I be skeptical?",

        "text": "So this guy (23m) and I (22f) met online about a year ago. He seemed really into me, but we had a really short relationship that lasted only a month due to a big argument that we had one night. Things that led to this argument were my lateness habits (I was usually 5-15 mins late on most times that we hung out). He was also really short tempered so it pretty easy to get him mad. Another thing that I think led to that argument was that I was still shy in person around him. I’m shy when I first start getting to know someone, but he just assumed that it meant that I’m not really into him I guess? It was mostly those two things that led to the breakup: me being shy in person, and my lateness habits. \n\nThat night we broke up, he was already pretty upset and stressed from work. We met up, and I was only about 3-5 mins late AT MOST. But when I greeted him, he looked so pissed off, he even gave me an attitude. It’s like he didn’t even wanna be there. This got me annoyed, so after seeing that he was giving me attitude, I just stopped talking and we were in silence all the way to the restaurant. After eating, we argued when he was dropping me off home and he told me that he’s tired of me always being late, and also the fact that I barely even try to hold a convo with him. However, to be fair, this particular night I only gave him the silent treatment because I was ANNOYED at how he greeted me and bc of his attitude that night. \n\nFor a week I tried fixing things with him. I told him I wanted to improve, I want to stop being late and talk more, &amp; get rid of my shyness the more I get to know him. But he was mad and he didn’t want to fix anything, so we broke up. A month later, we started talking again but only as friends. Then summer came, we stopped talking. I started talking to this new guy that I really liked (I was in a situationship with this new guy for months,until the end of last year). And he was in a relationship with a new girl for 6 months. They broke up almost 2 months ago. \n\nA month ago he reached out to me again, and we chatted as friends. He seemed to be completely over that big argument we had. It’s been almost a year. So yeah we texted, and he said we should hang out, but it was pretty clear that he wanted to hook up again. But I made excuses bc I don’t want to just be fwb, I would wanna see if we can get back together, I wanna show him that I’ve changed so that he could consider a relationship again, but how would I do that? Advice please?\n\nTl;dr: him and I broke up a year ago bc of my lateness habits and me being shy, how can I try to get back together with him",

        "text": "**TLDR - Boyfriend of 5+ years and I are breaking up. I initiated the conversations and have been thinking about it for quite a while. However, now I'm super sad and don't know if I'm making the right decision. Are these kinds of feelings/thoughts normal?**\n\nI (28F) have been with my boyfriend (33M) for 5+ years, long distance. For at least the past six months, I've been seriously contemplating ending our romantic relationship for a lot of reasons (I posted about it before, if you're curious). \n\nMy sister got married this past weekend and I really started to think about our future. I am sick of long distance, I can't do it forever. We talked about the realistic options for our future due to his health. Best case scenario is another 4-5 years of long distance (I have obligations with some university grants and my job), and then me moving to his country (where I don't want to live) and him losing his monthly income (he receives disability benefits, which he'd lose if we lived together).\n\nObviously, I wish I could say that we love each other enough to make it work. But if I'm being completely realistic, both of us would have to sacrifice a lot and I don't know if we'd be happy, despite how we feel about each other. \n\nThe problem is, now I feel shitty. I feel guilty and sad and I keep thinking about all the good things about him and us. I tried to make a list of the reasons I think it's best if we break up, but it's not helping me feel any better.\n\nOn top of everything, this is my first relationship. Is it normal to have regrets? Am I making the wrong decision? The fact that I've been thinking about this for so long already tells me it's probably what I want, but I'm really lost here. Thanks in advance.",

        "text": "TLDR; My best friend tries to appear like me and hides her one night stands and STDs in front of my boyfriend, but is okay telling everybody else in the world. \n\nI can’t believe I’m writing this out. My best friend 25 F and I 24 F are roommates and we do everything together. We’re polar opposites in personalities. We’ve been best friends since 4 years now and I’ve been with my boyfriend 30 M a year.\n\nHe’s amazing, gentle and sweet, and she would often joke about ‘where did you get this guy from?’\n\nMy boyfriend comes over to my place often and she’s an attention seeking only child, or so I thought, and she would end her meetings and calls to talk to him and tell him about her work and asks questions for long conversations. \n\nSo for context, I’ve never used dating apps. Everytime I install a dating app I freak out and uninstall in 10mins and this is what I keep saying to people. \nIn a recent conversation with him she mentioned that she never used a dating app and she uninstalls in 10 mins. Wtf? She’s never uninstalled Bumble or Hinge for at least 4 years now. \n\nShe tells me not to tell my boyfriend about her hookups and her current guy, who’s married and has a kid. She’s sleeping with him and since I told her my boyfriend knows about it, she stopped sharing details. She tells me not to tell my boyfriend about her conquests. Which was ok since it may be a privacy issue.\n\nYesterday we made a reel which was a best friend challenge thing. It had questions like ‘who’s most likely to do one night stands’ ‘who’s most likely to catch an STD’ etc. She posted it on her public instagram account which garnered attention. My boyfriend is not on any social media and I can’t download reels I asked her if I can take a video from her phone to send my boyfriend.\n\nShe immediately got defensive and refused and asked me not to send it to him since it mentions one night stands and STDs which she admitted to doing. \n\nNow, why is she okay with the world knowing that she does one night stands but not my boyfriend? Someone tell me I’m overthinking.",

        "text": "My friend (38F) and I (40F) are having an argument. We've been friends for nearly all of our lives and she's been married to her husband (39M) for 15. She recently discovered his stash of porn and it's all of women of a specific race. \n\nShe's upset because she's not that race and is worried about the implication on their sexual relationship and if for the last 15 years he's been imagining someone else.\n\nShe also views porn as cheating and is also concerned because her husband works closely with a woman of this race and is curious just how closely they work. \n\nI asked her if it would be different if the women were her race and she said yes because then she would know for sure he finds her attractive. I told her I didnt understand why both things cant be true, that he likes both her and porn of other races.\n\nI thought she was worried her husband would be like her father because when her parents divorced he remarried a woman of this race. And my friend always thought the woman was a homewrecker and tried too hard to be their stepmom. \n\n\nFrom an outsider view, both parents remarried and had more kids, her dad just did it first and she was a kid and maybe took that personally because her mom would say things about it. \n \nShe's now worried her husband would leave her for a woman who looks like the women of his porn.  \n\nI told her the above and she was saying i was just being mean and implicating she was racist when she wasn't. I told her if she didnt like women of a certain race because the men in her life seemed to like them that at the very least it is offensive because they've done nothing to her and meanwhile she's talking about them like they're lesser than.\n\nShe is still mad at me and we have not spoken for a week. Normally when we disagree we just move on. But this felt too important of a point to make about her just addressing the specific issue of intimacy and watching porn with her husband instead of being upset that he finds women of that race attractive. \n\nHow do I communicate better and mend our friendship? Or should I just let it go snd let things blow over. \n\nTLDR: my friend hates her husband watches interracial porn and she doesnt understand why i think its offensive to people that she focuses so much on the race of the women rather than her feelings of implied infidelity from her husband by him watching porn. How do i make my point without hurting her and fix our disagreement?",

        "text": "\nMy partner (27M) and I (25 F) have been together for 7 years now. Met in uni. After graduating, I completed my postgrad, took up work. He decided to join the armed forces. Worked for him, cool dude, empathetic human being. Overall, kind and fun to be with. Marriage was never on the table right from the beginning but his lifestyle will soon require a partner who can really support him at the cost of their own growth and career. I've worked too hard and I love my work. And grew up too strong a feminist to give up my life and work like that. He's recently started joking about introducing me to his parents as a potential spouse and I think there's thought behind the jokes. He has practical, social and logistical reasons to get married. I have none. I'm not perfect and I don't think I'm meant for marriage.\n\nCurrently, we're both independant, driven individuals who like the company of each other and respect each other's personal and professional choices. Emotionally, it's great to have each other, it's fun. We laugh together, really secure about the whole thing. 4 years of long distance now and we've only met each other few times in the past two years after really carving time out from our tight-ass schedules. It's effort given the timing, his inaccessible remote bases and my workload.\n\nWe've talked about an open relationship but we both know it's not simple, especially given our circumstances. Everytime we speak about it, he says the ball is in my court, because I'm in a social space, meeting people and everything. His work barely leaves him with time/opportunities to meet anyone and he's okay with it.\nSometimes I wonder if we'd really work if we started actually living together. Because of the distance, the little time we spend together is really fun but it's getting difficult to imagine a longer periods for me. He's the first person I connected with romantically and vice versa. However, I can't help but wonder if it's stupid of me to not explore and watch my best years pass by waiting for texts and calls, bear with long durations of no communication if he's posted remote. It's equally difficult for him I'm sure. On other days, I think I'm overthinking and I'd ruin something so beautiful. People around me have such crazy relationship issues, toxicity, trust issues, cheating, manipulation. None of that has been a problem for us. We love each other and barely fight, disagreements are respectful and easy to sort, barely any issues that couples have usually. The same goes for him. But we're in this rut somehow. It's not boredom though, we're still interested. Just not sure of where all of this is leading. Sometimes, I also sense that he thinks I'm the same person I was in uni. I've grown/changed and he calls me out often for doing things I didn't like when I was younger. I don't want to be judged for little things and growing. I'm also someone who likes to talk about my day, good/bad, everything and expect the same of him. He does not like to do that, so my sharing is probably not nice for him to hear. I barely know what his everyday issues are like. He thinks of it as whining and complaining. I don't know what to expect in the future. We talk about it but it all fizzles everytime without reaching a concrete solution.\n\nShould I consider exploring/taking a break from being romantically involved/ ending it/ open the relationship and lay down terms/ give it time/ be a hopeless romantic and years later deal with the what ifs?\n\nI know there's no right answer and I don't regret any of this yet. I don't know if I'm looking for advice, but it'd be good to get out of my head for a change and hear other perspectives from experience.\n\nTL;DR 8 years together, 4 years LDR, present seems like a comfort zone (a rut maybe) but we don't know where we're headed.",

You have to do it naturally.\n\nBut unfortunately me not posting so much on my socials anymore (because of not caring anymore and growing up) or even going to many events I don’t think it will be very “natural “ so I can’t make that promise.\n\nHe said well ok then I will keep you blocked because what’s the point? \n\nTLDR; partner of 5 years upset I never post us on socials, blocking me until I naturally post a pic together.",

It was  a relationship that honestly was something I could only dream about, and I messed all of it up. \n\n\nStarting the relationship when I was young, being 16 and no concept of what it's like to be in a relationship or treat someone, what to not say and bad habits of a young age that could make a young girl insecure, the relationship just crumbled over time. Not to mention doing so many things you just never do to someone you consider the closest to you, more than family. I just constantly wish night and day that I could be wiser, smarter, more considerate from the beginning, back when I first met her.\n\n\nI'm constantly ridden with the guilt of being such a terrible person, a terrible partner more so. I wish I was different and want to take the steps to be a better person, but before any of that, when does it stop hurting? I don't intend on talking to her ever again, it's best that I'm not a part of her life, our relationship has become toxic, and will stay that way until I change, and years worth of change as a person. I just, want to stop the hurt that cripples me to my bed, I don't want to move on, and I don't intend on either; not until I am a better person. \n\nShe is an amazing person that has dealed with years of being a partner to someone who has treated her poorly, even if there were good times and I'm ashamed of ruining our relationship to the point that she finally snapped after years.\n\n I'm sorry this has turned into a rant. But I could really use help, I'm lost and just so confused on what to do with the state I am in.\n\ntl;dr: Recently broke up with my ex because of my own inability to respect someone as a person and a partner which spans through years and it's my first break up and would really appreciate any help dealing with the mental part of a break up.",

I am begging to get sexually frustrated and let down. I feel like every time the opportunity presents itself, she always has an excuse. And I dont mean that in a bad way where she’s just coming up with random excuses, but hit has started to become a trend and pile up in a way where I almost cant see it any other way. We’ve been together for 4+ years so I really dont want to hurt her or pressure her or push her away, but I also think its fair for me to be open and honest work her and communicate how I’m feeling with the situation but I dont even know how to begin to go about this. I also feel like we are starting to lose the romantic spark that we used to have and not that sex is everything, but I feel like it’s certainly a part of it!\n\nSo, without sounding controlling or manipulative, how should I go about carefully letting her know that this has begun to frustrate me by never getting anything? \n\nTL:DR: GF rarely has sex anymore and I'm confused on the best way to communicate that frustration its causing me to her",

        "text": "Hey Reddit ! \n\nSo I (18M) have been dating her (18F) for 3 months now. We're both really in love, as well as we're enjoying this relationship. She's my first love, and my first girlfriend, so all of this is new to me. \n\nSo, my issue is basically that I keep thinking about her latest ex, like a lot. Every nice things she says to me, every \"I would die for you\", \"you're the love of my life\", \"you're so different from everyone else\" : her ex heard it too. Every naughty pics and text ? He got them too. Every nice daily things and attentions ? He got them as well. \n\nAlso, everytime we're having sex, I can't help myself but think about them doing it. The fact that she did it with someone else before me and that she enjoyed it makes me sick to my stomach. It completly ruins my mood, and sometimes cuts me off so I just fake it till she's satisfied. \n\nI'm just sick that, at one point, she loved someone as much as she loved me. I feel like I'm just the next one, that she'll eventually throw away one day, before dating someone else. I'd have prefered if, just like me, she had no experience. I just don't feel special to her. \n\nLet's make this clear, I'm NOT saying she's guilty of anything. It's her body, her mind and her choice. I'm not blaming her for having loved someone before me, of course. This is a ME problem. I just need help overcoming this feeling, it's ruining my relationship. \n\nExcuse my poor english :/ \n\nTL;DR : I hate the fact that she loved someone before me. How do I get rid of this ?",
