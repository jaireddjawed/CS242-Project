I would also have a bad conscience if I used a local AD to try on a piece and then went home and bought it on Jomashop. \n\nIf I knew I wanted a particular piece, I'd probably travel at least one city over in order to see it in person before purchasing. And, in the case of my last purchase, I would never have picked out this piece online, but in person it was clear it was a great watch choice for me. And so I like reinforcing that value by supporting those places that provide that value to me.\n\nThe warranty isn't really that big of a reason for me (even though it's one of the most cited reasons) because I A) Would probably, like most people, never use it, B) Would be willing to pay for my own repair if I did need one, and C) Am probably not going to resell most of my watches because I will have a lot of grandkids to give them to.\n\nIf there was a watch that was readily available on Jomashop and wasn't available locally or was otherwise hard to come by, I'd have no problem ordering it from there.",

The general feeling seems to be that bigger watches are more masculine. \n\nBut what if there were times when the opposite is true? There are countless posts on this sub with people who have 6” wrists wearing 45mm watches claiming that the massive watch is more masculine, whatever that means. If anything it makes their arms look smaller and thinner. \n\nSure, a bigger and sportier watch may be more masculine in itself, but wearing a smaller watch makes your arms, and by extension the rest of your body, look bigger. For some people of course this will be undesirable, but I’d say across the board there are some watch sizes (like 36mm) that look good on literally everyone unless you’re an NFL lineman. \n\nJust my two cents. I know all of this comes down to personal preference and people should buy what they want!",

I’m a fan of Longines and I’m considering buying a vintage mechanical one. Thoughts? I heard there are a lot of fakes floating around especially online. Seller has good reviews. No random guesses please. Hoping to hear from someone in the know.\n\n[url=https://postimg.cc/dLRS33Hz][img]https://i.postimg.cc/dLRS33Hz/1913-BE71-F760-4-EDE-ACCC-EE5-BEE557-FA8.png[/img][/url]\n\n[url=https://postimg.cc/w3mrK0hx][img]https://i.postimg.cc/w3mrK0hx/22726-F6-F-3781-4010-96-BD-599-B8-E6-B374-E.png[/img][/url]",

        "text": "Hi Redditors!\n\nMy co-founder and I recently exited our startup and are looking to build our next startup in the luxury watch industry.\n\nWe want to build a marketplace for luxury watches. Our previous startup dealt with security so we understand how to have a strenuous verification process for sellers, and believe we can incentivize sellers to join the market because of lower fees &amp; our ability to get traffic to the site.\n\nSites like eBay aren't niche enough and have limited supply. Specialized marketplaces like WatchCollecting seem to have a not-so-great user experience. We would be something more like CarGurus or RareCarat, letting the consumer know how great of a deal they are getting. We would offer auctions and buy-it-now options.",
