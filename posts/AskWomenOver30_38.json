        "text": "I thought software engineering was for me because I like talking to people in a social context, but I don't really like talking to people in a professional context, I dislike presenting, I don't like discussing findings in meetings and all that. Water-cool talk though I'm 100% down for it. I also love the idea of being hyper-focused on solving technical problems all day long in front of a computer.\n\nHowever, this is not what happens in reality. We have status meetings daily, and although we're supposed to be left alone to work there's always someone coming up to talk about something or mansplain something or hold forth. I'm tired of how much professional socialising is forced on me in the job, and how little focused work I can realistically do. As a result I rarely feel accomplished even when I accomplish something, because it was a a direct, focused, A to B effort.\n\nWhat are examples of a job where, genuinely, you can recreate that feeling of getting up in the morning knowing you have a full day of work ahead of you, that you are left to do in peace, and can make headway on. No daily meetings, no constant pings in the group Slack.\n\nI think translation work or copywriting is something along this lines, for example.",

This man is funny, quirky, smart and I only wish others could see how lovely his personality is! \n\nI don‚Äôt mind doing the majority of ‚Äòspeaking up‚Äô for us but sometimes I do feel ashamed to say I feel like I‚Äôm out with a toddler who has very low communication and verbal ability. \n\nThis weekend was another example. \n\nWe went out for my birthday dinner. \n\nThe waiter came over to tell us the nights specials. However the atmosphere was loud and it was very difficult to hear him. \n\nThe whole time my boyfriend is nodding like he understands. I caught most of the specials with the exception of some detail.\n\nThe waited walked away to give us time to mull it over and I asked him if he heard the specials bc one in particular sounded great.\n\nHe said no I have no idea what he said as he couldn‚Äôt hear (internally I‚Äôm thinking why didn‚Äôt you ask him to speak up?)\n\nThe waiter comes back and I‚Äôm the one to ask him to repeat the specials again. \n\nThe waiter asks us if we‚Äôre celebrating anything special and boyfriend points at me and blurts out ‚Äòbirthday‚Äô like a caveman. I smile and laugh and say yes it‚Äôs my birthday today!\n\nThe waiter asks us if we‚Äôd like sparkling or tap water‚Ä¶boyfriend just stares at me waiting to answer what he already knows‚Ä¶that we both always prefer sparkling. \n\nOrdering went ok but then the busboy coming to take our bread plates asks if he can remove our mostly eaten appetizer too and points to it. Boyfriend leans in to give the impression he didn‚Äôt understand the question and the busboy picking up the bread plates repeats himself ‚Äòstill working on the calamari too?‚Äô \n\nBoyfriend gets a panicked look on his face and stammers‚Ä¶y-yeah.\n\nBusboy leaves the calamari but I know boyfriend meant ‚Äòyeah you can take it too‚Äô.\n\nThe waiter comes by to check on dinner and asks him if foods ok. Boyfriend stares at me while we both are chewing so the waiter looks over at me instead as I cover my mouth and nod yes. At this point waiter has defaulted to just asking me any follow up questions and I‚Äôm slightly concerned and embarrassed my boyfriend is coming across a bit rude or superior to wait staff.\n\nThen the bill comes. There‚Äôs a problem where we were charged twice on on an upgrade only one of us had. Boyfriend says ah it doesn‚Äôt matter I‚Äôll just pay.\n\nI said no that‚Äôs not right. We need to tell him when he comes over.\n\nWaiter comes back to take the check and boyfriend just stares at me. I sigh, grab the checkbook from boyfriend and say listen this was a duplicate charge only I had the upgrade not both of us. Waiter apologizes and says he‚Äôll come back with a revised bill.\n\nWe pay and leave.\n\nAnd while I was so grateful for dinner, I just can‚Äôt help feeling like I‚Äôm always going to have to be the one to speak up even on the simplest of things. And wonder what will happen if we have children. \n\nAnd I also can‚Äôt help feeling scared that everyone will sympathize with his social anxiety and say I‚Äôm a bad person for not understanding. \n\nI love him, I just wish *sometimes* he could take the lead and handle certain things particularly when it‚Äôs a day or event for me.",

We currently live in his home province in Canada, in the city where his sister and parents live. I would like to relocate back to *my* home province to start a family. The catch is if we were to move, my parents would be about 1-2 hours driving distance away, and not able to be at our house at the drop of a hat...which is a perk we would enjoy with his parents if we stayed put. Personally, I think we would survive just fine having my family just a short drive away, with many of our friends (who are now becoming parents) nearby to provide support.  \nQuestion...for those of you with small children and do not have grandparents/family support super close, how hard is it? And do you regret not having your children closer to family for help?",

I beat my  husband to bleeding, and he endure this in our 11 years long marriage.\n\nI still get chills think back how I make my husband lay there on the floor and I repeatedly use all my strength to kick on his back, legs, to the point his whole leg from his thigh down to ankle were bleeding that blood pool was underneath the skin, his whole leg were fill with blue and purple blood underneath the skin.\n\nWhen the episold flare up, not only I punch him and slap him, but I also grab his hair and yank his head, smack his head down to the dinner table.

Thanks Buddhist his jobs required wear mask the whole time so nobody see his face like that. He work with Corrosive Hydroflouric Acid in Chemical plant.\n\nMy episold last shoter than 30 min but that enough time to literally hurt my husband, afterwards I regret it and think of the consequences I could face for this, I asked him why don't he called the cops and get me arrested for domestic violence, why endured these abuse 11 years long?

        "text": "Long story ahead, thanks for reading it you get to the end &amp; hopefully it makes sense. I‚Äôm feeling a lot of feels at the moment. I‚Äôm 31 and he‚Äôs 32 \n\nAbout 4 years ago I met this guy. We were in a bit of a ‚Äúsituationship‚Äù for about 5 months then it ended because I told him I wanted more &amp; he ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt ready‚Äù so I left, and gave myself space from him because I couldn‚Äôt be with him on a casual basis. I had feelings, and I wanted it to be something more so I thought it best we just didn‚Äôt see each other anymore &amp; I tried to move on. \n\n\nVery long story short - we re-connected a couple of months later and he said he had feelings for me and he wanted to move away from the city we lived in, to a smaller town. He asked if I wanted to come and start a life with him, without hesitating I said yes and we moved away within the next 4 months. \nI thought our story was really romantic, also important to note that by the time he asked me if I wanted to move with him, I was already in another relationship with a guy that he also happened to know. \n\nHe had seen me with my new man at the time a few times and he thought I was ‚Äúsettling for less‚Äù it made him sad to see me settling and he said wanted to have a life with me‚Ä¶ \nhe didn‚Äôt want to see me sad or settling, he wanted to be with me, build a life, be happy together, he had feelings for me and all that jazz etc‚Ä¶ \nHonestly, I agreed and I was not really into the new guy nor did I really think we were a good match. I was settling so I made the decision to break that off and move my life for the chance at real love. I kinda just thought ‚Äúwhat have I got to lose‚Äù. You know? \nI was really into him on so many levels, mentally, physically, emotionally (and I still am). \n\nFast forward to now - 3.5 years later. \n\nHe keeps on talking about random people we know who are getting married and how exciting it is for them, so I asked him if he ever wanted to get married (this has been discussed before but now that it‚Äôs been 3.5 years my tone was a bit more serious about it because it‚Äôs something that I really want). \nHe danced around the question and basically shrugged it off. \nI obviously got upset and said I wanted to be with someone who was enthusiastic about marrying me‚Ä¶and a conversation later he says he has been planning on doing it, he just wanted it to be a surprise and not feel like ‚Äúyou‚Äôd be expecting it, but yes of course I want to marry you, you‚Äôre the person I want to be with yada yada‚Äù. \n\nHe asked me my ring size so I found out for him and told him, then I said this was the last time I bring it up. The rest is up to you. \n\nAnyway, fast forward to a couple of nights ago, we had a couple of drinks and were quite boozed. \nHe tells me he doesn‚Äôt think we are soul mates, he only asked me to move to this stupid town with him because he ‚Äúwanted a companion‚Äù and went off on a huge rant about how there is all this pressure on him now, because I‚Äôll be expecting an engagement and proposing doesn‚Äôt feel organic anymore. \nHe even had a rant about me finding out my ring size and telling him &amp; now he doesn‚Äôt want to do it because ‚ÄúI‚Äôm expecting it and ruined the whole thing for him‚Äù.\n\nBro‚Ä¶ you asked me my ring size, of course I‚Äôm going to tell you what it is. I was excited when he asked me what my ring size was, so I wanted to help him out by finding out. I expressed this to him at the time. \n\n\nIt just makes me really sad and I don‚Äôt want him to feel like it‚Äôs a chore having to propose to me. \nI want getting engaged to be a happy time and not feel this heaviness around it. I‚Äôm not expecting it to happen immediately, I just wanted to know we are on the same page about getting married 3.5 years in. I think that‚Äôs fair?! (As mentioned this is not the first time it has been discussed, it‚Äôs just a bit more real this time because we‚Äôve been together longer). \n\nAt the time of his rant I was crying and he didn‚Äôt even realise until he had finished his\nWord vomit, then I think he realised how harsh he was being when I was visibly upset. \n\nI felt special, now I don‚Äôt. \nIf you wanted a companion and that was all, maybe you should have got a pet instead of asking me to move my life?!. \n\nAnyway, this happened 3 days ago and I‚Äôm just gutted. I just wanted to vent. \nI don‚Äôt even know why I‚Äôm writing, I just feel alone and sad. \n\n\nWe haven‚Äôt had any problems or any huge issues before this. We have a very open communication style (I thought) and I was under the impression that everything was going well. Now I just don‚Äôt know what to think. \n\nAnyway, thanks for reading.",

Absolutely zero self reflection done in the past 12 months obviously.\n\n I'm fuming. \n\nOther people have been like sure let's hang out. But this was just the most recent in a long line of shit she has done to me ever since we finished school.\n\nPart of me says just ignore her, she's not worth your time. If they want to hang out with her that's their business. \n\nPart of me says to call her out and tell her that is no chance that I want to hang out with her because the way she behaved last time I saw her was rude, nasty and inconsiderate. \n\nAnd the worst part of me tells me to make a super sarcastic remark weaponisimg the shitty names she called me last year when I didn't do what she wanted. I probably won't do this one. But I wish I  could. \n\nWhat would you do?",

As the cool kids say it, you understood the assignment. I felt like if I didn't go, I'd be upsetting about a hundred people so I went! \n\nI went to a bar across the street from where I live. It was pretty packed but I found a spot near-ish to the bar. The first few minutes there were kind of awkward because a random 60-something man kept talking to me and interrupting me watching the game but eventually some people cleared out and I sat closer to the screens. And it was so fun!! I get really into games and I did all the yelling and pointing I would do by myself and it was just... fun. Fun to be around the same energy, fun to boo when others in the room were cheering at the same time. At some point, a random guy came and asked me for my number, I politely said no thank you, and went back to the game. I stayed until the end of the game, I had two drinks, made sure to tip the bartender well and then left to meet up with my very first Bumble BFF date (which was also fun) \n\nHere's my biggest regret though: I really really wish I hadn't waited this long. NFL season started 18 weeks ago. When I left, I kept thinking \"Wow, if I had done this every week for the last 18 weeks, imagine how much more comfortable I would be and how many friends or cool acquaintances I could have had by now. Imagine how fewer Saturdays I would've spent crying because I feel alone. \" My team is out of the season now so I'm a little mad that I didn't do this sooner. \n\nSo, if you're having even the slightest doubt about doing it, please do it! Everyone is right, it's not as bad as you're making it in your head and you need to just do it. I wish I had! \n\n\\#GoPats",

        "text": "Hello ladies! \n\nRecently read a post on r/marriage where a woman was talking about how her married (specifically female) friends felt uncomfortable around single (specifically female) friends. The girls didn't know how to process and came to Reddit to confirm this bias, and many comments could concur they experienced this dynamic play out or they knew that friendships with married people dwindled either way if they were the only singleton in their friend group. \n\nAt work recently, my coworkers who were all talking about their serious, committed relationships started talking about dating. One coworker said, \"Thank God I'm not dating anymore, I hated it so much.\" To which I started to feel awkward because, well I'm still single -- so I chirped up feeling I shouldn't feel ashamed about participating, \"Yeah, omg I hate the apps. But realistically where else am I supposed to meet someone unless any of you ladies know of a handsome single male.\" My one coworker chuckled and said she didn't know anyone whose available, and then I commented, \"Yeah that's what most people say when I ask them to set me up with someone or I'd be open to a blind date, \" and my other coworker commented, \"What we mean is we don't know anyone whose good is single, because usually there's a reason they're single,\" to which she quickly stammered and added, \"Not you, of course, but usually.\" And then I promptly shut up because my singleness and attempt at joining the conversation had been made awkward. \n\nBut you see, there is a negative side that comes with being single. There's so many great comments here about how you just need to invest in hobbies, and your identity isn't in dating but so many people who do date *do* wrap their identities in it because they don't know another way of living and because there's a huge social status that comes with being coupled. Has anyone else experienced something similar to this? I've only really been made acutely aware of how important dating is around 25/26 because at work people always talk about significant others and that it's their main version of a \"personal life,\" so to speak outside of work. I used to not care about dating but the older I get the more of a weight it's been on me, because I want to be able to connect with others about the same milestones and life events. \n\nEdit: There's definitely more to life than dating, and you should definitely be ok being alone, but there's certain social privileges afforded to coupled people. (That they might not even be aware of).",

        "text": "My (31F) father (63M) provided for us while we were growing up. He sent my brother and I to top notch universities which costed him about 500k USD. And our schooling and provisions. He went through some hard times but came through for us financially. He sometimes cooked for us.\n\nAnd thats the best I can say about him. His parental engagement was minimal. My parents are divorced and our mum outsourced most child rearing to maids. And she was very abusive but that‚Äôs a whole other story. He was an extremely angry man and there was zero nurturing from him. If I didnt understand something he was teaching me in my homework, he would get angry. As I was a sickly kid, he was often irate, and would take away prescribed meds because according to him I was self medicating and needed to ‚Äôget on with it‚Äô, and would shout at me if I dropped something or didnt hear someone behind me saying ‚Äôexcuse me‚Äô. When I was in university, he would visit me and often rummage into my cupboards or toiletries and yell at me to throw them out as I was spending his money. After university I found my own way and have been financially independent since the age of 23. This man has never taught me a single skill in my life, not about saving investing taxes or DIY.\n\n2 years ago he was diagnosed with early stage Parkinsons. He has tremors and takes medication to control it. He looks a little diminished but is fit and fine otherwise and can even do moderately intense exercise.\n\nA year ago I invited him to my PhD examination. He attended, cried LOUDLY (howling) when my professors handed me my award and then tried to give a speech (I got the PhD so I should make the speech). Not even a day after that he started to treat me like a butler. His hourly requests were - get me water (he was sitting in the kitchen), make me Tea (I was in the other room and he was in the kitchen), arrange my pillows (because he did not want to look away from his laptop. He was seated on the couch and demanded I arrange the pillows he was already resting on). I cooked him dinner and he told me to serve him on his plate because it would require him to look away from his pc. The distance between the serving dish and the plate was 12 inches. He doesn‚Äôt even say please or thank you when asking for these things. \n\nI was very stressed at that time as I was moving to a new country and had to pack up my entire apartment in less than a week. Of course he did not help.\n\nAfter his dozenth request that day, I told him that he needed to be more autonomous as I had to pack. He got angry with me and said he wanted to take advantage of me being around as he hasn‚Äôt seen me in so long and it was a privilege. My brother(33M) who was there took his side and said I was being casually cruel.\n\nWhile my father has mellowed with age and does not yell at me anymore he is the same person and is just finding other ways to mistreat me. I believe that his entitlement is inexcusable.\n\nMy brother is not happy with me and insists that I am in the wrong. He wants to look after my father but also wants me to pull my weight. I really don‚Äôt want to have any relationship with either parent. What do I do?",

I think it for sure exists, and I've seen it, but I feel some locations might be more \"desirable\" for me in that sense... though I love living here. \n\nHas anyone ever tried to long distance date? That means, set your dating profile location to somewhere else, or travel there, or just be open to getting to know someone from abroad (whether you knew them before or friends set you up etc)? \n\nI know the common sentiment is \"long distance sucks\" but I've seen *so many* examples where it actually works. I've even known people who did crazy things like \"meet\" online and then meet in person and just decide to be together quickly, and they end up getting together. It ends up being a bit unorthodox for a while (long distance or one person travels or they just have their own way) but it works.\n\nI always complain about Canadian men (lol) and just the kinds of guys around, so I'm wondering if this is a creative idea I can try out. I've certainly been to places where I just felt like... my kinda guy was around more. And then if there's mutual interest, then decide what to do. \n\nThoughts?",

        "text": "I've never really been good at anything. When I was younger I was really driven to be traditionally successful in a typical career (doctor, lawyer, etc) and then kind of failed at my attempts at these things. I now am a pretty mediocre-at-best corporate employee in a career I have zero passion for or interest/goals in, but I'm staying in it because it pays decently and I chose it in a state of desperation, and I don't really have the financial safety net to fall back on. I managed to get to $50k in savings this year, but as a single 35 year old without a trust fund, I do need to start getting somewhat serious about retirement, so starting again doesn't feel like an option. I guess the problem is partially money, but also I don't really know what I want to do. I always dreamed of being a lawyer or working in politics, but as I got older, I think I realized my skills and personality might make it very difficult to be successful. I really struggle with reading comprehension and missing things, and I don't have a great tolerance for stress and am a horrible shmoozer. Plus I really hate antigonistic people, most of all, so I think I would really struggle with this, even if I feel compelled towards it on an internal level. I've also had similar strong interests in architecture and art history (many architects in my family), but again I feel like I'd be bad at it because I don't have an eye for buildings and feel like it is slightly \"off\". I've taken many career tests and I always get advertising art director, novel writer, copywriter, marketing, and social worker. Oddly I do feel like these things would probably be a fit for me, but I just don't feel drawn to them - there's no real goals there. If money were no object, I'd probably start my own small fashion label because I love making clothes. But I have no interest in entering the fashion industry for a living and want it to be a side hustle (it's really f\\*ing hard and stressful and I am aware of the shitty reality of this industry). So I guess, if money were no object and I could pay for school, I'd probably do a combo of law and architecture, but that's not financially realistic for me since in the US that easily costs half a million or more in loans. I also do want to have kids and settle down, so I guess I have to get on all of this rather quickly. My main goal is to be able to live comfortably but actually having my talents realized and being in the right place for myself, where I'm doing something I'm actually good at.",

Also the longer we have been together I realise that we actually have had such different upbringing - where he had to pay his way through life versus me, where I was lucky enough to have been provided for in life comfortably by my parents.  It‚Äôs causing problems in the marriage as what we consider ‚Äúmiddle class‚Äù and ‚Äúcomfortable‚Äù differs greatly.\n\nAll my friends and their spouses earn a whole lot more than us with highly professional jobs.  They have had help from their parents and own multiple homes already as well.  The standards I expect out of life are higher than that of my husband and I am just not sure if I will be happy with living out his definition of a good enough life. I am ambitious and I feel I have clarity over the kind of life I want with a partner - regretfully only now. It‚Äôs a strange sense of buyers remorse that‚Äôs really plaguing me.\n\nI know everyone will suggest that I get over it but can anyone help in making my sense of panic over these realisations with some wise counsel please?",

I mentioned that I realize that the type of relationship I was is not one of conflicting standards (aka, sacrificing one part of the relationship to make space for another-- this came from a Love Languages conversation) but one where we are both setting a new normal and raising the minimum standard in which we show up in this relationship. He was aghast and thinks my standards are way too high. Is that... true? **Is that an unrealistic expectation in a long-term relationship?** This has been my only long-term and serious relationship and have never dated in my adult life, so I genuinely don't know if that's too much to ask for or not.   \n\n\nA little additional context: We aren't currently living together, since I felt like I needed space to achieve clarity on if this relationship is still beneficial to each of us.
