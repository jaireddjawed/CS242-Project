Night terrors are not new to me, I have them since I was younger, but they are not as severe or frequent as before. Before vyvanse it might have happened once a month. \nBut I have been on Vyvanse for 10 days and I have had 3 night terrors so far. \n\nAny tips for avoiding the night terrors?\nShould I ask my doctor for an alternative medication?",

The double ads is really infuriating and especially nowadays with the google porn ads everywhere it feels like the whole internet needs to be omitted from my life. I use the internet daily however and have lots of things I need the internet for however nowadays I find the climate so infuriating and time wasting that stuff only gets done when I leave my phone at home. The internet as a whole feels like a trap for people with a shortened attention span nowadays. Google needs to take responsibility for their tactics with targeted porn ads at males. Unremovable shorts are criminal let‚Äôs be real here. It is a targeted trap for people with genetically short attention spans that are normally functional adults.",

        "text": "Hi! \n\nI'm curious abou how recreational use of \"Mary-Jane\" affect the ADHD brain, both on and off stimulant medication but I can't seem to find any research on the topic (on Google).\nThe only research I could find was how MJ affected ADHD brains if used to self-medicate.\n\nPersonally I've only tried it a handful of times, but that was several years ago and also before I was diagnosed. It's also not legal in my country and I'm not really comfortable with breaking the law despite my thoughts on legalization of MJ.\n\nBtw, when I say \"recreational\" I mean casual use like once or twice a week/during the weekend. Kinda like having a few drinks.\n\nThanks in advance for helping!\nAnd don't do drugs! (Unless prescribed by your doctor.)\n(And if you're gonna do drugs anyway, please research its effects first to be on the safe side.)",

She‚Äôs so sweet and means well, but her literal existence sends me over the edge. \n\nSupposedly when one of our coordinators left, she was going to take over their office (on the other section of side-by-sides). It‚Äôs been a month and a half. She has not moved. \n\nI play music, I use a fan that makes white noise, I close my door. However I make a lot of calls, so I can‚Äôt always use the fan or music, especially when it‚Äôs cold (and I‚Äôm a hot body). Headphones also aren‚Äôt an option (pain, and also needing to hear the phone ring).\n\nI hear her desk chair creek every time she leans, I hear her clanking her silverware in her Pyrex dishes every time she eats. It‚Äôs these repetitive noises that are physically painful and make me want to yell.\n\nThis one has nothing to do with Misophonia, but I get so mad every time she knocks on my door because she makes conversations unnecessarily long, and usually it‚Äôs something stupid that disrupts my workflow. Example - yesterday she wanted to show me a dirty Clorox wipe from a metal cart she wiped down. Then ten minutes later she needed to ask what bookshelf I think she should use. I don‚Äôt know, and I don‚Äôt care.\n\nAs a kid, I picked up a habit at the dentist of digging my nails into my hands to distract me from the sensation of the ultrasonic scaler. It has now crossed over to when I hear these repetitive sounds, I suppose to ground myself. \n\nBut my blood still boils and I get so obnoxiously angry, and my former coping methods aren‚Äôt doing much. I keep waiting for her to change offices, but she‚Äôs apparently not in a rush.\n\nHow do you all manage your misophonic rage at work? Hoping this might help some other people, too!",

I have been taking the lowest dose Vyvanse for about 6 months and it has been a game changer, but the only thing is it costs a lot in comparison to other medicine and there is a special procedure to get it, which requires contacting the State Agency of Medicines. There is a discount of like 80% for most medicine but not for that because of the special procedure and in order to get that you have to apply for it with reasoning and have to fill some stuff. I applied for it and it got denied because I have not taken Strattera and we do not know if it works or not. I have to try the other available medicine that already have the discount in order to get that one. I have actually tried it for two days my partner gave it to me who is also diagnosed, but i did not like it at all, it had all weird side effects and my partner had similar effects. I can't tell them that of course, but they have now asked me for any counter arguments if I don't agree with them. I have talked to 2 people who also applied for it and have not tried Strattera ever and got the discount for Vyvanse. Also I think Vyvanse is the first line of treatment for ADHD in Western countries in comparison to Strattera, but what else could I say or any ideas why Strattera is not as good as Elvanse? \n\n \n\nMuch appreciated!",

        "text": "Post ended up being a little longer than intended but I think it's crucial to read the entirety of it, I tried to keep it short and sweet but the words just kept coming up, didn't want to skip anything of substance. I tried to word it in a way people can relate. For the record, I'm in my early 20's, never been diagnosed with any mental disorder, never been to a psychiatrist. I'm posting here because I've started noticing a lot of ADHD symptoms in the last few years. \n\nI've been dealing with anxiety, procrastination and all sorts of mental blocks for ages, they've ruined my life. In the last few years I've been trying really fucking hard to find out what's wrong with me. I still can't quite put my finger on what's causing me all this suffering and what's really behind my misery.  For as long as I can remember I've had this strange looming \"pressure\" in my brain, similar to one you experience when you're thinking about something, suddenly forget and unsuccessfully attempt to reach into your memory to remember it. This sort of mental itchiness that leaves you unfocused, frustrated and exhausted for the rest of the day, because you feel like you should address something, you just don't know exactly what it is. It's not really a physical feeling, but it feels as if it is, if that makes sense.  \n\nLet's take one of my current struggles under the loupe. For over a year now I've been dealing with an injured shoulder. I should've gone to a physio months ago, but I can't bring myself to it. I don't want it \"bad enough\". I know the quicker I take care of it the better but it doesn't budge me for some reason.  \n\nSometimes while trying to find the root of this behavior I might read something inspiring and empowering, which in turn might give me the urge and motivation to grab the phone and make the call right away, it even happened today. For whole 10 seconds I really thought today will be the day I'll schedule the appointment. When I finally held the phone with the number dialed in I just froze up. Again. I don't know why, I don't think it's related to phone calls themselves because I can call a friend or order a pizza without any issues. To add insult to injury, the physio is about 100 steps away from where I live.  \n\nI can rationally come up with different possible causes that stem from my genuine worries (or don't). For example, there's no guarantee that they'll be able to help me or if rehabilitation requires more visits I'll end up paying a lot more than I intended. Both are genuine concerns of mine, but none of these things feel like that big of an issue. It's just something to consider. I'm willing to pay and I want my shoulder to be healthy so I can go back to proper functioning. It feels like there's something else at play, because this procrastination and mental blocks aren't exclusive to this one particular scenario.  When I sit, close my eyes and try to process my feelings and emotions I often end up facing aforementioned \"itch\". So I ask myself, \"Why can't I go to the doctor? What's stopping me? What's stopped me from everything else during all these years? Am I afraid? What am I afraid of? What's the worst that could happen?\" and so forth. It feels like I'm getting closer to the source, as if I'm about to have a great epiphany and reach enlightenment. There's a ball of pent up anxiety near the top of my head about to leave my body for good. But I can't make the last step, I end up getting edged and this anxiety remains stronger than before the sit-down.  \n\nI'd compare it to a math problem, you've been trying to solve this equation for 40 minutes, you know you're close but there's an issue somewhere in your calculations and you desperately search for it. You overlook the equation over and over but can't see where you went wrong and ultimately end up failing the test.  \n\nCompleting tasks and goals feels like dragging myself through the mud. To-do lists, calendars, \"5 second rule\" techniques, breaking goals into tiny bits are useless. I don't want to go through life like this, I'd rather kill myself, frankly I don't think I would procrastinate on that. It took me a year to sign up for driving lessons, even though I was easily ready after a month of studying. How do I go about fully exposing the root of my suffering? I can't take it anymore. I'm at my wit's end.",

        "text": "39/m.  I was wondering if anybody diagnosed with BOTH ADHD and OCD, feel like their OCD at times can often compensate for their ADHD?  Particular BEFORE learning about your diagnosis.\n\nI had previously researched OCD symptoms before looking at ADHD, and more things resonated with me with ADHD than OCD.  So I kinda wrote off OCD being a contributing factor.\n\nHowever, working through the screening process for ADHD, OCD has may be come into light in a different way.  I had gone back now, and looked at them when there have been seen together.  Now it looks like may be I could have both when looked at them together, instead each each of them by themselves.\n\nI also read several sources that indicate early childhood OCD is more prevalent in combined diagnosed cases with ADHD.  Reviewing something‚Äôs from childhood, that likely ‚Äúcould‚Äù be a thing.  For example, I had a lot of perfectionism tendencies from a very early age.  Like coloring as a child, I would get so upset if I made a mistake coloring outside of the lines or it not turning out the way I wanted to, I would tear it up and do the same one again until I was happy.  I also in the 2nd and 3rd grades would tear my homework up and start over if I made any kinda mistake on it as well.  I was ‚Äúlabeled‚Äù OCD by my family, but I‚Äôm not sure they realized the impact it can have.  Instead it was basically reinforced in several ways that it was a good thing to be.\n\nNow as I reflect on my past tendencies, I can may be see some patterns coming out.\n\nI also was an only child, wasn‚Äôt hyperactive, and was in advanced classes in school.  Likely contributing to things being overlooked.\n\nMy Grandfather on my Mom‚Äôs side was loosely labeled as OCD by my family.  I also believe my Dad has undiagnosed ADHD in a more classic case now that I have learned more about how ADHD can present itself.\n\nDoes anybody feel like their OCD compensated for their ADHD at different times?  Looking at it, I myself feel like my OCD MIGHT have been overpowering my ADHD at different times.  Often probably due to being driven by anxiety type of symptoms related with the different conditions.  To this day, I feel like I‚Äôm motivated the most by anxiety - and I don‚Äôt like it.

It's a daily planner (yes, I know we all have 400 of them that are used for a week before we forget to touch it and BOOM! it's gone), but what's different for me is the \"theme\". Each day you write your goal again, 3 tasks, whatever will help you, and whatever will get in the way. And the whole way it is aspected as you being a hero on a new quest, and this is your quest log. New chapters, events, story all flowing from your day-to-day questing. I love carrying it around as my quest log, and it helps me not overload my tasking for a day, and seeing what may stop me in the morning. It's also black-and-white so you can color if that helps you as well. Worth a gander if you like adventure games and think you MIGHT be able to try it in real life.\n\n[https://theherosjournal.co/collections/the-heros-journal/products/copy-of-the-heros-journal-journal-pdf?variant=43153025433770](https://theherosjournal.co/collections/the-heros-journal/products/copy-of-the-heros-journal-journal-pdf?variant=43153025433770)",

She still is behind with her academics though , she started meds about a moth ago and in that time was a week off from school due to illness and another week for mid winter recess . How long should I give her to catch up before looking into other causes of learning difficulties? She currently has a IEP and receives OT ( started last year ) and pull out help for reading and math . When we had her tested last year she had low average scores in working memory , but I was told by her doctor that could be from the ADHD .

However.. about 10 days ago I asked my doctor if I can start tapering my meds off.. I didn't want to be on them any longer. He approved of it and we decided on the way forward. We cut down my daily SSRI dosage by half. Cut to today.. I'm feeling terrible.. I'm attempting all sorts of discomfort alleviation like seeking hookups on dating apps.. eating a lot.. masturbating.. idk I'm just feeling terrible overall.. There was a party in my office yesterday and I was so out of it. I just could not socialize. People around me are amazing, but I just could not get myself to enjoy. I'd like some help with this.. also I'd like to say that I haven't yet had a chance to talk to my therapist or psychiatrist about this. My therapy is day after so really looking forward to that.\n\nTL;DR  \nI am tapering my OCD/Depression meds and the feeling sucks.. it's like going back to my pre-medication days",

I also am not able to perform socially like presentations if it‚Äôs towards the last dose. \n\nDoc is trying me on 20mg Medikinet MR but I still can‚Äôt figure out how the release work as it feels like just a 10mg for 2hours. I can continue to do my work unlike if I was not on any meds, but with a lot less focus than IR. Something I tried was taking an additional IR 10mg at the 3-4hr mark which seemed to help. Best part is I have almost zero crashes when on MR + 1 IR and I am able to perform socially/personality maintained unlike pure IR\n\nSo I have a few questions who are knowledgeable/have experience with it.\n\nBased on 3 IR 10mg/day, how much should be the equivalent for MR ? \nHow long does the second ‚Äòdose‚Äô come into affect for MR ?\nWhat are your combos that worked for you?",
