I have some questions... hope you can help me with that.\n\nCan you say something about problems with calculation of actions maximizing utility in utilitarianism (consequentalism).\n\nIf some 'calculus' can calculate consequences and choose the best one (on our preferences), and it probably can say what to do for make life happier(happiest?), why we just don't run fast for doing such thing as it?\n\nCan we achieve it? Should we? Maybe we can't achive it accurately, but we will can achieve some  allowable limit (which will be max limit)? \n\nI think it is too expensive for one man, for this time to start doing such thing. This is  unprofitable in our circumstances.\n\nThere should be another things...\n\nAlso, please tell me some criticism of utilitarianism (consequentalism).\n\nMostly, I am speaking about agent (egoistic) utilitarianism.\n\nThank you:)",

        "text": "**EDIT** - I think I forgot to mention this. \n\nI always make sure that my jokes are not done to harm others or make other uncomfortable. I happen to be someone who values self-awareness so I want to make sure that my jokes do not cross the level towards inappropriateness, even they are dark jokes or perhaps jokes that involve anything sexual. I often try to read others to know how they feel but I cannot read their minds so it often involves either guess work or trail-and-error. \n\nAnd I forgot to mention that I happen to work in an environment where crude jokes are often made towards both men and women so it kind of a part of how the people where I work with interacts mostly (thankfully, nobody crossed the sexual harassment or inappropriateness barrier, at least as much as I am aware). But I also know that it also depends on the individual - it may be offensive or too uncomfortable for someone, someone else may either find it humorous (like a dark joke), or is able to brush it off (like a sexual joke of some kind) and ignore it. Sometimes I do indeed ask them for clarification if what I did was hurtful to them so that I want to make sure that I did not do anything inappropriate (if it was to them, I would stop. **That's it!**. But sometimes, I do not know when is the right time to ask or whatever I should even ask them because I sometimes do not know if it was indeed hurtful\n\n**EDIT 2** - I think I also have to make it clear what kind of jokes I am referring to. I want to clarify this. *No touching, no inappropriate sexual advances, no mooning, no taking off trousers or shirts, no crotch touching, none of that kind of stuff. I was NOT referring to that kind of stuff*. I was referring to jokes. Simply jokes that may involve some dark humor or some kind of humor that involve sexual contention. And yes, I was also referring to certain other behaviours like flirting (appropriate flirting, mind you). \n\nI guess I forgot that different people have different perspectives of humour or what they would define as \"dark humour\" or \"humour involving sexual material\"\n\n**EDIT 3** - Apparently, this happens to be a political and personal than I thought. Apparently, different people find different levels of appropriateness, depending on their personal perspectives and their cultures, and while there are level of inappropriateness, I guess nobody likes to be policed of what to do or what to say or not say while at the same time, some people just feel like they have to police others which cause some backlash (like \"you are limiting by freedom of speech\" type of situation)\n\n____________________________________________\n\nI want to point this out very clearly - sexual harassment is wrong. **PERIOD**. It is a phenomenon where the person feels uncomfortable, insecure or sometimes even terrified because they may feel like their lives are in danger, or their health is in danger or even their job.\n\nNow, because of how many famous names have been getting a lot of infamy because of their accusations of sexual harassment that have been happening for years, I am now starting to question whether my own behaviours toward women are perfectly legal or damn right illegal \n\n(NOTE - I am mostly referring to women because the whole sexual harassment phenomenon mostly talks about women being harassed and the MeToo movement mostly focuses on women being harassed. However, sadly to say that even males experience sexual harassment and they unfortunately do not get that much attention as well)\n\nI happen to be a guy who is either bluntly honest or likes to joke around a lot. Sometimes even those jokes involve something that may be sexual or things involving sex, or I can sometimes compliment other females as well. Sometimes I even flirt to females who I really like (provided that they are into it unless they tell me to stop or tell me that they are uncomfortable)\n\nI would **NEVER** touch them. **NEVER**. No matter how tempting it is (yes, I know it is a taboo that even temptation should be avoided or not talked about but this is biology here doing the work. You cannot deny that my inner biology is influencing my emotions but at least I admit it and I know that I want to keep it under control)\n\nI know that sometimes people can feel uncomfortable by some of these jokes for personal reasons (which I often do not ask because it is not my business) and I usually stop. \n\nSometimes I even wonder if I am actually hurting these people by jokes and behaviours without even telling me and I often wonder if all these behaviours had a more negative effect on them all along \n\n(some people either are find it hard or are unable to find the courage to speak out against something that makes them uncomfortable or be truthful. Could a lot of reasons really but I encountered people who find it hard to do that kind of behaviour)\n\nAnd because of many people are suddenly speaking out against their own encounters of repeated sexual harassment which allegedly has happened before or for a long while, that makes me even wonder if my behaviours were actually more harmful than I even realised and the fact that I was not aware of it makes it even worse much scarier.\n\nI am a person who likes to be honest and speak openly. I am all for people to speak out against anything that makes them uncomfortable or even damn right illegal. \n\nBut as much as I am aware that different people have their own different interpretations of what you define as sexual harassment that must be addressed to the HR or to the police, or some people are able to shake it off, or people become easily anxious via a simple gesture or behaviour (could be becuase of a previous trauma that they encountered and have not managed to come to terms with it), or just simply flirting or joking, I feel that this phenomenon is a lot more complicated and blurry than one would might think",

        "text": "EDIT - This comes to mind the idea of happiness becoming pathological, delusional or even unprogressive like in the book \"Brave New World\" which is set in a dystopian future where people are conditioned to be happy (with their lives being controlled by a certain drug) which in actuality, the truth is much harsher than what they think\n\nIt took me a long time to convince myself that while I do feel happy most of the time, I was not *really* happy. It was more like a fake happy, if that makes sense.\n\nAfter I was exposed to the [TED talk by Barbara Ehrenreich and her criticism on positive thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xUoKGrH36E) (the more pathological kind, to be precise), I realise more that I have been trying too hard to stay happy but not actually living a fulfilling life, let alone confront whatever problems or issues were bothering me because even where I live (and even from my own experiences), anytime you are NOT happy, you are either labelled as a pessimist, an annoying person, a baggage, or a person who won't stop complaining (which can also be another pathology if done continuously) or any other kind of label that you can think of that labels the person as inhuman or some kind of disease that their presence spreads some kind of negative aura.\n\nEven when you go on whatever social media that you can think of, almost every post, every photo or every video are all about smiles and adventure and so on (well, mostly because even the opposite side is posted in its extremity as well because negative news sell more than positive news)\n\nI will admit that I often go on social media almost every 15 mins as if I am expecting to read some good news or as if I am expecting some kind of delivery  even though I am fully aware that I will probably not find anything that is worthwhile or mostly useless posts like a lot those video posts that you find on Facebook with those bold and all caps text as if they are meant to be made for teenagers, or those posts where you find \"X years ago, Y was released\" and so on.\n\nNow I am not saying that I am against having a good day or a fulfilling life or against having a more optimisitic attitude about yourself and those around you, even if the situation may not be the best time that you are experiencing. I am not saying that you cannot use your disadvantages or your downfalls to your advantage instead of allowing these dark events to take over and turn into dysfunctional behaviours and habits like depression or alcoholism, or pessimism and so on. I am not against the idea that having a more optimisitic atttitude will give you a sense of confidence or boost to still want to achieve your goals, desires and so on (NOTE - This is not the Law of Attraction type of stuff but it is somewhat similar to a certain degree)\n\nBut as I grow older, I am realising more that I am doing what I can to stay as happy as possible (especially how much pressure it is to stay psychologically stable and sane because of how pressure it is to be an adult and noticing how complicated the world is) and most of the time, I am noticing that those moments of happiness are mostly fake and not actually fulfilling or meaningful or real.\n\nI know that as humans, we experience a sheer number of different emotions and all of them have their own varieties and extremities and I know that all human emotions have their complexities, their own times to be felt and used and it requires a strong form of emotional maturity to stay in control of your own emotions instead of allowing your emotions to take control of you.\n\nBut realizing more and more than what I am doing is trying as much as I can to stay happy, I am noticing more and more than being happy is not exactly the best thing to do in your lives",

        "text": "Now, first things first - the word \"intelligence\" is a very tricky word to describe because it is very broad and not very specific and you can change that word into \"wisdom\" or \"cunning\" or \"creative\" but they are all also broad in their own ways yet specific in their own ways as well.\n\nSo in actuality, what makes a person truly intelligent versus someone who is not is mostly via their behaviours. And everyone has abilities, whether innate or learned, that other people do not have and everyone still has to continue to learn to develop new abilities or sharpen their acquired abilities over time\n\nSomeone who behaves as if they know things can sometimes think too highly of themselves while someone who actually is intelligent often think low of themselves. This is what is known as the Dunning-Kreuger effect.\n\nHowever, you cannot be either the former or the latter because humans are so complex that it is difficult to categorise humans in different groups or categories.\n\nYou can be very smart and confident in one thing but also very insecure in another.\n\nYou can very prideful in one way and you can be overly prideful in another thing but that does not necessarily mean that you are foolish or stupid.\n\nYou may encounter people who have degrees but are overly confident and you may encounter people who are not very wise but think too highly of themselves and have high egos or encounter people who are down on their luck but are apparently very wise and insightful and self-aware and have a lot of potential.\n\nAnd of course, everyone is still learning about everything in a variety of different ways and not necessarily limited to taking classes or reading books (sometimes you even learn more things about subjects that you are already more familiar with, or even gain  more refined information or perhaps even entirely novel information about subjects that you are already more interested in or proficient in)\n\nAnd there are also tons of statements out there that teach the importance of self-awareness and the paradox of confidence and intellect like \"Fools think of themselves as wise while wise people think of themselves as fools\".\n\nThere is also a famous expertise level known as the proficiency skill, starting from novice to expert.\n\nBut in the end, it is very hard to find that balance between confidence and the other side that are not so confident or things that you are do not like to experience like vulnerability or ignorance or lack of knowledge.\n\nYou can learn something in an instant, maybe via previous personal experience or via great problem-solving or learning ability, or you can learn something slowly and slowly over a certain time period (and it is often the latter that is more recommended. There is a reason why education systems and university course often take years or martial arts practioners often take years or even decades to become masters)\n\nThis is something that is very confusing for me to find a balance for.\n\nI often try to avoid making quick judgements, especially on things that I am not exactly familiar with, because it could be inaccurate because of a hasty brain or because of heuristics hijacking my unconscious.\n\nI often try to avoid personal beliefs or judgements get in my way to making choices or how I think about a certain situation.\n\nI often try to think before I act and use socratic/critical thinking to make accurate and sound judgements (but when I cannot, I often try to be level-headed and quick but decisive)\n\nI often try to be very analytical and often try to verify every info that I encounter before I make a decision because I know that some info may be invalid or untrue or not as factual as you might think. \n\nI often try my best to be the most conscientious as possible in areas that I do not actually as the expertise in (as in, no actual formal education in like a degree or something) like that even if I do the best research that I can, but at the same time, I keep telling myself that my words may not have the same impact as the person who has more expertise in (for example, I happen to be a big fan of philosophy and history but I often rely on experts or people who had actual education about the subject before I make an opinion or a statement. Sometimes I rely more on the opinions of experts over mine)\n\nBut apart from these precautions, I am still not sure how I can be confident about my abilities and judgements without going either too far in my own confidence and self-efficacy, or letting my own uncertain side or my anxious side (apparently, those with higher IQ scores often have anxiety disorders or are more anxious and I sometimes feel anxious all the time especially when it involves my own confidence) getting in the way of my judgement and problem-solving.\n\nHonestly, this is very cryptic and very confusing to find a balance for because it is a simple phenomenon where you can be in an either-or situation as different situations will put you in different positions and you have different mentalities and feelings and even pre-conceived judgements, emotions, beliefs and biases in a wide variety of different situations.\n\nSo it is very hard to put yourself in the centre of all these situations and still able to make sound choices and be the most efficient in your energy and cognitive prowess when it comes to different situations, no matter what or where they are - whether it involves quick decision-making or very anxious situations or even in the most calm or least provoking of situations\n\nHow can you be sure that you know what you are doing when you are doing something vs when you *think* you know what you are doing?\n\nHow can you be confident about your intelligence/abilities without allowing this confidence to go too far or without allowing your own insecurities take a toll in your decision-making/problem-solving?",

        "text": "Now I know what you are thinkinghere but hear me out before you downvote this post.\n\nTo some extent, ignorance is good because it will help you become aware of something that you are not aware before. Could be something about yourself or perhaps some new knowledge that we were not aware of before.\n\nAnd of course, I do not like the idea of ignorance either, especially in the case of willful ignorance of anything that does not fit your agendas and rely on evidence that prove your inherited bias, whether they are authentic or not, which is a scary phenomenon especially when the White House gave the phrase [\"alternative facts\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_facts) to defend  White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer in his first press briefing where he accused the media of deliberately underestimating the size of the crowd during Trump's inaugural ceremony\n\n(and of course, all the other dangerous acts of willful ignorance such as believing that [global warming is a hoax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2euBvdP28c), believing that [vaccines cause autism](https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/articles/do-vaccines-cause-autism] and so on)\n\nHowever, I am mostly referring willful ignorance in a more \"positive\" approach, if such a thing even exists.\n\nIn [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqevO_zrxsA) (**NOTE** - Yes, I know that this is a video from CollegeHumor and it is a parody and probably not related to reality at all. However, despite its ironic humor, there is a possible truth to this) points out how the era of the information age and our exposure to countless of vast knowledge on the consequence of our everyday actions make us more cautious and vigilant than anything.\n\nEven in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAVPDYhW_nw&amp;vl=en), which focuses on the benefits of meditation and mindfulness, a practice where a human being trains his/her own mind to be fully engaged in the current situation, both physically and mentally, and be in a state of flow, there is a piece in that video which references a quotation in the book \"Homo Deus\" by Yuval Noah Harari which states that [\"In ancient times having power meant having access to data. Today having power means knowing what to ignore.”](https://www.marinate.life/in-ancient-times-having-power-meant-having-access-to-data-today-having-power-means-knowing-what-to-ignore/)\n\nThis is somehow especially true in the era of today where we are constantly flooded with so much information about pretty much everything in the world that it would be frustrating to keep up with everything and can make the person feel like they are in a constant state of anxiety and pressure.\n\nSo even though that the era of information and constant change in the world of today, can ignorance be a positive human behaviour to some degree?",

Some argue that you aren't the one cheating so it's okay, some argue that you are helping the cheater or cautionning what he does by having sex with him/her so it's not okay.  \n\n&gt;Is it ethical to support or listen to an artist who does immoral things ? Some say that it's not our job to make justice and we don't have to boycot him/her morally speaking, some say that by listening to the artist you provide him money and help him/her to do harm so it's not okay.  \n\n&gt;Is it okay to sell ammos to a person who will kill with them (and you know it) ? Most people agree that it's not okay there, but still some argue that you only use your right to sell and are not responsible for the killer's actions.\n\nA pattern seems to be that \"If you know that your action will make X happen and think that X is immoral, is your action immoral ?\"\n\nI don't want to debate any of the example, I used them to try to show the pattern. I wonder if someone has good thoughts to share about the general aspect of that debate.  \n\nNote :  \nI'm really not interested in the debate about a specific example at all, if you think that an example has more into it than the pattern I described and want to say \"yeaaah but here there is a question of responsibility/fairness/rights...\" :  \nIt may be really interesting, but it doesn't concern my question. \n\nI want to stay in the really abstract and learn about the general case/pattern more than using arguments and thoughts taking the examples out of the pattern.\n\n(Explaining that the pattern doesn't exist at all and why would also be a good thought though)",

        "text": "It sounds pretty contradictory to make laws or limitations within the phenomenon involving warfare as war itself is ugly, destructive and deceiving as well and shows the many ways of how destructive and cunning humans can potentially be during times of conflict.\n\nOn a certain perspective, it is understandable to limit certain activities during warfare such as [potential war crimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime) or making the [rules of engagement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_engagement) for military personnel (even though many countries or even PMCs break those rules constantly), especially after witnessing the destructiveness that happened during the 20th Century, from  [Chemical weapons in World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_weapons_in_World_War_I), the war crimes committed during WW2 such [the Namking Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanking_Massacre) and [civilian casualties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_casualties_of_strategic_bombing), and all the [napalm](https://vietnamawbb.weebly.com/napalm-agent-orange.html) used during the Vietnam War\n\nOn the other end, it sounds very contradictory to do so because while some weapons are deemed as \"illegal\" because they cause [\"unjustifiable sufferring\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3SeWQ7XMIk), even every other weapon or tactic used in warfare causes suffering that nobody would deem as justified from other side of the war, from gun shots to the shrapnel of a grenade, to even bombings and PTSD, anxiety, hunger and sleep deprivation and so on because war itself *is indeed a phenomenon that provokes suffering that no human deserves or wants*\n\nI can understand these limitations to some degree in order to limit unwanted sufferring or unnecessary collateral damage especially when history tells us how much destruction previous wars have done. But on the other hand, it feels very conflicting to what warfare is because ... well, it is war after all. It provokes aggression, destruction, and many other acts that cause many forms of pain and sufferring, which can be physical, psychological or even environmental (loss of homes or shelter, loss of food or crops and so on) and even though these limitations exist, different nations have broken these rules before like Syria with their chemical weapons, torture done by the CIA, the Guatemalan genocide during the Guatemalan genocide/ the Silent Holocaust, and so on.\n\nEven if certain armies or nations will follow these rules and laws to avoid further sufferring, there is no telling if the enemy will be doing these unlawful actions in secret that will cause further damage to their enemy or further collateral damage that will give them an advantage during times of war",
