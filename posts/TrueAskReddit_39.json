        "text": "I don't want this discussion perpetuating gender roles or sexism, however I want a reflective look at visual cues that indicate a possibly toxic relationship. I think the single best advice I have been given about potential partners is that:\nIf your guy/girl friends approve of your partner of their own respective gender, its a good indicator of that person.\nHowever, whenever I tried to pinpoint specific traits that have seemed appealing or unappealing, it seems they all came to a consensus with no conscious analysis. There seems to be a inherent ability to identify within our own gender \"red flags\" of a potential suitor for the opposite sex. I have a rather pragmatic and lax approach at relationships, so it was not until recently I started analyzing the cues of my own troubled relationships. I have to admit my own shortcoming in a few of my relationships, and as a person. But the fact of the matter is there was a pattern of certain types of toxic characters I had dated. Ive met people who have tried guilting me for sex, sucking up my assets or using me as a emotional bedrock for their issues. I hope I make this clear, I don't harbor any bad feelings for these people, from an objective standpoint they were all good people attached to some unhealthy habits. But I do feel it is unproductive to keep falling victim to a cycle of unhealthy relationships when there must be some sort of indicators. The reason why I picked visual cues is because I view these visual cues as the most primal form of indications to one's psyche. The reason being is, from my experience, if someone is attracted to \"you\" they are already trying to put forth their best assets. Only once you begin dating due these habits unravel. However the way one present their appearance seems to stay stagnant with or without the relationship. Ive also had uncomfortable sexual advances in my workplace and was wondering if it could have been avoided if I had identified potential perpetrators before. \nSo I want to offer two theoretical scenarios for the question:\nGuys, if a girl friend of yours brought to you her new boyfriend what are some visual warning signs that you could identify?\nGirls, if a guy friend of yours brought to you his new girlfriend what are some visual warning signs that you could identify?\n\nI hope the comments refrain from any derogatory language and instead helps promotes a objective discussion for potential partner selection.\n\nI would also like to apologize for my broken english, I am not a native english speaker and if their are any grammatical errors, I am deeply sorry. m(_ _)m",

        "text": "James Flynn convincingly argued that average IQ has been steadily rising since the 1930s.  High IQ scores are strongly correlated with academic success, although there is some debate over what IQ *really* measures.  However a few years ago I looked through my late grandfather's old schoolbooks and was shocked at how hard the material was.  Contemporary teenagers wouldn't have stood a chance.  What gives?   \n\nFor example [here](https://twitter.com/michaelbd/status/757699439406571525) is an entrance exam for an **Irish secondary school in 1913.**  The applicants would have been about **12 years old**, even though the school was called a \"college.\"  \n\nI would not have been comfortable with this kind of math until I was about 14 or 15, and I would have done the equations with the help of a calculator.  I went to a public school noted for academics, and I was a honours student for all four years.  I am currently enrolled in a brass ring kind of program at college and am likely of at least average intelligence, *pace* reddit. \n\nGrandpa's English textbook read like it was for college students, it had no pictures and the assigned readings for \"The Modern Period\" started with Henry James and ended with Virginia Woolf.  James Joyce was dismissed as \"intolerable.\"  Yet in the current year, students read YA and popular fiction all the way through to grade 12, and wikipedia makes it very easy to not read any of the classic lit that still gets assigned.  My brother's ex has read only one book in her entire life: Sweet Valley High.  When I ask girls what books they like the answer is usually Harry Potter, and I've given up asking the boys, period.\n\nThese Irish kids may have been part of a small elite, but in 2016 the private school brats aren't doing much better than the commoners.  It's basically just an expensive prop to their parents' vanity, not a higher quality education.  \n\n**tl;dr: So if IQ is at an all time high, why are educational standards so poor, even among the elites?**  \n\n**Some people are mad I didn't provide sources, so here are a few:**\n\n&gt;[A century ago, students were being assigned books with the complexity of around the ninth- or 10th-grade level. But in 2012, the average was around the sixth-grade level.\"](http://www.npr.org/sections/monkeysee/2013/06/11/190669029/what-kids-are-reading-in-school-and-out)\n\n&gt;[When the OECD tested half-a-million 15-year-old students around the world in a test known as PISA in 2012, US teens came in 27th place in math, below their counterparts in Estonia, Latvia, Vietnam, and Spain.](http://qz.com/638845/americans-are-spectacularly-bad-at-answering-even-the-most-basic-math-questions/)\n\nThe sample size for those studies was 8.6 million for the first one, and 0.5 million for the second.  Maybe Americans' math skills are only getting *relatively* worse, but there is no denying that they are becoming less literate.  I don't know how the rest of the world fares, I'm from Canada and our education system is very similar to the one down in the 'States.  ",

        "text": "I'm a center-right journalist who has involved himself in a debate over the limits to our modern iconoclasm. Put simply, some of the imagery, symbolism, and monuments that our government puts to use are tainted by an association with an impure past. To what extent should we remove these symbols, or topple these monuments, in the service of honoring only those things which we can be proud of today?\n\n\nThe question is an inflammatory one, certainly. One's heritage can be one of the most important identity-forming markers in a person's life. But we (the people) have the burden of deciding what we will use in our American self-presentation, i.e. in our symbolism and imagery and iconography.\n\n\nThis issue came to the forefront once again over Alexandria, VA's decision to have Jefferson Davis Highway be renamed, and to request that a prominently placed statue of a Confederate solider be relocated to a different, less prominent part of town.\n\n\nI [took the position that there is a distinction between backward-looking monuments and forward-looking monuments](https://thearcmag.com/last-saturday-the-city-council-in-alexandria-virginia-voted-unanimously-to-change-the-name-of-e10544ad386f#.mdq8km7tf). The former should be in museums, because they teach us about our past. The latter should be the ones we use to signal who we are and who we are still striving to be. As such, I take the view that Confederate symbolism should be disqualified from serving in this second capacity, that is, as a heralding monument. I don't say this because I view myself as morally superior to the men who fought for the Confederate cause. It's simply a conclusion based in what I believe we should utilize in projecting our ideals moving forward.\n\n\nIn my opinion, Washington and Jefferson memorialization in public spaces is wonderful, since their achievements are singularly significant for our country and we remember them for these pivotal contributions and not for their views on slavery. But the Confederacy is different: it was an attempt to permanently subjugate a people group to bondage and to organize society around this activity. A Confederate solider, remembered in his capacity as such, therefore cannot be extricated from his association with this cause.\n\n\nThoughts?\n\n",

        "text": "I read an article a while ago that studied how social networks became more and more homogenized over time to eventually become an echo chamber.\n\nFor example, most people have a tendency to want to cluster together to people who are like them and have a similar opinion. They then form a group and those with dissenting opinions are down voted or not as easily heard. Because of this, they leave the network and the group becomes more and more homogeneous.\n\nThis process continues and is cyclical until there are almost no one with dissenting opinions left.\n\nI remember there was either a good post about this or an article out there describing this phenomena. However, I can't remember what exactly this is called or how I read it. \n\nDo you think this phenomena commonly happens on Reddit? Do you think Reddit's upvote / downvote system creates a strong environment for an echo chamber?\n",
