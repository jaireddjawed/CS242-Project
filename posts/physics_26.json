        "text": " \n\n# Einstein proven Right Again\n\nAlbert Einstein's theory of general relativity has passed the most rigorous test to date. One of the core principles of general relativity is the weak equivalence principle. It says that the inertial and the gravitational mass are proportional. Testing the weak equivalence principle is important because Einstein's entire theory is built on it. Thanks to the MICROSCOPE experiment, we now have the most precise results concerning the equivalence principle.\n\nWhat is the inertial and gravitational mass? Remember the two formula, one is Newtons basic force is equal to mass times acceleration...\n\n***F=m*** **x** ***a***\n\n..and the other is Newton’s gravitational formula where the force of gravity is equal to the product of the gravitational constant and the two masses...\n\n***Fg=G*** **x** ***M*****x** ***m*****/*****r2***\n\n...such as the planet and an attracted body, divided by the square of distance separating them, well way back when Einstein was getting started he said that there is no difference between the force of gravity acting on a body and the force caused by acceleration, as in an astronaut in a space ship gunning his engines. The force caused by acceleration would be the force the astronaut feels holding him down, the inertial force and the force of gravity when he is standing on the earth, that’s the gravitational mass.",

They are depleted quite quickly so I need to change them quite frequently. \nWhilst sorting them one by one, I wondered if there would be an easier way to do this and tried weighing the batteries and discovered that the dead ones weighed more, around 1.87-2.04g — whereas the new ones weighed around 1.70-1.89g consistently (sample size was quite small ~30, and this was a side quest and i had to get back to work so I couldn’t test it ur further). \n\nI tried googling this but all the questions online seem to ask the opposite (that dead ones weigh less). \n\nI doubt the answers about the electron mass are relevant in this case as the batteries are tiny and thus it would be negligible. The fact that the dead ones seem a little swollen makes me think theres a chemical reaction going on somehow but is it possible for this to happen in the span of around 30 minutes? Especially since the batteries are sealed.\n\nWhat’s going on in those forbidden nuggets I’m very curious, could someone help explain please?",

Suppose you know all the fundamental laws of Nature, the properties of the elementary particles and the forces at play between them. How can you turn this knowledge into an understanding of the world around us? More concretely, if I give you a box containing 10²³ particles and tell you their mass, their charge, their interactions, and so on, what can you tell me about the\nstuff in the box?*\n\n*There’s one strategy that definitely won’t work: writing down the Schr¨odinger equation for 10²³ particles and solving it. That’s typically not possible for 23 particles,\nlet alone 10²³. What’s more, even if you could find the wavefunction of the system, what would you do with it? The positions of individual particles are of little interest\nto anyone. We want answers to much more basic, almost childish, questions about the contents of the box. Is it wet? Is it hot? What colour is it? Is the box in danger of exploding? What happens if we squeeze it, pull it, heat it up? How can we begin to answer these kind of questions starting from the fundamental laws of physics?",

Underdeveloped/damaged brain? A broken receptor. \n\nHowever, if consciousness comes from \"somewhere\", it would most likely have to be instantaneous, therefore confirming that \"something\" can be in two places at the same time, sharing information at instantaneous speeds. \n\nThen, at the moment of death, the \"original\" consciousness tries to find another receptor, therefore making reincarnation into any living thing a thing. The new brain adjusts/sync over time, which might explain the somewhat rare occurences where kids say things they shouldn't know, or \"remember past lives\".\n\nAnd if this phenomena is atemporal, that somehow consciousness transcends time, it could suggest that consciousness could point to a receptor in the past as well. \n\nIf that's the case, it lights up the possibility that consciousness might be singular, and it being able to jump back and forth through time, every person, animal, alien etc that has ever lived is just a single \"being\" that is shaped by the \"past\", \"present\" and the \"future\".\n\n\"I was Hitler. I was Einstein. I was Plato. I was every jew tortured, I was every slave to ever exist, I was every rich man, I am you, and you are me, and I will be everyone\" - how does that sound? Have I just implied that the Universe is \"me\", and that consciousness is the means of the universe to \"exist\"?\n\nWhat do you think?",

Sapphire Rapids / Genoa (the newest generation of servers from Intel/AMD respectively) require \\*way\\* more cooling than their predecessors and the upward trend in cooling required is steep. I figure this must be a problem humanity is going to have to solve.\n\nOne friend suggested black body radiation - perhaps with a material that has high emissivity.\n\nCurious to see what other thoughts people have?

I suppose I could work my way through a textbook but wondering if anyone else has alternative approaches from experience. Appreciate any recommendations!",

I’m looking for an answer to a thought experiment I thought of a couple of weeks ago and that’s been bugging me ever since. I’m about halfway through my (electrical) engineering degree but the only thermodynamics class I took was in Highschool and I don’t remember much from it other than the ideal gas law (saying that to give you a way to gauge my physics and maths knowledge). The thought experiment goes like this:\n\nImagine that there’s a 10x10x10 cm^3 copper cube the internal workings and contents of which are unknown. The only thing known about the cube is that it’s always 0.01 degree K hotter than the temperature of its surroundings. The temperature of the cube changes instantaneously with the temperature of its surroundings. How would one go about harvesting that small energy difference using current physics? Would it be possible to use that cube to power the world? Or would the cube become just cool but useless r/interestingasfuck material? Cutting the cube open to study and improve upon the energy generating process is forbidden. \n\nI’m sorry if it’s a stupid question. I’m looking forward to your answers!",
