        "text": "Hi guys, I just wanted to know what your opinion is regarding Straub/Huillet's films. A bit of a backstory, I work as a projectionist in an european cinematheque (not gonna name the country) and this past month we've been doing a retrospective on Straub/Huillet's work. Due to the nature of the work itself I've only been able to watch two of their films entirely - those being The Chronicle of Anna Magdalena Bach and The Death of Empedocles - but I've caught bits and pieces of a lot of their other films. My question is this: how do you look at the works of Straub/Huillet? From my point of view they seem to focus a lot on speech, while the shots don't seem that impressive. So far I'm really thorn because I want to watch more of them and learn more about their body of work but, at the same time, their method of filming doesn't really appeal to me. Just wondering what your thoughts are on this duo so that maybe, in the future, I can have a different understanding of what exactly they were trying to accomplish.",

        "text": "Personally, I used to love Wes Anderson. In my opinion he peaked around the Rushmore - Life Aquatic era. The Darjeeling Limited was Anderson’s attempt to break out of his style and try something different, but it wasn’t very well received. So what did he do? He doubled down on the style that he had already perfected and maxed out in Life Aquatic.  I was perplexed when Moonrise and Budapest got their universal rave reviews. He was making the same movies as Life  Aquatic.  \n\nLet me say that the Royal Tenenbaums is my favorite of his films. It was the perfect balance of preciousness and real human emotions.  Life Aquatic veered too much into the artificial emotions that he’s now doubled down on, and Darjeeling was his attempt to escape but got tepid reviews. When Moonrise came out and Wes Anderson was finally appreciated by the general public for the formula he had already somewhat perfected. There’s wasn’t any growth from him as a filmmaker. He stopped taking chances.\n\nHis career isn’t over, but I don’t see Anderson taking the same chances as Darjeeling ever again. But who knows? I honestly think what marks a good filmmaker is their risk-taking. And an organic growth. He just seems bored behind the camera. Yes the set designs are exquisite and the sheer star power he accumulates is great, but there’s nothing really new since Aquatic. And at this point I don’t see it changing. I think that’s why he goes back to Stop Motion Animation every so often to recharge from making another of the same movie. \n\nAgain, I love Wes for his truly visionary and unique style. I just don’t think his filmic vocabulary and philosophy is diverse/big enough to warrant making the same movie over and over again. Ozu basically made the same movie over and over again but they all said something different, but we’re at the same time part of a whole. Koreeda is the same way. Along with Truffaut.  Altman to an extent as well. \n\nSo how will Wes be remembered? I think he’ll be remembered similarly to Tim Burton.  Or maybe that’s being too harsh lmao (Scissorhands, Ed Wood, and Big fish are good though). \n\nWhat is his filmic legacy?\n\n",

        "text": "I find that I can't get into most horror movies. When the whole thing is about finding out what this creature trying to kill them is, it drags me out of the characters fearing it more than they do just find it curious and odd. When the characters continuously don't give up on each other, I feel as though they haven't been struck down to their most primal instinct yet. When the characters continuously try to hunt down and kill the threat instead of escaping it (unless they're stuck with it in an enclosed location), I feel as though they still perceive the threat as overcome-able. \n\n**Movies that I feel fit**\n\nMost of *Evil Dead (2013)*\n\nBesides the brother/sister plot. When they're stuck with a friend  who's turned, they're very, very quick to turn on each other. \n\n*The Descent* \n\nI feel as though the girls only stick with one another to feel safe and are quick to scatter and abandon each other when a creature actually shows up. \n\nThe last few minutes of *Blair Witch*\n\nOnce the characters enter the house, the fear is very visceral and the only goal becomes leaving it, which proves to be progressively impossible. \n\n*REC*\n\nBy the end as more and more characters die or become infected, the mystery of what is going on becomes secondary and any revelations become coincidental. \n\nThe first scene in *28 weeks later* \n\nI'm just saying the first scene because that's all I remember. A family's home becomes overrun with zombies. No spoilers just watch it. \n\n*Detroit* - not a \"horror\" movie\n\nBut the middle section is horrifying and fits the criteria and has stuck with me. \n\n**In conclusion,** I feel as though better horror movies focus on instilling fear in the audience through the characters, the actions they take, and what the actions they take imply about their psychological state, rather than trying to instill fear in the audience directly, which I feel has resulted in the pop-up scare epidemic. I don't care what the internet says, pop-up scares ARE effective, I jump every time. But I don't go home thinking about them. The internet is right though, they're lazy and easy. 30 seconds of silence, a character has a scared face, the camera moves slow, a little musical build up and then BANG LOUD VISUAL/ NOISE GOTCHA BITCH. Yeah, you did good fuckin job this movie is still bad.  \n",

I think, partly, camp stylistically draws so heavily on things like old b-movies and post-war cheap roadside architecture and consumerism that was more prevalent in North America but perhaps this is a false generalization. I know there are a lot of 1970s Italian Giallo’s that are very campy, in retrospect...but I’m wondering if that was actually deliberate?",

        "text": " Edge of Tomorrow is a movie about ethics at its core.\n\nNow the surface level reading is that Rita and Bill are able to use the primary science fiction conceit - the Groundhog day style resetting of time - to maximise good and wellbeing for all humans, even if it requires great suffering on their part, that being the experience of dying again and again. A utilitarian sacrifice. But that’s just logical. Given such power to save the human race, wouldn’t anyone put in their position be **ethically compelled** to see the mission through, and slay the Omega?\n\nBut instead of looking at broader ethical frameworks, what if we delved into the philosophy of Kant?\n\n[https://markmanson.net/the-one-rule-for-life](https://markmanson.net/the-one-rule-for-life)\n\n…Ethically Compelled…\n\nWho said that every single human being weren’t ethically compelled to fight the alien invasion *even if you didn’t have the ability to come back in time after you died*? Think about it. If the survival of the very human species is at stake, shouldn’t *every single able person volunteer to fight?* Wouldn’t that what we hope to be a *universal maxim* that everyone should live by? That if our entire species was threatened with extinction, we would all band together to try and work together to save each other instead of fleeing from the challenge and simply accepting total extinction?\n\nEdge of Tomorrow is a movie about *personal ethics*.\n\nBill in the beginning is a coward. Everyone knows that. But contrast him with J Squad. Contrast him with the General. Contrast him with Rita. Contrast him with Dr. Carter. Contrast him with *every single other character in the movie*.\n\nEveryone BUT Bill, from the moment the movie starts, have gotten on with it. They’re all on the same page. Bill is the one who stands out.\n\nKant’s categorical imperative: accept no maxim by which you would not apply universally.\n\n“I’ve helped millions of people enlist in your army, General” - one of Bill’s first lines.\n\nBill believes that his “unique talent” of charisma is doing its part in the grander vision of the counterinvasion. But essentially, he’s adopting an asymmetric maxim, and not a universal one. *EVERYBODY ELSE* can go die to the aliens, but *BILL* does not have to because his advertising/media skills that he developed running his advertising firm before the aliens attacked gives him the *unique ability* to drive the counterinvasion’s enlistment efforts. He is trying to transmute one good work into another, but it doesn’t *work* that way does it? We all intrinsically know this. Simply because Bill convinced millions of people to enlist, does not mean he has contributed to the effort in the same way that those people who enlisted did. He is, in fact, an officer, and should be leading by example.\n\nBill is in fact using other human beings as a *means*. He believes, in a utilitarian way, that his works - convincing everyone to enlist - outweighs his universal responsibility. That is, because he was able to send *so many* people to their deaths, that he should not have to die. Just laying it out there and the awfulness of this cowardice is pungent and nauseating. Convincing people to enlist is not the same as choosing to serve yourself.\n\nAnd so, Bill begins what I like to call The Suck. Edge of Tomorrow is brutal, cruel to its characters beyond any sense of conceivable imagination. It breaks Bill down to his very core, and then keeps hammering away until nothing is left. Bill must completely destroy his ego to rebuild his entire personality by dying *thousands and thousands and thousands* of times, and worse, *seeing the people he has come to care about die in front of him thousands and thousands and thousands* of times. They say that great fiction makes the characters struggle, and oh boy, do these characters struggle.\n\nNow, EoT is obviously inspired by Groundhog Day, so let’s go look at the philosophy of Groundhog Day for a bit. Groundhog Day is way more tame than Edge of Tomorrow, all Phil really has to deal with in *his* day to day is the ennui and dreadful boredom of Punxatawney, Pennsylvania. He doesn’t have to deal with acidic alien blood melting his body, or Rita putting a bullet in his brain, or getting ripped apart limb from limb. At best, he just has to deal with the annoyance of an overeager insurance salesman and a few cold showers. Phil gets it easy man!\n\nNonetheless, his curse is still frightening on a deep level. Nietzsche’s concept of “Eternal Recurrence” is that the universe is simply going to replay itself once it ends (which is frighteningly similar to actual astrophysical theories of the “Big Crunch” to follow the “Big Bang”) and that one must confront the possibility that our lives could be replayed on endless loop, every detail permanently set into place, always to repeat itself upon our death. Or, as Rust Cohle would put it, “Time is a flat circle”. Here’s the nuance: Nietzsche knew he couldn’t prove that Eternal Recurrence was capital T the Truth, but what really fucked with him was the question of what if? What if Eternal Recurrence WAS true? Kind of like Pascal’s Wager, one had to live one’s life accepting that possibility, no matter how small.\n\nPerceiving such a truth, then, in a hypercollapsed microcosmic 2nd of February, is what Phil must endure because unlike Bill, who is told by Rita very early on that if he survives the day then he will lose the reset (thus framing the reset ability as a gift, the one secret weapon humanity has to take down the aliens, and not a curse) Phil has no fucking idea how to get rid of the resets, and he has to at some point accept the possibility that it will indeed go on forever: February 2nd in Punxatawney would be Phil’s universe, infinitely.\n\nLet’s go back to Nietzsche. Here’s the thing: Nietzsche had a really shitty life, and his philosophy was probably partly a way to help him deal with the fact of how shitty his life was. Poor guy got rejected all three times he proposed to the love of his life, probably had a brain tumor and some sort of degenerative intestinal condition, and what’s worse, everyone thought it was syphilis that he picked up from a hooker. He died pretty young.\n\nBut nonetheless, in life, he soldiered on. Touching only upon Eternal Recurrence, Nietzsche’s view was that even if our lives were to repeat eternally, we should find joy in it. We should embrace every happy moment we receive as uniquely our own, accept the meanings we claim from our tragedies and suffering, and reject any traditional or dogmatic moral code that might try to reinterpret our lives otherwise. This is called “Amor Fati”, or Love of Fate, and that’s basically what Phil finds. Phil learns to embrace Punxatawney, to be a kind and better person even though he knows it’s ultimately going to be reset. But even though it’s reset, it’s not meaningless. If that’s all there is… then it’s very far from meaningless.\n\nIf Phil must repeat February 2nd infinite times, would he rather the residents of Punxatawney, Pennsylvania live their infinite February 2nds in JOY, surprised at this magnificent stranger who saves Buster’s life, catches that kid who falls from the tree before he breaks his leg, sculpts awesome ice statues, and is absolutely the hottest item on the post-Groundhog bachelor auction?\n\nOr would Phil rather the residents of Punxatawney, Pennsylvania live their infinite February 2nds in DISGUST at this tyrannous jackass who somehow manages to rob Felix at the precise moment always and then goes to seduce Nancy Taylor and dress her up as a French Maid, and God knows what else evil Phil could have gotten up to in the millenia of reliving February 2nd that he had to endure? I mean let’s be real, he probably murdered someone before he started killing himself.\n\nAmor Fati, is, in fact, the exact same thing Bill must learn. He must learn to embrace the glorious crucible of battle. Why should Amor Fati be limited to a universe of Eternal Recurrence? Remember, Nietzsche was troubled by the *possibility* of Eternal Recurrence, which means that Amor Fati should be generally applied given the unknowability of Eternal Recurrence. And why not? One must learn to accept whatever struggle, suffering, or trial one must encounter in one’s life, that is the common thread. When we combine the concept of Kant’s categorical imperative with the concept of Amor Fati when applied to Bill Cage’s situation in Edge of Tomorrow, we realise that in embracing the resetting as a GIFT, it suddenly makes all the suffering that he actually does go through seem inconsequential compared to the greater whole.\n\nI mean, talk about an awesome power! Bill has the ability to correct every mistake he ever makes! He almost always gets one more shot (until he doesn’t, when they raise the dramatic stakes, but let’s not delve too much into that because then we’re really going to have to tangent into the philosophical concepts around the idea of luck).\n\nIf you think like that, then what’s pain? Death is made meaningless when you have the reset ability because Death is not Final. When Death is not Final… then what’s pain? What’s suffering? It’s a transient thing to be endured, but you always keep getting one more shot.\n\nReplace Death, then, with Struggle, and apply it to your own life instead of Bill Cage’s.\n\nYou almost always get one more day (that is, until the day you die). Any project you’ve ever worked on, you can try again if you did not succeed the first time. Any relationship you’ve ever ruined can be mended. Any lesson you haven’t learned can still be learned. There is never a reason to stop trying, because:\n\nCategorical Imperative: would you want everyone else to give up too?\n\nAnd\n\nAmor Fati: what else are you going to do? No one else has your life but you, and no one ever will.\n\nThey differ in scale, but Groundhog Day and Edge of Tomorrow both drive to the same, simple, solid precept of personal ethics: we are not just responsible for ourselves, we are also responsible to each other. For all we know, this is it. The human race might go extinct one day, and maybe after an untold amount of time the universe will simply reignite itself and begin again and we’ll get another go, but what we do is all there is, and so, we have a duty to take care of each other.  \n\n\nTL;DR: Don't be a dick.",

It's not even intersecting monologues, more a series of lightly touching fragmented tangents.   What I'm curious about is whether this is a deliberate tactic to create an  unsettling atmosphere, and give the film a vibe of uncanny depth beneath the surface, or whether it is a simple problem of translating the Russian into English.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn a tangent of my own this feature of mysterious (and perhaps illusory) depth is something that comes up in the Koran.  I read that literally 20% of the lines make no sense at all.  It is full of non-sequiturs, disjointed and obscure sentences and just plain confusion.  For a believer that adds to the sense of mystery and depth.  It is one of the reasons why there is an insistence on knowing the original Arabic and the claim that a translation can't possibly capture it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after watching Solaris and reading a book on Islam in the same night, I might just be drawing a false correlation, but I'm interested in at least for Tarkovsky - is this obfuscation deliberate, or just the translation?

It's rather easy to argue that TV lives in a platonic cave were the bar is so low that pop critics remain impressed when decade-old insights are presented as mind-bending immediacies (*Black Mirror*), techniques are copied with poor understanding (*Mr. Robot*), and any type of intended \"psychological introspection\" is taken for its intention and not its actual application (*Hannibal*). Good series have been made, that's undeniable. Great ones, that's arguable. But what is truest of it all is that there no further culture for series beyond the pop scope. There are no distributors for niche, foreign shows (and I mean publicly too - to my knowledge the German anthology *Heimat* remains enclosed in private trackers). There is no academical interest in studying series. There is not even one forum in the vein of r/truefilm dedicated to series.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI pose all this not towards questioning whether there's something inherent about the way this type of media is produced which highly favors a kind of accessibility that sacrifices compatibility with more rigorous pursuits - rather, I present it as a point in time, as a reference for what we have, versus what could have been. And with *what could have been* I'm referring to how a decent number of respected auteurs have dabbled deep into the televised world of series - off the top of my head: Bergman, Kieślowski, Ruiz, Fassbinder, Rivette, Dumont, Trier, and Lynch all finished at least one project envisioned as a series (which, it must be noted, are all acclaimed as landmark projects in their careers, and remain to date as a big portion of what constitutes the examples for more literate series). But **what are we to take from these**? What were their goals? How radical was this move for the pioneers? Is there an inner culture of series known only to their respective countries, from which they built from, or did they model it over certain extravaganzas in the world of film (ie. was Bergman inspired by a certain Swedish show today without distribution, or by early serial films like *Les Vampires*)? Did they envision a certain (better) future for televised content, or have all these been tangential ventures out of proposed financing?",

Elio confesses in a very very vauge way, and somehow Oliver understands the point he is trying to get across.\n\nAnyone wanna explain why this scene is seen as having \"great writing\", because to me it feels like they're speaking in code.

        "text": "I watched Stalker the other day and wrote the following - not sure where else to post and have intelligent discussion. Thanks for taking the time and providing feedback. Most appreciated. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A discussion on Tarkovsky’s** ***Stalker*** **- and the possible meaning of it’s story.** \n\nTarkovsky’s masterpiece *Stalker* recently screened at a theater in Los Angeles and I was able to stay awake for it’s entirety.\n\nMy first attempted to watch *Stalker* was on my bed with a laptop, and about half an hour in… I woke up for the credits.\n\nBefore you go judging me, watch it and tell me if you don’t yawn a couple of times over the fifteen minute shot when the leads drowsily take naps.\n\nMaybe it was the 64 ounce caffeinated beverage I was sipping, or the socially awkward silences and creaking seats that kept 600 of us holding our breaths so as not to ruin the mood - but the tension was real, and I was riveted to the screen this time, and learned a s\\*\\*tload about awesome filmmaking. \n\nI’ve read a bit of Tarkovsky’s stuff in the past and here is a quote of his:\n\n“I don’t do symbolism, I do story.”\n\nHe never said that exactly - but he meant it, and oh man can he pull it off. \n\nSo first go watch the movie *Stalker*… then ask yourself, “What did I just see?” \n\nAnd don’t fall into the trap of symbolism… Tarkovsky hates direct parallels with anything… he calls it shallow preaching, bad filmmaking and detests it in his or other’s films.\n\nSo if the crippled daughter, the wandering dog, the reoccurring images of syringes don’t directly mean something… then what was their point? Why are they there? Again, what was the point of what we just saw?\n\nWhile all of those objects matter and are intentionally put there by Tarkovsky the direct A equals B symbolism is never as impactful as the subtle emotional story that he weaves. To him symbolism is a shallow attempt at good art. \n\nSo to answer “What was Stalker about?” I pose the following list of questions. \n\nI beg you to answer them yourself. My answers will follow. \n\nDepending on your starting point, your world view, your belief systems - there is a chance our answers will be the same, and a good chance they will differ and both could simultaneously be correct interpretations, another sign of masterful art; it touches you where you are at. \n\nBut don’t be fooled - this doesn’t mean the master artist isn’t trying to say something. \n\nIn this case - things are so intentional, so perfect - you’d be a fool to say Tarkovsky isn’t trying to “equip your soul for good” - another poorly paraphrased saying of his by me.  \n\n(See Questions Below) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQUESTIONS to ASK YOURSELF following a viewing of TARKOVSKY’S *STALKER*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. What is the purpose of the journey our three adventurers go on?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. What does the Room supposedly give you?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. Who goes into the Room during the film?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4. Why don’t the heroes go into the Room?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5. How does the movie start?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6. Again and think hard - does anyone go into the Room?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext there are two speeches at the climax of the movie that must be discussed.\n\n7. The Stalker’s speech. Point of discussion: Why did the Professor and the Writer lack faith?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n8. The Wife of the Stalker’s speech. Point of discussion: What did happiness through sorrow mean to the wife? and was marrying the Stalker the right thing to do?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd finally: \n\n9. What is this movie about in one word?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n10. What are we given (shown) at the very end?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n11. Was your desire fulfilled from going into the Room?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n12. Does this depend on your heart?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(My Answers follow)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy ANSWERS: (Again please watch and answer the above questions before reading below.)\n\n1. What is the purpose of the journey our three adventurers go on?\n\n**To find the Room.**\n\n2. What does the Room supposedly give you?\n\n**Your heart’s true desire.**\n\n3. Who goes into the Room during the film?\n\n**Your initial answer might be no-one… but wait!**\n\n4. Why don’t the heroes go into the Room?\n\n**The Writer doesn’t want to see what his heart’s true desire actually is, he would rather sit in his nice house complaining than to actually look into** **his soul. Remember the warning about the old Stalker who went into the Room to heal his brother but came out rich instead - committing suicide when he realized that he wasn’t as noble as he thought.** \n\n**The Professor was actually there to destroy the room, going into something far beyond what he could explain is something he never wanted.** \n\n**The Stalker doesn’t go in because a ‘stalker’ isn’t supposed to go in. This is the unspoken law of those who can lead others to the room. Ie. The example given above about the stalker that did go in… it ruined him.**\n\n5. How does the movie start?\n\n**Funny question you might say… but very important to see whose perspective the movie belongs too… It’s us - the viewer. We walk slowly into a room through those beautiful antique doors to see the sleeping family.** \n\n6. Now to ask again does anyone go into the Room? (Hint: the Room fulfills one’s true desires.)\n\n**We do. Remember the shot looking back on the three travelers, worn out, the Professor throwing pieces of the bomb? We are in the Room as the audience looking back at them - and the Room will give you your heart’s true desire. Were you granted yours? A trick of the artist here is that the proof of the Room, the faith in it’s reality, is always at question. The heart of most viewers while on the journey to the Room actually want to know if there is a power, a magic. Should we believe it, or is it a sham. We therefore ask the same questions the characters ask throughout.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext there are two speeches at the climax of the movie that must be discussed.\n\n7. The Stalker’s speech. Point of discussion: Why did the Professor and the Writer lack faith?\n\n**They lacked faith because they have become so numb to the world, numb to taking risks, numb to living; so that their muscles of faith have atrophied to the point of non-existence. This is the point of the Stalker’s worn out frustrated speech - that brings the Wife to speak - to us (the audience). She speaks directly to us.** \n\n8. The Wife of the Stalker’s speech. Point of discussion: What did happiness through sorrow mean to the wife? and was marrying the Stalker the right thing to do?\n\n**First off, why is she speaking to us? Because we are the ones on the journey! Suddenly what she says to us becomes key in hearing what the parable of the master Tarkovsky is longing to share.** \n\n**Happiness through sorrow is the point. Marrying the man with faith, joining together with faith doesn’t make the journey perfect - but it makes it worth it.** \n\nAnd finally: \n\n9. What is this movie about in one word?\n\n**I would argue faith. Not an abstract faith, but for purposes of the story - faith in the Room (that it is a true judge of the heart, with the power to grant wishes)**\n\n10. What are we given (shown) at the very end?\n\n**The Cripple daughter moves items through telekinesis. A power beyond. Magic. A Miracle.** \n\n11. Was your desire fulfilled from going into the Room?\n\n**Did you see the magic that speaks of a power beyond? Do you have faith? Were you granted to believe in what this story and I would say Tarkovsky was begging you to believe in… that the Room was real.** \n\n...**and is there a cross over into our actual world?** \n\n**Tarkovsky made film to inspire the soul - to equip the audience to love more.** \n\n**Was he trying to tell us we need faith, faith in miracles, faith in love, faith in God to do this?**  \n\n12. Does this depend on your heart?\n\n**I’ll leave this to you.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/9c8i7qylksl11.jpg\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[What makes a great action scene?](https://thefilmera.com/2018/09/11/indiana-jones-tank-vs-horse/) Why is something like, say, *Man of Steel*’s climactic battle an exercise in tedium when something like the church shootout from John Woo’s *The Killer* lives on as an enduring example of quality filmic action? How can you even compare such drastically different action scenes? After all, is it really fair to say that a superpowered hand to hand fight is the same as a shootout? And the answer to that is: yes, of course it is. Not just because I say so, but because all action scenes are built on the same core foundations. If they satisfy all these conditions, chances are it’s a really good action scene:\n\n1. Are they physically believable?\n2. Do they establish geography?\n3. Do they express character?\n4. Do they escalate tension?\n\nI firmly believe that the best action sequences fulfill all four criteria, everything from the kitchen fight from *The Raid 2* to the bike chase from this year’s *Incredibles 2*. But today I want to talk about one of the clearest examples of quality action filmmaking across all four paradigms: the tank sequence from *Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade*. For nine minutes, Steven Spielberg has the audience in the palm of his hands and provides a perfect celebration, and distillation, of what action cinema can be. Take the time to watch it again; it will go by quicker than you think:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGDSAs\\_uU4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tGDSAs_uU4)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## IS IT PHYSICALLY BELIEVABLE?\n\nPhysical believability is of the utmost importance to an action scene because action is almost purely physical. If the audience can’t believe in the action in front of them, it loses its defining characteristic. The infamous “burly brawl” scene from *The Matrix Reloaded* is notorious for its heavy usage of digital doubles, diminishing any and all burliness from its brawl by replacing its physical actors with weightless CG dummies. There’s no investment in an action if you don’t believe someone can get hurt, and digital doubles are one of the easiest ways to ruin a fight scene (an issue I have with just about every Marvel movie). That’s not to say you can’t use CGI in a fight scene, but a live action movie removes all danger when an obvious digital double that doesn’t obey the same laws of physics as the character they’re substituting is put in harm’s way. Even animated movies are not exempt from making physically consistent, satisfying, and impactful action.\n\nThat sure looks like a bunch of real human beings slugging it out on top of moving vehicles. Though obviously filled with its own movie-making trickery, there’s a dedication to real stunt work and impressive choreography throughout the sequence. Rather than a confused melee of performers all doing their own thing, each movement is perfectly timed with the camera and all the other moving pieces. \n\nEvery action has a satisfying reaction, whether it’s the tank shells exploding throughout the fight and sending up great plumes of debris, fisticuffs that send the characters flying with every satisfyingly chunky stock sound effect, or the Luger that blows a hole clean through a line of Nazis. All of this visceral action is largely captured within one frame as well, adding to both the danger and physicality of each impact as the actions, combatants, and reactions are all visibly sharing the same space and connecting with one another.\n\n## DOES IT ESTABLISH GEOGRAPHY?\n\nGeography is crucial for an action scene to work, particularly in chase sequences and shootouts where there is distance between the various players and their spatial relativity. It is critical for the tension of the scene to be felt. A big reason people tend to complain about tightly shot “shaky-cam” and rapid editing in action sequences is not just that it obscures the physicality of the action, but because it simply makes it difficult to understand where it’s taking place in space. We’ve already established that Spielberg makes careful use of the wide shot to frequently show the audience all the players in the scene, but because this action sequence juggles so many characters it’s a bit more complicated than that. Not only does the action occur between Indy on horseback and the tank, but between his father Henry Sr. and friend Marcus Brody, and the Nazis inside the tank. Spielberg’s choice of shots to illustrate the geography of the inner workings of the metallic behemoth are quite clever. The first shot of the inside of the tank is from outside the front window looking in, which serves to establish the cardinality of the positions of those inside, and their relation to the exterior that we spend most of our time watching. Shortly after, in two fluid camera moves, the camera tracks an ejected shell from the gunners position and then pans over to the cowering Henry and Marcus. By showing this in one unbroken shot rather than simply cutting to them, the viewers can easily judge where these critical players are while further reinforcing the drama of the destructive capability of the tank.\n\nPoint of view shots are also employed throughout the scene as a clever way of both crafting suspense (such as when Indy is locked within the sights of the gun), and of placing the viewer within to character’s sight lines so they can further judge the consequences of the geography of the scene. A POV shot is used at a critical moment in the scene to illustrate the imminence of the tank rolling off of the edge of the cliff. Then,  after the criticality of the situation is imparted with the POV shot, Spielberg uses repeated cuts back to a wide omniscient shot in order to show the viewer an accurate measure of exactly how much time is left on this most climactic ticking clock.\n\nIf the action itself is the brushstrokes then the geography of the scene is its canvas, and with this sequence Spielberg makes sure to use a very large canvas indeed. If he hadn’t, the scene wouldn’t work at all, as the audience would never know when to feel tense due to an oncoming cliff, or the rotating of the tank’s guns.\n\n## DOES IT EXPRESS CHARACTER?\n\nSome folks like to delineate between action and drama, as if any time characters stop talking and start punching then their development is put on hold. And for poor action movies that’s absolutely the case. Any time you find yourself bored during an otherwise technically proficient action scene, it might be because it’s failing to express character, and as a result feels detached from the narrative of the film. I loved *Blade Runner 2049* for example, but occasionally the action beats felt like they were there simply because they were expected for a genre film to have them, and not because they served the story. *Mad Max: Fury Road*, on the other hand, is almost entirely action, so to develop its characters and narrative it had to find a way to express character through action.\n\nHow does a character move? What are their eyes telling us? How are they reacting and coordinating with the other characters? How do they throw a punch? How do they take one? All of these things tell the audience crucial information about who a character is and what’s going on with them at that point in the story without having to use dialogue at all. That’s what made silent film performers like Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd such compelling characters; because their physical performance conveyed the entire story when the medium couldn’t rely on spoken words to do it for them; it was pure visual storytelling. Action filmmaking is the descendant of silent film in its visual expression, and Harrison Ford’s performance as Indiana Jones in this scene can be traced right back to those performers with their charismatic blend of death defying stunts and exaggerated physical humor.\n\nPlay the scene again and watch it without sound this time. Pay attention to the characters and how they navigate the scene and what that tells about them. Indy is capable and self-assured in how he throws himself into brazen and death-defying stunts, but his face frequently tells a different story, often expressing surprise or amusement that what he’s doing is somehow working. Marcus Brody is broadly depicted as the physically ineffectual intellectual in the scene and his biggest physical task is to struggle with an unconscious soldier on top of him. Every single major character of the scene, and even some of the minor goons (look at the shit-eating grin of the smug periscope operator), have developed personalities through how they act and are incorporated in the scene. Someone who is entirely unfamiliar with Indiana Jones could watch this sequence in isolation and immediately understand who these people are solely based on their actions.\n\n## DOES IT ESCALATE TENSION?\n\nAnother failing of many an action film is that they mistakenly think that the more intense the action is, the more intense the scene itself will be. As a result, this blunt and inarticulate approach frequently leads to a numbing effect where the viewers’ eyes glaze over when a sequence devolves into a redundant series of blows. *Man of Steel* is a perfect example of this; there are only so many skyscrapers a character can be tossed through before it loses its impact. At a certain point, we’ve seen enough of what the scene has to offer. Action, like a piece of music, needs to be paced properly with ebbs and flows and a steady progression in the stakes of the scene before it results in a cathartic climax.\n\nNotice how the sequence from *The Last Crusade* is not just nine minutes of Indy on horseback playing tag with the tank until it rolls off a cliff. That would be dull and unnecessary. Instead, count how many dramatic mini-climaxes and tension relievers there are, and see how it alters the dynamic of the action after every tension release only to have the next mini-climax be even more fraught than the one before it.\n\n1. Indy and his horse are close to being blown away by the tank. The tension is released after he destroys the tanks gun by jamming it with a rock.\n2. The tension is escalated when Indy has to contend with a whole squad of Nazis on the back of the tank. The tension is released when he shoots through them with the Luger.\n3. The tension is escalated when Vogel, the SS Colonel and commander of the tank, starts choking Indy with a chain. The tension is released when his father uses the tank to blow up a truck of reinforcements, and the shockwaves allows him to escape…\n4. … Only to escalate the tension further by having him dangle from the barrel of the tank.\n\nThe tension and release only gets more perilous as the emotional stakes are upped when Indy must save his father while he’s being attacked and there are many minor tension increases within each of those mini-climaxes.\n\nThe end result is an incredibly dynamic action scene that never fails to generate suspense and never disengages the viewer by constantly providing cathartic tension releases throughout and shifting the action into ever more precarious situations. The scene saves the best for last, giving its villain the protracted death by fall that he deserves, and extending the tension of Indy’s fate until the last possible moment.\n\nBy carefully measuring and ramping up the action, the emotional catharsis can be its greatest, because the sequence has invested you on a narrative level — just as well as any “drama” could. And that’s because action, like all good cinema, *is* drama; and drama (as someone who went to film school and made his fair share of bad dramas) is really hard to do successfully. It’s an involved process that requires balancing every facet of production, narrative, and audience expectation, and you can count yourself lucky if what you end up with is even just okay. The fact that the tank sequence from *The Last Crusade* is not just okay, but actually perfect, is just shy of a miracle. The next time you find yourself gripping your armrest through an action scene, do yourself a favor and  play it through again; watch closely and ask yourself: [“What makes this a good action scene?”](https://thefilmera.com/2018/09/11/indiana-jones-tank-vs-horse/)\n\nBy Graham Austin\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

        "text": "It's fun to write his name out that way.\n\nI guess I'll put it this way:\n\nIf it was his college thesis film at 21 or something... I'd be quite impressed with the result. However, he was 31 when he made it and had a feature film under his belt as well as a pretty decent budget for an indie film shot in random apartment buildings. It doesn't have me terribly excited for the rest of his filmography and I just checked out 8 of his films from the library.\n\nThere was very little about the film that was exceptional on a technical level and it wallowed in banality. Maybe the point was to wallow in banality? It didn't do that in an interesting way though. Wallowing in banality can produce really interesting things if done deliberately and I love films that do it gracefully. It did at times, the scene where he struggled to tell a simple joke was pretty neat.\n\nThe acting was so limited as well, it's not hard to find indie film actors who can bring more to a role and I felt it had potential overall. Would have loved to see this premise with better elements. I mean I think as well the interesting qualities of the actors weren't used quite well enough, I kept remarking at the lost potential of each interaction.\n\nIt seems like why it was and is so well received is that it was a breath of fresh air -especially in the mid 80s- and it's pretty well made. It seems easy to relate to as well. It's homey and quaint and easy going.\n\nMaybe I'm just feeling the sting of something not living up to expectations and watching it again in a more casual way could help. I don't know if I'd be interested in watching it again. I've felt this way about a bunch of films -most notably *Kairo*(Pulse)- and haven't re watched any of them.\n\nWas it trite? Was it designed to be trite? It seems maybe. Did it succeed? It might me have overthinking things as I tend to do.\n\nAnyways it's 3am and I should go to bed and feel weirdly numbed by the film.",

How can we claim a movie is good today for points that were disliked initially? Numerous examples come to mind, but I remember films like Psycho, The Thing, Alien, Blade Runner, Apocalypse Now, Fantasia, The Shining, Fight Club, etc. Yet, these films are considered classics today.\n\nOthers that were disliked but have been at least well received nowadays is Hellraiser and Candyman. But my question, while complicated and probably not well put together, is how can art be quantified and considered bad only to be later well received. Does that mean movies are always subjective and are never really \"bad\", and that \"bad\" and \"good\" is only something the majority agree with for the most part?\n\nSome movies that I observe were badly received initially but have been receiving some current praise or cult status have been Alien³, Alien Resurrection, Event Horizon, the Star Wars Prequels, Thor, Ang Lee's Hulk, the Matrix sequels, the Hobbit trilogy, among some others. Why is that? And why others don't continue receiving this praise?",

Here aré some of my favorites.\n1-Jean Vigo: tragically died at the age of 29, leaving us with a handful of masterworks like Zero for Conduct anda L'Atalante. \n2-Michael Cimino: quickly became one of Hollywood's preeminent directors thanks to Thunderbolt anda Lightfoot and The Deber Hunter, but lost everything after the massive failure of Heaven's Gate. Afterwards Cimino attempted to make a great number of very interesting projects, none of which got off the ground, instead making a series of lackluster features clearly made mainly for the money.\n3-George Lucas: this is probably going to seem a pretty unusual choice, but hear me out. When Lucas first started out he was a smart, ambitious young director who rejected studio offers to instead focus on passion projects like THX 1138, American Graffiti and Star Wars. But after the enormous success of the later film, Lucas decided that it was easier to be a studio mogul than an artist and so his talent dwindled away as he started to focus more and more in selling toys than making original movies, only returning to the directing chair for the underwhelming Star Wars prequels, which is a shame because with his talent and his resources he could have easily became an equal to his peers Steven Spielberg and Francis Ford Coppola.\n4-Charles Laughton: debuted with his masterpiece The Night of the Hunter, but abandoned any further directing projects after it's poor reception. At least he left us with an fantastic acting career. ",

        "text": "In the film \"Whiplash,\" director Damien Chazelle takes us on Andrews journey to greatness. From his rise to fall, and to his ultimate recovery, Chazelle crafts a story of triumph for a character that isn't likeable in the slightest. Andrew's only redeeming quality is his motivation which, at some point, disappears. This quality is only redeemable if you can respect it, and the same goes for Fletcher—a character who also isn't likeable. However, for most of the film, you wouldn't think that these two characters are similar at all, yet they are. They both care about one thing; greatness. We could go on about the dichotomy of these two characters for a while, but I want to talk about something I noticed in the film's climax. \n\nThroughout the entire film you hear Andrew, and the band, practice two songs. Mainly the song Caravan, with the other song being Whiplash. However, what you don't hear are the songs in their entirety. They are always pieces, usually the main riffs. If not that, you hear Andrew and the other drummers, practice their tempo. It isn't until the final ten minutes of the film that you get to hear one of the songs in their entirety. Oddly enough, the song that Andrew forces the band to play once he returns to the stage after being embarrassed by Fletcher, is Caravan. Not Whiplash. The film finishes by finally revealing the song it's been building since the beginning, and the film ends on the final snare hit of the song. Concluding the song at the same time as the film.\n\nNow, I find that interesting. Mainly because this final reveal of the song is also when the final pieces of each character are revealed. Mainly in Andrew and Fletcher, but also in Andrew's father. \n\nLet's start with the father. I believe the shot where Andrew is looking out the door to see the crowd walking in when he spots his father, isn't just to show us that his father showed up. I believe this shot is meant to show us his father's body language. He's slumped, tense, there isn't a smile on his face. He doesn't seem excited for Andrew, he seems disappointed. Why? Well, he's probably disappointed that after all Andrew went through, he's back working with the guy who caused him so much stress and emotional pain. I think this makes sense because Andrew's reaction to seeing his father changes from happiness to being unsure. But that's not going to stop Andrew, he's about to play the JVC, that's what his mind is set on. Back to the father; when Andrew is \"laughed\" off stage, his father runs to his aid and comforts him. However, right away Andrew turns back to the stage. Again, his father is worried, disappointed, what have you. You don't see his father until the last few minutes when Andrew is playing his heart out. You see him peering into the auditorium with a look of worry, but as he sees and hears Andrew playing his heart out, his worry turns to awe because now he understands what Andrew has been trying to do with Jazz. Throughout the film, you can tell that his father is supportive but he doesn't quite understand what Andrew is doing, this changes at that moment. I also find him peering into the auditorium interesting. He had enough time to make his way back to his seat, but instead he stood outside of the auditorium. I think he was scared of going back in there, scared of what might happen to his son. So he watches from behind a door. What do you think of that moment? \n\nThat's all I have for the father. Let's move on to Andrew and Fletcher. Before the JVC event, Andrew runs into Fletcher after watching him play in a jazz bar. Then, Fletcher has a monologue of sorts about Charlie Parker and he talks about the cymbal being thrown, and he completes that story by saying Charlie trained and came back better than ever, giving the performance of a lifetime. This is him laying out what's about to transpire in the final scene, at least, to some extent. It doesn't happen exactly like he says but this is how it goes. Fletcher convinces Andrew to play at the JVC, Andrew says sure and is excited. On the day of, Andrew is blind-sighted on stage when Fletcher calls for an unknown song to be played, a song which Andrew doesn't have the sheets for and isn't prepared to play. Andrew tries to play along with the song, but clearly, his drumming doesn't fit the part. Fletcher lets it slide because he wants Andrew to fail, he wants to get back at him. Then Andrew leaves the stage, embarrassed by Fletcher and now will never be a professional jazz drummer. However, after being comforted by his father, something changes in Andrew and he goes back to the stage. And, instead of letting Fletcher react to this, Andrew begins to play Caravan and he cues the bassist. Then, to not let himself get embarrassed, Fletcher cues the rest of the band and so he roles with it. Throughout the performance, Andrew doesn't let Fletcher react or say anything to him. \n\nThis is when things change. We've already seen Andrew change by going back on stage and sticking up to the man, but Andrew is actively controlling the band. He is leading the performance with his drumming. His drumming is so impressive that Fletcher realizes what is going on and his expression goes from \"Fuck you Neeman,\" to awe, like Andrew's father. This kid is finally standing up to him and proving to him that he is great. Fletcher then helps Andrew finish his performance of a lifetime by guiding him and the band to a perfect finish. At this point, Fletcher isn't coaching or conducting, he's working in tandem with Andrew because he is witnessing greatness. I noted this change after the song dies down and Andrew keeps playing, Fletcher goes up to Andrew and instead of saying \"Neeman, what are you doing?\" In a negative tone, he says \"Andrew, what are you doing man?\" In a positive, and endearing way, as though he is genuinely curious as to why Andrew is still playing. His performance was great, he didn't need to keep going. But he does. \n\nAndrew doing this shows to us that he is now incredibly confident in his abilities. Not by pre-determined thought, but by a decision he made in that instance. He made the choice to not give up. To not let someone else dictate whether he would be great or not. What's even crazier is that Fletcher notices this. And then the characters who, throughout the film, went from Fletcher holding power over Andrew to Andrew holding power over Fletcher, and then back and then forth. Until finally, both characters wind up on the same plane as the two work together to finish an incredible performance. In the end, Andrew still has respect for Fletcher and Fletcher himself gains respect for Andrew.\n\nI love this film, it is one of my favourites and often it sits atop my Top 10. I'd love to know what you think of my analysis? Also, any constructive feedback is welcome. \n\nHere's the ending from when Andrew returns to the stage: \n\nPart 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZY-Ytrw2co\n\nPart 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TAfvMn8_EQ\n\nHere's when he gets \"laughed\" off stage: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9itwiyTeNM\n",

        "text": "https://youtu.be/lrXMvci4-3s\n\nClink the link to watch the episode of REEL ACTORS: Tom Hardy with Becki Morgan &amp; myself.\n\n\nSeptember 30th, 1955 actor James Dean was pronounced dead on arrival at Paso Robles War Memorial Hospital at 6:20 PM. The 24 year old suffered numerous fatal injuries including a broken beck sustained while crashing his Porsche 550 Spyder, affectionately nicknamed \"little bastard\". \n\nDean would miss the release of his third film The Giant (1956) starring Elizabeth Taylor &amp; Rock Hudson. The film would garner James Dean a post mortem Academy Award nomination, the second of the young performers career. The films marquee lead, Hudson was reportedly quite annoyed with the attention Deans performance garnered. The Giant is mostly remembered as a \"James Dean film\" dispite the younger, less experianced man, who had a quarter of screen time comparied to his icon counterpart.\n\nOnly starring in East of Eden &amp; Rebel Without A Cause to go along with his supporting role in The Giant, no one could deny Dean's gravitational pull on screen. Few (if any) performers have had that kind of staying power after 65 years since their final role. Actors like James Dean are not only rare, they are nearly extinct.\n\nOther names include Audrey Hepburn, Marilyn Monroe, &amp; Carey Grant. The two former, like Dean had a certain heir of mystique surronding them, especially was the case for Monroe. In the golden age of cinema the movie goer would attend the theatre for the name in the lights. Not to say the films production itself weren't masterpieces in there own right. But you would take your squeeze to go see the latest Clark Gable flick, and left seeing Gone With the Wind.\n\nIn this day and age the franchise name is infinitely more important than any cast member. Sure you want to see Chris Pratt &amp; Bradley Cooper exchange witty banter in the latest Marvel conglomerate. But your not reeeeeealy making the treacherous trek to sit next to loud popcorn intake and screeming children just for RDJ, are you? It's about the sploshins &amp; light sword fights. MERCHINDISE! The safety net of delivered expectations.\n\n\n-The Last Action Heros-\n\nAction films of the 80's &amp; 90's did promote the leading woman/man mantra. Stallone, Arnold, Willis, Cruise, &amp; and even more current examples of The Rock &amp; Statham. These films still featured a \"front man\" to provide a POV through the shenanigans and violence. But alas even this style has been transforming into a more ensemble format aswell. Nothing is safe from The Nothing. After veiwing the entire line-up of The Expendables, due to morbid masochistic curiosity, it became evident that even this sub-genre was devolving. \n\nSo what caused this shift in film? Where have all the cowboys gone? Where is OUR James Dean? \n\nThe answer: right here in front of us. You just need to know where to look. For example, I was guilty of taking certain artists for granted. Sam Rockwell is one of the most underappreciated actors working today. Half of you will nod at that statement. 10% will ask who Sam Rockwell is. That's not a knock! Besides the undervalued comedic role in the very unpopular Iron Man 2 as Justin Hammer. He has chosen to be the best fish in the coolest ponds. Not every actor can afford to be as picky as Rockwell. Or choose to be. \n\nBut in my most humblest pretentious opinion the closest thing to what we have been lacking in close to a cool century in cinema is England's very own Tom Hardy. Before viewing most of his films in preperation for the podcast. I wrote Hardy off as a brute and puncher of faces only. \n\n*EAR MUFFS*\nHoly. Fuck. Was. I. Wrong.\n\nHardy's transformative abilities whether that be said for different dialects or period piece roles are nothing short of brilliance. Sure if you need someone beat up you can do worse casting wise. But Mr.Hardy can be counted on to elevate his craft if the material calls for it. Not many can completely disappear and mutate into roles save a handfull currently in the industry. This man creates a charismatic vacuum whether playing two identical twins that couldn't be further apart in likeness and mannerism. Or portraying the most famous criminal in UK history.\n\nIf you have ever thought this man didn't have chops, then I implore you to watch the very brisk 86 minute Locke. Seriously it's on Netflix now. Or please indulge on his Nicholas Wynding Refn offering Bronson. This film is a true work of art and is also streaming on Hulu. Few actors, if any could not pull off an entire film of a man driving on the freeway and taking business calls regarding concrete, and make it riveting. \n\nIs Hardy perfect in every role...close, but no. However he is the closest thing we've had to a leading man in film this engrossing since the \"little bastard\" was taken for its final ride.\n\nMy name is Jon. \n\nPlease tip your waitress.\n\n \n\n\n",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ Gala premiere of Denis’s  High Life](https://i.redd.it/pf1qspaswhl11.jpg)\n\n[During the festival’s opening weekend](https://thefilmera.com/2018/09/10/tiff-dispatch-3/), TIFF throws a block party on King Street, outside its headquarters at the Lightbox Theatre. Festival Street, as it’s dubbed, is a four day celebration of film, closing part of King Street to vehicle access and opening the space up for foot traffic and easy access to the biggest venues. The Princess of Wales Theatre and Roy Thomson Hall, where the Gala Presentations are held, are both on King Street and form the party’s beating heart.\n\nWalking west from University Avenue, past the huge TIFF sign, you’ll find all sorts of food trucks and kiosks from major festival sponsors, from pop-up French cafés to automobile showcases. King Street’s recent revitalizations have transformed the space into a more pedestrian friendly neighbourhood, with various artistic installations and spaces to rest and relax. Festival Street has taken advantage of this and feels cozier than ever, with people lounging around or beating the heat with a cold drink on one of the many restaurant patios that have that sprawled out onto the street.\n\nThe big event this year was the Share Her Journey rally, to promote the recent initiative undertaken by the TIFF Group. Share Her Journey is “[**a five-year commitment to increasing participation, skills, and opportunities for women behind and in front of the camera**](https://www.tiff.net/shareherjourney/).” The rally, held on Festival Street on Saturday, September 8th, saw hundreds of people (and thousands more online) show up to support women in filmmaking and hear from a variety of speakers. Filmmakers Nandita Das and Amma Assante, and actors such as Geena Davis, Amanda Brugel and Mia Kirshner—also the co-founder of #AfterMeToo—were in attendance and spoke to the audience. The speakers discussed strategies for improvement and reform, but inspirational messages were tempered by the reality of the industry’s slow pace of progress—or in some cases, seeming unwillingness to change.\n\nThis was underscored most directly and shockingly by the sudden controversy at the festival surrounding Shane Black’s *The Predator*. While speakers at the Share Her Journey rally were calling for men to stand up and do their part, to support and validate the women they work with, Olivia Munn was being abandoned by her male co-stars. I had only just heard about the film’s deleted scene—Fox removed a scene featuring Munn and Steven Wilder Striegel, a registered sex offender, at the eleventh hour—when I was walking to the theatre for the film’s premiere, but didn’t think much of it at the time. Okay, so they cut him out, and that’s that, right? Well, it was Munn who discovered the fact and was uncomfortable with how everything was being handled, and it was Munn who spoke up and was suddenly finding herself alone at scheduled press interviews here in Toronto. One of her male co-stars apparently walked out of an interview, and for [**The Hollywood Reporter**](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oliva-munn-predator-casting-controversy-toronto-film-festival-1141255), Munn showed up entirely alone, nearly fighting back tears to explain why nobody else was there.\n\nThe core message of the Share Her Journey movement is to lift women up, and that’s work that requires everyone, at every level, and even the smallest of gestures. Credit where credit is due for the TIFF Group, because they’ve been supporting women long before the announcement of their new five-year strategy. TIFF has been seeking out and promoting female voices in cinema for years, pushing the number of female-directed films in their programming up and up, to 35% this year. There’s plenty more work to do, but that’s already more representation than any other film festival in the world. As a regular attendee, I’ve tried to follow the call, seeking out films directed by women at every opportunity. It’s what led me to *Rafiki* on opening night here at TIFF and to other great films in the past, like *Zama* and *The Rider*, which I saw at TIFF last year. And it’s what led me now to ***The Crossing***, the debut feature from Chinese filmmaker Bai Xue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[  The Crossing, the debut feature from Chinese filmmaker Bai Xue. ](https://i.redd.it/b0l4ffy0xhl11.jpg)\n\n*The Crossing* is the opening film for the Discovery program, TIFF’s selection of debut and sophomore features from new filmmakers across the globe. It stars Huang Yao as Peipei, a young girl who crosses the border between China and Hong Kong every day, caught between two worlds. Peipei lives with her mother in China and goes to school and visits her father in Hong Kong. While skipping school one day to go party with friends, she suddenly and randomly winds up involved in smuggling. Not only does she revel in the thrill, she proves surprisingly adept.\n\n*The Crossing* succeeds on the strength of Huang Yo’s performance and the unique insight it provides into the world of smuggling operations between China and Hong Kong, but I was hoping for a lot more. Keeping the focus on Peipei and the events she experiences is a fine dramatic strategy, but this also allows it to tiptoe around more contentious political issues. There’s a lot more that could have been done with this story, and while Bai Xue directs her actors well, she stumbles a bit developing narrative threads, and a surprising mid-credit scene is just another clumsy stab at symbolism to add to the first ending. The film reminded me of Flora Lau’s *Bends*, which I saw at TIFF in 2013. It was also a feature debut, and also explores these borders (albeit not smuggling), the only other film I can think of that does, but Lau’s film is more politically charged, more stylistically ambitious, and ultimately more memorable. (I’m still waiting for Lau to make another film.)\n\nThere’s one woman in particular that TIFF is celebrating this year, and that’s acclaimed [French auteur Claire Denis](https://twitter.com/film_era/status/1039014729400942592). One of the greatest film artists of our time (I will fight you to the death if you disagree), Denis has just been announced as the recipient of this year’s Roger Ebert Golden Thumb Award. As part of the Festival Street activities, TIFF is also hosting some free outdoor screenings, and among them is Denis’s first film, ***Chocolat***, which is celebrating its 30th anniversary. The TIFF Cinematheque owns a 35mm print of the film, which I have been fortunate enough to see screened before. It’s a revelation of a film, powerful and fully-formed in the way debuts typically aren’t, beautiful and rich in symbolism. It helped put Isaach De Bankolé on the map, and for good reason.\n\nBut the main event is the red carpet Gala premiere of Denis’s newest film, ***High Life***. Denis is no stranger to genre; her 2001 horror film, *Trouble Every Day*, has been screened repeatedly as part of TIFF’s year-round programming, and it’s always worth catching again and again. I derive a sort of sick pleasure in witnessing new audiences experience the profoundly disturbing journey of that film for the first time. *High Life* is still a first, however, as Denis has never tackled a science-fiction film before. And in doing so, she has crafted one of the most fearsome, ferocious, muscular and uncompromising works of her career.\n\n*High Life* is clumsy at times, stilted and bewildering at others, owing in part perhaps to it being her first English-language production. But as it builds, it overwhelms, and exposition finally gives way to one of the most fractured, baffling and astonishing movie experiences of the year. I’ve already heard people calling it divisive. Throwing Denis at the Gala audience was certainly a bold move; let’s just say, a lot of people didn’t stick around. Denis’s cinema, in the words of TIFF co-head Cameron Bailey, who introduced the film last night, is free. It never conforms to expectations. It’s singular and unapologetic, and it doesn’t give a fuck. Denis, speaking of one of the production partners on the film, claimed the man hated her. But, she added, who cares? That’s the kind of attitude that casts heartthrob Robert Pattinson in a science-fiction film, and then turns in a finished product that makes *Trouble Every Day* look quaint, and causes the most audience walkouts I’ve seen during TIFF since Albert Serra’s *Birdsong* in 2008. Coincidentally, both great films!\n\nI couldn’t possibly unpack the film after a single viewing, but I’m going to write something, because this madness is nothing if not inspiring. Look for my full review of *High Life* later in the week. Check back all week for more festival dispatches—and go read [**Dispatch #1**](https://thefilmera.com/2018/09/08/tiff-2018-dispatch-1/) and [**Dispatch #2**](https://thefilmera.com/2018/09/09/tiff-2018-dispatch-2/) for my perspectives. Opening weekend will fast become a distant memory, but there’s still a full week of films rushing up to meet us, and I’ve still got a world premiere from another of my favorites, Mia Hansen-Løve, coming up.\n\n*The 43rd Toronto International Film Festival runs from September 6th to 16th, 2018. visit us for more coverage and classic film reviews at*[FilmEra](https://thefilmera.com/) and once again thank you Truefilm for being a great community!",

        "text": "Deep Breath. Okay here goes.\n\nIt very well could be an unabashedly quirky camp/satire/art piece/slice of life masterpiece with some of the best set/art/costume design we've ever seen from a low budget film full of incredibly original and ingeniously crafted characters written to perfection for what it intends to be and virtually noone recognizes it because it instantly became a meme and the tone is so low key and silly.\n\nAesthetically it's perfection. How many films can say that?\n\nThe entire production was incredibly meticulous. Every last detail contributes something to the film.\n\nThe performances are all totally on point. Those characters aren't easy to portray either.\n\nThe casting was totally magic. Everything came together perfectly.\n\nThe use of music is generally quite good and really strong at times. Fantastic original music.\n\nThe writing produced so many memorable gags and memes. That might not sound impressive but it is exactly that.\n\nThey simultaneously capture what it's like to be in high school in a  beautifully tender and sincere way while creating a somewhat surreal state where the you never know what exactly to expect. It feels like it exists in it's own bizarre universe while simultaneously being a mirror pointed at mainstream late 20th century America.\n\nNo Masterpiece is perfect but they're always overflowing with excellence. The worst elements are generally quite strong.\n\nThe budget was 400,000 all told so not tiny but still quite limited. It was also the debut film of the Jared and Jerusha Hess.\n\nThere was really no direct precedent for this type of film. Maybe a few to provide inspiration but it was an original work on all levels.\n\nAnyhow. There's my case. I look forward to discussing this further.\n\nMasterpieces come in many shapes and sizes.\n\nThanks.",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Perfect Blue 20th Anniversary is playing in theaters now!](https://i.redd.it/4se81thmdcl11.jpg)\n\n[https://thefilmera.com/2018/09/09/perfect-blue/](https://thefilmera.com/2018/09/09/perfect-blue/) for all the images and score\n\n[Perfect Blue](https://thefilmera.com/2018/09/09/perfect-blue/) is a film known by everyone but me; this 20th anniversary showing is the first time I have ever watched it. For those who are familiar with the film, you are probably smiling reading that, and for those who aren’t there is nothing you can do to prepare yourself for Satoshi Kon’s directorial  debut. [**Fathom Events**](https://www.fathomevents.com/events/perfect-blue) decided to air this remastered 20th Anniversary edition of [***Perfect Blue***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jkMh5Wply4) across the nation for a select few days this week, so I immediately jumped at the opportunity to see this on the big screen. How could I not when all my film friends raved about it, even going to such lengths as to call it a masterpiece?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNothing can prepare you for your first time watching this film, and I mean it. One week ago I watched the newly released [***Searching*** ](https://thefilmera.com/2018/09/01/searching/) and thought it couldn’t be topped when it came to thrillers, but then *Perfect Blue* comes along. *Perfect Blue* is a psychological thriller set in the 1990s of Japan; we follow a pop star who decides to quit singing and pursue a career in acting. Not everyone is happy about her choice, and as she delves deeper into the world of acting she starts to have psychological episodes. As the film progresses, reality and illusions start to blur until we have no idea what is real and what is false. Kon leaves clues in the films, but you are best not relying on them because those clues could be red herrings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven though it is a thriller, Kon laces the film with social commentary and foreshadowing towards the future of Japan.  Kon uses central character and star of the film Mima Kirigoe as an example of how celebrities are just like us. The problems that arise for Mima come from living up to expectations of everyone around her, and not being taken seriously due to her age and her previous role as a pop idol. This is where Kon’s commentary comes in; *Perfect Blue* is a work of fiction, but the material and themes it represents were not only real in the 90s but are still a mainline problem today. Mental illness, high expectations, and misconceived realities come with the territory of fame, but no one ever addresses it until someone famous dies from the pressure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is a scene that stuck with me involving Mima’s first time use of a computer. She discovers a fan site and becomes amused by it until it starts to go too far, painting her into an image that isn’t real. The scene hits hard because not only does it foreshadow the rise of the internet and its impact, but also how one person can create something to ruin someone’s image.\n\nThe film is accompanied by a [**musical soundtrack** ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q606Eg6ZcZ8)and top-notch voice acting that only makes me think of other animated masterpieces such as *Akira* and *Ghost in the Shell*. Ninety minutes is all *Perfect Blue* needs to pull the audience into a twisted nightmare that doesn’t let up till the last five minutes. When you wake up, you are forced to ask yourself, “What did all that mean?”\n\nSatoshi Kon was a talented director who created a masterpiece with his directorial debut. It takes considerable care and talent to create a film whose central themes remain relevant twenty years after its creation. I look forward to watching the rest of this late director’s work.\n\nEdit: my review of [Night Is Short, Walk On Girl](https://thefilmera.com/2018/08/26/night-is-short-walk-on-girl/) since everyone in comments is looking for 2018 recommendations.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/9ee2wy/night_of_the_hunter_the_most_ahead_of_its_time/",
        "text": "There are very few films that I can honestly say, I have never seen anything like it. The Night of the Hunter is the best movie of this category in my opinion. It has a completely unique style that may have been influenced by German Expressionism and may have in turn influenced many films but none can capture the feeling of this movie. It has a quality that is completely timeless, so that even though some aspects of the story and acting can seem a bit dated, the film overall works perfectly today and I think it will forever.\n\nFirst of all, the most acclaimed aspect of the film is its cinematography and lighting. In my opinion this is probably the most beautiful black and white film ever made. I think that Citizen Kane is widely considered to be a breakthrough film in terms of cinematography and I would argue that Night of The Hunter may have been the next big step in filmmaking. People often point out some of the iconic shots (the corpse at the bottom of the river, the murder, the barn, the riverboat) but to me, nearly every shot of the film is special in some way. But more importantly the images capture a magical feeling that is very powerful. The movie is supposed to be told through the perspective of the children and the visuals capture this perfectly. The movie looks like a combination of a cartoon and illustrations from a storybook. It is constantly on the border of reality and fantasy, just like the way that young children would see the world. The lighter aspects of the film appear more beautiful and the darker aspects more threatening than any adult would view them, almost like a nightmarish Disney movie.   Overall, when I think of the term \"movie magic\" Night of The Hunter is one of the first films that come to mind.\n\nIn addition to the actual filmmaking, the story also appears to be way ahead of its time. I was really surprised that a movie from 1955 featuring children as the main characters would be so dark and disturbing. I was even more shocked that a film from this era would portray a \"man of god\" in such a way. Robert Mitchum plays Reverend Harry Powell as pure evil and insanity, a man who threatens children with a knife and goes around killing widows under the guise of Christianity. The character really shows the mayhem that a preacher can commit using a false veneer of respectability. Some might argue that the character is a bit over-the-top but again consider that the movie is told through the perspective of children and Powell feels almost like a cartoon villain, only more disturbing than any cartoon would have.\n\nA preacher (especially in the 1930s) is one of the most respected public figures of society and many people are prone to believe whatever he says. Therefore, Powell is able to do heinous things and convince himself and others that it is right, by using the violence of the old testament to justify his actions. In fact, Powell often convinces other characters that they are the sinners to manipulate them and this works almost every time. Through much of the movie the only one who can see the true nature of this man is the child John. The movie does an amazing job of portraying one of its biggest themes: how hard life can be for children, which of course is still as meaningful an idea today as it was during the great depression. These children are at the mercy of a monster and no one helps or believes them for most of the movie. Another major theme of the film is the never ending battle of good and evil. It may seem like the film condemns religion through its antagonist but the character of Ms. Cooper is a great opposition that also uses religious beliefs but for good. I think it is really interesting that the movie matches this powerful, respected, and larger than life preacher character with this average, little old woman who looks after children and is not afraid of him. It is a powerful statement on the nature of good and evil, that we often look to the wrong people for maintaining faith in humanity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

The festival front-loads its first weekend with world premieres it has wrestled away from other fall fests (this year, new films from Claire Denis and Barry Jenkins are a big deal, but you won’t be seeing Yorgos Lanthimos or Luca Guadagnino in Toronto). For its opening night film, Toronto has tried a number of different things over the years, from promoting homegrown Canadian productions to documentaries tackling import social issues, and—lately—star-studded Hollywood affairs. Generally, these films are forgettable, and I make a point of never going to see them. This year, all the buzz is about *Outlaw King* and Chris Pine(’s penis). That’s probably the most enticing opening night TIFF has offered in a while, but I still decided to pass.\n\nOn opening night, I always make a point of finding something smaller, off the beaten path (i.e. red carpet). TIFF is quite literally a festival for everyone, the largest public film festival in the world; and while opening night is all about the stars, if you’re adventurous or curious, the festival offers a wide array of choices to satisfy any cinephile. This year, I sought out ***Rafiki***, or *Friend*, the new film from Wanuri Kahiu. It stood out in the Cannes lineup earlier this spring for being the first Kenyan film ever to be selected there. Toronto secured its North American premiere, and a lesbian drama, directed by a woman, and set in Nairobi, is exactly where I want to be right now. The TIFF Group promotes diversity as part of its year-round activities, and the festival is obviously its biggest platform.\n\n&gt;*Seeking out new voices, particularly voices from parts of the world I’ve never seen a movie from before, is part of what makes a film festival so enjoyable and memorable. This is what I’m looking for in cinema right now; this is what excites me as a moviegoer (no offense to Chris Pine, or his penis).*\n\n*Rafiki* immediately reminded me of this year’s *Skate Kitchen*, if only because it begins with Kena (Samantha Mugatsia) riding around on a skateboard, set to some upbeat dance music. But it also does something identical to Moselle’s film with its editing. Perhaps it’s a coincidence, perhaps great minds thing alike, but both films are exceptional at capturing the vulnerability and intimacy of friendships and romances, and do this specifically by desynchronizing the audio track from the images. They also play loosely with shot selection, re-arranging scenes into impressionistic, non-linear passages.\n\nThis occurs most pointedly in *Rafiki* when Kena and Ziki (Sheila Munyiva) make love for the first time in the back of a van, and images of them embracing are juggled with images of them eating a cupcake. The women in these films experience time in a more circular way; which is to say, time seems to emanate in various directions, instead of in a straight line. Time surrenders to pleasure, or they transcend it through each other. I feel like I’m just scratching the surface here of something that will require more thought and study, but for now, I will say these have been some of the most tender and beautiful scenes I’ve seen in movies all year.\n\nKahiu was in attendance to introduce the film and answer questions afterwards. Audience Q&amp;As can be pretty hit or miss, but sometimes they can get a good conversation going, and that was the case with *Rafiki*‘s Q&amp;A. The conversation ranged from censorship in the arts (*Rafiki* is banned in Kenya, apparently not because two women kiss, but because the ending is too hopeful), to the experiences of LGBTQ people in Kenya and the support and resources available to them, to the process of decolonization, and the way these topics and challenges intersect (current attitudes regarding homosexuality in Africa being a direct result of Western colonialism). It was an informative and inspirational discussion, full of hope for the future—just like the film itself—and I couldn’t think of a better way to kick off TIFF 2018. Also, Kahiu wants to develop a science-fiction feature next; can I just go ahead a buy a ticket now?\n\nAs I said earlier, I typically avoid the red carpet premieres; and I also typically avoid anything that is opening soon after or even during the festival. Another big premiere here is Michael Moore’s new documentary, *Fahrenheit 11/9*. It opens later this month, and I’m happy to wait. But there was one film that fell into both categories that I couldn’t resist. Shane Black’s ***The Predator*** opens next week, before the festival itself concludes, but TIFF is hosting the world premiere. Specifically, Midnight Madness is hosting. The Midnight Madness program screens a new movie each night of the festival, at 11:59pm, showcasing the best—or at least bloodiest—in genre filmmaking, largely focusing on horror, but with generous helpings of comedy and action also thrown into the mix. It’s rare that the red carpet rolls out at a Madness screening, and rarer still that a major film from a major studio, like a new *Predator* from 20th Century Fox, would actually show up at midnight for its world premiere. I didn’t want to miss it.\n\nBut, in retrospect, I could have. *The Predator* is in desperate need of a director’s cut, or any kind of alternative cut, to salvage whatever Shane Black was trying to do. But it’s also possible this project was misguided from inception and couldn’t be saved. The film I watched was a sloppy, haphazardly assembled action comedy, sometimes genuinely funny and thrilling but just as often utterly incompetent. *The Predator* is a deliberately, gleefully silly movie. Some will take issue with Black’s approach, I’m sure, but I don’t think there’s a problem with tone.\n\nRather, Black stumbles when he tries to flesh out the lore, falling into the obvious trap of developing answers to questions that never needed them. And the answers grow increasingly nonsensical, and stupid, as the film goes on. *The Predator* starts out novel enough, as the human characters stumble upon Predator technology, try to figure out how it works, and get into a lot of trouble along the way. Black has fun recontextualizing familiar concepts and throwing around self-referential winks but fails to focus this stuff into anything worthwhile.\n\nThe cast is uniformly entertaining and try their best to make the film work. I was particularly surprised to see Trevante Rhodes, who made a huge impression in *Moonlight*, and if that’s the only role you know him for, like I did, his casting here generates some killer whiplash. Rhodes and the other actors, including Thomas Jane and Keegan-Michael Key, play soldiers who bond in group therapy sessions. It’s an amusing inversion of the original film’s cast.\n\nThe women, unfortunately, don’t get much to do. Yvonne Strahovski is the first to grab a gun, ready for action, but is literally told to stay home. Olivia Munn is a competent and capable scientist, but spends much of the movie shooting herself in the foot, or sharing exposition duties with the film’s human antagonist, played by Sterling K. Brown. I won’t spoil the film’s many plot revelations; needless to say, there’s a charitable reading that Munn and Brown’s characters are functionally pulling shit out of their asses and operating on the basis of a working hypothesis, but the film seems content to roll with all of that information, all the way up to its ridiculous coda. Brown at least gets a lot of good lines and zingers, and clearly relishes his role. Munn, alas, gets to sit behind a rock and reiterate information for the audience, like explaining at one point that a “time advantage” means a Predator is going to give them a head start. Thanks, Legolas.\n\n*The Predator* is clearly stuck somewhere between a Shane Black film and a studio franchise release, not unlike *Iron Man 3*, which was dramatically hamstrung by the studio decision to swap Stark’s alcoholism with PTSD (something both of these films share, specifically, is a poor understanding of mental health and illness). But sometimes it’s hard to tell what was compromised, or what was just poorly executed, or if there’s even a real difference. Some of the action is sharp, but sometimes it’s cut to ribbons; sometimes the movie moves as ruthlessly as its alien characters, sometimes it can’t even figure out how to make one image flow into the next.\n\nI’ve seen three of Black’s films as a director, and would probably rank this last, with *The Nice Guys* being far and away the best of three, and *Iron Man 3*, which still manages to be a clever and subversive comic book film, in the middle. *The Predator*, for all of its ambition, never seems to figure out where it’s going. By the time the coda is setting up the foundation for a sequel, the Predator’s actions on Earth have become almost entirely incoherent; did it even know what the hell it was trying to do here? Did anybody when they were making this film?\n\nFor more on *The Predator*, check back here next weekend, when the film opens in theatres, for FilmEra’s official review from my fellow writer, Jacob Watson.\n\nAnd for more on TIFF, check back all throughout the week for more reviews and festival coverage from yours truly. Coming up, I’ll be diving into some short films and the latest offerings from the world of the avant-garde, and cover the world premieres of new films from Claire Denis, Mia Hansen-Løve, Apichatpong Weerasethakul, and more.\n\n*The 43rd Toronto International Film Festival runs from September 6th to 16th, 2018.*\n\n[https://thefilmera.com/](https://thefilmera.com/) you can follow the writer at the link",

The car in front of me was some ol’ dung beetle and I knew it’d be my luck if I passed him and put my pedal to the floor and I feared a kojak with a kodak was gonna see me and snatch me up good.\n\nI’m sorry, guys. Every time I see this film the language and culture of the old American highway comes through my fingers and into the keyboard. It infects my soul. You’ve got your gimmicks used to cash in on the fad from back in the day (god, do I need to explain what a CB radio is in this review?) but *Smokey and the Bandit* is way more than a cash-in. It’s probably what’s going to endure the ages and be relevant far into the future when Amazon drones drive our big-wheelers.\n\n[Smokey and the Bandit](https://thefilmera.com/2018/09/06/smokey-and-the-bandit-1977/) is a short, fun movie that features a lot of comedic scenes and a lot of car stunts. It’s about a former outlaw trucker who goes by the handle Bandit (Burt Reynolds) taking a ridiculous offer to run to Texarkana to pick up 400 cases of Coors beer and bring them over state lines into Georgia in twenty-eight hours. This movie is dated to its time in multiple ways; first is the actual premise: the reason this is dangerous is because over the state lines in Georgia running that kind of beer without a permit was bootlegging at the time. The reward to the Bandit of $80,000 seems ludicrous to anyone outside that current location at that current time. The other way is the language and culture of the film that are long gone but still feel warmly familiar. The culture is rooted in trucking and CB radio communications—which were a public way of traffic communication and had its own attitude and lingo—as well as a Southern flair that I think is lost in this current generation.\n\nAccompanying Bandit are Frog (Sally Field) and Snowman (Jerry Reed). Chasing Bandit throughout the second half of the run is Texas Sheriff Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason). This cast is phenomenal and definitely elevates the film beyond the subject matter and script allow.\n\nReed’s Snowman is particularly enjoyable. The character is reliable in every sense of the word, and Reed’s own written and performed music for the film is fantastic and absolutely makes the film in so many ways. It’s funny that the start of the film is a Reed song explaining “the legend” of the Bandit, but it works. It tells you what you need to know, is super catchy, and is the kind of ballad meant to build up myths like that. *Eastbound and Down* is an even more famous song and captures the fun of the film.\n\nFrog is a sort of love interest who belongs in this kind of movie and should be seen more in films. She’s a dissatisfied performer and a runaway bride, and her relationship with Bandit is founded on the feeling they have together. Not much else, and that’s okay.  Multiple scenes feature her unsure about the Bandit and her relationship with him, and she even questions, “Do we have a single thing in common?” She quizzes him on Broadway showtune musicians; Bandit quizzes her on Country musicians; and neither know anything about the other’s world. Bandit eases her doubts, however, when he imparts this wisdom: *“When you tell somebody something, it all depends on what part of the country you’re standing on to just how dumb you sound.”*\n\nGleason is clearly a comedic force of nature as Justice. I’m from the South and parts of the culture disappoint me and parts I think are perfectly redeemable. I think currently the South embraces the ugliest parts of itself without self criticism. There’s no symbols of the Confederacy here (to my recollection at least), and while the Southern outlaw is glamorized—it works. You root for the heroes, and Justice as the antagonist is delightfully repugnant. This is what I feel is missing in the South now, and this is the core of the film. Bandit’s mysterious charisma is matched against Justice’s position and persistence. Police in the film, and particularly Justice, are portrayed as disgusting, corrupt and bumbling. They pull rank and seek desperately to hold onto established order. The one moment of explicit racism (contrasted by the friendly racial atmosphere Bandit and Snowman share with strangers) is when Justice notices an African-American police officer and asks, “What is the world coming to?” Justice and his son in many ways represent what’s wrong with American law enforcement, and it’s totally beautiful to see that in a film that has strong southern pride. He’s also really funny, mean, and the best part about him is that his persistence to catch the Bandit is heroically admirable. You like one singular thing about him, and the rest is rotten to the core.\n\nAnd then there’s Burt Reynolds. I’m writing this not long after I’ve heard of his passing, and I can’t express in enough words how sad I am about it. Reynolds never had the stellar, critically acclaimed career he wanted, but from what he *starred* in he was not only charismatic and iconic, but his dramatic performances showcased his versatility. *Deliverance* was a landmark title, and Lewis Medlock was far from Reynolds’ cinematic personality. He delivered quality work in voice acting such as *All Dogs Go to Heaven* (a particular Bluth production I’m fond of) and even gave Academy-worthy work in films he didn’t actually like or agree with, such as *Boogie Nights*. He was a symbol for masculinity in a time where masculinity started to be questioned and broken down. He’s the best looking guy to ever sport a mustache. Being a modern, stick-shift cowboy is almost impossible without Reynolds. Nobody drove a car with a smile better than him.\n\nEven in low-effort appearances from the past two decades, he still gave sound performances that did not reek of laziness. From clever homages as major roles like in *The* *Dukes of Hazzard*(which is a movie based on a show that tried really hard to be *Smokey and the Bandit*) to outright indulgent cameos in modern pop culture hits like *Archer* and *Saints Row,* he’s irreplaceable. There’s two more movies slated to feature him: Tarantino’s *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood* and a lower budget affair in *Defining Moments.*\n\nAnd to talk about his performance specifically as the Bandit, he delivers the charm in aces.\n\n&gt;*The movie ticket is sold on Reynolds. That’s why you’re watching this; that’s why you’re reading this.*\n\nHis personality and delivery capture the character and tone of the scenes more than perfectly, and more importantly he’s absolutely magnetic to watch on screen. The absolute best is early in the film when he outruns a cop before they pick up the beer, and he looks at the camera and smiles. It’s priceless. His attitude matches how the audience should shape their sensibilities: *this is a ride, and we’re going to make it there as fast and as fun as possible.*\n\nThe actual car chases are fun enough, but I think the film falls too much on the “stupid cops follow Bandit somebody calls him on his CB tells him they’re setting up a trap and now the cops fall for it” formula. It’s okay, but you start to notice it near the end, and it’s definitely not the most graceful way to end car chases. Oh, also: the Pontiac Trans Am is a beautiful car. Seeing it do the stunts in this film is wicked satisfying. Particularly in the comedic portion where Frog is the one driving and the car does a bunch of U-turns and goofy donuts. Looks amazing even when what’s going on is a mess.\n\nThe film isn’t a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination. It’s not even Reynolds’ best work. It’s what he might be most remembered for by the public though and that’s okay. It’s a slice of fun and Americana that just doesn’t exist anymore. Cynicism isn’t here, speed is.\n\nSo I’m filled up on go-go juice and gonna head out, good buddies, got a long drive ahead. Wish you good numbers and I hope to see you all (and Burt too) another time.\n\n\\-By Brogan Chattin",

So, \n\n1) can anyone maybe point put some things I've missed and help me \"get it\"? \n\n2)are Jia's other movies better than this? I've heard it's sort of different from his older films.  \n\n",

        "author": "rkeaney",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/9dbe61/tense_technological_thriller_or_undercooked/",
        "text": "\\[[Video Review](https://youtu.be/Wyh2q3JnGbY)\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSearching is  directed by Aneesh Chaganty and stars John Cho as a young widowed father who is left reeling upon the disappearance of his teenage daughter, Margot. \n\nFollowing in the vein of films like Unfriended, *Searching* takes place entirely within the screens of electronic devices, prominently a laptop. This creative decision leads to interesting innovation and an emphasis on visual storytelling but also stretches in plausibility. Regarding the emphasis on visual storytelling, the director manages to effectively plant subtle visual cues throughout the mise en scene as well as conversely undercut the perfectly adequate visual evocation of story. This is done through an unnecessary reliance on hammering connections home visually as well as the use of overbearing music cues. At times this makes the fascinating concept seem heavy handed or over directed, particularly when it attempts to sell emotional or suspenseful moments. In a similar respect to the over the top music cues, the use of artificial camera shake during moments of tension seems forced and over the top. It’s this struggle between quite clever uses of subtlety and a complete disregard for it that undermines the potential effect of the film. \n\nThe film is certainly unpredictable, its central mystery takes the audience in a number of unexpected directions but it seems the writers were so wrapped up in creating a twisty mystery of red herrings and shocking revelations that character development and tonal consistency fell by the wayside. \n\nJohn Cho gives a committed performance as David but his character seems somewhat hindered by the relentless movement of the plot where beyond his reactions of stress and sadness we don’t really get a strong sense of his character as a fully rendered human being. His relationship with his daughter, Margot is littered with cliche which prevents us from fully investing ourselves in his predicament. Likewise with Debra Messing, who plays Vick, the detective investigating the case, her character feels undeveloped and though she’s a flawed character like John Cho’s David, she stills feels like a bland archetype with often montone line delivery. Both characters frequently fall into the role of espousing unnatural expository dialogue, often over explaining what we can already visually surmise from events on screen. If this can be said for the largely talented main cast, the side characters are even worse in this regard. Voice acting is prominent throughout the film with a number of adolescent side characters required to sell dramatic moments convincingly and ultimately feeling amateurish in their performances. Much like the films presentation of screens within screens, the people portrayed in it lack serious depth. \n\nTonally, the film seems a bit at odds with what it’s trying to accomplish. It seems unsure of whether it wants to be an unnerving crime thriller or an uplifting portrayal of triumph in the face of grief. This leads to a film that opens with bombastic, life affirming strings and melancholic piano melodies yet part way through has the audience seriously considering the possibility of nefarious incest as a cause for Margot’s disappearance. Unpredictable it undoubtedly is, but it’s one thing to shock your audience and another thing entirely to jar them.\n\nThis isn’t to say that the film is in anyway a failure. One area it succeeds in is its satisfying plot structure in terms of set up and pay off. For good or ill, it seems that everything on screen happens for a reason and if viewers are keen eyed enough they may be able to spot hidden visual clues before the protagonist does. One moment in particular regarding stock photos is a brilliantly unnerving moment. Furthermore, the film’s commentary on the way teenagers act in a social media and technology obsessed society seem quite well conveyed, the loneliness capable online even when surrounded by endless abilities to connect while not completely groundbreaking as an idea is similarly well conjured. Understandably given the genre, the uninhibited scope of online data and surveillance is portrayed in a largely positive light as a necessary method of investigation rather than an invasion of privacy. That being said, the potential dangers of speaking with strangers online is a prominent theme. \n\nSearching’s use of technology is quite clever for the most part, be it through using different social media accounts as puzzle pieces to figuring out Margot’s true character, missed call notifications as ominous harbingers for what’s to come or live video surveillance streaming to a laptop screen, the film manages to find innovative ways of sticking to its concept. At times however, this leads to the aforementioned stretches in plausibility. Though it undoubtedly benefits the audience and the visual medium, there are a number of moments that feel a little bit trite such as the tendency of characters to, even in an emergency, opt for video calls between one another, to type out their true feelings for a message before deleting it and sending something else or the convenience of social media photographs having pivotal character information caught in their backgrounds. \n\nSearching is undoubtedly an ambitious film with a beguiling mystery at its centre. It has a number of shocking moments and makes good use of its visual concept. However, the film could have benefited from a greater focus on character depth and development as well as broader directorial restraint when it comes to the evocation of its story. Its ambition works well in technical moments yet when it strives for heartfelt emotional ones it often comes off as cheesy or contrived.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[[Video Review](https://youtu.be/Wyh2q3JnGbY)\\]",
