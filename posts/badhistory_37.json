If you answered yes to all of those (and if you say no, you're a damn liar) then you'll love the newest addition to /r/BadHistory March Madness.\n\n[With bets piling up](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2z14p1/meta_the_official_rbadhistory_march_madness/) it's inevitable that some people will lose out, which means the bank gets to hold onto your sweet sweet fake cash while you presumably cry yourself to sleep over your loses. I'll be introducing a loan system that I'll elaborate on in the round 2 post but let's cut to the chase:\n\nBy the finals, the bank will be filled with cash that it wont have any use for. To raise the stakes of this game, the bank will offer up whatever it has to anyone who can correctly guess the set up of the full bracket--regardless of whether or not they actually placed a bet on any of the matches. \n\nThe person who gets the most brackets right gets 75% of the pot, second place gets 50% and third place gets 25% \n\n[Here's the bracket as it stands right now](http://i.imgur.com/vrsQjp9.jpg)\n\nIf you wish to participate, just edit the bracket and post your completed bracket in the comments below.",

The third problem is that it takes terms like \"bronze age\" and \"iron age\" as historical realities rather than convenient short-hands developed by a Danish museum administrator to organize his material. Fourthly bronze is honestly of somewhat limited value as a tool, which is why it tended to be used for weapons or prestige items. Fifthly the Renaissance is not the same think as the Age of Enlightenment, and the latter was both after and in many respects a reaction to the Scientific Revolution. Sixthlish the Industrial Revolution was arguably more about organization of capital and labor than new technologies, but honestly I'm not prepared to die on that hill. Seventhlywise the \"biological age\" is probably the worst name I can think of for a hypothetical age in which humans gain mastery over biological processes.

        "text": "I finally found [this website](http://www.etymonline.com/cw/dixie.htm) , it is filled to the brim with bizzare qoute mines , poor graphic design and odd conclusions.\nLet`s first look at [The upper south](http://www.etymonline.com/cw/virginia.htm).\nFirst it begins by arguing that slavery wasn 't  the cause of the upper south secession, it pretty dismissive manner.\n&gt;Making out that the Civil War was \"about\" slavery also has the advantage of being quick, clean, and easy to write. Get a hatful of quotes and you're done. The Confederate leaders and documents supply them in abundance. Taking this position also seems to show an awareness of the slaves' realities, ... And who would want to peel back the easy answers to probe the complexities of the past, when the easy answers feel so good and absolve so much? A small class of bad guys: an aberation in the great American history.H\n\nWow , One the whole south was based on slavery and arguably the whole united states.Second why did  no state that had abolished slavery secede from the union. Answer this.                                                                           In another highly bizarre move , it argues that union was equally based on slavery, and that the confederate constitution proves other causes. \n&gt;the national government of the CSA -- was no more built on slavery than was the Northern Union. The Confederate Constitution was pretty much a carbon copy of the U.S. Constitution, except that it stipulated that the government could not impose protective tariffs, grant subsidies, or finance internal improvements. (But then, we are constantly told that the South was \"all about slavery,\" so economic points like that don't matter).\n\nOne the changes that Southerners wanted to make to the constitution has little to do with the causes of the war , besides let  look at it`s dicussion of slavery.\n&gt; Article I Section 9(4)\nNo bill of attainder, ex post facto law, or law denying or impairing the right of property in negro slaves shall be passed.[14]\n\nDefinitely has nothing to do with slavery......\nNext it makes are argument that can easily turn right back on them.\n&gt;\n Virginia, Tennessee, even North Carolina, with a hostile anti-slavery United States on their frontier, could never hope to maintain slavery as a viable economic and social institution. Their pre-war complaints about fugitives prove they knew it. The mere presence of \"free\" states nearby in the 1850s exerted an economic pressure that was rapidly draining slavery out of the Border States.\n\nSo proctecting slavery had nothing to do with being away from those sfree states  and them letting our fugtive slaves into there state.\nI would debunk moro but  the tone is so dismissve and i don`t have a history degree.\nWhy is this website bad history , well it fails to understand slavery and the civil war and most important race relations in the south\n\n\n\n\n \n",

They are one and the same.\n\nNow, obviously an immediate problem for this theory is that one of the key figures in the creation of fascism, Benito Mussolini, was a lifelong anticlerical atheist, as [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito_Mussolini#Religious_views) well documents, quoting liberally from Denis Mack Smith's excellent biography. Early in his political career, Mussolini shocked audiences with his anti-religious rhetoric and demanded that fellow socialists who held on to the Christian faith or agreed to a Church wedding be expelled from the party. According to Mussolini, the Church was an authoritarian foe of freedom of thought, and its priests were \"black germs\" infesting Italy, the servants of capitalism, persecutors of the Jews, and corrupters of young minds. However, he later adapted a more pragmatic stance towards the Church. Courting the support of the powerful institution, Mussolini brought a resolution to the long-standing [Roman Question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Question) with the Lateran Pacts of 1929 and enacted a number of Catholic moral stances into law, outlawing divorce, contraception, and Freemasonry. Therefore, the user attempts to rescue his thesis without pretending that Mussolini was a \"right-wing Catholic\" by adding, in passing, that Mussolini had \"close ties with the Vatican.\"\n\n&gt; You're arbitrarily picking one single person, who by the way held close ties with the Vatican, to support your statement.\n\nIn reality, Mussolini's relationship with the Vatican was not close, but tense. In private, he never stopped speaking of Catholicism in the same tone; speaking of the papacy to his cabinet, Mussolini described a need to \"*liquidare questo problema una volta per tutte*,\" to root out this problem once and for all. In any event, arguing that fascism in Italy had close ties to Catholicism would not support the original claim that fascism *is* right-wing Catholicism. If that is true, it would seem Mussolini, *Il Duce* himself, the man Hitler stole all his ideas from, believed in a somehow corrupt or deficient form of fascism, which makes it \"convenient\" that I can now \"arbitrarily\" focus on this one esoteric fascist leader—unlike, say, the much more well-known and important [Jozef Tiso](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/2z22hu/no_idea_how_to_respond_to_this_im_not_a_history/cpf2bt9). (No, not Josip Tito, Jozef Tiso. You know, the President of Slovakia.) But perhaps that's what he really meant—that Catholicism had nothing to do with Mussolini's pseudo-fascism, or any of his crimes.",

        "text": "[link](http://feminismandreligion.com/2012/06/10/where-did-the-gods-come-from-by-barbara-ardinger/)\n\n&gt;I attended a book club at a beautiful metaphysical bookstore a few weeks ago where we discussed the conquest of matrilineal civilizations by the patriarchy. A man in the group leaned forward and asked, “But how did the Goddess get overcome?” So I told him. As my friend Miriam Robbins Dexter writes in her essay in The Rule of Mars, young “warrior heroes” came galloping out of the Russian steppes and the Caucasus Mountains, including Afghanistan, which no one (not even Alexander the so-called Great) has ever conquered.\n\nThe Caucasus Mountains don't include Afghanistan, which actually was conquered by Alexander. He even founded [Iskandriya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandahar). Also Mongols.\n\n&gt;The boys were carrying their thunder-solar-sky gods with them. Those gods included Jehovah, Zeus, Jupiter, and Ares. (Allah arrived later.)\n\nNobody in 4000BC Central Asia/Eastern Europe worshipped Jehovah. They didn't worship Zeus, Jupiter and Ares either, but Jehova is the worst offence. She also makes it seem like ancient IE deities were only guys, when all the descending cultures have godesses and some of them might have origin in proto IE period. Watkins lists some of them in *How to Kill a Dragon: Aspects of Indo-European Poetics*.\n\n&gt;Testosterone-crazed invaders out to have a good time. They ran over every goddess and temple in their path, and to make themselves seem more legitimate, they “married” former Great Goddesses (like Hera) to their thunder gods (Zeus).\n\nNo evidence that neolithic temples were ran over or that the invaders were testosterone crazed. And was there one or more Great Goddess? Were there gods? Were they evil like the Central Asian ones were?\n\n&gt;Their gods are famous for hurling lightning bolts, enticing their generals to invade peaceful, Goddess-worshipping lands (like Canaan), and populating their new turf via rape, which is how the innumerable sons of Zeus were conceived.\n\n[Canaan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canaan) was not invaded by Indoeuropean tribes - it is Semitic. I strongly doubt it was peaceful, Goddess-worshipping lands either.\n\n&gt;The new gods and their carriers thus planted the seeds of warfare in society and its literature. I describe one such invasion in the prologue of Secret Lives, where after a horrific vision that causes her the blind herself, the shaman sends her people out into the world to escape the coming hooligans on their horses and become the secretive, dark “little people” of Europe.\n\nInvaders from Afghanistan came to Europe to exterminate peaceful People of Color there. Also your novel is bad and should feel bad.\n\n&gt;Even though statues and paintings of these gods show them as mature, bearded, enthroned men, they were young and energetic when they first arrived in their new territories of Europe and Asia Minor. Their grandmother was the Great Goddess, also known as the Great Mother or Great Creatrix. This goddess is Anatolian, but we know of ancient, primal Great Mothers all over the world. In her encyclopedic New Book of Goddesses &amp; Heroines, Patricia Monaghan lists 101 mother goddesses, from Aakuluujjusi (the great creatrix of the Inuit people) to Zywie (a Polish great goddess). Monaghan also lists 75 “ancestral mothers,” including Eve and Sarah, Brigantia, and Neith.\n\nWhich Anatolian goddess is grandmother of who?\n\n&gt;Before Jehovah arrived in Abraham’s camp and spoke to him, the people at the eastern end of the Mediterraneanworshipped Asherah.\n\nThe name [Jehovah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah) is medieval christian misreading of bible. And [Semitic polytheism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Semitic_religion) don't real.\n\nThere is more but I need to go to testosterone crazed sleep.\n\n",

        "text": "Hello /r/badhistory. Long time lurker (and occasional commenter), first time poster.\n\nI can't drive. There, I said it. I'm 26 years old and I can't drive a car. It's long story as to why involving a game of rugby, a broken ankle and a set of metal pins that are now in said ankle but the overarching point I'm making here is that I can't drive.\n\nSo I spend a lot of time, every day, sat in the bus station of the nearest town, waiting for the bus to take me the 9 miles back to my house. And recently I've been afflicted with a particularly annoying piece of bad science history that I felt was worth sharing with you lovely people.\n\n[As a student, he was no Einstein](http://imgur.com/rZ7z4Fo)\n\n[Values.com](http://www.values.com) or 'The Foundation for a Better Life' are the creators of the \\#PassItOn campaign, a well meaning campaign to try to encourage people to be nice to each. It's good that I wasn't in charge of this because, as a 26 year old curmudgeon, I would be liable to call it 'The Campaign for everyone to try displaying the tiniest level of human fucking decency for once', which may not have done so well.\n\nAnyway, to the Bad History! This is an oft repeated claim about Einstein, the refrain of the parents of under-performing students and quack motivational speaker who are trying to make the asinine point that 'who you are now doesn't reflect on who you might be' everywhere. But sadly for both those groups of people, it just isn't true.\n\nTo quote Walter Isaacson's *Einstein: His Life and Universe*:\n\n&gt;One widely held belief about Einstein is that he failed math as a student, as assertion that is made, often accompanied by the phrase \"as everyone knows\", by scores of books and thousands of websites designed to reassure underachieving students. It even made it into the famous \"Ripley's Believe It or Not!\" column.\n\n&gt;Alas, Einstein's childhood offers history many savoury ironies, but this is not one of them. In 1935, a rabbi in Princeton showed him a clipping of the Ripley's column with the headline \"Greatest Living Mathematician Failed in Mathematics.\" Einstein laughed. \"I never failed in mathematics,\" he replied, correctly. \"Before I was fifteen I had mastered differential and integral calculus.\"\n\n&gt;In fact, he was a wonderful student, at least intellectually. In primary school, he was at the top of his class. \"Yesterday, Albert got his grades,\" his mother reported to an aunt when he was 7. \"One again he was ranked first.\" At the gymnasium, he disliked the mechanical learning of languages such as Greek and Latin, a problem exacerbated by what he later said was his \"bad memory for words and texts.\" But even in these courses, Einstein consistently got top grades. Years later, when Einstein celebrated his fiftieth birthday and there were stories about how poorly the great genius had fared at the gymnasium, the school's current principal made a point of publishing a letter revealing how good his grades really were.\n\nSo there we have it folks. Don't believe everything you read on the side of a bus. ",

An additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders are included by some historians bringing the total to approximately eleven million.  \n\nMoving on with the rant:\n&gt;For example, one valid question to ask is how the Nazis could have incinerated so many people when incineration is extremely energy intensive and they were already facing resource shortages from the blockade. Incineration on a mass scale is unheard of because of how much energy and resources it would require to carry it out.\n\nFear not, brave ~~neo-Nazi~~ holocaust denier, [these guys](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/augas.html) have the answers to your question:\n&gt;Crematorium I operated [at Auschwitz] from August 15, 1940 until July 1943. According to calculations by the German authorities, 340 corpses could be burned every 24 hours after the installation of the three furnaces.\n\nYep, that definitely sounds like \"Incineration on a mass scale\" to me.  \n\nBack to the holocaust denier:  \n&gt;Even with all the modern technology we have, we cannot afford to incinerate people on a that scale.\n\nAgain, rule 2 prohibits me from discussing anything about this, and the rest of the comment is nothing but this brave soul ~~whining~~ complaining about his precious freeze peaches.  \n\nApologies for the low effort. I hadn't much time to go into detail.  \n\nCredit to /u/Spam4119 for [pointing out this badhistory](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/2z1bjs/one_valid_question_to_ask_is_how_the_nazis_could/) on SRS.  \n\nEdit: Oh yeah, I forgot to add [some more stuff, regarding the cremation part:](http://www.hdot.org/en/learning/myth-fact/cremation1.html)  \n&gt;In Auschwitz the authorities were not burdened by respect for the dead or any need to consider civilian rules or laws regarding cremation.  \n\n&gt;Multiple bodies were cremated together. The muffles (the actual openings in the oven; there were 52 in total in Auschwitz) were filled with as many bodies as could be fit into them.  \n\n&gt;The men who worked in the Sonderkommandos quickly learned how to combine the bodies of fat people, skeletal 'Muselmänner' and children to achieve maximum results (that is, more bodies could be burned in less time).\n\n&gt;Once the first bodies started to burn they just kept putting more bodies in to keep the fires hot. The result was continuous operation at very high efficiency in which very little fuel was needed to keep the process going for hours or days.\n\nYeah, so not many resources were involved. Also, not all the bodies involved were cremated.",

        "text": "The subject for today is *The Killing Ground* By Tim Travers.\n\nMaybe not so much bad history as bad historiography. In this case, relying not on what happened, but on what people said, to evaluate the role of the Haig, the BEF and GHQ in the First World War. The overall thesis being that GHQ struggled to implement and adapt to new technologies because they were weird Edwardian fuddy-duddies who valued morale over firepower and the psychological battlefield over the technological battlefield.\n\n\nWhen evaluating an event as massive as the Great War, it’s inherently a perilous thing to rely on what people say, or are alleged to have said, or are alleged to have said about other people. Not least because one is in danger of simultaneously losing sight of what actually happened and of spuriously selecting quotes to support your preconceived hypothesis.\n\n\nNaturally with such a large event, there are going to be a lot of people who said a lot of things, and the problem for a historian is in not relying too much on a small selection of sources, and thus absorbing and assimilating whatever inherent bias those sources convey, to the exclusion of contrary viewpoints.\n\n\n**Small selection of sources &amp; Selecting quotes to support a ready-made conclusion**\n\n\n1. Thus when analysing the Great War, it would thus be as ridiculous to rely on Owen and Sassoon as principle sources as Edmonds and Liddell-Hart. Not least because all of these men had axes to grind against the principle subjects in question – Haig and GHQ. So how much does Travers rely on these two sources? Well, looking at Chapter 1, we find 106 references of which Liddell-Hart is mentioned 18 times and Edmonds 40 times. Now if you think that was a fluke, then let’s look at Chapter 7. This time there are 146 references of which Liddell-Hart is mentioned 7 times and Edmonds 60 times. Still not enough? In Chapter 8 there are 40 references of which no less than 27 refer to Liddell-Hart or Edmonds.\n\n\nThus, Travers seems to be placing a disproportionate weight on a small number of sources with 50% of references in the chapters I examined relating to just two individuals, *who are by Travers’ own admission, biased*.\n\n\n2. On pages 103 and 104, Travers gives us a potted biography of Haig from Sandhurst onwards, based entirely on what Charteris said, along with the obligatory back-hander from Liddell-Hart. This is topped off with the summation that \n\n\n&gt; Haig’s personality prevented him from easily accepting innovation and change \n\n\nThis will bring us nicely into the “losing sight of actual events bit\" below, because the assertion is just demonstrably untrue. From machine guns to aerial reconnaissance, from gas to tanks, from Lewis guns to the scientific application of artillery, hell even *electronic countermeasures*, the pace of change and innovation in the BEF in the Great War was blistering. Let’s be quite clear these changes and innovations didn’t get there by osmosis and their presence as an empirical fact is totally incongruous with the notion of hidebound, conservative C in C who was resistant to anything new. \n\nIn fact, as most commentators would reasonably agree, if Haig had a problem with innovation and change it was in *expecting too much of it*, the diametrical opposite of rejecting it.\n\n\n**Losing sight of actual events**\n\n\n1.\tTravers doesn’t understand machine guns: Its worth reproducing some of Chapter 3, page 63, here (almost) verbatim:\n\n\n&gt; British reaction to the early French mitrailleur [sic] of 1870-71 was to see the gun as an artillery piece [..] the director of artillery in 1872, Sir John Adye, rejected the mitrailleur as a weapon of ‘limited powers and of such exceptional use’ that it was ‘far more likely to prove an encumbrance than an assistance to the Army. Adye conceded the mitrailleur but declared it was ‘doubtful wether exceptionally complicated weapons for purposes so rare should be maintained. Adye was overruled, but certain attributes of the gun became fixed in the army’s mind through these early discussions – the machine gun was complicated and delicate, it was vulnerable because slow and visible [sic], useful in defence but not in attack, it seemed like an artillery piece but was rejected by the artillery, and above all, it’s uses were fleeting and exceptional. Most of these attributes, particularly the last, stayed with the gun into the first world war…\n\n&gt; Summarising the early reaction to the gun, and recalling that the true machine gun with an automatic gas recoil system was not invented until 1884 by Hiram Maxim and then not introduced into the army until 1894, it is clear that the mitrailleur faced two main obstacles in the British Army. First traditional loyalties to other arms shunted the gun to a peripheral status, except in colonial warfare; and second, since the gun did not clearly belong to any particular arm or have any particular constituency, this meant that its role was also fixed as peripheral – as a weapon of unusual or exceptional use.\n\n\nWhere to even begin with this lot? I mean, where would they have got idea that the [mitrailleuse]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitrailleuse#mediaviewer/File:Mitrailleuse_front.jpg) was a bit like an artillery piece? Silly Edwardians!\n\n&gt; Adye was overruled\n\nHe bloody well wasn’t. The mitrailleuse was never adopted for service in the British army. It wasn’t adopted by the Russians, the Turks or Proosians or any other army, and even the French ditched them after ’71 on account of their utter shitness.\n\nAnd next we see a gentle segue from discussing a failed French weapons system and applying the entirely justified assessment of it to the machine gun as a whole\n\n&gt; Most of these attributes, particularly the last, stayed with the gun into the first world war\n\nNo. they didn’t. Because no one was dumb enough to use a mitrailleuse by 1914.\n\n&gt; gas recoil system\n\nThe Maxim gun was recoil actuated. Travers seems to be confused here about the gas actuation of the Lewis gun.\n\n&gt; not introduced into the army until 1894\n\nSir Garnet Wolseley placed the first order for Maxim guns in 1888. Travers is probably getting confused here between the introduction the Maxim and its first real use in the First Matabele War of 1893 to 1894.\n\n&gt; it is clear that the mitrailleur faced two main obstacles in the British Army\n\nHang on a sec! I thought we were talking about *actual* machine guns here, having established that the \"mitrailleur\" was never adopted in the first place. \n\n&gt; except in colonial warfare\n\nAs opposed to all the non-colonial warfare the British army was engaged in at the time?\n\n&gt; this meant that its role was also fixed as peripheral – as a weapon of unusual or exceptional use\n\nThis is completely at odds with the use of Maxims in the Sudan. To quote Haig complaining that they didn’t have Maxims available when *actively seeking out the enemy*\n\n&gt; The Horse Artillery against enemy of this sort is no use. We felt the want of machineguns when working alongside of scrub for searching some of the tracks.\n\n\nIn summary, Travers seems capable of making distinctions between the mitrailleuse and the Maxim, but seems incapable of understanding that they are very different weapons and that the poor assessment of the former is not only totally valid, but was in no way applicable to the latter.\n\n\nAs with machine guns, so it is with tanks. \n\n\nOn page 76, he attempts to draw analogies between the way the high command regarded and implemented the tank and the machine gun, completely failing to factor in the evolving (and generally poor) performance of the tank – even at the battle of Messines Ridge Road in September 1917, which was a decisive success, none of the tanks could get forward at all – and instead imagines that new weapons were pushed to the periphery due to the conservatism of the high command in some imaginary battle between the psychological battlefield and the technological battlefield.\n\n\nIt is in obsessing over his own synthesis of morale vs firepower and technology vs psychology that Travers fails to see the wood from the trees – to evaluate what someone said against what actually was done – and that is Bad History.\n\n",

        "text": "Hello all, long time reader first time poster. \n\nFollowing a day of horrid sports news such as the Browns being run around in circles in Free Agency, and the Illini losing in spectacular fashion in the B1G Tournament, I wondered where else this day could go. Timely enough an askreddit thread asking \"Who is someone that we praise but was actually a horrible person\" hooo boy Get your drinks out. \n\nOne of the top claims however, made an odd claim about President Lincoln. as seen [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2yt84w/who_is_someone_that_we_praise_but_was_actually_a/cpcpli7) with, as I post this, 3800+ upvotes and gold. \n\nIt's a bit of a different stroke than what we are used with most bad history associated with Abraham \"Adolf\" Lincoln, (Don't fret though, that appears in the child comments) but It struck me as odd, but more importantly, something I could comment on! I am not historian by trade, but have always had a constant love of History. In college, I took a class that gave and exhaustive look at Abraham Lincoln's life down to the point that all of us who took the class could have probably written our own books on the man. Throughout all the sources I looked through, I had never heard anything about Lincoln being a cockfighting referee, much less that it directly lead to him receiving the \"Honest Abe\" moniker. \n\nUpon a google search, you find [this](http://thelibrary.org/lochist/periodicals/wrv/v35/n2/f95d.htm) article written by the White River Valley Historical Society. The twenty year old article focuses mostly on the history of cockfighting as whole but does mention this blurb\n\n&gt; America’s elite icons competed, too. They included Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, Andrew and Stonewall Jackson, and Abraham Lincoln, who, according to lore, not only was a referee at cockfights, but received his sobriquet, \"Honest Abe,\" for his fairness as a sporting judge.\n\nIt's not impossible to say that the listed people did not ever attend, bet on, or participate in a cock fight. Especially in Lincoln's case for a common activity in frontier america. There is no doubt that a young Lincoln was aware of the activity.\n\nBut it seems that claim of Lincoln being a cockfighting referee comes from a letter written by a Abner Y. Ellis, that was sent to Lincoln's former law partner, William Herndon. Herndon was at the time writing a biography of Lincoln. Despite Herndon's closeness to Lincoln, the biography is controversial and some of his biases against Mary Todd Lincoln are on display within. Lincoln's son Robert denounced the book thoroughly. While the value of Herndon's recollection does make it worth examining, the various hurdles encountered in the biography, such as Herndon's alcoholism, financial troubles and disputes with his co-writer on the direction of the book, make it not considered an authority on Lincoln and his life. \n\nThere also seems to be a discrepancy in the way the tale was told in the biography and Ellis's letter itself. I'll be quoting from [\"For the People, A Newsletter from the Abraham Lincoln Association\"](http://abrahamlincolnassociation.org/Newsletters/5-1.pdf) which looks into the story. First the text from Herndon's biography.\n\n&gt;At this time in its brief history\nNew Salem was what in the parlance\nof large cities would be called a fast\nplace; and it was difficult for a young\nman of ordinary moral courage to\nresist the temptations that beset him\non every hand. It remains a matter\nof surprise that Lincoln was able to\nretain his popularity with the hosts of\nyoung men of his own age, and still\nnot join them in their drinking bouts\nand carousals. “I am certain,” contends\none of his companions (A.Y. Ellis),\n“that he never drank any intoxicating\nliquors—he did not even in those days\nsmoke or chew tobacco.” In sports\nrequiring either muscle or skill he took\nno little interest. \n\nAs an aside, there is some discussion of Lincoln. A popular tale is that while Lincoln, although was not one for fighting, wrestled against the leader of a local gang of New Salem trouble makers, the Clary's Grove Boys. There are different results of the outcome, but it did supposedly help Lincoln earn respect in New Salem, even from the Clary's Grove Boys. This tale is the basis for Lincoln's induction into the wrestling hall of fame. \n\n&gt;He indulged in all the\ngames of the day, even to a horse race\nor cockfight. At one eventful chicken\nfight, where a fee of twenty-five cents\nfor the entrance of each fowl was\nassessed, one Bap. McNabb brought\na little red rooster, whose fighting\nqualities had been well advertised for\ndays in advance by his owner. Much\ninterest was naturally taken in contest.\nAs the outcome of these contests was\ngenerally a quarrel, in which each man,\ncharging foul play, seized his victim,\nthey chose Lincoln umpire, relying not\nonly on his fairness but his ability to\nenforce his decisions. In relating what\nfollowed I cannot improve on the\ndescription furnished me in February\n1865, by Ellis who was present.\n“They formed a ring, and the time\nhaving arrived, Lincoln, with one hand\non each hip and in a squatting position,\ncried ‘Ready.’ Into the ring they toss\ntheir fowls. Bap’s red rooster along\nwith the rest. But no sooner had the\nlittle beauty discovered what was to\nbe done than he dropped his tail and\nran. The crowd cheered, while Bap.\nin disappointment picked him up\nand started away, losing his quarter\nand carrying home his dishonored\nfowl. Once arrived at the latter place\nhe threw his pet down with a feeling\nof indignation and chagrin. The little fellow, out of sight of all rivals,\nmounted a wood pile and proudly\nflirting out his feathers, crowed with all\nhis might. Bap. looked on in disgust.\n‘Yes, you little cuss,’ he exclaimed,\nirreverently, ‘you’re great on dress\nparade, but not worth a d——n in\na fight.’” It is said—how truthfully I\ndo not know—that at some period\nduring the late war Mr. Lincoln in\nconversation with a friend likened\nMcClellan to Bap. McNabb’s rooster.\nSo much for New Salem sports.\n\nMeanwhile, the text of Ellis's letter, in all it's charm. \n\n&gt;You ask Me in the one Just recvd to\nrelate Some of the Storys &amp; anecdotes\nas told by Mr Lincoln whether smutty\nor chast this is hard to do as there are\nbut few if any who can tell them so\nwell as he Could. However as You\nhave promised that No one Shall ever\nsee them but your self I will endeavor\ndo so though Many of them you have\nheard before\nFirst; Bap McNabbs Red Rooster\nI early times the Boys in and about old\nSangamon Town got up a Free chicken\nfight or free to all to Enter his rooster\nby payin 25 cts entrance fee\nWell Bap had a verry Splendid\nRed Rooster and he with others was\nentered\nWell the eventful day arrived and\nBap with his little Beauty was their in\nall his splendere.\nThe time arrives and into the ring\nthey toss their chickens Baps with the\nrest but no sooner had the little beauty\ndiscovered what was to be done he\ndroped his tale and run\nBap being very much disappointed\npicked him up and went home loosing\nhis quarter &amp; dishonored chicken\nand as soon as he got home he\ntossed his pet down in the yard on his\nown dung hill—The little fellow then\nstood up &amp; flirted out his beautiful\nfeathers &amp; crowed as brave as a Lion.\nBap Viewed closely &amp; remarked\nYes You dam little cuss you are\nGreat on a parade but you are not\nworth a Dam in a fight\nit is said that Mr L remarked\nto a friend soon after McClellands\nfizzle before Richmond That Little\nMcClelland reminded him of Bap\nMcNabbs Little Red Rooster.\n\nHerndon account(who, for clarification, would have not witnessed this event. Lincoln and Herndon met later in Springfield) adds the note of Lincoln umpiring the cock fighting match, whereas Ellis just remarks that Lincoln knew of the account of the cockfight, but does not suggest that Lincoln was involved. Recalling such a story would be consistent with Lincoln's humor, which often called on analogies and parables to make his point. Still, Herndon's account concedes that he doesn't know if Lincoln actually compared Gen. McClellan to Rooster. \n\nWhy Herndon (or the co-writer, Jesse Weik) added the mention of Lincoln officiating the event is tough to say. But ultimately the tale of Abraham Lincoln, Chicken Hater is mostly based on a misinterpretation of an anecdote. \n\nAs for the Honest Abe moniker, there are a few more likely sources for the name, anywhere his time as shop keeper, which includes legends of him walking several miles to make amends for short changing a customer, to his time on the Illinois Legal Circuit, which made him quite a respected figure in Central Illinois and help lead him to a career in politics. I'd wager it didn't come from him running a cockfighting/luchador arena.\n\nEDIT: Shout out to a well done Askhistorians post [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2yvh27/abe_lincoln_got_the_name_honest_abe_because_of/cpditaq) which goes more indepth into the origins of \"Honest Abe\" and touches on the cockfighting story as well. \n\nNote to mods: I'm just doing a quick edit at work, I can't tell if Askhistorians allows NP or not and I'm not sure if I've set the link up correctly. I can remove if in violation. \n\nJust something I've whipped together. Feel free to tear it to shreds if you would like. I am paraphrasing somewhat from materials in the class and from my final essay in that class which focused on Lincoln's legal career. ",

        "text": "I did a quick search and apparently there hadn't been a thread about this movie, so I thought I would do a quick overview so we can all yell about tanks at each other. Yelling about tanks is, of course, the purest form of Internet Debate.\n\nFURY is a 2014 film, written and directed by David Ayer, starring Brad Pitt, Logan Lerman, Jon Bernthal, Michael Pena, and Shia LaBeouf. It follows a Sherman tank crew (66th of the 2nd AD) through the final days of the European theater of WW2. While I don't recall a specific date given, the film seems to take place sometime in the spring of 1945, with Allied forces advancing into Germany.\n\nThe film owes a very clear debt to *Death Traps,* a book about Sherman tankers.\n\n**THE GOOD**\n\n* Fury goes to fairly exceptional efforts for accuracy for a Hollywood action movie. The film was shot with the cooperation of the Bovington Tank Museum, and is notable for featuring, as its only armor vs armor fight, 4 Sherman tanks against Tiger 131, Bovington's pride and joy and the only functional Tiger I tank in the world. This marks the first time an actual Tiger I has appeared in a movie since 1946.\n\n* While I'm far from an expert on WW2 uniforms, the main cast looks pretty much right, if you allow for some irregularity due to their lackluster discipline as burnt-out veterans in the later days of the war. Rank markings and uniforms are consistently correct, although the main cast would obviously never pass a parade inspection.\n\n* The film tries very hard to show the claustrophobia and limited visibility inherent in operating a WW2 tank. Multiple shots are from the POV of the characters and show the approximate view through the periscopes. The film follows the replacement hull-gunner, and his constricted view point comes up regularly.\n\n* Related to that, Brad Pitt's character (hilariously named Wardaddy), as the commander, generally fights \"heads up\" with his hatch open and his seat elevated, relaying orders through the intercom. The other Sherman commanders also do this, and it is perfectly appropriate to do so - most experienced tank commanders in WW2 did this due to the infinitely superior visibility and awareness.\n\n* A close range Panzerfaust attack against a Sherman's flank causes it to burst into flame, a notorious problem.\n\n* A 5cm Pak 38 anti-tank gun shot just bounces right off the E8's mantlet, which is pretty much right - the Pak 38 would be out of date by this point.\n\n* 7.5cm Pak 40 shots are treated as the appropriate threat they are, and in fact identified as high velocity rounds by their SOUND, as they are firing from camoflage.\n\n* Shia LaBouef's character dies at the end.\n\n**THE BAD**\n\n* It's a major theme throughout the film that the veteran crew have come to regard their tank (the titular Fury) as their home, even decorating the interior with personal items and trophies. According to the film, they have been united as a crew in this tank since the campaign in North Africa. This is fine, except....\n\n* Fury is a M4A3E8(76)WHVSS, commonly known as an \"Easy Eight.\" For those of you not conversant with the bewildering array of WW2 Sherman variants, this means that it is a version of the M4 Sherman powered by a Ford GAA V8 (that's the A3) upgunned with a high velocity 76mm gun in the T23 turret, and with the wider tracks of the Horizontal Volute Suspension System kit. This is a late-war model, first produced around July 1944. That's not in and itself a problem, except that the script repeatedly bangs home that Fury has been the home of this crew since the North African campaign, which ended in 1943. As Fury doesn't have the experimental Chrono Sphere upgrade developed by Albert Einstein after the war, we are forced to consider this an error.\n\n* In mutliple combats, Fury fires White Phosphorus incindiary shells, something not available for the Easy Eight's 76mm gun.\n\n* The armor vs. armor battle has some issues. We have four Sherman tanks (one M4A3E8, one M4A1(76), one M4(105)HVSS, and one M4A2) face off against a lone Tiger I across a slightly hilly field that sure looks a lot like Dorset. The Allied commanders seem to not have a great understanding of what they're fighting, which seems unusual at best for veterans at this late stage in the war, even given the Tiger's rarity. They send two M4s head-on against the Tiger while the wing Shermans attempt to flank the Tiger on either side. Predictably, both \"head on\" Shermans are knocked out almost immediately, and the fight boils down to Fury and the Tiger attempting to flank each other at extreme close range, with the victory basically boiling down to who can rotate their turret faster. Problems with this scene include the fact that Fury takes a DIRECT HIT at less than a hundred meters to some logs mounted on her side hull. The logs are blown away but the underlying hull is completely unscratched. This is pretty much impossible given the ballistics of the Tiger's 88. Fury finally manages to penetrate the Tiger I with an AP shot to the engine deck from the rear. This is fine, except that they didn't need to - the 76mm gun Fury carries should have easily penetrated the Tiger from the side at those ranges, and in fact would have had a pretty good chance to penetrate from the front, depending on where the hit was. I could be uncharitable and say that they are pretty bad shots, but I guess they needed to have the fight take at close range for the purposes of having it make any sense to the audience. \n\n* Let's just say that the climactic battle is wildly improbable. It's an action movie. If you pretend the battalion they fight off are not SS regulars but more poorly trained Volksturm, it's sorta okay. Weird shit can happen in war sometimes. \n\n**THE WEIRD** \n\n* Wardaddy (still hilarious) uses a captured Sturmgewehr 44 rifle as his go-to weapon in combat. While occasional Allied use of captured German weaponry is hardly unknown, the StG-44 is an unusual choice. Its comparative rarity would seem to make procuring ammunition problematic, and it is quite long, making it seemingly unwieldy to pull out the top hatch of a Sherman. The rest of the crew generally sticks to handguns and M3 grease guns. \n\n* Fury has two turret-mounted machine guns, which is unusual but does give it a distinctive look. It has an M1919 0.30 cal in a forward turret (commander's) mount and an M2 .50 cal on an anti-air mount to the rear of the turret. Shermans generally only had one exterior machine gun, with early models featuring a single M2, mid-war models generally having an M1919. Late in the war the M2s became more common again due to their greater performance. This is unusual but I'd hesitate to call it inaccurate - there's nothing really stopping a crew from keeping both guns on an M4 if they could get them. \n\n* The film uses a lot of CGI color-coded tracers that make it look like the beginning of Terminator 2. It's a neat effect but I wish they had stuck to the actual colors. Tracers rarely look so laser-green. \n\n* The film also uses CGI blurs for the cannon fire, which seems to move at speeds more appropriate for blackpowder cannon. I like the effect, it's just odd. \n\n* It's also using the now-standard (post-Saving Private Ryan) heavily desaturated look. It seems to have been a concerted effort by the filmmakers to out-nasty The Pacific, which is quite an achievement. War has never been this grey or full of guts. \n\n**OVERALL**\n\nIt's a pretty good movie, Wardaddy kills guys and doesn't afraid of anything.\n\nI really look forward to all you telling me how wrong I am about everything in the above.

        "text": "Hi r/badhistory, longtime reader, first time poster.  I don't have a ton of time but I wanted to throw this out there.\n\nThe name of the game today is the tri-monthly [\"biggest unsolved mysteries of _________\"] /r/AskReddit  post, and our guest today filling in the blank is none other than \"history\" herself.  We see the usual suspects pop up quickly to dominate the thread: Bronze Age Collapse/Sea Peoples, SETI \"Wow!\" Signal, this or that mysterious plague, Oak Island, Greek Fire, etc.\n\nBut then, out of absolutely nowhere, comes a [comment about how people still speculate about the disappearance of the Aztecs](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2yrukb/serious_reddit_what_are_some_of_the_big_events_in/cpceyl8).\n\nWe all know places like r/AskReddit and r/TIL can be [problematic](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2yoc5a/askreddit_asks_to_blow_the_mind_of_someone_from/) with their treatment of history, but never before have I seen a highly upvoted, top of the thread answer that is so egregiously faulty on such a basic level.  Sure, other high-level badhistory AskReddit posts may make sweeping generalizations, rely on faulty assumptions, or spout unsubstantiated \"facts\", but at least they're not fundamentally wrong on an elementary-school level.  I mean, Aztecs vs. Conquistadors/Montezuma vs. Cortez is really like middle-school level stuff.  Literally.  [I looked it up and in my state understanding of the key elements of Aztec history is a 6th grade social studies standard](http://www.cde.state.co.us/standardsandinstruction/socialstudies-6thgradestandardspdf).\n\nNow let me be fair.  The OP's post also includes the Maya, which is slightly more reasonable as a \"historical mystery\" but also flawed as I'll discuss in a minute.  That said, my issue isn't with the OP him/herself; we all have misunderstandings and make mistakes, even basic ones.  No, my issue is the fact that as of this writing, the comment has *over 3,600* upvotes.  At least 3,600 people upvoted the 16th century equivalent of \"nobody knows for sure what caused the decline of Nazi Germany\".\n\n[A valiant hero comes to try and save the day, but he's sitting at a lowly 300 upvotes](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2yrukb/serious_reddit_what_are_some_of_the_big_events_in/cpchfck).\n\nR5:\n\nI don't think the Aztec point really needs a massive explanation.  From 1519-1521, a Spaniard named Hernan Cortez, along with a sizable cohort of Native American allies, successfully toppled the Aztecs/Triple-Alliance, effectively ending the Aztec Empire and beginning the creation of the Spanish colonies in Mexico and Central America.  That's not to mention that the conquest itself was [pretty heavily documented](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_conquest_of_the_Aztec_Empire#Sources_for_the_history_of_the_conquest_of_Central_Mexico) by Cortez and others who fought with him, so there's not a whole lot to speculate on here, at least in a general sense.\n\nThe Maya bit from the OP, however, is a bit trickier.  While the famous \"Maya collapse\" in the 900s CE certainly is a favorite in pop culture, the idea of a Maya \"collapse\" has fallen pretty hard out of academia in much the same way the \"collapse\" of the Western Roman Empire has.  Firstly, it's extremely misleading to suggest that the \"entire Maya civilization\" collapsed, as [7 million of them still exist today](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_peoples).  Secondly, the \"collapse\" was only truly felt in a handful of areas in the Maya world, most notably the [Southern Lowlands](http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/maya/Maya-Southern-Lowlands.jpg).  I mean, [Tulum, one of the most popular Maya ruins in Mexico](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulum) hit its peak in the 13th century, hardly the mark of a \"dead\" civilization. [There's a lot of great info about the issue of a \"Maya collapse\" in this r/askhistorians thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2d2l89/historiography_of_the_infamous_maya_collapse/).\n\nAs to what caused some Maya centers to collapse in the 10th century, there actually is some speculation, but that doesn't mean we don't have a good idea of what actually did happen.  In a nutshell, Arthur Demarest argues that there were significant structural issues with Maya society, namely with the elites and their focus on ideology over pragmatism and their inability to adapt to changing environmental or social pressures.  Succession crises, constant demand for ceremonial warfare, flashy religious construction projects, and inter-elite rivalries were commonplace in high Maya society and it left many Maya city states ill-equipped to handle practical problems.  As things got worse, kings would need more warfare and fancy projects to maintain their standing with the people, often exacerbating the crisis until the city-state was abandoned, conquered, or destroyed.  (source: Demarest, Arthur. Ancient Maya: Rise and Fall of a Rainforest Civilization)\n\nMoral of the story: what happened to the Aztecs is (and should be) very well-understood and is remarkably well-documented; there is speculation involved with the Maya but that doesn't mean it's a historical \"mystery\"... oh, and also saying the Maya collapsed isn't really fair or accurate.",

        "text": "Long time reader, first time submitter!\n\n\nSo, Io9 goes full click bate with [this article about The 14 Most Loathsome Figures Of The Second World War](http://io9.com/the-14-most-loathsome-figures-of-the-second-world-war-1690778876).\n\n\n  As a historian of the Nazi period and WWII, I had some issues with this article related to some factual stuff but also with some major issues of creating an equivalency/mixing levels of historical responsibility of individuals.\n\n\n  Let's start with the minor stuff:\n\n  &gt;Austrian SS Leader Odilo Globočnik had a lead role in Operation Reinhard — the Nazi plan to exterminate European Jews in the General Government district of occupied Poland.\n\n  This - while technically correct - is worded deceptively. Aktion Reinhard as expressively stated in the USHMM's encyclopedia article [linked](http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005195) in the article was the Nazi leadership's plan to murder the Jews of the General Government - mainly Polish and/or Soviet nationals. Though European, the difference is important especially in respects to the Nazis' overall plan for the so-called final solution. Polish Jewry was to be the first population targeted in a systematic killing effort in camps (unlike the Soviet Union where the Einsatzgruppen had targeted Soviet Jewry in a mass shooting campaign). \n\n\nStarting on a small scale targeting only the Jewish inhabitants of the Lodz Ghetto, systematic killings started in the [Chelmno/Kulmhof camp] (http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005194) as early as December 1941 and eventually developed into Aktion Reinhard. The implication that the Reinhard Camps were intended as killing sites for European Jewry rather than for Polish Jewry specifically - albeit factually kinda correct - glosses over the very important nuance that Polish Jews were a priority target and reinforces a narrative common in European commemorative culture that focuses almost exclusively on Western European Jews while glossing over the plight of Eastern European Jewry in the Holocaust (see also: the almost exclusive focus on Anne Frank when there are just as relateable accounts of Eastern European Jews of the same age etc.)\n\n\n  &gt;Over the course of his tenure, over 1.5 million Jews were killed in the Treblinka, Sobibor, Belzec, and Majdanek death camps — camps that he himself helped to organize and supervise.\n\n\n  Globočnik was indeed in charge of Aktion Reinhard and indeed was responsible for the extermination camps operating over its course, however the Majdanek (or Lublin) camp was not one of the Aktion Reinhard camps as is clearly stated in the USHMM's encyclopedia article [linked](http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005195) in the article. The Majdanek camp was used for a brief period in 1943 as a killing site while the Belzec camp was not operational and also as a work camp site but it was expressively not under Globocnik's command.\n\n\n  The points made about Roatta and Mengele are in essence correct and so are to my knowledge the points made about Matsui and Tani, though one could make the point that Nanking is not exactly a World War II war crime, given that it took place before the war was a world war resp. happened before World War II started in the official - albeit arbitrary - timeline in 1939.\n\n  On to Harris and LeMay:\n\n  &gt;Whereas bombing campaigns against industrial and military targets yielded tangible results, historians have consistently shown that terror campaigns against civilians did very little to change the outcome of the war.\n\n  This is also correct. However, the argument could be made that neither Harris and LeMay were not or only insufficiently aware of the ineffectual nature or moral bombing. Don't get me wrong here, what Curtis and LeMay did was horrible and borders or crosses over right into war crime territory but the argument on the ineffectual nature of the moral bombing campaign proven by historians is an ex post argument assuming a level of knowledge of historical actors they might not necessarily have had and therefore dives into imo badhistory territory.\n\n\n  &gt;Oskar Dirlewanger (...) Over the course of his various tours, his unit was responsible for more atrocities than any other. In 1940, Heinrich Himmler put Dirlewanger in charge of a special Poacher's Brigade comprised of convicted criminals, all of them former hunters.\n\n  Dirlewanger's Unity did not consist exclusively of former hunters/poachers. [Aside of 250 poachers, the unit consisted of 1200 criminals and asocials from concentration camps, 200 SS-members against whom disciplinary actions had been taken and about 500 Russian auxiliaries.](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS-Sondereinheit_Dirlewanger)\n\n\nSimilarly, his unit was not responsible for more atrocities than any other. According to Heinz Höhne's Der Orden unter dem Totenkopf, p. 332 Einsatzgruppe A killed 249.420 Jews during their tours in the Soviet Union which tops Dirlewanger's 60.000 (numbers from Christian Ingrao: Les chasseurs noirs. La brigade Dirlewanger.)\n\n\n  &gt;Largely ignored by history, Hans Frank governed and terrorized Nazi-occupied Poland from 1939 to 1945.\n\n\n  Hans Frank is not largely ignored by history. Not only has he been represented in popular media such as the excellent film Judgement of Nuremberg but his son's book Der Vater (Niklas Frank) was a bestseller in Germany and there are around ten biographies for him in German alone according to the German national library, which is more than there are for example for Reinhard Heydrich. Also, the General Government has in recent years seen a surge of research, which is necessarily dealing with Frank. (From Dietmut Majer's Non-Germans under the Third Reich from 1981 to Martin Winstone's Dark Heart of Nazi Europe from Last Year).\n\n\n  &gt;Lavrentiy Beria was to Joseph Stalin what Heinrich Himmler was to Adolf Hitler — a psychotic, vicious, and callous right-hand man.\n\n  Leaving aside the in my opinion in some ways questionable comparison of Beria and Himmler - the SS serving a quite different role in Nazi Germany than the NKVD in the Soviet Union -, the assertion of being psychotic might fit Beria, going from the linked BBC information on him being a sexual predator, but Himmler was not psychotic. Of course there are people who make the assertion that his hatred of Jews displays a psychotic character but there is no historical evidence for Himmler suffering from a mental illness. Also, the idea that Nazi perpetrators were all mentally ill is bad history in as far it exterritorializes moral and judicial responsibility. The scary thing about the Nazis is that they were indeed not mentally ill but fully capable of distinguishing right from wrong.\n\n\n  These are the factual issues I saw with this article and some might say that these are nitpicky but even if that is true, I believe this article highlights a different issue:\n\n\nFirst of all, the stated purpose &gt;It was a war that featured no shortage of heinous individuals — these 14 being among the very worst. (...) Instead, I present to you a list of individuals (in no particular order) whose participation in the war was no less malign, but whose overzealousness, opportunism, and ideological fervor worked as force multipliers. Here are 14 heinous individuals who made World War II far more miserable than it needed to be.\n\n\nThis is the cracked school of history. Making World War II far more miserable than it needed to be is not a historical category. There is no point behind this aside from saying: Hey, look at how the axis and even some Allies were terrible! Asking the question What doe we know, when we know this? reveals that there is no historical surplus value in this article and that by completely leaving out any historical political, social etc. context all it does is create a listickle version of Great Men (or in this case Terrible Men) History a la Ranke.\n\n\n  Which leads to the next thing: By putting all these men on the same list, the article implies some sort of equivalency. It completely ignores the different levels of responsibility and individual latitude in shaping policies of terror and cruelty. To exemplify, Himmler and Dirlewanger were both terrible people and responsible for great crimes, however Himmler bears a different kind of responsibility than Dirlewanger because Dirlewanger was cruel in executing a policy set by Himmler. Himmler never killed someone personally but his ideological and political position and drive was crucial in shaping the so-called final solution. Putting them in the same category blurs these lines and that is bad history. Don't blur the lines. Don't be the Robin Thick of History.\n\n(I hope this submission is ok. As I said, it's my first. If there is a problem, I will edit, please let me know.)\n",

        "text": "...stupid /u/Turnshroud, making me write a post that I've been meaning to write all week but never got around to...\n\nI want to talk about the first line of [this post](http://i.imgur.com/gHWsIbV.png) (please don't ask where I found this), namely the idea that there was no such thing as a racially based genocide before modern times. This is actually a really complex question, and definitely a more interesting one than first meets the eye. Part of the problem is that it's very tempting to apply the modern definition of a genocide to events that happened in the past, but that's something that can't necessarily be done. It's equally tempting to apply our conceptions of race, but once again, I do want to at least try to not be presentist here. There's also the problem of defining \"modern,\" but considering the \"golden age\" of genocide - if ever you wanted a controversial line from me, there you go - is the 20th century, that's how I'm going to define it. Equally, it's in the 20th century that genocide as we conceive of it really becomes popular and becomes seen as the sort of thing that can - and, depending on how monstrous you are, should - be done. You're welcome to argue with me on this definition of \"modern\" - it's by no means a definition I'm certain of, but given that the person who made the post isn't terribly specific, I'm going to work with what I've got. \n\nAll that said, though, even with these caveats, I think there are genocides that took place before the \"modern\" era, and genocides that took place on racial grounds. The thing is, though, that it's debatable. I'm going to be interpreting events through my own particular lens and my own particular readings. You are more than welcome to argue with me. Heck, I'd love it if you did because frankly, I'm a bit bored and am looking for a distraction from what I'm supposed to be doing. So with that said, let's look at genocides.\n\nIt's important to establish from the outset what I'm referring to when I call something a \"genocide.\" I'm mostly going to be using the definition from the [1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide](https://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/adviser/pdf/osapg_analysis_framework.pdf) which defines a genocide as: \n\n&gt; any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical,\nracial or religious group, as such: killing members of the group; causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part1; imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; [and] forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.\n\nI say mostly because I also subscribe to the somewhat controversial idea of a \"cultural genocide,\" which is defined as:\n\n&gt; the systematic destruction of traditions, values, language, and other elements which make a one group of people distinct from other groups.\n\nIt's controversial because it's a lot harder to prove, and because it's the sort of thing that can sometimes look voluntary or which can be (and generally is) part and parcel with a genocide. However, it is also something that can be separate. The Japanese occupation of Korea and the subsequent destruction of Korean buildings and material heritage, as well as the suppression of the Korean language is a good example of cultural genocide. The treatment of Native Americans and forcing them to go to schools where their native languages and cultures would be wiped out, too, is an example of a cultural genocide. They're both instances where *people* aren't necessarily killed, but their way of life and their *identities* are exterminated.\n\nI bring up cultural genocide, first, because it's an interesting concept that I think needs more discussion, and second, because cultural genocides committed against Native Americans are absolutely pre-modern, racially based cultural genocides. We can see this through the fact that the stated intention was \"to educate &amp; colonize a people against their will,\" as stated by Hugh McKay in 1903, after the Indian schools had been established. Other statements about their purpose included describing them as \"aggressive assimilation\" and \"raising the child without the Indian.\"\n\nThe way the Indian schools functioned, too, shows that the purpose of them was to eliminate Native American cultures within a few generations. Children at the Canadian schools were forced to speak either English or French (depending on who was running the school) with severe punishments for those who spoke native languages. They were forced to adopt Canadian names and practice Christianity rather than any of their previous Native American spiritual rituals. Indeed, children could be severely beaten if they were caught doing \"Indian\" things, and several thousand children died in these schools, partly because of these beatings and abuse. Children were also forcibly removed from their homes and from their parents to attend residential schools, where they would have no contact with the family they'd left behind, or even - potentially - their siblings at the same school. This meant that there was no hope of them retaining their native languages or customs. When they eventually returned to their reservations, they found that they could not communicate and didn't belong, leading them to try and find a place in white Canadian society, where they still didn't belong. That intentional uprooting and destruction of a people and their culture is a cultural genocide, and its repercussions are still reverberating among the Native American communities in both Canada and the US (where Indian schools were also a thing). It also still has massive consequences in Australia, where treatment of the Australian Aborigines was even worse.\n\nThe difference between a cultural genocide and a natural assimilation is that intentionality and that forced nature of it. As an example, let's look at the difference between immigrants to the US in the late 1800s and early 1900s and compare it to Indian schools. In both instances, you have a case of the US government wanting people to adopt roughly the same language and culture, and you have prejudice against certain types of people. In the case of the Native Americans, though, this desire to see the same language and culture manifested itself through abduction and forced attendance at schools specifically designed to wipe out a culture. In, say, New York City, cultural and societal pressure caused assimilation. Rather than being forced, it was a choice most immigrants made, and it was by no means a complete detachment from one's previous culture, as Indian schools were. Rather, this gradual, voluntary assimilation allowed for maintaining one's old culture alongside a new one. What matters in a genocide is not scale or method, but intentionality.\n\nOf course, simply establishing that there was a cultural genocide (as I hope I've sufficiently done) doesn't necessarily establish that there was a *racially-based* cultural genocide. This is the problem with cultural genocides (well, beyond the obvious) - there doesn't have to be a different race, just as long as there are two distinct cultural groups. The persecution of Baha'is in Iran, for instance, is an example of something that's been called a cultural genocide even though it's all the same ethnic group. Determining whether or not a genocide or cultural genocide is \"racially-based\" ultimately means defining \"race\" and \"racism\" in a satisfactory way. And if ever you want to be consigned to social science hell, you can start by trying to define \"race.\"\n\nHere, the UN and its multitude of definitions fails me. Even though \"race\" is splattered across many of the foundational texts of modern human rights and genocide literature, the UN never actually states what it is. There's some research into it, sure, but it comes to the conclusion that this is really hard, and can we all just kind of agree that we know it when we see it? That's not satisfactory, though, especially considering how many genocides are between people who look kind of similar. The genocide in Rwanda, for instance, would likely be considered a genocide of people of one race by people of the same race to an outsider, but for those involved, it was decidedly more complicated. \n\nIn Rwanda, there are three major groups - Hutus, Tutsis, and Twa - with Hutus being the majority, Tutsis being a minority, and Twa being the no-one-remembers-you-exist-there-are-so-few-of-you minority. All would fall under the general racial category of \"black\" or \"African.\" From an outside perspective, they're all the same race, but with different ethnic groups. From the German and Belgian colonisers' perspectives, though, and then subsequently from the Rwandans' perspective, there were distinct races based on varying physical features. It's because of this internal idea of different races that we can look at the Rwandan genocide and call it a racial genocide. Certainly from an outside perspective, it's all black people, but for those committing the genocide, there were real and obvious racial differences. Now, obviously there were more factors going into the Rwandan genocide than \"that guy looks funny, let's get him,\" but my point here is to illustrate that race is really, really hard to define, and that what you or I might consider race might not be race to someone else, or vice versa. \n\nCoupled with the difficulty of defining race is the fact that \"race\" and \"racism\" as ideas are fairly modern. People have obviously been aware of the differences between people and the different origins of people for a long time - the fact that the Greeks referred to everyone who wasn't Greek as \"barbaroi\" kind of betrays the fact that they might have been a teensy bit aware that people came from other places, and might have been a tad bit miffed by that fact - but there is a difference between not liking foreigners and thinking they are a lesser or inherently different group of people. Most important in defining racism is this idea of some sort of inherently different nature that is hereditary and unalterable. This is a relatively new idea.\n\nIt's important, then, to establish when racism and race become ideas. There is a lot of argument about this. I'm not a sociologist, and I don't claim to be an expert on the definition of race, but I think my definition of viewing a people as different based on inherent, unalterable, and heritable characteristics is a decent enough definition of racism for a bad history post. When we look at the historical record, though, the first evidence we see of anything even remotely matching this definition comes from Spain during the Reconquista and the sanctioned anti-Semitism of the 16th century. What separates this from previous anti-Semitism and what makes it a distinctly racist anti-Semitism is the persecution of converted Jews. Rather than taking issue strictly with religion, this persecution of Christian Jews follows that idea that there is something inherently different, unalterable, and heritable about a specific group of people. Racism was born. \n\nRacism then increased and spread rapidly throughout Europe with the Renaissance and an increased exposure to people who looked different. When a 1667 Virginia law argued that African slaves that had converted to Christianity could still be enslaved because they had heathen ancestors, you have another example of racism. This increased, separated more and more from religion and into what was then considered science, and became the institutionalised nonsense we see throughout the world today. \n\nBut you see the problem. Race and racism are fairly modern concepts. Looking at people as different isn't new, but race is. When deciding whether or not a genocide is \"racially-based,\" then, we have to decide what definition we're going to use. Is it fair to call an ethnic genocide committed in the 1100s a \"racially-based\" genocide even though they had no notion of the concept of race as we understand it? Indeed, can you call something that happened well before \"genocide\" was even an understood concept a genocide?\n\nThis is where my arguments get problematic. Despite the fact that race is a relatively new concept and genocide moreso, I still think there are events that occurred throughout history - and certainly before the 20th century - that can be viewed as racially-based genocides. Despite the lack of a concept of \"race,\" there are events that we can look at and say \"this group of people died because they were associated with a group of people that someone didn't like.\" \n\nA quick note, though, because I'm aware how this can potentially go wrong. As I've previously stated, there is a distinct difference between a massacre and a genocide. A massacre is just killing tons of people. There are many, many massacres throughout history, and the vast majority of them are not genocides or part of a genocide. A genocide requires an intention to wipe out a group of people based on some inherent characteristic. It's why we can call the Holocaust a genocide, but not the Battle of Britain. Lots of people died in both, but one was a clear attempt to completely annihilate a group of people while the other was done to achieve a political end, but with no real notion of the inherent difference of the group being killed. There was an intention to kill the British, sure, but not because they were British. They were killed because they were in the way of European domination.\n\nSo all of that established, surely I have an example of a genocide that was racially based that wasn't modern. Well, it just so happens I have two that I feel are really good ones, but they're by no means the only ones. If you want more examples - and if you want the examples that some scholars have brought up, but which I reject - just ask. I'm confident there are enough to demonstrate that the post I linked is bad history.\n\nThe first one I want to bring up is the *izwekufa*, which is part of the Mfecane. The *izwekufa* can perhaps best be summarised as Shaka's attempts - sometimes successful - to wipe out various ethnic groups based on their ethnic identity. As the Zulus expanded and consolidated into a united kingdom, they encountered various other groups with whom they had previously warred, traded, done the hokey pokey, whatever. There were clear distinctions between groups, but also relationships. These clear distinctions manifested themselves partly in abuse towards those who were not part of the group. As Shaka grew up in exile, for instance, he was abused by members of the groups that harboured him partly because of his status as an exile, but also because he was not a member of the group. He was different, and treated poorly because of it. The result of this, though, was that when Shaka became king of the Zulus, he exacted his revenge by wiping out entire groups, some of which had offended him, and some of which had not. This began around 1810 with the extermination of the Mthethwa and Langa. While I don't have any reports from Shaka himself about why he exterminated the Mthethwa and Langa, it is abundantly clear that both revenge and a desire to establish his own legitimacy on the backs of other groups were motivations. There is a clear intention to utterly destroy a group of people whom Shaka considered different - there is a genocide. This policy of annihilation would continue across groups, causing many to flee Zulu lands in the Mfecane. \n\nNow, the argument that could be made is that this isn't racially based. As I said, Shaka's initial exterminations were based on personal revenge and establishment of legitimacy. Even later genocides, such as the extermination of the Qwabe, could be seen as not being racially based, but once again, responses to personal insult. However, it's important to consider Zulu views of other groups. Within the Zulu worldview, the conquered and subordinate were seen as inherently inferior to the conqueror. There were distinctions between the Zulus and the groups they conquered, and they saw this distinction as inherent to each group. Zulus were naturally superior because they were conquerors, and because they were conquerors, they were naturally superior, or so Zulu logic goes. This, coupled with the fact that not all of Shaka's genocides were based on personal disagreements, suggests to me that there was a racial element to each of these genocides. The fact, too, that the exterminations weren't limited in their scope to men or threats means that there was a desire to punish and exterminate the people as a group. It's a clear case of a racially-based genocide that takes place before modern times.\n\nThere's another example I'd like to look at, one that was much larger and half a century earlier. In 1757, the Qianlong Emperor of the Manchu Qing dynasty ordered the extermination of the Dzungar in response to their unwillingness to cease to be a united entity. The Emperor ordered that the Dzungar be destroyed completely and utterly, and that their very existence be wiped out. Within a year, almost 80% of the Dzungar population (480 000 people) had been killed with the remaining Dzungar enslaved and moved into Han Chinese lands. The genocide was so effective that Dzungaria was able to be resettled with people the Emperor liked, and the Dzungar were effectively eliminated as a people. \n\nOnce again, two questions must be asked - is it valid to call this a genocide, and if so, is it a racially based one? For me, the question of genocide is a clear one. People were sent in to wipe out other people completely and totally. There was a clear intention to destroy people because they belonged to a particular group. That is a genocide. I'd also argue that it was racially based in much the same way that the Rwandan genocide was racially based. In both instances, you have a group of people who see the other group as different, and kill them because of that difference. The fact that the Dzungar were removed from the homeland and had their cultures stripped from them only reinforces the idea that there was a racial element to this genocide. It demonstrates that there was a clear notion of the difference, and a thorough desire to see a people gone because of that difference.\n\nThere are more examples to bring up, but I do think it's always very important to consider the problems with discussions like this one. It can be very difficult to look at history and assign the moniker of \"genocide\" and of \"race.\" Genocide, after all, requires a clear motivation and intent, something which can't always be found in the historical record. \"Race\" depends on how people relate to each other, which is once again, something that can be extremely difficult to pinpoint in the historical record. Discussing pre-modern genocide is an exercise fraught with difficulty, especially since the term \"genocide\" comes with so much baggage and so many problems. It's not a term to be thrown around lightly. However, I hope that the two examples and the tons of discussion is enough to demonstrate that there were, in fact, racially-based genocides before the modern era. I certainly think there were.\n\nSources!\n\n*Race, Massacre, and Genocide: An Excercise in Definitions* by Eric Carlton, published in the International Journal of Sociology and Social Policy.

They didn't just say \"Hey, everyone, let's just charge machineguns endlessly!\"  They didn't have many options available to them, for one--armor was in its infancy, so how are you going to break a static position?  Artillery barrages can only do so much, because just digging a few feet deeper will protect you from anything that isn't a spot-on hit (which is kinda hard to do along the gun-target line).  A later comment talks about creeping barrages, but manages to neglect quite a lot of the realities of the war, and then says that WWI generals were stupid, just not quite as stupid as is commonly thought.  Creeping barrages did do a decent enough job of keeping the first line suppressed, but defense in depth is hard to destroy or suppress, especially once you've begun to secure an area.  \n\nThen we have idiocy about artillery being inaccurate, and that accuracy in artillery isn't important as well.  Good fucking god, no.  Artillery is and was highly accurate, it's just not effective against entrenched enemies unless you have reliable MT and VT fuzes (which were not fully in production during WWI) because they can just dig deeper, making a direct hit harder and less damaging.  \n\nWe have further comments saying that the officers knew what would break the lines, but decided that initiative would be improper, so they discarded the idea entirely.  Because, you know, the British, Germans, and French didn't heavily employ soldiers like snipers, forward observers, and sappers whose jobs by very nature require a high degree of personal initiative.  \n\nSigh.

Unfortunately, he seems to be wearing some unknown form of body armor. I think it is supposed to be brigandine, but brigandine wasn't used in this time period. It also suffers from the same problem as the armor of the chap from Wessex because there are gaps between the plates. What good is a plate sewn into your shirt gonna do if the area around it is completely unarmored. If a blow were to hit one of the plates it will probably just glance off and go in between the plates anyway.\n\nAlso, where the fuck is the mail?

The \"federal zone,\" by contrast, was extremely small.

Now while many of the delegates at the convention bristled strongly at anything remotely strengthening the federal government, I think we'd be hard pressed to find evidence that says the government wasn't made stronger by the Constitution. But I think I'm getting sidetracked, here. What was my point?\n\nOh yeah: the creation of a federal district of 10 miles square wasn't done to keep the federal government weak. If anything, it made the federal government stronger.\n\n&gt; To exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten Miles square) as may, by Cession of particular States, and the Acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of the Government of the United States, and to exercise like Authority over all Places purchased by the Consent of the Legislature of the State in which the Same shall be, for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, dock-Yards, and other needful Buildings\n\nArticle 1, Section 8. After the [Pennsylvania Mutiny](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_Mutiny_of_1783) (during which local politics prevented the federal government from being protected from an angry mob of unpaid Revolutionary War vets) the delegates realized that the federal government needed the authority and ability to protect itself and remain free from the trappings of more local politics. So the Constitution provides for the cessation of land *from the States* for the creation of a federal district. If even by a minute scale, this strengthens the federal government. If there were no federal district, the federal government would be beholden to the state laws and politics of whatever state its seat was in. \n\nTL;DR: DC wasn't created to keep the federal government weak. It was to keep it free from state politics/jurisdiction, which if anything makes it more powerful.\n\nAs a side note, [our federal government was the first to benefit from Section 8 housing](http://media.giphy.com/media/zSYAKYisixK4U/giphy.gif).\n",

        "text": "Piero Scaruffi is an Italian physicist who has an interest an music while I have larger issues all around with his ideas of music as a whole and some of his critiques he’s overall a semi respectable voice when it comes to music critique however I want to focus on something that bothered me greatly as a huge jazz fan his history of jazz especially the early jazz. It’s not so much he was wrong like a lot history the key is in how you interpret it. \n\nhttp://www.scaruffi.com/history/jazz1.html\n\n&gt;At the turn of the century, the streets of New Orleans were awash in blues music, ragtime and the native brass-band fanfares. The latter, used both in the Mardi Gras parades and in funerals, boasted a vast repertory of styles, from military marches to \"rags\" (not necessarily related to Scott Joplin's ragtime music). The Excelsior Brass Band, formed in 1880, raised the Creole drummer John Robichaux and the Creole clarinetist Alphonse Picou. The Onward Brass Band, formed around 1884, featured Creole cornet player Manuel Perez. Notably missing from this mix was religious music, that played a lesser role in the birth and development of jazz music. Also missing was white popular music, that would define the \"commercial\" format of jazz music, but not its core technical characteristics.\n\nSpot on for the most part however religious music still played a huge part in the early development of jazz. New Orleans might have been the largest hub for Catholicism in the entire US at the time due to its rich French heritage. One of the most famous brass band songs ‘When the Saints Go Marching In’ originated in New Orleans which discredits it completely. In fact I would argue that the brass bands at the time did overlap hugely with religious music. When someone died in New Orleans at the turn of the century brass bands did show up to pay respect. Yes there were more secular tunes but to down play the religious figure is absurd and silly. A minor issue no problem but here’s the huge problem where Scaruffi opens a can of absurdity. \n\n&gt;Unlike blues music, that was exclusively performed by blacks, jazz music was as inter-racial as the melting pot of New Orleans. Blacks were not the only ones who played jazz. Jazz groups were formed by Italians, Creoles and all sorts of European immigrants. The \"African\" roots of the music may or may not have been obvious to the practitioners, but clearly it did not stop them from adopting it. \n\n\nYes white musicians were definitely around the early days of jazz. There is no denying that at all. Much respect to very early interracial bands however to totally dismiss as not African music or rather not African American music is downright offensive and cultural appropriation. The origins of jazz go far beyond the turn of the century in New Orleans.  You can trace it back before the Louisiana Purchase to the 18th century. This place was known as Congo Square. Almost every Sunday the slaves would be free to go about there and set up whatever and dance, play music and have markets. It was almost like a weekly African carnival. I see this and many historians see this as the first precursor to jazz and broader African American music.  This is a common theme that will show up again as you’ll see later on. \n\n&gt;Chicago soon became a middleground of sorts. The soul of the city's black music was Joe Jordan, and the main mentors were the clubs of the \"Black Belt\", such as the \"Pekin Theatre\". Tony Jackson's Pretty Baby (1915) was the first big hit.\n\n\nTony Jackson is a huge figure in early jazz and quite frankly under looked. How can I describe Tony Jackson? I don’t know how other than the cliché “A man ahead of his time” but in the truest sense.  Even Jelly Roll Morton thought idolized him and thought he was a better pianist than him. That’s coming from one of the hugest egos in 20th century music (but in an adoring way). I can’t stress him enough.  He grew up rather poor but was able to make a rudimentary harpsichord at the age of 10. In his prime and 1915 was well past his prime he was able to play everything from French Opera to the latest ragtime tunes to everything in between. People would here in play from four in the morning to well in the afternoon on all types of substances in a small room in the back of a Honkey Tonk or something of that nature not unlike a rave or underground club today. He was already a master at the age of 15 and to top it off he was openly gay or rather a “fairy” for the term at the time.  An openly gay African American inspiring many New Orleans pianists to play what would then become jazz. Definitely an important figure. \n\n&gt;Black musicians were not recorded partly because of racial discrimination but partly also because they were much more jealous of their style: their aim was to hide their sound from the competition, not to spread it all over the nation.\n\n\nNo only one musician in particularly got worried about people stealing his music not necessarily hiding the sound of jazz as he mentions in the next paragraph. Freddie Keppard. Recording music was still a huge novelty and was not understood fully by a lot of musicians. I don’t take blame from Keppard at all and it’s wrong to make an absolute statement like that about African musicians at the time. \n\n&gt;Jazz music had been, ultimately, the product of New Orleans' melting pot, and, in general, of the black culture of the southern states. The big difference between jazz and blues (or the spiritual or the work song) was that jazz was indeed an \"American\" phenomenon, not an \"African\" one. The roots of jazz music were in the South of the USA, not in West Africa. There was little relationship between the instruments of jazz and the original instruments of the West African slaves. The instruments of jazz came from the European brass bands. Quite simply, jazz was the product of blacks who had not been slaves, and, in most cases, couldn't even remember the ancestors who originally came from Africa: they were, quite simply, USA citizens (albeit second-class ones). Most blacks were in fact even more \"American\" than many of the European immigrants who were crossing the Atlantic by the millions in the years before and after World War I. Of course, the condition of blacks in the USA was one of great inferiority. However, jazz was the product of urban blacks from New Orleans, and then Chicago and then New York: the blacks who lived the least segregated life in the USA.\n\nHe’s right about two key things.  About African Americans being more “American” than many European immigrants at the time and jazz is a product of urban African Americans at the time that lived the least segregated life. It’s true though they didn’t necessarily used the same instruments as they used in Congo Square however there is still a lineage of sorts between jazz and Congo Square. I don’t know if I would call jazz African music myself admittedly however I have no qualms whatsoever and it needs to be recognized not just for the sake of justice and righteousness but to be historically accurate a well calling it African American music plain and simple. African American is indeed a distinct identity over African. \n\n&gt; In fact, most jazz musicians were striving to get accepted and integrated in the USA society. They wanted to be like white people. They de facto repudiated the culture of their ancestors and were eager to adopt the culture of the whites.\n\n\nThis is downright offensive and borderline racist. Yes they wanted to improve their lives through the use of “white technology” and wanted to be treated equals but that didn’t imply they wanted to be exactly like the whites at the time.  Easily the worst part of this article. \n\n&gt;All in all, the view that jazz was \"African\" was a racist view. White intellectuals claimed that jazz was \"African\" simply because the ancestors of black musicians had come from Africa. But no white intellectual claimed that country music was British. \n\n\nNo music historian or jazz historian worth their salt would call jazz music African however as I’ve said before any historian would have no problem calling jazz African American music.  He goes on to provide more and more fallacious examples that tries to explain why it isn’t African American music. I’m not even going to bother with it as it’s absolutely absurd and rather laughable but I will say this…yes it’s not their ancestral technology but who the hell cares? They still brought a lot of their ancestral ideals most notably the syncopation. It doesn’t matter what technology was the means! \n\nUltimately I think it’s a real tragedy that he downplayed the African American identity greatly because much of the history is good history. It goes to show that you can have great history yet have a very wrong interpretation of it and be ultimately wrong on it. I would go as far as cultural appropriation even as I’ve said earlier. Under crediting is a huge crime of history and needs to be exposed. Jazz is one of my passions and I can go in greater detail if need be so I hope I did a great job for my first post.\n",

A pirate famous for his particularly brutal career in real life. In the show, he kidnaps the daughter of the Governor of the Carolinas, then promptly proceeds to go to Nassau, piss everyone off, and get himself killed by Charles Vane. The thing is, Charles Vane was dead before Ned Low even became a pirate, much less a captain. Vane was captured in 1719 and executed in 1721, while Low didn't become a pirate captain until 1722. \n\nComing back to the whole \"Governor of the Carolinas\" thing, the show claims that the current governor is one Peter Ashe. However, neither North or South Carolina ever had a governor by the name of Ashe. Additionally, the show is supposed to be set in 1715. At that time, North and South Carolina were separate colonies and would not have had a single governor. Unless they are talking about the Carolina Islands in the South Pacific, which would be even crazier, as those were claimed by the Spanish and not directly controlled by Europeans until the 19th century.

This type of Victorian Era, White-Man's-Burden nonsense is still alive and well in the 21st century? Fortunately enough, I suppose, it did get bombarded with criticism over in the original thread.\n\nStill, *really*?\n\nFirst, a little bit of information about these types of maps in general. There are two extremes with regards to geographical and historical ignorance in drawing borders. On the one hand, you have cartographers who completely ignore all historical context, who in merging nations decide that African borders decided upon by European powers are somehow an accurate representation of different cultures, and will often create completely arbitrary boundaries based on seemingly little more than aesthetic. On the other hand, you have those who give historical boundaries *too* much relevance in a modern context, and believe that all of the countries that once constituted the Roman Empire will suddenly merge back together overnight because, well, they had in the past.\n\nThis map manages to reach both levels of ignorance.\n\nLet's start by getting nitpicky:\n\n* Several Pacific islands are not colored in at all. (OP's response to this: \"I do not know enough about them. I wouldn't have felt right adding them. I would have pulled it entirely out of my ass.\" (Yet he apparently feels fine pulling the rest of the map out of his ass.))\n\n* Indonesia is not a part of its own civilization. Southeast Asia, however, is.\n\n* Papua New Guinea is African now. Hell, if all tribal cultures are the same, let's just lump in Greenland while we're at it.\n\n* The Philippines are Latino, a distinction that bypasses culture altogether and is apparently based on little more than the dominance of Catholicism in the region.\n\n* Japan, Mongolia, Korea, and China all being part of the same \"civilization.\" Just because OP most likely can't tell Asians apart doesn't give him a free pass to completely ignore 5,000 years of separated cultural development and decide that Ulaanbaatar is the same as Tokyo. Culturally speaking, all four nations are far more distinguishable than, say, Romania and Russia, yet somehow \"Eurasian\" cultures have been surgically removed from Western civilization altogether.\n\n* Despite being 75% Buddhist, Bhutan is still part of the \"Enlightened Hindu\" civilization.\n\n* Israel is now an \"Enlightened Muslim\" country. Even with Palestine separated from it. I don't think I need to R5 this, but in case I do: Israel is neither [religiously](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Israel) nor [culturally](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Israel) Islamic.\n\n* Armenia, despite a Muslim population of [1,000 people](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Armenia#Islam), also falls under the category of \"Enlightened Muslim.\" The whole category is a mess.\n\n* The distinction between the Sunni Civilization and Shia Civilization, too, seems to completely ignore all demographical and historical background and instead insists on having a neat little line dividing the entire Middle East in half. Problem solved, everybody!\n\n* As usual, sub-Saharan Africa is generalized into one homogenous group. Isn't it funny how cultural and religious divides always seem matter in Europe, but not in Africa?\n\n* But wait! He didn't just group all of Africa into one category, South Africa is enlightened because... Apartheid? I have no clue. But OP provides an unintentionally hilarious distinction:\n&gt;African Civilization. Horrid human rights record. Old tribal beliefs still rampant (if you eat pygmies, you may be healed). Conspiracy theories and new tribal-esque ideas spread quickly (if you rape a virgin, you are cured of aids; Ebola is being spread by American witch doctors).\n&gt;Enlightened African. Better human rights record. Moving towards Western or at least Eurasian civilization. Tribal ideas still around, just not as widespread.\n\nOverall, there's just too much bad history in this map (and in OP's replies) to fit into one post. I'll admit that the commenters in the linked thread have already done most of the work for me. /u/PapaFranzBoas provides an excellent criticism of the map in general:\n\n&gt;Hm. Interesting. As a cultural anthropologist, I would be reluctant to use the word \"enlightened\". Especially in terms of referencing South Africa. Your reference with the \"Enlightened Muslim\" appears to suggest the label because of some contact between European societies. Which I guess is why you apply it to South Africa. It comes across as ethnocentric and valuing Western Culture as opposed to valuing diversity and freedom within the local culture. When looked at within South Africa, it makes it sound as if the Europeans did the right thing in bringing colonialism and bringing apartheid. In the end, it can appear that Western Civilization and western style rights are the end goal or chief point of human civilization. Note, that I am not saying that Western style rights are bad.\n**One of the difficulties in making such a map, is broad sweeping generalizations, which can unfortunately miss a lot of the hybridic complexities and nuances in each country. Going by how they act can unfortunately give a poor picture of a nation because of colonialism/globalization/minority-majority.**\nNot sure where you are in your studies and you maybe already read these, but I would look through some works on critical theory as an overview. Especially in terms of Postcolonial theory. I think it would change your map quite a bit.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't have been surprised to see shit like this from a hundred years ago, but it's mind-boggling to witness how anybody could make generalizations as sweeping as this gentleman in 2015. More than anything, he makes the mistake of linearizing development, with all \"western\" beliefs being inherently more developed.\n\nAnd for what it's worth, I've never seen one of these \"civilization\" maps that I've agreed with. We have enough problems with our current borders, and to the belief that we could solve everything by arranging nations into arbitrary groups is, well... ignorant, to say the least.\n\nAnyways, I hope this is relevant enough to historical matters to belong here, and I hope that I have provided enough context as to why. But, then again, the vast majority of the problems in the map are immediately obvious.",

Wait. Nope the \"source\" he links actually says\n\n&gt;He claims that Moses of the Bible is no other than King Akhenaten who ruled Egypt for 17 years in the mid-14th century BC.\n\nWe're pretty sure he wasn't Moses\n\n&gt;Ramses wasn't a pharaoh\n\n1. Ramesses was a Pharaoh. In fact there were quite a few of them. The most famous is Ramesses II.\n\n2. While Ramesses II is one of the popular candidates for the Pharaoh from Exodus, hence appears in most films based on it, that Pharaoh is never named anyway and there is no evidence for it (or the events happening).\n\n&gt;Most of the praise we give to (their) religion for giving us morals should actually be directed towards Hammurabi (1810 - 1750 BC) the sixth Amorite king of Babylon and also the first king of the Babylonian Empire. Hammurabi is best known for the creation of the new code of Babylonian law: the Code of Hammurabi, probably the first written lawbook in the world.\n\nWell for a start, morals didn't just pop up when Hammurabi wrote his law book. Also it was probably not the first law book, in fact there are earlier collections of laws from around the same region, such as the Code of Ur-Nammu.\n\n**Catholicism**\n\n&gt;This religion was completed under emperor Constantine. It has Christianity as a base, but was merged with European indigenous religions to create a religion suitable for everyone in his empire\n\nYes Constantine legalised Christianity, but he didn't make it the religion of the empire, that was Theodosius I\n\n&gt;Most of the Catholic holidays are celebrated on dates which were originally designated to holidays of those indigenous religions\n\nWhile they did take traditions from these other holidays, there are reasons for the dates that many of the Christian holidays are on, not necessarily because of the holidays of other religions\n\nExample\n\n&gt;It is known for celebrating Jesus’ birthday in December, a consequence of merging Christianity with non-Christian events, in this case the Winter Solstice\n\nWrong, the date for Christmas came about because in the second and third centuries Christians were trying to add up when Christ was born, and it was a common belief that really important individuals often died on the day of their conception. Considering Jesus is held to have died around the Jewish celebration of Passover, early Christians dated the death of Christ to March 25 (or sometimes April 6), and the Feast of the Annunciation is still celebrated on this date. Hence 9 months after gave them the date. The winter solstice is the basis for the dating in non-Christian and Christian winter holidays, because Passover is fixed in relation to the Spring Equinox, not because of pagan traditions.\n\n&gt;Constantine also contributed to Catholicism by proposing the Idea of the Trinity\n\nWhat? The idea of the Trinity came before Constantine. There are references to it from before Constantine, for example from Tertullian.\n\nOh, and the greatest part of all\n\n&gt;There was science prior to religion and there will be after. Religion was formed out of not having the knowledge of the universe as we have now, so we mostly guessed. The problem occurred when they learned that knowledge equals power. This brings us to...\n\nI just want to take it at face value at first, considering he lists the Egyptian Religions, and mentions the Mesopotamian ones when exactly does he mean science occurring before religion?. And if Science will only happen after religion, does that mean none of the science done ever is real?\n\nAlso, I'll just leave the list of religious scientists here\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/bad_religion/comments/2qw2r2/religious_scientist_thread_mention_religious/\n\nI've just selected various parts that are wrong and that I know more about.

Those of you who follow recent headlines will be aware of the highly sensational stories coming out of eastern Honduras. (If you're not, see [this NatGeo article](http://news-beta.nationalgeographic.com/2015/03/150302-honduras-lost-city-monkey-god-maya-ancient-archaeology/).) Those of you who follow archaeological news stories more closely have also likely seen [this highly passive-aggressive rebuttal by Dr. Rosemary Joyce.](http://blogs.berkeley.edu/2015/03/03/theres-a-real-archaeological-surprise-in-honduras/) While most laypeople have been swept up in the sensationalism of the La Ciudad Blanca “discovery” (whatever that means), the academic community has largely rallied behind Rosemary Joyce in bashing the story as over-hyped. There's a lot going on here, and I want to have a discussion about it because I feel like a lot of people on one side or the other are walking away with an incorrect impression about what's happening. As a fair warning: I have a dog in this fight. Although I am not personally involved in the La Ciudad Blanca project, I work with several archaeologists that are. And since my masters thesis is on LiDAR mapping, I'm familiar with the kinds of data that the project is using. \n\n**Why the La Ciudad Blanca Story is Over-Hyped**\n\nIt's important to remember that the project which has organized the La Ciudad Blanca work is not an academic research project. It's organized by a documentary film maker, Steve Elkins. The project is funded by private money, and the goal is to create a documentary film which will subsequently earn money. There are academic archaeologists on the team, but they are working as consultants and have little control on what makes it into the popular press. Because of the profit-oriented goals of this project, there's a good deal of incentive to promote it in a sensational way. Headlines speak of “lost cities” in the rain forest, and make it sound like these discoveries are happening in a complete academic vacuum. \n\nIn the ~~early 20th century,~~ 19th century, a pair of adventurers named John Loyd Stephens and Frederick Catherwood (one a travel writer and the other an artist) launched some explorations of the Petén region of Guatemala. They subsequently stumbled upon a series of extravagant ruins which we now know to be the ancient cities of the Classic Maya. Stephens and Catherwood published their “discovery” of “lost cities” in American and European popular press, complete with detailed descriptions of their expedition and [colorful illustrations of the ruins](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/TulumCatherwood1844.jpg/450px-TulumCatherwood1844.jpg). The apparent mystery of these ruins captured popular imagination, and all sorts of fanciful explanations were invented to explain them. People suggested they were built by some lost race, or the lost tribes of Israel, or pretty much anybody other than the indigenous people who lived in the region today.\n\nOf course, with our current nuanced post-colonial view of the world, archaeologists recognize that this characterization was problematic. For one, these cities were never really “lost.” Spanish colonial sources repeatedly described the existence of large cities in Mesoamerica. The *Books of Chilam Balaam* even described the existence of Classic Maya ruins in that region. During the 19th century, colonial-minded historians dismissed these accounts as fanciful. Secondly, natives in the region knew about the existence of these places even in the early 20th century. The discoveries of Stephens and Catherwood weren't really discoveries, they were more like re-discoveries. They brought knowledge of the existence of Maya cities to the modern Western world, but didn't reveal anything that wasn't already known by *somebody*.\n\nThe parallels between the La Ciudad Blanca press coverage and the expeditions of Stephens and Catherwood are obvious to anybody familiar with both stories. In both cases, the cliché idea of the exotic 'Lost City in the Jungle' is used to excite the popular audience and draw attention to the topic. In both cases, there was already some knowledge of these cultures, and Joyce cited the work of [Chris Begley](http://www.asociaciontikal.com/pdf/04-01%20-%20Begley%20-%20en%20PDF.pdf) on sites in the region as a prime example. Joyce has correctly pointed out that existing research in the area (which is highly underdeveloped compared to adjacent regions) was effectively ignored when the documentary filmmakers first released their press statement about the find. They played on the myths of the “Lost City” of La Ciudad Blanca and ignored the fact that several of the sites identified in the LiDAR map had already been identified. Although the filmmakers later brought on archaeological consultants, by that point the narrative they had first published had become widespread. Rather than correct their earlier errors, they doubled down and stuck with the sensational story they had already produced. Joyce faults them for this, and I can't blame her. Although I would once again point out that as the goal of the filmmakers is to sell the film, their decision to sensationalize the story is understandable. \n\n**The Actual Scientific Value of the La Ciudad Blanca “Discovery”**\n\nDespite Joyce's valid misgivings about the way this data has been presented in the popular press, she has committed a serious error in her critiques. She has assumed that the story is *all* hype, and contributes nothing of value to our understanding of the region's archaeology. This is patently false. The reason she assumes this is because, I believe, she does not actually understand what LiDAR is and the power that this kind of data can have. To prove that I'm not attacking a straw man, I would like to quote an [earlier blog post she made on the same topic](http://blogs.berkeley.edu/2012/06/07/good-science-big-hype-bad-archaeology/).\n\n&gt;Beyond the specific issues I have with the Ciudad Blanca folktale being used to over-promote a spectacle that ignores the actual research already completed, the way that the LiDAR project is described is fundamentally misleading... \n\n&gt;[Quotes article saying LiDAR is faster and cheaper than traditional survey. ] \n\n&gt;“Faster and cheaper”? I beg to differ. LiDAR can produce images of landscapes faster than people walking the same area, and with more detail. But that is not good archaeology, because all it produces is a discovery– not knowledge.\n\n&gt;If it’s a competition, then I will bet my money on people doing ground survey. And I will be betting less money: LiDAR is expensive. And I question the value you get for the money it costs.\n\nFor those of you who are not familiar, LiDAR (short for Light Detection and Ranging) is an active remote sensing technique that involves using a laser rangefinder to fire short laser pulses at a target. The time it takes for the laser to return to the sensor after being reflected off of its target gives a fairly accurate measurement of distance. When combined with a GPS, you can identify the exact position of a target with sub-meter accuracy. For use in survey, the LiDAR machine is mounted on an aircraft which flies in a zig-zag pattern over a stretch of landscape, taking thousands of points per second. In a forested region like the Mosquitia rain forest, the majority of these points will reflect off of the canopy. But given the sheer number of points that are taken, some, by chance, will penetrate between the leaves and reflect off of the ground surface. The resulting data set is stored in a point cloud which can be viewed in three dimensions using a variety of computer programs. It's a relatively straightforward process to remove the canopy “layer” from this image, allowing you to get a highly accurate, high resolution, three-dimensional image of the ground surface beneath the canopy. For the purposes of subsequent analysis, this point cloud is usually converted into a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). A DEM is a raster image (typically a TIF image), but each pixel, rather than recording color value, records elevation. (If you've ever played minecraft, think of it like that: each pixel represents a stack of blocks with the value of how high the blocks are.) \n\nIt is currently not physically possible to produce a map as accurate and precise as a LiDAR generated DEM through any other mapping technique. Currently, the “Gold Standard” in archaeological mapping uses a Total Station. (You know, [these things](http://www.accidentscience.com/total1.jpg) that you sometimes see highway engineers playing with on the side of a road.) A Total Station is functionally similar to LiDAR, in that it combines a laser rangefinder and a theodolite to measure distance and position. One person operates the total station and a second person carries a prism on a rod that looks like a wizard's staff. The person with the prism places the staff vertically on the ground after measuring the length of the rod and the height of the total station instrument. The operator of the total station then aims the device at the prism and takes a measurement, at which point the person with the staff then walks over and puts the staff somewhere else and takes a new point.\n\nTotal Station mapping (and all other traditional mapping techniques) introduce compounding error. When you set the total station up, you first have to establish its exact position using a GPS. GPS systems available to consumers are accurate to within a few meters, which is not accurate enough for scientific analysis. What archaeologists typically do is run the GPS for several minutes to take many different GPS points. By averaging these points together, you can approximate the exact position of the device, but you're still lucky if it's within a meter of its actual position. You then have to clear any surrounding vegetation to establish a direct line of sight to the rod. There's a limit to how far you can go in a forested area; it's inevitable that eventually the rod will be too far away to be visible by the total station. If you want to extend your map, you then have to take a new point (datum) with the total station, triangulate it with other established data, and them move the total station to the new datum. The problem is, total stations add error. It varies depending on the instrument and how far away the point is, and how still the person holding the rod is, but it can be up to a meter. Every time you move the total station, you *add* the error of the total station's measurement to the original error of the GPS point you started with. By the time you finish a map of a medium-sized site, you can have up to tens of meters of error in your map. \n\nA LiDAR map, by contrast, is accurate to within a meter for *each pixel in the image*. Furthermore, while traditional maps are limited in resolution to the number of points the total station operator is willing and able to take, current LiDAR generated DEMs have a resolution of up to 25cm per pixel. This means that for a large stone building (like a pyramid), you can effectively have one pixel per brick in the building. When you multiply this over an area of hundreds of square kilometers, it really is no contest in how it compares to traditional mapping techniques.\n\nBut the real value of LiDAR mapping comes with computer modeling. A LiDAR-generated DEM doesn't record the information visually, but as a series of measurements. Archaeologists who compare the technique to traditional mapping often fail to understand this. In order for a human observer to visually interpret a LiDAR image, the data has to be transformed in some way to present it visually. Computers, by contrast, are capable of analyzing the data directly and quantitatively. Over the last few decades, ecologists, geologists, and other scientists have created a series of computer algorithms that allow them to model various aspects of the landscape. You can, for example, run an algorithm that identifies and highlights river channels in a landscape. You can detect the existence of natural and artificial reservoirs, you can highlight areas of slope steeper than a given value, or determine what the path of least cost travel between two points is. Since LiDAR lets you map areas beneath the canopy, you can even use the data to determine, for example, if a given feature on the landscape would have been visible from the top of a pyramid before the forest grew over the landscape. All of these are things that are fairly trivial with LiDAR mapping, but which would be very difficult, if not impossible, with traditional maps. \n\nAs far as cost goes, it is true that LiDAR mapping is expensive. For a large site (let alone a large swath of territory like that covered in the La Ciudad Blanca project), you could be looking at several hundred thousand dollars in price. Nevertheless, to map this the old fashioned way would take *many* years and likely more money. There are travel costs for getting to and from the site, costs for renting the mapping equipment, living expenses and salaries for crew, costs of hiring locals with machetes to systematically clear forest so the Total Station can see through it, etc. By contrast, you run LiDAR once, and you're done. It takes a day to take the measurements, and a couple more days to process the data. Yes, it's expensive, but I would argue its less expensive than traditional mapping. It just appears more expensive because the cost of the technique is paid up front rather than distributed across multiple field seasons.\n\n**Sensationalism and Sour Grapes**\n\nI want to conclude this post by asking a question: Is sensationalism always a bad thing?\n\nWhile we all acknowledge that Stephens' and Catherwood's travel writing on the Maya ruins played into orientalist tropes about native peoples in a somewhat patronizing way, I would argue that the field of Maya archaeology would not be where it is today without them. By sensationalizing their “discoveries,” they brought the existence of Mesoamerican cultures into the minds of a popular audience and got people excited about studying them. Subsequent scholarship under the likes of Sir J. Eric Thompson was directly inspired by the popularized accounts these 'adventurers' provided. \n\nThe La Ciudad Blanca press coverage regurgitates many of the same mistakes that Stephens and Catherwood did. In that regard, Rosemary Joyce is right to criticize it. But in making these criticisms, it's important to acknowledge that the data this project has generated is going to be invaluable to the work of future archaeologists in the region. We now have a high resolution LiDAR map for pretty much the entire Mosquitia rain forest, covering multiple sites in a region that has seen very little work prior. One can hope that once the documentary is released the filmmakers will make this data available to future researchers, thus providing them with a high quality map that would normally be well outside the budget of any research teams working in the area. Furthermore, the hype and sensationalism in the story has brought the region into the public eye. Hopefully, like the popularized works of Stephens and Catherwood, this will encourage a new generation of archaeologists to focus on the region in order to advance our understanding of it. \n\nIn short, while I think its fair to criticize the way this project has been represented in the press, it is erroneous to claim that this project has no academic value. A lot of the criticism comes across as sour grapes. ",

It included the last time two battleships come into direct conflict. And how an utterly outclassed force can cause the far superior force to back down and ultimately lose the battle.\n\nThis final statement is worthy of correction, so further down, [with a score of -2 at time of writing](https://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/2xxl09/japanese_world_war_ii_battleship_musashi_found/cp4q4gs), we find:\n\n&gt; wait, are you saying the US was the \"utterly outclassed force\" in the battle of Leyte Gulf? Because that is the furthest thing from the truth.\n\n[Leading to some clarification](https://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/2xxl09/japanese_world_war_ii_battleship_musashi_found/cp4qdjl):\n\n&gt; Once Halsey pulled his force away, and the secondary force was decoyed to the south, the Yamato, along with a collection of battleships and cruisers faced off against a handful of destroyers and destroyer escorts. There couldn't be a worse mismatch.\n\nAnd eventually [it gets resolved even further down](https://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/2xxl09/japanese_world_war_ii_battleship_musashi_found/cp4qqnw).  This is a minor embuggerance, but annoys me because the casual reader will come away with completely the wrong impression despite the originator of the top comment knowing enough about the battle to not make the mistake they did.  Furthermore a reasonable contradiction to OP's statement is disregarded and downvoted in a sub that is supposed to welcome this sort of discussion.  \n\nLeyte Gulf is remarkable not just because of the action at Samar (in which *Musashi* wasn't even involved), but because a much smaller Japanese force managed to sow confusion amongst the Allied commanders (Admiral Halsey in particular) and nearly undid the invasion of the Phillipines by accident.  There were four stages to the battle and in only one were the Allied forces overmatched, overall the Japanese were at a severe disadvantage in every respect.  In sensationalist fashion, however, the focus is on the action at Samar where a Japanese squadron bumped into allied ships supporting amphibious landings and a selection of slow, lightly armoured US Navy ships punched well above their weight and force the Japanese force to disengage.\n\nThe battle is most fascinating for me as a military historian because it reinforces the chaotic nature of war and the commander's curse of never being able to make a perfect decision.  Halsey has been widely criticised for his decisions during the battle, but he was faced with three seperate forces, an imperfect picture of the enemy's capabilities and a need to balance concentration of force with splitting his ships.  There are great lessons to be learned here about underestimating the enemy, balancing force, understanding vulnerabilities and clear communication - but why bother with that when we can sensationalise.\n\nEdit: paragraphs.\n\n",

        "text": "There's a coat in the collection of the Smithsonian that's labeled as belonging to Loyalist Eli Dagworthy who served in the 44th Regiment of Foot during the French &amp; Indian War. At one point it was listed as a Revolutionary War coat, but some time in the past year their website has changed the date on it to say circa 1768. \n\n[Dagworthy coat at the Smithsonian website](http://amhistory.si.edu/militaryhistory/collection/object.asp?ID=156)\n\nPhotos of it get shared quite often on various social media sites, and it's easy to see why. It's a beautiful coat, well preserved, and seems to fit what we think we know about British officers.\n\n[Eli Dagworthy's coat](http://40.media.tumblr.com/dbf5c6340be7597d8c6b6c71c96facb8/tumblr_nkpr8dSofe1tseacco1_500.jpg)\n\nOnly it's absolutely not a coat that dates to 1768, nor was Eli Dagworthy a Loyalist. \n\nThe first thing that's immediately apparent is that the coat was made pre-1768. New uniform warrants were issued in 1768 that drastically changed many things about the way uniforms were worn. Some of the things that make this a pre-1768 coat include the following:\n\n* No way for the skirt [tails] of the coat to be pinned back\n* The coat is too long--Rev War coats went to just above the knee\n* Lapels are too thick. The 1768 warrant asks for 3 inch lapels\n* The Lapels vary in size and aren't straight. The 1768 warrant specifices straight lapels of the same width.\n* No epaulette on the shoulder (it could have fallen off over the years but there doesn't appear to be any holes from where it would have been.\n* In both the 1768 and 1761 clothing warrants the 44th Regiment of Foot were instructed to have red waistcoats and red breeches. However Cuthbertson in his manual on the British Army (published in 1776) mentions that during the summer white linen waistcoats and white linen pants were much preferable while on campaign or in the summer.\n* The lining of the coat is the same color as that of the Regiment. After 1768 most regiments had the facings the same color as the regiment, but not the entire lining.\n* The cuffs have a slit or notch in them. The 1768 warrant specifically requires round cuffs.\n\nSome uniform details that point to this being sometime *after* the French &amp; Indian War.\n\n* The waistcoat is definitely not a 1750s style waistcoat\n* The pockets on the coat are a closer match to the style of pockets in later period jackets.\n* The cuffs are smaller than most coats from the 1750s and early 1760s\n* The cut of the jacket is trimmer and more form fitting than was normal for 1750s and is more reminiscent of the late 1760s or early 1770s. \n* The gaiters more closely resemble Revolutionary War era gaiters, though they're missing their stiffened uppers. \n* The breeches are buckskin and are a weird mix of pant and breech. Too hard for me to determine time period on those.\n\nSince the coat has inconsistencies, I figured the next step would be to try and track the service record of Eli Dagworthy himself, to see if he was a Loyalist during the Revolutionary War.\n\nI reached out to Don Hagist, author of [British Soldiers, American War: Voices of the American Revolution](http://www.amazon.com/British-Soldiers-American-War-Revolution-ebook/dp/B00AAZIQLU), and keeper of a blog by the same name which can be found at [redcoat76.blogspot.com](http://redcoat76.blogspot.com/) to ask for some help with the service records.\n\nHe was able to confirm that yes, Eli Dagworthy had served in the 44th Regiment of Foot during the French &amp; Indian War, but that he transferred to the 48th Regiment of Foot in 1773 and left the army in 1775 and retired to Trenton, New Jersey. \n\nNow it was still possible that Eli Dagworthy was a Loyalist in Trenton during the war, but the information that Don provided gave me enough to dig into some serious research using a variety of different source (thank god for the internet!)\n\nHere's what I was able to confirm about Eli Dagworthy using sources like wills, letters, biographies, and town and state histories. \n\n* Eli Dagworthy  was likely born in Trenton New Jersey, where his parents had been long time settlers. \n\n* His brother, John had fought in King George’s War and was commissioned a captain in that war. John retired at half-pay at the end of that war back to Trenton.\n\n* At the outbreak of the French &amp; Indian War John resumed his service in the British Army as a captain, holding several important posts. The men he led were called the Maryland Rangers because the part of NJ they were raised from was part of Maryland at that point. \n\n* John Dagworthy clashed with George Washington over issues of command. Since Dagworthy was a commissioned captain in the Army he felt that he outranked any colonial, no matter how high ranking that colonial was. Washington obviously disagreed. There's an interesting collection of letters and documents about that dispute [here](http://historyreconsidered.net/Timeline_of_Maryland_Forces_1754_1764.html). John Dagworthy would eventually be promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and given large tracts of land as a reward for his service.\n\n* Eli went with his brother as an ensign in the 44th and both fought under Braddock. \n\n* Eli was wounded at Ft. Ticonderoga in 1758. \n\n* At the end of the war he stayed in the army. In 1773 Eli transferred to the 48th (both units were then in Ireland), and stayed in the army until 1775. \n\nSome accounts of his life state that he probably left because he didn't want to take up arms against his countrymen, however I suspect that something else was at play.\n \n* He wrote out a will on February 28th, 1776 (in which his name is spelled Ely, as it is on other period documents), and died some time in 1776. The short time between his departure from the army and his death may indicate that he had contracted some illness. \n\n* In that will he gave all of his \"wearing apparel\" to his nephew, John Dehart Jr. The items of clothing are listed, along with how many of each item. In that list is \"1 great coat\", which may indicate this uniform, as it's not otherwise listed on the will. \n\nHowever it's also possible that he had strong Whiggish feelings too, as his family certainly seems to have been firmly on the Patriot side. \n\n* His brother commanded the county militia and received a Brigadier General’s commission from the Continental Congress. \n\n* His brother-in-law was a delegate to the Continental Congress and served on the New Jersey Supreme Court. \n\n* His sister was involved in relief efforts for the Continental Army.\n\nThis doesn't make it impossible for him to have had Loyalist sympathies (there were thousands of families divided over the issue), but it does make it less likely. Although interestingly enough one of the witnesses to his will was a man named Isaac Allen who became a Lieutenant-Colonel of the 3rd Battalion of the New Jersey Volunteers, however another witness provided fuel and provisions to the Continental Army in 1776. \n\nSo why has the coat consistently been mislabeled as that of a Revolutionary War era coat, despite early inventories listing it as a French &amp; Indian War coat? \n\nFamily legends have a way of warping. It's easy to look at a red army coat and think \"Revolutionary War\", rather than French &amp; Indian War. Plus it's more glamorous. If the coat was from the Revolutionary War, and the owners of it know that their ancestor was American, then of course he has to be a Loyalist.\n\nSo when the coat gets donated or loaned to a museum for display, the information gets listed as \"Revolutionary War coat belonging to Loyalist Eli Dagworthy\". Then if that museum loans to another one they just take the word of that first museum, assuming that the first museum did their research.\n\nThen books get written about Revolutionary War uniforms, and the authors see this coat in museums as being from the 44th Regiment of Foot and describe it in their books as being representative of those uniforms. So other museums do their research, find the books listing it as a Revolutionary War uniform and think they're covered in the details. \n\n**TL;DR**\n\nEli Dagworthy couldn't have been a Loyalist because he was dead before such a term had any real applicable meaning. Moreover the coat couldn't be a coat from 1768 because of the many things it has that were done away with in the post-1768 era.\n\nSources:\n\nhttp://www.royalprovincial.com/military/musters/3njv/mrnjvman.htm (Royal Provincials is a fantastic online source for Loyalist information)\n\n[Memoir of Brigadier-General John Dagworthy](https://books.google.com/books?id=NNU4AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA24&amp;lpg=RA2-PA24&amp;dq=%22john+dagworthy%22+continental+army+colonel&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IETBKGsjuS&amp;sig=zSP_7_O7TO4EmvhXr2n_hXhWhnQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=45P3VPS2GMv0oATUsoCYDg&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) (not really a memoir since it wasn't written by Dagworthy but whatever)\n\n[Ely Dagworthy's Will](http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~elyfamily/ps03/ps03_049.htm)\n\n[History of Fayette County Pennsylvania](https://archive.org/stream/historyoffayette00elli/historyoffayette00elli_djvu.txt) \n\n[General Braddock’s Defeat on the Monongahela in 1755](http://www.britishbattles.com/french-indian/braddock-monongahela-part-8.htm) (Good article in general but also has period documentation about Ely Dagworthy's rank)\n\n[Timeline of Maryland Forces 1754-1764](http://historyreconsidered.net/Timeline_of_Maryland_Forces_1754_1764.html) Contains excerpts of the many letters and documents detailing the feud between Washington and John Dagworthy.\n\n[Report on the Condition of the Public Records of the State of New Jersey](https://books.google.com/books?id=V1BFAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=%22John+dehart%22+trenton+new+jersey+continental+army&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2AfAUtFypV&amp;sig=Vm7hyScQHO1hPWcKVZ2MR7OTpGA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DJj3VPOjCsKwogSasIHgCA&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22John%20dehart%22&amp;f=false)\n\n[Letter to George Washington from Trenton &amp; Mercer County Magistrates](http://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/03-13-02-0103)",

        "text": "Since it not only showed up on [Mental Floss](http://mentalfloss.com/article/27298/6-articles-clothing-caused-riots) but made it to the front page of [Reddit today](http://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2xwqdv/til_the_first_time_a_top_hat_was_worn_in_public/) I feel the need to at least tackle the top hat section of the article. \n\n\"In 1797, London haberdasher John Hetherington was hauled into court on charges of breaching the King's peace, found guilty, and ordered to pay a £50 fine. His crime? Wearing a silk top hat, or, as it was described in court, \"appearing on the public highway wearing upon his head a tall structure having a shining lustre and calculated to frighten timid people.\" According to contemporary reports, people booed, dogs barked, women fainted, and a small boy suffered a broken arm after a crowd formed around the hapless Mr. Hetherington.\n\nTop hats were evidently outlawed in London for a time after that, although not for very long—50 years later, Prince Albert boosted the hat's popularity in England by wearing one, and establishing the primacy of the top hat for generations to come. In America, it's virtually impossible to picture Abraham Lincoln without it, Monopoly just wouldn't be the same without it, and what else would Uncle Sam possibly wear?\"\n\nFirst off, no. There is not only absolutely no extant documentation that this event actually took place (Old Bailey court records in London are pretty big), but the whole idea that a large hat in 1797 would be shocking is so incorrect it's almost as comical as their hats were. I present to you, fashion.\n\n[Fashion plates from 1785-6](http://www.ekduncan.com/2012/06/1785-1786-french-fashion-plates-des.html) with some fairly tall crowned, large hats.\n\nEven bigger [in this plate of 1790](http://damesalamode.tumblr.com/post/3962020089/journal-de-la-mode-et-du-gout-april-1790-red).\n\nBut perhaps they're exaggerating, being fashion plates and all. Oh, wait. There's [this young French gentleman from 1791](http://marie-antoinettequeenoffrance.blogspot.com/2009/12/fashionable-male-nicolas-chatelain.html#.VPeRM1pdjnk) and that's definitely a tall, black hat.\n\nOr [this gentleman from 1795](https://www.flickr.com/photos/12946229@N05/3644858746/in/set-72157604420180691/) who has quite a sporting look.\n\nAnd [Joseph Wright with his family from 1793](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/71353975319988217/).\n\nAnd let's not leave out the ladies. [Mary Arkwright in 1790](http://www.wikiart.org/en/joseph-wright/portrait-of-richard-arkwright-junior-with-his-wife-mary-and-daughter-anne) or this [anonymous woman also form 1790](http://hatsfromhistory.tumblr.com/post/8823463195/oldrags-portrait-of-a-lady-by-jean-laurent). Even [little Miss Mary gets in on the action in 1793](http://twonerdyhistorygirls.blogspot.com/2015/01/stylish-lady-mary-and-basket-of.html).\n\nAs for banning the top hat, there's (again) no evidence of that. And a great many men must have gone to jail if that was the case. Including [this iceskating minister](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Skating_Minister.jpg). The top hat, just considered a high crowned hat, continues constantly in fashion throughout the 19th century.

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2xy00f/whats_racist_about_telling_the_truth_medieval/",
        "text": "Hello /r/BadHistory, long time reader, first time poster. I'm a contributor to /r/AskHistorians but I haven't bothered to submit anything here, mostly because a proper debunking is too much work. However, something came up in recent weeks that has been really bugging me, and I really needed somewhere to hash it out. So here goes.\n\nChances are, if you're involved in the meta subreddits or use Twitter much, that you've come across this [blog](http://medievalpoc.tumblr.com/post/75252294049/hi-ive-been-looking-at-a-kickstarter-for-a) by MedievalPoC which created quite a stir on the interwebs, partly because it called out the 'historically accurate' RPG, Kingdom Come: Deliverance for its lack of women and PoC. Some people object to MPoC's lack of rigor, but I think MedievalPoC is delightful, if dogmatic, and shares a lot of cool art -- the historicity of the account's claims are another matter entirely, though I find them mostly inoffensive.\n\nEventually though, this blog post came to the attention of KC:D's game designer Daniel Vavra, and MedievalPoC [clashed](https://twitter.com/DanielVavra/status/569686445344079872) directly with him on Twitter, leading to the statements 'What's racist about telling the truth' and 'there were no black people in medieval Bohemia'.\n\nI'm of two minds about this. On the one hand, Bohemia was probably *pretty* white in the 14th and 15th centuries and MedievalPoC really should pick their battles, but on the other hand...'**no** black people in medieval Bohemia. Period.'? Nothing rustles my jimmies more than an absolute historical statement, but more on that later.\n\nWhat really got my gears turning though, was the claim that Kingdom Come: Deliverance was a 'historically accurate game'. I always find such claims to be suspect. Any historically accurate war game that takes place before the middle of the 20th century might as well be called 'Mud and Lice Simulator 2000!' or simply 'Die and Be Forgotten'. So I checked out the website to see what historically accurate means in this context. Here's what [the website](https://www.kingdomcomerpg.com/) says:\n\n&gt;Our tale is based on historical events and takes place in 15th century Europe. The year is 1403, and it is most certainly not the best of times. The old king is dead and his heir is weak. \n\n&gt;A humble, young blacksmith loses everything to war. As he tries to fulfill the dying wish of his father, Fate drags him into the thick of a conspiracy to save a kidnapped king and stop a bloody conflict. You will wander the world, fighting as a knight, lurking in the shadows as a rogue, or using the bard’s charm to persuade people to your cause.\n\nNow, I feel a *little* bad tearing into this, not having full access to the game, but the creator *does* place heavy emphasis on historical accuracy, so let's dig in.\n\n&gt;You will wander the world, fighting as a **knight**\n\nRight off the bat, this strikes me as problematic. In the Holy Roman Empire -- as everywhere in Europe -- the conditions for becoming a knight were fairly rigid. Specifically, you had to be a noble (or in rare occasions, just very rich). In Bohemia and the HRE, the only people eligible to be [Imperial Knights](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Knight) were the older free nobility (edelfrei or hochfrei) or wealthy members of the unfree *ministerialis*. That's not to say that common folk never rose from obscurity to become knights, but such occurrences were vanishingly small by the 15th century, and fall firmly in the realm of historical fiction.\n\nIf we're being charitable, 'knight' here could just refer to a style of heavily-armored mounted warfare, but that's just as improbable. Short of looting a fallen noble's corpse or stumbling upon a hidden treasure trove, a blacksmith's son could never hope to afford a full suit of armor, much less a horse. Even a quality sword might be difficult to come by. Now, the website makes mention of the Hussite Wars, which were fought largely by the peasantry, but they were armed largely with improvised farming implements and tools -- flails, spears, and simple polearms.\n\n&gt;lurking in the shadows as a **rogue**\n\nI don't really have a problem with this, aside from using [a word](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=rogue&amp;searchmode=none) that wouldn't be invented for over a century and a half. \n\n&gt;or using the **bard’s** charm to persuade people to your cause\n\nThis, on the other hand, I do have to protest. If Vavra's argument against Moors being in Bohemia is based on the distances involved, what is a bard -- a poet performing in the British and Gaelic tradition -- doing in Bohemia? No doubt Vavra means something closer to 'minstrel', but if we're being sticklers for historical accuracy, we should be consistent.\n\nOf course, that's not a whole lot to go on, but based on first impressions I'm forced to conclude that the game isn't as historically accurate as its creator claims. Frankly, any game where orphaned blacksmith's sons end up anywhere but a shallow grave or maybe a monastery is pushing it, and I can't see how adding a visiting Moorish noble or Malian mercenary would be inconsistent with the level of accuracy it maintains.\n\nWhat of that claim though, that there were 'no black people in medieval Bohemia'? This is, [for a lot of reasons](http://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/may-1997/problems-in-studying-the-role-of-blacks-in-europe), a difficult question to answer, not in the least part because the concept of 'blackness' is a relatively modern one. We know that there were many black Moors in Iberia, even after the reconquista, and that there was some contact between African Kingdoms and Europe -- in 1306, for example, an Ethiopian delegation arrived in Europe seeking an alliance with against the Moslems.\n\nCertainly the people of Central Europe were not entirely strangers to Africans, given that the Cathedral of Magdeburg was dedicated to [St. Maurice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_of_Magdeburg#mediaviewer/File:Saint_Maurice_Magdeburg.jpg) and images of [St. Gregory the Moor](https://40.media.tumblr.com/2c2b5be83215d9785accfa1e04f66ddb/tumblr_nbfmf33YNa1ssmm02o2_r1_500.png) appeared in St. Gereon's Cathedral in Cologne.\n\nWhat's easier to argue against is the idea that Bohemia was exclusively white. The Kingdom of Bohemia lay on several important trade routes and within spitting distance of the Kipchak Khanate, Constantinople, Venice, and the burgeoning Ottoman Empire. While not likely a significant population, Bohemia no doubt saw a fair number of foreign mercenaries of Turkish, Mongol, Cuman, Tatar, or Arab descent, especially during the troublesome 15th century.\n\nWomen warriors -- even knights -- are even easier to argue for, as there is [plenty of historical precedent](http://www.megapathdsl.net/~amichaels/girlsclubdocs/McLaughlin%20The%20Woman%20Warrior.pdf). Again, if we're letting peasants become knights, then women carrying swords is at least as plausible.\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\nVavra's claims about women and PoC in medieval Bohemia aren't expressly wrong, they aren't precisely correct either, and definitely shouldn't be made with absolute certainty, as he has. Furthermore, Vavra's claims about his game being 'historically accurate' aren't borne out by the game itself (or at least, by its promotional materials).\n\nVavra is, of course, well within his rights to make all of his characters white and male, but if he does, it is because that is his choice, not because he is forced to by slavish devotion to historical accuracy.\n\nNote: I am not an expert on medieval Bohemia, or anything west of the Danube in this period, so feel free to correct any mistakes or oversights.\n\n",

        "text": "Notice: much of the post that will be discussed today happens to touch on modern gender politics. I will not be going over those, because that would be a violation of R2. Also, I'm a mod. I am not above my own rules. Subsequently, **if any of the comments here violates R2, you will be fed to the AutoModerator and/or sacrificed to Volcano. Don’t do it.** There are other subreddits where you can talk about modern gender politics. This is not one of them. Please take that discussion elsewhere.\n\nNow then! [There’s no real introduction here, so let’s get started.](https://archive.today/WTrEI)\n\n&gt; First wave:\n\n&gt; * 19th and early 20th century\n&gt; * Mostly focused on sufferage exclusively for women (most men at this time did not have the vote)\n\nIt’s not a secret that there was a time where there was no universal suffrage, for men or for women. There was a large segment of the population that didn't have the right to vote because of property restrictions, and there’s no denying the fact that at one point, a large number of people could not vote.\n\nThat being said, during the 19th and early 20th century, we start seeing movements pushing for more universal suffrage for men and for women. Obviously, we have the women’s suffrage movement. But we’re also seeing laws being put into place that were expanding the electorate by lowering, and then eventually getting rid of, property restrictions for men. [I went over it in more detail in a really old post; feel free to browse through it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/20ygyi/lhf_so_apparently_only_1_of_the_population_was/) Admittedly, the claim was “most men” and not “1% of men”, but still. Point is that when the women’s suffrage movement was active, there were efforts and laws being put into place towards universal male suffrage. As such, to ignore this context is inherently misleading.\n\n&gt; * Mostly active in UK and former colonies \n\n[If I’m choosing to not be generous, feminism existed outside the UK and the US during this time period.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_feminism#National_histories_of_feminism) \n\nIf I’m choosing to be generous, and choose to interpret that statement to mean that the movement for women’s suffrage was mostly in the UK and the US, [they’re still wrong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_suffrage). I’m aware that most people tend to discuss the suffrage movements in the UK and in the US, but the push for women’s suffrage did not solely exist there. [Someone once posted a comment with pictures of pro- and anti-suffrage images in /r/badhistory, to give one example.](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2b0qhr/womens_suffrage_was_hardly_controversial_or_how/cj0qtwp) We’ve got women’s suffrage movements [in Mexico](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_suffrage#Mexico), [in Chile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_suffrage#Chile), [in Turkey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_suffrage#Turkey), [in Sweden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_suffrage#Sweden), [in Norway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_suffrage#Norway), etc etc etc.\n\n&gt; * Rarely, if ever, called themselves feminist\n\nThere is at least one work from this time period that explicitly uses the word “feminist”: [Alice Miller’s *Are Women People? A Book of Rhymes for Suffrage Times*](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/11689/11689-h/11689-h.htm):\n\n&gt; \"Mother, what is a Feminist?\"  \n&gt; \"A Feminist, my daughter,  \n&gt; Is any woman now who cares  \n&gt; To think about her own affairs  \n&gt; As men don't think she oughter.\"  \n\n&gt; \\- “Feminism”, Alice Miller\n\nThe word “feminism” (as in, “advocate for women’s rights”) comes from the French word *féminisme* [in 1837](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=feminism). The word “feminist” is from [1892](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=feminist). Uhhhhhhh....\n\nThat being said, just because a word has roots in the mid-1800s doesn't mean it was in common parlance. I’m not going to tick this off as completely wrong at the moment, because I don’t have a lot of writings from that era, but there was at least one suffragette who were calling themselves feminists.\n\n&gt; * Questionable tactics including destruction of property, hijacking unrelated events and dangerous stunts such as attempting to pin slogans to moving racehorses \n\nYes, there were suffragettes who did do these things. There were other suffragettes who didn’t do these things, but then we get into “not all suffragettes”, which is a pretty stupid line of argument.\n\n&gt; *Strongly supported traditional gender roles and formed white feather brigades to shame men into serving abroad during WW1. Supported military service as a requirement for men gaining access to the vote\n\n[WRONG.](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1zynqo/on_the_role_of_women_in_world_war_one_or_white/) Half of Britain’s suffrage movement was *against* supporting the war effort.  In addition, a number of women would disagree that they supported “traditional gender roles”, with Emmeline Pankhurst and other feminists fighting to get women involved in war-factories. Last I checked, that’s not a “traditional gender [role]”. \n\n&gt; * After sufferage was granted in the UK (mostly due to the efforts of general sufferage groups), formed the backbone of the British fascist movement.\n\nGEE, WAY TO DISCOUNT THE EFFORTS OF WOMEN SUFFRAGETTES. \n\nAlso, while there were suffragettes in the [British Union of Fascists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Union_of_Fascists), this did not mean that they were the “backbone” of the UK Fascist movement. This also does not mean that every single suffragette was a fascist. The founder of the British Union of Fascists was Oswald Mosley and the party had a strong following in London’s [East End](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_End_of_London), which even today has high rates of poverty in some areas.\n\nSkipping most of the stuff about the second and third wave because of the whole modern gender politics thing, but I’m going to highlight this one:\n\n&gt; Third wave\n\n&gt; * Came up with the wave theory to make feminism seem older, link it to the sufferage movement and conveniently dismiss problems as being part of another wave\n\n[This is an article called \"Feminism Old Wave and New Wave\". It's a contemporary work from 1971, during the 2nd wave.](https://www.uic.edu/orgs/cwluherstory/CWLUArchive/wave.html) I found it on Google while I was looking for information about suffrage movements outside the US and the UK. The idea of feminism having multiple waves has been a thing since the 1970s and is not a product of the third wave.\n\nI realize this is really low effort and that I could have done more with this. In my defense, I am technically supposed to be working on my organic chem lab homework and studying for my final on Monday. -_-",

Supposedly the aim of the subreddit is to discuss Japanese WWII history, which I assumed focused on the International Military Tribunal for the Far East (IMTFE). As I am interested in the IMTFE myself, I was curious. It is after all one of the most forgotten and controversial chapters of World War Two. However, to my lack of surprise I quickly noticed the mods posting links to Holocaust \"revisionists\" David Irving and C. W. Porter and Japanese \"revisionist\" site *Society for Dissemination of Historical Fact* and Nanking massacre \"revisionist\" Higashinakano Shudo.\n\nThe most bizarre links I came across were interviews with Press TV reporter Joshua Blakeney discussing his new book *Japan Bites Back: Documents Contextualizing Pearl Harbour*. As I was previously aware of Press TV's 'revisionism' (Holocaust denial and 'fascist conspiracy theories' as Nick Cohen put it) I thought to myself: \"Well, this is a new direction\". As with Press TV, Blakeney espouses antisemtism, anti-Westernism and 'historical revisionism' as if it were coming from the mouth of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad himself. Among other things, Blakeney claims Japan was not only forced into the war but aimed to liberate Asia (which seems a little contradictory), that laws defining war crimes were *ex post facto*, that only in Japan and Iran can you be openly 'revisionist',  and that Jewish-Zionists want to introduce hate-speech laws in Japan. Despite being a pundit for Press TV he attempts to claim he's an objective observer by emphasizing his ethnicity (Caucasian) as if that had any relevance to the discussion. It should also be noted, as with many 'revisionists', he has no academic background. He claims to have learned Japanese at University but other than that has no academic credentials. Furthermore, he admits he doesn't have a strong grasp of Japanese but maintains he can read Hiragana and Katakana. A lack of academic credentials and a weak grasp of Japanese is in itself a recipe for disaster. \n\nMy post is quite big so I'm going to put the rest in the comment section.\n\nYou can watch the three interviews [here] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2jezyL_1xc), [here]  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnVQZtzx-yQ) and [here] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-UgDZ9Tlwk).

        "text": "I was glancing at /r/Badhistory2 breifly when I saw /u/Turnshroud's post about the stone-age japanese war machine. As a lowly high school student, I figured I would embark on the monumental task to unveil the subtly hidden stupidity in the claim that \n&gt; Japan remained in the stone age far longer than most other countries. Technology was thrust upon them after WW2 and they really couldn't handle it. The drastic and rapid change caused a lot of problems that are still very visible. Most of the weirdness is stemming from an almost complete lack of social norm. There's no baseline, so people push it.\n\nwhich was then qualified by statements including \n&gt;You don't really realize how rudimentary their weaponry was. They were still using bolt action rifles. A lot of the kids flying zeros had also never even seen planes before. In large, Japanese culture was nowhere near as advanced as the rest of the world. The Japanese military and government are not an indication of the civilians.\n\nand a different users own claim that:\n&gt;They had military technology but no real public technology. \n\nLets start from the beginning. While it seems like the statement \n&gt;Japan remained in the stone age far longer than most other countries. Technology was thrust upon them after WW2 and they really couldn't handle it.\n\nWhile this post might mean that Japan had just stayed in the stone age longer than other areas of the world, it could be read as meaning that the Japanese were in the stone age until the end of WWII, I will assume they meant exactly that.\n\nFirst of, it is clear that we are discussing the Neolithic here, as seen by [this photograph](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-JNPVKIV7nw4/Ur7p8SZsc6I/AAAAAAAAYBY/zTqfZxZZ1mE/s1600/Old+Japan+(23.jpeg) demonstrating the adoption of agriculture in Japan circa 1932. Because the neolithic period was characterized by the adoption of agriculture, and was separated from the chalcolithic by a lack of bronze making. \n\nUnfortunately, [here](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Tokugawa_coinage.jpg) are some examples of coins, including a bronze coin, dating to the Tokugawa period (before World WarII). Unless the brief spurt of Christianity in Japan which was repressed during the Tokugawa period caused chart-like levels of technological loss, or EU IV like levels of catholic zealot rebels, Japan would have been in at least the Chacolithic by the start of World War 2. At this point, classifying cultures by their ability to work rocks and metals falls of in usefulness- Japan was certainly into the Iron age as evidenced by steel objects appearing by at least [1862](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XfHaBgYxkOA/Ur7p17Uk3fI/AAAAAAAAYAs/_uMaO1lDLMs/s1600/Old+Japan+(2.jpeg). \n\n\nI will skip over the racist remarks about Japanese culture for now. \n\nThis next part has some issues- first note that OP is not denying the interpretation of his claim as meaning World War 2 Japan was in the stone age, and while absence of evidence and all that, it is saying something. \nLets start out with \n&gt;You don't really realize how rudimentary their weaponry was. They were still using bolt action rifles.\n\nIf I had been doing this post, I would have focused on the use of Katanas by the IJA officers and others. [Here](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--a7tCxiIWmU/Ur7p5wntegI/AAAAAAAAYBE/rtKjURsQSLw/s1600/Old+Japan+(22.jpeg) we can see that some part of the IJA was equipped with bolt action rifles.  However, this means little as the US Marine corp was also equipped with the bolt action M1903 Springfield during the [Okinawa campaign](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/0c/f8/ee/0cf8ee0cfa9d6ab640de2416e54755e6.jpg). \n\nAnd now \n&gt;A lot of the kids flying zeros had also never even seen planes before\n \n[This](https://www.acheronbooks.com/img/cms/ba27-i.jpg) is a Breda 27 with Kuomintang markings on its wings. Given the massive war with China, I find it unlikely that the Japanese pilots never once encountered enemy aircraft. Moreover, this is a moot point- The Red Baron, Manfred von Ricthofen was widely regarded as an expert fighter pilot, despite the lack of commercial aviation in pre-World War 1 in Germany.

        "author": "Tiako",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2xhfx6/moai_picture_shows_up_again/",
        "text": "http://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2xgkah/full_unearthed_statue_of_easter_island_head/\n\nThis is a picture that shows up very frequently because, let's face it, it is super cool. And not only because of Professor Beardy's shameless flaunting of the short shorts! It takes a well known set of monuments that are impressive in their own right and shows that they are even more impressive than first imagined. Unfortunately, there is a lot of misinformation about Rapa Nui (Easter Island) floating around that always creeps into these discussions. So, plunging in:\n\n&gt;The scale of these things never fails to blow me away.\n\nThis is pretty mild but worth nipping this in the bud: this moai is *not* every moai, in fact I believe it is the largest ever uncovered. As you can see from [this image](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Ahu-Tongariki-2013.jpg) of the restored Ahu [sacral complex] Tongariki there is a wide variety of different sizes. They also come in different shapes, as some appear to be kneeling and some are standing. This is a pretty benign misconception, but people often get the idea that because this particular head was connected to a massive body then they all were. Some were, but not the majority (in fact, this size always struct me as a little unwieldy, which may be why it was still at the quarry site).\n\nThe more serious misunderstanding involves the nature of ecological destruction on the island, and these conversations often have a pretty bad leaping to extremes when nuance is called for. Before I get into that however, a bit more on moai construction:\n\n&gt;The easiest way for a primitive people to stand the heads up is to bury the bottom half. You just lay the whole thing down flat, then dig under what will become the bottom half. The whole stone tips itself up as the bottom settles down into the hole.\n\nAs you can see from the picture I provided, moai were not intended to be buried. They were often set up as markers at ahu, which were stone platforms used as ritual sites similar to sites across Polynesia such as the Hawaiian heiau. You don't bury the bottom inb a stone temple, and the way you ensure they stand upright is to make them really enormously heavy so they can't be easily knocked over. Mow, onto ecology:\n\n&gt;yep, and the reason you can't see the bodies is from soil erosion. The reason for the soil erosion is from the lack of trees. The reason for the lack of trees is because they got a kick out of making statues of people.\n\nThis is the most common and oldest misconception of Rapa Nui ecology: the island was deforested because of the relentless drive to build statues. The causative factors are a little wonky given that the statues are, you know, not wooden, but more importantly there are about 800 moai in total carved over a period of several centuries and only about half were taken from the quarry site. The amount of trees to make rollers for 400 statues is, frankly, not enough to deforest an island. So why is the island deforested?\n\nSheep! When Europeans first arrived the island was not fully deforested. The reason the island looks kind of like the Scottish highlands is because that is what happens when you combine extensive land clearances with extensive sheep raising. However, this is sometimes taken too far and the counterclaim that before contact Rapa Nui was still a tropical island paradise. The reality is that the Polynesians were farmers, and farming requires extensive deforestation. This is caused through clear cutting but perhaps more importantly slash and burn techniques (although Rapa Nui soil is fertile enough that this may not have been neccesary). The arrival of humans also coincided with a collapse in bird populations, as they made easy prey for the early generations of settlers. As with other islands in the Pacific, Rapa Nui was domesticated by human colonization, transformed from a wild island to one that was extensively cultivated and suitable for wide scale human habitation.\n\nBut did these practices cause ecological catastrophe? This is still debated, and my personal opinion is: sort of. There are many different Pacific islands, and they all have their own history, but one common theme is the need to deal with challenges of living in a very constrained environment. The islands, simply put, are not very big and it is easy to outstrip the available resources, and we ca see a variety of different responses. On the atolls of the Caroline Islands a complex and extensive exchange system developed, particularly with the larger island of Chuuk, which would reward the Caroline tribute of \"stone money\" with agricultural produce. In Hawaii a complex state developed. On Tikopia people purposefully controlled population size. And Mangareva devolved into a pretty nasty form of chaos (it wasn't always nice). Easter Island doesn't seem to have completely collapsed but there are many signs of quite a bit of conflict, particularly in the later pre-contact period. So the population seems to have oustripped its resources somewhat but it probably did not cause the sort of complete social collapse that happened after the introduction of European diseases and slaving expeditions.\n\nSo the answer to why the moai were purposefully tipped over, the population only being five thousand today, and and a subtropical island looking like Scotland is complex and multivariable. Undoubtedly the human colonization of the island caused many changes, some of them disastrous for the earlier ecology. But that happens pretty much whenever humans go anywhere and farm and that ecological destruction need not be human population destruction.However, the Rapa Nui people did not seem to have fully solved the balance between ecology and human population needs, leading to intercommunal conflict, one sign of which may have been the halting of moai construction. This was then exacerbated by the introduction of the cocktail of ailments both pathological and human that tended to follow contact with western society. The ecological changes then reached their peak with the introduction of sheep raising.\n\nAre there lessons to be drawn from this about the environment? Certainly. But these lessons need not be straightforward or simple.\n\nIt is also worth noting that there are numerous other interpretations, mine drawing heavily from Patrick Kirch's *On the Road of the Winds* (along with most of my information). But suffice to say that moai building causing ecological collapse just doesn't hold water.",

        "text": "Man, I don't really know what to say about [this one](http://np.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/2xdlup/isis_was_created_by_the_cia_for_some_reason/cozbe52). Let's just dive right in.\n\n&gt; At some point during the reign of the Islamic Empire, the Khawarij appeared...\n\nWe're less than a sentence into this post and it's already gone off the deep end. First of all, what the heck is the \"Islamic Empire\"? There were a number of Islamic Empire*(s)*, but none are called specifically by that term. Even if we give the author the benefit of the doubt, it's rather unfair to talk about the the Khawarij as if they had randomly appeared out of nowhere. In reality, the loosely associated group known as the Khawarij was born out of the turmoil of the First Fitna at the end of the Rashidun Caliphate. Dissatisfaction with the manner in which the battle was concluded proved to be the final straw for one, which rebelled against Ali ibn Abi Talib. The rebels would go on to be known as the Khawarij.\n\n&gt; ...they would murder muslim children and women at random in crowded markets until the local order forces would kill them, and much like ISIS consider anyone not part of their gang to be a free-to-kill target.\n\nIt is no unfortunate accident of history that the Khawarij are recorded as violent. They were not above using extreme violence to eradicate what they considered sin. They were most famous for their acceptance of assassination as a useful tool, perhaps inspired by the events of the first fitna^1. Nevertheless, it is extreme to say that they killed anyone with whom they did not agree. The Khawarij of Basra were well known to be peaceful and preferred to live hidden lives. They did not openly forment rebellion nor attack others. The moderate Ibadiyya take this position even farther, preferring not to kill all apostates.\n\n&gt; Khawarij would pray with bloodied hands (the prayer ritual requires a washing ritual beforehand) and in streets, graveyards and on corpses (Islam prayer is prohibited on dirty places, and blood is of course considered a source of dirt...\n\nThis is essentially the Islamic variant of a pagan boogeymen. In fact, each and every one of these is ridiculous and not at all in line with Khawarij beliefs, inasmuch as they have a singular set of beliefs. They do not pray with bloody hands nor do they make a habit of praying in graveyards. Given the abundance of historical critiques of the Khawarij, you would assume *someone* would mention something as barbaric in a sect claiming to be Muslim. These criticisms simply do not come up when they should have been trumpeted from the rooftops. \n\nThis brings me to the final question: What do Kharijites have to do with ISIS? \n\nOf course, this is something of a rhetorical question, but the author has touched on a sensitive issue in comparing ISIS to the Khawarij. Even if they did not intend to suggest a connection, many others have no such compunctions. [Many](http://np.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/2f2r8x/could_isis_be_the_khawarij_mentioned_in_hadith/ck5d9ze), [many](http://video.dusunnah.com/innovations/al-khawarij/the-correct-islamic-position-towards-isis-shaykh-saalih-as-suhaymee/) [people](http://www.siasat.pk/forum/showthread.php?293165-Is-ISIS-Group-of-Khawarij&amp;s=86dfc16839b8c55a2d0cf3b13a8e5f5f&amp;p=2784036&amp;viewfull=1#post2784036) [consider](http://ahlusunnahwaljamaah.tumblr.com/post/106435729848/the-link-between-the-khawarij-isis-al-qaaidah) [ISIS](http://www.aawsat.net/2014/12/article55339339/abu-qatada-directs-fierce-criticism-against-isis) [to](http://np.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/2uqa60/id_prefer_it_if_we_call_them_khawarij_or_ksis/) [be](http://muharraminmanhattan.com/2014/11/01/mashoufmuharram/) [identical](https://www.facebook.com/syedzaidzamanhamid/posts/676357842419030) [to](http://www.abubaseer.bizland.com/hadath/Read/hadath%20101.pdf) [the](https://twitter.com/shamiwitness/status/480960949206409218) [Khawarij](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2681445/The-moment-Syrian-rebel-leader-delivers-rousing-battle-cry-Islamist-militants-pink-Hello-Kitty-notebook.html). \n\nKharijites are something of a boogeyman in the Islamic world. Radical splinter sects one wishes to condemn can be compared to or associated with the Khawarij. This is a term used in much the same way we might use \"Nazi\" or \"Communist\". In essence the term has lost all of its historical precision to refer to a single group with a homogenous set of beliefs. The term \"Khawarij\" has instead come to refer to any rebellious group that may be considered outside of Islam. The term itself references this, meaning \"Those who went out\". To associate ISIS with the Khawarij is nothing more than a polemic attack, to establish their horrific ideology as the modern incarnation of an ancient and vaguely defined set of heretical beliefs. The historical problem is that ISIS does not derive from the Khawarij tradition. A Khawarij group would not want to establish a caliphate, as one of the core beliefs is a rejection of caliphates. Further, they  would have vehement disagreements with the Sunni requirement that a caliph must be descended from the Quraysh, as ISIS' current leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi claims to be. The original author's example is suspiciously close to claiming a link between these groups. I cannot help but feel that the juxtaposition was more than an accident.\n\n^1 Kenney, J. T.

If you want to join just come on in and we'll have a look at what free countries are acceptable for everyone. The starting point was **below 23 base tax** ([list here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19-exn0lHJXro5t2Ndfu2ROVa6S7eSWfAOaRXvIDTP5o/pubhtml)) but I think with last week's progress that can be relaxed a bit possibly.\n\n- **We need to discuss whether or not to have hotjoining enabled. It was a big problem last week, since it took us a long time to get the game running and hotjoining seemed to mess it up. I propose just having an hourly hotjoin moment, where people gather in the badhistory group chat to hotjoin at the same time. If it takes too long we can decide to cancel further hotjoins.**\nAlso, we will keep with the \"**no pausing**\" rule. If last week is any measure we won't ever manage to go above speed 2 and might even be downgraded to speed 1 on occasions, wich should leave plenty of time to react.\n\n- The primary means of communication (apart from in-game chat obviously) is [Teamspeak](http://www.teamspeak.com/?page=downloads). Server stuff will be the same as last as we didn't seem to have any problems in that regard.  \nIP: **88.207.244.183** (public server in Luxembourg) - once again, please mention the country you're playing as in your nickname, i.e. \"Headshotcatcher | Orissa\" or similar to make it easier for everyone.\n\nServer name and password will stay the same as last week (**Badhistory Universalis**, password: **holyvolcano**) in any case for those wondering.  \nFor the final instructions and probably for joining off of the person in question please join the [steam group chat](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/badhistory) before game start as it will make stuff *a lot* easier.  \n\n****\n\n**Please download the save file before joining, as this speeds up the loading process considerably! [Follow this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8nmVQUpf2SibUlHSDc2VjdqTUE/view)**\n\n- Will anyone be streaming?\n\n- Does anyone know if we should enable the new DLC? I can check out whether it corrupts the save file, but will it mess up anything else?\n\n\n\nThis is all for now. Good luck. And don't forget: /r/badhistory expects every user to do his duty!",

The last English woman convicted under the Witchcraft Act of 1735 was, it is true, convicted in 1944.  Unfortunately, the 1735 Witchcraft Act only made it a criminal offence to pretend to be a witch, as by 1735 the law didn't believe in witchcraft.  As far as I can tell, the last people to be convicted of witchcraft in England were Mary and Elizabeth Hicks (1716), with Janet Horne in Scotland in 1727 being the last in the UK.\n\n&gt; Queen Elizabeth I invented the gingerbread man.\n\nDubious.  Wikipedia claims that the first documented case of gingerbread men being made was at the court of Elizabeth I, which I can entirely believe.  I can't be bothered to hunt the reference down to check it out.  I can't find anything even remotely reputable attributing the gingerbread man to Elizabeth herself.\n\n&gt; Mozart kept a fart diary.\n\nMaybe.  Mozart's love of scatological humour and writing is sufficiently well known that it has [its own wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozart_and_scatology).  On the other hand, I'm struggling to find any record that Mozart kept a diary of any kind, let alone one which recorded farts, let alone one which solely or primarily did so.\n\nOn the other hand, I'm entirely prepared to believe that during his life Lenin owned nine Rolls Royces. There are at least multiple sources reporting it as fact available via google, though I can't seem to find any reputable site which mentions it.  It would be nice if someone knew the source of this \"fact\", and its accuracy...\n\n&gt; Humans had been keeping sheep for 7,000 years before it occurred to anyone to... use their wool.\n\nI am lazy, and so my first instinct to check this fact was to use the magic of wikipedia. Its [history of wool](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wool#History) suggests that sheep were first domesticated ~9,000-7,000 BC. There is some evidence that humans began selecting sheep for their wool by ~6,000 BC, suggesting that we had a use for it. The earliest woolen garments that we no of are no newer than 3,000 years later than that, or 3,000 BC. At most, therefore, it was 6,000 years between domesticating sheep and making use of their wool. For comparison, that's like saying that the automobile was invented in 886 AD -- the same year that Alfred the Great captured London.\n\n(Though it is outside the scope of badhistory, I am also dubious that there were 9 children named cheese born in the UK in 2013, and try as I might I cannot find any source for this.)",

        "author": "Quouar",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2xacnu/why_did_mesoamericans_sacrifice_people_and_why/",
        "text": "EDIT: **/u/Ahhuatl does a fantastic job outlining some of the problems with my post and some of my misunderstandings about Mesoamerican cosmology [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2xacnu/why_did_mesoamericans_sacrifice_people_and_why/cozu528). It's fantastic. You should read it.**\n\nI am taking into consideration the comments on my last post about \"El Dorado\" that El Dorado is a magical place that doesn't necessarily conform to the rules of any particular Mesoamerican culture. But to be honest, I want to write about Mesoamerica anyway, and so I will, and you can't stop me. So there.\n\nWhat I'd like to talk about today is the notion of sacrifice in Mesoamerican cultures - particularly Aztec sacrifice - and how [this clip from 55:20 to 56:45](http://youtu.be/zj2hLK1bjbM?t=55m20s) gets the reasons behind sacrifice wrong. I'll also talk about [this clip from 35:58 to 39:34](http://youtu.be/zj2hLK1bjbM?t=35m58s) and how it gets methods wrong. \n\nFirst, though, let's understand some basic things. While I'm going to be focusing primarily on the Aztecs - because that's who I can find the most information about - human sacrifice is by no means limited to them. It's something you find in most, if not all, of the Mesoamerican cultures. Zapotecs, Aztecs, Maya, all of them practised human sacrifice of one kind or another. So when we look at \"El Dorado\" - which, as some have astutely pointed out, is an amalgamation of Mesoamerican cultures rather than any one particular culture - we can judge it on how it portrays sacrifice inaccurately in the context of Mesoamerica as a whole. \n\n*Why* sacrifice was so widespread is an interesting question. The practice of human or blood sacrifice had been practised in many, many cultures around the world, so it's not as if human sacrifices in Mesoamerica were inherently unique. What's unique is the scale and its centrality, not the act itself. However, why it persisted in Mesoamerica and was so widespread is a question I don't claim to have the answer to.\n\nA word about the scale issue, though. As /u/Ahhuatl points out in the post I linked at the top, there is a conception of human sacrifice as a massive, insane thing. The particular example that is pointed to is the story of 20 000 - 80 000 people sacrificed at the dedication of a new temple. It's the conception that people have when they talk about Aztec sacrifice. However, it's likely an inaccurate one. There's not evidence of these massive sacrifices, and what evidence does exist is a bit biased, seeing as it comes primarily from Spanish conquistadors.\n\nWhile I don't necessarily know the historical-sociological reasons behind the adoption of such widespread sacrifice, I can talk a bit about the religious reasons behind sacrifice. What we find when we look at Mesoamerican cultures is that there's a tradition that largely builds on itself in terms of religious belief. Mayan religious belief is fairly similar to Aztec belief which is similar to Zapotec belief and so on (though of course there is an evolution and change in these beliefs - culture is hardly a static thing, after all). Odds are, the city of El Dorado, if it existed, would fall into this same cosmological tradition. This cosmological tradition relied not - as the film claims - on the idea that \"the gods don't bleed,\" but rather on the fact that the gods very much did. According to Aztec belief, for instance, humanity was created through the gods sacrificing themselves to bring them into existence. It's a myth that's found throughout Mesoamerica in one form or another - this idea of the gods sacrificing themselves or some part of themselves so that humanity and the world could persist. The dismemberment of Tlalteotl's body in Aztec cosmology, for example, gave fruit to humanity, an example of something that the Aztecs would then sacrifice in thanks of. This is the reason behind sacrificing to the gods. These sacrifices were seen as giving the gods strength, either to rebuild themselves or to endure, depending on which cosmology you're talking about. In the Aztec cosmology, once again, the blood being sacrificed to the gods is necessary to ensure that the gods are strong enough to ensure the universe doesn't collapse at the end of each 52-year cycle. Once again, /u/Ahhuatl does a much better job of explaining *teotl* than I do, and I highly recommend reading the linked reply. Other sacrifices might be made to ensure that the gods continued their favour of humanity, or to please any one particular god. \n\nSacrifices could also have been made with the general idea of forgiveness of one offense or another. This idea of sacrifice in appeasement of some sin is one that can be seen over and over again in Aztec tradition. There was a broad variety of offenses for which the punishment was sacrificing something in some way, usually some part of the self. For adulterers, for instance, that sacrifice might have been cutting the tongue or severing an ear, or some other sacrifice that in some demonstrated contrition and an understanding of why what they did was wrong. \n\nHowever, sacrifice was not just as contrition. Self-sacrifice was seen as part of the life of every person of every age, and part of their essential duty as a member of society (though it must be emphasised that there were differences between sacrifices from various members of society, especially in the more socially stratified social system of the Maya). Now, these sacrifices weren't always extreme, but did involve giving blood or cutting the skin at least once a year during certain festivals. Some descriptions of these sacrifices involve cutting the foreskin or slitting the earlobes, but this wasn't necessarily true of all sacrifices, nor was it always expected of everyone.\n\nThat said, some of these sacrifices could be very extreme as well as routine. A [relief](http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7146/6607154447_a2591073f0_m.jpg) from the Mayan city of Yaxchilan dating from around 700 CE shows King Shield Jaguar and his queen, Lady K'abal Xook, engaging in a routine sacrifice to gain favour from the gods. What's different about it, though, compared to the sacrifices commoners would have been expected to make is how incredibly and deliberately painful it is. Lady K'abal Xook's sacrifice involves running a vine of thorns through a hole in her tongue, drawing out as much blood as possible, and prolonging the pain for as long as she could. This was meant to have the dual effect of both demonstrating her piety to the gods - and ostensibly pleasing them with it - and triggering a vision of a serpent god, which would then help guide the city further. It's a sacrifice that would have been seen as immensely important for the future of the city. Equally, it's the sort of sacrifice that would have been expected of both king and queen at numerous points throughout their reign. Part of their duty as leaders was to ensure that the gods remained pleased with the people, and that the proper divine guidance and support was received. This entailed sacrifice.\n\nThis is another part of the problem with the film \"The Road to El Dorado.\" In that film, it's very clear that there's a dichotomy between the religious and secular leader, when this wasn't the case. While there was a priesthood that undoubtedly did its own thing, that priesthood also worked closely with ruling monarchs to ensure that sacrifices were properly done, and that they were sufficient.  Leaders were expected and obligated to perform sacrifices, not like this wimpy chump in the film who gets squeamish at the slightest mention of blood. I understand that a film is not necessarily supposed to be or obligated to be historically accurate, but this one is an interesting kind of bad history. \"The Road to El Dorado\" is the bad history that takes the conquistadors' side and sees human sacrifice as an inherently evil practice that must be downplayed and eliminated if Mesoamericans are ever going to be empathised with. While I can't say that I personally would want to be in a sacrifice-happy culture like Mayan or Aztec culture, it's equally wrong to make a moral judgement and condemn it as barbaric because we disagree with the morality behind it. It's what the conquistadors did, and by portraying all sacrifice as negative - as the film does - the film is inherently barbarising and stripping the Mesoamericans of their identity in favour of some watered-down, overly romanticised parody of themselves. \n\nAnyway.\n\nWhile we're on the subject of Lady K'abal Xook, let's look at methods by which there would have been sacrifices. I've mentioned a few already, but really, the impression I get from my reading is that the methods of sacrifice were limited only by human imagination. That said, there were some common themes. For the Aztecs, pain was important. Sacrifice, in addition to bringing out blood, needed to cause pain to be sincere. This meant that things like thorns and reeds through sensitive bits - the penis, earlobes, tongue, etc. - was common. Slitting the tongue, earlobes, and penis, as I already mentioned, was also common as a way of showing piety. Both the Maya and the Aztecs, too, sacrificed objects in addition to sacrificing blood, and indeed, some of these object sacrifices are now becoming valuable sources of information for archaeologists. However, other times, a good heart sacrifice was just required.\n\nThat's something the Aztecs did, by the way. There are many records of heart sacrifices, and the particular practice of sacrificing a heart - through burning, generally - to one god or another. Sometimes the sacrificer was dead before the heart was removed, but not always. Sometimes the body was otherwise left intact, but not generally. For every god, there was a particular way to prepare a body, and a special way in which a human or animal sacrifice could be done. Sometimes it was cutting a hummingbird's throat. Other times, it was drowning a baby, then skinning it and wearing its skin for several days. \n\nWhat was generally not the case, though, was that the gods would \"devour the wicked and unrighteous.\" This makes no sense in Mesoamerican cosmology. If the point of sacrifice is to strengthen the gods, what's the point of sacrificing a weak person? If the point is to show contrition or devotion, why sacrifice Criminal Bob whom no one liked in the first place? It's not really much of a sacrifice if the only ones going are the ones that no one wanted in the first place. Now, that said, there were sacrifices of criminals, but these were not in the majority. Rather, they were seen as - in the words of Mohtecuzoma - \"men who for their personal misdemeanors or as prisoners of war were already condemned to death.\" But I'll get into those in more detail in a moment.\n\nInstead, a wide variety of people were sacrificed, once again depending on the particular predilections of each god. As an example, some Aztec sacrifices required a stand-in for the god that was being sacrificed to to be the sacrifice. This meant, for instance, that one sacrifice might have to be a crying middle-aged woman, while another needed to be a prepubescent girl who had to have her neck broken when she least expected it. \n\nCommonly, though, it was prisoners of war who were sacrificed. There was a whole ritual associated with capturing prisoners specifically so that they could then be sacrificed. It centred around \"adopting\" the prisoner so that he - prisoners of war were almost always male - could then be a stand-in for the whole of the city that captured him. This meant that his captor would claim his as his son, take him back to the city, feed him, clothe him, and maybe even get him a woman to have sex with before sacrificing him. Indeed, sometimes the sacrifice wouldn't take place until months or even years after the prisoner arrived, just to ensure that the prisoner was properly ingratiated into the city and so it would be an actual sacrifice. Other times, the sacrifice was less generous, with the sacrificee being thrown unarmed into a gladiatorial arena with the sacrificer and being hacked to death with an obsidian club. It varied. \n\nIn addition to all of this, there were also sometimes volunteers for sacrifice. These volunteers saw sacrifice as a way to a better afterlife and a better existence than the one they had. Slaves, for instance, were known to sometimes offer themselves for sacrifice when they could not pay back the debt that had enslaved them in the first place. Prostitutes, too, would sacrifice themselves during festivals to Xochiquetzal, the goddess of love. These sorts of acts were seen in a variety of ways. For a warrior, being sacrificed wasn't the greatest thing ever, but neither was it the worst. It was decently honourable. For a slave or criminal, though, it was shameful, and something to be avoided.\n\nHowever, what must be emphasised is that sacrifice was a normal part of living in a Mesoamerican society. In \"El Dorado,\" ever instance of even mentioning human sacrifice is met with gasps of dismay, but this never would have been the case in an actual Mesoamerican city. Were there tens of thousands of sacrifices done at once as the conquistadors claimed? No, probably not, but equally, sacrifice was something that was done and done routinely. It wasn't a taboo. It wasn't hushhush. It was public, garish, and temple steps were likely constantly stained with blood because of it. \n\nIn essence, then, \"The Road to El Dorado\" completely misrepresents human sacrifice in Mesoamerica in a number of ways, not the least of which is by taking the conquistadors' perspective on it. While I understand it's hard to present human sacrifice neutrally, there are a lot better ways to do it than flat-out lying about Mesoamerican sacrifice, why it was done, and who was involved. It's a bit annoying.\n\n^^^^almost ^^^^as ^^^^annoying ^^^^as ^^^^that ^^^^stupid ^^^^song \n\nSources!\n\n\"Aztec Human Sacrifice as Expiation\" by Michael Graulich, published in History of Religions. It's got a lot of examples of how and why sacrifices were conducted, and is a more compelling argument for the rationale behind Aztec sacrifice. I highly recommend it.\n\n\"Understanding Aztec Human Sacrifice\" by Patricia Anawalt, published in Archaeology. It's another old one, but provides a good overview of the interactions between conquistadors and the Aztecs with regards to sacrifice.\n\n\"Myth, Belief, Narration, Image: Reflections on Mesoamerican Mythology\" by Alfredo Lopez Austin, published in the Journal of the Southwest. It's another one that gives a really good overview of Mesoamerican cosmology and some of the reasons behind sacrifice, as well as the methods used.\n\n\"Time and Sacrifice in the Aztec Cosmos\" by Kay Almere Read. Is a book. Is a big fat book. Is a good big fat book.\n\n\"A History of the World in 100 Objects\" by Neil MacGregor. Another big fat book. It's not wholly about Mesoamerica, but the sections that are are quite good. ",

In real life there was no conflict as Abraham's father was a staunch Patriot. However the filmmakers made the point that there were tens of thousands of such conflicts going on in America at the time, and in fact the relationship was practically a metaphor for the relationship between Americans and King George.\n\nSo they felt they had to include it to get that truth about the conflict across.

        "text": "From [here] (http://www.collective-evolution.com/2015/02/24/500-year-old-map-was-discovered-that-shatters-the-official-history-of-the-planet/). \n\n&gt; One great example is the Piri Reis map, a genuine document that was re-made (copied from older documents) at Constantinople in AD 1513, and discovered in 1929. It focuses on the western coast of Africa, the eastern coast of South America, and the northern coast of Antarctica. It was drawn by the military intelligence of Admiral Piri Reis of the Ottoman era. He is a well-known historical figure whose identity is well established. The Admiral made a copy of it, and the original was drawn based on documents that date back to at least the fourth century BC, and on information obtained by multiple explorers.\n\nOkay, so far, so good.\n\n&gt; Secondly, the map depicts what is known as “Queen Maud Land,” a 2.7 million-square-kilometer (1 million sq mi) region of Antarctica as it looked millions of years ago. This region and other regions shown on the map are thought to have been covered completely in ice, but the map tells a different story. It shows this area as ice free, which suggests that these areas passed through a long ice-free period which might not have come to an end until approximately six thousand years ago, which again, totally goes against what is taught and currently believed. Today, geological evidence has confirmed that this area could not have been ice-free until about 4000 BC.\n\nFirst of all, the map [doesn't actually show Antarctica](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piri_Reis_map#The_Antarctic_coast). And even if it did, how does that somehow trump decades of exploration on Antarctica that prove that the continent was covered in ice for millenia? Somehow, people a couple hundred years ago went there and went \"welp, no ice!\" and suddenly, in a span of centuries it was covered in miles of ice? How is that even possible without drastic shifts in Earth's climate?\n\nBut wait: it gets better:\n\n&gt; Here’s what Professor Charles Hapgood had to say about it:\n\n&gt; “It appears that accurate information has been passed down from people to people. It appears that the charts must have originated with a people unknown and they were passed on, perhaps by the Minoans and the Phoenicians, who were, for a thousand years and more, the greatest sailors of the ancient world. We have evidence that they were collected and studied in the great library of Alexandria (Egypt) and that compilations of them were made by the geographers that worked there.” (1)\n\nNo we don't. Besides, Charles Hapgood's History Credentials only give him expertise on Medieval History. I highly doubt he is as learned in Ancient History.\n\n&gt; Furthermore, the map is very detailed and includes mountain ranges in the Antarctic. which were not even discovered until 1952.\n\n&gt; “His idea is original, of great simplicity, and – if it continues to prove itself – of great importance to everything that is related to the history of the Earth’s surface.” – Einstein on Hapgood’s interpretations of the map (1)(2) (From a forward Einstein wrote for Hapgood in one of his books)\n\nNow Einstein was a brilliant Physicist. No denying about that. But is he a good geologist or cartographer? Hard to say. Serious Argument from Authority there. It's nice enough that the author left citations for us to follow. Let's see what those citations are, shall we?\n\n&gt; (1) Hancock, Graham. Fingerprints of the Gods: Canada: Anchor Canada, 2005\n\n&gt;(2) Daniken, Erich. Chariots of The Gods. New York: Berkley Books, 1970\n\nYeesh. If you don't know who Daniken is, but you've seen an episode of History's \"Ancient Aliens\", you've probably seen him, as he regularly guests there (though I won't blame you if you couldn't stand five minutes of that BS).\n\n**TL;DR**: Map allegedly shows us Antarctica, before it was formally discovered, to be \"ice free\". Also, it was written by people who have no right to be actually lecturing us on Cartography. Also, Aliens.",

I had stayed awake for 48 hours to marathon read *Creating a Common Table* (a great book about social roles of and pressures on women in Argentina during the modern era) and I threw a frustrated and sourceless post up here. I've now redone the post to fix that by adding sources, better arguments, ect.\n\nBefore I start I would like to thank /u/Hinmatoowyalahtqit for [providing a lot of the groundworkpost](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2viyy8/hey_guys_irish_slaves_chinese_immigrants_and/) for correcting this thread and /u/TurtleParkour for [being a great set of boots on the ground.](https://np.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/2x4zh6/black_history_month/cox5gk9?context=3)\n\n***********************\n\nSo, upon first opening up [the thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/2x4zh6/black_history_month/) and you are met with this:\n\n&gt;[\"Irish slaves were considered inferior to black slaves, and had worse treatment! The same goes for the Chinese!\"](https://np.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/2x4zh6/black_history_month/cowy9kh)\n\nThis is well known to be bullshit. \n\nIrish \"Slaves\" were actually indentured servants; they had identities, a way out of servitude, legal rights, ect. They in no way had worse treatment than chattel slaves on average and were definitely not considered inferior to Africans at the time. The entire ideology behind American slavery was racially motivated and, while it's true that many europeans that we today consider 'white' were not considered so back then, sub-Saharan Africans where considered to be less intelligent than 'whites' but more hard working that the indigenous Americans.\n\nTaken from /u/Hinmatoowyalahtqit's post:\n\n&gt;The majority of the indentured labourers from Ireland who emigrated to the West Indies in the 17th and 18th century, did so voluntarily. This was part of a much larger migratory trend and it has been estimated that the majority of Europeans who emigrated to the American colonies were indentured servants.\n\n==============\n\n&gt;Persons from Ireland have been held in various forms of human bondage throughout history, but they have never been chattel slaves in the West Indies.\n\n\n****************************\n\n\nNow we have [this.](https://np.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/2x4zh6/black_history_month/cox4xzc)\n\nI'll argue the three paragraphs individually.\n\n&gt;A not so popular fact is that white people did not just show up in Africa and start kidnapping black people.\n\nActually, this is a very popular fact, irrelevant to the discussion of white guilt, but somehow still popular.\n\nThe person's claim that 'white people' did not start kidnapping 'black people' is true on technicality because there were no black and white identities during the 15^th century. The first europeans to buy slaves were the Portuguese.\n\nAlso, I'd like to point out how bad of a justification this is.\n\n\"It's not immoral for me to have this slave, I bought it with my own money.\"\n\n&gt;White people showed up in Africa, offered trade, and when tribe leaders didn't have any wealth or currency, they offered up members of their tribe.\n\nMore bullshit.\n\nThe only book I have read on the topic is *Africa and Africans in the Making of the Atlantic World* and the arguments made there are that\n\n1. The origins of the slave trade lie in Portuguese raids on the west coast of Africa.\n\n2. When this was no longer economical they entered into trade agreements with the already prosperous economy on the west coast of Africa.\n\n3. They used religion (not race) as justification for slavery.\n\nAlso, I love how he makes them out to be tribes with no money; the Portuguese were literally making agreements with the King Alfonso of the Kongo.\n\n&gt;White man didn't put the black man in chains. Black man put the black man in chains and then sold him to the white man.\n\nThis is only half true, even if every African was enslaved by other Africans it still would not absolve the west for buying those slaves. Plus, the slavery practiced by African's at the time was no where near as brutal and dehumanizing as American slavery. African slavery even had clear paths to freedom and was not backed by a racist world-view.\n\n\n******************\n===\n\n&gt;[Actually they offered more than just people of their own society. The tribes would often wage war towards another group in order to take prisoners of war for the sole purpose of selling them to the Europeans to be sent to the New World. When the importation of slaves to the Americas was banned, the leaders of the tribes actually asked if they could resume trade because it was so economically prosperous for them.](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/2x4zh6/black_history_month/cox5b8k)\n\nThe African west coast was put into a colonial state where they provided the raw materials (slaves) for the west. Whether or not they were asking for it to continue, it was not benefiting their economy. In fact, many historians argue that the slave trade's destruction of states and economies is the main reason why Africa was so vulnerable to imperialism.\n\n\nAlso, this still doesn't justify buying people then working them to death.\n\n****************\n\nThe copypasta is back:\n\n&gt; - One of the The first slave owners in the USA was BLACK^1\n&gt; -   All races kept slaves all throughout history^2\n&gt; -   When the Trans-Atlantic slaveships docked at African slave-markets to buy slaves, they bought slaves who were already slaves. It was Arab Muslims and Black Africans themselves who captured members of rival tribes and took them to the coastal slave-markets to sell to the Whites and Jews. White people didn’t go into Africa and kidnap free black people. They barely needed to get off their ships to buy slaves, it was like buying McDonalds at a drive-through. The slaves were already at the slave-market in chains,  ready to go.^3\n&gt; -   In the 16th – 18th century, Africans enslaved 1.5 million White Europeans in the Barbary Slave Trade. African Muslims raided up the coastlines of Europe, particularly the British Isles but even as far as Iceland, kidnapping and enslaving White European Christians. The men were galley slaves, and the women were sex slaves. This was more brutal than working on a plantation or as a domestic servant.^4\n&gt; -   Native Americans and Jews owned Black slaves too, but no one seems to assign a collective guilt to modern Native Americans and Jews for their slavery. In fact, Jews were the biggest slave-owners in America per capita.^5\n&gt; -   Whites were the first people to stop slavery in modern times, whereas slavery still continues in Africa to this day. In Mauritania slavery was only made a punishable offense in 2007!\n&gt; -  **Less than 2% of Whites in America ever owned slaves**\n&gt; -  **Only 5% of the black slaves transported across the Atlantic actually went to the modern U.S. Most in fact went to Latin America to serve Hispanic slave-owners.

        "text": "First post everyone! Go easy on me, please.\n\nLet's give your livers a rest from the usual, ungodly hell that we usually have on this sub and take the time to snark at a commercial. Granted, most commercials are rife with factual inaccuracies, but this one is a little more glaring then the rest because of the easy fix. \n\n[Here is the ad in question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=645P1WwxIiA). As we can see, it features Mongol hordes, a Queen who's presumably meant to be Elizabeth, and the Salem Witch Trials. Except not.\n\nFirst, the one they get right: Mongol hordes were kinda everywhere, but most average people when they see that image are going to think Genghis Khan. If I may diverge for a minute, most advertising does this, drawing on what the audience already knows in order to serve the 30 second story they make. Anyway, the subtitle helpfully informs us that this is Central Asia circa. 1192, and for this one, they actually get it right. According to every source I can find, [including this hopefully reputable one I'm linking](http://www.biography.com/people/genghis-khan-9308634), he would have been 30 years old and therefore quite active in 1192. Since this one is correct, it is therefore uninteresting to us.\n\nThe second, 10 second story is set in England, 1459, with a queen on the throne. [Only, it wasn't a queen, it was Henry VI on the throne in 1459.](http://www.royal.gov.uk/historyofthemonarchy/kingsandqueensofengland/thelancastrians/henryvideposed.aspx) I can already hear people arguing \"but Henry would have had a queen!\" Perhaps, and while this may betray my own lack of knowledge (feel free to tear into me), but I don't think someone who married into the royal family would hold enough power for them to say \"kill her\" and be instantly obeyed. \"Throw her in the dungeon\" I'd buy. \n\nFinally we have the Salem Witch Trials taking place in 1680. And that's wrong too: [Says right here, they started January of 1692](http://www.salemwitchmuseum.com/education/). Nothing else to say-you're 12 years off, boyo.\n\nNow granted, I'm pretty sure the whole point of this commercial is to see Flo constantly get in over her head and hilariously executed. But considering I put this post together in all of 10 minutes, with about 30 seconds of Google searching to find appropriate sources, I just expect a little better fact checking. \n\nIronically, I thought the subtitle for the Salem Witch Trial one read \"New England, *1860*\", which was even worse. Luckily I checked that. ",

        "text": "**Part I: Introduction &amp; Literary Representations of Gallic Nudity in Battle**\n\nMany of you are probably familiar with [images]( https://1-ps.googleusercontent.com/sxk/H-yteF7xn54s0HB9m68W73PZ2M/www.honga.net/lh5.googleusercontent.com/-n4efzv17iWo/Uml9ChzNVtI/AAAAAAAADDM/jjJ53YF2-R8/w1920-h1200-no/2013-10-25_00199.jpg.pagespeed.ce.ipiu_P9DPqxGE-rGm5-H.jpg) [such]( https://ordendruidafintan.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/guerreros-galos-1.jpg) as [these]( http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v486/steppemerc/celt2.jpg), which depict totally butt-naked and buff Gallic warriors recklessly running into combat or thinking about killing some dudes. Exposure from such depictions in paintings, video games and sculptures gives many people the impression that naked combat was a common occurrence in Gallic warfare, as evidenced this really bad [wiki page]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudity_in_combat) and [blog post]( http://www.scottmanning.com/content/concrete-proof-the-gauls-fought-naked/). I would instead argue that depictions of Gallic nudity have their roots less in reality than in Classical depictions of the Gallic body (particularly Hellenistic ones), which were meant to emphasize the Gauls’ reputation as relentless and fearless noble savages. Classical depictions of naked Gauls share another related characteristic: the naked Gaul is always defeated or faces inevitable defeat by the creators of the representation. Naked Gauls are thus less of an accurate representation of reality than propaganda pieces that implicitly exalt Hellenistic or Italic polities/civilizations while honouring the perceived savage nobility of the Gallic warrior.\n\nThe reason I started writing this post was because I was actually doing research to write *another* badhistory post about a website which, among other things, claimed that the ‘Celts’ regularly went into battle naked. Strangely enough, I could find few credible secondary sources on Gallic nudity and decided to look further into the subject. So what primary sources do we have to consult? Unfortunately the Gauls used writing for mundane purposes, curse tablets and calendars but not much else, meaning that we have to rely on Roman and Greek sources, most of them second-hand. \n\nDiodorus and Polybius are the two most-cited authors on the subject of Gallic nudity, but neither author presents a very convincing depiction of regular naked combat amongst the Gauls. Polybius’ recounting of the Battle of Telamon describes how the Gaesatae, who were probably an elite force of unlanded warrior-aristocrats, got naked before battle: \n\n\n&gt;The Insubres and Boii wore their trousers and light cloaks, but the Gaesatae had discarded these garments owing to their proud confidence in themselves, and stood naked, with nothing but their arms, in front of the whole army, thinking that thus they would be more efficient, as some of the ground was overgrown with brambles which would catch in their clothes and impede the use of their weapons. \n\nSo the Gaesatae definitely got undressed before the fight, but Polybius is *very* clear that this had a practical purpose; the ground they were fighting on was covered in brambles and they didn't want to get caught up in them. So we have one concrete example of Gallic nudity in combat, but it has little to do with a regular practice of naked fighting but was instead inspired by battlefield conditions. It may be that the Gauls were more prone than folk like the Romans to undressing before a fight depending on the circumstances, but it was hardly a common occurrence. So what does Diodorus have to say about the subject?\n\nIn his *Library of History*, Diodorus Siculus provides a pretty decent description of Gallic arms and armour, stressing the quality of their shields, bronze helmets and chain mail cuirasses (a novelty invented by the Gauls in Europe and later adopted by the Romans) before stating: \"Some have armour made of iron wrought in chain fashion, while others who fight naked ward off [attacks] by/with what was given to them by nature\" (thanks for the translation /u/celebreth :D). This is a very general statement, written by a man who lived nearly two centuries since the Battle of Telamon, which alongside Classical depictions of the naked Gaul (which I will discuss shortly) probably influenced Diodorus’ statement.\n\nSurely if the Gauls regularly fought naked, a firsthand account of a war with the Gauls would mention it. Interestingly enough, I could find only **one** mention of Gallic nudity in Caesar’s *Commentaries on the Gallic Wars*, which doesn’t even depict a Gaul in battle. In Book 7, Chapter 46, Caesar describes how the Aquitainian king Teutomarus, after being surprised by a Roman assault on his camp “with difficulty escaped from the hands of the plunderers, with the upper part of his person naked, and his horse wounded.” So the one naked Gaul in Caesar's entire account is only partially dressed because he literally had no time to put clothes on before fleeing. Hardly convincing evidence of regular Gallic martial nudity. Why is Caesar’s account’s lack of nudity significant? Because it suggests, I think, that Diodorus’ secondhand account is more reflective of an imaginative picture of Gallic customs than an accurate representation of reality. It is possible that the Gauls of Caesar’s time had simply stopped going into battle naked, but I find the former theory more convincing.\n\n**PART II: Material representations of Gallic junk or lack thereof.**\n\nAs the French medievalist Jacques Le Goff has argued, the imagination is collective and its images are shaped by material processes; it is a collective, social and historical phenomenon. Images or material culture are a good way for us to peer into the historical imagination, which I will do in this section. The reason why I’m bringing up the imagination in this context is because Classical depictions of the Gaul in art correlate with textual representations, while Gallic self-representations in art and sculpture do not. This suggests that Classical literary and material imaginative representations of Gauls heavily influenced one another, meaning that descriptions such as Diodorus’ may be reflections of those imaginative representations.\n\nMost Classical representations of Gauls share a number of tropes that coincide with another description provided by Diodorus. They most often appear naked with facial hair, a characteristic oblong shield and longsword and with long and thick hair resembling a horse’s mane. Most importantly: classical representations of the Gallic warrior almost always portray him in the midst of dying, after having suffered a mortal wound in battle. The best examples are a series of sculptures from the Acropolis of Pergamum: these include [the Dying Gaul]( http://www.bluffton.edu/~sullivanm/italy/rome/capitolinemuseumtwo/0095.jpg), [the Chieftain and His Wife]( https://classconnection.s3.amazonaws.com/850/flashcards/791850/jpg/gallic_chieftain_killing1343188279745.jpg) and the [Chiramonti Head]( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/Head_Gaul_Chiaramonti_Inv1271.jpg). These examples depict a worthy enemy, who is fearless and noble in dying. Although noble, his nakedness and unkempt hair emphasize his barbarity. Compared with a sculpture of a [Persian warrior]( http://m5.i.pbase.com/o3/94/913594/1/112335175.Pf45GpbT.DSC_5866Edit.jpg) (also from Pergamum), the ‘noble savagery’ of the Gallic warrior stands out; unlike the Persian, who cowers with a terrified face, the Dying Gaul has been mortally wounded but seems to be focusing all of his effort on rising again to fight, while the Chieftain kills himself with a completely indifferent and stoic expression. The story behind the head is sort of contentious, as Ersnt Kunzel believed that it represented a Hellenistic general rather than a Gaul. These statues served as visual propaganda of Pergamum’s military supremacy: while the Gauls are exalted as fearless noble savages, they are still depicted as ultimately vanquished by the sculptors’ patrons. It’s sort of similar to American and Commonwealth portrayals of the Waffen-SS as super-duper elite units; it implicitly exalts their own militaries due to the fact that the SS were ultimately defeated.\n\nAnother example can be found in an Etruscan frieze from the 2nd century BCE from Civita Alba, which depicts two naked Gallic warriors with characteristically long hair running in terror from what appear to be Apollo, Athena and Artemis. While these Gauls are not the same kind of noble savage as the Pergamum sculptures, their nudity appears to be a kind of mark of barbarity. While athletic nudity was considered civilized by the Greeks and semi-nudity by the Romans, real or perceived Gallic martial nudity crossed a threshold between civilization and barbarity – instead of being associated with refined and civilized activities, Gallic nudity embodied reckless disregard for one’s body, it was the embodiment of barbaric martial furor.\n\nGallic self-depictions are relatively rare due to the fact that La-Tene art more commonly depicted animals or plants, but some exist. In contrast to the Classical depictions of Gallic warriors, these pieces never feature nudity and showcase more sophisticated personal grooming. For example, the [bronze warrior]( https://spacezilotes.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/clip_image00253.jpg) from St-Maur-en-Chausse depicts a… bronze warrior who is very clearly wearing what looks like a belted tunic and breeches. Another difference between this depiction and Classical ones is the fact that the figure has very neatly combed back hair which appears to be tied into a ponytail. His beard may be an indication of non-aristocratic rank. Similarly, the [Ragstone Head]( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/0f/c7/2c/0fc72caaf6727518f641667a8433e855.jpg) found in Bohemia depicts an unquestionably ‘Celtic’ figure who sports a neatly manicured and curled mustache and neatly combed hair much like that on the Bronze Warrior. The Gundestrup Cauldron, while likely made by Thracians for a Gallic customer, features Gallic motifs and has one notable panel depicting what appears to be a [Gallic military force]( http://www.archeurope.com/uploads/images/Celts/Gundestrup/Gundestrup%20Cauldron%20003.jpg). Like the other two depictions, this panel shows fully clothed foot soldiers, horsemen and trumpeters as well as what could be some kind of deity giving someone a swirly. \n\nThese self-depictions combined with a lack of firsthand accounts of Gallic nudity fly in the face of both material and literary depictions of Gauls in the Classical world. It seems to me that depictions such as Diodorus’ may have a real material basis; it is true that the Gaesatae undressed before battle at Telamon, for example, although their nudity served a practical goal in that context. Classical literary and artistic depictions of the naked Gallic warrior likely fed off of one-another; several instances of Gallic nudity snowballed into a perception that the Gauls regularly fought naked, as many people believe to this day. Both were expressions of an imaginative conception of the Gaul as a noble yet barbaric foe, whose savagery was emphasized by his nudity. In this context, we should understand textual descriptions of common Gallic martial nudity not as realistic illustrations of Continental Celtic military practices but as sources for the role and characteristics of 'barbarian people' in the Classical imagination.",

Week 2 of our glorious campaign to liberate the world from Paganism (a.k.a. Operation Speedy Resolution) has come.\n\nWith [last week's thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2vvvgb/meta_badhistory_universalis_starts_today_1900_utc/) as a base, I will once again provide all relevant and updated information below:\n\n- **You only need the base game**, DLCs are shared by the host.\n\n- Newcomers are welcome, you haven't missed a lot last week. If you want to join just come on in and we'll have a look at what free countries are acceptable for everyone. The starting point was **below 23 base tax** ([list here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19-exn0lHJXro5t2Ndfu2ROVa6S7eSWfAOaRXvIDTP5o/pubhtml)) but I think with last week's progress that can be relaxed a bit possibly.\n\n- We will have **hotjoining enabled** if you are joining later or coming back from a crash. However, as last week has shown, waiting times for refreshing the whole map are a nuisance so we will once again organise them in bulk. So refer to TS/chat for instructions.  \nAlso, we will keep with the \"**no pausing**\" rule. If last week is any measure we won't ever manage to go above speed 2 and might even be downgraded to speed 1 on occasions, wich should leave plenty of time to react.\n\n- The primary means of communication (apart from in-game chat obviously) is [Teamspeak](http://www.teamspeak.com/?page=downloads). Server stuff will be the same as last as we didn't seem to have any problems in that regard.  \nIP: **88.207.244.183** (public server in Luxembourg) - once again, please mention the country you're playing as in your nickname, i.e. \"notamacropus | France\" or similar to make it easier for everyone.\n\n- Due to a problematic start last week regarding hosting I am looking for a volunteer with a good internet connection and all four major DLCs to host if I am once again failing to show up in anyone's multiplayer list. Please post here or send me a PM if you are willing.  \nWhoever the host may end up to be, name and password will stay the same as last week (**Badhistory Universalis**, password: **holyvolcano**) in any case for those wondering.  \nFor the final instructions and probably for joining off of the person in question please join the [steam group chat](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/badhistory) before game start as it will make stuff *a lot* easier.  \n**EDIT:** Looks like hosting works today for me. So until it turns out streaming and hosting simultaneously crashes both I will be ~~your god and master~~ host for this session. If it works for you, join from the list, otherwise come to the Steam group chat, open the drop-down menu next to me and *join game* from there. Also, [download save game first to speed things up considerably.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-wd3V08eZhVby1EblFtN0Y0cDg/view)\n\n- As with last week, **I will try and provide a stream** for those without the game or the means or motivation to join in [on my Twitch](http://www.twitch.tv/notamacropus). Experience from last week has shown that my connection should be stable enough to handle it, but expect mediocre quality at best. Any other streamers are more than welcome to provide me their details and I'll add them here.\nEDIT: http://www.twitch.tv/jackalskull as well\n\nSo... what happened so far?\n\nThe year is 1460. [Europe, as always, is a right mess.](http://i.imgur.com/1YZ2XGJ.png) Leinster, taking advantage of the English War of the Roses taking them out of the Emerald Isle, has laid claims on puny Connacht.  \nThe mighty nation of Ryazan to the East, nestled between hostile superpowers, has been ravaged and enslaved by the Golden Horde and subsequently been declared lost and abandoned. Even tinier colleague Navarra on the other hand scored an alliance with Castille, which they unleashed on an unsuspecting Aragon to expand thricefold. Meanwhile the Livonians became a Swiss predator, going after the weak and easy prey around them while staying out of international matters.\n\nInside the most Holy Roman Empire, the Elector Palatinate as well as Hesse and Brunswick are ever growing, although flinching at every mention of the world Ulm.  \nFinally, Pomerania is still doing well for itself, even after its ruler abandoned it after misreading and starting a war with almost everyone, including the likes of Poland-Lithuania and Austria.\n\nIn America, Huron is expanding. See [here](http://i.imgur.com/PYbWFtk.png). Otherwise nothing noteworthy has happened yet as civilisation hasn't arrived so far.\n\nFrom our Asian war correspondent /u/Cyanfunk:\n\n&gt; - Haixi asserts dominance over the Jinazhou and Wild Jurchens, also Korchin and the Buryats are there.\n- Brunei enjoys private island while waiting for Admin 4 because apparently it is that difficult to build a boat and put people on it.\n- Ava and Pegu truck right along in the Indochinese Thunderdome, everyone mocks Ava for having uncreative naming schemes.\n- Oman beats up Najd and Hedjaz humiliates Yemen by stealing their Red Sea ports.\n- Sind gets its lunch money stolen by three random OPMs; Sindhi patriots form a new country.\n- Mewar asserts dominance over the failing Delhi state.\n- U-Tsang, the real star of the show, takes 80 loans fighting Kham and random OPMs, loses two provinces to fuckin' Koch, and bankrupts itself into a Republican Dicatorship.\n- Ming is still solid with no rebels in sight.\n\nEast Asia [here](http://i.imgur.com/gaPaDYk.png) and a more western view [here](http://i.imgur.com/V4gre5U.png). Powerful pictures. That burning Tibetian monk is nothing in comparison.\n\nThis is all for now. Good luck. And don't forget: /r/badhistory expects every user to do his duty!",

So naturally I'm going to use this as a springboard to reiterate why Germany is the furthest thing from the victim in the run-up to World War One. Huzzah for beating dead horses!\n\n&gt;Did they also start the arms race? Or the practice of owning colonies. You can't possibly just point at Germany and say 'it's all their fault'. Otherwise you're just like the Treat of Versailles.\n\n/u/elos_ had descended from his Ivory tower to shower his wealth of information on the common-folk, when out from the crowd roared an individual that repeated our favorite piece of badhistory: Germany never wanted World War One! Indeed they were simply getting in [late to the party](http://np.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/2wjgl4/german_propaganda_map_of_the_allies_colonial/corkqsj) of Colonialism and Arms proliferation; and the nasty upper classmen didn't want Germany to fit in! Nasty Hobbitsses! They tricked us! \n\nGermany as the victim is a topic so often brought up here that I'm amazed any of us have functioning livers; but there was something about the logic in this comment chain that actually got me off my rear-end to make this little thread. The entire, disingenuous idea of 'they did it first, therefore...' is the same kind of political thought that got Germany into the shit-storm of WWI to begin with. /u/elos_ sums it up best when he says that WWI was a direct result of Germany attempting to usurp traditional European powers. The logic, therefore, that Germany was somehow 'forced' into doing so is akin to saying that a thief who breaks into a house for its valuables would never have had to do so if the owners did not have said valuables. Its rhetoric and logic that belongs in the head of a 15 year old having a particularly good run at Crusader Kings II. \n\n[This](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2o5rs5/why_did_germany_get_all_the_blame_for_wwi_when_it/cmk2547) post by elos_ sums it up best.\n\n&gt;...it's been a while since I've heard someone lay the blame on Russia and I don't think it's a particularly fair one. We must remember that, first and foremost, blame does not rely firstly on who threw the first punch. It's the \"I'm not hitting you\" conundrum. If you have a bully following someone around poking someones sides gently all day and saying horrible things to them and the kid receiving the bullying eventually has enough, turns around, and decks him would anyone reasonably blame the kid being bullied as the instigator or 'starting it'?\n\nEveryone, shame /u/elos_ for the filthy victim blamer he is! How dare you come prepared to an argument with academic sources, sound logic and a firm grasp of historical context? Who do you think you *are*?\n\nThe idea remains that Germany chose to escalate to conflict on the European continent; and that the situation developing in 1914 was very much in line with its desires and political goals: Which was to break into the 'world power scene' and become precisely that; a world power. In another excellent post from elos_ from the depths of time, he explains the concept of *Weltmach* and how this inferiority complex sparked a four year long bloodbath.\n\n&gt;Kaiser Willhelm and frankly the German people as a whole were incredibly insecure about their status in the world. They were less than 50 years old at this point and were bordered by nations which had been around for almost a thousand and at times can trace their history back even further. They had no great national history or prestige to work off of as a unified Germany. They also came into the game in 1871 -- well after the 16th and 17th century colonial rushes. They had no colonies. Germany is a notably isolated region and as the industrial leader relied on foreign imports to keep its factories churning out goods but perhaps equally important is the concept of prestige. \n\nI want to grasp on the last part. *Prestige*; the Reich probably could've continued to power forwards as an industrial leader but the idea of having to rely on resources they did not control, in contrast to Great Britian, for example, was so *agonizing* for them that a belligerent stance seemed natural. elos_ is quick to grasp on this, and continues...\n\n&gt;Wilhelm II embarked on a policy of \"Weltmahct,\" or world power. A common turn of phrase in Germany was \"Weltmacht oder Niedergang,\" world power or downfall. \n\nThese are not the words of a victim. These are the words of a belligerent, bellicose government chomping at the bit to secure, through force of military arms, a better place in the world for themselves.\n\nPS: Low hanging fruits oft taste the sweetest :-)\n\n\nEDIT: I'm going to add a conversation with venuswasaflytrap that expands my point. He asks:\n\n&gt;Is the bad history here entirely a philosophical argument about blame, or are there some facts being misrepresented or are in dispute?\n\nI reply:\n\n&gt;Both.\nThe shitposter in question who accuses our valiant hero of being literally the Treaty of Versailles is using a poor grasp of the facts and even worse understanding of the concept of aggression to make his case.\nFirst, Germany begun the arms-race leading up to WWI by rapidly and deliberately expanding its Navy's military mission past coastal defense and into world power projection; loosely based on American doctrine that forced the reopening of Japan to international trade some years earlier. This was more than a nation expanding its military capability, this was a nation deliberately grooming hitherto one of its worst arms to rival its main 'opponent' - Great Britain. So he's already in the red when it comes to coherency with the 'arms race' not-so-rhetorical question.\nFurthermore the idea that Germany 'didn't hit the first domino over' to use his metaphor, completely glosses over their deliberate escalation of the conflict. Connect the dots in the following timeline:\n\n&gt;1) Austria-Hungary delivers ultimatum to Serbia\n\n&gt;2) Russia mobilizes\n\n&gt;3) Germany violates Belgian neutrality with the intent to outflank France's border defenses.\n\n&gt;Its like someone had a rather heavy night of drinking and did the World Politic parody of The Hangover. Germany immediately engages France over what is initially a Balkan dispute because they sensed the opportunity to do so, gambling that they could smash France and then turn about to ruin Russia. Yet the entire fallacy here is that the Entente in truth had nothing but a defensive alliance against German aggression; Great Britain in particular had long ago stopped attempting to intervene in the Balkan sick-man of Europe. There was no reason in relation to the Serbian incident to attack France. However, it met with Germany's long-term political goals and they had an excuse to use that hair-trigger of theirs. Germany's actions only served to trigger defensive alliances and ententes that rapidly expand the conflict. So no, they didn't just 'tip the first domino' over; they set it on fire and launched it over the Belgian border.",

Hooray, *292* upvotes. ([snapshot](http://i.imgur.com/bLFATmz.png) )\n\n&gt; TIL, the last Empress of Korea was assassinated and burnt by the Japanese in 1895\n\nOkay, so it is true that Queen Min was assassinated by Japanese assassins in August 20, 1895, and it is also true that her corpse was burnt.\n\n&gt; last Empress of Korea\n\nThese four words are the problem.\n\nFirst, I'm not comfortable with the word \"Empress\" here.\n\nThe \"Empress\" s/he refers to is [Queen Min](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Myeongseong), now generally referred to as \"Empress Myeongseong.\" \n\n**However**, Queen Min died in 1895. In 1895, Korea was still ruled by a king, not an emperor. The Empire of Korea would not be proclaimed until October 12, 1897, more than two years after the death of Queen Min. Queen Min herself would not be given the posthumous title of \"empress\" until 1902. \n\nBut since it is true that she posthumously became known as an \"Empress,\" let's give /u/Curiouslotionbottle a pass on this. Now, is it true that the Japanese killed the *last* Empress of Korea in 1895?\n\nGojong himself did not take another wife, but he had [a concubine](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Princess_Consort_Sunheon.JPG) who was for all intents and purposes the empress. Furthermore, [Sunjong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunjong_of_Korea), who was the last emperor of Korea, also had an empress ([Empress Sunjeong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Sunjeong) ). Queen Min was never an empress while she was alive, and she was definitely not the \"last empress\" in any way. It's a shame that a statement with blatant inaccuracies can give you nearly 300 link karma.\n\nBut it's Reddit, what do I expect?",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2wdvtp/its_tough_to_show_history_how_the_road_to_el/",
        "text": "There's actually quite a few things wrong with [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYprdmE1dFc) from the movie \"The Road to El Dorado.\" For one thing, the words are kind of awkward to sing since they get jumbled together, and since I'm pretty sure Kenneth Branagh isn't quite in my range. It's just not Elton John's best work, even if it is damn catchy. What's more egregious, though, is its representation of various aspects of Mesoamerican - and specifically Aztec - culture. There's a number of things to look at here, and I'll take them one at a time.\n\nFirst, there's [this bit](http://i.imgur.com/hbMjem3.png) roughly ten seconds in. Giant fish and crocodiles fly across the screen in what I'm pretty sure are meant to be kites. Either that, or they're particularly detailed and malevolent clouds sent by the actual gods, one or the other. The trouble is, though, that if they're kites, they shouldn't be there. Kites were invented in China, though when exactly, we're not sure. The earliest written record of a kite being flown comes from 200 BCE when General Han Hsin flew a kite over the walls of a city to determine how far under the walls his troops would have to tunnel. However, given how the kite was being used, it's very likely that kites had been used earlier in Chinese history, but not recorded. The first record of a kite outside Asia is probably from Marco Polo in the 13th century, though it's possible Polynesian use of kites also goes back to this point (certainly Maoris have been flying kites since the 17th century). However, the first kites to fly in Europe didn't do so until the 16th century when merchants brought them back from Malaysia and Japan. It wasn't until the 18th century that people actually started being interested in kits, and then, only for research purposes. While I can't say when exactly the first kite arrived in Mesoamerica, it was probably after the conquistadors did. \n\nWhat I think is the more interesting bad history can perhaps best be summed up by [this image](http://i.imgur.com/bYRaj2J.png) from thirty seconds into the video. Here we see our protagonists drinking some sort of Mesoamerican alcoholic beverage (at least I'm pretty sure it's alcoholic, but a little more on that later). Native peoples of Central and South America had lots of different alcoholic beverages, but the two that seem the most likely candidates for what exactly they're drinking are *chicha* and *pulque.* \n\nWe'll start with *chicha.* *Chicha* is a fermented maize drink, though it can be made out of roots as well. *Chicha* looks like [this](http://www.machupicchu-inca.com/images/chicha-morada.jpg), [this](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XUJWqP7D0Vg/TfV5XGipBOI/AAAAAAAAAEM/w97DNp6476o/s1600/chicha-de-pina1jpg.jpg), or [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Chicha_maiz_morado.jpg). I admit, talking about it is cheating a little as it's more a South American beverage than a Mesoamerican one, but it is pretty cool, and so I'll talk about it if I want to. \n\nWhile I'm aware the phrase \"since time immemorial\" is a problematic one and not terribly historical, it's a phrase I feel is very apt for describing how old *chicha* and its production is. It's theorised, for example, that some of the earliest South American pottery was made specifically to hold *chicha*, and that's been dated to at least 5000 BCE. It played a huge role as a semi-sacred beverage. It was used during sacrifices and given as a sacrifice to the gods. Human sacrifices, for instance, would be bathed in *chicha* dregs and force-fed *chicha* to prepare them to be acceptable sacrifices. During religious feasts, people would drink prodigious amounts of *chicha* for days on end, replete with dancing and music. It's exactly the sort of mad celebration that we see in the video. The trouble, is though, that they're not drinking *chicha.* *Chicha* isn't pink. \n\nThis brings me to the other possible candidate for what they're drinking - pulque. Pulque served more or less the same role as *chicha* in that it was seen as a sacred beverage. Indeed, the mythological origin story of pulque is too good not to share. According to Mesoamerican myth - we see the same god in both Zapotec and Aztec mythology, so I'm reluctant to attribute it to one or the other - the great possum god Tlacuache was digging around in the dirt when he found the maguey plant. Excited by this, he kept digging until he got to the sap within. He decided to store this in some gourds and forget about it, through which he discovered fermentation and pulque. He was super excited about this, and drank all of it at once, getting horrifically drunk and messing up the paths of otherwise straight rivers because that's what possums do what they're drunk. He then shared pulque with everyone because drunk possums are well-known for sharing their many bounties.\n\nMore historically, the first record we have of pulque comes from a mural that dates back to roughly 1000 CE called the \"[Pulque Drinkers.\"](http://abrock.com/MexicoWeb/Cholula/DrinkersMerge1.jpg) However, it's probably true that pulque wasn't a new thing. The maguey from which pulque derives certainly held an esteemed place in Mesoamerican mythology, having been a sacred plant for quite a while. It's possible that pulque is around 2000 years old, but once again, there's no real way to know for sure (though we do have a stone carving that probably depicts pulque, and which dates to around 200 CE). \n\nThere are a few key differences between *chicha* and pulque beyond the colour. While *chicha* was something that could be drunk by the masses, albeit during religious events and feasts, pulque was much more class segregated. It was primarily drunk by priests and members of the upper class, and even then, primarily as part of religious ritual or in celebration of victories. The only real exception to this was that victims of sacrifice would be given some to make them more amenable to being sacrificed. Commoners, too, might occasionally get some on special occasions, but even then, it was limited to the elderly and pregnant women. \n\nPulque was also much harder to make than *chicha,* which undoubtedly at least partly contributed to the difference in how it was viewed. Pulque required that the maguey plant from which it was derived be at least twelve years old, and even then, only the best plants would produce sap for more than a year. This sap then had to be fermented for at least a year, a tricky process all around. *Chicha* on the other hand, could be made from fermented yams, manioc, or maize, and was more widely available. \n\nPulque was also much less potent than *chicha,* being only 3-4% alcohol compared to *chicha's* 10%. This means that even if was imbibed in large quantities, it probably still wouldn't give the effects we see in the video. It's just not strong enough to make it happen.\n\nIf gods had come to visit Mesoamericans, it's not inconceivable that they would have been given one of these two drinks, depending on where they ended up. However, the drink in the video is clearly not either of them. It has something pink and strong, which describes neither pulque nor *chicha.* That said, the idea of parties with tons of drinking was not necessarily unknown to Mesoamericans, though it would have been substantially less common for the Aztecs than for the Inca. \n\nYou know what was more common for the Aztecs, though? Hallucinogens. There were - and still are - so many hallucinogens used in Mesoamerica that would make [this](http://i.imgur.com/R0tQdJG.png) a reasonable thing to see. Things like teonanacatl and ololiuhqui were used in rituals for their hallucinogenic properties, and other plants like water lilies and peyote were used to achieve psychoactive trance states. Hell, there were ritual enemas using psychotropic plants recorded throughout Maya, Zapotec, Olmec, and Aztec history, and archaeological evidence found in tombs and temples can date the practice of using plants in ritual back to at least 3000 BCE. Toad-licking, mushroom-consuming, and trancing were all valid religious activities that were common among Mesoamerican priests and shamans, though not as much from the commoners. Like pulque and *chicha*, using these plants was a sacred thing and used as a way to communicate with the gods and solve spiritual problems. It wasn't for funsies, but it's not inconceivable that it could have been used if a priest, a king, and a god all had a party together. \n\nReally, the video itself is chock full of things, and there's so much to nitpick that it's hard to know where to stop. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/BFLzvxN.png), for instance, we see warriors handing out watermelons to happy kids. Watermelons are native to Africa, and wouldn't have been in America at this point. And throughout, there are pan pipes. Panpipes are a South American instrument, and didn't exist in Central America. There are different instruments there. They aren't panpipes.\n\nI appreciate that the video tries to depict a bit of Mesoamerica, but it gets it wrong. The type of party it's showing is much closer to one that might have been found in South America, not Central America. The Aztec social structure would never have allowed for the mass consumption of hallucinogens or pulque, though each would have been used by a particular group. It's just a bit of a mess, but an interesting one nonetheless.\n\nSources:\n\nAs always, \"A History of Food\" by Reay Tannahill\n\n[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1ya99h/before_contact_with_europeans_were_there_any/) from /r/AskHistorians is great, as is [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/14lq6l/did_native_americans_ever_produce_alcohol/). \n\n[This article](http://www.elsevier.es/en-revista-neurologia-495-articulo-hallucinogenic-drugs-in-pre-columbian-mesoamerican-90379063) from Neurologia is all about what hallucinogenic drugs were used in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica.

        "text": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/whose-history-is-it-anyway-1424215458\n\nIn short, this article shows that in hollywood and in the public, there is a big backlash against \"historical pedantry” asking them to stick to the “facts” of whatever historical matter they are trying to capture in film. WSJ outlines two reasons for this anima \n\n* 1) History is just stories and facts aren't \"Truth\" anyway, so why hold film to standards of objective Truth that history itself can't attain (one variant on the postmodern fallacy). \n* 2) Art should have different standards than history! Picasso didn't REALLY think nude people walking down stairs looked like a beige pile of angles! Sheesh!\n\nYeah, the postmodern fallacy is a big problem and one I continue to look for a solution to that is satisfying to me. On the one hand, all history is are a collected, agreed-upon cannon stories and interpretations of the facts (selected from thousands of other stories, with different causal emphases, etc., that plausibly could have also been derived from our limited knowledge of the past   . . . . some less plausibly than others, but none certain). And even if we are not talking about History (capital H) certainly different historical actors in time have experienced and perceived events differently than the texts might conclude . . .  which doesn’t mean that either the text or the person is incorrect, per se. (I’m thinking of how Joe McCartin has talked about how many of the labor leaders he interviewed for his book about the air controllers' strike were upset and disagreed with his book, Collision Course . . . as were many of the Reagan bureaucrats he interviewed!)\n\nOn the other hand, that is why we have historians; we spend a frick-ton of time accumulating training and expertise to do history as best we can. And that is NOT antithetical to art or artistic interpretations! (Interpretation is at the HEART of the best histories - no one has ever become a famous historian by listing facts.)\n\nMy big question is why it has become so chic-chic to play with the facts of history ‘because we are so cool and postmodern and our art is more important/evocative/aesthetic than the facts’ (the historian can tell you true art is finding depth, importance, and meaning in the facts as such - anyone can make up your own!) — while at the same time everyone is EAGER to have their films be as scientifically accurate as possible. While Eric Foner’s lightly critical review of Lincoln made people roll their eyes at academic pedantics, Neil DeGrasse Tyson’s take-down of Titanic’s stars has everyone cheering in their seats! Don’t get me wrong, I love Neil DeGrasse Tyson, but one of the reasons I love him is because in the Cosmos series, he totally tackles how science is political and constructed (. . . even as he veers into positivism at other times . . .). \n\nYeah, science is made of theories, just as history is made of interpretations! This should be degrading to neither endeavor; both of them use the best evidence they can as building blocks. But why are people getting skeptical over the merits of communicating good history in film, but racing to show the most/best science in their movies at the same time?\n\nI think the article does an excellent job of explaining the motivations for hating history on the part of directors, even as they stake their claims to it more tenaciously than ever, cranking out a huge number of historical films:\n&gt;Actually, if these films didn’t make such claims on history, they would get considerably less attention. History, they insist, matters. But some also claim its mantle disingenuously, in order to give authority to their manipulations. Fact-checking is important because it helps disclose what is being changed and why.\n\n[Of course, the WSJ goes on to do some \"bad history\" debunking of their own which is spurious at best. Lyndon Johnson was an ass and a control freak, and who am I to say that a fictionalized portrayal of that is any worse than a white-knight version? It is true that he worked HARD to pass the Equal Rights Amendment in the end, though -- not that the WSJ would cite any facts themselves, that would illustrate this, such as the 2AM calls to his aides the night before the final vote conferring on whose votes they do and don't have secured.]\n\nOk, rant over? Rant over? Unless you get me going again in the comments!\n\n",

        "text": "Ah, Cracked. Some days your cool Robert Evans articles and After Hours can't help you: http://www.cracked.com/article_22138_5-longtime-mysteries-history-that-experts-cant-explain.html\n\nAnyway, this will be fairly low effort:\n\n&gt;#5. We Don't Know What the Ancient Egyptians Actually Looked Like\n\nWell, first off, Egyptians were not white, black or whatever because these are ideological terms created during colonialism: Australian Aboriginals are sometimes called \"black\" but they are genetically one of the most distinct human populations on earth. But that aside, we still can't tell what the Egyptians looked like because of the highly stylized skin tones [*oh wait*](https://uncouthreflections.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/sowing-and-ploughing-in-the-fields-wall-painting-tomb-of-sennedjem-13th-century-b-c.jpg). Egyptians could deploy stylized skin tones for specific purposes (in the case in the article, I suspect to mark divinity), but they tended to stay within realistic bands.\n\nOh course I should deal with one particular question: were the Egyptian what we would call black? [Some of them, undoubtedly](http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_image.aspx?image=ps343676.jpg&amp;retpage=15491). The Nile was a highway running through the Sahara, and so ancient Egypt must have been what we would consider multiethnic: although that is more a result of *our* racial hangups than Egyptian culture, because Egypt was actually a rather xenophobic and insular society. It cut across *our* racial boundaries, but not theirs.\n\nIt is also worth highlighting their claim that the current ethnic makeup of Egypt was a result of the Persian invasion, which is a new one as more often people put the finger on the Arab one. The Persian invasion did have some population transfer, most famously a garrison of Jewish soldier/settlers at Elaphantine, but I can't think of any major population displacement. The Persians did use population transfer as a strategy, just not with Egypt.\n\n&gt;#4. There Are Giant Stone Heads in Central America, and We Have No Idea How They Got There\n\nThe Olmecs put them there. How? Rollers, probably. How did they get through the jungle? Rollers, probably. Also it wasn't jungle, due to the people living there. Next.\n\n&gt;#3. There Is a Huge Network of Mysterious, Man-Made Caves in China\n\nNow this one (the Longyou Caves) actually is pretty interesting and I have generally been unable to find information on it, I suspect because it is published in Chinese. It is worth noting that the designation of \"Chinese\" is something of a misnomer, as the caves seem to date from the Warring States period, when the region was inhabited by what are somewhat vaguely known as the *Baiyue*, essentially the term for the various non-Chinese people inhabiting what is now southern China. This may actually have been constructed by the Yue Kingdom, although I can't say that without a clearer hold on the geography and dating.\n\nBut, more importantly, this explains away this mysterious lack of records so ballyhooed in the article: why did the Chinese not keep bureaucratic records of building it? Well, probably because they didn't build it. Next.\n\n&gt;#We Can't Read One of History's Most Important Languages\n\nThis is all about Etruscan, and it is true that we don't have a firm grasp on it, but we do have a decent vocabulary an a reasonably grasp of the grammar. Still, if only we had some sort of Rosetta Stone like inscription in which the language was inscribed in Etruscan and a language that we know [*oh wait*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrgi_Tablets). Yes, yes, once again Cracked fails to do basic research. In fact, arguably our main problem in deciphering the rest of the language is that we simply do not have the sort of long, extended texts that were the key to deciphering Egyptian, Sumerian and other languages. The majority of the Etruscan corpus are short votive or dedicatory inscriptions, which doesn't give the sort of context neccesary to solve the puzzle.\n\nBeyond that, the article *absurdly* magnifies the importance of the Etruscans, which i hate saying because I am rather fond of them. I mean, one of the most important languages? Please. In the list of things the article claims the Etruscans invented, \"aqueducts, city planning, sewers, bridges, and metallurgy\" aqueducts, city planning and sewers were actually examples of Greek influence. Granted, it was once argued that these were spread to Rome through the Etruscans, but the past couple decades of research has shown that Rome was a fairly well connected city even during the regal period and so there is no reason to need some Etruscan intermediary. Bronze metallurgy had been present in Italy for perhaps a thousand years before anything we can call \"the Etruscans\" existed. Iron is a bit more complicated, as the early Iron Age culture of eastern and central Italy is called the \"Villanovan\", and while it is with good reason correlated with the Etruscans it and its descendants have a spread beyond Etruscan territories in historical times. Correlating it to the historical ethno-linguistic group the Etruscans is undoubtedly a vast oversimplification of a messy reality.\n\nBridges were invented when the first dude put a log across a creek. But maybe it is referring to the grand, Roman arch bridges? In that case, I don't know of any Etruscan examples of that. Why does everybody want to deny the Romans ever invented anything?\n\n&gt;#1. The \"Sea Peoples\" Destroyed Virtually Every Major City of the Ancient World ... and We Have No Idea Who They Were\n\nThe Sea People are legitimately a bit mysterious, although their historical effect here is absurdly overstated: they did not destroy almost every city of the ancient world, and suggesting that they were a unified group that went from kingdom to kingdom destroying all in their wake imposes a false uniformity upon the very messy historical record. They weren't a single group that appeared at a single time, they were more likely several groups impelled towards mass population movement by similar historical circumstances.\n\nNow, there are quite a few mistakes here, but the most hilarious is that the author seems to think that Anatolia is a city. I'm not joking:\n\n&gt;The first place to face the wrath of the mysterious invaders was the city of Anatolia in modern-day Turkey. By all accounts, Anatolia was one of the most powerful cities in the region\n\nI am in awe.",

        "text": "Or: Private tutition does not real.\n\n[This](http://np.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/2v6lfm/stereotypes_of_the_uk_from_a_north_londoners/cof0r9g) purports to be an explanation of the term \"public school\" in British English (which, for those of you who speak American or Australian English, refers to a kind of private school. \"State school\" is the term used to refer to a publically funded school). Unfortunately, it's... wrong.\n\n&gt; By the 16th century, all schooling in England was private, and was carried out by Church-run educational establishments.\n\nThe first English school to be independent of the church was Winchester (1382). It still exists. The earliest schools independent of the church were closely linked to the universities (Eton College is another famous example of this type), but in 1503 Bridgnorth Grammar school was founded, which was linked to Bridgnorth Borough Corporation -- that is, the town of Bridgnorth.\n\n&gt;  If you were a Catholic, or Jewish, or even the wrong kind of Protestant, then it didn't matter how much money you had, you couldn't get your sons educated in England.\n\nWell, unless they got into a school not affiliated with the church, or, you know, were tutored at home. Like literally every member of the royal family was until Prince Charles. \n\nEdward VI even set up a number of free grammar schools, which were in theory open to all regardless of wealth, in the 16th century.\n\n&gt; Come the Enlightenment, and wealthy, progressive people considered this to be somewhat unfair, and set up schools which didn't care what religion you were. In other words they were open to any member of the public (as long as you had the money for the fees) and hence were known as Public Schools. Over the next few centuries some of these became immensely successful and as the Church's influence was on the wane, eventually nearly all schools followed the Public School model.\n\nThe Age of Enlightenment is generally considered to have begun somewhere between 1650 and 1700, and ended with the French Revolution of 1789. Schools (such as the Edward VI schools, of which a huge number still exist, many named after him) already took any member of the public, and the free grammar schools didn't even charge fees. \n\nThe first uses of the term \"Public School\" cited in the OED go back to 1580. Certainly pre-Enlightenment.\n\n(If you want to look at a more restrictive definition of \"public schools\", they are the schools either which are part of the HMC (Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference), set up 1869, or which are in the Public Schools' Act (1868). By this definition, the Public School is a post-Enlightenment phenomenon, though based off of existing charity and free grammar schools which go back to the fourteenth century.)\n\nSo the more narrowly defined use of the term public school refers to a number of specific schools, and dates back to 1868; the more loosely defined term dates back at least to 1580 and refers to schools which have existed since the 1380s. However you slice it, the Enlightenment has fuck-all to do with it. Of course, that doesn't fit well with the chartist narrative of stupid repressive religion until the age of enlightenment, and then secular advances from that point onwards.",

        "text": "Hey everyone! Long time lurker, first time poster.\n\nI was scrolling down my dashboard on Tumblr, as I often do when avoiding sleep like the irresponsible undergraduate that I am, when I came across [this image.](https://40.media.tumblr.com/c18abd6e2f1ca867fe61e6957617db7a/tumblr_njvlz6Jgo91qhodu2o1_1280.jpg) It's a picture of George Washington's dentures with a caption reading \"George Washington's wooden teeth is a myth. In reality, he had his dentures fitted with teeth pulled from slaves.\" I thought this seemed a little suspect given the phrasing and Tumblr's fondness for exaggeration and general badhistory (medievalPOC posts are ridiculously popular) so I decided to investigate.\n\nI googled \"did George Washington's teeth come from slaves\" and read[ the first link on the page](http://www.mountvernon.org/george-washington/the-man-the-myth/the-trouble-with-teeth/), from the Mount Vernon website, which says\n&gt;Deep within one of Washington’s account books is an entry which details Washington’s purchase of 9 teeth from “Negroes” for 122 shillings. It’s not clear if Washington intend to use these teeth as implants or within a new set of dentures or if he employed the teeth at all. While this transaction might seem morbid to a modern audience, purchasing human teeth was a fairly common practice in the 18th century for affluent individuals.\n\nAfter reading this, I wanted to see if any more information was available, so I hit [the second link on the search page](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/jefferson/video/lives.html) which said the following:\n&gt;Slaves of the eighteenth century sometimes turned to the perfectly acceptable means of making money by selling their teeth to dentists. Since at least the end of the Middle Ages, poor people had often sold their teeth for use in both dentures and in tooth-transplant operations for those wealthy enough to afford the procedures. Sometimes the teeth were perfectly healthy; others were diseased and needed to be pulled anyway. In 1780 a French dentist named Jean Pierre Le Moyer (also called Le Mayeaur, Le Mayeur, and Joseph Lemaire) came to America, possibly as a naval surgeon with the French forces commanded by the Comte de Rochambeau, and over the next decade treated patients in New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Alexandria, and Richmond. He seems to have had an extensive practice in tooth transplants, but the results of the procedure were short-lived, usually less than one or two years. Transplantable teeth were hard to come by, and in 1783 Le Moyer even went so far as to advertise in the New York papers for \"persons disposed to sell their front teeth, or any of them,\" netting the donor two guineas (forty-two shillings) per tooth. In Richmond, he offered anyone but slaves a similar amount for their front teeth. Technical problems made it impossible to transplant molars, so the operation was probably useful primarily for cosmetic reasons. Le Moyer first treated George Washington's teeth at his military headquarters in 1783.\n\n&gt;The following year, in May of 1784, Washington paid several unnamed \"Negroes,\" presumably Mount Vernon slaves, 122 shillings for nine teeth, slightly less than one-third the going rate advertised in the papers, \"on acct. of the French Dentis [sic} Doctr. Lemay [sic],\" almost certainly Le Moyer. Over the next four years, the dentist was a frequent and apparently favorite guest on the plantation. Whether the Mount Vernon slaves sold their teeth to the dentist for any patient who needed them or specifically for George Washington is unknown, although Washington's payment suggests that they were for his own use. Washington probably underwent the transplant procedure--\"I confess I have been staggered in my belief in the efficacy of transplantion,\" he told Richard Varick, his friend and wartime clerk, in 1784--and thus it may well be that some of the human teeth implanted to improve his appearance, or used to manufacture his dentures, came from his own slaves.\n\nFrom this we know a few things: Selling teeth was not uncommon, George Washington paid slaves for their teeth, and these teeth may have been used in his dentures. So, technically, the image I found is at least partly correct. Some of George Washington's denture teeth may have come from the mouths of slaves. That said, the statement that \"...he had his dentures fitted with teeth pulled from slaves\" is a half-truth and an obvious appeal to emotion.\n\nI was especially disappointed by this given that I only had to read the first two links from a google search to discover both the utter lack of context given by the original poster and that said context is extremely important.\n\n(Unsure if this is R2 here, but) I feel that this sort of post is all too common on Tumblr. This factoid is not being used to generate discussion, it's being used to vilify someone who Tumblr is already skeptical of. On reddit, I've been out of the major subreddits for a couple years because of the volume of circlejerks but Tumblr is no better; it's just that their jerks are of the \"angry inaccurate sjw\" variety.\n\nDoes anyone have any more information on how common the practice of slaves selling teeth was or any more information about George Washington's dentures and tooth purchasing habits? I would love to learn more about these things.\n\nEDIT: After looking around the subreddit, I rediscovered u/NMW's excellent post on second-option bias and realized that this seems the likeliest motivator behind posts like the one I discuss.\n\nEDIT 2: Thought about adding stuff but posted it in the comments instead.",
