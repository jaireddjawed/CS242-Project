But he also mentions that the reason it was clear is that the pressure cooker prevents the rolling boil necessary to emulsify the extracted solids. So could you do the pressure cooker, then open it up and bring it to a rolling boil for an additional half an hour if you really wanted the opaqueness?  If that wouldn't add the opaqueness, then as long as the flavor is there, I think I'd still stick with the pressure cooker.  \n\nInterested in your guys' thoughts! Thanks",

If I'm uncomfortable with subscriptions, will this exclusive content ever be packaged in a book, magazine or other format? \n\nFor SE writers and staffers who might be here, what are your thoughts? Are you excited about the new platform and revenue? Worried about dividing your content? \n\nEither way, I want to be clear that I love serious eats.

I'm look at the Food Lab cook book recipe for Chili Paste and it asks for 6 ancho/pasilla/mulato chiles and 3 New Mexico/California/costeño/choricero chiles. \n\nCool, not a problem, however for the ancho group it says \"(about 1/2 oz)\" and for the New Mexico group \"(about 1/8 oz)\" next the the number of chiles. Well, my chiles are quite a bit heavier than these when I toss them on a scale and I'm not quite sure what measurement I should go by.\n\nPerhaps I'm overthinking this, but if I could get some input, it would be nice. Also, I should mention I'm using pasilla-ancho and California for my specific batch.\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "[Recipe](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/12/pasta-carbonara-sauce-recipe.html)\n\nI've made a spaghetti carbonara once before (think it was a Food Network recipe) and it was probably my most favorite dish I've made. So last night I tried the Serious Eats version. As I'm now (mostly) vegetarian, I substituted seared, chopped portobellos for the bacon component. So I know flavor is lost there, but let's set that aside. Other than that sub, I did 1.5x the recipe, and otherwise I stuck the course.\n\nIn the end I was left was a carbonara that looks perfect, to my knowledge, but was very bland, even with proper salt. As there are so few components to the dish, I'm leaning towards thinking it was the cheese. My parmesan in particular I thought tasted a little bland as I was grating it, possibly because it was in the fridge for a while... I'm not sure if cheese loses flavor over time.\n\nMy other question is how exactly grated cheese is measured. Looking back on the recipe, I was silly for not simply using my scale. I was rushing through and saw the 1/4c measurements, so went with that. Between the two cheeses, I ended up with 1c (1.5x recipe should've been 3/4c total) after grating them with a microplane. Thinking more is better than less, I put in the whole cup. Yet my end result was horribly bland and not at all cheesy. \n\nAgain I feel stupid for not weighing as that would've eliminated any confusion. Still though I'm wondering if there's a certain technique in measuring grated cheese, as it could be incredibly fluffy (or dense powder like store bought).\n\nAside from possibly screwing up the cheese measurement, is there anything else that could've prevented me from obtaining a creamy, flavorful sauce? Is there any way to save what I have left?\n\nedit: for anyone interested, since it sounds like a possible combination of so many things (inaccurate measurements, cheese quality, fat content) I'm going to just try to repeat the recipe again with the various fixes and see how things turn out.

So I made some mayo and added it to the hellmans to make up the difference.  Mayo overall turned out well, I think I salted far too much and maybe just a tiny bit too much water but overall it was a good mayo I think. So I put it in the blender, blend.  And its not looking so great. Very watery. I now realize that I used up all my olive oil making mayo and now don't have enough olive oil for my dressing. So I transfer to a bowl like it says. substitute vegetable oil for the olive oil and try and slowly drizzle the veg oil in while whisking.  Now ive just got a oily watery mess. down the drain it goes.  Can someone explain which step really effed it up? oh ya, and I didn't have canola oil so I substituted veg oil for canola at the beginning of the mayo recipe. fack. ",

        "text": "I tried Kenji's double-fried buffalo wings recipe but it didn't really impress. Would be grateful for any input as to why. Here's the recipe: http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/01/ultimate-extra-crispy-double-fried-confit-buffalo-wings.html\n\nThe problem was that the wings were too much on the dry side. Not inedible - just not the usual 'whoa the Food Lab hit a home run again!'. To quantify, the raw wings (without tips) measured c. 1.3 kg. The final result was about 0.6 kg. That's a lot of moisture loss!\n\nSome further comments:\n\n1) Throughout the recipe I measured the oil temp constantly with a Thermapen. Yes, it is calibrated correctly.\n\n2) The only deviation I made is that for the confit step (first fry), I put the chicken is the hot oil, I did not heat up the oil with the wings (which the recipe seems to imply). I don't think this should make a difference, however I note that quite a bit of chicken ended up sticking to the bottom of the wok, despite stirring regularly.\n\n3) The wings tasted fine and juicy after the confit step. They did not brown or crisp up. Unfortunately I didn't measure the weight here, so I don't know how much moisture loss was involved.\n\n4) For the second fry, I erred on the side of caution and took them out just as they were becoming golden brown. However, for the second fry the wings caused the oil to start splattering everywhere, for reasons unknown. Some previous posts mentioned that after the confit step the oil absorbs a lot of oil, maybe that's why?\n\nIn terms of comparison, a simple single-fry, coated with flour wings recipe I used before got a much better response, but I expected that Kenji's would dominate!\n\nSo, any thoughts as to why? What about why a bunch of chicken would stick to the wok after the confit step?\n\n\n",
