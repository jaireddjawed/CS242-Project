At first, it was great, I watched probably all the TOEFL videos on YouTube and did one 3-hour test every day. But by the second week, I started to feel like crap. I didn't have the energy to write another test. I overpowered myself and wrote purely on willpower. In the end I got an 85 on the test, which wasn't good enough. \n\nThe next exam could only be taken in a month in the place where I lived. But I wanted to get a better score before the admission deadline. So I flew to Thailand to take the test again in two weeks. By this time I realized that it really does not make sense to go to the U.S. to study. In Berkley, which I choose, I need also to write a letter to explain my reasons to study. I could not articulate why I need it, so I lost my motivation to prepare for the TOEFL altogether. But I have already paid for the exam. As a result, I passed it even worse, with a score of 83. But I was not upset. I feel relieved that I don't need to prepare for TOEFL anymore.\n\nSorry, no happy ending. But I can answer your questions.",

We're using books that were nominated by members of our subreddit book club, but this was an interesting question.\n\nDo you think it would be more beneficial for learners (level A1/A2) to use books that have an easily available English translation (since they were written in English) or to use books that originated in the language? We're mostly reading children's books because they are at the level we're studying. I can see benefits to both types of books, but wanted to get some additional opinions.\n\nFor reference, this book club is for Spanish.

My goal for 2023 is Spanish.\n\nUnfortunately Lingoda has started rolling out changes to their lessons (branding change but it seems also technique and content), removing their Marathon subscription option (now only monthly plans are available), and most recently I see a change in their Book Classes page (now you can only view classes for one day at a time rather than multiple days, and no grid view).\n\nThese things add friction for me in my language learning - I hate breakout rooms, I think the chronology of grammar makes less sense (examples first BEFORE explaining the grammar...why? Also I feel like the grammar points are less well-explained than the previous iterations, which adds more onus on the teacher to explain and the slides are less useful to refer to later), I much preferred buying a bunch of credits upfront to use over a long period of time, and booking classes is slower and a pain to see what a week's worth of classes could look like (I look to book a week's worth of classes at once).\n\nThis is just a rant. It's frustrating when you find something that worked SO WELL for you become less savory and more annoying. I'll keep using it though, because it's still the best program for me and I also already bought a bunch of credits.\n\nI will say I like that they now provide flashcards for the lessons you've taken. I haven't gotten familiar with using them yet but it's a welcome addition from me.\n\nIt doesn't seem like that many people use Lingoda on this forum, but I'd love to hear if other users feel the same (and we can send feedback and hope they'll change things back??)",

It just comes naturally since I've been speaking it for my entire life as a second language.\n\nThe bigger problem is that my vocabulary is limited, since my parents are really my only frame of reference and I don't consume any Urdu media. \n\nWhen I recently went back home, I was able to hold conversations with everyone like a native speaker, but a lot of words I didn't understand. I could still understand the general idea of what they were saying, and ask for the unknown words meaning. It was much harder when listening to the news, I felt like I understood like maybe 50% of what was being said, the language included more uncommon words, phrases, metaphors, etc. Here I genuinely couldn't understand what they were saying and would ask someone to explain it to me.\n\nI wouldn't say the language was esoteric, rather it wasn't common in the vocabulary of my parents, hence foreign to me. Meanwhile my family back home interact with various people daily, so they have exposure to multiple styles and flavors.\n\nHow do I bridge this gap of knowledge?",

        "text": "Was speaking to a friend today who doesn’t live in the states who learned English as a second language. As far as I can tell, he’s completely fluent. Regularly reads books in English and, other than a slight accent, sounds very similar to any other English speaker in terms of the vocabulary &amp; slang he’ll use, and the ease at which he can form sentences. \n\nAt one point in the conversation I mentioned the term “*PSA*.” He looked at me and asked what that was, and I told him it stood for “Public Service Announcement.” He goes “I mean I know each of those words, but I don’t think I’ve ever heard that term before. What is it?” \n\nHearing him ask this felt strangely liberating. I’ve been making a lot of progress in my TL, but I often feel discouraged when I feel the amount left to learn is never ending. But hearing my friend who I thought had flawless English ask me this made me realize, “Huh, you don’t have to know everything. You can miss pieces of the puzzle and still be fine.”",

        "text": "Hi everyone, I hope this is okay to post! \n\nFor context, I love learning languages through songs. One of my favorites activities that I used to do with my teacher was listening to a song and filling in the lyric sheet she provided. Some words in the lyrics would be blanked, and we'd have to fill in those blanks with what we hear from the song. \n\nNow I know there are probably such resources out there — maybe a lyric bank activity sheet of some sort. But not all languages have those, and sometimes the songs available are limited to old songs that could get boring real quick. I want to do this lyric-filling activities with new songs, from artists I like. But how do I acquire those blanked lyric sheets? Obviously I can't be the one picking out words to be blanked out, and then be the one filling it.\n\nSo I asked my brother to create this tool for me! It is called Word Deletion Tool, available for android on PlayStore. \n\n• It is an app that will delete random words from your input text and replace it with blanks (_____). \n• You can specify how many words you want to delete (in percentage)\n• You can preserve some words by adding them to Excluded Word List. Words added here will not be deleted. I usually put words like I, me, you, and, names like someone's name or city names, and English words (my TL isn't English, and we know some singers love to throw in random English words in their songs)\n• If your text has line breaks, you can choose to preserve them in the output \n• Once the output is generated, you can copy the output text\n\nI hope some of you will find this app useful! Input text is not limited to just lyrics, you can paste literally any text. The app is free to download and use. Feedbacks/suggestions are more than welcomed! \n\nLink: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=deletiontool.deletiontool",

        "text": "Good morning! Happy Thursday!\n\nAre you have trouble listening and comprehending a conversation?\n\nFear not. You are not alone. Studies have shown that immediately after listening to a 1O-minute oral presentation, the aver- age listener has heard, understood and retained 50 percent of what was said. \n\nHere are 5 active techniques to improve your listening:\n\n\n1. Pay attention: Give the speaker your undivided attention, and acknowledge the message. Recognize that non-verbal communication also \"speaks\" loudly. Look at the speaker directly. Put aside distracting thoughts. Don't mentally prepare a rebuttal! \r\nAvoid being distracted by environmental factors.\n\n2. Show that you are listening: Use your own body language and gestures to convey your attention. \r\nNod occasionally. \r\n\nSmile and use other facial expressions. \n\r\nNote your posture and make sure it is open and inviting.\n\n3. Provide feedback: Our personal filters, assumptions, judgments, and beliefs can distort what we hear. As a listener, your role is to understand what is being said. This may require you to reflect what is being said and ask questions. \n\r\nReflect what has been said by paraphrasing. \"What I'm hearing is\" and \"Sounds like you are saying\" are great ways to reflect back.\n\n4. Defer judgment: Interrupting is a waste of time. It frustrates the speaker and limits full understanding of the message. \n\r\nAllow the speaker to finish.\n \r\nDon't interrupt with counter arguments.\n\n5. Respond Appropriately: Active listening is a model for respect and understanding. You are gaining information and perspective. You add nothing by attacking the speaker or otherwise putting him or her down. \n\r\nBe candid, open, and honest in your response. \r\nAssert your opinions respectfully.\n \r\nTreat the other person as s/he/they would want to be treated.",

No surprise because I know I need a lot more vocabulary to move into my brain.\n\nBut I am frustrated. I still cannot read a newspaper or book without a paper or online dictionary. When I come across new words I dutifully put them into an Anki-like card system (a friend recommended Flashcards Deluxe and I have stuck with that). But I HATE going back to review the cards.  I’d rather plow ahead and keep adding a dozen more cards. I’m like a car with only a forward transmission.\n\nCan anyone else relate to this? Maybe someone can just yell at me to discipline myself and take time off to review.\n\n*(USA expat who recently moved to Vienna due to my husband’s job.

So in order to get to consuming native content, it is important to learn those top 1000 words by heart as fast as possible using flashcards (Anki or Memrise).\n\nWhat a huge waste of time!\n\nThe 1000 most common words are so called for a reason. They are the most common words. They are in everything and everywhere. They repeat all the time. In fact they repeat so often that you do not need to spend any extra effort learning them by heart.",

        "text": "Personally, I've studies both languages for little amounts of time each. As someone who is still  a beginner in both means I won't be able to say too much on this topic, but here is my opinion based on what I know:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, you didn't actually think it would be that simple, do you?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Pronunciation, spelling, and writing**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor pronunciation, it has to go out to Polish, mainly because of Polish having a LOT of consonant clusters, and it also has many sounds that are very unfamiliar to English speakers. But don't think that Russian pronunciation is gonna be much easier, Russian also has sounds unfamiliar to English speakers and consonant clusters also appear quite often.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor spelling and writing, Polish is definitely a easier, here's why: Polish is written using the Latin alphabet (just like English), so as long as you learn a few symbols with accents you'll be able to read all of Polish quite easily, while Russian is written in the Cyrillic alphabet, which is new to English speakers, however, the Cyrillic alphabet really isn't that hard to learn. When it comes to spelling, Russian and Polish are both quite phonetic, meaning that a word is usually pronounced as it is spelled. However, even with little experience in both languages, I am pretty confident to say that it is simpler in Polish. Polish letters are ALWAYS read the same, one way. But.. there are diphthongs, so be careful there. Also, there are no silent letters in Polish. Russian spelling is again, not much harder, however, letters do often seem to be pronounced slightly different than they appear (mainly due to stress, we'll get into that later), and the choice between one and two \"n\" sounds in Russian can get quite confusing... but other than that, these are pretty similar, since both are quite phonetic, it won't make too much of a difference as long as you know the rules of each. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Stress on words**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoy... stress, is WAY harder in Russian than Polish. Honestly, I heard it gets easier as you go on, but even so, word stress in Russian is the worst part of the language to me, not writing, not grammar, 80% of the time when I thought about giving up on learning Russian was because of word stress. Russian has a free stress system, meaning it is never very obvious where the stress falls on in a word, and you can't get it wrong either, because if you do, then it sounds plain ridiculous to a native Russian. Also, vowels in Russian change depending on if it is stressed or unstressed, one example would be how an \"o\" sounds more like \"a\" when it isn't stressed, or that \"ya\" might sound more like \"ye\". Polish is also a stress language, but stress is usually a lot more fixed. In Polish the stress usually falls on the second to last syllable in a word, with this rule, stress becomes a lot less stressful (pun intended).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Grammar**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPolish and Russian are both Slavic languages, so both languages share quite similar grammar, however this one has to go to Polish, note though, that the difference is only by a little, so this won't effect you too much in learning, grammar in both of these languages will be absolutely hell for a native English no matter which one you study. But there are a few reasons this one goes to Polish. For one thing, Polish has 7 cases, while Russian only has 6. But that case doesn't press too much on you as it is, but also, Polish has a lot less straightforward of a case system in general, but Russian's case system really isn't straightforward either. Next, verbs. Polish verbs have 4 groups of endings in the present tense (and you just have to know which group the verb belongs in), and on top of that, the stem of the verb almost always seems to change, and it still isn't considered irregular (This is my way of telling Spanish learners to stop complaining about irregular verbs, because if you go about it the right way, they aren't too hard), on top of that, they're are still irregular verbs! We aren't getting into that now, because I think you see my point. Russian conjugations are usually more straightforward, there are only two groups of endings for verbs in present tense, and you can tell which one to use based on the ending of the verb. But don't get too excited, as Russian also has irregular verbs that break these rules, and also spelling rules that completely change the ending anyways. When it comes to verbal aspect, both Russian and Polish are annoying in that sense, there seems to usually always be two verbs based on aspect in both languages, no comparison there. Same for adjectives (at least from what I've studied so far).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn conclusion, I think that Polish is easier than Russian overall, many would disagree, but that is just my opinion. But, Polish is still very difficult for English speakers, but just because of the use of the Latin alphabet, fixed stress patterns, very clear spelling, Polish is easier. But again, this is all about opinion, if stress doesn't stress you out (get it ;) ), and the Cyrillic alphabet is no big deal (trust me, it really isn't) then Russian might just be easier for you. It's all opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is coming from someone who only knows both of these languages to a beginner level, and has studied Russian for longer than Polish, I would like to hear others opinions on this matter, as they are both pretty similar in difficulty.",

I listen to a lot of reggaeton and watch Spanish tv shows and I think it has been crucial in improving my Spanish. I want to start learning a new language and I figured since I already watch a lot of anime and korean shows that it would be a no brainer to pick one of them as my next language. However what I’m worried about is being able to remember the language. As an American it’s not too hard to remember a lot of my Spanish because it’s everywhere at least in the area I live in. The area I live in has a large Puerto Rican population and many of my friends are Hispanic so I’m constantly hearing the language being spoken. However if I was to learn Japanese or Korean I have a feeling that it would be much harder to retain because I won’t really be using the language much.",

You don’t learn the words for aunt, cousin, and great-grandmother the same month you learn to say mama and papa.\n\nAnd once you start putting together sentences, you’re developing basically all the grammatical like tenses and stuff at once, you learn them kind of like phrases…\n\nI don’t really know how to explain it. But I’ve been studying German (in a patchwork way) for a long time and I can have decently comprehensible (if also brutally bad ) conversations with my tutor. But I feel such frustration because I still don’t have a fully functional grasp of HABEN and WERDEN. Whereas if I had learned German from the cradle I would have absorbed that kind of stuff foundationally.\n\nI’m onto French next (going to france soon) and in lieu of a better resource im making lists of phrases I want to learn that imitate my idea of the most effective order. Once I do it with French , im going to go back and do it with German once and for all, verdammt!!!\n\n-Do you guys know if an existing method that might satisfy my longing?\n-Do you agree with me?!?!?!?!\n-Do you want to see my sheetsof phrases and offer feedback?\n\nMerci beaucoup, vielen dank, gluten abend, Bon soir",

Let's all be honest to ourselves, many of us have achieved remarkable levels of fluency, wether it be C2, C1, B2, B1, ... that's excellent, independently of what you got you should be proud of yourself... however, many learners, including me, feel like that we speak our TL way better than others, we are simply superior in every regard, even to many uneducated native speakers.\n\nAnd given this fact, I believe we should create an ultimate level where, we as the language learning community, nominate the best polyglots and language learners of the respective TL for the Big D award, we could create an yearly cerimony just like the nobel prizes, where we could elect a committee and elect for every SINGLE language on the planet one or more people that deserve to win this award, we would have special guests and presentors passionate about learning languages like John Cena, Xiaomanyc, Putin, etc...\n\nI believe that this could easily go forward, and that this could give the recognition we language geniuses and polyglots deserve but sadly aren't given by society.",

I was curious who I could reach if I took to reddit! \n\nThe question I need to ask for my project is: \n\n**What are some lessons, activities, strategies, techniques, and materials a teacher used to help you learn English?**\n\nSome additional information that would help me is (optional, but very helpful): \n\n**What is your nationality and first language, age (ex: mid-30's, early 20's), and do you live in the US? If so, how many years?**\n\nThank you in advance for your response!",

        "text": "Both my etcnic and nationality are brazillian, and my parents never taught me any language besides portuguese. Somehow learned english when I was younger, but I don't really remember how I did so (probably through constant exposure by media). That being said, I don't know much about gramatical rules of the english language, and my pronunciation is trash since I also never had anyone to practice it with.\n\nDidn't really care much about it since I can easily consume the media I want and interact by text normally. But a few months ago, I started learning japanese by myself. Now that's a language I'm worried about because I do plan to actually speak it in the future, but I'm afraid that the same problem repeats itself.\n\nI don't like language schools (personal taste) and apps (too expensive; can't find one for Brazil), but I might consider the two if it's the only way to practice speech. Does someone knows a good alternative to practice pronunciation and speech when self-learning a language?",

We had opposing views on how everything should be ran, so I quit. \n\nAt my job I was using Spanish/Chinese everyday, sometimes even more than English! I would occasionally even think in Spanish/Chinese! However, at this point I have 0 exposure to speaking Spanish/Chinese. I downloaded HelloTalk and started conversations, but nothing is the same as real life practice. \n\nWhat are some of your methods to maintain your language speaking abilities? Because we all know, if you don't use it you lose it !",

I took two university classes where I’ve gotten over 90% in the speaking and writing evaluations too\n\nMy problem is that I’ll be so motivated to study for like 2-3 weeks and then I give up, become too lazy, or distracted by something else. So then I’ll just stop for like a month and then start all over and the cycle continues. It’s so frustrating that I wanna give up all together but I feel like I’m too invested now (sunk cost fallacy i guess). Any tips will be helpful",

I obviously can’t learn four languages at once. \n\n***From a technical stand point, is there a certain language I should learn first, that’ll help me build towards others? Or do I just select randomly and focus on that one and it doesn’t really matter? \n\nAny feedback is appreciated. Thank you.",
