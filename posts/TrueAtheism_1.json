At the end Allah will judge and decide whoever is to be in the right and who is in the wrong. only He has the power to decide who will reside in heaven or hell. can we just stop this nonsense which has continued for centuries and actually join forces together under the banner of \"Muslims\" instead of what we are today? don't you think it's time to take back what was intended for us from the start?",

        "text": "Pope Benedict will be laid to rest in The Vatican tomorrow. Good. \n\nCardinal Ratzinger (who became Pope Benedict) was a wicked man. He was literally a Nazi: as a kid he was in the Hitler Youth, and despite his claims that it was only to survive in Germany at the time, he carried fascist beliefs the rest of his life.\n\nAs Cardinal Ratzinger he oversaw the assassination of Archbishop Oscar Romero, who was teaching a leftist “heretical” version of Catholicism called “Liberation Theology” aimed at truly helping the poorest in Central America. Romero was assassinated during mass and resulted in a diaspora from El Salvador as his followers fled persecution. Ratzinger knew full and well what happened. \n\nRatzinger rallied against women’s and gay rights, opposed same sex marriages and argued that homosexuals should be excommunicated, prevented HIV education in poorest countries, and fought against women becoming clergy, supported a full ban on condoms, contraceptives and abortion. But those aren’t his biggest sins.\n\nAs Cardinal and later Pope, he helped cover up the extensive amount of child abuse transpiring at the hands of clergy. When news broke over the extent of the cover up and the sheer volume of perverted priests, he did his best to “hush hush” it and moved the offenders around to a different parish. Thousands of kids were raped under his watch. \n\nAbout the only good he did was Vatican II where they declared mass could be held in something other than Latin. I say “good” because it finally revealed how full of crap Catholicism is the general population.\n\nGood riddance Pope Benedict. May your memory be erased from history.",

It seems clear the system of Evolution must be true. \n\nTo continue, that Organized Religion has survived the evolutionary test of time means even if the usefulness of Christianity is questionable, one could argue that the usefulness of *religion generally* is not- for such possible reasons as it gives women and men a future orientation necessary for building a civilization that will last thru the ages, or that Christianity may have brought about an important philosophical advance of sorts- i.e. The Golden Rule (suggesting that societies who adopted this moral framework eclipsed those who didn't). \n\nAs for the latter, it would then seem that a religion that is TRUE would have a lot more value to civilization than one that was FALSE. And the decline of Organized Christianity in the West is therefore an implication that it no longer serves much usefulness as to not be valued enuf to keep. \n\nAs a rationalist, of sorts, I cannot determine how reasonably coherent supporting the uprise of some newer Organized Religion system is if it *does* provide a critical value and usefulness that (let's say here in the West) Christianity no longer confers.",

But now I’m angry that this has been done to him and it has set up a wall of sorts between me and my son .\n\nI’m also angry about people praising god when their child is suffering .  To make a long story short I know a family with a severely brain injured child .  They post on social media and the pictures and videos of her make me angry because she looks and sounds like she is in pain 24 hours a day and their posts praise Jesus CONSTANTLY.  I don’t understand.  They say “god thank you for the blessings you bestowed upon her” and things like “Jesus has her in his arms “.  Of course their comments from people all agree about how much Jesus has blessed her .  HOW??? By keeping her locked in a body full of pain that she can’t move and can’t open her mouth and can only be twisted and cry all day ? \n\nHow can you praise a god that not only allowed this injury to occur in the first place but allows her to continue to suffer like this .  She is in pain and it breaks my heart and they believe that not only is their a god up there but that he is GOOD!?!?  It seriously makes me furious to see and hear.  It’s upsetting enough to see the little girls suffering ,  but to hear that they think their “god” is good for this life she has ??? I’m just so upset and angry.  \n\nAnd I’m angry at my former friend .  She took my son from me in a way.  I hate her for it.  They tried desperately to indoctrinate my other son also, but he resisted and now can’t stand them.    I’m angry and sad and heartbroken that I won’t ever be with him on a Sunday morning again.  Even on Mother’s Day he had to go there for their “meeting “.  ( they are open brethren and don’t believe in churches only home meetings ).  \n\n\nI know there are no answers I just needed to vent to people that can understand and to maybe have some understanding for how religion has caused so much heartbreak in my life .   \n\nI don’t just “not believe” anymore , but I’m also beyond angry at the belief system and certain people that espouse those beliefs",

Said religions are not man-made and did not evolve into Islam, it was always absolute but got corrupted until Muhammad finally was listened alright!\n* Hey, the Quran is so ambiguous literally nothing can be assumed to have one meaning. While this causes an extreme burden of proof, you can't really prove there isn't a hell! My hell is horrible, it's fire is 70 times hotter than the sun and you are granted eternal skin, don't you really fear the chance even if it's extremely low? Don't you really fear it?

There was the term “lord”, which when applied to the social rank of the lord it could mean up to “king”, and when to the superior status of the king it meant “god”. Those belonging to the tribe or clan of the king were all called gods.\n\nThe kings were augmenting their population (producing slaves at the same time) by having their noblemen, the lords-gods, raping confined foreign women, prisoners of war (in fact, they were operating human breeding grounds). The unexpected aftermath of that practice was that some of the infants were recognized as “sons of lords-gods”, thus making the women mothers of gods, i.e., goddesses!\n\nThe women who turned goddesses, caused the public harems where they were confined, to evolve into temples. What is more, however, was that since the lords-gods had to pay to rape the women so that the expenses of the human breeding grounds would not burden the king’s treasury, the custom of the remuneration was passed on to the temples thus creating the well-known practice of Temple Prostitution:\n\n[https://www.academia.edu/85882146/The\\_Origins\\_of\\_Temple\\_Prostitution](https://www.academia.edu/85882146/The_Origins_of_Temple_Prostitution)\n\nThe lords-gods were transformed into heavenly immaterial Gods when someone made a joke saying that the ‘gods’ climbed ladders and went to live up in the sky (they were already at the top of the mountains: Olympus to Greeks, The Cedar Forest to Sumerians, i.e., halfway up, but that is another story). The above information we get from the oldest religious texts, the ancient Egyptian Pyramid Texts.\n\nThe relevant passages, in the original hieroglyphic text translated word-for-word, can be found in the following article:\n\n[https://www.academia.edu/87945364/Occurrence\\_of\\_heavenly\\_gods\\_Where\\_when\\_and\\_how](https://www.academia.edu/87945364/Occurrence_of_heavenly_gods_Where_when_and_how)\n\nIn this way, the heavenly gods were created out of the lords called gods, and out of them, theologians produced the one and only God.\n\n[https://www.academia.edu/92445449/The\\_Origins\\_of\\_Theology](https://www.academia.edu/92445449/The_Origins_of_Theology)\n\nThe most interesting part of the whole story of the gods/Gods, however, is the introduction to the story which goes back by more than 40,000 years: \n\n[https://www.academia.edu/91189086/The\\_Head\\_covering\\_Veil](https://www.academia.edu/91189086/The_Head_covering_Veil)",

        "text": "If you're like me and you dedicate a lot of your time to learning about and studying religion, you certainly know of the argument known as “The Problem of Evil.” It was possibly formulated as early as 300 BCE, by the philosopher Epicurus, and goes: \"Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then from whence comes evil?\" Essentially, it is saying that because of the existence of evil, an omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent God cannot exist. I, however, would argue that not only does the existence of evil pose a problem for Abrahamic religions, but so does the existence of good; that the existence of good outside of the confines of religion shows that: 1) the doctrine of Original Sin is wrong and 2) religion’s claims to be the moral arbiters of society are ill founded.\n\n Most denominations of Abrahamic theism preach that all of humanity, since the fall of Adam, is wicked and evil by nature. The proponents of the doctrine of Original Sin and religiously based moral systems would have us believe that, from the moment of birth, even the smallest, most innocent baby is a wretched, horrible, sinner deserving of eternal damnation, and that only their particular brand of delusion can save them from that. Not only is this idea inherently dangerous and harmful, but it is also demonstrably wrong. All you have to do is look at children, with and without religion, and people of other faiths, or no faith at all, to see it. \n\n If Original Sin or religiously grounded morality were true, young children would be the most wicked among us. They would kill each other, and us, and, generally, be no better than wild animals until they were thoroughly indoctrinated into the correct religion. By nature, they would be evil; yet, that’s not what we see. What we see is that, all in all, children are the kindest and most accepting among us. It’s not until they get older that they become filled with evil and hatred. If the doctrine of Original Sin were true, no one, before they reach the age of reason, would do good; they would only be capable of doing evil. It wouldn’t be until they accept the tenets of the correct denomination of the correct religion that they would be capable of doing anything good at all. \n\n Another way that we know this doctrine to be false is by looking at religious and non-religious people as a whole. There are people of all faiths, or no faith, who do good. If the doctrine of Original Sin were true or if morality was based on the one true religion, they wouldn’t be able to be good, moral people without having the correct religion; and since there are good people in every religion, it only makes sense that both the doctrine of Original Sin and religiously grounded morality are wrong. If they were true, atheist ought to be the most immoral people on the planet; yet that couldn’t be further from the truth. Personally, I only know a handful of atheists in real life, but they have been the most accepting, kind, and generous people that I’ve had the pleasure of knowing. \n\n So, if both were true, atheist children should be no better than brutish savages. They would be the worst of the worst; completely and totally incapable of doing good. But, yet again, this is the furthest thing from the truth. A 2015 study from the University of Chicago showed that children raised without religion were more likely to be kinder and more generous than their religious peers. The researchers took over 1000 kids, some raised with religion, and some raised without, from all over the world and told them to pick out 10 stickers to take home. Just before they left, the researcher told the children that another group of kids, for whatever reason, couldn’t get stickers, and offered them the chance to donate some of theirs to the less fortunate children. The study showed that, on average, the children from non-religious households shared more stickers than those from religious households. \n\n So, the existence of good people and children outside of the domain of faith means that Original Sin is a false doctrine and that morality isn’t based on religion. Which, in turn, decimates the biblical narrative that we are naturally sinners that need religion to be moral; wrecks the already laughable Genesis account; and eliminates the plot line that leads to Christ’s sacrifice on the cross. The problem of good is a very obvious and easy way to know, for a fact, that one of the core doctrines of the Abrahamic faiths is just flatly not true; that religion is not necessary to live a moral life; and that the whole of religions are most likely Bronze Age fan fiction fairytales, made up by scientifically illiterate, desert dwelling, morally primitive, shepherds as a way to explain things that they didn’t, and couldn’t, understand in terms that made sense in their particular cultural and societal context. If you haven’t already, it’s probably time for you to give up ancient superstitions and join us in the 21st century; and if you’re not willing to give them up completely, would you at least do away with the harmful bullshit, like the doctrine of Original Sin, that has caused immeasurable pain and suffering for centuries?",

        "text": "So I was watching a video by a youtube channel called Wendigoon. He's a outspoken christian and I really like his videos and he seems to be a good guy overall. This particular video I was watching was about the \"lost books\" of the bible. Although he made some errors (like saying that it is known that the gospels were written by the apostles), it was a fairly informative video. But I would think that researching about lost books of the bible and the formation of the biblical canon would make any one christian rethink the faith they put on the book, since they would see that the assemble of the biblical canon was nothing sort of divine. But at the end of the video the guy reaches another conclusion.\n\nHe says that researching about these lost books made him strengthen his faith on the bible, since even the lost books that are more in line with the other books on the bible don't look as \"divine\" and don't have the same cohesion of the official 66 books. He states that \"despite being written by so many authors through so many centuries, the bible has a cohesion that is divine in nature\" making it seem like \"the bible has only one author\". \n\nBut I find it amazing how the point just flies over his head. Of course he would think that the 66 books of the bible are the most cohesive, because they were **chosen** by people by their popularity and cohesiveness. The bible could've been written by millions of people throughout a million years, but it would mean nothing if I can just pick and choose what is cohesive or not to include. It's like me combing through Harry Potter fan fiction, finding the most cohesive ones, compiling them and then claiming that JK Rowling wrote them all because they're so cohesive. The canon did not fall from heaven complete and immaculate, it was created by us humans. If you have a lot of people defining the orthodoxy and then going through scripture and deciding what is canon or not, then cohesiveness means absolutely nothing.",

This truth is often scary, and art is a powerful tool to understand and cope with it. There have been MANY great pieces of art that explore existentialist philosophy. As an artist, I've been extremely inspired by such works. Despite this though, there always will exist a disconnect between the audience and the story in any traditional media of this type. You can watch characters struggle against their lack of control and autonomy in a story, and that's compelling in its own right, but only because we understand this conflict as a personification on some level of our own battles. Video games are an extremely immersive form of media, but are generally not used for serious storytelling. With some notable examples like Pathologic 2 and Disco Elysium, most games don't take an interest in philosophy. I'm a game developer myself, and I think that there is untapped potential within this medium. Right now, I'm working on an immersive narrative that puts the player in a personal and visceral scenario based on existentialist philosophy. Where one can confront, explore, and triumph against existential horror and human morality. I'd like to share it with you all.\n\nThe game is called Yuma Will Burn-\n\nYuma Will Burn is an experimental narrative survival game where choices have long-lasting story and mechanical consequences. Harsh survival mechanics exist alongside a dynamically changing narrative in an uncaring and sadistic world of triage, poverty, and fear.\n\n[https://store.steampowered.com/app/1961330/Yuma\\_Will\\_Burn/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1961330/Yuma_Will_Burn/)\n\nAs a developer, I've taken a risk by dedicating so much time to a game of this type. The genre is VERY obscure and niche. I still did it though, because I believe in both the artistic value of a deep and disempowering narrative experience and the unbridled passion this audience for them has.\n\nI encourage you to check out and wishlist the game with the link above.

        "text": "The great religious irony is that the Christian God is part of the same false gods that its own bible condemns so critically and harshly. To ascribe the Formal Pronoun such as God to Reality itself is to at the same time ascribe the meaning of an anthropological agent to this Reality. However, Reality is in no way shape or form at all like a human, and so it wouldn’t make sense then to think of this Reality as someone who can intercede on our behalf via thoughts and prayers. This Reality cannot go about in ways that are supernatural, at least as much within our current understanding of its physical nature. While I do believe we must always leave room for the mystery of Reality, and acknowledge that there are things that we cannot and perhaps will never be able to explain for, the probability that this mystery is an anthropological agent who has humanity’s best intentions in mind is very low and bleeds wishful thinking. \n\nThere is great reason to suspect that this anthropological agent is anything but good. Following a tragic line of thinking involving the horrors of the world, one could suspect that this god is either evil, uncaring, or weak. There is no reason, given how horrible things happen to innocent people, why I would place any trust or confidence in someone who is an omnipresent, omnipotent, and benevolent agent and can allow these things to occur. If he were to be so good, intelligent, and powerful, then surely he would create the structure of Reality to not allow for such monstrosities to occur. If the best answer is because of our free will, then I’ll posit that it would most definitely be a better world where we are slaves to be good than free to be evil. Or where disease doesn’t exist. Or where the human telomere is immortal. The fact that this is not the case rules out the Christian God as the agent with the characteristics formerly described, and rather a mere belief of fiction and wishful thinking, rooted in an antiquated belief structure where we did not have a good understanding of Reality. Unlike Nietzsche, who assumed that the death of this Christian God is the collapse of the world, I do not take such a cynical view towards things, beyond a figurative sense of such a collapse (mass adaptation of a secular world view). I believe that so long as the socioeconomic structures of the world are kept healthy and intact, humans will correspondingly be kept happy as well. So long as Maslow’s needs are met, the human will have no desire or need to revolt or riot. And so long as humans have an answer to our existential nature, our souls will not have turbulence. \n\nReligion has been the arena for this existential knowledge of ourselves, and thus is the reason why it is such a dominant power in the world today. Without an equally acceptable answer to this existential nature of ourselves, very few people will abandon old belief systems. Those who do abandon without adopting a healthy new one risk toiling in nihilistic despair, and is not something that should be taken carelessly. There are plenty of new age secular religions, of which I claim ignorance to the details of their various beliefs and structuring, but I’ll argue that to have harmonious cohesion, there needs to be a universal belief system. Ironically, that is originally what Catholicism was supposed to be, given how Catholic means universal, but that is an antiquated belief system, destined to die out.",

There are traditions with more direct religious ties, such as Advent candles, which marks the weeks before Christmas and is full of religious meaning. However, i think this tradition can be very easily secularized if one wanted to continue the practice from their childhood or to adopt it.",

Death is just so, so, so final. And taking that finality beyond conception and into sober realization, my heart aches. \n\nTo know that I will say goodbye to everyone and everything this body and mind has known, that the forms I have loved will disperse seamlessly back into the empty dust of the cosmos forever, is the saddest thought I’ve every had. \n\nAnd the more that my heart breaks the more I understand the wish of the sage to renounce everything. It’s not about denying one’s self pleasure, it’s because the illusion of anything being “mine” breaks down. The desire to own something and claim it, or to define myself by my relationship to others (son, worker, victim, etc) is falling away. In its place is just an appreciation for the things themselves, their beauty magnified by their finite nature. I see myself reflected in everything, my own present being and my death, I recognize my heart in them. \n\nAll of this is to say I am beginning to wonder if the entire lesson of life is to give it away. And if we try to cheat it by giving our relationships and possessions away in the hopes of attaining freedom for ourselves, we’re still in the closed-off selfish perspective. But life will work it’s way into the cracks of the heart and we will lose any hope of being “saved”. And only once we’ve truly given up our striving for more will we enter into our being and give great relief to others by demonstrating shameless, unwanting love on earth. \n\nAs a side note, I often wonder if this is all the figure of Jesus represents. And we, being human, felt the need to turn his message into a system of control, rewards and punishments, totally missing the point.",

They based their theory on the end product of the idea, i.e., the God of the Jewish, Christian, and Islamic theology, and decided that it was not scientifically possible to know whether Yahweh/Allah exists! \n\nThey were supposed to be advocates of the scientific method, but they only used philosophical verbosity in their attempt to disprove theological fantasies. \n\nThey were told: “There is God” and they replied: “Perhaps, but we cannot know for sure.”\n\nThey were told: “There are mermaids”, “There are UFOs”, Dawkins himself mentioned leprechauns and fairies, and they always replied, “we cannot know for sure”!\n\nDid they not trust scientific methods in answering questions?\n\nNo, they did! Especially Dawkins, as a scientist, knows that the scientific method demands study. To start from the very beginning with whatever evidence archaeology and the ancient texts can provide and spend long years trying to reach the *when*, *where* and *how* of the history of the idea of heavenly immaterial gods. An idea insulting to the human intellect, of which we need to know the source, so that we may restore confidence in human intellect!\n\nHere are the results of the study which succeeded in acquitting human intelligence.\n\n― The temple did not appear originally as the abode of the god/gods. It evolved out of a harem because the women housed in that harem were inseminated by lords regarded gods, and so the women ended up as mothers of gods, i.e., goddesses. \n\n―During early antiquity and up to the classical time period, [temple prostitution](https://www.reddit.com/r/Origins_Of_Religion/comments/y6xxx6/the_origins_of_temple_prostitution_post_no4/)    \n was practiced because the owner of the harem (the king) was paid by those who were inseminating the women (priestesses later, and then goddesses) of the harem.\n\n― The first theological Creator ever, produced offspring [by means of masturbation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Origins_Of_Religion/comments/ygb9vd/the_origins_of_theology_post_no5/).\n\n  \n\n―The heavenly immaterial gods were created when it was told that some criminal kings, persecuted by their victims, climbed ladders and [went to live up in the sky](https://www.reddit.com/r/Origins_Of_Religion/comments/y62jtt/the_joke_post_no3/).\n\n  \n\nAll ancient texts tell the same story.\n\nOne needs, however, to have studied the older hieroglyphic texts in order to understand the later ones, i.e., the epics of Sumerians and Greeks and, ultimately, the Hebrew Bible.\n\nTake for example temple prostitution, it is a practice entirely insane that can only be understood by reading the ancient Egyptian texts.",

The owners and all the employees know this and are cool with it. Well... most are cool with it. The gym recently hired someone new, an old woman who hates me because I'm an atheist. I could tell she hated from the moment we met: I had just entered the gym to do my 7th chest training session that week, I saw her and tipped my Pastafarian colander helmet and said, \"Evening m'lady.\" But instead of soddening her panties over what a Giga Chad Sigma Male I am, she laughed at me. I knew from that moment we were genetic enemies, destined to rip each other's spines out.\n\nA few days later I went to add a new song to the gym's mix, the song was Science's Plan Hardstyle (slowed+reverb with Riley Reid moans added). However when the old bag saw me adding the song she told me I couldn't because it was \"inappropriate.\" Then I noticed she had crucifix necklace and it all made sense, she had laughed at me before because she was an evangelical christian and hated redpilled atheists like myself. Clearly the only reason she didn't want me to add the song was because it was secular. I told her I was adding the song and she just had to deal with it. She then started screeching at me to put on Drake's mid \"God's Plan\" instead. Suddenly Science's Plan Hardstyle (slowed+reverb with Riley Reid moans added) started playing and with the power the the gym behind me I yelled at her to \"SHUT THE FUARK UP!\" Me and a few other gym goers then leaped at her like jackals and ripped her chest cavity open and started eating her entrails. Then I did 16 chest exercises and went home to jack off to Lois Griffin r34 art.\n\nTLDR: Basically what the title says.",

        "text": "So, I'm trying to stay the hell away from the cancer Islam has done to me, but even if I manage to not believe anymore there is always an experience that comes to my mind. It was a dude who had a nightmare saying \"he would convert to Islam or else he would die\", we wakes up nervous and then, his friend calls him saying asking if he was ok because \"he had a dream when he (the first dude) became a Muslim\". More exactly, he called him for his exact name while detailing it.\n\nSo, it's strange that both friends have a nightmare at the same time, wake up at the same time and called him in the moment by his exact name. One was Texan and the caller was from Washington so it's rare if they saw each other. More importantly people don't call each other for their surnames and even less when so remote. So apart of the synchrony he very likely predicted his name while calling him. Though even if I try to think otherwise to not fear it it comes the \"what if he didn't know\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn truth this happened me before in other contexts, not being able to explain paranormal phenomena, so I stay away from it but in this case it was a Muslim and I don't know any case of something this \"coincidental\" having happened related to any other faith. The only case I know was a Christian pair who admitted having invented the story for money. So the \"why don't you fear other faiths\" argument fails here. \n\nIt's unfortunate because I hate this religion and how much distress it causes me and I was ready to fully leave it until this shit comes to my mind every few hours. I've appointed therapy but I'll receive it in months, so no clue how to stop fearing it until then.",

        "text": "I’m sorry if this sounds like rambling, but I really need to let this out.\n\nI have come to the conclusion that I am an atheist, specifically an agnostic atheist. I am completely comfortable about this position, and have no problem with it.\n\nWhat I’m conflicted on, though, is my philosophy on what many consider to be “paranormal”.\n\nBefore I go on, I want to say that I think “paranormal” is an inaccurate word. If the things that fall into that category do in fact exist, they should be considered natural, as they would theoretically be just as natural as the environment around me.\n\nHaving said that, I have been feeling very conflicted. As an autistic person, I am hyper-aware as to the details of my surroundings. I tend to notice a lot of details that others don’t. Due to that, I believe that I may have experienced something “paranormal”. Now, I’m not one to believe in things that others believe just because they believe it; rather, I believe in things that I personally experience and can logically deduce. In these instances, I made sure to rule out every other possible option before I came to the conclusion that what I experienced might be “paranormal”. Some may not see that as sufficient, and that’s completely fine with me.\n\nWhat’s troubling me is that I’m having trouble finding other people who view this concept the same way I do. I’ve noticed that many of these subreddits are skeptic-leaning. I don’t have a problem with that at all, but it means that I’ve had a hard time finding people I can relate to. Maybe I’m just insecure, and maybe it’s related to my autism, but I tend to feel very insecure about my opinions/philosophies when I can’t find anybody else to relate to.\n\nIdk, I guess I just always have been feeling out of place.\n\nPlease let me know if this doesn’t belong here, because I’ll delete it if it doesn’t",

Everyone knew us, we knew all of them but by the time I was 17, I realized I was very much an atheist and quit going. My little sister quickly followed suit and our families accepted it. Cut to present day, I’m now 37, my sister is 35. We each have 2 children and both are expecting baby boys next month. This would normally feel like a dream except she and her husband found out their oldest daughter is literally missing her sixth chromosome and have since become very devout Christians. My sister suffers from intense untackled abandonment issues stemming from our biological mother leaving us when I was 6 and she was 4. Her daughters diagnosis, I think, brought her to another level of emotional distress and for the last two months, she and her husband have been going to church constantly. She has hidden this from me for months and I get it, I’m very atheist, but we are/were also thick as thieves. No one knows me the way she does, vice versa.. so finding this out has come as a major shock. I babysat my nieces a few weeks ago and found bibles and crosses all over their house that hadn’t been there a few weeks prior. I feel lied to, almost betrayed in a sense, and I’m really sad she’s chosen this route. Part of me feels like she doesn’t want to accept living reality which drives me crazy. My very devout stepmother(who ironically has never liked me) has always had a MAJOR influence on my sister. My husband and I lived in Seattle for 5-6 years until 2020 and this is when I believe my stepmom started in with her Jesus work. Some friends think I’m making a big deal out of it, some say I should cut them off(not an option for me). I’m so confused, I’m sad, I’m torn.. she isn’t the same at all. Won’t talk about the same things, changes the subjects to “easy” ones and nothing feels organic between us now. Anyone have any experience with this or helpful words of advice?",

I've been here a week and dad is already asking me to go to church with him.

        "text": "I regularly engage with theists about their beliefs, and there always comes a time where we must define what a God is, and what descriptive terms can we apply to it, so we can grasp what we are talking about. Usually, in discussion about the Abrahamic deity, many terms will be used to describe this deities abilities, morals, along with power. Words, such as omnipotence, omniscience, and omnibenevolence (sometimes omnipresence is used, however it is mainly those three) are quite fascinating to me, and I like to speculate as to what these words seem to mean, and the philosophical implications of such.   \n\n\nMoreover, these terms are used to describe this entity, and I have many problems with understanding what the words actually mean, or whether or not they mean anything. Sure, it makes immediate sense when talking about philosophy, this deity is something that can do all, knows all, and has the supreme standard of morality. However, I am not sure if it's that easy, or whether or not these terms have any actual descriptive value, especially since no standard for the terms is involved, or even known of. It would make sense to use the terms all-powerful, all-knowing and so on, if we understand the threshold for these sorts of things. For example, if we are playing a RP card game, and there is this card that is extremely rare or something, and has no limitations to what it can do. With that said, something as simple as a game, we can be clear of the rules and limitations, so if you really wanted to use the terms under that context, it would make perfect sense.   \n\n\nHowever, when discussing the universe, knowledge and a God, is where things get a little tricky, to my best understanding of the words and their philosophical application. Not considering the problem of using all of those words to describe one thing, (there being a few interesting contradictions in terms, omniscience and omnipotence for example) I am not sure these words have any actual meaning, and it actually make it more difficult to understand what this God is, and it raises many other questions.   \n\n\nSome of those questions being whether or not knowledge is something that can be all known, or what power is and how it is gauged to determine omnipotence. However, I may be mislead or my reasoning might be flawed. Aside from the typical objections, I think using those adjectives used to describe God, don't provide any information about it and cause more confusion. In a similar way that the word \"nothing,\" is entirely inconceivable and doesn't really mean anything.   \n\n\nIn typical dialog, the theist will lay out the foundation for what their God is, and then argue accordingly, but again I seem to struggle in finding a practical application for those words; especially when the comprehension of what these words mean in reality, is not complete enough to describe it as such. Adjectives to describe something of this magnitude, should be pretty clear and meaningful. If people were to describe God as malevolent, I could make sense of that since I can conceive of what that means, and many examples; however these words that are meant to describe the maximum amount of knowledge and power, seem completely meaningless. Now, if the theist goes to say that using those words primarily illustrates the complexity of God, that suggests that this being and its nature cannot be understood, thus rendering the belief or speculation about it redundant.   \n\n\nThe reason for this post is to just ask this community if there is something I am either missing, or if I am not addressing the problem correctly. I would highly appreciate any commentary on this, along with personal views or criticisms. Thanks a lot! ",

You are strong, independent, free-thinking, questioning, and caring individuals. You see the injustice, hypocrisy, and hate in the world and in organized religion and you’ve taken a stand against it. Maybe you’ve always been an atheist. Maybe you’ve had to go through the difficult process of coming out as an atheist to your religious family and/or friends. Maybe you hide your true thoughts and beliefs behind a mask because you aren’t comfortable coming out to those you love. Either way, it’s not always easy to be different or stand up for yourself in the face of the majority, which is why I respect the hell out of you.\n\nHowever, having been in your shoes myself, I want to share some unsolicited advice in hopes you don’t make the same mistakes I have. You don't need to believe in God or join a religious organization, but try to find something to believe in. Otherwise, it’s incredibly easy to fall into a state of pessimism, cynicism, nihilism, apathy, or despair. Do not to dwell on the negativity in the world or in your own life. Actively search for goodness and meaning in the world, whatever that may be to you. Consider the notion that if there is a God, he/she/it may not fit into the box that religion has put them in. Keep an open mind and an open heart, and continue to question your own beliefs, dis-beliefs, and the beliefs of others. And most importantly, keep being your awesome selves.\n\nWith Love,\n\nA Former Atheist\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Wow this escalated quickly. I wasn't sure whether to post this here or not in fear that it may be taken as condescending or preachy, so I really am sorry that it came across that way. It's hard to convey tone over the internet. I'm not a religious person and am in *no way* trying to convert or \"save\" anyone, other than saving them from the pain I went through. Obviously this may not apply to everyone and being an atheist doesn't necessarily mean you don't believe in anything or are unhappy or should stop being an atheist lol. Like I said, I respect the hell out of you guys and I'm sorry if it didn't come across that way.",

That is their mission, and as far as I understood it when I was in that religion; there is no acceptable answer except conversion. \n\nSince I left the idea of faith behind over a decade ago, I have always gone to this specific rationale when they ask me why I don't believe, and it's not like saying the evidence is just not enough for me to believe that there is a god (*their god*), the evidence that they put forward as evidence of a creator if you will because this requires more explanation on your part, and there is no explanation, it just isn't (enough evidence). \n\nSo, what I do is I ask them if they believe that the apostles are worthy of, you know, not so much idealizing them but using them as a role model if you will. I haven't met a person that has said no to that, and if they are Catholic, then they absolutely believe that the apostles are worthy of our adoration because some of them are saints in their version of Christianity. \n\nFrom there, it's pretty simple, I just point them at the parable of Doubting Thomas, I talk about him [Thomas] without using the word doubting, and ask him if they are aware of why he is known, or rather what he's best known for. \n\nSadly, and I don't know why this is the case but you would be surprised how many of them aren't familiar with doubting Thomas. I feel like it's a bit absurd, to be honest. I don't even believe anymore, and I know more about their religion in some cases. \n\nAnyways, when I mentioned about the accuracy is it's about at this point where I am unfamiliar with his, with the rest of his [Thomas] story. I tell them that when Christ rose from the dead Thomas did not believe that and requested to see and touch Christ's wounds. he then chilled underneath the tree until Christ appeared to him, questioned him, and let him touch his wounds, and from then for if he was an as far as I understand it, 100% devoted. \n\nI tell them that I'm just waiting to touch the wounds, metaphorically speaking. \n\nThis is generally always worked for me as a polite way to shut them down when they're trying to convert you back into the flock.  \n",
