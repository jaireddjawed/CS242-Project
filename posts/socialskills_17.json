I can tell from my own experience that people reject me and say I am disgusting behind my back because of poor social skills. Despite what people in this sub say, not everyone in this world is nice.",

For those of you who don't know, Google local guides is that feature where you can add reviews and pics of places in Google maps. \n\nAround 10 hours after my bf put that story, she too updated her Google local guides profile which hadn't been updated in 2 years. \n\nHow can this even be a coincidence?\n\nAnd also found out that her sister has been going to the same gym from past few months, so all her \"help me I'm new\" act seems very sus to me. If her sister has been going there, wont she already have known what to do and what not to do? \n\nAm I overthinking or am I too narrow minded?",

Every forced interaction, stare, greeting, or otherwise is just someone forcibly laying bare my shame and making both parties acknowledge it. I have to respond either with a short wave (which I've been told is not enough), I have to show my teeth or smile or make the right facial expression (which I hate doing because it breaks my carefully measured and calculated facial expression I keep my face in at all times that looks the most tolerable), or I can talk and say something (which always feels like punch to the gut every time I speak, and I have to track my heartrate on my neck and slow it down in isolation afterwards) stupid or socially inadequate. Every time I'm around people all I can feel is hot and prickly with their stares and their knowledge of me. I feel unsafe.\n\n\n\nWhen I'm forced into a social interaction, it's just an exercise in denial; denial that I'm not like everyone else, somehow, and denial of my inherent inability and shameful exterior/interior. I didn't realize that any of this was abnormal until my partner told me, and she's very insistent (over and over again, pointing it out every time I do something socially aberrant) that something is wrong with me. I have friends, but when I'm hanging out with them outside of on campus or at work I just want to be alone; I can never bring myself to ask to hang out with them, and can't imagine actively wanting to. I feel lonely often, and envious of others who interact and socialize, but I just do not want to actually do it. I guess I wish I was the type of person who enjoyed hanging out with people, I don't know.",

I’ve only ever been able to talk to people when I’m with a friend that I feel very comfortable with and know very well. It takes me years to open up and be fully myself and confident around people. It prevents me from making friends with people like at uni I’d rather not talk to people because I hate talking to new people because I feel so uncomfortable and insecure. I don’t know how to initiate or hold a conversation, my mind goes completely blank whenever someone tries to talk to me and I forget basic things. That and also I don’t like small talk at all, it’s so tedious. It just makes me seem extremely boring and like I have no personality which I’ve been told and I’m that hurts because I know when I’m around the right ppl I can actually be myself. But it’ hardly ideal to wait years to become confident around people, I’d be finished with uni by then lol.I think I’m a mix of not liking people/ antisocial and not knowing how to talk to people.",

Then she didn’t respond for a while so I realised that she’s probably asleep, so I sent her my notes and after I put ‘Feel free to use any of my notes if you need it. Anyway, gn’. I know it’s nothing too big and I also used the abbreviation so it may seem kinda insignificant, but I still wanna know- is saying ‘goodnight’ too personal? I think it’s ok and was a nice way to say bye to her but I just wanna check.",

Now normally I see random people trying to sell people stuff etc. In the middle of the city centre where it’s crowded and easy to avoid them but unfortunately I ended up getting caught up in a conversation with these two yesterday evening. I always try to be polite and give anyone the time of day even if I’m not interested at all but recently I get stressed out whenever I see a small group of people (like 2 or 3) gathered on a street/sidewalk. I’m terrified they’re going to want to sell me something or try and make me convert to their religion when all I want to do is get on with my day. \n\nI think the thing that’s stressing me the most is that these are students and not random people in the city. The possibility of seeing them again fills me with so much dread I don’t want to go out to anywhere on campus. I know it’s all irrational and stupid, and when I look at how I’ve been slowly but surely improving at social interaction since starting University this feels like a massive step back. I have had too many conversations where I leave feeling stressed or worried and I thought I was finally freeing myself from it. \n\nAnyway, long setup and tangent aside, how do I politely ask people like this to leave me alone? I never ever want to have to deal with this again so any advice is welcome! The advice you all have posted on here before have been a big help to me before so I don’t doubt you all^^",

        "text": "I \\[35F\\] am really good friends with Joseph \\[44M\\]. We met in the fall of last year, clicked instantly, and became fast friends. We have a lot in common and get along so well. Our one big difference is he is a social butterfly, or as he calls himself, a self-proclaimed attention hog. Whereas I am the complete opposite. I am socially awkward; I like who I like, and I have an extremely small group of friends, all of whom I initially clicked with at one point in time. Again, smallllll group.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to last night. We went to our weekly spot for trivia night, where someone he knew ended up coming in, and she sat with us. To a normal person, that wouldn't be an issue. But to someone like me, I instantly shut down. She was very sweet and tried conversing with me, but I couldn't help but just give her short answers and really didn't engage back. This is the second week in a row now I have been like this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't end up staying later like I normally do for trivia because I felt so awkward and uncomfortable, so I left. And the poor friend of Joseph's even said \"I'm not planning on staying!\" and I tried to play it off like I was having issues with my stomach which is why I was leaving, but she clearly wasn't buying it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo Joseph texts me last night a little while after I get home saying that he hoped I got home safe, and said \"I'm not sure why you shut down around my friends.\" A whole conversation ensued over text. There was no arguing or blaming, thankfully, it was a mature conversation where I explained to him that I don't think he understands the depth of how socially awkward I am with people, not just his friends. For instance, and I told Joseph this, when my partner and I first started dating, I was the exact same way with his family and friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe understood, and said that I need to understand that he can't control who he runs into. A similar situation happened last week where he ran into someone he knew, and I had the same reaction as well. He told me I clearly shut down with both of these friends, that he's known these people for many years, and that they both picked up on the way I acted...more or less, he was politely telling me I was being rude. He said he's a popular person, and that he loves people, and he's going to run into people that he knows.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI texted him this morning asking him if he would please reach out to both of these friends of his apologizing on my behalf for my rudeness, that it had nothing to do with them, it's all me, and that I feel horribly. I would prefer to apologize to them myself, but I have no way of getting in touch with them. He said he gladly would, no worries.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm afraid I am going to lose him as a friend, and just the thought of that breaks my heart. In the heat of the moment, I texted him a little after that saying \"maybe it's best if we weren't friends. I clearly have issues and don't know how to be a good friend\" and instantly regretted it. However, he did text me back saying \"stop....that's just silliness.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm still afraid though. Does anyone have any advice on tricks that worked for them to not be so socially awkward, or ways to not shut down when put in that situation? I appreciate you taking the time to read this.",

But maybe we need to become comfortable in who we are, change nothing about ourselves, other than find ways to build strategies around being exactly who we are. It is about feeling comfortable, not barraging people with our dazzling repartie.\n\nWhen we feel comfortable, then we have less barriers up, and when we have less barriers up, then people will feel invited to connect with us. So for me the goal is not to change something in my behaviour or learn how to talk at people more, but to feel comfortable.\n\nThat requires strategies, what are some of yours that work for you?",

He seems quite friendly with everyone, so far we've only really spoke about gym stuff and when we saw each other on a night out once, so we don't really know eachother like that but we get along well\n\nI started a small chat about drinks, following up from when we saw eachother out and suggested us going to the pub some time but unfortunately he doesnt really drink, but i still wanna try and meet outside of the gym or get something going, and now i dont really know how i can invite him out. Cos drinks is the \"ol' reliable\" option and now that's gone\n\nSo what would be the best way to progesss things - stay chatting at the gym until something more natural arises or just invite to hang out sometime? Probably the former but lmk ur thoughts, thnx",

        "text": "I am not sure if this is the right subreddit for this. But I’ve seen some related posts on here. \n\nI have a close friend I’ve known her for close to a decade now. Let’s call her Ana. I guess if I have to objectively describe the good about her as a friend, I guess it would be she’s a good person, overall. (That’s why I’m having a dilemma whether remaining friends is not worth it anymore) \n\nAnyhow, \n\nI think her insecurities (which I assume she has and let me explain later how I am saying this) is making it difficult for me to keep her as my friend. Currently, I have literally zero energy to talk to her or to see her. \n\nMy issue with her is she’s always subtly competing with me. I didn’t notice it in the previous years or more accurately, I don’t know when it exactly started. \n\nLet me give a few examples. She’s always finding ways to slyly put me down. If a friend or even her boyfriend compliments something I did (cooking, some hobby, something I bought, can’t really remember the details) she would make remarks like “I don’t really like that”, “that’s not really my thing”, “I like it some X way” or comment something that would make it feel like she’s passive aggressively belittling me. This happens especially if my husband and I happen to be doing something in the same area (i.e. picking out clothes for winter, sports wear) and she would be nitpicking what we do if we did something differently from whatever she did. When my husband and I were so happy we got a spacious apartment, she told me “Eh, my boyfriend doesn’t like a big apartment”. Like huh? \n\nUp to now, the above sounds petty. But there are also moments when I can tell she’s not genuinely happy for me when I achieve something. For example, when we were looking for jobs at the time, I was given an offer at a company in a field that is a little different from what I studied for Masters but still, I was considering it because the opportunities for me that sounded good. I told Ana that and I remember the conversation went on and she said “I don’t want just any job”. And in the context, she was clearly talking about me. What annoyed me was that she was constantly asking me about my job offers and how much those would pay. Fast forward now, I landed a fantastic job at a very progressive company and I didn’t hear anything on her end (like what job she got) and this is odd because her and her bf have a habit of humble bragging for when good things happen to them. \n\nI also catch her lying about many things (which I know in the grand scheme of things is probably not gonna harm anyone) but it just makes me sick when she’s lying about stuff I know is not the truth. \n\nI think the reason now I am asking the question in the title is why she continues to be like this when I am going through a tough time. If you read my previous posts, you can see my husband got diagnosed with cancer. I was hoping she’d have the decency to just not be like this for now. \n\nAny advice? Am i just being sensitive?",

For the majority of my life I've categorised myself as an introvert person. Not liking social settings and preferred enjoying time by myself rather than being surrounded by people. But lately a shift has been happening. I am liking the attention I get, I am liking the idea of talking to people and other extrovert traits that I have started liking. Turns out, my personality was being weighed down by shyness. I am not an introvert per se but I am also not an extrovert. My social battery does go down after sometime and I need downtime by myself but I do like being with people. So I think I am somewhere in the middle, not at the far ends. \n\nAs my shyness is reducing, I am becoming more social. I am being more of myself which was an impossible thing to do. I would get embarrassed if I did anything which was even slightly awkward and crawl back deep into my shell. Now I am letting go off those small social screw ups and keep moving forward with my life. My toes still curl when I do something out of my comfort zone; I feel my muscles get tightened but I do it anyway. So far the experience has been fine. Lets see what the future holds for me.\n\nSo in short, I think I was not exactly an introvert, I was just shy and I think anyone here struggling should give it a thought too. Maybe it can help them in some way or the other.",

I’ll finish my sentence and she has no response to what I just said. Sometimes she will completely change the subject. \n\nSometimes I’ll be in the middle of saying something and she starts texting. Or will start talking to one of our animals, or interrupt me to say “look at [animal]” Or she’ll interrupt and bring up something completely unrelated. \n\nI get frustrated because I’m on a certain train of thought and I’m looking for a response. \n\nA few examples. Tonight we were at a restaurant and my step dad told my mom what he wanted to order and then said he needed to use the restroom and she needed to order for him. She immediately asked him to repeat. Even though she was looking right at him. \n\nAnd even with me, she’ll be looking at me, but not really.\n\nShe also talks to herself a lot. She’s having full blown out loud conversations and has no idea she is talking out loud. She’s just so not present.

I have a pretty interesting life, for those wondering if I’m boring - I travel the US in my camper van, I work in tech as a product designer, and have lived in multiple cities. I also have a lot of hobbies and interests. I am a curious person and love to get to know people on a deeper level, and make them feel seen. I rarely do, even by my own friends. Any tips of advice here to make real connections with people I’m meeting for the first time?",

Even back when I was in middle school, I still wasn’t a huge talker but I was much more than I am now. Right now I wouldn’t say I have any friends but rather a few acquaintances at both my school and work. All of this adds up to me essentially now having my social skills being stuck at that of a 6th grader. The worst thing is, I used to blame my lack of social interaction on my social anxiety, only to find later on that it is only like 30% of the problem. I have been trying to work on it for the past 2 years with only minimal success but I am still yet to make any meaningful progress. I’ve gotten no better at starting conversations (which I almost never do) because I struggle with conversation starters and am no better than alright with carrying on a conversation. At this point I’m left a bit unsure what to do. How can I “age” my social skills to the point where they are acceptable for my age without embarrassing myself?\n\nI understand that not all information is presented about the situation so feel free to ask questions.",

We think she is on the spectrum but this has never been disclosed. \n\nThis time today, I was covering for someone else who was In the teacher in questions room. So the complainy teacher stsrted telling me about how she wants kids (she has said this before) and then she started telling me about how shes afraid of her lady parts and she thinks its gross down there and that she's never had a pap smear and that she's afraid of doctors. This was all during naptime for little babies, so they didn't understand, but it was also tmi for me. And I'm all for sexual health and liberation, but she is religious and I just didn't know how to respond. It was a little much for me, and I only said to see a doctor or a counselor because i just didn't feel comfortable (and me and my friends usually are pretty open about this stuff, but we are also of different backgrounds than she is). \n\nWhat should I have done? I didn't shut her out but I couldn't just tell her to stop at the moment because she was just talking talking talking.",

        "text": "He was really sweet and we were talking about the show (it was an open mic night, the audience can go up and perform) and he was encouraging me to go up and I said no, talking about how anxious I was, and I think before this I had revealed that I just went there to try and make friends, it went quiet for a moment and then he just said “You know you’re never gonna get out of your box closed up like that.” \n\nOr something along those lines. It just absolutely shattered any semblance of normalcy and being fine I was putting on and I started bawling in front of him. He gave me a hug and said some stuff I can’t even recall that well since I was so emotional but it was so true. It felt so good to be hugged by someone. \n\nFor awhile, years, I’ve just been talking to myself out loud and imagining I’m talking to someone else. Or I’ll imagine scenarios where people care about me, see how much I’m suffering and help me, are nice to me, or I’ll imagine just having a social interaction where I don’t feel anxious or like I’m not myself. I really want to feel connected to other people, at the same time they really scare me.\n\nAnyways, he asked for my Facebook and said he doesn’t want me to be lonely. For awhile I haven’t experienced someone seeing my true vulnerability, like my actual anxious and scared self, and being honest and kind with me. \n\nThen the lady at the bar gave me a coke “on the house” which was nice. \n\nI’m so socially stunted and I want to connect with people as I am, but I’m TERRIFIED. But tonight I literally went there just waiting for someone to approach me because I was so anxious. I could literally feel myself hoping someone would just talk to me. It felt so good to actually talk to someone. \n\nAnd I mean, I think I did good? I did something SUPER out of my comfort zone and got through it. I also talked to at least two people. It was really hard. I feel kinda bad about how obvious my loneliness is. And how I feel I have the social skills of someone half my age. But it is what it is. And he saw it and didn’t reject me. And it did feel good. I know I need to keep trying if I ever want to break out of my isolation. I hope I keep trying. I’m so afraid.\n\nEdit: He texted me “come next week and sit with me” !!!",

When I go clubbing drunk I also never know what to do, the other day my friend made fun of me for always doing the same thing. \n\nWhat am I meant to do? Drugs?

This is the 3rd time in recent history that he's done so.

My family would have remembered that scenario and they don't. None of my other friends remember it either, and I'm SURE it would have mentioned it to them.\n2. Where we ended up, there really WAS no public transportation. Furthermore, at the time of the incident, I was broke. I couldn't have left her to return home if I wanted to!\n\nEDIT: We all were living together at the time for a business to get it going. So we returned \"home\" there was nowhere else for her to go - she just went to their room! ",
