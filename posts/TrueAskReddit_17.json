        "text": "In theory having a sex offender registry is a great idea. I want to be able to see if someone around me is a sex offender. However, I feel like it has some major flaws that greatly reduce its usefulness \n\nTo my understanding, the system is such that if you are convicted of a crime that is sexual in nature including rape and child molestation  you are put on the registry and anyone can access it. It is also for life (barring some exceptions in limited areas) \n\nThat is all well and good in my opinion. \n\nHowever on the other hand, things like public urination or evening mooning someone can get them put on the registry in many areas. In addition the registry makes little distinction between a child rapist and the drunk idiot who peed in public. \n\nSo while it can be useful in allowing people to be informed on whether or not someone they interact with is a potential sexual predator, it can also make you think the drunk idiot is a sexual predator when their crime was fairly minor. \n\nAnother potential issue is as I mentioned earlier, most of the time being on the registry is for life. This is a good thing for the rapists, pedophiles etc that people have the right to know about. But again for the more minor crimes, it can ruin that persons life, forever. Even if they rehabilitate, they still carry that mark against them. \n\nI personally have mixed feelings about that. On the one hand. I wouldn’t want the rapist or pedophile to be able to get removed from the list. On the other hand the drunk idiot should be able to get off the list if put on there in the first place. It’s especially messy for the middling crimes. Say sexual harassment at the workplace but the guy who did the harassing actually shapes up and becomes a decent person who would never do it again and has paid his/her debt to society. Should they be able to be removed? ",

        "text": "If you'll excuse me, I've been reminiscing about my life and was hoping that I could get reddit to play psychiatrist with me for a bit. I'm a young man in my 20s who used to participate avidly in hookup culture. I've had sex with ~15 people, 3 of which were from long-term relationships, and the rest of which were from short-term casual encounters. Of these short-term encounters, 2 I would say really felt like hookups -- as in I felt that the woman understood the temporary nature of the encounter and didn't show any indications of wanting further emotional attachment. These both occured on vacation. The rest of them are what I'd like to talk about.\n\nBesides those two, I've noticed a serious recurring pattern in the women that I've had short-term relationships with. In short, I just feel that these women would drop everything if I were willing to be their boyfriend. Many of them radiate a sense of longing and neediness. Nearly all have self-esteem issues which I can't help but think contribute to their willingness to jump into bed to capture my interest. By having sex with them and ditching them, I am overwhelmed by the feeling that I am contributing to their broken state. Even though everything occurs consensually, I nevertheless feel predatory. Rather than a stronger body overpowering a weaker one, it's a stronger mind taking advantage of a weaker one. It's an unsettling feeling, and not one that I seek out in any way. But whenever I search for casual sex, the women that I find are usually these vulnerable creatures and not the libertine nymphomaniacs of the imagination.\n\n**So my question is: is my experience reflective of a universal experience? If so, is hookup culture inherently broken for women? Or could it be that some aspect of my personality attracts vulnerable and needy women? Do there exist libertine and detached women enjoying hookup culture, and I'm just not finding them?**\n\nOf course, I already know what the red-pillers and MGTOW will say about this. I admit, my experiences are neatly explained by their doctrines. But I've heard enough of them, and had enough life experience to know that they're not they're definitely not right about everything. Moreover, my experience with the 2 hookups that genuinely felt no-strings-attached makes me feel that there must be more to it (not to mention the huge numbers of women that do pornography or other sex work). Finally, I apologize if any part of the above sounds arrogant. I'm certainly not interested in aggrandizing myself for the internet (it's a throwaway account anyways) and just want to describe my perspective as accurately as possible.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the responses. After reading through everything, I wanted to make a summary of what the answer appears to be (at least how it appears to me). There are certainly a portion of men who enjoy and are served well by hookup culture. If the replies by women here are earnest, then there is certainly a portion of women who enjoy and are served by it as well. But for the large majority of women, it doesn't fulfill some inherent need for human connection. There are many naive women who are unsure and inexperienced, but jump into hookup culture to go with the times or because they want validation. These women are probably the ones that I encountered, and they are probably the ones that are hurt most by it. On a personal level, a fix should be to verbalize intentions clearly, and hopefully this would minimize pain and not thin out the pool too much. Societally, there is no easy solution short of great cultural upheaval, and life will keep plodding on uneasily and painfully.",

However, as of today the majority of people have a high school diploma, which is exactly what I think you should need to have to vote. A kid can’t vote until you they are 18 because of lack of experience and intelligence, but somebody who lacks basic skills and education that comes with finishing 12 years can? I’m not trying to be ignorant, suggesting that this become policy, or attempting to take away a freedom that makes America the country it is, I’m just genuinely curious about reasons this shouldn’t be a rule and haven’t been able to come up with anything on my own.

In fact, the entire point of the Supreme Court is to decide whether or not something follows the Constitution. Why is it that now, more than 200 years later, we still reference something as old as the Constitution to decide how to do things today?\n\nAs far as religion goes, the basis of religions such as Christianity and Islam are heavily(if not solely) reliant upon the Bible and the Koran to dictate things that are now becoming societal issues. The Bible calls for the damning of gays, and the Koran has very misogynistic aspects to it. This has obviously created many issues in the world today, with gay marriage becoming legal in the U.S. and women fighting for equality in numerous parts of the Middle East.
