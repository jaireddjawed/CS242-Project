When I had to write term papers, I would basically just pick one of my favorite novels and somehow apply it to the course, barely being able to write 12 pages. Now I have to write my B.A thesis (40 pages) and I have trouble finding a suitable topic. I toyed with the idea of writing about a novel that has philosophical aspects, so getting to 40 pages should not be a problem.\n\nSo far I thought of:\n\nUlysses by James Joyce \\- I once took a Joyce course and read a few chapters. There are quite a few philosophical themes that can be found in there. I also like the idea of writing about Finnegans Wake, but I'm scared that as a native speaker it will take me already 2 months to read the thing.\n\nAmerican Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis \\- Here I could imagine writing about madness in literature and identity. However, I am a bit scared that the text itself will not deliver enough to write a B.A thesis about it.\n\nDo you think that these are viable ideas for a B.A thesis, and do you have any tips for me? Should I read about literary theory or any other fields that could help me here?\n\nEdit: Thanks for your input, even to the people who just came here to point out my laziness. I have managed to come up with three different ideas which I will discuss with my professor quite soon.",

        "text": "Are these author's personal creative expressions or would a native speaker of English be familiar with such phrasings?\n\nPlease explain about the choice of words and their significance.\n\n\n\nFrom Chapter 1, \"Found Objects\", of Jennifer Egan's A Visit From the Goon Squad:\n\nIt began the usual way, in the bathroom of the Lassimo Hotel. Sasha was adjusting her yellow eye shadow in the mirror when she noticed a bag on the floor beside the sink that must have belonged to the woman whose peeing she could faintly hear through the vaultlike door of a toilet stall. Inside the rim of the bag, barely visible, was a wallet made of pale green leather. It was easy for Sasha to recognize, looking back, that the peeing woman's blind trust had provoked her: We live in a city where people will steal the hair off your head if you give them half a chance, but you leave your stuff lying in plain sight and expect it to be waiting for you when you come back? It made her want to teach the woman a lesson. But this wish only camouflaged the deeper feeling Sasha always had: that at, tender wallet, offering itself to her hand-it seemed so dull, so life-as-usual to just leave it there rather than seize the moment, accept the challenge, take the leap, fly the coop, throw caution to the wind, live dangerously (\"I get it,\" Coz, her therapist, said), and take the fucking thing.\n\n[...]\n\nSasha sighed. She'd told Coz the plumber story about a month ago, and he'd found a way to bring it up at almost every session since. The plumber was an old man, sent by Sasha's landlord to investigate a leak in the apartment below hers. He'd appeared in Sasha's doorway, tufts of gray on his head, and within a minute-boom-he'd hit the floor and crawled under her bathtub like an animal fumbling its way into a familiar hole. The fingers he'd groped toward the bolts behind the tub were grimed to cigar stubs, and reaching made his sweatshirt hike up, exposing a soft white back. Sasha turned away, stricken by the old man's abasement, anxious to leave for her temp job, except that the plumber was talking to her, asking about the length and frequency of her showers. \"I never use it,\" she told him curtly. \"I shower at the gym.\" He nodded without acknowledging her rudeness, apparently used to it. Sasha's nose began to prickle; she shut her eyes and pushed hard on both temples.\n\nOpening her eyes, she saw the plumber's tool belt lying on the floor at her feet. It had a beautiful screwdriver in it, the orange translucent handle gleaming like a lollipop in its worn leather loop, the silvery shaft sculpted, sparkling. Sasha felt herself contract around the object in a single yawn of appetite; she needed to hold the screwdriver, just for a minute. She bent her knees and plucked it noiselessly from the belt.\n\n",

        "text": "Hello! I'm very interested in modernism and I do my best to try to understand the motives and the philosophy behind every avant-garde movement, regardless of whether I find it appealing (in fact, I am usually more keen on understanding the movements I don't find appealing at all).\n\nRecently I finished reading Paul Claudel's drama \"Break of Noon\" (Partage de midi) and I am ashamed to admit that I did not enjoy it at all. I am aware that art isn't necessarily supposed to be instant pleasure - but I don't understand the point of writing for theatre the way symbolists do. The symbols that Claudel employs seem to me either laughably obvious (the grave shaped like the letter omega) or something so elusive that it feels like it has no worthwhile meaning at all (the raised hand at the very end of the play). Besides, how could something truly meaningful ever be represented with something so basic?\n\nHowever, the thing I have a bigger problem with is the dialogue itself. If I am understanding the symbolist approach correctly, the idea is that the play should resist the material limitations of realist and naturalist aesthetics, to express a psychological/emotional experience without being bound by plot conventions, etc. In the end, that just seems like a bad excuse to avoid having to develop a gripping plot or dramatic tension, and most of the time characters are just standing calmly and expressing their thoughts to one another in such a bland and boring fashion. Maybe that approach could work if the language they utilized had any interesting imagery or lyricism to it, but sometimes it feels like characters are reading cliffsnotes about a better play to one another - was Claudel just a bad poet?\n\nHe is immensely respected in France, so I feel stupid for not having felt anything reading his play. I greatly thank in advance to anyone who can enlighten me.",

Consider the following high praises, which represent only \nsmall portion of Shelley's quotables: \n\n&gt;• Poetry is \"the interpenetration of a diviner nature through our own.\"    \n&gt;• Poetry “redeems from decay the visitations of the divinity of man.\"\n\np. 106\n\n&gt;• Poetry \"makes immortal all that is best and most beautiful in the world.”   \n• Poetry \"is the record of the best and happiest moments of the happiest and \nbest minds.\"       \n• Poetry \"defeats the curse which binds us to be subjected to the accident of \nsurrounding impressions.\" \n\n&gt;In fact. regarding Plato's banishment of poets from the Republic, Shelley argued that poets have been essential to society since the beginning. Not only was Plato himself a poet, Shelley noted along with Sidney, but \"the great instrument of moral good is the \nimagination\" and poets are actually the \"unacknowledged legislators\" of society.\n\n",

I have not read Heidegger or much of phenomenology outside Derrida, however, which might be partially why I'm limited here. I have my own interpretation but was wondering if a better one could be found or if mine is problematic or unclear. Thanks.\n\nI always interpreted it like this: if A was \"always-already\" B, then that means that it was already the case that A and B were always equal. And I think the reason this concept holds critical tension, is that it behaves like a plot twist for the discussion - one tends to *discover* that A was \"always-already\" B, when one has previously thought either that A and B were separate, or that A had to be somehow transformed to *become* B.\n\nSo to persistently search for what was \"always-already,\" under the right circumstances, can lead to a dramatic, twisting discussion that ultimately arrives at some root - some 'truth.' I imagine that in the right situation, reconfiguring one's understanding of the genealogy of a concept into its 'always-already' will behave like a radical deconstruction, either a new reading of the concept entirely or a return to some more appropriate, less problematic philosophy surrounding it.\n\nDoes that make sense? Am I in the right territory here - and if not, what is a good explanation?",

I have two questions, both of which take three books as a point of departure: Vladimir Nabokov's Pale Fire, Mark Z. Danielewski's House of Leaves, and J.J. Abrams and Doug Dorst's S. (Ship of Theseus).\n\n1. Obviously all of these books are fiction, and highly experimental works at that. Yet they all share a form: fictional commentary on a fictional work that is itself presented in full to the reader. I wonder what (sub-)genre these books might fit into? Again, obviously labels such as \"postmodern,\" \"metafiction,\" and \"fiction\" clearly apply. But is there some other/more specific name for this formal feature?\n\n2. What other works--especially outside the 20th-C. American context, which is my area of study--might also share this form? Again, the really interesting thing for me is that they're all full commentaries on full fictional works--readers are offered not just the commentaries but also the works that are commented on.\n\nI would say something like Borges' Pierre Menard might fit a parallel bill--but Quixote was a precedent text, and I'm interested more in fictional texts (\"fictional\" taken broadly, including poetry and prose works) written for the occasion of the accompanying commentary, if that makes any sense.",

        "text": "In my studies I have been quite concerned with the prominence of critical theory in some of my literature classes. The problem I have with these classes is that they implore us to analyse books within feminist or marxist paradigms and often make us read essays which analyse books in such paradigms. The problem I have with this is that it has no relation to the way in which I read those poems/novels. For example, I do not read Emily Dickinson as a feminist, with a focus on the power dynamics between the male and the female selves. Nor have I ever found such a thesis to be convincing - on the contrary, such a thesis seems rather \"cooked\" as though Dickinson's poems were manipulated to fit such a thesis when the opposite should be the case! \n\nWhen I read Dickinson's poetry \"gender theory\" has never crossed my mind. I read themes like pain, longing, hope and the sublime. \n\nAnd so what is even the point of applying critical theory to literary studies? If we are to be honest in our pursuit of understanding literature shouldn't we try instead to observe literature for what it is instead of applying a \"feminist/marxist critique\"? I'm just not convinced by any essay to read Dickinson's poetry from a feminist perspective, they are and always will be deeply human poems. And with that said, I just don't see the point of critical theory. \n\nFurthermore, are there any scholastic counter-cultural movements right now against critical theory? It seems based on my readings of her essays that Helen Vendler would represent someone who works to elucidate literature without the application of critical theory. ",

I am not a formal student of literature, but I take reading very seriously and I like to delve into texts in the deepest way possible and try to extract all possible meaning. The way I have been approaching studying literature is that I have focused on the major canonical works such as Dostoevsky, Proust, Kafka, Mann, Etc and I focus on getting a deeper understanding of a limited number of works rather than doing a light reading of a wide range. When it comes to ancient literature, however, I have considerably more difficulty, both in holding focus and doing any sort of interpretation. To my mind, when I don't appreciate a critically important text, it's me that's wrong, not the text. That said, I can't seem to pull anything of value out of the Iliad (or the Odyssey for that matter). I know that this is a cardinal sin in the literature world, but to me, it just seems like endless, meaningless, depraved violence with no deeper meaning, or commentary on humanity whatsoever. I look at it almost with shame, as if to say \"If this is all that ancient humanity was, I see no reason to celebrate it.\" I know there is pretty much a 100% chance I'm missing something huge, so that is the reason for this post.

For example, I was doing a bit of research on a Star Trek related topic a few weeks ago (I know, not exactly literature, but related) and I was stunned by how little I was able to find. I'm sure my search wasn't sufficient, because there's got to be more published on that subject. \n\nI know that academic fields can differ significantly from each other on how they publish their information. Whereas in science the most relevant information is always published in journals, scholars in some other fields (e.g. Philosophy) like to publish their ideas in books. I'm not sure where literary studies fits in. \n\nSo I was wondering if I could get some advice on the subject. Particularly from people who have first-hand experience on doing this kind of research (graduate students maybe?). What's your step by step process?",

Why did he choose to place these political criticisms in this form, and what were the motivations that led him to write the incredibly detailed story of his journey through Hell, Purgatory and Heaven? As for the second part of my question, I think it is potentially unclear so will try to expand. Is there a possibility that Dante was writing about something that he genuinely believed had happened to him, or does he place himself into the story as a writing device?",

I write for myself, not only because I enjoy the act of authoring, but because I'm extremely dissatisfied contemporary literature, and have long had a difficult time finding fiction in English from the last few decades that I enjoyed reading, that was not only topically interesting but spoke to my values and engaged my ideas, so I decided to write literature (as of today, 14 short stories, 3 dramas and so-far the first third of a novel, all in verse) that I wanted to read. I gave a professor of mine 1 of my dramas and 4 of my short stories to read, and he suggested that I submit some of my work to a publisher.   \n\n\nPart of me wants to, but another part of me is considering the question *what is the point of publishing my work?* (aside from the money that I could make). Ideally, my reason for publishing would be that I have something to say/a message to convey and I want to share it, but I wonder if literature is the appropriate medium for making a statement, since it seems that so many people think that the author's intent is irrelevant, and that it's valid to interpret the work to be saying something other than that. In all of my work I try I convey a message, but if my intended message is meaningless then what's the point of conveying a message at all? A perfect example of this is how *Fahrenheit 451* is widely interpreted to be about and opposed to censorship, Ray Bradbury has repeatedly said that it isn't that, and that he was trying to convey his anti-television sentiment. For me, that means that meaning of the book is that, end of story, and that for anyone to say that it isn't is akin to someone telling me about landscape architecture or their new pair of ice skates and me replying that I've interpreted what they've said to be about tea being better than coffee, and saying that I'm no less correct than they are because their intent is meaningless — it seems that their saying anything at all was pointless.\n\n\n\nThat's not say that what a work means for a reader, in the sense of feelings or inspiration they get from the text isn't an entirely personal and interpretive thing. It's that, in my view the work has a fixed meaning, it means whatever the author intended it to mean, and it's only the personal meaning that a reader derives from a text that is subject to interpretation.\n\n\nIf I do decide to send my work to a publisher, and if they choose to publish my work, I'd like to add a preface to each explaining what the piece means. If not, and other people who didn't write the piece feel empowered to attach a meaning to my work that wasn't my meaning, what's the point?",

        "text": "I think I have a problem that I'm having a hard time to identify and I need some help with it. Obviously I am going to ask my professor about it, but I wanted to write it down here first in the meantime.\n\nFor the record, I am a philosophy student (this is very relevant to my situation I think) doing a double major (my second major is in English literature). English is also my second language, although I've been speaking it for at least 5-6 years and I have an almost native level.\n\nI think it's been two or three semesters now that I'm lost when it comes to analyzing texts (but especially poems) in my English courses. I'm so confused about the rigor and methodology used. In my philosophy courses, we do exegetical readings, we only care about *what is written down*. We try to understand what's the argument being conveyed in the text and the tendency was for me to learn to refer to literal textual evidences.\n\nI don't know if it's me, but I feel like there's a lack of grounding when my classmates make arguments about a text in my English lit courses. One semester I had to read Poe's *The Masque of the Red Death* and they spent an insane amount of time arguing about the symbolism of the colors in the story for instance. I'm not denying that it's wrong, but I just don't understand why most of class discussions in my courses revolve around how a text *makes the reader feel* and there was no real basis for what they said (by that I mean they didn't really use the text to prove that their interpretation was *really* what the author intended). I feel most of the class discussions are like \"perhaps it means this... perhaps it means that... how does it make the reader feel? what impressions do we get from the text?\"\n\nTo give you another example that really baffled me: Last week we read Blake's *The Chimney Sweeper*. I raised the point in class that the poem seemed to have a tension or a contradiction since it was arguing about the horrible working conditions and treatment of children, but then encouraging such behavior in the last line by offering a theological argumentation. My prof said that I needed to look at the tone of the poem to see some sort of sarcasm. I was so surprised by that because she seemed (to my understanding) to be orienting towards a more freely interpretation of the text rather than refereeing to textual evidence (I don't know how to interpret the tone of a poem when it's read and not spoken).\n\n\nAnyway, does any of you see what I'm talking about? Have you ever encountered students with this problem? I'm not saying these things out of arrogance, I really want to improve (I need to, most of my bad marks are in English lit) and understand what I need to change to write better papers.\n\nThanks.\n\nEDIT: To give you another concrete example, I feel most of my papers when they come to analyzing a poem or two, all I have to do is just compare and contrast form with content, say the author uses 2-3 literary devices and pull out of my hat any possible argument I can make to say how the text uses these devices. I honestly feel I've always been making stuff up in my papers (and I got good grades, not A's but definitely B's) somehow; and this more than in my philosophy classes where I can actually be wrong if my interpretation is not accurate.",

Another random question: There are a few instances where an author will write a novel but later in their careers write some kind of condensed version/alternative/\"fanfiction\"-esque variation of it. The two examples that jump to my head is the short story version of Yasunari Kawabata's *Snow Country* and Junichiro Tanizaki's novel *The Maids*, which is *The Makioka Sisters* told from the perspectives of the maids and servants of the household.\n\nI was wondering if there was anything similar to this that we find elsewhere in literature?\n\nThanks a lot in advance!",
