If the announcement says submit a cover letter- submit a cover letter.  It can be bad.  Most are.  But submitting a cover letter, when the instructions request a cover letter, demonstrates you can follow instructions.  If the instructions ask for references, provide references.  Don't tell me references will be provided upon request.  They were requested.  In the job announcement.  That you didn't read. \n\nIf you're applying to a job...attach a resume'.\n\nWe hire people who pay attention.  Paying attention keeps people safe in the field.  Paying attention ensures we collect great data.  We hire people who put in some effort.  We hire people who want to make a good impression.  If you're applying to a state agency, your application shouldn't be addressed to the US Fish and Wildlife Service.  Copying and pasting is fine- I do it too, but you \\*need\\* to pay attention to what you're sending and who you're sending it to.  \n\nPeople are fallible.  People make mistakes. And if you need to send an updated resume' or cover letter, that's alright.  But when that position closes, we have to make a decision based on the information you've provided.  \n\nIt's simple stuff.  In this instance, it eliminated two-thirds of applicants.  If it's a position you really want, if it's a position worth applying for, then don't disqualify yourself right out of the gate.",

I am planning to go to graduate school, but am unsure which path to follow. I feel like a Master's in GIS is unnecessary, and that most bio programs will not utilize GIS much. I was thinking about conservation biology programs or something similar. Does anyone have experience working in these two fields and have advice for future schooling? Thank you ! &lt;3",

        "text": "I find it very frustrating that people don’t realize the illegal insect trade and poaching is just as bad as bad as it is with mammals and other animals with equal economic incentive to sellers. I’m trying to do research on rare praying mantis species, and the dragon mantis sells for around $1000usd! There’s been like 50 sightings of the dragon mantis catalogued—obviously the people that take them don’t go put it in a database, only scientists would—and people keep them as pets. Species are taken from their homes, being driven to extinction, and becoming invasive at a rapid rate. It feels like no one cares. I would love a mantis not from the US, but I’m not self centered. \n\nI’m not sure how this will be received here, since some of you are scientists, some are just interested in insects, and maybe some are being targeted by this. But I needed to say it. And if you are the type of person I’m talking about, be better please :)\n\nWhen I finish college in a few months, I want to help praying mantis research and conservation, as well as reducing the illegal insect trade. I hope I can make some sort of difference",

I keep hearing all these stories of conservationists who learned about how bad things were when they were kids and were inspired to go into their fields, but to be honest I go to class every day and hear about how something else in nature is going downhill and it just makes me want to kill myself. And I have tried before.\n\nIt's not like this information is new to me. I've been hearing all this stuff since I was 5 years old, and I always thought I would help the environment when I got older. But it's just really *getting* to me now, not only being reminded of it every single day but seeing that things are getting worse and worse and worse and worse and worse.\n\nI know that logically me being dead won't help anything, and maybe theoretically I could do some good with my life, but it really feels like it's too much to have to exist in a world where nature is degrading every day, and it's not like I can escape it.\n\nWhat keeps you going?
