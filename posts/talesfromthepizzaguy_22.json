        "text": "Ok, I obviously have to preface this by saying that I'm not saying I'm not going to get on hands and knees to help customers out, because one or two people assumed that with my first post on this account, and it's not accurate to who I am as a CSR. So let's just get that out of that way.\n\nMy big question to the other insiders here is; how do you feel about customers calling in not knowing what they want? Because when someone calls my store and asks to order pizza, and I ask what they want, and they reply with \"Hmmm, I dunno. Hey, kids, what do you want on your pizza!?\"\n\n\"I want pepperoni!\"\n\n\"No, your father hates pepperoni.\"\n\n\"Then chicken!\"\n\n\"We don't eat chicken in this house.\"\n\n\"Extra cheese?\"\n\n\"Nope, too fattening.\"\n\n\"Extra sauce?...\"\n\n\"Do you want the pizza to taste like a tomato swimming pool?\"\n\nAnd then goes on and in for literally 2-3 minutes of the same deliberation of the customer and their friends/kids/SO's/etc. and me sitting on the other end of the phone waiting for them to make up their minds.\n\nLike I said before, I'm cool with helping people out in trying to find what they want. In fact, I *love* talking to people on a more personable (not personal) level and see what they want from our store. But I just simply cannot STAND customers who call in, and waste up to 5, and in super extreme cases 17 minutes (yes, this actually happened) minutes of my time by talking to their friends and family about what they want on their pizzas. And these people don't even ask for specials or what toppings we offer. They just call, I greet them and ask them carry out or delivery, and they say either or, then discuss amongst themselves what they want on their pizzas. Like, what am I, your keeper? All the while there's customers in carry out, other phones on hold, and labels to the floor, underneath the cut table. So many other things I could be doing with my time than waiting on the phone hearing you talk about how you hate spinach on your gluten free pizza. \n\nI don't know. This is the only thing that genuinely irks me about working at a pizza place. Literally everything else can be tolerable. Am I a bad CSR for getting irked at just this situation in particular? It couldn't just be me, I don't think.\n\nWhat are your opinions? I'm curious to see other insiders views on this particular situation and others similar!",

Didn't even ask permission, just had a note on my slip to call upon arrival, then on the phone told me to knock on the door and then give my phone to the lady that answered. She never answered and he had me wait there knocking for a while, making my next delivery late. I then found out later when another driver came in, that the same guy called yesterday and did the same thing. The only difference being that the lady actually answered the door, and was on this drivers phone for about half an hour, with the driver waiting for the payment.... funny thing is, the lady never paid, and after getting threatened with calling the cops, the guy who made the order said he would go into the store and pay later in the night. Anddd he never did, so pretty ballsy on his part to call again. Suffice to say he's banned from ordering from us.\nJust found it super bizarre, who orders delivery to use someones personal phone??",

        "text": "I don't entirely know where to begin with this so I'll go ahead and say this will be a pretty long story about my experiences.\n\nSo to begin I got my first car - paid solely by me I might add (I'm proud of that) - in early January, and my job as a driver shortly after (about 2 weeks later). It was a bit unusual to me, being my first job and all, drove there during my break period at college with 30 minutes to spare and ended up unexpectedly getting interviewed on the spot. I was a bit worried about time but didn't want to say anything cause I figured that would be unprofessional, needless to say I ended up getting the job after a ~~quick~~.. long trip to the DMV for my driving record.\n\nSo now I have a job! I was extremely happy the first 15-30 days or so, loving life enjoying every day of work, but not too much time later it very quickly started getting very tedious and annoying (maybe just because it was my first job?). When I signed up I was informed about the fairly long list of tasks I would have to do when not delivering, such as dishes, sweeping, taking orders via phones, folding boxes etc.. but I wasn't informed that I would be put into extremely uncomfortable situations that I wasn't even remotely trained to handle.\n\nOn that note I'll start with this. I was originally told I would be in a 1 month 'training' period before becoming a fully fledged member of the team. Then 2 days after I got the job I was sent out on my first delivery alone to an apartment complex at night. At this time I had gone with other drivers on a total of 4 deliveries to 3 houses and 1 school, so I wasn't prepared for this at all. The delivery was more or less a complete disaster because there were 2 apartment complexes right next to each other and I used the gate code given to me to get into 1 so I figured I had the right one since the code worked.. right?.. **no**(note that I couldn't see the apartment address due to it being night and my inexperience led me to believe the code working would lead to the right apartment). Basically morale of this story is I went into the wrong complex, knocked on an unoccupied apartment door, called the customer's phone number to try to resolve this and they didn't answer, and finally called my workplace who then told me to come back if they don't pick up after 10 minutes of calling every few minutes. They never picked up so I did as I was told and called them again to confirm I should head back, and literally the second I walked in the customer called us. Let's just say she was unhappy and thankfully they ended up sending another more experienced driver to deliver it. Luckily that was the only time I technically failed a delivery while working there, but she got her pizza approximately 15 minutes within the estimate so it wasn't super bad, or at least it wasn't to me. In her words it was extremely unsatisfactory and I should've been fired, and maybe I should have, but it was my second day on the job and first delivery ever so I wasn't fired.\n\n\nThat's probably my most interesting story to share with you guys, I have a few others but not nearly as interesting. Another thing I want to share though is the experiences I had at this place. Let me just start by saying the management was horrible. There were 4 supervisors total and 1 store manager, when the store manager was there and 2 of the less common supervisors everything ran fine and dandy, everyone was productive and doing what they should be etc.. but the other 2 main supervisors (I say main because they worked most often) when they were there without the manager everything was complete and utter chaos. Drinks and food cluttering the driver's small workstation to prepare the deliveries, everyone slacking off and sometimes even sitting down playing on their phones or sitting in the front WITH CUSTOMERS talking to them. I avoided doing either of those because if I did we wouldn't have gotten anything done. When that happened I - the delivery driver - had to prepare the pizza orders, put them in, cut them, box/tray them, take phone orders, help customers using the cash register (which I wasn't trained a second to do), take phone orders, and deliver the pizzas. I was furious at them for making me do all of their jobs, but at the same time I alone couldn't cause any changes. Even after enlightening the manager. Finally, after 3 1/2 months I gave my manager a 2 week notice which I extended to 4 weeks out of kindness for her due to her having family issues which may or may not have been why no changes were occurring. After those 4 weeks I was finally free again, now I'm focusing solely on college trying to get my A+ Cert. for tech support.\n\nAnyways, sorry for the long story/rant. It feels better to get that off my chest. I'll leave the company nameless out of respect because their pizzas are actually pretty badass and I'm sure not all of them are like that one store I worked at. Hopefully my next job will be a little better though, kind of scared for my next one after that haha.",

        "text": "Not a story, just a list of things that sets up your shift for failure. From a managers point of view that is, also am an ex-driver. Feel free to add on or disagree.\n\n* **\"Dishonest delivery time\"**\nGiving the default time when there is a full delivery screen and 2 drivers on the clock. It's so automated for people to say the default time at the end of the order taking, just say \"Oops I lied it's actually so-and-so time\" better to be truthful than to get an eager and unwanted customer call later on that could potentially stall the insider and manager duo from clearing an already growing order screen on the make line. Here's how the numbers work, 30-45, 35-50, 45-60 and 60-75 after that you're just crying for them not to say yes to a 2 hour wait.\n\n* **\"Enabling bad work ethics\"**\nCo-worker comes in 15-20 mins late everyday he is scheduled, clocks in and heads back to the back entrance to light up a smoke. Said co-worker also calls in  once a week sick, after begging for more hours prior to these reoccurring shenanigans. If all you get is a text that they can't come in—then they are lazy and don't care. A real worker will call the store and not text the manager that's not even scheduled that day but instead would discuss doctors notes if needed and if they could make up time, because these are the people who have real responsibilities in life and need the money. Don't ever enable a closing or opening driver to work there with their lingering ethics because they risk of putting the other drivers with higher levels of stress and pressure on said closing or opening shifts. They also enable other drivers to think it's okay to monkey do. These are the type of drivers who will sit in their car, waiting around the corner of the store until close—hoping the other driver has finished all the dishes and closing duties. Even more fun, leaving dishes for the morning crew that had nothing to do with it because the other closing driver isn't salaried past close.\n\n* **\"Dishes\"**\nDrivers, stop picking favorite duties other than dishes. Don't start doing garbages 4 hours before close on half empty containers. You leave your self more work at the last hour of the shift or worse make the manager hold your hands while they do dishes with you. Favoritism should not be allowed. Do duties in a productive order. Garbages at the end of the shift as well as sweeping as to not track around dirt for the next 4 hours, unless of course if it's slow all is void if labor policy is permitting. No one wants to stay past their salaried schedule to hold your hand.\n\n* **\"First Day Drivers\"**\nTrain them on the phones and inside work before venturing them off into the driver life. Can't stand how many times I have 3 drivers pretending to look busy once a phone rings or a customer comes through only to ostrisize the insider, if at all one, and the manager on the shift making food together who are most likely staring right at your sly selves while all said is occurring. Although the customers sometimes see this and tip sympathetically.\n\n\n* **\"Pre-tips on the detail section of the drivers screen\"**\nLOL what can I say, I can't oversee them all the time but I know drivers nitpick at them for the best runs. Just stop it, take your double, triple or whatever and don't leave a single unless time isn't permitted to wait for said single.\n\nThere is more, I'll let you fill it in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

There was no order in our system for him, so I grabbed a manager and they figured that someone had taken his order and forgot to finish it out. They sent him out a comped delivery and it was over and done with. No biggie.\n\nThe other night, I took a phone call from a person who placed his order all the way up until it came time to get his cc number. He asked me to hold on while he got it out, then the line went dead. I tried to call him back and got no answer, so I left his order screen up and let my manager and the other employees know I had lost connection with this caller and that his order was waiting on this certain screen for when he called back. \n\nHowever, later that evening I realized that this could have been what happened with the comped order from a couple weeks ago. All they have to do is call back later and say they placed an order when actually the customer themselves didn't finish it. The call logs only show the phone number and time the call was received, they don't include records of if an order was halfway entered or anything. \n\nThere's no way for us to suspend a transaction or note that we got disconnected and often it's drivers answering phones in between runs so you can even just ask \"Hey did you start an order that never got finished?\"\n\nSo anyhow, I wonder if that previous guy had called and hung up to scam a free meal later, or possibly an intoxicated mistake? \n\nHumans are weird either way.

        "text": "Happened about a week ago now around 5/6pm\n\nI am a driver for Dominos and my manager will sometimes buy food for us to nibble on if they are feeing good. Taco Bell had just come out with these new Naked Chicken Chips so one of our drivers went with the money to the Taco Bell that is right next door to our location to order some.\n\nSo our driver is over there and is waiting for the order (about 10 minutes) but a delivery comes up so they have to leave. My manager goes over to tell the driver to leave and my manager will wait for the food instead. Another 10-15 minutes go by and no food. My manager then asks the Taco Bell employee where the food is and the TB employee responds that our driver already left with the food. As my manager watched the driver leave with no food this was obviously a problem.\n\nSo my manager explains this and the employee continues to say that our driver left with it. Eventually my manager asks for the TB manager and talks through the problem, gets the food and leaves.\n\nBUT WAIT THERES MORE \n\nA few minutes later The TB employee (for now on they will just be TB) barges into our story and starts asking if we are the driver who ordered. Sorry not asking, screaming. Literally screaming. The driver that TB was looking for was not in because of the afore mentioned delivery. \n\nMy manager approaches TB and asks her to either order or please exit the store. TB starts yelling at my manager saying she has security footage of our driver leaving Taco Bell with the chicken chips. My manager thinking this is hilarious offers TB $10,000 if they can produce the tape. My manager owns several several locations so this offer of $10K was legit, I promise. TB, taken aback, asserts she doesn't have to show us the evidence of the apparent theft. An offer of $10K for the video footage is more than reasonable. If I'm not mistaken that footage would have to be submitted for evidence. \n\nAnyways, after TB's response, my manager offers again and TB starts on screaming that we are all going to jail for this theft (that never happened). I mean all of us too. TB said we would all be held accountable (lol). At which point I ask \"If you had this footage, why would you have to ask which one of us is 'drivers name'?\" TB had both taken the order from our driver and watched them leave AND apparently had video footage of them with the food. TB then storms out thinking that they had won the battle.\n\nWithin the next hour the Taco Bell (which is open until 3AM on that day of the week) stopped operation of all inside service to hold a meeting (was able to see inside while driving by on deliveries). I don't know what was said at their meeting but I think TB lost more than just the battle over the chicken chips.\n\nTL;DR Taco Bell employee accuses entire Dominos store of stealing a few orders of chicken chips and causes their Taco Bell to shut down and hold a meeting. (I don't know if that person is still with Taco Bell or not)\n\nI read the rules before posting but don't know if any of this infringes. Sorry if it did but this was a story I needed to tell people.",

        "text": "Pretty sure I'm the only one at my shop that even knows what reddit is but just to be safe All I will say is that it's a franchise Jimmy John's in one of the hottest part of the US.\n\n  I love my job, it took me less than a month to figure out who the regulars are and often times we already have their food made by the time they order. The bulk of our business comes from the local car dealerships with a good number of orders to residential customers as well. I get stiffed on tips and paid in nothing but change occasionally but most of the regulars are good- I get a lot of them that will drop $10 on a $6 order, a couple of the dealership salesmen will write in a $5 tip in for any order stuff like that. A 4 hour shift can net me about 50 in tips on average and a few days I've walked out with closer to 100 in my pocket. The problem with this great gig though is not surprisingly the owners. The staff are great people but they are hobbled from being really amazing by stupid rules from mangalment.\n\nSome of the issues are simple things that make me twitch on a regular basis having come from a state that grades restaurants on health checks instead of just giving a pass or fail. The meat slicer isn't cleaned between meats at the owner's direction- they will slice ham, turkey, salami, capicola, and roast beef all in one go without even attempting to wipe it down and I don't know the last time the blade was taken off and cleaned and sharpened properly, food is simply wrapped in plastic and tossed in the fridge at night instead of tossed out after being out all day. Until I came along nobody even knew how to clean the tea urns so they will spend days or weeks just being emptied at the end of the night, sprayed with water, and put back to await the next batch to be brewed. Our store has a reputation among residential customers for slow deliveries- sometimes as much as 45 minutes from order to delivery on food that takes less than a minute to prepare because they refuse to schedule more than one driver after 4pm resulting in whoever is doing deliveries often going from one end of our 3mi delivery radius to the other in the middle of rush hour traffic only to get back to the store and find orders have been sitting for 30 minutes. Delivery does everything the inshop workers do when they aren't driving so we all know how to make subs, slice meat and cheese, bag orders, take orders, etc. basically we get paid less than minimum wage to do the same things people making $9/hr do plus run orders.\n\nOur GM asked to be demoted back to being a driver after she fired one guy for stealing and closing the store an hour early and the owners hired him as GM at their other store when he complained to them and told her firing decisions had to be approved by them and any time we request more staff we are simply told they can't afford it. Which is BS- their other store makes close to 50,000 a month in straight profit but they keep running them like separate places, I discovered that our delivery range is more than double what Corporate set for them when they opened because they felt it was too small and they wouldn't make money from it, so they broke their corporate contract and pay a 3,000 a month fine to corporate every month to be able to deliver to more people while raising delivery times. And people that have worked for them for years are regularly overlooked for promotions and in the year I've been with the place nobody has gotten a raise. They don't provide any sort of breaks which as a driver I'm fine with but our in shop staff works 40+ hours a week and nowhere in their often 10 hours shifts do they get a break or even the legally required lunch break.\n\nFinally having reached the end of her rope our GM quit- she intended to give her 2 weeks except the owners flipped out the wife broke down in tears and husband was so upset he started screaming and managed to put his hand through a wall so her 2 weeks became a \"here's my keys have a good life\". The next day our other day shift driver quit without notice and went to another store where all she'll be expected to do is make deliveries and will make $2/hr more. I'm leaving at the end of the month to head back to the midwest with family after more than a year of occasionally working for a month straight without a day off, staying 2-3 hours over my shift to cover other people, and paying out of pocket for basic needs like a new handle for a broom to replace the one our cheapskate owner broke and duct taped back together. I gave notice already but what they don't know is I'm not the only one leaving that day. The other two inshop managers are quitting as well as the new guy they hired last week. See our old GM is their roommate and her husband is getting rebased and she's offered to take them with her. The other day driver is retiring now that he had his 65th birthday last week so next month they will be stuck with themselves, 2 part time drivers- one who calls off every other weekend for \"school stuff\" and the other who has another job and is frequently an hour or more late. So yeah they treated all of us like crap and in response we all decided to vote with our feet and are leaving them with only the unreliable and frequently worthless staff.\n\n**Update:** So today was fun. On top of being the only driver some idiot in city planning decided to turn the portion of 4 lane road I use to get into the parking lot into a 1 lane while construction crews tore up a good chunk of it- oh and close the exit on the north side of the lot to do the same. However we had our monthly corporate visit basically our ~~auditor~~ \"business adviser\"  came through and reviewed how things were going. this is the first time she's been in since our GM quit that neither owner was present. After having a heart attack about the cross contamination risk presented by our slicing rules she asked about our delivery range noting that I was sometimes taking 30-40 minutes to return to the store. We told her it was 7-9 minutes drive or roughly 3 miles depending on when and which owner you asked. Turns out that our delivery range is actually 5 minutes and the fine we thought they were paying wasn't correct- after pulling up and printing out all our orders for the last month she started mapping them and gave up after the first dozen before calling the head office to verify their franchise contract. Apparently they have been going in and deleting most of the deliveries and re-entering them as inshop in the system the day before she visits because she'd been giving advance notice as a courtesy and didn't today. depending on which contract they signed they could either lose their Franchise license or be charged $1,000 for every delivery outside the range they were given. As an idea of the cost on that- today was slow and they would have had to pay out around $20K just for what I did between 10-4, who knows what they would have to pay when the dinner shift get's added. Our old GM also stopped by to say hi and I learned that not only is she reporting some of her issues to the states equivalent of a health board but she contacted the labor board about some issues she noticed with time keeping. And another fun fact- they don't remove login privileges from any of the systems when someone quits or get's fired so she could still login and play hell with the computers but settled for letting our auditor pull up accurate files. For those that commented on it though- I'm aware federal law is rather lacking on the lunch/break rules but in my current state your required to provide at least a 30min lunch during which the employee isn't required to do any work related activity if a shift runs more than 6 hours.",

She puts them on hold and says that they're saying I was supposed to make an order for them but must have forgotten. No idea what she's talking about, so I say I'll take care of it. I pick up to talk to them and the conversation goes something as follows:\n\n\nMe: This is AnObviousDisinterest, I was the driver tonight. Can I help you?\n\nThem: Yeah this is John Doe at the Baymont in room 129. You said you'd make an order for delivery to us. \n\nMe: Uhh... Were you the couple leaving the pool as I was dropping off another delivery?\n\nThem: Yeah that's right.\n\nMe: I'm sorry if there was some sort of miscommunication, but I'm the delivery driver. I don't take orders while I'm out on deliveries. You were looking at my shirt and asking which pizza place I was from. As you were walking away and down the hallway I said that we'd be open until 10.\n\nThem: Ah, well shoot man. What If I tipped ya $10?\n\nMe: I'm sorry but the ovens are off, and everything has been cleaned up and put away. I'm just finishing mopping the floor now.\n\nThem: Oh I see. Well is any of your competition open and still delivering?\n\nMe: I'm not sure you'd have to call around and ask. Again, I'm sorry if there was some sort of miscommunication. Goodnight.\n\n\nConversation was close to that... I cant remember every detail, but has anyone else had people think that they can place orders with you or other drivers? I've had people ask to place orders with me, but I always tell them to call the store. This is the first time I've had someone think that I actually placed an order for them...",

They'll insert their card, and just hit \"OK\" when the tip screen prompt comes up saying \"ENTER TIP AMOUNT: $0.00\"\n\nI get that people are cheap, I get that people just want their food as quickly and painlessly as possible. But it's like I'm being out of line by explaining to people that me not getting tipped wouldn't work. \n\nI don't feel that I should have to explain to people that without tips, even on a busy night, I would have to do 4 deliveries an hour to make minimum wage. I'm using my own vehicle, my own fuel, my own insurance, etc.\n\nI'm wondering if some people just assume that I'm making like $13/hr regardless and that the tips are just a bonus on top of that, and that I'm rolling in money? Certainly I can't be that rich when I roll up in my 2007 Corolla with the screeching brakes.\n\nJust frustrating as hell. This, combined with a number of other factors, has led me to start looking for an alternate form of employment. It's really not all it's cut out to be.",

This takes a few minutes on each pan on the cut table to unstick them before putting them in the box. A few minutes might not sound like an issue...but during a rush with things speeding through the oven...it is physically impossible to have enough time to unstick the pans without getting backed up on the ovens. \n\nThat's not all though! Remember when I said I do closing dishes? The pans usually go back to the dishes with enormous pieces of crust still dried and stuck to the edges. We cannot use metal objects to scrape the crust out. Literally nothing works to get the crust out of these pans...\n\nI even tried scraping them with my fingernails and sliced underneath my fingernail open...this was how my manager told me I should be getting the crust off! \n\nEvery night of closing dishes, just trying to clean the pans themselves takes around 30 minutes to an hour since these \"so called\" nonstick pans are covered in ridiculous amounts of crispy crust fused to the sides of them!!\n\nBasically our cheapest pizza takes more time and effort for everyone than a regular pizza does...it makes no sense at all.\n\nI even heard that the company was apparently suing the place that made our \"nonstick\" pans...but I question if that's even true...because we still sell pans more than anything else because of how cheap they are!!\n\n",

Another order pops up right on the way there. Great, I'll take both! I take the first order and they needed a good deal of change back. I have $3 and $2 in change left. I go to the far delivery and their total is 33.64. The lady at the door hands me a 40 and asks for 5 back.

I get there and the lady's boyfriend answers the door (he's the one who called and complained). I told him I already gave her 3 dollar bills and the rest was 3.36. I started counting the money back to him and getting the change and he says to keep a dollar and the change. I said no thank you....I drove all the way back here to give him his change back so that's what I was going to do. He immediately got mad and explained how he was once a delivery driver and he NEVER ran out of change. I (tried) to explain to him how we keep less than $20 on us and sometimes we take multiple orders at once and run out of change. He went on to say how it doesn't make sense to him.\n\n I was so mad at him for not taking the flipping change and demanding dollars back. What does it matter? It all spends the same. \n\n",

        "text": "So this happened about 4 months ago but I still remember the incident very vividly. Also, I'm new to the community so I'll post it now.\n\nI was delivering a pizza as per usual. Drove to the house. Grabbed the pizza. Went to the door. Rang the bell. All was good. Alas, the owner didn't come to the door. So, as I usually do, I knock loudly just incase the doorbell is broken or they didnt hear it. An approximately 45 year old man opens the door. Let's name him Chad. Chad is a nice enough guy. \"Hello, Chad. Did you order a pizza from Palio's Pizza Café?\" At which point I notice his belt buckle in the bottom of my eye. Its huge like most people that still wear belt buckles from Texas. He says, \"Yes young man. I did.\" Me: \"Alright, all I need is for you to sign the tip, total, and darkened black line on this reciept.\" At which point I glance down at his belt buckle again and he takes the receipt. He shifts his body quickly to the left in a pelvic thrust type motion moving his buckle behind the wall and signing the receipt on the trim of the door. I grab his pizza and we exchange the receipt and the pizza. He stares at me on my way back to the car. All was good... besides the fact that he wasn't wearing jeans for a belt to be worn with. Chad had his nuts flipped over the edge of his shorts and I had mistaked it for a buckle. I drove away and stopped a couple blocks down. I forgot to check my tip before walking away since I was a little uneasy from seeing a grown man's nutsack. The tip was $15.\n\nDid Chad just turn me into a prostitute? (Paying me to look at his nutsack)\n\nInb4&gt; I knew it was a nutsack the second time I glanced at his nuts. And it was definitly purposeful. How do you accidently let your nuts slip without showing a micro cenitmeter of shaft?",

You know the type, if you've been around the block a few times, because you start to notice that there are a few different 'types' of drivers. \n\nThe best advice Startup gave me was... buy a clipboard. He had a small one, he even put a few stickers on it. He said it was \"hip\" and that people really liked the effort. His was a little plastic blue thing, pastel and sturdy. I went next door to the office supply store and bought a cheap ol' clipboard the next day. \n\n[I've used this one for the past 2 years now.](http://imgur.com/a/NvscP) I had my artsy roommate illustrate the front, and a while later decided to sticker up the back myself. If you don't have one, I really recommend it for credit card receipts. People really do appreciate it, even if some still put it up against the wall or door or down on their knee. . .",

He pulls out a $100 dollar bill to pay for his food. I get our shift leader to make change and as he is handing the customer his change the customer makes some sort of motion to give him back the bill. I ended up doing it thinking that he was going to go for a lower denomination. I end up just walking away making sure everything in the oven was taken care of, letting the shift leader finish the transaction. \n\nApparently, at the end of the night we're short 98 dollars. He never saw me hand him back the bill, which was a huge oversight on my part, so he ends up with 96 something dollars in change and his 100 dollar bill as well. Kinda fucked.\n\nNo wonder he never picked up his Cinnamon Bread. So, I'm out 98 dollars...but I took the bread home.. So there's that I guess.\n\n\nJust be careful guys.",

As usual, once I reached the parking lot I looked around for an empty spot near the building I needed. Only one space left, so I pull in. Right before I shift into park, a car behind me starts honking. I decided to be nice, and pull out and park behind some other cars. I get out of my car, wave at her to apologize for taking the last spot.\nNo response from her. When I got to the main door, I held it open for her. She muttered a few harsh \"go\"s, and rushed me in before her.\n\nWith this complex you have to be buzzed in for entrance, so I got to the box first and pushed the button, letting the customer know I had arrived. I stood off to the side so that this lady could open the door for herself. She started digging through her keys, and before she found the right one, the door started buzzing. Being closest to the door, she opened it, stepped through, and pulled the door shut before I could enter.\n\nI don't know who shit in her cereal this morning, but what did I do to deserve that?",

        "text": "I often answer phones and help customers at the counter at my pizza chain franchise store. We are often busy so I try to take care of phone orders quickly, as my primary function is driving. \n\nA call comes in from a woman who has ordered before, carryout mostly, so as she gives me her name and phone number, I don't have to type them in. Computer already captured it, so I think this'll be a nice quick easy phone call. \n\nNope. She feels the need to tell me she's ordering on the phone because she just got out of the hospital from some kind of big medical issue and she can't see very well to order on the website. Normally she orders online only, she's buying dinner for her sister-in-law who's driving her home today, and so on. I don't see what this has to do with anything at the time, but it becomes important later. She then starts her order, asking the other people around her what they want, taking a nice long time to figure out what all she's getting and what kind of specials we have that fit her order. \n\nWe finally finish up and I get off the phone and take a delivery or two. Lucky me, she comes in to pick up her food while I am near the front counter. She seems awfully pleasant, I have her swipe her card and get her food off the hot rack, she's ready to leave after just one question. \n\n\"You guys can give me points for this order, right? I always order online so I can get them but you know I just can't see the website very easily right now because of my medical condition. I should be able to have the points since I bought the food here, you should add them to my account.\"\n\nI empathize and tell her I'm sorry about her problem and I totally understand, but our store just doesn't have any access to her rewards points account. I can't see her balance, add points, or redeem them. It's all managed at the corporate level and only accessible online.\n\nShe pouts a little and continues how it's not her fault she can't see very well to place her order that way and it's very unfair that she can't get any points for buying her pizza today. \n\nI agreed, apologized again and then gave her the phone number to the corporate customer service line and told her they would probably be able to help her out, they want to make everyone happy. I also let her know that she can email the parent company or use the online chat help on the website to get in contact with them after she feels better (the vision problems were temporary). She grumbled a bit more but left after a few minutes. \n\nSo anyways, the thing I couldn't tell the customer about our points program, but wanted to so badly: \n\nThe points system is to encourage customers to order online so they don't use up time us employees could be spending doing other things. We are expensive and they don't want customers to unnecessarily waste our time. \n\ntl;dr Customer wastes a total of ten minutes of my time ordering and complaining about not getting points, thus proving the need for the points system to be entirely online.",

        "text": "Earlier today I ordered some breadsticks, pop, and a brownie for my brother from Papa Johns. It came to $17 including the delivery fee, and I added a 3 dollar tip on my card, and tossed in a loose one dollar bill in cash when she came. It's a pretty solid tip, but it's nothing too crazy.\n\nAfter the transaction, I was on my way inside looking forward to my meal. The driver yelled from her car and asked me if I was selling the water jug.\n\nIt took me a moment to realize what she was referring to. For context, my family is tearing out a good chunk of our basement and rebuilding. As a side effect, we found a bunch of random items that we didn't need, but were too useful to toss. We put them at the end of the street on a table.\n\nEverything on that table was free. None of us were going to use any of it, so I told her she could have everything but the table if she could find a use for it.\n\nShe walked away with a [seven gallon water jug](https://www.rei.com/product/618168/reliance-aqua-tainer-7-gal?CAWELAID=120217890000769419&amp;CAGPSPN=pla&amp;CAAGID=34827278566&amp;CATCI=pla-301022880200&amp;cm_mmc=PLA_Google|404_57899|6181680015|NB_NCA|02d79ca4-962b-4a5c-8885-a67f4b72e6ad|pla-301022880200&amp;lsft=cm_mmc:PLA_Google_LIA|404_57899|6181680015|NB_NCA|02d79ca4-962b-4a5c-8885-a67f4b72e6ad|pla-301022880200&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQjwrsDIBRDX3JCunOrr_YYBEiQAifH1Fn05TL1ng43MRr5wtmNISX4IOt4GsT0PtQSjZXhmRHAaAgw38P8HAQ) that she said she would take on an upcomming camping trip. She also grabbed a cheap toy, I didn't notice which one she grabbed.\n\nFinally, she walked away with a decent gaming headset for her son. My brother upgraded from the headset and didn't' really use it. It also had a bit of an interference problem where loud noises played through the speakers would get picked up by the mic. She said her son was a wiz with electronics and could probably fix it.\n\nIn all, she delivered a $17 order and walked away with a $17 water jug, one random cheap kid's toy, and a headset that was probably $25-35 new. Oh, and the four dollars.\n\nHopefully she gets more use out if it than we did. No one even remembers where we got the water jug.",

As an East Coast Librul, I find it hard to believe there's a Texan who doesn't have a license: but joking aside the driver is now set up to be victimized twice: by the assholes who (allegedly) plotted to rob (and shoot!) him, and the legal system that may punish him for carrying without a license. Probably a third time if he loses his job, which is entirely possible given Domino's policy towards carrying weapons of any type (officially a no-no: they don't even want sharp knives in store).\n\nOf course, maybe he didn't have a *concealed* carry license - a distinction I (sadly) wouldn't expect a local news show to make 100% of the time. \n\nI never carried a gun when I was on the job. A knife, yes, but one that could plausibly be (and constantly was) used in the store for legitimate purposes. If you're going to carry a gun - which I personally never chose to do because I didn't feel it was worth it for a laundry list of reasons - *please* do it right.",

        "text": "I'll begin this with saying that I work at one of the big three chains in the south, and I've been working here for almost a year and a half. This happened tonight.\n\n\nSo, It's around 10 pm tonight, and I had just arrived at the store from a delivery. I noticed that a delivery was ready and it was at one of the super shady locations in our delivery area. I grabbed the order and was about to put it in the hot-bag when my GM told me to call them back before I leave, because it the people that placed that order sounded like children.\n\n\nSo I called the number that the order was placed under about 3 times, and I finally decided to just leave a message, telling them something along the lines of \"Hi, this is ****, please call us back asap so that we can confirm your order and deliver your food\".\n\n\nSo, I left the food on the hot rack, and about 15 minutes later, I take a quick delivery to a hotel. When I got back, I noticed that one of our other drivers was talking to our GM about the people that never called us back for confirmation. My boss tells me to follow the other driver to the location, If it looks bad, it probably IS bad (and to leave if this is the case, obviously), and to be careful and deliver the stuff. \n\n\nSo we do just that. When we arrived, our other driver parked on the side of the road, and I parked right behind him. I rolled down my driver's side window and stayed in the car. An important point to note is at this point, the family is waiting outside. So I stay in the car, and the driver attempts to deliver their food. \n\n\nThe driver tells them their total, and a hispanic woman (I'm guessing mid to late twenties) starts shouting and asking why It took so long to get here. The driver explains that the time that we tell the customer for delivery is just an estimation, and this just ticks them off further. I, still in the car, tell them that both my manager and I tried calling them multiple times, and even left a message, and never received a call back to confirm the order and address.\n\n\nThe lady is furious, calls me a liar, and says that she's going to call my \"Superior\", and then walks inside. During this time, a man (around mid thirties I'm guessing) is telling the other driver to give the order to them for free because of the trouble that WE put THEM through. The driver tells them that's not going to happen, and then the woman walks back outside.\n\n\nThe woman, at this point, walks back up to the driver then starts asking us \"Why did he follow you?!?!\" (\"he\" being myself), and both the driver and myself tell her something along the lines of \"It's what our manager instructed us to do\". After this, the woman get's up in the driver's face, shouting at him, telling him that the food should be free, it's all our faults, yadda yadda. \n\n\nAt this point, I have my hand on the door handle, ready to jump out in case fists are thrown or something else bad happens. I notice that the driver's left hand is making a super-tight fist, and this driver is trying his absolute best to maintain his composure. After about a minute of this going on, the driver has had enough of it, and tells them to have a good night, and puts the food in his car, and we drive down the street to call our boss to ask what to do.\n\n\nIn short, our boss just tells us to come back to the store, and that the customer is blacklisted. Fairly eventful delivery, I'd say. Luckily It didn't resort to any type of physical violence. If you guys made it this far, thanks for taking the time to read my story!! ",

        "text": "Hello again /r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy, I'm back with another story. I will say before I begin that I am, unfortunately, no longer a delivery driver. About 6 months ago I finally got an opportunity to begin my career and leave Tennessee. \n\nI wanted to actually post this story the day it happened, but I was advised by management that I should refrain from speaking to the media about the incident while employed by Domino's. But I no longer work for them, and no longer live in the area. That all being said, onto the story where a pizza I delivered lead to an arrest.\n\nIt was a random day in May, and I was scheduled to be the opening driver. As I mentioned previously, I worked in a tourist town in the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee. Most of my deliveries were to hotels or vacation cabins. \n\nIt was an average day, not a ton of deliveries which was great because I was the only driver until about 2. So, we get a delivery of pizza and wings to a hotel that was pretty close to the edge of our delivery zone. I was a bit annoyed, but whatever, maybe they'll tip. \n\nI get to the hotel and knock on the door to their room. No answer. I call their phone. No answer. I go to the front desk and they call the room, they answer and say that they're in their room and to come back. I leave them with my phone number so they know to answer their phone if they don't answer again. I get back to the room and knock on the door, a man says that he's in the bathroom and he'll be out in a minute. Whatever, I'll wait. \n\nAfter about five minutes of waiting I call him again and tell him that if he isn't at the door in the next two minutes I'm going to leave. He finally answers the door, obviously annoyed that I apparently wouldn't just leave the pizza at the door without him signing for it. He did not tip, which pissed me off after all I had to deal with to get the guy his damn pizza and wings. I head back to the store.\n\nThere was another delivery waiting for me when I got back, so I took that and let the previous delivery fall to the back of my mind. The next delivery was exemplary. They were nice, did not send me on a goose chase around the hotel to deliver, and they tipped me well. \n\nI get back to the store and am questioned by my manager about the delivery to the Fairfield. I tell her that they were rude and were weird about answering the door, and she told me that a cop was just at the store. Apparently their order tipped off police to where they were. The man and his wife that I delivered to were on the run from police. \n\nThis isn't the first time a pizza delivery tipped off law enforcement. But this one is different because the man and his wife were wanted in New York for grand larceny, criminal tax fraud, scheme to defraud, and violation of labor law. I guess the wife ran a restaurant and they made off with almost a million dollars from investors, owing about $40,000 in wages to her employees. \n\nThat's all well and crazy, but IT GETS BETTER! The wife was apparently a culinary darling in the raw/vegan scene. She was the owner of a really famous restaurant in New York that celebrities frequented. I am sure you are probably aware, but pizza and wings are not raw, nor are they vegan. \n\nSo yeah, I have many wild stories about the year I spent delivering pizza. But I think this one may have been the craziest one I've got. ",

        "text": "It started when I delivered to a mexican restaurant and they shorted me 20 bucks. I should have recounted it while I was there, I know this. But the guy counted the money out right in front of me and I was already in a mood because the instructions said to go through the front door, holding 9 pizzas, only to get stopped and turned around because the gm or whoever didn't want the customers to \"know that they were eating pizza there\" and had to drive around back. Anyway, he had all the money in hand but ended up holding some back after handing me the bulk of it. The Gm was unable to get a hold of them after.\n\nThen, on my next delivery, I almost get into a wreck. I'm in the middle lane to turn and a guy wants to cross the highway. I see him inching forward so I keep an eye on him and when there's an opening he guns it and has to slam on his brakes because hey, I'm going. Then he decides screw it and continues anyway. I won't lie, I lost my cool a bit and honked my horn. Turned and immediately parked because I'm at the customers house. Said customer is sitting on his porch and has seen the entire thing. He tips me 10 bucks.\n\nI deliver to a house where the owner wasn't expecting a pizza, but a kid that was there, I guess his mom ordered for him or something. As I'm leaving a guy jumps out from behind the car screaming and scaring the ever loving shit out of me before running off. \n\nDeliveries are nonstop all night. 10 p.m. (we close on 11 on fridays), 6 orders pop up. Thankfully the other driver is still on (was supposed to get off at 9) and takes a few, but refuses to take one that goes to the trailer park that apparently the gm thought he banned from ordering because it's pretty far out there and crazy sketchy. So instead of the guy who's used to being in sketchy places (ex-social worker), they send the young girl. I get there and have to figure out which trailer it is because most have two different numbers (one might say 30, then a 9 underneath). That is, if they're not spray painted onto the side. When I get to the right one, there's a guy standing right off the side of the road, staring me down. I almost didn't get out of my car until I noticed the customer peeking out of their window. Figured if the guy tried anything they would see. When I got out the guy started walking behind my car. He was gone when I got back.\n\nThe absolute worst delivery though, was the very last one. Dorm student ordered about 10:50, but I have one right before it on the other side of town, so it's about 11:15 by the time I get there. Okay, whatever. I call because I can't get into the dorms, no answer but I see some walking my way. Its her so we do the thing. The order is 13 bucks for wings and fries, paid by card. I mention that I left her a voicemail since she didn't answer. She claims she didn't get a call.\n\nI get back to the store and am routing back in when my phone starts ringing. At first thought it was my BF but it turns out to be her. At this point I hesitate to answer, but if anything at least I can apologize for bothering someone with a wrong phone number.\n\nIt's the dorm student. I have to ask her to repeat herself because she's mumbling and not enunciating. Most I get is that there's something wrong with the wings and \"bbq\" whatever that means. So I ask the gm, who asks me if I'm willing to go back out there. I say sure, it's not a horribly long drive and honestly I don't want to get roped in on the dishes. The guy who made the wings initially swears up and down that he made them right the first time. Gm also offers to put $15 credit on her account instead, but she wants the wings now. I get back out there, call the number, she answers and agrees to come out and meet me. She comes carrying the previous box of wings. Gets to the door and tosses them in the trash... Okay. I give her the new wings and circle the parking lot to leave but she flags me down. Apparently the wings are wrong again. She starts with \"I don't know if you *misunderstood* me, but\" and goes on about how it's wrong. I tell her, they're what we were told to make. I think the confusion comes from that she told them 'spicy bbq' but what we get is 'mach 4.' I asked if she called or ordered online and she said she did it over the phone and told the guy 'clearly' that she wanted spicy bbq. Okay, whatever you say. So I call the GM, who says that he can give her the credit but he's not sending me back out again (it's 11:40 by this point). She gets huffy, throws the box back at me and walks away (this is after she asks what credit is).\n\nIt was just a terrible night. At least, if anything the GM put a discount on the restaurant mishap so I didn't have to pay the 20 out of my own pocket, and also informed me that they had just created a new rule that when it came to delivering to the dorm students, we just have to show up and if they don't come out after a few minutes, then just come back to the store, and not to worry about calling them anymore.

I approached, thinking it was whoever had ordered the pizza, but it was a young guy with his phone out and giant wads of cash in his hand and lap.\n\nRecording the encounter on his phone, he said something to the effect of \"if I give you five thousand dollars, would you quit your job right now?\", holding out what looked like it could actually be five thousand dollars.\n\nI was kind of confused, and in a rush because it was busy, so I sort of brushed it off. He then upped the ante to ten grand, and I asked incredulously \"what? Just call my boss right now and tell her I quit?\"\n\n\"Nah, just walk away.\"\n\nI should have asked much, much more about the logistics of the whole thing, but I brushed it off again, and then he offered fifteen.\n\nAs I awkwardly made it clear yet again that I was going to try to find the person who had ordered pizza, he said \"wow, you must really love your job, huh?\"\n\nI mean, I DO, but I'm still not sure I shouldn't have taken him up on it. I was in a bad part of town, but in broad daylight, and a little wary of the whole affair.\n\nThen the barely-able-to-walk old guy who'd ordered the pies gave me a twenty dollar tip to take a bag of trash out to the dumpster.

Another group asked for me specifically, then wanted to take pictures with me, told me I was the greatest pizza guy ever, how they heard fascinating stories about me (and I have no idea who they are) and again tipped very well.\n\nSo while it ended up being an average night so far (but if you looked at my runs it should have been crappy) the feels were pretty high, so all in all I was a happy delivery guy.\n\nThen I get a delivery to a decent apartment complex.  I pull up to the building and there are two guys out on the stairs.  One leaves and gets in his car, the other asks me which apartment the delivery is for.  I ask him if he placed the order.  He again asks which apartment it for.  I again ask him if he placed the order.  I don't deliver and tell, so IMHO if he didn't place the order, it's really none of his business who ordered, plus being he's outside of a six unit apartment he's getting ready to find out which door I'm going to knock on (which clearly by now won't be his.)\n\nSo I knock on said door, and customer opens it.  Jackass on the stairs immediately says, \"Hi customer, don't tip this guy, he was rude.\"  Then customer says, \"I wasn't going to anyway, all I have is a $20.\"  (The order was $19.75.)  Man, what a couple of assholes.  Now I've gone from being in a jovial mood to being pissed.  Not really because of the stiff, but because the the jackass's comments.",

Now, I will admit to being guilty or ordering during very bad weather. It was raining pretty bad to the point that they closed some roads due to flooding. I'm a driver. I've driven in that kind of weather before. It's not fun. I feel bad in that it didn't cross my mind, the weather. I was off that day and hadn't gone outside since the rain had started earlier that day. \n\nAnyway. The guy shows up. Once again boyfriend goes to answer and I slowly follow out behind this time. Guy is inside the house. Apparently when they opened the door he just walked in. The porch is raised and sheltered so it wasn't like he was trying to get out of the weather. He was asking directions on how to get to such and such place and complaining about how he didn't expect to be able to drive home in it, and left. Bf said it was the same guy from before. It still kinda irks me that he just barged his way on in though. ",

        "text": "So browsing through this sub-reddit has brought back a few memories from my time as a delivery driver so I figure I'll just dump them here in case anyone finds them amusing. \n\nLike the housebound lady hooked up on an oxygen tank who lived outside of our no minimum order delivery area. Never had any cash on her. We don't take cards so she'd give us her debit card and PIN number and tell us if we wanted to get paid we'd have to go to the next ATM and withdraw the cash for her. Because I'm nice and don't mind helping out the elderly, I didn't empty her bank account when I had the chance. Anytime she ordered she always rang back and asked us to bring her a pack or 2 of smokes. We normally don't do this but made an exception for her so long as she ordered above the minimum for her area, after each delivery she'd get more and more hostile and eventually call us trying to get us to deliver cigarettes without ordering any food. After the 3rd or 4th attempt she expected us to deliver a $1.50 soda to her (along with the smokes) and went apeshit when we explained that we delivered food not cigarettes, that maybe she'd have more luck calling a store closer than a 20 minute drive. This happened two or 3 times after that and I never thought much of it. One day she blew up at the owner of the store who also lost it and yelled down the phone that he'd taken a picture of her card, still remembered her PIN number and would begin charging her for wasting his time if she called again. She never did. \n\nI also got called out regularly to this older (mid-late 40s) divorced English lady who would only order if I was working. She wasn't ugly but I still reckon I'd need a few beers before I'd find her attractive enough to do the deed. She'd answer the door wearing very little/see through lingerie/nothing but an open robe and always stink of booze and cigarettes. She'd always hit on me and invite me up for a drink. On one occasion she even asked me up for \"a drink and\" whilst miming a blowjob.  Last straw was when she stuck her tip straight into my front pocket and with the same hand made a move for my \"tip\". Explained to her that I knew what she was doing and it wasn't gonna happen. Her reply was something along the lines of \"You must be gay or something to repeatedly turn away an open invitation for sex!\" Before she slammed the door. Never called back, assume she found another pizza place and the guy didn't mind/already had STDs. \n\nThere were also the 2 brothers who'd get stoned in their basement  and often order from 2 different stores, meaning there sometimes was another delivery guy there when I arrive. One time I asked why they'd order from 2 stores, since I knew for a fact we were the better (and closer) store. They regularly order from one store in the beginning of their session, forget halfway how bad the food is and end up ordering from us at the end of their session. The first company has an average delivery time of 1.5-2 hours whilst we had 20-30 mins. Yep, delivery in my country sucked ass. \n\nBonus: I was once hit by a regular (we had delivery motorbikes) who was driving dangerously, trying to race me to his place because he was worried we'd abandon the order if he wasn't home - we'd done this 3 times before after waiting 20+ minutes for him to show up. By some miracle the food was intact - the cheese from the cheese pizza he ordered had slid to one side but the burgers and fries were packed so tightly into their boxes they weren't affected. He stopped to make sure I was OK, offered to take the food the rest of the way, paid and left me with $50 to cover any repair costs (bike was a little scratched up but nothing major). Boss didn't mind the scratches and let me keep the $50. I'm still not certain he didn't hit me intentionally to delay me. ",

        "text": "So today is Dollar Sub day at Jimmy John's. While the promotion hasn't started yet, we've been absolutely slammed all day. Well I'm driving this morning shift and we've had some sluggish delivery times. I took a delivery to an insurance agency that was about 35 minutes when I took it out. As I rushed in the door I was immediately accosted by the customer, \"AND WHY DID THIS TAKE SO LONG, HUH?\" I simply explained to her that it was dollar sub day and we were pretty busy, but I left the store with her order as soon as it was up. She demanded I come back in so she can take the auto-tip off the order, so I explain to her that she can call the store to do that. I also said, \"and I apologize for the MILD inconvenience!\" as I was out the door.\n\nSo she called the store and complained of course, removed the tip, manager thought it was funny.\n\nBut I didn't stop there, I left her a one-star review on Google and Facebook, it simply stated: \"I had an experience with [redacted] today in which she acted like a petulant child. I cannot recommend this service from someone who acts with such immaturity.\" Now, before you start to tear me apart, yes I see the irony, yes this was stupid and childish, but goddamn I think stuff like this is hilarious.\n\nSo of course her husband calls the owner of the store, who calls me and tears me down for \"yelling at the customer and making him look bad\". Of course after I explain her aggressiveness he was cool with it, but still asked me to take down the reviews.\n\nI'm leaving in a couple weeks, those reviews will be back soon, ha.",

        "text": "I had a family order pizza once, around a $50 order. Real lame area to deliver too. No one wanted to do it, so it fell to me. Notorious area for not tipping and sludging through mud to deliver it. Numbers aren't posted or anything either usually.\n\nHere I am, trying to find this ladies house. Had to knock on a door and ask if they knew the name since the customer wasn't answering their phone. Finally found the place and knocked on the door. First thing I get is a guy looking confused about me standing there with pizza.\n\nHe then kindly informed me that they just had pizza delivered (roughly 10 minutes before I arrived) from another local business in our town and he wasn't aware of any order with us.\n\nHe calls in to his wife, \"Honey, did you order more pizza?\"\n\nHis wife comes to the door, pays for the pizza in cash, 3 $20's, and I hand her the change back. She puts on this sad face and goes, \"I'm sorry, I just don't have money for a tip\". I could see the table from the door, and the 3 larges from the other store. I wonder where all her money went...\n\nI was pleasant and everything though, but screaming internally. If you don't want to tip, don't even bring it up or just say you don't want to tip. Coming up with excuses or lying is infuriating. Now, if she wasn't lying and money was THAT tight. Why did you just order $100+ of pizza... Be sensible or something. Very likely that they may have not tipped the other driver too.\n\nEdit: I'm horrible with putting thoughts and intents to words. Ultimately, if she hadn't said anything or just said she didn't want to tip, I would have been fine. It was that she went out of her way to state she didn't have money for tips after she just spent $100+ on pizza. It came across and snarky and her trying to make herself out to be a better person. It's not like I pestered her about a tip. As I was giving her change back is when she said it. Part of the natural flow of the conversation, so she already knew she wasn't planning on tipping. I always confirmed change totals verbally and got their change ready, typically it was during that time someone would say \"I only need X back\" or \"Keep the change\".\n\nOn the note of the boss/owner pocketing delivery charge and whatnot with mileage. It wasn't worth it to contend with the boss and all that stuff on it. How it worked was different zones had different $ for delivery ($1 - $4) and we were supposed to get that in recompense for mileage, well the boss started pocketing any amount over $1 and said \"Since you are taking multiple orders it makes up for it and I need to recoup the cost of you being out of the store\". Drivers were also in-house and we had a total of 5 employees, 3 of which did driving too. He'd also take a portion of the in-house tips since \"[He] worked too.\" I was just happy we got him to stop altering our time cards.\n\n",
