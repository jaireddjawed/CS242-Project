Bought a house, made good money, but hated the weather and life style. Wanted mountains, out doors, maybe snowy winters, etc. We got married and had our first kid in Houston, didn’t want to raise our family in a giant city like Houston so moved to north Idaho almost 2 years ago. Had another kid. The market went insane here, lots of people from California moving here and driving up the market, almost 3X. And I just don’t know if it was a mistake but it’s just crazy and now I’m wondering if it’s fate to not stay here. I don’t want to go back to Houston, but I’m open to other cities with hopefully less hot humidity all the time and a good place to raise a family with reasonable cost of living. \n\nTo be fair, I haven’t been here for 2 years yet, and the market is shifting and coming down now. It went from not being able to find a single rental that wasn’t gone within an hour to mass availability and prices decreasing. I don’t want to leave and always wonder “what if”",

        "text": "I've been thinking a lot lately about how being frugal often involves trading time for money. Like finding coupons and driving to multiple grocery stores to lower your grocery bill. What are other examples of this? \n\nDoes it matter to you how much you save? Like if you're into couponing and you did the math and found out that you were saving $5 for every hour of work you did, how would you feel about that? If you only had one extra hour per week and you could either spend it working and making extra money or doing something frugal, like canning free tomatoes, which would you rather do?",

Yes, I do have hyperopia and astigmatism in both eyes since I was born, I could see fine until everything finally started to get blurry when I already entered into my 30s.  The eye doctor's office quoted around $250 for both frame (cheapest would be like $60) and lenses and it comes with no warranty or no protection plan offered or nothing.  They told me ordering inexpensive ones online was another option.\n\nI window-shopped so many online eyeglass retailers and matched my new prescription, it shows bifocal lenses cost more than single lenses.  Finally, with zenni and eyebuydirect, I was surprised that bifocal lenses only cost around $30 (without add-ons) plus good quality frame anywhere between $20 and $90.  Eyebuydirect does offer buy-one-and-get-free-one.  Yet I'm really little skeptical about the quality.\n\nWhat's your opinion or made mistakes with buying glasses online?",

Quoting a few passages from [the paywalled article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/02/10/valentine-chocolate-box-slack-filling/).\n\n&gt; \"The box is about is about 9.3 inches wide and 10 inches tall, a good size. But inside the Whitman’s box are 11 candies. Inside the Russell Stover? Nine candies.\"\n\nThe report goes on to define slackfill as “when a manufacturer deliberately over-packages a product using a package substantially larger than the amount of content inside.”\n\nThe problem is industry-wide.\n\n&gt; \"Under federal law, most packages are not allowed to have unnecessary or nonfunctional empty space. To test for slack-fill, regulators measure the capacity of the package and compare it to the volume of product it actually contains. Then they determine whether the empty space is necessary for protecting the product — like the air cushion at the top of a half-full bag of potato chips, for instance — or serving other functions.\n\n&gt; \"The government frowns upon this and occasionally does crack down: In 2019, candy makers Ghirardelli and Russell Stover (both owned by Swiss chocolate giant Lindt &amp; Sprüngli) were fined a total of $750,000 after California prosecutors said the companies were selling certain products in 'oversized containers' that were 'predominantly empty' and misleading consumers.\"\n\nSo if you're buying boxed chocolates this holiday, be sure to check the weight before purchase.\n\n[In post 2 will share a DIY suggestion to make your own Valentine's Day sweets].",

My food I can mix with theirs, my items can be stored in the basement, etc. But idk what to do with all of my condiments! I have a variety of hot sauces, vinegars, aoilis, etc. They already have a fridge full of condiments. \n\nCan I freeze all of my condiments in their deep freezer, and thaw them in 6 months when I move back into my own place? Would that change them? \n\nI don't want to have to spend $200 on getting them all again :/",

Go to carmax and ask for a 24 hour test drive on a truck, look at their inventory before you go. Tell them the exact one you want to test drive and act convinced that's the one you want to test out. If they ask why you want to test drive say \"Been wanting to get a truck\"... They don't make commission so they won't care too much about selling you anything. You need a valid driver's license and current insurance on your personal car. I recently moved using one of their ford raptors and one of their jeep gladiators. When I got the jeep I was told  \"don't worry about putting gas in it\" so that part of the move was totally free. On my birthday I got a tesla to cruise around for the day. When I returned vehicles I just said I want to look at more of their inventory and do some research but no one honestly cared. This service is faster in and out the door honestly than any other rental service I've ever used. Word of caution there is a rule of only 2 cars a month before they look at you funny.",
