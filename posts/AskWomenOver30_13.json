But ive started dating this new guy and during our first make out he had really bad stubble. I ended up w “beard burn” around my lips that ended up causing a blister and really bad redness and irritation on and around my lips. I immediately asked him if he had anything I should worry about (cold sores, etc) and he said no. He shaved smoothly the second time around and still, I am here with my lips irritated and a small blister where my last one is. Do you think it could be because I shave my upper lip? I shave it with those flawless razors. Yes we have intense makeout sessions but ive just never experienced this before!! Tips/tricks? I always use chapstick and moisturize the area too.",

We were planing to go on trip to Niagara falls this summer. she asks me what kind of wife do i want and is that okay with me if we want to marry one day she has a girl from previous marriage which i was totally fine. We met few times and i was falling for her day by day. During the pandemic i helped her financially and never asked money back cuz i thought we are in this together. but she just stopped replying to me for a month i texted her millions times yet she still posting stuff on instagram. i came to illinois (where she studies at) but she just ignored me like im   a ghost. then she texted to me after i got into my plane says: i dont want to see you again i’m devastated and cant sleep more than 4 hours i just dont understand what happened.",

I have ADHD/anxiety for which I’ve been under treatment for the last year &amp; I’ve noticed remarkable improvements in myself.\n\nMy husband is a highly productive individual. If he sees a task that needs to be done, he does it ASAP without wasting time. Now this is obviously a great quality to have but he does this even outside of work/ his own tasks. Eg, if we mutually decide to do the dishes tomorrow, he’ll still do them tonight while I’m having a bath or something, because he didn’t want to put it off.\n\nNow let me clarify that I’m never lazy about chores. Whenever I’ve said I’ll do something, I’ve always done it. It’s just that I don’t see the need to organize our house THE DAY we move in, or to clean the living room 4 times a week when we barely ever have people over. \n\nWe had planned to move to a new house last month but unfortunately I had to travel \nfor work that week. I did as much packing as I could before leaving &amp; he supervised the movers while I was away. We mutually decided to organize the house once I was back. I got back &amp; the house was fully done.\n\nThis makes me feel so incompetent and insufficient especially given my ADHD/ anxiety. I feel horrible when I come home to do chores &amp; then find out that they’ve been done.\n\nHe says he’s happy to do it and prefers to get things done but I’m under no pressure to do them ASAP. He also says that not everything needs to be 50:50 all the time and IF I feel like compensating, I can do it in other ways (idk how since he does everything). He also says I should be happy about having someone who doesn’t mind doing things at home (which I truly am happy about but I wish I didn’t feel like such a slow, unproductive failure). \n\nTips on what I can do to compensate?",

When I mention it to co-workers and friends- they seem perplexed. They think it’s strange for my wife to become a SAHM now that our kids are in school. \n\nI’m a registered nurse and work three days a week. I usually would stay with our kids during the week before they started school. If I work during the week- my sister in law or mother in law would watch them for us. I don’t have a set schedule and only know the days I work about 3-4 weeks in advance. My wife currently works Mon-Fri 8am-530pm. I’ve recently became a nurse practitioner and I’m in the process of starting a new job. My new work schedule will be Mon-Fri 8am-430pm. \n\nWe feel like it makes sense for her to stay home. Between sick days, in service days, random school closings, holidays, school breaks- it gets tough to manage with both of us working full time. The older they get- the busier they get. There’s soccer practice, Dance, taekwondo, tennis practice, swim classes etc. It’s a lot to juggle. It gets really stressful at times.\n\nWe are not taking a hit in income with her staying home. My new pay will make up the difference plus. \n\nSecond Question: What are some common issues that come up with my wife becoming a SAHM. We’ve never had separate finances and are on the same page with how we handle money. We’ll continue to contribute to her Roth IRA. I am a little concerned about how it will affect her social security in retirement. We always have discussed big purchases. We have a budget that we discuss regularly. We also each get an equal amount of “fun money” that we can spend however wish.\n\nI think the household labor/chores are equal and I don’t plan on stopping doing my share. I don’t want her to feel like the family maid. \n\nWhen I’m able- I plan to transport our children to activities too. \n\nWhat am I not thinking about?\nFrom my research, there is an aspect of isolation and it concerns me.",

I had a huge fear of abandonment and codependency oozing from my pores. Through therapy and lots of self-reflection, I’ve come a long way in healing this. I have MUCH better boundaries now. \n\nHowever, I didn’t end the toxic friendships. What I eventually started to do was stick up for my boundaries and call out toxic behavior.  Some of the behaviors were small and some were downright emotionally abusive. \n\nWhat I found is that these toxic friends started to cut me out of their lives when I began to stand up for myself. It feels great to be free of them. I’ve read about why they are the ones cutting me and it’s very normal, but it still feels… weird? \n\nFor example, I was talking to a friend of three years who dropped me after they got into a new relationship. I told them that it hurt and that for the friendship to continue, our interactions needed to go both ways. Previous to this, the dynamic was very unbalanced, with me being there for them emotionally much, much more than them for me during very serious events when they were absolutely alone. Their response was, “You’re lucky I even talked to you at all. Never contact me again.”  Ok then. \n\nPart of me wishes I had been the one to cut them out of my life, that I had taken control over my life in removing these toxic relationships. I guess in the long run it doesn’t really matter? \n\nHave any of you had this happen? You’ve started to stand up for yourself and people either suddenly treat you like you’re the bad guy or cut you out of their life? Or did you cut the toxic person out first?",

        "text": "Hey y’all, looking for some opinions and thoughts on my situation here, lady to lady.\n\nOver the past 5 weeks, I’ve had a real go of it. Late January, my grandfather became ill and I took off work and traveled to help my father with my grandfather’s final weeks. I spent a lot of bandwidth helping my father with things and emotional/mental support. All the while I’m trying to stay on top of things at work. I have a very important role and I’m the only person in my company who has the role. The other person is on a 3 month sabbatical.\n\nAfter my grandfather passed about a week and a half ago, my husband had a birthday and I took time and care to celebrate, but unfortunately in going out, and doing what finally felt like having some fun and time to ourselves/myself, I got COVID. So I’m missing more at work, and I’ve been out of the office for 3 days this week already, not to mention having to deep clean the whole house after this.\n\nWhat do other folks do about work when they get a double-whammy? How do you handle things with your job and even with yourself, mentally? I don’t think I’ve ever had time to stop and really consider my own feelings after my grandfathers death.\n\nAny other job, I feel like I’d be fired easily, despite my desperation and the reality of what I’m going through. I think that adds a layer to my anxiety - the cruelty of the working world and how isolating ‘life happening’ can feel.\n\nAnyway, thanks in advance, love and support to our little community here!",

A little while after the video call I texted and let him know it was really nice talking to him and looking forward to our next video call. He responded.\n\nThe following morning I sent him a funny meme about enjoying his day off. He was active all day on other platforms but did not respond. \n\nI felt soo stupid and whole day was anxious. Today he sends me a funny article and says \"hope ure having a good day\".\n\nI haven't responded and don't want to appear too eager.\n\nIs this normal for him to go by the entire day w/o interacting?

Not important things, but for example- there is a coffee shop we go to that is painted my favorite color. The first time we went there, I said something like “oh this is my favorite color” and then the next time I apparently said it again. She said, “I know, you told me last time, are you going to say that every time we come here?”\n\n\nOr if I say something like “which of these plants do you think will look best in my living room?” She will say something like “I don’t know anything about that, why are you asking me?” \n\nI will note that she never says these things with bad humor or maliciousness, they just come off as rude. \n\nWhat’s up with this? What’s the best approach for talking to her about this? She is truly a wonderful friend otherwise but this is off putting to the point where I am nervous when I introduce her to new people.",

He was noticeably more stuffy than usual the last few days and he said he felt pretty shitty yesterday morning.\n\nAnyway, today he found a swollen lymph node in his lower neck and he's convinced that he has cancer now.

You'd think he's already gotten an official diagnosis.\n\nI've tried talking to him about it rationally, pointing out that a swollen lymph node most often means you're fighting off an infection. Considering we were all just sick, that seems to almost definitely be the case here. He also made an appt with his doctor for tomorrow and I told him that we won't know what it is for sure until he sees the doctor and there's no sense stressing himself out over what's likely nothing until then.\n\nHe's done this to himself many times before but this time is a little worse than usual. He just won't stop driving himself crazy over it.\n\nI'm trying to be supportive and everything but it's hard when I know he's doing this to himself and it's driving me nuts watching him do it.\n\nAny words of wisdom that can help me get my husband to snap out of it or help myself cope with watching him stress himself out?",

I am currently in a relationship with someone who is committed, loving, and loyal. I am also in a program at a University pursuing something I'm honestly not sure if I'll enjoy. If I stick with the program, it will take me at least 6 years to finish my entire education, so I'm not close to being finished at all. There's a chance I might be able to start traveling for a living as a Flight Attendant. My partner isn't too fond of the idea, but I know I'll regret it again if I don't pursue it. I was a FA before for a short bit, but left because I wasn't able to handle a fresh relationship and travel. I was in my early 20's and it was before I had done solo traveling and fell in love with travel even more. I think I still have things to work on, but I know I will regret it if I don't see more of the world. I'm considering adopting when I'm in my forties and definitely want to travel before I settle down, so I see my present situation as a chance to do that. I would still travel when I start a family, but not as much as I would have the opportunity to do now. It's risky in that I would leave my program and I'm not sure if my relationship will be able to handle it. Would appreciate some advice!",

Despite what I feel have been a lifetime of best efforts, I no longer believe I will find love or even true friendship. The desire to be loved and accepted has had such a chokehold on my life that I don’t know who I am anymore. I know I have some optimistic publishing goals that may also never be realized. I know what I like and don’t like. But I’ve not had a strong desire toward anything other than finding love, getting married, and becoming a mom since I was 12. That’s not going to happen. The deep, trusting, bond of friendship isn’t going to happen either. The family I wanted to build to replace the one I didn't have is only a fantasy. I am always going to have casual relationships with people who waft in and out of my life, and I feel I’m only causing myself undo suffering by striving for connections that have been proven to be out of my reach. I don’t know why. There seems to be something absent in me that repels people from me. And no, it's not neurodivergence. Whatever it is, it doesn’t really matter as I’ve exhausted myself trying to figure it out. I'm not looking for anyone else too either. I’m not looking for a pity party. I’m only looking for insight on where I can go from here. Without this optimism, hope, whatever you can call it, driving me, I feel adrift. I feel like this hope has been a distraction from the emptiness of my life… but I also don’t know what else there is to fill your life with.",

I'm used to it sometimes, but it's getting more and more frequent and I spend time with him less and less. Last week he told me about a vacation his friend invited him to, it was to a city my BF has been dying to take me to forever and ever, but he decided to word it like \"so and so invited me to go to that place if you want to tag along, but if not I would still like to go\" and that made me feel like an afterthought. When I get home after work he is always on his videogames. He doesn't get up and give me a kiss till maybe an hour after I get home. He plays till 10pm and then we spend maybe 1 hour or 2 watching TV and then go to bed. I complained when he was making plans with friends on our only day off together that its our only day of quality time together, which he argued that our weekdays after work count as quality time \"no matter how much or little, every minute counts\".\n\n\nI guess I am starting to rant and lose sight of my initial post here.

I had moved out of the town where I met these friends over a year ago, and I admit that they were mainly drinking friends that I had met through work. I had also been slowly distancing myself from this group ever since a few of them lacked interest in attending my 30th birthday party. \n\nHowever, what bothers me the most is that they had the audacity to post a photo of themselves at the wedding in the group chat that I’m a part of…knowing that I would see it despite me clearly not being invited to it…\n\nAm I being sensitive for thinking this was a bit thoughtless and tactless? I just don’t understand why they couldn’t send it in a separate group chat for the people who were actually invited to the wedding. I know they remembered I was still in the chat too because I was specifically called out shortly after about when I may be in town next for another group happy hour. \n\nI’m annoyed that I’m so bothered by this. How do you cope with the feeling of being singled out and rejected? I’m trying to remind myself that anyone capable of this behavior is not someone I would want to be friends with anyway, but it’s still hard not to take the rejection personally.",

The last time we went on a hike was this Sunday and we were supposed to go to Big Bear on monday. She wanted me to wake up that basically 6:30 so that I can pick her up and we could go on time to go downhill ski. But the day before, we had completed a 12 mile hike that was mostly uphill and I was really tired so I told her I had a flat tire and I basically just went back to bed and slept. As a matter of fact, when we were driving back from that 12 mile hike, I almost fell asleep while driving on the freeway.\n\nNow she's really pissed at me because of the last minute cancellation on Monday. She's saying that she doesn't want to plan anything with me anymore. I feel like it's unfair because I've taken her to Mammoth and I've also driven her to so many places where we could both hike and have a good time. I just feel like she's being way too demanding and it's really unfair because I work hard at keeping my house together and cleaning and taking care of my mom and all of this other stuff. She doesn't really work very much and doesn't take care of anybody so I just feel like she doesn't really understand what it's like. I want this friendship to work out but she's being really rigid in my eyes. I don't know what to do, so I'm just venting here.",

        "text": "I (34F) started dating a little later in life (late 20s) and after meeting and dating men of different demographics, I realized I get along pretty well with older men as romantic partners. With men around 45-55 (usually early 50s) I feel young, pretty, attractive, fun, easygoing, exciting, interesting, feminine. All the ways you want to feel with a male partner. Their maturity and stability makes me feel safe and protected, and I genuinely enjoy their company. My presence seems to energize them and pull them out of their comfort zones in a way they appreciate. \n\nBecause of some experiences in my life that happened to me earlier than most, it's really hard for me to connect with men my age in a romantic way. They seem very young and idealistic in a sweet way, but not in a way that makes me feel as safe as I feel with the older guys who've been through more of life and are just more sure about what they want from their lives and their partner. With younger guys (30-40) I feel really old and unattractive, like I don't have much to offer them to pick me over much younger women who'd also be age appropriate for them. Even when they're attracted to me, I feel like I'm just slowing them down or I'm not what they really really want and I pull away. \n\nAs I'm looking to find a long-term partner and start a family, I want to at least try to be a suitable option to men in my own age group to have a chance at a fresh start with my own family instead of being an older man's 2nd or 3rd wife, a step mom to adult children close to my age, and/or having a baby with a man with more resources than time &amp; energy to raise a child. But it seems like for men my age looking to start families, younger women are just a better, safer bet. \n\n**Any tips for this specific situation, or tips for how to feel more attractive to men outside of your \"type?\"** \n\nThanks for reading!",

        "text": "I have spent the past 24 hours considering pulling back from or fully ending a friendship that has meant a lot to me, and I am wondering if I am being caught in my own unrealistic expectations rather than attending to my boundaries in a healthy way. As I've gotten older, most of my friendships have shifted into couple friendships, which is great on most levels. I love that my partner &amp; I share interests &amp; a friend group, we travel together, play music together, friends have bought homes in our neighborhood - my younger self would see this as fully living the dream. Most of my closer 1:1 friends (particularly those I met before meeting my partner) have moved away, and while we do talk occasionally and see each other once or twice a year, I had been missing that close, regular communication with a friend.\n\nLast year an old friend who lives in another state starting putting a lot of effort into connecting with me, and the friendship really blossomed. It was fun to have daily, extended texts with someone that could span silly topics to really deep ones. I felt seen &amp; heard. I am able to be direct in my communication in ways that feel good &amp; healthy for me. But my friend is very inconsistent, in no small part due to severe ADHD. I have other friends where the contact is random and sporadic, but I am fine with it because we always finish the conversation, even if it's a month before we talk again. With this friend, I can share deep/heavy/important things and they will either respond in a very meaningful way, or they will say they will respond later (&amp; I do believe this is because they think the topic is important, but also because they are perhaps overwhelmed) but never do. For me, when they send similar messages, I try to respond relatively promptly &amp; thoroughly, or let them know when I will be able to do so. They express a lot of gratitude &amp; have shared in specific ways how our friendship and conversations have been helpful to them. The inconsistency spreads to other areas - telling me they bought me gifts but never sending them, pushing back the time for scheduled phone calls by hours (I only set up a phone call with them if I know I am totally free &amp; won't be sitting and waiting for them but if I am honest it still bothers me).\n\nWhen we have conversations about this, they are very verbally receptive, &amp; have taken ownership &amp; made some changes (no important messages I've sent have been ignored since that talk until very recently, months later). But what really bothers me is they have stated repeatedly that they would like to go back and respond to the missed conversations (not something I've asked them to do) as a way to build trust, but they've never done it. Why promise it, then? I do really value the way we are able to speak freely &amp; honestly, &amp; this friendship has pushed me to be more flexible in ways that are healthy for me overall. But it still hurts my feelings, &amp; while I am grateful for so many things about this person, the friendship feels like a lot of energy for inconsistent reward. I used to be a more anxious person &amp; I wonder if this friendship is triggering old patterns for me --- am I drawn to the intermittent reinforcement? Am I making excuses for a person, or am I stretching myself in a way that's good for me?\n\nI know this isn't personal. Their life is chaotic &amp; they have trouble with employment, finances, everything. As we've deepened our friendship, I also am more acutely aware of the differences between our lifestyles, needs, &amp; what we're reaching for right now. So maybe there are just fundamental incompatibilities that preclude a deeper friendship.\n\nI'm wondering about intentionally internally accepting that the former promises are not ever coming to fruition, &amp; even verbalizing to them that I am letting that go. But I am struggling with how to advocate for my needs moving forward (really just if an important-to-me topic (a small percentage of our convo, and I now ask if there is mental space before sharing anything like that) is brought up that it doesn't get ignored without being demanding or expecting what may literally not be possible for this person. Should I just accept inconsistency? It's so hard for me in general, but especially in this personal dynamic. Is letting go now healthier, kinder to both of us?",

She's told me her partner cheated on her and that she's suicidal in the recent past, then the next week was over it. She's told me this week she's so physically sick she thinks she's dying but can't get any medical attention. \n\n It's been taking up so much of my emotional energy, I had to distance myself from her a bit. This caused us to have a major falling out a couple of weeks ago and I told her that I was worried about her and that I think she needs more help than I can provide. We chatted it through and things seemed resolved, but I noticed her partner unfollowed me on social media. It's made me uneasy.\n\nI'm honestly afraid of the fallout at work. She's literally everyone's friend and comes across very caring,  the boss adores her, but I'm worried that she'll complain about me to our coworkers as another of her crises. When we had our big chat she told me she loves me but when I look back at our friendship, some of her past actions say otherwise.\n\nI guess there isn't much I can do about it now but I don't really know how to manage this without making things worse, seeing as we work together.

        "text": "My older sister (36f) and I (32f) started hanging out at the beginning of the pandemic. Both of us were single around the same time. It was good at first but then turned into a nightmare. She became possessive and lied to our siblings about me. \n\nAn example was when I had a date. I told multiple people the day I was going and a bit about the guy. My sister showed up at my house with her children to hang out. I watched a few movies with them and left for the date. My sister seemed upset, but I didn't think much of it. The next day, I received phone calls from two of my other sisters. They told me that my sister, the one I've been hanging out with, called them to complain that I ditched her for a guy. The other two defended me since I told them about the date. She did a similar thing when I made plans with my friends. I didn't confront her because I was confused and trying to figure out why she was doing these things.\n\nAnother example: Me and another sister (33f) planned a family outing at a festival. My sister (36f and same one from the first example) met a guy and invited him to the festival. She wanted to exclude children from the festival. She proposed that the adults go and leave the children at home, letting the older teens babysit. Me and 33f rejected the idea. We planned this with the children in mind and refused to leave them out of it. All of us went. My other sister confronted her about the guy. He is a stranger. She doesn't feel comfortable with her bringing him to her house. Somehow, my name got pulled up and dragged down the mud. \n\nBefore I could have a talk with her about her behavior, more things happened. It spiraled downhill quickly. I needed a break from her and told her not to contact me for a while. She refused to acknowledge it and continued to call me to run errands for her. We got into a huge argument where she refused to accept any responsibility for her actions. I blocked her and am waiting to cool down.\n\nWhat I gather from this situation is that my sister is toxic. Her actions and behavior showed me that she wanted my attention solely on her. She was annoyed that I was dating and hanging out with my friends. It took my time away from her. When she met the guy, she tried to insert him into our plans. She threw me under the bus to distract my other sister and direct her attention to me. My other sister and I talked and realized that she lied to both of us for months.",

And for those without, what do you feel the issues are? \n\nAlso, I am getting ready to apply for jobs and would love any tips on what to ask, or red flags, to determine if the company may expect more than 40hrs/week.\n\n\nBackstory on my situation:\n\nI work in a demanding profession (architecture) that has a reputation for long hours. On top of that, it seems office work in general has devolved into constant meetings/chats/email/calls and the only time to do the work is nights and weekends. \n\nAfter too many years of working like this, I decided to make some changes. In January 2022 I got a new job and set strict boundaries with regard to workload and communication, and was mostly able to stick to 40 hour weeks and little communication outside office hours. \n\nThis was atypical for how the company, and my group specifically, operated, but it was going well. I was able to deliver higher quality work, my junior staff enjoyed working with me, clients and contractors liked me, etc. Despite this, I ended up being fired, with claims that I could not handle my workload and was often ‘unavailable.’ \n\nI believe this is all based on me having the boundaries I mentioned earlier. If someone tried to dump work on me, I would not turn it down, but say “I can start this on x day, after xyz tasks are completed for a deadline.” I declined meetings that were a waste of time, but followed up as needed. I muted most chat notifications and set 3-4x a day to respond, instead of always replying immediately. Same for email. \n\nI don’t feel I was being unreasonable, but it seems the company’s outlook was that if I am not always available, immediately responsive and not working late, I must be doing a bad job. I’m desperately trying to avoid this moving forward, but it feels harder and harder.",

        "text": "I am a 30F and he is 33M\n\nBackground: In a relationship for around 3 years, living together since last year (it's been almost a year)\n\nContext: My BF is the sweetest guy I've ever dated except when we get into arguments/fights. He respects me like an equal, cleans up after my own cats, cleans the house, takes the trash out, plans dates and buys me flowers on **every** special occasion (Birthday, Valentines, etc), is the only one to ever give me an orgasm (I didn't even really know what this was like until I met him) aka sex is amazing, etc. Literally goes above and beyond to always tell me I'm beautiful &amp; how attractive he finds me and etc.\n\nOne thing he lacks is communication which is actually the most important thing in a relationship right next to respect (in my eyes). He was never raised by parents who helped in this area as they were busy working and apparently with his past gf's things would just \"die out\". I understand when younger you might be immature but I am a 30 year old female who has been told that she \"thinks\" like \"an adult\" since the age of 15 or so (1st daughter, many responsibilities). That being said, I am a fucking grown ass woman trying to have a conversation about the hard stuff and it's still a struggle for him 3 years into the relationship.\n\nWe are both very sensitive to tone. We can both sound kind of aggressive (we're being monotonous) but we also both suffer from RBF so even if we think we're being \"nice\", it might not come off that way.\n\nYesterday, I slept on the couch and fell asleep at 6AM (Woke up around 7:15AM) because after getting into a argument last night around 9PM, he just took a shower and went to bed. To be honest, I'm not sure what this \"fight\" was even about. I was honestly just trying to understand why he was being the way that he was that day (kind of lower energy, not really being playful/goofy, just slightly off). Throughout the convo, he said yes, I had been \"annoying\" and \"naggy\" all day (I straight up asked him if he was annoyed by me because that's how I felt) when I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I WAS NAGGING ABOUT AT ALL. Because I wasn't. I literally have no idea what went wrong here and this is usually not the case.\n\nWe woke up early, cleaned, rearranged the new living room layout because he got new speaker stands, ate breakfast, played some games together, went grocery shopping &amp; came back home to play some more games and make dinner together.\n\nThe argument \"ended\" because there was a long moment of silence and I was kind of avoiding eye contact so he just went to the living room.\n\nNow I'm curious if this has to do with the fact that he asked me to hang out with his friend who is a girl who would be in town this week. I said I'm not comfortable hanging out with her because although she's a sweet gal, she hugged him for a little too long around the waist (from the front, wrapping both hands around his waist. squeezing and jumping a bit up and down) while drunk one weekend and this is something that really bothers me. This bothers me more so because the lack of action on his part to say something to his friend who was doing this if he is aware that I do not like it when other women touch him. I also do not touch other men in that way when I'm with someone and I've been touched without consent too much over the years (and growing up) so it's probably a bit of that and my more conservative cultural background. When I said that to him, he kind of did the usual thing when he gets annoyed and doesn't bother talking about it. He just has a \"tone\", slight \"attitude\" but nothing crazy, just basically brushing me off. I didn't say anything more about this and I also actually apologized if I made him feel like I didn't trust him, it's not that. I told him he could hang out with her himself without me being there because I do trust him and I don't think any partner has a right to \"declare\" whether or not you can hang out with a friend you've had before they even met you but I digress. When I told him he can do that, he just said, \"It's fine\" with nothing after.\n\nWhen he was about to take a shower, I went to the bathroom and asked him if he was planning on finishing our convo since he just walked away. When he started the shower I asked why he was behaving so cold, distant and frustrated -- he just kept looking at me with those \"eyes\" of someone who's just done (Going back to RBF &amp; me also being sensitive to body language). This brings up trauma for me as I recall in high school, my dad and I got into a fight and ended up ignoring each other for months until he confronted me about it. I just have so much trauma from my family and the world around me that I ended up telling him the way he's treating me right now is making me anxious and fearful. I told him, if he needs space, he needs to literally tell me otherwise I panic. In his irritated state he said something about there \"being no point telling you when you already know\" or something along the lines of \"What's the point?\"\n\nSo obviously I let him take a shower and when he was done, all he said was, \"I'm going to bed\" and that was all. Today he woke me up around 7:15 since I was in the living room and so we both got ready but didn't even speak to each other. This has never happened before. I told him I'd give him space because he needed it but I didn't think he'd ignore me until the morning? I know that he probably didn't get much sleep because I heard him toss and turn but I also slept at 6AM because of this.\n\nI dug through the internet and landed on the term \"stonewalling\" which is what I think this is? What do I do from here? My logic is this so far:\n\n1. Is he irritated because of my comment about his friend?\n2. Did I miss something? Since he made a comment about tone, perhaps it's the way I \"tease\" or \"joke\" that gets to his feelings but I literally have no idea if I said anything that would trigger this\n3. What should I do tonight? Should I continue to give him space and not talk to him if he doesn't approach me first? I feel like a roommate right now (Admittedly slightly dramatic) and have broken up with him a million times in my head already for treating me like this. Obviously that's not what I'm trying to do but I'm not sure how to approach this situation\n4. Is this appropriate behavior from a 33M man? Have you all experienced this?\n\nFinally, any &amp; all advice on how to better communicate with a man who basically doesn't communicate with you when arguing because he claims, \"It's always the same thing, I don't want to talk about the same thing\" -- How can I get him to understand, if we solved the issue at hand there would be no more \"talks\" of whatever it is? Though I will give him credit for improving (I think I should praise him more for it) seeing as how that one time he kind of raised his voice at me in public (which made me cry at the audacity but also sensitive b/c I was hurt). He learned that esp at his age, it's not okay. I have never been yelled at in public before and after we discussed it, he understood and never did it again because he respects me and understood how I felt. So I'm just overall very confused right now \n\nGuess it's time to start work on an hour of sleep!",

        "text": "I’m about to turn 38 and everything is crumbling around me. I got divorced from and abusive marriage 4 years ago with hopes that things would get better, but things seems to keep getting worse. I stayed home with my kids before the divorce so have had to start a career from scratch. I make $50k a year but live in a HCOL area and am unable to afford rent. I am staying with my sister, but her and I had a falling out due to me holding my mother accountable for abusing me as a kid and now my sister says I have to move out. I fear I will be homeless. I’m also in the middle of another custody battle with my ex. Even though we have a divorce decree stating split custody my ex is refusing to let me see my kids. I’ve had to call the police a few times. The police have filled a report, but said there isn’t much else they can do and so we have to go back to court. Problem is I can’t afford to go back to court. To top this all off I got in a car accident on Valentine’s Day. No injuries thank goodness, but my car needs repair. I don’t have family to ask for help, I don’t have any friends. I just don’t know what to do. My mental health is struggling. I’m starting to feel like the universe is out to get me. Or that maybe I should just kill myself so all of these problems go away. Has anyone hit rock bottom like this and made out the other side? I am desperately seeking advice.",

        "text": "I've been dating my current boyfriend for around 5/6 months. We just got back from a 3-day getaway and this is the first time I've considered ending things with him. \n\nThings have been really great so far. We both work a lot but are able to get together 2 nights in a week and usually try to spend weekends together. We have very similar values and a lot of shared interests. I feel like we usually have a lot to talk about, and share what happened in our day, talk about current events, etc. But I am realizing that our conversation, while usually pretty active, has stayed relatively surface-level. \n\nTo cut to the chase - I was looking forward to three days uninterrupted together but it felt like we ran out of things to say to each other. Admittedly, I know I am on the chattier side and tend to be a bit uncomfortable with silence. Usually, I get around this by asking other people lots of probing questions or getting them to talk about something they are passionate about. To me, it's a way of sharing interest/care for the other person. I've talked about this with my therapist before and she's helped me work on being more comfortable with silence and understanding why it bothers me so much (i.e. fears that the other person thinks I am boring). \n\nBut we ate out several times while away and each time things were very quiet. He'd pull out his phone and go on Twitter and I'd just sit there people watching. By the last day at lunch, watching him scroll through the news on Twitter, I felt oddly lonely. He seemed to get a bit defensive when I asked him to put his phone away. I also got tired being the one to ask questions, bring up conversation, etc. \n\nI really saw the trip as an opportunity for a deeper connection, yet he rarely asks probing questions about me, my past, my thoughts/opinions on things. He's very loving and affectionate but I am realizing how much he tries to avoid \"deeper\" questions. As we were driving home, I pulled out a book I've been reading a psychology book on Maslow/self-actualization and it had a section on cognitive distortions and exploring your fears. He asked about the book so I posed to him some of the questions that were in that section (e.g. do you fear being rejected by peers? Do you feel comfortable expressing your opinion on things even if others don't agree? Are you comfortable being alone?) etc. And he seemed \\*so\\* put off by the questions and thought they were dumb. He gets incredibly inpatient when I ask these types of questions. \n\nI am really confused as to whether the problem is me or if we just aren't compatible. Are my expectations unrealistic that 6 months in I am looking to get to know him on a deeper level? To be honest, I feel like this has been a trend with a lot of men I have dated. They're nice, we get along great, but there's this inability to be introspective or self-reflective. It hit me while we were away that I could think of 10 girlfriends who I would be talking to non-stop if we were doing a weekend getaway. I was chatting about this with my friend last night, and she said this is a very common dynamic between men and women in relationships. \n\nI guess I am looking for some insight into whether my expectations are realistic or getting to know someone on that level takes more time... he really is the best guy I have dated but considering this has been a trend with all my relationships, I am really starting to wonder if I am the problem.\n\nTL;DR - my boyfriend was very quiet on a trip and stopped trying to initiate conversation. He also seems very uncomfortable with \"deep\" questions",

        "text": "So I (35f) am getting married, and prior to my relationship, I have had three friends (two female friends I have known since elementary school and one of their boyfriends who also was included in my friend group that I have known for 12ish years). My fiancée (32m) has a larger circle of friends. Right now we are in the early stages of planning (trying to find a venue and a date), and we have discussed who to include in our wedding party. I have 3 people that I know I want to include (including my sisters and one of my friends. The male friend hates weddings admittedly and would not want to be included, so he is out but will be invited to attend) while his girlfriend will be invited to be in my wedding party. \n\nThe issue is with my other friend. She and I (32f) as I said have known each other since elementary. We even lived together for around 2.5 years in college. She has always been one to keep stuff close to herself, not really one to share or reach out. Over the years, the communication has gotten more and more one sided. I tried to find a time to meet with her to celebrate her birthday last year, reaching out numerous times while she made time with my other friends (I couldn't make it that day, I had plans and they made arrangements prior without my knowledge) but she reached out apologizing as she had a bunch of stuff going on a week or two later. I asked to make sure I didn't do anything to upset her, and she said no, just had stuff come up and meant to reach out earlier. We never ended up making arrangements and I understand stuff comes up. \n\nI am getting to the point where it feels more and more like she has inconsistent communication, you actually have to show up to her house to see her (she barely ever leaves) or answers texts in any way. She barely participates in our friend group chat.\n\nI know I am not perfect and I have probably done stuff that upset her, but I have tried to make an effort, I just got tired of feeling like I have to do all the work. We only hang out at Christmas time, which she hosted this past year or make arrangements ahead enough of time. I also recognize she suffers from depression too and try to be understanding of that. My friends used to actually go over to her house to check on her when they didn't get answers from her from calls or texts and they were worried. My friend has also made plans and then just bailed or never showed up frequently.\n\nI want to invite her to my wedding, but I don't feel like I want to add her to my wedding party because I don't think the effort or intention has been reciprocal. I just do not feel that close friend connection. What I wonder about is I of course do not want to hurt her feelings, and I don't want to ruffle feathers in my friend group as they have a history of trying to goad me to make more effort to check in on her but my friend has never come to my house when I moved, never asked me how my new job was going, never reaches out to check in. I really don't want to be an asshole, so if I am you let me know, but everyone (my fiancée, other family and friends who are not a part of that group) support my thoughts of not including her in my wedding party. I just do not know how to approach it. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",

A lot of my existing friendship group are in serious relationships and they've been amazing but they're in a different place to me, so I've been doing single gal stuff with my new friends (like holidays, weekends away, nights out and stuff) and it's been so good.\n\nI have not found dating fun in the past 6 months, and I've really dipped in and out with it. Things have seriously changed in the time I've been in a relationship and I don't really think for the better. I've been on a few dates but not found what I'm looking for - like at all - until recently. I met a great guy, we're taking it relatively slow because of life and location (we live a couple hours apart) but we've agreed to be exclusive while we get to know each other a bit better.\n\nMy friends that are in relationships are really happy for me, and they're very like \"just go for it, don't let it be a regret, if it doesn't work out then it doesn't work out but at least you'll know\". My single friends, who have both been single for quite a while, are not.\n\nThey'll ask me about what's going on, but be really down on the situation and the guy I'm seeing. I haven't even told them much about him, but they're just kind of negative about it all. I'm not rubbing it in their faces, and I'll just tell them really top level details when they ask. \n\nOne of them has actually said something along the lines of \"I'm happy for you, but also kinda jealous. No-one ever wants to see me as a relationship or move it past a casual thing. I never get someone speaking to me for a month and taking me out on proper dates.\"\n\nFrom my perspective, and the perspective of other friends, there's nothing I'm worried about with this early relationship or this man. Quite the opposite tbh. I do not catch feelings easily at all so even I'm surprised by the way this has moved.\n\nI feel really disappointed, and it's making me want to not tell them anything because their reactions make me feel a bit down. Do I just grey rock them on the topic? Do I say something? I would be so happy for them if they met someone they liked, and it's not like I'm just going to ditch them. \n\nHas anyone else experienced this?",

        "text": "Hello Ladies,\n\nYou in for a read?\n\nI'm posting here because I think I might get very biased opinions on r/psychology or r/religion, and here I'd get more real-life based thoughts.\n\nI (M30) have a very healthy relationship with my mother (F60). Through my adult life, I have learned that my mother is an exceptionally emotionally intelligent person, but that she does not know or understand it. She was, with respect to that, an anomaly in our narrower and wider, religious, family her whole life. Her husband (my father), and my brother are extremely emotionally distant and closed people. Until I grew up and learned about, and explored the depths of my own mind, she had no one to talk this things with. - as she told me.\n\nThe thing is, while I'm telling her psychology/therapy is also for mainatining mental health and is for everyone and we should be more accepting of it, she has learned it as a taboo through her life and her environment, i.e. *YoU oNlY nEeD a ShRiNk iF yOu'Re CrAzY* ... So, yeah.\n\nThe thing is, she tells me the other day that she was on a seminar-meetup with her ultra religious cousin (F60s) about nu-age interpretation of religion (Catholicism). My mom knows I rejected religion and am agnostic, but she still felt comfortable telling me that, which I'm glad and I appreciate. However, she told me that at that meeting they discussed these reinterpreted Christ's Teachings, which I recognized, are actually psychological tools, for example, the \"Grey rock\" tool. Jesus teaches us that we must remain calm to uncomfortable provocations and turn the other cheek, etc etc etc.\n\nShe tells me she likes that *different* interpretation of religion and that she felt it was the correct time in her life for that. \"You mean, you like that it's more in the human and psychological way?\" - me \"Yes!\" - her\n\nShe's generally mildly rejecting psychology and therapy, but I feel as that is her learned opinion rather than genuine personal one. On the other hand, if there's a psychologist speaking about psychology on a talk show? She's glued to the TV!\n\nImagine she likes cars - but NASCAR, because she, and everyone around her, has been watching NASCAR her whole life, and when I tell her there's a lot more to racing and cars than just driving in a strict circle, different and more complex races, F1, GPs, etc etc, a million factors involved, and a huge automotive industry behind them, she rejects, but every time a car's hood pops open, she's very interested in inner workings (e.g. Psy on talk show). Ok, maybe it's a bit weird analogy, but you get my point.\n\nMy question is, how can I point her more towards actual psychology and show her that THAT is what really interests her? May I ask for your thoughts on the matter? On the other hand, should I just leave her with *new interpretation of religion* and shrug it off with a *whatever-works-for-you-if-you're-happy*?\n\nThanks for the read! :)",
