        "text": "Hello - back again with another grammar question. To set up context, the book is describing differences between different 'traditionally verbal' forms - dependents, modifiers, complements, etc. It is also noted that in the book, a clause is defined as NP (and its constituents) + VP (and its constituents). Secondly, it is also noted that the authors of the book reject the terms \"noun clause,\" \"adjective clause,\" and, \"adverb clause.\" \n\nIn Huddleston and Pullum's book The Cambridge Grammar of English, they make this claim: \n\n&gt;\\[i\\] The train to Bath is now approaching Platform 3. \\[with progressive auxiliary aspect\\]  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\[ii\\] The train *approaching* Platform 3 is the 11.10 to Bath. \\[head of clause\\]\n\nIn the context of the quote, the authors deem \"approaching\" as the head of a \"gerund-participle\" acting adjectivally; they assert that \"approaching\" is functioning (and I'm paraphrasing) 'as an expression which is functioning as an adjective'. I have no issue with this - the fact that it is functioning as an expression tantamount to an adjective, but I don't see how an adjective - seemingly on its own - is functioning as the head of a clause. I supply a revision below, turning the adjective phrase into a fully-fledged defining relative clause, but that itself leads to other problems.\n\n&gt;The train ***that is approaching*** Platform 3 is the 11.10 to Bath.\n\nIn this analysis, the above \\[ii\\] \"approaching\" cannot be the head of the clause, because (as asserted in pp.51), auxiliary verbs are the heads of their respective clauses. In this case, \\[ii\\] is almost identical to \\[i\\] in respect to how \"approaching\" is analyzed. Further in the book (at pp.89), this distinction is mentioned in the context of analyzing finiteness as a clausal categorization rather than a verbal one: \n\n&gt;\\[i\\] The boy was seen by the guard. \\[finite, main\\]   \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\[ii\\] The boy who was seen by the guard was her son. \\[finite, subordinate\\]   \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\[iii\\] The boy seen by the guard was her son. \\[non-finite, subordinate\\] \n\nIn the above cases, a distinction is inadvertently made between \\[ii\\] and \\[iii\\] with regards to \"seen\".  A distinction is made here, but not with \"approaching\" - the distinction being an acknowledgement of reducing relative clauses. I have no doubt that the authors would claim \"is\" in \\[ii\\] as the head of relative clause, but would they contradict their work by stating \"seen\" in \\[iii\\] as the head of that clause, despite it being a shortened form. \n\nUnder no circumstance am I attempting to discredit the work of this book; I am merely seeking clarification as to what this book is really trying to posit. Such contradictions lead to fundamental issues. It is entirely possible that I am merely misinterpreting the book, as my concept of grammar may be lacking, or that my inserting (or their removing) a complete relative clause (a) leads to fundamental misinterpretations on my part, or (b) leads to inconsistency in the book that was merely unaccounted for at best, and purposefully omitted in an attempt to not draw attention to their analytic inconsistencies at worst. In the purpose of good faith, I choose to believe the former.",

        "text": "After looking into the proper use of the word “respectively” I’ve discovered that I might be interpreting this word differently to most. To me the sentence “The apple and banana are respectively to the left and right of the orange.” makes sense, feels natural, and reads much more comfortably than “The apple and banana are to the left and right of the orange, respectively.” Both are valid but I strongly prefer the former.\n\nI’ve seen comments where people say “respectively” has to go at the end of a sentence and must refer to the second two words in an ordered pairing (left and right in the above example). Also I’ve read that “respectively” is essentially a direct abbreviation for “in the order given”. This is not how I see it, however. To me, “respectively” carries the broad meaning of “in the order given” but can go either after the second two words or before it. If it goes before it can translate to “the list of things you just read are ordered in the following way”. Is this fundamentally wrong? I don’t think so, but I’m curious about what you think.",

        "text": "After researching, I read that \"here\" is usually classified as an adverb (put after a verb: i.e. go here, stay here ) or an adjective (put after a noun: i.e. this book here, the painting here), but how about when it follows a be verb, such as in this sentence:\n\nThe book is here. \n\n\"here\" modifies \"book\", so it would function as an adjective. Is this correct?\n\nIn one website, this sentence was cited as an example of \"here\" as an adverb:\n\nHere is the church, and here is the steeple. \n\nBut as far as I know, linking verbs, which include be verbs, usually do not take adverbs and instead are followed by adjectives. Little help clearing this up? Thank you!",
