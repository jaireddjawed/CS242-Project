        "text": "alt account for obvious reasons.\n\nPatient was having a what I will call brief behavioral “episodes” that were well-known to the family. The doctor and other healthcare provider at the clinic realized there really wasn’t anything we could do from a medical standpoint, since the episodes were behavioral in nature. The parents refused every kind of treatment and honestly looked pretty calm about it. At that point I took a very passive role and just kind of stood against the wall and talked to the patient’s sibling as she didn’t seem super bothered by any of what was happening. The sibling was making jokes and honestly just being a kid. Nobody else was talking to them so I took it upon myself to start talking to the sibling and honestly had a good conversation.\n\nThe next day, I got an email stating that a complaint was made about my professionalism, and therefore I have *immediately failed my rotation, am banned from the clinic, and will be referred to the University committee for possible further action*. I was floored. I’ve been running the situation in my head over and over and over again trying to think of what I said or did that could possibly provoke such a strong reaction. I haven’t had a chance to even hear what the complaint was or even talk to anyone from my institution before they decided to fail me and threaten repeating my whole clinical year. All from an unknown complaint that is most likely impossible to fight back on.\n\nI’m just venting here I guess. I know that in the long run this will just be something I look back on and laugh about, but I never in a million years thought I’d be in this situation and let me tell you, it’s not fun. So if you’re just finishing up your M2, just know it’s always better to keep your head as low as possible and keep contact with your clinical affairs office to an absolute minimum. They could not possibly give less of a shit about you.",

        "text": "Decided to adapt the residency series(Now an MS4 though)\n\n4am: wake up disoriented, grab the left over coffee from the day before, crush some anki cards on the toilet\n\n4:45am: pre-pre-round on patients\n\n5:00am: pre-round with the intern\n\n5:15am: start updating handoffs and printing lists. Get shit on by the Intern for stapling diagonally instead of horizontally. Redo the staples.\n\n6am: Chief rounds, get shit on again because I stapled the packets where normal human beings usually do it. I redo the staples.\n\n6:30am: Have witnessed the Chief go into 6 rooms, each with 20 isolation protocols without ever putting on an n95, gloves or a gown. A 20-ton bulldozer got nothing on him in the face of contact precautions.\n\n7am: almost time for the first case, go to the OR first to drop gloves and be ready when the patient rolls in. I drop my 7.5/7 and the OR nurse claims I touched the blue while clearly being over a foot away. Get shit on again because a new table has to be made. Ask the scrub tech to grab the chief’s gloves, 14/13.5 of course. You know what big hands mean. \n\n7:30am: Chief comes in and shits on the “new glove brand.” He says “These have always been my size but this brand must run huge.” Grabs 7.5/7 because his hands are the exact same size as mine.\n\n8:00am: the real battle begins, holding 4 retractors and driving camera three people down. Get pimped by the attending on things he is pointing at, I obviously can’t see 3 people down. “Well this is the time of the year they send me students who don’t want to go into surgery”\n\n10am: Chief announces that his laparoscopic appendectomies NevEr last this long. Knees weak, Arms are heavy, I could really use some spaghetti \n\n10:15am: It’s my time to shine, suture cutting time. First cut is too short, second is too long, third is just the right length but alas, I was too slow. God please just let me win one time, I whisper under my breath. The PGY2 looks at me and says “please don’t address me by my formal name while I’m working.”\n\n10:17am: The PGY2 has closed 23/24 port sites. He looks at me “last one is for you, you’ve earned it buddy.” It’s the Veress site that doesn’t even technically need a stitch. Such disrespect.\n\n10:47am: I finish closing the last site, damn I’m good. I wonder why I’m getting nasty looks from the OR staff. PGY2 says “great job, take a full lunch break before the next case because it’s gonna be a long one”\n\n10:50am: Finish the longest lunch break I’ve gotten in weeks, time to roll the next case.\n\n5:00pm: I honestly have no clue what has happened the entire case. Maybe I got a contact high from some spilled Midazolam, thank god for anterograde amnesia. Actually my brain has created another identity to deal with the trauma. Time to go see my therapist.\n\n5:01pm: Just kidding, a consult patient is now in the MICU. Their GIST perforated and it’s time to go to the OR. Dissociative Identity Disorder be damned.\n\n5:02pm: The chief looks at us two lowly MS3s. “You guys don’t have to stay, but it would be good for your learning and the team if at least one of you stay.”\nFk me, the other MS3 has three kids- I gotta take one for the team. \n\n7:00pm: The emergent case finally rolls. Holy shit I can’t believe I’ve been in the hospital for over 14 hours already. I make sure not to whisper anything about God and being saved. Both Gods are already in the room, I will never be saved unless I’m the one on the OR table. The idea sounds like a great one at this point. \n\n7:01pm-12:00am: I am the suction King. No drop of blood or fluid is safe from me. They may be Gods but I’ve gotta at least be Jesus.\n\n12:01am: Suture cutting time. It goes exactly like the first case. The chief looks at me and asks “what happened since the last case, you cut them all the perfect length and with perfect speed.” Fk me, my other identity is a suture cutting machine but I will never know what he knows. \n\n12:05am: Case is closed, chief looks at me dead in the eyes, “ill see you at rounds right?” I think to myself that I have less than 4 hours to eat, sleep, and shower before coming back in. “I’ll be there”\n\n12:15am: I’m so tired I walk directly into the hospital’s fountain/pond. I realize that I am in fact not Jesus. I don’t even come close to walking on water, I sink like a rock in 1.5 feet of water. I can’t believe I’m about to drown in 1.5 feet of water. A brief thought passes my mind, at least this will put me out of my misery. \n\nThe chief walks by, I think to myself oh thank god I’m saved but the only help he offers is a tidbit of wisdom “It’s sink or swim my friend, welcome to surgery.” I realize once again, they will never save me unless I’m on the OR table. “Don’t forget to finish pre-op conference” he yells as he walks out the door. Fk me again, I will not be sleeping tonight. \n\n12:30am: I finally get home and realize that I am paying $40,000 a year for this ass beating. I cry while eating a frozen lasagna and finishing pre-op conference. \nFk me for the 80th time today, I haven’t done my 25 UWorld questions to stay on pace for my shelf.",

I recently got approved for the repayment program, but the listed award only reflects the loans I received up to this point and I still have summer semester loans pending which is close to 40K. When I was applying I did list the entire amount I was taking out including the loans for the \nsummer. I guess my question is will the projected award update and reflect the actual loan amount I applied for once financial aid for summer kicks in or will it stay the same as what’s listed now?",

However, I'm interested in hearing from people who chose that route.\n\nI'm Canadian but I own a house and live part-time in the Caribbean. The medical school here costs about the same as my home university. I am a non-traditional student ([B.Sc](https://B.Sc). and [M.Sc](https://M.Sc).) and I do not want to go back to Canada full-time to study there.\n\nI also don't know where my future is. It could be here in the Caribbean.\n\nIs going to a Caribbean medical school really a terrible idea for everyone? Or just most people? \n\nThanks for your feedback.",

I have been thinking about having a dog for a while and thought he would provide some emotional support when I’m dealing with the stress from school.\n\nHowever I was apparently not well prepared for this new family member coming into my life and feel exhausted now. My sleep was screwed and I can’t focus on my work when I’m in school. My mental health is getting worse because I have no time for myself after school work. I feel very guilty about leaving him alone in my apartment for almost 8 hours Mon-Fri and I’m sad when I see him crying and barking via camera. It’s not fair for him.\n\nI know this sounds very selfish but I feel it’s unrealistic to raise a puppy alone especially I have PhD qualifying exam upcoming this year, then Step exam and residency…\n\nI have contacted the shelter and they said I can return him back on this Friday. Should I do it? I know I’m dealing with sort of “puppy blue” but I just want to make sure I’m doing the right thing for both of us.",
