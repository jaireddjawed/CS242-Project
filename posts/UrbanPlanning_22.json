No attempts by me to explain them in many different ways have proven fruitful. I gave the some PC training materials by my State but I get the sense they won’t be reading them since they have admitted to not even reading my staff reports (at a public meeting no less). I don’t want to push them away because volunteers are in short supply, but how do I get them trained up if they don’t listen and won’t read? The Attorney is on retainer (no in house) and he’s kinda useless too. Any thoughts?",

        "text": "I was doing some research into media markets and some data has surprised me. It made me ask why we consider some cities as \"Big Cities\" and others as just cities.\n\nLet's talk about Ohio.\n\nMost people consider Cleveland a big city. There are numerous songs about the city and they have a team in 3 of the big 5 sports leagues in America as well as the Rock &amp; Roll hall of fame. Impressive.\n\nCincinnati is another big city. You have the Reds playing baseball &amp; the Bengals playing football and soon to have FC Cincinnati playing proper football.  Again, teams in 3 of 5 big sports leagues.\n\n. . . but those cities are called home to 386k and 301k people respectively. Compared to the 879k who call Columbus, OH home, those Big Cities don't seem so big. but Columbus doesn't have any of the prestige. \n\nIs that due to their sports teams?\n\nColumbus is home to an NHL &amp; MLS team, but they don't seem to have the same prestige as the NFL, MLB, &amp; NBA teams of Cleveland &amp; Cincinnati.  Cause or Effect?\n\nEl Paso, TX may not seem like a big city, but as America's 22nd largest city, its 684k residents help it top 22 other cities in America with a team in at least one of the big 5 leagues. That includes Olympic host Salt Lake City with their 2/5 and 201k residents.\n\n. . . . .   \n\nSo what defines a \"Big City\"?\n\n^(data source:) [^(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_United\\_States\\_cities\\_by\\_population)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population)",

Currently, I work for a non-profit in environmental justice, and part of the work involves working on the city's general plan and the RTP/SCS. This interaction with planners, and the need to connect planners to the community and vice versa, has interested me to the point that I want to take the step in that direction. My job has no level up, no growth potential, and I'm sinking into hating a lot about it. \n\nMy husband and I bought our first house five months ago, with help from family. Honestly, we probably shouldn't have, but I wanted to move to an even slightly better location to benefit our three boys, ages 5, 3, and 1.5, because of the terrible air quality unfortunately affecting them.\n\nSo here I am, 31 years old, with three boys and a mortgage, a tight budget, and my loans (now at 12k from 25k) and his loans (70k) to pay off. At this point, is it possible that I could become a planner? And if so, where do I start? Do I need to start from the beginning and get a bachelor's first? Is it possible to do online or should it be campus (which I technically prefer but would do either way).\n\nThanks for your help!\n\n",

Is it better to be a jack of all trades &amp; have a variety of courses or to streamline in specific subjects?)**\n\nThanks!!",

        "text": "Normally tolls are in place with the intent of making money from the citizenry to pay for things like road maintenance. You have a greater effect on a road the longer the distance you drive, this is why tolls normally increase with the distance you travel. This kind of toll has a different intent, the intent is to alleviate travel times for the people and as such the goal isn't to make money, per say.\n\nIt works like this, consider a highway that's inundated every day during both rush hours. It's mostly used by commuters traveling to work or school, but also by people who are not and to places that are relatively close to them. How inverse-distance tolling works is it tolls people based on the distance they drive on a highway, but the toll gets cheaper &amp; eventually free the greater the distance you drive. The rationale is if you had to drive X+ miles on that road then you exemplify that you actually needed to use it and as such aren’t penalized. Conversely, if you only traveled a few miles or exits then it’s likely you taxed a long-distance artery needlessly, for what local roads are for. \n\nNot only does it incentivize taking express traffic to local roads, there is also a secondary effect to disincentivize traffic that could be held off for another time. If that toll is only in effect for the rush hour commutes then drivers who are heading to go to GameStop, or get their hair done, or to any leisure activity, they may wait until after 10am. Studies have shown that a mere modest drop in percent of cars on the road has a drastically positive effect on commute times and average speed.\n\nIt’s just a theory that exists in my head and I’d like to hear what you all think about it.\n",

In my last year of completing my degree, I discovered that in my lifetime more than half the population is going to be living in urban environments. This made me realize that I can make an impact by redesigning cities to have more green spaces and more efficient transportation (walking, buses, etc.) routes. I view driving as a chore, so I’ve always been frustrated with the lack of sidewalks outside of large towns and cities, along with inefficient bus routes. Cities also feel cagey to me from the lack of greenery.  \n\nIf I am looking to make cities easier to navigate without a car and to bring nature into the city landscape, is getting a masters in urban design, planning or landscape architecture the right route?\n\nAny good university suggestions are also appreciated!

I am considering a career in urban planning yet I have some questions about the field. \n\nFirst, personal details. I am concurrently pursuing a double-major in Spanish and International Relations with a minor in Philosophy. I am a rising junior at a small liberal arts college and my GPA stands at a 3.986. My father grew up in a poor coal mining family but went back to school at the age of 45 and now is enjoying a career as a regional transportation planner - he seems very fulfilled in his work. I had previously wanted to be a lawyer but every lawyer I talk to tells me to STAY AWAY. My father, on the other hand, loves his job.\n\nMy questions:\n\n1) What is the day-to-day life of an urban planner like?\n\n2) What is the level of creativity that one can exercise in this field?\n\n3) Are there routes to higher salaries or does the profession top out around 75k?\n\n4) Can the urban planning degree be leveraged for other related career paths?\n\n5) If you could do  your education over again, what would you do differently?\n\nThank you very much! I love this sub!",

        "text": "I'm trying to fit in as much background reading as I can about urban design, especially as it \nrelates to sustainability.\n\nOne article I've found is about the Dutch approach to designing safe streets: \n[link](https://bicycledutch.wordpress.com/2012/01/02/sustainable-safety/). One principle they use is \nclassifying streets according to their function: through roads, access roads, distributor roads. It \nseems to me as if access roads cannot be through roads, and that by separating the two functions \npedestrians and cyclists are protected from car drivers tempted to speed, or use local roads for \nthrough traffic when that traffic should be on roads where cars can be kept to themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, I've been watching talks by Jeff Speck, and I just found [this great \narticle](https://walkablestreets.wordpress.com/1991/05/18/traditional-neighborhood-development-will-the-traffic-work/) \nwhich is the transcript of a talk given by Walter Kulash.  \nI've been surprised, especially in Jeff's talks that the designs he shows seem to use wide roads \nwith enough space for cars to flow both ways, and car parking, and cycle lanes. And these designs \nare mainly grid based. Also, the article I've linked gives a great explanation of how grid systems \nof small local roads are more efficient for car traffic than arterial systems.\n\nSo there seems to be a conflict between these two approaches and I'm wondering how it's navigated by \nurban planners/designers.\n\nIn one case you don't have through traffic flowing, and I assume the streets can be narrower and \ndensities can be higher. To me, this sounds like a more pleasant environment for walking and \ncycling.\n\nIn the other case, you have relatively dense grid layouts which ease car traffic congestion but \nstill relatively wide roads, and I would imagine it's still not all that pleasant to be a pedestrian \nin this case.\n\nAm I missing something here? Is there an incompatibility or not? Is one method just superior to the \nother in practice?\n\nOne idea I had was that Jeff Speck et al. can't present their ideal utopia since we still have to \ngradually transition from what we have now to that utopia.\n\nSorry for the long post.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/93kdfc/pros_and_cons_of_parking_escooters_or_any_other/",
        "text": "If we are to treat the value of an electric scooter and a car at a 1:1 ratio, why or why not should a scooter not have the right to use a curbside parking space that would have traditionally been used by a car? I would love to read your opinions on this matter. \n\nPerceived \nPros\n\n1. About 15 scooters fit comfortably in a car space utilizing the popular Xiaomi at (42.5 x 16.9 x 19.3 inches) to the conventional stall of 8' x 26' feet. (https://www.ladbs.org/docs/default-source/publications/information-bulletins/zoning-code/parking-lot-design-ib-p-zc2002-001.pdf?sfvrsn=19). Therefore if a human importance model is to be considered, an argument can be made that one single scooter is ok to take one single parking space. Efficiency for a PEV could only rise as say, 5 scooters taking five parking spaces can have an equal effect of a potential storage of 75 scooters vs a maximum of still only 5 vehicles. \n\n2. They do not clutter a sidewalk. No pedestrian interference ever, as a scooter would not have to leave the pavement to enter a sidewalk or vice-versa. \n\n3. They are left in places where cars would be allowed, therefore they would not be potential obstacles to emergency, service vehicles etc.\n\n4. The (possible) incentive to direct people towards using the scooters on a street rather than their illegal usage on sidewalks\n\n5. They maintain their ability to be *left at a reasonable location not hampering the \"dock-less\" model. \n\n\nCONS\n\n1. A Scooter does not have the same *value* of a car (they are not as fast, costly, large, cumbersome to maintain efficient), curbside spaces were meant for cars, and are to remain solely for cars, unless otherwise specified.\n\n2. Parking a Scooter will not generate parking revenue to the city unless a Scooter company is made to pay through policy negotiation.\n\n3. Anger from motorist towards PEVs (Personal Electric Vehicles)will increase due to \"lost\" parking spaces. Therefore creating a political &amp; policy pushback, civil anger, and destruction of property.\n\nEDIT: \n\nPossible Pro\n\n1. Dockless sharing does not fit into a personal bicycle parking paradigm, as the fear of theft no longer is a consideration. ",

        "text": "https://i.redd.it/2graa0tctcd11.png\n\n\\+++ **This contest is now over.** [**Vote here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/9a788u/vote_now_august_rurbanplanning_contest/)**. +++**\n\n\\+++ **About** \\+++\n\nAfter the [first contest](https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/90i5tc/first_ever_rurbanplanning_contest/) received a lot of upvotes, but only [five submissions](https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/91s4x2/vote_now_first_ever_rurbanplanning_contest/), it is now time to launch the second and much improved edition of the r/ubanplanning contest.\n\nThis contest is all about sharing ideas with people from all over the world. Showing what you think cities should look like and discussing the ideas of others. Theres no need to be professional or detailled unless you really want to, draw on a napkin if you like. There is nothing to win except bragging rights.\n\n\\+++ **Location** \\+++\n\nThe [Reseda neighborhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reseda,_Los_Angeles) in Los Angeles, California, USA.\n\nMore specifically all of the [area](https://www.google.com/maps/@34.1903885,-118.5316717,1096m) enclosed by Vanowen Street, Victory Boulevard, Reseda Boulevard and Lindley Avenue. That is one 0.5 x 0.5 mile square. As can be seen on the picture above.\n\n\\+++ **Scenario** \\+++\n\nA billionaire fan of r/urbanplanning, who also happens to be imaginary, just bought a quarter square mile of land in Reseda. He is ripping everything down and starting from scratch. He wants you all to present your ideas for this new quarter.\n\nThe new quarter should be sustainable and open to everyone. It should be a present to the world. Think about how you are going to connect it to the rest of the city with public transportation. Money isn't that much of an issue, so make it nice, but don't go overboard. Maybe even suggest some buildings.\n\nThe canal that runs through this block is part of the [LA River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_River). You can get rid of the concrete canalization or beautify the banks however much you want. However, changing the general path of the river is not allowed. Please be aware that this stream turns from a small brook to a [raging river during rain storms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FgRevINLIQ).\n\n\\+++ **How to enter** \\+++\n\n(1) Create an imgur album. Send [me](https://www.reddit.com/user/autobahnia) the link to this album by personal message, it can be empty at first. Everything, including text must be in this album by August 24th.\n\nAll images must be [watermarked](https://imgur.com/1V1Fwtk), this is to ensure that the work of those participated is not exploited by others. Submissions without a watermark will not be considered.\n\nYou can, but don't have to write your name under \"I'M TAKING PART\" (below in the comments) to let others know that you will be taking part in this contest.\n\n(2) On August 25th a voting thread will be opened. I will create a reply in this thread for every entry - stating contestant name and linking to the imgur album. People can up- or downvote this reply and discuss.\n\n\\+++ **Interesting Links** \\+++\n\n[Homepage of the LA Metro](https://www.metro.net/)\n\n[25 Photos of the Los Angeles River Before It Was Paved in 1938 on curbed.com](https://la.curbed.com/2013/8/15/10208734/25-photos-of-the-los-angeles-river-before-it-was-paved-in-1938)\n\n[9 Views of the LA River Today and Before It Was Paved in 1938 on curbed.com](https://la.curbed.com/2015/8/19/9936922/la-river-before-concrete-after)\n\n[A picture of Reseda Park in 1932](http://museumsanfernandovalley.blogspot.com/2010/12/reseda-park-1932.html)\n\n[Streetmix ](https://streetmix.net)\\- a tool to quickly show street sections\n\nFeel free to discuss ideas and the rules of this contest in the comments.\n\nEdit: Added Streetmix link\n\nEdit2: Added section in \"About\"\n\n\\+++ **This contest is now over.** [**Vote here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/9a788u/vote_now_august_rurbanplanning_contest/)**. +++**",
