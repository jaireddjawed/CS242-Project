        "text": "my never ending TMobile revenge\n\nAbout ten years ago I had a plan with T-Mobile. It lapsed and I called to cancel it since I had switched to another carrier. The following month I got another bill from them. I thought it must be a mistake so I called again, and the person on the phone apologized and said it was taken care of now. Problem solved. Nope. \n\nNext month I get another bill and late fees from the previous month. So, I call again. They then go on to say they have no record of me cancelling my plan and they will cancel it but I need to pay the bill. Mfers. I'm pissed, no way I'm paying them a cent for a service I cancelled. Over the next few months I keep calling trying to get them to get rid of the charges, talk to all kinds of supervisors, and the bill goes to collections. Now it's on my credit report. So, I pay it. \n\nIt then becomes my mission to cost T-Mobile much much more than it cost me. I figured it takes 7 years for my credit score to clear so I will spend seven years costing T-Mobile money. I do a little research on keywords and what they cost companies, and which ones cost more. Then I go to work on my petty revenge mission using various search engines online from both personal and work computers with various key words like, \"cell phone plan\", \"cellphone\", \"smartphone\" etc. When I get a sponsored add from T-Mobile I click it. But not just click it, oh no, I'm going to go a few pages deep, click here and there add plans and phones to carts just to cost them more. Over the years i wasn't 100% consistent daily, but I probably clicked hundreds of not thousands of times, and I still do my T-Mobile paid add search from time to time even though it has cleared my credit score.",

        "text": "Not sure if this is petty revenge or malicious compliance, but please enjoy nonetheless. TLDR at the bottom.\n\nThis anecdote takes place several years ago, at a company I used to work for. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis particular company had a staff entrance at the side of the building, where the staff used to enter/exit, and there was a \"works\" car park there too. There was also a very posh entrance at the front of the building, which was reserved for the directors and any customers that visited. It was known that if any staff tried to use the front entrance (we called it the \"exec\" entrance), they'd normally get told off for overstepping their rank. Yes, some companies are still this backwards even in the mid-2010s.\n\nAnyway, this starts on one particular morning, where a customer I'd been working with was visiting our building. My boss's boss not only gave me free reign to come and go through the main entrance to facilitate our customer (e.g. people arriving at different times, taking them for lunch, doing a tour of the building etc), but he also authorised a parking space for me in the posh exec car park. This was signed off by one of the directors. No issues, we had a great day and the customer was very impressed.\n\nFeeling like I'd done a good day's work, I went back to get my car from the posh part of the building. Living in England, the rain had picked up, so I was looking forward to getting out of the bad weather. Being selfish, I had my hair done quite nicely and it'd be nice to come back home, looking presentable.\n\nWhat I didn't know, was that after 5pm, the posh entrance was closed. There's a secure gate to stop vehicles going in/out, and unfortunately my car was parked in the secure part. To make things worse, I'd left my car keys with the receptionist - who'd already finished for the day. This was when I learned that we worked hard so the directors didn't have to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis takes place before taxi apps were commonplace, so I was stood in the rain for about half an hour waiting for an overpriced taxi from the nearby railway station, getting more and more frustrated that I couldn't go home in my own car. So, I ended up sat in a taxi, very annoyed, hair and makeup ruined, staring at a bill for £50 just to get home - let alone the trip back to work the next day, which cost slightly more due to rush hour traffic.\n\nWhen I went to grab my car keys the next day, I walked through the exec entrance. Within seconds, I was asked why I was entering through this door - I said \"morning all, you've got my keys, my car's parked there - look, it's the blue car in space #6\" - and I expected just to get given my keys and told to go away. However, what I was told was no, sorry, this is an executive entrance, please exit the building and use the staff entrance round the corner. \n\nI politely said - \"look, my car's parked just outside. You have my keys in that box by your arm that you're pointing with - can you just give me my keys so I can leave and take my car with me?\"\n\nWell, this didn't happen. The person behind the desk was so proud that they had some power over others, that I was just told \"only senior employees and customers are permitted here. Please use the side door. You are not authorised to use this entrance. Please do not try and enter again otherwise you will be written up.\" I wasn't rude but I realised being written up wouldn't be of any favour to me. I also got annoyed that I'd put the effort in earlier, so I wouldn't fight what could be construed as a disciplinary threat. The last thing I asked was that I had this written in a formal email, which the angry secretary was more than happy to do so, including phrases like \"gross misconduct\" and \"a serious lack of respect\". Not only did I save this email to every folder in my mailbox, I printed it a few times and stored it in various places around where I worked - just so I could get a hold of it if needed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPetty revenge activated. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShortly after this, I told my boss that the senior team wouldn't let me get my car back and threatened to write me up for asking so. He was 100% behind me. He said if the company's holding your car, get taxis everywhere. Your commute, going to get lunch, your gym session in the evening, etc.\n\nSo that's what I did. I left my car in the executive car park and just took cabs everywhere, basically my personal life. I took lunch out of the office every day. I went grocery shopping as I normally do (twice a week, plus one or two times for quick visits when I forgot something). Going to the gym. Visiting my parents. Nights out with my bf. I purposely left my car in that car park as long as I could, until I got asked about it. All the time, racking up taxi fares. I had it in writing from my manager and since neither of us were \"exec\" level, we didn't want to push back. Rather, I just wanted to see how far I could push it.\n\nAfter 7 weeks(!), one of the directors had noticed my car looking very sorry for itself in their car park. At least one customer had asked why there was an abandoned car there, with bird poo all over it and a flat tyre. We have car park passes so it only took a few seconds to ask which employee car pass #12345 belonged to - and when I was asked, I forwarded the email saying I wasn't allowed to get my car back. I then asked if I could get half an hour with the Legal director as I wasn't sure if this was illegal, preventing an employee from retrieving their own car?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs soon as I mentioned the Legal director, I was asked to come straight in via the posh entrance and speak to a few of the directors who'd somehow made the time for me. Literally, I sent my email at 11am and by the time I'd got back from lunch (in a taxi), at 1pm, I had an email requesting a chat ASAP.\n\nThey were quite nervously sat around a table, and as soon as I mentioned the potential legal issue of withholding an employee's personal possessions without due reason, the directors fell over themselves to apologise and say it was a miscommunication and I was free to take my car back. I asked why it took 7 weeks to get to this point, and I'd wanted my car back as soon as I could because, well, it's my car! The directors had no answer and were surprisingly very quiet.\n\nWell, that's where it gets fun. I presented a bill for about £3,000 of taxi fares over 7 weeks, and said that this needed paying. Furthermore, as my car now had a flat battery and looked awful, the company could also pay for recovery to my car dealership, pay for car detailing because of the bird poo all over it, and a full dealership service and health-check, plus 2 months finance that I was paying on the car that they had in their possession. I also told them that I would no longer entertain any customers going forward, and pulled out the printout that I was supposed to be able to park there and entertain customers as necessary, signed by one of the directors in that very room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe atmosphere was not only tense enough that you could cut it with a butter knife, but I felt a resounding feeling of deflation from the directors, who'd realised they'd fucked up by asking employees to do their work for them (e.g. showing customers around) - and then doubling down by kicking those employees out of their little corner before the job was complete.\n\nAll-in-all, I wouldn't be surprised if it cost the company over £6,000 just because I wasn't allowed to go and get my car back from the managers' parking because a secretary didn't let me.\n\nI also heard on the grapevine that as I declined to carry out any customer hospitality visits, this particular customer wasn't impressed that their previous friendly, knowledgeable folks were no longer available. My boss, who'd supported me all the way, had stood behind me and said that his team would no longer carry out any customer visits either. \n\nOur customers weren't amused when the directors took them to golf and posh dinners but made no commitments or shared any information on the work we'd been doing with them. They didn't renew their 7-figure contract; I'm not sure if I was just told that to make me feel better or not, but either way, smiles all round for me. My little car is still going strong, I'm in a much better place, and whenever I drive past that company's buildings I give them a salute. I'll let you guess how many fingers I use.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little addendum that I heard a bit later. When my boss went to go and see the angry secretary, presumably to try and cool things down, she also told him to get out. He was told no, but then he asked if she could swipe him through the side entrance, which was an all-employee corridor. She said no, go back outside. As mentioned, this is England. It was pouring with rain. He was wearing a suit as he was seeing a customer later (because I said I wasn't doing it.) No matter - she stood by saying no. So, he asked for an umbrella. Was told to get out unless he wanted written up too. \n\nHe doesn't take bullshit anywhere near as much as I do. He's got nearly 40 years in the company and they know they can't lose him. He used his very expensive laptop as an umbrella instead, got back to his desk with a completely dead machine, and then billed the further £3,000 for a new machine to the secretary's company code. He made sure her name was on the bill. Fast forward 3 months and for some reason, the directors were down one angry secretary. I can't imagine why.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR - company asks me to host customers, I do, they don't let me get my car back from their managers car park, so they end up paying for taxis and car repairs. Things escalate when I call them out and the client doesn't like wishy washy directors selling them dreams and promises, rather than the normal grunts who just tell them how it is. My boss doubles down on this and ensures that the angry secretary is fired.",

        "text": "Last year when I was planning my wedding and the prenuptial photoshoot, I was stressed and was complaining how everything was so expensive and that I couldn’t get what I really wanted. My older sister would always tell me how everything (the photoshoot, the location, the low budget dress, etc) was not important and what’s important was that “as long as the groom shows up on your wedding day” and that it doesn’t matter if the location or the dress was not as nice, etc. Basically, she would always comment how everything is not important as long as “the groom shows up” on your ceremony.\n\nI would always get annoyed by her comments but kept it to myself and at the back of my mind, I always thought and told myself that I’ll wait until she’s the one planning her wedding and photoshoots. I agree that the most important thing is the bride and groom, but fellow soon to be brides know why I was annoyed with budgeting, not getting the locations or vendors I wanted, etc. \n\nFinally! The day came and she’s now planning her wedding for next year and now, she’s complaining and stressing out like how I was complaining and stressing last year. I saw my opening and told her exactly what she kept telling me before. All the things she said to me before, word per word, I told her back. \n\nIt was such a sweet comeback for me. I waited this long and was so happy when I got to tell her her own words. Eat that!",

        "text": "*Sorry if this is a bit vague, but I'll dox myself otherwise.*\n\nYears ago, four of us joined a startup to invent and build a product for a specific industry that we were experienced in.  The company founder was a prominent local businessman (Sal) who promised us shares and profit sharing.  Within a couple years we were beating the competition and even landed a big fortune 500 company as a customer/partner.\n\nUnfortunately Sal's pledge to *share the wealth* never happened.  We knew the expenses and the revenue and the expected profits, but Sal had lots of mysterious debts and expenses and investors to drain it all away.  We scraped by with *frequent missed/late paychecks* on the verge of bankruptcy while Sal evaded our questions, ignored our advice, and slept comfy in his seaside mansion.\n\nSo we all quit.  And started our own company.  And within a couple years we re-invented a superior product.  And stole his offshore development team.  And stole his manufacturing contractors.  And stole away market share.  And stole away customers.  And stole that fortune 500 company as a partner, who eventually decided to buy us out for a few million.\n\nIn hindsight, Sal never knew how to run a company.  He was a master con-man with a long history of failed companies, screwed-over investors, nepotism, and pump-and-dump penny stock schemes.  The good news is that he's a workaholic; still going to the office every day at age 77 trying to hustle.  Instead of spending his golden years travelling and fishing and enjoying his grandchildren, he will die at his desk.",

        "text": " I was on a long business trip to Vietnam from Paris and most of the other passengers were heading to a major International Francophone conference in Hanoi, where French is still spoken due to the colonial history. My seat was by the window, one I'd paid early for, as it suits me best for getting a bit of sleep as jet lag can be a problem in meetings.\n\n On returning to my seat after my first trip to the toilet my place had been taken. I politely asked the man in my seat if I could have my seat back, in English and then in my rusty, but understandable French, and both times he pretended not to understand and just grunted, giving a  Gallic shrug. Not that it needed language..we both knew what was happening.\n\n So I asked a passing stewarddess if she could explain to him. He moved, but made a great show of reluctance and anger. After that, he and his colleague did all they could to make me uncomfortable. Refusing to let me out of my seat, for instance, pretending not to understand. The flight was many hours, and twice a steward had to tell  them to move to let me out for a trip to the loo.\n\n Then I spotted something on my menu. It was printed in    both Vietnamese and French. But there was something odd about the words' Petit déjeuner '. On close examination, there was a very small very discreet sticker over it. Someone had gone to considerable painstaking lengths to cover it up. And I  could guess why. Peeling it off, I saw the word \\`Breakfast'.   This would have deeply offended a French speaker's sensibilities.\n\n I spent the rest of my flight picking up every stack of menus on each divider on each section of the plane, and hiding what I did them  back at the seat. Everyone around me noticed but had no idea what was happening...just that I was acting weird with the menus, then returning them.\n\n Finally....with all around watching me intently, near the end of the flight, I held the last menu up so my  fellow passengers could see and made a point of peeling it off...and then they realised...\n\n Every menu now said \\`Breakfast'.",

I would go out there periodically with a bucket and shovel snow and needles onto the bucket. I would let the snow melt while the needles where in a strainer. Every few days I would shove handfuls of pine tree needles onto the hood of her car, under the hood, on her front porch, surrounding her car. She got pretty upset... but I was simply returning her pine tree needles she forgot ON MY PROPERTY. Then she moved away, the end.",

        "text": "My mom is very well skilled in gardening, native plants, and ornamental plants. And got a job at a local nursery. She absolutely loved it and was good at it. But there was one problem, the owner.\n\nNow we live in a Southern town, the owner was a local small business owner of the nursery and a restaurant. Her daddy was very well known in the area, as he had a lot of money. But she was cray cray.\n\nOne day she would be sicky sweet, you know the \"bless your heart\" type. The next day she would be losing her mind screaming at them, throwing things, damaging products. I am mad at my mom for not recording the discussion about illegal overtime practices. As when someone worked overtime she always made them to put it on the next time sheet.  🤦‍♀️. And there was more than just these incidents.\n\nAnyway, it was right before Halloween. The owner approaches my mom and told her she wanted an anchor carved into a pumpkin.\nMy mom had no tools for that, didn't even have a knife. So she just politely asked \"Okay, what should I use to do that?.\" The owner told her to figure it out and stormed off.\n\nMy mom gets her co-worker to help her find something. But they couldn't find any thing that would work.\n\nSo the coworker approached the owner and asked again about tools. Well this finally set her off, the owner started screaming about insubordinates. \nShe starts ranting about doing it herself, beginning to grab pumpkins dropping some of them even breaking some.\nShe goes inside and rants to the manager (also her friend). The manager makes an appearance, and lectures them about how they should not have an attitude with the owner. And that they just need to do what she says no matter what. That if they didn't have tools then they should have gone out and purchased the tools. \nThey tried to explain their side but it was no use. My mother basically said \"Well, I didn't have an attitude then but I do now.\"\n\nNext day my mom comes into work, and the display that she had designed for the front of the business had been completely torn down. She was upset because she worked really hard on it but she decided she wouldn't say anything.\n\nLater she was sat down by the owner and basically told so that what she did was insubordinates. And that with the attitude she has the owner didn't believe she would be a good fit for there anymore.\n\nMy mother was very upset and messaged me. I was enraged. But then she texts me, \"Do you know anywhere that still selling pumpkins?\"\n\nUnfortunately, the nursery was the only one still selling pumpkins after Halloween. But since my mother worked there, I happen to know that they had no security. I also happen to know when no one was there. And the owner did ask her to carve one of their pumpkins. So I went ahead and snagged one on my way home one day. And my mother decided to return her keys in a perfectly carved pumpkin.\n\nShe said the look on the owner's face as she had to get her shit together and politely say it was nice working with you. Was enough for her. Unfortunately this subreddit doesn't let me share pictures or I would show a picture of the carved pumpkin. Did a drive by after she dropped it off. Smashed out back, totally worth it.",

        "text": "the setup:  I spent my teenage years living in a small town of around 3,000 to 4,000 people.  My parents had purchased a house near the downtown area, just a literal block away from the bank and all the mom and pop shops.  It was very convenient... except for one weekend out of the entire year.\n\nFor one weekend in October, this town had a very well known festival.  Our small community ballooned from 3 to 4 thousand people living there to easily over 30k people invading for just that one weekend.  There were booths, a carnival, a bus tour that took people out to see historical sites, a play production, and vendors everywhere selling homemade goods and food.  \n\nParking was A Nightmare (tm).  No street was safe. No lawn was safe.  It wasn't unusual for me to walk outside Saturday morning and find vehicles parked on our side lawn.  We were very close to the main action, and some of the vendors asked very nicely if they could park there for convenience.  My Dad was pretty chill about it.  If you asked, he always gave permission as he understood how harry it was.\n\nWe also had a two car garage with four spaces for parking.  Two outside the garage, and two between those spaces and the side walk.  Those two were split by a median that had a spindly tree in the center.  My parents would park their cars in the garage and offer the four free spaces to friends and family.  And almost always we'd get elderly and/or handicapped people asking if they could park there, to which my father always said yes.  In fact, he started giving people our number to call and reserve a spot for free.  \n\nNow for the actual deets:\n\nOne year someone decided to park in front of the median to our driveway.  It wasn't a large car, I suppose they thought they could fit there without issue.  However, the front and back bumper were blocking both sides of the driveway.  A few of our handicapped friends arrived early and had to drive over the curb a bit to get in.  My father wasn't happy about it, but getting the car towed wasn't really possible.  As I said, this was a tiny town and the cops had their hands full.  Plus, getting a tow truck into that area would have been very difficult, considering three of the four streets by my house (we were on a corner) were blocked by the festival.  \n\nNothing to be done about it.  At some point whoever owned the car returned to it and left while we weren't aware.  \n\nThe next year, it happened again.  Not sure if it was the same car.  But again, it was blocking the driveway on both sides.  I walked outside that morning to greet the vendors I knew would be on our side lawn and then go get funnel cakes and there that car was.  This time it was there /all day/.  My father was really unhappy.  We had friends and family and folks who had reserved spots having to curb check every time they wanted in or out.\n\nWe figured they wouldn't be back on Sunday, as they hadn't been last year.  But also, we weren't sure if it was the same person.  My dad, however, decided to put a plan in action /just in case/.\n\nSure enough, the next day there's that car again, blocking our driveway.  I sighed and shook my head and ran off to get the morning's coffee and funnel cakes for the family.   On returning, my father was putting his plan into action.\n\nThe night before, he'd taken our cars out of the garage and parked them on the now empty streets.  Soon as he saw that car had parked itself into the median again, he gleefully parked both cars a fraction of an inch before their front and rear bumpers.  Then he got himself a cooler of beer, cracked one open, and sat on our front porch in a rocking chair to watch.\n\nIt was a really nasty, cold, rainy day.  So thankfully we didn't have any reservations from friends to park.  My dad spent the better part of the day watching the world go by, drinking beer, and waiting.  Eventually the couple who owned the car returned.  They got into their car and turned it on to get the defroster working.  And sat there for a good fifteen minutes.  Probably assessing their situation.  The driver gets out, checks the front bumper, then the back.  My dad is grinning from ear to ear but he doesn't call out to the guy.  \n\nFinally he leaves, his wife or girlfriend or whatever stays in the passenger seat.  When he returns he has a cop with him.  Now, this is a small town, the cops all know my father, he's a local mechanic.  Also, there's an ordinance about drinking alcohol in public, so Dad had to swiftly stash his beer and close the cooler. \n\nThe cop just shook his head as he observed the situation.  I'm pretty sure he was laughing internally, or maybe screaming since the festival was always hard on the local police force.  He approaches my father.\n\n\"Hey (Dad), how's it going today?\"\n\n\"Good day to ya, Officer.  Just enjoying the scenery on this rainy day.\"\n\n\"Look, I get that you're unhappy they parked where they did.  But I'm going to need you to move your vehicles.\"\n\n\"I just want an apology from them, Officer. And to promise they never do it again.\"\n\nThe cop just sighed heavily. \"I'm sure they are *very* sorry, (Dad). Please move your cars for me? I'd be real appreciative.\"\n\nSo Dad takes his time doing so.  The guy didn't get out of his car or roll down his window the whole time while this is going on and as soon as the cars are moved, he takes off.  But not without first getting a ticket from the officer.  \n\nWe never had anyone attempt to park in the median ever again.  But Dad still kept our cars parked on the street just in case.",

        "text": " Thanks to  u/human_suitcase for suggesting I crosspost this here.\n\nI work in a place with a deeded parking garage - each spaced is owned by a resident.  But we only have 75 spots, and 300 units.  If you don't have a spot, ya gotta permit park your car on the street or find a parking garage in the neighborhood.\n\nHad one sweet old lady (I'll call her Granny) who owned a Mini-Cooper and a parking space to go with it.  Another couple who rented a unit did not have a parking spot, and took to planting their economy car in her spot . When Granny complained, the renters would just say they were entitled because there were so many empty parking places, so Granny could park somewhere else. (WHAT THE HECK DO THEY NOT GET ABOUT DEEDED PARKING!)\n\nThis continued until the day the sweet old lady decided to be not-so-sweet. Pulled her car in front of the two ~~grifter's~~ renter's car and parked bumper to bumper. Put a note on their car saying \"Parking in this space is $150 a day. Please leave a check with the concierge.\"\n\nSo the two ~~grifters~~ renters showed up at my desk bitching about their car being blocked off and actually expected me to tow Granny's car off! I had to re-explain that deeded parking meant that I could not tow a car from Granny's spot anymore than I could rearrange furniture in her apartment. It's her land, she owns it, you abandoned your car on her property, talk to Granny.\n\nSo after 20 minutes or so of the ~~grifters~~ renters bitching, I called Granny, even though it was early in the morning. She came down to the desk in her house coat and slippers with her dog in tow.\n\nThey begged her to move her car - Granny told them it would be $150 bucks - leave the check with the concierge. They kept bitching. Then she told them it would be an extra $50 for waking her up in the morning cause they claimed an emergency. Then they asked her how long before she left the garage.\n\nGranny told them \"Dearies, I'm retired. I'll leave my spot when I'm ready. And the price just went up to $150 a day, plus $50 for waking me - and that will be in cash. Leave the envelope with the concierge. I'm walking my dog and I'll move my car when I have your rental fee in hand.\"\n\nNot only did the renters never park in her spot again, but Granny got her cash.\n\nAs an added bonus, the two ~~grifters~~ renters bitched so much that word got around and I didn't have to deal with that issue for another two years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdited from the other post on [https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/z6uabj/couple\\_decided\\_to\\_steal\\_a\\_deed\\_parking\\_space/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/z6uabj/couple_decided_to_steal_a_deed_parking_space/)   .

Because I worked both shifts I obviously knew thé different types of work loads that came with each shift, and although yes during the day we had a lot more outpatients, in the evening the staff went from around 10 to just 3 (we’re a small town) so it would just be one phlebotomist and 2 lab techs. Well this particular day shift phlebotomists would always leave her room a huge mess, she’d leave trash all over the place, supplies all over, and never fill back up the supply stock trays like we were supposed to do before she left. So in the evenings I’d have to clean that all up, all while also trying to do my normal job as I was the only one there (the lab techs work in the back processing and running the lab tests). After a few times I asked nicely if she would make sure to clean up her station before she left, and she responded that she was too busy and I had plenty of time to do it on 2nd shift for her (even though it was literally her responsibility and no one else did this). So what I decided to do was after cleaning her mess up and refilling everything, there was a big plastic bag full of the plastic hubs that go over the needles and when I put it back in the drawer I made sure to place it in there upside down so when she came back in the morning and eventually had to refill her tray (we went through a lot so we refilled multiple times a day), when she picked the bag up the huge bag of hubs all fell out all over the floor. It was like 100  of these things and it made a huge mess that she then had to clean up lol. So almost every time she’d leave a mess after that I would make sure to put the bag in upside down. The first time it happened and it actually worked I just died laughing, but eventually she caught on and came up to me and said that I needed to be more careful with putting the bags away because she keeps spilling them all over the place. So I replied “sorry I don’t have time to pay attention to how I’m putting the bag in, you should just try and look before you pick it up” Her face was priceless and she hardly ever left her station a mess when it was me on 2nd shift after that…but every once in a while I’d still put the bag in upside down and crack up laughing at my dump petty joke lol. There were even a few times that I had to work 1st shift the next day and got to hear the sound of them falling all over the place and her flipping out and I laughed so hard I almost peed my pants",

        "text": "I worked in a country store a several years ago. We had a hot bar where we served breakfast and lunch daily. Basic items eggs, bacon, sausage, fried chicken, chicken strips, and things like that. When the health inspector would come in he’d lie and blame us knowing it was his own fault for things like mislabeled products. He was the one who created the labels for us to put on the products. Somehow he’d always skate by with a passing inspection despite all the problems found. I became pretty friendly with the health inspector over time and managed to get her direct contact information.              \n\nI went above and beyond for this man. I’d take deposits to the bank when he didn’t have time or was out of town. I’d pick up supplies in another city when our usual person wasn’t able to. It was never enough for this man. I had run the business for months while he looked for a manager. One day he accuses me of stealing a coffee drink $2.50 and I lost it. I shoved my receipt in his face and walked out. \n\nI was so angry and hurt after all that I had done for him. I knew my leaving would mean nothing to him always another sucker looking for a job. So I did the only thing I could think of to get back at him. I started calling the health inspector. I initially called about things we had successfully hidden from her. Boom a surprise inspection. I’d call and say the drink fountain nozzles had mold in them. Boom another inspection. I did this monthly for over a year when a friend of mine became manager and asked me to stop. When she quit guess what back to calling. It has now been almost 10 years and I live over 1500 miles away but still every couple moths I throw a call to the health inspector.",

I parked in an open spot and then went up to visit my buddy for a few hours. When I came out (now dark), I saw that someone had put up big wooden signs in front of my car with one of the businesses name on them- along with instructions that you are not allowed to park there after 8:00PM. They also decided to give me a ticket.   \n\n\nMy first reaction was to take the signs down and take a picture of my car. I can fight the ticket if there was incorrect signage. After a few moments of yanking these down and pondering, my petty rage began to grow until it bloomed. I thought of all the time I'd have to waste dealing with this and how predatory this was. Be the change you want to see in the world and all that... So I loaded up all (3) of the big wood signs into the back of my car and left. Fuck them! \n\nThe fallout- I never paid the ticket and never heard a peep about it. My friend got married a few months later and got great use of those signs after they repainted with wedding stuff.",

        "text": "I posted this as a comment a few months ago, and a few of you suggested I make it it’s own post. \n\nOver a decade ago, I went to college in a small town. It’s a very oil driven town. If you don’t work for a drilling or we’ll service company, you work for someone that supports or services this type of work. \n\nI was in school for automotive. The school was subsidized by 3 major automotive manufacturers, which helped out considerably on costs for tuition, books and rent. Rent was the big one. The school rented out about two dozen apartments, the. Subleased them to us, for a greatly discounted rate. As part of the class organization, we did two months at school, then rotated home and worked at a dealership as an apprentice for two months to get practical knowledge. While we were at home, another group rotated into school. This rotation went on for 18 months.  \n\nThese were not high end by any means. They were lightly furnished with the best Walmart could buy. But we weren’t complaining. For the bull majority of us, this was our first foray into independent living. \n\nI was assigned to live with two other guys in a small 3 bedroom on the bottom floor. It was a sub level, with our windows being at ground level. The first week or two were great. No issues. We were all in the same manufacturer course, which had us starting class at 6:30 am, so we all helped out getting each other up and moving for class. \n\nAfter the first week though, we started having noise issues with the apartment above us. Stomping around, or a child running heavy footed. At first we didn’t mind it, kids will be kids. Then we realized that it was happening almost all hours. 2, 3, 4 AM, the stomping never seemed to stop. This went on for about two weeks. Then magically stopped. We quickly realized that the man that lived above us was an oil field worker, and would leave on two week “hitches” on the rig, leaving his wife and two young kids. It was the times that he was gone that would get loud. \n\nWe confronted her once we realized what was going on. This was our first time meeting her. She opened the door with a scowl and a “what!?!” Being over a decade ago, I can’t remember what she said exactly after that, but it amounted to us being scum automotive students and that the other rotation was a terrible group of guys who partied and kept her kids up. It basically amounted to her bitching us out for what the other group did. We tried to explain that we didn’t know them, and they didn’t know us, and we couldn’t be responsible for what they did. She replied, “not my f***ing problem” and slammed the door in our faces. \n\nThe stomping increased from then on. Every attempt to talk to her was met with more anger, and she eventually stopped answering the door. It was at this point we decided to go to war. We started simple. We started following her around while tapping the ceiling with a broomstick. This backfired two fold. 1) she starts stomping harder. 2) we quickly realized that we were crushing the popcorn ceiling. \n\nOur solution after this was genius. This all occurred at the end of the heyday of flip phones. At this time, I had one with a prominent 1” antenna. While inspecting the ceiling to see how much damage we’d done with the broomstick, we found that a previous owner had I stalled hooks for hanging plants in almost every room. When we removed the hooks, we found that my phones antenna and another roommates antenna on his phone fit snuggly into each hole. This led to us calling the phones, which then transferred the vibrations to the ceiling, amplifying them considerably. \n\nThe next week was an all out assault. Any time stomping started, we would Insert a phone and start calling. We ever recruited friends from school to do multiple rooms at once. For a day or two, the stomping increased. But by day 3, our barrage was having a serious effect. By day 5, we could hear her speaking to someone on the phone very loudly about the sound she couldn’t explain. \n\nFinally, on the 6th day, she caved, and came down to confront us. The apartment was full, we had 8-10 of us over doing homework. My roommate, a very sarcastic man from southern New Mexico, answered the door. She demanded to know what we were using to make the buzzing sound, and to quit it immediately. With a straight face, my roommate replied that we weren’t sure what it was, we figured one of her kids found one of her “love toys” and had been playing with it and leaving it on or dropped it down a vent. \n\nWe all burst out laughing hysterically, and a few of us got up to go to the door and see the look on her face.  White as a ghost, she scurried away. We then heard the sounds of her tearing her apartment to pieces. To further the effect, we followed her from room to room, buzzing away. This went on for another half hour before we quit. \n\nThe next day, we continued the noise, until we saw her husband come home. Being fellow working guys, we agreed early on tha we didn’t want to mess with him as the stomping ended when he was home. We heard an argument ensue shortly after he walked in, that lasted through the day.\n\nAll was quiet the next few days, then, we left mid week for our rotation home. When we returned, we found that they had moved out. Happy to be the straw that broke the camels back, we went about our lives. We did find out later, after becoming friends with the apartment manager, that they had broken their lease about the time we left. \n\nTLDR: Don’t stomp on the ceiling of vindictive college boys, we have no filter.",

I met a woman there I’ll call Destiny. \n\nWe would chat when it was slow, grab food on breaks, that sort of thing. \n\nWhen her friend Eve started soon after, things got weird. Eve never liked me and I’m not sure why. I was always pleasant to her. \n\nOne day Destiny came to me and said Eve was getting jealous that the two of us were friends. Readers, we are women in our 30s. Not 15. Destiny said if all three of us were working it would be better for “you to do your thing, and we’ll do ours.” Oh-kay then.\n\nShortly before I quit, we had a really cold snowy night. Instead of waiting for the bus, I decided to get a cab. They are few and far between on these cold eves, and the phone line stays busy. Same for Uber; it’s not as easy to get one as it is in many cities. It’s better to flag one down as this is a fairly busy road. \n\nI soon spotted Destiny and Eve huddled together, walking ou the door of the shop. I realized I had to beat them to a cab. I speed walked one street up and saw a magical vision: a free taxi driving towards me. I took my time getting in as they both stared at me from down the road. As the cab drove past I looked at them with a blank expression. \n\nI know it’s not huge revenge, but I like to hope it took them a long time to see another cab.",

        "text": "I got reminded today of this revenges from a while back. Not sure how petty they can be considered, or if it was a needed thing. 😅\nSo, I work as a bike rider delivery person in a very touristic city in Europe. A few years ago, before covid, we had less people doing this same work, so we had groups on whatsapp with almost all the active riders/drivers.\nWe were paid per-delivery, and long waits in the restaurant were always a problem.\n\n This one particular restaurant got not one, not two, but three separate \"petty\" revenges come their way.\n1st PR: they would always make us wait a long time (over 30 minutes). We would always complain about to each other without finding a solution. Until I once went there. I'm normally very chill, but that day I lost my cool after seeing people get in and out or in and start eating and I was still out, waiting for a couple of pizzas I had to deliver. I put my bike in front of the door, my backpack in front of the bike and stood there, blocking their only door. The waiter came and rudely said I couldn't block the door. I said \"and you can't make me wait 40 minutes for 2 fucking pizzas. I'm in public soil, so if you want me to leave, give me the pizzas and I'm out\". I was out of there in 5 minutes. I told so to my colleagues, and they started doing the same for a while.\n\n2nd PR: at the time, we could refuse doing deliveries without explanation. We all decided to stop accepting deliveries from this restaurant after a colleague of mine got his bike thrown in the middle of the road because he blocked the door of the restaurant for 50 minutes and than the cook (and owner) came out of the pizza making area (was in the middle of the restaurant) just to offend him in front of the clients. \n\n3rd PR: the company we worked for started to call us to implore us individually to stop the boycott (we told them what happened, they said they would look into it, but nothing change). Most of us refused, but the orders kept coming. We decided enough was enough. We bombarded the place with one star reviews and said horrible (mostly true, since it was all service related) things about the place. They lost a gigantic portion of their clients. They had 4 restaurants (were opening the 5th) in the city, now they only have two, and had to go to a smaller place with one of them. None of their restaurants are in the touristic area no more. This change happened before covid, so we know it was us 😉😅",

It's been posted over the weekend on various sites but I figured I would post it on facebook for extra visibility.\n\nNow I know I am in for mixed comments and I can just hide them. It's small but like I said, recently redone and looks great for not much money. Well, someone had commented on how it's a shack only worth 10k tops.\n\nMy pettiness kicked in and while I only hid the comment I went to the auditor site for a quick snoop. Pasted his name into it and came back with his address which I promptly threw into google for a street view. [I got this house](https://imgur.com/a/L8v3e0T).\n\nWhile this pettiness only extends this far, maybe one should deal with your own issues before trying to shit on other people.",

        "text": "So I have had this ongoing cyber bully battle thing with my ex fiance (of 4.5 years)'s baby mama for the last 7 years now even though I've asked her repeatedly to leave me alone and everytime I block her she'll make new and fake accounts. She's tried to get me fired &amp; arrested. Made empty threats yet claims everytime I went to her  place to scrap she was pregnant (I didnt know you could  be pregnant for 2.5 years straight but okay👌). She runs her mouth all over snapchat till I finally snap and say something back, then she screenshots it and plays victim on Facebook, but when I screenshot my proof all of a sudden I'm a \"stalker\".  I have the means to get a PFA on her as well as get her fired and have her kids taken away and I haven't (dad didn't raise a rat). As of late her and my ex split again for the billionth time and she's \"supposedly\"  trying to get a PFA on him for \"allegedly\" choking her twice in front of the kids (I wouldnt put it past him but i think shes lying like she usually does). And she's trying to take his kids away even though she has nothing. The house, furniture and vehicles are all his and she doesn't even have her license and how do I know this you may ask HE messaged me the other day and told me all the dirty little secrets. I'm guessing he's either hiding it from her ( because he added me on fb and snapchat and now all of a sudden both accounts are disabled) or she found it and doesn't want me having all the information he told me. BUT if she doesn't know... DO I TELL HER? She's \"supposedly\" all heart broken over the break up should I be petty and let her know she wasn't enough woman for him and that's why he was trying to come back to me?",

        "text": "Years ago I lived in an old house that was just inside the 'wrong side of the tracks' if you know what I mean. But it was affordable, we had a number of fruit trees, and for the most part being right on the edge our neighbors were quiet, looked out for each other.\n\nThe house was on a corner lot, with the detached garage on the side. The garage looked like crap, the driveway was sunken in about a foot below the level of the grass and curb, but it was still obviously a driveway as you know, we parked our car there. \n\nTwo groups of people would regularly block the driveway, even if our car was parked there. The people going to the Catholic church across the street (I wish this was a story about getting back at them, but really they were just hell on earth to be neighbors towards), and the 'guests' of the drug dealer next door on the side the driveway was on. \n\nYounger guy, maybe mid 20s, living with his grandma, growing weed in the backyard. Honestly, I don't care. Leave me alone and I'll leave you alone. At least his 'guests' would leave quickly or just move if I went outside to the car (unlike the church dillholes).\n\nBut one night I get home and there is a party going on, and my driveway is blocked. I honk a few times, no one comes. My yard is shit anyway so I say f\\*ck it, I want to get inside and go to bed, so I drive over the curb, across the grass and then 3-point park in my driveway. \n\nDrug dealer guy comes over cussing at me, claiming I almost hit the truck (wasn't even close). I point to the dash cam and he calls me a few names and leaves. Truck gets moved quickly.\n\nNext day I buy a burner phone. Many of his 'guests' are from local businesses with *the business name and number on the truck*. Plumbers, landscapers, things like that. Vehicles that don't look out of place sitting parked randomly in the neighborhood.\n\nEverytime I saw one of them parked nearby (I could see pretty well from one of the backyard windows, but would be hard for them to see from the street), blocking my driveway or not, I called the number. I'd claim to be a member of the church monitoring their cameras, and 'just making sure they are working on a house nearby because I wouldn't want them to get caught up in the drug sting'. About half the time I'd be speaking to someone directly in the vehicle and they would quickly drive away, even if drug dealer guy was walking out. Sometimes I'd get a receptionist who would be confused as to why their truck was there, but it would still move quickly.\n\nAfter about a month of this (and maybe 20 calls), none of the neighbor's \"guests\" parked in front of my driveway again. He met them around the opposite corner, away from the church's cameras.\n\nFor those thinking I should have called the cops... we literally had a sheriff substation around the other corner, 600ft walk away. They didn't care and pretty sure the neighbor sold to cops too, they were just smart enough to not be obvious about it.",

I let it slide for the first 2 times, considering it could be honest mistakes.\n\nThis time, just to see her reaction and excuse, I asked if the price got raised (knowing in advance that it didn’t, because the day before I bought it for 4,50), and she stuttered, came up with an “ I don knoooo” , in a whinny voice, which is bulshit, because she necessarily has to check the receipt to give everyone their respective changes. \n\nWell, guess who’s not getting tipped anymore ?",

        "text": "This happened like three years ago and I probably was very dumb for doing it but at the time I was a bit heartbroken. My boyfriend and I had a three month old daughter when I found out he was cheating with my best friend. I know it's a cliche but I really felt unattractive and unlovable because of it. He was the first guy I'd been in a relationship with so it hit hard.\n\nI'd worked through my anger and hurt where he was concerned, but my ex best friend and I had unresolved issues because we never really saw each other face to face after I walked away. The one time I confronted her, she basically told me if he was really meant for me then he wouldn't have cheated and was now in a relationship with her. \n\nAnyway, after a while and I was in a better place mentally, my ex visited to spend the day with my daughter. He slept over that night as he usually does. He still does now on the weekend. Against all odds we're friends for my child's sake. Trust me it wasn't easy. Anyway, that particular Saturday he came on to me and I went along with it, but after I came, I basically stopped him. I didn't care how he got off. \n\nIt was a bit weird. I realized then I wasn't into my ex anymore. And also that I wasn't the fault for him cheating because he'd basically done the same to the new woman he supposedly love. Her words lost its effect, and I was able to laugh in her face about it. \n\nShe didn't leave him and is still with him today but that's okay. I wouldn't want him back anyway. She's one of those clueless females who a man will cheat on over and over (and I know for a fact he cheated on her with not only me but with others as well), and she won't figure it out like I did when she cheated with him.\n\nAnd yeah I know sleeping with him can be seen like \"girl, you stupid. You got back with that man,\" but this revenge wasn’t about him. It was all about her and proving he would do the same thing to her.",

I called again and it was a different manager, i told her what happened, she understood that previous manager failed to send me the list, but she also said that im still getting a write up for not calling someone to take my shift and that it was in my orientation.\n\nHere’s the petty revenge:\nDoc said I can’t go back to work until 12/01, and i have to be fever free for 24hrs.

At the time I was furious that she was using her internship to dig into confidential information, but because she was “family”, I kept my mouth shut. \n\nI think it’s about time I make things at the hospital about her, as she seems to like attention.

The last time my bf saw his dad in the flesh was when he was 10. He remembers his mother didn't trash-talk his dad, and was just honest at times like Christmas -- with 0 child support, she couldn't buy a lot. My bf's brother who is older remembers them waiting with their suitcases to spend summer with their dad, and he didn't show.\n\nThey were close to and even lived with their aunt for a time as kids. She barely contacted them after their mom died. I recently asked my bf if he'll send a courtesy invite to his aunt for our eventual wedding, since she did invite them to Thanksgiving those first few years. He corrected me, \"she didn't invite me. She invited (brother).\" My bf was still in college. \n\nIf my brother died as a single parent and left behind two kids barely in their 20s, I couldn't abandon them so easily. I know details are messier/more complex than what I know. But their relatives didn't even have to raise them... They couldn't have invited them over more and made sure they had a fucking family? And his ain't isn't even child-free. My dad is extremely involved in my cousin's adult life after her dad died when we were kids. He never had to raise her, he was just *there for her* and we lived 4 hours away. \n\nOf course everyone's friends on Facebook. I guess Aunt has said happy birthday to the boys and messaged them once or twice. Three years ago my bf became Facebook friends with his dad, who's now happily retired and living well off the trade skill that paid him under the table. His dad asked if he'd ever be interested in meeting up. Bf said yes. His dad ghosted him. \n\nMy bf rarely if ever posts on Facebook. I post fairly regularly, but don't tag him often because I think it's dumb when a dude's entire timeline is just his gf. One of the few exceptions was today's photo-dump of our Thanksgiving weekend with his brother. It's the second time I've referred to his brother on social as his sole living relative/only living family member. I once emphasized how great it is to spend time with them and know \"my boyfriend's only family.\" Today I said maybe it really is nice and more laid back to only have one living relative. \n\nNo screaming drama ensued. But his aunt did like my post. I hope it's loud and clear, not just that these guys are happy and successful, despite how absolutely fucked everyone around them was. But that those \"relatives\" are dead to at least me. Fuck all of them.",

        "text": "My grandfather is in his 80’s. In his prime, he was a tradesman. He’s got a couple stories that was well-received in r/maliciouscompliance. This is another one of his stories. For simplicity’s sake, he will be referred to as Gramps.\n\nOn this specific job site, Gramps was running a long-boomed forklift. He had an issue with a tradesman, whom I believe Gramps said was an electrician. We’ll roll with it for the sake of this story.  The issue was that Mr. Electrician kept parking in a specific spot that was completely in the way of the work area. Gramps tried being nice and approached the guy multiple times—telling him not to park there. But since he had to approach him multiple times, the message fell on deaf ears.\n\nEarly one day, Gramps has had enough of Mr. Electrician’s holier-than-thou attitude. So he takes the forklift tine extensions and navigates the tines underneath Mr. Electrician’s car. This forklift could reach to the second story, he decided Mr. Electrician didn’t deserve _THAT_ much of a repercussion. That also could easily backfire on him. So, Gramps maneuvers the car elsewhere.\n\nThe workday ends, and unsurprisingly, Mr. Electrician’s car is gone. Mr. Electrician approaches Gramps and asks about his car. Gramps tells a mistruth and tells Mr. Electrician that the car was towed. When pressed for more information about the tow truck, Gramps plays dumb and says he was too busy to pay attention to the tow truck.\nOn the second day, Mr. Electrician’s foreman approaches Gramps. He asks Gramps to come clean to Mr. Electrician. Gramps refuses, but later that day, he retrieved Mr. Electrician’s car.\n\nTo this day, Gramps doesn’t think that Mr. Electrician doesn’t know where his vehicle went, but Gramps’ act of petty revenge was well-received and Mr. Electrician never parked there again.",

        "text": "This is the story that got me banned from posting in r/legaladvice.  \n\nA few years ago (Pre-Rona) i had a serious medical incident. Not going into too many details but i wound up spending a few months recovering in the hospital in the largish city near where i was living at the time. This was 3-4 hours drive from my hometown. \n\nAt the end of my stay in the major hospital we decided I would be transferred to a physical rehab hospital in my hometown for further recovery and PT. This meant i needed an ambulance transfer back home. We got the arraignments made with a national ambulance company and the day of the transfer was smooth nothing I needed to worry about... or so i thought. \n\nFast forward about 6 months. I have recovered and have returned to work at the same employer and suddenly started getting collections letters concerning my ambulance ride. i call my insurance company to ask what the heck and they have no record of that trip ever being submitted for payment. They see where the first hospital was billing then boom the rehab hospital starts billing nothing in between. \n\ni call the ambulance company and talk with their customer support and inquire what the heck is the deal with going straight to collections instead of submitting it to my insurance. They claim they did that i must have ignored the bill (Spoiler alert i am on a HDHP meaning once i hit a certain out of pocket dollar amount my insurance pays 100% i don't even see the bill unless i log into the app and look at my charges.) i explain this and the rep is very dismissive that such a thing exists. i direct them to recall my account from collections and to submit the claim to my insurance as they should have done in the first place. \n\n3 months later i am still getting letters and harassing phone calls are now coming in at all hours. i contact my insurance and explain the situation and how i had tried to resolve this 3 months ago but they are being extremely shady. i offer to 3 way call the Ambo company again and the insurance rep who i got the sense was reeeeeeeeeeallly looking forward to stomping a shady provider was totally up for it and even had their supervisor come on the line as backup. i place the 3 way call and get through the menus to talk to an actual human and start my spiel and the Ambo rep is adamant that no they submitted the bill and i was just shirking my responsibilities. \n\nThis is when the 2 insurance reps speak up and request proof that the claim was submitted. This is when i inform the Ambo Rep that oh yeah i have my insurance provider on the line so we can get this resolved since the Ambo company has been very uncooperative in that regard. over the next 20 minutes or so the Ambo rep tries to lay it off as the Crew that transported me didn't submit the run sheet for my transfer insurance reps smell blood and start in on if the run sheet was never submitted then how did they submit the account for collections? No good answer for that. after Ambo Rep passes the call up a level or 2 to get to someone that has the authority to cancel a collections account and resubmit the claim for my run i am satisfied, the insurance reps are happy since they found an  incident to hit them with in their next contract negotiation and the Ambo Reps have reached the end of their ropes we end the call and i go on about my life. i did receive 1 more letter in the mail a few days later but that was obviously in transit when i made my call.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni posted a shortened version of this story in response to a poster on r/legaladvice who was getting similar collections actions against him for medical services that had been performed but never submitted to insurance. i wanted to demonstrate i had gone through a similar situation and give them the advice to get their insurer involved as they sure as heck know if a claim has been made against your account.",

They became estranged from his family including his 4 siblings and their families.\n\nMy stepfather became sick and my\nMom became his full time caregiver. His brothers and sisters, with a few exceptions, didn’t help at all or even visit him in the hospital.\n\nAfter he died they badgered my 75yo mother. They questioned the care she’d provided, even asking why there was no autopsy (he was 72 and ill for years). She was so upset at their ingratitude.\n\nWhen my mother died 18 months later, I was the executor of her/their estate. I returned to my stepfather’s family boxes of photographs and other mementoes.\n\nBut not the 18K gold charm bracelet that belonged to his mother. It had charms with all the kids names on it and others from family visits to Italy.\n\nI took it to a local gold merchant and sold it for scrap, probably close to $1,000. I still smile at the thought of their precious family heirloom being dropped into the smelter.",

Trying to leave (after 10.5 hours of work) can be harder on weekends when sports games are ending like tonight. I get to my car and can see there is a line of cars waiting to exit past where I am on the 3rd level. I put my car in reverse and wait for the next break between cars and start backing up. The next car honks at me, pulls right behind my car and stops (as the car ahead of him isn’t moving). Luckily the next car lets me in. Now I use this garage everyday, I know where the exit on the other side of the building is, so once we get down to the lower level, I drive right past the rude guy who probably had another 10 cars to go before he could exit. \n\nDon’t let me backup? You don’t get to follow me to the easy exit. Petty revenge :)",
