        "text": "Hey, new to this sub (just finished S4), so I'm sorry if this has been discussed already. Is there a definitive difference between cookies (like what is seen in White Christmas) and transferring of consciousness (as in San Junipero or Black Museum)? The technology seems virtually the same in both cases, but in the case of cookies, the consciousness functions as its own entity, a copy of the original consciousness, while transfers seem to imply that the consciousness has moved from one host to another. \n\nTo give a specific example, in Black Museum, [Spoiler Alert] (/s \"Haynes specifically refers to the procedure performed on Carrie and Jack as transferring consciousness, not copying it. So is the Carrie in Jack's head just a copy, like in cookies? If so, wouldn't her consciousness still exist in her comatose body, at least until she was euthanized?\") \n\nI would love to know this sub's opinions and interpretations, I have spent way too much time thinking about the philosophical implications of this relatively minor plot point.\n\nTL;DR - What's the difference between copy and transferring consciousness?",

The test went wrong, he died, the corporation is creepy and unethical and dangerous.\n\nBut the second time I watched it, it was much more obvious to me just how awful this episode is.  Cooper dies in about a minute, but in his mind that minute lasted several hours and during that time he sees and experienced horrors that the game KNEW would scare him.  Imagine the deepest darkest stuff you are scared of way down deep inside. Imagine the game targeting and torturing you with those scary things for hours. In the real world, the programmers saw him die after the phone rang and probably thought he had a stroke or something. They can’t see the data to know what actually happened to him inside his mind. They keep testing and torturing innocent people and not realizing how cruel the death is for them in that one minute.\n\nI dunno... this episode on a re-watch was way more horrifying to me. I’d rather watch the pig fucking lol.",

        "text": "**Black Mirror SxEp03 - Greener Grass**\n_(Inspired by a true story)_\n\nA wealthy man, Marcus, is the first subject in a new cloning project where people can transfer their consciousnesses into designer bodies that are created in a lab. Marcus hates his born body with a passion, hating his mediocre height, looks, and even skin tone. He spent much of his own money funding the research for this project. The day finally arrives and Marcus is going to be able to transfer out of his old body, which he deems completely genetically worthless, and into the tall, handsome, fit body he deems best reflects his personality. One of the nurses, Josie, doesn't see his body the way Marcus sees it, but Marcus insists his body is trash and wants it disposed once the transfer is complete. The day comes and Marcus is able to move into his new tall, handsome, fit body. The process is a success. Once in his new body, he orders his old body to be disposed, arguing it's so flawed and worthless, it's not even fit for organ donation. \n\nJosie the nurse is tasked to get rid of the body, but she waits until after hours and manages to smuggle the body into her car and drive home with it. At home, she is greeted by her brother, who is severely crippled and in a wheelchair. Josie tells her brother Billy she has a donor body for him. Using the equipment at home (most of the procedure being software based), Josie is able to transfer her crippled brother into Marcus' old body, and the process is a success. Billy awakens in Marcus' old body, overjoyed at his ability to walk and be relatively healthy. He hugs his sister Josie for giving him a new chance at life.\n\nAs the new and improved Marcus enjoys his new body, he starts to become a bit arrogant and is surprised when his new \"perfect\" body doesn't guarantee him success with women and instant respect from others like he thought it would. In the meanwhile, Billy enjoys all the things he can now do in life, like running and playing at a playground. As Marcus becomes frustrated that his new body isn't giving him the perfect life he expected it to, Billy decides to volunteer his time at a homeless shelter and meets a young Arab girl there, Shari, who is also a volunteer. She's not quite a looker, but Billy quickly becomes her friend. Marcus manages to get a date with a woman who is just interested in him for his looks and money, but his attitude and negativity soon drives her away, causing the date to end early. Meanwhile, Shari soon falls in love with Billy due to his kindness and humility. Billy is living a happy life, while Marcus continues to be unhappy even in his perfect body.\n\nOne day, the news media captures coverage of Billy at the homeless shelter, where he's become known as a local community hero. Marcus sees him in the news however and is furious. Marcus sues the cloning facility for not disposing of his old body like he asked and the story makes headlines. To save face, Josie admits she was the one who spared the body, and that it wasn't her employers fault. Marcus doesn't care and wants his old body destroyed. Josie and Billy try to plead with him and ask him why. Marcus tells them why: his old body is a sign of everything that ruined his life. Women found him to be too short and unattractive in it and it made him depressed and suicidal. He loathes everything about his old body and it's the reason he funded the cloning project to begin with. Josie manages to show Marcus everything that Billy, her formerly paralyzed brother, was able to do in his body, however. He managed to garner popularity and even a girlfriend, all the things Marcus could never do in his old body. Josie tells him that his self-hatred comes from within, not just from the external appearance. After holding back tears, Marcus decides to drop the lawsuit and let Billy stay in his old body after all. He admits being in the perfect body didn't fix his problems finding love and self-acceptance, so Billy is able to use his old body as he wishes, granted Marcus never has to look at him ever again.\n\nAfter donating a sizable contribution to the homeless shelter, Marcus decides to see a therapist and Billy proposes to Shari. The story ends with Billy giving a speech to a group of would-be participants of the cloning procedure to learn to accept the body you've been given, as there will always be someone out there who likes you as you are, and things could always be worse.",

I thought Always Something There To Remind Me was a good choice for Black Museum.\nThey also manage to fit relevant songs into the main episode - in San Junipero they use 'Girlfriend in a Coma' when Yorkie's trying on outfits. That's the song I think of when I think of the episode now.\nThey also could have used it in Black Museum butttt probably would have been a bit too on the nose...\nWhat was your favourite credits song?",

However a song I never heard on the radio at the time was T'Pau's \"Heart and Soul\" which is totally f-en amazing! I can see it peaked No. 4 in US charts, so it's strange I never heard it on the radio. That's why hearing it now feels so fresh. Not only that but I've given the whole \"Bridge of Spies\" album a whirl and it's mostly great. One of the best debut albums ever.",
