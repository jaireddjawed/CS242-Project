We see the same camera angle of him walking up a set of stairs and his fear of opening the door to his mother’s room because he knows he has to talk to her.\n\nIf there is any episode that deserves a rewatch, it is this. There are so many details that connect the real world with the “haunted mansion.”",

But then cookie Joe saw himself living together with Matt for 5 years, during which he probably saw Matt every day. How could Matt act out 5 years of living with cookie Joe if it was only 70 mins from his perspective? Plus it would mean his conversation with Joe in the episode happened within a few IRL seconds, which would be impossible for any real person to accomplish unless he's secretly the Flash.\n\n5 years would make more sense, but that brings another question: why 5 years? I understand the point is to make Joe break down and submit, just like what was done to Greta. But all Matt did was to sit down and share his stories with Joe over a few glasses of wine, and that was enough to bait Joe to confess. So why didn't Matt attempt to talk to Joe at all in the past 5 years? If i recall correctly, Joe said something like \"You never really talk to me at all, why now?\". Even if Joe is adamant to not talk, I'm positive that if Matt had pestered him every day, it would have taken much less than 5 years for him to give in!",

I'm sure other people might have discussed this on here, but I couldn't find anything thing about it and I thought it seemed like an interesting talking point. The episode really felt like it did the book a lot of justice when describing that sort of reality, obviously it was it's own but still.

        "text": "This show always, always, always messes me up for several days/weeks/months per episode and it takes me a long time to process each one, so I've been going through the show pretty slowly.\n\nI just got to San Junipero and I have some thoughts I want to process. I scrolled through some old discussion threads and couldn't find anyone who vocalized quite this aspect of the episode, so here are some of my thoughts:\n\nYes, it was a happy ending; yes, it was a relatively upbeat episode overall. But it was still a horribly sad ending in many ways. I was absolutely shocked that Kelly decided to stay in San Junipero permanently. It made me really happy, though -- the immediate satisfaction of this adorable couple staying together, the gratification from knowing that Yorkie gets a chance at experiencing the parts of life she missed out on the most. However, Kelly's emotional rant after she slapped Yorkie her last night on the temporary plan had some really, really good points. Yorkie looked like the dumb Disney princess at that point, believing that their marriage was real after a handful of dates when Kelly had experienced decades and decades of sorrow, joy, and deep companionship with a man who she had no reason to stop loving. I felt wrong and selfish, too, for wanting Yorkie and Kelly's relationship to turn out. I have no idea what Kelly/Richard's relationship was like, but 49 years of a healthy marriage is a powerful thing.\n\nSomething about all that gives the show a sorrowful twist to me. I'm surprised Kelly went back on her unspoken vow with her husband. But I do still feel satisfied that Yorkie gets her desires granted and also gets a shot at a potentially long, loving marriage. I think this episode, in a lot of ways, is just as sad (and certainly just as complex) as any other episode of Black Mirror.\n\nAnother thought is that I'm certain my interpretation of this episode is heavily influenced by the worldview I bring to it -- one that suspects an eternal afterlife, and, therefore, one that would wonder if Kelly's husband and daughter are waiting for her. Suspecting that Kelly's family moved onto another life and she chose against following them changes the tone of every decision made in the show. \n\nNearly every episode of Black Mirror acts as a truly good piece of art, forcing my worldview to interact with it, forcing me to determine truth from it -- but this episode has done so very uniquely. I love it.\n\n\nThis is longer than it should have been. Feel free to either ignore this or share your thoughts (I'd love to hear them).",

        "text": "Most posts I found on Nosedive was about it's critical message towards social media. I also saw many voice complaints that it wasn't subtle enough and lacked depth, unlike the other episodes. Imo, yes, it was critical about social media, but that was just the first layer, which I felt was done to be purposely obvious. Here are some things I noticed. What do you all think?\n\nWhen Paul finishes his speech at the wedding, he immediately goes over to Anthony. They do the intimate chest bump and lock eyes. He's so wrapped up in the moment that he never once looks at Naomi \\- his new wife! Not only that but the way the boys grabbed each other tightly and nearly kiss reveals the suppressed sexual tension between them. Most likely they're a couple under the guise of a bromance, hence the intensity and the longing gaze. In Paul's speech, he literally tells Anthony he loves him, but he only gives big thanks to Naomi (bc they're obviously just social ladders for each other). Naomi's expression reveals that she is aware that Paul is gay and that he has a relationship with Anthony. It also shows that she is uncomfortable with the fact that they're homosexual.\n\nAlso, Paul jokes \"by your standards\" in his speech (in ref to Anthony's speech), then in the chest bump scene, the \"you earned it,\" reveals that Anthony was Paul's Lacie. Anthony was a low 4 pointer that would get ranked higher from being in a high 4 environment and Paul would rank up for being that nice, charitable friend for helping a low 4 pointer. The only difference is that he happens to actually like Anthony while Naomi has always treated Lacie like crap.\n\nThe excitement shared between Paul and Anthony seems to stem from how they've both stepped up in their ranking and thus securing the upper tier of the upper social class. For Paul/Naomi who are already there, it takes a lot to actually maintain the status, so I imagine the grand wedding/charity gestures were done in order to ensure some months of peace of mind. (IRL ranked games such as LoL follow this \\- if you don't continue to prove yourself in that rank, you'll drop.) So there's that going for Paul and Anthony and, they probably can be more intimate with each other bc to everyone, Paul's happily married now \\- so less suspicious. Their happiness is probably the most real in the wedding.\n\nWhy hide his sexuality? Black Mirror worlds reflect our own \\- current state just in futuristic settings. So in Nosedive, while yes, there are probably other non\\-straight people out there walking about, it doesn't change the fact that people are still discriminatory towards any non cis\\-gendered white folks. People finding out Paul is gay would cause him to lose his ranking.\n\nPeople have also pointed out that generally, the upper middle class (&amp; upper upper class) who have higher rankings than others are mostly white. The black woman with the high 4 that Lacie bumps into is equivalent to how it's still possible to jump into the upper class, but the lack of diversity illustrates that it's just so much more difficult and rare. Lacie's consultant explains that in order to score high, your inner social circle must consist of other high ranking people. In real life, most people claim it's all about hard work but this Nosedive system literally tells you no, it's not. It's kind of obvious bc that's the only way for many of the audience to notice. We're too used to our flawed system to see anything wrong with it otherwise. In the Nosedive world, much like ours, if you're not white and straight, people are more prone to rank you lower (because you'd then be the \"other\" \\- the starting point for the \"norm\" is a cis white male). Also, even from everyone's outfits, they all kind of look the same \\- not much individuality due to fear of putting someone off.\n\nThere's basically hardly any leeway for acceptance or tolerance. Any indicator of different just starts you off with a disadvantage and we all saw how quickly your rank would fall. (IRL \\- credit score, grades, etc. \\- hard to rise but easy to fall). The shallow ranking system just shows how stupid it is to discriminate or pass judgment against others based on appearances or one\\-off interactions. The social media aspect was mainly a means or tool to point out the discrimination that happens in all fronts of life. Besides the social media critique, everything else seems to be on the subtler side bc it'd be chaotic to emphasize everything. It does shine some light and I think that just plays along with how it all appears in the real world.",

        "text": "So Kelly gets some criticism for choosing San Junipero instead of the unknown afterlife where her husband and daughter may or may not be. However, if the traditional view of heaven is real then her soul would go to heaven. When someone chooses to \"pass over\" into San Junipero I think that is a digitized copy of their consciousness not their soul. So I think there is the possibility that a person could go to two heavens. There could be a cosmic heaven for the soul and the man made San Junipero for the digital copy of their consciousness. \n\nI think it's interesting that the writers have created a man made Heaven (San Junipero) and a Hell (White Christmas). What would you choose? Would you choose an unknown afterlife or the real (to you at least) afterlife of San Junipero? \n\nSome could say the idea of Heaven and Hell is just something used to manipulate people into behaving well in life to go to the good place when they die. If people knew they could go to San Junipero when they die do you think people would behave more badly while alive?  ",
