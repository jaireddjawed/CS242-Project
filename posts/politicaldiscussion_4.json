Moscow and Beijing insist it has nothing to do with other nations, but experts say the very public forging of ties between the two countries is unquestionably a message to the United States.\n\nOne of the biggest and most immediate concerns is that [Beijing could start providing weapons](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/antony-blinken-china-russia-lethal-support-ukraine-face-the-nation/) and or ammunition — lethal support — to help boost Russia's war on Ukraine.\n\n\"China is already supporting Russia's war-making machine,\" said McMaster, noting Beijing's increased purchase of Russian oil — 60% more, he said, over the last year. \"So, they're feeding Putin… to keep the war going.\"\n\n\"They also are providing microelectronics and other materials that have led the U.S. Commerce Department to blacklist a large number of Chinese companies already,\" McMaster added. He said the question now for Xi is whether it's worth going \"all-in with Russia\" and risking his country's vital economic ties with the West.\n\n\"That incident, combined with Wang Yi's criticism of the United States and now his trip to Russia… it clearly has crossed that threshold into a new type of Cold War,\" said Medeiros.\n\nChina has not shied away from opportunities to flex its military power alongside Russia's. On Wednesday, the two nations [launched joint military exercises along with South Africa](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-china-south-africa-military-exercise-during-ukraine-war-no-hypersonic-missile-test/) off that country's coast. U.S. officials have voiced concern over the timing of the war games, coinciding with the one-year mark of Russia's ongoing assault on Ukraine.\n\nCan U.S. deter China from supporting Russia?",
