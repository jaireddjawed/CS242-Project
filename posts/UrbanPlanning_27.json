        "text": "I see a lot of threads here about getting a MURP degree in general, but not much about specific programs. Any thoughts on the [online MURP from University of Florida](https://dcp.ufl.edu/urponline)? It's no longer the only online degree available, but still the cheapest. My questions:\n\n1. **How well respected is this?** A degree is the work you put in and  what you take from it, but there is still a stigma with online degrees.  How much would that hurt at hiring time? (Thoughts on online degrees generally)\n2. **Do most folks in planning see \"University of Florida\" on a resume and think, \"oh, one of those online slackers\"?** That is, how widely known is this program.. considering that it has been the only online offering for so long? (Thoughts on this online degree specifically)\n3. **PAB accreditation is (supposedly) coming, but not here yet. Is that a dealbreaker?** Word is, the online program should be accredited by spring. If that doesn't happen, how detrimental is that toward being marketable on graduation?\n4. **Would it hurt too much having the academic component far away from my  practical component?** Most class examples will probably focus on the Gainesville area, while I'm studying growth in Bend or Seattle. My internship would be in the US Northwest.\n5. **There is an optional GIS certificate that can be had without doing extra coursework**, just  choosing those classes as electives instead of others. Is that worth it or would it be better to focus on other topics in planning?\n\n**tl;dr:**  Is this thing viewed like something from the University of Phoenix -  an instant disqualifier at competitive hiring? (networking and all else aside)",

It makes sense to me that it would reduce the land value. Especially with all the semi-truck traffic it creates, but is it just my assumption? \n\nAlso, as the city redevelops and fills in the holes downtown with mixed use development, the factory is on land in the entrance of downtown on main street. How would you get rid of it from the valuable area? My personal theory is that you could gift the factory land next to the interstate and industrial area, and maybe even a temporary tax relief if they sign a contract that they would move their operations from downtown to the industrial park. But again, I don't know if that would even be a smart thing to do.",

        "text": "I’m a college student graduating in December. When I transferred to my current institution, I was two years into my collegiate career and had to make a quick decision about what I would study. I told my parents that I wanted to go to work in Real Estate Development (so logically I deduced that finance or economics would be the strongest choice). My dad (who has been quite successful in business himself) advised me to consider law school… reasoning that if I decided that I didn’t want to pursue a career in development, there would be plenty of employers willing to hire a student who had gone through the challenge of law school, regardless of whether or not they wanted to take the bar. With this in mind, I switched my major to study political science.\n\nHowever, as my graduation approaches, another option is opening up. Recently, a very prominent Ivy League graduate said that he respected my work ethic, and would pull the strings to help get me into his alma mater. This is preferable, since it is a top institution, and would allow me to be more specialized. Keeping this in mind, he suggested that I take a year to participate in the workforce.\n\nThat said, all of my academic progress has been bound to the assumption that I would attend law school (internships in politics, legal oriented class work, etc.). I spend my spare time building financial models and reading economics textbooks for fun, so I’m actually better versed in the topics than almost every finance and economics major that I know personally—and what’s more, I’m enthusiastic about it. Nevertheless, even though I will graduate top of my class, most employers in the development world seem to be more interested in finance majors.\n\nHow would you guys suggest a person like me leverage myself into an employment opportunity? What sort of things should I include in a cover letter that would give me the best chance of securing an interview? This advice goes out to me, but also to all the students out there who wonder what they can do to change course.\n\nA confused college kid,\nJ.",

A lot of what we discuss in my CD courses relate to economic development and getting citizens employable skills, particularly those that will be needed in the coming years.\n\nWe know the world is becoming more technical, and employees in all sectors will need to up their skills or they will have a harder time competing for work. I suspect planning/ CD will be effected to some degree. \n\nThat said, as an aspiring planner, can anybody give me some insights on types of skills I should look to get. I'm a state employee and I get two free classes per term so cost is not much of an issue. \n\nAfter graduation I've already decided to complete an undergrad level GIS certificate that has the following courses \n\n- GIS for Non Majors (Part of my MPA, will likely allow me to waive undergrad intro class)\n\n- Remote Sensing of the Environment\n- Principles of GIS \n- Digital Image Analysis \n- Programming in GIS\n- Spatial Data Analysis \n- Transportation and Spatial Organization \n- Geospatial Databases (not part of the cert, but I'm guessing useful)\n\nThere is a grad level cert, but some of the courses don't come around *as* often. So besides the GIS cert, what are some technical skills that a person interested in planning (housing, transportation, most interest me) should get to be competitive in the 21st century planning field?

Pedestrianised shopping streets have higher sales (very ambiguous, because if all shopping streets were pedestrian zones, it probably wouldn't have the same effect). To be fair this effect is probably taken into account when deciding whether a street should be pedestrianised together with the cost of the time losses due to detouring. \n\n* The feeling of fear when crossing a road and the stress caused by it\n\n\nDo you have any others?\n\n",

Truthfully, busses kinda suck in a world where most people drive cars and traffic affects most roads so to encourage bus usage as much as possible busses ought to be made free which over time should, if ridership continues to go up, of making busses less shitty by reducing traffic and reducing travel times. Obviously preventing everyone from riding single occupancy cars is impossible but does the economics of free busses make sense vs other traffic reduction schemes?",

Now, I'd been thinking about something similar, though the blog seems to have a better idea,better specifics, of what needs to be done. \n\nSo how feasible is it to get that done in, say, Seattle? Turn small side streets into places for people and maybe that's it? Or where cars have to go slowly? \n\nOr maybe people have been able to do this to streets? Not just narrow the lanes, and add bike lanes but make them completely just for walking? Why is this hard in a city (or what are the obstacles to counter it?)\n\nedit: so someone [shared this link](https://web.archive.org/web/20151116050142/http://narrowstreetssf.com/mcallister/) about adding buildings to wide streets that aren't arterials and I agree, but the question is, again, how do we do it? Convince the city that such property is perfect for selling? Also the person who shared it, I can't see the original comment, but thanks",
